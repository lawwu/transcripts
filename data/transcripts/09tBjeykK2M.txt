[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.400]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:08.320]   All right, what do we got instead?
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.600]   All right, next call is about your thoughts
[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.080]   on the future of a 40-hour work week in the eight-hour work
[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:16.580]   day.
[00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.080]   Hey, Cal.
[00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.400]   For knowledge work, what do you think of the standard eight-hour
[00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.320]   work day, 40-hour work week?
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:27.960]   And what's ideal?
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.840]   And do you think that this is likely to change at all
[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.880]   in the next 10 years?
[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.600]   It's a good question.
[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.800]   So I've thought and written some about this.
[00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.760]   I had a New Yorker piece in January
[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.160]   that was about slow productivity.
[00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.640]   And it actually opened talking about some
[00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.200]   of these ongoing discussions to shorten the official work week.
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.320]   And basically, my take is focusing
[00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.880]   on the number of hours we work or the number of days we work
[00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.880]   in this broader context of burnout and dissatisfaction
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.840]   and a general reconfiguration of the working world,
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.200]   especially in knowledge work, I think it's a red herring.
[00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.000]   I don't think that is the problem that people have.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.240]   I don't think the problem that people really have with
[00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.680]   knowledge work right now is that they
[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.080]   have to work Friday in addition to Monday through Thursday.
[00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.200]   I don't think it's that the day ends at 5 versus 4 versus 3.
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.600]   These are knobs you can tune on the margins.
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:34.080]   And though I am a believer in results-oriented style of work
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.640]   and I think having a lot of variety
[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.200]   in how people configure their work days and work weeks
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.880]   is, in general, a nice thing to explore,
[00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.720]   it's not the solution on its own to the issues
[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.920]   of dissatisfaction and burnout that so many are facing.
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.080]   And my argument in that piece, and also an argument
[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.360]   I lay out in a video--
[00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.160]   and again, I'm really pitching these core idea videos today
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.720]   because this is why I recorded them for exactly this purpose
[00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.680]   so I can reference my ideas easily.
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.760]   But if you watch my core idea video on slow productivity,
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:01.840]   I make this point.
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.680]   The real issue is overload.
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.440]   The thing that is burning people out,
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.320]   the thing that's causing a lot of dissatisfaction,
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.600]   or at least one of the many factors in knowledge work,
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.080]   is having more on your plate than you can easily
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.640]   imagine accomplishing and having an incoming stream of ever
[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.960]   more piling on top of that.
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.960]   So you enter the state where you have this overwhelming amount
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.120]   of obligations and three different things happen.
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.280]   One, there is a mental short-circuiting that happens.
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.640]   There's a part of the human brain
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.000]   that is charged with making long-term plans for our goals.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.120]   That thing short-circuits when you give it
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.400]   75 different obligations and 700 unread emails.
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.520]   It can't figure out a plan for all of those things.
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:47.720]   And then it feels like it's failing
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.560]   to make plans that are things for important.
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.560]   And you feel anxious and you feel overwhelmed.
[00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.160]   We have a short-circuiting effect that
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.240]   directly makes us feel bad.
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.800]   Then we have a pragmatic negative impact,
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.520]   which is overhead spirals.
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.000]   Everything on your plate that you
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.600]   agree to do, be it a small thing or a major project,
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.280]   brings with it a fixed amount of collaborative overhead
[00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.120]   that is required.
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.440]   OK, to get this done, I have to talk to some people
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.680]   and keep people posted and go find some information I
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.800]   need to accomplish it.
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.160]   Now, that's all fine if you give me one thing to do.
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.560]   Yeah, I got to find information and talk to some people
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.360]   and have some meetings where we can discuss
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.680]   how it's going to happen.
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.800]   The problem is when you have more on your plate
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.480]   than you can handle, when you're in a state of chronic overload,
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.480]   each of those things brings with it
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.560]   its fixed amount of overhead.
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.880]   And if you have a huge amount of things on your plate,
[00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.000]   that overhead alone takes up most of your schedule.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.600]   Everyone experienced this who had
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.240]   a certain type of knowledge work job
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.400]   during a pandemic experienced this when they found
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.920]   their calendars get completely full with Zoom meetings
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.040]   back to back to back to back, and their inbox
[00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.640]   is completely overflowing.
[00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.680]   That is overhead spirals, an overhead spiral.
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.440]   You have too much stuff on your plate,
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.960]   so the overhead takes all your time.
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.320]   And why it's a spiral is because now if all your time is
[00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.360]   spent servicing the overhead, you're
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.280]   making very little progress on the things that remain.
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.560]   So more things pile up.
[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.240]   And then you get more overhead that you
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.200]   have to service, more meetings, more emails.
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.560]   You get farther and farther behind.
[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.840]   This is maddening.
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.960]   It's misery making.
[00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:24.960]   It's almost satirical sometimes how it feels,
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.240]   how much you're just in these meetings and doing email.
[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.360]   So it completely crushes the soul.
[00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.760]   And it ends up requiring you to try
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.440]   to fit work into early in the morning or in the evening
[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.760]   or on the weekends because it has to get done sometime.
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.400]   So now you're losing the time that you
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.880]   would ordinarily spend to do other things
[00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:42.480]   that are important to you.
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.560]   And that is going to accelerate burnout as well.
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.840]   So that is happening as well.
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.800]   And then you just have the alienation from output
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.040]   because you have so little time to actually do the stuff
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.600]   that you're good at doing, the stuff that actually
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:52.280]   makes an impact.
[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:53.680]   You're doing it in small bursts.
[00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.280]   And you're doing it at night while all day you're on Zoom.
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.880]   And there's a real alienation from your productive potential.
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.120]   So chronic overload, having more on your plate
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.120]   than you can easily handle, creates
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.680]   these three horsemen of the knowledge worker burnout
[00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.920]   apocalypse.
[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.800]   This is why we are predominantly feeling so bad
[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.920]   is this overload that we're all feeling.
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.440]   And if you tell me you don't have to work on Fridays,
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.120]   that doesn't help much because I still
[00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.400]   have all of these things.
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:22.640]   I'm short circuiting my brain.
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:24.640]   I've overhead spirals taking up all my time.
[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.440]   I'm just going to put work in that Friday anyways
[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.200]   because when am I going to get things done?
[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.200]   It's not by itself going to solve the problem.
[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.740]   How are we going to solve the problem
[00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.240]   is stop having so much stuff on people's plates.
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.960]   The work should get stopped at a central system
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.800]   from which you can pull when you have free cycles.
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.600]   When I'm done with what I'm working on now,
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.200]   I'll pull something else.
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.000]   You can't just let that damn burst
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.500]   and just throw it on everyone's plate with no constriction,
[00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:50.840]   with no restraint.
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:54.440]   I think that is really much more important than reducing the work
[00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:55.680]   week or reducing the work day.
[00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.160]   Now again, I think flexibility is critical.
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.960]   Reconfiguring your hours is critical.
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.320]   But we don't have a crisis of having too many work hours.
[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.720]   And this is a very different way of thinking about this
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:09.560]   because in an industrial context,
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:12.320]   work hours was the main knob you had
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.040]   to turn when trying to deal with the employee's
[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.720]   subjective experience of work.
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.440]   If you worked on an assembly line,
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.360]   the main metric that seemed to matter
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.940]   was how much time do you have to spend
[00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:24.200]   working on that assembly line.
[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:27.080]   So a union was going to fight for less hours, which
[00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.200]   they successfully did in the early 20th century.
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.940]   And that's where the 40-hour work week came from.
[00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:34.320]   In the context of knowledge work, the issue is different.
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:35.880]   It's not the number of hours so much
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:37.920]   as it is the number of things on our plate that's
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:39.400]   causing a lot of the troubles.
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.780]   So that's where I want to make sure we have a lot of focus.
[00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:43.000]   Because if we don't solve that problem,
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.480]   it doesn't matter what you say about how many days you're
[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:48.440]   supposed to work or how many hours you're supposed to work.
[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:51.720]   We will be miserable until we solve that problem.
[00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:54.800]   Now this brings us back to the first caller who
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.320]   was talking about the disagreement between me
[00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:00.160]   and Alan Jacobs in the Hedgehog Review.
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.640]   It is exactly this problem where my style solution
[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:05.720]   shows up and I think has some merit.
[00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:08.040]   Because when I'm looking at this very pragmatic problem,
[00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:12.360]   I said we have to figure out how to re-engineer work systems
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.440]   so that you do not have too much stuff on your plate
[00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:15.860]   because it causes a lot of misery.
[00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:17.000]   This is a boring thing.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.400]   This is like in the industrial age,
[00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.960]   if in the late 19th century, earliest 20th century,
[00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:24.160]   if you're there saying we have to actually change
[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:27.880]   the way we've configured these assembly lines because the wheels
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.120]   are moving by too fast and people are getting repetitive
[00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:31.120]   strain injuries.
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:34.600]   That's kind of a boring but pragmatic solution.
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.320]   Now in that early 20th century context or the late 19th
[00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:40.000]   century, the sexy stuff would be we
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.680]   have to rethink capitalism.
[00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:47.280]   What we need is to socialize the plants
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:49.600]   or we have to have a Marxist style revolution.
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:50.480]   That's the sexy stuff.
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:52.160]   That's big think theory.
[00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:55.080]   We've got to rethink how we even allocate and make profit
[00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:57.440]   off of capital and the alienation of labor.
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:58.800]   And that's the exciting stuff.
[00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:03.200]   The boring stuff was we need to give more breaks to the workers
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:04.920]   and slow down the steering wheels.
[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:07.560]   I'm like that boring guy today with knowledge work.
[00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:10.400]   The sexy stuff is these post-capitalist visions
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:13.960]   of reimagining the role of work and rethinking
[00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:16.360]   what work means in our life and how much we have to do
[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:18.320]   to support ourselves and et cetera.
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:19.780]   That's the sexy, interesting stuff.
[00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:21.240]   And I'm in here saying, yeah, but also we
[00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:23.740]   have to make sure that you can't have 50 tasks on your plate
[00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:24.760]   at the same time.
[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:27.240]   And this is a workflow system problem.
[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.200]   It's a productivity system problem.
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:30.000]   It's not exciting.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:30.640]   It's not sexy.
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:32.120]   But it's the stuff that can actually
[00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:34.000]   make a difference right now while we're
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.960]   waiting for the overthrow of capitalism.
[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:38.280]   I think that's a good question.
[00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:41.280]   That's where I'm putting my focus, though,
[00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:45.640]   is in the short term, overload is one of the biggest problems
[00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:46.800]   that I think we could solve.
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:49.440]   And the reason why I think we can solve it, by the way,
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:53.000]   is it's not a--
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.800]   the relationship here is one of more
[00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:57.880]   win-win than other type of labor issues.
[00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:00.920]   So the chronic overload makes workers
[00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:02.720]   less productive in a lot of ways.
[00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:05.960]   Clearly, if you're in an overhead spiral,
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:08.000]   it limits the amount of good work you can produce.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.400]   Clearly, if you're burnt out and leaving your job,
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:11.960]   that's bad for the employer.
[00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:16.280]   So pull-based systems, where you have a small number of things
[00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:17.880]   on your plate at a time, but you work on them really
[00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:20.240]   intensely and then pull in a new thing when you finish,
[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:22.480]   will probably actually, from a company's perspective
[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:24.200]   or an organization's perspective,
[00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:26.040]   more things will get done at higher quality.
[00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:27.400]   Their employers will be more happy and not
[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:28.000]   burn out as much.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.800]   I mean, it's a bit of a win-win situation.
[00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:30.840]   It's just complicated.
[00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:32.400]   So this is the nice thing about this
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:35.400]   versus other labor movements we've had in the past.
[00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:37.960]   This is not so much labor versus management.
[00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:42.560]   It's more like labor and management versus complexity.
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:44.560]   The way we work now is easy.
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:46.360]   The way I'm talking about it is a pain.
[00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:48.200]   And things that are a pain take a long time to get right.
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:49.960]   Who wants to be the one that first wants to completely
[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:50.760]   rethink their work?
[00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:51.920]   And what if it doesn't work?
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:53.640]   And I've talked about this before.
[00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:55.360]   It took Henry Ford years to figure out
[00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:56.960]   how to make the assembly line profitable.
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:58.160]   Until then, he looked stupid.
[00:09:58.160 --> 00:09:59.920]   So it's a whole complicated mess.
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:01.500]   But that's where I'm putting my focus.
[00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:03.160]   I like flexibility in work.
[00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.120]   I like to be able to control when my hours are,
[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:06.280]   to some degree, great.
[00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:07.720]   But let's fix the overload problem.
[00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:10.520]   We're going to get a huge immediate benefit.
[00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:13.880]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:16.460]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:18.140]   (upbeat music)
