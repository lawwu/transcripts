[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Hello everyone, Tony Reinke here with a solo episode, Just Me Today.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   An exciting day for me today because my new book is out, God, Technology, and the Christian Life.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   That's the title and I get to share with you a few thoughts today on why I wrote it.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   I've really dreamt of writing this book for several years now.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   Back when I wrote 12 Ways Your Phone Is Changing You, it proved hard to write.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   Harder than I expected because I couldn't find a baseline theology of technology
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   that would sort of root my thinking with smartphone habits specifically.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   So I kind of came to discover that there was a theological gap in how Christians think about modern day technology,
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   which surprised me. And without that foundation, I had to build one of my own.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   So I wrote a little 10-page introduction in the smartphone book,
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   and I called it A Little Theology of Technology.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   I was publishing 12 ways, like pages 29 to 39 at the beginning.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   Some big categories had to be in place before I addressed Steve Jobs, his iPhone,
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   our social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   I also knew this smaller theology of technology would need to eventually become a larger theology of technology,
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   and I knew if I could pull this off, it would serve a need in the church in the tech age.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   But I would have to answer one massive question.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   What is God's relationship to big tech?
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   What does he think of smartphones and space travel, nuclear power, and agricultural innovations, and on and on?
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   I had to answer that huge cluster of questions.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   Are the innovations we use today from God, or is it all a product of Godless worldliness?
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   Because what we do with our technology will never be clear if we cannot answer this more fundamental question.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   So I'm thrilled to announce that my fuller theology of technology is written, published, and now out from our friends at Crossway Books.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   Soon I will be Lord willing inside Silicon Valley, busy with four events spread over two days across the Bay Area,
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   to celebrate the book launch and to give away hundreds of free copies.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   It's never about book sales. It's about books distributed, books read.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   And so we're giving away hundreds of copies of my new book to key leaders inside Silicon Valley,
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   something possible because we have generous ministry partners making those giveaways possible.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   So thank you for your support. You make it possible for us to do this.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   And your prayers would be greatly appreciated for those events as well, if you think of me, on January 25th and 26th.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   One event on that first day, January 25th, is scheduled to be live-streamed online.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   Watch Desiring God's social channels for details if you want in on that.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   On the 25th, I'll be talking about the origins of electricity and jumping into a huge theological debate
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   that Ben Franklin accidentally stirred up in New England. It's a great story.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   I'll be sharing it on January 25th, and we are launching my book through our friends at Westminster Bookstore,
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   our official retailer, online. There you can get the book for 50% off, I believe.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   Check it out at wtsbooks.com if you're interested.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   Okay, so seven years ago when I began writing my smartphone book,
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   I came to see that the church lacked a basic framework for evaluating technology.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   And this is tragic because, on the one hand, it breeds a Christian dystopianism,
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   where it seems like one key to holiness is to shun innovation, or at least to never say anything nice about it.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   You know, furrow your brow, squint your eyes, turn up your nose, be suspect of all new tech
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   like you would treat a new R-rated movie. That's godliness.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   But that's not godliness. It's a mindset that often leads to a type of wannabe agrarian
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   who lives with this air of anti-technology about him, but who also has an iPhone and drives an SUV,
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   and sees no irony in it. But on the other hand, without a clear framework for approaching tech,
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   it also breeds a Christian who eagerly adopts every new gadget from Apple
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   without working through any of the consequences of how the new shiny device will serve him or undermine his life.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   And so both of them, the wannabe agrarian and the eager adopter,
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   both tend to live from a flat, oversimplistic view of the world.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   So I came to discover that the church could use a hard reset.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   In understanding God's relationship to science, innovation, and Silicon Valley,
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   we need to take this whole topic and unplug and re-plug it back in.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   That's how I typically fix electronic problems. And that's what I'm trying to do in this new tech book.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   It's a restart. It's a power down, power up, let's clear the cache and start from scratch.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   But it also means returning to an age when theologians began building the scaffolding for the vision that we need today.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   I'm particularly thinking about French reformer John Calvin in the 16th century.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   Calvin was a reformer. He sought to bring reform to the church, and he did reform the church in many important ways,
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   three of them significant for how Christians relate to science and industry.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   First, Calvin destigmatized wealth.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   He distinguished the sin of loving and hoarding wealth from the virtue of capital employed for the good of society at large.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   That was big, especially when a dominant vision of peak spirituality was the monk in a desert monastery.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   And Calvin said, "No, no, no, no. You can be a shining example of godliness as a wealthy Christian
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   who stewards that fortune selflessly to employ others, to grow industries at scale, and to serve legitimate needs."
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   And of course, that's where new innovations originate from industrial wealth.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   So Calvin unleashed diligent Christians to pioneer new businesses.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   Second, Calvin unhitched the church from what Rome attempted to do, which was to adjudicate major scientific discoveries.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   He said instead, "No, no, no, no. The Protestant church will preach Christ and him crucified.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   Scientists will do their thing without the church meddling in its business as the final arbiter."
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   And when you remove the threat of heresy for observable phenomena, it changes the church's whole relationship to science.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   It encourages new discoveries, and it even encourages Christians to make those discoveries as well.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   But third, and maybe most importantly, Calvin set a vision of science and human innovation that was radically God-centered,
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   a vision we simply call "common grace."
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   He said there were two plans enacted by God.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   God was unfolding his plan for the church, uncommon grace or a special grace in Christ,
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   in his gospel and in his people and his church.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   But God had a second plan, a common grace for the growth of society, economics, and industry.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   And Calvin went so far as to say that the same Holy Spirit that regenerates us is the same Holy Spirit that causes profitable human,
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   culture, and scientific discovery and innovative creativity among Christians and non-Christians alike.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   Amazing.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   Calvin's remarkable vision of the world would later find its highest expression inside the world's great watershed of human innovation.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   When we speak of tech today, we often make the mistake of limiting the discussion to Apple gadgets and computers and smartphones and smartwatches,
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   electric cars, robots, AI, things like that.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   But the story of tech stretches way back to past centuries.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   One of the most important came in the late 1800s.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   300 years after Calvin died came a 50-year span of human innovation in which everything changed.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   1863 to 1913.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   During this generation, cities were electrified.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   Light bulbs replaced candles in homes.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   Electrical motors came to power industry.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   Music was first recorded.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   Photography was first employed.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   Video recordings were invented, made, and movies projected.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   Airplanes first lifted off the ground.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   Huge iron ocean-worthy vessels connected continents.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   Gas-powered engines began to pop.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   Cars replaced carriages and family horses.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   Tractors replaced farmhorses.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   Typewriters replaced pens.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   The qwerty keyboard layout that we still use today was invented.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   Telegraph wires began to send electronic messages at unthinkable speeds over unbelievable distances.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   Wireless radio waves united mass audiences by live broadcast.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   Medical advances in germs and vaccines ended many awful, killing diseases and viruses.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   Literally everything in life changed between 1863 to 1913.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   Advances in science, medicine, travel, shipping, communications, and industry.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   Permanent changes that continue to shape our daily lives today.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   With all this new innovation speeding along at full tilt,
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   Christian thinkers leaned in and asked the key questions.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   What does it mean to be a people of faith living inside such a massive, life-altering technological revolution?
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   How are we to think of these endless scientific discoveries and new, innovative promises?
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   Where does it come from?
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   Is this innovation of God?
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   Is it of the world?
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   Is technology godly?
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   Is it godless?
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   Inside this tech era, a writer by the name of Abraham Kuyper took up these questions and returned to Calvin's old vision.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   Kuyper was a journalist, a theologian, and a one-time Dutch prime minister.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   He knew the world. He knew politics, economics, industry.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   And he experienced this great watershed technological revolution firsthand.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   And he knew his Bible well.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   And he came to see, like Calvin three centuries earlier, that God was still governing the story of human innovation by his Holy Spirit and his gifts of common grace.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   And so it seemed like the church was progressing well in understanding innovation in the 19th century.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   But this technological revolution, these 50 years, with all of its incredible promise and progress,
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   was abruptly followed by World War I, followed by World War II, followed by the Cold War.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   And it became really clear, really fast, that for all of our new, innovative powers to heal,
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   humanity had also mastered the art of massacring at a scale never before witnessed.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   The conversation over God's common grace changes when your tech can now incinerate 100,000 people in the hyperblink of a nuclear explosion.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   Theologians would now have to account for new powers of mass destruction.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   Following two world wars and then the nuclear standoff of the Cold War, the church's theologians changed their tune.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   The tenor of the Protestant conversation about human technology veered dystopian.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   Our theologians more likely demonized technology and Babel-like categories,
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   innovations as agents of power, dominance, inequality, and mass destruction,
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   rather than as expressions of God's Spirit and gifts of his common grace.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   And so without diminishing very legitimate concerns,
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   I'm bridging back over two world wars to a vision of God's common grace in which there were both tech warnings
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   alongside a healthy dose of Godward thanks for the technologies that adorn daily life.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   Those must exist together, warnings and appreciations.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   And they do. They hold together nicely when we turn our attention to the Bible.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   So we need to look afresh at the origins of industry and the birth of human innovativeness,
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   as we find them in Genesis 4. And we need to see where our technologies,
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   the actual material technologies themselves, emerge from the created order, as we discover in Isaiah 28.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   And we need to look at God's relationship to the most powerful and most dangerous technologists in the world.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   And we'll see that in Isaiah 54.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   And we need to look at how man so easily idolizes his technological powers as idols,
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   and false saviors, as we see in Psalm 20.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   There are idols at play, but the incredible generosity of the Creator is also at play
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   in giving us a universe loaded with oil and gas and electricity and uranium and metals and plastics
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   and silicon and computer chips and the 60 natural elements that comprise our smartphones.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   All our innovations are owing to the incredible generosity of our Creator.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   In other words, the challenge is to reclaim a vision of human innovation in which we see God's common grace once again.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   For me, talking about tech is just another way to explore the generosity of our God.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   And so I'm asking, which is bigger? Is big tech bigger than your God?
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   Or does your God dwarf the powers of big tech?
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   We know the right answer in our heads, but do we believe it, truly believe it in our hearts?
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   I fear when it comes down to practice, for many Christians, big tech seems stronger than God.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   So we get insecure and threatened by tech because we hold a vision of a God who is bullied by the power players inside Silicon Valley.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   That must be reversed.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   And it's not reversed by demonizing tech, but by seeing the gift of God in the tens of thousands of innovations
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   we use daily and take for granted, not to mention for the layers of innovation at play right now for you to hear me.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   All of these innovations are gracious gifts of God's common grace.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   I wrote this book for non-Christians, for Christians, for techies, for non-techies,
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   and I'm launching it inside the belly of the beast, inside Silicon Valley.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   But you don't have to live in a tech center to see its relevance. We all live in the tech age.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   Ultimately, I want all the innovations you take for granted every day to turn your eyes to see the generosity of our eternal, unchanging God.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   So you can imagine my thrill when Pastor John took the time to read my book slowly and then said for him it was a worship experience.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   That's my aim. That's my hope. And I hope you'll join me in worshiping this God.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   God, Technology, and the Christian Life, my new book, is now out.
