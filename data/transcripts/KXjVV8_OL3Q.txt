[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.080]   Okay, let's talk about how cavities form,
[00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.840]   because I think this is the major question
[00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.500]   that people ask when asking about
[00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.200]   or thinking about oral health.
[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.760]   As I mentioned before, cavities are literally holes,
[00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.280]   they're fenestrations, as the nerds call them,
[00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.840]   nerds like me call them.
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.160]   Little fenestrations, little holes down into the enamel
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.440]   that if they make it down to the dentin layer of the tooth,
[00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.720]   most likely do need to be drilled and filled
[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.560]   and presumably billed, okay?
[00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.880]   But your goal, I think all of our goal
[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.720]   is to try and keep our teeth
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.040]   in a state of remineralization by keeping the pH,
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.600]   that is the relative acid-alkaline balance of the mouth,
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.300]   such that the saliva supports remineralization.
[00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.040]   Now, let's think about how a cavity actually forms.
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.320]   Turns out that no specific food,
[00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.980]   not even sugar, causes cavities.
[00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.680]   Cavities are not caused by sugar.
[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.240]   Cavities are caused by bacteria that feed on sugar.
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:05.400]   And now that's not just a little bit
[00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.120]   of a twist in the mechanism, that's a critical point.
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.360]   There's no specific food, not even pure sugar,
[00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.680]   not even like a hard candy, like a delicious Jolly Rancher,
[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.240]   I used to like those when I was a kid,
[00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.520]   that gets stuck in your tooth that causes cavities.
[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.160]   No, it's the bacteria that feed on sugar
[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.460]   that then produce acid that burrows down through,
[00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.020]   that degrades, that demineralizes the tooth
[00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.340]   in this very focal area that we call a cavity, okay?
[00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.620]   Now, if that isn't surprising enough, get this.
[00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:43.580]   The bacteria that causes cavities by eating sugar
[00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.500]   and releasing this acid, while there are several of them,
[00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.740]   the major one is called streptococcus mutans,
[00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.020]   or what I'll call strep mutans for short.
[00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.780]   Strep mutans is not something you're born with.
[00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.560]   It's actually a communicable bacteria.
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.760]   That's right, you give it to one another through how?
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.940]   Sharing of glasses, sharing of bottles,
[00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.600]   kissing on the mouth, et cetera.
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.600]   Now, I am not here to tell you not to do any of those things.
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.840]   I'm certainly not here to tell you that.
[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.020]   However, and by the way, in researching this episode,
[00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.040]   I did learn that there is a specific category
[00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.000]   of person out there.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.920]   Typically, they are a dentist or married to a dentist.
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.980]   That have opted, believe it or not,
[00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.460]   to never kiss their children near or on the mouth
[00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:32.220]   so as to help their children not get streptococcus mutans
[00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.640]   because almost all adults carry it, not all,
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.720]   but it's communicable like a STI or like a flu
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:39.560]   or like a cold.
[00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.480]   It's communicated between individuals.
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.480]   We are not born with it.
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.680]   Now, that's a whole area of,
[00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.000]   let's just call it bio-social ethics decision-making
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.900]   that I think most people are not going to be too concerned
[00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.720]   with or at least act on because let's face it,
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.480]   most people are not going to change their overall behavior
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.080]   of kissing or usage of bottles or glasses
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.660]   in order to avoid getting strep mutans.
[00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.080]   Most people in the world have strep mutans
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.140]   or will get strep mutans and it lives in the mouth, okay?
[00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:13.320]   It just resides there.
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.780]   Strep mutans is there and it's hungry.
[00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:17.760]   What's it hungry for?
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.320]   Sugar.
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.380]   When there's sugar present, it eats it, it produces acid.
[00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.060]   The acid produces cavities,
[00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.780]   taking teeth from a state of remineralization
[00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.060]   to demineralization or, and by the way,
[00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:31.940]   this is really important.
[00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.380]   If your mouth is already in a state
[00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:39.380]   that's more demineralization mode, so to speak,
[00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.460]   well, then it will capitalize on that
[00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:46.140]   and it will cause cavities much faster, okay?
[00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.320]   So keep in mind that acidity is bad for the mouth.
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.360]   Does that mean that you should never consume a lemon or,
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.400]   and by the way, yes, I'm guilty of every once in a while
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.280]   I'll chew a lemon slice or drinking water with lemon in it
[00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.760]   or carbonated drinks or sodas or tea
[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.100]   or anything that has acidic flavor?
[00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.940]   No.
[00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.880]   Likewise, should you completely avoid ingesting
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.440]   any kind of sugar because strep mutans love sugar?
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:12.280]   No.
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.680]   It turns out strep mutans like sugars
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.280]   in the form of complex carbohydrate sugars too.
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.080]   So if you eat pasta or rice or oatmeal
[00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:21.240]   and some bread every once in a while, as I do,
[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:23.680]   I'm an omnivore, I eat meat and fish and eggs
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.960]   and also starches and vegetables and fruits.
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.400]   I'm an omnivore, as most people are.
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.380]   Well, then strep mutans has an opportunity
[00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.180]   to eat the sugars that come from those other carbohydrates.
[00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:35.560]   Does that mean that if you were to have
[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.080]   a zero carbohydrate diet, no sugars, no starches, et cetera,
[00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.880]   you would reduce the opportunity for strep mutans
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.640]   to consume sugar and release acid?
[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.480]   Maybe, maybe.
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.640]   However, most people won't do that.
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.160]   And strep mutans is a very clever,
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.880]   maybe even diabolical bacteria.
[00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.240]   And if you were on a zero carbohydrate, zero sugar diet,
[00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.960]   there's some evidence that strep mutans
[00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.440]   will figure out ways to feed on other components of food
[00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.220]   in order to create this acid
[00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.460]   to then create cavities in your teeth.
[00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.160]   So the key thing to understand here
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.800]   is that cavities form not from foods,
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.760]   not from sugars per se,
[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.020]   but from strep mutans and other bacteria
[00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.920]   that eat those sugars and create acid.
[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.720]   Hence the critical need to keep your mouth
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.160]   as alkaline as possible,
[00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.320]   which does not mean that you can ever drink
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.240]   some lemon water or coffee or tea.
[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.760]   Here's the key point that everyone needs to remember,
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.280]   because this dovetails beautifully
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.640]   into how often you should brush and floss
[00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:34.180]   and when you should brush and floss specifically.
[00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.520]   The key point is the degree to which your mouth
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.280]   is in a de-min state or a re-min state,
[00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.840]   and the degree to which cavities
[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.240]   have the opportunity to form
[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.900]   is dependent on the amount of time,
[00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.640]   the amount of time in which your mouth
[00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:52.680]   is net acidic or net alkaline,
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.760]   the amount of time that you are in a de-mineralization mode
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:59.320]   or re-mineralization mode.
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.280]   Okay, so it's the amount of time.
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.120]   No one, no one can avoid
[00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.160]   having their mouth be acidic every once in a while
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.400]   or ingesting a sugar or a food that strep mutans
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.000]   can feed on and produce acid.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.120]   The key is to try and reduce the amount of strep mutans
[00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:17.400]   and reduce the amount of acid in the mouth.
[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.600]   That's the best way to reduce cavities
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.300]   and even reverse cavities that have started to form.
