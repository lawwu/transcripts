[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.740]   something has to happen with Iran.
[00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:03.520]   There has to be some diplomatic bilateral
[00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:04.720]   communication there.
[00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:06.640]   - No, what has to happen is the containment of Iran.
[00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.280]   - History moves in one direction.
[00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.200]   - Right. - Why?
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.160]   - Because of time.
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.080]   - Communism, Nazism, all of that was a regression
[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.360]   from what was happening at, for example,
[00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.600]   the beginning of the 19th century and the 20th century.
[00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.760]   - In what way?
[00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.240]   - Do you think that today Donald Trump knows
[00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.080]   that he lost the election?
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.000]   - Absolutely.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.360]   - So I don't.
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.080]   - This is one of the areas where we get into this.
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.420]   I don't understand if there's like brain breaking happening
[00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.260]   or what's going on.
[00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.120]   I don't know what world we can ever live in
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.640]   where we say that Trump is less divisive
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.920]   for the country than Biden.
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.800]   - Joe Biden literally used the Occupational Safety
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.880]   and Hazard Administration to try to cram down
[00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.840]   VAX mandates on 80 million Americans.
[00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:41.720]   That's insane.
[00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.160]   - What about supercalifragilisticexpialidocious?
[00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.000]   And then you're done.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.820]   - What about pneumoultramicroscopics?
[00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:45.660]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:46.500]   - Or the science terms.
[00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.320]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.160]   - Or what about the 7,000 letter thing
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.440]   that's from part of a biochemical?
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.480]   - I got my education in the Soviet Union,
[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.680]   so we just did math.
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.660]   - That's why you're a useful person.
[00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.320]   - Does body count matter?
[00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.220]   (air whooshing)
[00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:00.460]   - The following is a debate
[00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.060]   between Ben Shapiro and Destiny,
[00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.060]   each arguably representing the right
[00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.360]   and the left of American politics, respectively.
[00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.340]   They are two of the most influential
[00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.780]   and skilled political debaters in the world.
[00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.200]   This debate has been a long time coming, for many years.
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.100]   It's about 2.5 hours,
[00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.660]   and we could have easily gone for many more,
[00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.960]   and I'm sure we will.
[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.020]   It is only round one.
[00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.700]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.
[00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.620]   To support it, please check out our sponsors
[00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:31.700]   in the description.
[00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.700]   And now, dear friends, here's Ben Shapiro and Destiny.
[00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.460]   Ben, you're a conservative.
[00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.380]   Destiny, you're a liberal.
[00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.540]   Can you each describe what key values
[00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.620]   underpin your philosophy on politics,
[00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.540]   and maybe life in the context
[00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.180]   of this left-to-right political spectrum?
[00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:50.240]   You wanna go first?
[00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.060]   - Yeah, so I think that we have a huge country
[00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.440]   full of a lot of people,
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.340]   a lot of individual talents, capabilities,
[00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.840]   and I think that the goal of government, broadly speaking,
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.980]   should be to try to ensure that everybody's able
[00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.980]   to achieve as much as possible.
[00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.860]   So on a liberal level,
[00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.740]   that usually means some people might need
[00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:10.580]   a little bit of a boost
[00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.780]   when it comes to things like education.
[00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.980]   They might need a little bit of a boost
[00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.900]   when it comes to providing certain necessities,
[00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.300]   like housing or food or clothing.
[00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.520]   But broadly speaking, I mean, I'm still a liberal,
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.680]   not a communist or a socialist.
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.240]   I don't believe in the total command economy,
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.800]   total communist takeover of all of the economy.
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:28.960]   But I think that, broadly speaking,
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.040]   the government should kind of kick in
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.040]   and help people when they need it.
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.880]   - And that government can and should be big.
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.360]   - Not necessarily.
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.440]   I noticed that when liberals talk about government,
[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.380]   especially taxes, it seems like they talk about it
[00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.680]   for taxes' sake or bigness' sake.
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.520]   So people talk about taxes sometimes as like a punishment,
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.200]   like tax the rich.
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.600]   I think taxing the rich is fine
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.880]   insofar as it funds the programs that we want to fund.
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.940]   But Democrats have a really big problem
[00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.680]   demonizing success or wealth.
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.180]   And I don't think that's a bad thing.
[00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.160]   I don't think it's a bad thing to be wealthy,
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.240]   to be a billionaire or whatever,
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.540]   as long as we're funding what we need to fund.
[00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.520]   - Ben, what do you think it means to be a conservative?
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.960]   What's the philosophy that underlies your political view?
[00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.800]   - So first of all, I'm glad that, Destiny,
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.060]   you're already coming out as a Republican.
[00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.040]   That's exciting.
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.240]   I mean, we hold a lot in common in terms of
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:16.920]   the basic idea that
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.800]   people ought to have as much opportunity as possible,
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.720]   and also insofar as the government should do
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.240]   the minimum amount necessary to interfere in people's lives
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.640]   in order to pursue certain functions,
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.460]   particularly at the local level.
[00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:36.120]   So a lot of governmental discussions on a pragmatic level
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.680]   end up being discussions about
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.120]   where government ought to be involved,
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.640]   but also at what level government ought to be involved.
[00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.960]   And I have an incredibly subsidiary view of government.
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.160]   I think that local governments,
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.240]   because you have higher levels of homogeneity and consent,
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.000]   are capable of doing more things.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.880]   And as you abstract up the chain,
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.400]   it becomes more and more impractical
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.780]   and more and more divisive to do more things.
[00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.040]   In my view, government is basically there
[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.120]   to preserve certain key liberties.
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.920]   Those key liberties preexist the government
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.120]   insofar as they are more important
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.840]   than what priorities the government has.
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.080]   The job of government is to maintain,
[00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.040]   for example, national defense,
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.840]   protection of property rights,
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.680]   protection of religious freedom.
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.240]   These are the key focuses of government
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.360]   as generally expressed
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.960]   in the Bill of Rights and the Constitution.
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.440]   And I agree with the general philosophy
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.400]   of the Bill of Rights and the Constitution.
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.360]   Now, that doesn't mean, by the way,
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.080]   that you can't do more on a governmental level,
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.600]   again, as you get closer to the ground,
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.560]   which, by the way, is also embedded in the Constitution.
[00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:38.680]   People forget the Constitution
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.240]   was originally applied to the federal government,
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.600]   not to local and state governments.
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.400]   But if I were gonna define conservatism,
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.520]   it would actually be a little broader than that,
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:47.520]   because I think to understand
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:48.880]   how people interact with government,
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.760]   you have to go to kind of core values.
[00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.360]   And so for me, there are a couple of premises.
[00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.840]   One, human beings have a nature.
[00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.200]   That nature is neither good nor bad.
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.560]   We have aspects of goodness,
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:59.880]   and we have aspects of badness.
[00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.640]   Human beings are sinful, we have temptations.
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.160]   And what that means is that we have to be careful
[00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.760]   not to incentivize the bad,
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.560]   and that we should incentivize the good.
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:09.800]   Human beings do have agency
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.440]   and are capable of making decisions
[00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.960]   in the vast majority of circumstances,
[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.240]   and it is better for society if we act as though they do.
[00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.400]   Second, the basic idea of human nature.
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.040]   There is an idea, in my view,
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:25.560]   that all human beings have equal value before the law.
[00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:26.840]   I'm a religious person,
[00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.080]   so I'd say equal value before God,
[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.600]   but I think that's also sort of a key tenet
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.760]   of Western civilization, being non-religious or religious,
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.720]   that every individual has equivalent value
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.640]   in sort of cosmic terms.
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.120]   But that does not necessarily mean
[00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:39.680]   that every person is equally equipped
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.080]   to do everything equally well,
[00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:42.760]   and so it is not the job of government
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.240]   to rectify every imbalance of life.
[00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.560]   The quest for cosmic justice, as Thomas Sowell suggests,
[00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:49.560]   is something that government
[00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.080]   is generally incapable of doing,
[00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.840]   and more often than not botches and makes things worse.
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.160]   So those are a few key tenets,
[00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.720]   and that tends to materialize in a variety of ways.
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.520]   The easiest way to sum that up,
[00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.560]   the traditional kind of three legs of the conservative stool,
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:05.400]   although now, obviously,
[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.160]   there's a very fragmented conservative movement
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.080]   in the United States,
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.120]   would be a socially conservative view
[00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:13.480]   in which family is the chief institution of society,
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:14.960]   like the little platoons of society,
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.680]   as Edmund Burke suggested,
[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:21.320]   in which free market and property rights
[00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:24.760]   are extraordinarily valuable and necessary
[00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:27.120]   because every individual has the ability
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.840]   to be creative with their property
[00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:32.920]   and to freely alienate that property.
[00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:36.640]   And finally, I tend toward a hawkish foreign policy
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:38.120]   that suggests that the world is not filled
[00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.040]   with wonderful people who all agree with us
[00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.120]   and think like us,
[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.640]   and those people will pursue adversarial interests
[00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:46.880]   if we do not protect our own interests.
[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:47.720]   - Can I ask a question on that?
[00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.800]   I'm so curious, okay. - Yeah, sure, sure.
[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:50.800]   - I'm excited for this conversation
[00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.720]   'cause I consider you to be really intelligent,
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.280]   but I feel like sometimes there are ways
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.520]   that conservatives talk about certain issues
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.520]   that seem to defy logic and reason, I guess.
[00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.640]   So, and I'm sure you feel the same way about,
[00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:04.160]   well, I feel the same way about progressives,
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:05.920]   but even some liberals, for sure.
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:07.840]   Before I ask this question,
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:09.240]   it's gonna relate to education,
[00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:13.000]   we can agree broadly speaking that statistics are real
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.800]   and that not everybody could do everything.
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.600]   So for a grounded example, my life was pretty bad.
[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:20.880]   I got into streaming and I turned my life around
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:21.920]   and that was really cool,
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:25.000]   but I can't expect everybody to do what I did, right?
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.640]   Like everybody being able to join the NBA
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:27.760]   or to be like a streamer.
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:29.360]   - Well, of course, everybody has different qualities, sure.
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:32.560]   - Okay, so I used to be a lot more libertarian
[00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:34.400]   when I was 20, 21, and one of the things
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.080]   that dramatically changed kind of my view
[00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:39.680]   on government manipulation of things in the,
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:42.600]   I guess in society, came when it came time
[00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:45.260]   to deal with my son and the school that he went to.
[00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.360]   And one of the things that I noticed was
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:48.960]   when it came time to send my son to school,
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:51.240]   I could either do private education or I could do public.
[00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:54.780]   Personally, I did 12 years of Catholic private education.
[00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:56.800]   However, the public schools in Nebraska,
[00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:59.360]   depending on where you lived, were very, very, very good.
[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:02.320]   And I opted for a certain district, I bought a house there,
[00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:03.720]   I moved there, and then my son was able
[00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:04.960]   to go to those schools.
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:06.920]   And he's been going through those schools.
[00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:10.020]   And the difference of availability of like technology,
[00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:13.280]   like these kids are taking home iPads in like first grade.
[00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:16.200]   They've got like huge computer labs and everything.
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:19.160]   Do you think that there is some type of,
[00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:20.960]   I don't wanna say injustice or unfairness,
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:22.320]   'cause I'm not even looking at it that way,
[00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:24.880]   just pragmatically, that there might be children
[00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:26.640]   that are in certain schools
[00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:28.160]   that if they just had better funding
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:31.740]   or more access to technologies or things available to them,
[00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:34.240]   that those kids would become more productive members
[00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:36.240]   of society, that with like a little bit of a help,
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:37.840]   they could actually achieve more
[00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:39.280]   and do better for all of society?
[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:41.160]   - So I think that on the list of priorities,
[00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:43.920]   when it comes to education, the availability of technology
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:46.240]   is actually fairly low on the list of priorities.
[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:48.800]   - Sure, the two things I've heard are food availability
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.680]   and I think air conditioning, I think are the two biggest
[00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:51.520]   ones that I hear, but sure.
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:53.840]   - I mean, the biggest thing in terms of education itself,
[00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:56.580]   not just the physical facilities that we're talking about,
[00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:59.920]   would actually be two parent family households.
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:00.760]   - Sure.
[00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:02.640]   - Communities that have fathers in them
[00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:03.680]   is actually the number one,
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:04.960]   decisive according to Roland Fryer
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:07.140]   and many studies done on this particular topic.
[00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:11.300]   And the idea that money alone, that investment of resources
[00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:13.760]   is the top priority in schooling is belied by the fact
[00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:15.520]   that LAUSD, which is where I went to school
[00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:18.000]   when I was younger, they pour an enormous amount of money
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.240]   into LAUSD, we're talking about tens of thousands of dollars
[00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:23.600]   very often per student, and it does not result
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:25.760]   in better schooling outcomes.
[00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:29.280]   And so when you say, if we could give every kid an iPad,
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:30.960]   would you give every kid an iPad?
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:33.520]   The question is not if I had a replicator machine
[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:34.720]   from Star Trek, would I give everybody
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:35.560]   an enormous amount of stuff?
[00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:37.920]   Sure, I would, every resource is finite,
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:40.400]   every resource is limited and you have to prioritize
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:45.400]   what are the outcomes that you seek in terms of the means
[00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:47.040]   with which you are seeking them.
[00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:50.400]   And so, again, I think that the question is,
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:52.280]   I quibble with the premise of the question,
[00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:55.480]   which is that, again, the chief injustice
[00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:58.100]   when it comes to education on the list of injustices
[00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:00.600]   is lack of availability to technology
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:01.920]   or that it's a funding problem.
[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:02.920]   I just don't think that's the case.
[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:04.880]   - Sure, and I can half agree with you there,
[00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:08.120]   but I don't think any amount of changes in the schools
[00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:10.240]   will create two-parent households, right?
[00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:11.080]   We can't bring a--
[00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:12.440]   - I totally agree with you.
[00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:14.640]   That's why I think that the fundamental educational problem
[00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:16.120]   is not, in fact, a schooling problem.
[00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:17.400]   I think that it pre-exists that.
[00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:18.920]   - Sure, but then I feel like we're,
[00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:21.720]   now I feel like this is kind of the conservative merry-go-round
[00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:24.300]   where it's like, what can we do to help with schools?
[00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:26.040]   So two of the things that I've seen, I think,
[00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:27.560]   that are usually brought up in research is,
[00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:28.680]   one is air conditioning,
[00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:30.280]   that children in hotter environments
[00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:31.560]   just don't learn as well.
[00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:34.120]   And then the second one is access to food.
[00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:36.240]   So kids that are given a breakfast or a lunch
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:38.920]   that's provided at school increases educational outcomes.
[00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:40.380]   Now, I agree that neither of these things
[00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:42.760]   might be determinative in, well,
[00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:43.960]   20% of kids are graduating
[00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:45.360]   and now 80% of kids are graduating,
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:48.280]   or these kids are all going with their GEDs
[00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:49.120]   into the workforce,
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:51.240]   and now these kids are all suddenly becoming engineers.
[00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:53.440]   But in terms of where we can help,
[00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:55.680]   do you think there should be some minimum threshold
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:58.280]   or minimum baseline of like, at the very least,
[00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:00.500]   every school should have a non-leaky gym,
[00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:02.260]   or every school should have,
[00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:03.920]   if children can't afford lunch or breakfast,
[00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:05.040]   like some sort of food provided,
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:07.440]   or every school should have these baseline things?
[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:09.280]   - So, again, I'm gonna quibble
[00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:10.260]   with the premise of the question,
[00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:11.640]   because I think that when it comes to, for example,
[00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:15.160]   food insecurity, school food programs,
[00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:17.240]   again, you can always pour money into any program
[00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:19.240]   and at the margins create change.
[00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:21.240]   I mean, there's no doubt that pouring money onto anything
[00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:23.120]   will create change in a marginal way.
[00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:24.560]   The question is how large is the margin
[00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:26.320]   and how big is the movement, right?
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:28.200]   So the delta is what I'm looking at.
[00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:29.920]   And so I think that the,
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:32.060]   you're starting at a second order question,
[00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:34.360]   which is what if we ignore what I would think
[00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:36.320]   are the big primary questions of education,
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:38.800]   namely family structure, value of education at home,
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:40.560]   how much you have parents who are capable
[00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:42.080]   or willing to help with homework.
[00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:43.400]   What are the incentive structures we can set up
[00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:45.500]   for a society that actually facilitate that?
[00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:47.800]   How local communities take ownership of their schools
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:48.760]   is a big one, right?
[00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:50.280]   All of these issues we're ignoring
[00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:52.660]   in favor of, say, air conditioning or lunch programs.
[00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:54.660]   And so in a vacuum, if you say air conditioning
[00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:56.740]   and lunch programs, sounds great in a vacuum.
[00:11:56.740 --> 00:12:00.700]   In terms of prioritization of values and cost structure,
[00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:02.960]   are those the things that I think are gonna move the needle
[00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:05.100]   in a major way in terms of public policy?
[00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:06.900]   I do not.
[00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:08.820]   And in fact, I think that many of them
[00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:11.220]   ends up being disproportionate wastes of money.
[00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:13.500]   I mean, I've talked before pretty controversially
[00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:15.260]   about the fact that an enormous amount
[00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.020]   of school lunch programs are thrown out.
[00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:18.900]   Like an enormous amount of that food
[00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:20.560]   ends up in the garbage can.
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:21.820]   Is there a better way to do that?
[00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:22.940]   If there is a better way to do it,
[00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:24.180]   then I'm perfectly willing to hear about
[00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:25.180]   that better way to do it.
[00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:26.980]   But it seems to me that one of the big flaws
[00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:30.020]   in the way that many people of the left approach government
[00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:32.280]   is what if we hit every gnat with a hammer?
[00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:36.740]   And my question is, what if the gnat isn't even the problem?
[00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:38.780]   What if there is a much bigger substructure problem
[00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:41.060]   that needs to be solved in order to,
[00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:43.180]   if you're shifting deck chairs on the Titanic,
[00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:45.620]   sure, you can make the Titanic slightly more balanced
[00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:47.860]   because the deck chairs are slightly better oriented.
[00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:49.220]   But the real question is the water
[00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:50.940]   that's gaping into the Titanic, right?
[00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:53.100]   - Yeah, and I agree with you 100%.
[00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:54.540]   But again, I feel like we're on
[00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:55.780]   the conservative merry-go-round then
[00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:57.220]   of never wanting to address--
[00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:58.420]   - I'm not a conservative merry-go-round.
[00:12:58.420 --> 00:12:59.820]   I can give you 10 ways.
[00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:01.220]   - Well, sure, but so here would be the merry-go-round.
[00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:02.860]   I would say that there is a minimum funding
[00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:04.380]   for schools that I think would help children.
[00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:05.700]   And then we go, well, the thing that would help them
[00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:06.700]   the most is two-parent households.
[00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:08.220]   Then I go, okay, well, two-parent households
[00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:09.660]   actually aren't the problem.
[00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:11.660]   The issue is access to things like birth controls,
[00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:13.500]   that people don't have children early on.
[00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:15.080]   But the issue isn't actually birth control.
[00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:17.180]   The issue is actually you need a certain amount of money
[00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:18.940]   to move out early and to get married
[00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:20.100]   and then to have a two-parent household.
[00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:21.900]   So it's actually like economic opportunity.
[00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:24.300]   - No, no, just two-parent households.
[00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:25.140]   That's it. - Yeah, but like,
[00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:26.180]   what are the precursors-- - Don't fuck people
[00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:27.020]   before you're married and have babies.
[00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:28.100]   - Sure. - Done.
[00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:28.940]   - That's great.
[00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:30.900]   We can say that and try to fight against, you know,
[00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:32.140]   however many hundreds of thousands of years
[00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:33.540]   of human evolution, but people will have sex
[00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:34.380]   and people will make babies.
[00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:35.820]   - And then they used to get married.
[00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:37.700]   The vast majority of people in this country
[00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:39.220]   with kids used to be married.
[00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:41.660]   The vast majority of people with kids in this country
[00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:43.660]   now are not married increasingly.
[00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:45.300]   That is obviously a societal change.
[00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:46.140]   Something changed. - Yeah, true.
[00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:46.980]   - It wasn't human evolution.
[00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:48.540]   - But a lot of those things in terms of resting
[00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:49.740]   on whether or not people get married
[00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:51.220]   have to do with financial decisions.
[00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:52.980]   Do you have the money-- - People are worse off now
[00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:54.140]   than they were 50, 60 years ago
[00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:54.980]   when the marriage rates were higher?
[00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:56.580]   - People are delaying the start of their careers
[00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:58.460]   because education's gonna be increasingly important.
[00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:00.860]   - So, in other words, people are richer now
[00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:02.020]   and they have more education now
[00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:03.860]   and yet they're having more babies out of wedlock now
[00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:05.300]   because they're richer and have more education?
[00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:07.820]   - I'm saying that one of the biggest indicators
[00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:09.220]   for whether or not somebody's willing to get married
[00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:10.420]   is how much money both people are making
[00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:11.780]   if they can move out of their household.
[00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:13.780]   People don't tend to wanna get married at 22
[00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:14.820]   when they've just finished college,
[00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:15.740]   when they don't have the money to move out
[00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:16.580]   and they can't afford a house.
[00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:18.100]   - Because we have changed the moral status
[00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:19.140]   of marriage in the culture,
[00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:21.380]   meaning that everyone, poor, rich, and in-between,
[00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:22.940]   used to get married.
[00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:24.300]   By the way, a huge percentage of marriages
[00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:25.260]   in the United States used to be
[00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:26.420]   what they would call shotgun marriages,
[00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:27.700]   meaning that somebody knocked somebody up
[00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:29.580]   and because they did not want the baby to be born
[00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:31.060]   outside of a two-parent household,
[00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:32.120]   they would then get married.
[00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:33.820]   - Do we think that shotgun marriages, though,
[00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:36.660]   are a way to bring back equilibrium to education?
[00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:39.340]   - Yes, yes, absolutely.
[00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:40.500]   Yes, 100%.
[00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:41.340]   - Do we think that-- - Each house deserves
[00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:42.340]   a mother and a father. - Sure.
[00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:43.180]   - Because that is the basis
[00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:44.340]   for all of this, including education.
[00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:46.580]   - Do we think that shotgun marriages are,
[00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:47.600]   well, let's say this.
[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:49.260]   Do we think that that's a reasonable direction
[00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:50.340]   that society would ever take?
[00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:51.180]   Or is this like--
[00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:52.000]   - Yes, it was the reasonable direction
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:52.840]   for nearly all of modern history.
[00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:55.180]   - It was, but history moves in one direction.
[00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:56.100]   - Right. - Why?
[00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:56.940]   - Because of time.
[00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:58.380]   - I mean, people don't think that's a,
[00:14:58.380 --> 00:14:59.220]   in what way is that?
[00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:01.740]   - As in, I don't think we've ever regressed
[00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:03.500]   social standards back to, oh, well,
[00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:05.060]   let's go 100 years back and do things
[00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:06.380]   that used to exist before.
[00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:07.220]   I think that's like-- - That's weird.
[00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:08.040]   The entire left right now is arguing
[00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:08.900]   that we regressed social standards
[00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:09.940]   by rejecting Roe versus Wade,
[00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:11.260]   so that's obviously not true.
[00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:12.780]   - The Roe versus Wade is not a social standard.
[00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:14.140]   It's a Supreme Court ruling, number one.
[00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:16.720]   Number two, if you read the actual majority opinion
[00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:18.200]   on Roe v. Wade, we can see that socially,
[00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:20.200]   we actually never made huge progress
[00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:22.080]   on how society viewed abortion.
[00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:24.420]   This has always been an incredibly divisive thing, right?
[00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:27.080]   Even, that was, I think, part of Alito's writing on it
[00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:28.580]   was that things like gay marriage, for instance,
[00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:29.640]   we've kind of moved past,
[00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:31.200]   and it's not really as debated anymore,
[00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:33.280]   but abortion was never a settled topic,
[00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:34.120]   despite Roe v. Wade's high cases.
[00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:35.440]   - The notion that the arc of history
[00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:36.680]   constantly moves in one direction
[00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:39.440]   is belied by nearly all of the 20th century.
[00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:40.480]   - What do we mean by that?
[00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:41.320]   - I mean, I mean,
[00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:42.140]   half of the 20th century-- - In terms of like,
[00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:42.980]   women's rights, civil rights--
[00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:44.920]   - Terrorism, communism, Nazism,
[00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:46.440]   all of that was a regression
[00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:47.720]   from what was happening at, for example,
[00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:49.960]   the beginning of the 19th century and the 20th century.
[00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:51.680]   - In what way?
[00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:53.120]   - Nazism and communism weren't a regression
[00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:54.640]   from what was going on in 1905.
[00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:57.040]   - Well, in terms of communism being a regression,
[00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:58.560]   for instance, I'm not a communist,
[00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:00.480]   but the industrialization of the Soviet Union
[00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:02.160]   happened under a communist society.
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:03.000]   The industrialization--
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.660]   - So the murder of tens of millions of people.
[00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:05.500]   - Yeah, there's obviously--
[00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:07.440]   - I consider that a regression, a moral regression,
[00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:09.600]   which is what we are talking about now, moral regression.
[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:11.680]   And you're suggesting that moral regression,
[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:13.780]   I wouldn't term a return to traditional values
[00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:15.300]   a moral regression, you would,
[00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:17.140]   but your suggestion is that history
[00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:18.060]   only moves in one direction.
[00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:18.980]   And I'm suggesting that history
[00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:20.500]   does not only move in one direction,
[00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:22.780]   it tends to move actually back and forth.
[00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:24.280]   - Sure, I don't think that all of history
[00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:25.660]   moves in one direction.
[00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:26.540]   There are gonna be wars,
[00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:27.700]   there are gonna be times of peace.
[00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:29.300]   I think in general, we're more peaceful now
[00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:30.420]   than we have been in the past.
[00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:31.580]   But I think when we look at the way
[00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:33.040]   that people live their lives,
[00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:35.860]   I think that we tend to move in a certain direction socially.
[00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:37.420]   So when it comes to things like racism,
[00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:39.520]   or when it comes to things like slavery or women's rights,
[00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:40.980]   I think that there are two huge things
[00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:42.300]   that probably aren't changing in the US.
[00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:43.820]   And one is access to contraception,
[00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:45.620]   and one is women working jobs.
[00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:47.460]   I think that these two things are probably huge things
[00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:49.820]   that are moving us off of shotgun marriages
[00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:51.500]   or getting married very early on.
[00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:52.340]   And I don't see those,
[00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:53.560]   do you think that those two things
[00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:54.400]   are gonna change fundamentally?
[00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:55.520]   - First of all, what the data tend to show
[00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:58.680]   is that actually more highly educated people,
[00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:00.540]   as you were saying, tend to get married more.
[00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:02.540]   So the idea is that women getting an education
[00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:05.040]   somehow throws them off marriage, it's the opposite.
[00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:06.480]   Usually it's women who are not educated
[00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:07.320]   when they're married. - But those women
[00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:08.520]   aren't getting shotgun marriages.
[00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:09.360]   Those women aren't having children
[00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:10.180]   when they're 18, 17. - Yeah, but now,
[00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:11.020]   you're shifting the topic.
[00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:13.800]   My topic was how to get more people married.
[00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:17.620]   And then you suggested that higher levels of education
[00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:19.840]   are delaying marriage and making it less probable.
[00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:21.160]   And what I'm telling you,
[00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:22.680]   because this is what the data suggests,
[00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:26.340]   is that actually as you raise up the educational ladder,
[00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:27.780]   people tend to be married more
[00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:29.520]   than they are lower down on the educational ladder.
[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:30.660]   If you're a high school graduate,
[00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:33.600]   you're less likely to be married than if you're a postdoc.
[00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:34.560]   - I agree with you,
[00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:36.200]   but that's because one of the biggest precursors
[00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:38.540]   to getting married is having a level of economic stability.
[00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:39.760]   So as people get more educated,
[00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:41.160]   they obtain this economic stability,
[00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:42.400]   and then they're in a more comfortable position
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:43.240]   to explore more serious relationships.
[00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:44.280]   - There's another confound there.
[00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:47.640]   I mean, the confound is that people in stable marriages
[00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:49.200]   tend to be the children of stable marriages,
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:50.520]   and there's only one way to break that cycle,
[00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:51.940]   which is to create a stable marriage.
[00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:54.000]   And that is something that is in everyone's hands.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.800]   Again, this notion that it is somehow an unbreakable,
[00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:59.360]   unshatterable barrier to get married and have kids,
[00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:01.360]   I don't understand where this is coming from.
[00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:03.000]   Why is that such a challenge?
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:03.840]   It's not a challenge. - I don't think it's
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:05.200]   unbreakable or unshatterable.
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:07.640]   I was just, the initial point was for school,
[00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:11.000]   if we can provide a minimum level of educational stuff
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.560]   for children, that'd probably be good.
[00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:13.920]   But when we retreat back to,
[00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:16.160]   well, it has to be the families that are fixed first,
[00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:18.680]   fixing families is a multivariate problem.
[00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:19.800]   - Matt, I am fine.
[00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:21.420]   Within my local community, we all vote.
[00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:23.000]   Again, I've suggested that there's a difference
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.640]   between local community and federal.
[00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:27.400]   I'm fine with my local community voting for school lunches
[00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:28.880]   or air conditioning or whatever it is
[00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:30.080]   that we all agree to do.
[00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:31.300]   Because the more local you get,
[00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:33.240]   the more homogeneity you get in terms of interest,
[00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:34.760]   and the more interest you have in your neighbors.
[00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:35.600]   All of that's fine.
[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:37.540]   I'm part of a very, very solid community
[00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:38.380]   in our community.
[00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:39.200]   We give to each other.
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:41.060]   We have minimum standards of helping one another.
[00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:42.120]   All of that's wonderful.
[00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:45.080]   When it comes to the actual problem of education,
[00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:47.320]   what I object to in the political sphere,
[00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:48.640]   and this happens all the time,
[00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:50.760]   is everybody is arguing on top of the iceberg
[00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:55.520]   about how we can move the needle 0.5 percentage points,
[00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:58.680]   as opposed to the entire iceberg melting beneath them.
[00:18:58.680 --> 00:18:59.520]   And we just ignore that.
[00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:00.600]   We pretend that that's just, you know,
[00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:01.920]   sort of the natural consequence of things.
[00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:03.160]   The arc of history suggests that people
[00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:04.720]   are never gonna get married again.
[00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:06.400]   Well, I mean, actually what the arc of history suggests,
[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:07.460]   realistically speaking,
[00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:08.900]   is that the people who are not getting married
[00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:10.420]   are not going to be having kids.
[00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:11.320]   And what it also suggests,
[00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:13.380]   the people who are married are going to be having kids.
[00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:15.320]   And so the demographic profile, actually over time,
[00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:17.180]   is rather going to shift toward people
[00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:18.900]   who are having lots and lots of kids.
[00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:20.660]   I'm married, I have four kids.
[00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:22.180]   Everyone in my community is married.
[00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:24.380]   It's like minimum buy-in in my community is four kids.
[00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:26.140]   Okay, and so what's happening actually,
[00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:27.580]   in terms of demographics,
[00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:29.100]   is that the people who are more religious
[00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:30.980]   and getting married are having more kids.
[00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:32.460]   And so if you're talking about the arc of history
[00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:33.300]   shifting toward marriage,
[00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:35.260]   I would suggest that actually demographically,
[00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:38.000]   over time, long periods of time, not over one generation,
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.120]   over long periods of time,
[00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:40.240]   the only cure for low birth rate
[00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:41.520]   is going to be the people who get married
[00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:42.540]   and have lots of kids.
[00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:44.840]   - Yeah, I don't necessarily disagree with any of that.
[00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:46.600]   But I'm just saying that, again,
[00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:49.600]   on the Europe side, when I bring up the term merry-go-round,
[00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:51.560]   I think that there are good conversations to be had
[00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:53.340]   about people getting married,
[00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:55.080]   because stable families produce stable children
[00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:56.080]   that are less likely to commit crime,
[00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:56.920]   that are more likely to go to school,
[00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:58.200]   that are more likely to be productive members of society,
[00:19:58.200 --> 00:19:59.040]   et cetera, et cetera.
[00:19:59.040 --> 00:19:59.920]   I'm not gonna disagree with you on any of that.
[00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:01.480]   All of that is true.
[00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:03.000]   It's just frustrating that sometimes
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.320]   when you bring up any problem,
[00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:06.200]   all of it will circle back to other things
[00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:08.440]   that makes it seem like we can't make any progress
[00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:09.900]   in any area without fixing something that's fundamental.
[00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:10.740]   - In what way?
[00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:12.200]   I mean, I literally just told you that on the local level,
[00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:13.160]   I'm fine with people voting for air conditioning.
[00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:14.580]   - Yeah, but so, for instance, on the local level,
[00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:17.580]   so for school funding, school funding is done,
[00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:19.000]   I think, generally per district.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.280]   So what do you do when you have poor districts
[00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:23.280]   that can't afford air conditioner for their schools?
[00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:26.840]   - I mean, the idea there would be that, presumably,
[00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:29.220]   if the society, meaning the state,
[00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:30.620]   and I generally don't mean the federal state,
[00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:32.360]   I mean, like the state of California, for example,
[00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:34.320]   decides that everybody ought to have air conditioning,
[00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:35.440]   people will vote for air conditioning,
[00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:36.520]   and that's perfectly legal,
[00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:38.920]   and I don't think there's anything morally objectionable
[00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:40.440]   about that, per se.
[00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:41.720]   I also don't think that that's going to heal
[00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:43.560]   anything remotely like the central problem.
[00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:45.440]   And I think that what tends to happen
[00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:47.240]   in terms of government is people love arguing
[00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:49.480]   about the problems that can be solved by opening a wallet,
[00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:53.720]   and nobody likes to solve a problem by, you know,
[00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:58.720]   closing their sex life to one person, for example,
[00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:01.240]   or having kids within a stable religious community.
[00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:03.660]   Like, the things that actually build society.
[00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:06.440]   I'm fine with arguing about each of these policies,
[00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:07.760]   and whether we apply them or not
[00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:10.720]   is a matter generally of pragmatism, not morality.
[00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:13.920]   It's a matter of incentive structures, not, per se, morality.
[00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:16.840]   Because incentive structures do have moral underpinnings.
[00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:18.440]   There's such a thing as, for example,
[00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:19.520]   if you're gonna use a welfare program,
[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:20.640]   you have to decide how effective it is,
[00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:23.260]   to what crowd it applies, where the cutoffs are,
[00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:25.560]   does it disincentivize work, does it not?
[00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:27.680]   All of these are pragmatic concerns.
[00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:29.560]   But on a moral level, the generalized objection
[00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:32.400]   that I have to people on the left side of the aisle
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:34.640]   is that they like to focus,
[00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:36.500]   in these conversations, very often it feels
[00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:39.400]   as though it's a conversation with people
[00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:42.480]   who are drunk searching under the lamp for their keys.
[00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:43.320]   The problems they wanna look at
[00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:45.080]   are the problems that are solvable by government,
[00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:46.560]   and then all the problems they don't wanna look at,
[00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:49.200]   which are the actual giant monsters lurking in the dark,
[00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:50.880]   and not particularly solvable by government,
[00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:52.480]   are the ones they want to ignore and assume
[00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:53.800]   are just the natural state of things.
[00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:54.640]   And I don't think that's correct at all.
[00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:56.280]   - Yeah, and I one billion percent agree.
[00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:57.980]   And then, obviously, my criticism for the conservative side
[00:21:57.980 --> 00:21:59.960]   is the exact opposite, where there are parts
[00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:02.200]   where government could remedy some issues.
[00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:04.360]   For instance, children having sex with each other
[00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:06.480]   and producing other children out of wedlock,
[00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:08.220]   sometimes having after-school programs
[00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:09.320]   is nice to prevent that.
[00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:11.080]   I didn't have time for these things when I was in school.
[00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:12.000]   I was doing football practice.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.100]   I was doing cross-country practice.
[00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:15.280]   I went in early for a band.
[00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:17.020]   I agree with you that sometimes people only focus
[00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:18.440]   on one end of the problem.
[00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:20.800]   I hate to be that guy, but as somebody that,
[00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:21.980]   have you ever watched "The Wire"?
[00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:22.820]   - Sure.
[00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:23.920]   - I'm not gonna cite "The Wire" as your life example,
[00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:26.360]   but obviously, there's only so much you can do in a school
[00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:29.220]   when the children coming in are so beyond destroyed
[00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:30.540]   because of the family life and everything
[00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:32.300]   prior to them even getting to school that day.
[00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:33.140]   So, I agree.
[00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:36.040]   Government is not like the solution to broken families.
[00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:36.880]   That would never be the case.
[00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:39.620]   - And it's actually not the solution to education
[00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:42.140]   depending on the kind of solutions that you're talking about.
[00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:42.980]   Some solutions, yeah.
[00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:43.820]   Some solutions, no.
[00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:45.180]   - Yeah, the only thing I'm looking at is,
[00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:47.460]   as I said earlier, just like these minimum threshold things
[00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:48.620]   where it's like, where can government make,
[00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:49.780]   'cause you mentioned marginal,
[00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:50.900]   which I think is a really good way to look at things.
[00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:53.100]   There's marginal costs and marginal utility to things
[00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:55.780]   where the first $1,000 per student you spend
[00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:57.320]   might give you a huge return,
[00:22:57.320 --> 00:22:59.020]   but the extra $20,000 after is just a waste of money.
[00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:00.300]   - Again, I think these are all pragmatic discussions.
[00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:01.140]   - Sure, of course.
[00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:02.100]   - And actually, this is what we used to hash out
[00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:04.240]   in legislatures before they turned into platforms
[00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:05.380]   for people grandstanding, but yes.
[00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:06.400]   - Sure. - Okay, yeah.
[00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:09.580]   - As we descend from the heavens of philosophical discussion
[00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:11.300]   of conservatism and liberalism,
[00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:13.820]   let's go to the pragmatic muck of politics.
[00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:16.460]   Trump versus Biden.
[00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:18.060]   Between the two of them,
[00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:21.940]   who was, in their first term, the better president?
[00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:24.700]   And thus, who should win if the two of them are,
[00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:28.180]   in fact, our choices, should win a second term in 2024?
[00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:30.520]   Ben?
[00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:34.220]   - Sure, so in terms of actual job performance,
[00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:36.620]   you have to separate it into a few categories.
[00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:39.780]   In terms of actual performance in foreign policy,
[00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:41.240]   I think Trump's foreign policy record
[00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:42.820]   is significantly better than Biden's,
[00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:44.940]   the world being on fire right now
[00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:47.120]   being a fairly good example of that.
[00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:49.780]   And we can get into each aspect of the world being on fire
[00:23:49.780 --> 00:23:51.260]   and where the incentive structures came from
[00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:52.940]   and how all of that happened in a moment.
[00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:54.140]   When it comes to the economy,
[00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:55.480]   I think that Trump's economic record
[00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:57.020]   was better than Biden's.
[00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:58.020]   Doesn't mean he didn't overspend.
[00:23:58.020 --> 00:24:00.220]   He did, he wildly overspent.
[00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:04.900]   But he also had a very solid record of job creation.
[00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:06.640]   A huge percentage of the gains in the economy
[00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:09.420]   went to people on the lower end of the economic spectrum.
[00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:13.260]   Actually, the gross income to the average American
[00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:15.460]   was about $6,000 during his term.
[00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:18.620]   The unemployment rates were very, very low before COVID.
[00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:19.780]   I think that you almost have to separate
[00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:20.620]   the Trump administration
[00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:22.020]   into sort of before COVID and during COVID,
[00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:24.340]   because COVID obviously is sort of a black swan event,
[00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:28.900]   the most signal change in politics in our lifetime.
[00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:31.940]   And so governance during COVID is almost its own category,
[00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:33.120]   which we can discuss.
[00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:34.540]   But in terms of foreign policy,
[00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:35.500]   in terms of domestic policy,
[00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:37.380]   I think that Trump was significantly better
[00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:38.540]   than Biden has been.
[00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:39.980]   And that's on the upside for Trump.
[00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:41.300]   On the downside for Biden,
[00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:42.920]   obviously you're talking 40 year highs in inflation.
[00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:44.740]   You're talking about savings being eaten away.
[00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:47.260]   You're talking about everything being 20 to 30%
[00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:48.300]   more expensive.
[00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:51.180]   You're talking about massive increases to the deficit,
[00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:53.180]   even at a rate that was unknown under Trump.
[00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:54.660]   The deficit under Trump raised
[00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:56.780]   by about a little under a trillion dollars every year
[00:24:56.780 --> 00:24:57.620]   up until 2020.
[00:24:57.620 --> 00:24:58.900]   Again, 2020 was COVID year,
[00:24:58.900 --> 00:24:59.820]   so everybody decided
[00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:01.780]   that we're gonna fire hose money at things.
[00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:04.300]   But then Joe Biden continued to fire hose money at things
[00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:06.980]   in '21, '22, and '23.
[00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:10.980]   That obviously is, in my opinion, bad economic policy.
[00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:12.580]   And then you get to the rhetoric
[00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:14.420]   and you get to the stuff that Donald Trump says.
[00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:16.460]   And as I've said before,
[00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:18.740]   my view is that on Donald Trump's epitaph,
[00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:20.180]   on his gravestone, it will say Donald Trump,
[00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:21.180]   he's had a lot of shit.
[00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:24.500]   I think that Donald Trump does say a lot of things.
[00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:26.580]   I think that that is basically baked into the cake,
[00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:28.700]   which is why everyone who's bewildered by the polls
[00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:29.980]   is ignoring human nature,
[00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:31.500]   which is at the beginning,
[00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:33.740]   when you see something very shocking, it's very shocking.
[00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:35.500]   And then if you see it over and over and over and over
[00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:37.300]   for years on end, it is no longer shocking.
[00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:39.380]   It is just part of the background noise like tinnitus.
[00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:42.540]   It just becomes something that your brain adjusts for.
[00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:45.500]   And so do I like a lot of Donald Trump's rhetoric?
[00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:46.700]   No, and I never have.
[00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:49.580]   Do I think that that is just positive as to his presidency?
[00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:50.980]   No, I do not.
[00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:52.540]   When it comes to Biden, again,
[00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:54.140]   I think he's underperforming economically.
[00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:57.700]   I think that his foreign policy has been really a problem.
[00:25:57.700 --> 00:25:59.660]   Even the things I think he's done right are,
[00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:02.980]   I think, band-aids for things that he created by doing wrong.
[00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:05.020]   And when it comes to his own rhetoric,
[00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:08.220]   you can argue that it's grating on a curve
[00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:10.980]   because Trump was coming in with such wild rhetoric
[00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:12.540]   that just a maintenance of that wild rhetoric
[00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:14.460]   doesn't really change, again, the baseline.
[00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:18.180]   For Biden, he came in in the same way that Obama did,
[00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:20.260]   on the sort of soaring rhetoric of American unity.
[00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:21.100]   I'm the president for all,
[00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:21.940]   like Trump came in and he's like,
[00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:23.500]   "Listen, I'm the president for what I am.
[00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:25.060]   "And I'm gonna say the things I wanna say.
[00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:26.380]   "I'm gonna be on the toilet and I'm tweeting."
[00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:28.340]   And we're like, "Okay, that's what it is."
[00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:29.260]   With Biden, he came in with,
[00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:30.540]   "I'm the president for all Americans.
[00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:32.060]   "I'm trying to unify everybody."
[00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:33.820]   And that pretty quickly broke down
[00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:36.220]   into a lot of oppositional language
[00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:38.420]   about his political opponents in particular,
[00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:40.460]   an attempt to lump in, for example,
[00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:42.740]   huge swaths of the conservative movement
[00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:44.940]   with the people who participated, for example,
[00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:48.220]   in January 6th or who are fans of January 6th.
[00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:51.780]   And the sort of lumping in of everybody
[00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:54.260]   into MAGA Republicans who wasn't personally signed on
[00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:56.420]   to an infrastructure bill with him.
[00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:58.380]   That sort of stuff, I think, has been truly terrible.
[00:26:58.380 --> 00:27:00.540]   I thought his Philadelphia speech was truly terrible.
[00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:02.500]   And again, I think that you do have the problem
[00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:05.620]   of he is no longer capable
[00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:08.140]   of certainly rhetorically unifying the country
[00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:10.100]   when every speech from him feels
[00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:12.060]   like watching Nick Melenda walk across a volcano
[00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:13.180]   on a tightrope.
[00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:15.500]   I mean, it really is like you're just sort of waiting
[00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:16.340]   for him to fall.
[00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:18.860]   I mean, it's sad to say, I mean, the other day,
[00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:22.780]   he was speaking for what was in effect his campaign kickoff
[00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:24.420]   and this was in Valley Forge.
[00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:27.620]   And I mean, Jill rushed up there like off the,
[00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:30.460]   as soon as he was done, Jill rushed up there,
[00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:31.940]   you know, like she'd been shot out of a cannon
[00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:33.420]   to come and try and guide him away
[00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:35.580]   so he didn't become the Shane Gillis Roomba.
[00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:39.340]   And, you know, that's not really, you know,
[00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:41.620]   let's put it this way, it does not quiet the soul
[00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:43.220]   to watch Joe Biden rhetorically.
[00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:45.060]   Again, that's a different problem than Trump's problem,
[00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:46.700]   but that's my analysis.
[00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:49.460]   - This is one of the areas where we get into this.
[00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:52.780]   I don't understand if there's like brain breaking happening
[00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:53.620]   or what's going on.
[00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:55.460]   I don't know what world we can ever live in
[00:27:55.460 --> 00:27:57.980]   where we say that Trump is less divisive
[00:27:57.980 --> 00:27:59.500]   for the country than Biden.
[00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:01.260]   I think it is so patently obvious.
[00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:02.660]   Trump is so divisive.
[00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:04.980]   Like not only does Trump make an enemy
[00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:07.020]   out of every person in the opposition party,
[00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:08.860]   he makes an enemy out of his own party
[00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:10.580]   and every single person around him.
[00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:13.260]   Like we all watched him bully, you know, Jeff Sessions.
[00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:15.180]   We all watched him bully his own party on Twitter.
[00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:18.420]   We all watched like all of these people walk away from him.
[00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:22.740]   Even recently, I think the Secretary of Defense Esper
[00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:25.660]   and John Kelly, the Chief of Staff were saying,
[00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:27.900]   I think Trump is a threat to democracy.
[00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:29.780]   You know, you've got all of his prior people
[00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:31.220]   that were around him, some of his closest allies.
[00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:33.020]   You've got Bill Barr that won't co-sign
[00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:35.100]   a single thing that he says.
[00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:37.300]   You've got all these people that he used to work with
[00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:39.860]   that all say Trump is a horrible, evil person.
[00:28:39.860 --> 00:28:40.900]   He is ineffective as a leader.
[00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:41.940]   He doesn't accomplish anything.
[00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:42.900]   And he didn't.
[00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:45.180]   You know, to say that Biden has failed at bipartisanship
[00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:46.620]   when, you know, we've gotten the CHIPS Act,
[00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:49.460]   we've gotten the IRA, we've gotten the ARP,
[00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:51.260]   we've gotten the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill,
[00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:53.060]   when we've gotten like all this major legislation
[00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:55.500]   that is working in this historically divided Congress,
[00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:58.220]   as opposed to Trump that got us tax cuts
[00:28:58.220 --> 00:28:59.260]   and deficit spending.
[00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:02.540]   I don't understand where we ever are in this world
[00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:06.020]   where Biden is somehow more divisive than Trump.
[00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:08.300]   Even the speeches that Ben is bringing up,
[00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:09.340]   they always bring up,
[00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:10.740]   I remember that one,
[00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:12.420]   I think we might've even done it on our episode.
[00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:13.700]   The one speech that Biden gave
[00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:16.060]   where at one point the background is red.
[00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:17.500]   - Yeah, the Philly speech I referenced.
[00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:18.980]   - Yeah, and they're like, "Oh my God, it's over.
[00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:19.980]   "This is the end."
[00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:21.980]   And then meanwhile, you've got Donald Trump
[00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:23.220]   coming into office saying things like,
[00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:24.140]   "If you burn the flag,
[00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:25.980]   "you should have your citizenship revoked."
[00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:29.660]   Or talking about MSDNC that I'm gonna investigate
[00:29:29.660 --> 00:29:32.500]   every single one of these media organizations
[00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:33.340]   for corruptness.
[00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:34.780]   I'm gonna open the libel and defamation laws.
[00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:36.740]   I'm gonna take all of these guys to court.
[00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:38.780]   You've got this weird Project 2025 stuff
[00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:41.860]   where, is it John Paschal, I think,
[00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:45.260]   is talking about we're gonna investigate
[00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:46.100]   all of these people
[00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:48.380]   and we're gonna try to throw crimes at all these people.
[00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:50.460]   Trump is like the most divisive president
[00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:51.700]   I think we've ever had,
[00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:56.500]   at least in my lifetime of being an American citizen.
[00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:57.860]   And the rhetoric from him is just,
[00:29:57.860 --> 00:29:59.340]   it's on a whole other level
[00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:02.020]   in terms of the demonization of political opponents.
[00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:03.180]   I mean, this is a guy that's known
[00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:06.340]   for giving his political opponents bad nicknames, right?
[00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:07.740]   Like that's what Trump does.
[00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:09.540]   You know, like it's funny,
[00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:11.780]   but even as a resident of Florida,
[00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:14.060]   if Florida had another natural disaster,
[00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:15.980]   do you think Trump would withhold aid?
[00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:18.660]   Because you had, I think that was one of the few nice things
[00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:20.300]   that DeSantis actually said about Biden was like,
[00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:22.940]   "Hey, listen, you know, when the buildings collapsed in,"
[00:30:22.940 --> 00:30:24.700]   I think that was Miami Beach. - Surfside, yeah.
[00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:26.380]   - That, you know, for the hurricane stuff
[00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:27.500]   that Biden was there.
[00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:28.660]   He was saying, "If you guys need aid,
[00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:30.140]   "however many billions, you can have it."
[00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:31.940]   Meanwhile, Trump, I think, was threatening
[00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:33.780]   to withhold federal funding from blue states
[00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:35.780]   that wouldn't, I think it had to do
[00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:37.060]   with the National Guard stuff,
[00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:38.100]   the deployment of the National Guard,
[00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:39.780]   that they weren't like doing enough for the riots,
[00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:42.340]   and Trump was threatening to withhold aid
[00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:44.700]   from some of these blue states.
[00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:46.980]   Yeah, Trump is literally the most divisive person
[00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:47.820]   in the world.
[00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:50.660]   I don't see how on any metric he is ever succeeding
[00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:52.100]   in the divisive category.
[00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:54.500]   In terms of the economy, I do think it's funny
[00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:56.060]   that Republicans are very keen to say that like,
[00:30:56.060 --> 00:30:58.860]   "Well, we can't really grade Trump, you know, post-COVID
[00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:00.340]   "because obviously COVID messed everything up,"
[00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:03.860]   which is fair, but pre-COVID, what did Trump do?
[00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:05.860]   Yeah, he did deficit spending tax cuts.
[00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:07.460]   He presided over historic low interest rates
[00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:10.580]   and an economy that was already like blazing
[00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:11.940]   past the final years of Obama.
[00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:12.940]   We were posting all-time highs
[00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:15.500]   in all the stock markets in 2013 onwards.
[00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:16.940]   You know, unemployment rates were falling.
[00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:18.980]   Now under Biden, unemployment rates are even lower
[00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:20.180]   than they were under Trump,
[00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:22.220]   but it sucks that for Trump, we can say,
[00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:23.980]   "Well, we can't really hold him accountable for 2020.
[00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:25.060]   "That was COVID."
[00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:27.300]   Well, all we have for Biden is post-COVID.
[00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:30.180]   We don't have any pre-COVID Biden, you know, economy.
[00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:31.300]   And it was the same thing for Obama too,
[00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:33.420]   coming in right after the housing collapse as well.
[00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:35.140]   And it sucks that Republicans are able
[00:31:35.140 --> 00:31:37.060]   to walk out of office, you know,
[00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:39.620]   having burned the entire American society
[00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:40.860]   to the ground economically,
[00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:42.060]   and now we've got to try to evaluate,
[00:31:42.060 --> 00:31:43.580]   "Okay, well, what did Obama do
[00:31:43.580 --> 00:31:45.500]   "during his first two to three to four years
[00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:46.820]   "just trying to recover
[00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:49.140]   "from where the housing crash left it?"
[00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:50.380]   And then we look at Biden now,
[00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:52.180]   who's trying to recover from COVID,
[00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:54.380]   and now we're grading him on a totally different scale
[00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:55.780]   than what Trump is being graded on.
[00:31:55.780 --> 00:31:57.300]   Yeah, that sucks, I think.
[00:31:57.300 --> 00:31:59.260]   - Can you comment on the foreign policy?
[00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:01.660]   - On the foreign policy, I'm gonna be honest.
[00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:06.180]   I am a, I am very liberal, I'm very not progressive.
[00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:09.300]   I'll probably come off as more hawkish than others
[00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:10.820]   because I'm not a big fan of this,
[00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:12.860]   which also, if, I mean, if Ben agrees,
[00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:15.100]   like, I think people like,
[00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:16.540]   people like Trump are gonna be
[00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:18.740]   the most dovish isolationist people ever.
[00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:21.140]   They don't wanna do anything internationally.
[00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:22.660]   They just wanna, you know, protect America,
[00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:23.860]   be at home, protect our economy,
[00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:25.500]   don't do anything internationally,
[00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:27.460]   which is why he was constantly undermining NATO
[00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:30.220]   and constantly, you know, attacking the European Union
[00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:31.580]   and, you know, cheering on the UK
[00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:33.980]   for Brexiting away from the EU.
[00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:35.780]   I think, that being said,
[00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:38.220]   I think that Biden's done a phenomenal job
[00:32:38.220 --> 00:32:39.380]   when it comes to foreign policy.
[00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:41.860]   I think that the coalition building
[00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:43.860]   was so important for Ukraine, Russia,
[00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:46.060]   and I'm so happy that he decided to go
[00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:47.980]   to our European allies and our NATO allies
[00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:50.220]   and try to build a coalition of people to help Ukraine
[00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:53.260]   so that that wasn't only the United States.
[00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:55.580]   Personally, especially after doing a whole bunch of research,
[00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:58.820]   I do tend to side with Israel over Palestine
[00:32:58.820 --> 00:33:00.820]   in a lot of the Israeli-Palestinian conflicts.
[00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:02.260]   I'm glad that Biden,
[00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:04.020]   while remaining a staunch defender of Israel,
[00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:07.140]   is trying to rein in some of the more aggressive posturing
[00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:09.380]   towards the Palestinians and the Gaza Strip.
[00:33:09.380 --> 00:33:10.780]   I'm proud that Biden said,
[00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:12.820]   "Hey, listen, we're going to delay some of these attacks.
[00:33:12.820 --> 00:33:15.420]   "Hey, listen, we are going to allow humanitarian aid here.
[00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:17.940]   "Hey, listen, we are going to try to, you know,
[00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:19.580]   "not kill as many Palestinian people down there,"
[00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:21.060]   while still, you know, signaling
[00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:25.060]   that he would be a staunch supporter of Israel
[00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:25.900]   in the conflict,
[00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:29.060]   assuming the civilian casualties don't go too high.
[00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:31.940]   For foreign policy, I mean, blemishes.
[00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:34.500]   I mean, like the biggest one you can give to Biden
[00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:36.860]   is Afghanistan and the pullout there.
[00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:39.460]   But man, are we going to talk about, you know,
[00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:40.860]   the inspector general report
[00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:41.980]   that says that one of the biggest reasons
[00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:43.860]   why the Afghanistan pullout was so disastrous
[00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:45.700]   was because of the Doha Accords,
[00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:47.420]   where Donald Trump headed talks
[00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:49.740]   that didn't even include the Afghanistan Army.
[00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:51.340]   I mean, like these were disasters.
[00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:53.140]   Like when Biden took office,
[00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:55.500]   we had 2,500 troops left in Afghanistan.
[00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:57.820]   Like what was the options even afforded to Biden
[00:33:57.820 --> 00:33:59.260]   at that point?
[00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:00.780]   Obviously, you've got the abandonment of the Kurds
[00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:01.940]   in northern Syria, you know,
[00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:04.500]   for the Turkish armies to lay waste to.
[00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:06.860]   You talk about Iran and North Korea,
[00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:09.700]   although I'm not sure where that would land on those,
[00:34:09.700 --> 00:34:11.060]   but yeah, that's a broadly-
[00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:11.900]   - That's a lot from both.
[00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:12.740]   - That's a lot, yeah.
[00:34:12.740 --> 00:34:14.980]   - You wanna pick at something we disagree with here?
[00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:16.140]   - Well, I mean, there's a lot.
[00:34:16.140 --> 00:34:18.980]   So, I mean, I wanna ask a few questions
[00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:20.140]   on each one of these. - Yeah, sure.
[00:34:20.140 --> 00:34:23.620]   - So let's talk about divisiveness for a second.
[00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:25.740]   So there's no one who can make the case
[00:34:25.740 --> 00:34:26.740]   that Donald Trump is not divisive.
[00:34:26.740 --> 00:34:27.580]   - Yeah. - Of course,
[00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:28.740]   he's incredibly divisive.
[00:34:28.740 --> 00:34:31.100]   It's a given.
[00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:33.380]   Do you treat Biden's rhetoric
[00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:34.700]   with the same level of seriousness
[00:34:34.700 --> 00:34:35.700]   that you treat Trump's rhetoric?
[00:34:35.700 --> 00:34:37.660]   Or I should probably put that to the other way around.
[00:34:37.660 --> 00:34:39.060]   Should we treat Trump's rhetoric
[00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:40.500]   with the same level of seriousness
[00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:43.660]   as Joe Biden or say Barack Obama's rhetoric?
[00:34:43.660 --> 00:34:45.020]   - I'm gonna try to be concise when I say this.
[00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:48.060]   Broadly speaking, especially in studying Israel-Palestine
[00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:48.900]   and Ukraine-Russia,
[00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:50.780]   I try not to take politicians at their word
[00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:52.460]   'cause sometimes they just say stuff to say stuff.
[00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:53.540]   I understand that.
[00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:54.580]   But broadly speaking,
[00:34:54.580 --> 00:34:56.220]   I'm gonna look at the rhetoric and the actions,
[00:34:56.220 --> 00:34:57.740]   and I am gonna grade them the same.
[00:34:57.740 --> 00:35:00.340]   So yes, I would hold Biden and Trump to the same standards.
[00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:02.220]   - Right, so my feeling is,
[00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:04.180]   and this is one area where, for clarification,
[00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:05.340]   we're gonna have a division,
[00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:07.780]   is that I, of course, don't treat Trump's rhetoric
[00:35:07.780 --> 00:35:09.780]   in the same way that I treat Biden's or Obama's.
[00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:10.900]   He's utterly uncalibrated,
[00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:12.780]   and he says whatever he wants to at any given time,
[00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:14.900]   and it doesn't even match up with his policy very often.
[00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:17.540]   - Can I ask you, like, for our head of state,
[00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:18.900]   our chief executive,
[00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:20.500]   shouldn't rhetoric be arguably
[00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:22.540]   one of the most important things that he does?
[00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:24.300]   - I mean, the answer would be yes,
[00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:26.340]   and now I've been given a choice between a person
[00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:29.300]   who I think in calibrated ways says things that are divisive
[00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:31.420]   and a person who in uncalibrated ways
[00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:33.300]   says things that are divisive.
[00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:35.940]   And so the evidence that Joe Biden is divisive
[00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:40.620]   is every poll taken since essentially August of 2021.
[00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:45.340]   He is, by all available metrics, incredibly divisive.
[00:35:45.340 --> 00:35:47.820]   A huge percentage of Americans are deeply unhappy,
[00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:49.540]   not only with his performance,
[00:35:49.540 --> 00:35:51.660]   but don't believe he's a uniter.
[00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:52.580]   That's just the reality.
[00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:53.660]   And that may just be a reflection.
[00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:55.340]   I mean, honestly, we may be putting too much on Trump
[00:35:55.340 --> 00:35:56.180]   or Biden personally.
[00:35:56.180 --> 00:35:57.980]   It may just be that the American people themselves
[00:35:57.980 --> 00:36:00.020]   are rhetorically divided because of social media,
[00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:03.340]   and social media can in fact be assessable, and all that.
[00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:05.340]   - One thing that I would ask you about that, though,
[00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:07.700]   is I agree, especially when you look at the favorability,
[00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:09.900]   but sometimes when I look at these polls,
[00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:11.820]   when you start to disaggregate them by party,
[00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:15.660]   I wonder if it's actually, is Biden historically divisive,
[00:36:15.660 --> 00:36:18.340]   or I'm trying to think of a really polite way to say this,
[00:36:18.340 --> 00:36:20.860]   the people that like Trump worship Trump.
[00:36:20.860 --> 00:36:21.860]   I don't know.
[00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:22.820]   One of the most prescient things
[00:36:22.820 --> 00:36:24.260]   that Trump could have probably ever said
[00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:25.780]   was that I could kill someone on Fifth Street
[00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:26.980]   and nobody would hold me accountable.
[00:36:26.980 --> 00:36:28.900]   So is it really that Biden is historically divisive,
[00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:30.420]   or is it that every single Trump supporter
[00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:31.820]   will always say that Trump is great
[00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:32.660]   and always say that Biden is bad?
[00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:33.900]   - No, the reason I would say that Biden
[00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:35.260]   is in fact historically divisive
[00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:37.180]   is because Republicans felt much more strongly
[00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:40.580]   about Barack Obama than Joe Biden, actually.
[00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:41.780]   - But they didn't feel as strongly about Trump
[00:36:41.780 --> 00:36:44.140]   as they did about Romney or McCain, right?
[00:36:44.140 --> 00:36:44.980]   - In what way?
[00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:46.900]   - I mean, the allegiance to Trump.
[00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:48.340]   - Oh, no, there's certainly more allegiance to Trump
[00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:49.340]   than there is to Romney or McCain,
[00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:51.100]   largely because Trump won in 2016.
[00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:53.980]   But beyond that, the point that I'm making
[00:36:53.980 --> 00:36:56.380]   is that if you're looking at the stats
[00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:57.700]   in terms of divisiveness,
[00:36:57.700 --> 00:36:59.780]   Republicans always find the Democratic president divisive.
[00:36:59.780 --> 00:37:01.740]   The question is where the rest of the country is.
[00:37:01.740 --> 00:37:03.780]   And right now, there are a lot of Democrats
[00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:06.540]   who either don't agree with Biden or find him divisive.
[00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:08.300]   There are a lot of independents who find him divisive.
[00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:10.300]   So when we're comparing these things,
[00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:11.540]   I don't think they're leagues apart
[00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:14.220]   in terms of the divisive effect of what they say.
[00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:16.060]   Right, and I'm separating that off
[00:37:16.060 --> 00:37:17.340]   from the inherent content of what they say,
[00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:19.300]   'cause obviously what Trump says is more divisive,
[00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:20.380]   just on the raw level.
[00:37:20.380 --> 00:37:21.540]   I mean, if he's insulting people
[00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:24.180]   as opposed to Joe Biden doing MAGA Republicans,
[00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:25.100]   like if I were to just,
[00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:26.660]   if I were an alien and come down from space
[00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:27.500]   and look at these two statements,
[00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:29.380]   I'd say this one's more divisive than this one.
[00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:30.820]   But then there's the reality
[00:37:30.820 --> 00:37:32.020]   of being a human being in the world,
[00:37:32.020 --> 00:37:34.700]   and that is everyone has baked Donald Trump into the cake.
[00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:37.460]   And Joe Biden, again, started off
[00:37:37.460 --> 00:37:40.180]   with a patina of being non-divisive
[00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:42.020]   and now has emerged as divisive.
[00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:42.860]   If you don't mind,
[00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:44.220]   I actually wanna get to the foreign policy questions,
[00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:45.060]   'cause this one is actually
[00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:45.900]   slightly less interesting to me.
[00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:46.980]   - Sure, well, can I-- - You're free to answer.
[00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:48.700]   - Yeah, just one quick thing, I guess.
[00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:50.020]   'Cause we can say the reality of it
[00:37:50.020 --> 00:37:51.380]   and we can look at opinion polls.
[00:37:51.380 --> 00:37:53.580]   What if we look at legislative accomplishments?
[00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:56.340]   Like Biden is working on a 50-50 divided Senate.
[00:37:56.340 --> 00:37:58.580]   Donald Trump had both House of Congress
[00:37:58.580 --> 00:37:59.860]   and the Supreme Court
[00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:01.940]   and got no major legislation passed.
[00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:05.580]   - Well, I mean, he did lose Congress in 2018, but--
[00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:07.340]   - Sure, but prior to that.
[00:38:07.340 --> 00:38:09.380]   We got the infrastructure bill, I think, in one year,
[00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:11.380]   which Trump promised for his entire presidency,
[00:38:11.380 --> 00:38:12.220]   didn't get anywhere on it.
[00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:13.980]   - Well, I mean, yes, his Republican base
[00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:16.180]   was not in favor of mass spending on infrastructure
[00:38:16.180 --> 00:38:17.060]   and neither am I.
[00:38:17.060 --> 00:38:17.900]   So there's that.
[00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:19.060]   I think that's mostly a state and local issue.
[00:38:19.060 --> 00:38:21.060]   - But they were in favor of mass spending for tax cuts?
[00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:21.900]   - That's not a spending.
[00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:22.740]   I mean, we--
[00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:24.500]   - I mean, effectively, it is, right?
[00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:25.500]   - Effectively, it's not.
[00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:27.140]   - Well, if you're cutting tax receipts,
[00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:28.860]   but you're not changing the level of spending,
[00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:30.660]   like Biden did with the IRA--
[00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:33.100]   - Again, we have a fundamental philosophical difference here.
[00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:35.020]   I think that when the government takes my money,
[00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:37.940]   that is not the government
[00:38:37.940 --> 00:38:39.660]   somehow being more fiscally responsible.
[00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:41.340]   And when the government allows me to keep my money,
[00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:42.660]   I don't see that as the government spending.
[00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:43.940]   I see that as my money
[00:38:43.940 --> 00:38:45.180]   and the government is taking less of it.
[00:38:45.180 --> 00:38:46.140]   - That's great, but at the end of the day,
[00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:48.020]   the government is still gonna be in a deficit spending
[00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:49.060]   and they're gonna have to borrow money from the treasury.
[00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:50.020]   - Right, we have a spending problem.
[00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:51.060]   In other words, it's not a receipts problem,
[00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:52.100]   is the case that I'm making.
[00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:54.300]   The problem with Donald Trump is not that he lowered taxes.
[00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:55.540]   The United States has one of the most progressive
[00:38:55.540 --> 00:38:56.700]   tax systems on the planet.
[00:38:56.700 --> 00:38:58.940]   And in fact, if you wish to have a European-style
[00:38:58.940 --> 00:38:59.780]   social welfare state,
[00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:02.220]   what you actually need is to tax the middle class to death.
[00:39:02.220 --> 00:39:04.380]   I mean, the reality is that the top 20%
[00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:07.100]   of the American population pays literally all net taxes
[00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:09.900]   in the United States after state benefits and all of this.
[00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:11.900]   So if you actually wanted to have
[00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:13.060]   the kind of social welfare state
[00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:14.620]   that many liberals seem to want to have,
[00:39:14.620 --> 00:39:16.140]   like Northern Europe, for example,
[00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:18.940]   you'd actually have to tax people who make 40, 50, $60,000.
[00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:20.140]   - And I don't want that, I agree with that.
[00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:22.300]   So how do you explain the lack of legislation?
[00:39:22.300 --> 00:39:23.980]   I mean, if he's like such a uniter.
[00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:25.660]   - Because I think the Republican Party itself
[00:39:25.660 --> 00:39:26.500]   is quite divided.
[00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:27.340]   And I think that Trump's-
[00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:28.160]   - But isn't that his job?
[00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:29.580]   He's the head of the Republican Party.
[00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:30.420]   He's the president,
[00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:31.580]   Republican president of the United States.
[00:39:31.580 --> 00:39:32.860]   - I mean, again, I don't think that Joe Biden
[00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:35.980]   has passed wildly historic legislation.
[00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:37.820]   - The infrastructure bill was the largest like-
[00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:38.660]   - So here's the problem.
[00:39:38.660 --> 00:39:40.020]   If you're a Republican,
[00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:42.020]   the only bills that you can get consensus on
[00:39:42.020 --> 00:39:44.180]   tend to be bills that either,
[00:39:44.180 --> 00:39:46.540]   let's be real about this,
[00:39:46.540 --> 00:39:49.020]   that are tax cuts because,
[00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:52.300]   as you would, I think, agree with,
[00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:53.260]   when it comes to polling data,
[00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:54.980]   Americans constantly say they want to cut the government.
[00:39:54.980 --> 00:39:56.540]   And then the minute you ask them which program,
[00:39:56.540 --> 00:39:57.380]   they have no idea what they're-
[00:39:57.380 --> 00:39:58.200]   - They don't want to cut anything.
[00:39:58.200 --> 00:39:59.040]   - Right, exactly.
[00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:01.780]   It's much harder to come up with a bill to cut things
[00:40:01.780 --> 00:40:04.140]   than it is to come up with a bill to add things,
[00:40:04.140 --> 00:40:07.020]   which is why spending was out of control under Trump as well.
[00:40:07.020 --> 00:40:07.900]   But there are some Republicans
[00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:09.260]   who still don't want to spend on those things, right?
[00:40:09.260 --> 00:40:11.900]   So inherently, the task that,
[00:40:11.900 --> 00:40:12.940]   this goes back to the first question,
[00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:15.620]   the task that Republicans think government is there to do
[00:40:15.620 --> 00:40:17.820]   is different than the task that Democrats think
[00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:19.020]   that government is there to do.
[00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:20.900]   So the way that the very metric of success
[00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:23.340]   for a Democratic president versus a Republican president,
[00:40:23.340 --> 00:40:25.780]   namely, for example, pieces of legislation passed,
[00:40:25.780 --> 00:40:27.100]   as a Republican, one of my goals
[00:40:27.100 --> 00:40:28.460]   is to pass nearly no legislation
[00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:30.860]   because I don't actually want the government involved
[00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:32.660]   in more areas of our life.
[00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:34.580]   I want to ask a couple of questions on the foreign policy.
[00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:36.100]   - Sure, yeah, okay, wait, real quick.
[00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:38.740]   So for instance, like Donald Trump wanted to punish China
[00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:41.100]   and he wanted to bring a microprocessor manufacturer
[00:40:41.100 --> 00:40:42.220]   to the United States.
[00:40:42.220 --> 00:40:44.260]   Biden did that with legislation, with the CHIPS Act.
[00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:46.220]   You talk about spending being out of control
[00:40:46.220 --> 00:40:47.620]   and I mean, I can agree with that.
[00:40:47.620 --> 00:40:48.580]   I think anybody that looks at the numbers
[00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:50.420]   has to agree with that, but why not pass legislation
[00:40:50.420 --> 00:40:52.380]   like the Inflation Reduction Act,
[00:40:52.380 --> 00:40:54.660]   which is at least spending neutral, right?
[00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:56.380]   Why are there not bills where Donald Trump could take--
[00:40:56.380 --> 00:40:57.220]   - Well, I mean, first of all,
[00:40:57.220 --> 00:40:58.060]   I think that whenever the government
[00:40:58.060 --> 00:40:58.940]   says something is spending neutral,
[00:40:58.940 --> 00:41:00.420]   it rarely materializes that way.
[00:41:00.420 --> 00:41:01.780]   That is not going to be a spending neutral bill.
[00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:03.100]   - Sure, but there's a difference between
[00:41:03.100 --> 00:41:04.620]   at least they say it's spending neutral
[00:41:04.620 --> 00:41:07.880]   versus this is a $500 billion bill over 10 years, right?
[00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:09.780]   - Well, but again, I don't see a tax cut
[00:41:09.780 --> 00:41:11.380]   as a matter of quote-unquote spending neutrality.
[00:41:11.380 --> 00:41:12.540]   The big problem is they keep spending,
[00:41:12.540 --> 00:41:14.340]   not that they are allowing me to keep the money
[00:41:14.340 --> 00:41:15.820]   that I earned and they did not earn, but--
[00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:16.900]   - Okay, so then just to understand,
[00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:20.460]   so if somebody just did massive reductions in tax receipts,
[00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:21.900]   so tax cut after tax cut after tax cut,
[00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:23.620]   but they didn't change spending at all,
[00:41:23.620 --> 00:41:26.180]   you wouldn't consider that an increase in deficit spending
[00:41:26.180 --> 00:41:27.180]   or out of control spending?
[00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:28.980]   You would just say they're just tax cuts?
[00:41:28.980 --> 00:41:29.820]   - No, the opposite.
[00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:33.500]   I would consider it a wild overspending.
[00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:35.300]   - Okay, so then was it under Trump then
[00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:36.140]   when he did the tax 2017?
[00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:37.960]   - Yeah, the deficit spending by the way under Biden
[00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:38.800]   is way worse than it was under Trump.
[00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:41.520]   - Of course, but we're in post-COVID, right?
[00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:43.400]   - COVID ended effectively, I mean, you live in Florida.
[00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:45.120]   COVID effectively ended in the state of Florida
[00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:46.320]   by the middle of 2021.
[00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:47.160]   - Yeah.
[00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:48.080]   - I mean, even if you're a vaccine fan,
[00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:49.680]   by like April, May of 2021,
[00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:51.920]   there was wide availability of vaccines,
[00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:53.080]   whether or not you liked the vaccines.
[00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:53.920]   - Yeah.
[00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:55.120]   - And at that point, we were done.
[00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:56.760]   - I agree, but like we're in a post,
[00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:58.840]   like how many trillions of dollars
[00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:00.080]   have been dumped in worldwide
[00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:01.680]   that are like leading to inflation, right?
[00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:04.000]   The inflation is like a worldwide issue right now
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:05.720]   because of the economy shutting down for a year or two.
[00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:08.040]   It's not like those effects are gone in one year, right?
[00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:08.880]   COVID might be gone,
[00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:10.640]   but the after effects of all the stimulus spending
[00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:11.480]   and the unemployment and everything else.
[00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:12.480]   - But the definition of inflation
[00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:14.000]   is too much money chasing too few goods.
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:15.400]   So pouring more money on top of that
[00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:16.600]   makes for more inflation.
[00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:17.440]   That's what it does.
[00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:19.160]   - Sure, I agree.
[00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:20.640]   But like there's also the definition
[00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:21.800]   of when do you deficit spend
[00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:23.400]   is when economies are headed for recessions, right?
[00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:24.780]   Rather than when economies are doing really well,
[00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:26.640]   like they were under Trump and he was deficit spending.
[00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:28.080]   Whereas Biden can at least make the argument
[00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:29.480]   that I should, I ought to be deficit spending
[00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:30.320]   because the economy is headed
[00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:31.440]   for potential recession, right?
[00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:32.280]   - So here's the thing.
[00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:33.120]   I don't think that the economy
[00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:34.720]   is actually headed for a session.
[00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:37.000]   In fact, if you look at the economic statistics.
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:38.360]   - Every economist said it was.
[00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:39.200]   - No, okay.
[00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:40.020]   - They're still saying
[00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:40.860]   that there's like a recession coming, right?
[00:42:40.860 --> 00:42:41.700]   - Right, but that was largely
[00:42:41.700 --> 00:42:43.240]   because of the after effects of inflation.
[00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:44.900]   Meaning if you inflate the economy,
[00:42:44.900 --> 00:42:46.920]   what you're going to end up doing is bursting a bubble.
[00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:48.520]   And then when that bubble bursts, you'll get a recession.
[00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:49.720]   I mean, that was the basic idea, right?
[00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:50.720]   The idea, the question was
[00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:52.080]   whether you're gonna get a soft landing.
[00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:53.800]   But if you actually look at, for example,
[00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:54.800]   the employment statistics
[00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:56.520]   or the economic growth statistics in the United States,
[00:42:56.520 --> 00:42:58.720]   what they look like under the last year's Obama
[00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:00.240]   and then Trump, I mean, this is what the chart looks like,
[00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:01.080]   is it looks like this.
[00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:04.040]   And then it hits March of 2020, it goes like that, right?
[00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:06.400]   And then by like September, it bounces back up, right?
[00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:07.480]   It's a V-shaped recovery.
[00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:08.980]   And then it starts to peter out.
[00:43:08.980 --> 00:43:10.960]   - Sure, a lot because of the American recovery plan, right?
[00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:12.280]   That Biden did as well.
[00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:14.160]   - I mean-
[00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:14.980]   - 4 million jobs, yeah.
[00:43:14.980 --> 00:43:16.280]   - No, I'm not gonna attribute it to that
[00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:18.880]   because the rates of growth in job growth
[00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:20.120]   from September, October, November,
[00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:22.400]   were actually very similar to the rates of job growth
[00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:24.480]   after Joe Biden took office.
[00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:26.000]   What you see is actually kind of a straight line.
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.520]   I mean, what the chart looks like, in any case.
[00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:30.120]   Okay, so on the foreign policy stuff,
[00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:33.560]   this is getting abstruse, but on the foreign policy stuff.
[00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:36.600]   So the questions that I have
[00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:38.640]   with regard to Biden on foreign policy,
[00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:42.240]   very, very simple question.
[00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:44.200]   Do you think that the situation in the Middle East
[00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:47.160]   is better now than it was under Donald Trump?
[00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:55.080]   - Probably, that's a hard one.
[00:43:55.080 --> 00:43:58.420]   The factors that I'm making right now are,
[00:43:58.420 --> 00:44:00.880]   like, obviously you've got the Israel-Palestinian war
[00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:02.600]   that's going on right now, which is kind of bad,
[00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:04.020]   but like broadly speaking,
[00:44:04.020 --> 00:44:05.600]   I'm not sure how much that affects the Middle East
[00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:07.400]   as much as like the collapse of Syria.
[00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:11.000]   2013 Syrian civil war sent millions of immigrants
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:12.160]   throughout all of Europe.
[00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:13.640]   - Which was under?
[00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:15.600]   - Which was under Obama and continued under Trump.
[00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:17.080]   Trump didn't do anything to alleviate
[00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:18.480]   any of the Syrian civil war.
[00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:22.760]   - Why did Syria end up as a preserve of Russia again?
[00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:24.520]   - How did Syria end up as a preserve of Russia?
[00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:26.020]   - Yes, why did it end up being essentially
[00:44:26.020 --> 00:44:28.080]   a client state of Russia?
[00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:31.540]   I know that Putin enjoys access to the ports down there.
[00:44:31.540 --> 00:44:32.380]   I don't know.
[00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:34.160]   - I mean, the reason is because Barack Obama suggested
[00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:35.640]   that there was a red line that would be drawn
[00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:36.880]   in the face of chemical weapons use.
[00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:39.400]   Bashar al-Assad then used chemical weapons in Syria
[00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:41.920]   and Barack Obama was unwilling to then
[00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:44.980]   essentially create consequences for Syria
[00:44:44.980 --> 00:44:46.480]   in the form of any sort of Western strike.
[00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:48.000]   And so instead he outsourced it to Russia.
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:49.640]   This is 2013, 2014.
[00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:51.140]   - Sure, do you think there might've been some hesitancy
[00:44:51.140 --> 00:44:52.920]   after like seeing how Libya ended up
[00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:54.640]   that maybe us like intervening?
[00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:56.600]   - Who was president during Libya?
[00:44:56.600 --> 00:44:57.960]   - Yeah, I mean, like I said.
[00:44:57.960 --> 00:44:59.880]   - Sure, but what does that have to do with anything though?
[00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:01.040]   There might've been like a mistake learned.
[00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:02.000]   - The point that I'm making is that actually
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   the Middle East, I mean, just historically speaking,
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.040]   was historically good under Donald Trump.
[00:45:06.040 --> 00:45:07.720]   I mean, it's very difficult to make the case
[00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:09.420]   that either before or after Trump
[00:45:09.420 --> 00:45:10.880]   were better than during Donald Trump.
[00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:13.720]   - I mean, the Syrian, I don't think that Trump
[00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:17.240]   contributed to the Syrian situation in improving much.
[00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:19.520]   - I mean, he wrecked ISIS, which was in the-
[00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:21.800]   - I mean, ISIS had been getting wrecked by the Kurds
[00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:25.000]   in Iraq, by every single person, by Assad's army,
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:26.920]   by Putin, by Turkey, literally everybody
[00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:29.080]   was fighting against ISIS at that point.
[00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:29.960]   - There's a spike in violence.
[00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:32.440]   And then the Trump, I mean, you get credit
[00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:34.120]   for when you're president, presumably.
[00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:36.880]   I mean, things got better with ISIS under Trump.
[00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:37.720]   - I mean, yeah, they did.
[00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:38.560]   I mean- - Things got worse
[00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:40.320]   with ISIS under Obama.
[00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:41.160]   - For sure. - He called them
[00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:42.320]   the JV squad. - Sure.
[00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:43.920]   - And then they became not the JV squad.
[00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:47.400]   - Yeah, but I don't know if ISIS is originating in Syria
[00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:49.640]   and Baghdadi and all of the growth of that
[00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:51.280]   is necessarily Obama's fault.
[00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:53.640]   I know that we like to say that Obama created ISIS.
[00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:54.480]   I don't know if you say that,
[00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:55.480]   I've heard that saying a lot.
[00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:57.640]   I think that's a little bit simplistic.
[00:45:57.640 --> 00:45:58.680]   I don't think that- - Sure.
[00:45:58.680 --> 00:46:01.760]   - When I'm looking at actions that presidents have taken,
[00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:03.960]   the biggest criticism I have for Middle Eastern policy
[00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:05.880]   is I think the Doha Accords were a disaster.
[00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:07.440]   And I think that's one of the biggest blemishes
[00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:08.480]   that we have right now.
[00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:11.360]   I would also argue that moving the embassy to Jerusalem
[00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:14.240]   was also kind of silly and arguably contributed
[00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:15.640]   to some of the conflict we see right now
[00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:16.480]   between Israel and Palestine. - No, exactly.
[00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:17.920]   I'll argue precisely the opposite,
[00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:18.760]   especially given the fact
[00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:21.000]   that after the movement of the embassy to Jerusalem,
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:23.560]   the Abraham Accords continued to sign and actually expand.
[00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:25.600]   And that if Donald Trump had been elected,
[00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:27.560]   I have no doubt in my mind that Saudi Arabia
[00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:29.520]   would now be a part of the Abraham Accords.
[00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:31.600]   In fact, that was basically pre-negotiated.
[00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:33.400]   And then when Joe Biden took office,
[00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:35.360]   Joe Biden took a very anti-Saudi stance
[00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:36.920]   on a wide variety of issues.
[00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:39.320]   The biggest single effect in the Middle East
[00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:41.080]   of Joe Biden's presidency, and again,
[00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:42.840]   I agree with you that not every foreign policy issue
[00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:44.880]   can be laid at the hands of a president.
[00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:46.840]   Joe Biden's main approach to the Middle East
[00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:48.400]   was very similar to the Obama approach,
[00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:50.000]   which is why the Middle East was chaotic under Obama
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:51.080]   and chaotic under Biden.
[00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:55.800]   And that was to alienate allies like Saudi Arabia and Israel
[00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:59.400]   and instead to try to make common cause
[00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:00.800]   or cut deals with Iran.
[00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:02.880]   What that did is incentivize terrorism from Iran.
[00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:03.840]   What we're watching in the Middle East
[00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:06.680]   is Iran attempting to use every one of its terror proxies
[00:47:06.680 --> 00:47:07.520]   in the Middle East.
[00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:10.400]   And it was specifically launched in an attempt to avoid
[00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:12.280]   what Biden actually was trying to do, which was good,
[00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:14.920]   which was after two years of failure with Saudi Arabia,
[00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:16.440]   try to bring them into the Abraham Accords, right?
[00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:19.240]   That was what was burgeoning at the end of last year.
[00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:21.440]   And Iran saw that, and Iran decided
[00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:22.680]   that they were going to throw a grenade
[00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:24.360]   into the middle of those negotiations
[00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:25.760]   by essentially activating Hamas.
[00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:27.720]   Hamas activates, Hamas commits October 7th.
[00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:30.080]   Israel as a sovereign nation state has to respond
[00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:31.480]   to the murder of 1,200 of its citizens
[00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:33.840]   and the taken kidnapping of 240.
[00:47:33.840 --> 00:47:36.440]   Israel has to do that not only to go after its own hostages
[00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:37.280]   and try to restore them,
[00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:39.200]   but also to reestablish military deterrence
[00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:40.920]   in the most violent region of the world.
[00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:43.360]   Hezbollah gets active on Israel's northern border.
[00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:45.240]   Hezbollah is an Iranian proxy.
[00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:47.400]   They get active on the northern border.
[00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:49.800]   The Houthis in Yemen get active.
[00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:51.440]   These are all, the only reason all this is happening
[00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:53.760]   at the same time is because Iran is doing this, right?
[00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:56.200]   Not just that, they are threatening global shipping.
[00:47:56.200 --> 00:47:57.920]   If you're talking about the effects of global supply lines,
[00:47:57.920 --> 00:48:00.520]   which I totally agree had a major inflationary effect
[00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:02.320]   on the economy thanks to COVID,
[00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:05.720]   right now, the cost of shipping is nearly double
[00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:07.320]   what it was just a few weeks ago,
[00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:10.620]   and that is because a ragtag group of Houthi barbarians
[00:48:10.620 --> 00:48:12.040]   are attacking international shipping
[00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:13.480]   and forcing everybody to stop using
[00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:14.440]   the Bab el-Mandeb's freight,
[00:48:14.440 --> 00:48:18.000]   instead of going around the Cape of Good Hope in Africa.
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:19.640]   All of that is the result of the fact
[00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:21.600]   that Joe Biden reoriented the United States
[00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:23.060]   in the very early days,
[00:48:23.060 --> 00:48:24.800]   in favor of a more pro-Iranian stance.
[00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:26.660]   He appointed Robert Malley to negotiate the Iran deal,
[00:48:26.660 --> 00:48:29.240]   who, as it turns out, was using proxies.
[00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:32.400]   Many of his aides were actually taking money from Iran.
[00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:34.780]   The Biden administration, literally one of their first acts,
[00:48:34.780 --> 00:48:37.080]   was to delist the Houthis as a terror organization
[00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:39.640]   and end sanctions against the Houthis.
[00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:41.920]   These are all moves that Biden made very early on.
[00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:42.760]   They were disastrous moves,
[00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:44.560]   but when it comes to domestic policy,
[00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:45.840]   I think he hasn't been nearly as damaging
[00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:47.280]   in domestic policy as he has been on foreign policy.
[00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:48.120]   - Sure, sure.
[00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:49.000]   So just on a couple of Middle Eastern things.
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:50.520]   So one of the big things that threw the Middle East
[00:48:50.520 --> 00:48:54.160]   into disaster was, we are all traumatized by it now,
[00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:55.880]   was the Iraq invasion, which happened
[00:48:55.880 --> 00:48:56.960]   under a Republican president.
[00:48:56.960 --> 00:48:57.780]   - Sure. - You agree with that, right?
[00:48:57.780 --> 00:48:59.480]   - Sure. - The deposition
[00:48:59.480 --> 00:49:01.880]   of Saddam Hussein and everything that followed after
[00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:03.640]   probably contributed more to the growth of ISIS
[00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:05.640]   and the destabilization of that entire region,
[00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:06.640]   probably more than anything else.
[00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:09.080]   I think that under, prior to Bush,
[00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:10.120]   for Clinton, and even at the beginning
[00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:12.360]   of Bush's presidency, we were on some kind of road
[00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:15.160]   to normalcy with Iran, which I think has to happen,
[00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:17.080]   whether we like them or not,
[00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:18.760]   until Bush, for whatever reason,
[00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:20.800]   decides to throw Iran into the axis of evil.
[00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:22.000]   - It needs some evidence that we're on a road
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:23.680]   to normalcy with Iran in the 1990s.
[00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:25.080]   - We do in the, wait, what?
[00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:27.680]   - That we're on a road to normalcy with Iran in the 1990s.
[00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:30.040]   - My understanding is that, yeah, from the late '90s
[00:49:30.040 --> 00:49:33.080]   and prior to the axis of evil labeling of Iran,
[00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:34.760]   that there was gonna be some path forward
[00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:36.800]   to where we could start to normalize relationships with them.
[00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:38.840]   - I find that very difficult to believe,
[00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:39.960]   and I don't see a lot of evidence.
[00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:40.920]   I mean, we can just disagree on that.
[00:49:40.920 --> 00:49:42.280]   - Sure, okay, yeah, sure, we can disagree on that,
[00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:44.360]   but I know that, by the way, the aftereffects,
[00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:46.160]   just a quick note, the after effect of the Iraq war
[00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:47.120]   that was the most devastating
[00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:48.840]   was the increase in power of Iran.
[00:49:48.840 --> 00:49:50.880]   - I agree, yeah, because of the destabilization of Iraq,
[00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:53.540]   and Iraq not having a government there
[00:49:53.540 --> 00:49:55.800]   that was functional for at least a decade.
[00:49:55.800 --> 00:49:57.120]   - And was, in fact, a Sunni government, right?
[00:49:57.120 --> 00:49:58.600]   Originally, it was a Sunni government.
[00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:00.640]   Disbanding the Sunni army was one of the worst things
[00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:01.480]   that the Bush administration did.
[00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:02.800]   - Probably, yeah, banning all the former Ba'ath parties,
[00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:04.360]   all the military, yeah, all horrible,
[00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:05.880]   under a Republican president.
[00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:07.200]   - Don't disagree.
[00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:10.080]   - Yeah, that that probably contributed more to ISIS,
[00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:11.240]   to the growth of power in Iran,
[00:50:11.240 --> 00:50:13.440]   maybe even to the destabilization of Syria,
[00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:16.000]   probably more than anything that Obama did.
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:19.560]   Also, when we look at Iran funding people in the region,
[00:50:19.560 --> 00:50:20.700]   I don't disagree with that as well.
[00:50:20.700 --> 00:50:22.220]   I think Iran is the number one instigator
[00:50:22.220 --> 00:50:24.000]   of bad guy things right now in the Middle East.
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:25.840]   Iran, the IRGC, I supported
[00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:27.080]   when Donald Trump killed Soleimani.
[00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:28.640]   I think that was a great thing.
[00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:30.600]   I think that Iran is a major problem.
[00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:33.640]   However, I don't know if the path forward
[00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:36.160]   is constantly being a belligerent to Iran
[00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:38.180]   or trying to figure out some road to normalcy.
[00:50:38.180 --> 00:50:40.340]   I don't know if the collapse of Iran
[00:50:40.340 --> 00:50:41.640]   or the destruction of that country,
[00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:44.720]   considering how unpopular the Ayatollah even is there,
[00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:45.720]   like the citizens of Iran,
[00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:47.980]   I don't think are big supporters of the government there.
[00:50:47.980 --> 00:50:50.040]   I feel like moving on a path where,
[00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:51.300]   let's do our nuclear inspections.
[00:50:51.300 --> 00:50:54.200]   We had that Iranian nuclear deal that Trump pulled out of.
[00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:55.360]   Let's do the nuclear inspections.
[00:50:55.360 --> 00:50:56.800]   Make sure you're not on the way to nuclear weapons.
[00:50:56.800 --> 00:50:57.900]   Let's unfreeze some funds.
[00:50:57.900 --> 00:50:59.080]   Let's move in some direction
[00:50:59.080 --> 00:51:00.720]   where we get on a good term with you.
[00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:02.600]   I feel like that's the most important thing
[00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:03.900]   that needs to happen in the Middle East.
[00:51:03.900 --> 00:51:05.760]   As much as people like to look at the Abraham Accords,
[00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:09.760]   who cares if, what was it, Bahrain, I think Oman,
[00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:10.680]   I think Sudan. - UAE and Morocco.
[00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:12.760]   - The UAE and Morocco, yeah.
[00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:14.480]   All of these people, even Saudi Arabia,
[00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:16.900]   already have de facto normalization with Israel anyway.
[00:51:16.900 --> 00:51:17.740]   They're all trading.
[00:51:17.740 --> 00:51:20.000]   - No, this is, I mean, to pretend that anybody,
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:22.400]   even 15 years ago, would have been talking
[00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:25.360]   about normalization, Saudi Arabia and Israel is insane.
[00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:26.320]   I mean, that's insane.
[00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:28.280]   - They were already on that path.
[00:51:28.280 --> 00:51:29.120]   They had already been trading.
[00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:32.320]   They were already de facto trading partners with each other.
[00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:34.040]   They had already been collaborating and doing things.
[00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:36.080]   - That's a wild claim that Israel and Saudi Arabia
[00:51:36.080 --> 00:51:38.160]   were going to normalize 15 years ago.
[00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:39.680]   - 15 years ago might've been a wild claim.
[00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:42.680]   But after Turkey, after Jordan,
[00:51:42.680 --> 00:51:45.280]   and then in the past 20 years of economic relations
[00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:46.160]   and ties with each other,
[00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:47.520]   all of the leadership in the Middle East,
[00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:49.440]   and you'll agree with this, look at Israel,
[00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:51.280]   and they go, okay, well, we've got Palestinians
[00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:54.560]   who, God bless them, do nothing.
[00:51:54.560 --> 00:51:55.500]   And then you've got Israel,
[00:51:55.500 --> 00:51:58.400]   which is on a region with no natural resources
[00:51:58.400 --> 00:51:59.800]   to somehow become an economic giant.
[00:51:59.800 --> 00:52:00.620]   They're good to trade with.
[00:52:00.620 --> 00:52:01.780]   Their population's educated.
[00:52:01.780 --> 00:52:03.760]   They have military power.
[00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:05.680]   All of the leadership in these Middle Eastern countries
[00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:07.160]   are wanting to be friendly with Israel
[00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:09.320]   and are engaging in trade de facto with Israel.
[00:52:09.320 --> 00:52:12.640]   And the idea that the UAE and Bahrain were brought in
[00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:14.640]   to say like, oh, well, now we're gonna officially say this,
[00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:15.480]   I just--
[00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:17.480]   - Those are the first steps toward, obviously,
[00:52:17.480 --> 00:52:19.200]   the formation of a new Middle East
[00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:21.480]   in which economics would predominate
[00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:23.040]   over sectarian conflict.
[00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:24.840]   The chief obstacle to that is Iran.
[00:52:24.840 --> 00:52:25.680]   - I agree.
[00:52:25.680 --> 00:52:27.800]   - The notion that negotiations with the Ayatollah
[00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:30.080]   were going to be a solution to any of this
[00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:30.920]   is absolutely benign.
[00:52:30.920 --> 00:52:33.520]   - But do we think, is it the Abraham Accords
[00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:34.920]   that's convincing Saudi Arabia
[00:52:34.920 --> 00:52:37.120]   to take a stance against Iran?
[00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:37.960]   - No, I mean, Saudi Arabia--
[00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:40.160]   - They're already fighting with each other, right?
[00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:41.000]   I don't think the Abraham Accords
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:43.880]   moved us any closer towards any type of real peace
[00:52:43.880 --> 00:52:44.720]   in the region.
[00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:46.720]   What has to happen is something has to happen with Iran.
[00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:47.920]   There has to be some diplomatic
[00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:49.680]   bilateral communication there.
[00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:51.600]   - No, what has to happen is the containment of Iran,
[00:52:51.600 --> 00:52:54.400]   which was what was taking place
[00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:57.640]   with the increased normalization with the Sunni Arab world
[00:52:57.640 --> 00:53:00.600]   and Israel combined with significant economic sanctions.
[00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:04.160]   The notion that there's this far-fetched notion
[00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:06.280]   in foreign policy circles that diplomacy
[00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:08.040]   can sort of be wish-cast out of thin air.
[00:53:08.040 --> 00:53:09.000]   That if you sit around a table
[00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:10.920]   that you can always come to an agreement with somebody.
[00:53:10.920 --> 00:53:12.840]   The Ayatollahs do not have common interests
[00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:13.920]   with the United States.
[00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:14.760]   They do not.
[00:53:14.760 --> 00:53:16.760]   And this idea that they are willing to take money
[00:53:16.760 --> 00:53:18.600]   in exchange for, for example,
[00:53:18.600 --> 00:53:21.720]   some sort of peaceful acquiescence to Israel's existence
[00:53:21.720 --> 00:53:22.920]   is obviously untrue.
[00:53:22.920 --> 00:53:24.080]   - Hasn't that historically,
[00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:25.720]   hasn't that been the case though?
[00:53:25.720 --> 00:53:28.200]   That you've had a region with tons of sectarian violence
[00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:30.160]   for a long time and then finally Turkey was like,
[00:53:30.160 --> 00:53:32.040]   "You know what, this isn't worth it."
[00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:33.400]   The United States paid them a lot of money.
[00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:35.280]   They had conversations with Israel.
[00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:37.560]   And you know what, the economy, the economic gains--
[00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:38.400]   - Well, I mean--
[00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:39.480]   - And that's the same thing with Jordan,
[00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:40.320]   same thing with--
[00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:41.160]   - Not to get into Turkish politics.
[00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:41.980]   - Sure, yeah.
[00:53:41.980 --> 00:53:45.000]   - But the situation with Turkey was actually quite warm
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:46.360]   between Israel and Turkey in the '90s
[00:53:46.360 --> 00:53:48.920]   when you had the, you know,
[00:53:48.920 --> 00:53:52.480]   sort of secular Muslim regime--
[00:53:52.480 --> 00:53:53.320]   - In the '90s, but they signed peace--
[00:53:53.320 --> 00:53:54.560]   - Of Kemal Ataturk in place.
[00:53:54.560 --> 00:53:57.760]   And now Erdogan has joined in the fray
[00:53:57.760 --> 00:53:59.560]   and Erdogan is significantly more radical
[00:53:59.560 --> 00:54:01.600]   than what he was before. - Sure, I'm so sorry.
[00:54:01.600 --> 00:54:03.360]   If I said Turkey, I meant Egypt, my bad.
[00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:04.200]   - Yeah, okay, so--
[00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:05.040]   - I meant Egypt, yeah.
[00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:07.080]   - Yeah, so in terms of like Egypt and Jordan, right,
[00:54:07.080 --> 00:54:07.920]   were the first two--
[00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:10.480]   - You need back to, so here's the thing.
[00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:11.960]   Is it possible that you could theoretically
[00:54:11.960 --> 00:54:14.720]   come to a deal with Iran only with a new leadership crew?
[00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:17.200]   Okay, this is true for every peace agreement in the region.
[00:54:17.200 --> 00:54:20.280]   You could not, Israel could not have made peace with--
[00:54:20.280 --> 00:54:22.400]   - Well, they made peace with Egypt and Sadat
[00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:23.720]   was the leader for Yom Kippur, right?
[00:54:23.720 --> 00:54:25.720]   - They did not make peace with Nasser, right?
[00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:27.200]   The point is that this is a different regime.
[00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:28.400]   You need a different regime.
[00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:29.240]   This is one of the problems--
[00:54:29.240 --> 00:54:30.080]   - But I'm saying the same regime
[00:54:30.080 --> 00:54:31.360]   that did part of the Yom Kippur War
[00:54:31.360 --> 00:54:34.200]   was the same regime that negotiated peace with Israel.
[00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:36.400]   I mean, that's true, it is also true
[00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:40.000]   that that is a relationship that could be cultivated
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:43.280]   specifically because it was Sadat who made clear
[00:54:43.280 --> 00:54:44.840]   he was gonna come to the table.
[00:54:44.840 --> 00:54:45.960]   Have the Iranians ever made clear
[00:54:45.960 --> 00:54:47.320]   that they would come to the table over, for example,
[00:54:47.320 --> 00:54:48.920]   the existence of the state of Israel?
[00:54:48.920 --> 00:54:50.040]   - No.
[00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:51.760]   - That is not a thing that's going to happen.
[00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:52.600]   But I think people probably--
[00:54:52.600 --> 00:54:53.520]   - Literally felt the same.
[00:54:53.520 --> 00:54:54.680]   - Every single one of their proxy groups,
[00:54:54.680 --> 00:54:56.240]   every one of them not only calls
[00:54:56.240 --> 00:54:57.840]   for the destruction of the state of Israel,
[00:54:57.840 --> 00:55:00.000]   they also call for the destruction of America.
[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:01.780]   I mean, this is literally the Houthi slogan.
[00:55:01.780 --> 00:55:02.720]   They're busy hitting ships
[00:55:02.720 --> 00:55:05.240]   and their slogan is literally "Allahu Akbar,"
[00:55:05.240 --> 00:55:07.720]   "Death to America," "Death to the Jews," "Death to Israel."
[00:55:07.720 --> 00:55:08.880]   It doesn't fit on a bumper sticker,
[00:55:08.880 --> 00:55:10.240]   but it's not all that catchy,
[00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:11.880]   but that is, in fact, their slogan.
[00:55:11.880 --> 00:55:14.640]   The notion that the regime that propagates that
[00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:16.800]   is going to be approached with diplomacy
[00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:19.480]   is not only wrong, the problem is
[00:55:19.480 --> 00:55:22.400]   that it's easy to say that the stakes of diplomacy are,
[00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:23.720]   okay, so we try to talk, right?
[00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:25.840]   Jaw-jaw is better than war-war.
[00:55:25.840 --> 00:55:29.160]   Sure, the only problem is that in the Middle East,
[00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:30.840]   weakness is taken as a sign
[00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:33.320]   that aggression might be an appropriate response.
[00:55:33.320 --> 00:55:35.440]   That is how things work in the Middle East.
[00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:40.200]   And the fact that Joe Biden came into office
[00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:42.240]   with an orientation toward continuing
[00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:46.520]   the Obama policies in Iran has led to conflagrations,
[00:55:46.520 --> 00:55:49.360]   these sort of brush fires breaking out everywhere
[00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:52.040]   that Iran has borders with either the West
[00:55:52.040 --> 00:55:53.600]   or Israel or both, right?
[00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:55.440]   Any place that's happening is leading to brush fires
[00:55:55.440 --> 00:55:57.560]   because, again, the logic of violence in the Middle East
[00:55:57.560 --> 00:55:58.980]   is not quite the logic of violence
[00:55:58.980 --> 00:56:00.560]   in other places in the world.
[00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:01.840]   By the way, I think the logic of violence in the Middle East
[00:56:01.840 --> 00:56:03.560]   is actually closer to what most international politics
[00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:05.600]   looks like than we wish that it were.
[00:56:05.600 --> 00:56:06.440]   I mean, I think that's part of
[00:56:06.440 --> 00:56:08.160]   what's happening in Ukraine as well.
[00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:09.200]   - So you think that for-- - Which brings me,
[00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:11.040]   by the way, here's my question about Ukraine.
[00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:11.880]   - Sure. - I don't mean to
[00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:12.700]   skip around. - We'll just real quick,
[00:56:12.700 --> 00:56:13.540]   and then you can answer this one.
[00:56:13.540 --> 00:56:15.040]   So you think that for Iran, right,
[00:56:15.040 --> 00:56:16.080]   a country that has been sanctioned
[00:56:16.080 --> 00:56:17.880]   for God knows how many years now,
[00:56:17.880 --> 00:56:20.080]   you think that for Iran, just continuing to sanction them
[00:56:20.080 --> 00:56:22.080]   and contain them is an effective way,
[00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:24.040]   is more effective than trying to engage them
[00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:26.280]   in bilateral or multilateral peace talks?
[00:56:26.280 --> 00:56:27.640]   - Yes, 100%. - Okay.
[00:56:27.640 --> 00:56:28.560]   - And the proof is in the pudding.
[00:56:28.560 --> 00:56:30.720]   Before we go to Ukraine, can I ask about Israel?
[00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:33.480]   So you're both mostly in agreement,
[00:56:33.480 --> 00:56:35.000]   but what is Israel-- - I was about to say that.
[00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:38.480]   - Okay, but as I'm learning,
[00:56:38.480 --> 00:56:41.520]   what is Israel doing right, what is Israel doing wrong
[00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:45.900]   in this very specific current war in Gaza?
[00:56:45.900 --> 00:56:49.160]   - I mean, frankly, I think that what Israel's doing wrong
[00:56:49.160 --> 00:56:51.400]   is if I were Israel, okay, like again,
[00:56:51.400 --> 00:56:53.120]   America's interests are not coincident
[00:56:53.120 --> 00:56:54.400]   with Israel's interests.
[00:56:54.400 --> 00:56:57.960]   If I were an Israeli leader, I would have swiveled up
[00:56:57.960 --> 00:57:01.280]   and I would have knocked the bleep out of Hezbollah early.
[00:57:01.280 --> 00:57:03.720]   - What does that mean? - So I would have,
[00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:05.560]   Yoav Galant, who was the defense minister of Israel,
[00:57:05.560 --> 00:57:07.820]   was encouraging Netanyahu, who's the prime minister,
[00:57:07.820 --> 00:57:09.280]   and the war cabinet, including Benny Gantz.
[00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:10.960]   So whenever people talk about the Netanyahu government,
[00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:11.960]   that's not what's in place right now.
[00:57:11.960 --> 00:57:13.400]   There's a unity war government in place
[00:57:13.400 --> 00:57:15.280]   that includes the political opposition.
[00:57:15.280 --> 00:57:16.120]   The reason I point that out
[00:57:16.120 --> 00:57:17.600]   is because there are a lot of people politically
[00:57:17.600 --> 00:57:19.760]   who will suggest that the actions Israel is currently taking
[00:57:19.760 --> 00:57:23.000]   are somehow the manifestation of a right-wing government.
[00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:24.280]   Israel currently does not have
[00:57:24.280 --> 00:57:25.260]   a quote-unquote right-wing government,
[00:57:25.260 --> 00:57:27.000]   they have a unity government that includes the opposition.
[00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:28.920]   But in any case, Yoav Galant was urging
[00:57:28.920 --> 00:57:29.960]   in the very early days of the war
[00:57:29.960 --> 00:57:32.720]   that Israel should turn north and instead of hitting Hamas,
[00:57:32.720 --> 00:57:34.360]   they should actually take the opportunity
[00:57:34.360 --> 00:57:35.320]   to knock Hezbollah out
[00:57:35.320 --> 00:57:37.440]   because Hezbollah is significantly more dangerous
[00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:39.360]   to the existence of the state of Israel than Hamas.
[00:57:39.360 --> 00:57:40.680]   I actually agree with that.
[00:57:40.680 --> 00:57:43.800]   As far as what Israel has been doing wrong
[00:57:43.800 --> 00:57:47.240]   in the actual war, I mean, I think that,
[00:57:47.240 --> 00:57:50.120]   again, from an American perspective,
[00:57:50.120 --> 00:57:52.000]   I think that Israel is doing pretty well.
[00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:53.680]   From an Israeli perspective, if I were Israeli,
[00:57:53.680 --> 00:57:57.360]   I would actually want Israel to be less loose
[00:57:57.360 --> 00:58:00.960]   about sending its soldiers in on the ground level.
[00:58:00.960 --> 00:58:02.920]   So Israel is attempting to minimize civilian casualties
[00:58:02.920 --> 00:58:05.920]   and the cost of that has been the highest military death toll
[00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:08.720]   that Israel has had since the 1973 Yom Kippur War.
[00:58:08.720 --> 00:58:11.480]   I mean, I personally know through one degree of separation,
[00:58:11.480 --> 00:58:13.200]   three separate people have been killed in Gaza
[00:58:13.200 --> 00:58:15.480]   and that's because they're going in door to door,
[00:58:15.480 --> 00:58:16.880]   it's because they're attempting
[00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:19.160]   to minimize civilian casualties
[00:58:19.160 --> 00:58:22.660]   and they're losing a lot of guys in this particular war.
[00:58:23.660 --> 00:58:25.980]   The problem that Israel has had, historically speaking,
[00:58:25.980 --> 00:58:27.980]   is that Israel got very complacent
[00:58:27.980 --> 00:58:29.220]   about its own security situation.
[00:58:29.220 --> 00:58:32.020]   They believed the technology was going to somehow correct
[00:58:32.020 --> 00:58:35.260]   for the hatred on the other side of the wall.
[00:58:35.260 --> 00:58:37.300]   Okay, so our people have to live underground
[00:58:37.300 --> 00:58:39.380]   for two weeks at a time while some rockets fall,
[00:58:39.380 --> 00:58:40.740]   but at least it's not a war.
[00:58:40.740 --> 00:58:45.260]   And that complacence bred what happened on October 7th.
[00:58:45.260 --> 00:58:47.860]   So to me, what Israel did wrong
[00:58:47.860 --> 00:58:50.260]   was years and years and years of complacence
[00:58:50.260 --> 00:58:53.380]   and belief in an Oslo system that is at root a failure
[00:58:53.380 --> 00:58:54.740]   because you cannot make a peace agreement
[00:58:54.740 --> 00:58:56.580]   with people who do not want to make peace with you.
[00:58:56.580 --> 00:58:58.280]   So that's what I think Israel is doing wrong.
[00:58:58.280 --> 00:58:59.940]   I have a feeling there's gonna be wide divergence
[00:58:59.940 --> 00:59:00.780]   on this point.
[00:59:00.780 --> 00:59:03.780]   - Maybe.
[00:59:03.780 --> 00:59:07.020]   So in terms of, broadly speaking,
[00:59:07.020 --> 00:59:08.700]   I generally oppose settlement expansion.
[00:59:08.700 --> 00:59:10.220]   It's a thing that Israel does incorrectly
[00:59:10.220 --> 00:59:11.660]   that I think is kind of like provocative
[00:59:11.660 --> 00:59:14.420]   to at least all the Palestinians in the West Bank
[00:59:14.420 --> 00:59:16.140]   and it probably energizes hatred
[00:59:16.140 --> 00:59:17.780]   in the Gaza Strip for them as well.
[00:59:17.780 --> 00:59:21.540]   In terms of conducting warfare,
[00:59:21.540 --> 00:59:23.980]   the one thing that I always say to everybody,
[00:59:23.980 --> 00:59:25.300]   especially Americans,
[00:59:25.300 --> 00:59:28.000]   is you can't evaluate things from an American perspective.
[00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:28.840]   It's very stupid.
[00:59:28.840 --> 00:59:30.340]   It happened a lot with Ukraine where people are like,
[00:59:30.340 --> 00:59:31.780]   oh, well, didn't they work with the Nazis
[00:59:31.780 --> 00:59:33.500]   and weren't the Soviets the good guys?
[00:59:33.500 --> 00:59:35.140]   And it's like, well, in other parts of the world,
[00:59:35.140 --> 00:59:36.500]   it's not quite as simple.
[00:59:36.500 --> 00:59:39.100]   And I think the same is true for Israel-Palestine,
[00:59:39.100 --> 00:59:41.540]   that a lot of Americans will analyze the conflict
[00:59:41.540 --> 00:59:44.360]   as just being one between only Israel and Palestine,
[00:59:44.360 --> 00:59:45.200]   which it's not.
[00:59:45.200 --> 00:59:46.060]   It's a conflict between Israel
[00:59:46.060 --> 00:59:48.620]   and then Palestine has below the Houthis and Iran.
[00:59:48.620 --> 00:59:49.520]   Right now it is.
[00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:51.620]   I think that the,
[00:59:51.620 --> 00:59:53.260]   however, one area where I'll break with Ben
[00:59:53.260 --> 00:59:55.740]   is I think that minimizing civilian casualties
[00:59:55.740 --> 00:59:57.180]   and everything is very, very, very important.
[00:59:57.180 --> 00:59:58.420]   I think on the Israeli side,
[00:59:58.420 --> 00:59:59.260]   I don't think it's important
[00:59:59.260 --> 01:00:00.580]   so that the US will stay with them
[01:00:00.580 --> 01:00:02.740]   'cause I think the US is probably gonna stick with Israel
[01:00:02.740 --> 01:00:03.940]   as long as they're not doing anything crazy.
[01:00:03.940 --> 01:00:04.980]   And I don't even think it matters
[01:00:04.980 --> 01:00:06.180]   for the international community.
[01:00:06.180 --> 01:00:07.620]   It definitely doesn't matter for the UN
[01:00:07.620 --> 01:00:09.500]   because Jesus Christ.
[01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:11.960]   However, I think it's really, really, really important
[01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:15.340]   that I think that in the Middle East, broadly speaking,
[01:00:15.340 --> 01:00:18.220]   I think that leadership, especially in the Gulf,
[01:00:18.220 --> 01:00:22.220]   has gotten over the Palestinian issue.
[01:00:22.220 --> 01:00:24.300]   I think that leadership is kind of like
[01:00:24.300 --> 01:00:25.560]   they don't care as much anymore,
[01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:28.220]   but the populations still care quite a bit.
[01:00:28.220 --> 01:00:31.340]   And I think that the main issue that Israel could run into
[01:00:31.340 --> 01:00:33.980]   is if the civilian death toll does climb too high
[01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:36.940]   and if they start to hit this 40, 50, 60,000 number
[01:00:36.940 --> 01:00:38.140]   of civilian casualties,
[01:00:38.140 --> 01:00:40.220]   they run the risk of the civilian populations
[01:00:40.220 --> 01:00:41.340]   in the surrounding Middle Eastern states
[01:00:41.340 --> 01:00:43.620]   becoming so antagonistic towards Israel
[01:00:43.620 --> 01:00:45.220]   that they start to take steps back
[01:00:45.220 --> 01:00:47.380]   towards normalization in the region.
[01:00:47.380 --> 01:00:49.580]   So for instance, I know that Bahrain, I think,
[01:00:49.580 --> 01:00:52.300]   already pulled out their ambassador to Israel.
[01:00:52.300 --> 01:00:54.580]   My guess is going to be it's temporary.
[01:00:54.580 --> 01:00:58.240]   I know that on the public speaking side,
[01:00:58.240 --> 01:01:00.380]   you've got a lot of people condemning Israel for the attacks
[01:01:00.380 --> 01:01:01.420]   and on the private side,
[01:01:01.420 --> 01:01:02.620]   you've got people telling Israel,
[01:01:02.620 --> 01:01:05.180]   "Please kill all of Hamas because this is untenable
[01:01:05.180 --> 01:01:07.420]   "and nobody wants to work in this situation."
[01:01:07.420 --> 01:01:09.540]   I don't know if this ended up being true or not.
[01:01:09.540 --> 01:01:10.560]   I'm guessing it didn't,
[01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:12.000]   but I saw on a couple of Twitter accounts,
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.200]   it was leaked that potentially Saudi Arabia
[01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:16.780]   was considering installing a government in the West Bank
[01:01:16.780 --> 01:01:18.460]   that they would run.
[01:01:18.460 --> 01:01:20.980]   - No, I think Israel would love nothing better than that,
[01:01:20.980 --> 01:01:22.420]   but that is not helping the Saudis.
[01:01:22.420 --> 01:01:23.540]   One of the big problems in the Middle East
[01:01:23.540 --> 01:01:26.940]   is literally no one wants to preside over the Palestinians.
[01:01:26.940 --> 01:01:29.780]   No one, in the Arab states, Israel, no one.
[01:01:29.780 --> 01:01:32.460]   - So I think the issue, and I'm largely actually,
[01:01:32.460 --> 01:01:33.940]   I'm very sympathetic towards the Palestinians
[01:01:33.940 --> 01:01:36.620]   because I think that since '48 and onwards,
[01:01:36.620 --> 01:01:38.300]   I think that all of the Arab states
[01:01:38.300 --> 01:01:39.700]   super gassed them up on that.
[01:01:39.700 --> 01:01:41.040]   They wanted the Palestinians to fight
[01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:42.840]   because they wanted to fight with Israel.
[01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:45.420]   However, as time has gone on and they've realized
[01:01:45.420 --> 01:01:46.900]   that it's kind of a lost cause,
[01:01:46.900 --> 01:01:48.500]   states have started to drop out.
[01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:50.700]   So you're getting these bilateral peace treaties
[01:01:50.700 --> 01:01:53.180]   with Egypt and with Jordan.
[01:01:53.180 --> 01:01:54.420]   You're getting multilateral agreements
[01:01:54.420 --> 01:01:55.580]   like the Abraham Accords.
[01:01:55.580 --> 01:01:57.160]   And now the Palestinians are looking around.
[01:01:57.160 --> 01:01:58.000]   I'm like, "Okay, well, you guys told us
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:59.500]   "to fight all this time, and now the only people
[01:01:59.500 --> 01:02:02.620]   "that we have supporting us are Iranian proxies."
[01:02:02.620 --> 01:02:04.380]   So the Palestinians are in a very weird spot
[01:02:04.380 --> 01:02:06.820]   where they've lost all their support.
[01:02:06.820 --> 01:02:09.820]   Yeah, I think that Israel, what I would say
[01:02:09.820 --> 01:02:11.560]   to be quote-unquote critical of Israel
[01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:14.080]   is Israel needs to take strong steps towards peace
[01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:17.440]   that probably involves them enduring some undue hardship.
[01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:19.960]   So not the October 7th attacks because Jesus,
[01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:23.480]   that's way too much, but other types of attacks
[01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:24.320]   that they might have to deal with
[01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:25.560]   that might cause some civilians to die
[01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:27.040]   that they don't come out over the top with
[01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:29.280]   and retaliate with if there's ever gonna be peace
[01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:30.120]   in that region.
[01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:32.240]   However, another thing that I've always said
[01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:34.280]   is a huge problem between Israel and Palestine
[01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:36.680]   is I think that both sides think
[01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:39.680]   that if they continue to fight, it will be good for them,
[01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:41.740]   but the problem is one side is delusional.
[01:02:41.740 --> 01:02:44.820]   I think Israel wants to continue to fight
[01:02:44.820 --> 01:02:48.100]   because they get justifications for the annexation
[01:02:48.100 --> 01:02:50.020]   of the Golan Heights, they get justifications
[01:02:50.020 --> 01:02:51.860]   for expansions, especially in Area C,
[01:02:51.860 --> 01:02:54.320]   that I think they're probably gonna try to annex soon.
[01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:56.020]   They get justifications for the increased
[01:02:56.020 --> 01:02:58.100]   military posturing towards the Gaza Strip
[01:02:58.100 --> 01:03:00.220]   and the embargoes, and Israel is right
[01:03:00.220 --> 01:03:01.220]   that if the conflict continues,
[01:03:01.220 --> 01:03:04.040]   really the situation only improves for Israel over time,
[01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:05.700]   but the Palestinians also all believe
[01:03:05.700 --> 01:03:07.580]   that if they keep fighting, they've thought this
[01:03:07.580 --> 01:03:09.660]   since 2000 under Arafat, that if they just keep fighting,
[01:03:09.660 --> 01:03:12.320]   they'll get better gains too, but that's not the case.
[01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:15.000]   - Is there a difference between Palestinian citizens
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:16.620]   and the leadership when you say that?
[01:03:16.620 --> 01:03:19.640]   - I love all people, I love all people around the world,
[01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:21.480]   and I think that when we analyze issues,
[01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:23.000]   I think that we have to be very honest
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:24.600]   with what the people on the ground think,
[01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:28.020]   and the idea that Hamas is just this one-off thing
[01:03:28.020 --> 01:03:30.480]   in the Gaza Strip is not only incorrect
[01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:31.320]   with the situation on the ground,
[01:03:31.320 --> 01:03:32.980]   it's also incredibly ahistorical,
[01:03:32.980 --> 01:03:35.480]   and the idea that the Palestinians in the West Bank,
[01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:37.600]   of which I believe the most recent polling shows,
[01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:41.840]   I wanna say 75 to 80% support the October 7th attacks.
[01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:45.760]   Palestinians in general want to fight
[01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:47.280]   in violent conflict with Israel,
[01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:49.520]   that's not just the position of the government,
[01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:50.800]   that's not just people.
[01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:53.720]   There's a reason why Abbas doesn't wanna do elections
[01:03:53.720 --> 01:03:56.440]   in the West Bank, and it's because the Palestinian people
[01:03:56.440 --> 01:03:57.540]   really do wanna fight with Israel,
[01:03:57.540 --> 01:04:00.580]   but to combat that problem is like,
[01:04:00.580 --> 01:04:02.000]   you have to get the UN on board,
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:03.720]   we've gotta do an actual addressing
[01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:05.720]   of the Palestinian refugee problem,
[01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:07.720]   which is handled like a joke right now.
[01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:09.080]   Iran has to be brought to the table
[01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:10.640]   in terms of negotiations,
[01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:11.880]   there has to be huge efforts made
[01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:14.800]   to economically revitalize these Palestinian areas,
[01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:16.000]   even though they're one of the highest recipients
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.680]   of aid in the world.
[01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:19.480]   You have to do something about the embargo
[01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:21.200]   and the blockade in the Gaza Strip,
[01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:22.580]   which isn't just maintained by Israel,
[01:04:22.580 --> 01:04:25.720]   it's also maintained by Egypt, you should ask why.
[01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:27.320]   Yeah, there's a lot of things that have to happen
[01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:29.040]   to fix that problem, but the reality is,
[01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:30.760]   is I don't think Israel really wants to,
[01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:32.400]   because they get to continue their expansion
[01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:33.960]   into the West Bank, and I don't think anybody
[01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:35.000]   around the world really cares that much,
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.920]   so I will argue with that.
[01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:39.440]   The idea that Israel does not want to end the conflict
[01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:41.400]   is belied by the history of what just happened
[01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:42.240]   with the Gaza Strip.
[01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:43.720]   So when we talk about settlements, for example,
[01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:45.480]   Israel did have settlements inside the Gaza Strip,
[01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:46.640]   there were 8,000 Jews who were living
[01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:49.360]   inside the Gaza Strip in Gush Katif.
[01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:53.560]   Up until 2005, they withdrew all of those people,
[01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:55.640]   I mean, took them literally out of their homes,
[01:04:55.640 --> 01:04:58.440]   and the result was not the burgeoning
[01:04:58.440 --> 01:05:01.480]   of a better attitude toward the state of Israel
[01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:03.600]   with regard to, for example,
[01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:05.080]   the Palestinian population in Gaza.
[01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:06.440]   In fact, it was more radical in Gaza
[01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:08.560]   than it was in the West Bank.
[01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:11.360]   The result was obviously the election of Hamas,
[01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:13.640]   the October 7th attacks, in which, unfortunately,
[01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:16.960]   many civilians took part in the October 7th attacks.
[01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:19.280]   There's video of people rushing, who are civilians,
[01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:22.400]   and dressed in civilian clothing, into Israeli villages.
[01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:23.320]   - Always the same thing.
[01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:26.240]   - Well, no, no, that is 100% true, obviously.
[01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:30.200]   And when it comes to Area C, and Israel's supposed deep
[01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:33.400]   and abiding desire for territorial expansion in Area C,
[01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:35.520]   Area C, so for those who are not familiar
[01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:36.360]   with the Oslo Accords, and again,
[01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:37.240]   this is getting very abstruse,
[01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:39.360]   but the Oslo Accords are broken down
[01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:41.240]   into three areas of the West Bank.
[01:05:41.240 --> 01:05:43.040]   Area A is under full Palestinian control.
[01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:44.320]   That'd be like Jenin and Nablus,
[01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:45.880]   the major cities, for example.
[01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:48.440]   There's Area B, which is mixed Israeli-Palestinian control,
[01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:50.280]   where Israel provides some level
[01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:52.840]   of military security and control.
[01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:53.760]   And then there's Area C.
[01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:55.720]   And Area C was to be decided later.
[01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:59.000]   It was left up for possible concessions
[01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000]   to the Palestinian Authority
[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:02.760]   if the Oslo Accords had moved forward.
[01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:04.360]   Those are disputed territories.
[01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:05.920]   There is building taking place in Area C
[01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:07.320]   by both actually, no one talks about this,
[01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:10.080]   but by Palestinians as well as Israelis.
[01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:14.000]   And the question as to whether, if Israel stopped building,
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:15.560]   there've been many settlement freeze in the past,
[01:06:15.560 --> 01:06:17.720]   including some undertaken by Netanyahu.
[01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:21.120]   And it actually has not done one iota of good
[01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:24.800]   in moving the ball forward in terms of actual negotiations.
[01:06:24.800 --> 01:06:27.400]   Again, the biggest problem is that the leadership
[01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:31.120]   for Palestinians has spent every day since really '67.
[01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:34.040]   It's not even '48, because between '48 and '67,
[01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:35.120]   Jordan was in charge of the West Bank,
[01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:36.440]   and Egypt was in charge of the Gaza Strip,
[01:06:36.440 --> 01:06:38.360]   and at no point did either of those powers say,
[01:06:38.360 --> 01:06:39.400]   hey, maybe we oughta hand this over
[01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:40.920]   to an independent Palestinian state,
[01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:42.920]   which was originally the division
[01:06:42.920 --> 01:06:46.160]   that was promoted by the UN Partition Plan in '47.
[01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:50.920]   Because of that, the leadership post '67,
[01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:52.240]   and really starting in '64,
[01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:55.120]   the Palestine Liberation Organization was founded in '64,
[01:06:55.120 --> 01:06:59.640]   and it called for the liberation of the land in '64.
[01:06:59.640 --> 01:07:01.280]   They had the West Bank, and they had the Gaza Strip,
[01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:02.760]   so they're talking about Tel Aviv.
[01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:06.720]   When it was founded in '64, the basic idea,
[01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:10.360]   as kind of indicated by that, was Israel will not exist.
[01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:11.400]   And that was a promise that's been made
[01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:14.240]   by pretty much every Palestinian leader in Arabic
[01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:16.400]   to the people that they are talking to.
[01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:18.920]   Yasser Arafat famously would do this sort of thing.
[01:07:18.920 --> 01:07:19.960]   He'd speak in English and talk about
[01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:21.040]   how he wanted a two-state solution,
[01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:22.640]   and then he'd go back to his own people and say,
[01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:24.680]   this is a Trojan horse, and we're gonna...
[01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:27.840]   If Israel could, if you think that Israeli parents
[01:07:27.840 --> 01:07:30.040]   wanna send their kids at the age of 18
[01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:35.040]   to go and monitor Jenin and Nablus and be in Khan Yunis,
[01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:36.240]   you're out of your mind.
[01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:37.080]   You're out of your mind.
[01:07:37.080 --> 01:07:38.120]   Israelis do not want that.
[01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:39.480]   In fact, Israelis didn't want that so much
[01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:41.040]   that they allowed rockets to fall in their cities
[01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:44.040]   for full-on 18 years in order to avoid sending soldiers
[01:07:44.040 --> 01:07:45.760]   en masse back into the Gaza Strip.
[01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:47.160]   - True, but I think Israel does wanna continue
[01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:48.680]   to expand settlements under the West Bank, right?
[01:07:48.680 --> 01:07:49.640]   They wanna continue to build.
[01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:52.080]   They wanna have all of Jerusalem, East Jerusalem as well.
[01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:53.440]   - Well, I mean, East Jerusalem has already been annexed,
[01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:55.360]   so East Jerusalem is, according to Israel,
[01:07:55.360 --> 01:07:56.200]   a part of Israel.
[01:07:56.200 --> 01:07:57.040]   That's not a settlement. - Sure.
[01:07:57.040 --> 01:07:57.880]   - So there's that.
[01:07:57.880 --> 01:08:00.400]   With regard to does Israel have an interest
[01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:02.800]   in expanding settlements in the West Bank,
[01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:04.760]   why would they not until there's a peace partner?
[01:08:04.760 --> 01:08:05.600]   - Sure, that's what I mean,
[01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:07.120]   but I'm saying as long as the conflict continues,
[01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:07.960]   'cause even when you talk about the--
[01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:09.920]   - No, but your suggestion is that they're incentivizing
[01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:11.840]   the conflict to continue so they can grab more land.
[01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:12.920]   - Well, no, let me be very clear.
[01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:14.400]   I don't think there's a plan.
[01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:16.080]   So some people say, for instance,
[01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:17.920]   they'll take that one quote from Netanyahu,
[01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:19.440]   and they'll try to say that he was funding
[01:08:19.440 --> 01:08:20.400]   the people in the Gaza Strip
[01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:21.840]   by allowing Qatari money to come in,
[01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:23.960]   even though he was actually speaking in opposition to Abbas,
[01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:25.560]   allowing the Gaza Strip to fall for Netanyahu
[01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:27.200]   to clear it out for him, they give it back, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:29.160]   I'm not saying, I'm not claiming those theories.
[01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:30.800]   I'm just saying that I think that Israel
[01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:32.760]   will take a relatively neutral stance
[01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:34.480]   towards conflict enduring,
[01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:35.960]   because as long as the conflict endures
[01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:38.720]   and as long as the settlements can expand,
[01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:40.060]   I think that benefits,
[01:08:40.060 --> 01:08:42.320]   I think that ultimately benefits Israel.
[01:08:42.320 --> 01:08:44.080]   - I think there'd be very, let's put it this way.
[01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:46.360]   If suddenly there arose among the Palestinians
[01:08:46.360 --> 01:08:48.040]   a deep and abiding desire for peace,
[01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:49.560]   approved by a vast majority of the population
[01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:51.640]   with serious security guarantees,
[01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:54.880]   I think you'd be very hard-pressed to find Israelis
[01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:57.160]   who would not be willing to at least consider that,
[01:08:57.160 --> 01:08:59.080]   in return for not expanding Bathroom to Nefrat.
[01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:01.880]   - I kind of, I would have agreed with you on October 6th.
[01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:03.320]   I think we're probably a year or two away
[01:09:03.320 --> 01:09:04.160]   from that right now, though.
[01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:06.080]   - No, no, but the point I'm making is that Israelis
[01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:08.440]   now realize that the entire peace process was a sham,
[01:09:08.440 --> 01:09:09.800]   meaning the people who are on the other side of the table
[01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:11.720]   were using it as a Trojan horse in the first place.
[01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:15.080]   The death of Oslo is not the death of Israeli hopefulness.
[01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:17.400]   It's the death of the illusion
[01:09:17.400 --> 01:09:18.440]   that on the other side of the table
[01:09:18.440 --> 01:09:20.080]   was anyone worth bargaining with.
[01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:20.920]   That's what's happening,
[01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:22.600]   and that's why you have this sort of insane disconnect
[01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:23.720]   right now between the United States
[01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:24.560]   and the Israeli government.
[01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:25.800]   Again, it's a unity government.
[01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:27.960]   No one in Israel is talking about making concessions
[01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:30.080]   to the Palestinian Authority for a wide variety of reasons,
[01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:31.720]   including the fact that Mahmoud Abbas's Fatah
[01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:34.160]   continues to pay actual families of terrorists
[01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:35.000]   who killed Jews.
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:35.840]   - Sure, the Mark Fund, yeah.
[01:09:35.840 --> 01:09:37.040]   - Right, and the fact--
[01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:39.040]   - Which is from the moderate West Bank.
[01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:40.280]   - Right, exactly.
[01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:44.200]   So again, the taste in Israel for this is,
[01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:45.960]   even the people who are the Chilonim, right,
[01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:47.600]   those are the most secular people in Israel,
[01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:48.440]   which was, by the way,
[01:09:48.440 --> 01:09:50.200]   the place that was attacked on October 7th.
[01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:52.080]   I mean, what people should understand is that October 7th
[01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:54.200]   was not an attack against settlements in the West Bank.
[01:09:54.200 --> 01:09:56.120]   It was an attack on peace villages
[01:09:56.120 --> 01:09:57.280]   that were essentially disarmed,
[01:09:57.280 --> 01:09:59.000]   and many of these people who were killed
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.160]   were peace activists who were literally trying to work
[01:10:01.160 --> 01:10:02.640]   with people in Gaza to get them jobs.
[01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:04.800]   I mean, it's just, it's mind-boggling.
[01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:06.800]   That's why you've had this ground shift in Israel.
[01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:09.040]   The next 20 years in Israel is gonna be about security
[01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:11.040]   and economic development, period, end of story.
[01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:12.880]   Everything else goes second, third place.
[01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:14.880]   - And I will say, I agree essentially
[01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:16.380]   with everything you're saying,
[01:10:16.380 --> 01:10:17.640]   not to loop back on another topic,
[01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:20.080]   but this is one of the reasons then why I was so critical.
[01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:20.960]   I don't wanna say critical,
[01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:23.480]   but like kind of nonchalant about the Abraham Accords,
[01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:24.560]   because they didn't address anything
[01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:25.540]   with the Palestinians whatsoever.
[01:10:25.540 --> 01:10:26.380]   They brought up countries
[01:10:26.380 --> 01:10:27.280]   that weren't super relevant to the conflict.
[01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:28.200]   They didn't bring in Qatar,
[01:10:28.200 --> 01:10:29.720]   which is where a lot of the money and support
[01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:30.640]   for the Gaza Strip comes from.
[01:10:30.640 --> 01:10:31.680]   They didn't involve Iran at all.
[01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:32.520]   They involved bilateral peace talks.
[01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:33.880]   - No, but it totally changed the mentality.
[01:10:33.880 --> 01:10:35.360]   And this is why, what I'm seeing right now,
[01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:38.000]   this is why, listen, I think that Biden has done better
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:39.200]   than I certainly expected him to do
[01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:40.160]   in terms of support for Israel.
[01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:42.160]   Like Obama was way less supportive of Israel
[01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:44.160]   than Biden by every metric.
[01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:46.400]   With that said, the rhetoric that he's been using recently
[01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:47.560]   and the Blinken have been using recently
[01:10:47.560 --> 01:10:49.560]   about Israel needs to make painful concessions for peace,
[01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:52.080]   Israel needs, re-centering this issue
[01:10:52.080 --> 01:10:54.320]   at the center of relations in the Middle East
[01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:55.760]   is doomed to failure.
[01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:57.820]   The magic, magic is a strong word,
[01:10:57.820 --> 01:11:01.080]   the benefit of the Abraham Accords
[01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:03.880]   was proof of what you're saying, which is true,
[01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:05.520]   which is that all of these surrounding countries
[01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:07.520]   in reality have abandoned the idea
[01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:08.560]   that there's a centrality
[01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:09.880]   to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.
[01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:12.280]   That is not the central conflict in the Middle East.
[01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:13.120]   And by the way, one of the reasons
[01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:14.320]   it's not the central conflict in the Middle East
[01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:15.560]   is because actually, ironically,
[01:11:15.560 --> 01:11:16.760]   'cause of the rise of Iran, right?
[01:11:16.760 --> 01:11:19.320]   It's Sunni states that are largely signing up with Israel
[01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:20.560]   because they're realizing they need
[01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:21.400]   some sort of counterweight
[01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:24.180]   to a burgeoning nuclear power in Iran.
[01:11:24.180 --> 01:11:26.760]   - Can we talk about Ukraine?
[01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:27.600]   - Sure.
[01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:31.040]   - Do you have a disagreement with what Destiny said?
[01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:35.320]   - My main problem with Biden's policy with regard to Ukraine
[01:11:35.320 --> 01:11:38.600]   is that he outsourced the end goal
[01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:41.220]   of the war to Zelensky early on.
[01:11:41.220 --> 01:11:44.880]   Now, that might make sense if that goal
[01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:46.360]   were something that he was willing to fund
[01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:48.360]   to the point of achievement,
[01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:50.440]   or if Zelensky could have achieved it on his own.
[01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:51.720]   But right now, and this has been true
[01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:52.560]   since pretty early on,
[01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:54.480]   the worst point Henry Kissinger made,
[01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:56.160]   that pretty early on in the war,
[01:11:56.160 --> 01:11:58.760]   it was very clear that, for example,
[01:11:58.760 --> 01:12:00.220]   Crimea was going nowhere.
[01:12:00.220 --> 01:12:01.920]   The Russians had control of Crimea,
[01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:04.180]   barring the United States giving permission
[01:12:04.180 --> 01:12:05.820]   to fly F-16s over Crimea,
[01:12:05.820 --> 01:12:07.200]   nothing was going to change over there.
[01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:10.040]   The same thing was true in most of the Donbass, right,
[01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:12.480]   in Luhansk and Donetsk, that that was not going to change.
[01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:14.400]   Zelensky stated goal, and you understand it,
[01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:15.840]   he's the leader of Ukraine, right,
[01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:19.320]   is that there was a predation on his territory in 2014,
[01:12:19.320 --> 01:12:20.960]   and that the Russians sent their little green men
[01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:22.640]   across the border, and then they took all of these areas,
[01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:24.160]   and so he, as leader of Ukraine, is saying,
[01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:25.640]   "Okay, I want all of that back."
[01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:27.680]   Now, the reality is that the US's interest
[01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:30.160]   had largely been achieved in the first few months of the war,
[01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:33.440]   meaning the revocation of the ability of Russia
[01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:36.760]   to take Ukraine and just ingest it,
[01:12:36.760 --> 01:12:39.360]   and two, the devastation of Russia's military capability.
[01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:40.600]   I mean, Russia has just been wrecked.
[01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:42.860]   I mean, their military is in serious straits
[01:12:42.860 --> 01:12:44.160]   because of the war in Ukraine.
[01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:46.520]   From an American perspective, I'm very much pro all of that.
[01:12:46.520 --> 01:12:48.440]   I think that we have an interest in Ukraine
[01:12:48.440 --> 01:12:49.720]   maintaining the buffer status
[01:12:49.720 --> 01:12:52.360]   against a territorially aggressive Russia.
[01:12:52.360 --> 01:12:54.720]   I think that the United States does have an interest
[01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:56.760]   in degrading the Russian military to the extent
[01:12:56.760 --> 01:12:58.020]   that it can't threaten the Baltic states
[01:12:58.020 --> 01:13:01.600]   or threaten Kazakhstan or other countries in the region.
[01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:04.980]   The problem I have with Biden's strategy is,
[01:13:04.980 --> 01:13:07.460]   as always, I think that it's a muddle,
[01:13:07.460 --> 01:13:10.600]   and I think muddles tend to end with misperceptions.
[01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:12.360]   War tends to break out and maintain
[01:13:12.360 --> 01:13:13.600]   because of misperception.
[01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:14.960]   Misperception, the other side's strength,
[01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:16.720]   the other side's intentions, and all of the rest.
[01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:17.960]   People misperceive what's gonna happen.
[01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:19.920]   They say, "I'll cross that line and nothing will happen,"
[01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:20.920]   right, this is what Putin thought.
[01:13:20.920 --> 01:13:22.480]   He thought, "I'll cross that line.
[01:13:22.480 --> 01:13:24.160]   They'll greet me as a liberator."
[01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:25.320]   And because the United States
[01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:26.480]   just surrendered in Afghanistan,
[01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:27.920]   essentially, they won't do anything,
[01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:29.840]   and the West is fragmenting 'cause NATO's fragmenting,
[01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:30.800]   and all the rest of this, and obviously,
[01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:32.760]   he was wrong on all of those scores.
[01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:37.040]   The problem for Biden is that, as with virtually every war,
[01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:39.680]   no end line was set.
[01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:42.480]   And so it became out recently, it was widely reported,
[01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:44.440]   that actually there was a peace deal that was on the table
[01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:47.040]   in the first few months that Putin was on board with
[01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:48.680]   that basically would have ceded
[01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:51.280]   Luhansk, and Donetsk, and Crimea to Russia
[01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:54.040]   in return for solidification of those lines,
[01:13:54.040 --> 01:13:57.320]   American and Western security guarantees to Ukraine, right?
[01:13:57.320 --> 01:13:58.520]   Ukraine wouldn't formally join NATO,
[01:13:58.520 --> 01:14:00.760]   but there would be security guarantees to Ukraine.
[01:14:00.760 --> 01:14:02.040]   We're ending up there anyway.
[01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:03.280]   It's just taking a lot more money
[01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:04.680]   and a lot more time to get there.
[01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:07.280]   - And do you think Trump would have helped push that peace?
[01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:09.680]   - Yes, and I think that Biden actually did Zelensky
[01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:11.240]   a bit of a disservice because Zelensky knows
[01:14:11.240 --> 01:14:12.800]   where this war is gonna end, and it's not gonna end
[01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:15.360]   with Luhansk, and Donetsk, and Crimea in Ukrainian hands.
[01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:17.120]   It's just not going to, and he knows that.
[01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:21.760]   What actually, in my opinion, Zelensky needed
[01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:23.760]   was for Joe Biden to be the person
[01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:25.560]   who foisted that deal upon him,
[01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:27.400]   so that he could then go back to his own people
[01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:29.680]   and say, "Listen, guys, I wanted all those things,
[01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:31.240]   "but the Americans weren't willing to allow me
[01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:32.760]   "to have all those things."
[01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:34.760]   And so we did an amazing job.
[01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:36.640]   We did a heroic job in defending our own land.
[01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:37.960]   We devastated the Russian military,
[01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:39.320]   even though no one expected us to,
[01:14:39.320 --> 01:14:41.000]   but we can't get back those things
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:42.600]   because it's unrealistic to get back those things
[01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:45.040]   because America basically, they're a big funder,
[01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:46.360]   and they're the ones who want the deal.
[01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:48.280]   Instead, what Biden said, and this was reported
[01:14:48.280 --> 01:14:49.400]   in the Washington Post last year,
[01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:51.680]   the Biden administration said, "We're gonna fight
[01:14:51.680 --> 01:14:53.760]   "for as long as it takes with as much as it takes."
[01:14:53.760 --> 01:14:56.200]   And when they were asked until when,
[01:14:56.200 --> 01:14:58.560]   they said, "Whatever Zelensky says."
[01:14:58.560 --> 01:15:00.720]   And that's not a policy.
[01:15:00.720 --> 01:15:03.240]   That's just a recipe for a frozen conflict
[01:15:03.240 --> 01:15:04.960]   with endless funding.
[01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:06.720]   Now, it may be that Putin has walked away from the table
[01:15:06.720 --> 01:15:08.240]   and that deal is no longer available.
[01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:10.120]   If that deal is available right now,
[01:15:10.120 --> 01:15:13.000]   I certainly hope that's being pursued behind closed doors.
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.560]   My main critique, again, of Biden is that
[01:15:15.560 --> 01:15:18.560]   when you outsource the end goal to another country
[01:15:18.560 --> 01:15:21.400]   without stating what America's interest is, that's a problem.
[01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:23.760]   I also think that Biden did really quite a poor job
[01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:26.520]   of sort of explaining what America's realistic interests are.
[01:15:26.520 --> 01:15:28.520]   I don't like it when American leaders,
[01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:32.320]   it's weird for me to say this, but I'm not a huge fan
[01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:35.600]   of the we're in it to protect democracy kind of rhetoric,
[01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:37.840]   because frankly, we are allied with many, many countries
[01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:38.680]   that are not democracies,
[01:15:38.680 --> 01:15:41.040]   and that's not actually how foreign policy works.
[01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:45.560]   We should, as an overall, you know, 30,000 foot goal,
[01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:49.520]   advance democracy and rights where we can.
[01:15:49.520 --> 01:15:53.040]   But the reason that we were fighting in favor of Ukraine,
[01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:54.680]   and when I say fighting, I mean giving them money
[01:15:54.680 --> 01:15:55.640]   and giving them weaponry.
[01:15:55.640 --> 01:15:57.760]   The reason that we were doing that in favor of Ukraine
[01:15:57.760 --> 01:16:01.520]   is not because of Ukraine's long history of clean voting
[01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:02.680]   and non-corruption.
[01:16:02.680 --> 01:16:03.760]   The reason that we were doing that
[01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:05.680]   is to counter Russian interests in the region.
[01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:08.360]   I mean, it was a pure real politic play.
[01:16:08.360 --> 01:16:09.840]   And that real politic play is hard to deny
[01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:11.800]   no matter what side of the aisle you're on.
[01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:14.480]   I think that what many Americans are going to,
[01:16:14.480 --> 01:16:17.280]   are reverting to is we have no interest there.
[01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:18.280]   Why are we spending money there
[01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:19.120]   and not spending money here?
[01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:19.960]   And that kind of stuff.
[01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:21.160]   And that argument can always be applied
[01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:22.600]   unless you actually articulate the reason
[01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:25.400]   why it is good for Americans beyond simply the ideological
[01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:26.880]   for the United States to be involved in a thing.
[01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:28.720]   So for example, I think right now,
[01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:32.040]   when Biden is talking, I think that what Biden just did,
[01:16:32.040 --> 01:16:34.480]   the United States as we speak, is striking the Houthis.
[01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:36.080]   I think that that's a really, really good thing.
[01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:37.200]   I think that's a necessary thing.
[01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:38.960]   I think American people should understand
[01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:40.160]   why that is happening.
[01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:43.320]   It's not because of quote unquote ideology, it is.
[01:16:43.320 --> 01:16:44.800]   I mean, on a very root level,
[01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:48.160]   but really it's because you're screwing up the straights.
[01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:49.160]   I mean, you can't do that.
[01:16:49.160 --> 01:16:50.720]   You can't screw up free trade.
[01:16:50.720 --> 01:16:52.200]   And Americans have an interest in not seeing
[01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:54.640]   all of our prices at the grocery store double and triple
[01:16:54.640 --> 01:16:57.040]   because a bunch of ragtag pirates,
[01:16:57.040 --> 01:16:59.280]   akin to the Barbary pirates from 1800,
[01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:00.800]   are bothering everyone, right?
[01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:01.880]   - So Ben said a lot there.
[01:17:01.880 --> 01:17:04.520]   Do you disagree with any aspect on the Ukraine side?
[01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:06.080]   - A little bit, yeah.
[01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:07.280]   I think on the macro, I agree.
[01:17:07.280 --> 01:17:09.400]   Maybe we get at the weasel a little bit on some things.
[01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:10.720]   On the final thing that he said though,
[01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:13.800]   I wish that Americans could have honest conversations
[01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:14.760]   about foreign policy.
[01:17:14.760 --> 01:17:17.200]   I think that it would just be better for everybody.
[01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:20.680]   I don't know if it's Red Scare after the Cold War,
[01:17:20.680 --> 01:17:23.280]   where it was like literally the behemoths
[01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:24.560]   were fighting against communism.
[01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:26.240]   And we felt like after '91,
[01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:27.840]   every single foreign policy decision
[01:17:27.840 --> 01:17:30.760]   needs to be able to be explained in like seven words.
[01:17:30.760 --> 01:17:32.960]   Like he's the bad guy and that's it.
[01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:35.040]   I wish we had more honest conversations
[01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:37.960]   about what our foreign policy interest is
[01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:38.840]   in a particular region.
[01:17:38.840 --> 01:17:41.040]   Because I don't think most Americans
[01:17:41.040 --> 01:17:42.320]   honestly could even articulate
[01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:43.840]   why Israel would be an important ally
[01:17:43.840 --> 01:17:46.280]   or why it's important to defend Ukraine against Russia
[01:17:46.280 --> 01:17:48.520]   or why should we care about Taiwan at all.
[01:17:48.520 --> 01:17:49.360]   I don't know if most Americans
[01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:50.960]   could articulate anything there,
[01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:52.560]   even though they might have very strong opinions
[01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:55.400]   about why we ought to be involved in certain conflicts.
[01:17:55.400 --> 01:17:56.280]   So I do agree with that.
[01:17:56.280 --> 01:17:59.440]   I wish we had more honest conversations about foreign policy.
[01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:02.920]   In terms of how Biden has handled Ukraine,
[01:18:02.920 --> 01:18:05.000]   the things that I liked the most were,
[01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:06.800]   one, that he was very clear in the beginning
[01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:07.880]   about what we wouldn't do.
[01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:12.000]   So Biden saying that we're not gonna do not a red line,
[01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:13.320]   no fly zones over Ukraine.
[01:18:13.320 --> 01:18:14.480]   We're not gonna be deploying troops
[01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:15.480]   on the ground in Ukraine.
[01:18:15.480 --> 01:18:17.080]   We're not gonna be doing anything
[01:18:17.080 --> 01:18:19.600]   that would have US soldiers and Russian soldiers
[01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:20.560]   crossing swords with each other.
[01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:21.400]   That's not gonna happen.
[01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:24.080]   I liked that he made that very clear at the beginning.
[01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:25.760]   And I liked that he coalition built
[01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:29.080]   between NATO and the EU to get people to send funds,
[01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:31.680]   training, soldiers, airplanes, and everything to Ukraine.
[01:18:31.680 --> 01:18:33.120]   I thought those two things were really good.
[01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:36.560]   In terms of basically writing Zelensky a blank check,
[01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:38.720]   I would like to hope that Biden
[01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:40.920]   and the entire United States learned a lesson
[01:18:40.920 --> 01:18:43.960]   from Iraq and Afghanistan that open-ended missions
[01:18:43.960 --> 01:18:46.200]   with unlimited budgets and no clear goal
[01:18:46.200 --> 01:18:49.160]   are like the worst foreign policy decisions you can ever do.
[01:18:49.160 --> 01:18:51.400]   They've like defined US foreign policy
[01:18:51.400 --> 01:18:53.800]   for the past two or three decades, which is unfortunate,
[01:18:53.800 --> 01:18:55.240]   but seems to be the case.
[01:18:55.240 --> 01:18:58.960]   My feeling would be, and this is just a feeling,
[01:18:58.960 --> 01:19:00.400]   I don't know if internal cables have leaked
[01:19:00.400 --> 01:19:04.200]   that say otherwise, is the Biden administration
[01:19:04.200 --> 01:19:06.400]   has probably always had a quiet position
[01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:08.760]   of at some point, there's gonna be an off-ramp here.
[01:19:08.760 --> 01:19:10.120]   And I think even a month or two ago,
[01:19:10.120 --> 01:19:11.840]   I think those talks were being leaked,
[01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:13.720]   that discussion had begun with Zelensky
[01:19:13.720 --> 01:19:14.680]   looking for an off-ramp.
[01:19:14.680 --> 01:19:16.640]   But publicly, of course,
[01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:18.240]   the United States is never gonna come out and say,
[01:19:18.240 --> 01:19:19.480]   "We are gonna support you guys to fight
[01:19:19.480 --> 01:19:21.640]   "as much as you want for three months."
[01:19:21.640 --> 01:19:23.160]   And then after that, it's no more.
[01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:24.600]   Obviously, that can't be the statement.
[01:19:24.600 --> 01:19:27.160]   It's always going to be that we're gonna support you
[01:19:27.160 --> 01:19:28.000]   in your fight against Russia-
[01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:29.800]   - Yeah, we tried that under Obama with Afghanistan.
[01:19:29.800 --> 01:19:30.640]   It was terrible.
[01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:31.480]   - Sure, yeah, you can't-
[01:19:31.480 --> 01:19:33.200]   - We'll escalate the troop levels to X,
[01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:34.280]   but only for six months and then we're-
[01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:35.480]   - Yeah, you just can't do that.
[01:19:35.480 --> 01:19:36.520]   It's always gonna come off as,
[01:19:36.520 --> 01:19:38.320]   "We're gonna support you forever and as long as it takes,
[01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:39.600]   "and as long as you need, whatever we have to do
[01:19:39.600 --> 01:19:41.440]   "to defend freedom and democracy in your country."
[01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:43.800]   And any other statement would be absurd.
[01:19:43.800 --> 01:19:46.880]   So I can understand why it feels like on a public level,
[01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:48.960]   a blank check and an indefinite time period
[01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:50.200]   was granted to Zelensky,
[01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:51.520]   but I don't think that's gonna be the case.
[01:19:51.520 --> 01:19:54.000]   I think, again, I hope we've learned our lessons
[01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:55.800]   in the Middle East about the forever wars,
[01:19:55.800 --> 01:19:57.800]   that this isn't gonna be a forever funding to Ukraine
[01:19:57.800 --> 01:19:59.440]   to fight for as long as they want.
[01:19:59.440 --> 01:20:00.640]   I do disagree.
[01:20:00.640 --> 01:20:02.520]   I feel like we're playing a little bit retrospectively
[01:20:02.520 --> 01:20:03.920]   saying that, "Well, it's obvious
[01:20:03.920 --> 01:20:05.200]   "that they're not gonna capture the Donbas.
[01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:06.960]   "It's obvious that they're not gonna capture Crimea."
[01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:08.840]   I agree for Crimea, that was incredibly obvious,
[01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:10.760]   but it was also really obvious that in two weeks,
[01:20:10.760 --> 01:20:14.080]   Russia would own Kiev and Ukraine was gonna be Belarus 2.0.
[01:20:14.080 --> 01:20:17.760]   I think that even for a lot of military people
[01:20:17.760 --> 01:20:19.720]   and analysts around the world,
[01:20:19.720 --> 01:20:21.640]   that that was an expectation
[01:20:21.640 --> 01:20:23.160]   or at least a significant probability.
[01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:25.560]   Nobody knew, the phrase that's thrown around now
[01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:27.760]   is paper tiger, that Russia's military
[01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:29.120]   was as ill-equipped as they were.
[01:20:29.120 --> 01:20:32.120]   So I can understand why, especially if you're Ukraine
[01:20:32.120 --> 01:20:33.760]   and if you've repelled an invasion
[01:20:33.760 --> 01:20:34.960]   from one of the world's largest armies,
[01:20:34.960 --> 01:20:36.280]   why you might feel like, "Well, fuck it.
[01:20:36.280 --> 01:20:37.280]   "Let's fight for a few months.
[01:20:37.280 --> 01:20:38.120]   "Let's fight for a year.
[01:20:38.120 --> 01:20:38.960]   "Let's see what happens."
[01:20:38.960 --> 01:20:40.960]   And I can understand the United States supporting them,
[01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:43.640]   but I agree that there has to be some reasonable off-ramp
[01:20:43.640 --> 01:20:44.520]   where we're not gonna fight forever.
[01:20:44.520 --> 01:20:46.240]   I think the U.S. State Department
[01:20:46.240 --> 01:20:48.440]   has already begun those conversations with Zelenskyy
[01:20:48.440 --> 01:20:50.480]   to look at what that off-ramp looks like.
[01:20:50.480 --> 01:20:52.440]   But yeah, I'm not too sure,
[01:20:52.440 --> 01:20:55.160]   other than explicitly stating publicly,
[01:20:55.160 --> 01:20:57.440]   "You can only fight until this date."
[01:20:57.440 --> 01:20:59.080]   I don't really know what else I would change.
[01:20:59.080 --> 01:21:01.480]   I don't think the Biden administration should have done that.
[01:21:01.480 --> 01:21:02.320]   I don't know what else-
[01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:04.960]   - Do you think Biden should cut this deal on the funding?
[01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:07.240]   Meaning there's this $105 billion deal
[01:21:07.240 --> 01:21:08.960]   that's been held up by debate
[01:21:08.960 --> 01:21:11.640]   between Republicans and Democrats over border, right?
[01:21:11.640 --> 01:21:14.040]   So basically, it contains $60 billion for Ukraine,
[01:21:14.040 --> 01:21:16.000]   $14 billion for Israel,
[01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:17.120]   another several billion dollars
[01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:19.440]   for Taiwanese defense against China,
[01:21:19.440 --> 01:21:20.960]   and then includes some border funding
[01:21:20.960 --> 01:21:22.000]   and some border provisions.
[01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:23.120]   Republicans want the border funding
[01:21:23.120 --> 01:21:23.960]   and the border provisions
[01:21:23.960 --> 01:21:25.840]   because we can get into the illegal immigration issue,
[01:21:25.840 --> 01:21:27.480]   but that's a pretty serious issue.
[01:21:27.480 --> 01:21:29.440]   And Biden and Democrats have been unwilling to hold that up.
[01:21:29.440 --> 01:21:30.720]   And that seems to me like,
[01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:32.440]   just from, put aside Republican, Democrats,
[01:21:32.440 --> 01:21:33.920]   it seems like political malpractice.
[01:21:33.920 --> 01:21:35.440]   Meaning there's a widespread perception
[01:21:35.440 --> 01:21:37.680]   in the United States that the border's a disaster area.
[01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:38.880]   Joe Biden wants these things.
[01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:40.720]   Many Republicans don't want these things.
[01:21:40.720 --> 01:21:41.720]   If he caves on the border stuff,
[01:21:41.720 --> 01:21:43.040]   he gets all the things that he wants,
[01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:44.400]   and he's gonna be able to go back
[01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:45.720]   to the moderates in the country
[01:21:45.720 --> 01:21:47.000]   and say, "I did something about the border."
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:48.440]   It seems like such an obvious win.
[01:21:48.440 --> 01:21:49.360]   - If he caves on the border stuff,
[01:21:49.360 --> 01:21:50.280]   you mean on the Ukraine stuff?
[01:21:50.280 --> 01:21:51.720]   - Yes, because then he gets the whole package.
[01:21:51.720 --> 01:21:53.700]   Meaning he can go back to his own base and he can say,
[01:21:53.700 --> 01:21:56.040]   "Listen, guys, I wanted to be easy on the border.
[01:21:56.040 --> 01:21:57.120]   The Republicans forced me to it,
[01:21:57.120 --> 01:21:58.240]   but we needed the Ukraine aid.
[01:21:58.240 --> 01:21:59.320]   We needed the Taiwan aid, right?"
[01:21:59.320 --> 01:22:00.160]   - Yeah.
[01:22:00.160 --> 01:22:02.560]   Honestly, you're gonna be more educated than me on this.
[01:22:02.560 --> 01:22:06.040]   I don't like, or maybe I just don't know enough.
[01:22:06.040 --> 01:22:07.080]   I don't like the principle
[01:22:07.080 --> 01:22:08.920]   that when we negotiate things in the United States,
[01:22:08.920 --> 01:22:11.640]   there's like 50 million hostages at all points in time
[01:22:11.640 --> 01:22:12.800]   for every single thing.
[01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:14.800]   Like, "Oh boy, here comes the debt ceiling.
[01:22:14.800 --> 01:22:15.800]   What do the Republicans want?
[01:22:15.800 --> 01:22:16.680]   What do the Democrats want?
[01:22:16.680 --> 01:22:19.000]   Oh boy, we can't fund our government."
[01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:22.880]   But I mean, obviously the argument is gonna be
[01:22:22.880 --> 01:22:24.980]   that if the Ukraine funding doesn't come in this bill,
[01:22:24.980 --> 01:22:26.360]   and if Biden and his administration feel
[01:22:26.360 --> 01:22:28.000]   like it's really important that unilaterally,
[01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:29.520]   or not unilaterally, but as a single issue,
[01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:30.680]   it's not gonna pass.
[01:22:30.680 --> 01:22:33.980]   So I would say that at this point,
[01:22:33.980 --> 01:22:35.600]   and I don't know what the conversations look like
[01:22:35.600 --> 01:22:36.840]   between the Biden administration and Zelensky,
[01:22:36.840 --> 01:22:38.580]   I would say at this point that it's probably fair
[01:22:38.580 --> 01:22:40.800]   to start making contingencies on the money
[01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:43.280]   that we give to Ukraine that, "Listen,
[01:22:43.280 --> 01:22:46.520]   this conflict has waged on now.
[01:22:46.520 --> 01:22:49.080]   Now we need to start looking for potential peace.
[01:22:49.080 --> 01:22:50.860]   We can't just write you an unlimited check."
[01:22:50.860 --> 01:22:52.700]   So I mean, if those strings are attached,
[01:22:52.700 --> 01:22:53.620]   I'd be okay with it.
[01:22:53.620 --> 01:22:54.820]   But the broader question of like,
[01:22:54.820 --> 01:22:57.020]   is it okay to make this particular piece of legislation
[01:22:57.020 --> 01:22:59.460]   with all this funding contingent on the Ukrainian funding?
[01:22:59.460 --> 01:23:00.620]   I mean, that just seems to be the way
[01:23:00.620 --> 01:23:02.660]   the government works now, unfortunately.
[01:23:02.660 --> 01:23:05.020]   - Quick pause, bathroom break.
[01:23:05.020 --> 01:23:07.860]   One of the big issues in this presidential election
[01:23:07.860 --> 01:23:10.380]   is gonna be January 6th.
[01:23:10.380 --> 01:23:12.580]   It's in the news now, and I think it's gonna get,
[01:23:12.580 --> 01:23:13.860]   become bigger and bigger and bigger.
[01:23:13.860 --> 01:23:16.660]   So question for Destiny first.
[01:23:16.660 --> 01:23:19.260]   Did Donald Trump incite an insurrection
[01:23:19.260 --> 01:23:22.000]   on January 6th, 2021?
[01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:23.380]   - Absolutely.
[01:23:23.380 --> 01:23:25.500]   This is probably ignoring every other issue
[01:23:25.500 --> 01:23:27.080]   we've talked about, of which I think there are plenty
[01:23:27.080 --> 01:23:30.340]   that I would say disqualify Trump from holding office.
[01:23:30.340 --> 01:23:33.140]   I think that the conduct and the behavior leading up to
[01:23:33.140 --> 01:23:37.780]   and including January 6th, I think is wildly indefensible.
[01:23:37.780 --> 01:23:42.140]   I am excited to see Ben trying to, yeah.
[01:23:42.140 --> 01:23:47.000]   The three to four stages are the taking
[01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:48.380]   what I think any reasonable person would say,
[01:23:48.380 --> 01:23:51.660]   knowingly false information about elections being rigged
[01:23:51.660 --> 01:23:54.060]   or ballot boxes being stuffed, or Ruby Freeman,
[01:23:54.060 --> 01:23:55.780]   running ballots three times in Georgia,
[01:23:55.780 --> 01:23:57.900]   taking that knowingly false information
[01:23:57.900 --> 01:24:00.700]   and trying to call state secretaries and stuff
[01:24:00.700 --> 01:24:03.380]   to have them flip their electoral vote.
[01:24:03.380 --> 01:24:04.900]   That was horrible.
[01:24:04.900 --> 01:24:10.780]   The plot that Eastman hatched in order to have these
[01:24:10.780 --> 01:24:13.800]   false slates of electors, where all seven states
[01:24:13.800 --> 01:24:16.420]   had citizens go in and falsely say
[01:24:16.420 --> 01:24:19.220]   that they were the duly elected electors
[01:24:19.220 --> 01:24:20.820]   that could submit votes to Congress.
[01:24:20.820 --> 01:24:22.420]   That was insane.
[01:24:22.420 --> 01:24:23.260]   That happened.
[01:24:23.260 --> 01:24:27.980]   Asking or begging Pence to accept these false states
[01:24:27.980 --> 01:24:29.660]   of electors initially, and then just say,
[01:24:29.660 --> 01:24:30.900]   you should just throw it out completely
[01:24:30.900 --> 01:24:32.420]   and throw it to the House delegation,
[01:24:32.420 --> 01:24:34.820]   which was majority Republican.
[01:24:34.820 --> 01:24:36.780]   That was absolutely unbelievable.
[01:24:36.780 --> 01:24:39.900]   And then on the day of January 6th,
[01:24:39.900 --> 01:24:42.060]   trying to capitalize on the violence by him,
[01:24:42.060 --> 01:24:43.940]   Giuliani and Eastman making phone calls
[01:24:43.940 --> 01:24:45.460]   to senators and congressmen saying,
[01:24:45.460 --> 01:24:47.140]   well, don't you think maybe you guys
[01:24:47.140 --> 01:24:48.900]   should delay the vote a little bit?
[01:24:48.900 --> 01:24:50.700]   Don't you think they're just really mad about the election?
[01:24:50.700 --> 01:24:53.620]   I think he said to McCarthy, they're more upset than you.
[01:24:53.620 --> 01:24:56.340]   And his utter dereliction of duty
[01:24:56.340 --> 01:24:59.620]   in not doing anything to stop the rioting
[01:24:59.620 --> 01:25:00.620]   that happened on January 6th,
[01:25:00.620 --> 01:25:01.860]   'cause he was too busy taking advantage of it.
[01:25:01.860 --> 01:25:04.140]   I think all of these things are horrible.
[01:25:04.140 --> 01:25:07.060]   I look forward to seeing the Jack Smith indictments
[01:25:07.060 --> 01:25:10.500]   play out in court, maybe even the Georgia Rico case.
[01:25:10.500 --> 01:25:13.740]   But yeah, I think all of these things are unfathomable.
[01:25:13.740 --> 01:25:15.820]   And I think when you look at the plot from start to finish,
[01:25:15.820 --> 01:25:17.420]   clearly the goal the entire time
[01:25:17.420 --> 01:25:19.780]   was to circumvent the peaceful transfer of power.
[01:25:19.780 --> 01:25:21.460]   That was the goal from start to finish,
[01:25:21.460 --> 01:25:22.900]   whether it was through false claims,
[01:25:22.900 --> 01:25:24.700]   whether it was through illegal schemes,
[01:25:24.700 --> 01:25:26.180]   or whether it was through violence at the Capitol
[01:25:26.180 --> 01:25:28.340]   to delay the certification of the vote.
[01:25:28.340 --> 01:25:29.620]   - Ben?
[01:25:29.620 --> 01:25:31.700]   - So I'm glad you're excited, it's always fun.
[01:25:31.700 --> 01:25:34.500]   So there are two elements to incitement of insurrection.
[01:25:34.500 --> 01:25:36.620]   One is incitement, the other is insurrection.
[01:25:36.620 --> 01:25:40.100]   So incitement has a legal standard, so does insurrection.
[01:25:40.100 --> 01:25:41.220]   Neither of those standards are met.
[01:25:41.220 --> 01:25:43.300]   So if you're asking me, morally speaking,
[01:25:43.300 --> 01:25:44.340]   did Donald Trump do the right thing
[01:25:44.340 --> 01:25:46.060]   between November 4th and January 6th?
[01:25:46.060 --> 01:25:48.540]   I said, I will continue to say, no, he did not.
[01:25:48.540 --> 01:25:50.660]   I think he was saying things that are false,
[01:25:50.660 --> 01:25:53.020]   with just factually false about his theories
[01:25:53.020 --> 01:25:54.380]   with regard to the election,
[01:25:54.380 --> 01:25:56.380]   about the election being stolen, about fraud.
[01:25:56.380 --> 01:25:57.740]   This was all adjudicated in court.
[01:25:57.740 --> 01:25:59.060]   He did not even bring many of the claims
[01:25:59.060 --> 01:26:01.420]   that he's brought publicly and all the rest of that.
[01:26:01.420 --> 01:26:03.380]   If we're talking about incitement of insurrection
[01:26:03.380 --> 01:26:04.220]   as a legal standard,
[01:26:04.220 --> 01:26:05.260]   it doesn't meet any of those standards.
[01:26:05.260 --> 01:26:06.380]   When it comes to incitement,
[01:26:06.380 --> 01:26:09.300]   it has to be incitement to immediate lawless action.
[01:26:09.300 --> 01:26:10.980]   That's the standard for incitement.
[01:26:10.980 --> 01:26:13.500]   And I'm very meticulous in how I use this
[01:26:13.500 --> 01:26:15.260]   because I happen to speak publicly a lot,
[01:26:15.260 --> 01:26:16.620]   and that means there are lots of people who listen to me,
[01:26:16.620 --> 01:26:18.460]   which means some of those people are probably crazy.
[01:26:18.460 --> 01:26:20.500]   And some of them may go and do a crazy thing.
[01:26:20.500 --> 01:26:21.580]   Did I incite them?
[01:26:21.580 --> 01:26:23.940]   The media tends to use the word incitement very loosely
[01:26:23.940 --> 01:26:25.100]   with regard to this sort of stuff,
[01:26:25.100 --> 01:26:26.500]   in the same way that Bernie Sanders, quote-unquote,
[01:26:26.500 --> 01:26:28.100]   incited the congressional baseball shooting.
[01:26:28.100 --> 01:26:29.180]   He did not.
[01:26:29.180 --> 01:26:30.940]   Bernie Sanders has a lot of things I disagree with.
[01:26:30.940 --> 01:26:32.620]   I think Bernie's a schmuck, doesn't matter.
[01:26:32.620 --> 01:26:34.020]   He did not incite that.
[01:26:34.020 --> 01:26:36.820]   So saying bad things is not the same thing
[01:26:36.820 --> 01:26:38.460]   as inciting violence.
[01:26:38.460 --> 01:26:40.260]   Inciting violence, the legal standard in the United States
[01:26:40.260 --> 01:26:42.020]   is I want you to go punch that guy in the face.
[01:26:42.020 --> 01:26:43.700]   That's inciting.
[01:26:43.700 --> 01:26:46.620]   With regard to insurrection, typically an insurrection,
[01:26:46.620 --> 01:26:48.420]   and there are some descriptions in case law,
[01:26:48.420 --> 01:26:50.420]   though none in statutory law as far as I'm aware,
[01:26:50.420 --> 01:26:52.020]   the typical description in case law
[01:26:52.020 --> 01:26:53.700]   is the replacement of one legitimate government
[01:26:53.700 --> 01:26:56.100]   of the United States with another by violent means.
[01:26:56.100 --> 01:26:58.900]   The notion that Donald Trump coordinated
[01:26:58.900 --> 01:27:01.980]   any such insurrection is belied by the FBI itself.
[01:27:01.980 --> 01:27:05.500]   The FBI put out a report in, I believe it was August of 2021
[01:27:05.500 --> 01:27:07.420]   suggesting that there was no well-coordinated
[01:27:07.420 --> 01:27:10.420]   insurrectionist attempt coordinated by the White House.
[01:27:10.420 --> 01:27:12.660]   In fact, what you had was Donald Trump thrashing around
[01:27:12.660 --> 01:27:15.660]   like that weird alien in the movie "Life."
[01:27:15.660 --> 01:27:16.980]   I don't know if you ever saw it with Jake Gyllenhaal
[01:27:16.980 --> 01:27:18.900]   where he's like kind of thrashing up against this glass box,
[01:27:18.900 --> 01:27:20.980]   just an alien just thrashing up against the glass box.
[01:27:20.980 --> 01:27:23.100]   That I think is more what you were seeing
[01:27:23.100 --> 01:27:25.820]   from November 4th to January 6th.
[01:27:25.820 --> 01:27:29.420]   And then again, the claim that January 6th itself
[01:27:29.420 --> 01:27:30.540]   was an insurrection.
[01:27:30.540 --> 01:27:32.940]   So virtually, I'm not aware that anyone was charged
[01:27:32.940 --> 01:27:33.820]   with actual insurrection.
[01:27:33.820 --> 01:27:34.660]   There were some people who were charged
[01:27:34.660 --> 01:27:35.720]   with seditious conspiracy.
[01:27:35.720 --> 01:27:37.660]   There are insurrection statutes that do exist.
[01:27:37.660 --> 01:27:40.940]   No one was charged under those particular statutes.
[01:27:40.940 --> 01:27:42.940]   There were some people who you could say informally
[01:27:42.940 --> 01:27:45.040]   had insurrectionist ideas.
[01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:46.960]   Those would be the people who wanted to hang Nancy Pelosi
[01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:47.980]   or kill Mike Pence.
[01:27:47.980 --> 01:27:50.980]   And those people are in jail right now.
[01:27:50.980 --> 01:27:53.160]   And the election went forward.
[01:27:53.160 --> 01:27:54.540]   The election was certified.
[01:27:54.540 --> 01:27:55.980]   Mike Pence presided over the certification.
[01:27:55.980 --> 01:27:57.580]   Mitch McConnell presided over the certification.
[01:27:57.580 --> 01:28:00.540]   Joe Biden has been the president for the last three years.
[01:28:00.540 --> 01:28:02.540]   So Donald Trump, by the way,
[01:28:02.540 --> 01:28:03.660]   was still president at that point.
[01:28:03.660 --> 01:28:05.760]   If he had actively wanted to do what other people
[01:28:05.760 --> 01:28:08.080]   who have actually launched coups have done,
[01:28:08.080 --> 01:28:09.800]   he would have theoretically called the National Guard
[01:28:09.800 --> 01:28:10.760]   not to put down the riot,
[01:28:10.760 --> 01:28:13.800]   but to actually depose the sitting government
[01:28:13.800 --> 01:28:16.520]   of the United States in the name of a specious legal theory.
[01:28:16.520 --> 01:28:17.360]   He did not do that.
[01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:18.180]   He did not attempt that.
[01:28:18.180 --> 01:28:20.220]   Nobody working for him did that.
[01:28:20.220 --> 01:28:21.800]   The most you can say, I think,
[01:28:21.800 --> 01:28:24.280]   about what everybody was doing is that,
[01:28:24.280 --> 01:28:26.000]   you know, and I wanna say everybody.
[01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.520]   We can talk about Trump 'cause this is really about Trump.
[01:28:28.520 --> 01:28:30.680]   He used a phrase that Trump was disseminating
[01:28:30.680 --> 01:28:32.360]   knowingly false information.
[01:28:32.360 --> 01:28:34.000]   The word that's carrying a lot of weight there
[01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:35.260]   is the word knowingly.
[01:28:35.260 --> 01:28:39.100]   So knowingly implies a knower.
[01:28:39.100 --> 01:28:40.900]   Do I think the information he was disseminating was false?
[01:28:40.900 --> 01:28:41.740]   Yes.
[01:28:41.740 --> 01:28:43.560]   Do I think that Donald Trump has unique capacity
[01:28:43.560 --> 01:28:45.220]   to convince himself of nearly anything
[01:28:45.220 --> 01:28:46.260]   that is to his own benefit?
[01:28:46.260 --> 01:28:47.220]   Absolutely.
[01:28:47.220 --> 01:28:48.460]   And I think that that's actually
[01:28:48.460 --> 01:28:50.500]   what Donald Trump was doing there.
[01:28:50.500 --> 01:28:52.300]   And the evidence of that is Donald Trump being a human
[01:28:52.300 --> 01:28:54.340]   and all of us watching him for the last several years.
[01:28:54.340 --> 01:28:58.280]   So, you know, the idea that he knew it to be false,
[01:28:58.280 --> 01:29:01.060]   I'm not even sure those standards apply in any,
[01:29:01.060 --> 01:29:02.580]   like just assessing him as a human,
[01:29:02.580 --> 01:29:03.620]   which is really what we're being asked to do
[01:29:03.620 --> 01:29:06.360]   because there's an intent element to this crime.
[01:29:06.360 --> 01:29:07.200]   Does Donald Trump,
[01:29:07.200 --> 01:29:08.600]   do you think that today Donald Trump knows
[01:29:08.600 --> 01:29:09.460]   that he lost the election?
[01:29:09.460 --> 01:29:10.380]   Absolutely.
[01:29:10.380 --> 01:29:12.800]   So I don't actually.
[01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:13.640]   I think that--
[01:29:13.640 --> 01:29:14.540]   But when we, so I'm glad
[01:29:14.540 --> 01:29:15.660]   that you have the attorney background.
[01:29:15.660 --> 01:29:17.380]   When we are assessing mens rea,
[01:29:17.380 --> 01:29:19.060]   when we're looking at certain criminal statutes
[01:29:19.060 --> 01:29:20.460]   where intent is required,
[01:29:20.460 --> 01:29:22.260]   it's a reasonable person standard, right?
[01:29:22.260 --> 01:29:24.920]   Would a reasonable person have known that they were--
[01:29:24.920 --> 01:29:26.140]   No, it depends on the mens rea standard.
[01:29:26.140 --> 01:29:27.940]   So it's not the same in every case.
[01:29:27.940 --> 01:29:30.760]   If you have to establish individual intent,
[01:29:30.760 --> 01:29:32.140]   then it's not enough to say
[01:29:32.140 --> 01:29:33.300]   a reasonable person should have known.
[01:29:33.300 --> 01:29:35.000]   That would be enough for a negligent statute.
[01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:36.780]   Usually when you're talking about reasonable people,
[01:29:36.780 --> 01:29:38.760]   person statutes, just legally speaking,
[01:29:38.760 --> 01:29:40.340]   a reasonable person statute is,
[01:29:40.340 --> 01:29:41.740]   should a reasonable person have known,
[01:29:41.740 --> 01:29:43.060]   that's when you get to like manslaughter.
[01:29:43.060 --> 01:29:44.620]   You can't do a reasonable person standard
[01:29:44.620 --> 01:29:45.740]   on like first degree murder.
[01:29:45.740 --> 01:29:47.120]   So you have to establish actual motive
[01:29:47.120 --> 01:29:47.960]   in first degree murder.
[01:29:47.960 --> 01:29:49.000]   But for first degree murder,
[01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:50.220]   you don't need the statement of,
[01:29:50.220 --> 01:29:51.900]   I plan to kill this person,
[01:29:51.900 --> 01:29:53.820]   or I intend to kill this person.
[01:29:53.820 --> 01:29:55.380]   We can prove that state of mind.
[01:29:55.380 --> 01:29:57.060]   You can have other circumstantial evidence.
[01:29:57.060 --> 01:29:57.900]   Correct, yes.
[01:29:57.900 --> 01:29:58.720]   Sure, you could prove it.
[01:29:58.720 --> 01:30:00.340]   So I feel like my feeling for Donald Trump was,
[01:30:00.340 --> 01:30:01.940]   there were all these people around him
[01:30:01.940 --> 01:30:04.260]   that he trusted to investigate election fraud.
[01:30:04.260 --> 01:30:05.820]   He trusted Barr and the DOJ.
[01:30:05.820 --> 01:30:08.260]   He asked Pence, his vice president, to look into it.
[01:30:08.260 --> 01:30:09.540]   He asked his chief of staff.
[01:30:09.540 --> 01:30:10.380]   He asked his legal counselor.
[01:30:10.380 --> 01:30:12.360]   There's so many people that ostensibly,
[01:30:12.360 --> 01:30:14.500]   he trusts them if he's asking them to look into it.
[01:30:14.500 --> 01:30:15.980]   And when all of them looked into it
[01:30:15.980 --> 01:30:18.500]   and reported back to him, no, we found nothing.
[01:30:18.500 --> 01:30:20.660]   What, unless we're gonna literally make the concession
[01:30:20.660 --> 01:30:23.700]   that Trump might actually be a delusional psycho man,
[01:30:23.700 --> 01:30:25.300]   at that point, should he not have realized like,
[01:30:25.300 --> 01:30:26.140]   well, okay, maybe there's-
[01:30:26.140 --> 01:30:27.380]   That's a nice thing you should have realized
[01:30:27.380 --> 01:30:28.780]   the day of the election, that he lost the election.
[01:30:28.780 --> 01:30:29.620]   But that's not, but that's not-
[01:30:29.620 --> 01:30:30.980]   Sure, but I'm just asking, I'm saying that like,
[01:30:30.980 --> 01:30:33.500]   at that point, should he not have known that,
[01:30:33.500 --> 01:30:36.340]   for him to go and propagate those claims
[01:30:36.340 --> 01:30:38.580]   that he'd asked all of the people he trusted to research,
[01:30:38.580 --> 01:30:40.180]   and then for him to take those claims
[01:30:40.180 --> 01:30:42.740]   to Michigan and to Georgia and then publicly,
[01:30:42.740 --> 01:30:44.780]   and to try to convince people to throw out the election,
[01:30:44.780 --> 01:30:45.620]   you don't think that-
[01:30:45.620 --> 01:30:46.440]   But you're doing the same thing.
[01:30:46.440 --> 01:30:48.060]   You're reverting to, should a reasonable person have known?
[01:30:48.060 --> 01:30:49.460]   Yes, a reasonable person should have known.
[01:30:49.460 --> 01:30:51.380]   Did Donald Trump know?
[01:30:51.380 --> 01:30:53.540]   That's a different question.
[01:30:53.540 --> 01:30:54.980]   And so conflating those two questions
[01:30:54.980 --> 01:30:56.220]   is gonna get you into some mess of territory.
[01:30:56.220 --> 01:30:57.340]   By the way, this is why Jack Smith
[01:30:57.340 --> 01:30:58.580]   charged the way Jack Smith charged.
[01:30:58.580 --> 01:30:59.620]   Yeah, which wasn't-
[01:30:59.620 --> 01:31:00.780]   Right, Jack Smith did not charge conspiracy.
[01:31:00.780 --> 01:31:03.340]   Jack Smith did not charge the insurrection.
[01:31:03.340 --> 01:31:05.180]   He did not charge seditious conspiracy, right?
[01:31:05.180 --> 01:31:07.380]   If he, the reason is because he's,
[01:31:07.380 --> 01:31:08.220]   Jack Smith is a good lawyer.
[01:31:08.220 --> 01:31:10.820]   What he's doing is he's actually broadly,
[01:31:10.820 --> 01:31:12.460]   I would say pretty obviously,
[01:31:12.460 --> 01:31:16.260]   expanding statutory coverage in weird areas
[01:31:16.260 --> 01:31:18.140]   in order to cover a thing that doesn't quite fit
[01:31:18.140 --> 01:31:19.840]   into any of these legal categories.
[01:31:19.840 --> 01:31:20.820]   But the point that I'm making is that
[01:31:20.820 --> 01:31:21.980]   Jack Smith is on my side of this.
[01:31:21.980 --> 01:31:23.540]   He doesn't think that he can actually establish
[01:31:23.540 --> 01:31:26.860]   the intent necessary to convict under a seditious conspiracy
[01:31:26.860 --> 01:31:28.700]   or an insurrection charge.
[01:31:28.700 --> 01:31:29.540]   I agree with that,
[01:31:29.540 --> 01:31:30.980]   but I think a lot of the underlying facts though,
[01:31:30.980 --> 01:31:32.680]   because he does bring up those calls
[01:31:32.680 --> 01:31:34.300]   to Raffensperger in Georgia,
[01:31:34.300 --> 01:31:35.420]   he does bring up in the indictments
[01:31:35.420 --> 01:31:37.940]   that they were knowingly false information.
[01:31:37.940 --> 01:31:39.540]   So it seems like that's gonna be part of the case,
[01:31:39.540 --> 01:31:41.180]   maybe not to convict on any of the four
[01:31:41.180 --> 01:31:42.460]   particular charges that he mentioned,
[01:31:42.460 --> 01:31:45.500]   but it seems like that's probably going to be part of
[01:31:45.500 --> 01:31:47.900]   what he's gonna have to establish in court to convict Trump.
[01:31:47.900 --> 01:31:50.460]   So I wanna look at the actual text of the charges.
[01:31:50.460 --> 01:31:52.580]   So I'm sorry that I don't have the memorization.
[01:31:52.580 --> 01:31:53.660]   I believe one's a fraud charge
[01:31:53.660 --> 01:31:55.360]   that generally does not apply to cases like this.
[01:31:55.360 --> 01:31:56.500]   Generally the fraud charge is like
[01:31:56.500 --> 01:31:58.260]   you're trying to steal money from the government.
[01:31:58.260 --> 01:32:00.380]   - Sure, probably it's been used pretty broadly in the past,
[01:32:00.380 --> 01:32:01.220]   though it doesn't have to just be
[01:32:01.220 --> 01:32:03.060]   because Smith has done oral arguments
[01:32:03.060 --> 01:32:04.700]   in response to a lot of the claims by Trump's lawyers.
[01:32:04.700 --> 01:32:05.540]   This was one of them,
[01:32:05.540 --> 01:32:07.340]   the infinite civil and criminal immunity
[01:32:07.340 --> 01:32:08.980]   was another one of them where he cites past cases
[01:32:08.980 --> 01:32:10.660]   where these types of things,
[01:32:10.660 --> 01:32:12.420]   because I think it was to defraud of civil rights,
[01:32:12.420 --> 01:32:13.340]   I think was the fourth charge.
[01:32:13.340 --> 01:32:14.700]   - Right, so the defraud of civil rights
[01:32:14.700 --> 01:32:16.300]   is usually somebody standing in the actual
[01:32:16.300 --> 01:32:18.980]   like voting house door and preventing you from voting,
[01:32:18.980 --> 01:32:20.740]   not you have a specious legal theory
[01:32:20.740 --> 01:32:21.700]   that you espouse in court
[01:32:21.700 --> 01:32:24.660]   about whether those votes should be thrown out.
[01:32:24.660 --> 01:32:25.500]   - Sure.
[01:32:25.500 --> 01:32:27.340]   - So I don't like the, when we say specious legal theory
[01:32:27.340 --> 01:32:29.820]   and novel application, which I do agree,
[01:32:29.820 --> 01:32:32.020]   some of these, in some ways it's novel.
[01:32:32.020 --> 01:32:33.900]   I don't think we've ever also had a president
[01:32:33.900 --> 01:32:34.940]   try to do this before.
[01:32:34.940 --> 01:32:36.140]   It is a novel situation
[01:32:36.140 --> 01:32:38.820]   where somebody has resisted the peaceful transfer of power
[01:32:38.820 --> 01:32:40.500]   this clearly in so many different ways.
[01:32:40.500 --> 01:32:42.060]   - Well, if you're talking about the legal cases,
[01:32:42.060 --> 01:32:42.900]   I mean, that's not true,
[01:32:42.900 --> 01:32:44.460]   but Gore sued in 2000, right?
[01:32:44.460 --> 01:32:46.180]   I mean, so like if you're talking about the legal cases--
[01:32:46.180 --> 01:32:47.500]   - Well, if this is comparable to Gore,
[01:32:47.500 --> 01:32:48.540]   if this is comparable to Gore--
[01:32:48.540 --> 01:32:49.500]   - I'm not saying it's comparable to Gore,
[01:32:49.500 --> 01:32:50.820]   I'm saying that if the idea
[01:32:50.820 --> 01:32:52.660]   is that espousing a legal theory in court
[01:32:52.660 --> 01:32:56.820]   amounts to de facto some form of election--
[01:32:56.820 --> 01:32:57.660]   - Well, I'm just saying that Gore--
[01:32:57.660 --> 01:33:00.580]   - Denial or interference in some way,
[01:33:00.580 --> 01:33:02.660]   that can't, that's not true.
[01:33:02.660 --> 01:33:04.260]   As a general principle, it's over-inclusive.
[01:33:04.260 --> 01:33:06.660]   - Sure, Gore wasn't trying to decertify the vote, though,
[01:33:06.660 --> 01:33:07.620]   for states, right?
[01:33:07.620 --> 01:33:09.180]   They challenged their thing to the Supreme Court,
[01:33:09.180 --> 01:33:10.340]   they lost their case in the Supreme Court,
[01:33:10.340 --> 01:33:11.780]   and then power transfer happened--
[01:33:11.780 --> 01:33:13.780]   - Right, and Donald Trump had a bunch of legal challenges,
[01:33:13.780 --> 01:33:15.180]   and then he had a rally, and then there was a riot,
[01:33:15.180 --> 01:33:16.020]   and then he left power.
[01:33:16.020 --> 01:33:18.380]   - Yeah, but the Eastman theory
[01:33:18.380 --> 01:33:21.060]   of what Pence could do in Congress
[01:33:21.060 --> 01:33:22.260]   is a far cry away--
[01:33:22.260 --> 01:33:24.260]   - It's a truly shitty theory, I mean, make no mistake,
[01:33:24.260 --> 01:33:25.340]   it's a really-- - But not just shitty,
[01:33:25.340 --> 01:33:27.380]   I think that if any Democrat had done this,
[01:33:27.380 --> 01:33:29.740]   I think that, I feel like we'd be looking at it
[01:33:29.740 --> 01:33:31.980]   in a far different lens.
[01:33:31.980 --> 01:33:34.700]   As in, we would be using terms like attempted coup,
[01:33:34.700 --> 01:33:36.700]   subversion of peaceful transfer of power,
[01:33:36.700 --> 01:33:39.980]   if a Democrat vice president had tried
[01:33:39.980 --> 01:33:42.700]   to essentially say that in Congress,
[01:33:42.700 --> 01:33:44.300]   they could throw away the vote.
[01:33:44.300 --> 01:33:47.420]   - So, I think what I wanna get to here, actually,
[01:33:47.420 --> 01:33:48.940]   so we can be more specific,
[01:33:48.940 --> 01:33:51.340]   is why are these terms important?
[01:33:51.340 --> 01:33:54.220]   We agree on, largely speaking, what happened.
[01:33:54.220 --> 01:33:56.540]   I think the characterization of the term,
[01:33:56.540 --> 01:33:58.340]   are we, we keep kind of bouncing around
[01:33:58.340 --> 01:34:00.100]   between two different categories,
[01:34:00.100 --> 01:34:02.020]   and I wanna make sure-- - We can dump the legal stuff,
[01:34:02.020 --> 01:34:02.860]   actually. - Okay, okay,
[01:34:02.860 --> 01:34:03.700]   so we're just talking-- - We're not looking at,
[01:34:03.700 --> 01:34:04.860]   'cause like you said, Jack Smith,
[01:34:04.860 --> 01:34:06.420]   nobody's charging with incitement,
[01:34:06.420 --> 01:34:08.220]   and I don't believe insurrection is a part of it,
[01:34:08.220 --> 01:34:09.060]   so we can dump it in legal.
[01:34:09.060 --> 01:34:10.940]   Just in terms of a president that is trying
[01:34:10.940 --> 01:34:12.740]   to prevent the peaceful transfer of power,
[01:34:12.740 --> 01:34:14.300]   so we can call that a bloodless coup,
[01:34:14.300 --> 01:34:16.980]   or a coup, or whatever contemporaneous term
[01:34:16.980 --> 01:34:17.820]   you wanna use.
[01:34:17.820 --> 01:34:20.420]   - Right, so prevent the peaceful transfer of power
[01:34:20.420 --> 01:34:23.860]   with all means, or using means that are inappropriate,
[01:34:23.860 --> 01:34:24.740]   not quite the same thing.
[01:34:24.740 --> 01:34:26.620]   - Using means that are inappropriate or illegal.
[01:34:26.620 --> 01:34:29.580]   - Okay, inappropriate, okay, so illegal, I don't think so.
[01:34:29.580 --> 01:34:31.900]   I don't think that these charges actually meet
[01:34:31.900 --> 01:34:33.740]   the criteria for the various charges,
[01:34:33.740 --> 01:34:34.820]   and we can discuss each case if you want.
[01:34:34.820 --> 01:34:37.940]   - Sure. - As far as inappropriate,
[01:34:37.940 --> 01:34:39.880]   sure, I think tons of inappropriate stuff.
[01:34:39.880 --> 01:34:41.700]   I mean, inappropriate seems not--
[01:34:41.700 --> 01:34:43.180]   - The reason why I don't like the word inappropriate, though,
[01:34:43.180 --> 01:34:44.660]   is because then conservatives are very quick to say,
[01:34:44.660 --> 01:34:45.540]   well, sure, he was inappropriate,
[01:34:45.540 --> 01:34:47.140]   but everybody was inappropriate.
[01:34:47.140 --> 01:34:48.660]   - I mean, I'll concede that he was more inappropriate
[01:34:48.660 --> 01:34:49.500]   than others, I just don't see that--
[01:34:49.500 --> 01:34:51.660]   - I don't see most inappropriate.
[01:34:51.660 --> 01:34:53.340]   - Sure. - Okay, that's important
[01:34:53.340 --> 01:34:55.060]   to me, though, does it not bother you
[01:34:55.060 --> 01:34:58.540]   that Donald Trump sought through legal
[01:34:58.540 --> 01:35:01.980]   and extra-legal and Trump-magical ways
[01:35:01.980 --> 01:35:05.980]   of trying to entrench his power as president
[01:35:05.980 --> 01:35:07.380]   past when he should have been able to?
[01:35:07.380 --> 01:35:09.560]   Is that not something that is incredibly troublesome?
[01:35:09.560 --> 01:35:14.340]   - I mean, the question to me is the bigger question
[01:35:14.340 --> 01:35:15.820]   that I think the Democrats are trying to promote
[01:35:15.820 --> 01:35:17.580]   in this election cycle, which is this means
[01:35:17.580 --> 01:35:19.280]   he is a threat to democracy sufficient
[01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:20.860]   that if he were to win the election,
[01:35:20.860 --> 01:35:22.220]   there would not be another.
[01:35:22.220 --> 01:35:24.660]   - Is that not, but he tried to do that last time,
[01:35:24.660 --> 01:35:26.620]   could he not try to do it next time?
[01:35:26.620 --> 01:35:28.420]   - I mean, he could try to do whatever he wants,
[01:35:28.420 --> 01:35:30.100]   presumably, and he would fail the same way
[01:35:30.100 --> 01:35:30.980]   that he did last time.
[01:35:30.980 --> 01:35:31.820]   - Why do we think that?
[01:35:31.820 --> 01:35:32.940]   - Because he failed.
[01:35:32.940 --> 01:35:33.780]   - Because if he failed once, he could never succeed.
[01:35:33.780 --> 01:35:36.460]   - Because it was a riot, it went on three hours, yes.
[01:35:36.460 --> 01:35:38.540]   - Like, let's say hypothetically,
[01:35:38.540 --> 01:35:41.540]   Lord, save me, let's say hypothetically,
[01:35:41.540 --> 01:35:45.060]   Giuliani was the next head of the Department of Justice.
[01:35:45.060 --> 01:35:46.580]   Giuliani was the next Attorney General.
[01:35:46.580 --> 01:35:47.940]   - How would he be confirmed?
[01:35:48.920 --> 01:35:52.040]   - Well, I'm not entirely sure if,
[01:35:52.040 --> 01:35:53.480]   because so much of the Republican Party,
[01:35:53.480 --> 01:35:55.280]   despite feeling like they don't support Trump,
[01:35:55.280 --> 01:35:56.840]   when it comes time to actually back him in Congress.
[01:35:56.840 --> 01:35:59.640]   - Also, I'd have to check whether he would be barred
[01:35:59.640 --> 01:36:00.960]   by criminal conviction from holding,
[01:36:00.960 --> 01:36:02.000]   I don't know the answer to that.
[01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.280]   - Sure, well, yeah, especially with the 14th Amendment,
[01:36:04.280 --> 01:36:07.200]   we're figuring out a lot of this right now, yeah.
[01:36:07.200 --> 01:36:09.240]   But I mean, like, say if not Giuliani,
[01:36:09.240 --> 01:36:11.640]   say if there are any other number of insane people
[01:36:11.640 --> 01:36:12.800]   that Trump could theoretically put
[01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:14.200]   on his side of the government
[01:36:14.200 --> 01:36:16.480]   that wouldn't tell him no next time,
[01:36:16.480 --> 01:36:17.680]   because there were a lot of people
[01:36:17.680 --> 01:36:18.520]   that rebuked him.
[01:36:18.520 --> 01:36:21.600]   There were Republicans in a lot of the states, right?
[01:36:21.600 --> 01:36:23.040]   Rappensperger is one of them.
[01:36:23.040 --> 01:36:25.320]   There were Republicans in his own administration.
[01:36:25.320 --> 01:36:27.800]   You've got Rosen, you've got Barr.
[01:36:27.800 --> 01:36:29.240]   There was his own vice president.
[01:36:29.240 --> 01:36:30.920]   But like, theoretically, next time,
[01:36:30.920 --> 01:36:32.880]   and I feel like last time going in,
[01:36:32.880 --> 01:36:34.400]   I'm gonna do a little bit of mind reading and macro,
[01:36:34.400 --> 01:36:35.260]   maybe you can maybe disagree.
[01:36:35.260 --> 01:36:36.480]   I think that Trump kind of thought,
[01:36:36.480 --> 01:36:38.320]   one, I don't think Trump knows much at all
[01:36:38.320 --> 01:36:39.440]   about how the government works.
[01:36:39.440 --> 01:36:40.800]   I think we probably agree with that.
[01:36:40.800 --> 01:36:43.020]   I think Trump probably thought that if he had people
[01:36:43.020 --> 01:36:45.180]   that were like, at least in his party and kind of camp,
[01:36:45.180 --> 01:36:47.540]   that they'll basically do whatever needs to be done
[01:36:47.540 --> 01:36:49.160]   to give him what he wants,
[01:36:49.160 --> 01:36:51.360]   and with no respect for process.
[01:36:51.360 --> 01:36:52.360]   But now that he sees it,
[01:36:52.360 --> 01:36:54.860]   well, it's not enough to just have allies.
[01:36:54.860 --> 01:36:57.040]   I need people that are fiercely allegiant to me.
[01:36:57.040 --> 01:36:58.320]   Would we not be worried that a guy
[01:36:58.320 --> 01:37:01.160]   that tried to essentially steal the election for real
[01:37:01.160 --> 01:37:02.160]   wouldn't try to pick people
[01:37:02.160 --> 01:37:03.640]   that would be more amenable to his plans
[01:37:03.640 --> 01:37:04.600]   in the next administration?
[01:37:04.600 --> 01:37:06.000]   - I believe in the checks and balances
[01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:06.840]   of American government.
[01:37:06.840 --> 01:37:08.720]   I believe they worked on January 6th.
[01:37:08.720 --> 01:37:09.560]   So if you're asking me,
[01:37:09.560 --> 01:37:11.240]   do I think that Trump has bad intent
[01:37:11.240 --> 01:37:13.280]   or could have bad intent with that sort of stuff?
[01:37:13.280 --> 01:37:14.120]   Sure.
[01:37:14.120 --> 01:37:15.880]   Do I believe that the guardrails held
[01:37:15.880 --> 01:37:17.000]   and will continue to hold?
[01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:18.520]   Also sure.
[01:37:18.520 --> 01:37:23.520]   - So if somebody was running and they blatantly said,
[01:37:23.520 --> 01:37:25.840]   like, I don't wanna use the fascist word,
[01:37:25.840 --> 01:37:27.320]   but if they said, like, I wanna be an authoritarian,
[01:37:27.320 --> 01:37:29.100]   I'm gonna abolish all elections.
[01:37:29.100 --> 01:37:31.320]   You would say, sure, he's saying that,
[01:37:31.320 --> 01:37:32.680]   but like, I don't think he can actually do it.
[01:37:32.680 --> 01:37:34.280]   So it's okay if he runs for president.
[01:37:34.280 --> 01:37:35.120]   You don't care at all,
[01:37:35.120 --> 01:37:35.960]   as long as you feel like the guardrails--
[01:37:35.960 --> 01:37:37.440]   - I mean, I might prefer other candidates,
[01:37:37.440 --> 01:37:39.280]   but I think that also one of the things that you do
[01:37:39.280 --> 01:37:41.080]   is that politicians,
[01:37:41.080 --> 01:37:43.140]   again, this would be an exceptional circumstance,
[01:37:43.140 --> 01:37:45.920]   but politicians constantly make promises
[01:37:45.920 --> 01:37:47.260]   about the things that they are going to do
[01:37:47.260 --> 01:37:48.100]   and then don't fulfill,
[01:37:48.100 --> 01:37:49.300]   and we tend to take those out in the wash,
[01:37:49.300 --> 01:37:53.040]   meaning that if I promise that day one,
[01:37:53.040 --> 01:37:54.060]   as Donald Trump has pledged to do,
[01:37:54.060 --> 01:37:55.220]   that he's going to deport literally
[01:37:55.220 --> 01:37:56.420]   every legal immigrant into the country,
[01:37:56.420 --> 01:37:58.260]   do I think he's actually going to do that?
[01:37:58.260 --> 01:37:59.860]   I mean, I really highly doubt it.
[01:37:59.860 --> 01:38:01.500]   He didn't do it last time he was in office.
[01:38:01.500 --> 01:38:03.380]   That's just, there are many examples of this.
[01:38:03.380 --> 01:38:04.660]   - I agree.
[01:38:04.660 --> 01:38:05.500]   - Here's my question.
[01:38:05.500 --> 01:38:07.540]   Do you think the guardrails are going to fail to hold?
[01:38:07.540 --> 01:38:08.820]   - I'm not sure.
[01:38:08.820 --> 01:38:09.660]   - Really?
[01:38:09.660 --> 01:38:10.620]   - Yeah, because I think the issue is,
[01:38:10.620 --> 01:38:12.940]   is one, when it's election time,
[01:38:12.940 --> 01:38:14.980]   Republicans are spineless in office,
[01:38:14.980 --> 01:38:16.380]   and I don't know how many congressmen
[01:38:16.380 --> 01:38:17.600]   would support what he wants
[01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:19.420]   just because they want to win re-election
[01:38:19.420 --> 01:38:20.860]   or because they think it's inevitable anyway.
[01:38:20.860 --> 01:38:22.500]   - Well, I mean, I think that one of the things
[01:38:22.500 --> 01:38:24.620]   that happened in 2022 is Democrats ran directly
[01:38:24.620 --> 01:38:26.540]   on this platform and a bunch of Republicans lost
[01:38:26.540 --> 01:38:27.420]   were running on this platform.
[01:38:27.420 --> 01:38:29.420]   Literally every secretary of state ran
[01:38:29.420 --> 01:38:32.360]   on the Donald Trump, we should deny elections platform,
[01:38:32.360 --> 01:38:33.620]   lost in every state.
[01:38:33.620 --> 01:38:34.460]   - Sure, but other Republicans that have been--
[01:38:34.460 --> 01:38:35.820]   - A great way to lose local office is this.
[01:38:35.820 --> 01:38:36.820]   - Sure, but I mean, look at what happened
[01:38:36.820 --> 01:38:39.620]   with Kinzinger and Cheney, right,
[01:38:39.620 --> 01:38:42.300]   who were very staunchly anti-Trump.
[01:38:42.300 --> 01:38:44.540]   - After J6, for that select committee, right,
[01:38:44.540 --> 01:38:46.180]   Kinzinger didn't even run again,
[01:38:46.180 --> 01:38:48.300]   and Cheney lost her election by, I think,
[01:38:48.300 --> 01:38:50.180]   the widest margin that anybody has ever lost
[01:38:50.180 --> 01:38:52.660]   an election ever in history, like all of US politics.
[01:38:52.660 --> 01:38:54.500]   - People who were not yet born voted against, yes.
[01:38:54.500 --> 01:38:56.380]   - I guess it's just, it's a surprising position to me
[01:38:56.380 --> 01:38:57.860]   for, if we're looking at like principled stances
[01:38:57.860 --> 01:39:00.380]   of government, the idea that a man who has,
[01:39:00.380 --> 01:39:02.220]   and I think we both agree on this,
[01:39:02.220 --> 01:39:05.060]   that Donald Trump's, Donald Trump's only allegiance
[01:39:05.060 --> 01:39:06.280]   is to Donald Trump, right?
[01:39:06.280 --> 01:39:07.120]   We agree on that.
[01:39:07.120 --> 01:39:07.940]   The only thing he cares about is Donald Trump.
[01:39:07.940 --> 01:39:09.300]   - I don't think it's the only thing he cares about,
[01:39:09.300 --> 01:39:10.140]   I think it's certainly the largest thing he cares about.
[01:39:10.140 --> 01:39:11.940]   - It's the largest thing he cares about, right?
[01:39:11.940 --> 01:39:14.060]   So you've got a man who only cares about himself.
[01:39:14.060 --> 01:39:14.900]   - Well, not even. - And not even politics.
[01:39:14.900 --> 01:39:16.020]   I mean, it may be more.
[01:39:16.020 --> 01:39:16.860]   - But that's not even--
[01:39:16.860 --> 01:39:17.780]   - It may be more with Trump,
[01:39:17.780 --> 01:39:18.940]   but it's certainly not unique to Trump.
[01:39:18.940 --> 01:39:20.440]   - I think that the issue with Trump, too, though,
[01:39:20.440 --> 01:39:23.860]   is I think he's even a threat to the Republican Party,
[01:39:23.860 --> 01:39:25.940]   in which I think he would mostly agree with me,
[01:39:25.940 --> 01:39:28.140]   maybe not overall, but on every individual point,
[01:39:28.140 --> 01:39:30.180]   Trump picks bad candidates, he has no concern
[01:39:30.180 --> 01:39:31.380]   for the future of the Republican Party.
[01:39:31.380 --> 01:39:33.580]   Like, for instance, I think there is a chance,
[01:39:33.580 --> 01:39:34.980]   I don't think it'll happen because of how the polling
[01:39:34.980 --> 01:39:37.140]   looks now, but if Trump didn't get the nomination,
[01:39:37.140 --> 01:39:38.660]   I think Trump would say, "Screw it and run as an
[01:39:38.660 --> 01:39:40.560]   "independent," because he thinks he can win or whatever,
[01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:42.540]   right? - I doubt that he would do that,
[01:39:42.540 --> 01:39:44.140]   but theoretically, he could. - It's possible, yeah.
[01:39:44.140 --> 01:39:48.080]   - Again, Trump has, he was really content to throw Georgia,
[01:39:48.080 --> 01:39:49.300]   the two runoff elections under the bus,
[01:39:49.300 --> 01:39:51.300]   because Rappaport didn't support him for the election.
[01:39:51.300 --> 01:39:53.740]   - So what is all this in service of?
[01:39:53.740 --> 01:39:55.580]   What's the generalized argument that you're making?
[01:39:55.580 --> 01:39:58.180]   Do you believe, I'll go back to my question,
[01:39:58.180 --> 01:40:00.100]   do you think that if Trump wins,
[01:40:00.100 --> 01:40:01.660]   there will be no more elections?
[01:40:01.660 --> 01:40:03.660]   Is that, like, put a percentage on it.
[01:40:03.660 --> 01:40:05.620]   What percentage do you think that that's a reality,
[01:40:05.620 --> 01:40:06.460]   that if Donald Trump becomes president?
[01:40:06.460 --> 01:40:08.460]   - If Donald Trump wins, I think there is a 100% chance
[01:40:08.460 --> 01:40:11.040]   that he will try to prevent the peaceful transfer of power.
[01:40:11.040 --> 01:40:12.520]   In terms of, would he succeed?
[01:40:12.520 --> 01:40:14.080]   - I can guarantee you he will not do that.
[01:40:14.080 --> 01:40:14.920]   - Why is that? - Because he's in
[01:40:14.920 --> 01:40:16.280]   his second term, and he's no longer eligible,
[01:40:16.280 --> 01:40:17.600]   and he will believe he won, and he will leave.
[01:40:17.600 --> 01:40:18.800]   - Yeah, but hasn't Donald Trump himself
[01:40:18.800 --> 01:40:20.400]   joked about running for a third term?
[01:40:20.400 --> 01:40:22.480]   I think that having a third term--
[01:40:22.480 --> 01:40:24.480]   - What has Donald Trump not joked about?
[01:40:24.480 --> 01:40:26.880]   I mean, for God's sake. - I don't, okay, hold on.
[01:40:26.880 --> 01:40:30.000]   - If you wanna prevent him from creating a revolution,
[01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:31.600]   you probably should actually just appoint him president,
[01:40:31.600 --> 01:40:32.440]   and then he can run again, so.
[01:40:32.440 --> 01:40:33.800]   - Here's another broad argument that I don't like
[01:40:33.800 --> 01:40:35.280]   in favor of Trump, and this was brought up earlier,
[01:40:35.280 --> 01:40:37.960]   in terms of, like, we talk about not grading presidents
[01:40:37.960 --> 01:40:39.380]   on a curve, but then earlier we said
[01:40:39.380 --> 01:40:40.220]   we'd take Biden's rhetoric--
[01:40:40.220 --> 01:40:41.060]   - Oh, no, I totally grade Trump.
[01:40:41.060 --> 01:40:43.300]   No, I 100% grade presidents on a curve, are you kidding?
[01:40:43.300 --> 01:40:44.420]   - Oh, okay. - I grade pretty much
[01:40:44.420 --> 01:40:45.260]   everybody on a curve. - But then I feel like--
[01:40:45.260 --> 01:40:46.580]   - I don't treat my seven-year-old the same way
[01:40:46.580 --> 01:40:47.580]   that I treat my nine-year-old.
[01:40:47.580 --> 01:40:49.580]   - Sure, but I don't like that it feels like
[01:40:49.580 --> 01:40:50.980]   we're treating Donald Trump like a seven-year-old
[01:40:50.980 --> 01:40:51.820]   or a nine-year-old.
[01:40:51.820 --> 01:40:52.640]   I think we should treat him like the president
[01:40:52.640 --> 01:40:53.480]   of the United States.
[01:40:53.480 --> 01:40:54.980]   I don't think having a president that has taken, like,
[01:40:54.980 --> 01:40:56.780]   concrete steps to prevent the transfer of power,
[01:40:56.780 --> 01:40:58.140]   which he did with the electorate sham,
[01:40:58.140 --> 01:40:59.620]   which he did with Pence, and which he did
[01:40:59.620 --> 01:41:01.420]   with trying to capitalize on the J6 violence,
[01:41:01.440 --> 01:41:03.080]   a president that's taken concrete steps
[01:41:03.080 --> 01:41:05.320]   towards cooing the government, essentially,
[01:41:05.320 --> 01:41:07.320]   I don't know why that guy, we'd say,
[01:41:07.320 --> 01:41:08.760]   well, you know, it's Trump, he does Trump things.
[01:41:08.760 --> 01:41:09.720]   The guardrail's held.
[01:41:09.720 --> 01:41:10.560]   I'll probably hold next to him.
[01:41:10.560 --> 01:41:12.480]   - So, I mean, when we say we shouldn't,
[01:41:12.480 --> 01:41:15.760]   do you mean that he should be actually barred from office?
[01:41:15.760 --> 01:41:16.720]   - I'm just talking about support for him.
[01:41:16.720 --> 01:41:19.120]   I don't even think Republicans should support Trump.
[01:41:19.120 --> 01:41:20.200]   You lose your incumbent advantage.
[01:41:20.200 --> 01:41:21.440]   The guy's obviously self-destructive.
[01:41:21.440 --> 01:41:24.160]   He's destructed the political party itself, like--
[01:41:24.160 --> 01:41:26.200]   - Do you think he should be on the ballot?
[01:41:26.200 --> 01:41:28.840]   You think there's a case to be made
[01:41:28.840 --> 01:41:30.440]   to remove him from the ballot?
[01:41:30.440 --> 01:41:32.740]   - I think there's a case to be made,
[01:41:32.740 --> 01:41:34.900]   but man, the phrasing, for as much
[01:41:34.900 --> 01:41:37.940]   as our governmental founding fathers and everybody else
[01:41:37.940 --> 01:41:39.500]   wrote nice amendments and wrote nice constitutions,
[01:41:39.500 --> 01:41:41.700]   some of the phrasing is very, very, very blech,
[01:41:41.700 --> 01:41:43.340]   and the section three,
[01:41:43.340 --> 01:41:48.220]   not requiring any type of actual conviction,
[01:41:48.220 --> 01:41:49.700]   I don't have a strong feeling on it.
[01:41:49.700 --> 01:41:51.340]   I will say I'm very interested in reading
[01:41:51.340 --> 01:41:52.860]   the majority opinion from the Supreme Court.
[01:41:52.860 --> 01:41:55.700]   I seriously doubt the Supreme Court is going to uphold
[01:41:55.700 --> 01:41:57.020]   that states should be able to decide
[01:41:57.020 --> 01:41:58.960]   if they leave him off the ballot or not.
[01:41:58.960 --> 01:42:00.900]   I think for the political future of the United States,
[01:42:00.900 --> 01:42:02.100]   it's probably not healthy
[01:42:02.100 --> 01:42:04.060]   that the leading opposition candidate
[01:42:04.060 --> 01:42:05.580]   is now gonna be barred from the ballot.
[01:42:05.580 --> 01:42:07.940]   It's probably not healthy for us,
[01:42:07.940 --> 01:42:08.780]   'cause then what--
[01:42:08.780 --> 01:42:09.860]   - You wanna talk about threats to democracy,
[01:42:09.860 --> 01:42:11.860]   that would be a pretty serious one,
[01:42:11.860 --> 01:42:13.180]   applied across the board, by the way.
[01:42:13.180 --> 01:42:15.620]   - It would be, however, that threat to democracy
[01:42:15.620 --> 01:42:17.140]   was earned by Donald Trump and the conservatives
[01:42:17.140 --> 01:42:17.980]   that supported him.
[01:42:17.980 --> 01:42:19.500]   I think conservatives made a dangerous gamble
[01:42:19.500 --> 01:42:20.620]   when they threw Trump into office,
[01:42:20.620 --> 01:42:22.820]   and now all of the fallout from that
[01:42:22.820 --> 01:42:24.980]   is something that we all, as Americans, have to deal with.
[01:42:24.980 --> 01:42:27.740]   - I mean, I think that the unprecedented legal theory
[01:42:27.740 --> 01:42:29.940]   that a state can simply bar somebody from the ballot
[01:42:29.940 --> 01:42:31.920]   on the basis of, in an informal way,
[01:42:31.920 --> 01:42:34.440]   believing that he is, quote-unquote, an insurrectionist,
[01:42:34.440 --> 01:42:35.980]   is pretty wild.
[01:42:35.980 --> 01:42:36.820]   I mean, that's--
[01:42:36.820 --> 01:42:37.640]   - You can say it's pretty wild,
[01:42:37.640 --> 01:42:38.980]   but there is an amendment in the Constitution,
[01:42:38.980 --> 01:42:39.980]   the 14th Amendment, that says
[01:42:39.980 --> 01:42:41.600]   that if they have engaged in this,
[01:42:41.600 --> 01:42:43.580]   they shall not be, or you shall,
[01:42:43.580 --> 01:42:44.420]   I don't remember the phrasing,
[01:42:44.420 --> 01:42:45.340]   'cause it doesn't require conviction,
[01:42:45.340 --> 01:42:47.220]   but it's a self-executing, arguably, thing.
[01:42:47.220 --> 01:42:48.340]   - If we're getting into constitutional law,
[01:42:48.340 --> 01:42:50.660]   I mean, there are a number of provisions
[01:42:50.660 --> 01:42:52.860]   that suggest that this is, number one, not self-executing.
[01:42:52.860 --> 01:42:53.700]   I mean, minority opinions
[01:42:53.700 --> 01:42:56.540]   in the Colorado Supreme Court case are pretty thorough.
[01:42:56.540 --> 01:42:58.380]   The number one contention,
[01:42:58.380 --> 01:43:00.420]   which is that this is not self-executing
[01:43:00.420 --> 01:43:02.660]   because other elements are not self-executing,
[01:43:02.660 --> 01:43:05.860]   that ignores subsequent actual law that happened.
[01:43:05.860 --> 01:43:08.020]   I mean, Congress passed a law, for example, in 1872,
[01:43:08.020 --> 01:43:09.460]   defining who was an insurrectionist,
[01:43:09.460 --> 01:43:10.300]   who was not an insurrectionist,
[01:43:10.300 --> 01:43:11.780]   for purposes of elections.
[01:43:11.780 --> 01:43:13.360]   In 1994, Congress passed a law
[01:43:13.360 --> 01:43:14.740]   that specifically defined insurrection
[01:43:14.740 --> 01:43:15.580]   as a criminal activity,
[01:43:15.580 --> 01:43:17.700]   so that somebody could theoretically be convicted
[01:43:17.700 --> 01:43:18.740]   of insurrection, and therefore,
[01:43:18.740 --> 01:43:20.460]   ineligible to run for office.
[01:43:20.460 --> 01:43:23.760]   It is unlike, say, the analogs that are used
[01:43:23.760 --> 01:43:26.040]   by the majority opinion, like age.
[01:43:26.040 --> 01:43:27.900]   Obviously, this is not the same thing.
[01:43:27.900 --> 01:43:29.620]   We can all tell what somebody's age is
[01:43:29.620 --> 01:43:30.740]   by looking at their birth certificate.
[01:43:30.740 --> 01:43:32.540]   I can't tell whether somebody's an insurrectionist
[01:43:32.540 --> 01:43:33.980]   without any reference to a legal stature
[01:43:33.980 --> 01:43:35.020]   or a definition of the term.
[01:43:35.020 --> 01:43:35.860]   - I would also be careful with that
[01:43:35.860 --> 01:43:38.380]   because remember, one of Trump's first big political actions
[01:43:38.380 --> 01:43:40.380]   was challenging Obama's birth certificate.
[01:43:40.380 --> 01:43:42.780]   - Well, and I thought that was dumb at the time,
[01:43:42.780 --> 01:43:43.620]   but in any case. - Sure.
[01:43:43.620 --> 01:43:46.240]   - I like that you both said 100% chance
[01:43:46.240 --> 01:43:48.180]   that Trump will try to go for third term
[01:43:48.180 --> 01:43:49.260]   and 0% chance,
[01:43:49.260 --> 01:43:50.180]   which statistically- - Third term?
[01:43:50.180 --> 01:43:51.000]   He's done, man.
[01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:51.840]   Are you kidding?
[01:43:51.840 --> 01:43:52.660]   I even want to.
[01:43:52.660 --> 01:43:53.580]   Trump's gonna walk around- - Try.
[01:43:53.580 --> 01:43:54.420]   - Hands up high.
[01:43:54.420 --> 01:43:55.700]   He's gonna be like, "I'm a two-term president.
[01:43:55.700 --> 01:43:57.240]   I'm the only president since Grover Cleveland."
[01:43:57.240 --> 01:43:58.080]   He wouldn't know.
[01:43:58.080 --> 01:43:59.020]   "But since Grover Cleveland,
[01:43:59.020 --> 01:44:00.700]   who served two non-consecutive terms,
[01:44:00.700 --> 01:44:01.780]   I kicked Joe Biden out of office
[01:44:01.780 --> 01:44:03.100]   and I kicked Hillary Clinton out of office."
[01:44:03.100 --> 01:44:04.780]   Dude would be like, he'd be living large.
[01:44:04.780 --> 01:44:05.620]   You're kidding?
[01:44:05.620 --> 01:44:06.860]   He doesn't want the presidency anymore after that?
[01:44:06.860 --> 01:44:07.700]   - I just think that the,
[01:44:07.700 --> 01:44:09.700]   I think it's scary that like Donald Trump,
[01:44:09.700 --> 01:44:11.340]   it feels like for all of the accusations
[01:44:11.340 --> 01:44:12.840]   that are made sometimes against Democrats,
[01:44:12.840 --> 01:44:14.900]   like Biden is ordering Garland
[01:44:14.900 --> 01:44:17.080]   to investigate Donald Trump and blah, blah, blah.
[01:44:17.080 --> 01:44:19.400]   It seems like Donald Trump would actually do that
[01:44:19.400 --> 01:44:20.900]   with his DOJ, would give them orders.
[01:44:20.900 --> 01:44:21.740]   - He didn't.
[01:44:21.740 --> 01:44:22.560]   He didn't.
[01:44:22.560 --> 01:44:24.580]   He didn't do it with his DOJ. - Well, he kind of did though.
[01:44:24.580 --> 01:44:25.660]   Right?
[01:44:25.660 --> 01:44:28.540]   So for instance, with Jeffrey Clark,
[01:44:28.540 --> 01:44:30.720]   Jeffrey Clark went to Rosen and Donahue and said,
[01:44:30.720 --> 01:44:33.760]   "Hey, listen, I need you guys to sign off on a letter
[01:44:33.760 --> 01:44:35.600]   that we're gonna use essentially to bully states
[01:44:35.600 --> 01:44:36.740]   into overturning their elections
[01:44:36.740 --> 01:44:38.460]   by saying we found significant election fraud."
[01:44:38.460 --> 01:44:40.180]   And part of that threat was Jeffrey Clark saying,
[01:44:40.180 --> 01:44:42.740]   "Listen, if you're not gonna do it, Rosen,
[01:44:42.740 --> 01:44:43.580]   Trump's gonna fire you
[01:44:43.580 --> 01:44:46.060]   and just make me the acting attorney general."
[01:44:46.060 --> 01:44:46.900]   That was the threat that he carried.
[01:44:46.900 --> 01:44:48.060]   And I think Trump repeated that threat
[01:44:48.060 --> 01:44:49.660]   in a meeting later on that was,
[01:44:49.660 --> 01:44:51.860]   I only rebuked when I think like half the White House staff
[01:44:51.860 --> 01:44:52.980]   said, "If you do this, we're resigning."
[01:44:52.980 --> 01:44:54.260]   - Okay, so this is a slightly different topic
[01:44:54.260 --> 01:44:56.380]   because now you're getting into all the election shenanigans
[01:44:56.380 --> 01:44:57.220]   and all of this, but-
[01:44:57.220 --> 01:44:59.620]   - Trump threatened to fire his acting attorney general
[01:44:59.620 --> 01:45:02.020]   if he wouldn't carry the same platform, essentially.
[01:45:02.020 --> 01:45:04.780]   If Trump could order his DOJ to do something, would he?
[01:45:04.780 --> 01:45:08.060]   It's not beyond the pale for him, right?
[01:45:08.060 --> 01:45:09.540]   - It's not beyond the pale for him to order them to do it,
[01:45:09.540 --> 01:45:10.380]   and then it's not beyond the pale
[01:45:10.380 --> 01:45:11.420]   for them to reject him doing that,
[01:45:11.420 --> 01:45:13.000]   which is the story of his entire administration.
[01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:14.660]   Whereas Joe Biden orders his DOJ to do things
[01:45:14.660 --> 01:45:15.500]   and then they just do them.
[01:45:15.500 --> 01:45:18.280]   - Well, we can get into specifics there.
[01:45:18.280 --> 01:45:22.300]   - This is one of the big problems that I have with,
[01:45:22.300 --> 01:45:23.140]   I mean, for example,
[01:45:23.140 --> 01:45:25.620]   the talk about Trump tyrant, Trump executive power.
[01:45:25.620 --> 01:45:27.700]   I mean, Joe Biden has used executive power
[01:45:27.700 --> 01:45:29.260]   in ways that far outstrip anything that Trump-
[01:45:29.260 --> 01:45:31.460]   - Every president has been stretching
[01:45:31.460 --> 01:45:33.260]   and stretching and stretching executive power.
[01:45:33.260 --> 01:45:35.080]   - Joe Biden is going like,
[01:45:35.080 --> 01:45:37.420]   Joe Biden has gone well beyond anything Trump
[01:45:37.420 --> 01:45:38.780]   even remotely attempted to maintain
[01:45:38.780 --> 01:45:40.740]   via just pure executive power.
[01:45:40.740 --> 01:45:42.100]   And actually Trump's use of executive power
[01:45:42.100 --> 01:45:43.300]   is nowhere near even what Obama's was.
[01:45:43.300 --> 01:45:45.700]   - I mean, Trump inability to get border policy passed
[01:45:45.700 --> 01:45:47.060]   literally had him using executive power
[01:45:47.060 --> 01:45:49.220]   to march the military down to the border
[01:45:49.220 --> 01:45:50.380]   to do border policy.
[01:45:50.380 --> 01:45:51.620]   I mean-
[01:45:51.620 --> 01:45:53.740]   - I mean, Joe Biden literally used
[01:45:53.740 --> 01:45:55.900]   the Occupational Safety and Hazard Administration
[01:45:55.900 --> 01:45:58.900]   to try to cram down VAX mandates on 80 million Americans.
[01:45:58.900 --> 01:45:59.820]   That's insane.
[01:45:59.820 --> 01:46:01.940]   He literally said, "I cannot relieve student loan debt,"
[01:46:01.940 --> 01:46:05.460]   and then tried to relieve hundreds of billions of dollars
[01:46:05.460 --> 01:46:06.300]   in student loan debt.
[01:46:06.300 --> 01:46:07.260]   - Yeah, but what happened to that?
[01:46:07.260 --> 01:46:08.220]   - It got struck down by the Supreme Court.
[01:46:08.220 --> 01:46:09.820]   And then they still did it.
[01:46:09.820 --> 01:46:10.700]   They still did it.
[01:46:10.700 --> 01:46:14.500]   Biden brags about it for what he was able to,
[01:46:14.500 --> 01:46:15.500]   for what he was able to relieve,
[01:46:15.500 --> 01:46:16.580]   which I think were related
[01:46:16.580 --> 01:46:17.860]   to particular types of student loan debt.
[01:46:17.860 --> 01:46:18.700]   But I'm just saying that like,
[01:46:18.700 --> 01:46:20.140]   well, the guardrails are holding with Biden
[01:46:20.140 --> 01:46:21.220]   as much as they're holding with Trump.
[01:46:21.220 --> 01:46:22.060]   The only difference is,
[01:46:22.060 --> 01:46:24.180]   is that once Biden exhausts his executive power,
[01:46:24.180 --> 01:46:26.940]   he's not running around like lying to people
[01:46:26.940 --> 01:46:28.420]   or trying to extort people
[01:46:28.420 --> 01:46:31.220]   or trying to concoct insane schemes.
[01:46:31.220 --> 01:46:33.780]   - Well, I mean, so here's the way I would think of this.
[01:46:33.780 --> 01:46:36.620]   Think of the guardrails holding as the filter, okay?
[01:46:36.620 --> 01:46:39.060]   Meaning like the coffee is in the filter.
[01:46:39.060 --> 01:46:39.900]   Some of it's, you know,
[01:46:39.900 --> 01:46:41.380]   what you want is gonna get through and all this stuff.
[01:46:41.380 --> 01:46:43.300]   The guardrails prevent the other stuff from getting through.
[01:46:43.300 --> 01:46:44.140]   Now the question becomes,
[01:46:44.140 --> 01:46:46.300]   what liquid are you pouring into the filter?
[01:46:46.300 --> 01:46:48.460]   Okay, meaning, so if the filter exists,
[01:46:48.460 --> 01:46:49.860]   if the guardrails hold, and if Donald Trump
[01:46:49.860 --> 01:46:50.860]   can't steal elections,
[01:46:50.860 --> 01:46:52.300]   what's the policy that comes through
[01:46:52.300 --> 01:46:53.460]   the other end of the filter?
[01:46:53.460 --> 01:46:54.460]   The policy I get from Donald Trump
[01:46:54.460 --> 01:46:55.300]   on the other end of the filter
[01:46:55.300 --> 01:46:56.340]   is a bunch of stuff that I like.
[01:46:56.340 --> 01:46:57.540]   The policy that I get from Joe Biden
[01:46:57.540 --> 01:46:58.380]   on the other end of the filter
[01:46:58.380 --> 01:46:59.500]   is a bunch of bullshit I don't.
[01:46:59.500 --> 01:47:01.220]   So that's the basic calculation.
[01:47:01.220 --> 01:47:04.380]   - Okay, so then the idea is essentially that
[01:47:04.380 --> 01:47:07.380]   Donald Trump's rhetoric is insane, but we don't care.
[01:47:07.380 --> 01:47:08.300]   Donald Trump would probably try
[01:47:08.300 --> 01:47:09.420]   to steal an election if he could,
[01:47:09.420 --> 01:47:11.180]   but he probably won't be able to.
[01:47:11.180 --> 01:47:13.720]   - He's not gonna do it again, I told you, he's not.
[01:47:13.720 --> 01:47:15.900]   - You don't think he has any, why not?
[01:47:15.900 --> 01:47:17.260]   - Because he won't be eligible
[01:47:17.260 --> 01:47:19.180]   to be on the ballot in, I mean, by the way,
[01:47:19.180 --> 01:47:20.580]   you wanna talk about 14th Amendment?
[01:47:20.580 --> 01:47:22.460]   That's where the 14th Amendment applies.
[01:47:22.460 --> 01:47:23.780]   Okay, that's where it actually applies.
[01:47:23.780 --> 01:47:26.100]   Meaning you cannot, he is not qualified
[01:47:26.100 --> 01:47:28.020]   to be on the ballot in 2028
[01:47:28.020 --> 01:47:29.420]   if he is the President of the United States.
[01:47:29.420 --> 01:47:31.980]   States can literally, in self-executing fashion,
[01:47:31.980 --> 01:47:32.860]   take him off the ballot.
[01:47:32.860 --> 01:47:35.140]   Just like he's past the age of 35,
[01:47:35.140 --> 01:47:36.540]   once you have been President two times,
[01:47:36.540 --> 01:47:37.620]   you're no longer eligible
[01:47:37.620 --> 01:47:39.220]   to be President of the United States.
[01:47:39.220 --> 01:47:40.060]   - Why do you think-- - Then you actually
[01:47:40.060 --> 01:47:40.900]   would have a strong little-- - Yeah, but like--
[01:47:40.900 --> 01:47:41.740]   - To keep him off the ballot.
[01:47:41.740 --> 01:47:44.060]   - Why would the 14th Amendment stop him
[01:47:44.060 --> 01:47:45.180]   if he thought Vice President Pence
[01:47:45.180 --> 01:47:48.380]   could unilaterally decide the outcome of the election?
[01:47:48.380 --> 01:47:49.740]   - When he's not on the ballot?
[01:47:49.740 --> 01:47:52.540]   So now your theory is that he's gonna get reelected,
[01:47:52.540 --> 01:47:54.900]   and then in 2028, he's not even gonna be on the ballot,
[01:47:54.900 --> 01:47:57.540]   and he's gonna direct his new Vice President, Kerry Lake,
[01:47:57.540 --> 01:47:59.820]   to simply declare him President of the United States
[01:47:59.820 --> 01:48:01.180]   when he has not been on a ballot?
[01:48:01.180 --> 01:48:04.060]   - I don't know what the scheme would be.
[01:48:04.060 --> 01:48:05.420]   I think we can kind of like laugh and say
[01:48:05.420 --> 01:48:07.540]   there's no scheme we could even concoct,
[01:48:07.540 --> 01:48:09.580]   but I think that-- - Macho like with the machine gun
[01:48:09.580 --> 01:48:11.540]   he's gonna walk into the-- - I think the issue though
[01:48:11.540 --> 01:48:14.060]   is that like the idea of electing another President
[01:48:14.060 --> 01:48:16.260]   that has tried to circumvent the peaceful transfer of power
[01:48:16.260 --> 01:48:18.180]   using extra legal means, and then pretending like
[01:48:18.180 --> 01:48:20.220]   we can't concoct a single scheme
[01:48:20.220 --> 01:48:23.020]   that he could try to circumvent other legal processes
[01:48:23.020 --> 01:48:25.620]   to have a third term or to have a longer term
[01:48:25.620 --> 01:48:28.380]   or to install who he wants as the next President.
[01:48:28.380 --> 01:48:30.540]   I just, when a person has already shown you who they are,
[01:48:30.540 --> 01:48:33.220]   and when every single person around him agrees with that,
[01:48:33.220 --> 01:48:34.740]   when every single person that's worked with him,
[01:48:34.740 --> 01:48:38.380]   save for the, what, Sidney Powell, Eastman, and Giuliani,
[01:48:38.380 --> 01:48:39.980]   which I don't think even, I don't think anybody
[01:48:39.980 --> 01:48:42.180]   would wanna throw their lot in with those three,
[01:48:42.180 --> 01:48:43.900]   it just seems wild to me that we would say like,
[01:48:43.900 --> 01:48:45.220]   yeah, we're just gonna go ahead and trust this guy
[01:48:45.220 --> 01:48:46.620]   with another term of President,
[01:48:46.620 --> 01:48:48.460]   but like he can't run for a third term, so it's fine,
[01:48:48.460 --> 01:48:50.060]   when there's like 50 million other things--
[01:48:50.060 --> 01:48:51.380]   - And I'll make you the case that if you want him
[01:48:51.380 --> 01:48:52.220]   not to make election trouble,
[01:48:52.220 --> 01:48:54.620]   you should elect him President in the next election cycle,
[01:48:54.620 --> 01:48:56.180]   and then he will be ineligible.
[01:48:56.180 --> 01:48:58.220]   - That, okay, well, I find that to be
[01:48:58.220 --> 01:49:00.540]   a wholly unconvincing argument, but okay.
[01:49:00.540 --> 01:49:03.020]   - Well, recently in the news,
[01:49:03.020 --> 01:49:06.540]   the Presidents of Harvard, Penn, and MIT
[01:49:06.540 --> 01:49:10.140]   failed to fully denounce calls for genocide,
[01:49:10.140 --> 01:49:13.060]   and that rose questions about the influence
[01:49:13.060 --> 01:49:15.580]   of DEI programs at universities,
[01:49:15.580 --> 01:49:17.940]   and so maybe either looking at this,
[01:49:17.940 --> 01:49:21.220]   or zooming out more broadly at identity politics
[01:49:21.220 --> 01:49:23.540]   at universities, or identity politics,
[01:49:23.540 --> 01:49:27.860]   wokeism in our culture, how big of a threat is it
[01:49:27.860 --> 01:49:30.500]   to our culture, to Western civilization?
[01:49:30.500 --> 01:49:32.180]   - So obviously, I'm gonna say it's a huge threat.
[01:49:32.180 --> 01:49:33.700]   The reason that I think there's a huge threat,
[01:49:33.700 --> 01:49:35.180]   I wanna give a definition of wokeism,
[01:49:35.180 --> 01:49:36.580]   because people are very often accused
[01:49:36.580 --> 01:49:38.220]   of not using wokeism properly,
[01:49:38.220 --> 01:49:39.980]   or believing that it's sort of a catch-all phrase.
[01:49:39.980 --> 01:49:41.260]   I don't think it's a catch-all term.
[01:49:41.260 --> 01:49:45.620]   I think that wokeism has its roots in postmodernism,
[01:49:45.620 --> 01:49:49.580]   which essentially suggests that every principle
[01:49:49.580 --> 01:49:53.540]   is a reflection of underlying structures of power,
[01:49:53.540 --> 01:49:56.980]   and that therefore, any inequality that emerges
[01:49:56.980 --> 01:49:59.420]   under such a system is a reflection, again,
[01:49:59.420 --> 01:50:01.100]   of that structure of power.
[01:50:01.100 --> 01:50:02.780]   That used to be applied in sort of Marxist ways,
[01:50:02.780 --> 01:50:04.860]   the suggestion being that economic inequality
[01:50:04.860 --> 01:50:07.460]   was the result of misallocation of power
[01:50:07.460 --> 01:50:11.620]   in the structure preserved by an upper crust of people
[01:50:11.620 --> 01:50:13.420]   who wanted to cram down exploitation on people.
[01:50:13.420 --> 01:50:15.860]   That was sort of the Marxist version of postmodernism,
[01:50:15.860 --> 01:50:18.540]   and then got transmuted into sort of a racial version
[01:50:18.540 --> 01:50:21.100]   of postmodernism, in which the systems of the United States
[01:50:21.100 --> 01:50:23.540]   are white supremacist in orientation,
[01:50:23.540 --> 01:50:26.140]   and are perpetuated by a group of people
[01:50:26.140 --> 01:50:29.100]   who are, in fact, in favor of the preservation
[01:50:29.100 --> 01:50:30.700]   of white power and white supremacy.
[01:50:30.700 --> 01:50:34.220]   That is the generalized theory of critical race theory,
[01:50:34.220 --> 01:50:37.180]   as proposed by, for example, Jean Stefanczyk,
[01:50:37.180 --> 01:50:41.100]   and Richard Delgado in their book on critical race theory.
[01:50:41.100 --> 01:50:45.340]   That has taken a softer form that we refer to as DEI.
[01:50:45.340 --> 01:50:47.780]   The key in DEI is the E, meaning equity.
[01:50:47.780 --> 01:50:50.860]   So equity is a term that does not mean equality.
[01:50:50.860 --> 01:50:51.700]   People mix it up.
[01:50:51.700 --> 01:50:55.180]   Equality is the idea that we all ought to have equal rights,
[01:50:55.180 --> 01:50:58.500]   that we all ought to be treated equally by the law.
[01:50:58.500 --> 01:51:00.580]   Equity is the idea that if there is an inequality
[01:51:00.580 --> 01:51:01.700]   that emerges from any system,
[01:51:01.700 --> 01:51:03.380]   it is therefore due to discrimination.
[01:51:03.380 --> 01:51:05.060]   And the best way to tell whether somebody
[01:51:05.060 --> 01:51:08.340]   has been victimized is by dint of their race.
[01:51:08.340 --> 01:51:09.540]   And we can tell whether you're a member
[01:51:09.540 --> 01:51:11.300]   of an oppressed group or an oppressor group
[01:51:11.300 --> 01:51:15.380]   by the intersectional identity that you carry,
[01:51:15.380 --> 01:51:18.860]   and by the nature of your group's success or failure,
[01:51:18.860 --> 01:51:20.980]   predominantly along economic and power lines
[01:51:20.980 --> 01:51:22.300]   in American life.
[01:51:22.300 --> 01:51:24.180]   This means that if one group
[01:51:24.180 --> 01:51:26.420]   is predominantly successful economically,
[01:51:26.420 --> 01:51:29.060]   they must be a member of the victimizing class.
[01:51:29.060 --> 01:51:31.060]   And the only corrective for that would be,
[01:51:31.060 --> 01:51:33.460]   as Ibram X. Kendi likes to suggest,
[01:51:33.460 --> 01:51:35.740]   effectively, anti-racist policy is racism
[01:51:35.740 --> 01:51:37.460]   in the service of destroying racism,
[01:51:37.460 --> 01:51:40.980]   that you're going to have to discriminate
[01:51:40.980 --> 01:51:42.660]   on the basis of race in order to correct
[01:51:42.660 --> 01:51:45.260]   for discrimination that's baked into the system.
[01:51:45.260 --> 01:51:46.700]   That's incredibly dangerous.
[01:51:46.700 --> 01:51:48.580]   It leads to a victim-victimizer narrative
[01:51:48.580 --> 01:51:50.020]   that is unhealthy for individuals
[01:51:50.020 --> 01:51:51.380]   and terrible for societies.
[01:51:51.380 --> 01:51:54.180]   It relieves people of individual responsibility,
[01:51:54.180 --> 01:51:58.500]   and it destroys the very notion of an objective metric
[01:51:58.500 --> 01:52:00.020]   by which we can decide meritocracy.
[01:52:00.020 --> 01:52:01.380]   And meritocracy is the only system
[01:52:01.380 --> 01:52:02.940]   human beings have ever devised
[01:52:02.940 --> 01:52:04.300]   that has positive externalities
[01:52:04.300 --> 01:52:06.260]   in literally any area of life.
[01:52:06.260 --> 01:52:09.700]   Every other distribution of wealth, power,
[01:52:09.700 --> 01:52:10.940]   done along other lines
[01:52:10.940 --> 01:52:12.900]   that is not having to do with merit
[01:52:12.900 --> 01:52:14.380]   has negative externalities.
[01:52:14.380 --> 01:52:15.540]   Every system having to do with merit
[01:52:15.540 --> 01:52:16.700]   has positive externalities
[01:52:16.700 --> 01:52:18.980]   because presumably the most effective and useful people
[01:52:18.980 --> 01:52:20.380]   are going to succeed under those systems.
[01:52:20.380 --> 01:52:22.220]   That's the very basis of a meritocracy.
[01:52:22.220 --> 01:52:24.420]   And the externalities of that mean
[01:52:24.420 --> 01:52:26.740]   that other people benefit from the meritorious
[01:52:26.740 --> 01:52:28.940]   and excellent performance of those people.
[01:52:28.940 --> 01:52:31.420]   - Maybe you'd be good to get your comments,
[01:52:31.420 --> 01:52:33.100]   you're all stomping ground Harvard.
[01:52:33.100 --> 01:52:34.660]   Do you think the president of Harvard
[01:52:34.660 --> 01:52:36.340]   should have been fired?
[01:52:36.340 --> 01:52:37.340]   - I mean, I think she should have been fired
[01:52:37.340 --> 01:52:38.620]   not over the plagiarism allegations.
[01:52:38.620 --> 01:52:39.900]   I think she should have been fired
[01:52:39.900 --> 01:52:44.580]   based on her performance just at that congressional hearing.
[01:52:44.580 --> 01:52:48.060]   If the word black had been substituted for Jew
[01:52:48.060 --> 01:52:50.820]   in that statement by Elise Stefanik
[01:52:50.820 --> 01:52:51.900]   that she was asking about-- - Or trans.
[01:52:51.900 --> 01:52:54.700]   - Or trans, or literally any other minority in America,
[01:52:54.700 --> 01:52:56.300]   maybe with the exception of Asian,
[01:52:56.300 --> 01:52:57.780]   then the answer would have been very different
[01:52:57.780 --> 01:52:59.660]   coming from clouding gay.
[01:52:59.660 --> 01:53:01.380]   With that said, I don't think the firing of clouding gay
[01:53:01.380 --> 01:53:02.860]   really accomplishes very much.
[01:53:02.860 --> 01:53:04.900]   Did she get what she deserved?
[01:53:04.900 --> 01:53:05.740]   Sure.
[01:53:05.740 --> 01:53:09.540]   Does that mean that the underlying DEI equity-based system
[01:53:09.540 --> 01:53:10.980]   has been in any way severely damaged?
[01:53:10.980 --> 01:53:14.260]   No, I think that this is a way for universities,
[01:53:14.260 --> 01:53:15.820]   as truthful as McGillipan also,
[01:53:15.820 --> 01:53:19.980]   to basically throw somebody overboard as the sacrifice
[01:53:19.980 --> 01:53:21.660]   to maintain the underlying system
[01:53:21.660 --> 01:53:23.900]   that continues to predominate at American universities
[01:53:23.900 --> 01:53:25.380]   where they spend literally billions of dollars
[01:53:25.380 --> 01:53:28.580]   every year on DEI initiatives and diversity hires
[01:53:28.580 --> 01:53:31.020]   and diversity administrators and all of this.
[01:53:31.020 --> 01:53:33.100]   And one of the cost of education escalating
[01:53:33.100 --> 01:53:35.900]   is in the massive administrative function
[01:53:35.900 --> 01:53:38.500]   that is now undertaken by universities
[01:53:38.500 --> 01:53:42.380]   as opposed to teaching and cost of dorms and such.
[01:53:42.380 --> 01:53:44.660]   - You guys probably agree on a lot of this, right?
[01:53:44.660 --> 01:53:45.820]   - Kind of, maybe, yeah.
[01:53:45.820 --> 01:53:50.740]   I don't know what makes things do this,
[01:53:50.740 --> 01:53:52.860]   but it feels like we can never have a good thing
[01:53:52.860 --> 01:53:55.380]   and then have it end as a good thing.
[01:53:55.380 --> 01:53:58.540]   Things always get taken to their extreme,
[01:53:58.540 --> 01:54:00.740]   and then we have to fight on those extremes.
[01:54:00.740 --> 01:54:03.060]   I would argue that, back in my day,
[01:54:03.060 --> 01:54:05.060]   we called it SJWs, Social Justice Warriors,
[01:54:05.060 --> 01:54:08.380]   before it became WOKE, I think like 2013 onwards, whatever.
[01:54:08.380 --> 01:54:10.780]   There are aspects to WOKEism that I think are good.
[01:54:10.780 --> 01:54:12.540]   I like the additional representation
[01:54:12.540 --> 01:54:13.380]   that we have in media now.
[01:54:13.380 --> 01:54:15.780]   I like how, as much as people complain about the internet
[01:54:15.780 --> 01:54:16.620]   and how it's regulated,
[01:54:16.620 --> 01:54:17.620]   that there are way more groups
[01:54:17.620 --> 01:54:18.940]   that are represented on the internet,
[01:54:18.940 --> 01:54:22.020]   whether we're talking X, the platform formerly known
[01:54:22.020 --> 01:54:24.540]   as Twitter or Facebook or whatever.
[01:54:24.540 --> 01:54:25.380]   I think in some ways,
[01:54:25.380 --> 01:54:27.780]   or whether we're pushing women's achievements in school
[01:54:27.780 --> 01:54:29.860]   and in the wider workforce,
[01:54:29.860 --> 01:54:31.860]   I think that these are all good things.
[01:54:31.860 --> 01:54:33.180]   The issue that you run into
[01:54:33.180 --> 01:54:35.580]   is people don't ever have a stopping point,
[01:54:35.580 --> 01:54:37.140]   and I think people kind of get lost
[01:54:37.140 --> 01:54:39.600]   in this WOKE for WOKE's sake thing,
[01:54:39.600 --> 01:54:42.380]   where we start to see these very weird warpings
[01:54:42.380 --> 01:54:45.640]   of these academic, I guess, arguments
[01:54:45.640 --> 01:54:48.500]   that are used for really horrible things.
[01:54:48.500 --> 01:54:50.100]   So for instance, I think that you can talk about,
[01:54:50.100 --> 01:54:52.420]   in the United States, things like white supremacy
[01:54:52.420 --> 01:54:55.300]   or things like oppression or certain demographics,
[01:54:55.300 --> 01:54:57.140]   especially with Jim Crow laws and pre-Jim Crow,
[01:54:57.140 --> 01:54:58.660]   and you can even talk about effects from that.
[01:54:58.660 --> 01:55:00.140]   But then when you run into this weird world
[01:55:00.140 --> 01:55:01.440]   where we've kind of warped these things
[01:55:01.440 --> 01:55:03.300]   so that not only is white supremacy
[01:55:03.300 --> 01:55:05.060]   still as present today as it ever has been,
[01:55:05.060 --> 01:55:07.120]   well, actually, black people and other minorities
[01:55:07.120 --> 01:55:08.100]   can't even be racist.
[01:55:08.100 --> 01:55:08.940]   They don't have the power to
[01:55:08.940 --> 01:55:11.100]   because we're gonna use a different definition of racism,
[01:55:11.100 --> 01:55:12.780]   and we can only talk about punching up
[01:55:12.780 --> 01:55:14.340]   as opposed to punching down,
[01:55:14.340 --> 01:55:15.820]   and we're actually gonna say it's totally okay
[01:55:15.820 --> 01:55:17.320]   for these people to say or do whatever they want,
[01:55:17.320 --> 01:55:19.100]   and it's never bad, but white people
[01:55:19.100 --> 01:55:20.260]   who have always been the oppressors,
[01:55:20.260 --> 01:55:21.460]   even if you're a trailer park guy
[01:55:21.460 --> 01:55:23.020]   whose family's addicted to meth,
[01:55:23.020 --> 01:55:24.620]   you have all this privilege, et cetera, et cetera,
[01:55:24.620 --> 01:55:26.100]   I think that you run into these issues
[01:55:26.100 --> 01:55:28.260]   where at WOKEism, it starts off as a really good idea,
[01:55:28.260 --> 01:55:29.980]   and I would argue has achieved really good things,
[01:55:29.980 --> 01:55:32.100]   especially in regards to women's education and everything,
[01:55:32.100 --> 01:55:34.540]   and then it just gets so academia-i-e,
[01:55:34.540 --> 01:55:36.340]   so there's a word there, academic whatever,
[01:55:36.340 --> 01:55:38.060]   where you take something and you put it into school too much
[01:55:38.060 --> 01:55:40.140]   and then it comes out as some Frankenstein,
[01:55:40.140 --> 01:55:42.060]   cancer baby of horrible things,
[01:55:42.060 --> 01:55:43.940]   such that today, when I'm reading stuff,
[01:55:43.940 --> 01:55:45.340]   and I know Ben is the same way,
[01:55:45.340 --> 01:55:47.900]   if I even hear somebody say the word anti-racism,
[01:55:47.900 --> 01:55:50.460]   I'm probably ignoring every other thing you have to say.
[01:55:50.460 --> 01:55:52.860]   If you utter the word colonial anything,
[01:55:52.860 --> 01:55:53.700]   I'm probably gonna say
[01:55:53.700 --> 01:55:56.060]   you probably don't have anything good to say.
[01:55:57.100 --> 01:55:59.820]   Yeah, a lot of it is just taken way too far,
[01:55:59.820 --> 01:56:01.980]   but you know what I will blame on some of this
[01:56:01.980 --> 01:56:04.280]   is I will blame conservatives for some of this,
[01:56:04.280 --> 01:56:05.700]   because I think one issue that happens,
[01:56:05.700 --> 01:56:07.540]   and I think Ben might even agree with me here too,
[01:56:07.540 --> 01:56:09.900]   is I think there's two huge problems
[01:56:09.900 --> 01:56:11.180]   that have happened in the United States,
[01:56:11.180 --> 01:56:12.420]   I think broadly speaking,
[01:56:12.420 --> 01:56:14.660]   is that one, we've become more different
[01:56:14.660 --> 01:56:15.860]   than we ever have been,
[01:56:15.860 --> 01:56:18.460]   and two, we've become more similar than we ever have been,
[01:56:18.460 --> 01:56:20.060]   and when I say this, what I mean is that
[01:56:20.060 --> 01:56:21.740]   we're splitting off into these groups,
[01:56:21.740 --> 01:56:23.060]   and then these groups are enforcing
[01:56:23.060 --> 01:56:26.340]   this insane homogeneity between these two separate groups,
[01:56:26.340 --> 01:56:27.780]   and I think one of these schisms
[01:56:27.780 --> 01:56:29.460]   has been conservatives' reluctancy
[01:56:29.460 --> 01:56:32.940]   to participate in things related to higher education.
[01:56:32.940 --> 01:56:34.620]   So for a long time, conservatives are saying like,
[01:56:34.620 --> 01:56:37.100]   oh, you know, the educational institutions are against us,
[01:56:37.100 --> 01:56:38.140]   you know, Rush Limbaugh talks about
[01:56:38.140 --> 01:56:39.740]   how evil the colleges are, and blah, blah, blah,
[01:56:39.740 --> 01:56:41.220]   and then what happens is is conservatives
[01:56:41.220 --> 01:56:43.080]   are less and less willing to engage in them,
[01:56:43.080 --> 01:56:45.360]   so then you get this scenario, or this environment,
[01:56:45.360 --> 01:56:48.540]   where everybody that's engaged in academia
[01:56:48.540 --> 01:56:52.500]   on the administrative side are fucking insane.
[01:56:52.500 --> 01:56:54.360]   They're, like, even more so to,
[01:56:54.360 --> 01:56:55.300]   and I also wanna draw a distinction
[01:56:55.300 --> 01:56:57.580]   between the administrators and the faculty,
[01:56:57.580 --> 01:56:58.860]   because oftentimes when you're reading
[01:56:58.860 --> 01:57:01.540]   story after story after story of all of these insane admins
[01:57:01.540 --> 01:57:02.820]   that are pushing further and further left,
[01:57:02.820 --> 01:57:04.900]   usually the faculty is fighting against it.
[01:57:04.900 --> 01:57:06.300]   A lot of the tenured professors,
[01:57:06.300 --> 01:57:07.720]   a lot of people in their departments are saying like,
[01:57:07.720 --> 01:57:09.660]   hold on, well, we actually don't agree with this,
[01:57:09.660 --> 01:57:11.660]   but I feel like because conservatives for so long
[01:57:11.660 --> 01:57:14.220]   have demonized these institutions,
[01:57:14.220 --> 01:57:17.140]   rather than critically evaluated them
[01:57:17.140 --> 01:57:19.900]   and tried to have honest critique and engagement,
[01:57:19.900 --> 01:57:21.860]   that they've just completely broken off,
[01:57:21.860 --> 01:57:23.540]   and when you only have a bunch of lefties
[01:57:23.540 --> 01:57:24.980]   or righties together, all they'll do
[01:57:24.980 --> 01:57:28.420]   is they'll veer off even more into their insane directions.
[01:57:28.420 --> 01:57:29.540]   I feel like that's a big problem
[01:57:29.540 --> 01:57:30.640]   that we've run into in the country,
[01:57:30.640 --> 01:57:32.760]   to where conservatives have totally broken off
[01:57:32.760 --> 01:57:34.660]   some conversations, broken away from,
[01:57:34.660 --> 01:57:36.220]   where they won't participate in them anymore,
[01:57:36.220 --> 01:57:37.260]   and then the people that you have left
[01:57:37.260 --> 01:57:39.700]   just run as far to the left as possible.
[01:57:39.700 --> 01:57:41.220]   - Certainly when you look at certain institutions,
[01:57:41.220 --> 01:57:42.220]   I think that one of the things
[01:57:42.220 --> 01:57:43.500]   that people on both sides of the aisle
[01:57:43.500 --> 01:57:44.980]   are constantly looking at is,
[01:57:44.980 --> 01:57:46.920]   has the institution suffered such capture
[01:57:46.920 --> 01:57:49.540]   that there is just no capacity to fix it?
[01:57:49.540 --> 01:57:51.400]   And when you talk about the universities,
[01:57:51.400 --> 01:57:52.420]   I'm not gonna blame conservatives
[01:57:52.420 --> 01:57:53.700]   for the failure of the universities,
[01:57:53.700 --> 01:57:55.100]   because they haven't been present
[01:57:55.100 --> 01:57:57.100]   in major positions at universities
[01:57:57.100 --> 01:57:59.220]   since effectively the late 1960s.
[01:57:59.220 --> 01:58:01.820]   And you can go read Shelby Steele's work on this,
[01:58:01.820 --> 01:58:04.500]   where he talks about how he used to be,
[01:58:04.500 --> 01:58:06.580]   he's now a conservative black person,
[01:58:06.580 --> 01:58:08.700]   he was a liberal black person at the time,
[01:58:08.700 --> 01:58:10.940]   and he was actually quite a radical black activist
[01:58:10.940 --> 01:58:12.180]   at the time in the '60s,
[01:58:12.180 --> 01:58:14.640]   and he talks about walking into the office
[01:58:14.640 --> 01:58:16.940]   of liberal administrators, who are largely on his side
[01:58:16.940 --> 01:58:20.220]   with regard to civil rights, and being a radical,
[01:58:20.220 --> 01:58:21.980]   him claiming that the systems of the university
[01:58:21.980 --> 01:58:24.900]   were inherently broken, were inherently wrong, unfixable,
[01:58:24.900 --> 01:58:27.700]   and he talks about this, it's a very evocative episode,
[01:58:27.700 --> 01:58:29.060]   where he's talking about how he's smoking,
[01:58:29.060 --> 01:58:32.620]   and as he's smoking, the ash is growing more and more,
[01:58:32.620 --> 01:58:34.820]   and the ash falls down on this very expensive carpet.
[01:58:34.820 --> 01:58:36.940]   And the president of the university,
[01:58:36.940 --> 01:58:38.820]   who's listening to him rant and rave,
[01:58:38.820 --> 01:58:40.580]   he, Shelby Steele says,
[01:58:40.580 --> 01:58:41.960]   "I thought he was gonna say something about this,
[01:58:41.960 --> 01:58:44.020]   "I mean, I was wrecking like a thousand dollar carpet
[01:58:44.020 --> 01:58:45.720]   "in his office being a jackass,
[01:58:45.720 --> 01:58:47.980]   "and instead, I could see him wilt inside,
[01:58:47.980 --> 01:58:48.800]   "I could see him collapse,
[01:58:48.800 --> 01:58:50.720]   "he didn't have the institutional credibility
[01:58:50.720 --> 01:58:54.700]   "or sort of the spiritual strength to just say,
[01:58:54.700 --> 01:58:56.060]   "listen, I agree with you on some of these things,
[01:58:56.060 --> 01:58:57.820]   "but you're acting like a jackass."
[01:58:57.820 --> 01:59:00.460]   And what you see in the late 1960s and early 1970s
[01:59:00.460 --> 01:59:02.580]   is, in fact, the collapse of these institutions,
[01:59:02.580 --> 01:59:04.540]   to the point where, by the time I was going to college,
[01:59:04.540 --> 01:59:06.620]   there was this radical disproportion
[01:59:06.620 --> 01:59:07.860]   between conservatives and liberals.
[01:59:07.860 --> 01:59:09.620]   And the problem is that when it comes to a system
[01:59:09.620 --> 01:59:11.500]   like the universities, basically,
[01:59:11.500 --> 01:59:12.500]   you have to separate the universities off
[01:59:12.500 --> 01:59:13.500]   into two separate categories.
[01:59:13.500 --> 01:59:15.180]   One is STEM, where the universities
[01:59:15.180 --> 01:59:16.460]   are still pretty damn good.
[01:59:16.460 --> 01:59:18.180]   American universities, when it comes to STEM,
[01:59:18.180 --> 01:59:20.300]   are still leading universities in the world.
[01:59:20.300 --> 01:59:22.160]   Harvard's main creations these days
[01:59:22.160 --> 01:59:24.700]   are coming from actual hard science fields.
[01:59:24.700 --> 01:59:26.700]   Then you have the liberal arts field,
[01:59:26.700 --> 01:59:29.040]   in which you basically have a self-perpetuating elite,
[01:59:29.040 --> 01:59:31.200]   because that's actually how dissertations work.
[01:59:31.200 --> 01:59:32.700]   If you have somebody who's very far to the left,
[01:59:32.700 --> 01:59:34.100]   and you decide that you're gonna write a dissertation
[01:59:34.100 --> 01:59:35.540]   on the history of American gun rights,
[01:59:35.540 --> 01:59:37.100]   the chances that that is going to be approved
[01:59:37.100 --> 01:59:38.860]   by your dissertation advisor are much lower
[01:59:38.860 --> 01:59:39.940]   than if you happen to write something
[01:59:39.940 --> 01:59:42.220]   that tends to agree with the political positions
[01:59:42.220 --> 01:59:43.260]   of your dissertation advisor.
[01:59:43.260 --> 01:59:46.380]   Now, listen, I think there are open and tolerant professors,
[01:59:46.380 --> 01:59:48.140]   even in the liberal arts at these universities.
[01:59:48.140 --> 01:59:49.620]   I went to these universities, I went to UCLA,
[01:59:49.620 --> 01:59:50.740]   I went to Harvard Law School.
[01:59:50.740 --> 01:59:51.640]   When I was at Harvard Law School,
[01:59:51.640 --> 01:59:53.580]   one of my favorite professors was Lani Guinier.
[01:59:53.580 --> 01:59:55.100]   Lani Guinier, they tried to appoint her,
[01:59:55.100 --> 01:59:57.300]   I believe, Secretary of Labor under Clinton,
[01:59:57.300 --> 01:59:59.300]   and she was too liberal, and she got rejected.
[01:59:59.300 --> 02:00:00.580]   So she was like a full-on communist.
[02:00:00.580 --> 02:00:01.980]   By the time I went there, she was great.
[02:00:01.980 --> 02:00:03.560]   We had debates every day, it was wonderful.
[02:00:03.560 --> 02:00:05.120]   She used to write me recommendations
[02:00:05.120 --> 02:00:07.020]   for my legal jobs after we left.
[02:00:07.020 --> 02:00:08.900]   Randall Kennedy, I don't agree with him very much.
[02:00:08.900 --> 02:00:10.560]   Randall Kennedy was a terrific professor.
[02:00:10.560 --> 02:00:11.900]   There are some professors who are like this.
[02:00:11.900 --> 02:00:15.140]   Unfortunately, there tends to be, in these echo chambers,
[02:00:15.140 --> 02:00:17.860]   more and more ideological conformity
[02:00:17.860 --> 02:00:19.300]   that is rigorously enforced,
[02:00:19.300 --> 02:00:20.780]   and it is by left on left.
[02:00:20.780 --> 02:00:23.100]   So for example, when I was at Harvard Law School,
[02:00:23.100 --> 02:00:24.900]   the president of the university was another president
[02:00:24.900 --> 02:00:26.480]   who ended up being ousted, Larry Summers.
[02:00:26.480 --> 02:00:28.460]   Larry Summers had been the Secretary of Treasury
[02:00:28.460 --> 02:00:30.980]   under Bill Clinton, and he made the critical error
[02:00:30.980 --> 02:00:32.960]   of suggesting that perhaps the dearth of women
[02:00:32.960 --> 02:00:35.060]   in hard sciences in prestigious positions
[02:00:35.060 --> 02:00:37.460]   was due to possibly two factors
[02:00:37.460 --> 02:00:38.880]   that people were refusing to talk about.
[02:00:38.880 --> 02:00:41.100]   One was the possibility that women
[02:00:41.100 --> 02:00:42.940]   actually didn't want to be in hard sciences
[02:00:42.940 --> 02:00:45.460]   at nearly the rates that men do, which happens to be true.
[02:00:45.460 --> 02:00:49.340]   And two was the distribution of STEM IQ,
[02:00:49.340 --> 02:00:50.380]   which is something that you certainly
[02:00:50.380 --> 02:00:51.260]   were not allowed to talk about.
[02:00:51.260 --> 02:00:54.380]   The idea that the men's bell curve when it comes to IQ,
[02:00:54.380 --> 02:00:55.500]   particularly on STEM subjects,
[02:00:55.500 --> 02:00:57.060]   tends to be shallower than the women's bell curve.
[02:00:57.060 --> 02:00:58.380]   So when you get to the very end of the bell curve,
[02:00:58.380 --> 02:01:00.340]   what you tend to see is a lot of really dumb guys
[02:01:00.340 --> 02:01:01.460]   and a lot of really smart guys.
[02:01:01.460 --> 02:01:03.340]   And so when you're talking about the top universities,
[02:01:03.340 --> 02:01:05.820]   maybe that has something to do with the disproportion.
[02:01:05.820 --> 02:01:07.500]   And he's trying to explain that to say
[02:01:07.500 --> 02:01:08.880]   that our systems are not discriminating.
[02:01:08.880 --> 02:01:10.000]   If we end up with more men than women,
[02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:12.220]   maybe more men are applying and more men are qualified.
[02:01:12.220 --> 02:01:15.980]   He was ousted for that by a left-wing faculty
[02:01:15.980 --> 02:01:20.780]   and general alum network at Harvard University.
[02:01:20.780 --> 02:01:22.060]   There's a lot to blame conservatives for
[02:01:22.060 --> 02:01:23.140]   for surrendering the playing field.
[02:01:23.140 --> 02:01:24.460]   I totally agree that conservatives
[02:01:24.460 --> 02:01:25.900]   should not have surrendered the playing field
[02:01:25.900 --> 02:01:27.100]   in some institutions.
[02:01:27.100 --> 02:01:29.300]   Colleges were surrendered a lot earlier than 20 years ago.
[02:01:29.300 --> 02:01:31.900]   They were surrendered in the late 1960s, early 1970s.
[02:01:31.900 --> 02:01:34.020]   - Yeah, so I think that a couple of things.
[02:01:34.020 --> 02:01:36.340]   So one of the big issues that I have
[02:01:36.340 --> 02:01:38.180]   with kind of like this, I don't know if we call it
[02:01:38.180 --> 02:01:40.380]   era of Trumpism or populism,
[02:01:40.380 --> 02:01:42.900]   is this total disregard for institutions
[02:01:42.900 --> 02:01:45.620]   and this disconnect from participation in the system.
[02:01:45.620 --> 02:01:46.580]   So it's one of the big things that I felt
[02:01:46.580 --> 02:01:48.160]   with progressives about, who cares,
[02:01:48.160 --> 02:01:49.960]   'cause they're all 20 years old, they don't vote anyway.
[02:01:49.960 --> 02:01:51.100]   But it's another thing that I noticed
[02:01:51.100 --> 02:01:54.300]   with a lot of people that are Trump voters,
[02:01:54.300 --> 02:01:56.700]   Trump fans or whatever, is this idea
[02:01:56.700 --> 02:02:00.160]   where we say this institution is irrevocably destroyed.
[02:02:00.160 --> 02:02:02.100]   It's irredeemable, it can't be saved,
[02:02:02.100 --> 02:02:03.920]   nothing that we do can fix it.
[02:02:03.920 --> 02:02:06.580]   And I think that what that leads people to doing
[02:02:06.580 --> 02:02:08.220]   is one, they disconnect further,
[02:02:08.220 --> 02:02:11.020]   and then two, there's a general hopelessness
[02:02:11.020 --> 02:02:13.460]   when it comes to how society is like ran or structured,
[02:02:13.460 --> 02:02:15.380]   such that you fall into that populist brain rot
[02:02:15.380 --> 02:02:17.500]   of the only person that can save me is Donald Trump,
[02:02:17.500 --> 02:02:19.300]   I can't trust literally anything.
[02:02:19.300 --> 02:02:21.080]   And I think that when you start driving people
[02:02:21.080 --> 02:02:24.020]   into that direction, all it does is it further amplifies
[02:02:24.020 --> 02:02:25.900]   all the problems that you're complaining about.
[02:02:25.900 --> 02:02:27.740]   So that's one of the reasons why when we talk
[02:02:27.740 --> 02:02:29.100]   about like conservative participation,
[02:02:29.100 --> 02:02:31.100]   I want there to be more conservatives
[02:02:31.100 --> 02:02:32.460]   that are trying to participate in academia,
[02:02:32.460 --> 02:02:34.320]   but I feel like the leading thought
[02:02:34.320 --> 02:02:36.340]   or the leading speaking out against it
[02:02:36.340 --> 02:02:37.500]   is basically saying it's a waste of time,
[02:02:37.500 --> 02:02:38.340]   it's completely lost.
[02:02:38.340 --> 02:02:39.740]   - So I think that the alternative to that
[02:02:39.740 --> 02:02:41.660]   is that you're seeing on the right,
[02:02:41.660 --> 02:02:43.860]   a growth of, for example, alternative universities.
[02:02:43.860 --> 02:02:45.220]   - Yeah, but that's the worst thing.
[02:02:45.220 --> 02:02:46.300]   - No, I don't think so at all.
[02:02:46.300 --> 02:02:48.520]   I think competition is a great way of incentivizing
[02:02:48.520 --> 02:02:50.420]   some change on behalf of universities
[02:02:50.420 --> 02:02:51.740]   that may have forgotten that there's an entire
[02:02:51.740 --> 02:02:54.060]   another side of the aisle in the United States.
[02:02:54.060 --> 02:02:55.140]   - No, no shot.
[02:02:55.140 --> 02:02:56.940]   I don't believe even, I don't think even you think that.
[02:02:56.940 --> 02:02:58.900]   - So first of all, first of all, let me be clear.
[02:02:58.900 --> 02:03:00.900]   I think the entire educational system at the upper levels,
[02:03:00.900 --> 02:03:02.260]   if you're not in STEM is a complete scam.
[02:03:02.260 --> 02:03:03.220]   I think it's a complete waste of money.
[02:03:03.220 --> 02:03:04.240]   I think it's a complete waste of time.
[02:03:04.240 --> 02:03:05.700]   And I think that it's all it is,
[02:03:05.700 --> 02:03:08.060]   is a formalized, very expensive sorting mechanism
[02:03:08.060 --> 02:03:09.100]   for people of IQ.
[02:03:09.100 --> 02:03:09.940]   That's all it is.
[02:03:09.940 --> 02:03:11.900]   People take an SAT, you go to a good school,
[02:03:11.900 --> 02:03:13.060]   you take four years of bullshit.
[02:03:13.060 --> 02:03:14.420]   I know I did at UCLA.
[02:03:14.420 --> 02:03:16.740]   And then we analyze based on your degree,
[02:03:16.740 --> 02:03:18.380]   where you should go to law school.
[02:03:18.380 --> 02:03:20.740]   I could have gone directly from high school to law school
[02:03:20.740 --> 02:03:21.860]   with maybe one year of training
[02:03:21.860 --> 02:03:23.700]   and then done one year of law school and been done.
[02:03:23.700 --> 02:03:26.460]   Okay, the reality is that this is a giant scam.
[02:03:26.460 --> 02:03:27.980]   And this is again, it's a bipartisan problem,
[02:03:27.980 --> 02:03:29.880]   but it's just a generalized problem.
[02:03:29.880 --> 02:03:32.140]   We have, you wanna talk about things
[02:03:32.140 --> 02:03:33.980]   that hurt the lower classes in the United States,
[02:03:33.980 --> 02:03:37.260]   the bleeding of degrees up is so wild and crazy.
[02:03:37.260 --> 02:03:38.540]   There's so many jobs in the United States
[02:03:38.540 --> 02:03:40.220]   that should not require a college degree
[02:03:40.220 --> 02:03:41.580]   that we now require a college degree to do
[02:03:41.580 --> 02:03:44.060]   because there was this weird idea that came over Americans
[02:03:44.060 --> 02:03:46.420]   where they mistook correlation for causation.
[02:03:46.420 --> 02:03:48.100]   They would say, oh, look, people who go to college
[02:03:48.100 --> 02:03:49.620]   are making more money than people who don't go to college.
[02:03:49.620 --> 02:03:51.540]   Therefore, everyone should go to college.
[02:03:51.540 --> 02:03:54.060]   Well, maybe the reason is because people
[02:03:54.060 --> 02:03:56.100]   who are going to college were better qualified
[02:03:56.100 --> 02:03:58.260]   for particular jobs because on average,
[02:03:58.260 --> 02:03:59.420]   not all the time, but on average,
[02:03:59.420 --> 02:04:00.460]   a lot of those people were smarter
[02:04:00.460 --> 02:04:01.980]   and making more money because of that.
[02:04:01.980 --> 02:04:03.700]   And so all you've done is you've now created
[02:04:03.700 --> 02:04:05.340]   these additional layers of stratification.
[02:04:05.340 --> 02:04:06.980]   So a person who used to be able to get a job
[02:04:06.980 --> 02:04:09.020]   with a college degree now has to have a postdoc degree
[02:04:09.020 --> 02:04:10.220]   in order to go get that degree.
[02:04:10.220 --> 02:04:12.700]   A person who used to be able to just graduate high school,
[02:04:12.700 --> 02:04:14.260]   now it's de facto, you gotta go to JUCO
[02:04:14.260 --> 02:04:15.420]   and then you gotta go to college
[02:04:15.420 --> 02:04:16.780]   or nobody's gonna look at your resume.
[02:04:16.780 --> 02:04:18.540]   It's really, really terrible.
[02:04:18.540 --> 02:04:19.900]   For people who can't afford all of that,
[02:04:19.900 --> 02:04:22.740]   it's led to this massive increase in educational cost
[02:04:22.740 --> 02:04:26.020]   that is inexplicable other than this particular
[02:04:26.020 --> 02:04:26.860]   sort of bleed up and by the way,
[02:04:26.860 --> 02:04:29.060]   federal subsidies for higher education.
[02:04:29.060 --> 02:04:30.660]   Again, one of my problems with federal subsidies
[02:04:30.660 --> 02:04:32.500]   for higher education, I'd love for everyone
[02:04:32.500 --> 02:04:34.860]   to be able to go to college if qualified to do so
[02:04:34.860 --> 02:04:36.060]   and if it is productive.
[02:04:36.060 --> 02:04:37.580]   But one of the things I did when I went to law school
[02:04:37.580 --> 02:04:39.620]   is I took loans because a bank said
[02:04:39.620 --> 02:04:40.900]   I was gonna get my money back
[02:04:40.900 --> 02:04:42.460]   if I got a law degree from Harvard.
[02:04:42.460 --> 02:04:44.220]   But you know when you're not gonna get your money back?
[02:04:44.220 --> 02:04:45.980]   If you're a bank, you're not gonna lend to some dude
[02:04:45.980 --> 02:04:48.060]   who wants to major in art theory
[02:04:48.060 --> 02:04:49.500]   because is that a good bet?
[02:04:49.500 --> 02:04:50.860]   There's no collateral, right?
[02:04:50.860 --> 02:04:52.820]   If I give a loan for a house, I can go repossess the house.
[02:04:52.820 --> 02:04:55.300]   How do I repossess your garbage college degree from UCLA?
[02:04:55.300 --> 02:04:56.260]   There's no way to do that.
[02:04:56.260 --> 02:04:59.780]   So this is a broader conversation
[02:04:59.780 --> 02:05:00.860]   about education in general.
[02:05:00.860 --> 02:05:03.260]   I think the educational system is cruising for a bruising
[02:05:03.260 --> 02:05:04.540]   and I think all that's necessary
[02:05:04.540 --> 02:05:06.740]   for it to completely collapse on the non-STEM side
[02:05:06.740 --> 02:05:07.860]   where you actually learn things
[02:05:07.860 --> 02:05:11.460]   is for people who employ to simply say,
[02:05:11.460 --> 02:05:13.060]   give me your SAT score and I will hire you
[02:05:13.060 --> 02:05:14.860]   for an apprenticeship directly out of high school.
[02:05:14.860 --> 02:05:16.660]   That it would cut out so much of the middleman.
[02:05:16.660 --> 02:05:18.060]   But as far as the general point
[02:05:18.060 --> 02:05:20.580]   that you're making about institutions,
[02:05:20.580 --> 02:05:23.740]   I may disagree on the education and how far it's gone.
[02:05:23.740 --> 02:05:25.340]   In general, I agree with you.
[02:05:25.340 --> 02:05:29.560]   So in general, I agree and I get to use my favorite,
[02:05:29.560 --> 02:05:30.820]   longest word in the English language here.
[02:05:30.820 --> 02:05:32.700]   I would consider myself in many cases
[02:05:32.700 --> 02:05:34.340]   an anti-disestablishmentarianist.
[02:05:34.340 --> 02:05:35.180]   - Nice. - Right?
[02:05:35.180 --> 02:05:36.540]   You see, I like to drop that.
[02:05:36.540 --> 02:05:38.060]   'Cause if you're an establishmentarian,
[02:05:38.060 --> 02:05:38.900]   that means you like-
[02:05:38.900 --> 02:05:40.140]   - Opposition to the- - Disestablishmentarianism.
[02:05:40.140 --> 02:05:41.180]   Right, so I'm an anti, so-
[02:05:41.180 --> 02:05:42.420]   - Can you say that word, Justin?
[02:05:42.420 --> 02:05:43.620]   - That's the one we all learned growing up,
[02:05:43.620 --> 02:05:44.780]   anti-disestablishmentarianism.
[02:05:44.780 --> 02:05:45.620]   - There you go. - Longest word
[02:05:45.620 --> 02:05:47.520]   in the dictionary. - And so he is also.
[02:05:47.520 --> 02:05:48.460]   - But I think- - And then some
[02:05:48.460 --> 02:05:49.280]   candidate group would say,
[02:05:49.280 --> 02:05:50.120]   what about supercalifragilisticexpialidocious?
[02:05:50.120 --> 02:05:50.940]   And then you're- - What about
[02:05:50.940 --> 02:05:51.780]   pneumoultramicroscopic-
[02:05:51.780 --> 02:05:53.500]   - Yeah, or the science terms. - Yeah, exactly.
[02:05:53.500 --> 02:05:55.040]   - Or what about the 7,000 letter thing
[02:05:55.040 --> 02:05:56.680]   that's from part of a biochem?
[02:05:56.680 --> 02:05:58.720]   - I got my education in the Soviet Union,
[02:05:58.720 --> 02:05:59.800]   so we just did math.
[02:05:59.800 --> 02:06:00.920]   (Justin laughs)
[02:06:00.920 --> 02:06:01.960]   - That's why you're a useful person.
[02:06:01.960 --> 02:06:03.500]   - Soviet Union math was that one plus one,
[02:06:03.500 --> 02:06:04.520]   how to make that equal three?
[02:06:04.520 --> 02:06:06.600]   - We know long words, and he streams on the internet.
[02:06:06.600 --> 02:06:08.600]   (Justin laughs)
[02:06:08.600 --> 02:06:09.440]   And I talk for a living.
[02:06:09.440 --> 02:06:13.040]   So anyway, but the point is that I don't disagree
[02:06:13.040 --> 02:06:15.160]   that there is a general populist tendency
[02:06:15.160 --> 02:06:17.480]   on all sides of the aisle to look at the institutions
[02:06:17.480 --> 02:06:18.900]   and then throw them overboard.
[02:06:18.900 --> 02:06:21.080]   I think that some of that is earned
[02:06:21.080 --> 02:06:22.720]   by people who are in positions of power
[02:06:22.720 --> 02:06:25.360]   at institutions who have completely undermined
[02:06:25.360 --> 02:06:27.440]   the faith and credibility of those institutions.
[02:06:27.440 --> 02:06:29.680]   I think you have to examine institution by institutions
[02:06:29.680 --> 02:06:31.320]   which ones are salvageable and which ones are not.
[02:06:31.320 --> 02:06:34.080]   So I'm not a full anti-disestablishmentarianism.
[02:06:34.080 --> 02:06:35.680]   I'd be partially in that camp.
[02:06:35.680 --> 02:06:37.880]   There are certain institutions like higher education
[02:06:37.880 --> 02:06:39.160]   in the liberal arts that I think
[02:06:39.160 --> 02:06:40.320]   we may be better off without.
[02:06:40.320 --> 02:06:41.800]   And then there are certain institutions,
[02:06:41.800 --> 02:06:43.620]   like say participation in American government,
[02:06:43.620 --> 02:06:45.480]   where when people talk about we need a revolution,
[02:06:45.480 --> 02:06:47.160]   like no, we don't, that's not a thing.
[02:06:47.160 --> 02:06:48.800]   We need an evolution, we need change,
[02:06:48.800 --> 02:06:50.360]   we can use the system.
[02:06:50.360 --> 02:06:52.080]   And yeah, but I think you have to establish,
[02:06:52.080 --> 02:06:55.480]   you have to look at it industry by industry,
[02:06:55.480 --> 02:06:57.960]   just institution by institution.
[02:06:57.960 --> 02:06:59.120]   - On that position on institutions,
[02:06:59.120 --> 02:07:01.440]   do you think Biden or Trump would salvage you more?
[02:07:01.440 --> 02:07:02.760]   - As far as the institutions?
[02:07:02.760 --> 02:07:04.200]   I think the institutions in the United States
[02:07:04.200 --> 02:07:05.560]   at the governmental level are robust.
[02:07:05.560 --> 02:07:06.840]   I think the social institutions are fair.
[02:07:06.840 --> 02:07:07.660]   - Yeah, but I'm just curious,
[02:07:07.660 --> 02:07:08.680]   on your general view of institutions,
[02:07:08.680 --> 02:07:10.200]   do you think Biden or Trump would salvage you more
[02:07:10.200 --> 02:07:11.640]   on how you view them?
[02:07:11.640 --> 02:07:13.460]   - I mean, I think that in rhetoric, Biden would.
[02:07:13.460 --> 02:07:15.720]   And then I think that he would tear out the face
[02:07:15.720 --> 02:07:17.360]   of the institution and wear it around
[02:07:17.360 --> 02:07:18.360]   like a masculine cannibal lecher.
[02:07:18.680 --> 02:07:20.400]   - Even though he resisted some people's calls
[02:07:20.400 --> 02:07:22.720]   to like pack the court and?
[02:07:22.720 --> 02:07:25.640]   - Yes, because I think that his use of executive power
[02:07:25.640 --> 02:07:27.280]   was greater than that of Donald Trump.
[02:07:27.280 --> 02:07:28.160]   The power that he had,
[02:07:28.160 --> 02:07:29.960]   he used to greater effect than Donald Trump.
[02:07:29.960 --> 02:07:31.760]   Donald Trump, again, thrashed up against the sides
[02:07:31.760 --> 02:07:33.560]   of the box, but could not get out of it.
[02:07:33.560 --> 02:07:35.400]   - Okay, for just real quick,
[02:07:35.400 --> 02:07:37.480]   'cause that answer went a lot farther
[02:07:37.480 --> 02:07:38.640]   than the initial question.
[02:07:38.640 --> 02:07:39.680]   Yeah, just on the real quick thing,
[02:07:39.680 --> 02:07:41.880]   the reason why I, again, my main problem
[02:07:41.880 --> 02:07:43.120]   that I feel like we have today in society
[02:07:43.120 --> 02:07:44.480]   is people are getting into their own bubbles.
[02:07:44.480 --> 02:07:46.380]   The idea of having like conservative schools
[02:07:46.380 --> 02:07:48.000]   and liberal schools seems like the saddest thing
[02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:49.080]   in the world to me.
[02:07:49.080 --> 02:07:51.060]   Like I would want conservatives and liberals
[02:07:51.060 --> 02:07:51.900]   going to school together
[02:07:51.900 --> 02:07:53.480]   because I think these people need to interact
[02:07:53.480 --> 02:07:54.820]   with each other more, if for no other reason,
[02:07:54.820 --> 02:07:56.360]   than to say that the other person is not
[02:07:56.360 --> 02:07:58.520]   like an actual monstrous, horrible entity
[02:07:58.520 --> 02:07:59.960]   that wants to destroy the country.
[02:07:59.960 --> 02:08:02.000]   - I think a classically liberal idea for many schools
[02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:02.840]   would not be a bad thing.
[02:08:02.840 --> 02:08:03.680]   I think it would be a good thing.
[02:08:03.680 --> 02:08:04.920]   You just wonder if that's salvageable.
[02:08:04.920 --> 02:08:07.000]   And if it's not salvageable, then the answer to that
[02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:08.760]   is to actually create alternative institutions.
[02:08:08.760 --> 02:08:10.560]   - I feel like the biggest issue that we have
[02:08:10.560 --> 02:08:12.840]   is people are, they sort into these different
[02:08:12.840 --> 02:08:14.280]   like phantom worlds to where,
[02:08:14.280 --> 02:08:15.720]   even if you live in the same city,
[02:08:15.720 --> 02:08:17.000]   there are totally different worlds that exist
[02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:18.000]   between liberals and conservatives.
[02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:19.160]   And I feel like one of the big barriers
[02:08:19.160 --> 02:08:20.600]   to people understanding the other side,
[02:08:20.600 --> 02:08:22.660]   sometimes it's just a little bit of information
[02:08:22.660 --> 02:08:25.400]   or a little bit of like firsthand experience.
[02:08:25.400 --> 02:08:27.000]   When I, so in terms of information,
[02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:30.040]   I'm sure you saw, I don't know if this is a full on study,
[02:08:30.040 --> 02:08:32.560]   but they were talking about how some huge percentage
[02:08:32.560 --> 02:08:34.000]   of students would change their mind on
[02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:35.420]   from the river to the sea when you told them
[02:08:35.420 --> 02:08:36.260]   what from the river to the sea actually meant.
[02:08:36.260 --> 02:08:37.800]   - What the river was and what the sea was, yeah.
[02:08:37.800 --> 02:08:39.460]   - Yeah, or when you said like, yeah,
[02:08:39.460 --> 02:08:40.600]   what does a one state solution mean?
[02:08:40.600 --> 02:08:42.120]   A lot of them like, such that the numbers went
[02:08:42.120 --> 02:08:45.000]   from like 70% to like 30% in terms of like support
[02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:46.360]   would fall, and it wasn't because you were doing
[02:08:46.360 --> 02:08:48.040]   a radical redefining of their whole ideology,
[02:08:48.040 --> 02:08:49.640]   you were just giving them a little bit more information.
[02:08:49.640 --> 02:08:51.400]   And then something that I've seen on a firsthand level
[02:08:51.400 --> 02:08:53.520]   is when I go and speak or do debates at university,
[02:08:53.520 --> 02:08:55.460]   sometimes I'm in very, very, very conservative areas.
[02:08:55.460 --> 02:08:56.960]   Some of my fans are trans.
[02:08:56.960 --> 02:08:58.200]   Having like a trans person show up
[02:08:58.200 --> 02:08:59.840]   and talk to conservatives for a little bit,
[02:08:59.840 --> 02:09:01.720]   not like in a speech, but just like in like a bar
[02:09:01.720 --> 02:09:03.240]   or a setting, like a lot of them walk away,
[02:09:03.240 --> 02:09:04.480]   they're like, oh, not every trans person
[02:09:04.480 --> 02:09:06.100]   is like this insane lunatic from Twitter
[02:09:06.100 --> 02:09:08.400]   that is fucking an actual crazy person.
[02:09:08.400 --> 02:09:09.520]   And then for some of my fans,
[02:09:09.520 --> 02:09:10.440]   when they hang out with conservatives,
[02:09:10.440 --> 02:09:11.860]   they're like, oh, these guys are actually pretty friendly.
[02:09:11.860 --> 02:09:13.360]   I thought they would have all been homophobic, racist,
[02:09:13.360 --> 02:09:14.200]   transphobic and evil, but they're not.
[02:09:14.200 --> 02:09:15.520]   They're just like normal people.
[02:09:15.520 --> 02:09:16.720]   I feel like we need more of that mixing.
[02:09:16.720 --> 02:09:17.760]   - I totally agree with that, certainly.
[02:09:17.760 --> 02:09:19.480]   - Yeah, and I feel like on our social media platforms,
[02:09:19.480 --> 02:09:20.800]   on our algorithms, in our schools,
[02:09:20.800 --> 02:09:22.760]   I feel like we're sorting harder and harder and harder.
[02:09:22.760 --> 02:09:25.480]   And any type of rhetoric that encourages the sorting
[02:09:25.480 --> 02:09:27.080]   is really bad and damaging.
[02:09:27.080 --> 02:09:28.720]   We need to like continue to mix up.
[02:09:28.720 --> 02:09:29.920]   And there's other things I wanted to talk about,
[02:09:29.920 --> 02:09:31.160]   but Lex is opening his mouth.
[02:09:31.160 --> 02:09:33.560]   - Destiny the uniter, wow.
[02:09:33.560 --> 02:09:36.600]   - Like Biden, not like Trump.
[02:09:36.600 --> 02:09:37.680]   - As we approach the end,
[02:09:37.680 --> 02:09:41.080]   let us descend into the meme further and further.
[02:09:41.080 --> 02:09:43.760]   Ben, you're in a monogamous marriage.
[02:09:43.760 --> 02:09:45.160]   And Destiny, you've been mostly
[02:09:45.160 --> 02:09:47.520]   in an open marriage until recently.
[02:09:47.520 --> 02:09:50.640]   How foundational is marriage, monogamous marriage,
[02:09:50.640 --> 02:09:53.080]   to the United States of America?
[02:09:53.080 --> 02:09:54.560]   Can open marriages work?
[02:09:54.560 --> 02:09:58.120]   Are they harmful to society, Ben?
[02:09:58.120 --> 02:09:59.880]   - Marriages are the single most important thing
[02:09:59.880 --> 02:10:01.320]   that people can do in the United States
[02:10:01.320 --> 02:10:03.080]   because the things within your control
[02:10:03.080 --> 02:10:05.020]   are easier to control than the things outside your control.
[02:10:05.020 --> 02:10:07.480]   People tend to think about big political change,
[02:10:07.480 --> 02:10:08.700]   obviously, about things they can do
[02:10:08.700 --> 02:10:10.080]   to change the entire system.
[02:10:10.080 --> 02:10:11.920]   But the reality is the thing that you can do
[02:10:11.920 --> 02:10:13.920]   that best changes society is to get married
[02:10:13.920 --> 02:10:15.760]   and have kids and raise your kids responsibly.
[02:10:15.760 --> 02:10:17.480]   That is the single best thing that you can do.
[02:10:17.480 --> 02:10:18.840]   Can an open marriage work?
[02:10:18.840 --> 02:10:20.840]   I mean, I think that it depends on your definition of work.
[02:10:20.840 --> 02:10:23.320]   So in my version of work, the answer is no,
[02:10:23.320 --> 02:10:26.120]   because what you actually need in order to facilitate
[02:10:26.120 --> 02:10:28.400]   the healthy growing of a child
[02:10:28.400 --> 02:10:30.560]   is a father and mother who are committed to each other.
[02:10:30.560 --> 02:10:34.040]   All ideas about there being no emotional component
[02:10:34.040 --> 02:10:38.560]   to sexual activity are completely specious.
[02:10:38.560 --> 02:10:40.080]   That it is truer for men than it is for women,
[02:10:40.080 --> 02:10:41.520]   but it's not true for either.
[02:10:41.520 --> 02:10:46.520]   The idea of a full commitment to a human being
[02:10:46.520 --> 02:10:48.680]   with whom you genetically create children,
[02:10:48.680 --> 02:10:50.760]   which is typically how we've done it
[02:10:50.760 --> 02:10:52.360]   throughout human existence,
[02:10:52.360 --> 02:10:54.740]   is in fact the fundamental basis
[02:10:54.740 --> 02:10:56.160]   for any functional civilization.
[02:10:56.160 --> 02:10:58.040]   It allows for the transmission of culture and values.
[02:10:58.040 --> 02:10:59.200]   It allows for the transmission
[02:10:59.200 --> 02:11:01.000]   of beliefs and responsibility.
[02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:05.000]   And it gives the great lie to both the communitarian lie
[02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:07.440]   and the atomistic individualist lie.
[02:11:07.440 --> 02:11:09.560]   The communitarian lie is that you belong
[02:11:09.560 --> 02:11:11.760]   to the giant community of man,
[02:11:11.760 --> 02:11:14.240]   which is not true because you have a family
[02:11:14.240 --> 02:11:16.840]   and your allegiance should be and is naturally
[02:11:16.840 --> 02:11:18.160]   to the members of your family first.
[02:11:18.160 --> 02:11:19.280]   That's how we learn.
[02:11:19.280 --> 02:11:21.640]   And then we expound that out.
[02:11:21.640 --> 02:11:23.320]   And it also is a lie to the notion
[02:11:23.320 --> 02:11:24.740]   that we are all atomistic individuals
[02:11:24.740 --> 02:11:25.840]   with no responsibilities.
[02:11:25.840 --> 02:11:28.200]   We are born into a world of responsibilities.
[02:11:28.200 --> 02:11:30.440]   Everyone is born into a world of responsibilities
[02:11:30.440 --> 02:11:32.880]   and rules and roles, and those are good.
[02:11:32.880 --> 02:11:35.900]   And if we do not actually socialize our children that way,
[02:11:35.900 --> 02:11:37.480]   there will be, number one, no children.
[02:11:37.480 --> 02:11:39.040]   Number one, there will be no healthy children.
[02:11:39.040 --> 02:11:40.120]   Number two, there will be no healthy children.
[02:11:40.120 --> 02:11:42.000]   Number three, there will be not the foundation
[02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:45.440]   for either social fabric, which is the real glue
[02:11:45.440 --> 02:11:48.440]   that holds together society, or for a functional government.
[02:11:48.440 --> 02:11:51.760]   So yes, yes, monogamous marriage.
[02:11:51.760 --> 02:11:52.600]   I'm a fan.
[02:11:52.600 --> 02:11:55.280]   15 years married, four kids, yes.
[02:11:55.280 --> 02:11:56.920]   - Destiny, what do you think?
[02:11:56.920 --> 02:11:57.760]   - I think that when we talk about
[02:11:57.760 --> 02:11:58.720]   like relationships or marriage,
[02:11:58.720 --> 02:11:59.920]   I think something that's really important
[02:11:59.920 --> 02:12:01.240]   is we have to talk about whether or not
[02:12:01.240 --> 02:12:03.060]   children are being discussed or not.
[02:12:03.060 --> 02:12:05.600]   Because I think once you introduce the child aspect,
[02:12:05.600 --> 02:12:07.660]   I think the style or the type of relationship that you do
[02:12:07.660 --> 02:12:09.200]   is gonna become way more important
[02:12:09.200 --> 02:12:11.560]   than whatever exists prior to that.
[02:12:11.560 --> 02:12:12.840]   Like I would agree, for instance,
[02:12:12.840 --> 02:12:13.800]   in terms of what Ben is saying,
[02:12:13.800 --> 02:12:16.480]   that there's probably going to be some structure
[02:12:16.480 --> 02:12:19.960]   that is ideal for the care and the raising of a child.
[02:12:19.960 --> 02:12:21.120]   I think that having a child
[02:12:21.120 --> 02:12:23.360]   gives you a much bigger buy-in to society,
[02:12:23.360 --> 02:12:25.080]   because now all of a sudden you care about a lot of things
[02:12:25.080 --> 02:12:26.240]   that you might not have before,
[02:12:26.240 --> 02:12:27.760]   because not only do you exist in society,
[02:12:27.760 --> 02:12:28.960]   you can't just run.
[02:12:28.960 --> 02:12:30.160]   Now you've got a child that exists there,
[02:12:30.160 --> 02:12:32.160]   and you've got to ensure that everything functions smoothly,
[02:12:32.160 --> 02:12:34.840]   not just for you, but for that child as well.
[02:12:34.840 --> 02:12:37.600]   And arguably, although we're getting into weird places,
[02:12:37.600 --> 02:12:38.880]   I guess, in the world now,
[02:12:38.880 --> 02:12:41.520]   like children are the primary conduit
[02:12:41.520 --> 02:12:44.520]   for where you transmit cultural values and everything.
[02:12:44.520 --> 02:12:47.200]   The one kind of weird thing that we're coming up against,
[02:12:47.200 --> 02:12:49.480]   that we have been coming up against
[02:12:49.480 --> 02:12:51.640]   now for some number of decades and will continue to,
[02:12:51.640 --> 02:12:54.240]   is as societies progress,
[02:12:54.240 --> 02:12:56.720]   seems like people are having less children.
[02:12:56.720 --> 02:12:58.440]   And I actually don't know 100%
[02:12:58.440 --> 02:13:00.400]   what the answer is to that question.
[02:13:00.400 --> 02:13:01.240]   - I do.
[02:13:01.240 --> 02:13:02.440]   - Yeah, I'm sure you do, yeah.
[02:13:02.440 --> 02:13:04.520]   I mean, an implementable answer that works,
[02:13:04.520 --> 02:13:06.400]   that we know we can get everybody on board with.
[02:13:06.400 --> 02:13:09.580]   It seems like, for a large part of human history,
[02:13:09.580 --> 02:13:11.240]   having children, and it still is,
[02:13:11.240 --> 02:13:13.360]   having children is awesome, and children are cool,
[02:13:13.360 --> 02:13:15.880]   and children are magical and miraculous and all of this,
[02:13:15.880 --> 02:13:17.480]   but you didn't really have much competing
[02:13:17.480 --> 02:13:20.120]   for your attention to have a child, right?
[02:13:20.120 --> 02:13:22.160]   When you hit a certain age and you started working,
[02:13:22.160 --> 02:13:23.240]   especially if you're a woman,
[02:13:23.240 --> 02:13:25.400]   I mean, childbirth is kind of the next step,
[02:13:25.400 --> 02:13:27.000]   and then having a family, raising your children,
[02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:28.420]   and then doing that is kind of the next step.
[02:13:28.420 --> 02:13:30.440]   Nowadays, especially with women being able to work,
[02:13:30.440 --> 02:13:32.080]   especially women having access to birth control,
[02:13:32.080 --> 02:13:33.440]   there's a lot available in the world
[02:13:33.440 --> 02:13:34.960]   that's competing for the interest of people
[02:13:34.960 --> 02:13:36.800]   that could otherwise be having children,
[02:13:36.800 --> 02:13:38.180]   such that we've almost flipped it,
[02:13:38.180 --> 02:13:39.960]   such that, as Ben brought up earlier,
[02:13:39.960 --> 02:13:41.300]   wealthy people tend to have less children
[02:13:41.300 --> 02:13:43.000]   than not wealthy people,
[02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:45.000]   or unless you're part of particular religious communities
[02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:46.840]   that push childbirth a lot.
[02:13:46.840 --> 02:13:48.640]   I don't know if I would say there exists
[02:13:48.640 --> 02:13:52.960]   a moral imperative on an individual to have children.
[02:13:52.960 --> 02:13:54.480]   I think that there's a lot of interesting arguments
[02:13:54.480 --> 02:13:55.320]   down that path.
[02:13:55.320 --> 02:13:57.080]   I don't know if we're quite at the point yet
[02:13:57.080 --> 02:13:59.280]   where we need to say, oh my God, we're running out of people,
[02:13:59.280 --> 02:14:00.640]   we need to have more kids.
[02:14:00.640 --> 02:14:02.080]   I don't think we're quite there yet,
[02:14:02.080 --> 02:14:05.040]   but we are seeing weird demographic trends
[02:14:05.040 --> 02:14:06.040]   that are having big impacts
[02:14:06.040 --> 02:14:07.240]   on how countries are playing out.
[02:14:07.240 --> 02:14:08.360]   For instance, the fact that we have
[02:14:08.360 --> 02:14:10.360]   a disproportionately huge aging population
[02:14:10.360 --> 02:14:11.240]   that needs to be taken care of
[02:14:11.240 --> 02:14:12.520]   with medical expenses and everything,
[02:14:12.520 --> 02:14:14.360]   that vote in different ways than our younger population,
[02:14:14.360 --> 02:14:15.400]   and that when they die off,
[02:14:15.400 --> 02:14:17.160]   the way that society is gonna look
[02:14:17.160 --> 02:14:18.880]   is gonna be a lot different.
[02:14:18.880 --> 02:14:20.440]   Yeah, I don't actually have a,
[02:14:20.440 --> 02:14:22.240]   I'm not entirely sure what the future's gonna look like
[02:14:22.240 --> 02:14:24.560]   in terms of pushing people to have kids
[02:14:24.560 --> 02:14:26.240]   when every single industrialized country,
[02:14:26.240 --> 02:14:27.600]   as they become more industrialized,
[02:14:27.600 --> 02:14:29.240]   have fewer and fewer and fewer children.
[02:14:29.240 --> 02:14:31.200]   - Rapid-fire questions.
[02:14:31.200 --> 02:14:33.440]   - And the answer, my answer was go to church.
[02:14:33.440 --> 02:14:35.120]   - Religion, yeah, I figured.
[02:14:35.120 --> 02:14:36.280]   - Well, we could talk about religion,
[02:14:36.280 --> 02:14:38.520]   but that's not rapid-fire at all.
[02:14:38.520 --> 02:14:41.160]   Let me ask, this is from the internet.
[02:14:41.160 --> 02:14:42.800]   Does body count matter?
[02:14:42.800 --> 02:14:44.120]   - Jesus Christ.
[02:14:44.120 --> 02:14:47.240]   You're really bringing up the red pill stuff.
[02:14:47.240 --> 02:14:48.640]   - Are you avoiding answering?
[02:14:48.640 --> 02:14:50.640]   - I mean, it's totally, it depends on who you are.
[02:14:50.640 --> 02:14:52.120]   If you're somebody that doesn't care about it, it doesn't.
[02:14:52.120 --> 02:14:53.040]   If you're somebody that does care about it,
[02:14:53.040 --> 02:14:53.880]   yeah, it does, of course.
[02:14:53.880 --> 02:14:55.720]   Depends on the, the answer is yes.
[02:14:55.720 --> 02:14:56.720]   - Okay.
[02:14:56.720 --> 02:14:58.520]   Should porn be banned?
[02:14:58.520 --> 02:14:59.360]   - No.
[02:15:00.360 --> 02:15:04.840]   If you could do it, yes.
[02:15:04.840 --> 02:15:08.320]   There is no, there is no benefit to pornography.
[02:15:08.320 --> 02:15:10.240]   It's a waste of time and destructive to the human soul.
[02:15:10.240 --> 02:15:12.200]   - I can't believe I'm asking this question.
[02:15:12.200 --> 02:15:14.800]   Is OnlyFans empowering or destructive for women?
[02:15:14.800 --> 02:15:19.280]   - I, Jesus, these are rapid-fire?
[02:15:19.280 --> 02:15:20.480]   - Yeah, just, you can't, wow.
[02:15:20.480 --> 02:15:21.400]   - I mean, it's probably empowering
[02:15:21.400 --> 02:15:22.720]   for the ones that are making a lot of money off it.
[02:15:22.720 --> 02:15:24.120]   It probably feels disempowering for others
[02:15:24.120 --> 02:15:25.480]   that feel affected by the cultural norms
[02:15:25.480 --> 02:15:26.640]   set by women that do OnlyFans.
[02:15:26.640 --> 02:15:28.160]   There's my rapid-fire answer.
[02:15:28.160 --> 02:15:29.960]   It's destructive to even the ones
[02:15:29.960 --> 02:15:30.800]   who are making a lot of money
[02:15:30.800 --> 02:15:31.960]   because when you degrade yourself
[02:15:31.960 --> 02:15:35.240]   to being just a set of human body characteristics
[02:15:35.240 --> 02:15:36.420]   that other people jack off to,
[02:15:36.420 --> 02:15:38.560]   it's bad for you and it's bad for them.
[02:15:38.560 --> 02:15:40.640]   - Is rap music?
[02:15:40.640 --> 02:15:41.480]   - Absolutely.
[02:15:41.480 --> 02:15:43.120]   - Have you evolved on this or?
[02:15:43.120 --> 02:15:44.680]   - Have I evolved on this?
[02:15:44.680 --> 02:15:48.040]   So, again, I'm gonna go to what's the definition of music?
[02:15:48.040 --> 02:15:49.240]   My original argument about rap
[02:15:49.240 --> 02:15:52.040]   was that music involves the following three elements,
[02:15:52.040 --> 02:15:53.960]   rhythm, melody, harmony.
[02:15:53.960 --> 02:15:58.040]   Rap typically involves maybe one of those.
[02:15:58.040 --> 02:16:02.120]   There may be a melody, maybe, sometimes.
[02:16:02.120 --> 02:16:04.480]   So it depends on the kind of rap.
[02:16:04.480 --> 02:16:06.800]   With that said, I could be convinced on this issue,
[02:16:06.800 --> 02:16:10.320]   but listen, I'm a classical violinist.
[02:16:10.320 --> 02:16:12.200]   I mean, that's how I was raised.
[02:16:12.200 --> 02:16:14.200]   I listened to Beethoven and Brahms and Mozart
[02:16:14.200 --> 02:16:15.480]   like in the car with my kids.
[02:16:15.480 --> 02:16:18.440]   So is it comparable, is it in the same category
[02:16:18.440 --> 02:16:19.600]   as Beethoven, Brahms, and Mozart?
[02:16:19.600 --> 02:16:21.320]   I have a very hard time sticking it
[02:16:21.320 --> 02:16:23.520]   in the same category as that.
[02:16:23.520 --> 02:16:26.700]   - All right, you're both world-class debaters.
[02:16:27.540 --> 02:16:31.100]   Even public intellectuals, if I can say that.
[02:16:31.100 --> 02:16:31.940]   - Jesus.
[02:16:31.940 --> 02:16:32.780]   - Yeah, I know.
[02:16:32.780 --> 02:16:33.600]   - I'm going real hard here.
[02:16:33.600 --> 02:16:34.440]   - I know.
[02:16:34.440 --> 02:16:35.500]   You both care about the truth.
[02:16:35.500 --> 02:16:39.360]   What is your process of arriving at the truth?
[02:16:39.360 --> 02:16:43.220]   - I think it's really important to,
[02:16:43.220 --> 02:16:45.660]   everybody will say that they're objective
[02:16:45.660 --> 02:16:46.980]   and that they are nonpartisan.
[02:16:46.980 --> 02:16:49.740]   I think it's really important to have mental safeguards
[02:16:49.740 --> 02:16:51.820]   for bad opinions.
[02:16:51.820 --> 02:16:55.700]   So, for instance, a couple things that I'll ask myself is
[02:16:55.700 --> 02:16:57.500]   for a particular debate that I'm having,
[02:16:57.500 --> 02:16:59.540]   can I argue convincingly both sides of the debate?
[02:16:59.540 --> 02:17:00.860]   If I can't, I won't bother having the debate
[02:17:00.860 --> 02:17:03.220]   'cause I realize that I'm probably too partisanly dug in
[02:17:03.220 --> 02:17:06.700]   if I can't even represent an opposite argument here.
[02:17:06.700 --> 02:17:08.260]   Another question that you might ask yourself is like,
[02:17:08.260 --> 02:17:09.540]   well, what would it take to convince you
[02:17:09.540 --> 02:17:11.060]   out of a certain position?
[02:17:11.060 --> 02:17:14.860]   If you feel very strongly that Medicare for all
[02:17:14.860 --> 02:17:16.880]   is a good system by which to run
[02:17:16.880 --> 02:17:17.860]   the United States healthcare,
[02:17:17.860 --> 02:17:18.980]   and somebody says, well, what would it take you
[02:17:18.980 --> 02:17:20.700]   to convince you otherwise, if you can't even fathom,
[02:17:20.700 --> 02:17:21.920]   like, well, what would it take to convince me otherwise,
[02:17:21.920 --> 02:17:23.360]   you're probably too dug into a position.
[02:17:23.360 --> 02:17:26.180]   So, I think if you go through life saying like,
[02:17:26.180 --> 02:17:28.480]   well, I try my best to be unbiased,
[02:17:28.480 --> 02:17:32.300]   rather than saying, I try my best to be aware of my biases,
[02:17:32.300 --> 02:17:33.580]   because the latter is more realistic
[02:17:33.580 --> 02:17:34.900]   and the former is literally impossible,
[02:17:34.900 --> 02:17:36.620]   unless you're a computer, yeah.
[02:17:36.620 --> 02:17:39.380]   So, I think having like actual mental practices
[02:17:39.380 --> 02:17:42.400]   that you engage in to try to counter some of the biases
[02:17:42.400 --> 02:17:44.220]   that you have is more important than trying to pretend
[02:17:44.220 --> 02:17:45.700]   that you're free of all biases,
[02:17:45.700 --> 02:17:47.660]   and then consuming all your media from one source, yeah.
[02:17:47.660 --> 02:17:48.500]   - Ben?
[02:17:48.500 --> 02:17:50.480]   - So, I mean, I agree with a lot of that.
[02:17:50.480 --> 02:17:52.680]   I think that the easiest practical guide
[02:17:52.680 --> 02:17:54.020]   is read a bunch of different things
[02:17:54.020 --> 02:17:55.140]   from a bunch of different sources,
[02:17:55.140 --> 02:17:58.260]   and where they cross is probably the set of facts,
[02:17:58.260 --> 02:18:00.540]   and then everything else is extrapolated opinion
[02:18:00.540 --> 02:18:02.180]   from different premises.
[02:18:02.180 --> 02:18:03.860]   That's sort of the short story.
[02:18:03.860 --> 02:18:06.560]   So, read the New York Times and Breitbart,
[02:18:06.560 --> 02:18:07.580]   and they're gonna disagree on a lot,
[02:18:07.580 --> 02:18:09.020]   but if the core of the story--
[02:18:09.020 --> 02:18:10.060]   - And the Daily Wire.
[02:18:10.060 --> 02:18:11.140]   - Certainly read the Daily Wire.
[02:18:11.140 --> 02:18:12.300]   If you read the Daily Wire,
[02:18:12.300 --> 02:18:14.020]   and you read the Washington Post,
[02:18:14.020 --> 02:18:17.740]   and there's a nexus of the same thing,
[02:18:17.740 --> 02:18:19.420]   then you can pretty well guarantee
[02:18:19.420 --> 02:18:22.500]   that at least if we're all blind men feeling the elephant,
[02:18:22.500 --> 02:18:24.260]   at least if we're all feeling the trunk,
[02:18:24.260 --> 02:18:25.380]   we know that there's a trunk there, right?
[02:18:25.380 --> 02:18:26.820]   You may not know what the elephant is.
[02:18:26.820 --> 02:18:30.260]   - And if you're feeling frisky, then watch Destiny as well.
[02:18:30.260 --> 02:18:35.680]   You've talked about having a conversation debating Ben
[02:18:35.680 --> 02:18:37.080]   for a long time.
[02:18:37.080 --> 02:18:40.580]   What is your favorite thing about Ben Shapiro?
[02:18:40.580 --> 02:18:43.100]   - My favorite thing about Ben Shapiro is,
[02:18:43.100 --> 02:18:44.500]   at least when we're in election season,
[02:18:44.500 --> 02:18:45.760]   he's very critical of his own party.
[02:18:45.760 --> 02:18:46.600]   I appreciate that.
[02:18:46.600 --> 02:18:48.540]   (laughing)
[02:18:48.540 --> 02:18:50.700]   That doesn't, I feel like Ben generally tries
[02:18:50.700 --> 02:18:53.060]   to adhere more to the fact-based arguments
[02:18:53.060 --> 02:18:54.780]   than other conservatives that I listen to,
[02:18:54.780 --> 02:18:55.780]   which is something that I appreciate
[02:18:55.780 --> 02:18:58.980]   'cause it's more fun to fight on the factual grounds
[02:18:58.980 --> 02:19:00.620]   of discussing things like foreign policy or whatever,
[02:19:00.620 --> 02:19:02.540]   rather than people that only inhabit
[02:19:02.540 --> 02:19:04.300]   the idealistic or philosophical grounds
[02:19:04.300 --> 02:19:06.060]   because they don't wanna learn about any of the facts,
[02:19:06.060 --> 02:19:07.900]   so I appreciate that.
[02:19:07.900 --> 02:19:09.580]   - Ben, you've gotten a chance to talk to Destiny.
[02:19:09.580 --> 02:19:11.220]   Now, what do you like about the guy?
[02:19:11.220 --> 02:19:12.740]   - A lot of the same sorts of things,
[02:19:12.740 --> 02:19:15.460]   but it's really fun to see how you do your process.
[02:19:15.460 --> 02:19:16.300]   That is a cool thing.
[02:19:16.300 --> 02:19:18.020]   That is a cool thing, and it's a gift to the audience
[02:19:18.020 --> 02:19:20.140]   because, honestly, doing what we do,
[02:19:20.140 --> 02:19:22.060]   so much of what we do is sitting and reading
[02:19:22.060 --> 02:19:24.080]   and being behind closed doors and educating yourself
[02:19:24.080 --> 02:19:25.140]   and talking with people,
[02:19:25.140 --> 02:19:26.300]   but getting to watch you do it in real time
[02:19:26.300 --> 02:19:28.460]   is a really cool window into how people think
[02:19:28.460 --> 02:19:30.520]   and how people learn, so that's a really neat thing.
[02:19:30.520 --> 02:19:32.660]   - Well, gentlemen, this was incredible.
[02:19:32.660 --> 02:19:33.540]   It's an honor.
[02:19:33.540 --> 02:19:34.580]   Thank you for doing this today.
[02:19:34.580 --> 02:19:35.420]   - Hey, thanks a lot.
[02:19:35.420 --> 02:19:36.720]   - Thanks for having me.
[02:19:36.720 --> 02:19:38.140]   - Thanks for listening to this debate
[02:19:38.140 --> 02:19:40.220]   between Ben Shapiro and Destiny.

[02:19:47.900 --> 02:19:51.640]   The basis of a democratic state is liberty.
[02:19:51.640 --> 02:19:55.540]   Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
