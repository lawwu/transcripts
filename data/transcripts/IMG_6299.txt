[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.640]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.400]   Today I want to tell you about the worst international trip that I myself have ever taken, which
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.200]   just so happens to have been my honeymoon, which just so happens to have been to the
[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.600]   nation of Haiti.
[00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.740]   And I want to draw from this trip for you some important lessons related to societies
[00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.580]   in general, economics broadly, and personal finance.
[00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:58.820]   Haiti has been in the news over the last, well, really months, but it really came to
[00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:04.680]   a boiling point over this past weekend as the nation's capital and indeed the country
[00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.200]   broadly has been wracked by violence, extreme violence for months now.
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.480]   And it has boiled over to the point where over the weekend, the United States of America
[00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.960]   performed an emergency airlift to withdraw all non-essential personnel from the US embassy.
[00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.040]   The European Union has withdrawn all of its diplomats.
[00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.180]   And it's so bad that the leader of the country can't even get back into his own country
[00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.760]   because of the violence that ultimately shut down the airport.
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:37.920]   Now all of this is ineffably sad, but none of this is surprising.
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.960]   My first experience with Haiti came on my honeymoon.
[00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.800]   Now before you think I'm the worst president in the world, remember that other great people
[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.560]   have also taken their wives to Haiti for honeymoon.
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.440]   After all, former President Bill Clinton took Hillary Clinton to Haiti on their honeymoon.
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.400]   But my story is not quite so interesting as that.
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.920]   When my wife and I were newly married, I was looking around trying to figure out where
[00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.080]   would be an interesting place to go for a honeymoon.
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.480]   And I was able to get a great deal on an all-inclusive resort in the Dominican Republic, which is,
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:11.200]   of course, part of the island of Hispaniola.
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.960]   And there are two nations that share that island.
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.280]   You have the Dominican Republic and also the nation of Haiti.
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.300]   And since my wife and I both enjoy Spanish and French, I thought it would be a fun travel
[00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.720]   experience for us to spend a week in the Dominican Republic and then to go to Haiti.
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.000]   So we flew into the DR, and then after a week at an all-inclusive resort, we got on a bus
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.360]   and went from Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, to Port-au-Prince, Haiti.
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.920]   And on that bus ride, I began to understand that perhaps I had gotten myself in a little
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:42.920]   bit over my head.
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.240]   I didn't do a lot of research on Haiti.
[00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.000]   I just knew that, "Hey, it's a French-speaking place."
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.320]   I knew it was fairly poor at the time.
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.000]   I wasn't too worried about violence.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.320]   I've traveled in a lot of difficult places, and I thought, "It'll be fine.
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.740]   We'll figure it out."
[00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:01.680]   But on the bus itself, I wound up meeting some people on the bus who were quite concerned
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.240]   about the decision that I had made.
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:08.560]   And in fact, there was one lady who was on the bus who had a private driver who was meeting
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.960]   her, and she insisted that her private driver would be the one to drive us from the bus
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.360]   station to our hotel.
[00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.320]   So we went to – I think it was called the Caribe Hotel in downtown Port-au-Prince for
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.640]   our first night.
[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:22.640]   Remarkable experience.
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.880]   We were there a year after the big earthquake, and actually I wound up meeting Anderson Cooper,
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:36.440]   the CNN host, who was in Haiti for basically a review of the earthquake, what was happening
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.040]   to Haiti a year or so after the earthquake.
[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.200]   And we started in Port-au-Prince, and then from Port-au-Prince, we took a bus across
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.760]   the mountains to a city called Jacmel.
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.480]   I wanted to visit the Bassin Bleu there in Jacmel, so we took a little minibus across
[00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:52.880]   the mountains.
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:59.060]   And that was where everything started to go awry because we did not have an enjoyable
[00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:00.680]   travel experience.
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:07.880]   And in fact, after getting to Jacmel and spending two days in Jacmel, I experienced the desire
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:13.000]   – and in fact, I actually chose to do something I had never done before and have not done
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.680]   since, which was just to leave somewhere as quickly as possible.
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.520]   When we were in Jacmel, our experience was so bad that my wife and I took the first bus
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:27.120]   back to Port-au-Prince that we could get, and we went directly to the airport.
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.240]   And I was determined to buy the first flight out that I could get.
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.680]   Unfortunately, when we got to the airport, all of the international flights had gone
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.200]   for the day.
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.700]   And so instead of taking a flight out of the country, I wound up taking an early morning
[00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:48.120]   flight the next day and flying to Cape Haitian, where we spent one more day visiting something
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:53.320]   called the Palace of Saint-Suzy and the Citadel, which is truly remarkable, an amazing place
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.320]   to visit.
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:58.560]   We really enjoyed our time in Cape Haitian and then later wound up taking the bus early
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.180]   back to the Dominican Republic.
[00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.360]   But why was Haiti so bad?
[00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:10.860]   Well, I'll tell you, quite simply, I felt like every single person with whom I interacted
[00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:18.020]   in our trip in Haiti was out to cheat me in some way, shape or form.
[00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:24.180]   I'm not an inexperienced traveler, but I found it quite challenging to hang on to my money,
[00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:30.660]   to hang on to my luggage, when every single person at every single level of society, including
[00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:35.700]   all of the people who are serving tourists in the tourist industry, is trying to cheat
[00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.340]   me out of my money.
[00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:44.140]   And I reflected quite a lot, I spoke to a lot of Haitians trying to understand why that
[00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:45.140]   might be.
[00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:46.460]   I developed a theory.
[00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:51.560]   This is purely my theory, my experience from spending what wound up being three or four
[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.440]   days in Haiti.
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:58.540]   But my theory as to why my experience in Haiti was so unpleasant is this.
[00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:03.580]   Haitians refuse to cooperate with one another in any meaningful way.
[00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:10.980]   The experience that I had being in Haiti was that every single Haitian is out to fight
[00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:16.140]   against every other single Haitian on a daily basis.
[00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:17.860]   I don't know why that is.
[00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:22.260]   My opinion or my theory is that it has something to do with the history of Haiti.
[00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:29.100]   One thing that's very important to understand about the Haitian nation and culture is that
[00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:37.260]   Haitians are extremely proud of their heritage as being the only successful black slave revolt
[00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:38.900]   in world history.
[00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:43.100]   So as many black Africans were enslaved all around the world, in Haiti, the slaves were
[00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:49.580]   able to rise up and defeat their masters in battle and create the only independent formerly
[00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.740]   slave nation, which is the nation of Haiti.
[00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:56.160]   But as I reflected on it and thought about my own experience there, I thought this must
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:02.140]   explain at least some of the horrifically unfriendly culture.
[00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:05.420]   Haitians argue with one another constantly.
[00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:10.900]   It seems like they don't ever want to take the lower place, the place of a servant.
[00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:18.260]   Now I believe that the basic foundation of a functional society is the willingness that
[00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:23.180]   neighbors, friends, co-workers, that we all have to serve one another.
[00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:25.500]   I take that primarily from Christian theology.
[00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:29.260]   Jesus taught that the greatest among you must be the servant of all.
[00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:34.300]   And I see that throughout society, especially in a free capitalist society, the man who
[00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:40.060]   can serve the most people in the most effective way is ultimately the man who winds up becoming
[00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:41.220]   the greatest.
[00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:46.700]   All of the greatest entrepreneurs of our culture, the people that we lionize, became well appreciated
[00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:49.900]   by the public because they served the public effectively.
[00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:51.180]   They served their customers.
[00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:56.180]   And in a country where we love one another and we serve one another, we can have lots
[00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:57.580]   of nice things.
[00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:03.060]   But if we aren't willing to humble ourselves and genuinely serve one another, all of our
[00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:05.780]   nice things will disappear.
[00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:07.500]   That's what I observed in Haiti.
[00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:09.180]   That's what I observe happening.
[00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:14.340]   Now it should be no surprise to you where Haiti is today because the situation that
[00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:20.340]   you see today, the horrific, awful situation that you see today is the natural outgrowth
[00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:24.820]   of this philosophy, this philosophy of battling with one another.
[00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:29.480]   And when you bring all of the other human failings and sins into it, of corruption and
[00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:32.420]   all the stuff, it just exacerbates it.
[00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:34.980]   But that was my experience in Haiti.
[00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:38.540]   The other thing I want to point out to you is that you don't need a newspaper to tell
[00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:39.800]   you these things.
[00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:42.500]   You can sense the truth for yourself.
[00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:47.180]   Yes, I speak a little bit of French and so I was able to have access to the Haitian culture.
[00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:51.780]   But I didn't even need French to access that feeling.
[00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:56.340]   I knew very, very quickly that something was dreadfully wrong in the society.
[00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:59.740]   And I got out as quickly of the country as I was able to.
[00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:04.660]   Today, there are thousands and thousands and thousands of people who are fleeing Haiti
[00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:08.860]   trying to escape to the Dominican Republic or elsewhere, trying to escape to South America,
[00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:11.180]   trying to get into the United States, across the border.
[00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:15.140]   There are many, many people who are fleeing, but it's not easy to flee today.
[00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:17.700]   It's not nearly as easy as it was many years ago.
[00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:22.660]   So remember this other truth, that if you see a society heading in the wrong direction,
[00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:26.580]   if you see people arguing with one another, unwilling to submit to one another, unwilling
[00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:31.700]   to serve one another with a free and glad heart, make a plan.
[00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:36.860]   This is one of the reasons why I built International Escape Plan, www.internationalescapeplan.com,
[00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:39.580]   the course that I taught on getting out.
[00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:46.180]   Any Haitian who got out of Haiti years ago is extremely satisfied with his choice today.
[00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:49.940]   You do not want to be among those who are heading last minute to the airport or heading
[00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:54.380]   last minute to the border, trying to bribe someone to get your way out so you and your
[00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:56.020]   family can make it.
[00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:57.620]   Let Haiti be a lesson to you.
[00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:00.220]   Number one, serve your neighbor.
[00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:06.780]   There's a reason why when I do Q&A calls, I always say, "How can I serve you today?"
[00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:13.820]   I want to serve you every single day, and I want to spread the attitude of service in
[00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:20.340]   every cultural corner of the world that I can myself impact with my example, with my
[00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:21.620]   leadership.
[00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:24.060]   Service is the foundation of a healthy society.
[00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:30.500]   And when that service is missing due to arrogant pride, ridiculous pride of your unwillingness
[00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:34.980]   to humble yourself and serve another human being because of the cultural baggage of what
[00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:39.920]   happened to your ancestors, you are never going to wind up in a good situation.
[00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:40.920]   Study Haiti.
[00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:45.020]   If you see problems happening in your country, if you see a breakdown of society, make a
[00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:48.740]   plan to get out if you ever need to.
[00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:50.660]   InternationalSkatePlan.com if you're interested in my course.
[00:10:50.660 --> 00:11:15.460]   I'll be back with you very soon.
[00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:22.660]   Thank you.
