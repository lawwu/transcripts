[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.300]   - Welcome to the "Bogleheads" Chapter Series.
[00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.980]   This episode was jointly hosted by the Tampa Bay
[00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.480]   and South Florida Chapters and recorded June 22nd, 2021.
[00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.940]   It features Mark Zorrell and Jason Lynch
[00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.740]   demonstrating the PlanVision service and e-money platform.
[00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.200]   Bogleheads are investors who follow
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.080]   John Bogle's investing philosophy
[00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.360]   for attaining financial independence.
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.960]   This recording is for informational purposes only
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.520]   and should not be construed as investment advice.
[00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.800]   Welcome everybody to this joint meeting
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.920]   of the Tampa Bay and South Florida Bogleheads Chapters.
[00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.640]   We're pleased to have Mark Zorrell and Jason Lynch
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.800]   joining us again, this time to demo their PlanVision service
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.320]   and the e-money advisor platform.
[00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.760]   They were with us back in April for our joint meeting.
[00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.480]   At that time, they presented a number of financial topics
[00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.800]   for consideration both before and during retirement,
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.720]   as well as their perspectives on the future of technology
[00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.820]   in the financial advice sector.
[00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.160]   This meeting is for informational purposes only
[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.960]   and should not be construed as personalized investing advice.
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.320]   I wanna thank Miriam, the South Florida coordinator
[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.120]   for assisting us this evening.
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.520]   And we will be taking questions
[00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.520]   throughout the presentation,
[00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.680]   but please hold them until we have a break.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   For brief background, Mark Zorrell,
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.720]   who's the founder of PlanVision around 2012, I believe,
[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.560]   has 27 years of experience
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.760]   in the financial services industry.
[00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.840]   He started his career helping smaller companies
[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.760]   establish employer-based retirement plans.
[00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.200]   And subsequently, his efforts have evolved
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.080]   to primarily helping individuals plan
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.040]   and prepare for their financial futures.
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.600]   Jason Lynch joined PlanVision in February, 2020,
[00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.480]   after spending the last 18 years in private accounting,
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.040]   as well as 12 years in public accounting,
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.840]   working with taxes for high net worth clients
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.480]   and their businesses.
[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.400]   He's been indexing since the mid '90s
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.680]   and is a true Boglehead,
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.760]   having attended the National Conference in 2016
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.000]   and being a regular presenter
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   at his local Michigan Bogleheads chapter.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.760]   So without further ado,
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.720]   I'll turn this over to Mark and Jason.
[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.080]   - I'll provide an overview of PlanVision
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.840]   and kind of our approach,
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.360]   and then we'll go into the money, the program,
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.960]   and I'll make some comments about how we use that
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.440]   and how it can be used kind of as a tool
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.920]   for people to help plan for their future.
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.840]   You wanna flip forward?
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:44.320]   Yeah, so that's just the front page of our website.
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.920]   Some comments that I would make,
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.040]   if you wanna go on to the next slide, Jason.
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.760]   Yeah, so our view is very much a Boglehead type,
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.520]   mentality that investors can have great portfolios,
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.480]   simple, low cost financial planning investment advice.
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.000]   Not only do we think that the financial services industry
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.160]   grossly overcomplicates investing
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.120]   so that people think they need their services,
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.880]   but also when it comes to financial planning advice,
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.640]   we think that can be done very quickly and very efficiently
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.800]   if you're independent and you use technology well.
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.280]   So that's a big part of how we go about
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.720]   what we do here at PlanVision.
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.760]   And e-money is a critical part of that.
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:34.560]   We use e-money as basically our hub for client information,
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.880]   and they have a great client portal we'll go through.
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.360]   And also in our interactions with our clients,
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.760]   we use Salesforce a lot.
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.880]   We have integrations built between a company called Alchemy
[00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.200]   and Salesforce so that their data flows into our system.
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.760]   It's not personal data.
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.880]   It's more their investing and guidance preferences.
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.520]   We have clients in 50 states.
[00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.400]   And then we work with over a hundred nationalities.
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.440]   And I think it's, gosh, it must be more,
[00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.560]   almost approaching a hundred countries around the world.
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.080]   So a lot of what are called expatriates,
[00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.000]   and there probably are some people here even on the session
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.160]   that might end up wanting to move overseas later in life.
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.120]   We work with a lot of those folks
[00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:23.120]   to help them navigate those challenges.
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:28.400]   And I should also mention that about 2 1/2 years ago
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.840]   as an advisor, I reached out to Vanguard
[00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.880]   and spoke with the folks on their international,
[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.600]   and in their international areas,
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.160]   they believe to be their highest growth area.
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.320]   And what's happening is the message
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.680]   of this kind of investing, index-based investing,
[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.480]   the bogo head philosophy is going around the world.
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:52.000]   In fact, our largest clientele out of the US
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.360]   is out of the UAE.
[00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.080]   We are promoted, or are promoted,
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.000]   but we're very well known in the UAE
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.120]   through a bogo head group there,
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.840]   the Simplify Bogo Head community.
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.080]   So that's pretty cool.
[00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:07.360]   So next screen, please.
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:12.880]   Yeah, so eMoney Advisor is a system
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.540]   that we license as an advisory firm.
[00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:21.140]   It has a huge range of capability that's built into it.
[00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:28.340]   We're not even, 3,500, I think, give or take.
[00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:29.540]   We've worked with far more than that.
[00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:31.380]   We have about 3,500 clients right now.
[00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:32.580]   There was a question here.
[00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.000]   (indistinct)
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:41.100]   So eMoney has a broad range of capability,
[00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:42.260]   both in the platform.
[00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.060]   It's incredibly robust and powerful.
[00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:46.260]   A lot of the work we do on our side,
[00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.300]   our clients can do some modeling on their side.
[00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.100]   It was acquired by Fidelity in 2015.
[00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:55.640]   Important comments about eMoney.
[00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:59.700]   The client is not the...
[00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:03.100]   The client is not our client.
[00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:05.140]   We are the eMoney client.
[00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:07.820]   So we interface directly with them.
[00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:11.600]   Our clients cannot interface directly with eMoney.
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.160]   I hope to someday,
[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.920]   and I kind of joke with our clients about this,
[00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:16.800]   I hope to someday not actually have to interact
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.320]   with our clients using eMoney on their own.
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:23.640]   And we're actually coming out with a new website
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:24.480]   later on this year,
[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.720]   where we hope to give a lot more of the tools
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.880]   to help our clients use eMoney more directly on their own,
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:31.720]   a lot more videos and explanations.
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:36.680]   But it is run by us, the advisors.
[00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.240]   We do the deep modeling.
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.840]   Our clients can do some minimal modeling.
[00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.240]   So with that, we'll go ahead and get into it.
[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:48.160]   We're gonna go through,
[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.000]   just to remind you,
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.280]   it is an advisor-based platform, as I went into.
[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.440]   We'll go into the client functionality
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.960]   and then the advisor functionality as well.
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.800]   But we'll kind of walk you through
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.680]   the screens that we go through with our clients
[00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:03.640]   and show some of the things that we help them accomplish.
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:08.040]   This is the client portal.
[00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:09.160]   So this is what your screen looks like.
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.520]   And this will change over time as they come out with new,
[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:14.880]   nevermind, there may be some of our clients on the call
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:16.760]   or people that have used eMoney as well.
[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:19.600]   And this is just the basic client portal.
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:20.880]   They are updating this.
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:24.120]   I think you can get a little more information on this,
[00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.840]   depending upon how you set up the portal for yourself,
[00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:29.280]   but this is the home screen for the client portal.
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:32.280]   And then you go on to the next screen, Jason.
[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.760]   And then you go on to the next screen, Jason.
[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:39.280]   So this is the organizer.
[00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:43.160]   Now, when our clients begin the process,
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:44.840]   they go to the organizer
[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:46.640]   and they go into the account section.
[00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:49.600]   I think you have a screen on that one too, Jason.
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:51.080]   Yeah, you go into the account section
[00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:54.280]   and you can integrate all of your accounts
[00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:55.400]   into the platform.
[00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:57.040]   Now you can do one of two ways.
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:58.680]   One is you can actually link them,
[00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:00.240]   which is what most of our clients do
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:02.560]   that requires a user ID and password,
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:04.200]   or you can add them manually.
[00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:06.040]   If you link them,
[00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:10.640]   then they will be updated for the most part
[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:12.160]   on a regular basis.
[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:16.480]   Some of these connections will break periodically.
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:19.120]   Some of the larger ones need to go through overhauls
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:19.960]   every once in a while,
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:22.040]   where they'll just kind of have to clean them up
[00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:24.160]   and then our clients have to go reconnect them.
[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:26.320]   But you can have the data current and live.
[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:29.840]   What is interesting to see,
[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:34.080]   if your data is live
[00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:36.560]   and you're one of our clients that logs in every day
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:38.920]   to see how close retirement's getting,
[00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:42.640]   if your data is live and the markets go down a lot,
[00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:45.200]   oh gosh, your graphs will look quite a bit different.
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:47.520]   This happened in March of last year.
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:49.880]   People thought retirement was a year or two years away.
[00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:52.000]   All of a sudden it looked pretty grim.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.240]   So if you're connected,
[00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:56.640]   you'll see that kind of activity in the reporting area.
[00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:57.920]   But also if you do it manually,
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:59.840]   a lot of clients just prefer doing it manually.
[00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:01.880]   They're uncomfortable with the security
[00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:04.240]   and they're very comfortable just doing it themselves.
[00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:07.560]   It's pretty easy to log in and update your accounts here
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:08.880]   manually in the organizer.
[00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:12.120]   Another tab in the organizer area
[00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:14.480]   is your income expenses and savings.
[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:18.560]   A comment that I would make here is that
[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:19.680]   for many of our clients,
[00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:21.200]   and I'll get into a few of the areas
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:24.280]   where you can do your own modeling,
[00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:27.120]   for many of our clients,
[00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:29.160]   they will think to themselves,
[00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.360]   I do wanna retire someday in the future,
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:34.840]   but I'm not gonna fully retire.
[00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:37.400]   I wanna go work part-time or make some income.
[00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:38.960]   And in the annual income,
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:41.000]   that is an area that they can do their own modeling.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.440]   They can pick different,
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:45.080]   making different levels of income
[00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:47.000]   for different periods of time.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.680]   They can also enter pensions in here
[00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:50.880]   and then different salary structures.
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:52.440]   The savings you'll see down at the bottom
[00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:54.440]   are just any sort of savings
[00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:57.360]   that represent annual contribution towards their future.
[00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:02.560]   Okay, and here is where our clients,
[00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:05.120]   this is another area where our clients can model
[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:05.960]   the retirement date.
[00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:07.800]   You can go here and change your retirement date
[00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:09.280]   and then go look at the reports.
[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:12.280]   In this case, this client has two children.
[00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:14.960]   They're putting in their future educational expenses.
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:16.560]   The educational planning program,
[00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:19.320]   any money is quite robust.
[00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:22.720]   It's a module that's integrated.
[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:24.600]   Excuse me, the data is integrated,
[00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.760]   but there are separate college planning reports
[00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:28.960]   that are produced by eMoney.
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:32.480]   And also it can identify expenses by college.
[00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:33.960]   If you really wanna get into
[00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:37.880]   how some level of precision on your expenses
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:39.800]   for college expenses.
[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:42.560]   Now, the major expenses you're seeing down there,
[00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:45.840]   that's a really critical component of any projection.
[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:47.600]   These represent the expenses
[00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:49.800]   that you think you're going to have
[00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:51.920]   either if you're in retirement
[00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:55.680]   or if you're projecting out towards retirement.
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:57.240]   There's a lot of variation in this.
[00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:00.720]   You can pick expenses for certain periods of time
[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:02.560]   and that's fairly valuable.
[00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:05.000]   We believe most retirees
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.320]   are going to wanna have graduated expenses
[00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:08.400]   during retirement.
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:11.240]   Maybe have a higher level from 55 to 65,
[00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:15.440]   maybe a lower level from 65 to 75 and so on.
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:17.040]   And you can do all of this on your own
[00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:19.920]   if you really enjoy doing some additional modeling
[00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:23.640]   here in the future goals area of the organizer.
[00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:26.680]   (indistinct)
[00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:27.760]   So the vault,
[00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:31.240]   a lot of our clients will share their information with us.
[00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:33.800]   Some of us send basically all the documents
[00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:34.640]   they've ever had
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:37.680]   or accumulated in their entire life to the vault,
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:41.880]   but it is secure and so you can upload documents there.
[00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:43.760]   Jason does a lot and he'll talk about this later.
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:46.080]   He does a lot of tax planning with our clients
[00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:49.840]   and our clients will upload their 1099s or their tax forms
[00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:52.720]   and he'll be able to use those by sharing them here.
[00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:55.440]   (mouse clicking)
[00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:56.960]   So this is the reporting area.
[00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:58.240]   Now the reporting,
[00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:03.520]   eMoney produces a very broad array of reports.
[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:04.920]   Now, when we do presentations,
[00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:07.560]   we concentrate on about three to four of them,
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.960]   but there's a lot if you wanna pick through here
[00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:12.680]   and you can also have your own favorites
[00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:15.800]   as far as reports that you might wanna see more frequently.
[00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:17.320]   The ones that are the most valuable
[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:18.760]   and we'll see those a little bit on the side
[00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:22.480]   that we go through tonight would be the cash flow report.
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:25.840]   That is far and away the best report for planning purposes.
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:27.280]   The balance sheet is useful
[00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:28.960]   if you're interested in seeing where your net worth is
[00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:30.440]   and there's actually a few different balance sheets
[00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:31.880]   you can look at.
[00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:34.760]   Your assets, we're gonna go into the assets report as well.
[00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:36.980]   There's a really nice tax type report.
[00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:39.840]   Yeah, we will get into that
[00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:41.600]   about the Roth conversion planning.
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:44.080]   And then there's a few more.
[00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:47.320]   Actually, if you see the little elevator shaft
[00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:49.560]   to the right of the dropdown report,
[00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:51.240]   that goes down pretty far.
[00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:53.240]   Very nice income tax reports.
[00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:56.840]   In fact, Jason had a nice project with a client of ours
[00:12:56.840 --> 00:13:00.160]   where he really had to delve into depth
[00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.720]   on the different data points
[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:04.460]   that were being produced by e-money,
[00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:06.400]   but it was quite revealing for this client
[00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:09.160]   as far as how his income taxes were being calculated
[00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:11.160]   and how it was integrating his capital gains,
[00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:13.760]   his dividends, the whole nine yards into the program.
[00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:20.200]   So, yeah, I think that that's it.
[00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:22.800]   Now, I'm gonna use this as a break.
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:26.940]   We talked earlier about maybe a natural break.
[00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:30.700]   This is, I finished going through the client portal.
[00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:32.440]   So if there were any questions here,
[00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:34.200]   I think there was at least one question
[00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:37.120]   about Roth conversion planning, and I'm going,
[00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:39.520]   Jason and I will go into that on the other side.
[00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:43.040]   I can't recall if there were any other questions.
[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:44.100]   Barry had a question?
[00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:49.360]   Do I need to open the chat?
[00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:50.200]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:51.960]   If anybody, if I can interrupt,
[00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:55.280]   if anybody wishes to ask their question directly on the mic,
[00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:58.280]   please use the raised hand icon
[00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:00.500]   and you'll float to the top of the screen
[00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:01.340]   where we can see you.
[00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:05.440]   We'll alternate that with questions submitted via the chat.
[00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:07.280]   - Okay, he's at the top of the class.
[00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:09.720]   - All righty, Barry?
[00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:10.920]   - Yeah, so I had a quick question
[00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:13.640]   about how you handle 401k plans,
[00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:15.520]   which have like collective investment trusts
[00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:18.320]   where you're not gonna have a public ticker,
[00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:21.620]   might not be able to get some market data so easily.
[00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:23.560]   - Yeah, that's actually quite common.
[00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:27.920]   So let me just also rephrase that question
[00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:29.680]   for everyone else.
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:32.160]   The question's about a 401k plan,
[00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:34.640]   collective investment trusts are not publicly traded.
[00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:39.640]   In fact, in many, in many retirement plans,
[00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:41.600]   they just, they brand these things
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:43.480]   and you can't get a ticker on them anyway,
[00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:44.520]   even if they're like, you know,
[00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:46.200]   General Electric's 401k plan,
[00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:48.440]   they'll have their own S&P 500.
[00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:49.800]   What we can do in the,
[00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:51.800]   and actually some of our clients can do this.
[00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:54.120]   They can actually pick the asset class.
[00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:56.600]   If they can't do it, then we can do it for them.
[00:14:56.600 --> 00:15:00.720]   So we can identify what is the correct asset class
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:01.700]   for that holding.
[00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:07.240]   Somebody had a question about who enters the data.
[00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:11.480]   Good question, I hadn't thought about doing that.
[00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:14.080]   When you subscribe for our service,
[00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:17.520]   what we do is we send you the link from eMoney
[00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:19.680]   and we send you this email that says,
[00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:22.140]   hey, you signed up for us, you're doing the homework.
[00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:24.280]   So you have to go to the website,
[00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:26.640]   watch the videos and enter all the data.
[00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:30.440]   So I think when we roll out our $2,000 program,
[00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:32.240]   then we'll start to take entry.
[00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:35.560]   But $189, it's going to be up to the clients
[00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:36.720]   to do the data entry.
[00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:39.040]   I have heard from many of our clients
[00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:40.820]   that they actually kind of like the process
[00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:41.660]   of going through this.
[00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:45.860]   It's a way for them to get their head around
[00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:48.360]   what their assets are and kind of clean things up.
[00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:53.720]   Now there were some more things in the chat here.
[00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:56.200]   I don't know if those are questions that I can answer.
[00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:59.720]   - Whether you could add your own information to the program.
[00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:03.900]   - I'm sorry, Miriam, is that a question?
[00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:06.220]   - Yeah, that was one of the questions in the chat.
[00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:07.740]   Let me see if it was,
[00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:14.680]   that clients can add their own information
[00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:16.260]   in terms of data entry.
[00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:20.040]   - Yes, they can.
[00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:22.760]   They'll be able to log in their side and see if they can.
[00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:24.500]   First of all, they'll see if the connections are working
[00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:25.340]   or not working.
[00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:27.000]   You'll get a message if they're broken.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.580]   Or if you just want to update a manual,
[00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:30.260]   you can do that anytime.
[00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:33.340]   You know, I mentioned that we have all these expats.
[00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:37.880]   We do financial plans for people
[00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:41.780]   that are getting paid in Korean won and Japanese yen.
[00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:44.100]   I mean, it's like a hundred million dollars,
[00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:45.540]   a hundred million yen is what they're.
[00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:46.860]   So they can do it.
[00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:48.620]   All of those folks do it manually.
[00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:51.380]   So they type in, they just update their stuff manually.
[00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:54.580]   There's a question, a couple of questions more.
[00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:57.760]   - Which reports can the client run unassisted?
[00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:01.780]   - Is there a capability of?
[00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:05.180]   - They can run all of the reports that are shown here.
[00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:07.700]   There's well over 200.
[00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:09.160]   Many of them don't apply.
[00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:11.160]   There's a lot of stock option reports,
[00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:15.160]   but clients can run all of the reports
[00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:17.020]   without contacting us.
[00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:19.760]   - Yeah, what they'll do a lot of times,
[00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:20.600]   there's a button here.
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:22.420]   I don't even think it's showing up.
[00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:24.660]   It might be hidden right here where you can do,
[00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:27.780]   you can just do a web print that will print that.
[00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:30.120]   Now we'll get into this.
[00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:31.920]   We're going to get some of the stuff on the other side here,
[00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:35.960]   but we will produce a lot of reports on our side
[00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:37.640]   and we immediately drop them in the vault
[00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:39.560]   if they're reports that we're doing.
[00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:42.060]   Can e-money keep track of TIA traditional?
[00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:45.720]   If you link your TIA account,
[00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:47.080]   TIA had a huge break.
[00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:48.080]   I think it was a year and a half,
[00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:50.280]   but lasted for like four or five months,
[00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:51.720]   but now it's working again,
[00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:53.280]   but it will connect the TIA account.
[00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:55.600]   We can label it as a fixed account.
[00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:57.560]   Is there a capability of one-time changes?
[00:17:57.560 --> 00:17:58.400]   Yes.
[00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:00.420]   This is a good question.
[00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:03.420]   Downsizing or a windfall such as an inheritance?
[00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:04.260]   Yes.
[00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:07.620]   So in e-money that's called a buy-sell transaction
[00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:08.460]   if you're downsizing.
[00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:10.660]   We sell the house and we buy a new one.
[00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:13.060]   That's programming we would do on our side.
[00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:16.380]   Inheritances are handled quite effectively in e-money
[00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:19.140]   in that we can introduce assets later in life.
[00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:21.020]   We can have them show up in the future.
[00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:24.720]   So that's a part of the robustness that e-money has.
[00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:27.840]   That's kind of behind the scenes that we do a lot of.
[00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:29.540]   If I were to recommend,
[00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:33.180]   is there anything I should tell that he should get together
[00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:35.780]   or will tell them they need to do data entry?
[00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:37.820]   Well, yeah, they're going to have to enter
[00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:39.380]   their finances basically.
[00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:41.860]   I mean, if they want us to do a plan,
[00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:46.660]   they'll want to enter their accounts
[00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:47.900]   and when they think they're going to retire
[00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:49.300]   and that kind of thing.
[00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:51.400]   I'm a Fidelity customer and have done some.
[00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:57.620]   Here's a question about Fidelity customer
[00:18:57.620 --> 00:19:00.060]   and have done some e-money simulation.
[00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:04.780]   My understanding of this is that the version
[00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:09.580]   that's used by Fidelity is a more limited version
[00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:10.400]   than this one.
[00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:15.000]   Like there's, I think that they want you to work out,
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.500]   reach out to their advisors and use them.
[00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:18.780]   That's all I'm aware of.
[00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:21.140]   Would like more control and hope it's separate.
[00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:25.220]   Well, you have control of the client portal
[00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:27.880]   and you can do some of the planning we just went through
[00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:30.500]   to do the detailed planning.
[00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:34.200]   Oh, here's a follow-up question.
[00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:35.680]   I'm sorry, my question is whether there's anything
[00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:37.700]   a tenant needs to organize or get, no.
[00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:41.600]   No, you don't need, no, you just got to have it.
[00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:44.200]   - You have all your financial information,
[00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:46.400]   if you're going to enter manually or even aggregate it,
[00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:48.120]   you need to have all your account information
[00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:50.140]   and make sure you're organized in advance,
[00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:52.320]   but your process walks people through that.
[00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:55.160]   So they can do it over time.
[00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:57.560]   It doesn't have to be necessarily all at once.
[00:19:57.560 --> 00:19:59.520]   - Yeah, we've had clients that have taken over a year
[00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:01.160]   to get around to getting their stuff in.
[00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:03.520]   Others will do it on a, like an evening.
[00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:06.580]   So it can vary depending upon how excited.
[00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:10.520]   - Here's another question which asks,
[00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:13.480]   when you mentioned, Mark, about doing a plan,
[00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:18.480]   you doing a plan, what does that mean?
[00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:23.200]   - I think, well, I guess the way I would answer the question
[00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:27.760]   is a plan, it depends on where people are coming from,
[00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:29.600]   but generally speaking, it might be an assessment
[00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:32.840]   of where you're at today, you know,
[00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:34.300]   how healthy are you financially?
[00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:35.480]   What is your savings potential?
[00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:36.680]   Is your insurance covered?
[00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:39.320]   We can do that pretty quickly if the data is entered,
[00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:42.880]   but doing a plan, generally speaking,
[00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:44.620]   is a projection out to the future.
[00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:46.620]   How are you standing for your goal?
[00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:49.300]   Which for virtually all of our clients
[00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:51.720]   is retirement planning.
[00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:54.320]   And then it just has a,
[00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:57.640]   the way it naturally unfolds when you do a plan
[00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:00.200]   is you would address what are the right place,
[00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:02.480]   you know, what are the right accounts to be saving money in?
[00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:06.320]   Should I do pre-tax Roth or pre-tax Roth in my foreign case?
[00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:07.880]   Should I do Roth conversions?
[00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:12.440]   Where should I, what assets might I sell
[00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:15.120]   when I need to access the funds?
[00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:16.860]   That's all part of the plan,
[00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:18.960]   but it's just a general financial plan.
[00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:22.240]   And we certainly do discuss how we feel
[00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:24.160]   about our clients' insurance needs.
[00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:25.720]   We'll provide comments on that.
[00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:30.520]   - I've got a question, Mark, if I can interject.
[00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:31.880]   I'm sure a lot of people are probably wondering
[00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:34.520]   for being such a low price point,
[00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:38.080]   what is the typical amount of time
[00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:40.080]   that you would spend with a client
[00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:43.500]   and how would they organize themselves over time
[00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:45.560]   to best use your service?
[00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:51.400]   - Well, that second one,
[00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:54.000]   I'll have to think of an answer there.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   I would say in the first year, probably two to three hours.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:04.780]   And that, you know, I have normally with all of our clients,
[00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:07.640]   we have a 50 minute full planning session
[00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:11.200]   and we can cover most of the detail of their plan.
[00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:12.840]   And that's where, when I mentioned earlier,
[00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:14.640]   I think that the financial services industry
[00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:17.180]   overcomplicates financial planning
[00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:19.080]   is with a tool like this, it's getting easier.
[00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:21.160]   And we can do that on a more timely basis.
[00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:24.160]   So anyways, but there's upfront work they need to do
[00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:27.000]   with Jason or Christian to get the plan clean.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:27.840]   They have a meeting with me
[00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:29.660]   and then there may be some follow-up work.
[00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:33.600]   Jason has had, depending upon our client's complexity,
[00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:36.080]   he's had multiple follow-up sessions with clients.
[00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:37.840]   So some clients can take more time.
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:39.760]   Other clients, frankly, it's just really simple.
[00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:42.600]   There's not a lot of chit-chat in their situation.
[00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:45.700]   But I would say probably an hour and a half to three hours
[00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:50.700]   the first year, maybe, I don't know,
[00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:54.520]   a half an hour going forward every year.
[00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:56.460]   Some people, you know,
[00:22:56.460 --> 00:23:00.260]   some people have more questions than others.
[00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:03.720]   What was your second question, Alan?
[00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:04.840]   I'm sorry.
[00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:06.600]   - Well, based on how to prioritize,
[00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:11.120]   I guess from my perspective as a fairly new client as well,
[00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:14.000]   I tried to focus on a few key questions that I had
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.780]   and I figured I would follow up
[00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:19.500]   with less lower priority things down the road.
[00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:21.180]   'Cause obviously there's a limited amount of time
[00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:24.560]   that we can spend face-to-face virtually on this.
[00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:30.220]   - Well, I guess the way that we leave it with our clients
[00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:33.300]   when we do plans with them is that they can simply reach out
[00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:35.940]   to us anytime they have questions or needs
[00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:38.340]   and they set up a session with us.
[00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:43.340]   We almost, I mean, I can think of maybe,
[00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:48.020]   I've been doing this quite a while now,
[00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:51.980]   the high volume of clients, maybe less than five clients
[00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:54.180]   that just kept on coming back and back
[00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:55.980]   with more and more questions.
[00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:57.860]   And of course, in any client base,
[00:23:57.860 --> 00:23:58.860]   you're gonna have more and more,
[00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:00.540]   you're gonna have some of that.
[00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:05.020]   But most of our clients seem to,
[00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:07.540]   they kind of get that this is not a thing
[00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:10.340]   where you need to sit down with us every quarter
[00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:11.860]   and go over stuff.
[00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:14.940]   So they seem to be able to figure out the questions
[00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:17.380]   that make the most sense for their situation.
[00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:20.460]   Not sure if I'm adequately answering the question, but.
[00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:21.300]   - That's good.
[00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:22.980]   There's a couple more chat questions that have come in.
[00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:24.960]   I'll go ahead and pick up some of these.
[00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:27.100]   One of them, let's see,
[00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:29.580]   somebody's asking if plan vision can link
[00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:30.940]   to some of the newer brokerages
[00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:33.620]   such as Wealthfront or M1 Finance.
[00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:34.800]   I would think so, but.
[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:36.620]   - Well, Wealthfront, I think so.
[00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:39.180]   M1, no, and Robinhood, no.
[00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:42.380]   And what we've been told by eMoney
[00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:44.460]   is they don't wanna connect with eMoney, right?
[00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:45.620]   I don't know if that's true or not,
[00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:47.460]   but that's what we've been told.
[00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:49.100]   - Yeah, but folks could also manually enter
[00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:49.940]   in their holdings.
[00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:51.500]   - Yeah, they could.
[00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:53.540]   - And also, can financial plans be tailored
[00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:56.020]   to the specific needs of unmarried couples
[00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:58.420]   or people with disabilities?
[00:24:58.420 --> 00:25:01.540]   Or would you say those concerns are too specifically complex
[00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:03.580]   for a high volume business like yours,
[00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:05.180]   high volume model business like yours?
[00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:06.620]   - Well, the unmarried couples,
[00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:08.980]   if you're just talking about different tax planning,
[00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:11.180]   the system will handle that perfectly fine.
[00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:15.740]   We have a lot of clients
[00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:17.620]   that are not married and filed separately.
[00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:18.840]   We do have several clients.
[00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:20.540]   Jason has interacted with clients
[00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:23.140]   that have children that have disabilities.
[00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:25.740]   We don't wanna pretend that we can help them
[00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:27.900]   in more of the advanced planning needs of that area,
[00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:30.500]   but we can certainly help them do financial planning.
[00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:34.860]   Even though our business is high volume,
[00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:37.940]   man, we get into some details with our clients.
[00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:39.700]   So we can go pretty far.
[00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:41.180]   I don't think you're gonna...
[00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:43.780]   I think there's a...
[00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:47.140]   I think if you were to find a financial advisory firm
[00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:49.700]   that's specialized in families
[00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:51.740]   with children of disabilities,
[00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:55.380]   then they would be a better suited to meet your trust needs
[00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:56.620]   and that kind of thing.
[00:25:56.620 --> 00:25:58.420]   That's just something we're not aware of.
[00:25:58.420 --> 00:25:59.700]   But when it comes to actual planning,
[00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:01.300]   we can really go into detail.
[00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:03.380]   - Yeah, very good.
[00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:05.080]   - Here's a good question here also.
[00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:08.140]   What type of individual or planning questions
[00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:10.500]   would not be a good fit for your company?
[00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:21.220]   - Well, people...
[00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:23.220]   I don't think there's gonna be anybody on this call,
[00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:28.220]   but people that think that e-money
[00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:32.180]   will tell them how their life
[00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:35.140]   is gonna unfold financially the next four years.
[00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:37.780]   And we've had clients like, "It's not a match."
[00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:40.300]   And I will get some of those from the FHIR community,
[00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:43.980]   not that many, but they wanna know if saving,
[00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:48.100]   let's say $300 a month or 310 is like the...
[00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:50.380]   What is the exact dollar amount I need to save to get there?
[00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:51.740]   So if there's a level...
[00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:53.220]   And I think they would actually...
[00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:55.040]   I don't even think they're a match for many other advisors,
[00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:56.740]   but depending on how much,
[00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:58.620]   how precise they wanna be in their planning,
[00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:00.660]   they may not be a good match.
[00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:03.740]   Yeah, if they wanna visit with us every two months or so,
[00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:06.380]   just update their plan or go over it in depth,
[00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:08.080]   they're not gonna be a good match.
[00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:11.660]   Now, there's another...
[00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:13.060]   I mean, I don't know how...
[00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:14.980]   Maybe just the software engineers out there,
[00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:19.980]   but those people that wanna really do it themselves,
[00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:22.460]   they want to run the plan.
[00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:24.020]   They're gonna end up being dissatisfied.
[00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:27.060]   I just had a guy by yesterday, he sent me an email saying,
[00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:28.740]   "Well, Mark, how far can I actually look?"
[00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:30.340]   If you really think you're gonna do all the planning,
[00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:31.860]   you're just gonna be frustrated with this program
[00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:33.300]   'cause it's a great program,
[00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:36.120]   but we will do the detailed planning for you.
[00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:39.820]   Is it, yes.
[00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:42.020]   Is it possible to start with manual and...
[00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:43.580]   Yeah, you can do that for sure.
[00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:45.420]   Does Jason do any tech?
[00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:47.540]   No. (laughs)
[00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:50.780]   No, we don't do any tech.
[00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:51.880]   - No, thank you.
[00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:53.700]   (Mark laughs)
[00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:55.060]   - And one thing, you mentioned a Christian
[00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:58.260]   and that's another assistant you have,
[00:27:58.260 --> 00:28:01.180]   an associate who walks through with the client
[00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:03.940]   to make sure that e-money has been properly filled out
[00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:05.620]   with the information you need.
[00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:08.020]   So that's an important first step really
[00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:09.820]   in massaging the data
[00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:12.140]   and making it all presentable and thorough.
[00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:13.820]   - Yeah, thanks, Alan.
[00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:15.840]   So the process is you buy the service,
[00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:19.060]   you load all your data and then you submit this checklist.
[00:28:19.060 --> 00:28:21.260]   And the checklist is really a tool for us
[00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:23.980]   and for you to kind of track how you're coming along.
[00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:25.580]   But then once you submit the checklist,
[00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:26.980]   that's telling us you think you've entered
[00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:28.740]   as much as you can with e-money.
[00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:30.780]   Well, we certainly don't expect it to be perfect.
[00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:32.180]   And then you have a session with Christian,
[00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:33.100]   he cleans it up.
[00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:35.580]   And Jason actually has these sessions too.
[00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:38.480]   I used to do them, but since we've grown.
[00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:43.480]   And then it's relatively clean by the time it gets to me.
[00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:48.820]   So, I think that that is all of the questions.
[00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:53.900]   - Any further questions at this point?
[00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:57.580]   If not, we'll proceed.
[00:28:57.580 --> 00:29:00.580]   - Okay.
[00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:03.460]   So this is the advisor side of the platform.
[00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:05.980]   Now, when we have sessions with our clients,
[00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:07.080]   this is where we work at.
[00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:07.920]   We just show this.
[00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:09.420]   These sessions are very interactive.
[00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:12.300]   We go back and forth and I'll ask the clients questions.
[00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:14.180]   They can interject with changes,
[00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:15.340]   but this is how we work from.
[00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:17.040]   So this is what this portal looks at.
[00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:19.940]   The portal does lay out differently over here
[00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:21.860]   than it does on the advisor.
[00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:23.820]   One thing I should mention,
[00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:25.540]   I don't know if it's obvious or not,
[00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:28.920]   but I mean, where I see this whole thing going
[00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:31.540]   in the long run is that these kinds of programs,
[00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:34.500]   e-money and maybe who knows what's gonna come along next,
[00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:36.300]   are going to get easier and easier
[00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:39.280]   for the lay person to use.
[00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:41.740]   You know, where, I mean, I view plan vision
[00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:43.620]   as being a bit of an intermediary right now
[00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:46.020]   between the information that helps the client
[00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:49.700]   better understand their life and e-money.
[00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:52.300]   So we just, we provide guidance and comments on it,
[00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:57.000]   but it'd be pretty slick at some point down the road
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.780]   where the client just has access to this.
[00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:01.600]   They hire us for a few dollars
[00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:03.400]   and we just provide some insights on it
[00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:05.300]   and then they get on with their life.
[00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:09.920]   So anyways, so this is what the overview screen looks like
[00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:10.900]   on our side.
[00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:12.860]   You can go on to the next screen, Jason.
[00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:17.300]   So we work off two tabs with our clients,
[00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:19.300]   the facts tab and the reports tab.
[00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:21.140]   And the facts are just your circumstances.
[00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:22.380]   So we start there.
[00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:25.200]   We confirm everything, date of birth.
[00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:28.900]   Now, the retirement age, that's, I ask people now, is that?
[00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:32.720]   Oh, someone's asking here.
[00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:35.420]   Yeah, we charge $189 for the first year
[00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:38.920]   and then $8 each month after that, if you renew.
[00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:44.100]   The retirement age, we do ask our clients,
[00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:45.620]   is that when you want to retire
[00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:47.680]   or when you think you have to retire?
[00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:49.400]   Or did you just use that as a marker?
[00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:52.180]   So we use that as a good way to get started.
[00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:53.980]   They can enter their children in here
[00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:56.100]   and then if they have any other family
[00:30:56.100 --> 00:30:57.820]   or whomever they want to do.
[00:30:57.820 --> 00:30:58.760]   Next slide.
[00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:04.780]   So that was the basic, I'm sorry.
[00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:06.460]   That was the basic facts.
[00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:08.300]   Now we're in the advanced facts.
[00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:11.060]   And this is just the facts with a bit more detail.
[00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:13.260]   So at this point, what we'll do is we'll go
[00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:15.460]   from kind of area to area
[00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:17.580]   confirming the client's information.
[00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:21.260]   So you want to see what's next, Jason?
[00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:25.600]   Yeah, so now we're in the planning area
[00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:28.080]   and you can see we've got scenarios.
[00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:30.040]   This is for Frankie and Joanna Miller.
[00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:34.060]   Scenarios we run on our side and here's the way it works.
[00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:36.960]   And we'll do, I'll do planning with clients
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:38.360]   right on the spot with them.
[00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:43.060]   We don't really have a canned presentation.
[00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:45.380]   We're just kind of going over it with them.
[00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:50.380]   Anyways, in this case, for this couple,
[00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:53.500]   what we did is we ran three alternative scenarios.
[00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:56.380]   What if they delayed retirement and social security?
[00:31:56.380 --> 00:31:59.420]   What if they retired at 65 to do some part-time consulting?
[00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:01.500]   And then Roth conversions.
[00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:03.940]   Those would be relatively standard type scenarios.
[00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:08.860]   It's pretty good examples here for the sample client.
[00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:11.500]   But what we do is we go into this screen,
[00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:14.280]   we open one of these up, we go into them
[00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:16.700]   and it keeps all the base facts the same.
[00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:18.420]   And then we'll just start to change them.
[00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:20.300]   And so I'll manipulate these things
[00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:22.540]   right with our clients.
[00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:24.060]   And then we'll go, we'll look at the output
[00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:26.340]   and we'll do side-by-side comparisons
[00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:28.860]   between not delaying retirement,
[00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:30.380]   social security and then delaying.
[00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:32.460]   These are dropdowns that you can do
[00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:34.780]   to do side-by-side comparisons.
[00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:39.800]   Now we've jumped into the reporting area.
[00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:45.560]   So we saw earlier how some of the reports view on your side.
[00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:49.160]   And so, yeah, there's a lot of reports here.
[00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:50.360]   We don't go through all of them.
[00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:53.400]   The ones that we use, the cashflow report,
[00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:56.720]   which is at the top there, that's a very popular one.
[00:32:56.720 --> 00:33:00.800]   And you can see this report here is showing
[00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:05.640]   that that graph there on the right
[00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:10.640]   is displaying how your money would unfold over time.
[00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:15.580]   In this case, if the client's goal was to live to 90
[00:33:15.580 --> 00:33:17.380]   and then almost run out of money and died,
[00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:18.440]   then they're pretty successful
[00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:20.840]   because that's what's gonna happen in their plan.
[00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:26.560]   So now what you can't see is all the data right below this.
[00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:27.860]   Oh, there it is.
[00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:31.600]   So these are all the data points that go into that graph.
[00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:33.040]   And so I'll walk people through this
[00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:35.820]   so they understand the numbers of that graph.
[00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:37.580]   And we will provide context
[00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:40.100]   and interpretation on these numbers.
[00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:45.020]   What risks they have, what's the likelihood of success.
[00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:46.060]   On the right-hand side,
[00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:48.260]   you can see their total portfolio assets.
[00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:52.900]   That's the chart above, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8.
[00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:55.500]   Yep, it's growing until retirement.
[00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:56.660]   And then once they retire,
[00:33:56.660 --> 00:33:59.300]   now they're spending in their assets.
[00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:01.380]   Now, we use rates of return in this
[00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:03.760]   of 5% pre-retirement and 3% post,
[00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:05.220]   which most people would agree
[00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:06.740]   are pretty conservative numbers,
[00:34:06.740 --> 00:34:08.900]   but people can use whatever numbers they want
[00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:10.380]   if they want us to update them.
[00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:13.180]   Anyways, we have their income on the left-hand side,
[00:34:13.180 --> 00:34:14.500]   that thing called income flows.
[00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:16.400]   That's their income from their work.
[00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:18.780]   Then they stop working and there's a gap in time.
[00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:21.420]   And those might be good years to do Roth conversions.
[00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:26.700]   The plan distributions is the third column.
[00:34:26.700 --> 00:34:30.460]   For most people, those are just going to be the RMDs,
[00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:32.460]   required minimum distributions.
[00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:34.300]   For some people that have an inherited IRA,
[00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:35.220]   they may pop up there,
[00:34:35.220 --> 00:34:37.460]   or if they have like a deferred comp plan
[00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:39.660]   that they're going to get distributions from.
[00:34:39.660 --> 00:34:42.580]   Now, the total expenses column,
[00:34:42.580 --> 00:34:44.380]   which is three columns to the right,
[00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:46.580]   the number that matters there
[00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:48.360]   is the number below the blue line.
[00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:49.920]   That's the amount of money you think
[00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:51.660]   you're going to spend as a retiree.
[00:34:51.660 --> 00:34:53.940]   That is your targeted expense.
[00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:56.340]   And you can see how it's changing over time.
[00:34:56.340 --> 00:35:00.520]   So we talk through these factoids with our clients.
[00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:02.900]   And each one of those columns is a hyperlink
[00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:04.820]   you can open up and we might provide
[00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:06.760]   more explanation on that.
[00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:09.460]   So the cashflow report is the most valuable report
[00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:12.500]   that we'll use to answer the broader question
[00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:15.220]   of whether or not I'm going to run out of money.
[00:35:15.220 --> 00:35:16.860]   Go on to the next screen, please.
[00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:22.180]   This is also a useful report, total assets.
[00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:27.600]   And the total portfolio assets
[00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:29.840]   is what somebody may live off of.
[00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:35.180]   And you can see that actually down there, Jason,
[00:35:35.180 --> 00:35:38.320]   you'll see if you go down a little bit to the right.
[00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:40.880]   Yeah, that's, oh, a little bit back to your left.
[00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:44.180]   There you go, right, now the black one, yeah, right there.
[00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:47.400]   That's the same number in the cashflow report
[00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:49.940]   that we're using to show how they spent down their money.
[00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:51.840]   But in this case, the client's got
[00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:54.700]   another 1.2 million probably in properties.
[00:35:54.700 --> 00:35:57.860]   And so that's what's reflected in this chart here.
[00:35:57.860 --> 00:36:00.560]   So, and we'll talk with folks about, you know,
[00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:03.500]   you have a house and maybe you're going to sell that
[00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:06.980]   and downsize, that's $600,000 worth of equity you may get
[00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:09.100]   that will boost your retirement later in life
[00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:11.820]   if they're more squeezed, if they're more challenged.
[00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:12.660]   Next screen.
[00:36:12.660 --> 00:36:16.860]   You know what, Jason, I'm gonna have you go back if you can.
[00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:22.100]   Yeah, I don't know that we produced this report.
[00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:24.820]   Maybe it'll show up later and I apologize if we did.
[00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:27.460]   But up near the top, above the word assets,
[00:36:27.460 --> 00:36:30.480]   the big blue word, there's tax type.
[00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:32.760]   That's an awesome report that I like
[00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:36.800]   because it breaks out your assets by how they are taxed.
[00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:39.100]   And I will use that to make recommendations
[00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:41.940]   on how we think our clients should allocate their assets.
[00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:45.080]   So if you can move on.
[00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:48.380]   Okay, so here's an income tax report.
[00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:53.360]   You can see the total income tax,
[00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:54.960]   the effective income tax rate.
[00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:58.300]   What should stand out with this plan though,
[00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:01.460]   is that this graph here is the amount
[00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:03.200]   that the client's gonna have to pay in taxes.
[00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:05.720]   Man, they've got a huge period of time here
[00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:08.800]   where they're not gonna be paying anything in taxes.
[00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:12.340]   Potentially great opportunity to do Roth conversions
[00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:16.180]   or maybe harvest some gains or something like that.
[00:37:16.180 --> 00:37:19.920]   And in this case, even though I don't think
[00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:23.000]   we have it in here, in this sample client,
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.640]   back in the planning area,
[00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:28.500]   they had already run alternative scenarios for this client
[00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:30.700]   where they had done some Roth conversions.
[00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:35.020]   So they probably did it right for that gap in time.
[00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:37.880]   And they can see, oh, what if I convert 20,000
[00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:39.680]   or 50,000 or 70 or 80?
[00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:42.540]   You know, that's modeling that we do with our clients.
[00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:43.800]   So onto the next screen.
[00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:48.340]   Income tax.
[00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:55.020]   - Right, so this is just merely showing the breakdown
[00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:57.520]   from the previous slide of the income.
[00:37:57.520 --> 00:37:59.360]   I added this one.
[00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:02.500]   So what we're looking at gross total income here,
[00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:06.360]   when we hyperlink, you can click on a blue font
[00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:10.620]   and that will bring us to the underlying report,
[00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:12.280]   which is the income.
[00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:16.800]   And the income is made up of earned income,
[00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:20.640]   later on taxable social security, investment income,
[00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:25.700]   which means income tax is ordinary income,
[00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:28.560]   not necessarily pure investment income.
[00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:32.600]   Dividends, capital gains, et cetera, non-taxable income,
[00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:34.960]   any non-taxable insurance benefits.
[00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:36.640]   And then the gross total income
[00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:41.080]   will tie to the previous report, of course.
[00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:43.600]   So that just shows the detail,
[00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:47.420]   what makes up the gross income from the income tax report.
[00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:52.480]   This next report, and I'm gonna jump in,
[00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:57.760]   this is one of my favorite reports with any money.
[00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:00.440]   Where it comes from, I'm gonna go back to,
[00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:07.160]   so this column here is called regular federal income tax,
[00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:09.520]   which looks pretty nondescript,
[00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:11.920]   but by drilling down into it,
[00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:15.440]   we are presented with this report.
[00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:19.620]   This report, most of you would recognize,
[00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:24.120]   is effectively page one and two of your federal 1040.
[00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:27.480]   We've got our income, above the line deductions, AGI.
[00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:33.760]   A cool thing about e-money is that the U.S. tax code
[00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:38.760]   is directly built in, and it comprises effectively
[00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:41.520]   the entire internal revenue code.
[00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:44.760]   The exemption column does show
[00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:48.720]   sunset of the current tax law, which is current law,
[00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:50.680]   and the exemptions come back,
[00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:55.380]   and the below-line deduction is made up generally
[00:39:55.380 --> 00:40:00.040]   of the standard deduction and/or the itemized deductions,
[00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:01.160]   if they're applicable.
[00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:03.760]   Taxable income, of course.
[00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:07.560]   And then another important column here
[00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:09.920]   is called income tax base.
[00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:13.760]   Income tax base is the amount of income tax
[00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:16.040]   as ordinary income,
[00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:18.540]   with subject to ordinary income tax rates,
[00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:22.680]   because, of course, we have capital gains tax
[00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:24.520]   and income tax base.
[00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:27.880]   So, again, my favorite report,
[00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:32.680]   because it does show pages one and two of your 1040,
[00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:37.040]   e-money also has the AMT calculations,
[00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:41.920]   and will compute AMT if you're subject to the credit,
[00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:42.960]   subject to the tax,
[00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:45.560]   and allow you to carry the credit forward.
[00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:47.600]   And it does model correctly.
[00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:52.600]   So this is huge benefit of e-money
[00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:56.620]   is that the internal revenue code is built in.
[00:40:56.620 --> 00:41:00.440]   - Yeah. - Okay.
[00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:05.880]   - One thing I'll mention for those that are optimistic
[00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:10.880]   that the tax rates will stay in place when they sunset,
[00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:14.680]   that is a switch you can flip.
[00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:16.440]   We don't get many requests for that.
[00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:20.120]   It's there if you wanna go down the path.
[00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:23.240]   What's the next screen, Jason?
[00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:26.180]   You just, yeah, this is what you should talk about.
[00:41:26.180 --> 00:41:28.880]   - All right, so where we're at here,
[00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:31.520]   this is in the advanced facts section.
[00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:36.520]   And in the investment area, there are taxable accounts.
[00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:40.740]   We're able to go in on the advisor's side
[00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:42.960]   and adjust the realization.
[00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:47.960]   What the realization means is how the growth is taxed
[00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:50.840]   and treated income-wise during the year.
[00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:53.680]   So for this particular account,
[00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:57.520]   it's showing that there's about a $16,000,
[00:41:57.520 --> 00:42:00.100]   $16,000 worth of growth this year.
[00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:03.640]   We can actually model and sometimes, you know,
[00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:07.680]   have it get close to a client's 1099
[00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:11.360]   because someone may have a lot of qualified dividends.
[00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:14.060]   There may be some ordinary income tax.
[00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:17.220]   Capital gains means it's growing without being taxed.
[00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:19.160]   There could be non-taxable income.
[00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:24.160]   And the turnover estimate will generate taxes
[00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:27.860]   based on how often the account is turned over
[00:42:27.860 --> 00:42:30.000]   and how much activity there is.
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.380]   So this is, can be adjusted,
[00:42:32.380 --> 00:42:37.560]   and that will reflect better or more accurate,
[00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:41.260]   realistic numbers according to income being taxed,
[00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:45.540]   which will float through to our income tax reports.
[00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:49.840]   The income distribution says how much money
[00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:54.080]   am I taking out of that account pre-retirement or post?
[00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:56.320]   - All right.
[00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:58.720]   There were some questions that popped up.
[00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:01.720]   I think I'm gonna, maybe we can deal with those at the end.
[00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:04.240]   So can you go on to the next?
[00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:05.960]   - Okay, oh, well, here's that report
[00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:07.840]   that I jumped the gun on.
[00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:11.840]   This is the asset tax type.
[00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:13.520]   And I guess I was thinking to myself,
[00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:16.360]   man, I would have told Jason to do that one for sure.
[00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:21.000]   I really like this one a lot because it again displays
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:25.560]   how e-money thinks you will spend your assets in retirement.
[00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:28.640]   By the way, I don't think we have this one in here.
[00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:31.580]   There is what's called a liquidation strategy in e-money
[00:43:31.580 --> 00:43:34.140]   where we can exclude certain assets from distribution
[00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:35.060]   if you want to do that.
[00:43:35.060 --> 00:43:36.060]   I have a couple of clients
[00:43:36.060 --> 00:43:38.040]   that kind of want to do their own thing there.
[00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:40.960]   But anyways, it's showing you, if you look at, for example,
[00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:43.800]   this client here, their taxable assets,
[00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:45.800]   their cash and their brokerage account,
[00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:47.840]   e-money has them spending their money
[00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:50.640]   down very quickly in retirement.
[00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:53.120]   And then it will go over to the tax deferred assets
[00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:55.680]   then likely to the tax-free assets.
[00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:58.360]   So nice breakout here for somebody
[00:43:58.360 --> 00:44:00.040]   to see how their assets are structured.
[00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:01.760]   They may be kind of curious to see
[00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:04.340]   how all of this thing will unfold later in life
[00:44:04.340 --> 00:44:05.700]   based upon the assumptions.
[00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:07.740]   Next screen.
[00:44:07.740 --> 00:44:10.260]   Asset allocation.
[00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:15.580]   Well, this one is kind of interesting even though,
[00:44:15.580 --> 00:44:19.380]   yeah, these are actually...
[00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:22.420]   These are, it's doing a comparison
[00:44:22.420 --> 00:44:24.500]   of the exact same portfolios,
[00:44:24.500 --> 00:44:27.420]   but it is a breakout of your portfolio
[00:44:27.420 --> 00:44:30.180]   if you're interested in that kind of thing.
[00:44:30.180 --> 00:44:32.800]   By asset class, assuming that we've got
[00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:34.600]   all your accounts labeled correctly.
[00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:40.080]   I'll come back to that question in a minute.
[00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:43.860]   Now, e-money does do a Monte Carlo simulation.
[00:44:43.860 --> 00:44:46.440]   So if you want to run that, that's done on our side.
[00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:49.060]   We can just go there and quickly run the numbers.
[00:44:49.060 --> 00:44:50.520]   So it'll give you an idea.
[00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:53.240]   If you're into Monte Carlo, we can do that.
[00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:54.960]   Yeah, here's the advanced planning one
[00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:56.160]   where I mentioned earlier,
[00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:59.480]   where we go in and we'll run these alternative scenarios.
[00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:01.960]   We go in here and we'll just start to edit
[00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:05.680]   all the various different factors in your plan.
[00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:06.520]   You'll see on the right,
[00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:10.160]   the planning techniques are at a new expense
[00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:12.480]   or make a change to your retirement assumptions
[00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:13.720]   or remove certain things.
[00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:16.400]   We can do that very quickly with our clients.
[00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:19.320]   And that's how we can do, make run comparisons for them.
[00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:24.460]   Jason, did you want to comment on this one?
[00:45:24.460 --> 00:45:27.720]   - Yeah, so in the previous slide,
[00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:31.800]   Mark is showing under the plan,
[00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:36.680]   we can change how we claim social security benefits.
[00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:41.060]   So this is within that plan, e-money,
[00:45:41.060 --> 00:45:46.440]   if we show full retirement age, e-money will compute,
[00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:50.500]   based on what we put in for your benefits
[00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:51.760]   at full retirement age.
[00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:56.760]   We can run modeling to claim it at earlier ages
[00:45:57.640 --> 00:45:59.620]   or latest ages.
[00:45:59.620 --> 00:46:03.560]   And that's what we have on the pull down here.
[00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:05.680]   Note too, you can't see it too well,
[00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:09.440]   but the spouse, e-money will correctly compute
[00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:13.540]   the spousal benefit for benefits,
[00:46:13.540 --> 00:46:15.560]   both when they're both alive,
[00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:17.680]   if there are additional spousal benefits
[00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:20.760]   and then a survivor benefit, if applicable,
[00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:23.540]   e-money correctly includes all of that.
[00:46:23.540 --> 00:46:28.060]   So it's a pretty good modeling technique by e-money.
[00:46:28.060 --> 00:46:29.940]   - Yeah, and you can exclude spousal benefits too,
[00:46:29.940 --> 00:46:30.780]   if you need to.
[00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:35.140]   Oh, here we go.
[00:46:35.140 --> 00:46:37.220]   So this is a side-by-side.
[00:46:37.220 --> 00:46:39.460]   We run these frequently with our clients.
[00:46:39.460 --> 00:46:41.380]   And if you look at the top of the screen,
[00:46:41.380 --> 00:46:44.700]   it will have, it'll show you a little bit above that,
[00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:47.120]   where it says, oh, well, there you see base facts
[00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:48.560]   versus delay retirement.
[00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:52.940]   So it's doing a side-by-side and it's showing in this case
[00:46:52.940 --> 00:46:56.220]   that the client is financially healthy
[00:46:56.220 --> 00:46:59.180]   if they delay retirement and their social security,
[00:46:59.180 --> 00:47:01.220]   their plan is healthier in the long run,
[00:47:01.220 --> 00:47:03.640]   based upon all the assumptions in the plan.
[00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:07.700]   Now, the crummy part about that is they gotta work longer.
[00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:09.580]   So that's their trade-off though,
[00:47:09.580 --> 00:47:11.620]   but that's how you can show them the implications
[00:47:11.620 --> 00:47:13.100]   to the plan.
[00:47:13.100 --> 00:47:15.260]   And in this case, it's quite a big difference
[00:47:15.260 --> 00:47:18.060]   if they wanna have a lot more money
[00:47:18.060 --> 00:47:19.780]   to continue working longer,
[00:47:19.780 --> 00:47:22.900]   at least if they believe in the assumptions of the plan.
[00:47:22.900 --> 00:47:25.500]   So, and this is back to the screen
[00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:29.660]   where we developed those alternative scenarios
[00:47:29.660 --> 00:47:32.020]   to do comparisons, so.
[00:47:32.020 --> 00:47:35.740]   - So if I can jump in, I added,
[00:47:35.740 --> 00:47:39.180]   this is looking at the Roth conversions.
[00:47:39.180 --> 00:47:41.280]   I'm gonna go back here to the previous.
[00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:45.440]   So in this particular one,
[00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:49.220]   as Mark mentioned earlier,
[00:47:49.220 --> 00:47:54.220]   we don't have canned models where we just dump and run.
[00:47:54.220 --> 00:47:57.380]   It's tailored to the clients, of course.
[00:47:57.380 --> 00:48:01.860]   And in here, this is a Roth conversion
[00:48:01.860 --> 00:48:04.460]   where within eMoney, and what I'm doing
[00:48:04.460 --> 00:48:08.500]   is showing how eMoney operates on the advisor's side.
[00:48:08.500 --> 00:48:11.540]   In the Roth conversion, we're going to,
[00:48:11.540 --> 00:48:16.180]   in this plan, convert some of Frank's 401(k)
[00:48:16.180 --> 00:48:19.340]   and by then it'll be in an IRA when he's retired.
[00:48:19.340 --> 00:48:22.460]   And what we would do is actually change the destination
[00:48:22.460 --> 00:48:26.560]   to a Roth IRA account to show conversions.
[00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:29.980]   So the next tab would be the schedule here.
[00:48:29.980 --> 00:48:34.980]   And this is where either by trial and error
[00:48:34.980 --> 00:48:40.940]   or using numbers or percentages,
[00:48:40.940 --> 00:48:43.480]   we put in the amount that's being converted each year.
[00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:47.100]   And it is based on the tax bracket
[00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:48.540]   that the client might be in
[00:48:48.540 --> 00:48:52.340]   if they wanna max out up to the top of the 12% bracket,
[00:48:52.340 --> 00:48:57.340]   later the 15, the 25%, the 28% tax bracket.
[00:48:57.340 --> 00:49:01.940]   And these all feed into the plan
[00:49:01.940 --> 00:49:06.620]   in order to show where the total assets end up.
[00:49:06.620 --> 00:49:11.620]   And it may be beneficial to convert, it may be not.
[00:49:12.260 --> 00:49:14.200]   It depends on everything else going on
[00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:16.740]   in the taxpayer's life.
[00:49:16.740 --> 00:49:22.920]   This is just another comparison going back to the,
[00:49:22.920 --> 00:49:24.700]   this is delayed retirement,
[00:49:24.700 --> 00:49:29.000]   but we could also put in the comparing Roth conversions
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:30.180]   to the base facts.
[00:49:30.180 --> 00:49:33.060]   - Yeah, we can really confuse you.
[00:49:33.060 --> 00:49:38.180]   Next screen, Jason.
[00:49:40.980 --> 00:49:44.000]   Oh, maybe we're just wrapping up here, aren't we?
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:44.840]   - Yes.
[00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:46.860]   - That looks like the end to me.
[00:49:46.860 --> 00:49:48.640]   I don't know, unless there's something else.
[00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:50.140]   But there were some really good questions
[00:49:50.140 --> 00:49:51.460]   that were popping up here.
[00:49:51.460 --> 00:49:55.480]   And let's go to the questions now, Jason.
[00:49:55.480 --> 00:49:57.780]   But I do want, can you go back to the screen?
[00:49:57.780 --> 00:50:02.280]   - Which one do you wanna?
[00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:03.940]   - Let's leave it right there.
[00:50:03.940 --> 00:50:05.600]   And let's go to the questions.
[00:50:08.740 --> 00:50:12.000]   - Do you want, you and I wanna alternate asking them?
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:16.160]   I don't think Jim is on yet, so.
[00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:20.140]   - Okay, I see one here that was,
[00:50:20.140 --> 00:50:22.900]   can you include state income tax?
[00:50:22.900 --> 00:50:23.980]   Most definitely.
[00:50:23.980 --> 00:50:28.980]   The e-money is probably 80 to 95% accurate
[00:50:28.980 --> 00:50:31.800]   with state income tax laws.
[00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:35.620]   They don't, they can't, they don't have the ability
[00:50:35.620 --> 00:50:38.700]   to do 100% accuracy on every state,
[00:50:38.700 --> 00:50:40.740]   but I would say in the estimate,
[00:50:40.740 --> 00:50:44.860]   80 to 95% of all state tax laws are included
[00:50:44.860 --> 00:50:47.500]   when we put the state of residence
[00:50:47.500 --> 00:50:49.300]   or the state of taxation for the person.
[00:50:49.300 --> 00:50:51.600]   - Yeah, we will indicate the state that you live in.
[00:50:51.600 --> 00:50:53.820]   And it actually recognizes, for example,
[00:50:53.820 --> 00:50:57.020]   I think in Illinois, pension benefits are not taxed.
[00:50:57.020 --> 00:50:59.340]   In New York, we just ran a case in New York
[00:50:59.340 --> 00:51:01.800]   where they understood how to handle
[00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:03.420]   the pension benefits there as well.
[00:51:03.420 --> 00:51:06.020]   So at the state level, they're pretty good.
[00:51:06.020 --> 00:51:10.140]   - There's a couple of good questions here
[00:51:10.140 --> 00:51:12.380]   that I can read off.
[00:51:12.380 --> 00:51:17.220]   Basically, can you save the comparison charge as PDFs
[00:51:17.220 --> 00:51:18.820]   during the what if scenarios?
[00:51:18.820 --> 00:51:23.300]   - Yeah, we do that frequently where we'll run the alt.
[00:51:23.300 --> 00:51:25.380]   In fact, if you look at the screen,
[00:51:25.380 --> 00:51:27.280]   that's why I wanted to have the screen up.
[00:51:27.280 --> 00:51:29.300]   You see where it says generate,
[00:51:29.300 --> 00:51:31.120]   that generate will produce a dropdown
[00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:33.380]   and I can send this right to the vault.
[00:51:33.380 --> 00:51:36.980]   And for a lot of our clients, they'll ask me,
[00:51:36.980 --> 00:51:40.580]   "Hey, Mark, can you send us a report of what we did?"
[00:51:40.580 --> 00:51:44.180]   And I will just, we do have some templates set up
[00:51:44.180 --> 00:51:46.260]   and I'll just go produce it and send it right to the vault.
[00:51:46.260 --> 00:51:47.980]   It's actually very efficient.
[00:51:47.980 --> 00:51:49.940]   But- - One thing I might,
[00:51:49.940 --> 00:51:52.060]   I'm sorry, go ahead, Mark.
[00:51:52.060 --> 00:51:53.460]   - I'm sorry, go ahead, Alan.
[00:51:53.460 --> 00:51:55.020]   - I was gonna say, one thing that can also be helpful
[00:51:55.020 --> 00:51:57.260]   because they conduct these meetings over Zoom,
[00:51:57.260 --> 00:52:00.580]   you can record your interaction with Mark and Jason
[00:52:00.580 --> 00:52:03.060]   and save the video and then watch it at your leisure
[00:52:03.060 --> 00:52:04.380]   later on as well.
[00:52:04.380 --> 00:52:07.620]   - I'm sure, yeah, that's exciting.
[00:52:07.620 --> 00:52:09.900]   You can watch it over and over again with you,
[00:52:09.900 --> 00:52:12.420]   share it with your family, put it on Netflix.
[00:52:12.420 --> 00:52:17.140]   Can you change the spending order of the assets IRA
[00:52:17.140 --> 00:52:18.620]   than taxable?
[00:52:18.620 --> 00:52:20.420]   Actually though, in truth though,
[00:52:20.420 --> 00:52:22.400]   we have recorded a lot of these for clients
[00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:24.620]   and if this is a lot of data coming at you,
[00:52:24.620 --> 00:52:26.880]   you can slow it down and watch it again.
[00:52:26.880 --> 00:52:27.720]   Can you change?
[00:52:27.720 --> 00:52:31.320]   - Yes, you can change the spending order of the assets IRA
[00:52:31.320 --> 00:52:33.120]   than taxable than Roth, yeah.
[00:52:33.120 --> 00:52:36.400]   Now, eMoney has a default, which it goes to,
[00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:39.080]   but in the liquidation area, we can exclude assets
[00:52:39.080 --> 00:52:41.160]   or we can just change the order of them.
[00:52:41.160 --> 00:52:46.160]   So, the wiki has, okay.
[00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:48.680]   Can you see- - Somebody has a question
[00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:51.320]   about what's your role working with Rick Ferry?
[00:52:51.320 --> 00:52:55.360]   - I'll get to that. - I think I asked you
[00:52:55.360 --> 00:52:58.240]   that before, he was just helped you as a consultant.
[00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:00.400]   - Yeah, we just hired Rick for now, actually for now, right?
[00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:02.100]   I may hire him again, so.
[00:53:02.100 --> 00:53:07.240]   - There is another question, it is from Mark
[00:53:07.240 --> 00:53:10.920]   and it says, for the charts that you showed
[00:53:10.920 --> 00:53:15.920]   related to income taxes and asset tax type,
[00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:18.560]   can the client pull up the same reports?
[00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:20.360]   - Yes, that one they can.
[00:53:20.360 --> 00:53:24.000]   - And can they make changes themselves
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:28.320]   to the inputs for those reports so they can model them
[00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:31.160]   or can only your team make those changes for model?
[00:53:31.160 --> 00:53:35.160]   - Those aren't reports that you would change the inputs to,
[00:53:35.160 --> 00:53:37.860]   those are just, that's just data.
[00:53:37.860 --> 00:53:42.240]   So, I suppose, well, here's where it could change.
[00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:45.480]   The asset tax type report would change
[00:53:45.480 --> 00:53:48.040]   if somebody did Roth conversions,
[00:53:48.040 --> 00:53:49.680]   like if we did Roth conversions.
[00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:52.720]   Now, on the client side, what they could do, I guess,
[00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:54.920]   is they would have to start like changing,
[00:53:54.920 --> 00:53:57.040]   oh, I think I'm gonna put more money in Roth
[00:53:57.040 --> 00:53:58.760]   in the future versus pre-tax,
[00:53:58.760 --> 00:54:01.080]   the numbers would change that way.
[00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:05.800]   That's not the kind of report that you, like you model,
[00:54:05.800 --> 00:54:08.460]   it's just, it's the result of another activity.
[00:54:08.460 --> 00:54:11.360]   So, I'm not sure if I'm explaining that accurately or not.
[00:54:11.360 --> 00:54:16.140]   - Mark, did that answer your question?
[00:54:21.440 --> 00:54:22.880]   Can you save the comparison to,
[00:54:22.880 --> 00:54:24.680]   I think we answered the yes, you can.
[00:54:24.680 --> 00:54:28.760]   Does e-money have a social security optimization?
[00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:31.240]   Well, let me talk about that one.
[00:54:31.240 --> 00:54:33.080]   It depends on what you mean by that.
[00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:38.080]   I mean, you know, if you live to be a hundred
[00:54:38.080 --> 00:54:42.640]   and you define optimization as getting the most money
[00:54:42.640 --> 00:54:47.440]   out of social security, we can run that easily enough.
[00:54:47.440 --> 00:54:52.120]   If you are less optimistic about your longevity,
[00:54:52.120 --> 00:54:54.400]   then your question is not, what's the best way
[00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:58.100]   for me to get the most, like most out of social security?
[00:54:58.100 --> 00:55:01.280]   It's, when can I best utilize social security
[00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:02.880]   to enjoy my life?
[00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:06.480]   So, optimization might mean a different thing
[00:55:06.480 --> 00:55:09.460]   to somebody else, but we do integrate
[00:55:09.460 --> 00:55:11.320]   and modify social security to see
[00:55:11.320 --> 00:55:13.440]   how it impacts people's plans.
[00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:15.480]   I have done plans, and I'm not kidding,
[00:55:15.480 --> 00:55:18.160]   where people live to be 90 or 95,
[00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:23.160]   they will have more money if they take social security at 62.
[00:55:23.160 --> 00:55:25.460]   They won't get more social security,
[00:55:25.460 --> 00:55:27.640]   but they'll have more money because they're living
[00:55:27.640 --> 00:55:31.840]   on assets between the ages of 60 and 66 or 67.
[00:55:31.840 --> 00:55:34.760]   And a couple of my clients kind of sensed that,
[00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:36.160]   oh, I think I'll be better off.
[00:55:36.160 --> 00:55:39.880]   And yeah, so you do have to integrate the assets together.
[00:55:39.880 --> 00:55:41.700]   So it depends on what optimization means,
[00:55:41.700 --> 00:55:44.240]   but social security reviews and analysis
[00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:46.640]   are a pretty common part of our function
[00:55:46.640 --> 00:55:49.200]   or our review with our clients.
[00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:51.680]   - Do you think, if I can interject, Mark,
[00:55:51.680 --> 00:55:55.000]   that Mike Piper's open social security calculator,
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:58.560]   does that sometimes differ from what E-money suggests?
[00:55:58.560 --> 00:55:59.680]   - Yeah, I think it will.
[00:55:59.680 --> 00:56:04.680]   I think, you know, I haven't actually used it,
[00:56:04.680 --> 00:56:08.600]   but I think what he's put together is a great tool
[00:56:08.600 --> 00:56:10.200]   for you to run different scenarios
[00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:11.680]   and see how much you'll get.
[00:56:11.680 --> 00:56:15.280]   But you can't overlook that we're all individuals
[00:56:15.280 --> 00:56:17.200]   and we might have different expectations
[00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:21.080]   for what we want out of social security, so.
[00:56:21.080 --> 00:56:23.160]   - Interesting.
[00:56:23.160 --> 00:56:25.200]   - Yeah, I mean, you know, you may have some people
[00:56:25.200 --> 00:56:30.280]   that decide to take social security earlier
[00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:32.040]   'cause they wanna be more aggressive with their assets.
[00:56:32.040 --> 00:56:35.300]   They just get more peace of mind by taking it early, so.
[00:56:35.300 --> 00:56:36.140]   - Yeah.
[00:56:36.140 --> 00:56:41.120]   There's another question here from Deckard.
[00:56:41.120 --> 00:56:44.440]   Does tax planning include both NIIT and IRMA?
[00:56:44.440 --> 00:56:50.000]   - It does address and compute the additional tax for NIIT.
[00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:55.000]   It does not compute how much Medicare
[00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:56.200]   you would end up paying.
[00:56:56.200 --> 00:56:59.360]   However, you know, we look at that too,
[00:56:59.360 --> 00:57:03.600]   because look, if you hit the first or the next level of IRMA
[00:57:03.600 --> 00:57:06.560]   you're paying about another 30 bucks a month for Medicare.
[00:57:07.880 --> 00:57:11.720]   So I would say that the e-money
[00:57:11.720 --> 00:57:14.540]   does include the net investment income tax.
[00:57:14.540 --> 00:57:17.700]   E-money does not really address IRMA.
[00:57:17.700 --> 00:57:22.240]   - Does client have to enter only current data
[00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:24.440]   or do we also have to, no, you don't have to put,
[00:57:24.440 --> 00:57:27.120]   you do not have to put in historical data.
[00:57:27.120 --> 00:57:29.200]   Do you consider a potential, yes.
[00:57:29.200 --> 00:57:31.360]   This is part of tax planning that Jason would do.
[00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:32.200]   I don't know if you have anything
[00:57:32.200 --> 00:57:34.080]   you wanna add on that, Jason?
[00:57:34.080 --> 00:57:39.000]   - Yeah, the thing with the premium tax credits
[00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:42.440]   is it's solely based on, or not solely,
[00:57:42.440 --> 00:57:44.420]   one major factor is your zip code.
[00:57:44.420 --> 00:57:49.560]   So between the zip code and which plan you choose,
[00:57:49.560 --> 00:57:55.960]   but we do look at the potential impact on the subsidies.
[00:57:55.960 --> 00:57:59.380]   Yes, because look, if you have higher income
[00:57:59.380 --> 00:58:01.180]   you're gonna have less of a subsidy.
[00:58:02.140 --> 00:58:05.220]   - By our last April meeting, actually, Jason did a nice job
[00:58:05.220 --> 00:58:09.060]   explaining some of those geographic differences in the ACA
[00:58:09.060 --> 00:58:12.180]   and that recording's available on the Boglehead's main site.
[00:58:12.180 --> 00:58:16.300]   - What file formats are supported for data?
[00:58:16.300 --> 00:58:19.500]   Sorry, but there is no, they don't import data.
[00:58:19.500 --> 00:58:22.420]   You either gotta link it or type it in.
[00:58:22.420 --> 00:58:25.340]   - Yeah, and you don't have to type in your holdings.
[00:58:25.340 --> 00:58:28.420]   You know, if you have, even for a Boglehead,
[00:58:28.420 --> 00:58:30.900]   if you've got 12 or 20 different holdings,
[00:58:30.900 --> 00:58:33.300]   you don't have to enter them in
[00:58:33.300 --> 00:58:37.100]   unless you wanna have accurate allocation reports.
[00:58:37.100 --> 00:58:42.100]   You can just put taxable account at Vanguard, $150,000.
[00:58:42.100 --> 00:58:45.060]   - Yeah, that's, a lot of our clients do that.
[00:58:45.060 --> 00:58:48.380]   We can do perfectly fine financial plans or reviews for it
[00:58:48.380 --> 00:58:49.340]   if we just know the totals.
[00:58:49.340 --> 00:58:51.180]   We don't need to know the composition.
[00:58:51.180 --> 00:58:54.260]   I see there's conflicts with federal.
[00:58:54.260 --> 00:58:57.420]   Does this planner help to balance that?
[00:58:57.420 --> 00:58:59.540]   Does this planner help to balance the two?
[00:58:59.540 --> 00:59:03.020]   - I think I can answer that.
[00:59:03.020 --> 00:59:08.020]   As I mentioned, eMoney does a fantastic job.
[00:59:08.020 --> 00:59:12.340]   I would venture even to say almost perfect job
[00:59:12.340 --> 00:59:14.980]   with the Federal Internal Revenue Code.
[00:59:14.980 --> 00:59:18.020]   State taxes, it does a very good job.
[00:59:18.020 --> 00:59:23.020]   So your state may or may not be 100% accurate.
[00:59:23.020 --> 00:59:27.100]   I would guess it would be pretty accurate.
[00:59:27.100 --> 00:59:30.140]   And yeah, I mean, these seem to be
[00:59:30.140 --> 00:59:33.220]   a standard differentiation.
[00:59:33.220 --> 00:59:34.580]   Capital gains penalized.
[00:59:34.580 --> 00:59:35.500]   I'm not sure what that means
[00:59:35.500 --> 00:59:38.780]   other than paying your normal state income tax.
[00:59:38.780 --> 00:59:41.100]   If IRA withdrawals are taxed lower,
[00:59:41.100 --> 00:59:44.900]   it probably, it would depend on your state
[00:59:44.900 --> 00:59:47.980]   and what the current laws are.
[00:59:47.980 --> 00:59:52.540]   - Active duty and does eMoney
[00:59:52.540 --> 00:59:54.660]   have considered a specific tax rate?
[00:59:54.660 --> 00:59:56.580]   Yeah, for income sources,
[00:59:56.580 --> 01:00:01.060]   we can label some of them as tax-free
[01:00:01.060 --> 01:00:02.540]   and the system will treat them as tax-free.
[01:00:02.540 --> 01:00:04.340]   So we have a fair amount of military clients
[01:00:04.340 --> 01:00:05.180]   that we work with.
[01:00:05.180 --> 01:00:08.300]   Oh, there's, I have discovered some-
[01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:09.620]   - Yeah, there's a long question from Mark
[01:00:09.620 --> 01:00:10.780]   about Roth conversions.
[01:00:10.780 --> 01:00:12.780]   I can read this, but he's asking,
[01:00:12.780 --> 01:00:13.860]   I've discovered that with some
[01:00:13.860 --> 01:00:15.820]   of the Roth conversion calculators,
[01:00:15.820 --> 01:00:18.780]   the amounts recommended to convert vary greatly
[01:00:18.780 --> 01:00:20.620]   depending upon whether the system wants
[01:00:20.620 --> 01:00:24.020]   to maximize yearly spending dollars available
[01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:27.180]   or amount of money left in your estate, for example.
[01:00:27.180 --> 01:00:29.180]   For your Roth conversions modeling,
[01:00:29.180 --> 01:00:31.140]   are you just looking at income tax levels
[01:00:31.140 --> 01:00:33.580]   or additional factors as well
[01:00:33.580 --> 01:00:36.900]   when coming up with Roth conversion recommendations?
[01:00:36.900 --> 01:00:39.460]   - So I'll start with the response
[01:00:39.460 --> 01:00:41.420]   and I'm sure Mark can add to it.
[01:00:41.420 --> 01:00:44.300]   But eMoney, I don't think necessarily
[01:00:44.300 --> 01:00:47.060]   is doing optimal comparisons.
[01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:51.700]   eMoney is providing the results from inputs put in.
[01:00:51.700 --> 01:00:54.620]   So by virtue of my goals,
[01:00:54.620 --> 01:00:57.860]   do I wanna leave a lot of money for heirs
[01:00:57.860 --> 01:01:01.780]   or do I want to spend it down?
[01:01:01.780 --> 01:01:03.980]   It just depends on what the individual's goals are,
[01:01:03.980 --> 01:01:06.860]   but there's not an optimization button
[01:01:06.860 --> 01:01:11.860]   that we hit to generate the answer.
[01:01:11.860 --> 01:01:15.540]   - Yeah, that's a common sentiment
[01:01:15.540 --> 01:01:18.300]   that I get across, not just Roth conversions,
[01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:21.500]   but, oh, isn't there like the optimal way to do this?
[01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:25.060]   Well, it depends on kind of what your attitude is.
[01:01:25.060 --> 01:01:26.900]   Gosh, I think Jason, you and I were working
[01:01:26.900 --> 01:01:29.100]   with one of our clients where, man,
[01:01:29.100 --> 01:01:31.580]   he was thinking about converting a lot to a Roth.
[01:01:31.580 --> 01:01:34.100]   I was kind of surprised at how much he was gonna do.
[01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:35.540]   And I think he, I don't know if he ended up doing it,
[01:01:35.540 --> 01:01:37.260]   but I think kind of backed off when it came time
[01:01:37.260 --> 01:01:39.260]   to actually write the check to do that conversion.
[01:01:39.260 --> 01:01:44.260]   Now, in the long run, if he lives a long time,
[01:01:44.260 --> 01:01:47.340]   it might have been optimal for him to do that.
[01:01:48.180 --> 01:01:50.900]   But it's freaking him out right now,
[01:01:50.900 --> 01:01:53.860]   and that's not optimal for his quality of life right now.
[01:01:53.860 --> 01:01:58.340]   So the word optimal, in fact, I did a podcast
[01:01:58.340 --> 01:02:00.940]   where I wanted to disband that word from our clients.
[01:02:00.940 --> 01:02:03.220]   You can't use the word optimal anymore.
[01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:06.500]   There's just better, there are different ways
[01:02:06.500 --> 01:02:09.380]   of doing things, I guess is the way I would put it.
[01:02:09.380 --> 01:02:11.180]   But yeah, I will talk with clients
[01:02:11.180 --> 01:02:13.780]   about how they can use Roth conversions,
[01:02:13.780 --> 01:02:18.060]   the trade-offs that they have to make in those decisions,
[01:02:18.060 --> 01:02:20.900]   and how do they view their lifespan,
[01:02:20.900 --> 01:02:22.540]   and a lot of it can vary based
[01:02:22.540 --> 01:02:24.260]   upon how their assets play out.
[01:02:24.260 --> 01:02:26.660]   And then Jason will actually go into much more detail
[01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:29.980]   on the actual tax cost and how much,
[01:02:29.980 --> 01:02:34.100]   how far up the tax bracket you wanna go, so.
[01:02:34.100 --> 01:02:37.860]   - Yeah, and definitely, if people know exactly
[01:02:37.860 --> 01:02:39.660]   what their tax rate will be in the future
[01:02:39.660 --> 01:02:41.120]   and how much income they'll have,
[01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:43.820]   it's a lot easier for us to provide a recommendation.
[01:02:44.980 --> 01:02:47.340]   - Well, one thing about Roth conversions,
[01:02:47.340 --> 01:02:53.900]   my son did a Roth conversion, took his old 401(k)
[01:02:53.900 --> 01:02:57.580]   from a previous employer, rolled it into Vanguard,
[01:02:57.580 --> 01:03:00.460]   and then was converting it into a Roth.
[01:03:00.460 --> 01:03:04.500]   So he converted one third one year.
[01:03:04.500 --> 01:03:06.060]   The taxes were not a problem
[01:03:06.060 --> 01:03:08.560]   'cause he's still in a low tax bracket.
[01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:12.000]   But the next year, when we looked at his account,
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:15.040]   it was all in the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund,
[01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:18.320]   and it was a bear market, bull market, I'm sorry,
[01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:20.680]   and all he had done is make more money.
[01:03:20.680 --> 01:03:23.920]   He had simply made more pre-tax money.
[01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:25.240]   And so it was almost better.
[01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:26.480]   He said, "Why don't I just put it all over
[01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:28.580]   "in the Roth right now, and from now on,
[01:03:28.580 --> 01:03:31.720]   "it's all after, it's non-tax money."
[01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:35.640]   And which is true, but how do you know?
[01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:38.760]   He did pay higher taxes to do it.
[01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:40.920]   On the other hand, he's gonna be working another,
[01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:44.640]   what, 30 years before he retires.
[01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:47.960]   It just seems that you're looking at your instinct
[01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:50.200]   of what is the best thing to do.
[01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:54.880]   - Yeah, and generally, people that are in the beginning,
[01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:57.440]   middle stages of their career,
[01:03:57.440 --> 01:03:59.200]   if they're on an income track,
[01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:00.680]   they're going to make more in the future.
[01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:03.800]   Therefore, typically now, yeah,
[01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:05.640]   you would use Roth at the beginning
[01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:07.580]   when you think you'll be in lower tax brackets.
[01:04:07.580 --> 01:04:11.900]   Think of doctors when they're in residency
[01:04:11.900 --> 01:04:13.740]   and when they're new attendings.
[01:04:13.740 --> 01:04:15.620]   That's probably the least amount of money
[01:04:15.620 --> 01:04:17.580]   that they're going to make going forward.
[01:04:17.580 --> 01:04:20.380]   So they probably want to be Roth.
[01:04:20.380 --> 01:04:23.580]   And then when they start earning much more money,
[01:04:23.580 --> 01:04:26.740]   they focus more on the pre-tax deductions
[01:04:26.740 --> 01:04:28.380]   being in the higher tax brackets.
[01:04:28.380 --> 01:04:31.500]   - As an alternative, just to mention this,
[01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:34.060]   however, for those people,
[01:04:34.060 --> 01:04:35.980]   they may be stressed out financially.
[01:04:35.980 --> 01:04:38.260]   They have debts they have to pay.
[01:04:38.260 --> 01:04:39.860]   They don't have a lot of extra cash.
[01:04:39.860 --> 01:04:43.840]   So even at that low income tax level,
[01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:45.780]   they may, doing a Roth conversion
[01:04:45.780 --> 01:04:48.020]   may just stress them out financially.
[01:04:48.020 --> 01:04:51.480]   - So you do it little by little, little by little.
[01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:56.560]   - All right, not surprised that there's no easy button.
[01:04:56.560 --> 01:04:58.820]   (laughing)
[01:04:58.820 --> 01:05:00.900]   Yeah, it's true.
[01:05:00.900 --> 01:05:04.100]   So that's the questions.
[01:05:05.100 --> 01:05:06.020]   So.
[01:05:06.020 --> 01:05:07.740]   - We have additional questions people would like
[01:05:07.740 --> 01:05:10.140]   to either ask or submit via chat.
[01:05:10.140 --> 01:05:17.300]   One thing that could be interesting,
[01:05:17.300 --> 01:05:20.460]   do you have more presentation material, Mark or Jason?
[01:05:20.460 --> 01:05:21.900]   - I don't think so.
[01:05:21.900 --> 01:05:23.780]   - 'Cause one thing that might be interesting,
[01:05:23.780 --> 01:05:28.360]   I imagine there are some of us that have worked with Mark,
[01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:31.260]   perhaps can offer a little bit of perspective.
[01:05:31.260 --> 01:05:33.060]   I don't know if anybody else on the,
[01:05:34.060 --> 01:05:36.340]   the Zoom call is willing to do so,
[01:05:36.340 --> 01:05:40.140]   but I was curious about plan vision
[01:05:40.140 --> 01:05:42.500]   as a do-it-yourself bogey header
[01:05:42.500 --> 01:05:46.180]   and thought I would check it as a second opinion
[01:05:46.180 --> 01:05:49.140]   kind of on what I was thinking about Roth conversions
[01:05:49.140 --> 01:05:51.060]   and retirement planning.
[01:05:51.060 --> 01:05:52.100]   And I found it very useful
[01:05:52.100 --> 01:05:53.700]   and they offered a lot of perspectives
[01:05:53.700 --> 01:05:55.860]   that I hadn't thought about.
[01:05:55.860 --> 01:05:57.300]   Most importantly, in my case,
[01:05:57.300 --> 01:05:59.460]   working mainly with Jason, ultimately,
[01:05:59.460 --> 01:06:01.260]   finding out that I was pushing myself,
[01:06:01.260 --> 01:06:05.820]   my qualified basically capital gains into a higher bracket
[01:06:05.820 --> 01:06:07.900]   because of the ratio that I have
[01:06:07.900 --> 01:06:12.420]   between my IRA and a taxable account.
[01:06:12.420 --> 01:06:14.900]   So for me, it opened up a lot of different perspectives
[01:06:14.900 --> 01:06:16.220]   that I hadn't considered
[01:06:16.220 --> 01:06:18.300]   and having just plugged stuff in on my own
[01:06:18.300 --> 01:06:20.140]   on other Roth conversion calculators,
[01:06:20.140 --> 01:06:22.180]   I missed those nuances.
[01:06:22.180 --> 01:06:23.340]   So I think there's a lot of things
[01:06:23.340 --> 01:06:25.340]   that even open social security calculator,
[01:06:25.340 --> 01:06:27.220]   Mike Piper's excellent tool,
[01:06:27.220 --> 01:06:29.580]   you know, it not punches the numbers,
[01:06:29.580 --> 01:06:32.380]   but you have to basically bear in mind
[01:06:32.380 --> 01:06:34.860]   what your needs are and your perspectives.
[01:06:34.860 --> 01:06:35.860]   And those are the things
[01:06:35.860 --> 01:06:37.820]   that maybe someday artificial intelligence
[01:06:37.820 --> 01:06:40.060]   will add a dimension that's lacking now,
[01:06:40.060 --> 01:06:43.180]   but it's nice to have the human perspective,
[01:06:43.180 --> 01:06:45.100]   especially with an experienced advisor
[01:06:45.100 --> 01:06:47.340]   who's walked through a lot of these scenarios before
[01:06:47.340 --> 01:06:49.700]   and knows what to really focus on.
[01:06:49.700 --> 01:06:52.100]   - Yeah, I'll give an example.
[01:06:52.100 --> 01:06:54.700]   One is the, we showed a chart here
[01:06:54.700 --> 01:06:57.540]   called the planned distributions, the R and Ds.
[01:06:59.020 --> 01:07:01.700]   And so in the Boglehead world and in other podcasts,
[01:07:01.700 --> 01:07:03.620]   the R and Ds are like what, you know,
[01:07:03.620 --> 01:07:07.940]   it's like, you know, cross for Dracula or whatever,
[01:07:07.940 --> 01:07:09.780]   you know, so you got-
[01:07:09.780 --> 01:07:11.500]   - R and Ds.
[01:07:11.500 --> 01:07:13.620]   - Yeah, and I will show people and I'll say,
[01:07:13.620 --> 01:07:14.940]   you know, your R and Ds,
[01:07:14.940 --> 01:07:17.300]   they're basically 1% of your net worth.
[01:07:17.300 --> 01:07:19.140]   That's what, even when you're 85,
[01:07:19.140 --> 01:07:21.140]   it doesn't mean you don't wanna be prudent
[01:07:21.140 --> 01:07:23.500]   about your assets and make smart decisions,
[01:07:23.500 --> 01:07:26.620]   but man, I'll see people obsessing about R and Ds
[01:07:26.620 --> 01:07:30.020]   and it's just, oh, you know, it's not really gonna matter.
[01:07:30.020 --> 01:07:32.100]   Now, you should still do Roth conversions
[01:07:32.100 --> 01:07:34.660]   and you still wanna try to reduce them when you can,
[01:07:34.660 --> 01:07:36.900]   but it's not really gonna move the needle all that much.
[01:07:36.900 --> 01:07:39.740]   So it does provide some relief for folks.
[01:07:39.740 --> 01:07:42.460]   It's like one less thing I need to worry about.
[01:07:42.460 --> 01:07:45.860]   - Is it good for inheritance purposes?
[01:07:45.860 --> 01:07:49.900]   - You mean-
[01:07:49.900 --> 01:07:53.660]   - The moving into the Roths, not as good as it used to be,
[01:07:53.660 --> 01:07:55.020]   but-
[01:07:55.020 --> 01:07:56.700]   - It could be, I guess.
[01:07:56.700 --> 01:07:58.780]   Yes.
[01:07:58.780 --> 01:08:00.100]   If you're asking if it's an asset
[01:08:00.100 --> 01:08:02.740]   that passes along tax-free, yes.
[01:08:02.740 --> 01:08:07.740]   - Yeah, it has advantages for the legacy part of your life.
[01:08:07.740 --> 01:08:10.820]   - Yeah, it ties into estate planning,
[01:08:10.820 --> 01:08:12.620]   so that's one of the factors.
[01:08:12.620 --> 01:08:15.420]   'Cause you got 10 years where it can just sit there
[01:08:15.420 --> 01:08:17.260]   without having, it has to still be taken out,
[01:08:17.260 --> 01:08:18.300]   but there's no taxes,
[01:08:18.300 --> 01:08:20.940]   but you can let it sit for 9.9 years
[01:08:20.940 --> 01:08:24.500]   and then it's taken out by the individual inheriting it
[01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:25.340]   at that point.
[01:08:25.340 --> 01:08:29.660]   - There's a question here about investment advice
[01:08:29.660 --> 01:08:31.860]   and then a follow-up question, which is tied in.
[01:08:31.860 --> 01:08:34.660]   You indicated you don't need the holdings for a plan.
[01:08:34.660 --> 01:08:37.140]   But given holdings, I guess everyone can read that.
[01:08:37.140 --> 01:08:41.380]   But yes, we do give investment advice for our clients.
[01:08:41.380 --> 01:08:43.660]   Again, we focus very simple, low cost,
[01:08:43.660 --> 01:08:45.340]   broadly diversified portfolios.
[01:08:45.340 --> 01:08:47.740]   And we just tell them what we think they should do.
[01:08:47.740 --> 01:08:51.040]   It is many times driven by the numbers and what we see.
[01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:53.660]   Do they have the liberty to be aggressive
[01:08:53.660 --> 01:08:55.060]   or conservative in their plan?
[01:08:55.060 --> 01:08:57.140]   So we'll definitely provide comments
[01:08:57.140 --> 01:08:58.340]   on their investment advice
[01:08:58.340 --> 01:09:00.420]   and what we think that they should do
[01:09:00.420 --> 01:09:03.500]   to either simplify their plan or reduce their risk.
[01:09:03.500 --> 01:09:06.660]   Going over the numbers is very helpful in that process.
[01:09:06.660 --> 01:09:08.460]   The second question is,
[01:09:08.460 --> 01:09:11.020]   we don't need the holdings for a plan.
[01:09:11.020 --> 01:09:14.900]   Well, if people want us to review their mix
[01:09:14.900 --> 01:09:16.260]   and make recommendations
[01:09:16.260 --> 01:09:18.420]   and they don't link their accounts,
[01:09:18.420 --> 01:09:20.140]   a lot of times what they'll do is they'll upload
[01:09:20.140 --> 01:09:21.260]   their statements to the vault
[01:09:21.260 --> 01:09:23.020]   and we'll just look at it that way.
[01:09:23.020 --> 01:09:24.580]   But yeah, it is helpful in some,
[01:09:24.580 --> 01:09:25.660]   depending on what our clients want.
[01:09:25.660 --> 01:09:27.500]   Some people, and I will ask our clients,
[01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:29.200]   hey, do you need help with your investment advice?
[01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:30.040]   Are you okay with that?
[01:09:30.040 --> 01:09:31.220]   And they'll say, yeah, we do want some thoughts.
[01:09:31.220 --> 01:09:33.460]   Or say, no, we're pretty cool with what we've got there.
[01:09:33.460 --> 01:09:35.060]   So it depends on what they want.
[01:09:35.060 --> 01:09:41.140]   - Sandy K.
[01:09:41.140 --> 01:09:42.640]   - I'm curious, Mark.
[01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:44.580]   I'll go ahead, Miriam.
[01:09:44.580 --> 01:09:48.500]   - There's a question from Sandy K on the chat.
[01:09:48.500 --> 01:09:52.020]   What are your thoughts on the bond tent strategy?
[01:09:52.020 --> 01:09:53.260]   - Somebody's gonna have to-
[01:09:53.260 --> 01:09:54.780]   - Nearing retirement.
[01:09:54.780 --> 01:09:57.100]   - Someone would have to explain to me what the bond tent.
[01:09:57.100 --> 01:09:59.260]   - Bond tent is when you,
[01:09:59.260 --> 01:10:02.580]   before, my understanding is the bond tent
[01:10:02.580 --> 01:10:03.980]   is when you start to enter,
[01:10:03.980 --> 01:10:07.020]   you're getting into the glide path to retirement.
[01:10:07.020 --> 01:10:11.380]   You put your, the assets that you cannot lose,
[01:10:11.380 --> 01:10:15.380]   that you will need for your living expenses
[01:10:15.380 --> 01:10:17.420]   for the next X number of years.
[01:10:17.420 --> 01:10:20.480]   Let's say five years, three years before retirement,
[01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:23.100]   maybe four years, three years after.
[01:10:23.100 --> 01:10:27.740]   You put those assets, you set them aside in a tent
[01:10:27.740 --> 01:10:28.580]   that covers you.
[01:10:28.580 --> 01:10:30.420]   And the tent is of bonds.
[01:10:30.420 --> 01:10:32.980]   And you can arrange it into short-term,
[01:10:32.980 --> 01:10:37.740]   intermediate-term bonds, or you can just put a bond fund.
[01:10:37.740 --> 01:10:40.900]   You set it into there and then you take your other assets
[01:10:40.900 --> 01:10:44.620]   and you move them somewhere else and make it more,
[01:10:44.620 --> 01:10:48.380]   shall we say, stock-heavy, more aggressive.
[01:10:48.380 --> 01:10:50.740]   So you have like two different portfolios.
[01:10:50.740 --> 01:10:52.640]   - Yes.
[01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:54.780]   What are my thoughts on that?
[01:10:54.780 --> 01:10:56.580]   If we're simply talking about the idea
[01:10:56.580 --> 01:10:58.420]   that you take a portion of your portfolio
[01:10:58.420 --> 01:10:59.740]   and get more conservative with it
[01:10:59.740 --> 01:11:01.060]   as you're gonna live, absolutely.
[01:11:01.060 --> 01:11:03.300]   I mean, so my thoughts on that is
[01:11:03.300 --> 01:11:05.120]   I think that's very wise to do.
[01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:08.740]   In fact, my general comment would be,
[01:11:08.740 --> 01:11:10.540]   without going into specific details
[01:11:10.540 --> 01:11:13.060]   on actual bond-like structure,
[01:11:13.060 --> 01:11:14.640]   is that I would encourage people
[01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:16.940]   that have been financially successful,
[01:11:16.940 --> 01:11:18.740]   as they're transitioning, to default
[01:11:18.740 --> 01:11:21.380]   to being more cautious and being more aggressive,
[01:11:21.380 --> 01:11:24.060]   which would mean having more cash, having more bonds.
[01:11:24.060 --> 01:11:26.940]   Like, I think that's a better place to arrive at.
[01:11:26.940 --> 01:11:30.340]   - And the bond- - Go ahead, I'm sorry, Jason.
[01:11:30.340 --> 01:11:33.940]   - The bond tent strategy is really a variation
[01:11:33.940 --> 01:11:37.220]   of looking, in my opinion, at your asset allocation.
[01:11:37.220 --> 01:11:39.240]   I mean, that's what it is.
[01:11:39.240 --> 01:11:44.240]   And based on where your investments are,
[01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:46.460]   you look at your asset allocation
[01:11:46.460 --> 01:11:51.300]   and if you use a bond tent strategy,
[01:11:51.300 --> 01:11:54.820]   by definition, you're looking at your asset allocation
[01:11:54.820 --> 01:11:57.580]   and adjusting it to meet your situation.
[01:11:57.580 --> 01:12:01.100]   One thing to note, the proper asset allocation,
[01:12:01.100 --> 01:12:04.340]   in my opinion, is that people maintain it
[01:12:04.340 --> 01:12:07.740]   when the market goes up, down, sideways, whatever,
[01:12:07.740 --> 01:12:10.260]   because if you change your asset allocation
[01:12:10.260 --> 01:12:12.140]   based on market performance,
[01:12:12.140 --> 01:12:16.340]   then you don't have a true asset allocation
[01:12:16.340 --> 01:12:19.060]   because you would have started at that asset allocation
[01:12:19.060 --> 01:12:21.060]   before the big run or the big drop.
[01:12:21.060 --> 01:12:24.620]   - There's a question here
[01:12:24.620 --> 01:12:26.820]   about the investment policy statement.
[01:12:26.820 --> 01:12:30.820]   Do you review that as part of the plan?
[01:12:30.820 --> 01:12:34.880]   Yeah, we'll take a look at your IPS, if you want us to.
[01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:37.860]   I mean, if it's 15 pages.
[01:12:37.860 --> 01:12:40.260]   I don't know that I'm that interested in reading it.
[01:12:40.260 --> 01:12:41.420]   But yes, we have a lot of clients
[01:12:41.420 --> 01:12:43.400]   that have an excellent, nice little summary
[01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:45.480]   of what they're doing, and yeah.
[01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:51.480]   You know, we don't feel that strongly about
[01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:59.440]   having an intricate asset allocation model.
[01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:03.280]   So I like the three fund portfolio.
[01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:04.600]   I do everything in a target date fund,
[01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:05.920]   but we're happy to provide comments
[01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:08.400]   to help people either simplify their portfolio,
[01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:10.880]   or I think also for a lot of the bogleheads
[01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:13.240]   who kind of know a lot of this stuff anyway,
[01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:16.980]   but maybe they need reinforcement or maybe a few comments,
[01:13:16.980 --> 01:13:21.340]   is just to provide some broad comments on their mix.
[01:13:21.340 --> 01:13:24.440]   So what about RMD and Roth?
[01:13:24.440 --> 01:13:26.480]   Do you look at the issue of two individuals
[01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:28.800]   who both have substantial tax?
[01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:30.280]   Some point, one of them dies.
[01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:33.080]   You still have two RMD, but your tax brackets are now.
[01:13:33.080 --> 01:13:38.200]   Yeah, Jason has talked with our clients.
[01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:39.280]   You've had that conversation
[01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:40.920]   with several of our clients, I think.
[01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:42.960]   - Right, yeah, that's a great comment
[01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:46.040]   because you make your plan, you look at everything,
[01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:50.320]   and then boom, if you have one of the spouses die early,
[01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:54.440]   your RMDs now are pushing you in a much higher tax bracket.
[01:13:54.440 --> 01:13:58.280]   And eMoney actually has what if scenarios
[01:13:58.280 --> 01:14:00.200]   with an early death.
[01:14:00.200 --> 01:14:03.920]   So it can be run on the advisor's side.
[01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:07.080]   And of course, yeah, we don't look at anything in a vacuum.
[01:14:08.480 --> 01:14:13.400]   If you could give the information that you want to model,
[01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:15.560]   but look, everything is a model
[01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:18.240]   because we don't know when one of us are going to die,
[01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:22.820]   whether that be for Roth conversions or RMDs.
[01:14:22.820 --> 01:14:31.040]   - All right.
[01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:33.200]   (silence)
[01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:42.640]   - Jason, you do not do the tax forms for people.
[01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:43.480]   Is that correct?
[01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:44.980]   You don't do their taxes.
[01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:49.720]   You just advise them or lay it out.
[01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:52.920]   - Yeah, and I want to be clear
[01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:56.040]   that I don't do tax preparation.
[01:14:56.040 --> 01:14:59.000]   We don't provide tax advice.
[01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:04.000]   Tax advice is actually a covered topic for a CPA.
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:07.400]   So we're not doing taxes.
[01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:08.960]   We provide tax consulting
[01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:12.760]   and we provide for your tax situation,
[01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:14.000]   this is where you're at.
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:19.920]   There are a lot of people that are in between tax brackets.
[01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:23.100]   So we want to provide them with the information
[01:15:23.100 --> 01:15:26.200]   to see what makes sense in their situation.
[01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:30.920]   But yeah, we definitely do not provide tax preparation.
[01:15:30.920 --> 01:15:33.560]   - Here's an interesting question.
[01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:35.800]   How difficult is it to master e-money as an advisor,
[01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:36.960]   as a do it yourself,
[01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:39.240]   or I like to get my hands on the tools directly?
[01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:42.680]   Well, there's the upfront cost,
[01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:44.760]   which you might find annoying.
[01:15:44.760 --> 01:15:47.560]   I think it's 3,500, maybe it's 2,500
[01:15:47.560 --> 01:15:49.320]   if they have a scaled down version.
[01:15:49.320 --> 01:15:53.840]   And I think you might even have to be an RIA to get it.
[01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:55.400]   I don't remember anymore.
[01:15:55.400 --> 01:15:57.040]   It was so long ago that I got it.
[01:15:57.800 --> 01:15:59.540]   It would take a while to figure it out.
[01:15:59.540 --> 01:16:01.080]   You'd be on the phone, they have good support,
[01:16:01.080 --> 01:16:03.240]   but you'd be on the phone with support quite a bit.
[01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:09.440]   So, all right.
[01:16:09.440 --> 01:16:16.240]   - Curious, Mark, if somebody has a particularly
[01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:19.560]   complex situation that would ordinarily
[01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:21.060]   take a lot more time,
[01:16:21.060 --> 01:16:23.240]   is that something they work out with you guys
[01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:24.880]   on a different price structure
[01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:27.600]   for a more detailed, deep dive?
[01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:35.000]   - You know, we have done plans
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:38.120]   for some pretty complicated situations.
[01:16:38.120 --> 01:16:39.800]   I think I can think of clients
[01:16:39.800 --> 01:16:42.000]   that had 10 or 11 businesses
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:46.680]   that had some different assets
[01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:51.080]   that were coming in over time.
[01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:53.380]   We didn't charge them anything extra for that.
[01:16:54.380 --> 01:16:59.380]   So, I haven't really come across something yet that...
[01:16:59.380 --> 01:17:04.300]   I mean, I'm sure I will probably, or we will eventually,
[01:17:04.300 --> 01:17:09.300]   but stock options can get a little bit convoluted,
[01:17:09.300 --> 01:17:12.980]   but we actually encourage our clients
[01:17:12.980 --> 01:17:17.980]   to just enter those as income sources, generally speaking,
[01:17:17.980 --> 01:17:20.300]   and they work fine.
[01:17:20.300 --> 01:17:21.380]   So, I don't know, Alan.
[01:17:21.380 --> 01:17:24.140]   I guess we'll deal with that when it happens.
[01:17:24.140 --> 01:17:25.660]   - I have an analogy here.
[01:17:25.660 --> 01:17:29.060]   Mark, correct me if I'm wrong or if you don't agree,
[01:17:29.060 --> 01:17:31.100]   but I've been thinking about this.
[01:17:31.100 --> 01:17:34.220]   If you all remember the show "MASH,"
[01:17:34.220 --> 01:17:38.100]   we have triage and then we do surgery,
[01:17:38.100 --> 01:17:40.020]   and it's not meatball surgery.
[01:17:40.020 --> 01:17:42.820]   I mean, many of the surgeons
[01:17:42.820 --> 01:17:47.140]   do great work in the MASH unit.
[01:17:47.140 --> 01:17:49.340]   So, we're not doing cosmetic surgery.
[01:17:49.340 --> 01:17:52.060]   We're not doing cosmetic plans with our clients.
[01:17:52.060 --> 01:17:56.020]   We're just getting them a good, simple plan
[01:17:56.020 --> 01:17:58.380]   that makes sense for their situation.
[01:17:58.380 --> 01:18:02.520]   - Any idea why it takes someone
[01:18:02.520 --> 01:18:04.900]   to enter manually the information?
[01:18:04.900 --> 01:18:06.460]   Do you have to enter individual holdings
[01:18:06.460 --> 01:18:08.300]   or just a total amount?
[01:18:08.300 --> 01:18:11.140]   You can enter a total amount for an account,
[01:18:11.140 --> 01:18:13.640]   or you can link them if you want to, and that's...
[01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:16.980]   There's more work than you need money.
[01:18:16.980 --> 01:18:18.340]   It's not just your account entry.
[01:18:18.340 --> 01:18:22.140]   You want to enter your future expenses into e-money
[01:18:22.140 --> 01:18:25.420]   if you have pensions, maybe you have rental income.
[01:18:25.420 --> 01:18:27.260]   So, it can take somebody, depending upon the complaint,
[01:18:27.260 --> 01:18:29.660]   a little while to enter their information.
[01:18:29.660 --> 01:18:30.500]   But as I mentioned earlier,
[01:18:30.500 --> 01:18:32.740]   a lot of our clients really like the exercise.
[01:18:32.740 --> 01:18:39.620]   - All righty.
[01:18:39.620 --> 01:18:41.020]   - Okay.
[01:18:41.020 --> 01:18:43.340]   - Any further questions or comments, folks?
[01:18:47.620 --> 01:18:51.260]   If not, I want to thank Miriam for her expert assistance
[01:18:51.260 --> 01:18:53.300]   in monitoring the chat box.
[01:18:53.300 --> 01:18:55.300]   I was trying to look at the participants
[01:18:55.300 --> 01:18:56.220]   and everything else.
[01:18:56.220 --> 01:18:57.420]   You had a comment, Miriam?
[01:18:57.420 --> 01:18:59.100]   It looks like you were about to say something.
[01:18:59.100 --> 01:19:01.940]   - Just if anybody wanted to contact Jason or Mark,
[01:19:01.940 --> 01:19:03.100]   how would they do that?
[01:19:03.100 --> 01:19:11.500]   - Well, they could go to our website, planvisionmm.com.
[01:19:14.900 --> 01:19:18.420]   They could, I guess, send us an email
[01:19:18.420 --> 01:19:21.860]   at info@planvisionmm.com.
[01:19:21.860 --> 01:19:24.440]   (upbeat music)
[01:19:24.440 --> 01:19:27.020]   (upbeat music)
[01:19:27.020 --> 01:19:29.600]   (upbeat music)
[01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:32.180]   (upbeat music)
[01:19:32.180 --> 01:19:34.760]   (upbeat music)
[01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:37.380]   (upbeat music)
[01:19:37.380 --> 01:19:39.960]   (upbeat music)
[01:19:39.960 --> 01:19:41.820]   (upbeat music)
