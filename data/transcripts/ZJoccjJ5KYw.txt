[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300]   - If I saw a satire, I would read Boris Barstynak,
[00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.440]   which is a famous Russian poet, won the Nobel Prize
[00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.520]   before every match, and he kind of captures that ethic.
[00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:10.720]   So this is the poem.
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.120]   I'll say it in Russian.
[00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.640]   - Okay. - And then in English.
[00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:14.920]   - Please. - Okay.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:20.720]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.640]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:37.920]   I know there's a bunch of Russian people
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.320]   that would appreciate that.
[00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.200]   The translation a bit crappy.
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.280]   It's very difficult to translate the Russian language,
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.360]   but it's, "The others, step by step, will follow,
[00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.420]   "the living imprint of your feet,
[00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.520]   "but you yourself must not distinguish
[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.800]   "your victory from your defeat.
[00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.940]   "And never for a single moment betray your credo or pretend,
[00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.640]   "but be alive, only this matters,
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.980]   "alive and burning to the end."
[00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.600]   So this is the end of a poem that represents
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.880]   the fact that fame, most of the poem says that
[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.000]   fame, recognition, money, none of that matters.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.520]   The winning and losing, none of that matters.
[00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.600]   What matters is the purity of the art,
[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.680]   just giving yourself completely over to the art.
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.920]   So like, others will write your story,
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.100]   others will tell whether you did good or bad,
[00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.500]   others will inspire using your story,
[00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.640]   but as the artist, so in the case of Pasternak,
[00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.920]   he's a poet, writer, wrote Dr. Zhivago,
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.080]   is the art, you should only think about the art
[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.120]   and the purity of it and the love of it.
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.020]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.600]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.180]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.760]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.340]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.920]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:07.920]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
