[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.880]   [intro music]
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:10.380]   The new year means, as is our new tradition here on the podcast, it is time to go over
[00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.320]   my reading list.
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:18.080]   So as long-time listeners know, my target is usually to read about five books per month,
[00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.160]   and we've started the habit of at the beginning of each new month reviewing the books I read
[00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.160]   during the past month.
[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:32.320]   So now it is time to talk about the five books I read in December 2021.
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.320]   Are you ready for this, Jesse?
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.320]   I'm ready.
[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.320]   Let's go.
[00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.320]   All right.
[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:45.200]   So the first book I completed in that month was How Star Wars Conquered the Universe by
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.300]   Chris Taylor.
[00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:53.960]   This is basically a George Lucas biography that has some pop culture reporting on the
[00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:54.960]   Star Wars phenomenon.
[00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.600]   Now, you might remember this, Jesse.
[00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.720]   This was controversial.
[00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.960]   We talked about this back in December when I was reading it.
[00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:09.640]   I asked the listeners, "Is it okay that I am skipping the chapters that are about the
[00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.360]   cultural reception of Star Wars?"
[00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.600]   So early on, the book started going back and forth.
[00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.120]   It would be a chapter from the timeline of George Lucas's career, so biography.
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.960]   And then it would switch to a chapter that would be about, "Here's a group of guys that
[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.880]   dress up like stormtroopers and who they are and what's that like."
[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.880]   I was not so interested in the cultural stuff.
[00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:31.880]   I wanted the biography.
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.720]   This is part of my ongoing effort to—my movie effort.
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.840]   I'm reading book after book about various people in the movie industry for some weird
[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:39.840]   reason.
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.400]   So I asked the audience if it was okay if I skipped that.
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.480]   Jesse, you gave me the thumbs up on that, I believe, if I'm remembering.
[00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:46.480]   Yeah, that was okay.
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:47.480]   That was okay.
[00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.680]   Well, so here's the thing.
[00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.280]   I have more defense for my approach because he stopped—the author, Chris Taylor, stopped
[00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.480]   doing that switching before, I don't know, two-thirds of the way into the book.
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.040]   And so it became straight biography, really, for the end of it.
[00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.680]   So in the end, I probably only skipped, I don't know, 30% of the material.
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.000]   So I'm going to count that.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   So as I mentioned, this is part of my random project to really dive into the film industry.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.720]   This is maybe the fourth or fifth book I've read in a row that is on that topic.
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.840]   I'm not sure why this is interesting so much, but it really has been this fall.
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.960]   I really wanted to learn about George Lucas, having finished the biography of Steven Spielberg
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.960]   the month before.
[00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.760]   And a few things I learned.
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.920]   One, Lucas was a really good director.
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.280]   So in this scene, there's this scene centered around USC where there was Lucas and there
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.760]   was Coppola, and Spielberg wasn't at USC, but he was in their circle.
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.720]   Scorsese was in their circle, among some others.
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.440]   Brian De Palma was in their circle.
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.800]   So it's this big group of directors, and they all knew each other.
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.400]   In that circle, Lucas was considered a hotshot.
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.760]   So he had this great animated student short that won a bunch of awards and put him on
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:09.760]   the map.
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.560]   Like, wow, Lucas is the guy that he's the auteur.
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.080]   He's the guy with the vision.
[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.360]   And then he did the student version of THX, which also blew people away.
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.160]   So I think people didn't realize that about Lucas.
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:26.040]   Coppola really was trying to get Lucas to direct Apocalypse Now.
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.120]   But Lucas decided to do Star Wars instead, basically.
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.920]   So he was considered like the artistic guy.
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.560]   So that's kind of interesting.
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.240]   The other thing I found out about Lucas is, like these other guys, timing is important.
[00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:45.140]   Him and Spielberg came up just as the movie industry was changing, just as they were leaving
[00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.640]   the studio system.
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:53.160]   So Coppola's first movie was Finnegan's Rainbow, which was a classic studio soundstage movie.
[00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.400]   Then he did The Godfather.
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.880]   So it was like right as they were transitioning away from the studio system.
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.320]   And they invented this idea of the blockbuster, where you could have a movie that appealed
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.440]   to all these different age groups and could be in 3,000 theaters and make all this money.
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.120]   And so their timing was right.
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.160]   They were talented.
[00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:19.520]   And Lucas, even more so than Spielberg, had a relentless go-big ambition.
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:23.560]   So if he was going to do a movie, just like a student movie, he was going to do THX student
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:29.560]   movie, he was going to find a way to get access to an abandoned military base and push the
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.440]   setting, push the technology.
[00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.520]   He was going to make a movie where you're going to say, "Wow, this is a lot bigger than
[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.240]   I thought someone with that budget could do."
[00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.320]   And that was the approach that made Star Wars big.
[00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.920]   He was like, "We're going to invent new technology for the special effects.
[00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.960]   It's going to be bigger than anyone's ever seen."
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.000]   Clearly James Cameron picked up that torch from Lucas after the fact.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.520]   So anyways, that's what I learned about Lucas, is this guy was incredibly talented, incredibly
[00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.520]   ambitious.
[00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.200]   He was going to do everything bigger than anyone had ever done it before, and really,
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.200]   really focused.
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.200]   Also, very rich.
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.200]   I don't know if you know that.
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.200]   Yeah, he's like a billionaire, isn't he?
[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.200]   Yeah, he's a billionaire.
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.200]   Were you a Star Wars guy, Jesse?
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.200]   I've seen some of the movies, not all of them.
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.200]   Probably not as much as you are.
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:11.200]   Is Lucas and Spielberg friends?
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:12.200]   Yeah, yeah, they were friends.
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:13.200]   They all knew each other.
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.200]   And they were going back and forth.
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.200]   It's hard to overestimate how much money they were making.
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.200]   And I think that's what made Star Wars so popular.
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:17.200]   I think that's what made it so popular.
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.200]   I think that's what made it so popular.
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:19.200]   I think that's what made it so popular.

[00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:23.080]   - Well, somewhere there, hopefully you'd have a writing shed
[00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:25.080]   so that wouldn't get burned down,
[00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:27.080]   so you could just escape to there.
[00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:29.080]   - Yeah. Well, that is my dream, is I want a writing shed,
[00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:31.080]   and I don't have room for a writing shed.
[00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:33.080]   and I don't have room for a writing shed.
[00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:35.080]   It is a dream of mine, so I need...
[00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:37.080]   I was having this conversation.
[00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:39.080]   For real, I was having this conversation
[00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:41.080]   with two different people in the last month,
[00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:43.080]   writers, who have a getaway plot.
[00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:45.080]   writers, who have a getaway plot.
[00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:47.080]   It's kind of an interesting model.
[00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:49.080]   A place they go...
[00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:51.080]   It's not like a large cultivated land,
[00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:53.080]   and it's not nice, it's quiet.
[00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:55.080]   and it's not nice, it's quiet.
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:57.080]   And they have a place to write.
[00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:59.080]   So I have a writer I was talking to who lives
[00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:01.080]   right outside New York City in a town that's kind of like Tacoma Park,
[00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:03.080]   and about 90 minutes up 87,
[00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:05.080]   he has some land,
[00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:07.080]   I guess that'd be like the southern Cascades.
[00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:09.080]   There's a little writing shed.
[00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:11.080]   And then another guy,
[00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:13.080]   a good friend of mine,
[00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:15.080]   was telling me,
[00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:17.080]   he lives in Chicago, in the city in a row house,
[00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:19.080]   and they just bought a plot
[00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:21.080]   that is
[00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:23.080]   four or five acres,
[00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:25.080]   near one of the... I don't know what the Great Lake is,
[00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:27.080]   near there, but whatever that is, Lake Michigan.
[00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:29.080]   It's not on the water, it's one lot in
[00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:31.080]   from the water. And it has like an old barn,
[00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:33.080]   and they're planting an orchard on it,
[00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:35.080]   and they can get there in 90 minutes as well.
[00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:37.080]   And he's building, he was showing me these plans,
[00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:39.080]   like a fireman
[00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:41.080]   forest fire watch tower.
[00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:43.080]   You know, like you would build,
[00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:45.080]   they used to build to look for forest fires,
[00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:47.080]   and at the top of this tower,
[00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:49.080]   so it's like an elevated gazebo.
[00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:51.080]   And that's where he's going to do his deep work,
[00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:53.080]   because you can see the lake.
[00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:55.080]   How does he get up there? Does he take an elevator?
[00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:57.080]   It could be a ladder.
[00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:59.080]   It's like icy up there.
[00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:01.080]   Well, you know, a little bit of danger gets the heart going.
[00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:03.080]   So I'm excited about that. So I don't know,
[00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:05.080]   maybe this is, I like this notion of having a getaway
[00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:07.080]   plot, that it's not super
[00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:09.080]   hard to maintain, you don't need like a really big house,
[00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:11.080]   but the key to a getaway plot
[00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:13.080]   is, I think it has to be
[00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:15.080]   non-trivially
[00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:17.080]   sub two hours away.
[00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:19.080]   If it's two hours or more,
[00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:21.080]   you can't go and write for a day
[00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:23.080]   and come back.
[00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:25.080]   Yeah, I see that. Two quick points.
[00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:27.080]   I, there's
[00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:29.080]   no doubt in my mind that you'll find something like that.
[00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:31.080]   I've been listening to your stuff for a long time, and I
[00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:33.080]   think you'll find it eventually, because you talk
[00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:35.080]   about it a lot. And then,
[00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:37.080]   secondly, in terms of self-help books,
[00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:39.080]   I was listening
[00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:41.080]   to Ferris' podcast recently, and
[00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:43.080]   he quoted you on giving him a
[00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:45.080]   suggestion for the self-help book
[00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:47.080]   that he read when he wasn't even
[00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:49.080]   going to read new books. So that was kind
[00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:51.080]   of cool. I just listened to that recently. Yeah,
[00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:53.080]   that's a good book. So it's Oliver Berkman's
[00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:55.080]   book, "4,000 Weeks."
[00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:57.080]   I talked about it, I
[00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:59.080]   told Tim about it, and then Tim
[00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:01.080]   read it, and then Tim did the thing that I
[00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:03.080]   think every publisher
[00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:05.080]   wishes would happen.
[00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:07.080]   I said, "Tim, I believe he,
[00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:09.080]   you listen to this, he released the first
[00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:11.080]   chapter, the audiobook
[00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:13.080]   version of the first chapter of Oliver's book
[00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:15.080]   on his podcast. Is that right?
[00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:17.080]   Yeah, I just listened to it, actually.
[00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:19.080]   Man, could you imagine having the first chapter
[00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:21.080]   of your audiobook on Ferris'
[00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:23.080]   podcast? So "4,000
[00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:25.080]   Weeks" is a cool book.
[00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:27.080]   I read it a long time ago, because I blurbed it.
[00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:29.080]   I read it back before it came
[00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:31.080]   out. And it's
[00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:33.080]   a great concept. It's called "Time Management for
[00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:35.080]   Mortals," and 4,000 weeks
[00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:37.080]   is roughly how many weeks you live.
[00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:39.080]   Oliver's whole point is
[00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:41.080]   most things you're not going to get done, you have a very
[00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:43.080]   limited amount of time.
[00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:45.080]   All these wild dreams you have, most of them won't happen.
[00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:47.080]   And be okay
[00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:49.080]   with that. And spend
[00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:51.080]   more time enjoying
[00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:53.080]   what you do have and what you can do,
[00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:55.080]   and don't be so aggressively goal-oriented.
[00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:57.080]   It was that book hit a nerve
[00:19:57.080 --> 00:19:59.080]   well before Ferris mentioned it.
[00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:01.080]   That thing was, yeah, that thing crushed it.
[00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:03.080]   I think it's one of the
[00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:05.080]   better-selling in our world of the people
[00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:07.080]   we know that write the sort of
[00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:09.080]   New Yorker-style self-help.
[00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:11.080]   He's a Guardian guy. He's a very smart guy.
[00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:13.080]   I think that book is the one that really crushed it this year.
[00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:15.080]   I'm very happy
[00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:17.080]   for Oliver. I've always loved his stuff, and he's been very
[00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:19.080]   kind to my stuff. So, circle
[00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:21.080]   goes around. All right, one more book.
[00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:23.080]   I finally read
[00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:25.080]   some Wendell Berry.
[00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:27.080]   So I don't know, do you know any...
[00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:29.080]   He's not as well-known as I thought.
[00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:31.080]   Have you heard of Wendell Berry?
[00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:33.080]   No. Cool guy.
[00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:35.080]   He's old now. He's in his 80s.
[00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:37.080]   But he went... grew up in Kentucky
[00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:39.080]   on a small farm.
[00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:41.080]   Went to New York City.
[00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:43.080]   Got educated. I don't know, Columbia
[00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:45.080]   or NYU or something. Got sort of overly educated.
[00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:47.080]   Got a writing job in New York City. He wanted
[00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:49.080]   to be a writer, and he was going to do the whole
[00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:51.080]   modern
[00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:53.080]   cosmopolitan writer thing,
[00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:55.080]   where you live in a city.
[00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:57.080]   You're not from somewhere. You're just
[00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:59.080]   observing things around
[00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:01.080]   the world. And
[00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:03.080]   for whatever reason, he's like, "I don't like this.
[00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:05.080]   I'm from Kentucky.
[00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:07.080]   I want to go back to Kentucky.
[00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:09.080]   I want Kentucky to be my muse.
[00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:11.080]   I want to be from a place and write about the place.
[00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:13.080]   I don't want to be just this
[00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:15.080]   abstraction writer that just
[00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:17.080]   is commenting on the world from a cosmopolitan
[00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:19.080]   detached place. I want to go back."
[00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:21.080]   So he moves back to Kentucky,
[00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:23.080]   gets a professorship at a small
[00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:25.080]   Kentucky college near
[00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:27.080]   where he grew up. Him and his wife
[00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:29.080]   buy... I think it's 12
[00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:31.080]   acres. Like a hobby farm.
[00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:33.080]   He grew up farming, but this
[00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:35.080]   is not a production farm. He's like, "We're going to live on
[00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:37.080]   12 acres. I'm going to be a professor, and I'm
[00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:39.080]   going to write about Kentucky."
[00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:41.080]   And then another plot became
[00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:43.080]   available. "We should probably buy that."
[00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:45.080]   And then another plot became available after that. "We should probably
[00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:47.080]   buy that." And he ends up with
[00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:49.080]   a real production farm, 100-plus
[00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:51.080]   acre farm. And
[00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:53.080]   this is why he's awesome.
[00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:55.080]   He's like, "I'm not into this whole
[00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:57.080]   gasoline thing.
[00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:59.080]   I'm going to farm the way I learned to farm,
[00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:01.080]   which is teams of horses."
[00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:03.080]   And he still... I mean, he doesn't
[00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:05.080]   farm. He's 80 now. But all throughout
[00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:07.080]   his career, he never went
[00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:09.080]   to tractors. He farmed with horses.
[00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:11.080]   This guy's awesome. So he leaves
[00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:13.080]   New York to farm with
[00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:15.080]   horses this farm
[00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:17.080]   in Kentucky,
[00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:19.080]   rural Kentucky, and
[00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:21.080]   is a novelist
[00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:23.080]   poet, but mainly an essayist.
[00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:25.080]   And he writes essays. He
[00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:27.080]   writes a series of essays,
[00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:29.080]   Bill McKibben-style
[00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:31.080]   essays about the economy and the environment,
[00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:33.080]   and a very influential writer.
[00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:35.080]   And writes it from
[00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:37.080]   this farm where he doesn't own a computer
[00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:39.080]   and you can't read. If you want to talk to him, you have
[00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:41.080]   to call the farmhouse and come out
[00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:43.080]   to the farm. He's an awesome guy.
[00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:45.080]   And they just released the first
[00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:47.080]   definitive
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:49.080]   essay collection where they
[00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:51.080]   pulled together. It's called "The World Ending Fire."
[00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:53.080]   This came out in 2019. If you get
[00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:55.080]   it, you'll love it. And I think Nick Offerman,
[00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:57.080]   who I also love from Parks and Recreation,
[00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:59.080]   Ron Swanson, who by the way is a guy
[00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:01.080]   who lives in LA, is a working actor,
[00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:03.080]   but also has a giant woodworking
[00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:05.080]   wood shop in a light industrial
[00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:07.080]   warehouse in LA. And he spends a lot
[00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:09.080]   of time building canoes.
[00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:11.080]   Like Ron Swanson, he does the
[00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:13.080]   intro or the prologue. So on the audio book,
[00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:15.080]   Nick Offerman reads it. Anyways,
[00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:17.080]   so I read my first collection,
[00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:19.080]   full collection of Wendell Berry essays.
[00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:21.080]   Are you going to take a field trip out there and check it out?
[00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:23.080]   I should, man. This guy's awesome. He has an essay
[00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:25.080]   in there that I might write an
[00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:27.080]   essay about for my newsletter
[00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:29.080]   that's called "Why I Didn't Buy a Computer,"
[00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:31.080]   which is cool. And I think this was the
[00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:33.080]   '80s when he wrote this essay.
[00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:35.080]   And he's like, "Look, here's my rules for
[00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:37.080]   technology." And it's very much
[00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:39.080]   like I wrote about in Deep Work,
[00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:41.080]   where I go and I talk to a farmer, Forrest Pritchard,
[00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:43.080]   and say, "Farmers care.
[00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:45.080]   Farmers have
[00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:47.080]   pretty strict criteria
[00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:49.080]   for when they're going to spend money
[00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:51.080]   on a new tool, otherwise they'll go bankrupt.
[00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:53.080]   And we should have that same strict criteria when thinking about
[00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:55.080]   technology. We shouldn't just say, "I don't know.
[00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:57.080]   I heard
[00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:59.080]   about TikTok. I should probably use it."
[00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:01.080]   We should have a farmer's mindset. That was my point in
[00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:03.080]   Deep Work. It'd be like, "What's the value? What's the cost?
[00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:05.080]   Is there better ways to get that value?"
[00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:07.080]   Wendell Berry wrote this essay
[00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:09.080]   about this in the '80s. I didn't know about this. He gave
[00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:11.080]   this whole list of, "Here's how I decide whether
[00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:13.080]   or not to use a new technology, and
[00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:15.080]   the computer doesn't
[00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:17.080]   pass that test."
[00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:19.080]   He published it in Harper's.
[00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:21.080]   But what's cool about it is he got
[00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:23.080]   in trouble.
[00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:25.080]   The whole thing is in the essay collection.
[00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:27.080]   He wrote this essay.
[00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:29.080]   He's like, "I don't need a computer.
[00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:31.080]   See if you can see the part
[00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:33.080]   here we got in trouble." He's like, "Yeah.
[00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:35.080]   I write my things longhand, and my
[00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:37.080]   wife types them up, and
[00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:39.080]   we're good."
[00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:41.080]   That got him in a lot of trouble. In the essay
[00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:43.080]   collection,
[00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:45.080]   Harper's published a lot of these letters,
[00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:47.080]   and they published the letters in the essay collection.
[00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:49.080]   Then a lot of people got mad about that.
[00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:51.080]   They say, "Oh, well, you have a great technology
[00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:53.080]   called Wife, and that's how you actually blah, blah,
[00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:55.080]   blah." Then he wrote
[00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:57.080]   an essay in response.
[00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:59.080]   This is like analog
[00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:01.080]   Twitter. You're like Twitter, but if
[00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:03.080]   Twitter was in Harper's magazine, and there was
[00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:05.080]   a week between every ...
[00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:07.080]   He writes this thing in response, and he's
[00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:09.080]   like, "Basically, screw you. You don't know our
[00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:11.080]   family. You don't know how
[00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:13.080]   our marriage works, or this or that." He goes on this
[00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:15.080]   big, long, whatever.
[00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:17.080]   He's like, "Why are you all so defensive?
[00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:19.080]   I must have touched a nerve saying
[00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:21.080]   I don't need a computer, and you're all so mad at me.
[00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:23.080]   You're all techno-determinists, apologists."
[00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:25.080]   It's really interesting, this heated
[00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:27.080]   back and forth.
[00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:29.080]   This was kind of interesting. He introduces
[00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:31.080]   this
[00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:33.080]   very grounded in farming
[00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:35.080]   idea
[00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:37.080]   of home economics, which
[00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:39.080]   is quite different than what
[00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:41.080]   you would see in suburban D.C., where
[00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:43.080]   it's all
[00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:45.080]   salary, job,
[00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:47.080]   dual-income government families. He's like, "We
[00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:49.080]   have a
[00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:51.080]   home economy." It's a very farmer
[00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:53.080]   way of thinking about it, and that
[00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:55.080]   we all are ... Everyone
[00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:57.080]   in the family, me and my wife, we're all part of.
[00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:59.080]   We have this farm we run, and there's all these different
[00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:01.080]   things that have to happen, and this fence has to
[00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:03.080]   get repaired, and the milking has to happen,
[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:05.080]   and the horses have to be fed. I don't know how
[00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:07.080]   it works. We're all just working on everything
[00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:09.080]   as part of keeping this
[00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:11.080]   very incorporated, this household economy
[00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:13.080]   functioning, which is a very
[00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:15.080]   pre ... When you're not thinking about salaried
[00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:17.080]   work, but I'm producing from land,
[00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:19.080]   it's the way you think. It's like we
[00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:21.080]   have endless things that have to happen that we're all
[00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:23.080]   working on and trying to keep collectively
[00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:25.080]   our farm running.
[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:27.080]   He thought of his article writing,
[00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:29.080]   he just placed it in that same context. He's
[00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:31.080]   like, "Yeah, these articles that go
[00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:33.080]   out as part of what keeps the household economy
[00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:35.080]   running, we're all just part of it. I do
[00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:37.080]   some writing, she does some editing, we do some
[00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:39.080]   whatever. It's just like I
[00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:41.080]   put the staves on the fence,
[00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:43.080]   and you whitewash them." It was really interesting
[00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:45.080]   to see this
[00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:47.080]   clash that was happening. It's like
[00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:49.080]   a culture clash. He was coming
[00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:51.080]   from a world where
[00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:53.080]   you
[00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:55.080]   owned land, and
[00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:57.080]   that was your source of income. It was very ...
[00:26:57.080 --> 00:26:59.080]   You're a ...
[00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:01.080]   I don't know what the right term is, but like yeoman farmer
[00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:03.080]   type thing. I'm
[00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:05.080]   trying to make a living off of ... Our family's
[00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:07.080]   trying to make a living off of our land. We all work together
[00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:09.080]   to try to do it. He was coming from that mindset, but
[00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:11.080]   in the '80s, everything was shifting
[00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:13.080]   towards most people weren't on farms.
[00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:15.080]   Most people weren't running their own
[00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:17.080]   small businesses in town, where just the whole family
[00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:19.080]   works at it, the donut shop to keep it
[00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:21.080]   running. It was salaries,
[00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:23.080]   and it was typically dual income salaries.
[00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:25.080]   This whole discussion about work
[00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:27.080]   and meaning and
[00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:29.080]   who's working and not working,
[00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:31.080]   all of that was just beginning, and
[00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:33.080]   this "Why don't buy a
[00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:35.080]   computer?" came out, boom, right as that
[00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:37.080]   was happening. You could see in that frision
[00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:39.080]   this
[00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:41.080]   is when this huge cultural
[00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:43.080]   shift was happening. That was a cool
[00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:45.080]   part of the book, is in this essays and the letters
[00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:47.080]   and the back and forth, you can see these
[00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:49.080]   worlds colliding.
[00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:51.080]   In the collision, you actually got
[00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:53.080]   more insight than what any individual
[00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:55.080]   essay or letter was saying about.
[00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:57.080]   It was a very dialectical thing. It was really cool.
[00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:59.080]   In the collision of Barry with
[00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:01.080]   these letter writers in the '80s, you got more
[00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:03.080]   insight into the changing
[00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:05.080]   culture than you got
[00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:07.080]   from just reading any one individual
[00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:09.080]   essay about that period. I just wanted
[00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:11.080]   to point that out. It was a pretty cool part of the book.
[00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:13.080]   You should send him a letter, because
[00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:15.080]   earlier you were talking about how your friend saw you
[00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:17.080]   mention on Twitter, but this way you
[00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:19.080]   only get in touch with him if you send him
[00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:21.080]   a letter. That's literally how you get in touch with him,
[00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:23.080]   by the way. I know. You should do it.
[00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:25.080]   That's how reporters do it. That's how this essay book
[00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:27.080]   came together. You have to send him
[00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:29.080]   a letter, and then he may answer.
[00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:31.080]   He's very old now.
[00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:33.080]   Probably doesn't get much mail.
[00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:35.080]   Yeah. I wonder what that's like.
[00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:37.080]   If you only do letters... He probably liked getting mail.
[00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:39.080]   But it's the Internet age. Does he get a lot
[00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:41.080]   of... I'm sure he gets a lot of
[00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:43.080]   stuff from publicists,
[00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:45.080]   like books,
[00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:47.080]   where you blurb this, that type of stuff.
[00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:51.080]   Anyways, Barry's a cool guy.
[00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:53.080]   I'm going to read some more Barry.
[00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:55.080]   That's what I read in
[00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:57.080]   December 2021.
[00:28:57.080 --> 00:28:59.080]   I'm deep into working on January
[00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:01.080]   2022 books, and we will check in
[00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:03.080]   at the end of this month with how
[00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:05.080]   my current reading
[00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:07.080]   is going.
[00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:09.080]   [music]
[00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:11.660]   (upbeat music)
[00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:13.800]   (upbeat music)
