[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.240]   My guest on today's show is Nate Dodson.
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:54.000]   Nate, fascinating guy who is an expert at building a lifestyle of independence.

[00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:16.700]   with you.
[00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.200]   Nate, welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.200]   Nate Dodson, Radical Personal Finance
[00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.200]   Thanks for having me.
[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.200]   Hey, man.
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.320]   You're a longtime listener to the show, and I brought you on today to talk about some
[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.600]   of the micro-businesses that you have been able to build.
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.040]   I think some of the content will be helpful to other listeners of Radical Personal Finance
[00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.760]   who are interested in pursuing similar paths.
[00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:41.920]   As we begin, could you share for a few minutes your path to the businesses that you now participate
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:42.920]   with?
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.920]   Nate Dodson Yeah, absolutely.
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:51.920]   I've basically been creating micro-businesses since I was in fourth grade, and nothing that
[00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.680]   really caught on steam besides selling weed in high school.
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.760]   Hold on, I've got to ask.
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:06.080]   Was this a long-time financial strategy of yours, or was this just a short-term side
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.080]   gig?
[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.280]   Nate Dodson Well, it was just one of the first ones that
[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.280]   caught on.
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.400]   I mean, I did ... like fifth grade, I was selling candy and did a school newspaper,
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.000]   and in high school I got into marijuana and mushrooms, and that was the only thing that
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.920]   started actually making me money for a business.
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:29.720]   So, how did you get started in a drug-dealing business as a high school student?
[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.200]   What was that process like?
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.440]   Nate Dodson It actually just came out of working at a
[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.440]   skate shop.
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:43.400]   I was working at a skate shop and got to know some guys that had the connection to good
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.520]   marijuana in my little small town and didn't have anything like that, so I started giving
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.520]   it to my friends.
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.200]   And pretty soon, you know it, I was working at McDonald's.
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:57.080]   I was 15 and a half to 16, and they would always say, "Nate, you have like 10 checks
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.080]   waiting to be picked up."
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.520]   I would never pick up my checks because I just didn't even care about the money I was
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:02.520]   making at McDonald's.
[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.320]   Dave Boll How much money did you earn?
[00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.520]   Nate Dodson I don't know.
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.360]   I've never been one to really keep track of how much money I've earned, to be completely
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.360]   honest with you.
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:19.280]   I just had money just coming out of my pockets.
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.280]   I didn't have any bills.
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.280]   I was living with my parents.
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.280]   I was just a teenager.
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.280]   Dave Boll Did you waste it all, or what did you do
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.280]   with the money?
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.320]   Nate Dodson Well, I know I've reached a point where I
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.000]   didn't have any, so I guess I did waste it at some point.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.520]   Dave Boll Did you get caught, or how did you get out
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.080]   of that business, assuming that you have?
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.600]   Nate Dodson Well, I just got out of it.
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.560]   I came down to school at IU, Indiana University, and just kind of got out of it from then.
[00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.800]   Just grew out of it.
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:53.160]   This wasn't something I wanted to be risky anymore, and just got interested in other
[00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.160]   things.
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.680]   I get interested in something new every few months.
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:56.680]   Dave Boll Sure, sure.
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:57.680]   Well, go for it.
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:58.680]   Continue your story.
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.680]   I just couldn't resist asking about that business, but keep going with your story.
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.120]   Nate Dodson Yeah, so that was one of the ones that worked.
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:13.400]   I had many years when a business didn't work, and I went through college and had several
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.200]   jobs out of college.
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:21.520]   I did actually did some handyman work in college by just putting an ad in the paper, and that
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:24.680]   made me a little bit of money.
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.520]   But then ended up back in Bloomington, where I went to school.
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.280]   I lived in Portland, Oregon for a little bit, Michigan for a little bit.
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:38.720]   Ended up back here, and got a job as a restoration ecologist, which is a fancy word for kind
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:39.720]   of a laborer.
[00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.960]   I sprayed a lot of herbicide, and worked out in the woods, and did forestry work, cutting
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.040]   down trees and stuff.
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.640]   I just started to not feel that healthy.
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:55.360]   I was newly married, and I would go out of town a lot, and I would get covered in herbicide
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.360]   all the time.
[00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:04.960]   I've just always kind of had this entrepreneurial background, or entrepreneurial tendencies,
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:05.960]   I guess.
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.000]   I was exploring stuff on the side the whole time.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:17.280]   Then in, I think it was 2012, my wife got pregnant, and I knew I would have a daughter,
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:21.240]   or I didn't know I was a daughter at the time, but I knew I'd have a kid in nine months.
[00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:26.560]   I just started to think about the fact that I would not have time to spend with her if
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:31.360]   I was working 55 hours a week, and going out of town all the time.
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.000]   I just like, I need to get serious about this.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:41.920]   So I started to read a bunch of business books, and looked online, and Etsy just seemed really
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:42.920]   easy.
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:46.400]   There's a lot of things that make it a really easy kind of gateway business for someone
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.080]   to get into.
[00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:53.360]   Basically, there's numbers on there, so you can see what people are purchasing on everyone's
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.360]   site.
[00:05:54.360 --> 00:06:00.400]   So you can see kind of what's in demand just by going through there.
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:07.440]   So I just started looking on there, and I saw, "Oh, I make stuff kind of like that already,
[00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:08.720]   just for the fun of it.
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:12.280]   So I'll put my stuff online and see if it sells."
[00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.760]   Stuff started selling, and it grew into an Etsy business.
[00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:20.800]   I've done a few of them actually since then, two of them which I still actively manage.
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.720]   >>Steve: So is Etsy now your family's full-time income?
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:29.040]   >>Jay: No, it's not our full-time income.
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:33.200]   I mean, it actually covers our full-time income, because we live really cheap.
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:38.440]   We're really into just radical simplicity.
[00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:41.360]   Our goal for next year actually is to live under $15,000 a year.
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:42.360]   >>Steve: That's awesome.
[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:46.640]   >>Jay: And that'll be for a family of four when my daughter comes to end up, or my new
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:51.240]   child comes to end of March.
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:52.320]   So it's not a full-time income.
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:57.920]   My wife works 10 hours a week as a dietician, give or take.
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:59.600]   And then we have the farm.
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:06.680]   We earned a little income off of last year, should earn a little more off this year.
[00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:08.720]   And I have a rental house as well.
[00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:14.320]   >>Steve: So you've got a diverse series of income streams, which is awesome.
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:21.320]   So what makes Etsy – you mentioned that Etsy is very accessible, and you mentioned
[00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:23.360]   because you can go on there and see what's selling.
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:28.480]   So is the trick just to go on Etsy and see who's selling stuff and copy them and rip
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:30.400]   off their stuff and create your own?
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:34.440]   Or where does somebody start if they're interested in creating an Etsy business?
[00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:40.320]   >>Jay: Well, you probably really could do that if you wanted, but you don't really need
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:41.320]   to do that.
[00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:44.760]   You can just kind of – it has an existing audience.
[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:45.760]   It's a platform.
[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:47.360]   It's got the infrastructure.
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:51.680]   It's easy just to put stuff on there without having to go through the trouble of building
[00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:54.200]   a website or source stuff from China.
[00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:58.200]   I mean, it's just really low risk, and it's a rapid reward.
[00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:03.440]   It doesn't take a lot of upfront things to build out an Etsy store.
[00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:08.920]   But yeah, you can go on there, and I encourage people just to browse around just forever
[00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:12.320]   and find stuff that you think is cool.
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:14.280]   And you can look.
[00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:15.280]   There's a number down the side.
[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:17.560]   You can see how many sales they've had.
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:21.400]   When you click on the sales, you can see what actual products they're selling.
[00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:25.520]   So I'm not necessarily advocating that you just copy people and rip them off completely,
[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:33.440]   but just go on there and get inspired and create something that resonates with you.
[00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:38.480]   And also, the thing about Etsy is that they do allow outside manufacturing.
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:43.520]   So you can find products on there that you think are cool that are selling.
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:45.760]   There's a proven demand.
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:50.160]   And then you can put up an ad on Craigslist and find a local person to make it for you.
[00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:53.880]   And as long as it still has a profit margin, you're good to go.
[00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:58.360]   What types of products do you sell on Etsy?
[00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:01.360]   Right now, my two main ones are prints.
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:09.520]   I sell artwork, and I'm getting ready to build those out into more products, actually.
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:13.680]   And then I also sell a luxury wedding guest book that sells for $150.
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:16.720]   So those are my two main ones.
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:24.920]   But I also have experience selling skateboards, custom skateboards, and teepees, like children's
[00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:26.760]   play tents.
[00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:31.280]   And then I've helped a couple other people start Etsy businesses as well.
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:35.800]   So one of my goals here, as we record this, is the beginning of 2016.
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:44.560]   One of my goals in 2016 is to bring more income opportunities to the listeners of Radical
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:48.640]   Personal Finance, to help people diversify their income streams, to help people build
[00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:56.400]   a backup source of income, and just basically more ideas about side hustles.
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:04.640]   So talk about if you were advising me and I said, "Hey, I want to start an Etsy business,"
[00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:06.080]   walk me through the whole process.
[00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:10.040]   I've got some ideas on maybe some things that I can create.
[00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:11.040]   I've looked around.
[00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:12.760]   I've got some ideas.
[00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:16.520]   Walk me through the process of doing that.
[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:21.320]   If you've already got some ideas, I would go onto Etsy and search for what your ideas
[00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:25.040]   are and see if people are making something similar that's actually selling.
[00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:29.280]   Otherwise, you might want to just scrap that idea and go with something that has some proven
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:30.280]   demand.
[00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:36.520]   Etsy's been around for a while, and the customers have already decided what they're in the market
[00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:38.160]   for.
[00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:42.600]   When you're starting out as an entrepreneur, you're either an inventor or an innovator.
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.720]   The inventor part's really hard.
[00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:47.120]   It's hard to get it right.
[00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:51.200]   Innovating is just seeing what the market is already out there in the market and making
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:56.200]   it a little better or making it a little appealing.
[00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:57.760]   That's what I would do to start.
[00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:01.760]   The competition on Etsy is pretty weak, I would say.
[00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:08.040]   I've been really successful on there, and I've given it pretty low effort, to be honest
[00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:10.240]   with you.
[00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:15.840]   Both those businesses were a couple months of going at it a little bit hard, and then
[00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:21.800]   now I'm just working on them less than 10 hours a week.
[00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:27.720]   If you can dedicate large chunks of time and just create systems and build a brand and
[00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:33.120]   a sales funnel and do all the legitimate business stuff, you're going to be successful on there.
[00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:34.120]   That's for sure.
[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:39.680]   Do you have to, on Etsy, do it all yourself, or is it possible to set up this as a more
[00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:45.640]   passive type of business?
[00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:47.040]   You don't have to do it all yourself.
[00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:49.320]   You're allowed to have a company.
[00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:55.240]   You don't have to be just a solopreneur, just building a product yourself.
[00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:56.360]   You definitely want to.
[00:11:56.360 --> 00:12:00.400]   I think any business, you want to make it somewhat scalable and passive.
[00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:06.000]   If you're going to pick a product, I would definitely recommend picking something that
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.920]   you can create systems that either through human labor or just something you create once
[00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:18.520]   and sell over and over again will still bring you a profit margin, which is what my prints
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:19.720]   are.
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:25.360]   My prints, I create a print one time, and some of them I've sold hundreds of times.
[00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:31.000]   That hour I took to create that print, if you go out through the rest of my life, I
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.960]   made $6,000 an hour when I made that print.
[00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:41.440]   Definitely picking something scalable is important and somewhat passive to some degree.
[00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:45.400]   What's not necessarily important, if you love just making necklaces all day, then go for
[00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:46.860]   it.
[00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:50.960]   If you want to free up your time to just follow your passions or tinker, which is pretty much
[00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:56.000]   what I do with all my extra time, then that's what I would recommend for sure.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:05.280]   >> Any other examples of micro businesses that you've built that have worked well?
[00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:09.120]   >> Most of them have failed.
[00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:10.640]   The farm is actually catching on.
[00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:15.840]   I've got an urban farm going here in Bloomington, and it's catching on and brought in a little
[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:23.080]   bit of income, and I think it should bring in 10 to 20 grand this year.
[00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:24.080]   That's just a rough estimate.
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:29.040]   I'm not trying to go too hard on it, because I have another child coming at the end of
[00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:30.040]   March.
[00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:31.440]   Most of my stuff I've done has failed.
[00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:34.720]   The Etsy thing, it's so easy.
[00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:40.760]   I was successful, so it had to be easy, because I'm not all that smart.
[00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:41.760]   I have ADD.
[00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:48.680]   I can't stick with an idea for more than a couple months for sure, and it's done well,
[00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:51.240]   so if that tells you anything.
[00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:56.600]   >> You don't seem to be very bothered by the string of failures that you described.
[00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:59.480]   >> Oh, no.
[00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:01.640]   Not at all.
[00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:07.280]   It's going to be crazy to show my kids one day all of the folders on my computer of the
[00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:11.280]   150 business ideas I've had.
[00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:19.240]   I was always trying to just invent a new wheel and build something life-changing, but I think
[00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:24.000]   it's really a better strategy to just build something that brings some cash flow.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.520]   I don't work for the company anymore.
[00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:32.560]   I'm just home, and it doesn't take me very many hours at all to create a livelihood,
[00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:39.280]   especially since I've cut all our costs down and everything.
[00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:44.120]   I have half the day to be creative and hang out with my family, and that's what it's all
[00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:46.640]   about to me.
[00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:50.800]   I don't think you need to be a millionaire to be happy.
[00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:54.840]   I don't know how I got on that tangent.
[00:14:54.840 --> 00:15:01.360]   >> What are some of the major strategies that allow you to live as a family of four with
[00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:07.880]   a baby soon to be born on such a small amount of annual expenses?
[00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:14.360]   >> Well, we have the farm here.
[00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:22.480]   When you have a farm, you have food waste, which is paid for by your business, essentially.
[00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:26.520]   There's a certain amount of product you can't sell, and instead of composting it, you're
[00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:27.520]   allowed to eat it.
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:28.520]   >> Right.
[00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:30.360]   >> One can tell you can't.
[00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:31.360]   Food is a huge thing.
[00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:34.800]   I got into hunting.
[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:38.360]   I've got a bunch of venison in the freezer.
[00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:43.000]   That was one of our big expenses, and then we just don't buy stuff.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:49.360]   We have a thrift shop just down the street if we want something, or we just do it ourselves.
[00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:51.920]   Let's see.
[00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:53.000]   What else?
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:58.280]   I don't have internet at my house, and I make my living online.
[00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:01.640]   That's the whole thing.
[00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:03.800]   Our house has crappy carpets.
[00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:07.880]   There's lots of stuff that we're not doing to impress our friends, basically.
[00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:10.600]   We get on our bikes when we want to go somewhere.
[00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:15.320]   We do have a car, actually, but it's got 220,000 miles on it.
[00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:22.000]   Actually, I just got a new van, too.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.840]   Anytime we're going to make a purchase, we just delay it and decide whether we can avoid
[00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:27.840]   it, basically.
[00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:31.280]   >> Are you and your wife on the same page?
[00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:38.080]   Do you guys find it easy to both desire to live this frugal, relaxed lifestyle, or does
[00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:40.680]   it bring conflict in your relationship?
[00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:47.880]   >> Yeah, I would say we're on the same page, where both of us have desires, and then the
[00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:56.440]   other person talks them out of fulfilling their desires, basically, if that makes sense.
[00:16:56.440 --> 00:17:02.960]   We've talked about how we want our life to be centered around connection with our friends,
[00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:11.800]   with each other, with our family, and with nature, and not about becoming millionaires,
[00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:16.840]   having a housekeeper, having a mansion, and having a Mercedes.
[00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:26.280]   We both know that, but with advertising and technology, we both have stuff we want.
[00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:27.280]   We just talk about it.
[00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:29.000]   We're around each other all the time.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.240]   I work from home.
[00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:35.400]   She's only gone an hour or two a day, so we have a lot of time to talk.
[00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:42.840]   Whenever we're in the car, our one phone that we ... I'm getting rid of my phone.
[00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:46.560]   It gets shut off, actually, tomorrow, because I thought maybe you might call, but I'll have
[00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:50.520]   no cell phone and no internet at the house besides this patchy connection I get off one
[00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:57.400]   of my neighbors, which I wish they would cancel, so I didn't have internet at home.
[00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:59.280]   We just set up our lives.
[00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:03.800]   Obviously, we look at our expenses and see where we're spending money and just work at
[00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:07.320]   it, cut it, build skills, stuff like that.
[00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:13.520]   How do you run an online business without internet in your house?
[00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:19.240]   Library, coffee shops.
[00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:21.480]   When you have it at your house, it's just too tempting.
[00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:24.440]   You're just always on there, or you're just goofing off.
[00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:30.120]   If you have to go somewhere ... I'm riding my bike in the freezing cold, and I'm sitting
[00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:36.920]   in a coffee shop on an uncomfortable wooden chair, I want to get my work done fast.
[00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:38.600]   I want to get it done in three hours.
[00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:43.080]   I used to have a business building websites, and I didn't know how to build websites, and
[00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:45.040]   I didn't have internet at my house.
[00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:49.160]   These are the kind of things you can do if you're just a little bit creative.
[00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:54.920]   I ran these businesses for the first year and a half, working full-time and going out
[00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:55.920]   of town.
[00:18:55.920 --> 00:19:01.960]   I had products I had to ship.
[00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:04.760]   I started working at home, and I didn't get any more done.
[00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:09.960]   I freed up an average of 65 hours a week, and I didn't get any more done.
[00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:13.360]   A lot of the time we spend, people say they're working.
[00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:15.560]   If they're working from home, they're just goofing off.
[00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:22.200]   >> Don't you feel like it might be easier just to go and get a job and make a little
[00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:26.120]   bit more money and be able to save a little bit more money and have a little bit of an
[00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:28.640]   easier lifestyle?
[00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:33.560]   >> I'm not opposed to getting a job.
[00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:38.400]   If it's something that I somewhat enjoy, and I loved the people I worked with at my old
[00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:41.680]   job, that was definitely the best part about it.
[00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:47.320]   I'm not opposed to getting a job, but I don't want it to interfere with this whole other
[00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:53.080]   part of life, like family and creativity.
[00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:58.440]   When it starts intruding into those areas of my life, then I'm definitely not for it.
[00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:01.480]   Then it starts to feel like slavery.
[00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:07.000]   It starts to feel depressing.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.560]   I don't know if that makes sense to you.
[00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:13.240]   >> Last couple of questions.
[00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:23.200]   Obviously for you to be able to live on that low of annual expenses, like you said, next
[00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:24.200]   year you think you'll be under $15,000.
[00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:27.080]   Do you have any guess of what you spent in 2015?
[00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:30.320]   >> About $24,000.
[00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:33.640]   >> Major strategies that have allowed you to save money on housing, what are they?
[00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:34.640]   Do you own a home?
[00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:37.040]   Do you just own an old home?
[00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:40.920]   What are the major strategies that have allowed you to lower your housing costs?
[00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:45.000]   >> We have a rental property that's just four blocks away.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.200]   Then we have our house here.
[00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:48.200]   It's a three bedroom.
[00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:49.200]   It has a master bedroom.
[00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:53.560]   I actually turned the master bedroom into a tiny house.
[00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:58.640]   The bedroom beside it now, I'm getting ready to build a wall in the hallway.
[00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:04.120]   It'll be a two bedroom, tiny house, and then another house.
[00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:10.920]   I had someone living in there before that was just working for me for six hours a week
[00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:13.200]   in exchange for free housing.
[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:18.160]   Now we're thinking of actually renting the other half of our house.
[00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:23.880]   I don't know how legal it really is, but between that and the rental house, it covers both
[00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:27.440]   of our mortgages easily, plus a little bit more actually.
[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:29.400]   >> You've got a traditional rental house.
[00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:32.360]   You're renting out or intending to rent out part of your house.
[00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:37.440]   Then you're also farming the land on your own property.
[00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:39.360]   That's where you're building your urban farm?
[00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:45.800]   >> Yep, farming the land on my own property and two other plots in town, two and a half
[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:46.800]   plots in town.
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:50.520]   >> These are borrowed backyards, other people, you're just giving them a share of the food
[00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:53.440]   in exchange for the use of their backyard to farm on?
[00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:54.960]   >> Yep, exactly.
[00:21:54.960 --> 00:22:00.800]   I put up ads on Craigslist last year and had 50 people offer up their yards in town.
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:01.800]   >> That's cool.
[00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:04.440]   You try to keep your expenses on the house low.
[00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:10.080]   No internet at home, minimal phone service.
[00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:13.720]   Any other special strategies or ideas that you've worked on that have allowed you to
[00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:18.640]   keep your housing expenses low?
[00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:20.000]   >> Not really.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:27.720]   When we were looking to buy a house, we keep an eye on the market and finding a house that
[00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:31.600]   provided an opportunity to live cheaper.
[00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:33.160]   We wanted one that was close to town.
[00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:40.240]   We could ride our bikes easily everywhere, to the grocery especially, and also had space
[00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:41.240]   for gardening.
[00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:46.040]   I have a big, flat, south-facing yard.
[00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:48.560]   I did see the potential to rent out that room.
[00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:52.160]   It has its own little side porch.
[00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:53.520]   It's big enough to turn.
[00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:56.520]   It already had a bathroom off of it.
[00:22:56.520 --> 00:23:00.240]   That's the kind of thing I would look for if you're wanting to reduce your housing.
[00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:03.440]   >> Do you do anything special with regard to energy costs?
[00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:07.400]   I'd imagine being in Indiana, it's not a warm state to live in during the wintertime.
[00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:10.680]   Any special ideas there?
[00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:14.440]   >> We keep our house cold.
[00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:17.440]   Put extra blankets on the bed.
[00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:23.080]   I wear long johns and a thermal shirt all winter long, no matter what.
[00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:27.280]   I have a beanie on when I'm around the house most of the time, a sweatshirt, thick wool
[00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:30.920]   socks and slippers.
[00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:32.880]   It reduces our housing bill a lot.
[00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:36.720]   I actually cut a couple extra windows in the south side too to bring in some sun and some
[00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:40.880]   warmth.
[00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:47.240]   I just think you don't need that heat pumping through your house all day.
[00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:50.120]   It's actually better for your body to be in a little cold.
[00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:51.680]   You start to build brown fat.
[00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:54.120]   You're more likely to just go outside.
[00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:58.000]   When you go outside, it doesn't feel as cold.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:02.080]   I think that's the big one, to save on energy costs.
[00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:03.080]   >> What about the babies?
[00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:05.760]   Don't you get concerned about the babies being too cold?
[00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:09.520]   >> Oh no, Josie doesn't get cold at all.
[00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:12.880]   She runs around naked half the time when it's 60 degrees in here.
[00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:15.240]   >> That youthful energy.
[00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:20.440]   >> Yeah, you make your kids fragile by putting clothes on their whole lives.
[00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:29.800]   They naturally, they're born just, I don't know, they're more durable when they're babies.
[00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:35.920]   I know that sounds weird, but probably after the first year anyways.
[00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:37.160]   She's not bothered at all by it.
[00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:40.040]   Some days I'll be freezing because I'm working in my office for a little bit and I'm not
[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:41.840]   moving around much.
[00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:45.380]   That's the other thing too, having your house cold.
[00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:49.400]   When we get cold, it's because we know we're not moving.
[00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:52.560]   It's the perfect signal to tell you, get moving.
[00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:56.680]   Do some jumping jacks or go outside and get some exercise.
[00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:58.960]   There's so many benefits, I think, to keeping your house cold.
[00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:01.560]   >> You're hardcore, dude.
[00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:03.560]   Next, transportation.
[00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:06.960]   You have, I guess, two old cars and you just don't drive very much.
[00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:12.880]   Any other unique ideas that might be helpful to other listeners?
[00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:16.240]   >> We have the one old car and then we have a van that I just recently bought.
[00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:17.240]   It's a high roof van.
[00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:23.800]   We're going to do a bunch of traveling in it, turn it into a van dwelling situation.
[00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:29.720]   But no, biking, get a bus pass if you live in a city.
[00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:35.040]   Do whatever you can to avoid being a car clown driving around by yourself burning gas all
[00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:36.040]   day.
[00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:44.440]   >> Food, you have waste from the farm, which is a pretty sweet setup in that your farm
[00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:49.280]   allows you to deduct expenses that are associated with your home and your homestead because
[00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:50.280]   it's part of the business.
[00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:55.160]   And then there is going to be waste and so that waste can help some of your personal
[00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:56.160]   consumption.
[00:25:56.160 --> 00:26:02.640]   Then it also gives you products that you can barter, gives you a greater, stronger network,
[00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:08.120]   allows you to have access to the local producer community where you can get things at wholesale
[00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:12.040]   prices based upon a barter relationship or an exchange of labor.
[00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:16.960]   And then also hunting, which as long as you don't spend thousands of dollars on fancy
[00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:22.040]   hunting gear could be a cost helpful way to acquire food.
[00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:27.280]   Any other unique ideas to lower your food costs?
[00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:29.960]   >> Just avoid food waste is a big one.
[00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:33.320]   Too many people go buy a ton of stuff and they don't have a plan for what they're going
[00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:34.320]   to do with it.
[00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:39.680]   40% of the food in this country goes to waste.
[00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:46.360]   If you're the typical American, you're blowing 40% of that food budget is just going in the
[00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:48.160]   trash.
[00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:49.160]   So that's a big one.
[00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:50.160]   We also forage.
[00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:52.000]   It's one of our fun activities we do.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.520]   Go out in the woods and you can pick tons of stuff.
[00:26:55.520 --> 00:27:02.360]   We make big batches of nettle soup every year and all that stuff's free and it's fun for
[00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:04.720]   the family.
[00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:06.600]   And hunting's great.
[00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:11.960]   It's like meditation, sitting out there in nature, breathing fresh air.
[00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:19.280]   And I got into hunting with, I spent about 20 bucks on bullets.
[00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:21.400]   Got an old gun from my dad and that was it.
[00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:25.840]   But this year I'm going to go even more hardcore and learn to build a bow because I don't think
[00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:28.360]   you really know how to hunt unless you know how to build your weapon.
[00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:34.840]   So I'm going to learn how to build a bow and do some bow hunting.
[00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:42.640]   What else are your biggest expenses right now that you haven't been able to really crack
[00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:43.640]   very well?
[00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:46.440]   What's been the biggest frustration for you?
[00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:53.760]   I blow too much money on domain names, that's for sure.
[00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:57.840]   Every new business I get excited about I buy the domain name before I even have something
[00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:01.480]   built for it.
[00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:03.800]   That's one of the main ones, our healthcare.
[00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:05.880]   We have a $6,000 deductible.
[00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:11.280]   It's not that expensive I would say.
[00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:14.640]   That's pretty much it.
[00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:20.560]   I would have to pull up my thing but I can't think of any other big major expenses we have.
[00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:30.760]   If you were going to try to share encouragement with someone else, just say a young person,
[00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:34.040]   you were going to say about, "Hey, here are the things that are great about my lifestyle
[00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:40.160]   and here are the things that are tough," because you obviously don't live a mainstream lifestyle.
[00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:44.800]   To many listeners, the lifestyle you're describing, to some listeners it sounds awesome, but to
[00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:49.640]   many listeners there will be a sense of like, "Why?
[00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:51.200]   Why do that?"
[00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:55.200]   What would be the sales pitch you would give to somebody to just encourage them that they
[00:28:55.200 --> 00:29:02.240]   could consider practicing some of the things that you do?
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:09.600]   The main thing I would say is just look at the direction our culture's in right now by
[00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:12.560]   just this growth mindset.
[00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:18.080]   More money and build things bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger.
[00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:19.680]   It's not sustainable.
[00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:20.880]   There's no way it's sustainable.
[00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:25.560]   I guess maybe if we start mining asteroids it's possibly sustainable or we find another
[00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:28.040]   plant to live on eventually.
[00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:35.240]   If you care at all about, if you have kids or you just care about keeping future generations
[00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:40.560]   out of trouble, you should look at your impact.
[00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:45.840]   The other thing I would say is all of this stuff, it sounds hardcore because it's so
[00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:51.120]   far from mainstream, but just try doing one piece at a time and you'll realize that everything
[00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:55.100]   I'm describing, I think, is amazing.
[00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:56.980]   It's all fun stuff.
[00:29:56.980 --> 00:29:57.980]   It feels good.
[00:29:57.980 --> 00:30:03.260]   It forces you to get exercise, fresh air, movement, connecting more.
[00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:07.040]   You start farming, you're connecting with your community.
[00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:13.920]   You're building soil, which we're depleting at massive, fast rates.
[00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:19.500]   How much frustration do you have by checking your phone a million times a day or getting
[00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:21.120]   on Facebook a million times a day?
[00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:24.660]   I know I used to be in that trap and it was terrible.
[00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:27.760]   It just didn't feel good.
[00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:31.520]   You're working all the time and you're running your kids around to different activities and
[00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:33.940]   you don't have time to connect with them.
[00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:40.280]   Your kids are growing up and you're not there with them.
[00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:43.200]   It makes me cry thinking about it, Josh.
[00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:50.080]   It's so messed up how people are just giving ... I don't know.
[00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:56.600]   Kids don't give a shit about how much money you have.
[00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:58.280]   They just want your time.
[00:30:58.280 --> 00:30:59.280]   Sorry.
[00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:02.200]   >>Ted: It's true.
[00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:06.840]   It's absolutely true.
[00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:12.600]   The time at which they start to care how much money you have, meaning that if you go the
[00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:25.240]   normal path and you get into the middle teenage years, that's generally a societally-induced
[00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:28.520]   care many times.
[00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:33.640]   There are some basic necessities of life, but many times the concern about what kind
[00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:36.360]   of car my parents drive, that's peer pressure.
[00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:37.360]   That's where that enters in.
[00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:39.840]   >>Josh: Oh, yeah.
[00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:41.480]   Your car should just have two wheels.
[00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:43.400]   >>Ted: Two or four?
[00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:45.000]   >>Josh: Just two.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   >>Ted: Two.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   Okay, bicycle.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   Got it.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.480]   I'm having trouble picturing a two-wheel car.
[00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:54.920]   Well, Nate, man, thanks for coming on and just sharing a little bit of your story.
[00:31:54.920 --> 00:32:00.520]   Websites, your Etsy store, websites, social stuff, anywhere that you'd like people to
[00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:02.480]   go to check out some of your projects?
[00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:03.920]   >>Josh: Yeah.
[00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:04.920]   Just natedodson.com.
[00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:07.080]   I just started developing that.
[00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:08.360]   I'll put links to all my stuff.
[00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:12.840]   I have a bunch of stores and getting ready to release a new product here in a month that
[00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:15.680]   I think could really change lives.
[00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:18.960]   It's like a journal that you'll get in the mail every month that has, you've got to say
[00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:23.000]   one thing you're grateful for, and you can identify your most important activity, a couple
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.960]   more tasks, and then just kind of do a brain dump every morning.
[00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:28.960]   It'll come in your mailbox every month for a really low price.
[00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:30.200]   I'm getting ready to release that.
[00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:31.920]   I'm pretty excited about that.
[00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:35.120]   So, yeah, natedodson.com.
[00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:42.760]   Maybe I'll put a special link, like, let me see, maybe natedodson.com/josh.
