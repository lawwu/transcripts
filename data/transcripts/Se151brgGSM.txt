[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.440]   [Silence]
[00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:06.440]   If for instance, you're somebody who falls asleep just fine,
[00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.140]   but wakes up in the middle of the night,
[00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:11.440]   around two or 3 a.m. or any time for that matter,
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.680]   and has trouble falling back asleep,
[00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.400]   there are two categories of supplements
[00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.240]   that you might want to consider.
[00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.080]   The first is myoinositol,
[00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.040]   typically taken as 900 milligrams of myoinositol.
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.280]   Myoinositol can help shorten the amount of time
[00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.280]   that it takes to fall back asleep
[00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.000]   if you wake up in the middle of the night.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.440]   Myoinositol has other beneficial uses as well
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:32.960]   for mood, et cetera.
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.440]   If you'd like to see many of the different effects
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.200]   that have been explored in the scientific literature
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.520]   for myoinositol, you can go to examine.com.
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.240]   It's an excellent site, not just for inositol,
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.480]   but for all supplements for that matter.
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.540]   Talks about the human effect matrix.
[00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:47.880]   That is the different effects
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.560]   of different supplement compounds
[00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.380]   on different aspects of hormone, brain, and body health,
[00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.720]   where the evidence is strong, where the evidence is weak,
[00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.160]   has links to studies, and so on.
[00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.360]   Again, it's examine.com, amazing website, wonderful website.
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.480]   It's provided such a rich resource for me
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.400]   and for many, many other people.
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.320]   Other people who wake up in the middle of the night
[00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.560]   will wake up because their dreams are very intense,
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.240]   or they were having dreams that were so vivid
[00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.560]   that suddenly they were jolted from their dreams.
[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.440]   Those people would do well to avoid certain supplements.
[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.360]   So in a moment, I'll talk about the value
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.580]   of a supplement called theanine for falling asleep.
[00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.080]   But theanine, which typically is taken in dosages
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.600]   anywhere from 100 milligrams to 400 milligrams,
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.720]   depending on body weight and experience
[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.900]   and what you find to be most effective for you,
[00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.280]   minimally effective for you.
[00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.200]   Well, theanine can be great for many people,
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.000]   but for people who have excessively vivid dreams,
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.520]   those excessively vivid dreams can lead to immediate waking
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.080]   and sometimes a little bit of anxiety
[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.800]   upon waking in the middle of the night.
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.260]   So some people who wake up in the middle of the night,
[00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.520]   so jolted mentally and physically out of sleep
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.160]   because of their intense dreams
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.680]   would do well to avoid theanine supplementation.
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.200]   I've talked about this a bit before,
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.240]   but it's something that I think a lot of nighttime,
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.920]   middle of the night wakers might be familiar with
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.360]   and would want to take into consideration.
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.920]   Now, for those of you that are not waking up
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:15.740]   in the middle of the night
[00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.680]   or not having excessively vivid dreams,
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.600]   but are having trouble falling asleep,
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.320]   two supplements in particular have been shown
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.700]   to be effective for shortening the transition time to sleep
[00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.300]   and allowing people to ease into sleep more readily.
[00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.460]   And those are magnesium threonate,
[00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.900]   which is interchangeable with magnesium bisglycinate.
[00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.460]   Magnesium bisglycinate and magnesium threonate
[00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.260]   both have transporter systems
[00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.660]   that allow them to readily cross the blood-brain barrier
[00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.180]   and they lead to a mild form of drowsiness,
[00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.260]   mild in the sense that it's not going to prevent you
[00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.740]   from operating a motor vehicle
[00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.800]   or kind of any conditions under emergency
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.400]   that might arise in the middle of the night,
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.760]   or if they did arise during the middle of night,
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:56.820]   you'd still be able to function,
[00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.420]   so it's not like a sleeping pill.
[00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.680]   But people who take those often find
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.160]   that their transition time into sleep is much faster
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.600]   and their sleep is also much deeper.
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.640]   Incidentally, those supplements are also thought
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.320]   to be useful for cognitive support and neuroprotection,
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.640]   although there's less data on that.
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.020]   Okay, so that's for falling asleep, that's one category,
[00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.880]   either magnesium, magnesium threonate, or bisglycinate
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.160]   would be interchangeable
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.440]   for assisting the transition time into sleep.
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.720]   And then the other supplement is apigenin, A-P-I-G-E-N-I-N.
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.720]   Apigenin, which is a derivative of chamomile,
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.020]   I've talked about this in various podcasts before,
[00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:36.480]   also acts as a bit of a anxiety-lowering compound,
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.020]   which is essential prior to sleep
[00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.800]   for people to essentially turn off their thinking
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.780]   or to be able to reduce the amount of ruminating
[00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.820]   and problem-solving and future anticipation
[00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:45.660]   that they're doing,
[00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.580]   which is a requirement for falling asleep.
[00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.000]   So what's the rational approach to supplementing
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.980]   in a way that allows you to fall asleep more quickly
[00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:54.820]   and stay asleep?
[00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.080]   Well, would you immediately take magnesium threonate
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.380]   and apigenin together?
[00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:00.220]   Well, that depends.
[00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:01.040]   If you have the budget
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.940]   and you just simply want to fall asleep quicker
[00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.660]   and you don't care which of those two ingredients
[00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.300]   is going to be more effective for you,
[00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:07.920]   well, then you could try one,
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.660]   for instance, magnesium threonate,
[00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.020]   and try it for perhaps a week
[00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.380]   and see how that affects your latency to sleep time,
[00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:15.900]   that is how quickly you fall asleep,
[00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.820]   or you could try apigenin in the first week,
[00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.340]   or you could combine them both,
[00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.000]   or you could try magnesium threonate for a week,
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.740]   then switch to only apigenin for a week
[00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.300]   and evaluate which one works better for you.
[00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.300]   If neither works for you,
[00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.740]   I do recommend trying the combination together.
[00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.180]   Again, this is just the way that any scientist
[00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.400]   would design an experiment
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.820]   to try and understand which variables,
[00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.500]   that is, which ingredients are most effective
[00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.020]   for the result that you want,
[00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.660]   as opposed to just lumping them together and taking them.
[00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:48.660]   That said, a lot of people want excellent sleep so badly
[00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:49.500]   that they just say,
[00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.060]   "Okay, I'm just going to take magnesium threonate,
[00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.140]   I'm going to take apigenin, I'm going to take theanine.
[00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:54.260]   If my dreams are too vivid
[00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:55.740]   and I'm waking up in the middle of the night
[00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.660]   from excessively vivid dreams, I'll drop the theanine."
[00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:00.880]   And many people actually derive great benefit
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:01.940]   from that approach.
[00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.020]   But because today we're talking
[00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:04.620]   about the most rational, cost-effective,
[00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.460]   and biologically effective approach to supplementation,
[00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.540]   if you're not sleeping as well as you would like to,
[00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.660]   or if you want to explore what sleeping
[00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:16.220]   even more deeply might do for your mental health,
[00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:17.620]   physical health, and performance,
[00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.340]   well, then it makes sense to think about
[00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.740]   the various supplements for falling asleep
[00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.340]   versus remaining asleep,
[00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:26.180]   what to include, what not to include,
[00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:27.540]   and to do that systematically.
[00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:30.420]   And again, I think one week's time of taking something,
[00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:34.860]   provided it doesn't induce any negative effects, right?
[00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:36.660]   If something induces a negative effect,
[00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:39.060]   I recommend ceasing taking it immediately.
[00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:41.580]   But if something does not produce any negative effects,
[00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.340]   then I think you want to try a single ingredient formulation
[00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:47.420]   for about a week while not varying anything else,
[00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:51.100]   not changing anything else in your overall protocols
[00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.220]   of nutrition or supplementation.
[00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.740]   I mean, it's impossible to clamp everything perfectly
[00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:56.580]   from week to week,
[00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.740]   but don't change anything else dramatically
[00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:01.460]   and just add that supplement for a given week,
[00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:03.500]   see how it benefits your sleep.
[00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.980]   Maybe add in a second supplement if you like,
[00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:09.540]   or rather swap and try a different supplement for a week
[00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:11.220]   and then see what works best
[00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.460]   and see if the combination works even better.
[00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.040]   [upbeat music]
[00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.620]   [upbeat music]
[00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.200]   (upbeat music)
