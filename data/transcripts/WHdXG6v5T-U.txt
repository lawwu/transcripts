[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:11.120]   All right, so about a month ago, I was let go from my job.
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.200]   It took me a little, a few days to kind of gather
[00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.880]   my marbles a little bit in my head
[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.120]   and figure out what's next.
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.320]   So what I first did was I made a decision
[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.440]   that I'm gonna embrace my vulnerability a little bit
[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.480]   and I'm gonna post something on LinkedIn.
[00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.720]   I finally come to terms with it.
[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:28.600]   Took me about a month.
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.160]   I did a post and kind of helping people understand
[00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.760]   I'm unemployed, here's where I am in the process,
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.200]   here are the top jobs or skills or functions
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.880]   that I'm looking for that I would love to do
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.280]   and I kind of help people understand
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.600]   if I'm in it for a leadership role
[00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.520]   or a individual contributor.
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.960]   Again, helping my network understand specifically
[00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.200]   what I'm looking for and so they're better positioned
[00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.800]   to help me find something or connect me with someone.
[00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.480]   What was really cool was how many people
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.480]   responded to that post and to me it was a real lesson
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:11.040]   about how to utilize LinkedIn as a social media platform
[00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.640]   for careers and professionals and you'd think
[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.400]   I would know that since I used to work at LinkedIn
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.780]   but beyond this side of it, it really hit home.
[00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:25.600]   So that post got almost 125,000 impressions
[00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.960]   99 comments of which half of them were probably mine
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.960]   thanking people for their nice messages
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.960]   and then 23 were reposts and the majority of the reposts
[00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.280]   were not people directly in my network.
[00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.240]   Think about that, that's crazy.
[00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.480]   People see my post, they genuinely want to help out,
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.720]   a lot of people in a similar situation
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.640]   are unemployed as well and we're just trying
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.080]   to lift each other up and damn it
[00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.300]   if that wasn't just emotional for me.
[00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:57.700]   It was really, really cool
[00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:03.300]   and so I wanted to respond in kind.
[00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.940]   - Hey guys, right now the job market is tough
[00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.340]   especially for those of us in high tech.
[00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.660]   At the time of this recording,
[00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.700]   I'm also unemployed and I'm job seeking.
[00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.660]   Now recently I did a post on LinkedIn
[00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.020]   about my unemployment journey and I have been so moved
[00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.700]   and overwhelmed by the support
[00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.500]   of this wonderful LinkedIn community.
[00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.220]   It's compelled me to want to give back
[00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.340]   in a way that I'm most passionate about
[00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.700]   and that's through career coaching.
[00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.500]   Now just to be clear, I'm not a licensed coach
[00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.700]   nor am I a TED Talk speaker, far from it.
[00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.420]   I'm just someone who genuinely cares
[00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.500]   about the career advancement of my peers
[00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.220]   and I have successfully mentored people
[00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.420]   throughout my 20 year career in marketing.
[00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.460]   I'm going to make the most obvious statement of the day,
[00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.740]   the one that is most easily forgotten.
[00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:53.860]   Whether it's in our personal lives or career,
[00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.900]   we want to feel a sense of purpose,
[00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.780]   a sense of accomplishment.
[00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.540]   And that can be measured in a lot of ways
[00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.580]   but I believe that feeling valued
[00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.020]   and experiencing true joy and satisfaction
[00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.820]   are key indicators of having achieved your purpose.
[00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.500]   Now how often have you been at a job
[00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.260]   where you're just not happy?
[00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.660]   You can't pinpoint why but someone will say
[00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.820]   or do something that just triggers you
[00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.180]   and now you're just left picking up the pieces
[00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.060]   and wondering what happened?
[00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:24.740]   Or maybe there's a promotion
[00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:26.940]   that you've been striving to get.
[00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.460]   Three years pass and all you have to show for it
[00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.900]   is the same job title and now you feel like
[00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.260]   you haven't made the progress on your career at all
[00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.740]   and you've just wasted time.
[00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:40.220]   I want to help you break that cycle
[00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.220]   and introduce more predictability
[00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.620]   and accountability into your career.
[00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.140]   In our coaching session, my first goal
[00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.220]   is to help you rediscover things that truly give you joy
[00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.460]   and help you articulate your core values.
[00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:58.660]   Essentially, I want to reconnect you with you
[00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.460]   so you can be your true authentic self at work
[00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:04.900]   or help influence your environment so that you can thrive.
[00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.940]   Then secondly, we'll talk about what jobs
[00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.220]   or responsibilities you're interested in
[00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.420]   and map out the skills development roadmap
[00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:13.500]   to help you get there.
[00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.180]   If you're interested in meeting with me,
[00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.460]   I can probably handle a maximum of one session per day
[00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:22.340]   since I'm not doing this full time.
[00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.020]   So please express your interest in the comments below
[00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.020]   and I'll reach out to coordinate something.
[00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.540]   Now, if we don't connect and someone beats me to it,
[00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.420]   that's fantastic 'cause we're all in this together.
[00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.180]   My only ask is that when we meet,
[00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.100]   bring your true self.
[00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:42.500]   Come casual, I'll probably be wearing sweatpants,
[00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.460]   but do bring a spreadsheet so I can leave you
[00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.740]   with something tangible that you can reference
[00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.460]   for the rest of your life.
[00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.060]   Thanks guys and good luck and happy job hunting.
[00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.140]   - The response to that was also overwhelming
[00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:59.220]   and I get kind of emotional thinking about it.
[00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:05.700]   It made me realize how desperate we all are in this time
[00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:11.420]   and how more than ever we need to help each other
[00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:16.020]   'cause the world doesn't have to be broken.
[00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:19.500]   This unemployment situation, yes it's market driven,
[00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.820]   but we as people, I believe we can do something about it.
[00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:27.660]   When I was talking to these people,
[00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.180]   some of them were directly in my network,
[00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.580]   some of them were not, there was a unifying theme.
[00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:36.140]   Aside of the fears of financial stability,
[00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:38.180]   that's a very real one by the way, right?
[00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:39.940]   If you're a single income earner,
[00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.860]   if you have health issues, you depend on insurance,
[00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.860]   maybe aging parents, that was definitely
[00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.700]   a top of mind one for everybody.
[00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:51.420]   But that aside, the thing I didn't realize
[00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:56.420]   is a fear of change, meaning you've been doing
[00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:01.780]   the same job, function, role for 15 years,
[00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:05.020]   10 years, even five and it's kind of your bread and butter
[00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:09.300]   and maybe it's time to make a change.
[00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:12.660]   But changing fields is scary and that's when I decided
[00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:14.740]   to do this podcast.
[00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:21.220]   My goal is to help people find a job,
[00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:25.820]   whether it's in their existing field or a different field,
[00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:30.620]   by providing them with just true practical advice
[00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:35.620]   and insight about a role and the skills needed to qualify.
[00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:41.340]   And I would wanna do this by leveraging my network
[00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:44.260]   of people who are actually doing the work today
[00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.660]   and having a really practical
[00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:51.100]   and transparent, tangible conversation.
[00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:53.300]   And I wanted people to understand exactly
[00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:55.900]   what a job is all about, what hiring managers
[00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:59.420]   are really looking for beyond the job description
[00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:03.020]   and how you can start equipping yourself to do that.
[00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:04.620]   I'm thinking about people who are graduating
[00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:06.340]   from college right now, like they may not know
[00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:07.700]   what's all available to them and maybe they say,
[00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:10.540]   "Hey, I've always wanted to try a career in comms."
[00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:13.900]   Okay, well, did you realize comms has eight different roles
[00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:16.540]   within it, internal, external, crisis comms, legal,
[00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:18.060]   whatever it is, right?
[00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:19.580]   It's a lot broader than you realize
[00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:22.260]   and maybe it'll help inspire them to study something
[00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:26.060]   in school or land somewhere else or leverage their network
[00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:27.700]   to maybe find something specific
[00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:29.500]   now that they know their options.
[00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:31.380]   So that's what I'm gonna try to do.
[00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:32.580]   All right, so let's see where this goes.
[00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:33.420]   Wish me luck.
[00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:43.420]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
