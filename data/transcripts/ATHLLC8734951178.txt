[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.280]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.000]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.320]   Now, today I wanted to try something a little different.
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.760]   In the past week, I've had a couple ideas or musings
[00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.400]   that I thought would be really interesting things
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.040]   to share on the podcast,
[00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.520]   but none of them really leveled up
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.520]   to an entire episode on their own,
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.200]   and they weren't really questions from you guys
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.300]   or hacks to share,
[00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.620]   so they didn't quite fit in the mailbag format.
[00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.800]   So I thought, why not just record them
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:27.760]   and put them out there?
[00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:28.960]   And originally I thought this might be
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.440]   a 10 or 15 minute episode,
[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:31.840]   and I was gonna release it on Monday
[00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.700]   and just call it Monday's Musings.
[00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.740]   But then as I got to going,
[00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:36.800]   I realized there was a lot more I wanted to share,
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.080]   and it really filled up an entire episode.
[00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.560]   And so I decided I'm gonna release it on a normal day,
[00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.840]   and I'm just gonna share some of these things on my mind,
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.880]   'cause there's a lot of lessons and hacks and learnings
[00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.020]   that I thought would be really valuable
[00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.080]   for everyone to hear.
[00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.040]   But I definitely, definitely, definitely
[00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.200]   want your feedback.
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.080]   I'd love to know if you think this is a format
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.080]   I should keep doing,
[00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.440]   or if maybe I should keep doing,
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.860]   but keep it to another day of the week
[00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.580]   so Wednesdays are different.
[00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:59.920]   Whatever your feedback is,
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.240]   please send me a message,
[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.000]   podcast@allthehacks.com.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.600]   I would really love to hear from you.
[00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.000]   You can also reach out to me on social
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.040]   or find me anywhere,
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.400]   because if this is interesting,
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.640]   I'd love to keep it going.
[00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.380]   If not, I can keep the Musings to myself.
[00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:13.600]   And if you're new here,
[00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.820]   first off, this is obviously not a typical episode,
[00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.000]   so don't judge that.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.560]   And second, I normally cover a lot of topics
[00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.040]   about travel, points, miles, investing, personal finance.
[00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.640]   And in the last couple episodes,
[00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.600]   including the next one,
[00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.360]   which will actually be about France
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.640]   and a complete travel guide to the country,
[00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.280]   there's a little deviation from the standard.
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.760]   And that's 'cause I just like to make sure
[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.600]   this show is not only focused on one thing,
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.280]   because I think we all like to optimize
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.600]   different areas of our lives
[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.040]   and learn lots of things
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.520]   and don't wanna go too far down one path.
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.800]   So if you're coming here for content
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.320]   on travel, points, or miles,
[00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.320]   and you haven't heard it,
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.600]   or you wanna hear more about money and investing,
[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.440]   and it hasn't been in the last few episodes,
[00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.360]   don't worry, that stuff is coming.
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.800]   Stay subscribed.
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:54.960]   And if you have any thoughts
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.440]   on other things you wanna hear me cover or talk about,
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.160]   or guests you wanna hear on the podcast,
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.400]   shoot me a note, podcast@allthehacks.com.
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.000]   Okay, so what are today's musings about?
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.400]   I'll give you a quick overview.
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.240]   First, I wanna talk about a last-minute trip
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.360]   that Amy and I are planning
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.040]   and how some of the rules of maximizing your points
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.080]   for last-minute travel might not be what they used to be.
[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.680]   I also wanna come back to the point-optimizing spreadsheet
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.760]   I talked about in the last Q&A episode,
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.240]   because I've made a few tweaks with it
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.720]   and I'm finally ready to share it with you.
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.440]   I wanna share a story about optimization
[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.600]   going a little bit overboard and wrong
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.280]   and just being a complete waste of time
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.640]   that you can all hopefully learn from my mistake.
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:32.520]   I wanna talk a little bit
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.480]   about these automated bedtime stories
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.200]   that I created for my daughter with ChatGPT,
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.440]   which I thought was a really cool, fun thing.
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.280]   I'll talk a little bit
[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.320]   about the elusive perfect 850 credit score.
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.140]   I wanna share a sticky healthcare situation
[00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.000]   I found myself in that almost cost me a few thousand dollars
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.220]   and I'm gonna give an update
[00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.360]   on the first All The Hacks trip we're gonna take,
[00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.280]   and this is to Iceland next year,
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.480]   and I have a really special, exciting announcement
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.920]   I've been wanting to tell you all that I will end with,
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.000]   so let's jump in right after this.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.280]   Did you know that some common symptoms
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.640]   of electrolyte deficiency include headaches,
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.280]   muscle cramps, fatigue, and sleeplessness?
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.200]   I feel like I'm late to the electrolyte game,
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.700]   but after getting pretty dehydrated earlier this year
[00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.760]   and discovering Element, I am fully on board.
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.000]   Element is an electrolyte drink mix that tastes great
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.800]   and has everything you need and nothing you don't.
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.920]   That means lots of salt with no sugar,
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.840]   and I'm so excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.000]   Honestly, I can't believe I never realized
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.280]   how important it can be to replenish electrolytes,
[00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.140]   whether that's after having a few cocktails,
[00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.000]   working out, not feeling well,
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.400]   or just to keep up with an active lifestyle.
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.340]   And when it comes to how you get those electrolytes,
[00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.120]   Element was an easy choice for me
[00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.040]   because there's no sugar, no coloring,
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.960]   no artificial ingredients or fillers,
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.680]   and on top of that, it tastes so good.
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.040]   My personal favorite is the lemon habanero,
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.120]   and Amy's is watermelon.
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.040]   Element is used by everyone from Olympic athletes
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.720]   to exercise enthusiasts to everyday parents
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.760]   and even podcast hosts like me.
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.360]   And if you're not sure if it's for you,
[00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.120]   don't worry because Element offers no questions asked refunds
[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.200]   so you can try it totally risk-free.
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.840]   And right now, Element is offering a free sample pack
[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.140]   with any purchase.
[00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:13.880]   That's eight single-serving packets
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.860]   free with any Element order.
[00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.280]   This is a great way to try all eight flavors
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.640]   or share Element with a salty friend.
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:25.360]   Get yours at allthehacks.com/element, that's L-M-N-T.
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.360]   This deal is only available through my link.
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.360]   You must go to allthehacks.com/element, that's L-M-N-T.
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.160]   (upbeat music)
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.880]   First, I wanna talk about a trip
[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.120]   that Amy and I are planning.
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.920]   So my parents have really graciously offered
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.160]   to come and watch our girls for five, six, seven days
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.600]   with the help of our au pair under the only stipulation
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.560]   that we find someone else to watch the dog
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.040]   so they don't have two young kids and a dog.
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.560]   And they're talking about coming in two weeks.
[00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.640]   Now we've known about this for about six or seven weeks.
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:03.120]   And because points availability often opens up so much
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.160]   in the last two weeks, we said, you know what?
[00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.040]   We're not even gonna figure out where we're going
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.580]   until two weeks out
[00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.600]   because we know that it'll be so much easier.
[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:11.520]   At least historically,
[00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.900]   it's been so much easier to find availability.
[00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.980]   So we talked about high level what we wanted to do
[00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:18.820]   and set some requirements.
[00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.420]   We said, we don't wanna spend a six day trip
[00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:23.680]   flying for 27 hours each way.
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.640]   So as much as we've always thought it'd be amazing
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.540]   to go to places like the Maldives,
[00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:30.100]   it's just not in the cards for a six day trip.
[00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:32.140]   And so we said, we've gotta go somewhere
[00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:34.680]   where we can get there in less than 12 hours.
[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.460]   And that includes any plane changes.
[00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:39.740]   So we're like 12 hours is our max.
[00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:41.300]   And we wanna go somewhere
[00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.180]   that we can't just go for a weekend
[00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:45.220]   because if we can go there for a weekend,
[00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:46.980]   we could probably go there another time easily.
[00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:50.300]   So it kind of is like outside North America,
[00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:53.680]   but less than 12 hours away, maybe including the Caribbean.
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.940]   And we wanted to relax a bit, right?
[00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:58.680]   This is a time to be away from kids
[00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.780]   and sleep in as long as you want,
[00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:02.100]   which is probably impossible
[00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:03.660]   because it seems to never happen
[00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:06.800]   anytime I'm away for work or my wife's away for work,
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.180]   but we're gonna try.
[00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.860]   So that leaves a few of the islands in the Pacific,
[00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:15.220]   that leaves the Caribbean, leave Central America,
[00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:20.180]   maybe even Korea, Japan, but it's July and it can get hot.
[00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:21.980]   And Europe, there are a lot of places in Europe
[00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:23.460]   that you can get to in less than 12 hours
[00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:26.380]   if you fly nonstop from the West Coast.
[00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:28.380]   So we kind of were holding out,
[00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:30.960]   which I think is a little anxiety inducing
[00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.120]   because they're all different kinds of trips
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.600]   and there's lots of stuff to figure out.
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:38.240]   And Amy and I, sometimes we love looking forward to a trip.
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.460]   Oh, what are we gonna do?
[00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:41.200]   But if you're not sure whether you're gonna be
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:44.540]   on an island in the South Pacific or on a city in Europe,
[00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:47.300]   it's really hard to really kind of viscerally feel
[00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:48.460]   that upcoming trip.
[00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:50.760]   But we also had a lot of stuff going on.
[00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:52.520]   So we said, you know what, we'll just wait.
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.460]   Well, we're now about two weeks away.
[00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:56.100]   I started looking at flights
[00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:59.060]   and the good news is it's opened up a little bit more.
[00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:02.020]   Two weeks ago, I looked briefly and there was just nothing.
[00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:05.700]   There was almost no availability nonstop out of SFO.
[00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:08.000]   And so first off, I'll share how I was doing this searching
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.700]   because I think there are a lot of us
[00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:12.040]   that have a lot of points and maybe we come to a time
[00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:14.100]   we wanna go somewhere, but we're not sure where
[00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:15.740]   and we want an easy way to search,
[00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:17.900]   but there just aren't great tools
[00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:19.360]   that allow you to do this.
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:20.820]   So I'll share two of them
[00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:23.420]   because I've only really found two of them.
[00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:25.740]   One of them is a site called seats.arrow,
[00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:27.980]   which is seats.a-e-r-o.
[00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:30.020]   And I'll include my referral link in the show notes
[00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:32.780]   or I think it's just allthehacks.com/seatsarrow,
[00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:35.020]   S-E-A-T-S-A-E-R-O.
[00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:37.800]   And it's not the most user-friendly tool,
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:40.080]   but it is very, very powerful
[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.040]   once you kind of understand how it works.
[00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:45.460]   And so the way it works is that they go and index
[00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:48.080]   all of these flights in advance.
[00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:49.380]   So when you're doing your search,
[00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:51.240]   it's very, very easy to find things
[00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:53.280]   because they've already searched all the flights
[00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:55.160]   and they've stored all these routes.
[00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:58.200]   So because of that, they're only searching specific routes,
[00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:00.000]   but it's a lot, a lot of routes.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.100]   Downside is you have to search by airline program.
[00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:04.720]   So you can search by Air Canada
[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:06.960]   and that's gonna show you a lot of Star Alliance flights.
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:09.840]   There's only about 10 different airline programs
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:10.740]   to search for.
[00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:13.520]   But the real magic is that when you're searching,
[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:15.600]   you can filter by a destination,
[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:17.520]   you can filter by an origin,
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:19.720]   and you can filter by an airport,
[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:23.160]   like I wanna go from SFO to Asia.
[00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:24.800]   And it'll filter all the flights there.
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:26.720]   You can say, show me only business class.
[00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:28.840]   And then it's not quite obvious,
[00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:31.520]   but if you start typing in a date in the search field,
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:36.160]   like 2023-07-24,
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:39.140]   you'll filter for only flights on that day.
[00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:41.020]   Now, if you start doing this search,
[00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:43.480]   you'll find out, okay, here's where I can go.
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:45.720]   And we started looking around
[00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:47.740]   and there were a few options that popped up,
[00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:49.080]   some that seemed like the weather
[00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:52.120]   was just absolutely a non-starter or the distance.
[00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:54.240]   For some reason, there seems to be a lot of business
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:56.760]   and first-class availability to Delhi,
[00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:58.360]   but India is just too far
[00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:00.520]   and not the weather we were looking for in July.
[00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:02.800]   But one thing did recently pop up,
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:06.080]   which was we noticed a lot of flights to Papeete,
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:09.880]   which is the airport in Tahiti in French Polynesia.
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:11.080]   Before I continue, I forgot,
[00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:13.280]   there's another tool called Roam,
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:15.040]   which I recently met the founders of
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:16.760]   and I'm really excited about what they're building.
[00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:21.120]   It's Roame.travel, R-O-A-M-E.travel.
[00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:24.280]   And they just launched a feature called Skyview.
[00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:25.400]   And it's a beta product.
[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:27.560]   It's only available as a paid member.
[00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:29.640]   So you're gonna have to pay to check it out.
[00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:31.720]   But it does a similar thing where you can say,
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:33.600]   here, I'm looking for business class.
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:35.120]   I'm looking on these dates.
[00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:36.720]   I'm looking from here.
[00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:40.200]   And you can kind of get very generic on the destination.
[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:42.280]   I'm looking to Europe
[00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:44.840]   and it will just show you all the flights there.
[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:46.880]   You can say how many points you're willing to spend
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:48.380]   and what day you're looking for.
[00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:51.180]   You can even add a plus or minus three days if you want.
[00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:53.520]   So those are two tools that you can use.
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:55.560]   So we found these flights to Papeete.
[00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:57.320]   They actually worked on the exact same days
[00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:58.520]   we were looking for.
[00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:00.120]   And so we felt like we had scored.
[00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:02.400]   Now, we've been to Bora Bora before.
[00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:05.040]   I actually made an entire podcast episode on it
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:06.960]   in March last year.
[00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:10.000]   So yes, we've been there, but boy, is it amazing.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.400]   We've actually been there twice.
[00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:13.320]   It's such an incredible place.
[00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:15.240]   Eight hour flight to French Polynesia
[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:17.040]   from San Francisco nonstop.
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:19.900]   So surprisingly much easier to get to than the Caribbean,
[00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:21.400]   which for some islands,
[00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:23.840]   I couldn't find anything under 12 hours.
[00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:27.600]   Then I looked at hotels and all the points hotels
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:30.840]   were either completely sold out at the St. Regis,
[00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:33.120]   the Meridian, some of the Intercontinentals,
[00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:35.960]   or just an egregious number of points.
[00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:38.480]   Now, I actually looked two or three weeks ago
[00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:40.240]   at the Conrad in Bora Bora,
[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:42.880]   where we stayed four or five years ago.
[00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:45.240]   And two or three weeks ago,
[00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:46.960]   it seemed like there was some availability.
[00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:48.240]   100,000 points at night,
[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:50.720]   which is enough to use your free night certificates
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:53.580]   if you have any of those from the Hilton Aspire card.
[00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:56.200]   And now it's 850,000 points.
[00:10:56.200 --> 00:11:00.720]   So as much as I often say that waiting till the last minute,
[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:02.460]   you can get some of the best flight deals,
[00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:04.200]   which is absolutely true,
[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:08.800]   because we're talking about 46,000 points each way
[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:11.280]   in business class on United,
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:12.600]   booked through Aeroplan,
[00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:13.960]   as long as you have chase points,
[00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:16.260]   because there's currently a 20% transfer bonus.
[00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.600]   So it's actually 55,000 points each way.
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:19.640]   If you book it with United,
[00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:21.840]   it's over 70,000 points each way.
[00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:23.080]   And then with that transfer bonus,
[00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:26.040]   it goes down to 46,000 or a little less actually.
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:28.880]   And so fantastic deal,
[00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:31.680]   but no availability with hotels.
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:33.440]   And you can spend money.
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:36.000]   And so we thought, oh, let's go back to the Conrad,
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.400]   but at $1,500 a night, it's just not in the cards.
[00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:41.760]   And so we're looking at a few other islands,
[00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:43.880]   seeing if there's still a way to make it work.
[00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:46.160]   By the time you've heard this, maybe we've just committed,
[00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:48.480]   or maybe we've decided let's wait another week
[00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:50.040]   and see if a few things open up.
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:53.280]   I was surprised that in the past at 14 days,
[00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:55.340]   seems like stuff starts to open up,
[00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:59.080]   but right now there's still only a handful of options.
[00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:01.160]   And honestly, on some carriers,
[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:02.800]   there's not really anything.
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:04.800]   I think right now on Star Alliance,
[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:06.800]   other than that flight we found,
[00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:10.400]   it's like Edmonton, Mexico City, Delhi, and Vancouver.
[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:12.780]   We're like the four nonstop flights from San Francisco
[00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:13.960]   we could use points on.
[00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:17.760]   So not the availability I was hoping for.
[00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:19.680]   Now, granted, we're talking peak
[00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:21.640]   summer travel season from America.
[00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:24.280]   So shame on us, but it's the week we have.
[00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:25.760]   So that's all we've got.
[00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:28.000]   But let's see, I'm gonna keep monitoring this.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.140]   I'll probably give an update in a few weeks,
[00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:32.600]   maybe the next mailbag episode on what happened
[00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:35.400]   as we got closer and closer to our destination time,
[00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:38.640]   because I genuinely think it usually gets even better.
[00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:40.880]   Some things like Lufthansa First Class
[00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:43.280]   really only opened up in the last few days.
[00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:45.800]   So we'll see, stay tuned on where we end up.
[00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:48.160]   Maybe we'll get miraculously lucky.
[00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:50.000]   I think we'll be able to get enough good use
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.520]   out of points in Air Canada in the future
[00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:54.640]   that I might just do the transfer now,
[00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:56.480]   book the flights so that we have them,
[00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:58.080]   see what hotels open up.
[00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:00.700]   Worst case, we can cancel and book something else.
[00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:02.380]   Yes, there's a change fee,
[00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:04.060]   but to be able to lock something in,
[00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:06.980]   at least so we have a backup plan, would feel really good.
[00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:08.980]   So the general lesson I wanna share
[00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:11.140]   from this kind of musing is just that,
[00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:13.760]   yes, last minute, things have opened up a lot more
[00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:17.660]   in the last two weeks, but hotels can be a factor.
[00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:19.460]   So if you're looking at a place
[00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:21.380]   that feels like it might be a dream destination,
[00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:23.020]   but there aren't a lot of hotels there,
[00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:24.580]   maybe it's a smaller town,
[00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:27.980]   it might actually be worth booking those hotels earlier.
[00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:31.040]   Especially when hotels are so easy to cancel.
[00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:33.400]   In fact, if I had a destination in mind,
[00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:35.440]   I really wish I had just booked the hotels
[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:36.800]   two, three weeks ago.
[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:38.760]   Worst case, you cancel them, it's not a big deal.
[00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:42.100]   Many hotel rates can be refundable up until the last minute
[00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:43.160]   and then seeing how it works.
[00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:45.640]   So don't forget that if you're going to a major city,
[00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:47.000]   if you're going to London, you're going to Paris,
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.320]   you're probably always gonna be able to find a hotel,
[00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:50.960]   whether it's points or dollars,
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:54.000]   but in some smaller places or off the beaten path,
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   even though you might wait last minute for flights,
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.660]   it might not be the best option.
[00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:02.460]   My fitness routine this year had a few rocky starts,
[00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:04.140]   but I am back into it now.
[00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:06.580]   And honestly, one of the things that helped me get back
[00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:08.820]   is that I just added some new workout gear.
[00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:10.100]   And if I'm gonna buy more,
[00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:12.480]   why not have the best performance apparel out there,
[00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:14.100]   which I think is Viorey,
[00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:15.900]   and I am excited to be partnering with them
[00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:17.140]   for this episode.
[00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:20.340]   Viorey makes performance apparel that's incredibly versatile.
[00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:22.180]   Everything's designed to work out in,
[00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:24.460]   but it doesn't look or feel like it at all.
[00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:26.080]   And it is so freaking comfortable,
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:28.020]   you will wanna wear it all the time.
[00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:29.120]   But it's not just for men.
[00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:32.360]   My wife is obsessed with Viorey as much as I am.
[00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:33.520]   While my personal favorite
[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:35.920]   will probably always be the Sunday Performance Joggers,
[00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:37.440]   I have at least three pairs.
[00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:39.840]   I just got a few pairs of the Core Shorts
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:42.920]   and three or four Strato Tech Tees, and I'm loving them.
[00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:45.560]   Honestly, I can't think of the last time I went on a run,
[00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:47.820]   bike ride, or walk in anything else.
[00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:49.300]   Their products are so versatile.
[00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:51.560]   You can use them for just about any activity,
[00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:53.680]   whether it's running, training, or yoga,
[00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:56.560]   but they're also great for lounging, running around town,
[00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:57.840]   or they even have a few things
[00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:59.520]   you can wear for a night out.
[00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:02.340]   Honestly, I think Viorey is an investment in your happiness.
[00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:03.680]   And for All The Hacks listeners,
[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:06.520]   they're offering 20% off your first purchase,
[00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:11.000]   as well as free shipping and returns on US orders over $75.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.520]   So you should definitely check them out
[00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:14.880]   at allthehacks.com/viorey.
[00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:19.560]   Again, go to allthehacks.com/v-u-o-r-i
[00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:21.560]   and get yourself some of the most comfortable
[00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:23.560]   and versatile clothing on the planet.
[00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:28.000]   It is astonishing how much of our personal information
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.240]   is online, and in the last few months,
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:32.820]   I've been trying to remove as much of Amy
[00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:34.960]   and my info as possible.
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:36.840]   I also did the same for our parents,
[00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:40.960]   and in total, after reviewing over 20,000 listings,
[00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:42.960]   we found over 1,000 pieces
[00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:45.240]   of personally identifiable information.
[00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:47.200]   Thankfully, it's all getting removed,
[00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:49.400]   and instead of spending 50 plus hours
[00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:51.720]   searching and filing requests to do that,
[00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:53.220]   it only took a few minutes,
[00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:55.280]   because I used Delete.me from Avine,
[00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:57.080]   and I am so excited to be partnering
[00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:58.320]   with them for this episode.
[00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:00.120]   Delete.me is an amazing service
[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:03.400]   that will not just find and remove your personal information
[00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:06.200]   from over 500 data broker websites,
[00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:08.560]   but they'll continuously scan for new data
[00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:10.960]   that shows up and get that removed as well.
[00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:12.880]   On average, Delete.me finds and removes
[00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:15.260]   over 2,000 pieces of data for a customer
[00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:16.760]   in their first two years,
[00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:20.240]   and to date, they've removed over 35 million pieces
[00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:21.600]   of data for their customers.
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:23.640]   So if you wanna get your personal information
[00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:26.140]   removed from all these listings on the internet,
[00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:29.200]   go to allthehacks.com/deleteme
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:33.700]   and get 20% off a plan for you or your entire family.
[00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:38.040]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/deleteme.
[00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:39.840]   Now, speaking of points,
[00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:41.660]   next I wanna talk about something I brought up
[00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:43.600]   in last month's mailbag episode.
[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:45.800]   I shared the spreadsheet tool I built
[00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:48.360]   that analyzed a bunch of credit cards
[00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:50.920]   to help you find the best credit card combinations
[00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:53.540]   that you can use to maximize the points you earn.
[00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:54.960]   It goes in and prices out,
[00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:57.200]   here's how many points you earn in all these categories
[00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:59.040]   and what those points are worth.
[00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:01.200]   And after you put in your annual spending,
[00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:04.360]   you can check off one, two, five, 10 different cards
[00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:06.440]   and ultimately see the average number
[00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:07.920]   of points per dollar you'd earn,
[00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:10.380]   assuming you use the right card for each purchase.
[00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:13.000]   And with point valuations that I got from the points guy,
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.420]   you can see the effective dollar value return
[00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:17.120]   you get from that spend as well.
[00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:19.720]   So if you're averaging two chase points per dollar
[00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:21.840]   and the chase point valuation is two cents,
[00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:24.160]   you're actually getting an effective value back
[00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:28.180]   of four cents per dollar or the equivalent of 4% back.
[00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:29.480]   And another use case for that tool
[00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:31.820]   is that if you check off the cards you have,
[00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:34.400]   you can see the incremental value you're gonna get
[00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:37.540]   from adding any other card to your arsenal of cards.
[00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:39.340]   So that tool is precisely how I determine
[00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:42.160]   the best two card combo, which I talked about last time,
[00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:45.560]   at least for someone with the average spending pattern
[00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:48.260]   from the Bureau Labor Statistics data that I used.
[00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:49.660]   And it was the Amex Gold
[00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:51.980]   and the Capital One Venture or Venture X.
[00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:54.740]   And those two cards with that spending profile
[00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:58.180]   earned an average of 2.49 points per dollar
[00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:01.380]   or 4.75 cents per dollar, which is amazing
[00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:03.860]   because I don't know of a combo of cash back cards
[00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:07.180]   that'll get you 4.75% cash back.
[00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:09.180]   Now, obviously, if you spend a lot more in flights,
[00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:11.060]   the platinum might add a lot of value
[00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:13.280]   because you're getting 5X points on flights,
[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:15.380]   but this spreadsheet will let you figure that out.
[00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:17.360]   So I'll pause because I imagine many of you right now
[00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:18.460]   are thinking, "Great, great, Chris,
[00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:20.060]   "thank you for telling me about this tool.
[00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:21.960]   "Can I actually play with it?"
[00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:23.360]   So I've been trying to think about what to do
[00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:26.300]   with all these little projects and tools and databases
[00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:28.400]   that I'm spending a lot of time on,
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:29.720]   and I have a bunch of examples.
[00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:30.880]   This tool is one.
[00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:33.840]   I built an entire Notion site for planning for children.
[00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:36.120]   I have a stroller comparison spreadsheet.
[00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:38.320]   I'm starting to think about writing interesting guides
[00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:40.400]   based on some other research I've done.
[00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:42.220]   And I was thinking what to do with them.
[00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:44.380]   So I mentioned in the mailbag episode
[00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:46.180]   that I was gonna make this tool available to members,
[00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:48.760]   which I did, but what do I do with them broadly?
[00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:50.160]   They take a lot of time.
[00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:52.260]   I really should be valuing my time.
[00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:54.160]   And so I'm gonna start out with an experiment
[00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:55.420]   to try to learn.
[00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:57.260]   I'm gonna make this spreadsheet tool available
[00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:59.220]   for at least the next two weeks
[00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:01.100]   for a pay-as-you-wish download.
[00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:02.520]   So the minimum is $1.
[00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:05.980]   You can pay $1, you can pay $1,000, whatever you want.
[00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:08.580]   And honestly, if you pay $1,000, that's too much.
[00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:09.420]   I'd greatly appreciate it,
[00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:11.220]   but seriously, it's a spreadsheet.
[00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:12.580]   And we'll see what happens.
[00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:15.600]   I really wanna know what value you get from this.
[00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:17.620]   And I'm gonna ask you what you thought.
[00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:19.460]   So if you wanna check this out,
[00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:20.920]   you can go to the link in the show notes
[00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:23.980]   or go to allthehacks.com/cardvalue.
[00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:25.300]   That'll redirect you to a page
[00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:27.840]   where there's a YouTube video that I put together,
[00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:30.300]   which is really just a walkthrough of the entire tool.
[00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:32.100]   So you can get a really good sense of what the tool is,
[00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:33.100]   how it works.
[00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:35.280]   And then I would say, choose whatever you think it's worth
[00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:37.200]   and let me know what you think.
[00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:38.820]   Or if you're an All The Hacks member,
[00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:40.500]   just log into the membership site
[00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:42.980]   and you will be able to get access to the tool for free.
[00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:45.420]   I sent it out to all members a couple of weeks ago
[00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:46.940]   to get some early feedback.
[00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:49.080]   I made a few changes since then.
[00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:50.100]   Know that as a member,
[00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:52.440]   you're always gonna get first access to these products
[00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:53.660]   and all these tools.
[00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:56.060]   And for things like this, they're gonna be free.
[00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:57.500]   So if you'd rather do that,
[00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:02.040]   you could just go to allthehacks.com/join and sign up today.
[00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:05.180]   It'll also give you access to all the member calls we've done,
[00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:07.200]   all the past member emails I've sent,
[00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:08.960]   all the deals we've set up,
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:11.700]   which right now is 50% off card pointers,
[00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:13.340]   50% off trust and will,
[00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:14.820]   40% off trustworthy,
[00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:18.340]   20% off any day and a lot more deals to come.
[00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:21.100]   So again, that's allthehacks.com/join.
[00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:23.140]   But like I said, this is available for anyone
[00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:25.900]   at allthehacks.com/cardvalue.
[00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:27.300]   So hopefully that's helpful
[00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:28.380]   and you can play around with it
[00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:29.820]   with whatever set of cards you have
[00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:31.200]   and let me know what you think.
[00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:32.880]   If there's any other products or tools
[00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:34.780]   you think would be cool to see me build,
[00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:36.060]   let me know as well.
[00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:39.060]   You can always email me, podcast@allthehacks.com.
[00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:40.780]   I get all of those straight to my inbox
[00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:42.420]   and definitely will check them.
[00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:45.060]   Okay, so the next thing I wanna talk about
[00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:47.740]   is a story of optimization gone wrong.
[00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:51.380]   And it all starts back in February, 2021.
[00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:52.500]   We moved into a new house
[00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:54.540]   and we decided we wanted a new couch.
[00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:57.420]   And so we went to Macy's Furniture
[00:20:57.420 --> 00:21:00.300]   and I'm not sure I can recommend it anymore,
[00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:03.020]   but we found this couch, it was on sale.
[00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:05.560]   We got a great deal, it was $800.
[00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:07.940]   And they asked us if we wanted the warranty.
[00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:09.980]   So when you buy furniture at Macy's Furniture,
[00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:11.540]   they have this warranty service
[00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:13.380]   and it's actually called Warranty Service
[00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:14.660]   or maybe that's the name of the app
[00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:16.140]   and it's called Worry No More.
[00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:17.620]   It's quite confusing.
[00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:22.540]   But for $200, we could basically cover the couch
[00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:25.260]   for anything that happens, stains, damage,
[00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:28.260]   as long as it was not malicious damage.
[00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:29.440]   But if it was a pet stain,
[00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:31.300]   if your kid's drawn it with a marker,
[00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:33.980]   they will come out and clean it for you or replace it
[00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:36.080]   if something happens in the next five years.
[00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:38.000]   And if you don't have anything happen
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.400]   at the end of five years and there are no claims,
[00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:43.600]   you get that $200 back as a store credit.
[00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:45.840]   So at the time we had one young kid,
[00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:47.240]   we were planning on another young kid.
[00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:50.400]   Now we have two, definitely seemed like a good deal.
[00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:53.520]   So sure enough, about 18 months later in November,
[00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:55.480]   we realized that our dog
[00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:57.560]   who we no longer let stay on the couch
[00:21:57.560 --> 00:21:58.400]   was sitting on the couch.
[00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:00.740]   It was a white couch and it just was like,
[00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:03.500]   it wasn't hair as much as it was just like a dark spot
[00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:05.160]   from the dog being there a lot.
[00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:06.940]   So we call up the warranty service,
[00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:08.560]   we fire off a request and say,
[00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:10.080]   "Hey, we want to get this cleaned."
[00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:12.840]   They come out and they try to clean the couch
[00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:15.060]   and they do get the stain off,
[00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:18.420]   but it turns out they left a whole stain somewhere else.
[00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:21.120]   And a fun hack here that the cleaner told me
[00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:23.520]   was there are some couches that,
[00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:26.520]   especially a white couch, kind of fabric couch,
[00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:28.640]   where water leaves a stain.
[00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:30.560]   And so what you need to do when you're cleaning it
[00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:32.460]   is not just clean the stain,
[00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:35.640]   but you also need to vacuum out all the moisture,
[00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:37.940]   otherwise it will leave another stain.
[00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:40.440]   So this person came out, they did that,
[00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:43.040]   but they didn't realize that they left some stains
[00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:44.720]   on other parts of the couch.
[00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:47.200]   Maybe they didn't vacuum out everything, I don't know.
[00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:48.640]   And so we immediately followed up and said,
[00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:51.440]   "Hey, you guys cleaned the stain you came for,
[00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:53.520]   "but you created other stains, can you come fix it?"
[00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:54.760]   No response.
[00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:57.200]   We tried two or three times, got nothing.
[00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:58.880]   It was very frustrating.
[00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:01.440]   We called, they said they'd get back to us, they didn't.
[00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:02.740]   And we kind of forgot about it
[00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:05.060]   and just lived with this stain on the couch.
[00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:06.500]   Finally, a couple of months ago in April,
[00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:10.160]   I had just brought on a new EA or executive assistant,
[00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:12.280]   virtual assistant that I hired,
[00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:13.520]   which I've talked about in the past
[00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:17.120]   through a service called Oceans, oceansxyz.com.
[00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:18.680]   It's actually been so fantastic
[00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:20.980]   that I'm gonna do a whole episode on it in a few weeks.
[00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:24.260]   But I said, "Maybe she'll have better luck than me."
[00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:26.540]   And sure enough, she managed to get them
[00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:29.800]   to send someone out who came out and looked at the couch
[00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:31.840]   and said, "Hey, to really do a good job here,
[00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:34.720]   "we're going to have to clean the whole thing,
[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:37.080]   "not just the stained areas, so it all matches."
[00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:38.560]   And we said, "Okay, fine."
[00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:39.900]   Person said, "But I can't do that now.
[00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:41.660]   "I've only been authorized to do a spot treat.
[00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:43.420]   "I don't wanna get in trouble from my boss
[00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:45.340]   "doing more work than I'm supposed to do,
[00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:46.920]   "but I can come out next week."
[00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:47.760]   Great.
[00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:50.640]   Person goes home, two days later we get an email that says,
[00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:52.840]   "We will not be covering this damage
[00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:57.200]   "because the damage is repeated damage of the same type,"
[00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:58.020]   or something like that.
[00:23:58.020 --> 00:23:59.640]   And I said, "No, of course not.
[00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:00.600]   "That's not even true.
[00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:01.940]   "This is in a different place
[00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:03.680]   "and it's a different type of stain
[00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:05.720]   "and it was caused by your team."
[00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:07.960]   So we call up, we state that case,
[00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:09.240]   they say there's nothing they can do.
[00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:11.120]   We email, they say there's nothing to do.
[00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:13.880]   I asked for a supervisor and finally someone comes back
[00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:16.440]   and says, "Okay, well, you can file a dispute
[00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:19.700]   "to a third party kind of team in the company
[00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:21.300]   "and they'll review it."
[00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:23.700]   So I write up this dispute, I create a Google doc,
[00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:26.300]   I put in all these images explaining how obviously
[00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:27.960]   this is not the same stain.
[00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:29.480]   And 24 hours later, I get a message
[00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:31.940]   that's the exact same one we got before that said,
[00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:34.280]   "We don't cover repeated damage of the same type."
[00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:36.520]   And I was like, I was losing my mind.
[00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:39.640]   I called, I talked to a supervisor, I stated the case.
[00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:43.080]   They said they'd get back to us in 24 hours, nothing.
[00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:46.900]   A week later, my wife, whose phone number is on the claims
[00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:49.800]   and was the original purchaser, gets a voicemail
[00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:51.160]   and someone said, "I'm so sorry.
[00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:53.620]   "I don't know how our team managed to process this
[00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:56.000]   "in this way, but I took a look at everything
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.800]   "and I wanted to take care of you guys.
[00:24:57.800 --> 00:24:59.020]   "You get two options.
[00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:02.520]   "We can send you $337 or we can replace the couch
[00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:03.720]   "with a brand new one."
[00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:06.880]   So now we're like, okay, but we don't want this couch again.
[00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:08.880]   This couch stains really easily.
[00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:10.240]   Can we just get a different couch,
[00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:11.880]   a store credit or something?
[00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:13.860]   And they said, "Well, that's in Macy's hands.
[00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:16.220]   "We file the claim, Macy's will tell you what to do.
[00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:17.060]   "We have no luck.
[00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:18.320]   "We call Macy's, we don't get a good answer.
[00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:21.260]   "So we just drive 20 minutes to Macy's Furniture.
[00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:22.320]   "We talked to the rep."
[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:23.500]   Yes, this is a long story,
[00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:25.440]   but I think there's a moral at the end.
[00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:27.400]   "We talked to the rep at the Macy's Furniture store.
[00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:30.000]   "He explains that it's TBD
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.540]   "on whether they'll replace this couch or not.
[00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:34.080]   "We won't know till they file the claim
[00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:35.000]   "whether they force us to,
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.020]   "but because it was a custom fabric, they probably won't.
[00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:39.700]   "But it's also gotten more expensive.
[00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:41.800]   "So we might have to pay the Delta."
[00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:43.880]   And we were just like, this is crazy.
[00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:47.400]   So we go home that day and all I can think about
[00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:48.660]   is how easy it would have been
[00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:50.680]   for someone to just clean this stain.
[00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:51.520]   And so I say, you know what?
[00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:53.400]   Before we decide what we're gonna do,
[00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:54.880]   I'm just gonna try to clean the stain
[00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:56.320]   and I'm gonna go get our shop vac
[00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:57.840]   and I'm gonna vacuum out the moisture,
[00:25:57.840 --> 00:25:59.920]   do it just like the guy did the first time.
[00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:02.440]   Well, 30 minutes later using the cleaning kit
[00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:04.120]   that came with the couch,
[00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:05.400]   all the stains that were there
[00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:06.840]   that the guy created are gone.
[00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:09.400]   And I think there was a part of us
[00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:13.200]   that just was so angry that they would come out
[00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:15.960]   and leave a stain and not be willing to clean it
[00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:18.020]   that we put all of our time and energy
[00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:20.200]   to fighting this situation.
[00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:23.600]   And hours on the phone, writing emails,
[00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:25.880]   driving to Macy's, waiting to speak to the guy
[00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:28.000]   who worked there because there was only one employee
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.200]   at the time.
[00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:32.840]   And all of it was to get the satisfaction
[00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:35.860]   of them taking responsibility for this problem.
[00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:38.960]   But at the end of the day, for 30 minutes of time,
[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:42.520]   we got rid of the stain and the couch looks like
[00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:43.660]   we would have wanted it to look
[00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:45.300]   if someone came out and cleaned it.
[00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:49.200]   And it's a little crazy for me to process the fact
[00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:50.920]   that we wasted so much time.
[00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:54.140]   We immediately took the $337 offer,
[00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:56.840]   which I guess we paid $200 for warranty.
[00:26:56.840 --> 00:27:00.240]   We got 337 back, so we made $137,
[00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:03.240]   but we probably spent five to seven hours of time on this.
[00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:05.080]   So absolutely not worth it.
[00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:07.120]   And what we should have done in the first place
[00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:09.520]   is just clean the stain.
[00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:11.600]   And I did, to be fair, the first time,
[00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:14.640]   I didn't know why when I tried to clean the first stain,
[00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:15.920]   it didn't come out easily.
[00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:18.260]   And the answer was we needed to vacuum out the moisture
[00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:20.520]   or we'd have all these residual water stains.
[00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:21.960]   But once I learned that,
[00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:24.240]   instead of trying to milk the system,
[00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:26.260]   at least once things weren't working,
[00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:28.500]   I should have given up and just done it myself,
[00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:29.900]   or at least tried.
[00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:31.620]   And if it didn't work, sure,
[00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:34.180]   I could continue fighting and maybe get a replacement.
[00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:35.660]   But I just wanted to share it
[00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:37.340]   because I think there are probably some of you out there
[00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:40.060]   who have the same instinct of fighting something
[00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:42.220]   to save money, to get money back,
[00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:43.900]   to make sure you get that deal.
[00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:47.260]   And I think sometimes you want to pause and say,
[00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:49.400]   yes, I want to rectify this situation.
[00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:50.980]   Yes, I want to get what's right.
[00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:53.380]   But if I'm going to spend five hours of my life
[00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:55.120]   to save a hundred bucks
[00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:58.780]   when I could just spend 30 minutes and get the same outcome,
[00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:00.460]   maybe that's not worth it.
[00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:03.060]   And so hopefully that helps you make that decision
[00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:04.340]   on your own the next time
[00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:06.080]   and save yourself a lot of hassle.
[00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:08.460]   Okay, the next interesting thing I want to share
[00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:11.500]   is something fun for anyone who has kids,
[00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:13.480]   maybe cousins, nephews.
[00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:17.740]   My daughter loves random stories at bedtime.
[00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:18.580]   Every time she's like,
[00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:20.460]   "Tell me a story about animals and food."
[00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:23.020]   And she picks a random animal and a random food
[00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:24.860]   and she wants to hear a story about it.
[00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:27.340]   And sometimes she adds details about where they're going
[00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:28.580]   or what they're doing.
[00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:32.980]   And so she'll say, "Whales eating oatmeal at the park."
[00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:35.880]   And then I'll just make up a story or a song about that.
[00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:38.220]   So that's something we do every night and it's been fun.
[00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:39.260]   Separately from that,
[00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:41.620]   she got this really cool thing called a Tony.
[00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:44.780]   And it's a box that's about, I don't know,
[00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:46.580]   four inches square.
[00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:49.660]   And it has these kind of characters on top,
[00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:52.420]   probably with some type of RFID in them.
[00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:54.460]   So when you set them on top of the box,
[00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:57.340]   the box is basically a speaker that's plugged in.
[00:28:57.340 --> 00:28:58.500]   It tells that story.
[00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:00.100]   So if you put the Gruffalo on top,
[00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:02.380]   it starts telling you out loud the story of the Gruffalo
[00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:05.220]   or Peter Rabbit, or some of them are songs.
[00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:08.440]   They have all these partnerships with different brands.
[00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:10.700]   And I actually think there's a couple other companies
[00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:12.420]   because I told this story to someone and they said,
[00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:15.100]   "Oh, we don't have a Tony box, but we have,"
[00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:17.340]   I think it was called a Yoto audio player.
[00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:18.220]   And they're very similar.
[00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:19.820]   They're like readers for kids.
[00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:21.500]   And they're fantastic 'cause our daughter
[00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:24.060]   will just get stories read to her on her own.
[00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:25.340]   She's three.
[00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:27.380]   And I thought, gosh, I had this idea.
[00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:29.700]   I don't know where the idea came from,
[00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:32.740]   but I thought, hmm,
[00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:35.380]   ChatGPT is pretty good at writing stories.
[00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:38.620]   And the podcast software I use, Descript,
[00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:43.040]   actually has this feature where if you read this long text,
[00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:46.420]   maybe two, three hours of text, it'll learn your voice
[00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:49.940]   and it will let you play your voice
[00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:51.540]   without you actually saying anything.
[00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:53.740]   It's basically like a virtual voice
[00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:55.220]   that can overdub anything
[00:29:55.220 --> 00:29:57.100]   because after you read three hours,
[00:29:57.100 --> 00:29:59.660]   it's learned the way you say everything
[00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:00.740]   and it can replace your voice.
[00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:01.900]   It's kind of scary.
[00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:04.020]   And I'm gonna play a clip of it in a second.
[00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:06.500]   So I had this process where very quickly,
[00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:10.780]   I had ChatGPT write maybe 10 different stories.
[00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:11.940]   And I would give it prompts like,
[00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:14.220]   "Write me a bedtime story for my three-year-old
[00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:17.220]   "about a white bird named Quinn going on a train to Mexico
[00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:20.020]   "and in the story, the bird should eat a hamburger."
[00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:23.500]   Or, "Write a bedtime story about a pink duck named Mama
[00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:25.220]   "who liked to eat grilled cheese sandwiches
[00:30:25.220 --> 00:30:27.100]   "and is going to the airplane museum."
[00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:28.460]   So like ridiculous things,
[00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:30.460]   but they're the kinds of things my daughter would say
[00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:32.540]   and some of them she actually wrote.
[00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:34.460]   Then I took all the text from it.
[00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:35.300]   Eventually I said,
[00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:37.860]   "Make sure the story is less than five minutes or something."
[00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:39.900]   So I wrote all of the stories.
[00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:41.620]   I copied them into Descript.
[00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:44.780]   And then I told Descript, "Now overdub this with my voice."
[00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:48.380]   Then I downloaded the MP3 and I uploaded it to the Tony box.
[00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:50.460]   And you can buy these custom Tonys.
[00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:52.460]   So I bought one of me, it's not really me,
[00:30:52.460 --> 00:30:54.540]   but I bought two custom Tonys.
[00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:58.540]   And one was a superhero guy and one was a fairy woman.
[00:30:58.540 --> 00:31:00.340]   And then I told our daughter, I said,
[00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:02.260]   "This is Daddy Tony and Mommy Tony."
[00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:04.340]   And so my wife and I have now each done this
[00:31:04.340 --> 00:31:05.380]   and she has a little Tony
[00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:07.380]   and whenever she puts it on her box,
[00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:10.700]   Daddy tells her a bedtime story or Mommy tells her a story.
[00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:12.180]   It doesn't even have to be bedtime.
[00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:13.820]   So I'll play a quick clip.
[00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:17.340]   You'll notice that it's not a perfect rendition of my voice,
[00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:20.140]   but it's close and to her, it's still my voice.
[00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:21.340]   So I'll play it.
[00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:23.020]   I just thought it was something fun,
[00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:26.780]   just a use case for different software and AI tools
[00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:29.820]   to add a little bit of interestingness to our lives,
[00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:31.140]   especially if you have kids.
[00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:33.260]   Once upon a time in a magical land,
[00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:35.460]   there lived a beautiful white bird named Quinn.
[00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:38.540]   Quinn had silky feathers as white as freshly fallen snow
[00:31:38.540 --> 00:31:40.860]   and a heart full of curiosity and adventure.
[00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:43.620]   One sunny morning while perched on a tall tree branch,
[00:31:43.620 --> 00:31:46.460]   Quinn noticed a colorful poster fluttering in the breeze.
[00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:48.020]   It depicted a magnificent train
[00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:50.380]   that was embarking on a journey to Mexico.
[00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:52.220]   Okay, so I won't play you the whole story,
[00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:53.340]   but there you go.
[00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:58.220]   As a parent, your child's wellbeing is your top priority.
[00:31:58.220 --> 00:31:59.980]   You wanna see them chase their dreams,
[00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:02.980]   embrace life's adventures and thrive in this world.
[00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:05.220]   But you also know life can be unpredictable
[00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:08.020]   and that's why it's important to plan for the unexpected
[00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:10.580]   so they can continue to thrive no matter what,
[00:32:10.580 --> 00:32:12.620]   which is why I'm excited to partner with Fabric
[00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:14.260]   by Gerber Life for this episode
[00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:16.940]   because they make term life insurance so easy.
[00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:20.660]   Fabric was designed by parents for parents

[00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:30.420]   I actually went online to compare prices
[00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:32.860]   and found that Fabric was highly competitive
[00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:35.460]   with great policies like a million dollars in coverage
[00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:37.100]   for less than a dollar a day.

[00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:12.140]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:14.540]   I get it, life comes at you fast,
[00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:17.420]   but trust me, your friends are probably desperate
[00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:18.540]   for a good hang.

[00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:33.060]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:34.900]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:36.340]   It could be your dog's birthday,
[00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:38.300]   that the sun finally came out,
[00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:39.780]   or maybe you just wanna celebrate
[00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:41.860]   that you got through another week.
[00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:43.940]   With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy
[00:33:43.940 --> 00:33:46.500]   by taking the drink run off your to-do list,
[00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:48.260]   which means you can entice your friends
[00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:51.340]   to leave their houses without ever leaving yours.
[00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:53.020]   And since I know you like a good deal,
[00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:55.580]   Drizzly compares prices on their massive selection
[00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:58.580]   of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:33:58.580 --> 00:34:00.620]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails
[00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:02.420]   while we were hosting family last week,
[00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:04.500]   not only could I get an Italian Amaro
[00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:06.140]   delivered in less than an hour,
[00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:09.620]   but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:11.260]   So whatever the occasion,
[00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:14.540]   download the Drizzly app or go to drizzly.com.

[00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:42.860]   Next, I wanna talk about
[00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:45.300]   this kind of elusive perfect credit score,
[00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:49.620]   because as someone who's tried to play this credit card game
[00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:52.260]   and been very attuned to my credit score
[00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:54.260]   and tried to optimize it in every way,
[00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:56.740]   I've always thought, gosh, how do I get to an 850,
[00:34:56.740 --> 00:34:58.300]   which is a perfect credit score?
[00:34:58.300 --> 00:35:01.100]   Now, when you log into Credit Karma,
[00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:02.940]   our most credit monitoring tools,
[00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:04.620]   they'll tell you the components of your score
[00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:06.220]   and how you score on them.
[00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:11.100]   I've been fortunate to be anywhere from 790 to 830
[00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:12.660]   in the last few years.
[00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:15.500]   But the other day, I was trying to clean up my inbox
[00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:18.860]   and disable some alerts I was getting from Experian.
[00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:20.740]   And when I logged into Experian,
[00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:23.660]   it said your FICO score on Experian was 850.
[00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:26.340]   And I looked at it, I thought, I finally did it.
[00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:27.380]   And nothing happened.
[00:35:27.380 --> 00:35:29.980]   Like, any amount of joy or satisfaction
[00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:33.180]   I thought I was gonna have from getting there, nonexistent.
[00:35:33.180 --> 00:35:35.820]   And the only thing I could think about was,
[00:35:35.820 --> 00:35:38.340]   I'm not getting any loans anytime soon.
[00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:39.220]   There are some credit cards
[00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:41.580]   with really great signup bonuses.
[00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:43.660]   Why was I ever even making this a goal?
[00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:47.660]   Like, in a way, it felt a little die with zero-esque,
[00:35:47.660 --> 00:35:50.460]   where targeting accumulating money
[00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:52.780]   and ending up dying with a bunch of extra money
[00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:53.900]   is actually a terrible goal
[00:35:53.900 --> 00:35:56.580]   because it means you didn't optimize for net fulfillment.
[00:35:56.580 --> 00:35:59.220]   Well, you don't need an 850 credit score.
[00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:01.820]   In fact, I think anything over like 760
[00:36:01.820 --> 00:36:04.780]   is gonna probably get you the best tier of rates
[00:36:04.780 --> 00:36:06.780]   for whatever loan you're looking for.
[00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:09.500]   In some ways, what I realized after hitting it,
[00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:12.500]   and I wouldn't say I tried hard, it wasn't like a quest,
[00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:15.420]   but I always thought, wow, it'd be cool to hit an 850.
[00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:18.420]   And then I realized, well, this 850 is really just a sign.
[00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:20.500]   I could probably get a few more welcome bonuses.
[00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:22.700]   Like, there's a little bit of room for play here.
[00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:23.540]   What am I doing?
[00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:27.460]   And so I think similar to the optimization story,
[00:36:27.460 --> 00:36:28.820]   it was just something interesting
[00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:31.260]   where I'd always thought it would be a cool goal.
[00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:32.980]   When I hit it, nothing happened.
[00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:34.780]   It wasn't cool, it wasn't interesting.
[00:36:34.780 --> 00:36:36.060]   And if anything, it made me think
[00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:38.140]   that it was a silly goal in the first place
[00:36:38.140 --> 00:36:40.980]   because I probably could, instead of that,
[00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:43.580]   add a few extra hundreds of thousands of points
[00:36:43.580 --> 00:36:46.380]   by not worrying as much about credit score
[00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:49.900]   and really focused on keeping it above a point that mattered
[00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:51.860]   but not really doing much else.
[00:36:51.860 --> 00:36:54.820]   So if anyone out there has a similar goal,
[00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:56.060]   I urge you to give up on it
[00:36:56.060 --> 00:36:58.380]   because there was zero satisfaction in hitting.
[00:36:58.380 --> 00:37:00.460]   Okay, maybe there's a little satisfaction in hitting it,
[00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:02.180]   but it wore off immediately
[00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:04.060]   and maybe came with some self-resentment
[00:37:04.060 --> 00:37:06.540]   over wasting any time doing that
[00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:09.020]   instead of optimizing for more points
[00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:12.420]   and ultimately more trips or more interesting adventures.
[00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:14.280]   Next, I wanna briefly share a medical
[00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:16.940]   or health insurance situation I dealt with recently.
[00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:19.500]   So if you were here last year, in episode 97,
[00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:21.060]   I interviewed Dr. Jordan Schlein
[00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:23.700]   about all kinds of ways to optimize your health.
[00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:26.060]   And in that episode, I shared that I'd recently gotten
[00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:29.260]   a positive calcium score on a heart CT scan,
[00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:32.320]   which unfortunately for me is evidence of high cholesterol
[00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:34.980]   leading to some calcified plaque buildup
[00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:38.540]   in one of my arteries, which is unfortunately irreversible.
[00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:41.060]   Now, the score was very low and it was early enough
[00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:43.120]   that getting on the right medication
[00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:44.620]   will hopefully be able to prevent
[00:37:44.620 --> 00:37:47.920]   or at least massively slow down any issues down the road,
[00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:50.180]   which by the way, I have gotten on those medications.
[00:37:50.180 --> 00:37:52.100]   My cholesterol is down.
[00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:54.460]   But recently I managed to chat with a cardiologist
[00:37:54.460 --> 00:37:57.440]   about the situation, and he talked about how
[00:37:57.440 --> 00:38:00.060]   a more affordable calcium score scan, like the one I did,
[00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:02.360]   really only checks for calcified plaque,
[00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:05.220]   but it won't actually see any of the soft plaque
[00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:07.420]   that may or may not be built up in your arteries
[00:38:07.420 --> 00:38:09.220]   that hasn't yet calcified.
[00:38:09.220 --> 00:38:12.380]   And if you find out you have a lot of soft plaque,
[00:38:12.380 --> 00:38:14.260]   he said you may wanna be more aggressive
[00:38:14.260 --> 00:38:16.440]   with your course of action or treatment.
[00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:18.120]   So to get that answer,
[00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:20.180]   he said you need to do a CT angiogram,
[00:38:20.180 --> 00:38:22.260]   which uses the same CT scan,
[00:38:22.260 --> 00:38:24.460]   but they inject you with a contrast dye
[00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:26.660]   so you can actually see the blood flowing
[00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:29.260]   through your arteries to see if they get constricted further
[00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:30.360]   by soft plaque.
[00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:32.520]   So I thought maybe it would be a good idea to also do that,
[00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:34.780]   and I started trying to see what it would cost.
[00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:36.980]   Now, the interesting thing I've learned recently
[00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:39.780]   about heart-related, cholesterol-related things
[00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:42.940]   is that so much of our medical system right now
[00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:46.140]   is based off of this kind of belief
[00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:48.280]   and kind of risk-scoring methodology
[00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:51.560]   that really only looks at what your near-term risk
[00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:54.820]   of having a cardiac-related event is.
[00:38:54.820 --> 00:38:56.380]   And the calculator, for many people,
[00:38:56.380 --> 00:38:58.840]   doesn't even actually work until you're 40.
[00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:03.280]   So establishing any kind of medical necessity for anything
[00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:05.260]   and getting things run through insurance
[00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:07.120]   can actually be quite difficult.
[00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:09.040]   And so I've had a lot of, I don't know,
[00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:11.920]   fear of getting charged that really reminded me
[00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:13.980]   of my episode with Marshall Allen
[00:39:13.980 --> 00:39:16.660]   about fighting back with health insurance companies,
[00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:19.100]   but fortunately, that first CT scan
[00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:20.580]   did get covered by insurance.
[00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:23.020]   And it was really funny because after I'd gotten it done
[00:39:23.020 --> 00:39:26.540]   and found out that I already had a positive calcium score,
[00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:28.380]   I got a letter from the insurance company that said,
[00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:31.020]   "We're not sure if we're gonna be able to cover this
[00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:32.520]   "because there's not enough evidence
[00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:35.700]   "that you might have a situation worth doing this test."
[00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:37.540]   Funny enough, obviously, that wasn't the case,
[00:39:37.540 --> 00:39:38.940]   and I did have it.
[00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:41.700]   I don't know if the results ended up justifying it or not,
[00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:44.660]   but eventually, it turns out it was covered by my insurance,
[00:39:44.660 --> 00:39:45.860]   so I didn't ask questions.
[00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:47.900]   This one was much more expensive.
[00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:49.260]   Depending on who you talk to,
[00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:51.940]   it could be $1,000 to $5,000 or $6,000.
[00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:53.600]   So I wanted to make sure before getting it
[00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:54.440]   that it would be covered.
[00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:56.060]   And the reason I wanna share this story
[00:39:56.060 --> 00:39:59.260]   is because what happened was very interesting.
[00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:03.080]   So I called up and said, "I wanna schedule this."
[00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:05.340]   I talked to Sutter Health,
[00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:07.220]   which is where I got the procedure done,
[00:40:07.220 --> 00:40:09.240]   quick in and out procedure, but they said,
[00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:10.700]   "Okay, we're gonna run it by insurance
[00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:11.780]   "and we'll let you know."
[00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:12.800]   And when they followed up, they said,
[00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:14.000]   "Hey, your insurance looks like
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:15.820]   "it's gonna cover it 100%."
[00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:17.260]   So I was like, "Okay."
[00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:18.640]   I called the insurance company and I'm like,
[00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:19.520]   "Hey, this is expensive.
[00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:20.960]   "I wanna make sure it's covered."
[00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:22.800]   And the first person I talked to said,
[00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:26.140]   "Totally covered, 100%, shouldn't be an issue."
[00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:27.320]   And I said, "Great.
[00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:28.620]   "Is there anything else I need to know?"
[00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:30.780]   And she's like, "Yeah, let me just read this out loud."
[00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:32.080]   And it was like, "Blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:34.500]   "Covered 100% as long as it's deemed medically necessary."
[00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:35.920]   I was like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:38.140]   "Who deems if it's medically necessary?"
[00:40:38.140 --> 00:40:39.780]   And the representative said,
[00:40:39.780 --> 00:40:42.580]   "Well, it kinda depends on the doctor and the hospital,
[00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:44.740]   "but it's the responsibility of the hospital
[00:40:44.740 --> 00:40:46.540]   "to make sure we'll pay for it.
[00:40:46.540 --> 00:40:49.060]   "So just make sure that when you go get it done,
[00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:50.900]   "you don't sign any documents saying
[00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:53.240]   "that you will be liable for the charges
[00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:55.220]   "because if you don't sign those documents,
[00:40:55.220 --> 00:40:57.380]   "then it's really just gonna be between us and the hospital
[00:40:57.380 --> 00:40:59.020]   "and you won't be on the hook."
[00:40:59.020 --> 00:41:00.060]   I said, "Okay, great."
[00:41:00.060 --> 00:41:02.240]   I go to the procedure and the first thing they do
[00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:03.920]   is they hand me a piece of paper that says,
[00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:05.200]   "Can you sign this thing that says
[00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:07.240]   "you will be on the hook for this procedure
[00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:09.300]   "if your insurance doesn't cover it?"
[00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:10.980]   Now, the insurance company told me not to sign this
[00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:12.860]   and I said, "Is there a way I can do anything
[00:41:12.860 --> 00:41:13.700]   "without signing this?"
[00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:14.860]   "No, if you don't sign this,
[00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:16.580]   "we're just gonna cancel your appointment."
[00:41:16.580 --> 00:41:18.420]   And I said, "Well, can you at least tell me
[00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:19.940]   "how much it's gonna cost?"
[00:41:19.940 --> 00:41:22.000]   And they said, "Well, we can't tell you how much it costs
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.460]   "because your insurance is gonna cover it in full."
[00:41:24.460 --> 00:41:27.280]   I said, "Well, why do you need me to sign this document
[00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:29.320]   "that says that if my insurance won't cover it,
[00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:31.240]   "I'll pay for it if it's gonna cover it in full?"
[00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:32.220]   They said, "Well, maybe you should call
[00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:33.060]   "the billing department.
[00:41:33.060 --> 00:41:34.160]   "Here's the phone number."
[00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:35.140]   So while I'm waiting at the hospital,
[00:41:35.140 --> 00:41:36.320]   I call this billing department and they said,
[00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:37.680]   "Well, we didn't even run an estimate
[00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:39.080]   "'cause your insurance is gonna cover it.
[00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:41.200]   "So I don't even think you need to worry about it."
[00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:42.420]   And I was like, "That's great.
[00:41:42.420 --> 00:41:44.480]   "But if my insurance doesn't cover it,
[00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:46.240]   "you're not gonna be stuck with a bill.
[00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:48.080]   "So would be really, really great
[00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:50.240]   "if you could tell me how much it's gonna cost."
[00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:52.840]   Back and forth while both doing this on the live chat,
[00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:55.080]   on the website and on the phone,
[00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:56.600]   I got two different estimates.
[00:41:56.600 --> 00:41:59.760]   One was 2000, one was $5,000.
[00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:03.560]   And I had to really make a call on how much do I trust
[00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:05.440]   that this hospital is correct
[00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:07.160]   that my insurance will cover it?
[00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:09.240]   How important is this medical necessity?
[00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:11.640]   Will the doctor be able to convince the insurance company
[00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:13.320]   if they don't believe it?
[00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:15.680]   I had the billing representative write down a note
[00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:18.080]   that she told me it looks like it will be covered.
[00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:20.140]   So at the end of the day, I decided,
[00:42:20.140 --> 00:42:22.560]   "I really wanna know what this is gonna tell me.
[00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:25.300]   "My cardiac health seems important enough
[00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:26.820]   "to roll the dice here.
[00:42:26.820 --> 00:42:29.480]   "If I tried to come up with some weighted probability
[00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:31.100]   "of being able to get this done,
[00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:32.880]   "and if they didn't cover it,
[00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:35.040]   "what would I be able to negotiate with the hospital
[00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:36.680]   "from everything I learned from Marshall Allen
[00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:38.080]   "in that episode?"
[00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:39.120]   I went for it.
[00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:41.240]   Now, I got the bill first,
[00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:45.320]   and it was for about $5,700.
[00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:47.600]   And I had a flag on the Cigna website
[00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:49.760]   that said, "Awaiting approval,"
[00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:51.600]   which made me a bit nervous.
[00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:54.080]   Fortunately, about four or five days later,
[00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:55.920]   I got an email that there was an update.
[00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:58.240]   I logged in and it was fully covered.
[00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:00.800]   So I didn't have to go fight that bill,
[00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:03.380]   but I would be lying if I wasn't sweating a few bullets
[00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:06.560]   that week wondering whether I was gonna get a $5,000 bill,
[00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:08.620]   what I'd be able to negotiate it with or not.
[00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:10.320]   The only step I didn't take,
[00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:13.720]   which I wish I did to prevent a little bit of stress,
[00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:16.460]   was it turns out I could have asked
[00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:19.000]   if they could review the medical necessity,
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:21.280]   but I would need my doctor to do that.
[00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:24.380]   So I would have needed the doctor that wrote the test order
[00:43:24.380 --> 00:43:26.960]   to reach out to the insurance company
[00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:28.980]   and spend a ton of time doing that.
[00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:31.300]   And in hindsight, I probably wish I did
[00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:33.300]   'cause it would have saved me a little bit of stress.
[00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:34.280]   Knowing what I know now,
[00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:36.200]   obviously I wouldn't have 'cause it was covered,
[00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:38.720]   but I just wanted to share the situation.
[00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:42.860]   One, because had I not done my own research,
[00:43:42.860 --> 00:43:44.400]   everyone in that facility,
[00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:46.000]   including the first person I talked to
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:47.240]   at my insurance company,
[00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:50.600]   seemed absolutely certain it was going to be covered.
[00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:52.720]   But the small caveat that I learned
[00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:55.400]   was only if deemed medically necessary.
[00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:57.640]   And I've heard way too many horror stories
[00:43:57.640 --> 00:44:00.240]   about that not turning out in your favor.
[00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:02.520]   So I just say, be extra cautious
[00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:04.760]   when getting any of these treatments done,
[00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:06.720]   making sure that there aren't any
[00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:08.580]   potential hiccups in medical necessity,
[00:44:08.580 --> 00:44:12.020]   and if so, getting them approved in advance
[00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:13.800]   so that you're not stressed out about this.
[00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:15.640]   Also, shop around a bit.
[00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:17.160]   I did ultimately learn later
[00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:19.480]   that the difference between the $2,000 rate
[00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:24.200]   and the $5,000 rate was self-pay versus insurance pay.
[00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:26.680]   So I would definitely make sure when you're going in,
[00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:28.800]   if you know your insurance won't cover it,
[00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:31.200]   make sure it doesn't get coated up like it will
[00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:33.900]   because it might end up getting priced incorrectly.
[00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:35.320]   But definitely also call around
[00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:37.020]   and see if there's another facility.
[00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:39.760]   I did find a site that I had heard good things about
[00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:41.120]   called MedMo.
[00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:44.360]   I can't speak to anything about it, M-E-D-M-O,
[00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:46.880]   but they have a site where you can go in
[00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:50.360]   and schedule a bunch of different types of procedures.
[00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:52.280]   And the rates they have available
[00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:55.580]   are significantly, significantly lower
[00:44:55.580 --> 00:44:57.360]   than the rates I found anywhere else.
[00:44:57.360 --> 00:45:00.720]   For example, and this seems a little crazy,
[00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:02.680]   I'm reading this out loud, but I'm looking at it right now,
[00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:06.680]   the CT heart coronary angiogram with intravenous contrast,
[00:45:06.680 --> 00:45:10.680]   the self-pay rate on the MedMo site is 375.
[00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:12.800]   So I'm not sure how they get that rate,
[00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:14.480]   what facilities they're using.
[00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:16.920]   I was advised by that same cardiologist
[00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:19.400]   to try to find a facility with newer equipment
[00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:23.080]   that would have lower radiation doses than older equipment,
[00:45:23.080 --> 00:45:26.460]   but seemed like MedMo was a good option
[00:45:26.460 --> 00:45:28.720]   if you're having to self-pay to find something cheaper.
[00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:30.200]   Obviously, I hope everyone has
[00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:31.640]   all of their medical conditions covered.
[00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:33.960]   In fact, I hope everyone doesn't have any medical conditions
[00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:35.720]   but I just thought that would be helpful.
[00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:37.200]   And for anyone interested,
[00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:39.740]   the results of that CT angiogram
[00:45:39.740 --> 00:45:42.980]   were not only that I didn't have any soft plaque,
[00:45:42.980 --> 00:45:47.180]   but that the calcium score that the first test told me I had,
[00:45:47.180 --> 00:45:49.520]   which was actually in the exact same machine
[00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:52.840]   as the second test, was not correct.
[00:45:52.840 --> 00:45:56.360]   And that this test found that I had a zero instead of a two.
[00:45:56.360 --> 00:45:58.880]   And so now I'm in the process of trying to request
[00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:03.880]   that they review both of the scans next to each other
[00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:07.320]   and try to come to a determination of which one was correct.
[00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:09.920]   So still a little bit of ambiguity there,
[00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:13.760]   but I'm optimistic that the more expensive
[00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:17.240]   kind of fancier test might be correct, but who knows.
[00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:18.800]   I mentioned I wanna talk a little about
[00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:21.800]   this annual All The Hacks trip to Iceland.
[00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:24.320]   So at the end of the Iceland episode,
[00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:26.400]   I started talking with my guest Brandon Presser
[00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:29.400]   about whether we could actually take a trip like this.
[00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:31.080]   And so in that episode,
[00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:33.800]   we basically outlined a perfect trip to Iceland.
[00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:34.840]   I've never been to Iceland.
[00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:37.160]   I thought, why don't we just go on this trip
[00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:39.160]   and why go through the effort to plan a perfect trip
[00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:41.120]   and go on it just with the two of us?
[00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:43.680]   Or if we invite partners, maybe the four of us,
[00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:45.880]   why don't we invite the community?
[00:46:45.880 --> 00:46:49.280]   And so that sparked a series of back and forth questions.
[00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:50.800]   It sparked a survey.
[00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:52.000]   So if you haven't filled that out,
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:54.880]   you can go to allthehacks.com/iceland
[00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:58.800]   and fill out that survey, but it's actually coming together.
[00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:01.280]   So Brandon and I have decided that
[00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:02.960]   we're gonna plan this Iceland trip.
[00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:07.280]   It's gonna happen sometime in the spring of 2024.
[00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:10.040]   I, funny enough, wanted to try to optimize for a date
[00:47:10.040 --> 00:47:12.360]   that wasn't everyone's spring break,
[00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:14.480]   or maybe it was everyone's spring break.
[00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:16.240]   And I started looking up spring breaks
[00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:17.680]   in different counties and cities
[00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:21.080]   and found that every single week from March 11th
[00:47:21.080 --> 00:47:24.560]   till April 30th is a spring break somewhere.
[00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:26.280]   So I'm not sure if it's better
[00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:27.960]   that it's your spring break or not,
[00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:30.040]   but it most likely will be someone's
[00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:32.320]   because it seems impossible to avoid.
[00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:34.120]   So that trip is going to happen.
[00:47:34.120 --> 00:47:37.920]   Stay tuned on pricing, stay tuned on dates.
[00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:42.920]   I think it will likely be somewhere around 12 to 14 people.
[00:47:42.920 --> 00:47:45.720]   Brandon said the ideal group is a group
[00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:47.240]   that fits in two vans.
[00:47:47.240 --> 00:47:49.160]   That doesn't mean that we're all gonna be traveling
[00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:52.520]   and doing everything in groups of 12 to 15 people.
[00:47:52.520 --> 00:47:54.840]   It likely means that we'll split some things off
[00:47:54.840 --> 00:47:57.400]   so we can do some small group adventures so it's not crazy,
[00:47:57.400 --> 00:48:01.000]   but we will definitely have time for dinners together
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:02.000]   and all kinds of stuff.
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:03.760]   So I think it will be an awesome trip.
[00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:04.840]   I will be there.
[00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:06.040]   Brandon will be there.
[00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:08.660]   It'll be a trip to remember for anyone
[00:48:08.660 --> 00:48:09.880]   who wants to see Iceland
[00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:11.560]   because Brandon really knows everything
[00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:12.880]   there is to know about that country,
[00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:15.980]   at least as much as anyone I've ever heard talk about it.
[00:48:15.980 --> 00:48:17.880]   But given the limited size,
[00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:19.640]   I will just be totally transparent
[00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:21.760]   that I will make it available first to members
[00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:24.120]   for some period of time to maybe make a deposit,
[00:48:24.120 --> 00:48:25.640]   to lock in and hold a spot,
[00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:28.440]   and then I'll make it available to everyone else after.
[00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:31.800]   Now, we're already talking about also doing the same thing
[00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:33.840]   for a Japan trip next fall.
[00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:35.640]   So stay tuned.
[00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:37.960]   I think this could be the first of many trips
[00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:40.800]   that we take as a community together.
[00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:44.520]   And I think it'll be really cool to meet people in person,
[00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:46.160]   be able to talk about a lot of the things
[00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:47.500]   that we talk about on the show,
[00:48:47.500 --> 00:48:49.780]   but with people in real life,
[00:48:49.780 --> 00:48:52.880]   which also leads me to another interesting idea,
[00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:56.120]   which I actually got from a survey I sent to members
[00:48:56.120 --> 00:48:58.240]   of trying to figure out what the right way
[00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:00.520]   to engage the broader community is.
[00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:02.680]   And it turns out lots of people were pretty busy.
[00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:04.840]   And so having just a forum
[00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:08.160]   where people can chat every day might be too much,
[00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:10.300]   but the idea of an annual event
[00:49:10.300 --> 00:49:11.960]   where people can get together
[00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:14.960]   and talk about various aspects of our lives
[00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:17.480]   and tactics we have for improving them
[00:49:17.480 --> 00:49:19.740]   and discuss and debate ways
[00:49:19.740 --> 00:49:22.540]   that we like to live more optimal lives
[00:49:22.540 --> 00:49:25.540]   and break off into groups to talk about specific areas,
[00:49:25.540 --> 00:49:28.700]   whether it's health or families or personal finances.
[00:49:28.700 --> 00:49:32.860]   And so the idea of putting together an all-the-hacks summit,
[00:49:32.860 --> 00:49:34.800]   like a one-day event somewhere,
[00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:37.780]   is something that I'm really seriously excited about.
[00:49:37.780 --> 00:49:39.980]   And I don't have any further details,
[00:49:39.980 --> 00:49:42.700]   but it's something that I'm actively thinking about.
[00:49:42.700 --> 00:49:46.660]   Then that leads to how we're gonna take on all this stuff.
[00:49:46.660 --> 00:49:49.500]   So the trips, adding new products,
[00:49:49.500 --> 00:49:50.980]   I'm working on a course right now
[00:49:50.980 --> 00:49:53.540]   that will be all about credit cards, points, and miles.
[00:49:53.540 --> 00:49:56.380]   The goal is I get so many people that reach out and say,
[00:49:56.380 --> 00:49:58.260]   "You've done so many episodes.
[00:49:58.260 --> 00:50:01.780]   "What if I just want a start-to-finish course
[00:50:01.780 --> 00:50:03.620]   "that's like an intense deep dive
[00:50:03.620 --> 00:50:05.660]   "on credit card points and miles,
[00:50:05.660 --> 00:50:07.000]   "or maybe it's redeeming,
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:08.740]   "or maybe it's earning more points."
[00:50:08.740 --> 00:50:11.140]   And so I'm working on trying to take all the knowledge
[00:50:11.140 --> 00:50:13.580]   and all the content from the show,
[00:50:13.580 --> 00:50:16.300]   which you'll always be able to go back in the archives
[00:50:16.300 --> 00:50:18.500]   and listen to, but put it in a format
[00:50:18.500 --> 00:50:21.260]   that might be easier for people to digest
[00:50:21.260 --> 00:50:23.580]   who haven't been around for a while
[00:50:23.580 --> 00:50:26.880]   or want something in a different format.
[00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:30.040]   It looks like it'll probably be, my best guess,
[00:50:30.040 --> 00:50:32.500]   is like 100 hours of work to write it up,
[00:50:32.500 --> 00:50:34.700]   record it, build it out.
[00:50:34.700 --> 00:50:37.740]   And so it's gonna take a little time, maybe a few months,
[00:50:37.740 --> 00:50:39.540]   but it's something else I'm really excited about.
[00:50:39.540 --> 00:50:41.020]   So to do all of this,
[00:50:41.020 --> 00:50:42.660]   getting more deals for the membership,
[00:50:42.660 --> 00:50:43.740]   how do we go secure
[00:50:43.740 --> 00:50:46.220]   some of the best partner deals possible?
[00:50:46.220 --> 00:50:47.740]   Really, really big brands.
[00:50:47.740 --> 00:50:49.940]   How do we do awesome things?
[00:50:49.940 --> 00:50:51.180]   I was trying to figure out what to do,
[00:50:51.180 --> 00:50:53.580]   who to hire, how to grow this,
[00:50:53.580 --> 00:50:56.660]   and I had a great conversation with my wife,
[00:50:56.660 --> 00:50:58.980]   and the answer was so obvious.
[00:50:58.980 --> 00:51:01.100]   And you all have heard me talk about my wife, Amy,
[00:51:01.100 --> 00:51:03.700]   who's basically the behind-the-scenes person
[00:51:03.700 --> 00:51:05.660]   helping with so many aspects of this.
[00:51:05.660 --> 00:51:07.300]   She's listened to almost every episode,
[00:51:07.300 --> 00:51:10.780]   given feedback, helped in so many ways.
[00:51:10.780 --> 00:51:14.820]   And so after a lot of conversation about the future
[00:51:14.820 --> 00:51:17.820]   and how we wanna live our lives and work together,
[00:51:17.820 --> 00:51:19.780]   she decided that she's gonna join
[00:51:19.780 --> 00:51:22.060]   all the hacks full-time next month,
[00:51:22.060 --> 00:51:25.460]   and we are gonna really take this to the next level.
[00:51:25.460 --> 00:51:27.120]   For those of you who don't know anything
[00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:28.500]   about her background,
[00:51:28.500 --> 00:51:32.500]   she spent a decade at Lyft running Beady and Partnerships.
[00:51:32.500 --> 00:51:35.220]   She led the partnerships Lyft did
[00:51:35.220 --> 00:51:39.780]   with Chase, Delta, JetBlue, Disney, Hilton,
[00:51:39.780 --> 00:51:42.380]   and so many other big, big brands
[00:51:42.380 --> 00:51:47.100]   in travel, points, hospitality, and so many other areas.
[00:51:47.100 --> 00:51:49.940]   So she has some crazy, amazing ideas
[00:51:49.940 --> 00:51:52.220]   of ways that being an All The Hacks member
[00:51:52.220 --> 00:51:54.700]   could add so much more value to your life.
[00:51:54.700 --> 00:51:56.980]   She also has some really amazing ideas
[00:51:56.980 --> 00:52:00.200]   about how we can take all the interesting content
[00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:02.100]   and learnings and access we have
[00:52:02.100 --> 00:52:05.300]   and turn them into even more amazing things
[00:52:05.300 --> 00:52:06.300]   for everyone here.
[00:52:06.300 --> 00:52:09.020]   So I'm really excited for that.
[00:52:09.020 --> 00:52:11.020]   In fact, as a way to kick that off,
[00:52:11.020 --> 00:52:14.060]   I'm gonna invite her to join me right now
[00:52:14.060 --> 00:52:17.420]   just because she actually had her own musing
[00:52:17.420 --> 00:52:20.000]   of something amazing she experienced this week.
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:23.180]   And I was like, Amy, this is a perfect thing
[00:52:23.180 --> 00:52:25.340]   to share on this episode.
[00:52:25.340 --> 00:52:27.260]   So Amy, welcome to the show.
[00:52:27.260 --> 00:52:28.820]   - Thanks so much for having me.
[00:52:28.820 --> 00:52:32.340]   I'm really excited to be joining All The Hacks full-time.
[00:52:32.340 --> 00:52:34.060]   It's been really interesting to see
[00:52:34.060 --> 00:52:36.100]   all of the listener emails that come in.
[00:52:36.100 --> 00:52:37.700]   Chris has shared several with me.
[00:52:37.700 --> 00:52:39.340]   I'm fascinated by all the information
[00:52:39.340 --> 00:52:40.900]   being shared back and forth.
[00:52:40.900 --> 00:52:43.980]   And I'm really fascinated at the amount of intensity
[00:52:43.980 --> 00:52:46.500]   and passion you all bring around these topics.
[00:52:46.500 --> 00:52:49.020]   So thank you so much for continuing to support us
[00:52:49.020 --> 00:52:50.100]   at All The Hacks.
[00:52:50.100 --> 00:52:53.660]   I'm really pumped to be here and help out however I can.
[00:52:53.660 --> 00:52:56.020]   - Also, if you have any deals that you're interested

[00:53:04.540 --> 00:53:07.640]   about membership stuff for you as listeners.

[00:53:15.940 --> 00:53:18.140]   Or if you work at a company and you're interested
[00:53:18.140 --> 00:53:19.340]   in partnering with All The Hacks,
[00:53:19.340 --> 00:53:21.380]   please also send us a note.
[00:53:21.380 --> 00:53:24.140]   - Or if you run a company, we'd love to hear any ideas
[00:53:24.140 --> 00:53:25.940]   you have on things we could do for this community.
[00:53:25.940 --> 00:53:28.020]   But Amy, you had a thing,
[00:53:28.020 --> 00:53:29.260]   and we were talking about this episode,
[00:53:29.260 --> 00:53:32.100]   about doing some musings about random things.
[00:53:32.100 --> 00:53:34.140]   You actually had one this week.
[00:53:34.140 --> 00:53:35.100]   - I did.
[00:53:35.100 --> 00:53:38.740]   So Chris and I are very interested in all things
[00:53:38.740 --> 00:53:41.100]   credit card, points, travel.
[00:53:41.100 --> 00:53:42.540]   We both have Venturex cards.
[00:53:42.540 --> 00:53:46.540]   And earlier this week, I got a random email from Capital One
[00:53:46.540 --> 00:53:48.140]   and in the email it said,
[00:53:48.140 --> 00:53:50.140]   "Hey, it looks like you were charged
[00:53:50.140 --> 00:53:52.140]   the same transaction twice.
[00:53:52.140 --> 00:53:54.860]   Is this accurate or would you like to dispute it?"
[00:53:54.860 --> 00:53:56.980]   And in the email, there was a little button at the bottom.
[00:53:56.980 --> 00:53:58.340]   It said, "Dispute."
[00:53:58.340 --> 00:53:59.340]   I clicked on that.
[00:53:59.340 --> 00:54:00.900]   It took me to another landing page.
[00:54:00.900 --> 00:54:02.980]   It said, "File a dispute here."
[00:54:02.980 --> 00:54:05.380]   I clicked one other button,
[00:54:05.380 --> 00:54:09.860]   and immediately they submitted a disputed claim
[00:54:09.860 --> 00:54:10.900]   on my behalf.
[00:54:10.900 --> 00:54:12.500]   They flagged it for me.
[00:54:12.500 --> 00:54:15.300]   It took nothing more than maybe three seconds,
[00:54:15.300 --> 00:54:17.100]   two clicks, and that was it.
[00:54:17.100 --> 00:54:21.020]   Immediately after, I got a message from Capital One
[00:54:21.020 --> 00:54:25.540]   and they confirmed that they will credit my account.
[00:54:25.540 --> 00:54:27.260]   So shout out to Capital One.
[00:54:27.260 --> 00:54:29.940]   I hope that a lot of these other card companies
[00:54:29.940 --> 00:54:34.300]   are starting to do more proactive diligence around that.
[00:54:34.300 --> 00:54:35.980]   I think it was a really great experience.
[00:54:35.980 --> 00:54:38.300]   It definitely made me excited for what cards are doing
[00:54:38.300 --> 00:54:42.180]   and what cards could be doing for all of us.
[00:54:42.180 --> 00:54:44.740]   - It's funny 'cause I had a similar experience on Capital One
[00:54:44.740 --> 00:54:47.020]   where I wanted to like limit the number
[00:54:47.020 --> 00:54:48.620]   of email alerts I was getting.
[00:54:48.620 --> 00:54:50.220]   And I went in to turn off some alerts
[00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:51.900]   and they had all these new alerts.
[00:54:51.900 --> 00:54:54.180]   So I saw one that said, "This is the one you got."
[00:54:54.180 --> 00:54:55.020]   It's like, "We'll notify you
[00:54:55.020 --> 00:54:56.740]   if you think you've been charged twice."
[00:54:56.740 --> 00:54:59.820]   But they also had higher than usual tips.
[00:54:59.820 --> 00:55:02.740]   So like if you tip more, they're gonna notify you.
[00:55:02.740 --> 00:55:03.860]   They had another one that was like,
[00:55:03.860 --> 00:55:06.540]   "If we notice a new subscription or a renewal
[00:55:06.540 --> 00:55:08.580]   or a free trial or something like that."
[00:55:08.580 --> 00:55:11.140]   They always do the refunds and declines.
[00:55:11.140 --> 00:55:12.380]   But they also had, "We'll notify you
[00:55:12.380 --> 00:55:15.460]   if a recurring in-app purchase is higher than usual."
[00:55:15.460 --> 00:55:17.260]   So it just seemed like there's a lot of stuff
[00:55:17.260 --> 00:55:18.260]   they're experimenting with.
[00:55:18.260 --> 00:55:21.380]   So keep it up Capital One and maybe everybody else
[00:55:21.380 --> 00:55:23.300]   take a note from that playbook.
[00:55:23.300 --> 00:55:24.780]   Any other things you wanna share
[00:55:24.780 --> 00:55:26.980]   before we wrap this kind of musing episode?
[00:55:26.980 --> 00:55:29.380]   - So I have gone deep in figuring out
[00:55:29.380 --> 00:55:32.620]   how to preserve our berries for as long as humanly possible.
[00:55:32.620 --> 00:55:35.980]   We have two small children and honestly,
[00:55:35.980 --> 00:55:39.060]   the berry bill at the end of each month is insane.
[00:55:39.060 --> 00:55:41.100]   They go through crazy amounts of berries.
[00:55:41.100 --> 00:55:43.940]   And as part of that, it's been really hard
[00:55:43.940 --> 00:55:46.020]   to not have these berries go moldy
[00:55:46.020 --> 00:55:47.540]   halfway through the crate.
[00:55:47.540 --> 00:55:49.300]   So a big shout out to Kurt.
[00:55:49.300 --> 00:55:51.740]   He wrote in and gave us a tip.
[00:55:51.740 --> 00:55:54.900]   He's had a lot of success with distilled white vinegar baths.
[00:55:54.900 --> 00:55:58.820]   I actually read about this before Kurt had sent the note in.
[00:55:58.820 --> 00:56:01.540]   And honestly, it sounded like a ton of work.
[00:56:01.540 --> 00:56:04.460]   But the way that he communicated it in his note
[00:56:04.460 --> 00:56:05.740]   actually really got me thinking
[00:56:05.740 --> 00:56:08.260]   this could be much easier than I realized.
[00:56:08.260 --> 00:56:10.020]   And so I took Kurt's advice.
[00:56:10.020 --> 00:56:12.340]   I did a quick distilled white vinegar bath
[00:56:12.340 --> 00:56:14.140]   on all of our berries,
[00:56:14.140 --> 00:56:16.100]   about no more than 30 seconds to a minute.
[00:56:16.100 --> 00:56:19.300]   I used about a one to four distilled white vinegar
[00:56:19.300 --> 00:56:20.860]   to water ratio.
[00:56:20.860 --> 00:56:23.700]   That kills the mold spores in the berries.
[00:56:23.700 --> 00:56:25.460]   I then gave him a quick rinse,
[00:56:25.460 --> 00:56:28.740]   put him out on a drying rack to Kurt's recommendation,
[00:56:28.740 --> 00:56:30.900]   let them dry and pack them up.
[00:56:30.900 --> 00:56:33.540]   And they're now perfectly stored in our refrigerator.
[00:56:33.540 --> 00:56:35.540]   So far, Kurt, it's been phenomenal.
[00:56:35.540 --> 00:56:38.380]   So I definitely encourage anyone to try this.
[00:56:38.380 --> 00:56:40.220]   It does seem to work.
[00:56:40.220 --> 00:56:42.860]   - The only thing I'll add here is that
[00:56:42.860 --> 00:56:45.620]   because we've been starting to do a lot of Amazon Fresh
[00:56:45.620 --> 00:56:47.500]   and Whole Foods delivery,
[00:56:47.500 --> 00:56:49.860]   the one thing I love about online grocery delivery,
[00:56:49.860 --> 00:56:51.820]   and I feel like I just said this a few days ago,
[00:56:51.820 --> 00:56:53.740]   but maybe it was on another podcast,
[00:56:53.740 --> 00:56:56.740]   is that when things do go moldy quickly,
[00:56:56.740 --> 00:56:58.260]   it is so much less hassle
[00:56:58.260 --> 00:57:01.780]   and so much easier to return things online
[00:57:01.780 --> 00:57:04.060]   than to drive all the way to the grocery store
[00:57:04.060 --> 00:57:07.300]   if you have three, four, $5 tin of raspberries
[00:57:07.300 --> 00:57:08.620]   and half of them are moldy.
[00:57:08.620 --> 00:57:12.500]   So one hack here is that buy your groceries online
[00:57:12.500 --> 00:57:14.340]   because at least with Amazon,
[00:57:14.340 --> 00:57:16.860]   it makes it so, so easy to return things
[00:57:16.860 --> 00:57:19.900]   if they spoil, go bad, or in some cases,
[00:57:19.900 --> 00:57:22.940]   they just show up moldy already, which is unfortunate,
[00:57:22.940 --> 00:57:27.260]   but definitely save some time or at least save some money.
[00:57:27.260 --> 00:57:30.020]   - This is actually goes against what Chris had said.
[00:57:30.020 --> 00:57:33.340]   Yes, buying fruit online is much easier
[00:57:33.340 --> 00:57:37.060]   if you do get bad fruit and you ask for a refund.
[00:57:37.060 --> 00:57:39.700]   That said, you don't have the ability
[00:57:39.700 --> 00:57:41.980]   when you're purchasing fruit online
[00:57:41.980 --> 00:57:44.780]   to be able to actually look at the fruit quality
[00:57:44.780 --> 00:57:47.500]   and choose the right berry carton
[00:57:47.500 --> 00:57:49.860]   that looks the most fresh.
[00:57:49.860 --> 00:57:52.580]   And so it's kind of a blessing and a curse.
[00:57:52.580 --> 00:57:53.580]   - I don't have that skill.
[00:57:53.580 --> 00:57:55.340]   That's the problem is I come home sometimes
[00:57:55.340 --> 00:57:56.580]   and I'm like, look, I got this in New York.
[00:57:56.580 --> 00:57:57.420]   Why did you get those?
[00:57:57.420 --> 00:57:58.980]   These are like moldy or soft.
[00:57:58.980 --> 00:58:01.020]   So I think it plays better to someone like me
[00:58:01.020 --> 00:58:02.300]   who doesn't know how to pick fruit
[00:58:02.300 --> 00:58:03.820]   at the grocery store than you.
[00:58:03.820 --> 00:58:04.660]   - That's fair.
[00:58:04.660 --> 00:58:06.420]   And quick tip,
[00:58:06.420 --> 00:58:08.620]   for those who don't know how to pick fresh berries,
[00:58:08.660 --> 00:58:13.660]   call it blueberries, raspberries, strawberries, blackberries.
[00:58:13.660 --> 00:58:15.740]   If you go to the store, pick up the crate
[00:58:15.740 --> 00:58:18.060]   and tip it upside down.
[00:58:18.060 --> 00:58:20.900]   If the fruit sticks to the top of the carton
[00:58:20.900 --> 00:58:23.740]   when it's upside down, do not purchase it.
[00:58:23.740 --> 00:58:26.300]   - Meaning when you turn it back, does it stay stuck
[00:58:26.300 --> 00:58:27.500]   or what are you looking for exactly?
[00:58:27.500 --> 00:58:29.740]   - No, when you pick up the fruit,
[00:58:29.740 --> 00:58:32.380]   all the fruit sits at the bottom of the carton.
[00:58:32.380 --> 00:58:34.780]   Flip the carton upside down.
[00:58:34.780 --> 00:58:37.300]   And if the fruit is still stuck now
[00:58:37.300 --> 00:58:40.580]   to what is the top of it, which used to be the bottom,
[00:58:40.580 --> 00:58:43.460]   do not choose that carton of berries.
[00:58:43.460 --> 00:58:44.300]   - All right.
[00:58:44.300 --> 00:58:46.100]   So maybe I can do this now.
[00:58:46.100 --> 00:58:47.940]   I've probably been told that like five times
[00:58:47.940 --> 00:58:48.980]   and still don't remember.
[00:58:48.980 --> 00:58:51.460]   Anything else we're gonna see, give us a feedback.
[00:58:51.460 --> 00:58:54.200]   You can always email us, podcast@allthehacks.com.
[00:58:54.200 --> 00:58:56.040]   Use the contact form on the website.
[00:58:56.040 --> 00:58:57.540]   Hit us up on social.
[00:58:57.540 --> 00:58:59.780]   Let us know, what do you think of this episode?
[00:58:59.780 --> 00:59:00.860]   Should we do more like this?
[00:59:00.860 --> 00:59:02.740]   Amy, should she come back?
[00:59:02.740 --> 00:59:04.020]   Should we keep doing these?
[00:59:04.020 --> 00:59:05.940]   I don't think Amy would be offended at all
[00:59:05.940 --> 00:59:08.020]   if you were like, have me on or don't.
[00:59:08.020 --> 00:59:08.980]   - Yeah, let me know.
[00:59:08.980 --> 00:59:10.500]   I won't be offended.
[00:59:10.500 --> 00:59:12.460]   - Anything else on your mind, send a note.
[00:59:12.460 --> 00:59:14.060]   That's all we got right now.
[00:59:14.060 --> 00:59:16.540]   We'll see you on Wednesday with another travel episode
[00:59:16.540 --> 00:59:18.420]   all about going to France.
[00:59:18.420 --> 00:59:19.620]   And it's a great one.
[00:59:19.620 --> 00:59:21.180]   So that's it.
[00:59:21.180 --> 00:59:22.020]   - Bye.
[00:59:22.020 --> 00:59:23.780]   (laughing)
[00:59:23.780 --> 00:59:24.820]   - See ya.
[00:59:24.820 --> 00:59:26.300]   (upbeat music)
[00:59:26.300 --> 00:59:28.100]   I really hope you enjoyed this episode.
[00:59:28.100 --> 00:59:29.860]   Thank you so much for listening.
[00:59:29.860 --> 00:59:31.380]   If you haven't already left a rating
[00:59:31.380 --> 00:59:33.860]   and a review for the show in Apple Podcasts
[00:59:33.860 --> 00:59:36.500]   or Spotify, I would really appreciate it.
[00:59:36.500 --> 00:59:37.940]   And if you have any feedback on the show,
[00:59:37.940 --> 00:59:40.300]   questions for me, or just wanna say hi,
[00:59:40.300 --> 00:59:44.580]   I'm Chris@allthehacks.com or @hutchins on Twitter.
[00:59:44.580 --> 00:59:45.660]   That's it for this week.
[00:59:45.660 --> 00:59:46.820]   I'll see you next week.
[00:59:46.820 --> 00:59:49.420]   (upbeat music)
[00:59:49.780 --> 00:59:52.860]   (electronic beeping)
[00:59:52.860 --> 00:59:55.940]   (electronic buzzing)
[00:59:55.940 --> 01:00:05.940]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
