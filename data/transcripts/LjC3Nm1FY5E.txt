[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.440]   Is there any detriment to having a piece of glass or a piece of plastic on the front of
[00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.440]   your eye all the time?
[00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:13.320]   And the reason I ask is not because I think we should live necessarily exactly like our
[00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:20.160]   ancestors, but it's a pretty bizarre adaptation to put a lens directly onto the front of the
[00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.160]   eye.
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.360]   You have to imagine that the cells and tissues there are accustomed to getting a certain
[00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:25.360]   amount of oxygen.
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.040]   They're accustomed to getting a certain amount of interaction with the environment, and you
[00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.320]   also are now adding another surface.
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:38.340]   The way that the tears are going to interact with the cornea of the eye are probably changed,
[00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.340]   and who knows?
[00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.480]   Maybe it doesn't make any negative difference at all, but putting a contact lens on the
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:49.520]   front of the eye is about as close to putting a device on your brain as I can think of,
[00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.400]   except for maybe the cochlear implant.
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.400]   That's a great question.
[00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.100]   Now, first of all, I want to distinguish.
[00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:06.520]   There are a few really medical uses for different kinds of contact lenses, like scleral contact
[00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:07.520]   lenses.
[00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.720]   For people who have certain diseases, there are other kinds, but I think what we really
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.000]   want to talk about right now is just kind of the run of the mill.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.880]   I want to get my prescription taken care of, but instead of wearing glasses, I'm going
[00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.520]   to wear contacts.
[00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:28.120]   Contacts, even the newest generation contacts, yes, they sort of change the tear dynamics
[00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.660]   on the surface of your eye.
[00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:37.960]   They decrease the oxygen diffusion that's just sort of out in the air onto the surface
[00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.360]   of our eye, onto the cells that are on the surface of our eye.
[00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:50.160]   But most of us, especially as we're younger, have enough tear film reserve, enough oxygen
[00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:57.840]   reserve that we can easily tolerate these polymer gel soft contact lenses and wear them
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:58.980]   happily.
[00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:06.520]   The advantage of contact lenses over glasses, purely from the perspective of correcting
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:15.600]   your vision, is that there's different elements of the shape of your eye that need to be corrected
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.960]   if you need corrective lenses.
[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:24.220]   And so for example, if the basketball shape of your eye is a little too steep or a little
[00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:29.960]   too shallow, that's what the standard glasses correct.
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.840]   You may have been told that you have something called astigmatism.
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.920]   That's where instead of having a basketball-shaped eye, you have a slightly football-shaped eye.
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.240]   It's not round in the same dimensions on both axes.
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.320]   And again, glasses can correct that.
[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.960]   But then there's higher order aberrations in our corneas, in the clear window in the
[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:55.400]   front of our eyes, or to some degree in the lens inside the eye that are focusing the
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.920]   light, that the glasses prescription can't correct.
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.200]   But if you have a nice, smooth contact lens on the front, it can correct.
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.620]   So a lot of people who wear glasses and contacts will report that they have a much higher quality
[00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.680]   of vision with their contact lens correction than with their glasses correction.
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:20.960]   And again, in service of enjoying the best vision that you can enjoy in your daily life,
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.840]   that's an upside to seeing if contacts could work for you.
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:30.240]   Now there's another element, though, and that's like, gosh, is there a risk of contact lenses?
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:37.840]   And especially as we age, we have less tear film reserve, so contacts may become less
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.040]   tolerable as we age.
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:46.160]   And the other thing is being really good about the cleaning, because the contacts can trap
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.400]   bacteria or fungus.
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.920]   And if you get a corneal infection from a contact lens, it actually can be quite devastating
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:54.920]   to your cornea.
[00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.120]   Even if you successfully treat the infection, you can be left with some corneal scarring.
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.320]   Thankfully, this happens very rarely.
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:07.480]   But when it does happen, it can be quite difficult on the person thereafter to sort of suffer
[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.600]   through having maybe a scar from that infection on the surface of their cornea that leads
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.360]   to some blurring vision, for example.
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:20.720]   So we always recommend that if you're going to wear contacts, that you be really attentive
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:26.240]   to whether you're tolerating them well, and then also to be really attentive to the recommended
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.560]   use and cleaning of the contact lenses.
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.520]   I actually recommend that even though they're a little more expensive to afford, that people
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:40.080]   should almost always be just using the daily contact lenses that they don't have to clean
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.760]   or use for two weeks or four-week period.
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.400]   So these are disposable contact lenses?
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.400]   Daily disposable.
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:51.680]   And I hate to think of, I don't know, filling our oceans or what have you with more polymer
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:52.680]   or plastic.
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.600]   But at least the contact lenses are small.
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:00.160]   And it's much safer for your eye to use a daily disposable than to use a two-week or
[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.480]   a four-week and be responsible for the cleaning.
[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:08.440]   The other thing to be really responsible about is sleeping in them overnight.
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.640]   Because overnight when your eyelids are closed, of course, now you're getting even less oxygen
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.000]   to the surface of your eye.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.320]   And actually, most bacteria, especially many of the infectious bacteria to our bodies and
[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:25.060]   to the surface of our eye, are actually bacteria that don't really like oxygen.
[00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:30.240]   And so we've got a low risk of getting bacterial infections on the surface of our eye.
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.840]   But if we use contacts too much, don't clean them, or sleep in them overnight when our
[00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:35.840]   eyelids are closed.
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:42.140]   And now there's even less oxygen kind of helping keep the surface more clean, if you will.
[00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:43.480]   That increases the risk a lot.
[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:49.220]   So being really good with the recommended use and cleaning of the contacts is critical
[00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:51.080]   considering daily use contacts.
[00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:52.080]   You don't have to.
[00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.240]   And look, most contacts are going to be the two-week or four-week kind where you put them
[00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.660]   in the cleaning solution overnight each time, give them a good rinse, and put them back
[00:05:58.660 --> 00:05:59.660]   in the next day.
[00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:06.080]   And again, most people, 99.99-some percent of people, are going to do just fine with
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.600]   that, follow the instructions, and never get into trouble.
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.120]   As we age, they're going to become less tolerable.
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.600]   People are going to say, I used to wear my contacts for 12 hours.
[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:19.360]   Now my eyes feel really dry after 6 or 8 or 10 hours.
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.520]   Maybe some years after that, they say, gosh, I could barely use it for four hours.
[00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.320]   I only use them when I go out on a Saturday night.
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:27.320]   And that's OK.
[00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:30.040]   You can back off as you need to back off.
[00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:34.900]   But in the meantime, if it helps you, especially in the younger decades, if it helps you really
[00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:38.400]   enjoy your best vision, great.
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:45.400]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
