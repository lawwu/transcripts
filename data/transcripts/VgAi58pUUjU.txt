[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.980]   I don't have a problem with investing in a company like Andrall.
[00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:06.940]   America needs defense companies in order to maintain its defense.
[00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:10.220]   And the problem right now that we have is there's these five prime companies that are
[00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:12.980]   antiquated and really expensive.
[00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:14.740]   And we need startup disruptors to that.
[00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:16.460]   So I'm not morally opposed to it.
[00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:17.860]   In fact, I think it's probably a good thing.
[00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.300]   I think my concern would be I don't really want to be part of the military industrial
[00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.300]   complex.
[00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.100]   I feel like it might corrupt my views on things.
[00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.440]   No, you'd want war, you'd be girding for war.
[00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:27.440]   That's your dimension.
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.440]   Right.
[00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.240]   I think it's more incentive to be like these generals who go on CNN and Fox News and justify
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.040]   every single war.
[00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.200]   That's my biggest fear as well.
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.940]   It's one thing to be investing in a bunch of companies where we're sitting around hoping
[00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.120]   for cheaper clicks on Facebook and Google.
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.440]   It's an entirely other thing to sit on the board of a company and hope for war.
[00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.840]   That's a horrible place to be.
[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.640]   If you believe that America should be the most important country in the world and you
[00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.720]   have the ability to help it be that, eventually some of those decisions will come in contact
[00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.240]   with this kind of decision.
