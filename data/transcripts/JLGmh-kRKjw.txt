[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   Happy Friday everyone. We have a lot of questions coming in now about video games as you might expect Pastor John.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   Here's one from a listener named Elizabeth who writes in and says, "Pastor John, I'm engaged to be married to a man who is addicted to video games.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   He says he wants to stop but his life shows very little fruit and he keeps playing games.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   Should I go on with this engagement or not? How should Elizabeth think about this, Pastor John?"
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   Well, we've been here before, haven't we? Being put in a position to tell women whether or not to marry somebody.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   Oh my, I feel so, I don't take this lightly at all. I really don't.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   I will give a yes or no answer to this question should I go through with this engagement.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   But before I do, let me ask Elizabeth five questions.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   Number one, have you considered the implications of 1 Corinthians 6, 12?
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   All things are lawful for me. That includes video games, I think.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   All things are lawful for me, but not all things are helpful.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   All things are lawful for me, but I will not be dominated by anything.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   Now that word "dominated," "exousias theisomai," that's one long Greek word, "I will not be dominated," is a strong word.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   It means nothing will have authority over me. It reminds us of Jesus' final words on the earth.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given me. Go make disciples."
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   That is, call people out from under every alien authority because you have my authority
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   and they should submit to my authority because I'm the strongest authority on the planet.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   And we call them out of demonic oppression and horrific false religions,
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   and nothing is to be enslaving, even the most subtle temptations of video games.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   Jesus calls us not just to be forgiven, not just to profess faith,
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   but to experience him as the one with all authority, breaking the powers that hold us captive.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   It's a serious thing to be held in bondage by anything but Christ.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   We've all been bought by Christ's blood for freedom. For freedom he has set you free.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   Do not submit again to a yoke of bondage, any kind of bondage.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Christ has set you free, and we dishonor the blood price of that liberation if we don't experience it.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   Question number two. What does it say about your fiancé's elevation of mind
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   that he is enslaved by something as trivial and banal as games?
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   And I use the word "elevation of mind" because of Colossians 3.1.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   "If then you have been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above," elevated,
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   where Christ is seated at the right hand of God.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on the earth.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   In other words, the mature Christian mind is elevated.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   Increasingly, our minds are taken up into great and glorious and beautiful God-like things.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   This means that the mind addicted to something as trivial and unimportant as games is out of touch with reality.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   These preoccupations are not only unimportant, they're unreal.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   Christ has saved our minds to be set on the most real and the most important things in the world.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   That's question number two. What about his elevation of mind?
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   Number three, if your fiancé can't control his behaviors in this area, will he be able to control them in other areas?
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   Jesus said in Luke 16.10, "One who is faithful in a very little is also faithful in much,
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   and one who is dishonest in a very little is also dishonest in much."
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   Now, marriage is a massive commitment for a woman and a man.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   There is no back door.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   That's why the disciples were stunned at Jesus' teaching about divorce, and they said, "Well, then who should marry, for goodness sakes?"
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   And Jesus said, "Well, it's not given to everyone. Maybe you shouldn't."
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   God gives grace to husbands and wives to deal with the disappointments that always come
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   when we discover things about our spouses that we didn't know would come, and they will.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   They'll always come. If they haven't come yet, they will.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   But at the front end, before you are married, be as wise as you can be so that you don't make a covenant with a man
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   who gives little evidence of his ability to control himself.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   Question number four, will this man be able to lead you in the way that Ephesians 5 describes as your head?
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   Headship means going ahead and doing many hard things that a family needs a husband to do.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   Doing hard things, which is what headship always involves, means denying immediate gratification of one of the—
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   and then pursuing the desire of some long-term joy in obedience and love and sacrifice and helpfulness.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   If he cannot deny himself a video game, will he be able to deny himself things for the good of the family?
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   Will he be able to get up from the television?
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   Will he be able to leave his hobby in the garage?
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   Will he be able to put his book down?
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   Will he be able to leave his computer and lead the family in Bible reading and prayer?
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   Or will he just be stuck?
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   He's not leaving his TV, he's not leaving his computer, he's not leaving his garage.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   It doesn't matter whether the family is perishing in the living room or not if he has no self-denial and no self-control.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   Number five, will he be exemplary for the children?
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   Children don't just learn what they're told, they learn what they see.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   And they will see what daddy defaults to, and that will be seen as his God.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   So, my answer to Elizabeth is no.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   Unless you see some significant character growth and freedom for greater things than games, I would not move forward in that relationship.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   And a while back we published an article titled "Fake Love, Fake War," and it was written by Russell Moore, which you can find at the DesiringGod.org website.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   It picks up on some of these related themes.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   And also see episode number 122, which is titled "Is My Boyfriend's Porn a Marriage Deal Breaker?"
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   It's always great to hear from listeners.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   If you have a question, please email it in to us at AskPastorJohn@DesiringGod.org
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   and visit us online at DesiringGod.org to find thousands of books, articles, sermons, and other resources from John Piper, all free of charge.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   We have a new week ahead and a new list of questions queued up for Pastor John.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   I'm your host Tony Reinke. We'll see you on Monday.
