[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400]   The following is a conversation with Nick Carter,
[00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.840]   who is a partner at Castle Island Ventures,
[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.600]   co-founder of CoinMetrics.io,
[00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.480]   and previously a crypto asset research analyst
[00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.240]   at Fidelity Investments.
[00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.240]   He's a prominent writer, speaker, and podcaster
[00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.640]   on topics around decentralized finance,
[00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.120]   and especially Bitcoin.
[00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.160]   Quick mention of our sponsors,
[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.800]   The Information, Athletic Greens,
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.140]   Four Sigmatic, and Blinkist.
[00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.800]   Check them out in the description to support this podcast.
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.440]   This conversation with Nick Carter
[00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.360]   is part of a series of episodes on cryptocurrency
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.040]   that is a small journey of exploration I'm on
[00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.080]   because I find decentralized finance,
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.720]   and especially Bitcoin, fascinating,
[00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.720]   technically and philosophically,
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.440]   especially because it may be the very mechanism
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.920]   that achieves a global decentralization of power,
[00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.440]   giving more sovereignty to the individual
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.880]   and making our systems more resilient to corruption
[00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.020]   manipulation, and in general,
[00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.560]   to the darker sides of human nature.
[00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.780]   Please let me also address something for a few minutes
[00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.480]   that happened recently that's been weighing heavy on me.
[00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.240]   If you find me annoying to listen to,
[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.120]   please skip to the actual conversation with Nick.
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.000]   I had a recent podcast episode with Anthony Pompliano,
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.760]   where we spoke about Bitcoin and life in general
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:23.920]   for three hours.
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.960]   I was curious, inspired, positive,
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.040]   or at least I tried to be as I usually do.
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.000]   Someone clipped out, out of context,
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.200]   a short segment of me mumbling something
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.560]   about having a PhD, and I started getting mocked online
[00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.760]   because that made it convenient for people
[00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.640]   to mock me for being yet another, quote unquote, expert
[00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.160]   who learns about Bitcoin and thinks he knows everything.
[00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.000]   I almost never mention that I have a PhD,
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.080]   except to make fun of myself, as I was doing,
[00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.440]   or at least trying to do in the full context
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.400]   of the conversation.
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.040]   I brought up grad school as a random example
[00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.460]   of one of the many journeys I've taken that was hard,
[00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.840]   but where the destination was in itself not very useful.
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.680]   I was saying I enjoy exploring with a curious mind
[00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.080]   and I'm willing to be patient, to learn, to listen,
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.060]   to humble myself with knowledge
[00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.320]   for the sake of knowledge itself.
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.680]   Grad school was an example of that.
[00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.720]   The PhD means nothing,
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.080]   at least to me.
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.520]   I never call myself an expert, or at least try not to,
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.220]   because that would be dumb,
[00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.200]   because I know how little I know.
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.640]   I'm not a influencer, or a thought leader,
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.960]   or whatever else silly self-aggrandizing label
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.080]   people put on their LinkedIn.
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.560]   I try to be the opposite of what I was mocked for.
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.680]   I try to think deeply about the world,
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.360]   to look for the beautiful ideas in the minds of others,
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.600]   and to be inspired by them.
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.800]   I wanted to say all this because psychologically,
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.840]   it struck a bit of a blow.
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.480]   It made me realize that even when I approach things
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.280]   with love, I may be mocked, I may be derided,
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.000]   I may be taken out of context, or even lied about.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.060]   With a growing platform, this is sadly only increasing.
[00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.480]   I now have learned that there's people
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.560]   who are waiting for my missteps,
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.440]   so they can point the finger, laugh, and say,
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.200]   "See, I told you so.
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.400]   "That guy's a joke, he's a fraud."
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.280]   As a fellow human being, the knowledge of this is painful.
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.280]   Yes, I know people tell me to toughen up,
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.340]   and my life has been about strengthening my mind
[00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.100]   in the face of my limits, but I refuse to not be fragile,
[00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.960]   and wear my heart on my sleeve.
[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.540]   It's who I am.
[00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.900]   In some sense, this is the immune system of the internet,
[00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.460]   but let us be careful not to destroy
[00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.700]   the good ones in the process.
[00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.740]   The Bitcoin community had to endure many years of attacks
[00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:54.620]   from quote-unquote experts,
[00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.060]   and also fraudulent cryptocurrency efforts
[00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.300]   that scammed people out of their money.
[00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.980]   This created a powerful immune system
[00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.660]   that fought the attackers and the scammers.
[00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.220]   I understand this, and I also understand
[00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.020]   that one of the beautiful aspects of Bitcoin
[00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.260]   is its community of humans is decentralized,
[00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.200]   but some small part of this community
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.180]   has come to enjoy the us versus them battles,
[00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.940]   sometimes for the sake of the battle in itself.
[00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.680]   This happens in political discourse as well.
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.100]   I understand this, but to my limited mind,
[00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.860]   it sounds like groupthink,
[00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.180]   which has powerful defense mechanisms against bad ideas,
[00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.340]   but has dangerous consequences if taken too far,
[00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.020]   as in many periods of human history that I often talk about,
[00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.380]   where the us versus them thinking
[00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.220]   has led to the suffering of many.
[00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.180]   Again, I understand the value of this
[00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.220]   as many Bitcoiners explained to me,
[00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.580]   but it's not the way I, as a sovereign individual,
[00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.900]   choose to walk in this life.
[00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.420]   By the way, none of this podcast
[00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.700]   should be treated as financial advice.
[00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.780]   Before Nick kindly gifted me with $100 worth of Bitcoin
[00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:07.580]   in hardware form, I didn't own any.
[00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.700]   I'll probably buy some Bitcoin on Cash App, Coinbase,
[00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:14.620]   and other platforms, and also transfer to a hardware wallet
[00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.140]   just to learn how to do it.
[00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:17.500]   But other than that,
[00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.500]   I don't necessarily make wise investment decisions.
[00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.020]   Money is not a motivation for me personally.
[00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:24.740]   I try to avoid it, actually.
[00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.700]   I'm grateful for every day I'm alive,
[00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:29.340]   no matter how much money is in my bank account.
[00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:30.800]   For long stretches of my life,
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.180]   that number was very close to zero,
[00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.720]   and I was always fortunate to be free and happy.
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.260]   So I encourage you to listen to people much smarter than me
[00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.940]   for actual good financial advice.
[00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:45.580]   Here, I'm just exploring ideas.
[00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:48.860]   And as if this has not already gone on too long,
[00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:50.380]   let me please make another comment
[00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:54.500]   on the style of discourse among some Bitcoin maximalists
[00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:58.340]   on platforms like Twitter, that in my humble view,
[00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.800]   I may be wrong, but I believe is not conducive
[00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.540]   to the nuanced, empathetic exchange of ideas
[00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:06.980]   I very much look for and enjoy.
[00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.460]   Again, I appreciate their style of discourse.
[00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:12.600]   I think I understand the value of it, but it's not my thing,
[00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.620]   so I don't want to engage in it.
[00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.020]   I want to hear the quiet voices in the room.
[00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.260]   I look for people to inspire each other,
[00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.700]   and when we disagree, I look for disagreement
[00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:24.820]   that is grounded in respect and empathy.
[00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:28.380]   I think that mockery and derision destroys the possibility
[00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:30.420]   of those nuanced conversations.
[00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:34.060]   It drives away the quiet, thoughtful, empathetic voices,
[00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:37.060]   and I try to give those voices space to be heard,
[00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:42.060]   to shine, to exchange ideas, whether we agree or disagree.
[00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:45.220]   So if I happen to block you on Twitter,
[00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:47.460]   I block you with love.
[00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:50.060]   Honestly, I will never speak poorly of you
[00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:52.100]   or even think poorly of you.
[00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:53.900]   I would love to hang out in person,
[00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:57.980]   give you a big old hug, and talk about life over some beers.
[00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:00.900]   If you see or hear me say something stupid,
[00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:04.700]   which I'm sure I do often, or something you disagree with,
[00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:06.660]   and you still respect me as a human being,
[00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:09.420]   please show your love, as I always do to you,
[00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:12.900]   but also send me some links to blogs, books, videos,
[00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:17.100]   podcasts, where people describe why my stated idea
[00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:18.700]   may be totally wrong.
[00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:21.180]   I love this kind of long-form disagreement.
[00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:24.220]   I humble myself every day by reading books and blogs
[00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:26.620]   by people much smarter than me.
[00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:28.860]   Sometimes it strengthens my ideas,
[00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:32.940]   sometimes it totally changes them, but I always learn.
[00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:36.660]   This is a too long way of saying that I'm here,
[00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:39.980]   trying to walk with grace and with an open mind,
[00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:43.420]   a bit of patience, and always love.
[00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:45.860]   If I make mistakes, cut me some slack.
[00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:49.580]   Like you, I'm only human, allegedly.
[00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:53.300]   This is the Lex Freeman Podcast,
[00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:56.540]   and here is my conversation with Nick Carter.
[00:07:56.540 --> 00:08:00.420]   What philosopher or philosophical idea
[00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:02.420]   had a big impact on your life,
[00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:05.380]   not just in the space of cryptocurrency, but in general?
[00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:07.420]   - Oh, so we're going now, we're rolling.
[00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:10.060]   - We're going right in, 'cause you majored philosophy.
[00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:12.100]   - I did, I majored philosophy.
[00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:14.140]   I didn't know what to do with my life,
[00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:16.580]   and my parents said, "Do whatever you find interesting."
[00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:18.700]   It's like, okay, philosophy, great.
[00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:19.900]   Find that interesting.
[00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:23.940]   And it had way more of an impact on my career, actually,
[00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:26.900]   than I thought it might.
[00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:28.380]   Typically, I guess, if you do philosophy,
[00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:30.540]   you go into law or finance, so it sort of makes sense.
[00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:35.420]   But there are a number of philosophers I really admire.
[00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:38.700]   One of my favorites would be Descartes,
[00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:41.780]   probably the notion of skepticism.
[00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:42.820]   It's sort of a rabbit hole.
[00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:45.620]   It's kind of hard to pull yourself out of it.
[00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:47.220]   Basically, the brain and the vat theory,
[00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:48.980]   pulling yourself out of that.
[00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:52.060]   But yeah, I really like epistemology,
[00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:54.160]   questioning what it is to have knowledge.
[00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:58.980]   So Descartes was one of my gateways to that.
[00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:00.780]   - Do you think everything is knowable?
[00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:05.780]   Like we humans can know fully the objective reality?
[00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:07.220]   - Oh, definitely not.
[00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:10.540]   No, I mean, reality is very much processed
[00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:13.860]   through your own subjective lens.
[00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:17.140]   - So how much do you think do we understand
[00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:18.780]   about this world?
[00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:20.140]   Because a lot of your ideas,
[00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:22.820]   a lot of the things we might talk about today
[00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:25.260]   are kind of trying to figure out human civilization,
[00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:29.020]   how human behavior works at scale,
[00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:30.540]   all those kinds of things.
[00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:32.960]   That kind of assumes that we have it
[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:36.580]   or we're able to somehow figure most of it out.
[00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:41.020]   So in your sort of, when you step way back,
[00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:43.660]   how much of it have we really figured out?
[00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:45.780]   - Well, I think that's the conceit of economics
[00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:49.420]   is thinking that you can model human behavior
[00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:52.500]   in these unbelievably complex systems.
[00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:55.300]   And then I think that's the modern critique of economics,
[00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:57.660]   like the sort of Talebian critique
[00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:00.000]   is that you can't have true knowledge
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.420]   and they're much less predictable than we think they are.
[00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:07.820]   And we behave according to our accumulated assumptions
[00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:09.980]   and we're using tiny sort of data sets
[00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:12.600]   trained on the last 50, 100 years,
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:15.340]   and they turn out to be horribly askew.
[00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:19.140]   And that's when we have our gray swans and our black swans.
[00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:23.100]   So I'm much more on the sort of,
[00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:26.860]   reality is much less notable than we think side of things.
[00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:29.260]   But it is nice to have very concrete things like Bitcoin,
[00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:30.240]   that's for sure.
[00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:33.280]   - Oh, so you think, so most of it is shaky ground,
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:36.900]   but there are some things, there's like islands of sturdiness
[00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:38.460]   and Bitcoin is one of them.
[00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:40.340]   - That's a good way to put it, yeah.
[00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:42.060]   I mean, look at the dollar system,
[00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:44.560]   not to pivot this into the dollar right away, but.
[00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:45.620]   (Lex laughing)
[00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:47.220]   The dollar is like-- - That's the shaky ground?
[00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:48.500]   It's the dollar? - It's the most,
[00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:50.600]   who truly understands the dollar system?
[00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:54.460]   I mean, the totality of it, the Eurodollar system,
[00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:58.340]   the way that monetary policy interacts with the economy,
[00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:01.460]   is monetary issuance inflationary?
[00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:04.620]   What's the relationship between unemployment and inflation?
[00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:06.880]   Even policymakers don't understand these things,
[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:09.420]   economists don't seem to understand them.
[00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:11.380]   What is inflation, how do you define inflation?
[00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:14.960]   None of these things are really known or knowable.
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:16.740]   - So a lot of people kind of make a claim
[00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:18.540]   that there's a lot of manipulation possible
[00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:21.660]   with the dollar, with those currencies.
[00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:23.500]   If you couple that with the fact
[00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:25.540]   that people don't understand it,
[00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:28.500]   and yet there's claims that it being manipulated
[00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:30.740]   by centralized power,
[00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:33.980]   how do you bring those two ideas together?
[00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:36.660]   If no one understands it, how can you manipulate it?
[00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:37.860]   - I think what we don't understand
[00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:41.660]   are the long-term consequences of our structures.
[00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:45.820]   So like the Fed's mandate to target unemployment
[00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:50.820]   and steady exchange rates or low inflation,
[00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:54.100]   what we don't understand is, okay,
[00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:57.740]   what is the result of doing that continuously for 40 years?
[00:11:57.740 --> 00:11:59.940]   What is the net effect of that?
[00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:03.740]   What is the consequence of the long-term accumulation of debt
[00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:06.260]   and basement interest rates?
[00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:09.180]   What is the net effect of that on society?
[00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:12.860]   We might understand there's much short-term features
[00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:15.800]   of the system, but I think it's the longer-term features
[00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:16.980]   we don't understand.
[00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:20.140]   - Do you think there's like malevolent people,
[00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:23.700]   like people that don't have good intent in central banks,
[00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:25.120]   like in the system?
[00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:30.660]   When you have centralized power in any forms,
[00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:35.940]   it's susceptible to somebody hacking the system,
[00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:38.700]   taking the power, and in the shadows,
[00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:40.900]   this is where conspiracy theories come in, right?
[00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:42.620]   In the shadows, be able to,
[00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:50.220]   have act out things that have a lot of negative impacts
[00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:52.160]   on a large percent of the population
[00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:54.700]   in greedy self-interest.
[00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:55.960]   Do you think there's people like that,
[00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:58.560]   or do you think fundamentally most people are good,
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:03.560]   even those associated with the sort of central banking?
[00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:06.260]   - I mean, I don't villainize those people.
[00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:09.080]   I think everyone is the hero of their own story, right?
[00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:11.880]   So they all believe that they're a force for good
[00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:13.920]   in the world, you have to.
[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:15.200]   Are there any true villains?
[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:16.040]   I don't think so.
[00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:19.020]   I think they get socialized into a world
[00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:22.680]   where they believe their particular skills
[00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:26.060]   and their mandate is what they should be doing.
[00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:29.600]   I think they might be presumptuous
[00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:31.840]   or arrogant in some cases.
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:36.400]   And I think it's more of a systemic issue
[00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:41.400]   where you have a small handful of very homogenous types
[00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:45.300]   of people with PhDs from the same institutions
[00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:47.800]   that are brought up in the same cultural context
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:51.460]   that set policy and wield a tremendous amount
[00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:53.720]   of control over society.
[00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:55.680]   And I think they have this notion
[00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:57.720]   that you can tinker society,
[00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:59.520]   you can play with a few key variables
[00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:04.440]   and tinker society into a state that is desirable or good.
[00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:06.520]   And that's what they're trying to do.
[00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:09.760]   And I think the consequences of that can be pretty bad.
[00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:13.100]   But no, I don't think it's born out of malevolence.
[00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:15.080]   - There's an interesting idea.
[00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:16.640]   I think Michael Malis brought it up
[00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:19.400]   as a test whether you're on the left or the right.
[00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:23.600]   The question he asks, which is,
[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:26.240]   do you think some people are better than others?
[00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:31.560]   If you say yes, he claims you're on the right.
[00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:32.960]   If you start answering,
[00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:36.100]   if you start saying a lot of things,
[00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:40.400]   like you're on the left.
[00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:42.240]   So if you start explaining yourself,
[00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:45.440]   well, equivocating, yeah, that's a good term for it.
[00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:49.160]   I was really, so in this test,
[00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:51.040]   I suppose I would be on the left
[00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:53.760]   because I'm uncomfortable with the idea
[00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:55.640]   that some people are better than others
[00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:59.120]   as a basic feeling, as a starting point
[00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:00.580]   in the way you think about the world.
[00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:03.320]   Because as we're talking about,
[00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:06.080]   everybody's a hero of their own story.
[00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:09.000]   When you start to think some people are better than others
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.620]   as a starting axiom,
[00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:16.120]   it's like a slippery slope to where
[00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:20.960]   you think you're way better than others.
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:23.240]   And then you start to like, basically,
[00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:27.000]   it's okay to take advantage of a large percent
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.920]   of the population for the greater good.
[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:30.740]   - Totally.
[00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:33.740]   - And then you go into Stalin mode and Hitler mode,
[00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:36.000]   where it's okay to murder a large part
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.840]   of the population for the greater good.
[00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:42.160]   So it's this very dangerous, slippery slope in my mind.
[00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:45.880]   So I try to not, yeah, I was always uncomfortable
[00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:48.080]   with that kind of test or even that kind of thought.
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:50.400]   And yes, the same applies, I suppose,
[00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:53.120]   in government, in central banking,
[00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:57.320]   is if you think some people are better than others,
[00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:59.800]   applying your idea of what is good
[00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:03.780]   can have large-scale detrimental effects.
[00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:05.280]   - Of course.
[00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:07.380]   I'm glad you didn't pose me the question.
[00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:08.480]   (both laughing)
[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:12.260]   I mean, I think maybe the left-right axiom isn't,
[00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:16.620]   the disjunction isn't the way I would sort of put it,
[00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:20.060]   but to me, it's just,
[00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:22.400]   if you reason in a consequentialist way,
[00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:25.340]   that lends itself to authoritarianism,
[00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:28.780]   whereby you think you can shape society
[00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:32.000]   and only you can shape society in a positive direction
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.320]   according to your specific objectives.
[00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:40.580]   So let's step onto the land of sturdiness, that is Bitcoin.
[00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:44.080]   What is Bitcoin, and in your view,
[00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:46.340]   what are the principles,
[00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:49.540]   the philosophical foundations of Bitcoin?
[00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:52.380]   - Well, Bitcoin, the term, I think,
[00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:54.500]   refers to two things specifically.
[00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:58.380]   So one is the protocol for conveying value
[00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:00.380]   through a communications channel.
[00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:03.340]   So just a set of rules that we collectively opt into
[00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:08.940]   in order to transact online or just at a distance.
[00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:13.020]   And then the other thing is the name of the asset,
[00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:14.740]   the sort of monetary unit
[00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:17.460]   which circulates within the system.
[00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:19.260]   And that always confused people a lot,
[00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:21.220]   'cause it's like, well, you've got uppercase Bitcoin,
[00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:22.940]   lowercase Bitcoin.
[00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:25.860]   Why didn't Satoshi just give them different names?
[00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:28.740]   Like in Ethereum, you've got Ethereum, the system,
[00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:30.180]   and then Ether,
[00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:32.220]   although people don't really talk about Ether very much,
[00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:36.300]   but they chose to distinguish them.
[00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:40.460]   In Bitcoin, for whatever reason, they're not distinct.
[00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:43.280]   So the two Bitcoins get co-mingled all the time
[00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:44.780]   in the explanations.
[00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:47.700]   - Did you find that's a problem, that confuses things?
[00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:49.460]   I mean, what's really a distinction
[00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:51.500]   between the protocol and the currency?
[00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:55.140]   - Well, they are sometimes distinguished practically.
[00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:57.420]   Like you can transact with Bitcoin
[00:17:57.420 --> 00:17:59.860]   outside of the Bitcoin protocol, for instance.
[00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:05.060]   So you can transact with Bitcoin on Ethereum,
[00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:08.780]   or I have Bitcoin on an OpenDime here.
[00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:10.260]   This would be a Bitcoin transaction.
[00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:12.240]   It wouldn't settle on the Bitcoin network.
[00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:13.080]   - Do you mind explaining
[00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:15.020]   what you have on the table before us?
[00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:17.020]   - Yeah, so I brought you some presents.
[00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:17.860]   (laughs)
[00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:18.940]   - That's awesome.
[00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:19.940]   - This isn't a bribe.
[00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:21.660]   This is just a proof of concept.
[00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:26.660]   So this is basically a Bitcoin bearer instrument.
[00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:31.020]   So I put 100 bucks of Bitcoin on here.
[00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:33.060]   And to spend it, you have to basically
[00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:35.100]   physically destroy part of the device.
[00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:37.900]   You have to poke a hole and poke off
[00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:40.300]   one of the little transistors on this.
[00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:42.560]   So it can only be spent once.
[00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:47.380]   And you can't extract the private key from this device.
[00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:49.100]   So the private key was generated on device,
[00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:50.820]   always stays on the device.
[00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:55.820]   So what it means without breaking off a small part.
[00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:59.920]   So this basically is a way
[00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:02.660]   to physically instantiate Bitcoin.
[00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:05.460]   So it's kind of clever.
[00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:06.640]   - It's basically gold.
[00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:07.900]   - Yeah, effectively.
[00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:08.860]   So here.
[00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:09.700]   - Thank you so much.
[00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:10.660]   - This one's limited edition.
[00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:11.540]   It's orange.
[00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:14.500]   - So what is it called again?
[00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:15.700]   - OpenDime.
[00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:17.660]   The point is, if you wanted to settle
[00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:19.620]   a Bitcoin transaction instantly,
[00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:22.240]   the kind of same way that a cash transaction
[00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:24.140]   is instant final settlement, right?
[00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:27.100]   You would do it with a device like this.
[00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:29.640]   So if I was buying a house from you,
[00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:35.120]   you might prefer to do it with a physical bearer instrument
[00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:37.460]   as opposed to waiting for a confirmation
[00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:39.620]   on the Bitcoin blockchain.
[00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:41.940]   So the moment I hand that over to you,
[00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:44.560]   goes in your possession, you're the owner,
[00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:46.940]   there's no way for me to have retained the private key.
[00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:49.540]   Like I could have created a Bitcoin paper wallet
[00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:52.300]   and given that to you, but you have no assurance
[00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:55.860]   that I didn't copy down the key elsewhere.
[00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:57.300]   So this solves that problem basically.
[00:19:57.300 --> 00:19:59.260]   - So this is a physical instantiation
[00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:04.260]   of the Bitcoin transaction outside the Bitcoin protocol.
[00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:05.780]   - That's right.
[00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:07.340]   - So you're transacting the currency
[00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:08.180]   outside of the protocol.
[00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:10.060]   - So it's analog Bitcoin.
[00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:13.120]   We're rendering it analog, which I always liked
[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:15.500]   'cause Bitcoin is this immaterial thing.
[00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:18.260]   And so it's nice to have physical totems.
[00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:20.860]   - How much does it cost to manufacture this, do you know?
[00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:22.500]   - Like 15 bucks or something.
[00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:25.820]   - So this is just kind of almost like
[00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:28.900]   a philosophical statement versus something
[00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:32.220]   that's scalable for use.
[00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:35.980]   The point of Bitcoin is to be in the digital space, right?
[00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:39.140]   But this shows like Bitcoin can be anywhere.
[00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:41.620]   - It's useful for gifts, but yeah, I mean,
[00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:44.700]   I don't know if it would be a suitable foundation
[00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:46.700]   for a physical Bitcoin economy.
[00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:49.180]   - In theory, these would be like cash-like instruments
[00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:50.620]   that you could use to transact.
[00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:52.460]   - Well, I just mean post-apocalypse.
[00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:55.900]   - Yeah, yeah, but you still need to plug it
[00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:58.260]   into your laptop to actually verify
[00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:00.540]   that there's coins on there.
[00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:02.100]   So you still need the internet.
[00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:06.460]   - So I have to take your word for how much money is on here.
[00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:10.540]   - No, I mean, you can plug it into your laptop and check.
[00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:14.380]   - But to transact, to extract Bitcoin from this,
[00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:15.540]   I need to break.
[00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:18.620]   - Yeah, you have to poke a hole through the little hole
[00:21:18.620 --> 00:21:21.620]   and that renders it spendable, basically.
[00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:25.460]   So that's protection against you spending it
[00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:27.700]   and then representing that it's still loaded.
[00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:29.700]   - That's fascinating, cool.
[00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:31.420]   - So the other thing I brought here,
[00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:34.180]   basically dice, 12-sided.
[00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:37.700]   They don't have any Bitcoin on them.
[00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:40.380]   So they just have a bunch of different critiques
[00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:41.940]   of Bitcoin on each side.
[00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:43.780]   (laughing)
[00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:44.940]   - We'll go through them then.
[00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:46.180]   - This is awesome.
[00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:48.340]   - I don't know if we have time to do all 11
[00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:50.700]   'cause there's one with my phone's logo on it.
[00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:54.100]   But it's just basically a tongue-in-cheek joke
[00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:56.980]   that the critiques of Bitcoin are so formulaic
[00:21:56.980 --> 00:21:59.500]   at this point that you can just put them on dice.
[00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:02.820]   It's silly.
[00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:05.540]   - Well, some of them might be topics
[00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:06.900]   for interesting conversations.
[00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:10.060]   - Oh yeah, you can even arrange the conversation that way.
[00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:12.260]   You can roll the dice and see what you get.
[00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:14.140]   - All right, but first,
[00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:17.620]   the philosophical foundations of Bitcoin.
[00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:21.540]   How do you see Bitcoin outside of just a basic protocol
[00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:23.020]   and a basic currency?
[00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:24.740]   It seems to be, like you said,
[00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:27.380]   it seems like sturdy ground.
[00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:28.980]   So what do you mean by this?
[00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:30.940]   - Yeah, so it's not just any protocol
[00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:32.020]   for moving value around.
[00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:33.180]   It's not just any currency.
[00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:38.180]   It's got specific rules and values that are embedded in it.
[00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:39.780]   And this is an important point,
[00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:44.140]   Bitcoin is the encoding of certain values,
[00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:48.740]   which are often misunderstood or not acknowledged necessarily.
[00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:53.100]   And so it's sort of impregnated with values.
[00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:55.340]   And what they are specifically is a topic of debate.
[00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:59.420]   And there have been civil wars fought over the values
[00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:00.980]   inherent in Bitcoin.
[00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:05.300]   One of them was, should Bitcoin be this cheap, scalable,
[00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:08.380]   the base layer, low-fee payments system
[00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:10.420]   with an emphasis on P2P payments?
[00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:15.420]   Or should it be more of this gold-like digital commodity
[00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:19.580]   that would eventually settle infrequently
[00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:21.460]   and mainly between institutions?
[00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:24.420]   So that's fundamentally a conflict of visions.
[00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:30.460]   So keep in mind that this is just one man's opinion.
[00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:31.780]   I don't speak for Bitcoin.
[00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:37.260]   So I would say the key number one value
[00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:38.420]   that's embedded in Bitcoin
[00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:41.940]   is the notion of non-discretionary monetary policy.
[00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:44.300]   So algorithmic monetary policy
[00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:47.300]   as opposed to human-based monetary policy.
[00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:48.900]   Satoshi was very clear about that.
[00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:52.620]   Bitcoin is an alternative to modern central banking
[00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:56.340]   where you have constant tweaking, constant intervention,
[00:23:56.340 --> 00:24:00.340]   which Satoshi felt leads to credit bubbles and so on.
[00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:02.580]   So Bitcoin proposes
[00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:05.560]   a completely non-discretionary monetary policy,
[00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:08.980]   sort of decays over time.
[00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:11.580]   50% of the coins were issued in the first four years
[00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:14.580]   and then the next 25% in the next four years,
[00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:17.060]   then 12.5% in the next four years
[00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:19.340]   until you get to 21 million units.
[00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:21.180]   And none of those numbers really matter.
[00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:23.300]   Like it could have been 25 million units
[00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:25.500]   and it could have been a more aggressive slope
[00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:27.180]   or a more gradual slope.
[00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:30.980]   But what matters is that this schedule was proposed
[00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:34.020]   even before the code was public,
[00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:35.780]   the schedule was proposed.
[00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:38.440]   And then we all collectively agreed to stick to it.
[00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:43.120]   And that is kind of a first for monetary system.
[00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:45.660]   I mean, gold kind of has that property, right?
[00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:48.340]   'Cause the supply of gold above ground
[00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:50.980]   only really increases at 1% to 2% a year.
[00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:54.340]   So it's sort of inhuman, which is a good feature, right?
[00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:57.380]   You don't want to give humans that much control over it.
[00:24:57.380 --> 00:25:02.380]   Bitcoin is a much more fastidious approach to that.
[00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:07.500]   It really is super concrete about what the supply schedule is
[00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:09.860]   and the fact crucially that it can't change.
[00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:13.420]   So we can't have a bailout of debtors.
[00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:14.820]   It was a lot of people,
[00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:17.900]   let's say a lot of people had debts denominated in Bitcoin
[00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:20.700]   and we needed loose accommodative monetary policy
[00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:21.780]   to bail them out.
[00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:22.700]   That's not possible.
[00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:26.420]   We couldn't have a Jubilee denominated in Bitcoin
[00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:28.500]   because the social contract that we've all
[00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:32.020]   bought into and committed to
[00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:34.540]   is that it's non-discretionary.
[00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:36.700]   So that's sort of one of the first things.
[00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:40.380]   And I think ultimately that comes back to
[00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:44.140]   basically a strong respect for property rights.
[00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:47.180]   Because if we were to have unanticipated inflation,
[00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:50.300]   let's say, a really charismatic leader somehow
[00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:52.340]   commandeered Bitcoin and convinced everyone
[00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:55.220]   that we should have 30 million units and not 21 million,
[00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:58.780]   that would basically be dilutive on everybody
[00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:03.700]   that held Bitcoin and had opted into the 21 million
[00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:05.740]   set of coins.
[00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:07.940]   An additional 9 million unanticipated
[00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:10.260]   would have a dilutive effect on everyone else.
[00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:12.460]   And that would be a covert way of effectively
[00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:14.820]   stealing their purchasing power through inflation.
[00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:16.300]   - Is that possible, that kind of thing?
[00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:19.220]   I mean, what's the mechanism of Bitcoin
[00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:22.220]   that resists that kind of charismatic leader?
[00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:26.220]   - Well, we've had people that have had a lot of influence
[00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:27.380]   in Bitcoin in the past
[00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:29.980]   and they've tried to make changes to the protocol.
[00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:32.320]   Not as dramatic as that,
[00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:35.740]   but Bitcoiners have generally resisted
[00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:38.780]   those individuals, institutions.
[00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:41.140]   And Bitcoiners have a good track record
[00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:44.660]   of sort of staying true to those core values.
[00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:47.500]   - So you mentioned values
[00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:50.820]   and sticking to the monetary thing,
[00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:52.420]   but there's bigger values.
[00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:55.820]   There's almost psychological values
[00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:57.500]   that are instilled in Bitcoin.
[00:26:57.500 --> 00:27:01.780]   You make a point that Bitcoin for many is a vessel, quote,
[00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:04.640]   for their expectations, hopes, and dreams.
[00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:10.500]   Can the Bitcoin protocol support this kind of complexity
[00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:12.260]   of the human condition?
[00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:15.900]   So like, there's ideas of freedom
[00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:17.940]   that seem to be spoken about.
[00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:20.020]   There's a sort of ideas of,
[00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:24.100]   I mean, even love. (laughs)
[00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:24.940]   - Yeah.
[00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:26.860]   - I mean, some people kind of use it as a meme,
[00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:29.780]   like, you know, Bitcoin is love or something like that,
[00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:32.300]   you know, mostly to troll me
[00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:34.100]   because I talk about love all the time.
[00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:36.660]   But, you know, these bigger ideas
[00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:41.140]   than just the exchange of currencies.
[00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:45.380]   - Yeah, I mean, Bitcoin itself is very simple, I would say.
[00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:49.020]   Like, ultimately, it doesn't, you know,
[00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:50.500]   pretend to do very much.
[00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:52.500]   It really just settles transactions.
[00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:58.160]   But people do superimpose their own views on it, for sure.
[00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:04.460]   And Bitcoin's qualities give rise to these perceptions
[00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:06.460]   of it having censorship resistance
[00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:08.540]   or giving you transactional freedom
[00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:12.220]   or a measure of transactional privacy.
[00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:16.700]   So because anyone can operate a node
[00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:18.460]   and join the consensus process,
[00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:22.240]   and because mining is a competitive free market process,
[00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:25.100]   that means that it's likely
[00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:28.180]   that you can't be censored by the miners.
[00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:30.020]   So that means you have transactional freedom.
[00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:32.620]   So you have these computer science,
[00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:34.060]   technical features of the system
[00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:36.480]   that cause it to have these political qualities,
[00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:39.620]   which is, it's very hard or impossible
[00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:41.720]   to censor a specific individual.
[00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:46.880]   So it's interesting to see that flow.
[00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:48.660]   So that's one of the core values, for sure,
[00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:51.060]   is the censorship resistance.
[00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:53.740]   Then you have the fact that it's a cryptographic-based
[00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:57.340]   system, and you can hold value in your brain
[00:28:57.340 --> 00:29:00.340]   by memorizing 12 words, for instance.
[00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:02.660]   That gives it seizure resistance,
[00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:04.580]   which is, again, a political concept.
[00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:08.260]   If you wanted to desert your jurisdiction
[00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:11.220]   with your wealth intact in your brain,
[00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:14.740]   you know, that cryptographic feature of the system,
[00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:17.500]   the fact that it's built on public-key cryptography,
[00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:20.700]   and that you can encode a Bitcoin private key
[00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:25.220]   in 12 words, that gives it this political salience
[00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:30.220]   that you're now empowered relative to a dustbot, basically.
[00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:33.860]   - Yeah, I mean, there's so many beautiful concepts
[00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:37.300]   behind cryptocurrency, behind Bitcoin,
[00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:39.780]   that stand for sort of freedom,
[00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:42.760]   some of the basic things at the founding of this country.
[00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:45.220]   The one thing I don't like, personally,
[00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:48.540]   behind Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies,
[00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:50.740]   is that money's involved, and it's like
[00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:53.700]   people's life savings sometimes are involved.
[00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:58.200]   So there is naturally a kind of fear,
[00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:02.360]   a self-preservation, like, instinctual,
[00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:05.300]   kind of dogmatic thing that comes in,
[00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:08.460]   where you're not the best of human nature.
[00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:10.740]   You stop being a George Washington,
[00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:14.580]   and you lose touch of the foundational principles,
[00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:15.740]   which I think are beautiful,
[00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:18.100]   just like the founding principles of this country.
[00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:21.660]   So that's just like, so I like staying
[00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:24.340]   on the level of the philosophy,
[00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:27.140]   versus the level of, like,
[00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:29.540]   all my money is invested in Bitcoin.
[00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:32.860]   And that becomes very tricky territory
[00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:37.860]   to have principled discussions about ideas.
[00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:39.620]   - Well-- - It's an interesting tension.
[00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:40.860]   - I try to stay balanced,
[00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:44.220]   despite being very exposed to Bitcoin, so.
[00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:47.420]   - Let me ask the ridiculous question, just in case.
[00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:49.380]   Who is Satoshi Nakamoto?
[00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:50.480]   - We don't-- - And is it you?
[00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:51.480]   - We don't know.
[00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:54.580]   It's probably not me, because I was,
[00:30:54.580 --> 00:31:00.380]   like, 17 when Satoshi invented Bitcoin.
[00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:03.020]   16, so unlikely.
[00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:05.540]   And also, I'm not really a programmer, so.
[00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:08.740]   There's a lot of theories, but honestly,
[00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:10.540]   it's one of the greatest mysteries of all time,
[00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:13.620]   because even Bitcoiners that have been around
[00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:16.940]   since day one, really, you know,
[00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:19.300]   people that were around before Bitcoin came out,
[00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:20.480]   they're on the mailing list,
[00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:23.040]   they were active in the cypherpunk community.
[00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:25.980]   You ask them, and they sincerely will not know.
[00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:27.900]   And they may not even have a good guess
[00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:29.340]   as to who Satoshi is.
[00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:30.380]   - Is it important to know,
[00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:33.060]   or is it, like, actually important not to know?
[00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:34.980]   Do you think that's a feature or bug that you,
[00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:35.980]   we don't know?
[00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:37.780]   - Some people don't like the uncertainty,
[00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:40.300]   especially, you know, folks on Wall Street,
[00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:42.200]   they really want to know.
[00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:45.000]   And if you read the Coinbase S1,
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.920]   their disclosure, pre-IPO, that's a risk factor
[00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:51.000]   that Satoshi could come back.
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:55.040]   So the risk management crowd wants to know,
[00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:57.960]   because they want to know if maybe Satoshi had,
[00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:00.920]   you know, undesirable political opinions or something
[00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:02.880]   that would forever taint the project.
[00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:05.000]   - Do you think they were just trolling with that risk,
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.840]   with Satoshi's identity being a risk factor,
[00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:11.400]   or is that, like, actual, like,
[00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:13.480]   was there an actual meeting and a discussion
[00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:15.080]   of that being a risk factor?
[00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:17.920]   - I think in the risk factor sections of the prospectuses,
[00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:20.240]   it's really just the lawyers doing a total brain dump
[00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:22.240]   to cover absolutely everything they can think of.
[00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:24.300]   - So it's just lawyers, it's not like,
[00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:28.820]   you know, it's like, I think Elon was somewhere
[00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:31.400]   in the legal documents for SpaceX,
[00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:34.600]   mentioned that, like, Earth governments
[00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:36.400]   have no jurisdiction on Mars.
[00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:37.280]   - Yeah. - Like, they threw
[00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:39.120]   that in there, and it feels like,
[00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:40.240]   yeah, that could be lawyers,
[00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:42.360]   but it could also just be Elon trolling.
[00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:43.180]   - Yeah.
[00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:46.240]   - I wonder if it's, like, the Coinbase folks trolling,
[00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:49.040]   or if it's lawyers.
[00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:51.640]   I hope it's the trolling, not the lawyers.
[00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:52.880]   - The Coinbase leadership,
[00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:56.140]   they're not as big trolls as Elon is,
[00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:58.600]   but, I mean, it's a risk, for sure,
[00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:00.720]   from their perspective, because,
[00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:03.240]   let's say Satoshi returned, doesn't seem likely,
[00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:05.900]   and let's say they decided to spend all their coins,
[00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:07.580]   which also seems very unlikely.
[00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:11.240]   That's, you know, rumored to be,
[00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:16.240]   or estimates have it at one to 1.2 million Bitcoin,
[00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:20.840]   which is, like, 50, $60 billion worth.
[00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:24.000]   So, some people consider that to be a risk.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   - You think it's, you know,
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.620]   this is almost like a topic of leadership.
[00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:30.440]   It doesn't feel like anybody,
[00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:32.660]   any one person speaks for Bitcoin.
[00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:38.720]   There's not even, like, prominent figures.
[00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:40.760]   Like, you have, for, like, Ethereum,
[00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:42.040]   you have Vitalik Buterin.
[00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:46.400]   There's a lot of, like, top minds
[00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:48.600]   talking about it, like, yourself,
[00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:51.080]   but it's not, like, one or two.
[00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:53.720]   Do you think, again, is that a feature or a bug?
[00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:55.960]   Like, do you think for effective,
[00:33:55.960 --> 00:34:00.640]   for Bitcoin to effectively have a role in society
[00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:04.500]   that, like, is as large or larger than the dollar,
[00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:08.980]   there needs to be, like, leadership that represents it,
[00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:11.000]   almost like democratic kind of thing?
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.440]   - Well, that's a real counterintuitive point,
[00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:15.480]   because most Bitcoiners, including myself,
[00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:17.400]   would say, no, the lack of leadership
[00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:19.840]   is a great quality to have.
[00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:21.640]   Because if you have a charismatic leader
[00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:25.040]   and a foundation or corporation that controls it,
[00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:27.600]   maybe they can control the features of the protocol,
[00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:31.720]   and maybe they can expropriate holders of the coin,
[00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:34.600]   or, you know, build in an endowment
[00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:38.900]   that pays them off and gives them privileged access
[00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:40.640]   to the units of the coin, for instance.
[00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:45.400]   So, you know, we call people that have privileged access
[00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:48.800]   to the money spigot, Cantillon insiders,
[00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:51.040]   which is, there is this economist that pointed out
[00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:54.360]   that, as, you know, I think Richard Cantillon,
[00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:58.000]   that as money enters the economy, it has an uneven flow.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:01.840]   Right, and so you see this in the last decade or so,
[00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:05.160]   before that, too, the consequence of money printing
[00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:08.300]   in this country is people that own financial assets
[00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:10.800]   made a lot of money, and people that didn't, didn't.
[00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:13.340]   So you see that Cantillon insider,
[00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:15.440]   Cantillon outsider effect.
[00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:18.320]   And it's the same with a cryptocurrency,
[00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:20.340]   and many other alternative cryptocurrencies
[00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:23.360]   that do have these corporate entities,
[00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:25.380]   or these leaders and CEOs,
[00:35:25.380 --> 00:35:27.440]   they're able to make specific decisions
[00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:30.960]   regarding the protocol and the currency of the asset,
[00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:33.860]   the benefit themselves, their cronies, et cetera,
[00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:36.120]   and that's not a good feature to have.
[00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:39.640]   I mean, it does grant you, you know,
[00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:41.900]   the ability to orchestrate decisions
[00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:44.500]   in a faster and more efficient way,
[00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:47.240]   but long-term, what you're trying to optimize for,
[00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:48.940]   if you're creating a money,
[00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:51.500]   is monetary credibility and soundness.
[00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:54.300]   So you don't really want it changing all that often.
[00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:57.860]   And you don't want to have the appearance of, you know,
[00:35:57.860 --> 00:36:00.280]   these elites that are engaging in rent seeking
[00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:01.200]   or anything like that.
[00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:03.800]   So there's definitely people that are influential
[00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:05.520]   in Bitcoin, there's core developers
[00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:06.500]   that people listen to,
[00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:09.100]   because it's, I would say, a meritocracy, largely,
[00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:11.560]   and they're sort of self-appointed high priests
[00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:13.120]   of the protocol.
[00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:15.680]   I write a lot about Bitcoin, people listen to me,
[00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:19.300]   but it's a completely free market of ideas, right?
[00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:22.440]   I don't have any authority within Bitcoin whatsoever.
[00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:24.000]   I'm just a scribbler, you know?
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:24.840]   - You're just a scribbler.
[00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:25.680]   - Just a scribbler.
[00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:30.460]   - Well, so was Aristotle, and Socrates, and Nietzsche.
[00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:35.140]   Okay, at the high level, technically,
[00:36:35.140 --> 00:36:36.900]   how does Bitcoin work?
[00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:38.780]   Is there interesting things you could say,
[00:36:38.780 --> 00:36:41.960]   like what are miners, what are nodes, full nodes,
[00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:45.360]   what are blocks, what's proof of work?
[00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:47.820]   Is there a nice way to wrap up
[00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:50.660]   a clean explanation of the protocol?
[00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:54.500]   - Oh man, that could be another five hours.
[00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:57.580]   - Is there interesting, 'cause I'd love to talk to you
[00:36:57.580 --> 00:37:00.780]   about block size wars and sort of the politics,
[00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:03.340]   psychology, the principles around that,
[00:37:03.340 --> 00:37:04.620]   but sort of building up to that,
[00:37:04.620 --> 00:37:07.220]   it'd be nice to talk about how the thing works.
[00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:09.420]   - That's fair, I mean, and the block size wars
[00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:12.040]   are a really fascinating discussion
[00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:15.220]   of how governance debates intersect
[00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:16.820]   with technical features.
[00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:21.820]   So I guess we can, yeah, so basically,
[00:37:21.820 --> 00:37:26.620]   at the highest possible level, Bitcoin is a globally shared,
[00:37:26.620 --> 00:37:32.060]   it's really a replicated ledger that any participant
[00:37:32.060 --> 00:37:34.700]   that wants to be an equal peer on that ledger,
[00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:37.340]   they want to maintain that ledger
[00:37:37.340 --> 00:37:38.620]   and they wanna stay up to date
[00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:40.920]   with the global state of the ledger.
[00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:45.700]   And really any monetary system is just a ledger
[00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:47.500]   with physical cash.
[00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:52.860]   We benefit from the physical instantiation of the money.
[00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:54.420]   - So the physics is the ledger.
[00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:56.180]   - The physics is the ledger, right?
[00:37:56.180 --> 00:37:57.180]   Same with gold, right?
[00:37:57.180 --> 00:37:59.500]   You can't just produce new units of gold.
[00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:04.500]   So we trust that gold atoms are hard to create,
[00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:07.520]   although not impossible, right?
[00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:10.020]   You could fire a bunch of protons
[00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:13.180]   and whatever is the adjacent metal
[00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:15.740]   and create gold atoms, it'd be expensive.
[00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:17.620]   And the same with dollars,
[00:38:17.620 --> 00:38:19.640]   we trust that it's hard to counterfeit a dollar.
[00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:22.300]   So we trust the physical analog world
[00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:24.820]   to help maintain the state of that ledger.
[00:38:24.820 --> 00:38:29.480]   With digital money, like the money in your bank account,
[00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:31.140]   your checking account,
[00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:34.540]   we basically trust our institutions or banking institutions
[00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:36.700]   to keep a faithful record.
[00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:38.780]   And then ultimately we trust the central bank
[00:38:38.780 --> 00:38:41.060]   to administer that system.
[00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:43.220]   So there's kind of a handful of nodes.
[00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:45.920]   In Bitcoin, we trust that the economic incentives
[00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:49.220]   of the system are carefully poised, basically.
[00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:53.820]   So we trust that the free market mining competition
[00:38:53.820 --> 00:38:56.940]   will lead to the miners assembling transactions
[00:38:56.940 --> 00:39:00.180]   into blocks in a faithful and correct way.
[00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:03.120]   And that we are gonna converge on a global state
[00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:05.020]   of the ledger continuously,
[00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:08.980]   which updates every 10 minutes or so with some variance.
[00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:12.060]   And then the miners aren't the sole entities
[00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:13.920]   that control the system.
[00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:16.660]   To really participate, if you're a merchant
[00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:18.220]   and you're accepting Bitcoin,
[00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:20.460]   you really wanna run your own full node
[00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:22.500]   and check the whole history of transactions,
[00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:24.500]   sort of something like,
[00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:26.780]   I wanna say five to 600 million transactions
[00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:28.580]   that have ever occurred on Bitcoin.
[00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:31.220]   - So full node contains all the transactions
[00:39:31.220 --> 00:39:35.700]   ever transacted on the Bitcoin blockchain.
[00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:39.620]   And that's, I saw it's like 200 gigs or something like that.
[00:39:39.620 --> 00:39:41.780]   - Like 350, something like that.
[00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:44.660]   It's doable on a regular consumer laptop,
[00:39:44.660 --> 00:39:47.940]   and that is gonna be really key later on in the discussion.
[00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:49.900]   - Sure. (laughs)
[00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:53.060]   - But so, that's really the ultimate trust models.
[00:39:53.060 --> 00:39:54.460]   First of all, we trust that the miners
[00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:56.440]   that assemble transactions into blocks
[00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:59.060]   and they are the archivists,
[00:39:59.060 --> 00:40:02.140]   they inscribe those transactions onto the ledger,
[00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:04.340]   and they have an economic incentive
[00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:05.660]   to sort of behave correctly
[00:40:05.660 --> 00:40:08.740]   'cause they're getting paid in no units of Bitcoin.
[00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:09.860]   That's part of it.
[00:40:09.860 --> 00:40:12.740]   But then really you are also,
[00:40:12.740 --> 00:40:14.020]   you're not fully trusting them.
[00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:15.500]   You're actually, if you wanna run a node,
[00:40:15.500 --> 00:40:17.460]   you replay every single transaction
[00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:20.020]   in the history of Bitcoin from the beginning
[00:40:20.020 --> 00:40:21.340]   to the current day,
[00:40:21.340 --> 00:40:23.900]   and you arrive at the present state that way.
[00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:25.720]   So you don't really have to trust
[00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:28.120]   too many people or entities.
[00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:30.440]   You can validate the correctness
[00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:32.760]   of that all the rules have been followed,
[00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:34.120]   that all the Bitcoins that were created
[00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:36.760]   were done so in the valid way,
[00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:39.640]   that the inflation rate was adhered to,
[00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:42.320]   and that there's no covert inflation,
[00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:46.080]   that if you're spending 50 units of Bitcoin,
[00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:50.180]   you had that Bitcoin to spend in the first place.
[00:40:50.180 --> 00:40:52.720]   So it's sort of delicately poised
[00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:56.220]   between node operators who engage
[00:40:56.220 --> 00:40:57.840]   in this validity checking,
[00:40:57.840 --> 00:40:59.840]   kind of anti-counterfeiting checking,
[00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:01.040]   and then also the miners,
[00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:03.280]   which are an industrial entity,
[00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:06.040]   and they basically produce block space
[00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:08.760]   and assemble transactions into blocks.
[00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:11.760]   - And everybody, so the miners are incentivized
[00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:13.600]   to not mess with the system
[00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:15.480]   because they're gaining value from the system.
[00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:16.520]   So if they mess with it,
[00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:20.080]   it's going to decrease the value
[00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:23.240]   of their physical work investment.
[00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:26.200]   - Yeah, so they have to incur a real physical cost
[00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:28.160]   to produce a block, right?
[00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:33.160]   So right now, you get 6.25 Bitcoins in a block
[00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:36.640]   at a minimum, and then maybe some fees as well.
[00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:38.660]   - How hard is it to produce a block now?
[00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:39.760]   - Well, challenging.
[00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:44.040]   I mean, you need, so 6.25 Bitcoins,
[00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:46.960]   and a Bitcoin's worth $55,000 or so.
[00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:48.680]   So it's probably going to cost you
[00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:51.720]   about that amount to produce it
[00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:53.720]   'cause it's a free market competition,
[00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:56.600]   and miners have very thin margins.
[00:41:56.600 --> 00:41:59.720]   So it's like if I auction off a dollar,
[00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:03.320]   you would pay up to 99 cents to buy that dollar from me.
[00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:05.960]   It's exactly what happens with miners.
[00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:09.840]   They're basically competing for the right
[00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:11.600]   to obtain new units of money.
[00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:14.440]   So logically speaking, they would pay up
[00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:16.720]   to the value of that money in order to earn it.
[00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:18.800]   - And for people who are not familiar,
[00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:21.320]   the process of mining is solving
[00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:23.640]   a difficult cryptographic problem.
[00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:25.560]   That's a computational problem.
[00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:28.320]   - I would say it's not like, people sometimes represent it
[00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:30.280]   as a really challenging puzzle.
[00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:32.840]   The individual puzzle is very simple.
[00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:35.200]   You can do it with pen and paper if you wanted,
[00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:37.280]   you know, like SHA-256.
[00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:38.920]   It's just that you're searching
[00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:40.600]   through the big mathematical space
[00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:43.160]   to find the needle in the haystack.
[00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:46.200]   You're just doing lots of iterations of a simple puzzle.
[00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:48.920]   - It's just brute force, hence like the stability
[00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:51.040]   of the whole idea of the proof of work.
[00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:55.480]   If there was a shortcut, it wouldn't work.
[00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:56.440]   - Exactly.
[00:42:56.440 --> 00:43:00.320]   So let's hope nobody solves SHA-256.
[00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:02.280]   - Yeah, there's a lot of discussions
[00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:03.740]   from the quantum computing space,
[00:43:03.740 --> 00:43:07.280]   but everybody I talk to, all my colleagues
[00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:10.040]   that work in quantum computers say
[00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:13.440]   that we're quite a long way away
[00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:16.560]   from that being an issue in cryptography
[00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:19.000]   and certainly an issue in cryptocurrency.
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:22.400]   - That should have been one of the sides on these dice.
[00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:23.240]   It should have been quantum.
[00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:24.240]   - Quantum.
[00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:25.180]   - I don't think it is.
[00:43:25.180 --> 00:43:27.440]   I forgot to put it on this edition.
[00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:29.440]   - People should check out Scott Aronson.
[00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:33.280]   There's a lot of people that are kind of
[00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:39.000]   selling quantum snake oil, so you should be very careful.
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:41.440]   I think it is a really exciting space
[00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:45.120]   that might change the world in the next decade
[00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:48.560]   or a couple hundred years,
[00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:51.320]   especially for simulating quantum mechanical systems.
[00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:54.400]   But in quantum machine learning,
[00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:56.800]   people should check out TensorFlow Quantum.
[00:43:56.800 --> 00:44:00.160]   It's a nice way to sort of educate yourself about the space.
[00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:02.320]   And actually, if you're pragmatically minded
[00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:06.200]   to, through software engineering,
[00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:09.040]   explore how you simulate quantum circuits,
[00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:11.360]   how you run machine learning on those quantum circuits.
[00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:15.040]   The main point that Scott makes, Scott Aronson,
[00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:16.920]   people should check out his blog too,
[00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:21.920]   is that there's not yet a single machine learning application
[00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:26.280]   that doesn't do almost as well on a classical computer.
[00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:30.740]   So it doesn't, like, yes, the dream is somehow
[00:44:30.740 --> 00:44:33.920]   quantum computers will change the nature
[00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:35.340]   of artificial intelligence,
[00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:39.400]   but there's yet to be an actual algorithm
[00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:44.400]   or a problem set or a data set where that would be the case.
[00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:47.960]   So skepticism is good in this space.
[00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:51.960]   Anyway, that said, so you kind of explained
[00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:53.520]   how Bitcoin works.
[00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:57.360]   You also wrote a blog post recently
[00:44:57.360 --> 00:45:00.840]   giving a shout out to the new book, "The Block Size Wars."
[00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:04.480]   What is a block size?
[00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:06.840]   - What are the block size wars?
[00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:08.880]   It's history, it's importance,
[00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:11.200]   it's philosophical foundations.
[00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:13.600]   - Yeah, I mean, Bitcoin, at this point,
[00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:16.620]   we have our own civil wars, if you're wondering
[00:45:16.620 --> 00:45:19.360]   about how politically intense it gets.
[00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:21.800]   - It's currently not hot, it's cold.
[00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:23.800]   - Oh yeah, we're in a detente right now.
[00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:25.080]   (both laughing)
[00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:27.320]   - There's no tanks or missiles,
[00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:28.960]   at least not yet, hopefully.
[00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:31.240]   - It can get a little violent, I guess.
[00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:33.680]   I think one of the Bitcoin core developers
[00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:35.800]   or one of the participants in the war
[00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:37.760]   got swatted at one point.
[00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:39.120]   - What's swatted means?
[00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:42.240]   - When someone does a fake phone call
[00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:44.080]   saying that you're holding someone hostage
[00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:46.680]   at your house and the SWAT team goes,
[00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:47.520]   it's pretty scary.
[00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:48.360]   (man sighs)
[00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:49.180]   - Wow.
[00:45:49.180 --> 00:45:51.200]   - Internet warfare tactic, yeah.
[00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:54.640]   But the block size war, I would say, effectively ended,
[00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:58.040]   although we're definitely gonna have more
[00:45:58.040 --> 00:46:00.400]   civil wars in Bitcoin for sure.
[00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:03.040]   But basically the core argument was
[00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:05.600]   a technical one on its surface,
[00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:09.080]   but a very deep political one at its core.
[00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:12.440]   The technical question is how many megabytes
[00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:15.640]   should be in each successive block?
[00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:18.360]   So Satoshi basically installed a limit
[00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:20.300]   of one megabyte per block.
[00:46:20.300 --> 00:46:21.940]   - So we should backtrack.
[00:46:21.940 --> 00:46:24.920]   There was no limit in the beginning.
[00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:28.480]   And it seems like Satoshi, what is this, 2000?
[00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:32.160]   The war started in what, 2017 or something like that?
[00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:33.000]   I don't know when the--
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   - '15 was when the battle cries began.
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:40.120]   What was the first battle in the civil war?
[00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:41.000]   I don't remember.
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:45.040]   - But Satoshi, I don't know if you can comment on it,
[00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:47.960]   why did Satoshi set the limit to one megabyte
[00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:50.840]   all of a sudden, almost secretively?
[00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:55.180]   And in the beginning, there was no limit whatsoever.
[00:46:55.180 --> 00:46:56.880]   - Yeah, I mean, we can get into,
[00:46:56.880 --> 00:46:58.560]   and people have spent thousands of hours
[00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:01.840]   poring over Satoshi's writings to find
[00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:03.480]   which side Satoshi was on.
[00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:07.040]   And you can find, like any textual exegesis,
[00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:10.420]   you can find evidence for either side, right?
[00:47:10.420 --> 00:47:13.440]   But yeah, I mean, effectively when Bitcoin was launched,
[00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:16.200]   there was a block size, because if you made a block
[00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:19.200]   over a certain size with the first edition of the code,
[00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:22.120]   it would have crashed nodes.
[00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:24.640]   But then, yeah, in 2010, Satoshi added the one megabyte
[00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:28.600]   limit in a covert way with no comments or anything.
[00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:31.560]   And that stuck, basically.
[00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:34.720]   And then Bitcoin blocks filled up,
[00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:37.040]   and people that had been socialized
[00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:40.440]   into this vision of Bitcoin as an effectively free
[00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:43.480]   transactional network, like why pay a transaction fee
[00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:45.420]   if you're not at congestion?
[00:47:45.420 --> 00:47:47.220]   If the block isn't full, the miner will mine
[00:47:47.220 --> 00:47:48.860]   your transaction for free, right?
[00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:54.760]   People that had been brought up in that status quo
[00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:59.680]   from 2009 to 2015, they noticed the block started to fill up,
[00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:01.400]   and they're like, okay, well, let's just remove
[00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:03.000]   this arbitrary limit, right?
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:05.360]   What could possibly be the harm?
[00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:08.400]   And then a whole other faction said,
[00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:12.640]   no, you need to cap the data throughput of the system,
[00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:15.640]   because if you increase it, it's gonna be
[00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:18.720]   highly exclusionary, and ultimately,
[00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:21.520]   regular folks are not gonna be able to run a full node.
[00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:23.000]   - So there's a fixed number,
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:26.280]   there's a fixed frequency of blocks,
[00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:29.400]   and so if you wanna increase the number of transactions
[00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:32.640]   per second, you wanna increase the size of the block.
[00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:36.280]   So huge blocks allow you to shove in a lot of transactions.
[00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:37.840]   - Right. - Small blocks don't.
[00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:40.700]   So that's what you mean, like constraining the system.
[00:48:40.700 --> 00:48:43.680]   So what's the benefit of a small block size
[00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:48.140]   where transactions, when you can squeeze in
[00:48:48.140 --> 00:48:50.240]   only a small number of transactions,
[00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:52.800]   and what's the benefit of a huge block size
[00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:55.160]   where you can squeeze in a lot of transactions?
[00:48:55.160 --> 00:48:57.240]   - Well, it really comes down to the way
[00:48:57.240 --> 00:48:58.520]   that you think about the system.
[00:48:58.520 --> 00:49:02.280]   So a lot of people wanted Bitcoin to be Visa scale,
[00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:05.200]   so to have blocks sufficiently large
[00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:08.860]   that you could accommodate a Visa-level scale
[00:49:08.860 --> 00:49:10.160]   of transactions, so--
[00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:13.000]   - Which is many orders of magnitude more transactions.
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:15.800]   - That's right, I mean, preposterously larger
[00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:18.220]   in terms of data throughput than, you know,
[00:49:18.220 --> 00:49:20.800]   Bitcoin offers up, or at least it used to,
[00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:23.880]   144 megabytes of space per day,
[00:49:23.880 --> 00:49:26.760]   and your average transaction's 350 bytes.
[00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:29.680]   So, you know, you could, at a push,
[00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:34.160]   do four, 500,000 transactions a day, which is not many.
[00:49:34.160 --> 00:49:36.920]   So if you wanted to get to Visa scale,
[00:49:36.920 --> 00:49:40.360]   you'd have to increase blocks obnoxiously large.
[00:49:40.360 --> 00:49:45.040]   The small blockers claim that this would overwhelm
[00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:48.640]   the ability of any regular person to ingest that data
[00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:52.160]   and stay current at the, you know, state of the ledger
[00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:54.840]   to replay all those transactions
[00:49:54.840 --> 00:49:57.000]   to ensure that the protocol rules were valid.
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:00.740]   So basically, the small blocker contention is that
[00:50:00.740 --> 00:50:03.880]   you eliminate the trustlessness of the system
[00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:06.040]   by pushing a ton of data through the system
[00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:10.240]   because only one or two industrial heavy-duty nodes
[00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:14.080]   would ever be able to run the protocol at that point.
[00:50:14.080 --> 00:50:16.040]   - So, by the way, in the civil war,
[00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:18.760]   the two sides, as you're calling them,
[00:50:18.760 --> 00:50:23.160]   the small blocker and the big blocker sides.
[00:50:23.160 --> 00:50:27.800]   And so that takes us back to the thing that you mentioned,
[00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:30.880]   that a regular computer could be a node.
[00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:35.880]   And with big blocks, that's no longer going to be the case.
[00:50:35.880 --> 00:50:40.120]   So just the number of transactions is going to blow up
[00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:42.720]   the size of the blockchain
[00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:44.960]   that every full node has to store.
[00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:49.480]   And so then, as opposed to a regular mom and pop
[00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:53.200]   type of node, you're going to have to have data centers.
[00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:54.600]   So they're going to have to be owned
[00:50:54.600 --> 00:50:56.000]   by large organizations.
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:58.200]   There's going to have to be very few of them.
[00:50:58.200 --> 00:51:00.140]   And that's how you centralize the control
[00:51:00.140 --> 00:51:03.640]   over this whole operation.
[00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:08.640]   So the big blocker, yes, it allows you to be Visa
[00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:10.960]   and do a huge number of transactions,
[00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:12.080]   but it becomes centralized.
[00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:16.200]   And the small blockers, you cannot actually do
[00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:19.120]   kind of merchant style transactions,
[00:51:19.120 --> 00:51:21.960]   but you get the decentralized benefit.
[00:51:21.960 --> 00:51:24.160]   - Well, I don't even think the big block approach
[00:51:24.160 --> 00:51:26.160]   would allow you to be Visa, frankly,
[00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:28.440]   because there's effectively one node
[00:51:28.440 --> 00:51:31.040]   in the Visa network, right?
[00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:32.440]   So you don't really need to maintain
[00:51:32.440 --> 00:51:34.360]   this peer to peer architecture at all.
[00:51:34.360 --> 00:51:37.600]   And the amount of data you'd have to push through
[00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:39.440]   the network to reach Visa scale
[00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:41.440]   is a really preposterous amount.
[00:51:41.440 --> 00:51:45.320]   I mean, and we have now evidence for what happens
[00:51:45.320 --> 00:51:47.280]   when you try and scale up as a blockchain
[00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:49.200]   and do 10 million transactions a day,
[00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:51.340]   which is still not Visa scale, right?
[00:51:51.340 --> 00:51:57.160]   You know, I've seen what it's like to operate those nodes,
[00:51:57.160 --> 00:51:58.200]   and it's not pretty.
[00:51:58.200 --> 00:52:02.240]   So there are totally genuine computer science,
[00:52:02.240 --> 00:52:07.240]   physical limits, because it's a broadcast network.
[00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:10.960]   Everyone has to be aware of every transaction.
[00:52:10.960 --> 00:52:14.200]   And that model, which gives you the trustlessness,
[00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:16.600]   the nice guarantees where everyone's an equal peer
[00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:18.520]   on the network, everyone has audited
[00:52:18.520 --> 00:52:20.720]   the full history of the transactions,
[00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:23.300]   that model falls apart under stress.
[00:52:23.300 --> 00:52:27.560]   So the small blocker vision is that ultimately
[00:52:27.560 --> 00:52:30.540]   you would scale in a layered approach
[00:52:30.540 --> 00:52:32.060]   with the base layer transactions
[00:52:32.060 --> 00:52:34.640]   being settlement style transactions,
[00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:35.800]   and you know, payments happening
[00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:37.360]   at the other layers, basically.
[00:52:37.360 --> 00:52:40.140]   - Is that universally agreed upon,
[00:52:40.140 --> 00:52:43.040]   or like to a large degree agreed upon
[00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:47.520]   that the small blockers have won in this debate?
[00:52:47.520 --> 00:52:48.360]   - Well--
[00:52:48.360 --> 00:52:50.880]   - Where would you put the current state of affairs?
[00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:54.360]   - There was a wave of competing Bitcoin implementations
[00:52:54.360 --> 00:52:56.880]   starting in 2015 with Bitcoin XT.
[00:52:56.880 --> 00:53:00.200]   Actually, Gavin Anderson, who was the guy
[00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:03.760]   that Satoshi handed the reins to when Satoshi left,
[00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:07.240]   Gavin supported this large block proposal.
[00:53:07.240 --> 00:53:10.860]   And so that didn't achieve consensus,
[00:53:10.860 --> 00:53:13.180]   and then there was Bitcoin Unlimited,
[00:53:13.180 --> 00:53:17.700]   and then later on there was a genuine hard fork
[00:53:17.700 --> 00:53:19.900]   where the small blockers couldn't,
[00:53:19.900 --> 00:53:21.420]   or the large blockers couldn't push through
[00:53:21.420 --> 00:53:23.900]   their proposals on Bitcoin itself,
[00:53:23.900 --> 00:53:26.780]   so they just created a competing version of Bitcoin.
[00:53:26.780 --> 00:53:29.320]   - So by the way, maybe you can comment on,
[00:53:29.320 --> 00:53:31.500]   but sort of hard fork versus a soft fork,
[00:53:31.500 --> 00:53:35.420]   a hard fork is when it's no longer compatible.
[00:53:35.420 --> 00:53:37.240]   What's the right way to put it?
[00:53:37.240 --> 00:53:40.120]   They can't operate on the same blockchain,
[00:53:40.120 --> 00:53:41.320]   with the same protocol.
[00:53:41.320 --> 00:53:44.080]   - Yeah, so there's a few ways to define them,
[00:53:44.080 --> 00:53:46.820]   and it's pretty, it gets controversial as well,
[00:53:46.820 --> 00:53:50.860]   but one way to define it as a hard fork
[00:53:50.860 --> 00:53:54.160]   is a expansion of protocol rules,
[00:53:54.160 --> 00:53:57.440]   and a soft fork is a shrinking of protocol rules.
[00:53:57.440 --> 00:53:58.560]   - That's an interesting way to find it.
[00:53:58.560 --> 00:54:01.160]   - It's not very intuitive, so I don't like that way.
[00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:05.820]   Another way is that a hard fork is backwards incompatible,
[00:54:05.820 --> 00:54:09.340]   whereas soft fork is, in theory, backwards compatible.
[00:54:09.340 --> 00:54:13.780]   So in August 2017, basically the large blockers
[00:54:13.780 --> 00:54:16.300]   had had enough, and they said,
[00:54:16.300 --> 00:54:17.740]   "We're gonna hard fork Bitcoin,
[00:54:17.740 --> 00:54:19.920]   "we're gonna create a clone,
[00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:22.260]   "an alternative version of Bitcoin,
[00:54:22.260 --> 00:54:26.920]   "which has a shared history as Bitcoin itself,
[00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:30.480]   "but you completely fork it, and you create a new future."
[00:54:31.840 --> 00:54:34.980]   But everybody that had a balance on Bitcoin at the time
[00:54:34.980 --> 00:54:39.140]   also had a balance on the alternative coin, Bitcoin Cash,
[00:54:39.140 --> 00:54:40.460]   and so that was really--
[00:54:40.460 --> 00:54:43.000]   - That's why it's called Bitcoin Cash, is the hard fork.
[00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:45.100]   - That was one of them, there were more, actually.
[00:54:45.100 --> 00:54:46.060]   I mean, there are-- - What the heck
[00:54:46.060 --> 00:54:50.380]   is Bitcoin Satoshi's Vision BSV, Bitcoin SV?
[00:54:50.380 --> 00:54:53.220]   So this is all talking about increasing the max,
[00:54:53.220 --> 00:54:55.940]   the limit of the block size more and more and more.
[00:54:55.940 --> 00:54:58.140]   - Yeah, that was one of the changes
[00:54:58.140 --> 00:54:59.580]   they wanted to push through,
[00:54:59.580 --> 00:55:02.880]   but BSV was a fork of Bitcoin Cash, so--
[00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:04.200]   - Hard fork of Bitcoin Cash.
[00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:08.320]   - Yeah, so now there's multiple big blocker blockchains
[00:55:08.320 --> 00:55:09.160]   floating around, it's like--
[00:55:09.160 --> 00:55:10.640]   - What are your thoughts about them?
[00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:12.800]   - Well, I was-- - 'Cause they're pretty popular,
[00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:14.560]   sorry to interrupt.
[00:55:14.560 --> 00:55:15.400]   - Are they popular?
[00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:16.920]   I mean, if you look at the metrics, they're not,
[00:55:16.920 --> 00:55:20.160]   and they don't trade, they, I think,
[00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:22.920]   each trade below 1% of the value of Bitcoin itself.
[00:55:22.920 --> 00:55:24.760]   - I see, so measuring popularity is like
[00:55:24.760 --> 00:55:27.640]   how much they actually, oh, value,
[00:55:27.640 --> 00:55:28.840]   or the frequency of trade.
[00:55:28.840 --> 00:55:32.280]   - Oh, no, no, I mean, they do a fair number of transactions,
[00:55:32.280 --> 00:55:35.480]   but there's no way to know that that is genuine
[00:55:35.480 --> 00:55:38.580]   or just contrived, so ultimately,
[00:55:38.580 --> 00:55:40.200]   the true measure, I think, in my mind,
[00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:44.080]   is just where the market prices these protocols
[00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:48.340]   relative to Bitcoin, because that's a prediction market.
[00:55:48.340 --> 00:55:52.040]   If Bitcoin Cash was being priced at 50% of Bitcoin,
[00:55:52.040 --> 00:55:56.260]   you could say the market has given it a 50% chance
[00:55:56.260 --> 00:55:57.780]   of unseating Bitcoin, right?
[00:55:57.780 --> 00:56:00.960]   But both Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV,
[00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:04.600]   which was a hard fork from Bitcoin Cash itself,
[00:56:04.600 --> 00:56:06.480]   are well, I believe at this point,
[00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:08.920]   well below 1% of the value of Bitcoin.
[00:56:08.920 --> 00:56:12.900]   - And in the, in the ranking of different cryptocurrencies,
[00:56:12.900 --> 00:56:14.440]   what is it, Bitcoin Ethereum?
[00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:18.080]   Is Ethereum in value second? - Yeah, it's number two.
[00:56:18.080 --> 00:56:19.680]   - And then Bitcoin Cash is the one that,
[00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:23.100]   it's in the top five, right, but it's just a fast drop-off?
[00:56:23.100 --> 00:56:24.360]   - You know, I haven't checked lately,
[00:56:24.360 --> 00:56:27.460]   but I think it's reached kind of morbidity.
[00:56:27.460 --> 00:56:31.560]   You know, it doesn't really have much traction.
[00:56:31.560 --> 00:56:34.360]   The blocks aren't full, so the whole value proposition was,
[00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:36.940]   you know, we will get all this merchant adoption
[00:56:36.940 --> 00:56:38.400]   if we increase the block size.
[00:56:38.400 --> 00:56:40.320]   That just didn't materialize.
[00:56:40.320 --> 00:56:44.160]   In my view, they had a flawed vision of how adoption works
[00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:46.880]   and what blockchain should optimize for.
[00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:51.000]   Maybe you get a Bitcoin Cash supporter on the show,
[00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:52.960]   they'll give you a different answer.
[00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:55.360]   But yeah, full disclosure, you know, I have my sympathies,
[00:56:55.360 --> 00:56:59.440]   and I think the small blockers, one, that's girmish for sure.
[00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:02.120]   - So at this time, there's no merchant adoption and so on,
[00:57:02.120 --> 00:57:06.240]   so it's kind of, it's vision, the whole reason for existence,
[00:57:06.240 --> 00:57:08.760]   at least for now, hasn't materialized.
[00:57:08.760 --> 00:57:13.020]   And so that's a indication, it's possible that, well,
[00:57:13.020 --> 00:57:16.480]   it's a sign that perhaps that's the wrong way
[00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:18.760]   to accomplish the scalability.
[00:57:18.760 --> 00:57:20.640]   - Well, you know, first of all,
[00:57:20.640 --> 00:57:24.200]   I think the layered scaling model is definitely correct.
[00:57:24.200 --> 00:57:26.960]   I mean, that's absolutely the way these things have to work
[00:57:26.960 --> 00:57:29.040]   given the constraints of blockchains.
[00:57:29.040 --> 00:57:31.840]   - What is the layered scaling model?
[00:57:31.840 --> 00:57:34.120]   - It's really how all payment systems scale,
[00:57:34.120 --> 00:57:35.880]   blockchain or otherwise.
[00:57:35.880 --> 00:57:38.400]   And I think a lot of people don't understand this,
[00:57:38.400 --> 00:57:42.960]   is that there is no equivalent to scaling of the base layer
[00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:44.860]   in the regular payment space.
[00:57:44.860 --> 00:57:46.720]   That totally doesn't happen.
[00:57:46.720 --> 00:57:48.160]   All of them are built on layers.
[00:57:48.160 --> 00:57:51.640]   So Visa is like the fifth layer in the payment stack
[00:57:51.640 --> 00:57:54.600]   that ultimately depends on these utility scale
[00:57:54.600 --> 00:57:58.720]   settlement systems like Fedwire, Chips, ACH,
[00:57:58.720 --> 00:58:01.240]   basically interbank settlement systems.
[00:58:01.240 --> 00:58:03.940]   So you've got these slow moving,
[00:58:03.940 --> 00:58:07.520]   but high assurance settlement systems.
[00:58:07.520 --> 00:58:09.920]   Fedwire is probably the number one,
[00:58:09.920 --> 00:58:10.880]   like when you send a wire,
[00:58:10.880 --> 00:58:13.780]   that's using the Fedwire system typically.
[00:58:13.780 --> 00:58:16.560]   On top of that, you have banks
[00:58:16.560 --> 00:58:18.640]   and then you have payment processors.
[00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:20.840]   And then you build up these layers and layers and layers
[00:58:20.840 --> 00:58:22.640]   and then you have these fast payments,
[00:58:22.640 --> 00:58:27.640]   Venmo, PayPal, credit, debit, Visa, you name it.
[00:58:27.640 --> 00:58:30.600]   Those payments are not final when they occur.
[00:58:30.600 --> 00:58:33.240]   A credit card transaction will not be final
[00:58:33.240 --> 00:58:35.780]   for 90 to 120 days.
[00:58:35.780 --> 00:58:38.120]   So-- - That's fascinating.
[00:58:38.120 --> 00:58:40.000]   - You've decoupled the payment,
[00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:42.120]   the financial message and the settlement.
[00:58:42.120 --> 00:58:43.520]   Those are distinct concepts.
[00:58:43.520 --> 00:58:46.320]   And the settlement happens on a deferred basis.
[00:58:46.320 --> 00:58:49.000]   So that's how you get scalability
[00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:51.600]   is you have lots and lots of messages,
[00:58:51.600 --> 00:58:54.960]   but they don't settle for a long time.
[00:58:54.960 --> 00:58:58.800]   They might settle on a net basis, on an end of day basis.
[00:58:58.800 --> 00:59:00.880]   But so that's really how it works.
[00:59:00.880 --> 00:59:03.200]   And then you have Fedwire where your average transactions
[00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:04.960]   are the millions of dollars.
[00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:07.440]   And there's only a few hundred thousand transactions a day.
[00:59:07.440 --> 00:59:10.120]   That's sort of an interbank settlement network.
[00:59:10.120 --> 00:59:15.120]   So that's my vision for how I think Bitcoin will develop too.
[00:59:15.320 --> 00:59:17.760]   Bitcoin itself on the base layer
[00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:20.960]   is the slow moving high assurance final settlement network
[00:59:20.960 --> 00:59:21.800]   where if you're sending money
[00:59:21.800 --> 00:59:23.400]   to the other side of the globe,
[00:59:23.400 --> 00:59:25.280]   to someone you don't trust,
[00:59:25.280 --> 00:59:27.560]   where you want that payment to be final
[00:59:27.560 --> 00:59:29.360]   in a short period of time,
[00:59:29.360 --> 00:59:31.680]   and both counterparties know it's final,
[00:59:31.680 --> 00:59:33.200]   then you would use that.
[00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:34.400]   But if you wanted to buy coffee,
[00:59:34.400 --> 00:59:38.000]   you could do it on a second layer.
[00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:39.440]   Lightning would be one way.
[00:59:39.440 --> 00:59:41.620]   There's a bunch of side chains now.
[00:59:41.620 --> 00:59:46.260]   Or you could use a more centralized solution if you wanted.
[00:59:46.260 --> 00:59:47.940]   - It's kind of a profound idea
[00:59:47.940 --> 00:59:50.340]   that in the space of transactions,
[00:59:50.340 --> 00:59:52.260]   when you're buying coffee or buying anything really
[00:59:52.260 --> 00:59:54.780]   from a merchant or exchanging goods
[00:59:54.780 --> 00:59:56.900]   and all those kinds of things,
[00:59:56.900 --> 00:59:59.620]   that most of the time,
[00:59:59.620 --> 01:00:04.220]   like basic honest behavior, human behavior,
[01:00:04.220 --> 01:00:07.260]   which it does appear that most of our society
[01:00:07.260 --> 01:00:09.100]   is based on the fact that we're all,
[01:00:09.100 --> 01:00:10.640]   most of us are honest.
[01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:14.000]   Is like stuff is not gonna go wrong
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.720]   when you do the transaction.
[01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:18.720]   And you only need like the base layer,
[01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:19.560]   whether it's Bitcoin,
[01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:22.080]   whether it's, I forget the terms you use
[01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:24.080]   for the credit card version,
[01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:28.600]   but you need that just to verify,
[01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:33.600]   just to like resolve any disagreements or shady shit.
[01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:34.560]   - Yeah.
[01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:37.040]   - And that's a really rare occurrence.
[01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:39.400]   So it's okay for that to be handled
[01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:43.720]   in the small block debate,
[01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:46.000]   handled at a rate that's much, much lower
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.400]   than the rate of the transactions.
[01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:50.840]   That's a really interesting idea
[01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:53.080]   that when we spend money,
[01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:57.080]   we didn't actually exchange the money most of the time.
[01:00:57.080 --> 01:00:57.920]   - Yeah, most of the time,
[01:00:57.920 --> 01:00:59.400]   you're not getting final settlement
[01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:01.400]   when you do a transaction.
[01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:04.240]   And oftentimes that causes,
[01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:06.580]   there's pluses and minuses.
[01:01:06.580 --> 01:01:08.600]   On the plus side, you have huge efficiency
[01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:10.760]   if you use a credit network like Visa,
[01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:12.800]   but it's in the name credit, right?
[01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:14.960]   Visa is extending you credit, right?
[01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:16.760]   They're kind of guaranteeing your reputation
[01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:18.000]   to the merchant,
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.760]   but fraud happens all the time, right?
[01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:21.520]   There's always fraud
[01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:25.120]   because you have this reversibility, right?
[01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:29.080]   And so you can engage in fraud against a merchant.
[01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:32.440]   If you have a final settlement,
[01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:34.200]   there's no possibility for fraud.
[01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:37.280]   So that's one reason merchants kind of like accepting Bitcoin
[01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:40.960]   because once you receive an inbound Bitcoin payment
[01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:44.720]   and you deliver some good or service,
[01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:46.840]   that payment can't be reversed.
[01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:49.040]   But frankly, most of the transactions
[01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:52.200]   we undertake on a daily basis
[01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:56.080]   do not require those strong assurances of final settlement.
[01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:58.640]   There's one exception, which is physical cash.
[01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:01.080]   With physical cash or the open dime,
[01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:03.000]   a cash-like product,
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.520]   you actually are getting final settlement.
[01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:09.720]   But most online banking transactions,
[01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:14.720]   most P2P digital wallet transactions in the dollar system,
[01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:17.280]   they're not really final at all.
[01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:21.080]   - You mentioned Lightning, Lightning Network.
[01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:22.520]   What is it?
[01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:23.840]   What are your thoughts on it?
[01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:27.440]   And what are your thoughts about any kind of alternatives?
[01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:32.320]   - So Lightning is one potential payment solution
[01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:34.200]   built on top of Bitcoin
[01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:36.360]   where you have different assurances,
[01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:38.560]   different transactional assurances,
[01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:40.960]   but ultimately it's very proximate to the base layer.
[01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:42.560]   So if something goes wrong,
[01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:44.520]   you can always basically settle to the base layer.
[01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:45.600]   - Just layer two.
[01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:48.360]   - Yeah, layer two, you could say.
[01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:50.480]   And basically the intuition is
[01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:52.480]   it's kind of like opening a bar tab.
[01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:55.400]   So you go to the bar and you might drink a dozen beers
[01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:58.300]   over the course of the night, maybe half a dozen.
[01:02:58.300 --> 01:03:02.520]   And well, I guess nobody goes to the bar these days,
[01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:05.080]   but let's say you did.
[01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:07.920]   You open a tab and at the end of the night,
[01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:09.640]   you settle up once.
[01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:12.160]   You're not necessarily paying each time
[01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:14.140]   you get another beer.
[01:03:14.140 --> 01:03:15.520]   So it's the same idea.
[01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:16.640]   You're opening a channel,
[01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:19.640]   an ongoing relationship with your counterparty.
[01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:22.160]   And so Lightning has you open a channel
[01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:24.840]   with a counterparty and you're sort of sending back and forth
[01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:27.200]   these cryptographic commitments saying,
[01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:29.080]   I agree to send you some Bitcoin,
[01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:30.480]   but you don't necessarily settle
[01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:31.880]   each time you make a transaction.
[01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:33.280]   So you can do hundreds of thousands
[01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:34.840]   of transactions in a channel.
[01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:37.800]   The other thing Lightning proposes is saying,
[01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:40.640]   okay, well, now that we have channels established,
[01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:44.160]   what if we interlocked a number of channels together?
[01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:46.020]   So if you and I have a channel
[01:03:46.020 --> 01:03:47.960]   and me and my buddy have a channel,
[01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:49.640]   my buddy can now pay you
[01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:53.800]   because you have a relationship through me, basically.
[01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:55.420]   And so Lightning is this network,
[01:03:55.420 --> 01:03:58.560]   this overlay network that sits on top of Bitcoin
[01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:01.680]   and allows people to transact in a much faster
[01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:04.440]   and less frictional way without the need
[01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:07.540]   for Bitcoin's kind of slow periodic settlement,
[01:04:07.540 --> 01:04:11.320]   assuming that everything sort of goes well.
[01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:14.000]   - Do you see any downsides to this?
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.040]   Like, have you seen flaws in the whole system
[01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:19.900]   from a security perspective, from a scaling perspective,
[01:04:19.900 --> 01:04:23.120]   any of that, or is Lightning working well?
[01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:23.960]   - It works.
[01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:27.500]   I use it when I initially sold those dice,
[01:04:27.500 --> 01:04:28.680]   I sold them on Lightning.
[01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:31.640]   I was one of the first merchants to use Lightning
[01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:35.480]   back in the day, the first edition of the dice.
[01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:37.520]   - So people could buy these dice somewhere?
[01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:38.800]   - Well, they used to be able to.
[01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:40.960]   I haven't made a new edition recently.
[01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:43.240]   They're very scarce and very special.
[01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:45.320]   They're like physical NFTs.
[01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:46.920]   - Physical NFTs. (laughs)
[01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:47.760]   - Yeah.
[01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:50.400]   I mean, the flaw with Lightning is really that you,
[01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:52.340]   you know, and this can be remediated in a number of ways,
[01:04:52.340 --> 01:04:54.320]   but you have to sort of pre-fund these channels.
[01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:57.820]   So it's a weird concept to have to inject liquidity
[01:04:57.820 --> 01:05:01.600]   into a channel in order to accept a payment, you know?
[01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:05.960]   So I'm sure those user experience problems can be solved,
[01:05:05.960 --> 01:05:10.080]   but it's still in a state of relative immaturity.
[01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:11.400]   So we'll see.
[01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:15.000]   - In terms of other ideas that are sidechains,
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.400]   just soft forks of Bitcoin,
[01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:20.040]   you've mentioned something about Schnorr and Taproot.
[01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:24.080]   What are your thoughts about this update to Bitcoin
[01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:29.260]   in terms of its promise to improve privacy and scaling
[01:05:29.260 --> 01:05:30.100]   and so on?
[01:05:30.100 --> 01:05:33.180]   And what other things are you interested, excited about
[01:05:33.180 --> 01:05:35.660]   in terms of the development of Bitcoin?
[01:05:35.660 --> 01:05:37.620]   - Well, Schnorr and Taproot,
[01:05:37.620 --> 01:05:42.620]   that's the first new protocol upgrade since Segwit in 2017,
[01:05:42.620 --> 01:05:46.020]   which was what laid the groundwork
[01:05:46.020 --> 01:05:48.540]   for Lightning to be developed, basically.
[01:05:48.540 --> 01:05:52.060]   And Schnorr and Taproot is really the first protocol change
[01:05:52.060 --> 01:05:55.080]   in three, almost four years now.
[01:05:55.080 --> 01:05:57.800]   So we're very excited about it.
[01:05:57.800 --> 01:06:03.160]   - I mean, is there something interesting to say technically
[01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:06.280]   about what are the things it's actually going to improve?
[01:06:06.280 --> 01:06:10.320]   And maybe on the politics side,
[01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:15.320]   bringing a protocol change on Bitcoin,
[01:06:15.320 --> 01:06:16.840]   what does that actually involve?
[01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:18.160]   - Yeah, I mean, it's a huge deal
[01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:20.280]   because the last time we tried to make a change
[01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:22.680]   to the protocol, we had a whole civil war over it.
[01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:25.080]   And it was incredibly difficult
[01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:28.360]   to get Segwit activated in 2017.
[01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:31.240]   And it took all this brinksmanship and threats
[01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:33.080]   and all these campaigns.
[01:06:33.080 --> 01:06:35.120]   And it was this whole thing.
[01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:37.240]   Luckily, I think things have quieted down
[01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:38.600]   and there's much more consensus
[01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:41.320]   that Schnorr and Taproot is a good change to Bitcoin
[01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:43.220]   and everyone generally supports it.
[01:06:43.220 --> 01:06:46.800]   But everyone kind of has PTSD over the last time
[01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:48.680]   when we tried to change Bitcoin.
[01:06:48.680 --> 01:06:50.400]   And so we're sort of really dithering
[01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:52.720]   over how we actually want to implement it.
[01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:54.400]   So it's taking forever
[01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:56.360]   because we're trying to set the protocol
[01:06:56.360 --> 01:06:58.600]   for how do you change Bitcoin itself?
[01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:02.080]   And all of our assumptions went out the window last time.
[01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:04.160]   So we're trying to reset and decide
[01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:07.960]   what is a legitimate way to institute a change to Bitcoin?
[01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:09.680]   So that's actually the big question right now.
[01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:11.920]   It's not, should we implement these changes?
[01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:13.960]   We basically all agree that we should.
[01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:15.600]   It's a meta question is,
[01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:18.800]   what's the valid way to implement new changes to Bitcoin?
[01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:21.640]   What's a way that is scalable in the longterm
[01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:24.280]   and will last and people will consider credible,
[01:07:24.280 --> 01:07:26.900]   even if this one isn't controversial at all?
[01:07:26.900 --> 01:07:28.680]   So that's where we're at.
[01:07:28.680 --> 01:07:31.200]   We're basically debating over how do we implement
[01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:32.840]   this change that we all want.
[01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:36.680]   To get a feeling of how slow Bitcoin governance is
[01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:38.400]   and how deliberate it is,
[01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:40.800]   everybody collectively wants the change,
[01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:42.160]   but we haven't fully agreed
[01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:44.480]   on how we're gonna put it into Bitcoin.
[01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:47.560]   So it's the classic sort of Bitcoin situation.
[01:07:47.560 --> 01:07:48.720]   But what it is, is I mean,
[01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:51.120]   Schnoor is an alternative signature scheme.
[01:07:51.120 --> 01:07:53.720]   I think it was encumbered by a patent
[01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:57.040]   and it had only just been unencumbered
[01:07:57.040 --> 01:07:59.920]   when Satoshi created Bitcoin, I believe.
[01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:02.280]   It's a better signature scheme than Elliptic Curves,
[01:08:02.280 --> 01:08:07.080]   which is what, than ECDSA, which is what Bitcoin uses.
[01:08:07.080 --> 01:08:11.360]   And so it's been long enough that we now trust it.
[01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:14.200]   Kind of in cryptography, it's meant to be Lundy.
[01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:17.320]   It's sort of, you wanna test it over time
[01:08:17.320 --> 01:08:19.200]   and then it's considered safe to use.
[01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:21.800]   So Schnoor has been around for long enough
[01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:25.680]   that we've decided to rip out ECDSA and insert Schnoor,
[01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:27.280]   which is just a different signature scheme,
[01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:28.480]   which is more efficient.
[01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:30.920]   And it has better properties.
[01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:33.160]   Like if you wanna do a multi-signature transaction
[01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:36.560]   where many people collectively sign
[01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:38.700]   in order to permission a spend,
[01:08:38.700 --> 01:08:42.240]   that would be more efficient in a bytes sense
[01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:44.800]   than ECDSA, for instance.
[01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:46.800]   So it's pretty incremental.
[01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:51.800]   And then Taproot is all about having transactional conditions
[01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:56.320]   that are sort of withheld from final entry
[01:08:56.320 --> 01:08:57.540]   onto the blockchain.
[01:08:57.540 --> 01:09:03.520]   So it's kind of a way to have more private,
[01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:07.600]   conditional transactions on Bitcoin.
[01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:11.760]   So both of them, I would say, are incremental changes.
[01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:13.760]   - Is this an over-exaggeration
[01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:17.000]   that Schnoor-Taproot might improve privacy and scaling,
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:20.040]   which is at the high level of things that people mention?
[01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:24.560]   Is that just like a dramatic way of trying to frame
[01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:27.400]   what's fundamentally an incremental improvement?
[01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:29.960]   - Yes, but incremental is the word, right?
[01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:32.120]   We're not gonna get an order of magnitude enhancement
[01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:33.720]   to either privacy or scaling,
[01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:37.600]   but we will get a considerable enhancement.
[01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:39.360]   But privacy and scaling are actually two sides
[01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:42.680]   of the same coin, because you get more transactional privacy
[01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:44.480]   by removing data from the ledger
[01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:46.800]   so that there's less metadata
[01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:49.080]   for people to surveil and analyze.
[01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:50.920]   And that's also how you scale,
[01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:54.900]   by compressing and being really space efficient
[01:09:54.900 --> 01:09:55.960]   with transactions.
[01:09:55.960 --> 01:09:58.480]   And the more parsimonious you are,
[01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:01.320]   the more economically dense each byte
[01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:03.840]   that everyone has to retain on the ledger is.
[01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:08.000]   And so those are very closely allied concepts.
[01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:11.760]   - So do you mind if we go through
[01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:15.960]   some potential criticisms of Bitcoin?
[01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:16.840]   - Totally.
[01:10:16.840 --> 01:10:21.840]   I spent the last five years tackling these every day.
[01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:24.000]   - Are the dice the same?
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:25.360]   - Those two are the same, yeah.
[01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:26.320]   There are three editions.
[01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:27.320]   - So let's go.
[01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:29.720]   - Okay.
[01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:30.560]   - Go with the dice.
[01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:31.400]   - What do we got?
[01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:32.280]   - Silk Road.
[01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:33.120]   What does that mean?
[01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:34.520]   - Silk Road, classic.
[01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:35.920]   Classic situation.
[01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:38.720]   So I mean, that was the darknet marketplace
[01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:42.080]   set up by Ross Ulbricht in the early days of Bitcoin.
[01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:45.240]   That's one of the first killer apps for Bitcoin
[01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:46.960]   was being the payments network
[01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:49.880]   behind this darknet marketplace.
[01:10:49.880 --> 01:10:53.400]   And you know, where you'd go to buy drugs and things.
[01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:55.760]   And so that became associated with Bitcoin,
[01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:58.520]   if you remember the press coverage from back then.
[01:10:58.520 --> 01:11:01.920]   But over time that faded and it became less of a critique.
[01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:04.680]   - So like the critique is that Bitcoin
[01:11:04.680 --> 01:11:07.940]   is something you would use for illegal activity,
[01:11:07.940 --> 01:11:10.640]   for drugs, for crimes, all those kinds of things,
[01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:13.440]   as opposed to for any kind of legitimate transactions
[01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:15.680]   and merchant transactions.
[01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:18.640]   - And today Bitcoin settles $10 billion a day
[01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:22.160]   and the vast, vast majority of it is completely legitimate.
[01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:25.040]   It's just a useful alternative system.
[01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:28.480]   But back then a huge fraction of all Bitcoin transactions
[01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:32.400]   were related to the basically illicit marketplaces.
[01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:33.640]   - And if you're just tuning in,
[01:11:33.640 --> 01:11:36.020]   this incredible tall-sided guy
[01:11:36.020 --> 01:11:40.780]   has 11 common criticisms of Bitcoin, I think.
[01:11:40.780 --> 01:11:41.700]   - Yeah.
[01:11:41.700 --> 01:11:43.980]   - In a genius way has put together.
[01:11:43.980 --> 01:11:45.580]   Maybe we could do a couple more.
[01:11:45.580 --> 01:11:51.780]   Oh, it was Satoshi something, Satoshi coins.
[01:11:51.780 --> 01:11:54.980]   - Satoshi coins, we touched on that early in the episode.
[01:11:54.980 --> 01:12:00.260]   What if Satoshi returns and sells all of their coins?
[01:12:00.260 --> 01:12:02.820]   So we don't know for sure how many coins
[01:12:02.820 --> 01:12:05.140]   Satoshi actually mined or produced
[01:12:05.140 --> 01:12:08.980]   because there's a degree of probabilistic analysis
[01:12:08.980 --> 01:12:10.340]   that you would do.
[01:12:10.340 --> 01:12:15.340]   There's a few thousand blocks that were mined
[01:12:15.340 --> 01:12:19.260]   by what we think is a single entity in sort of 2009.
[01:12:19.260 --> 01:12:21.620]   And so if you add them all up, you get to about a million.
[01:12:21.620 --> 01:12:24.700]   So people think that Satoshi mined a million coins
[01:12:24.700 --> 01:12:27.540]   and then they're worried that Satoshi would return
[01:12:27.540 --> 01:12:29.640]   and market sell all the coins,
[01:12:30.540 --> 01:12:33.580]   thus crushing the price of Bitcoin.
[01:12:33.580 --> 01:12:38.060]   - So looking at some of these, no CEO,
[01:12:38.060 --> 01:12:38.900]   I think we touched on that.
[01:12:38.900 --> 01:12:42.660]   - We did, we see we've already hit on the dice.
[01:12:42.660 --> 01:12:45.900]   - No merchants, that's no longer true.
[01:12:45.900 --> 01:12:47.140]   - We talked about that, yeah.
[01:12:47.140 --> 01:12:51.140]   - There's a scalability one,
[01:12:51.140 --> 01:12:54.100]   and I think that one has addressed the idea
[01:12:54.100 --> 01:12:56.100]   that you're mentioning with the block size debates
[01:12:56.100 --> 01:12:59.540]   and the lightning network that by adding extra layers
[01:12:59.540 --> 01:13:02.380]   on top, you can achieve scalability.
[01:13:02.380 --> 01:13:05.060]   - That's my vision, that's my theory.
[01:13:05.060 --> 01:13:08.580]   And you can do it in a permissionless
[01:13:08.580 --> 01:13:09.620]   and a permissioned way.
[01:13:09.620 --> 01:13:12.420]   Like Coinbase is a big Bitcoin exchange.
[01:13:12.420 --> 01:13:14.020]   They provide scalability.
[01:13:14.020 --> 01:13:16.420]   They're a financial institution.
[01:13:16.420 --> 01:13:19.540]   You can settle up internally on their own database
[01:13:19.540 --> 01:13:22.420]   and then periodically settle to Bitcoin.
[01:13:22.420 --> 01:13:26.260]   - So they do something like the lightning network internally,
[01:13:26.260 --> 01:13:28.340]   so something like this, some kind of mechanism.
[01:13:28.340 --> 01:13:30.660]   - Well, honestly, I'm not sure exactly how it works.
[01:13:30.660 --> 01:13:34.100]   They might have that built in, but just generally speaking,
[01:13:34.100 --> 01:13:38.140]   institutional scaling is a model for scaling, right?
[01:13:38.140 --> 01:13:40.340]   Where you could have banks holding Bitcoin
[01:13:40.340 --> 01:13:42.420]   and they issue notes against Bitcoin
[01:13:42.420 --> 01:13:44.180]   and those are your payments,
[01:13:44.180 --> 01:13:47.320]   and then the base layer is the settlement layer.
[01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:52.380]   - I think that's what you're getting with the boiling oceans
[01:13:52.380 --> 01:13:57.100]   is this is like the impact on weather, I suppose.
[01:13:57.100 --> 01:13:58.420]   On the environment.
[01:13:58.420 --> 01:14:02.900]   So that is a concern that people have
[01:14:02.900 --> 01:14:04.940]   in terms of the proof of work requires
[01:14:04.940 --> 01:14:08.220]   that there's a lot of computational resources being used
[01:14:08.220 --> 01:14:10.100]   and that requires a lot of energy
[01:14:10.100 --> 01:14:13.460]   and some large percentage of the world's energy
[01:14:13.460 --> 01:14:15.660]   is used to mine Bitcoin.
[01:14:15.660 --> 01:14:18.900]   How would you respond to that criticism?
[01:14:18.900 --> 01:14:20.700]   - Yeah, I mean, that's been the loudest critique
[01:14:20.700 --> 01:14:22.700]   of Bitcoin this year in the press.
[01:14:22.700 --> 01:14:23.540]   - This year, really?
[01:14:23.540 --> 01:14:26.620]   - Yeah, so I mean, it's not like a new criticism,
[01:14:26.620 --> 01:14:29.340]   but Bitcoin is consuming more energy than ever.
[01:14:29.340 --> 01:14:34.020]   So as the price rises, the electricity consumption rises.
[01:14:34.020 --> 01:14:39.020]   And so we've heard renewed bellyaching over this for sure.
[01:14:39.020 --> 01:14:44.660]   I mean, if you don't believe that Bitcoin is useful,
[01:14:44.660 --> 01:14:45.940]   then you're inclined to think
[01:14:45.940 --> 01:14:48.820]   that all of the energy consumption is a waste.
[01:14:48.820 --> 01:14:53.780]   So that's, it's something that's sort of unrebuttable
[01:14:53.780 --> 01:14:57.300]   if you fundamentally contest the validity
[01:14:57.300 --> 01:14:58.540]   of the Bitcoin system.
[01:14:58.540 --> 01:15:03.540]   - So if Bitcoin is like a thing that will take over,
[01:15:03.540 --> 01:15:09.500]   will become like the main mechanism of financial transactions
[01:15:09.500 --> 01:15:12.340]   or transactions period in the world,
[01:15:12.340 --> 01:15:14.420]   then you say, well, the cost of energy use
[01:15:14.420 --> 01:15:17.180]   is actually quite low relative to the benefit it provides.
[01:15:17.180 --> 01:15:19.340]   If you think it's not going to be,
[01:15:19.340 --> 01:15:24.340]   if it's just a volatile way to make a little money
[01:15:24.340 --> 01:15:25.900]   in the short term,
[01:15:25.900 --> 01:15:28.980]   then you see the energy use as really wasteful.
[01:15:28.980 --> 01:15:30.580]   - It's totally spurious, yeah.
[01:15:30.580 --> 01:15:31.420]   So--
[01:15:31.420 --> 01:15:34.860]   - So then there's no really response, I suppose.
[01:15:34.860 --> 01:15:38.300]   - That's, so I can totally get into the details
[01:15:38.300 --> 01:15:40.380]   of Bitcoin's energy mix and things like that,
[01:15:40.380 --> 01:15:43.160]   but that's like at a high level what the debate is.
[01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:44.580]   It's this normative question.
[01:15:44.580 --> 01:15:46.740]   Like, does Bitcoin have an entitlement
[01:15:46.740 --> 01:15:49.220]   to consume any of the world's resources?
[01:15:49.220 --> 01:15:51.780]   And that's actually where the debate should end
[01:15:51.780 --> 01:15:53.320]   much of the time,
[01:15:53.320 --> 01:15:56.700]   because a lot of people fundamentally dispute
[01:15:56.700 --> 01:16:00.220]   the validity or usefulness of Bitcoin as a system.
[01:16:00.220 --> 01:16:02.580]   And so of course, they're gonna consider
[01:16:02.580 --> 01:16:05.220]   the energy usage illegitimate.
[01:16:05.220 --> 01:16:07.060]   Now, there's a lot of mitigating factors
[01:16:07.060 --> 01:16:11.300]   if you think that Bitcoin is potentially a useful system,
[01:16:11.300 --> 01:16:16.180]   which is Bitcoin consumes energy in a very peculiar way,
[01:16:16.180 --> 01:16:18.980]   which virtually no other industry does,
[01:16:18.980 --> 01:16:23.860]   which is that Bitcoin is a geography-independent
[01:16:23.860 --> 01:16:25.340]   buyer of energy,
[01:16:25.340 --> 01:16:29.700]   which is not how we humans typically consume energy.
[01:16:29.700 --> 01:16:31.420]   Like, we need energy to be produced
[01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:33.500]   near to population centers,
[01:16:33.500 --> 01:16:36.340]   and we need it to be produced at the, you know,
[01:16:36.340 --> 01:16:38.580]   corresponding to the peaks and troughs
[01:16:38.580 --> 01:16:40.360]   of our consumption, right?
[01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:42.380]   'Cause we have to 100% match the demand
[01:16:42.380 --> 01:16:44.860]   and the supply at all times, right?
[01:16:44.860 --> 01:16:46.580]   Otherwise, we have blackouts.
[01:16:46.580 --> 01:16:50.700]   So Bitcoin doesn't care about any of that.
[01:16:50.700 --> 01:16:54.360]   It just buys energy on a constant basis.
[01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:55.500]   And so it's, you know,
[01:16:55.500 --> 01:16:57.660]   indifferent to where it's being produced.
[01:16:57.660 --> 01:17:00.420]   And so the consequence of all that
[01:17:00.420 --> 01:17:02.660]   is that Bitcoin will buy energy
[01:17:02.660 --> 01:17:05.380]   that's otherwise being wasted, basically.
[01:17:05.380 --> 01:17:09.460]   So it will buy so-called stranded energy assets
[01:17:09.460 --> 01:17:11.560]   that would not make it to a population center.
[01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:13.860]   And in fact, most energy produced
[01:17:15.740 --> 01:17:18.420]   ultimately does not sort of make it to,
[01:17:18.420 --> 01:17:21.540]   you know, your socket in your wall.
[01:17:21.540 --> 01:17:25.100]   And so this is why so much Bitcoin is mined in China,
[01:17:25.100 --> 01:17:26.100]   for instance.
[01:17:26.100 --> 01:17:27.560]   It's not because, you know,
[01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:30.940]   Chinese industrialists had a special affinity for Bitcoin.
[01:17:30.940 --> 01:17:33.060]   It's because the Chinese grid
[01:17:33.060 --> 01:17:36.100]   had a massive overabundance of energy,
[01:17:36.100 --> 01:17:37.620]   and particularly in four provinces,
[01:17:37.620 --> 01:17:41.720]   Sichuan, Yunnan, Inner Mongolia, and Xinjiang.
[01:17:41.720 --> 01:17:43.260]   So in those four provinces,
[01:17:43.260 --> 01:17:47.780]   those are all pretty distant from major population centers.
[01:17:47.780 --> 01:17:49.480]   So because of that,
[01:17:49.480 --> 01:17:51.420]   you can't really transport the energy that easily.
[01:17:51.420 --> 01:17:54.600]   And so huge amounts of energy are curtailed,
[01:17:54.600 --> 01:17:57.180]   or basically wasted in all those provinces.
[01:17:57.180 --> 01:17:59.500]   And so miners set up shop there
[01:17:59.500 --> 01:18:02.060]   because they could mine Bitcoin with the excess energy.
[01:18:02.060 --> 01:18:03.180]   They could monetize this thing
[01:18:03.180 --> 01:18:05.460]   that otherwise was gonna go to waste.
[01:18:05.460 --> 01:18:07.340]   So, you know, there's things like that,
[01:18:07.340 --> 01:18:11.420]   which, you know, I think mitigate the reality.
[01:18:11.420 --> 01:18:13.100]   Bitcoin is not really rival
[01:18:13.100 --> 01:18:16.420]   with our consumption of electricity.
[01:18:16.420 --> 01:18:18.460]   It's not depriving anyone of electricity.
[01:18:18.460 --> 01:18:21.460]   It's mostly these stranded assets
[01:18:21.460 --> 01:18:24.460]   that are going into supporting the Bitcoin network.
[01:18:24.460 --> 01:18:26.900]   - So maybe let's do a last one,
[01:18:26.900 --> 01:18:27.740]   since you mentioned China.
[01:18:27.740 --> 01:18:29.460]   It says China control.
[01:18:29.460 --> 01:18:31.680]   So if so much mining's happening in China,
[01:18:31.680 --> 01:18:33.580]   how do we not,
[01:18:33.580 --> 01:18:37.260]   how do we prevent nation states
[01:18:37.260 --> 01:18:39.660]   from controlling much of Bitcoin?
[01:18:39.660 --> 01:18:42.500]   - Yeah, that's the flip side of a large portion
[01:18:42.500 --> 01:18:44.060]   of the blocks being mined in China
[01:18:44.060 --> 01:18:46.580]   due to this energy feature which I discussed,
[01:18:46.580 --> 01:18:50.500]   which is that there's a lot of Chinese miners, for sure.
[01:18:50.500 --> 01:18:53.180]   Now the question ultimately is,
[01:18:53.180 --> 01:18:55.540]   what degree of control do miners have
[01:18:55.540 --> 01:18:57.460]   over the Bitcoin system?
[01:18:57.460 --> 01:19:00.820]   And that was part of the block size debate.
[01:19:00.820 --> 01:19:03.220]   I mean, the miners,
[01:19:03.220 --> 01:19:06.420]   when we implemented segregated witness in 2017,
[01:19:06.420 --> 01:19:08.820]   the miners just didn't wanna do it.
[01:19:08.820 --> 01:19:12.260]   Eventually the users, the regular folks running nodes,
[01:19:12.260 --> 01:19:14.940]   rebelled and basically said,
[01:19:14.940 --> 01:19:17.700]   "Look, we're gonna implement this whether or not you do it."
[01:19:17.700 --> 01:19:20.140]   And it was a threat to the value of Bitcoin
[01:19:20.140 --> 01:19:22.140]   because if this threat had gone through,
[01:19:22.140 --> 01:19:23.860]   it could have split Bitcoin and it would have been
[01:19:23.860 --> 01:19:25.100]   really messy.
[01:19:25.100 --> 01:19:27.400]   So the miners sort of capitulated.
[01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:30.340]   So I think the current consensus
[01:19:30.340 --> 01:19:33.700]   is that miners do not have unilateral control over Bitcoin
[01:19:33.700 --> 01:19:36.220]   and that governance is more poised
[01:19:36.220 --> 01:19:37.940]   between people that run nodes,
[01:19:37.940 --> 01:19:39.300]   developers and miners.
[01:19:39.300 --> 01:19:41.260]   It's sort of a triumvirate
[01:19:41.260 --> 01:19:44.260]   where neither of them has total control.
[01:19:44.260 --> 01:19:48.460]   So that's my current model for controlling Bitcoin.
[01:19:48.460 --> 01:19:51.060]   I think if you asked a miner,
[01:19:51.060 --> 01:19:52.420]   they would tell you they didn't feel
[01:19:52.420 --> 01:19:54.460]   that they had sort of unilateral control
[01:19:54.460 --> 01:19:55.540]   over Bitcoin either.
[01:19:55.540 --> 01:19:58.220]   - Almost as a thought experiment,
[01:19:58.220 --> 01:19:59.740]   can I ask you to think about
[01:19:59.740 --> 01:20:04.700]   if some of your predictions, some of your analysis,
[01:20:04.700 --> 01:20:07.180]   some of your understanding of Bitcoin is wrong,
[01:20:08.180 --> 01:20:09.700]   in the following sense,
[01:20:09.700 --> 01:20:12.060]   where it will not have the impact
[01:20:12.060 --> 01:20:17.020]   that you have a vision for it,
[01:20:17.020 --> 01:20:18.980]   that it will not have the scale of impact
[01:20:18.980 --> 01:20:21.300]   and perhaps in terms of value will go to zero
[01:20:21.300 --> 01:20:23.500]   to something very low and other cryptocurrency
[01:20:23.500 --> 01:20:26.780]   or other financial systems will overtake it.
[01:20:26.780 --> 01:20:29.460]   What would be the reason for that in your mind?
[01:20:29.460 --> 01:20:32.540]   Like, why might you be wrong?
[01:20:32.540 --> 01:20:36.020]   If you look back at it in the future,
[01:20:36.020 --> 01:20:38.700]   what did you not understand about Bitcoin
[01:20:38.700 --> 01:20:41.340]   that will result in that?
[01:20:41.340 --> 01:20:43.740]   - Yeah, that's a great question.
[01:20:43.740 --> 01:20:46.140]   I think for that to happen,
[01:20:46.140 --> 01:20:48.700]   one of two things would have to obtain,
[01:20:48.700 --> 01:20:50.300]   one of two things would have to happen
[01:20:50.300 --> 01:20:53.060]   for Bitcoin to just be irrelevant basically.
[01:20:53.060 --> 01:20:57.340]   Either central banks totally clean up their act
[01:20:57.340 --> 01:21:01.660]   and stop engaging in rampant money printing,
[01:21:01.660 --> 01:21:03.820]   which I don't expect that to happen anytime soon.
[01:21:03.820 --> 01:21:05.900]   I mean, it looks like we're normalizing
[01:21:05.900 --> 01:21:08.620]   this new regime of inflation,
[01:21:08.620 --> 01:21:12.260]   pro-inflation just to remediate the debt issues we have.
[01:21:12.260 --> 01:21:16.420]   So that would be one thing that would make Bitcoin,
[01:21:16.420 --> 01:21:18.380]   cryptocurrency much less relevant
[01:21:18.380 --> 01:21:20.740]   as if everyone becomes totally assured
[01:21:20.740 --> 01:21:24.460]   of the soundness of sovereign currencies basically,
[01:21:24.460 --> 01:21:28.140]   namely the dollar, like the dollar being the main one.
[01:21:28.140 --> 01:21:32.820]   It seems like we're going completely opposite direction
[01:21:32.820 --> 01:21:35.300]   with most people seem to be noticing
[01:21:35.300 --> 01:21:37.780]   the stirrings of inflation in society.
[01:21:37.780 --> 01:21:39.460]   I mean, you might've noticed that too.
[01:21:39.460 --> 01:21:41.060]   It's showing up in commodity prices,
[01:21:41.060 --> 01:21:44.660]   lumber prices, in food, obviously in financial assets,
[01:21:44.660 --> 01:21:49.060]   and it'll show up in consumer prices generally soon.
[01:21:49.060 --> 01:21:51.060]   But so that would be one way for Bitcoin
[01:21:51.060 --> 01:21:52.580]   to basically become irrelevant
[01:21:52.580 --> 01:21:56.500]   'cause it's a dialectical thing.
[01:21:56.500 --> 01:21:58.980]   Bitcoin is held in opposition
[01:21:58.980 --> 01:22:02.540]   to the established monetary regime.
[01:22:02.540 --> 01:22:04.860]   So if they completely reform themselves
[01:22:04.860 --> 01:22:08.980]   and the dollar becomes super sound once again,
[01:22:08.980 --> 01:22:13.740]   and the Fed stops tinkering the way they constantly do,
[01:22:13.740 --> 01:22:18.220]   then we wouldn't need cryptocurrency as much.
[01:22:18.220 --> 01:22:23.020]   The other thing would be if a completely superior design
[01:22:23.020 --> 01:22:28.020]   for a new sort of state independent monetary system emerged,
[01:22:28.020 --> 01:22:30.660]   but it's really hard to even imagine
[01:22:30.660 --> 01:22:32.780]   how that would come to emerge.
[01:22:32.780 --> 01:22:36.540]   And there's good reasons to think that Bitcoin,
[01:22:36.540 --> 01:22:40.340]   the conditions of its launch were extremely favorable
[01:22:40.340 --> 01:22:41.620]   and hard to replicate.
[01:22:41.620 --> 01:22:44.020]   - Can you speak to some of those conditions?
[01:22:44.020 --> 01:22:49.020]   Why it's a unique timing wise moment for Bitcoin to emerge?
[01:22:49.020 --> 01:22:52.140]   - Yeah, so obviously Bitcoin was born
[01:22:52.140 --> 01:22:53.820]   in the depths of the financial crisis,
[01:22:53.820 --> 01:22:58.020]   which gives it a nice historical element,
[01:22:58.020 --> 01:23:00.380]   but that was kind of a coincidence.
[01:23:00.380 --> 01:23:02.780]   Honestly, we know that Satoshi had been working on it
[01:23:02.780 --> 01:23:06.060]   earlier in back in 2017.
[01:23:06.060 --> 01:23:09.220]   The really special thing about Bitcoin
[01:23:09.220 --> 01:23:12.500]   was that it was launched anonymously
[01:23:12.500 --> 01:23:15.420]   by an entity that did not seek any glory
[01:23:15.420 --> 01:23:16.940]   or credit for what they did
[01:23:16.940 --> 01:23:19.860]   and apparently never monetized it at all.
[01:23:19.860 --> 01:23:23.540]   So they never really moved any of their coins.
[01:23:23.540 --> 01:23:27.420]   Satoshi sent one test transaction to Hal Finney,
[01:23:27.420 --> 01:23:29.860]   who's one of the earliest Bitcoiners.
[01:23:29.860 --> 01:23:31.140]   Aside from that, as far as we know,
[01:23:31.140 --> 01:23:33.580]   Satoshi never spent any of their coins.
[01:23:33.580 --> 01:23:36.940]   So you have this wonderful Promethean quality
[01:23:36.940 --> 01:23:39.260]   whereby it's almost self-sacrificial.
[01:23:39.260 --> 01:23:43.820]   I mean, it's like this borderline godlike figure
[01:23:43.820 --> 01:23:45.220]   in terms of their restraint,
[01:23:45.220 --> 01:23:47.900]   finds this monetary technology
[01:23:47.900 --> 01:23:50.500]   and releases it to the world and pays the price.
[01:23:50.500 --> 01:23:53.660]   They never took advantage of their filthy lucre.
[01:23:53.660 --> 01:23:57.900]   They never recognized any of the $50 billion
[01:23:57.900 --> 01:23:59.460]   that they made from Bitcoin.
[01:23:59.460 --> 01:24:03.860]   And Satoshi also didn't assign themselves
[01:24:03.860 --> 01:24:06.780]   any privileged access to the coins.
[01:24:06.780 --> 01:24:08.780]   Satoshi could have just written in the code,
[01:24:08.780 --> 01:24:11.900]   I own 10% of the coins, but they didn't.
[01:24:11.900 --> 01:24:14.260]   They just mined in the open free market competition
[01:24:14.260 --> 01:24:15.100]   like everyone else.
[01:24:15.100 --> 01:24:17.580]   It's just that Satoshi is an early miner
[01:24:17.580 --> 01:24:19.180]   to support the network,
[01:24:19.180 --> 01:24:21.380]   accumulate a lot of coins for sure,
[01:24:21.380 --> 01:24:24.220]   but they didn't have any privileged special access.
[01:24:24.220 --> 01:24:27.260]   So that's one thing that's extremely special
[01:24:27.260 --> 01:24:29.420]   about the launch is that we had a founder
[01:24:29.420 --> 01:24:31.620]   that was truly committed to the monetary protocol
[01:24:31.620 --> 01:24:36.180]   and didn't seek either recognition or financial spoils
[01:24:36.180 --> 01:24:37.620]   and then also left.
[01:24:37.620 --> 01:24:40.780]   Satoshi left in 2010, 2011
[01:24:40.780 --> 01:24:42.780]   and hasn't really been heard from since.
[01:24:42.780 --> 01:24:46.140]   - It's a very George Washington move, gangster move
[01:24:46.140 --> 01:24:47.820]   where he didn't want power
[01:24:47.820 --> 01:24:49.740]   and once he got power, he let go of it.
[01:24:49.740 --> 01:24:50.580]   - Precisely.
[01:24:50.580 --> 01:24:52.660]   - That was a key actually move.
[01:24:52.660 --> 01:24:56.860]   That was probably one of the most important moves
[01:24:56.860 --> 01:24:58.500]   at the founding of this country.
[01:24:58.500 --> 01:25:01.140]   - That's right, George Washington could have been a king,
[01:25:01.140 --> 01:25:02.260]   probably if he'd wanted
[01:25:02.260 --> 01:25:06.180]   and Satoshi could have been Jerome Powell if he'd wanted
[01:25:06.180 --> 01:25:10.020]   and Satoshi could have held on to power indefinitely
[01:25:10.020 --> 01:25:11.740]   but chose to leave.
[01:25:11.740 --> 01:25:13.900]   The other thing is that Bitcoin circulated
[01:25:13.900 --> 01:25:17.500]   for a long period of time from January 2009
[01:25:17.500 --> 01:25:22.500]   to about July 2010 without really having a financial value.
[01:25:22.500 --> 01:25:25.660]   So there weren't really any marketplaces,
[01:25:25.660 --> 01:25:27.140]   it didn't have a value
[01:25:27.140 --> 01:25:31.420]   and so that gave it this really great distribution
[01:25:31.420 --> 01:25:33.900]   among a broad set of stakeholders
[01:25:33.900 --> 01:25:37.100]   and there were no venture funds or hedge funds
[01:25:37.100 --> 01:25:40.340]   trying to aggressively buy up all the supply back then.
[01:25:40.340 --> 01:25:43.000]   Now when you have new cryptocurrencies launched,
[01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.020]   they're aggressively pre-mined
[01:25:45.020 --> 01:25:48.140]   and some gigantic Silicon Valley venture fund
[01:25:48.140 --> 01:25:50.540]   is gonna own 30% of it
[01:25:50.540 --> 01:25:52.520]   and so it's sort of impossible to conceive
[01:25:52.520 --> 01:25:54.660]   of how that could become a global money
[01:25:54.660 --> 01:25:59.660]   because how could a Silicon Valley investment firm
[01:25:59.660 --> 01:26:02.620]   own 30% of the money supply?
[01:26:02.620 --> 01:26:06.120]   That doesn't make sense, that's just so oligarchical.
[01:26:06.120 --> 01:26:07.940]   It's unbelievable.
[01:26:07.940 --> 01:26:10.740]   So Bitcoin by contract is a very bottom-up thing.
[01:26:11.740 --> 01:26:15.020]   It was the early enthusiasts,
[01:26:15.020 --> 01:26:19.540]   people that were really excited about the technology,
[01:26:19.540 --> 01:26:22.260]   they're the ones that obtained those early coins
[01:26:22.260 --> 01:26:25.220]   and so there was a real element of fairness
[01:26:25.220 --> 01:26:27.620]   and just an organic nature to its launch
[01:26:27.620 --> 01:26:29.740]   which would be incredibly hard to recapture.
[01:26:29.740 --> 01:26:32.540]   Today, let's say Satoshi came back
[01:26:32.540 --> 01:26:36.060]   and they said, "Okay, I made Bitcoin 2.0,
[01:26:36.060 --> 01:26:37.540]   "I'm gonna release it."
[01:26:37.540 --> 01:26:41.300]   There'd be the most aggressive land grab ever
[01:26:41.300 --> 01:26:44.140]   by gigantic pools of capital
[01:26:44.140 --> 01:26:48.980]   to sort of get favorable allocations of the new system.
[01:26:48.980 --> 01:26:52.460]   - Can Satoshi with Bitcoin 2.0 build in
[01:26:52.460 --> 01:26:56.740]   a resistance mechanism or a prevention mechanism
[01:26:56.740 --> 01:26:58.140]   for the land grab?
[01:26:58.140 --> 01:26:59.700]   - It would be hard to because
[01:26:59.700 --> 01:27:02.900]   if you have capital and resources,
[01:27:02.900 --> 01:27:04.540]   I mean, if it was a proof of work chain,
[01:27:04.540 --> 01:27:05.860]   you'd just have people that would invest
[01:27:05.860 --> 01:27:07.900]   a ton of money in mining, for instance.
[01:27:07.900 --> 01:27:10.380]   But most new blockchains, cryptocurrencies
[01:27:10.380 --> 01:27:12.380]   are just sold basically.
[01:27:12.380 --> 01:27:15.700]   They're issued in token offerings kind of thing.
[01:27:15.700 --> 01:27:19.180]   - So it's hard to enforce through the protocol
[01:27:19.180 --> 01:27:22.700]   the decentralization of control power.
[01:27:22.700 --> 01:27:23.580]   - It'd be challenging too
[01:27:23.580 --> 01:27:25.900]   and people have tried to do airdrops
[01:27:25.900 --> 01:27:29.220]   where they distribute coins to a large number of people.
[01:27:29.220 --> 01:27:30.700]   Basically, it doesn't work.
[01:27:30.700 --> 01:27:32.500]   Most people don't care about the airdrop.
[01:27:32.500 --> 01:27:36.240]   So it's hard to have an equitable distribution.
[01:27:36.240 --> 01:27:38.340]   I think the conditions of Bitcoin's launch
[01:27:38.340 --> 01:27:41.220]   were so lucky and favorable
[01:27:41.220 --> 01:27:44.020]   that they're very unlikely to be replicated.
[01:27:44.020 --> 01:27:46.580]   So I do think it's gonna be a real challenge
[01:27:46.580 --> 01:27:48.560]   to ever have a new competitor
[01:27:48.560 --> 01:27:51.520]   that's as decentralized, as leaderless,
[01:27:51.520 --> 01:27:54.420]   as dispersed, sort of distributed as Bitcoin is,
[01:27:54.420 --> 01:27:56.220]   has its credibility.
[01:27:56.220 --> 01:27:58.260]   I don't know how you could overrule it
[01:27:58.260 --> 01:27:59.900]   on those important features.
[01:27:59.900 --> 01:28:02.100]   - What about Bitcoin's comparison
[01:28:02.100 --> 01:28:03.900]   to other current cryptocurrencies?
[01:28:03.900 --> 01:28:07.340]   So Bitcoin versus Ethereum, for example.
[01:28:07.340 --> 01:28:12.340]   Why is it possible that Ethereum overtakes Bitcoin?
[01:28:12.340 --> 01:28:13.640]   - That's certainly possible.
[01:28:13.640 --> 01:28:15.780]   Yeah, I'm not ruling it out.
[01:28:15.780 --> 01:28:18.580]   Ethereum leadership is sort of wise enough
[01:28:18.580 --> 01:28:22.460]   to understand that they shouldn't compete with Bitcoin
[01:28:22.460 --> 01:28:25.900]   on those most profound qualities.
[01:28:25.900 --> 01:28:30.380]   Like Ethereum doesn't really aspire to be more sound
[01:28:30.380 --> 01:28:33.300]   from a monetary perspective than Bitcoin.
[01:28:33.300 --> 01:28:34.460]   In fact, the Ethereum leadership
[01:28:34.460 --> 01:28:37.620]   are sort of constantly tweaking the monetary policy.
[01:28:37.620 --> 01:28:40.220]   So they went for a completely different trade-off.
[01:28:40.220 --> 01:28:44.980]   They also don't compete to be as decentralized
[01:28:44.980 --> 01:28:46.900]   from a governance perspective,
[01:28:46.900 --> 01:28:48.020]   'cause there's leadership.
[01:28:48.020 --> 01:28:49.800]   There's an ETH foundation,
[01:28:49.800 --> 01:28:52.340]   there's a charismatic leader, Vitalik,
[01:28:52.340 --> 01:28:55.580]   and Ethereum has this policy of hard forks.
[01:28:55.580 --> 01:28:59.140]   So in Bitcoin, hard forks are extremely rare.
[01:28:59.140 --> 01:29:02.060]   In Ethereum, it's the default way to change things.
[01:29:02.060 --> 01:29:04.620]   So it's a much more adaptive system
[01:29:04.620 --> 01:29:06.580]   and it changes more frequently,
[01:29:06.580 --> 01:29:08.740]   but that also means that it's sort of,
[01:29:08.740 --> 01:29:10.080]   they're incurring more risk
[01:29:10.080 --> 01:29:11.960]   when they introduce those changes.
[01:29:11.960 --> 01:29:13.100]   There's much more complexity.
[01:29:13.100 --> 01:29:17.580]   So Ethereum is smart because they sort of understood
[01:29:17.580 --> 01:29:21.460]   Bitcoin as the top dog when it comes to a sound money,
[01:29:21.460 --> 01:29:23.780]   a digital gold type thing.
[01:29:23.780 --> 01:29:26.520]   And they went for all of the different trade-offs.
[01:29:26.520 --> 01:29:29.620]   They wanted to be more of a platform.
[01:29:29.620 --> 01:29:31.100]   They wanted to have more complexity
[01:29:31.100 --> 01:29:32.980]   of the transactional layer.
[01:29:32.980 --> 01:29:34.980]   They wanted to take on more risk
[01:29:34.980 --> 01:29:36.540]   in terms of changing the protocol.
[01:29:36.540 --> 01:29:38.980]   They wanted to change more quickly.
[01:29:38.980 --> 01:29:42.500]   They wanted to make the monetary policy more mutable.
[01:29:42.500 --> 01:29:46.420]   So Ethereum takes that completely different tack.
[01:29:46.420 --> 01:29:48.140]   Of course, I'm not ruling out
[01:29:48.140 --> 01:29:50.000]   that it could take over Bitcoin
[01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.180]   from a market cap perspective.
[01:29:52.180 --> 01:29:53.840]   It's just a very different system.
[01:29:53.840 --> 01:29:58.060]   And I tend to think that Bitcoin is the most disruptive one
[01:29:58.060 --> 01:29:59.820]   because it's the most equipped
[01:29:59.820 --> 01:30:03.420]   to challenge sovereign currencies in the grand scheme.
[01:30:03.420 --> 01:30:06.260]   - Do you think they can coexist?
[01:30:06.260 --> 01:30:10.140]   So like in the future, do you see a world where,
[01:30:10.140 --> 01:30:16.500]   Ethereum captures some large percent of the market,
[01:30:16.500 --> 01:30:18.740]   but nevertheless the minority?
[01:30:18.740 --> 01:30:21.540]   - A hundred percent, a hundred percent.
[01:30:21.540 --> 01:30:25.700]   Bitcoin has already been tokenized and put onto Ethereum.
[01:30:25.700 --> 01:30:26.780]   Many units of Bitcoin,
[01:30:26.780 --> 01:30:28.820]   I think over a billion dollars worth.
[01:30:28.820 --> 01:30:31.260]   So not only do they coexist,
[01:30:31.260 --> 01:30:33.580]   they are actually mutualistic.
[01:30:33.580 --> 01:30:36.460]   So they're like two creatures that have this,
[01:30:36.460 --> 01:30:40.180]   you know, it's like the rhino and like the bird,
[01:30:40.180 --> 01:30:43.260]   the pecks the parasites off the rhino's back or whatever.
[01:30:43.260 --> 01:30:44.100]   - Yeah. - Right?
[01:30:44.100 --> 01:30:47.100]   So I don't know which is which in the analogy, but.
[01:30:47.100 --> 01:30:48.620]   - Yeah, I don't know who the parasites are.
[01:30:48.620 --> 01:30:51.380]   (both laughing)
[01:30:51.380 --> 01:30:53.100]   - Or, you know, the alligator
[01:30:53.100 --> 01:30:55.820]   and the teeth cleaning fish or whatever, right?
[01:30:55.820 --> 01:30:58.020]   So, you know, I always wonder why the alligator
[01:30:58.020 --> 01:30:59.620]   doesn't just eat the fish,
[01:30:59.620 --> 01:31:02.540]   but I guess they're brushing its teeth basically.
[01:31:02.540 --> 01:31:07.540]   So, Ethereum is, it gives you more transactional flexibility.
[01:31:07.540 --> 01:31:10.940]   There's much more experimentation happening there.
[01:31:10.940 --> 01:31:14.260]   It has this whole decentralized finance element.
[01:31:14.260 --> 01:31:15.580]   There's a huge number of Bitcoins
[01:31:15.580 --> 01:31:18.380]   that circulate on the Ethereum protocol, right?
[01:31:18.380 --> 01:31:22.540]   'Cause Ethereum is open to other asset types basically.
[01:31:22.540 --> 01:31:26.620]   So I think that's actually accretive to both systems
[01:31:26.620 --> 01:31:28.740]   because Ethereum gets to have this good form
[01:31:28.740 --> 01:31:31.580]   of collateral Bitcoin on the system,
[01:31:31.580 --> 01:31:34.180]   which has good volatility characteristics.
[01:31:34.180 --> 01:31:37.740]   And then it's a supply sink for Bitcoins,
[01:31:37.740 --> 01:31:40.460]   which are sort of now they're injected
[01:31:40.460 --> 01:31:42.460]   into this third party protocol.
[01:31:42.460 --> 01:31:46.460]   And that I think reduces the velocity of Bitcoin overall
[01:31:46.460 --> 01:31:49.020]   and it's probably good for the valuation.
[01:31:49.020 --> 01:31:51.260]   - So you see it quite possibly could be
[01:31:51.260 --> 01:31:52.780]   a symbiotic relationship.
[01:31:52.780 --> 01:31:53.660]   That's really interesting.
[01:31:53.660 --> 01:31:55.820]   - I think so, I think so.
[01:31:55.820 --> 01:32:00.820]   - What are your thoughts about Vitalik, Buterin?
[01:32:00.820 --> 01:32:04.060]   What are your thoughts about some of the other figures
[01:32:04.060 --> 01:32:07.220]   in the space outside of Bitcoin?
[01:32:07.220 --> 01:32:09.940]   - I think Vitalik made some mistakes with Ethereum.
[01:32:09.940 --> 01:32:13.380]   Ultimately, like I disagree with some of the decisions
[01:32:13.380 --> 01:32:15.260]   that were made along the way.
[01:32:15.260 --> 01:32:18.020]   Like there's this infamous case of this bailout
[01:32:18.020 --> 01:32:22.380]   where 14% of Ether was lost in the smart contract
[01:32:22.380 --> 01:32:24.980]   or really this smart contract
[01:32:24.980 --> 01:32:26.340]   that a lot of Ethereum leadership
[01:32:26.340 --> 01:32:29.300]   were sort of backing and supporting was hacked.
[01:32:29.300 --> 01:32:33.180]   And then the foundation with Vitalik support
[01:32:33.180 --> 01:32:37.620]   chose to make a change to the underlying protocol
[01:32:37.620 --> 01:32:39.460]   to undo the hack, right?
[01:32:39.460 --> 01:32:44.460]   So to me, that was not the most prudent approach
[01:32:45.940 --> 01:32:50.180]   because you're basically violating the core protocol rules
[01:32:50.180 --> 01:32:55.180]   in order to undo, you know, to bail out a specific contract
[01:32:55.180 --> 01:32:56.420]   which has failed.
[01:32:56.420 --> 01:32:58.900]   Granted, there was a lot of Ether in there,
[01:32:58.900 --> 01:33:01.100]   but I think that shook the credibility
[01:33:01.100 --> 01:33:05.540]   of the Ethereum system that happened back in 2016, I think.
[01:33:05.540 --> 01:33:09.580]   That was one reason why I became disenchanted with Ethereum.
[01:33:09.580 --> 01:33:12.580]   - So basically, even if in that case
[01:33:12.580 --> 01:33:15.620]   that might fix an important problem
[01:33:15.620 --> 01:33:19.300]   that opens the door to centralized,
[01:33:19.300 --> 01:33:22.660]   like manipulation of the protocol in the future.
[01:33:22.660 --> 01:33:24.220]   - Yeah, it basically demonstrates
[01:33:24.220 --> 01:33:27.180]   that there's certain elites at the protocol level
[01:33:27.180 --> 01:33:31.900]   that can exercise specific control over the system.
[01:33:31.900 --> 01:33:34.900]   And, you know, a lot of people have lost money
[01:33:34.900 --> 01:33:36.780]   in hacks on Ethereum.
[01:33:36.780 --> 01:33:40.580]   A lot of contracts have gone south, huge amount of value,
[01:33:40.580 --> 01:33:42.500]   but they didn't get a bailout.
[01:33:42.500 --> 01:33:44.300]   And it was just when, you know,
[01:33:44.300 --> 01:33:48.340]   this specific contract called the DAO, D-A-O,
[01:33:48.340 --> 01:33:53.580]   was hacked that, you know, the leadership intervened.
[01:33:53.580 --> 01:33:55.140]   And, you know, to their credit,
[01:33:55.140 --> 01:33:57.460]   they haven't had a significant intervention
[01:33:57.460 --> 01:34:01.980]   or bailout since then, but it did normalize the practice.
[01:34:01.980 --> 01:34:04.660]   And I think it weakened the social contract.
[01:34:04.660 --> 01:34:07.820]   So I would prefer that you sort of bite the bullet
[01:34:07.820 --> 01:34:12.300]   in that situation and you accept the failure of that contract
[01:34:12.300 --> 01:34:15.620]   - That would be a ballsy move to bite that bullet.
[01:34:15.620 --> 01:34:17.660]   - Yeah, I mean, and then you would have had like
[01:34:17.660 --> 01:34:19.220]   what they thought was a malicious entity
[01:34:19.220 --> 01:34:21.580]   in control of a lot of coins.
[01:34:21.580 --> 01:34:23.660]   I think the real reason they sort of felt
[01:34:23.660 --> 01:34:27.000]   that they had to undo it was because they'd always planned
[01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.420]   to move to this proof of stake world
[01:34:29.420 --> 01:34:32.000]   where your political control over the system
[01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.800]   is a function of your wealth in the system.
[01:34:34.800 --> 01:34:36.980]   And they didn't want this attacker,
[01:34:36.980 --> 01:34:40.260]   which would have inherited all this significant wealth
[01:34:40.260 --> 01:34:44.460]   to have influence over that future proof of stake version.
[01:34:44.460 --> 01:34:46.020]   That's sort of my theory.
[01:34:46.020 --> 01:34:47.660]   - Yeah, I mean, that makes sense.
[01:34:47.660 --> 01:34:53.380]   It kind of reminds me of the bailout of car companies.
[01:34:53.380 --> 01:34:56.620]   You know, this is difficult.
[01:34:56.620 --> 01:34:58.980]   There's a lot of people that criticize the bailout
[01:34:58.980 --> 01:35:01.860]   of these large companies, you know, but.
[01:35:01.860 --> 01:35:02.960]   - Creative destruction.
[01:35:02.960 --> 01:35:05.460]   I mean, I was critical of the bailouts
[01:35:05.460 --> 01:35:07.540]   that happened during COVID.
[01:35:07.540 --> 01:35:10.220]   I mean, I generally think that it's healthier
[01:35:10.220 --> 01:35:13.700]   for society for bad firms that aren't making money
[01:35:13.700 --> 01:35:17.300]   to fail or be reorganized under the various,
[01:35:17.300 --> 01:35:19.260]   you know, forms of bankruptcy.
[01:35:19.260 --> 01:35:21.740]   And you saw what happens.
[01:35:21.740 --> 01:35:25.820]   You see the, you know, the corporate sector in Japan
[01:35:25.820 --> 01:35:29.340]   in the '90s, there was this like slow motion insolvency
[01:35:29.340 --> 01:35:32.340]   where basically firms weren't allowed to fail.
[01:35:32.340 --> 01:35:35.660]   And the Japanese corporate sector lost competitiveness
[01:35:35.660 --> 01:35:38.380]   because bad firms did not fail.
[01:35:38.380 --> 01:35:41.740]   And so, you know, the process of actual capitalism
[01:35:41.740 --> 01:35:44.260]   for the market clearing didn't occur.
[01:35:44.260 --> 01:35:48.060]   So I'm always in support of, you know,
[01:35:48.060 --> 01:35:50.500]   of the free market being allowed to clear
[01:35:50.500 --> 01:35:52.980]   for non-profitable firms to fail.
[01:35:52.980 --> 01:35:57.740]   - It's complicated, man, 'cause creative destruction
[01:35:57.740 --> 01:36:00.140]   seems to be in the long term a positive,
[01:36:00.140 --> 01:36:06.340]   but human civilization is such that short-term pain
[01:36:07.340 --> 01:36:09.900]   has real impact on people, you know?
[01:36:09.900 --> 01:36:12.340]   - Yeah, policy makers don't ever want to incur
[01:36:12.340 --> 01:36:16.380]   that short-term pain because they have a short-term outlook
[01:36:16.380 --> 01:36:18.980]   and term limits often, so.
[01:36:18.980 --> 01:36:21.780]   - But, and also just it's short-term pain.
[01:36:21.780 --> 01:36:24.100]   Forget policy makers, forget politicians.
[01:36:24.100 --> 01:36:28.980]   It sucks to lose a job for an individual.
[01:36:28.980 --> 01:36:31.300]   You know, you could say the company,
[01:36:31.300 --> 01:36:33.540]   creative destruction of a company
[01:36:33.540 --> 01:36:35.460]   means the company was inefficient
[01:36:35.460 --> 01:36:37.900]   and that's going to have a ripple effect
[01:36:37.900 --> 01:36:39.100]   of teaching everybody else
[01:36:39.100 --> 01:36:41.580]   what an efficient operation looks like.
[01:36:41.580 --> 01:36:44.060]   But like, there's jobs that are being lost.
[01:36:44.060 --> 01:36:46.500]   There's families that have to suffer because of that.
[01:36:46.500 --> 01:36:49.540]   I mean, that's a tension we live in society
[01:36:49.540 --> 01:36:53.780]   is having a basic safety net for our world
[01:36:53.780 --> 01:36:58.900]   because there's a level beyond which,
[01:36:58.900 --> 01:37:01.500]   like if through creative destruction,
[01:37:01.500 --> 01:37:03.700]   that you have some percent of the population
[01:37:03.700 --> 01:37:06.020]   that dips below a certain level
[01:37:06.020 --> 01:37:08.580]   that you would call like suffering.
[01:37:08.580 --> 01:37:10.060]   We don't want that.
[01:37:10.060 --> 01:37:11.860]   And that's a difficult thing to live with.
[01:37:11.860 --> 01:37:14.500]   Like, yes, in the long-term,
[01:37:14.500 --> 01:37:18.500]   you want inefficiency to be destroyed
[01:37:18.500 --> 01:37:21.700]   and efficiency to be rewarded,
[01:37:21.700 --> 01:37:24.180]   but there does seem to be a base level
[01:37:24.180 --> 01:37:27.860]   of like quality of life that we want to uphold.
[01:37:27.860 --> 01:37:29.420]   That's a difficult thing to think about.
[01:37:29.420 --> 01:37:30.380]   I think about that a lot.
[01:37:30.380 --> 01:37:32.460]   There's a doctor called Paul Farmer
[01:37:33.340 --> 01:37:38.340]   that, you know, there's like in Haiti or in Africa,
[01:37:38.340 --> 01:37:41.540]   there's a child who's dying.
[01:37:41.540 --> 01:37:45.860]   And as a doctor, you want to give everything you have,
[01:37:45.860 --> 01:37:48.440]   all the money you have to save that one child.
[01:37:48.440 --> 01:37:52.780]   But there, you know, and you do actually,
[01:37:52.780 --> 01:37:57.700]   but that's a very human action.
[01:37:57.700 --> 01:38:02.100]   It's not an economic, it's not a rational action
[01:38:02.100 --> 01:38:03.580]   from a game theoretic perspective,
[01:38:03.580 --> 01:38:05.860]   because there's no way you can take that action
[01:38:05.860 --> 01:38:07.780]   for every child who is suffering.
[01:38:07.780 --> 01:38:09.860]   But there's something deeply human about doing that
[01:38:09.860 --> 01:38:12.060]   for that one particular child.
[01:38:12.060 --> 01:38:13.460]   In that same sense,
[01:38:13.460 --> 01:38:16.640]   creative destruction is an economic principle,
[01:38:16.640 --> 01:38:22.220]   but it's not necessarily that same kind of human principle.
[01:38:22.220 --> 01:38:23.860]   And there's a tension there.
[01:38:23.860 --> 01:38:24.980]   - I see it.
[01:38:24.980 --> 01:38:27.380]   I mean, I think that's the issue
[01:38:27.380 --> 01:38:29.140]   with modern central banking really,
[01:38:29.140 --> 01:38:31.980]   is that the central bank always has an incentive
[01:38:31.980 --> 01:38:34.180]   to lower interest rates.
[01:38:34.180 --> 01:38:37.260]   And they've been doing that from the '70s towards today
[01:38:37.260 --> 01:38:40.980]   on this, you know, well '80s really on the slow march down,
[01:38:40.980 --> 01:38:44.900]   because whenever there was a hint of a crisis in the economy
[01:38:44.900 --> 01:38:48.100]   or financial asset prices started to fall,
[01:38:48.100 --> 01:38:49.460]   their reaction is, okay,
[01:38:49.460 --> 01:38:52.780]   we'll inject more capital into the economy, we'll save it.
[01:38:52.780 --> 01:38:57.580]   But my view is that these palliative short-term measures
[01:38:57.580 --> 01:38:59.500]   cause the buildup of a huge amount of fragility
[01:38:59.500 --> 01:39:00.620]   in the long-term.
[01:39:00.620 --> 01:39:03.420]   And then the ultimate collapse is much worse
[01:39:03.420 --> 01:39:05.140]   than the counterfactual situation
[01:39:05.140 --> 01:39:07.420]   where you raise interest rates,
[01:39:07.420 --> 01:39:12.220]   you took your medicine, and the economy was healthier.
[01:39:12.220 --> 01:39:15.540]   So, and that's sort of, that's why people like Ray Dalio
[01:39:15.540 --> 01:39:19.080]   point out that you have these long-term debt cycles,
[01:39:19.080 --> 01:39:21.420]   and we're sort of at the end of one now,
[01:39:21.420 --> 01:39:24.340]   is because we couldn't take our medicine,
[01:39:24.340 --> 01:39:28.100]   we couldn't let interest rates clear.
[01:39:28.100 --> 01:39:31.900]   We constantly wanted to ward off any difficulty,
[01:39:31.900 --> 01:39:34.600]   and we didn't ever want to deleverage, truly.
[01:39:34.600 --> 01:39:39.540]   And then when the debt crisis happens and it hits,
[01:39:39.540 --> 01:39:41.440]   it's horrendously bad.
[01:39:41.440 --> 01:39:46.620]   - So do you think Bitcoin might reach
[01:39:46.620 --> 01:39:49.260]   a million dollars in value?
[01:39:49.260 --> 01:39:52.580]   It's having a current resurgence,
[01:39:52.580 --> 01:39:55.700]   a crazy one in 2021 in the recent months,
[01:39:55.700 --> 01:39:59.260]   of over 60,000 I guess it is now.
[01:39:59.260 --> 01:40:01.660]   Do you think it's possible it goes over 100,000?
[01:40:01.660 --> 01:40:03.500]   Do you think it's possible it goes to a million?
[01:40:03.500 --> 01:40:06.380]   - You can't rule anything out with Bitcoin.
[01:40:06.380 --> 01:40:09.580]   So, I mean, I'm not one to put price targets on it,
[01:40:09.580 --> 01:40:12.260]   but one way it could reach a million dollars
[01:40:12.260 --> 01:40:15.300]   is Bitcoin's value stays unchanged in real terms.
[01:40:15.300 --> 01:40:16.140]   - And dollar crashes.
[01:40:16.140 --> 01:40:18.380]   - And the dollar depreciates against it.
[01:40:18.380 --> 01:40:22.500]   Not that I expect hyperinflation, but yeah,
[01:40:22.500 --> 01:40:25.380]   I mean, look, Bitcoin is worth about 1/10,
[01:40:25.380 --> 01:40:28.860]   slightly under 1/10 the value of all the gold in the world.
[01:40:28.860 --> 01:40:31.700]   And gold is worth 10 trillion,
[01:40:31.700 --> 01:40:34.320]   11 trillion dollars in the aggregate.
[01:40:34.320 --> 01:40:36.740]   Do I think Bitcoin can be more culturally
[01:40:36.740 --> 01:40:41.620]   and economically salient than gold in two decades time?
[01:40:41.620 --> 01:40:43.380]   100%.
[01:40:43.380 --> 01:40:46.420]   Bitcoin was unknown 12 years ago,
[01:40:46.420 --> 01:40:50.000]   and today 100 million people worldwide own Bitcoin.
[01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:51.820]   So just extrapolate that.
[01:40:51.820 --> 01:40:54.660]   What is the level of penetration you think we'll get?
[01:40:54.660 --> 01:40:56.340]   500 million, a billion?
[01:40:56.340 --> 01:41:02.460]   You can easily tune these adoption curves however you like.
[01:41:02.460 --> 01:41:05.860]   I don't think it's done monetizing
[01:41:05.860 --> 01:41:08.260]   and being adopted globally.
[01:41:08.260 --> 01:41:10.620]   - Do you think it can become the base layer
[01:41:10.620 --> 01:41:12.300]   for a lot of our financial operation,
[01:41:12.300 --> 01:41:16.460]   like become the main base layer for all our transactions?
[01:41:16.460 --> 01:41:20.860]   So even banks will use Bitcoin essentially,
[01:41:20.860 --> 01:41:23.900]   and Visa would use Bitcoin as the base layer.
[01:41:23.900 --> 01:41:25.820]   It would actually operate very similarly
[01:41:25.820 --> 01:41:27.300]   at the surface layer,
[01:41:27.300 --> 01:41:29.860]   but at the base layer it would all be Bitcoin.
[01:41:29.860 --> 01:41:31.460]   - That's precisely what I expect.
[01:41:31.460 --> 01:41:34.380]   And banks and Visa are already using Bitcoin.
[01:41:34.380 --> 01:41:39.380]   So Visa has embraced Bitcoin in a really big way actually.
[01:41:39.380 --> 01:41:41.500]   And it's always funny to the people saying
[01:41:41.500 --> 01:41:43.620]   Bitcoin has to change in a certain way
[01:41:43.620 --> 01:41:45.300]   so it can compete with Visa.
[01:41:45.300 --> 01:41:49.200]   No, Visa adopted Bitcoin, right?
[01:41:49.200 --> 01:41:51.040]   PayPal adopted Bitcoin.
[01:41:51.040 --> 01:41:53.060]   Square adopted Bitcoin.
[01:41:53.060 --> 01:41:54.300]   Obviously they're not tearing out
[01:41:54.300 --> 01:41:55.980]   all of their existing infrastructure,
[01:41:55.980 --> 01:41:59.620]   but they're totally engaging with this thing.
[01:41:59.620 --> 01:42:01.660]   Banks have now begun,
[01:42:01.660 --> 01:42:04.900]   they got the green light to provide custody for Bitcoin
[01:42:04.900 --> 01:42:05.940]   for their depositors.
[01:42:05.940 --> 01:42:07.580]   That's the first step.
[01:42:07.580 --> 01:42:11.340]   Eventually, it'll happen one of two ways.
[01:42:11.340 --> 01:42:13.540]   Either Bitcoin native financial institutions
[01:42:13.540 --> 01:42:14.900]   will become banks.
[01:42:14.900 --> 01:42:16.460]   That's already happening.
[01:42:16.460 --> 01:42:19.780]   There's Bitcoin exchanges that have gotten banking licenses.
[01:42:19.780 --> 01:42:22.940]   Or banks themselves will start to engage with Bitcoin
[01:42:22.940 --> 01:42:24.780]   as a reserve asset.
[01:42:24.780 --> 01:42:26.140]   It'll converge either way.
[01:42:26.140 --> 01:42:28.860]   That's totally happening.
[01:42:28.860 --> 01:42:30.620]   And yes, I mean, I don't think Bitcoin
[01:42:30.620 --> 01:42:32.620]   is gonna power every financial transaction.
[01:42:32.620 --> 01:42:35.900]   I think it'll coexist alongside sovereign currencies,
[01:42:35.900 --> 01:42:39.780]   but I think it's a great reserve asset.
[01:42:39.780 --> 01:42:41.380]   It's a very powerful asset
[01:42:41.380 --> 01:42:43.980]   to build a financial system on top of
[01:42:43.980 --> 01:42:46.120]   because it's highly, highly auditable.
[01:42:46.120 --> 01:42:49.060]   It's something that you can take physical delivery of
[01:42:49.060 --> 01:42:49.900]   very cheaply.
[01:42:49.900 --> 01:42:51.740]   And those are great qualities.
[01:42:51.740 --> 01:42:53.900]   If you're a depositor in a bank,
[01:42:53.900 --> 01:42:56.460]   they can prove to you how much Bitcoin they have.
[01:42:56.460 --> 01:42:59.460]   They can't really easily prove in the old system
[01:42:59.460 --> 01:43:01.940]   how much gold they held on deposit.
[01:43:01.940 --> 01:43:04.180]   And you can easily conduct a run on the bank.
[01:43:04.180 --> 01:43:07.620]   You can hold them accountable because you can withdraw it
[01:43:07.620 --> 01:43:11.340]   because making a Bitcoin transaction is pretty easy
[01:43:11.340 --> 01:43:12.520]   at the end of the day.
[01:43:12.520 --> 01:43:14.580]   Unlike fiat currency, it's like kind of,
[01:43:14.580 --> 01:43:17.220]   you can't really withdraw all your dollars from the bank.
[01:43:17.220 --> 01:43:19.180]   I mean, you sort of can,
[01:43:19.180 --> 01:43:20.940]   but you're not gonna wanna take delivery
[01:43:20.940 --> 01:43:23.540]   of pounds of cash or anything like that.
[01:43:23.540 --> 01:43:26.580]   So it's a good modern asset
[01:43:26.580 --> 01:43:29.780]   upon which to build a financial system, basically.
[01:43:29.780 --> 01:43:34.940]   - You mentioned Square and Visa sort of investing in Bitcoin.
[01:43:34.940 --> 01:43:38.260]   What do you make of probably one of the higher profile,
[01:43:38.260 --> 01:43:42.100]   big investments in Bitcoin, which is Tesla and Elon Musk,
[01:43:42.100 --> 01:43:44.060]   but there's also a few billionaires like Chamath
[01:43:44.060 --> 01:43:45.820]   and all of them investing.
[01:43:45.820 --> 01:43:47.060]   What do you make of this whole movement?
[01:43:47.060 --> 01:43:48.600]   Why do you think they're doing it?
[01:43:48.600 --> 01:43:50.140]   I mean, Tesla's an interesting case.
[01:43:50.140 --> 01:43:54.260]   Why do you think Tesla's buying so much Bitcoin?
[01:43:54.260 --> 01:43:55.220]   - I honestly don't know.
[01:43:55.220 --> 01:43:56.580]   And I would love to truly know
[01:43:56.580 --> 01:43:58.860]   Elon's genuine thoughts on Bitcoin
[01:43:58.860 --> 01:44:03.580]   because he's kind of sending us mixed messages, honestly,
[01:44:03.580 --> 01:44:08.420]   with his embrace of Dogecoin, which is sort of playful,
[01:44:08.420 --> 01:44:11.100]   not exactly sure what point he's trying to make there.
[01:44:11.100 --> 01:44:12.620]   - So you were involved with Dogecoin,
[01:44:12.620 --> 01:44:15.660]   you mentioned offline a little bit in the early days,
[01:44:15.660 --> 01:44:18.860]   or at least played around with it.
[01:44:18.860 --> 01:44:20.220]   What do you make of Dogecoin?
[01:44:20.220 --> 01:44:21.700]   What do you make of Elon and Doge?
[01:44:21.700 --> 01:44:25.980]   What do you make of this particular meme coin?
[01:44:25.980 --> 01:44:30.100]   Is it one, like a legitimate cryptocurrency,
[01:44:30.100 --> 01:44:34.820]   or is it two, like a funny internet way
[01:44:34.820 --> 01:44:36.860]   of saying F you to the man?
[01:44:36.860 --> 01:44:39.140]   - Yeah, it's a good question.
[01:44:39.140 --> 01:44:41.860]   I mean, so I wasn't like a figurehead in Dogecoin
[01:44:41.860 --> 01:44:44.860]   or anything, but that was totally my introduction to crypto
[01:44:44.860 --> 01:44:47.740]   was mining Dogecoin in my dorm room
[01:44:47.740 --> 01:44:51.420]   and then tipping people online in Dogecoin,
[01:44:51.420 --> 01:44:54.080]   which I just thought was the funniest thing.
[01:44:54.080 --> 01:44:59.580]   So I guess that was really easy to entertain back in 2013.
[01:44:59.580 --> 01:45:02.140]   But it was very playful at the time.
[01:45:02.140 --> 01:45:04.500]   There was a culture around Dogecoin
[01:45:04.500 --> 01:45:07.780]   and the people liked it because it was in opposition
[01:45:07.780 --> 01:45:10.340]   to the Bitcoin culture, which was really serious
[01:45:10.340 --> 01:45:13.260]   and involved lots of Austrian economics
[01:45:13.260 --> 01:45:15.940]   and Rothbard and Hayek and stuff like that.
[01:45:15.940 --> 01:45:19.580]   So that was my introduction to cryptocurrency
[01:45:19.580 --> 01:45:22.840]   was because I thought the Bitcoin people were pretty lame
[01:45:22.840 --> 01:45:25.620]   and they were way too serious about all this stuff.
[01:45:25.620 --> 01:45:28.260]   And I was like, okay, I'll just be a part
[01:45:28.260 --> 01:45:29.220]   of the Dogecoin community.
[01:45:29.220 --> 01:45:31.860]   And they did all these funny publicity stunts.
[01:45:31.860 --> 01:45:35.580]   They paid to send the Jamaican bobsled team to the Olympics.
[01:45:35.580 --> 01:45:38.380]   Great stuff.
[01:45:38.380 --> 01:45:41.100]   They put the Dogecoin logo on top of a NASCAR car.
[01:45:41.100 --> 01:45:43.900]   And that tickled me so much
[01:45:43.900 --> 01:45:47.020]   because it's like this made up internet coin.
[01:45:47.020 --> 01:45:48.820]   This was back when crypto was pretty novel
[01:45:48.820 --> 01:45:51.060]   and still kind of funny and stuff.
[01:45:51.060 --> 01:45:53.280]   And that was really entertaining.
[01:45:53.280 --> 01:45:55.940]   Fast forward seven, eight years,
[01:45:55.940 --> 01:45:58.420]   Dogecoin is way less entertaining now, frankly,
[01:45:58.420 --> 01:46:01.260]   because the leadership left,
[01:46:01.260 --> 01:46:03.980]   the community spirit evaporated.
[01:46:03.980 --> 01:46:06.180]   The meme didn't persist.
[01:46:06.180 --> 01:46:09.260]   I mean, Doge itself is not really a contemporary meme.
[01:46:09.260 --> 01:46:10.460]   I mean, it's an old meme.
[01:46:10.460 --> 01:46:12.580]   - Although that new refresh of the meme,
[01:46:12.580 --> 01:46:15.740]   like Doge, I haven't heard that name in a long time.
[01:46:15.740 --> 01:46:19.060]   Or Doge is like in a hat smoking a cigarette.
[01:46:19.060 --> 01:46:20.180]   I mean, there's some sense
[01:46:20.180 --> 01:46:22.980]   where Elon is reinvigorating the meme.
[01:46:22.980 --> 01:46:25.340]   And it's funny 'cause one influential figure
[01:46:25.340 --> 01:46:29.460]   could do just that, which just speaks to the tension
[01:46:29.460 --> 01:46:30.680]   that you're talking about.
[01:46:30.680 --> 01:46:32.860]   Like Tesla's investing Bitcoin,
[01:46:32.860 --> 01:46:37.620]   and yet Elon, he also tweets about Bitcoin, but he's--
[01:46:37.620 --> 01:46:40.420]   - I mean, who am I to question the meme, right?
[01:46:40.420 --> 01:46:44.260]   Like I can't dissect internet culture
[01:46:44.260 --> 01:46:47.460]   and panantically sit here and tell you it's an invalid meme.
[01:46:47.460 --> 01:46:50.620]   If people believe in it, then it's real.
[01:46:50.620 --> 01:46:54.100]   - Is there a space for meme coins at this time,
[01:46:54.100 --> 01:46:57.520]   like Doge or somebody else to almost like,
[01:46:57.520 --> 01:47:01.360]   it does serve a lot of purposes,
[01:47:01.360 --> 01:47:04.880]   which is, like you said, it pulls in people
[01:47:04.880 --> 01:47:07.460]   into this whole space of digital currency
[01:47:07.460 --> 01:47:12.460]   and into cryptocurrency, allow them to explore,
[01:47:12.460 --> 01:47:13.780]   allow them to have fun
[01:47:13.780 --> 01:47:16.460]   as opposed to taking everything very seriously.
[01:47:16.460 --> 01:47:17.860]   Is there still space for that?
[01:47:17.860 --> 01:47:19.440]   - Yeah, yeah, and I mean,
[01:47:19.440 --> 01:47:22.020]   the crypto landscape is very broad today.
[01:47:22.020 --> 01:47:26.680]   So whatever cultural element you seek to find
[01:47:26.680 --> 01:47:28.860]   within crypto, you will find.
[01:47:28.860 --> 01:47:30.660]   It was a bit different in 2013
[01:47:30.660 --> 01:47:33.260]   because Bitcoin was kind of the only game in town.
[01:47:33.260 --> 01:47:34.980]   There were a couple altcoins.
[01:47:34.980 --> 01:47:38.660]   And so Dogecoin made a lot of sense as a counterpart
[01:47:38.660 --> 01:47:41.060]   to Bitcoin as a less serious counterpart.
[01:47:41.060 --> 01:47:44.100]   Today, crypto is just this like gigantic cultural
[01:47:44.100 --> 01:47:45.800]   and economic trend.
[01:47:45.800 --> 01:47:48.760]   So it's very multifaceted.
[01:47:48.760 --> 01:47:52.220]   Dogecoin is one of the many ways
[01:47:52.220 --> 01:47:54.380]   that people have to engage with it.
[01:47:54.380 --> 01:47:56.580]   I think a lot of people that buy Dogecoin
[01:47:56.580 --> 01:48:00.700]   based on Elon's implied guidance are gonna lose money
[01:48:00.700 --> 01:48:03.340]   because fundamentally there's nothing enduring
[01:48:03.340 --> 01:48:04.180]   about Dogecoin.
[01:48:04.180 --> 01:48:07.300]   It's an ancient fork of Bitcoin.
[01:48:07.300 --> 01:48:08.620]   It's unmaintained.
[01:48:08.620 --> 01:48:13.580]   It's probably at risk actually from a protocol perspective.
[01:48:13.580 --> 01:48:15.880]   It's merge mind with Litecoin, I think.
[01:48:15.880 --> 01:48:19.460]   If there was an inflation bug on Dogecoin,
[01:48:19.460 --> 01:48:23.260]   it's unclear who would sort of be able to remediate that.
[01:48:23.260 --> 01:48:27.660]   So it's not technologically very sound.
[01:48:27.660 --> 01:48:31.420]   So I wouldn't recommend that anyone stores wealth in it.
[01:48:31.420 --> 01:48:34.700]   - Yes, it's funny 'cause cryptocurrency,
[01:48:34.700 --> 01:48:37.100]   like my interest in cryptocurrency
[01:48:37.100 --> 01:48:39.720]   is in the exploration of technical ideas.
[01:48:39.720 --> 01:48:45.240]   But cryptocurrency is also, like in the case of Dogecoin,
[01:48:45.240 --> 01:48:50.240]   like for LOLs, at least originally, like a meme coin,
[01:48:50.240 --> 01:48:55.600]   but it's also a mechanism for investment.
[01:48:55.600 --> 01:48:59.900]   And so those are sometimes a tension.
[01:49:01.020 --> 01:49:01.940]   - 100%.
[01:49:01.940 --> 01:49:04.780]   - And it's unclear, sort of like, yeah,
[01:49:04.780 --> 01:49:07.780]   you know, the meme with Doge has almost become
[01:49:07.780 --> 01:49:09.900]   to take it to, I guess, to a dollar,
[01:49:09.900 --> 01:49:13.300]   trying to drive the price of the value up to a dollar.
[01:49:13.300 --> 01:49:17.060]   But, you know, implied in that is like this overlap
[01:49:17.060 --> 01:49:20.260]   of the meme coin and like legitimate investment.
[01:49:20.260 --> 01:49:23.020]   And so you have a lot of young people, I think,
[01:49:23.020 --> 01:49:27.940]   who almost start getting greedy and wanna make money,
[01:49:27.940 --> 01:49:31.660]   like as opposed to having fun.
[01:49:31.660 --> 01:49:33.380]   And that becomes a different beast then
[01:49:33.380 --> 01:49:37.780]   because you're essentially making financial decisions
[01:49:37.780 --> 01:49:40.380]   that can have a long lasting, like, you know,
[01:49:40.380 --> 01:49:41.780]   money is freedom.
[01:49:41.780 --> 01:49:47.820]   And if you make stupid financial decisions,
[01:49:47.820 --> 01:49:50.140]   you can remove freedom from your life.
[01:49:50.140 --> 01:49:53.020]   And that's, it can be detrimental in that sense.
[01:49:53.020 --> 01:49:56.140]   So I don't, it's difficult, I don't know what to do
[01:49:56.140 --> 01:49:59.780]   with that set of ideas because a lot of cryptocurrency,
[01:49:59.780 --> 01:50:03.180]   including Bitcoin, is very volatile because it's new.
[01:50:03.180 --> 01:50:07.300]   So you're trying to figure out the space of like,
[01:50:07.300 --> 01:50:11.500]   what's actually going to be a large part of,
[01:50:11.500 --> 01:50:12.980]   like you speak of network effects,
[01:50:12.980 --> 01:50:15.380]   like what's going to take over the world.
[01:50:15.380 --> 01:50:16.980]   And through that process,
[01:50:16.980 --> 01:50:19.180]   there's going to be a lot of volatility.
[01:50:19.180 --> 01:50:22.980]   And if you're talking about cryptocurrency
[01:50:22.980 --> 01:50:26.900]   as a investment mechanism,
[01:50:26.900 --> 01:50:29.500]   then it can have a real detrimental effects
[01:50:29.500 --> 01:50:31.180]   on people's lives.
[01:50:31.180 --> 01:50:33.660]   - Yeah, and that's really the challenge
[01:50:33.660 --> 01:50:37.260]   with operating in the crypto space, talking about it,
[01:50:37.260 --> 01:50:39.980]   overlaid on top of everything that's interesting
[01:50:39.980 --> 01:50:41.940]   politically or culturally about it
[01:50:41.940 --> 01:50:44.020]   is the financial incentive.
[01:50:44.020 --> 01:50:48.020]   And so, you know, it's not all fun and games
[01:50:48.020 --> 01:50:50.780]   because there are literally billions
[01:50:50.780 --> 01:50:53.700]   over a trillion dollars at stake now.
[01:50:53.700 --> 01:50:55.700]   So if you buy Dogecoin,
[01:50:55.700 --> 01:50:58.820]   because some influencer on TikTok said so,
[01:50:58.820 --> 01:51:00.980]   you've now made a financial decision, right?
[01:51:00.980 --> 01:51:04.100]   So I'm not going to scold any Dogecoin buyers
[01:51:04.100 --> 01:51:07.180]   or any crypto asset buyer for that matter,
[01:51:07.180 --> 01:51:10.860]   but be aware that there are like billions of dollars
[01:51:10.860 --> 01:51:15.140]   of really elite hedge funds that are trying to front run
[01:51:15.140 --> 01:51:18.300]   all of your decisions and evaluate social sentiment,
[01:51:18.300 --> 01:51:19.820]   things like that.
[01:51:19.820 --> 01:51:22.660]   So it's a water full of sharks, basically.
[01:51:22.660 --> 01:51:25.260]   And by the way, if you're listening to this,
[01:51:25.260 --> 01:51:26.860]   don't take this podcast
[01:51:26.860 --> 01:51:28.940]   or anything I ever say as financial advice.
[01:51:28.940 --> 01:51:32.340]   That's definitely not my interest or expertise level.
[01:51:32.340 --> 01:51:36.500]   Now the interest here is to explore different ideas.
[01:51:36.500 --> 01:51:40.060]   Speaking of which, you've written a little bit about NFTs.
[01:51:40.060 --> 01:51:43.820]   I'd be interested to hear your opinions
[01:51:43.820 --> 01:51:48.340]   on this space of ideas, these non-fungible tokens.
[01:51:49.220 --> 01:51:54.220]   They seem to have a cultural impact currently,
[01:51:54.220 --> 01:51:57.140]   but do they have a long lasting technical,
[01:51:57.140 --> 01:52:00.380]   financial or cultural impact, or is this just the Fed?
[01:52:00.380 --> 01:52:02.620]   What do you think of NFTs?
[01:52:02.620 --> 01:52:06.500]   - Yeah, I think the current enthusiasm for NFTs
[01:52:06.500 --> 01:52:08.340]   and the financial metrics you see,
[01:52:08.340 --> 01:52:10.740]   the growth there in that sector
[01:52:10.740 --> 01:52:13.100]   is partially a function of where we are
[01:52:13.100 --> 01:52:14.940]   in the actual credit cycle.
[01:52:14.940 --> 01:52:19.500]   So oftentimes when inflationary events occur,
[01:52:19.500 --> 01:52:22.300]   you have correspondence speculative manias
[01:52:22.300 --> 01:52:24.260]   that occur at the same time
[01:52:24.260 --> 01:52:26.580]   because people intuitively feel
[01:52:26.580 --> 01:52:30.100]   that the fiat currency that they hold is being debased.
[01:52:30.100 --> 01:52:31.780]   And so they frantically look around
[01:52:31.780 --> 01:52:33.140]   for other places to put it.
[01:52:33.140 --> 01:52:38.140]   So stocks, property, commodities,
[01:52:38.140 --> 01:52:43.580]   and then other asset classes, NFTs are an asset class.
[01:52:44.340 --> 01:52:46.300]   And this is a case with any inflation
[01:52:46.300 --> 01:52:48.140]   you look at in history,
[01:52:48.140 --> 01:52:50.700]   you saw these correspondence speculative manias,
[01:52:50.700 --> 01:52:53.860]   basically, speculative episodes.
[01:52:53.860 --> 01:52:57.420]   So a lot of us feel that inflation is occurring,
[01:52:57.420 --> 01:52:59.340]   whether it's in CPI or not,
[01:52:59.340 --> 01:53:00.660]   that basically lots of dollars
[01:53:00.660 --> 01:53:02.860]   are being injected into the economy.
[01:53:02.860 --> 01:53:05.340]   We've all seen stocks massively appreciate
[01:53:05.340 --> 01:53:07.580]   even as GDP contracted.
[01:53:07.580 --> 01:53:10.740]   And so a lot of people sort of got cottoned on
[01:53:10.740 --> 01:53:13.780]   to this notion that, wow, is the Fed,
[01:53:13.780 --> 01:53:14.980]   that lowers interest rates
[01:53:14.980 --> 01:53:18.780]   and Congress spends a huge amount of stimulus dollars
[01:53:18.780 --> 01:53:20.940]   into the economy, financial assets gonna go up,
[01:53:20.940 --> 01:53:23.860]   so I better have exposure to all that stuff.
[01:53:23.860 --> 01:53:26.820]   And so you see virtually every asset class
[01:53:26.820 --> 01:53:28.540]   is awash with cash right now.
[01:53:28.540 --> 01:53:31.300]   People are investing like their lives depend on it,
[01:53:31.300 --> 01:53:32.900]   investing, trading, whatever,
[01:53:32.900 --> 01:53:36.420]   whether it's options, volumes on Robinhood,
[01:53:36.420 --> 01:53:39.500]   like kind of retail brokerages, things like that,
[01:53:39.500 --> 01:53:42.580]   whether it's stocks, whether it's crypto,
[01:53:42.580 --> 01:53:44.860]   and then other collectibles, baseball cards,
[01:53:44.860 --> 01:53:47.100]   their valuations have been skyrocketing.
[01:53:47.100 --> 01:53:49.300]   And so I think NFTs are part of that.
[01:53:49.300 --> 01:53:50.860]   It's a new asset class.
[01:53:50.860 --> 01:53:54.020]   It's basically an opportunity to invest in sort of art
[01:53:54.020 --> 01:53:59.020]   or collectibles, in-game items, things like that.
[01:53:59.020 --> 01:54:03.860]   I think that explains a large degree of the enthusiasm,
[01:54:03.860 --> 01:54:06.260]   the excitement is that it's a novel asset class
[01:54:06.260 --> 01:54:08.140]   that people can trade.
[01:54:08.140 --> 01:54:12.660]   And right as these inflationary tailwinds pick up.
[01:54:12.660 --> 01:54:15.700]   Now as for the sort of virtues
[01:54:15.700 --> 01:54:19.740]   of the actual technical phenomenon,
[01:54:19.740 --> 01:54:21.780]   NFTs are actually not a new idea at all.
[01:54:21.780 --> 01:54:25.220]   So you've had NFTs, I didn't call them NFTs,
[01:54:25.220 --> 01:54:28.140]   but in 2016 built on Bitcoin, for instance.
[01:54:28.140 --> 01:54:30.220]   So it's been around for a while.
[01:54:30.220 --> 01:54:33.020]   What it is is a serial code,
[01:54:33.020 --> 01:54:35.100]   basically a string of data
[01:54:36.060 --> 01:54:38.740]   that is inserted onto a public blockchain
[01:54:38.740 --> 01:54:41.380]   and then circulates as a unique token.
[01:54:41.380 --> 01:54:42.700]   And then the question is, okay,
[01:54:42.700 --> 01:54:44.500]   well, what does that data refer to?
[01:54:44.500 --> 01:54:46.300]   What's the external reference?
[01:54:46.300 --> 01:54:47.860]   And that has to be defined.
[01:54:47.860 --> 01:54:50.060]   There has to be some entity which says,
[01:54:50.060 --> 01:54:53.540]   oh yeah, this unique string refers to like this piece of art
[01:54:53.540 --> 01:54:57.700]   or digital content or trading card or whatever.
[01:54:57.700 --> 01:55:00.860]   So NFT, the concept itself is like an incredibly broad idea.
[01:55:00.860 --> 01:55:04.580]   It's just, well, what if we took barcodes
[01:55:04.580 --> 01:55:08.020]   and put them on chain so that they could be traded
[01:55:08.020 --> 01:55:10.580]   and so they could circulate freely on a peer-to-peer basis
[01:55:10.580 --> 01:55:13.620]   and plugged into exchanges and things like that.
[01:55:13.620 --> 01:55:16.100]   So that concept is super valid,
[01:55:16.100 --> 01:55:20.340]   clearly has protocol market fit, right?
[01:55:20.340 --> 01:55:23.900]   People are using it for a really wide array of purposes.
[01:55:23.900 --> 01:55:26.220]   It's completely gonna exist.
[01:55:26.220 --> 01:55:30.700]   May the valuations contract of NFTs in the aggregate?
[01:55:30.700 --> 01:55:33.700]   Definitely possible, probably likely.
[01:55:33.700 --> 01:55:38.700]   But I think the notion of creating enduring collectibles
[01:55:38.700 --> 01:55:44.100]   or artworks that have accompanying signatures,
[01:55:44.100 --> 01:55:47.060]   basically autographed art on the blockchain,
[01:55:47.060 --> 01:55:48.700]   that has totally been validated.
[01:55:48.700 --> 01:55:50.780]   I think that won't go away.
[01:55:50.780 --> 01:55:54.820]   - I wonder if there's ideas like BitCloud, for example.
[01:55:54.820 --> 01:55:55.780]   I don't know if you saw that.
[01:55:55.780 --> 01:55:58.300]   If there's ideas built on top of this concept,
[01:55:58.300 --> 01:56:00.580]   it doesn't have to be like Ethereum, NFT.
[01:56:00.580 --> 01:56:04.020]   It could be just the concept of non-fungible tokens,
[01:56:04.020 --> 01:56:07.740]   whether those kinds of things could take hold.
[01:56:07.740 --> 01:56:11.700]   And it's less about financial transactions
[01:56:11.700 --> 01:56:14.540]   and more about almost like,
[01:56:14.540 --> 01:56:18.700]   I don't know how to put it,
[01:56:18.700 --> 01:56:23.420]   but like staking identity in some way,
[01:56:23.420 --> 01:56:26.500]   whether it's BitCloud or identity of objects.
[01:56:26.500 --> 01:56:30.340]   Like there might be some way of connecting physical reality
[01:56:30.340 --> 01:56:33.220]   and digital reality in some interesting ways.
[01:56:33.220 --> 01:56:36.980]   So just the financial aspect is a way to put
[01:56:36.980 --> 01:56:40.860]   some validity behind the identity.
[01:56:40.860 --> 01:56:43.620]   I wonder if there's ideas there
[01:56:43.620 --> 01:56:46.580]   that are yet to be discovered
[01:56:46.580 --> 01:56:50.700]   or ideas that are yet to take hold.
[01:56:50.700 --> 01:56:52.380]   Like BitCloud, it seems interesting.
[01:56:52.380 --> 01:56:54.960]   Seems shady as hell, seems a little scammy.
[01:56:54.960 --> 01:57:00.260]   I don't know if I like the idea that you can bet on people.
[01:57:00.260 --> 01:57:01.780]   - Essentially. - Right.
[01:57:01.780 --> 01:57:05.420]   Yeah, I think my market cap on BitCloud is like $90,000
[01:57:05.420 --> 01:57:07.660]   and I haven't done anything there, so.
[01:57:07.660 --> 01:57:13.300]   - Did you take, like verify yourself or whatever?
[01:57:13.300 --> 01:57:14.140]   - I have not.
[01:57:14.140 --> 01:57:17.460]   I think people would yell at me on Twitter if I did, so.
[01:57:17.460 --> 01:57:20.300]   - And it's unclear whether it's a scam yet or not, right?
[01:57:20.300 --> 01:57:22.420]   It's unclear where it's coming from.
[01:57:22.420 --> 01:57:27.180]   - Well, there is some details about the investors.
[01:57:27.180 --> 01:57:28.940]   It's backed by some pretty big name investors.
[01:57:28.940 --> 01:57:31.300]   So I probably wouldn't use the word scam to describe it,
[01:57:31.300 --> 01:57:34.260]   but it's got Ponzi-like dynamics,
[01:57:34.260 --> 01:57:36.100]   like everything in crypto.
[01:57:36.100 --> 01:57:38.340]   So there's very questionable.
[01:57:38.340 --> 01:57:40.780]   And then also, is it using people's likeness
[01:57:40.780 --> 01:57:42.980]   without their permission,
[01:57:42.980 --> 01:57:44.940]   which is, I think, a legal question.
[01:57:44.940 --> 01:57:47.540]   So there's open questions around it.
[01:57:47.540 --> 01:57:50.900]   But is our public blockchains
[01:57:50.900 --> 01:57:53.260]   and that sort of architecture,
[01:57:53.260 --> 01:57:55.860]   is that gonna be useful for decentralized
[01:57:55.860 --> 01:57:58.180]   or alternative forms of social media?
[01:57:58.180 --> 01:58:00.900]   - 100% yes.
[01:58:00.900 --> 01:58:03.380]   I'm super, super bullish on that idea.
[01:58:03.380 --> 01:58:08.340]   Basically, creating open protocols, open namespaces,
[01:58:08.340 --> 01:58:11.100]   ways to organize without the dependence
[01:58:11.100 --> 01:58:15.380]   on a single node, effectively, in Silicon Valley,
[01:58:15.380 --> 01:58:18.460]   the Twitter node or the Facebook node.
[01:58:18.460 --> 01:58:21.300]   I think it's a matter of urgency
[01:58:21.300 --> 01:58:24.620]   that we create digital gathering spaces
[01:58:24.620 --> 01:58:26.860]   where you have strong property rights.
[01:58:26.860 --> 01:58:28.500]   You have a claim on your identity.
[01:58:28.500 --> 01:58:30.580]   You have a claim on your data.
[01:58:30.580 --> 01:58:32.620]   And open architecture is our way to do that.
[01:58:32.620 --> 01:58:34.900]   I don't know if it'll be a blockchain,
[01:58:34.900 --> 01:58:39.740]   but certainly I think the general concept
[01:58:39.740 --> 01:58:42.740]   introduced by blockchains is a good template
[01:58:42.740 --> 01:58:45.900]   for how to organize these systems.
[01:58:45.900 --> 01:58:50.740]   - Yeah, value, freedom, value decentralization of power,
[01:58:50.740 --> 01:58:52.340]   whatever the mechanism.
[01:58:52.340 --> 01:58:53.900]   Let me ask you about love.
[01:58:55.020 --> 01:58:58.580]   - So there is a Bitcoin maximalist community
[01:58:58.580 --> 01:59:04.580]   that sometimes, so those folks in general
[01:59:04.580 --> 01:59:09.580]   have a strong belief that Bitcoin is good for the world.
[01:59:09.580 --> 01:59:11.580]   And it's almost an ethical imperative
[01:59:11.580 --> 01:59:16.500]   to sort of help Bitcoin succeed,
[01:59:16.500 --> 01:59:22.300]   which I think as a member of any community,
[01:59:22.300 --> 01:59:23.820]   I think it's beautiful to believe
[01:59:23.820 --> 01:59:26.020]   in the vision of the community.
[01:59:26.020 --> 01:59:28.660]   There does seem to be some properties
[01:59:28.660 --> 01:59:32.220]   of what some may call like toxicity
[01:59:32.220 --> 01:59:35.420]   or derision and mockery and those kinds of things.
[01:59:35.420 --> 01:59:41.180]   Some folks have criticized this, right?
[01:59:41.180 --> 01:59:44.940]   That Bitcoin maximalism is not necessarily good
[01:59:44.940 --> 01:59:48.400]   for the world, even if Bitcoin is good for the world.
[01:59:48.400 --> 01:59:53.300]   What are your thoughts about this kind of approach,
[01:59:53.300 --> 01:59:58.300]   philosophically or practically to the spread of Bitcoin?
[01:59:58.300 --> 02:00:02.940]   And is there a way that we can add more love to the world
[02:00:02.940 --> 02:00:05.620]   while we add more Bitcoin to the world?
[02:00:05.620 --> 02:00:07.100]   - Oh, that's a great question.
[02:00:07.100 --> 02:00:09.500]   I mean, Bitcoin is sort of what you make of it.
[02:00:09.500 --> 02:00:12.940]   So you can define your own path
[02:00:12.940 --> 02:00:17.380]   as you advocate for Bitcoin or don't for that matter.
[02:00:17.380 --> 02:00:21.860]   So my chosen approach is the approach you see here,
[02:00:21.860 --> 02:00:24.980]   which I try to minimize the amount
[02:00:24.980 --> 02:00:26.780]   of sort of harshness or mockery,
[02:00:26.780 --> 02:00:30.580]   although I've been known to be mean on Twitter too.
[02:00:30.580 --> 02:00:32.860]   - Well, Twitter is a specific, sorry to interrupt,
[02:00:32.860 --> 02:00:36.380]   is a specific media where this takes its worst form.
[02:00:36.380 --> 02:00:38.860]   So I'm learning, listen, I'm actually,
[02:00:38.860 --> 02:00:40.460]   because of this podcast, but in general,
[02:00:40.460 --> 02:00:42.580]   I'm part of different communities.
[02:00:42.580 --> 02:00:46.740]   And some are full of like unabashed love
[02:00:46.740 --> 02:00:50.060]   and some are like, what I experienced on Twitter,
[02:00:50.060 --> 02:00:51.980]   the Bitcoin community at first,
[02:00:51.980 --> 02:00:56.980]   I was off put in terms of the intensity, the mockery,
[02:00:56.980 --> 02:00:58.020]   - I bet, yeah.
[02:00:58.020 --> 02:01:00.500]   - The layers of lull,
[02:01:00.500 --> 02:01:05.580]   like the layers of not taking anything seriously.
[02:01:05.580 --> 02:01:08.500]   And I think there's power to that.
[02:01:08.500 --> 02:01:09.580]   There's freedom to that.
[02:01:09.580 --> 02:01:10.700]   I appreciate it.
[02:01:10.700 --> 02:01:15.340]   I have respect for it, but it's not my thing on Twitter.
[02:01:15.340 --> 02:01:18.900]   It's just not the way I enjoy communicating on Twitter.
[02:01:18.900 --> 02:01:20.860]   I retired from Twitter.
[02:01:20.860 --> 02:01:23.420]   I hit a hundred thousand followers and then I retired.
[02:01:23.420 --> 02:01:25.220]   So I'm free now.
[02:01:25.220 --> 02:01:26.340]   I don't have to tweet anymore.
[02:01:26.340 --> 02:01:27.420]   It's great.
[02:01:27.420 --> 02:01:29.620]   But I totally can see the point.
[02:01:29.620 --> 02:01:34.220]   I wish that Bitcoiners were gentler in their approach.
[02:01:34.220 --> 02:01:36.500]   Not all Bitcoiners are like that, of course.
[02:01:36.500 --> 02:01:39.500]   There's 50 to a hundred million of them worldwide
[02:01:39.500 --> 02:01:42.340]   and a few tens of thousands on Twitter.
[02:01:42.340 --> 02:01:44.060]   So I'm not gonna claim
[02:01:44.060 --> 02:01:46.260]   that they're necessarily representative.
[02:01:46.260 --> 02:01:49.700]   The toxicity though is kind of a learned habit
[02:01:49.700 --> 02:01:53.860]   because Bitcoin has had so many episodes
[02:01:53.860 --> 02:01:57.060]   where strong willed institutions,
[02:01:57.060 --> 02:01:57.900]   - The dice.
[02:01:57.900 --> 02:02:00.380]   - Billionaires, the dice are pretty toxic,
[02:02:00.380 --> 02:02:01.380]   you could say, right?
[02:02:01.380 --> 02:02:04.380]   I'm basically mocking critics of Bitcoin.
[02:02:04.380 --> 02:02:05.900]   - But at the same time,
[02:02:05.900 --> 02:02:08.380]   you're saying that the criticism has been predictable
[02:02:08.380 --> 02:02:12.340]   and repeatable and it's been the same throughout.
[02:02:12.340 --> 02:02:16.580]   - Yeah, and that's a pretty dismissive thing to say, right?
[02:02:16.580 --> 02:02:19.420]   That I can reduce you to an algorithm
[02:02:19.420 --> 02:02:24.420]   of with 11 permutations.
[02:02:24.420 --> 02:02:27.940]   But the thing to remember, I guess,
[02:02:27.940 --> 02:02:30.740]   is that some of the best funded companies
[02:02:30.740 --> 02:02:31.580]   in the Bitcoin space,
[02:02:31.580 --> 02:02:33.940]   the most powerful miners, billionaires,
[02:02:33.940 --> 02:02:37.380]   have tried to change and co-opt and alter Bitcoin
[02:02:37.380 --> 02:02:41.180]   to shape it to their liking.
[02:02:41.180 --> 02:02:43.380]   And without these incredibly hardcore
[02:02:43.380 --> 02:02:46.340]   sort of high priests of the Bitcoin protocol,
[02:02:46.340 --> 02:02:50.180]   it would have been hopelessly malleated
[02:02:50.180 --> 02:02:51.900]   in all number of ways.
[02:02:51.900 --> 02:02:54.940]   And so there is a reason
[02:02:54.940 --> 02:02:59.020]   why someone would be incredibly protective of Bitcoin.
[02:02:59.020 --> 02:03:05.060]   Does that justify immense toxicity on social media?
[02:03:05.060 --> 02:03:09.740]   Probably not, but it's a leaderless protocol.
[02:03:09.740 --> 02:03:12.580]   So the whole point is that it's money for enemies.
[02:03:12.580 --> 02:03:16.020]   And some of the Bitcoin maximalists came for me too
[02:03:16.020 --> 02:03:18.580]   when I made suggestions that they didn't like.
[02:03:18.580 --> 02:03:21.740]   But I'm happy to use it, the protocol,
[02:03:21.740 --> 02:03:25.940]   because I know that that transaction will be final
[02:03:25.940 --> 02:03:28.860]   regardless of how odious my counterparty is
[02:03:28.860 --> 02:03:33.180]   or how politically disfavored their opinions are.
[02:03:33.180 --> 02:03:36.460]   - See, I mean, and this is where there could be disagreements
[02:03:36.460 --> 02:03:41.460]   but I think you have to think about what's effective
[02:03:41.460 --> 02:03:44.620]   as a defense mechanism of strong ideas.
[02:03:44.620 --> 02:03:49.620]   And I personally think that like kindness and thoughtfulness
[02:03:49.620 --> 02:03:55.860]   and like is much more effective
[02:03:55.860 --> 02:03:58.580]   because it lets the idea shine
[02:03:58.580 --> 02:04:02.660]   as opposed to the personality of the individual humans
[02:04:02.660 --> 02:04:04.300]   overriding it.
[02:04:04.300 --> 02:04:06.180]   But there's debates on this.
[02:04:06.180 --> 02:04:09.620]   - I mean, I take your side on that.
[02:04:09.620 --> 02:04:13.660]   I think a patient and careful approach is the way to go.
[02:04:13.660 --> 02:04:16.980]   Now, do all critics deserve good faith engagement?
[02:04:16.980 --> 02:04:18.260]   No, I would say.
[02:04:18.260 --> 02:04:21.780]   A lot of critics of Bitcoin operate in extreme bad faith.
[02:04:21.780 --> 02:04:24.060]   And the reason why is because
[02:04:24.060 --> 02:04:26.460]   we're not just talking about technical questions.
[02:04:26.460 --> 02:04:28.940]   In fact, most of this conversation has not been technical.
[02:04:28.940 --> 02:04:30.300]   It's been political
[02:04:30.300 --> 02:04:34.220]   because Bitcoin is an intensely political idea.
[02:04:34.220 --> 02:04:38.580]   And so a lot of people are predisposed to totally hate it
[02:04:38.580 --> 02:04:40.820]   and to wish death on Bitcoiners.
[02:04:40.820 --> 02:04:43.340]   I mean, there was a professor at GW
[02:04:43.340 --> 02:04:45.740]   I saw earlier this week that was musing
[02:04:45.740 --> 02:04:48.740]   about getting all the Bitcoiners on a boat and sinking it.
[02:04:48.740 --> 02:04:50.620]   It's like, in what other context
[02:04:50.620 --> 02:04:55.060]   would a upstanding professor muse about mass murder?
[02:04:55.060 --> 02:04:57.620]   But in the context of Bitcoin, it's sort of okay
[02:04:57.620 --> 02:05:03.140]   within his peers because you're talking about something
[02:05:03.140 --> 02:05:04.820]   that most people don't like.
[02:05:04.820 --> 02:05:06.900]   It's a concept that's alien to them
[02:05:06.900 --> 02:05:09.540]   that doesn't jive with the way they see the world.
[02:05:09.540 --> 02:05:14.540]   And so because it's so pitched from a political perspective,
[02:05:14.540 --> 02:05:18.980]   there's a lot of critics as well as defenders
[02:05:18.980 --> 02:05:21.620]   that operate in bad faith, I would say.
[02:05:21.620 --> 02:05:23.060]   But that's the nature of the beast.
[02:05:23.060 --> 02:05:26.340]   It's because we're proposing a very disruptive thing
[02:05:26.340 --> 02:05:28.900]   and there are people that would be disrupted by it.
[02:05:28.900 --> 02:05:32.540]   - You wrote a blog post titled "On Writing."
[02:05:33.540 --> 02:05:36.700]   You're, I think, an excellent writer.
[02:05:36.700 --> 02:05:41.440]   So let me ask, what does it take to be a good writer?
[02:05:41.440 --> 02:05:46.440]   What does it take to write some of the blog posts
[02:05:46.440 --> 02:05:50.380]   you've written, sort of condense a set of ideas
[02:05:50.380 --> 02:05:52.660]   in your head, the mess that's probably in your head
[02:05:52.660 --> 02:05:54.900]   and putting down on paper in a way
[02:05:54.900 --> 02:05:59.900]   that communicates the idea clearly and powerfully?
[02:06:00.780 --> 02:06:03.300]   - So that was basically the point of the blog post
[02:06:03.300 --> 02:06:05.580]   is that being an impressive writer
[02:06:05.580 --> 02:06:08.220]   is different from being an effective writer.
[02:06:08.220 --> 02:06:11.500]   So I think the answer to your question
[02:06:11.500 --> 02:06:13.420]   is humility, basically.
[02:06:13.420 --> 02:06:18.420]   So I think if you let pride and vanity seep
[02:06:18.420 --> 02:06:23.620]   into your writing, then you risk creating
[02:06:23.620 --> 02:06:27.440]   a very noisy signal, creating a very inefficient channel
[02:06:27.440 --> 02:06:30.920]   for communicating literal neural arrangements
[02:06:30.920 --> 02:06:32.880]   from your brain to someone else's brain.
[02:06:32.880 --> 02:06:34.520]   And that's what I think about when I write,
[02:06:34.520 --> 02:06:38.660]   is like, wow, I have the power to, at scale,
[02:06:38.660 --> 02:06:43.080]   change the literal physical composition of people's brains,
[02:06:43.080 --> 02:06:44.360]   to rewire them.
[02:06:44.360 --> 02:06:48.040]   If I make an idea that's so persuasive, that's so sticky,
[02:06:48.040 --> 02:06:51.560]   if I coin a phrase that is so pithy,
[02:06:51.560 --> 02:06:54.440]   then I can alter their brain.
[02:06:54.440 --> 02:06:55.440]   That's crazy.
[02:06:55.440 --> 02:06:57.040]   I mean, you're letting someone reach into your head
[02:06:57.040 --> 02:06:59.120]   and mess with it a little bit.
[02:06:59.120 --> 02:07:01.480]   That's unbelievable.
[02:07:01.480 --> 02:07:02.560]   And that's like a superpower.
[02:07:02.560 --> 02:07:05.460]   And if you could do that to 100,000 people at once,
[02:07:05.460 --> 02:07:07.280]   how powerful is that, right?
[02:07:07.280 --> 02:07:09.720]   - And you mentioned Descartes, "I think, therefore I am."
[02:07:09.720 --> 02:07:12.720]   That's like literally rewired millions of brains
[02:07:12.720 --> 02:07:13.560]   throughout history.
[02:07:13.560 --> 02:07:14.380]   - Right.
[02:07:14.380 --> 02:07:15.480]   I mean, that's one of the most powerful,
[02:07:15.480 --> 02:07:19.600]   like, "Cogito ergo sum," one of the most powerful
[02:07:19.600 --> 02:07:21.400]   phrases ever written.
[02:07:21.400 --> 02:07:24.560]   And that sent a zillion philosophy undergraduates
[02:07:24.560 --> 02:07:26.120]   down a rabbit hole of skepticism
[02:07:26.120 --> 02:07:28.480]   that some of them didn't make it out of.
[02:07:28.480 --> 02:07:31.640]   And they're convinced that the brain in the vat theory
[02:07:31.640 --> 02:07:34.160]   is true and there's no way to know
[02:07:34.160 --> 02:07:37.060]   what our tangible experience is.
[02:07:37.060 --> 02:07:41.220]   But yeah, so that's the beauty of writing.
[02:07:41.220 --> 02:07:45.720]   And the thing that interferes with that is our pride,
[02:07:45.720 --> 02:07:50.180]   our desire to impress people and look good to them
[02:07:50.180 --> 02:07:53.580]   and show off our vocab and stuff.
[02:07:54.440 --> 02:07:57.040]   And that was the point of that piece
[02:07:57.040 --> 02:07:58.360]   is that I went on this journey
[02:07:58.360 --> 02:08:00.640]   where I eventually realized that,
[02:08:00.640 --> 02:08:02.320]   I don't know if I'm any better of a writer
[02:08:02.320 --> 02:08:04.040]   for having realized it,
[02:08:04.040 --> 02:08:06.880]   but I think that is a necessary condition.
[02:08:06.880 --> 02:08:11.880]   - So does that mean there's a value to striving
[02:08:11.880 --> 02:08:16.200]   for simplicity in the words as opposed to,
[02:08:16.200 --> 02:08:18.900]   I mean, complexity?
[02:08:18.900 --> 02:08:21.220]   - I think so, for sure.
[02:08:21.260 --> 02:08:24.660]   And we deal with complex topics all the time in crypto.
[02:08:24.660 --> 02:08:26.880]   And that's always a huge red flag for me.
[02:08:26.880 --> 02:08:28.560]   I mean, if you can't explain something simply,
[02:08:28.560 --> 02:08:29.600]   do you understand it?
[02:08:29.600 --> 02:08:33.660]   So if you're talking about something complex,
[02:08:33.660 --> 02:08:37.420]   if you can't find simple ways to discuss it,
[02:08:37.420 --> 02:08:39.740]   my presumption is that you're actually
[02:08:39.740 --> 02:08:41.700]   obfuscating the truth.
[02:08:41.700 --> 02:08:43.820]   And this is what Orwell railed against
[02:08:43.820 --> 02:08:45.740]   with political language.
[02:08:45.740 --> 02:08:47.620]   He really hated political language
[02:08:47.620 --> 02:08:50.240]   because he felt that its authors
[02:08:50.240 --> 02:08:53.560]   were using deliberate obfuscation.
[02:08:53.560 --> 02:08:55.460]   And he hated euphemisms.
[02:08:55.460 --> 02:08:57.020]   And I hate euphemisms too.
[02:08:57.020 --> 02:09:02.860]   I much prefer forthrightness and clarity of thought.
[02:09:02.860 --> 02:09:05.020]   But most people when they write,
[02:09:05.020 --> 02:09:08.840]   don't really endeavor to be particularly clear.
[02:09:08.840 --> 02:09:12.320]   They might be writing to show off their startup
[02:09:12.320 --> 02:09:16.300]   or to demonstrate to people how cool they are
[02:09:16.300 --> 02:09:19.940]   or how well read they are.
[02:09:19.940 --> 02:09:23.240]   They're displaying, it's like a peacock style display.
[02:09:23.240 --> 02:09:25.680]   What fraction of people write
[02:09:25.680 --> 02:09:27.860]   to actually communicate meaning?
[02:09:27.860 --> 02:09:29.540]   Small fraction.
[02:09:29.540 --> 02:09:32.900]   - It's especially difficult because what I've detected
[02:09:32.900 --> 02:09:37.280]   is something in us humans as readers
[02:09:37.280 --> 02:09:40.440]   assign more credibility to people that obfuscate.
[02:09:40.440 --> 02:09:46.360]   So like simple, clear communication of an idea
[02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:51.120]   is not like the immediate reaction
[02:09:51.120 --> 02:09:55.720]   is not one where we assign credibility to the person.
[02:09:55.720 --> 02:09:59.640]   Like that was brilliant.
[02:09:59.640 --> 02:10:02.440]   There's a lot of people that I kind of listened to
[02:10:02.440 --> 02:10:03.600]   without really understanding
[02:10:03.600 --> 02:10:06.040]   what the heck they're talking about.
[02:10:06.040 --> 02:10:08.240]   But it sounds musical and smart.
[02:10:08.240 --> 02:10:12.040]   And then I see a lot of folks assigning credibility
[02:10:12.040 --> 02:10:13.740]   to that person.
[02:10:13.740 --> 02:10:16.480]   And it's unfortunate.
[02:10:17.880 --> 02:10:20.640]   It's unfortunate that there's that tension as a reader
[02:10:20.640 --> 02:10:23.880]   that we appreciate the beauty and power
[02:10:23.880 --> 02:10:28.880]   of like complex weaving of words
[02:10:28.880 --> 02:10:33.880]   without assigning as much value
[02:10:33.880 --> 02:10:36.640]   to like actual clear communication of an idea.
[02:10:36.640 --> 02:10:40.080]   - And I'm always skeptical in speech as well.
[02:10:40.080 --> 02:10:43.160]   When someone will describe someone as articulate,
[02:10:43.160 --> 02:10:45.480]   I'm always immediately skeptical
[02:10:45.480 --> 02:10:48.680]   of the value of what that person is saying.
[02:10:48.680 --> 02:10:50.600]   Because if you articulate,
[02:10:50.600 --> 02:10:53.620]   you can make bad ideas sound very acceptable and great.
[02:10:53.620 --> 02:10:57.600]   - Noam Chomsky has said this before.
[02:10:57.600 --> 02:11:01.800]   As a way to defend the way he speaks,
[02:11:01.800 --> 02:11:05.480]   he said that like he's suspicious of charismatic people
[02:11:05.480 --> 02:11:08.040]   because they can basically sell any kind of idea.
[02:11:08.040 --> 02:11:10.980]   He speaks in a very monotone and boring way
[02:11:10.980 --> 02:11:13.440]   so that whatever the value his ideas have,
[02:11:13.440 --> 02:11:14.980]   it'll shine through.
[02:11:14.980 --> 02:11:17.160]   There's something to that.
[02:11:17.160 --> 02:11:18.480]   There's something to that. - I love that.
[02:11:18.480 --> 02:11:19.880]   - But it's a difficult journey.
[02:11:19.880 --> 02:11:21.720]   It's a difficult path because then,
[02:11:21.720 --> 02:11:23.080]   I think it's the right path
[02:11:23.080 --> 02:11:25.840]   because ultimately you focus on the quality of your ideas.
[02:11:25.840 --> 02:11:27.600]   And in the long term, that wins.
[02:11:27.600 --> 02:11:29.320]   - I agree.
[02:11:29.320 --> 02:11:32.400]   - Just by way of advice,
[02:11:32.400 --> 02:11:34.640]   is there, if people are interested in Bitcoin
[02:11:34.640 --> 02:11:37.040]   or cryptocurrency in your work,
[02:11:37.040 --> 02:11:40.200]   what are good books or resources on Bitcoin
[02:11:41.160 --> 02:11:43.560]   from you and from others that you can recommend
[02:11:43.560 --> 02:11:45.480]   that were in your own journey helped you
[02:11:45.480 --> 02:11:47.880]   or you've seen help others?
[02:11:47.880 --> 02:11:50.280]   - Well, it's very easy,
[02:11:50.280 --> 02:11:53.520]   or it's much easier today to make the Bitcoin journey
[02:11:53.520 --> 02:11:55.440]   because the quality of content is so much better
[02:11:55.440 --> 02:11:56.660]   than it was when I started.
[02:11:56.660 --> 02:11:59.440]   I mean, when I learned about Bitcoin,
[02:11:59.440 --> 02:12:02.760]   there was the Bitcoin Wiki and the Bitcoin Stack Exchange
[02:12:02.760 --> 02:12:05.560]   and the subreddit and that was kind of it.
[02:12:05.560 --> 02:12:08.220]   And you had to just pick up everything.
[02:12:08.220 --> 02:12:10.440]   The economic theory hadn't really been worked out
[02:12:10.440 --> 02:12:13.720]   very much, so you had to pick everything up from scratch.
[02:12:13.720 --> 02:12:17.160]   The good news is that there's a huge abundance of content
[02:12:17.160 --> 02:12:19.780]   and that's actually one of Bitcoin's greatest strengths
[02:12:19.780 --> 02:12:22.560]   is that people are totally inspired to write about it.
[02:12:22.560 --> 02:12:25.480]   And it's almost a rite of passage at this point
[02:12:25.480 --> 02:12:29.560]   if you're like a Bitcoin thinker to have your book.
[02:12:29.560 --> 02:12:30.460]   I don't have a book yet.
[02:12:30.460 --> 02:12:31.880]   I would love to recommend my book.
[02:12:31.880 --> 02:12:33.120]   I haven't written one.
[02:12:33.120 --> 02:12:34.600]   - Do you think about writing a book?
[02:12:34.600 --> 02:12:37.480]   - Yeah, I think it's my duty, 100%.
[02:12:37.480 --> 02:12:40.200]   Everyone that has created a lot of Bitcoin content
[02:12:40.200 --> 02:12:42.440]   probably should condense it into a book
[02:12:42.440 --> 02:12:45.360]   to give it an enduring status.
[02:12:45.360 --> 02:12:49.320]   - It's interesting 'cause you mentioned Block Size Wars
[02:12:49.320 --> 02:12:52.360]   and you've written on a lot of different topics.
[02:12:52.360 --> 02:12:56.960]   So you could both write a big,
[02:12:56.960 --> 02:13:01.960]   like sapien style book about Bitcoin or cryptocurrency, right?
[02:13:01.960 --> 02:13:05.120]   But you can also write a book on each,
[02:13:05.120 --> 02:13:08.040]   like a specific thing.
[02:13:08.040 --> 02:13:10.000]   And now that you put pressure on yourself
[02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:13.100]   and talk about simplicity, right?
[02:13:13.100 --> 02:13:16.000]   Where do you lean on those different book journeys
[02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:17.840]   that you might take on?
[02:13:17.840 --> 02:13:22.840]   Do you have in you eventually like a Bitcoin book?
[02:13:22.840 --> 02:13:25.680]   - I mean, I tallied up the words that I wrote
[02:13:25.680 --> 02:13:27.200]   in the last couple of years on Bitcoin.
[02:13:27.200 --> 02:13:29.820]   It's like over 100,000 words a year.
[02:13:29.820 --> 02:13:32.920]   So that's two novels there.
[02:13:32.920 --> 02:13:35.400]   But yeah, I think I do.
[02:13:35.400 --> 02:13:39.200]   I think there's so much underexplored space in Bitcoin.
[02:13:39.200 --> 02:13:41.960]   I mean, a systematic interpretation
[02:13:41.960 --> 02:13:44.400]   of Satoshi's writings, for instance.
[02:13:44.400 --> 02:13:46.880]   And a lot of people don't want anyone to do that
[02:13:46.880 --> 02:13:49.160]   because they don't want it to have these religious overtones
[02:13:49.160 --> 02:13:52.160]   where you're engaging in interpretation,
[02:13:52.160 --> 02:13:56.800]   but that's something that should be done.
[02:13:56.800 --> 02:13:58.200]   There's a lot of Bitcoin histories
[02:13:58.200 --> 02:14:00.240]   that haven't been written.
[02:14:00.240 --> 02:14:03.080]   There was a great Bitcoin history recently published.
[02:14:03.080 --> 02:14:07.160]   This is one of my recommendations is "On the Block Size War"
[02:14:07.160 --> 02:14:09.480]   by Jonathan Beer,
[02:14:09.480 --> 02:14:12.320]   who runs probably the best research desk in the industry.
[02:14:12.320 --> 02:14:18.200]   So there's huge amounts of history that has transpired
[02:14:18.200 --> 02:14:20.240]   that hasn't been chronicled.
[02:14:20.240 --> 02:14:23.640]   And some of the accounts are indifferent.
[02:14:23.640 --> 02:14:25.640]   They're often written by outsiders,
[02:14:25.640 --> 02:14:29.720]   journalists that maybe don't fully engage
[02:14:29.720 --> 02:14:31.880]   with the Bitcoin system.
[02:14:31.880 --> 02:14:35.040]   - Do you think the humans are interesting in the story too?
[02:14:35.040 --> 02:14:38.120]   - Of course, they're the most interesting thing.
[02:14:38.120 --> 02:14:40.320]   Bitcoin itself doesn't really change that much.
[02:14:40.320 --> 02:14:44.120]   It's kind of this cold protocol that just sort of
[02:14:44.120 --> 02:14:47.080]   takes along, but the characters are just fascinating.
[02:14:47.080 --> 02:14:49.720]   I mean, and there's so many unbelievable characters
[02:14:49.720 --> 02:14:51.720]   in the Bitcoin story, unbelievable.
[02:14:51.720 --> 02:14:54.760]   - Yeah, that's the cool thing about Bitcoin
[02:14:54.760 --> 02:14:59.000]   and cryptocurrency and just internet is the weirdos,
[02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:00.480]   the brilliant weirdos.
[02:15:01.480 --> 02:15:05.200]   All the people in the stuff that's already established
[02:15:05.200 --> 02:15:09.240]   are boring, like economics professors are all boring.
[02:15:09.240 --> 02:15:11.760]   But the interesting people, the wild ones
[02:15:11.760 --> 02:15:15.360]   are the ones that are innovating in the crypto space,
[02:15:15.360 --> 02:15:19.760]   which is, that's where the dangerous weirdos are
[02:15:19.760 --> 02:15:21.960]   and the exciting, brilliant weirdos.
[02:15:21.960 --> 02:15:24.840]   - Well, you had to be kind of crazy to adopt Bitcoin
[02:15:24.840 --> 02:15:27.000]   in the first sort of five years of its life.
[02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:30.800]   So there's an adverse selection element there.
[02:15:30.800 --> 02:15:32.840]   I don't know if that's an uncharitable way to put it,
[02:15:32.840 --> 02:15:36.960]   but like some of Bitcoin's earliest evangelists
[02:15:36.960 --> 02:15:39.720]   are not the evangelists I would have chosen,
[02:15:39.720 --> 02:15:41.480]   but they were the ones that we got.
[02:15:41.480 --> 02:15:45.280]   - It's the one we got, but is there resources?
[02:15:45.280 --> 02:15:48.560]   You're basically saying just throw a dart
[02:15:48.560 --> 02:15:51.280]   and most books are going to be good,
[02:15:51.280 --> 02:15:52.800]   or is there something that stands out to you?
[02:15:52.800 --> 02:15:55.520]   - I mean, your average book is terrible for sure,
[02:15:55.520 --> 02:15:59.200]   but not on Bitcoin specifically, but just in general.
[02:16:00.160 --> 02:16:02.520]   It depends whether you like the computer science,
[02:16:02.520 --> 02:16:04.960]   the economics, or the history,
[02:16:04.960 --> 02:16:07.160]   but my recommendations would be,
[02:16:07.160 --> 02:16:10.560]   obviously the Bitcoin white paper,
[02:16:10.560 --> 02:16:13.600]   and Satoshi's complimentary writings,
[02:16:13.600 --> 02:16:15.760]   that's very important, is to try and understand
[02:16:15.760 --> 02:16:17.920]   the intentions behind the system.
[02:16:17.920 --> 02:16:19.720]   And also to understand the system
[02:16:19.720 --> 02:16:21.880]   without having your view colored
[02:16:21.880 --> 02:16:24.600]   by some third party's description of it.
[02:16:24.600 --> 02:16:26.800]   Most descriptions of Bitcoin are really bad.
[02:16:26.800 --> 02:16:29.240]   So just go to the originals,
[02:16:29.240 --> 02:16:31.520]   go to the Hal Finney's posts,
[02:16:31.520 --> 02:16:33.400]   Satoshi's posts on Bitcoin talk,
[02:16:33.400 --> 02:16:35.240]   there's a huge amount of lucidity there.
[02:16:35.240 --> 02:16:38.880]   And actually most of our questions about Bitcoin today
[02:16:38.880 --> 02:16:40.040]   that we have a decade later,
[02:16:40.040 --> 02:16:42.520]   were really answered in those earliest days.
[02:16:42.520 --> 02:16:44.440]   People just don't know it.
[02:16:44.440 --> 02:16:49.440]   The canonical economic work relating to Bitcoin,
[02:16:49.440 --> 02:16:51.120]   a lot of people don't like it.
[02:16:51.120 --> 02:16:54.000]   I think it's fine, would be the Bitcoin standard.
[02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:55.920]   - A lot of people don't like it.
[02:16:55.920 --> 02:16:57.080]   I just read it, it's good.
[02:16:57.080 --> 02:16:57.920]   I like it.
[02:16:57.920 --> 02:17:00.480]   - I think it's a good description
[02:17:00.480 --> 02:17:02.240]   of sort of the Austrian perspective,
[02:17:02.240 --> 02:17:04.440]   and then how it relates to Bitcoin.
[02:17:04.440 --> 02:17:06.160]   There isn't that much about Bitcoin in there,
[02:17:06.160 --> 02:17:07.480]   but I think the point is,
[02:17:07.480 --> 02:17:09.440]   once you've understood, you know,
[02:17:09.440 --> 02:17:12.160]   Seyfriedin's view of monetary policy,
[02:17:12.160 --> 02:17:13.400]   Bitcoin makes a ton of sense,
[02:17:13.400 --> 02:17:16.040]   so you don't actually need to argue for it that much.
[02:17:16.040 --> 02:17:19.520]   So the Bitcoin standard is a good introduction
[02:17:19.520 --> 02:17:22.160]   to sort of the orthodox thought in Bitcoin.
[02:17:22.160 --> 02:17:26.640]   There's a more recent book called "Layered Money",
[02:17:26.640 --> 02:17:29.760]   which I liked by Nick Batia,
[02:17:29.760 --> 02:17:31.800]   which goes into more depth
[02:17:31.800 --> 02:17:33.760]   about what I was talking about earlier in the conversation,
[02:17:33.760 --> 02:17:35.920]   the layered approach to scaling.
[02:17:35.920 --> 02:17:38.680]   And that's a really critical thing to understand.
[02:17:38.680 --> 02:17:41.120]   Then technical books about Bitcoin.
[02:17:41.120 --> 02:17:42.880]   I like "Grokking Bitcoin",
[02:17:42.880 --> 02:17:46.880]   which is a very computer science heavy one.
[02:17:46.880 --> 02:17:49.920]   There's a good textbook called
[02:17:49.920 --> 02:17:53.120]   "Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies"
[02:17:53.120 --> 02:17:56.160]   by Arvind Narayan.
[02:17:56.160 --> 02:18:00.680]   I think he's a Princeton computer science professor,
[02:18:00.680 --> 02:18:02.840]   which is really good at building intuition.
[02:18:02.840 --> 02:18:08.160]   Antonopoulos' books, "Mastering Bitcoin", are good.
[02:18:08.160 --> 02:18:11.440]   Then there's like simpler intuition building books
[02:18:11.440 --> 02:18:13.000]   that aren't hardcore on the economics
[02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:14.840]   or the protocol design.
[02:18:14.840 --> 02:18:17.680]   So you have like "Inventing Bitcoin" by Jan Pritzker,
[02:18:17.680 --> 02:18:18.520]   which is good.
[02:18:18.520 --> 02:18:21.280]   You have "Bitcoin Clarity" by Kjaer Bakkers.
[02:18:21.280 --> 02:18:22.520]   As you can tell, I have like,
[02:18:22.520 --> 02:18:25.640]   my bookshelf is like mostly Bitcoin books.
[02:18:25.640 --> 02:18:26.880]   - Okay, well that's a good selection.
[02:18:26.880 --> 02:18:28.440]   And of course, like you said,
[02:18:28.440 --> 02:18:30.360]   your writing and your book,
[02:18:30.360 --> 02:18:33.920]   that comes out this year or next year?
[02:18:33.920 --> 02:18:34.760]   Next year?
[02:18:34.760 --> 02:18:36.640]   - I think I'm gonna need 18 months.
[02:18:36.640 --> 02:18:39.800]   But most of the good Bitcoin content
[02:18:39.800 --> 02:18:42.840]   is just online, on Medium, on Twitter.
[02:18:42.840 --> 02:18:49.000]   It's a decentralized consensus kind of thing.
[02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:53.320]   - What about book recommendations that you could give
[02:18:53.320 --> 02:18:56.720]   people who love these outside of the world of crypto
[02:18:56.720 --> 02:18:58.720]   that maybe had an impact on your life?
[02:18:58.720 --> 02:19:03.160]   Fiction, like sci-fi, maybe technical, philosophical.
[02:19:03.160 --> 02:19:04.480]   Is there something you would recommend
[02:19:04.480 --> 02:19:06.080]   that people might read?
[02:19:06.080 --> 02:19:08.080]   - I really liked "The Three-Body Problem",
[02:19:08.080 --> 02:19:11.280]   but that's a really hackneyed recommendation.
[02:19:11.280 --> 02:19:12.400]   But it really made me think.
[02:19:12.400 --> 02:19:14.400]   And I like the hard sci-fi,
[02:19:14.400 --> 02:19:17.960]   you know, the commitment to science and science fiction.
[02:19:17.960 --> 02:19:19.600]   So I thought it was very clever.
[02:19:19.600 --> 02:19:23.040]   - Is there one, is there something that really annoys you
[02:19:23.040 --> 02:19:25.280]   in terms of the opposite of hard sci-fi,
[02:19:25.280 --> 02:19:27.840]   like that doesn't get stuff right, movies?
[02:19:27.840 --> 02:19:34.880]   - I mean, I have issues when I watch ostensibly sci-fi
[02:19:34.880 --> 02:19:38.680]   or fantasy films that are not consistent about the rules
[02:19:38.680 --> 02:19:41.480]   for the universe that they've laid out,
[02:19:41.480 --> 02:19:43.640]   or where they're just impossible to comprehend,
[02:19:43.640 --> 02:19:47.920]   like Christopher Nolan's latest film.
[02:19:47.920 --> 02:19:48.760]   - Oh yeah.
[02:19:48.760 --> 02:19:50.520]   - You needed a spreadsheet to understand that.
[02:19:50.520 --> 02:19:51.360]   - "Tenet".
[02:19:51.360 --> 02:19:52.200]   - "Tenet", yeah.
[02:19:52.200 --> 02:19:54.080]   - I didn't trust that maybe he was consistent
[02:19:54.080 --> 02:19:55.320]   about the rules of his universe.
[02:19:55.320 --> 02:19:58.360]   I just did not understand it at all.
[02:19:58.360 --> 02:20:01.200]   - In that sense, I really, probably one of my favorites
[02:20:01.200 --> 02:20:03.440]   is "2001 Space Odyssey".
[02:20:03.440 --> 02:20:08.120]   It's so, obviously it's many, many decades ago,
[02:20:08.120 --> 02:20:13.120]   but it's quite brilliant in both its consistency
[02:20:13.120 --> 02:20:19.040]   and the depth of thought put into like
[02:20:19.040 --> 02:20:20.960]   what the technology would actually be.
[02:20:21.800 --> 02:20:26.800]   Not in like visually, not in kind of silly graphical ways,
[02:20:26.800 --> 02:20:34.040]   but in terms of function and its impact on humanity.
[02:20:34.040 --> 02:20:40.880]   So, but that takes care, that takes a lot of work.
[02:20:40.880 --> 02:20:42.280]   And that takes genius actually,
[02:20:42.280 --> 02:20:46.420]   which is why Kubrick is regarded for what he is.
[02:20:48.400 --> 02:20:51.280]   - What advice, you've taken an interesting journey
[02:20:51.280 --> 02:20:52.280]   through your life.
[02:20:52.280 --> 02:20:56.360]   You were at Fidelity, a philosophy major.
[02:20:56.360 --> 02:21:00.760]   You're now one of the seminal minds
[02:21:00.760 --> 02:21:03.880]   in the world of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency.
[02:21:03.880 --> 02:21:05.800]   Who the hell knows what the next five,
[02:21:05.800 --> 02:21:06.960]   10 years looks for you?
[02:21:06.960 --> 02:21:12.140]   If you were to give advice to somebody young today,
[02:21:12.140 --> 02:21:16.200]   you know, making their way through life, making a career,
[02:21:16.200 --> 02:21:18.800]   what would you, what kind of advice would you give?
[02:21:18.800 --> 02:21:23.540]   - See, the problem with advice is that in a world
[02:21:23.540 --> 02:21:26.380]   where so much of success is defined by luck
[02:21:26.380 --> 02:21:30.100]   and serendipity is that the advice givers
[02:21:30.100 --> 02:21:33.500]   often don't know why they've been successful, right?
[02:21:33.500 --> 02:21:35.500]   And so they might say, you know,
[02:21:35.500 --> 02:21:38.640]   I was wearing a green tie on the day of my job interview
[02:21:38.640 --> 02:21:41.460]   and so you should go out and wear green ties.
[02:21:41.460 --> 02:21:43.360]   And so they might just get the causality
[02:21:43.360 --> 02:21:45.600]   completely wrong, right?
[02:21:45.600 --> 02:21:47.080]   I mean, I'm not gonna claim
[02:21:47.080 --> 02:21:49.620]   that I'm super successful yet,
[02:21:49.620 --> 02:21:53.860]   but see, that's the problem is that I don't think
[02:21:53.860 --> 02:21:55.800]   my journey is replicable necessarily.
[02:21:55.800 --> 02:21:59.760]   So, you know, who am I to give advice?
[02:21:59.760 --> 02:22:01.760]   Although the one thing I will say is that
[02:22:01.760 --> 02:22:07.360]   the thing I did right was to become completely obsessed
[02:22:07.360 --> 02:22:12.360]   with a domain I found really interesting and held promise.
[02:22:12.360 --> 02:22:14.360]   Like if I had been really interested
[02:22:14.360 --> 02:22:15.760]   in like "Magic the Gathering",
[02:22:15.760 --> 02:22:18.560]   I wouldn't have been able to like do much with that
[02:22:18.560 --> 02:22:20.520]   aside from build like a killer, you know,
[02:22:20.520 --> 02:22:21.800]   card pack or whatever.
[02:22:21.800 --> 02:22:27.440]   And I wasn't afraid to, you know,
[02:22:27.440 --> 02:22:30.960]   really put myself out there and, you know,
[02:22:30.960 --> 02:22:33.560]   float my thoughts online and see how people reacted to them.
[02:22:33.560 --> 02:22:36.280]   Even if I said stuff that was completely erroneous
[02:22:36.280 --> 02:22:39.600]   or wrong all the time, the rewards to writing
[02:22:39.600 --> 02:22:41.920]   and just publishing content are immense,
[02:22:41.920 --> 02:22:43.600]   as you know, obviously.
[02:22:43.600 --> 02:22:45.700]   It's the most high leverage activity
[02:22:45.700 --> 02:22:48.200]   I think most young people have available to them.
[02:22:48.200 --> 02:22:53.800]   And I was very lucky and I benefited from a lot
[02:22:53.800 --> 02:22:57.040]   of favorable coincidences, a lot of people
[02:22:57.040 --> 02:22:58.800]   that took a chance on me.
[02:22:58.800 --> 02:23:02.700]   And if I had more time, I would sit here and name them.
[02:23:02.700 --> 02:23:06.340]   - Is there something you in your actions
[02:23:06.340 --> 02:23:11.220]   that made you more open to the benefits of luck?
[02:23:12.460 --> 02:23:14.960]   Sort of, you know, luck can bring you a lot
[02:23:14.960 --> 02:23:16.780]   of positive and negative things.
[02:23:16.780 --> 02:23:19.480]   So saying you're lucky means you are able
[02:23:19.480 --> 02:23:21.840]   to ride the wave of whatever positive stuff
[02:23:21.840 --> 02:23:23.140]   luck can bring and brought you.
[02:23:23.140 --> 02:23:23.980]   - Well, that's right.
[02:23:23.980 --> 02:23:26.600]   You have to put yourself in a position to be lucky
[02:23:26.600 --> 02:23:27.960]   and most people don't.
[02:23:27.960 --> 02:23:30.860]   So you just have to get as many shots on goal as possible.
[02:23:30.860 --> 02:23:35.360]   And of course luck plays an undeniable role
[02:23:35.360 --> 02:23:37.840]   in any career path, for sure.
[02:23:37.840 --> 02:23:41.920]   But you do have to make yourself available to it.
[02:23:42.820 --> 02:23:45.620]   And you have to take a ton of chances.
[02:23:45.620 --> 02:23:50.400]   But yeah, that's the problem with advice.
[02:23:50.400 --> 02:23:52.500]   It's just so hard to replicate it.
[02:23:52.500 --> 02:23:54.900]   So I find it illegitimate most of the time.
[02:23:54.900 --> 02:23:59.260]   - You heard it here, kids.
[02:23:59.260 --> 02:24:01.660]   Don't listen to anything Nick just said.
[02:24:01.660 --> 02:24:02.500]   - Exactly.
[02:24:02.500 --> 02:24:04.380]   - Wear a green tie to your interviews.
[02:24:04.380 --> 02:24:06.200]   It'll work out well.
[02:24:06.200 --> 02:24:08.740]   Do you think there's a meaning or reason
[02:24:08.740 --> 02:24:12.120]   to any of this, this existence, this life?
[02:24:12.120 --> 02:24:15.320]   - Well, we make our own meaning, for sure.
[02:24:15.320 --> 02:24:17.620]   I find a huge amount of meaning in what I do.
[02:24:17.620 --> 02:24:21.080]   I find it beautiful.
[02:24:21.080 --> 02:24:24.920]   I feel very lucky and blessed to be in the line of work
[02:24:24.920 --> 02:24:25.760]   that I'm in.
[02:24:25.760 --> 02:24:29.040]   To have your hobby and your passion and your job
[02:24:29.040 --> 02:24:30.940]   just be a completely integrated thing.
[02:24:30.940 --> 02:24:34.160]   So that's where I find meaning.
[02:24:34.160 --> 02:24:38.240]   - But you're just a bag of cells and bacteria
[02:24:38.240 --> 02:24:42.540]   that eventually dissipates, dies,
[02:24:42.540 --> 02:24:46.020]   and it goes into the ground and disappears
[02:24:46.020 --> 02:24:48.080]   back into the universe.
[02:24:48.080 --> 02:24:50.260]   I mean, that doesn't make any sense.
[02:24:50.260 --> 02:24:51.300]   - Well, that may be true,
[02:24:51.300 --> 02:24:55.360]   but I find the sublime in things like Bitcoin.
[02:24:55.360 --> 02:24:57.940]   I find it incredibly inspiring to work on it.
[02:24:57.940 --> 02:25:01.180]   I believe it's a hundred year plus project.
[02:25:01.180 --> 02:25:06.180]   And it stirs those aesthetic emotions in you,
[02:25:06.180 --> 02:25:07.820]   as I'm sure your work does.
[02:25:07.820 --> 02:25:09.480]   - So you find it beautiful.
[02:25:09.480 --> 02:25:11.480]   - Absolutely, absolutely.
[02:25:11.480 --> 02:25:14.080]   And inspiring more than just beautiful.
[02:25:14.080 --> 02:25:16.120]   - So you have hope for human civilization
[02:25:16.120 --> 02:25:18.080]   and Bitcoin is part of that hope?
[02:25:18.080 --> 02:25:19.920]   - Yeah, it's a very optimistic view.
[02:25:19.920 --> 02:25:22.520]   And people accuse us of being pessimists
[02:25:22.520 --> 02:25:24.120]   and saying that we are rooting
[02:25:24.120 --> 02:25:25.760]   for the collapse of civilization.
[02:25:25.760 --> 02:25:26.940]   Completely false.
[02:25:26.940 --> 02:25:31.840]   Bitcoiners are wildly optimistic
[02:25:31.840 --> 02:25:33.400]   because they believe that you can monetize
[02:25:33.400 --> 02:25:35.680]   a completely new system from scratch
[02:25:35.680 --> 02:25:38.440]   and compete with the strongest superpower
[02:25:38.440 --> 02:25:39.760]   in the military and the dollar
[02:25:39.760 --> 02:25:42.480]   and everything that goes with that.
[02:25:42.480 --> 02:25:45.340]   That's the craziest, most ludicrously optimistic
[02:25:45.340 --> 02:25:46.900]   proposition imaginable.
[02:25:46.900 --> 02:25:49.840]   So I think Bitcoiners are the most
[02:25:49.840 --> 02:25:51.440]   optimistic people out there.
[02:25:51.440 --> 02:25:55.000]   - I don't think there's a better way to end it
[02:25:55.000 --> 02:26:00.000]   on that hopeful vision of human civilization, Nick.
[02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:02.480]   I've heard a lot of amazing things about you.
[02:26:02.480 --> 02:26:06.640]   I was binge watching your interviews,
[02:26:06.640 --> 02:26:11.400]   binge reading your blogs, fell in love with your work.
[02:26:11.400 --> 02:26:14.640]   You're a good dude, inspiring, brilliant.
[02:26:14.640 --> 02:26:16.480]   Thank you so much for wasting all
[02:26:16.480 --> 02:26:18.520]   your valuable time with me today.
[02:26:18.520 --> 02:26:19.840]   - My absolute pleasure.
[02:26:19.840 --> 02:26:22.360]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[02:26:22.360 --> 02:26:26.000]   with Nick Carter and thank you to the information,
[02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:29.520]   Athletic Greens, Four Sigmatic and Blinkist.
[02:26:29.520 --> 02:26:31.080]   Check them out in the description
[02:26:31.080 --> 02:26:33.080]   to support this podcast.
[02:26:33.080 --> 02:26:35.160]   And now let me leave you with some words
[02:26:35.160 --> 02:26:38.760]   about freedom and beauty from Stephen King.
[02:26:38.760 --> 02:26:42.240]   Some birds are not meant to be caged, that's all.
[02:26:42.240 --> 02:26:44.100]   Their feathers are too bright,
[02:26:44.100 --> 02:26:46.800]   their songs too sweet and wild.
[02:26:46.800 --> 02:26:49.320]   So you let them go, and when you open the cage
[02:26:49.320 --> 02:26:52.240]   to feed them, they somehow fly out past you.
[02:26:52.240 --> 02:26:54.000]   And the part of you that knows it was wrong
[02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:56.680]   to imprison them in the first place rejoices.
[02:26:56.680 --> 02:26:59.040]   But still, the place where you live
[02:26:59.040 --> 02:27:02.320]   is that much more drab and empty for their departure.
[02:27:02.320 --> 02:27:05.960]   Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
[02:27:05.960 --> 02:27:08.540]   (upbeat music)
[02:27:08.540 --> 02:27:11.120]   (upbeat music)
[02:27:11.120 --> 02:27:21.120]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
