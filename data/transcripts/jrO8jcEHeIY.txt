[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.480]   We have to decide what should be open and a public good, not from a business perspective
[00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.880]   or societal perspective, versus what should be closed.
[00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.280]   Should the tools to allow anyone to be creative, anyone to be educated, and other things like
[00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.360]   that be run by private companies?
[00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.800]   Probably not.

[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.820]   companies in the AI space right now.
[00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.920]   This is a super fun interview and I hope you enjoy it.
[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.060]   All right, do you mind if I just go rapid fire questions?
[00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:34.060]   Yeah, sure.
[00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:35.060]   Go for it.
