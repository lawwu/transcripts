[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.720]   if I took the village idiot and I asked him to create the theory of quantum computing,
[00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:09.040]   should I anticipate that if he wanted to, he could do this? And just for frame of reference,
[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:14.480]   about 21 to 24% of Americans, they can't even perform basic tasks like identifying the expiry
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.760]   date of a driver's license, for example. And if they're not capable of doing this,
[00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.720]   doesn't that mean that the theory of universal explainers falls apart?
[00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:27.280]   So these tasks that you're talking about are tasks that no ape could do. However, there are humans
[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:32.080]   who are brain damaged to the extent that they can't even do the tasks that an ape can do.
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:38.960]   And there comes a point when installing the program that would, you know, be able to read
[00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.640]   a driver's license or whatever, would require augmenting their hardware as well as their
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.480]   software. If it's 24% of the population, then it's definitely not hardware. If it's software,
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:57.200]   it is not just a matter of them wanting to, it is a matter of whether the existing software
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.680]   is conceptually ready to do that.
