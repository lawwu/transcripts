[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.400]   Would you like to be given more free stuff by others?
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:39.400]   Well today on Radical Personal Finance I'm going to share with you how that can happen
[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.480]   for you.
[00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.480]   And the answer is elegantly simple.
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:54.880]   If you would like to be given more free stuff by others, then you should become known as
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:01.880]   someone who is a good receiver of free things.
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.480]   You need to become known as someone who can be given things, develop a reputation as somebody
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:11.520]   who values the things that others might give you.
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.800]   You say Joshua what difference does that make?
[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.920]   It makes all the difference in the world.
[00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.360]   What I've learned is if you will develop a reputation as somebody who appreciates the
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:29.600]   good gifts that others give you, then people with good gifts to give will enjoy giving
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.840]   them to you.
[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:33.960]   I didn't always feel this way.
[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.080]   When I was younger I had a significant self-image problem.
[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.400]   I lacked confidence in who I was and in the type of person that I was.
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.520]   I always wanted to appear to be rich.
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.080]   I was the kind of person who wanted to not look like I was in need.
[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.280]   And so I would have been the kind of person who would have not wanted to receive things
[00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.360]   for free.
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:02.440]   I was reminded of this a year or two ago in some personal interaction with somebody that
[00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:03.440]   I know.
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.080]   And this person is very broke constantly.
[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.560]   Throughout this person's entire lifetime they have always been broke.
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.320]   They are very poor at managing money.
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:21.080]   And when I say broke I mean seriously, seriously broke.
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.720]   Always.
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.440]   And what was interesting is I watched this person on multiple occasions over the course
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:38.920]   of a few weeks be offered gifts by other people that to me seemed like great gifts.
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.720]   Much of it was food and this person didn't have money for food, but yet they were offered
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.520]   gifts by other people.
[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:54.840]   But because this person has so much pride about their money, and hint, hint, broke people
[00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.200]   are usually the most sensitive and proud about their money.
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.720]   Because this person has so much pride about their money I watched them systematically
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.360]   turn down these good gifts, these offers of good food and good things.
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:14.240]   I myself have tried to give this person good things and basically I've given up because
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:21.040]   I've realized they just aren't going to be a good receiver of things.
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.880]   On some of those occasions when I observed somebody offering this person good gifts of
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.220]   food, and I'm not talking about food that they pulled from a dumpster, good quality
[00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.120]   food that was being given away for free, I myself opened my mouth and said, "Well, I'll
[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.000]   take it."
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:43.840]   Now what's funny is I have about a bazillion times more money than this broke person has.
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:49.280]   Yes, bazillion is a technical financial planning term that means lots, about a bazillion times
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.360]   more money.
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:59.520]   And yet here I am going ahead and taking the free things that they were being offered.
[00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.760]   But I've learned that if you'll develop a reputation as being somebody who is a good
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:10.880]   receiver of gifts and who appreciates it, then people will give you lots of stuff.
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.000]   And it'll be good stuff too, that's a real blessing to you.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.960]   I'm not going to turn down free food when somebody wants to give me free food.
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:20.120]   What a blessing.
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.360]   What a blessing to my family, what a blessing to my budget.
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:28.800]   It allows me to save money, money may be used to grow my wealth, that it gives me the opportunity
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.160]   to bless someone else, gives me the opportunity to invite someone in for a good meal with
[00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.520]   food that I didn't have to pay for.
[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.080]   What a blessing.
[00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:45.640]   And yet I've watched again and again as this broke person gets offered fewer and fewer
[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:51.040]   good things because they're not a good receiver of things.
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:56.480]   I think most of us want to see the things that we have and that we're done with go to
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.960]   a good home.
[00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.880]   That's why when we're done with certain clothes or certain items and possessions that are
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.800]   no longer useful for us, most of us would prefer to take them down to a thrift store
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.000]   and make a donation to the local charity store rather than to toss them in the garbage.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.080]   And I think that's proper.
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:20.280]   If we had the opportunity to give away food, for example, that was perfectly edible, most
[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:25.000]   of us would rather see that food go to good use instead of it being poured down the garbage.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.320]   Now whether that good use is to go into your dog's stomach or whether it's to go into your
[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.320]   neighbor's stomach, that would depend, of course, on the quality of the food.
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.080]   But we want to maintain and to care for the things that we have.
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.080]   We have so much.
[00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.880]   We've been blessed with so much.
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:45.960]   And so it's important for us to use that and to make good use of it.
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:50.800]   But pride gets in the way for many people.
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:58.520]   Pride makes many broke people too proud to admit they're broke.
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:04.080]   It's amazing that it does seem to me that there is more pride related to money and financial
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:11.720]   topics among people who have no intelligent basis for pride, meaning poor people, than
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:12.960]   there is even among the wealthy.
[00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.720]   I couldn't cite any data to that.
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.320]   That's just been my own experience.
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.480]   Now maybe that makes sense or maybe it doesn't.
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.340]   We'll save that for another time.
[00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:28.620]   But I've observed that if you're poor and you're too proud to receive things from others,
[00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:35.140]   people will stop offering them to you and you'll probably never be anything but poor.
[00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:39.260]   I've also observed this too, of course, for people who either are rich or want to pretend
[00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.940]   to be rich, that they're often too proud to take things.
[00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:45.980]   What happens is you develop this reputation as not being a good receiver.
[00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:51.900]   I recommend that you flip that around or at least if you want to get more free stuff.
[00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:54.180]   Be a good receiver of gifts.
[00:06:54.180 --> 00:07:00.080]   Be somebody who knows how to take something and use it and recycle it and reuse it.
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:06.900]   If you do, you'll find hundreds of dollars of value flowing into your life without you
[00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:09.460]   having to work for it.
[00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:12.220]   Here are some simple examples.
[00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:17.180]   This one used to really bug me because I had family members who would do it and I just
[00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:18.980]   hated that reputation.
[00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:20.940]   I was lacking self-confidence.
[00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:23.660]   I didn't want to appear poor, etc.
[00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:26.660]   I used to have family members who if they were a big party and of course many times
[00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:32.540]   a host will prepare a lot of food for a party or they'll order a lot of food in for catering.
[00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:36.420]   Frequently when the host of a party has done that, the host is sick of the food or they
[00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:37.900]   just want everything cleaned up.
[00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:42.860]   They've done so much work to host a big party and there's so much food left over or perhaps
[00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:44.940]   they're a small family, they can't use it.
[00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:46.820]   They would love for somebody to take it off their hands.
[00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:49.100]   Of course, many people don't want to use leftovers.
[00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:53.180]   I've never understood this anti-leftover discrimination.
[00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:57.500]   Some people have this deep, deep discrimination against leftovers.
[00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:58.700]   But whatever.
[00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:01.380]   So they don't offer it to everybody.
[00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:06.420]   But there have been so many times where I've watched family members and friends and I've
[00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:09.140]   done it myself where you're at the end of a party and someone says, "Does anybody want
[00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:10.140]   the food?"
[00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:11.820]   You say, "I'll take it, sure."
[00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:14.660]   You may have 50, 100 dollars worth of food.
[00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:19.820]   And it's great food, very expensive food, very finely prepared, catered food, etc.
[00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:21.740]   And that may feed your family for a couple of weeks.
[00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:23.860]   Hundreds of dollars worth of value.
[00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:25.220]   You run the tax savings on that.
[00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:29.180]   You figure out how much you would have had to earn with all of your expenses, work expenses,
[00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:32.700]   and now all of a sudden it becomes very, very valuable.
[00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:36.120]   Or possessions, things that people are giving away.
[00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:43.180]   Many people have this built-in concern about not wanting to give away used items.
[00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:49.500]   There's this ethos in the US American culture that says that you should only give new things.
[00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:51.340]   Now, there's a time and a place for it.
[00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:54.340]   Of course, there are some things that are best given new.
[00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:57.940]   There are things that I would give used and there are things that I would not give used.
[00:08:57.940 --> 00:08:59.780]   Same for you.
[00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:03.860]   But there are people to whom I would never give used and there are people to whom I would
[00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:06.040]   happily give used.
[00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:10.100]   But I've got a whole lot more used things to give away than I have new things.
[00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:14.500]   And so whether it's being a happy recipient of toys that are passed along from another
[00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:19.780]   family or a bicycle that's passed along or clothing that's being passed along, if you'll
[00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:23.580]   just simply say yes when someone says, "Are you interested?"
[00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:27.900]   You'll develop a reputation as somebody who appreciates being given things and then people
[00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:32.140]   will look to give you more and more things and they'll always think of you first.
[00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:34.660]   Or at least that's been our experience.
[00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:39.500]   My wife and I have been so blessed over the years of people just giving us hundreds and
[00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:48.780]   hundreds of dollars worth of valuable items that have been so helpful to us.
[00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:52.860]   We've been given furniture for free.
[00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:56.300]   We've been given cookware for free.
[00:09:56.300 --> 00:10:01.260]   We've been given clothing for ourselves and for our children for free.
[00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:08.740]   With three children, we've hardly purchased more than 50 bucks maybe, 50 to $100 worth
[00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:10.940]   of clothing for our own children.
[00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:15.600]   And those were, as I specifically remember the outfits, those were some fancy outfits
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:18.100]   that my wife really wanted for the children.
[00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:19.180]   They weren't needed.
[00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:21.380]   They weren't necessary.
[00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:25.240]   What a blessing that's been for us as a young family with young children, not having to
[00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:28.260]   pay hundreds and hundreds of dollars worth of clothing.
[00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.220]   Now when the clothing comes, frequently it comes in a big bag and you got to go through
[00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:32.220]   and sort it.
[00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:36.620]   Frequently it comes stained or dirty and you've got to go through and clean it.
[00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:41.700]   But I couldn't even calculate the value of that.
[00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:46.220]   With the exception of a few basic birthday presents here and there, my wife and I have
[00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:49.780]   never purchased toys for our children.
[00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:56.460]   We live in a sea of toys that are constantly floating through our house.
[00:10:56.460 --> 00:11:00.340]   Now part of that comes from knowing other people with children who – their children
[00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:02.520]   are done with the toys and they're ready to pass them along.
[00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:05.460]   Part of it comes because my wife is the world's greatest trash picker.
[00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:09.220]   My children think that all the world's best toys come from trash piles.
[00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:10.660]   There is so much.
[00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:14.480]   We live in a lower class neighborhood and there's so – people in lower class neighborhoods
[00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:16.340]   throw everything away.
[00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:18.020]   Brand new stuff thrown away all the time.
[00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:21.460]   I'll do a show separately on that in the future about what we've learned living in
[00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:22.460]   a lower class neighborhood.
[00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:25.820]   But one thing we've learned is that poor people throw everything away.
[00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:29.260]   So brand new stuff, tags on it and my wife is amazing.
[00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.460]   She's an amazing trash picker.
[00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:35.100]   I cheat trying to get her to set up an Instagram account or a blog or something of the stuff
[00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:36.740]   that she finds.
[00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:39.260]   But I – she doesn't want to do it.
[00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:44.140]   But we're talking hundreds of dollars in a year of stuff that she finds.
[00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:49.780]   I want to be not overly hyperbolic in my language but I mean this week she found a Kindle.
[00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:50.780]   She finds blankets.
[00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:51.780]   She finds animals.
[00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:54.460]   So our kids think all the greatest toys come off of trash piles.
[00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:58.260]   We bring them home, clean them up, make sure if it's anything that could carry germs
[00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:02.100]   that's disinfected and save in working order and all that.
[00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:09.740]   But it leads to such utter and embarrassing abundance for our children.
[00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:13.340]   They have this constant stream of stuff flowing in and then when we're done, we clean it
[00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:15.420]   up and we pass it along somewhere else.
[00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:20.980]   I don't mean to go into trash picking but part of it is just having the reputation of
[00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:24.860]   somebody who's not going to turn up their nose.
[00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:27.740]   Remember that friend that I was talking about earlier?
[00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:31.060]   In the past, I've given that person things.
[00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:34.300]   Sometimes I've given that person used items.
[00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:38.740]   Sometimes I've actually bought new things knowing that this person is in need, knowing
[00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:42.140]   that they probably are the kind of person who would very much turn up their nose if
[00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:46.620]   I give them something used because of course that's beneath them.
[00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:51.340]   Knowing that, I've purchased new things.
[00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:53.180]   You know what I found?
[00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:59.380]   They were just as bad of a receiver of new things as they were used things.
[00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:03.900]   It was amazing, really amazing to see.
[00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:11.900]   I couldn't believe it, how somebody with so little could be so proud that even the
[00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:18.340]   new things, they didn't say no, but even the new things couldn't be accepted with
[00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:20.740]   simple gratitude.
[00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:28.420]   Friend, you don't want that reputation because it's destructive to your soul and it's
[00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:34.780]   bad on your pocketbook because you've got to buy everything for yourself.
[00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:38.980]   Now obviously my friend who's very broke and very poor has no need.
[00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:42.300]   If they have no need, why would I give them anything?
[00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:44.300]   So I don't give them things anymore.
[00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:46.620]   But you know what?
[00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:51.420]   I'm happy to take the wonderful things that I'm given.
[00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:53.060]   Here's my challenge to you.
[00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:56.540]   The next time somebody says, "Would you like such and such?"
[00:13:56.540 --> 00:14:00.140]   Just train yourself to say, "Yes, absolutely."
[00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:03.540]   Now you may need to follow it on with a couple of clarifying things.
[00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:07.300]   Here would be some recommendation to you.
[00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:10.940]   One, you may need to say, "If I can't use it, I'll find somebody else that can
[00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:13.820]   use it."
[00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:17.900]   Because when you're given a lot of things, you can't keep everything.
[00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:21.900]   There's no room in my house to store all of the wonderful things that we're given.
[00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:25.380]   So what we do is we go through and we take the things that are good for us, then we pass
[00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:27.340]   them along to others.
[00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:31.660]   And then that way, in the same way that we are blessed by others, we can pass that blessing
[00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:34.140]   along to others.
[00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:38.980]   And this makes a real difference because for every poor person who is too proud to say
[00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:45.620]   yes to a good gift, my guess is there are a dozen that are not and that who will genuinely
[00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:48.100]   appreciate the good things that are given.
[00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:52.220]   Now you may have to go outside of your circle of influence.
[00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:56.660]   You may have to go outside your current sphere of friends.
[00:14:56.660 --> 00:15:00.460]   But there are some people around you who would really appreciate those nice things if you
[00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:03.060]   can get them into the proper hand.
[00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:09.900]   One of the challenges of recycling is getting the good stuff into the right person's hand.
[00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:11.380]   But you can do it.
[00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:15.060]   And sometimes it'll take a little bit of time, but it's really worth it.
[00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:18.780]   You know, half the things that my wife finds on the trash piles, well, she'll come home
[00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:20.060]   with bags of clothes.
[00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:22.580]   This week she came home with bags of clothes.
[00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:24.980]   Somebody was moving, they obviously couldn't move with them.
[00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:28.560]   Go ahead and wash them and we pass them along to go through.
[00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:30.080]   Maybe there's something in it for us.
[00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:32.300]   Maybe there's something in it for someone that we know.
[00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:36.780]   But then we just pass them along and we package them up and send them to Haiti.
[00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:42.580]   I'd a whole lot rather see a bag of clothes get washed and cleaned and sent down to Haiti
[00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:48.500]   where they can do some good versus tossed in a garbage heap in South Florida.
[00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:50.380]   What a waste.
[00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:53.900]   So perhaps you can be the one who can just pick through something and pass it along.
[00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:55.900]   Now you do need to be careful, of course.
[00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:56.900]   There are problems.
[00:15:56.900 --> 00:16:02.460]   You know, my grandfather was a farmer and he had about a 30-acre junkyard with all of
[00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:03.460]   the stuff.
[00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:04.820]   Now in those days, that was important.
[00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:06.060]   You had to do that.
[00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:09.140]   You had to keep all your old tractors and all your old stuff around for parts so that
[00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:10.140]   you could go and scavenge.
[00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:15.500]   And my grandfather, people would come from miles around to use his junkyard.
[00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:19.780]   I don't have 30 acres to dedicate to a junkyard.
[00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:22.540]   So I've got to be careful that we don't hoard things.
[00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:24.860]   And you should not hoard.
[00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:29.340]   You shouldn't just pile everything up and let it accumulate until your house looks like
[00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:32.700]   something that ought to be on a TV show dedicated to hoarding.
[00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:34.020]   Be careful, of course, with your time.
[00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:39.060]   You don't always have time to go through everything and to fix everything up and to do that.
[00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:43.380]   But frankly, those risks are very, very low.
[00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:47.420]   So here is my recommendation.
[00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:51.380]   Next time somebody says, "Would you like such and such?"
[00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:52.380]   Just say yes.
[00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:58.180]   And if you'll say yes, you'll start to develop that reputation as somebody who really appreciates
[00:16:58.180 --> 00:17:03.020]   the good things that you're given, whether they're new or used.
[00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:09.620]   And if your experience is anything like mine, I'll bet that there will be hundreds and hundreds
[00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:16.480]   of dollars worth of value that will flow into your life from others simply who want to give
[00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:18.840]   things to a good home.
[00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:25.140]   If you want to be given more things, just become a good home.
[00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:27.000]   Here's one more tip in closing.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.580]   If you're looking for something, talk from time to time about the things that you're
[00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:31.900]   looking for.
[00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:36.180]   Let people know what you're in the market for so that they can keep their eyes open
[00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:37.180]   for you.
[00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:38.340]   I experienced this recently.
[00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:42.980]   I talked about how our blender, we had this cheap blender that we got somewhere and it
[00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:44.140]   was just steadily dying.
[00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:50.020]   Every time I would use it, the motor would send off a whiff of smoke and the smell of
[00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:53.400]   smoke, not an actual whiff of smoke, but it would just kind of smell that electric burning
[00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:57.480]   smell that makes you say, "This motor is not going to last too long."
[00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:00.380]   And so we've been keeping our eyes open, just waiting on a deal.
[00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:05.040]   And so I mentioned it on the show in passing.
[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:07.640]   And I've had so many of you wonderful people just write to me.
[00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:11.480]   I had people write to me and talk to me about the virtues of a Vitamix, which by the way,
[00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:15.360]   I forget your name to the listener who sent me that, sent me the analysis, the financial
[00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:17.520]   analysis of how valuable a Vitamix is.
[00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:18.520]   Yes, I agree.
[00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:20.600]   It was well done.
[00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:23.080]   And I've been thinking for a few years about getting a Vitamix.
[00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:25.680]   Just haven't – it's not worth the $300-something to me yet.
[00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:28.280]   I need to be sure that I'm going to be using it enough.
[00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:30.840]   But I had a listener who said, "We just got a new Vitamix.
[00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:34.960]   We'd love to send you our old blender," and packaged it up and shipped it to me.
[00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:36.280]   That thing is awesome.
[00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:37.640]   It's wonderful.
[00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:41.200]   It's absolutely wonderful and it's such a blessing.
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:42.920]   So thank you to the listener who sent that.
[00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:44.080]   I appreciate it very much.
[00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:50.440]   It's a real blessing and it makes way better waffles than our other one did.
[00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:54.680]   But I use that as an example that if you let people know what you're looking for, then
[00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:57.920]   they can activate a network and they'll look for it for you.
[00:18:57.920 --> 00:18:58.920]   We do this frequently.
[00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:02.240]   If I'm going to need to get an appliance or something or we're on the market for something
[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:05.240]   or we're running short on something, we just tell people, "Hey, by the way, keep your
[00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:06.860]   ears open."
[00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:12.040]   And so many times when you tell somebody, "Hey, keep your ears open for such and such.
[00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:13.840]   We're looking for such and such.
[00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:15.440]   We're looking for a new rocking chair.
[00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:18.520]   We're looking for some new clothes for the baby.
[00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:24.640]   We're looking for whatever," and mention that to a few people, especially the good deal
[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:30.120]   hounds that you know, and all of a sudden, so frequently, a few weeks later, it shows
[00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:31.120]   up.
[00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:32.120]   It's totally for free.
[00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:34.720]   "Oh, I saw so-and-so was getting rid of it," or, "I mentioned to so-and-so that you were
[00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:38.280]   looking for such and such," and here it is.
[00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:42.480]   So be a good home and then share with others what you're looking for.
[00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:47.760]   And when you start to use these networks, these informal networks, it can put major
[00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:52.640]   money to your bottom line, which you can use for other more pressing expenses.
[00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:56.100]   There are some things that you can almost never find in the used market or that never
[00:19:56.100 --> 00:20:00.360]   find in the free market by getting the things that you can in the used and the free market
[00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:07.440]   that frees up money for those things or just frees up money for stacking up and investing.
[00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:08.440]   Try it.
[00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:11.720]   I bet you'll like it.
