[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.200]   Take a listening class.
[00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:02.060]   There's a difference between listening
[00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:03.200]   and waiting for your turn to speak.
[00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.280]   You wanna help, you wanna be there, good instincts,
[00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.000]   but your instinct is to fix.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.360]   Again, I think this is more male than female.
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.120]   Women are much better at holding space,
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.240]   men wanna fix, in general, not as a rule.
[00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:14.720]   But when somebody is struggling,
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.000]   they don't have the mental capacity
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.920]   to even take in the stuff you're telling them.
[00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.360]   All they need is to not feel alone.
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.840]   And the funny thing is, is people can take instructions.
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.600]   I called a friend, I was in a dark time, I was struggling,
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.440]   I called her up and was like,
[00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.240]   "Hey, do you have a minute, I just, I need to talk."
[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.680]   And I started telling her how I was feeling.
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:32.840]   And she went into fix it mode.
[00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.480]   And I said to her, "I don't need you to fix anything,
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.560]   "I just need you to listen."
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.120]   I can give the instruction and she goes, "Okay."
[00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.120]   And she can adjust.
[00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.560]   The thing about somebody who's struggling
[00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.200]   or depressed or down or whatever it is,
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.080]   is they can't see the obvious.
[00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.440]   That's why they're depressed or down or anxious.
[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.840]   You are not depressed, down or anxious in that moment,
[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.400]   which is why you can see the obvious.
[00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.520]   So sometimes trying to fix it and tell them
[00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.000]   will make them feel worse, right?
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.840]   You're basically calling them stupid.
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.360]   And so to be a good friend,
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.640]   you have to be good at knowing what people need
[00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.920]   in the moment and you don't even have to be intuitive.
