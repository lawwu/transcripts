[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.440]   the end of the year around November, there's always one coin that catches everyone's eye.
[00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:12.880]   And they didn't do it in 2022, which was sad. So there's like a low period 2020 2021. We're good
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:18.480]   2023 had a release that was like not as popular, but still did well. And then 2024, obviously the
[00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.400]   flowing hair coin. So we don't really know what's going to come in next year until maybe about a
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.520]   month from now. And then I can tell you like that one might be okay. And then we need to wait for a
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:34.960]   little bit more info. But I had been writing about the flowing hair coin since like June. And I have
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.520]   mockups done and everything and then everyone started using that. So I think it was really
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:45.360]   good for us to be able to be early on that information. And then we also got some a little
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.160]   bit of insider stuff just because we're a bulk supplier of the mint so we can see a little bit
[00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.440]   before the public sees like what the mintage is going to be like, what that coin might actually
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.920]   look like and stuff.
