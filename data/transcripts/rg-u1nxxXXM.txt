[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320]   If I go through my DMs right now, half of them are people that do the sports better.
[00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:05.320]   That parlay, huh?
[00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.960]   And it's like, "Bro, you just made me so much money.
[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:09.960]   Thank you.
[00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:10.960]   You're my favorite player now.
[00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:11.960]   Da-da-da-da-da."
[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:12.960]   Or it's, "Go kill yourself.
[00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:13.960]   I hope you tear an ACL."
[00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:14.960]   For real.
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:15.960]   "I hope you never..."
[00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:16.960]   That's not...
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:17.960]   And it's literally like, "Bro, I hope you..."
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:18.960]   An over-exaggeration.
[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:19.960]   "I hope you tear your ACL.
[00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:20.960]   I hope you never die."
[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:21.960]   I hope you die.
[00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:22.960]   It's the craziest.
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:23.960]   For real.
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:24.960]   I'm looking at my DMs, I'm like, "Yo."
[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:25.960]   So for a lot of people...
[00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:26.960]   It's a part of it now.
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:27.960]   But it's a phase game.
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.920]   Somebody is like, "Yo, I lost my apartment on you."
[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.760]   Or after the Knicks game, I played really bad.
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.320]   I've seen that, and I was like, "Ain't nobody tell you to bet your apartment on me in the
[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.320]   first place."
