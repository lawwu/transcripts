[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.600]   As we continue in our series, and I don't know how long this will go, we'll have to
[00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:08.600]   see.
[00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:22.000]   I told you a few weeks ago that I wanted to just go through the four gospels in somewhat
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:36.040]   random fashion, selecting very important words and conversations from the lips of Jesus.
[00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.000]   And that's what we're doing.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.100]   The very words that He said and how critical and significant they are.
[00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:52.000]   And we come to a third one of those this morning, and it's a rather extended passage.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.240]   But turn in your Bible to Matthew 7.
[00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.880]   Matthew 7.
[00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:09.200]   It's a very familiar passage, and I want to read verses 13 through 27.
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:17.480]   Matthew 7:13 through 27: "Enter through the narrow gate, for the gate is wide and the
[00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.000]   way is broad that leads to destruction.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   And there are many who enter through the narrow gate, for the gate is wide and the way is
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   narrow that leads to destruction.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   And there are many who enter through it, for the gate is small and the way is narrow that
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   leads to life.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   And there are few who find it.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   Beware of the false prophets who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly are ravenous
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   wolves.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   Beware of the false prophets who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly are ravenous
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   wolves.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   You will know them by their fruits.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   Grapes are not gathered from thorn bushes, nor figs from thistles, are they?
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   But they are from the seed of the world.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   And you will know them by their fruits.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   And you will know them by their fruits.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   And you will know them by their fruits.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   And you will know them by their fruits.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   And you will know them by their fruits.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   And you will know them by their fruits.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   And you will know them by their fruits.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   Grapes are not gathered from thorn bushes, nor figs from thistles, are they?
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   But they are from the seed of the world.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   And you will know them by their fruits.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   And you will know them by their fruits.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   And you will know them by their fruits.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   And you will know them by their fruits.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   And you will know them by their fruits.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.580]   Grapes are not gathered from thorn bushes, nor figs from thistles, are they?
[00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.240]   So every good tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears bad fruit.
[00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:03.880]   A good tree cannot produce bad fruit, nor can a bad tree produce good fruit.
[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.000]   Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire, so that
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.740]   then you will know them by their fruits.
[00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:21.520]   Not everyone who says to Me, "Lord, Lord," will enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:28.420]   does the will of My Father who is in heaven will enter.
[00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:35.500]   Many will say to Me on that day, "Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in Your name, and in Your
[00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.000]   name cast out demons, and in Your name perform miracles?"
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:46.380]   And then I will declare to them, "I never knew you.
[00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.680]   Depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness."
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:58.380]   Therefore, everyone who hears these words of Mine and acts on them may be compared to
[00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.880]   a wise man who built his house on the rock.
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.860]   And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and slammed against that house,
[00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.000]   and yet it did not fall.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.480]   For it had been founded on the rock.
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:19.020]   Everyone who hears these words of Mine and does not act on them will be like a foolish
[00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.440]   man who built his house on the sand.
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:29.820]   The rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and slammed against that house,
[00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:39.000]   and it fell, and great was its fall.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   And the rain fell, and the floods came, and great was its fall.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   And the rain fell, and the floods came, and great was its fall.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   And the rain fell, and the floods came, and great was its fall.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   And the rain fell, and the floods came, and great was its fall.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   And the rain fell, and the floods came, and great was its fall.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   And the rain fell, and the floods came, and great was its fall.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:20.940]   put it mildly. But what you have here is a very simple revelation that there are only
[00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:33.320]   two religions. There is one connected to the narrow gate, and one to the wide gate, one
[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:43.600]   connected to the way which is broad, and the other connected to the way which is narrow.
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:51.720]   One leads to destruction, the other leads to life. One has many people on it, and the
[00:04:51.720 --> 00:05:03.300]   other has few. And when you move down sort of to the end of the line on those roads,
[00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:11.260]   you meet some people who came on the broad road - in verse 21 - and they lay claim to
[00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:21.540]   knowing the Lord, doing things in His name. But definitively, he says in verse 23, "I
[00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:33.280]   never knew you. Depart from me, you who practice lawlessness." Then in verses 24 to 27, you have depicted
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:45.120]   a final judgment in which the religious people are divided between those who built on a rock,
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:59.400]   and those who built on sand, and those who built on the rock fall under judgment. But
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:03.260]   that judgment doesn't touch them. They're house-tied.
[00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:11.260]   The cross survives. Those who built on the sand fall under judgment, and destruction
[00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.520]   is the result.
[00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:19.960]   This is a very, very important portion of Scripture. There are a lot of familiar statements
[00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:28.300]   in here that you've heard in the past, but it's the definitive nature of this passage
[00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:33.240]   that is so helpful.
[00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:44.740]   "There are only two religions. There are only two possibilities." To put it simply,
[00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:55.060]   there is the true religion, and all the rest is false. All the rest may come under endless
[00:06:55.060 --> 00:07:03.220]   labels, but in the end it's false.
[00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:12.340]   It's basically a product of the false teachers mentioned in verses 15 to 20, and its fruit
[00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:28.240]   like theirs is all bad. So whatever the name of a false religion is, it's just a name,
[00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:33.200]   because there's only two possible religions: the true and the false. And the true religion
[00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:37.700]   is the one that is true, and the false is the one that is false. There are endless
[00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:48.640]   iterations of the false, but only one that is true.
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:08:01.800]   From what we read here, there is the religion that's related to the works that people do,
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.180]   done by the flesh.
[00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:09.940]   Producing a kind of self-righteousness. I like to call it the religion of self-achievement.
[00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:23.240]   But on the other hand, there is the true religion, which is by faith in the power of the Spirit
[00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:33.160]   that brings heavenly righteousness. That's the religion of divine accomplishment.
[00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:34.280]   The true religion is a kind of self-righteousness, and it's the one that is true. Just those
[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:48.760]   two. And they don't mix. If you go over to the ninth chapter of Matthew and drop down
[00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:56.600]   to verse 16, our Lord gives a couple of illustrations of how they are incompatible: "No one puts
[00:08:56.600 --> 00:09:03.040]   a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. For the patch pulls out the cloth, and the
[00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:11.740]   cloth pulls away from the garment, and a worse tear results. Nor do people put new wine in
[00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:19.280]   old wineskins; otherwise the wineskins burst, and the wine pours out, and the wineskins
[00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:24.960]   are ruined. They put new wine into fresh wineskins, and both are preserved."
[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:33.020]   What is that about? What our Lord is saying there is you can't match these two religions.
[00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:43.260]   You can't sew them together. You can't place one within the container, as it were, of another.
[00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:51.320]   It doesn't work. They don't mix. Again, there is the religion of human achievement, which
[00:09:51.320 --> 00:10:00.660]   is based on works done in the flesh, producing a kind of self-righteousness. The other is
[00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:03.000]   faith operating in the Spirit.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   And bringing heavenly righteousness. And the world is locked in a struggle between
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:20.140]   these two religions. The true one is under the power of God; the other one is under the
[00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:26.160]   power of Satan.
[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:32.240]   Now the first contrast that we see with these two is in verses 13 and 14. So let me draw
[00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:32.880]   your attention to that.
[00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:42.980]   to this. In these two verses, and they're very brief, there's a density, however, of
[00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:55.600]   reality. There are four contrasts here, verses 13 and 14: two gates, two ways, two destinations,
[00:10:55.600 --> 00:11:07.900]   and two crowds. Two gates, two ways, two destinations, and two crowds. That's all. All religion fits
[00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:21.560]   into these two. Two gates, let's start there: the narrow gate, verse 13, and the wide gate.
[00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:25.540]   Now the idea here is that these
[00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:25.540]   - -
[00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:37.960]   these are gates that are marked heaven. They're marked heaven, because down in verse 21 it's
[00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:45.780]   obvious he's talking about the kingdom of heaven and the ultimate end of life, which
[00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:55.480]   is either destruction or life - life eternal, as is referenced in verse 14.
[00:11:55.480 --> 00:12:06.220]   So these are two gates, you could say, to heaven, gates of salvation. And by the way, neither of
[00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:14.140]   them says hell. Nobody's selling hell. Nobody is propagating a religion that sends you to hell.
[00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:24.280]   They're promising you heaven, but unless it's the true religion, it's
[00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:27.580]   a damning lie.
[00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:33.580]   So let's start with the gates and understand what our Lord is saying.
[00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:43.660]   Let me break it down simply. It's a command in verse 13: "Enter, enter."
[00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:54.220]   You must enter. This is an absolute command. Not enough to stand and admire Jesus.
[00:12:54.220 --> 00:13:01.240]   Or admire His ethics, or even the ethics of the Sermon on the Mount in which this is placed.
[00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:11.740]   This is a gate, and its purpose is to let in and shut out.
[00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:19.300]   Like Matthew 25, you remember when the ten virgins were getting ready for the bridegroom
[00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:24.160]   to come at the wedding feast, and five of them wandered off. And while they were gone,
[00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:31.660]   the bridegroom came, and the virgins that were there entered in, and the door was shut.
[00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:39.940]   A door is designed to let in and let out.
[00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:52.900]   So it's not enough to stand and admire Christ, admire Christianity.
[00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:58.480]   It's not enough to stand and admire Jesus. You must enter.
[00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:09.040]   And you are going to be essentially a part of one of these two religions.
[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:18.580]   If you don't enter the narrow gate by default, you're going to find yourself on the broad road
[00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:23.200]   through the broad gate. So let's just start with that. You must enter.
[00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:29.740]   And if you want to enter the kingdom of heaven, you must enter the narrow gate.
[00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:33.700]   The narrow gate. What do you mean by the narrow gate?
[00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:42.100]   It's as narrow as the gospel, and the gospel is very narrow.
[00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:53.980]   Jesus said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father but by Me." That's narrow.
[00:14:53.980 --> 00:15:05.920]   Jesus said, "I am the light. I am the bread. I am the living water."
[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:10.960]   Those were all singular claims.
[00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:21.940]   Acts 4:12 says, "There's no salvation in any other name than the name of Jesus."
[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:30.280]   Romans 10:17 says, "Faith comes by hearing the message concerning Jesus."
[00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:39.100]   1 Corinthians 16:22 says, "If you love not the Lord Jesus Christ, you're damned."
[00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:52.540]   And 1 Timothy 2:5 says, "There's one mediator between God and man, the man Christ Jesus."
[00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:57.880]   He's the only gate.
[00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:07.900]   You must enter. If you want to be in the kingdom of heaven, you must enter, and you must enter this gate.
[00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:20.560]   A third thing to think about is you must enter this gate alone, alone.
[00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:30.640]   You leave the world behind. You leave family and friends behind.
[00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:37.180]   If you go a few chapters over to chapter 10 of Matthew,
[00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:49.180]   in verse 34, Jesus said, "Do not think that I came to bring peace on the earth.
[00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:52.660]   I came to bring peace, but a sword.
[00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:57.880]   For I came to set a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother,
[00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:04.600]   and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; and a man's enemies will be the members of his
[00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:05.620]   household."
[00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:19.240]   This is not a group exercise, not a matter of race, not a matter of
[00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:26.500]   decision, not a matter of family, not a matter of community.
[00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:39.220]   You must enter alone. The kingdom grows one soul at a time.
[00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:47.020]   You have to break away from the crowd, and even the most intimate people in your life,
[00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:50.380]   who are very frequent,
[00:17:50.380 --> 00:18:01.820]   only going to be your enemies. There's more. You must enter this narrow gate; you must
[00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:17.660]   enter alone; and you must enter with a certain measure of force. That may sound strange.
[00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:21.480]   You might think, "Well, I thought it was easy. Don't you just pray this prayer?" You see
[00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:28.420]   the TV evangelists say, "Repeat after me and you're in." That doesn't seem too difficult.
[00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:42.480]   In fact, it seems ridiculously easy, just parrot this prayer. But this is not easy,
[00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:47.640]   and we know that because at the end of verse 14 it says, "There are few who are not
[00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:59.800]   you who find it." It's hard to even find it, let alone enter it. Why is it hard to
[00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:12.100]   find it? Because you're darkened by sin, because you're doubly darkened by Satan. The God of
[00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:17.620]   this world has blinded your eyes. And because of all
[00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:34.980]   the false teachers, verses 15 to 20, spreading lies to deceive, few there be that find it.
[00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:47.600]   And for those who find it, it's very difficult to enter. You have to count the cost. And
[00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:56.140]   this is clearly indicated by our Lord. You have to count the cost. You have to be willing
[00:19:56.140 --> 00:20:13.080]   to step away from the people that you love the most. In John 12 it says you have to hate
[00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:17.580]   your own life. In Luke 9:23 it says, "You have to hate your own life." And Luke 9:23,
[00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:28.140]   it says, "If you want to come after Me, you want to follow Me, then deny yourself. Take
[00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:47.560]   up your cross and follow Me." This is why it's difficult, because it's a complete surrender.
[00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:54.020]   Now, there's a most interesting statement: "From the days of John the Baptist until now,
[00:20:54.020 --> 00:21:09.440]   the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and violent men take it by force." It's not so
[00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:17.540]   easy. It's not so easy. And Luke chapter 5 says, "You have to be willing to come after
[00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:26.920]   Chapter 13, listen to verse 24: "Strive to enter through the narrow door.
[00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:35.300]   For many, I tell you, will seek to enter and will not be able."
[00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:47.420]   It's with great difficulty that you enter.
[00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:59.340]   There's a certain violence to it, as you have to be separated from everything that was important
[00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:00.340]   to you.
[00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:03.860]   Listen to Luke 16:16.
[00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:05.280]   "And I will not enter through the narrow door."
[00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:09.320]   The Law and the Prophets were proclaimed until John.
[00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:14.760]   Since that time, the gospel of the kingdom of God has been preached, and everyone is
[00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:19.840]   forcing his way into it.
[00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:33.820]   The people who come into the kingdom come because they are desperate, so desperate they're
[00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:35.260]   willing to abandon the kingdom.
[00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:40.360]   They're willing to abandon themselves.
[00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:46.100]   They're willing to confess Jesus as Lord and themselves as His slaves.
[00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:52.540]   According to Luke 14, they're willing to count the cost.
[00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:59.320]   According to the parables of Matthew 13, verses 44 to 46, they're willing to sell everything
[00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:05.240]   to buy the pearl of great price, sell everything to buy the treasure in the field.
[00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:06.240]   It's selling everything.
[00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:07.240]   Self-denial, take up your cross, which means may cost you your life, and follow Him.
[00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:08.240]   So you must enter.
[00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:09.240]   You must enter this gate.
[00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:10.240]   You must enter alone.
[00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:15.240]   You must enter with a certain amount of violence, difficulty, and you must enter with a certain
[00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:16.240]   amount of love.
[00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:17.240]   You must enter with a certain amount of love.
[00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:18.240]   You must enter with a certain amount of love.
[00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:19.240]   You must enter with a certain amount of love.
[00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:20.240]   You must enter with a certain amount of love.
[00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:21.240]   You must enter with a certain amount of love.
[00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:22.240]   You must enter with a certain amount of love.
[00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:23.240]   You must enter with a certain amount of love.
[00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:24.240]   You must enter with a certain amount of love.
[00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:25.240]   You must enter with a certain amount of love.
[00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:26.240]   You must enter with a certain amount of love.
[00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:27.240]   You must enter with a certain amount of love.
[00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:44.680]   You must enter with a certain amount of violence, difficulty, and you must enter naked in a sense,
[00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:50.700]   with nothing in your hands.
[00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:54.000]   You can't go through the narrow gate with your baggage.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.220]   It's a turnstile.
[00:23:57.220 --> 00:24:01.820]   It's the gate of self-denial.
[00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:04.800]   You can't bring everything with you.
[00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:11.260]   That's what our Lord said to the rich young ruler in Matthew 19.
[00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:16.420]   He wanted to hold onto everything that he possessed.
[00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:23.160]   And the Lord said, "Unless you're willing to give up everything you possess, even your
[00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:27.200]   money, you can't be in the kingdom."
[00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:37.760]   He wasn't about to do that because he was very rich and turned his back.
[00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:47.740]   In other words, when you come on through the gate, you hold onto nothing.
[00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:57.180]   You're basically saying, "Lord, take whatever you want, take whatever you will, I want you
[00:24:57.180 --> 00:25:10.320]   and I want your blessing and your reward far more than I want anything that belongs
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:17.140]   to this passing world."
[00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:26.400]   And there's basically a kind of summation in all of that of what repentance means.
[00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:27.160]   You're turning your baggage.
[00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:39.840]   back on everything. So entering the narrow gate, Jesus is demanding essentially what
[00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:48.540]   He demanded in Luke 9:23: "Deny yourself, take up your cross" - that's the only thing
[00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:57.460]   you bring with you as an instrument to be crucified on - "and obey Him."
[00:25:57.460 --> 00:26:10.440]   On the other hand, you could choose the wide gate, easily found, easily marked, with all
[00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:18.220]   kinds of false teachers pointing you in that direction. Lots of crowds.
[00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:27.420]   No difficulty, no self-denial. Bring your baggage, bring your sin, bring your self-will.
[00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:35.740]   No repentance, no surrender, no submission to Christ. It's the gate of self-indulgence.
[00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:47.900]   It's for those who want a little religion, but religion that doesn't ask them to give
[00:26:47.900 --> 00:27:00.520]   up everything. Two gates lead to two ways. There is the wide way, or the broad way, in
[00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:09.740]   verse 13, and there is the narrow way in verse 14. Again, the same contrast. The broad way,
[00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:17.580]   you come through the wide gate, you bring everything with you, all your sins, all your
[00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:27.660]   offenses. There are no curbs, there are no demands, there are - nothing is forbidden.
[00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:36.400]   You can satisfy yourself, gratification, your personal will. This, you could say, is what
[00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:47.260]   Psalm 1:6 calls "the way of the ungodly." But on the other hand, you can say, "I'm going
[00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:50.860]   to be a slave to the ungodly." And on the other hand, the way behind the narrow gate
[00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:59.560]   is a narrow way. Narrow in the sense that it's constricted, it's pressed together,
[00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:11.300]   it's demanding. It calls for separation. It calls for obedience. It calls for sanctification.
[00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:16.940]   It promises persecution. You come on that way, and you're going to be a slave to the
[00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:29.860]   ungodly. And you essentially will battle all the way to glory. And there are two destinations.
[00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:40.320]   The broad way in verse 13 leads to destruction, which is hell. The narrow way leads to life,
[00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:46.780]   which is heaven. And there are only those two ways. And the broad way, in verse 13,
[00:28:46.780 --> 00:29:01.220]   says, "And there are two crowds. There are many, many on the broad road and few on the
[00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:16.460]   narrow." Few. It isn't long in this passage. In fact, it's verse 21. "That way, you will
[00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:29.160]   be a slave to the ungodly." That's the broad way. Let's go down to verse 21: "Not everyone
[00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:35.880]   who says to Me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the
[00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:44.460]   will of My Father who is in heaven will enter. Many - " oh, there they are. "There are the
[00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:53.860]   many. And they will say on that day" - what's that day? That's the day they face God, face
[00:29:53.860 --> 00:30:10.000]   the Lord. "And they're going to say, 'Lord, Lord, we did do Your will. We prophesied in
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.140]   Your name, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name performed the works of the
[00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:22.680]   Lord. We performed many miracles. And then I will declare to them, 'I never knew You.
[00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:35.640]   Apart from Me, You who practice lawlessness.'" That's the end of the broad way. You get rejected,
[00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:43.820]   and you get rejected by the judge. And even though you lay claim to service to the Lord,
[00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:51.800]   you're serving Him. You say, "Lord, Lord." The repetition of that is fraught with a
[00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:59.660]   certain kind of passion. To say, "Lord, Lord," is both polite and respectful, and you could
[00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:13.500]   say orthodox and fundamental and full of passion and zeal and fervor. And we - did we not prophesy
[00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:24.460]   in Your name? We were associated with You. And didn't we cast out demons in Your name,
[00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:34.340]   and in Your name perform many miracles? Of course, these are false claims. We were doing
[00:31:34.340 --> 00:31:43.180]   it all for You. This is the ultimate deception of false religion. You actually, you actually
[00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:56.500]   preach, assault the kingdom of darkness, and perform miracles in the name of the Lord,
[00:31:56.500 --> 00:32:03.620]   and He doesn't know you. Why? Because those are not the marks of true faith. Marks of
[00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:12.860]   true faith are obedience and righteousness. And he makes that clear in verse 23: "You
[00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:22.260]   practice lawlessness, depart from me."
[00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:37.500]   There has to be in this group the most disappointed people in all of human history. These are
[00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:42.540]   not atheists. These are not agnostics. These are not Muslims. These are not Christians.
[00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:51.200]   These are not Muslims and Buddhists and whatever. These are people who outwardly identified
[00:32:51.200 --> 00:33:06.580]   with Christ, but their lives were not marked by righteousness. Righteousness. In fact,
[00:33:06.580 --> 00:33:12.220]   the form of our Lord's comment, "Depart from me, you who practice lawlessness," is
[00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:23.580]   actually, "You who do always work lawlessness." Your profession is valueless. This is the blasphemy
[00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:30.560]   of the sanctuary, which is worse than the blasphemy of the street. So many people are
[00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:41.900]   in false religion and false forms of Christianity, millions of them, professing to know Christ,
[00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:47.820]   but they are not truly believers. They are just empty words. They may call Jesus "Lord,
[00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:59.860]   Lord," but never submit to Him. They're not marked by righteousness. Jeff O'Hara wrote,
[00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:06.000]   "Why call me 'Lord, Lord,' and do not the things I say? You call me 'the way' and walk
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:12.220]   me not. You call me 'the life' and live me not. You call me 'master' and obey me not.
[00:34:12.220 --> 00:34:20.000]   If I condemn you, blame me not. You call me 'bread' and eat me not. You call me 'truth'
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:32.120]   and believe me not. You call me 'Lord' and serve me not. If I condemn you, blame me not."
[00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:35.680]   James 1:22 says, "Don't be just a hearer of the Word of God. Don't be just a hearer of
[00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:49.040]   the Word, deceiving your own selves, but be a doer." It's not the profession; it's the
[00:34:49.040 --> 00:35:05.360]   reality that matters. And we come then to verses 24 to 27, and
[00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:16.400]   we see the end of both roads, both groups, in a picture of judgment. Judgment is depicted
[00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:28.760]   as a storm, and the individuals who are caught in the storm are depicted as houses. Verse
[00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:35.040]   24: "Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and acts on them" - that's what righteous
[00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:45.960]   righteousness is like: you hear, you believe, you obey. "Everyone who hears these words
[00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:57.100]   of mine and acts on them may be compared to a wise man who built his house on the rock.
[00:35:57.100 --> 00:36:04.720]   And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and slammed against that house.
[00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:07.160]   And yet it did not fall, for it had been founded on the rock. And yet it did not fall, for it
[00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:11.040]   had been founded on the rock. And yet it did not fall, for it had been founded on the rock.
[00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:16.700]   Everyone who hears these words of mine and does not act on them, does not do them, will
[00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:22.660]   be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand. The rain fell, and the floods
[00:36:22.660 --> 00:36:32.300]   came, and the winds blew and slammed against that house, and it fell. And great was its
[00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:35.620]   fall."
[00:36:35.620 --> 00:36:44.860]   These are houses that are indistinguishable. The assumption here is they built these houses
[00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:53.840]   in the same location because the same storm hit them. They built a house, so this is common
[00:36:53.840 --> 00:37:01.980]   religious enterprise, a life of religious activity. They apparently built these houses
[00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:12.820]   apparently built from similar materials because it was not obvious before the judgment who
[00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:19.820]   would survive and who would not. And our Lord pointed that out, didn't He, in the wheat
[00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:26.740]   and tares, that we don't know who the wheat are and who the tares are until the judgment.
[00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:31.660]   One built a religious house on Petra, rock bed.
[00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:40.820]   And that would be Christ and obedience to His word. The other built on sand, and that
[00:37:40.820 --> 00:37:51.860]   would be any other ideology propagated by the false teachers.
[00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:59.340]   And when the judgment comes, the house on the rock stands, and the house on the sand
[00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:01.340]   collapses.
[00:38:01.340 --> 00:38:12.260]   And again, just to make the obvious clear, the final story will not be known until the
[00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:21.800]   final judgment. It won't become manifest. And again, that's why our Lord says, "Let
[00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:28.880]   the wheat and tares grow together," because you can't sort them out. I mean, really, if
[00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:31.020]   you have people saying, "Lord, Lord."
[00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:40.560]   And proclaiming His name and going against the kingdom of darkness in His name and endeavoring
[00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:52.020]   to perform miracles in His name, pretty hard to tell whether they're false.
[00:38:52.020 --> 00:39:00.700]   Now, if you look at the life and you see lawlessness and unrighteousness, it's obvious. But if you
[00:39:00.700 --> 00:39:09.600]   obvious, but hypocrites are hypocrites because they're pretty good at covering that up.
[00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:20.040]   And I think there are people who are deceived about their own hypocrisy.
[00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:26.400]   Everything comes down to this: "What do you do with the word of the Lord?"
[00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:47.160]   "These words of Mine" - verse 24 - "These words of Mine" - verse 26.
[00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:56.200]   Those who are truly saved live by the Word of God, love the Word of God, desire to obey
[00:39:56.200 --> 00:40:01.000]   the Word of God.
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:15.600]   They have a commitment to obedience, to righteousness, to sanctification.
[00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:17.960]   That's a dominating commitment in their life.
[00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:26.000]   It doesn't mean you're perfect; far from it.
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:32.320]   matters to them.
[00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:48.620]   The people who build on sand are the people who don't particularly care about obedience,
[00:40:48.620 --> 00:40:51.840]   and their house will be destroyed.
[00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:57.600]   Luke 6:47 and 48 makes a distinction I think is interesting.
[00:40:57.600 --> 00:41:08.040]   In its parallel passage on this, it says the people on the rock dug deep.
[00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:12.340]   This man dug deep.
[00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:21.820]   Meaning, counting the cost, submitting willpower.
[00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:35.680]   Will and way and life and possessions and relationships to Christ.
[00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:40.020]   It's just a question of how deep you dig.
[00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:49.300]   And again, it's not just as simple as parroting a prayer.
[00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:50.660]   If your house is built on nothing less than Jesus' blood, then you're not going to be
[00:41:50.660 --> 00:41:51.800]   buried.
[00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:58.660]   If your house is built on nothing less than Jesus' blood and righteousness, you have had
[00:41:58.660 --> 00:42:07.740]   a deep dive into the kingdom.
[00:42:07.740 --> 00:42:19.500]   You understand what you have abandoned and what you have embraced.
[00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:21.780]   How deep does your…
[00:42:21.780 --> 00:42:28.000]   How deep does your love for the Lord and your obedience penetrate into your heart and
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:34.320]   soul and life?
[00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:44.360]   That's the question that reveals where you are.
[00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:51.760]   Narrow road or broad road?
[00:42:51.760 --> 00:43:02.180]   And Paul says in 2 Corinthians 13:5, "Examine yourself whether you be in the faith."
[00:43:02.180 --> 00:43:12.060]   Most important thing you can ever know, and the Lord will reveal it to you.
[00:43:12.060 --> 00:43:21.740]   You may be involved in the church, in a class, a Bible study, a group.
[00:43:21.740 --> 00:43:34.200]   You may be involved in the discussions of Scripture and theology as a curiosity or
[00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:37.040]   academic pursuit.
[00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:51.720]   But if your house is built on the sand, there's a great way to know that.
[00:43:51.720 --> 00:44:04.180]   It's usually that you know you are over-indulgent in sin.
[00:44:04.180 --> 00:44:07.080]   You lack penitence.
[00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:10.600]   You have no hunger for holiness.
[00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:15.740]   You abuse grace.
[00:44:15.740 --> 00:44:21.700]   You have a secret life of hidden transgressions.
[00:44:21.700 --> 00:44:35.920]   So I repeat verse 13: "Enter through the narrow gate, for the gate is wide and the
[00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:38.220]   way is broad.
[00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:49.260]   That leads to destruction, and there are many who enter through it."
[00:44:49.260 --> 00:44:51.680]   I hate the fact that it's many.
[00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:56.280]   But that's the reality.
[00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:58.440]   Let it not include you.
[00:44:58.440 --> 00:45:02.280]   Let's bow in prayer.
[00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:13.000]   Nothing, of course, in the world is more important than the gospel and the salvation that is
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:17.160]   made available through the gospel.
[00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:21.660]   Lord, speak to anyone who's holding on to the gospel.
[00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:37.360]   Let them do anything in this world that's keeping them from fully committing to Jesus Christ.
[00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:41.160]   Show them the folly of that.
[00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:47.280]   Don't let them get away with empty words from empty hearts.
[00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:51.640]   Bring the truth to bear.
[00:45:51.640 --> 00:46:05.400]   And the life, both abundant and eternal, that is available because You are such a loving
[00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:07.600]   and gracious God.
[00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:14.320]   Do Your work in every heart, we pray, for Your glory.
[00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:15.320]   Amen.
[00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:16.320]   Amen.
[00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:16.320]   Amen.
