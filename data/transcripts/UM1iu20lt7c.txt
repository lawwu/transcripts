[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.600]   As we anticipate the annual celebration of the resurrection of Jesus, Chip in Georgia writes in to ask this,
[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:18.100]   "Pastor John, Christian hedonism seems to say that our deepest longings in this life can only be satisfied by God,
[00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.100]   and it's only in Him that we can be truly happy.
[00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.600]   If God makes us happier than people who simply pursue the world,
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.100]   why does Paul say we are to be pitied, most of all men, if there is no resurrection?
[00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:36.600]   Isn't our life now, even now, more satisfying than that of the non-Christian?"
[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.600]   What do you say, Pastor John?
[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:46.600]   I'm smiling real big. I love sharp, biblically-rooted questions.
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.100]   So I've asked this. In fact, I've spoken on it.
[00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.600]   Years ago, I spoke to the Wycliffe folks in Cameroon on this very question.
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.600]   So I was trying to remember what I said.
[00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:04.600]   It is a really important and good question rooted in 1 Corinthians 15.
[00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:11.600]   So let me just bring Chip up and the rest of us to where I'm thinking today.
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:19.600]   I don't know that I have the completely satisfying answer, but I have some answers that have helped me.
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:26.600]   Just a clarification to start with about Christian joy in this painful life.
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:35.600]   A huge part of our joy as Christians is what Paul calls "rejoicing in hope," from Romans 5.
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:44.600]   In other words, joy is not complete in what we can know and have of God here now.
[00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:52.600]   Our joy is in hope of what we will know and have of God in the future also.
[00:01:52.600 --> 00:02:03.600]   Our joy here is a foretaste of the fullness of joy there, and so it's not complete now.
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:10.600]   We see through a glass darkly, and we know in part, so our joy is in part.
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:18.600]   It's strong now, it's deep now, it's enough to carry the day now, but it's nothing near like what it will be.
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:26.600]   So Romans 5 says, "Through him we have obtained access by faith into the grace in which we stand,
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.600]   and we rejoice in hope of the glory of God."
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:39.600]   That means that the joy we anticipate in the age to come flows back into this age in measure,
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.600]   but not in fullness, but in measure.
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.600]   "We rejoice in our sufferings," he says, "knowing that our suffering produces endurance,
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.600]   and endurance produces character, and character produces hope."
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:03:01.600]   So we are people who have this strange emotional experience of rejoicing in what we don't yet have to make us happy.
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:09.600]   So I don't want to overstate the joy of the Christian hedonist in this age.
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:18.600]   It is not nearly what it will be in the age to come, and much of it is anticipatory now.
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:24.600]   So here are the key words that create the problem in 1 Corinthians 15.
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.600]   The context is Paul's talking about whether Christ has been raised from the dead or not.
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.600]   He says, "If Christ has not been raised from the dead," this is verse 14 following,
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:40.600]   "If Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain and your faith is in vain.
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:47.600]   We are even found to be misrepresenting," that is, we're false witnesses of God, liars about God,
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:54.600]   "because we have testified about God that he raised Christ, whom he did not raise, if it is true that the dead are not raised."
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:01.600]   And then verse 17, "If Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile, you are still in your sins,
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:07.600]   then those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished," we're going to come back to that, that's really crucial,
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:13.600]   Christians have gone to hell, those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished, they've gone to hell,
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:22.600]   "If in Christ we have hope only in this life, we are of all people most to be pitied."
[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:29.600]   And the question is, how can Christians who have more joy than anybody else be most to be pitied?
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:34.600]   That's the question. And I'm asking, why'd you say that, Paul?
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.600]   And here are the, I think I see four reasons for why Paul says this.
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:50.600]   Number one, evidently Paul believes that delusion, a life of delusion, is to be pitied, even if it's a happy delusion.
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:05:00.600]   It's not just that we are experiencing in this, what we're experiencing in this life proves to be more or less happy in the other,
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.600]   it proves to be non-existent in the other.
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:12.600]   If Christ is not raised from the dead, then my joy in the living Christ is not joy in the living Christ.
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:20.600]   There is no living Christ, and therefore I am not experiencing joy in the living Christ.
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.600]   I am an absolute idiot, I'm a fool.
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:29.600]   Paul's first conviction, it seems to me, is that this is not true, Christ is raised,
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:36.600]   and his second conviction is that it's a delusion if he's not raised,
[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:43.600]   and it's an enormous delusion, more pitiable than anything he could think of, evidently.
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:51.600]   So that's the first reason. A delusory life, a life lived in absolute delusion, is to be pitied.
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:06:04.600]   Number two, Paul's life would be pitiable because he willingly embraced so much suffering that he could have avoided.
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:13.600]   Those sufferings were sustained by Paul's joy in Christ, not the other way around.
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:17.600]   The sufferings didn't create the joy in this life.
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:24.600]   So if there's no resurrection, those sufferings were absolutely pointless.
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:25.600]   That's the second one.
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:39.600]   Number three, we deny ourselves many pleasures here precisely for the sake of the reward of the age to come.
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:44.600]   So Jesus said, "Blessed are you when others revile you and persecute you
[00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.600]   and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account.
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:54.600]   Rejoice and be glad now, for your reward is great in heaven."
[00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:59.600]   So we renounce retaliation and the joy of getting back at people.
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:08.600]   We renounce that. We renounce the comforts of fitting into the world so that we don't ever have to be criticized or reviled.
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.600]   We renounce that. Why?
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:16.600]   Precisely because we believe it will be made up to us in heaven,
[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:23.600]   which means we didn't just fail to maximize the pleasures we could have had here,
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:30.600]   but we bargained that the self-denial would be rewarded in the resurrection.
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:34.600]   And there is no resurrection, and the bargain failed.
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:38.600]   And here's the fourth and last reason I think he said this.
[00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:41.600]   This one comes straight out of his words.
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:50.600]   If Christ and we are not raised from the dead, then Paul doesn't infer atheism.
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:53.600]   He infers hell.
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:08:04.600]   That we enter a worse punishment in hell than others because we didn't just make a mistake.
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:08.600]   We actively misrepresented God.
[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:12.600]   Oftentimes I've read this chapter and this argument as though,
[00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:16.600]   "Well, if there's no resurrection from the dead, the whole biblical religion is false.
[00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:19.600]   There is no God. Cesaros or others, each one can be married."
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.600]   That is not what Paul does. He didn't argue like that.
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:28.600]   He says, "If Christ has not been raised, God's going to send me to hell
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:34.600]   because I've been telling everybody that this is his son, and he's been raised from the dead,
[00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:38.600]   and I am a false prophet.
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:46.600]   And therefore, I am, of all people, most to be pitied, for I'm going to get the worst punishment."
[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:50.600]   So in sum, I would sum it up. Here they are.
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:59.600]   If there is no risen Christ, no resurrection of believers unto eternal reward and joy,
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:02.600]   then number one, Christian life is a delusion.
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:06.600]   Number two, voluntary suffering is painfully pointless.
[00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:10.600]   Number three, hope in heaven is futile.
[00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:14.600]   And all of our basing our self-denials on it was ridiculous.
[00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:21.600]   And number four, any attempt to speak for the living Christ would be a damnable scam
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:26.600]   and a false prophecy which would deserve hell even more than others,
[00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:29.600]   and we would perish under that severe sentence.
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:33.600]   So we are, of all people, most to be pitied.
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:38.600]   Profoundly sobering connections. Everything hinges on the resurrection.
