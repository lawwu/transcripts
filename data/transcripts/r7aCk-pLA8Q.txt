[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.640]   Biblical counseling and it is a great joy to be able to continue our study of God's Word.
[00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:13.760]   Thank you so much for your faithfulness and for your dedicated study to the Word of God as we've
[00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:20.640]   been working our way through these wonderful topics as outlined by the ACBC Theology exams.
[00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:27.360]   I trust that this study has been a blessing to you and it's been a blessing to me to be able to
[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:36.240]   walk through these topics together. We had a wonderful encouragement this week to be able to
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:41.520]   certify one of the counselors who's been in training here at the Kindred Counseling Center.
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:50.560]   Denise Lopez completed her phase three of ACBC certification this week and we rejoiced in that
[00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:56.960]   and gave God thanks and gave him glory for all that he had done in her life and just to see
[00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:05.600]   Denise walk through this process of writing these essays and working her way through the 50 hours
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:12.880]   of supervised counseling was a great joy and it is just a joy to be part of this ministry. It's
[00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:21.280]   just a great privilege to be able to partner with many of you and to be part of the training
[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:28.560]   up of biblical counselors who would be able to use God's Word in other people's lives and to be
[00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:35.280]   able to minister the truth of God's Word to people's hearts. So thank you again for being
[00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:43.440]   part of this class and we are working our way toward the end of the 24 theology exam questions.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:51.920]   We are on theology exam number 22 tonight and we are looking at the very important and
[00:01:51.920 --> 00:02:02.240]   very practical topic of the Holy Spirit and guidance. How does the Holy Spirit guide or lead
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:10.240]   the believer in Christ as the believer walks through the practical issues of life? I do think
[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:17.600]   that this topic is very important. I know I say that of every single topic in the theology exams,
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:28.160]   but this one is very important for the simple reason that all of us are seeking to make
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:34.160]   decisions about life. All of us are working through life's issues and the question of
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:41.520]   how does the Holy Spirit lead and guide us as we make decisions and as we deal with
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:47.920]   the practical course of life is one that is practical for all of us and it's also something
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:56.000]   that many counselees come and ask for counsel on this issue. So I pray that this will be a
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:03.200]   helpful hour for us as we work through this very important topic. So let me pray for us. Let's
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.920]   devote our time to the Lord and we'll dive into our study for tonight. Let me pray.
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:16.240]   Our Father, we thank you, Lord, tonight that you indeed have given us your Holy Spirit.
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:26.480]   We thank you that your Spirit lives in us. We thank you that we have been baptized into the
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:34.560]   person and into the ministry of the Holy Spirit. We thank you for your Spirit's work in our lives,
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:43.520]   that your Spirit works to show us Christ and that through the Holy Spirit's teaching ministry,
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:51.120]   we come to understand the truths about Jesus Christ and we come to exalt Him and to love Him,
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.800]   and indeed your Spirit is doing a work in our lives to make us more like Christ,
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:03.680]   that He is bearing the sweet fruit of the Spirit in us, that our character would be conformed
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:11.680]   to Christ's likeness. Father, we thank you for the Spirit's guiding and leading ministry.
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:19.680]   We pray that we might be able to understand this topic in a greater manner, greater fullness
[00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:26.160]   tonight as we look at your Word. We pray that you would help us to be teachable
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:35.520]   and to evaluate, Father, our own understanding of this issue in light of what your Word would
[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:41.040]   teach to us, and so we just pray for each of our hearts that your Spirit would
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:47.760]   convict us and teach us and lead us, and we pray that you would be honored and glorified in our
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.640]   time together. Thank you for each of my brothers and sisters here for their faithfulness, and I
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.960]   pray that they may be encouraged as we look at your Word tonight. We pray all this in the name
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:06.880]   of Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen. Amen. Well, we are looking at the issue tonight of the Holy Spirit
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:14.320]   and guidance or the leading of the Holy Spirit in our lives. If you're with us in our last session,
[00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:20.560]   we looked at the truth that we have been given the Holy Spirit as believers in Christ.
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:28.960]   The Holy Spirit lives in us. The Holy Spirit not only comes alongside of us, but the Holy Spirit
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:37.680]   dwells in us so that our bodies are literally temples of the Holy Spirit, and tonight we're
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:44.960]   looking at one of the specific ministries of the Holy Spirit, and that is what we might call the
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:55.280]   leading of the Holy Spirit or, as the theology exam states, the guidance of the Holy Spirit.
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:04.640]   Here we're looking at a topic that is immensely practical. We're looking at the issue of how does
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:15.040]   God lead the believer from point A to point B? How does the Holy Spirit guide the believer
[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:21.920]   in Christ? And if you really think about it, you and I tend to use this language to describe our
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:30.720]   Christian lives. You will often hear it said, you may even say to another believer in the church,
[00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:39.280]   something like the following, "God led me to this church, and I now love this church,
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:47.040]   and I serve at this church, and it was eight years ago that God led me to this church."
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:55.040]   You may even tell your testimony in a certain way by saying, "God led me to the school,"
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:04.240]   or, "God led me to live in this city. God led me to this job or this company."
[00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:11.280]   You may even hear pastors or missionaries say of their story that,
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:22.000]   "God led me to the mission field," or, "God led me into this ministry. God led me to seminary."
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:30.800]   These are common phrases and common statements that we often use as we describe our Christian
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:39.440]   lives, as we tell our story. We use this language of, "God led me," or, "God guided me here."
[00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:48.880]   But what do we mean when we say that, "God led me to a certain place," or, "to a certain vocation,"
[00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:58.720]   or, "God led me to marry my wife," or, "God led me to this school where I would have this
[00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:04.320]   opportunity to continue my education." What exactly do we mean by that language of
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:15.520]   leading or guiding? How does the Holy Spirit lead or guide the believer as the believer makes
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:21.920]   certain decisions walking through the practical issues of life?
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:30.880]   So, really, we are dealing with the subject of the Holy Spirit's leadership or the Holy Spirit's
[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:40.320]   guidance, but the broader subtopic under this issue of the Holy Spirit's leadership really is
[00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:51.680]   the subject of biblical decision making. How does the Holy Spirit lead us or guide us
[00:08:51.680 --> 00:09:00.720]   as we make decisions about our life, as we make decisions about the course of our lives?
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:09.200]   And so, even though the essay topic deals with the issue of the Holy Spirit and guidance,
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:15.680]   much of the material that we're going to be looking at tonight can be categorized under the
[00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:28.320]   subtopic or heading of biblical decision making. Decision making is what we do, and we do that
[00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:38.080]   anticipating that the Holy Spirit will lead us as we make decisions about our lives. And so,
[00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:43.680]   maybe I could put it this way in terms of practicality. As we look backwards on our lives,
[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:50.560]   we say that God led me to the school, or God led me to this church, or God led me to this ministry.
[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:58.800]   We can say that in hindsight as we look at our lives from the perspective of the present looking
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:09.840]   into the past, but as we as believers are moving to the future from the present, we make decisions.
[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:18.480]   We have to make decisions about the very same issues, about what job we should take, or what
[00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:26.240]   church we should attend. We make decisions about should we date, or should we marry,
[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:34.960]   or whom shall we marry. We make decisions about what car do I drive, or what car do I buy,
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:40.880]   or what home do I purchase, if I should purchase a home, or what investment should we make.
[00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:49.120]   We make decisions about what ministry should I engage in, or which location or setting should
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:56.720]   I serve in. We make decisions moving forward, and then looking backwards from the vantage point of
[00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:06.240]   time, we can say God led me to this place, or to this vocation, or to this mission field,
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:15.600]   or to this ministry. So, we're really talking about the category of the guidance of the Holy
[00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:21.200]   Spirit, but underneath that, we're looking at the subject of how do we make decisions,
[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:29.760]   anticipating that the Holy Spirit will lead us and guide us as we make those decisions about
[00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:38.800]   our lives. Now, if we frame the topic in this way, I hope you will immediately see that
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:47.920]   this is an immensely practical topic for each of our lives, and it will have very immediate
[00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:56.560]   application to each of our lives, because the truth is that all of us are making decisions
[00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:07.120]   about our lives. All of us are making minor decisions, such as where should I eat today,
[00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:16.160]   or what shall I eat tonight for dinner, or what outfit should I wear, or what time shall I wake
[00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:23.440]   up tomorrow. All of us are making minor decisions, small decisions as we walk through the course of
[00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:30.720]   our lives from Monday to Sunday, but then at the same time, many of us are in the midst of making
[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:41.280]   major decisions, major life decisions, such as should I marry, whom shall I marry,
[00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:52.080]   where shall we live, should I move, should I stay, should I purchase a home, should I buy a car,
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:13:00.800]   should I continue to rent, where should I put my children for schooling, should I public school,
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:09.360]   private school, homeschool, should I see this doctor and pursue this course of medical treatment,
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:15.680]   or should I pursue another doctor and pursue an alternate course of medical treatment.
[00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:23.360]   All of us are making decisions, but some of us, even tonight, are making
[00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:30.640]   major life decisions that are going to affect the course of our lives for years to come.
[00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:41.520]   And the question would be, how do we make these life decisions seeking the Holy Spirit's guidance,
[00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:48.800]   seeking the Holy Spirit's leadership? How can we be sure that we are making these decisions
[00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:54.560]   under the guidance and the leadership of the Holy Spirit? Because I think all of you would
[00:13:54.560 --> 00:14:00.400]   agree that none of us just want to make these decisions on our own. None of us just want to
[00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:07.920]   make these major life decisions in our own wisdom, in our own strength, and have to work these things
[00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:18.080]   out in our own power. We all want the Holy Spirit to lead us and to guide us as we work through
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:27.200]   these very practical issues of life. And so this is a very, very practical subject. And I'm just
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:32.960]   going to steal my own thunder tonight and just give you the main point before we back up a little
[00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:37.760]   bit and talk through the importance of decision-making. I just want to give you the main
[00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:45.600]   point and what I think ACBC wants you to write in this essay, at least the main point of what I've
[00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:52.400]   written in my essay, and it passed, so I'm assuming that this is what they want to hear.
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:59.360]   What really the crux of the issue when it comes to this subject is simply this.
[00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:09.440]   Many people believe that the Holy Spirit will guide me and lead me as I seek His direction
[00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:16.960]   in these issues of where should I go to school or who should I marry or where should I live.
[00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:24.960]   Many people believe that we should be seeking an extra biblical revelation,
[00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:37.360]   some kind of direct word from the Lord, or even some kind of impression or personal experience
[00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:46.400]   that would confirm the Holy Spirit's leading. Or to put it real bluntly, many people believe that
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:53.920]   what we should be seeking is what Pastor Dave Doyle here at Kindred calls the woo-woo,
[00:15:53.920 --> 00:16:03.520]   that in order for me to know what school I should go to or what job I should take or what ministry
[00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:13.520]   I should serve in, that I need to seek and I need to receive the woo-woo, some kind of spiritual
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:22.000]   zap, some kind of extra biblical revelation, some kind of direct word from the Lord, or at least
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:34.480]   some kind of impression or some kind of personal experience that would directly give me guidance
[00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:42.640]   in this area apart from the study and the application of the written Word of God.
[00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:54.000]   And oftentimes, people explain their decisions in this way by saying I was led to a certain ministry
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:04.480]   and I felt the woo-woo, I felt the zap or whatever they would describe it to be, some kind of
[00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:10.400]   dramatic spiritual experience that directly confirmed that this was indeed the Holy Spirit's
[00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:19.120]   leading and guidance. Other people would even say that I was led in a certain direction and I even
[00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:28.800]   saw or felt words that told me that this was indeed the right course of action to take.
[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:37.840]   And so you'll hear some, maybe some men even say that, you know, I met my wife and when I first
[00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:45.520]   met her, you know, the Holy Spirit zapped me and I received the woo-woo, and that was probably just
[00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:51.600]   romantic feelings, or you could just probably just say you liked her, but some people would
[00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:57.840]   even say, you know, God just confirmed in my heart in a direct way that this was the one.
[00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:07.440]   And while I'm sympathetic on a personal experiential level to some of those experiences,
[00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:15.920]   we need to discern what exactly the Bible says about the Holy Spirit and guidance.
[00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:23.520]   How does the Holy Spirit lead us? Does he lead us through extra-biblical revelations?
[00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:32.400]   Does he lead us through zapping us directly with certain experiences? Does he lead us through
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:42.400]   mystical experiences or dreams or visions where we directly receive certain leadership or guidance
[00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:51.760]   from God? You will even hear some people say that God told me to take this job, or God told me to
[00:18:52.880 --> 00:19:00.880]   marry this woman, or God told me to go to this city, and we just want to evaluate that
[00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:07.920]   biblically and be discerning about what the Word of God teaches. It really is my thesis tonight,
[00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:13.360]   and it's my main point tonight that I want to encourage you with, that the Holy Spirit
[00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:25.520]   guides us through his Word. The Holy Spirit guides us through his written Word, that the way that we
[00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:33.520]   receive the Holy Spirit's guidance or leadership as we make decisions about our lives and about
[00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:42.880]   our families is we study the Word of God, we understand the Word of God, and then we make
[00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:50.400]   application of the Word of God to the situations that are before us, and it is through the ministry
[00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:57.120]   of the written Word of God, not apart from the ministry of the Word of God, that we receive the
[00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:05.120]   Holy Spirit's leadership and guidance as we make these types of decisions about our lives.
[00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:11.840]   Now, I understand that it's a lot more glamorous, and it's a lot more spectacular for me to tell you
[00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:21.840]   that God told me directly 24 years ago that I should marry my wife Mina, and that might get a
[00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:29.120]   lot more attention, and it might seem a little more spectacular than if I said that I studied
[00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:34.720]   the Scripture, and the Bible says that he who finds a good wife finds a good thing,
[00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:44.800]   and I studied the Scripture and learned that I should marry a believer. You know, that was a
[00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:53.360]   biblical principle that I should most likely find a believer who is filled with the Holy Spirit,
[00:20:53.360 --> 00:21:02.080]   and as I apply these principles to the situation that was before me, which is that my wife was a
[00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:08.960]   godly woman who was teachable to the Word of God, and as I applied those principles to the situation,
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:17.200]   the Holy Spirit led me to pursue marriage with my wife. Now, that may not sound as glamorous as
[00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:22.800]   saying, you know, I saw my wife, and then the Holy Spirit zapped me, and I knew all of a sudden that,
[00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:27.680]   you know, I should marry her, or I heard an audible voice that said, "Marry this woman."
[00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:35.440]   That might sound a little more dramatic or exciting, but the truth is that the Holy Spirit
[00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:45.440]   guides us as we study and apply His Word. The Holy Spirit will lead us as we take the written Word
[00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:55.520]   that He has inspired, and as we study it, learn it, apply it, and then learn to discern life's
[00:21:55.520 --> 00:22:03.280]   issues according to what the Word of God would teach and apply the Word of God to the situations
[00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:10.800]   before us. That is how the Holy Spirit leads and guides us. He leads us through His written Word,
[00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:18.480]   not apart from His written Word. Now, all of that is to say something very practical.
[00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:24.880]   If you and I are not spending time in God's Word, in the written Word of God,
[00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:33.520]   if we are not bathing our thoughts in the written Word of God, if we are not bathing our souls in
[00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:40.880]   the truth of God's Word, then the simple fact is this. We will not be making good decisions
[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:48.640]   about our lives. We will not be making good decisions about those very same issues that I
[00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:58.320]   talked about, of should I purchase this property, or should I rent here, or should I public school,
[00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:02.320]   private school, homeschool my children. Those are all decisions that are before us, and
[00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:09.920]   we will not be making very good decisions unless we are bathing our lives and our minds in the
[00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:17.760]   Word of God, because the one way that the Holy Spirit leads and guides us as we make those types
[00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:29.280]   of decisions is He leads us through His Word and not apart from His Word. With that said, I've kind
[00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:35.040]   of given you the main point of tonight's teaching, but with that said, let me walk you through some
[00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:42.000]   of this material and lay some foundation and then see if some of this will make sense. This is a
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:49.040]   study that I think we could spend a number of hours looking at the subject of biblical decision
[00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:54.720]   making and the Holy Spirit and guidance, but we'll have to content ourselves with a one-hour
[00:23:54.720 --> 00:24:01.920]   introduction tonight, and I hope it'll whet your appetite for further study. Let me read the
[00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:08.640]   question and then give you some resources. Theology exam number 22 is provide your understanding of
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:20.000]   how the Holy Spirit guides Christians, so just a simple answer here. If you state anything else
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   other than the Holy Spirit guides Christians through His written Word, the 66 books of the
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:35.440]   Bible, then your answer is going to be wrong, and so ACBC does have a grading template of pass,
[00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:43.360]   and then there is not pass, and then there's a third category called fatal error. My goal in
[00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:51.520]   this class has been to keep each of my students out of that category of fatal error. It would be,
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:57.840]   I'm not sure how ACBC would grade this, but I'm thinking it would probably be
[00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:04.640]   nearing the line of fatal error if you say anything else other than the Holy Spirit guides us
[00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:12.640]   through the Scriptures. Holy Spirit guides us through our understanding of the written
[00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:18.800]   Word of God, but this exam is asking you to provide your understanding
[00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:24.560]   of how the Holy Spirit guides Christians. Now, you have there on the first page of your handout
[00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:30.880]   a number of good resources that I would encourage you to take advantage of
[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:39.920]   under the category of biblical decision making. We have John MacArthur's Found God's Will, which is
[00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:48.800]   an excellent little book that will help you sort out this whole idea of we need to find God's will.
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:58.640]   MacArthur's statement in that book is that God's will is not mysterious. It is not confusing.
[00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:07.440]   It does not so much need to be found. The Scripture does not so much call us to find
[00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:15.040]   God's will as to obey God's will or to do God's will. So, he's addressing this whole idea of
[00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:20.240]   somehow you need to find God's will as if it is something that is mysterious or hidden,
[00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:23.920]   and it's just a really good read. I would commend that to you.
[00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:31.200]   And then you have Gary Friesian's Decision Making and the Will of God. That is really
[00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:36.240]   a foundational work that is referenced in many other biblical counseling
[00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:45.520]   works. They seem to always go back to Gary Friesian, and Friesian really laid out this thesis
[00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:55.280]   that we need to make decisions as we apply the Word of God to the situations that we face,
[00:26:55.280 --> 00:27:02.640]   not look for an extra biblical woo-woo or spiritual zap that would instantly give us
[00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:09.360]   an answer to the options that are before us. We need to do the hard work of studying
[00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:16.880]   God's Word and applying God's Word to our lives. You would think that wouldn't be
[00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:24.560]   controversial or confusing, but in our day, it is something that needs to be stated and restated.
[00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:32.560]   Then a recent published work is Kevin DeYoung's Just Do Something, a liberating approach to
[00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:39.760]   finding God's will. As with everything Kevin DeYoung has written, this is a very readable,
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:47.520]   clear articulation of the issues that arise in decision making.
[00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:56.640]   One of the things that DeYoung writes in that book is the whole idea that many of us are
[00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:04.240]   really engaged in this whole, what we call paralysis of analysis, that there are so many
[00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:12.080]   options that are before us that in some cases we become passive because we overthink or we
[00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:18.560]   are paralyzed by all of the different pros and cons of the options that are before us.
[00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:26.080]   And so he titles this work Just Do Something. What he means by that is not just do anything.
[00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:33.840]   What he means by that is within the will of God, within the moral prescriptions of God,
[00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:38.880]   you have freedom to move forward with your life and be confident that God is going to
[00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:44.800]   lead and guide you. And so just a good encouraging work that I would encourage
[00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:51.920]   you to have on your bookshelf and be acquainted with. I have used that with
[00:28:53.120 --> 00:29:00.480]   that book in counseling just to help with counselees who are just very paralyzed in
[00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:06.400]   life's decisions, who don't seem to be moving forward with life and just to encourage them to
[00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:13.520]   move forward in life and to make the tough decisions that are before them.
[00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:21.280]   And then two other works is Dave Swayze's Decisions, Decisions and then Jim Perry's Step
[00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:27.360]   by Step. I would also commend to you the three supplemental handouts that I sent to you via
[00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:34.800]   Dropbox. You have Stuart Scott's Biblical Decision-Making. You have Dave Doyle's Message
[00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:41.120]   from Kindred. He preached this in main service. It's called Wisdom or the Woo-Woo, a Theology of
[00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:47.840]   Guidance. And the audio and the video for that sermon is also available on our Kindred Church
[00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:55.520]   website and also on YouTube. If you want one sermon that's just kind of clarify the issues
[00:29:55.520 --> 00:30:02.720]   regarding biblical decision-making, I would encourage you to get Dave Doyle's Wisdom or
[00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:10.960]   the Woo-Woo. And then Jim Neuhauser's Knowing God's Will. Most of my material will be summarized from
[00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:17.200]   these other resources. And so I wanted to put those supplemental notes in your hands.
[00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:24.320]   So let's move to the next page. And with that said, let's look at the subject of the Holy Spirit
[00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:31.360]   and guidance. And I'm going to skip some of this material that's on the top of your handout. You
[00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:41.040]   can read that on your own. But move to the observations in the middle of page 2. Just some
[00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:49.040]   observations about decision-making. And this is from counseling practice and also from observations
[00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:55.440]   of the wider church. The first bullet point is that many believers do not know how to make good
[00:30:55.440 --> 00:31:07.600]   decisions. Many times you'll hear people say, "I made this decision because it felt right or it
[00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:15.040]   felt good." Some people will explain their decisions by, as I said, using the language of
[00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:24.240]   "God told me to" or "I just had a feeling." Some people tend to appeal to personal intuition.
[00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:32.960]   "I just knew that this was right." But what we're looking for in the issue of decision-making is
[00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:43.760]   this idea of here are the scriptures or here are the verses that the Holy Spirit brought to bear
[00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:53.680]   upon my thinking as I considered the course that was before me. We want to help people take the
[00:31:53.680 --> 00:32:04.320]   Word of God and apply them to the situations that they face in life. And so what we're looking for
[00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:12.240]   in an explanation of how a person makes a decision is the language of these are the scriptures or the
[00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:22.960]   verses that I was working through and seeking to apply as I chose this school or pursued this job
[00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:30.960]   or pursued this relationship and so forth and so on. Another observation we would make is that many
[00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:38.960]   believers live in regret from past decisions. And you'll find this in counseling ministry, just this
[00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:49.280]   prominent theme of regret, regret over if I had only chosen a different career or if I had only
[00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:55.440]   made a different business decision, if I had only had different priorities when I raised my children,
[00:32:55.440 --> 00:33:04.240]   the theme of regret usually surrounding some decision that the believer was a part of. And
[00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:12.080]   we want to be very sympathetic with that and show compassion. I have regrets over decisions that I've
[00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:21.120]   made in my life, in the past. I'm sure that all of us have decisions that we believe from this
[00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:27.520]   vantage point should have been made differently if we could only do it over. And so we all
[00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:36.480]   wrestle with this issue of regret. But I hope you will find that as we look at the issue of God's
[00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:46.000]   sovereign will in relation to his moral will, that we can, even as we look back and see that
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:51.440]   some decisions should have been made differently, understand that all of that is part of the
[00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:59.440]   sovereign will of God for our lives, that God is working out for his glory. And so we need to help
[00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:07.520]   people see that God is sovereign over their lives, that he uses even bad decisions as part of his
[00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:16.720]   perfect plan for their lives. A third bullet point would be that passivity and paralysis can result
[00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:30.240]   from an unbiblical view of guidance. This really is something that we do see in counseling ministry.
[00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:38.800]   Dr. Stuart Scott was my advisor in seminary, as I mentioned, and Dr. Scott did his own doctoral
[00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:47.280]   work on the subject of biblical decision-making. And he uses the story of ordering a hamburger
[00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:57.200]   in Los Angeles as an illustration of the analysis of paralysis that can result by having too many
[00:34:57.200 --> 00:35:04.960]   options. And I don't know which hamburger joint he went to. I actually would like to know. I'd
[00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:12.320]   like to visit this hamburger joint, but he says that he went to this hamburger place in Los Angeles
[00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:18.240]   and he was asked the following questions. Do you want turkey or beef?
[00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:25.440]   Do you want a third of a pound, two thirds of a pound, or full pound of meat?
[00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:32.800]   Do you want cheese? And there were 10 different varieties of cheese to choose from.
[00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:39.200]   Do you want toppings? And on this particular hamburger, you could choose
[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:46.480]   up to four toppings on your hamburger. And then there were 18 different choices of toppings that
[00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:53.280]   you could choose from. So four out of the 18, you can imagine the paralysis of analysis that happens
[00:35:53.280 --> 00:36:02.800]   as you look at this menu. And then he says there were another 10 premium toppings. And if
[00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:08.640]   you get out of that one and finally decide which toppings you want on your hamburger, he says
[00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:17.840]   that the next question was, do you want sauce? And there were 18 different kinds of sauces.
[00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:23.520]   And finally, when you think you're done, you're finally going to get a hamburger, you have to make
[00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:30.080]   a decision on what kind of bun would you like all of this on. And there was English muffin,
[00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:37.520]   honey wheat, and so forth, and so on. Now, as I said, I would actually like to go to this hamburger
[00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:47.840]   joint because you can make an entire evening of this hamburger. But Dr. Scott, looking at all of
[00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:57.760]   the options for eating a hamburger says, I developed the paralysis of analysis and I understand what
[00:36:57.760 --> 00:37:03.520]   he's saying there. And that's an illustration that can be compared to life. Sometimes there's just so
[00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:10.960]   many options. There are just so many different ways to go that the believer becomes passive
[00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:19.520]   as he or she looks at all of these different options. And there can be fear and anxiety
[00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:25.360]   attached to that passivity. What if I make a wrong choice? What if I ruin my life? What if I go down
[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:33.760]   this road and it turns out to be not God's plan for my life? And there is this idea, this false
[00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:43.200]   theological idea that somehow God has this perfect plan for your life. It's plan A, and it includes
[00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:48.720]   exactly the right school, exactly the right job, exactly the right spouse, exactly the right
[00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:56.480]   children. And your job, your responsibility as a believer is you have to find out what that plan A
[00:37:56.480 --> 00:38:07.280]   is. And some believers wrestle with this idea of what if I make a wrong decision and I miss out on
[00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:13.680]   plan A for my life and I go down the wrong path, I choose the wrong school, which leads me to the
[00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:20.080]   wrong spouse, which leads me to the wrong job, which leads me to the wrong plan for my life,
[00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:28.000]   and I end up on plan B instead of plan A, and I miss God's best for my life.
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:36.240]   That's the sort of thinking that goes into this paralysis. You can imagine trying to make a choice
[00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:40.000]   on what school to go to, and you're just paralyzed because you're saying, "What if I miss
[00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:49.280]   the plan that God had for my life and make a wrong decision here?" And so you do find believers can
[00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:57.280]   be paralyzed when they come to certain decisions that they make. And then a practical point on
[00:38:57.280 --> 00:39:06.960]   counseling ministry, that many counselees do come for counseling wanting to know what God's will
[00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:14.720]   is for their lives. So let me ask you as counselors in training, if a counselee were to come to you
[00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:23.200]   and say this, "I'm trying to find God's will for my career or for my schooling or for my job
[00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:30.880]   or for my dating relationship," how would you help that counselee find God's will?
[00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:37.360]   And the purpose of writing this essay is we want to affirm and train counselors
[00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:45.920]   who, when sitting with a counselee asking that question, would not be trying to find the woo-woo,
[00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:53.680]   or they would not be counseling the believer, the counselee, to seek the woo-woo.
[00:39:53.680 --> 00:40:00.400]   But we want counselors who would be able to sit with a counselee and say, "Look, you're dealing
[00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:08.560]   with this very difficult issue, and you're trying to make a good decision on a very practical topic,
[00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:16.960]   and I want to help you apply the principles of God's word to your situation
[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:26.880]   so that we can be assured that the Holy Spirit is leading you through His word as you consider
[00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:33.280]   the options that are before you." So we don't want counselors to say
[00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:39.600]   to counselees, "Seek the woo-woo," and we especially don't want counselors to say,
[00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:47.680]   "I will seek the woo-woo for you." You do see that in church life where some people will
[00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:51.920]   actually take it upon themselves to seek the woo-woo on behalf of someone else,
[00:40:53.360 --> 00:41:00.000]   that this person is trying to decide, you know, which person should I date? And someone in the
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:08.160]   church says, "Well, I've received the confirmation from the Lord on your behalf that you should date
[00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:15.200]   this person or that person." And all of that is not really what we want our counselors to do.
[00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:21.920]   We want our counselors to sit with other people and open their Bibles and take the principles
[00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:29.120]   of God's word and apply them to the situation, recognize that the word of God does not directly,
[00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:37.920]   specifically address every situation in life. The word of God does not tell me to
[00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:45.840]   buy a Honda instead of a Mazda. The word of God does not tell me directly to homeschool or to
[00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:51.760]   private school or to public school, but we want counselors to sit with our counselees, open the
[00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:59.680]   Bible, and bring out general principles that can be applied to the situation, and then entrust that
[00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:06.800]   the Holy Spirit will use the word to guide that believer as that believer makes decisions in life.
[00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:14.080]   So this is a very practical counseling issue that you will want to be equipped for as you
[00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:22.640]   enter into counseling ministry. So let me move to the foundations of this study, and I'm going to
[00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:30.480]   move fairly briefly here, but I hope you get the overview of what we are teaching on this subject.
[00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:40.640]   Some key definitions, and the first definition is God's sovereign will, God's sovereign will,
[00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:49.120]   and we're going to distinguish this from God's moral will. God's sovereign will is God's universe
[00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:57.120]   embracing plan, which always comes to pass, and you can circle that word always. God's sovereign will
[00:42:57.120 --> 00:43:07.760]   always comes to pass and embraces every event in all of human history. A number of passages
[00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:15.120]   on your handout. I'm going to jump down to Ephesians 1 verse 11, which says that in him,
[00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:24.320]   that is in Christ, we have obtained inheritance having been predestined according to the purpose
[00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:34.400]   of him. That word purpose means a plan or a program. It refers to the purpose that God
[00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:43.440]   determined in eternity past, which embraces all of human history and the history of the universe.
[00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:52.480]   It is God's great and grand purpose, his program for the created order. Paul says we have been
[00:43:52.480 --> 00:44:02.720]   predestined according to that purpose of him who works. The Greek word is energeo, who energetically
[00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:14.640]   actively works all things according to the counsel of his will. So this idea of God's purpose
[00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:22.160]   determined in eternity past, which God is working out through the course of human history, refers to
[00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:31.040]   his universe embracing plan, which always comes to pass. Nothing will thwart God's purpose being
[00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:36.480]   fulfilled in the course of human history and in our lives. This is what we refer to as God's
[00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:45.360]   sovereign will. God's sovereign will. Some theologians refer to this as God's decretive
[00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:54.400]   will, referring to the decree that God has made in eternity past. This is the confidence of the
[00:44:54.400 --> 00:45:01.600]   believer. Romans 8 verse 28 says we know that for those who love God, all things, all of human
[00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:08.880]   history, every circumstance in our lives, every trial, every heartache, every detail of our lives,
[00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:17.440]   all things, Paul says, work together for good to those who are called according to his purpose.
[00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:23.840]   So the idea here is that this universe embracing plan, which always comes to pass because it is
[00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:33.040]   rooted in God's eternal decree in eternity past, always works for the good of those who love God
[00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:42.880]   and those who are called according to his purpose. As believers, we rejoice in God's sovereign will.
[00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:52.880]   Now just some observations about God's sovereign will. Bullet point is that God's sovereign will
[00:45:53.680 --> 00:46:01.600]   includes violations of his moral will. God's sovereign will includes violations of his
[00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:09.520]   moral will. God's moral will is essentially his commandments, the principles that God has
[00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:18.320]   revealed in his word. You can disobey God's commandments and be outside of his moral will,
[00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:27.040]   but you will never be outside of God's sovereign will. So let me give you an illustration of this,
[00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:34.240]   and hopefully this will make sense. I think you can kind of picture this as God's sovereign will
[00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:42.720]   being a larger circle or a larger oval, and then God's moral will being inside of God's sovereign
[00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:51.440]   will. God's moral will refers to his commandments or his precepts, what God has commanded for us
[00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:59.040]   to obey as a reflection of his holiness and righteousness. And God's sovereign will,
[00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:05.040]   you recognize, is God's universe embracing plan, which includes every event in all of human
[00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:16.960]   history. And so you can be outside of God's moral will. You can disobey God. You can disobey his
[00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:24.800]   commandments. But even when you disobey God, you will never be outside of God's sovereign will.
[00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:33.120]   So maybe we could point it this way, that you can sin. Being outside of God's moral will is simply
[00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:43.280]   sin. But even when you sin, you are still inside of God's sovereign will. Disobeying God's
[00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:49.920]   commandments does not mean that you have thwarted God's plan. It does not mean that you in any way
[00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:57.840]   have made his plan unworkable, that God is saying in heaven, "Oh no, Dan sinned, and so I don't know
[00:47:57.840 --> 00:48:02.480]   what to do. I don't know how I'm going to work out my sovereign will that I determined in eternity
[00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:11.680]   past." It does not thwart God's sovereign will or his plan from taking place. Even when you and I
[00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:19.120]   are outside of God's moral will, God's sovereign will is still on track and being worked out in
[00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:25.920]   human history. An illustration of this would be in the life of Joseph, and I'll place this on
[00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:36.160]   the screen here. Genesis 50 verse 20, "Joseph said to his brothers, 'As for you, you meant evil
[00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:45.120]   against me.'" So let me ask you a question. Was Joseph's brothers outside or inside of God's
[00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:54.480]   moral will when they threw Joseph into a pit and sold him into slavery? I think you would all agree
[00:48:54.480 --> 00:49:00.800]   that Joseph's brothers were outside of his moral will. They disobeyed God. They committed evil
[00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:08.800]   against Joseph, and so in that way they sinned. They were not inside God's moral will, and yet
[00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:16.000]   Joseph says that even though you were outside of God's moral will, you meant evil against me.
[00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:23.120]   You were still inside of God's sovereign will, he says, but God meant it for good
[00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:32.800]   to bring it about that many people should be kept alive as they are today. And so even as
[00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:40.640]   Joseph's brothers committed evil against Joseph, God was sovereignly working through their evil
[00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:48.560]   to bring about good for many people. Now that is the mystery of God's sovereign will. God is
[00:49:48.560 --> 00:49:54.800]   not the author of sin. God does not tempt anyone to sin, and yet somehow in the mystery of his
[00:49:54.800 --> 00:50:02.800]   providence, God sovereignly uses even the evil and the sin of man in order to accomplish his
[00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:13.120]   good and holy purposes, which Romans 8 28 emphasizes to us are always good for God's people.
[00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:20.960]   We see that in the life of Joseph. They committed evil, and yet God sovereignly
[00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:25.920]   worked that out for good. We see this also in the cross of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:35.840]   In Acts 2 verse 23, Peter declares to the Jews, this Jesus delivered up according to the definite
[00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:45.280]   plan and foreknowledge of God, you crucified. So you sinned, you committed great evil. You were not
[00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:55.120]   within the moral will of God when you nailed Jesus to the cross. And yet in the mystery of God's
[00:50:55.120 --> 00:51:04.400]   providence, God sovereignly used the evil of the Jews in order to accomplish his good and holy
[00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:16.400]   purposes, which were to bring about salvation for sinners and grace upon grace to all the nations.
[00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:26.880]   Amazing just how God's sovereign will includes violations of his moral will. God does not sin.
[00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:33.520]   God does not tempt anyone to sin. God cannot be charged with sin. And yet God sovereignly
[00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:40.560]   uses even the sin of man to accomplish his good and holy purposes. Let me move quickly to
[00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:48.960]   the next observation is God's sovereign will is never frustrated. God is on his throne.
[00:51:48.960 --> 00:51:54.480]   God is not wringing his hands in heaven, wondering how your life and my life
[00:51:54.480 --> 00:52:04.880]   are going to turn out. God is never surprised. God is never worried. God has made a plan
[00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:14.400]   and everything is exactly on track for his plan to be completed. And it always works out for
[00:52:14.400 --> 00:52:22.480]   the good of his people. Never frustrated. Romans 9 verse 19, "For who can resist his will?"
[00:52:22.480 --> 00:52:30.880]   The answer is no one, nothing. That is why Paul can say in Romans 8 that nothing shall separate
[00:52:30.880 --> 00:52:40.080]   us from the love of God in Christ, because God's sovereign will can never be thwarted.
[00:52:40.080 --> 00:52:46.800]   So his sovereign will is never frustrated. A good word for
[00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:55.520]   those of us who may be worried about the political scene or worried about human government.
[00:52:57.360 --> 00:53:04.160]   God knows what to do with evil rulers. God knows what to do with transitions in government.
[00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:14.640]   He's not worried. He is sovereignly working all things out for our good and for his glory.
[00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:20.240]   And then number three, I think to the point of the counseling issue, is that you are never
[00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:29.600]   outside of God's sovereign will. There is no plan B for your life. So this whole idea of God has a
[00:53:29.600 --> 00:53:36.560]   plan for your life. He has a plan A. Your job is to find it. So the burden is on you to know what
[00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:40.960]   the entire plan is. And if you make a wrong decision, then you're going to mess up his plan
[00:53:40.960 --> 00:53:46.960]   for your life. Simply does not square with the teaching of scripture. There is no plan B.
[00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:54.720]   It really is a powerful thought, and one I want you to think about tonight, that your life and
[00:53:54.720 --> 00:54:05.280]   my life, exactly the way that it is today, with each trial, each situation, each circumstance,
[00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:15.280]   each relationship, is exactly what God has sovereignly ordained it to be. As you look at
[00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:22.400]   your past and you look at the course of your life, you see the unfolding of God's
[00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:31.280]   sovereign plan for your life. There is no plan B. The sovereign purpose of God is being completed
[00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:37.360]   in our day and in our time. That does not lead us to a type of determinism which says, "Well,
[00:54:37.360 --> 00:54:42.560]   God is going to accomplish his plan, so we might as well just not obey and not do anything." But
[00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:52.640]   it does give us the assurance that God has a plan and he is working it out for our good and for his
[00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:58.160]   glory. Even when you made that wrong decision, someone might say to me, a husband might say to
[00:54:58.160 --> 00:55:04.560]   me, "I made a wrong decision in marrying my wife. She was an unbeliever or she was an immature
[00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:11.440]   Christian, and I had spiritual leaders in my life who told me that I shouldn't marry her, and I did.
[00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:18.080]   I went against counsel, and I married her, and now our marriage is difficult, and it's a very
[00:55:18.080 --> 00:55:22.800]   heartbreaking situation." And that husband might look back and say,
[00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:30.480]   "This was not God's plan for my life. This was not the woman that I should have married."
[00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:38.320]   And in the sense of, your choice to marry this woman may not have been consistent with God's
[00:55:38.320 --> 00:55:46.880]   moral will for your life. But at the same time, I can say to that husband, it was part of God's
[00:55:46.880 --> 00:55:55.120]   sovereign will for your life. And even the wrong decisions, even the misguided decisions are part
[00:55:55.120 --> 00:56:01.600]   of God's sovereign will for your life that he's working out for our good and for his glory.
[00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:06.880]   And so, this understanding of God's sovereign will really addresses that
[00:56:06.880 --> 00:56:16.080]   issue. Moving quickly to God's moral will, as I stated already, if you look at the next page
[00:56:16.080 --> 00:56:22.480]   there, I think that's page four, God's moral will is found in the commands and principles which God
[00:56:22.480 --> 00:56:30.720]   has revealed in the written scriptures. Deuteronomy 29 verse 19 says, "The secret things belong to the
[00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:35.280]   Lord our God, but the things that are revealed belong to us and to our children forever,
[00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:45.200]   that we may do all the words of this law." Meaning that we will not always understand
[00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:54.480]   God's sovereign will for our lives, but we have been given God's moral will. The moral will of
[00:56:54.480 --> 00:57:02.320]   God has been given to us. We understand it. It's not mysterious. It's not confusing. God's moral
[00:57:02.320 --> 00:57:12.480]   will is clear to us. And so, if you move to this whole idea of God's moral will, we're looking at
[00:57:12.480 --> 00:57:20.240]   the commands and principles which God has revealed in the written scriptures. Now, let me explain
[00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:28.400]   this as we look at the moral will of God. I need to move you to a very important concept here.
[00:57:28.400 --> 00:57:36.400]   If you look at this diagram, and you're going to get tired of looking at this diagram,
[00:57:36.400 --> 00:57:42.320]   but I do want to show you how decision-making fits into this framework and this theological
[00:57:42.320 --> 00:57:51.760]   understanding that helps us understand the decision-making process.
[00:57:51.760 --> 00:57:57.120]   We do see that God's moral will addresses every aspect of life.
[00:57:57.120 --> 00:58:05.680]   God doesn't exactly tell us what to do in each and every given situation,
[00:58:07.280 --> 00:58:14.880]   yet God's word does apply to every given situation in life. For example, God does not tell me
[00:58:14.880 --> 00:58:22.000]   in his word, "Go home and help your wife do the dishes." That's not a verse that you're going to
[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:29.040]   find in scripture. But what God does say in his word is, "Husbands, love your wives as Christ
[00:58:29.040 --> 00:58:35.520]   loved the church." And so, if I love my wife as Christ loves the church, then surely I will be
[00:58:35.520 --> 00:58:40.880]   willing to help her do the dishes. The idea here is that God does not specifically tell me what to
[00:58:40.880 --> 00:58:48.880]   do, but God's word does address every aspect of life. As Stuart Scott has well said, sometimes
[00:58:48.880 --> 00:58:59.920]   God's word is a roadmap specific, sometimes it is a compass general. The emphasis in scripture
[00:58:59.920 --> 00:59:07.120]   is on doing God's will, not finding God's will. As I stated previously, Matthew 12,
[00:59:07.120 --> 00:59:14.320]   Ephesians 5, 1st Colossians chapter 1, all of those passages speak of doing God's will,
[00:59:14.320 --> 00:59:21.520]   understanding God's will, but you won't find in scripture this idea of God's will is this hidden,
[00:59:21.520 --> 00:59:29.920]   mysterious, confusing concept that somehow we need to strive to uncover. God's will for us
[00:59:29.920 --> 00:59:35.680]   is clear because his moral will is found in the commands of scripture.
[00:59:35.680 --> 00:59:43.360]   And then here is the very important concept that I need to emphasize. Number three is
[00:59:44.560 --> 00:59:52.720]   the principle of freedom where there is no command, God gives us freedom.
[00:59:52.720 --> 01:00:04.160]   So, within the moral will of God, there is freedom. There is freedom to make choices regarding the
[01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:12.400]   specific issues of life while staying in the moral will of God. Now, let me give you a really silly
[01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:20.400]   example, but it's actually a very practical example that I face on a regular basis. The
[01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:27.680]   question is this, the great theological question is this, should I eat at Burger King or should I
[01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:36.240]   eat at McDonald's? Now, some of you may have some biblical verses and arguments why you should eat
[01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:46.160]   at Burger King or McDonald's. I was on the East Coast last week and my host was asking this very
[01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:54.640]   important question after we got off the plane late at night, what kind of hamburger do you want?
[01:00:54.640 --> 01:01:01.040]   And I had my wife and my daughters in the car and we had to make a decision.
[01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:06.320]   What kind of hamburger do you want? He said, there's Burger King, there's McDonald's,
[01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:11.840]   and there was this place on the East Coast called Checkers, which had the tagline,
[01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:17.600]   it's crazy good. And so, we couldn't help that. I don't know if that's the woo-woo or that's,
[01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:21.120]   I'm not going to say that's the leadership of the Holy Spirit. We just saw the tagline,
[01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:29.840]   it's crazy good. And so, we said to my host, we want Checkers. But here's the decision,
[01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:36.640]   should I eat at Burger King or McDonald's? Now, would you just agree with that statement that
[01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:43.840]   within that question of what burger do you want or what hamburger should we eat,
[01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:52.240]   that there is freedom? You can eat McDonald's to the glory of God, you can eat Burger King
[01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:57.120]   to the glory of God, and you can eat Checkers to the glory of God, which we did that night
[01:01:57.760 --> 01:02:04.720]   on the East Coast. And I will say that it was crazy good, or maybe we were just hungry because
[01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:11.760]   we hadn't eaten all day after flying all day to the East Coast. But there is freedom. There is
[01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:16.800]   no Bible verse that says thou shalt eat McDonald's, thou shalt eat Burger King, thou shalt eat
[01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:24.160]   Checkers. You can stay within the moral will of God as long as you eat with thanksgiving,
[01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:30.240]   as long as you eat to the glory of God. You can stay within the moral will of God and eat Burger
[01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:39.120]   King or McDonald's or Checkers. And you get the point. Within the moral will of God, there is
[01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:45.840]   freedom to make specific decisions. Should I homeschool my children or public school my children?
[01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:53.360]   As a parent who's done both, I would say there is freedom. There is no command that says you shall
[01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:59.920]   homeschool your children. There is no command that says you shall public school your children.
[01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:07.920]   You can do both and stay within the moral will of God. Should you buy a Honda or should you buy
[01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:17.360]   a Mazda? Once again, you have freedom to make specific choices as long as you are submitting
[01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:25.520]   to the general principles of scripture. And there are many passages there that speak to this issue.
[01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:31.600]   Genesis 2, verse 16, "The Lord God commanded the man saying, 'You may surely eat of every tree of
[01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:38.640]   the garden, but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat.'" And people say
[01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:45.840]   God is so restrictive because he said, "You shall not eat of this particular tree." But did you get
[01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:52.880]   the other statement that God said to Adam and Eve? He said, "You may surely eat of every tree
[01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:59.280]   of the garden." So as long as you are obeying this command not to eat of one particular tree,
[01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:08.400]   you have freedom. You can eat of every tree of the garden. Now that's the principle of freedom.
[01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:13.680]   You can stay within the moral will of God and you can eat of many different kinds of trees.
[01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:21.440]   There is freedom. Paul says in 1 Corinthians 10, verse 23, "All things are lawful,
[01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:28.880]   but not all things are helpful. All things are lawful, but not all things build up." Paul means
[01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:38.240]   there that all things are lawful, which have not been declared unlawful by the word of God.
[01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:46.240]   Paul acknowledges that there is this realm of Christian freedom, and yet he says that we are
[01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:51.840]   to use our freedom to build other believers up. You don't just say, "Well, I'm free, so I'm going
[01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:58.320]   to do whatever I want," Paul says. Even though you understand that all things are lawful,
[01:04:58.320 --> 01:05:06.000]   you also have to understand that not all things build up. And so use your freedom to serve one
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:15.520]   another and to build one another up. And that is a very important concept. Okay, so with that
[01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:20.880]   concept in place, and you can review the notes and also look at this diagram. If you understand
[01:05:20.880 --> 01:05:26.160]   the conceptual idea of this diagram that you have God's sovereign will, which you're always in,
[01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:31.920]   you have God's moral will, which is the commands of God in scripture. And then within the moral
[01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:38.880]   will of God, you have freedom to make certain specific choices and decisions in life. The
[01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:45.840]   question is this, "How does the Holy Spirit guide believers in Christ?" And I'm going to make a
[01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:52.880]   couple points here and draw this to a close. As I said, the thesis of this teaching is that the
[01:05:52.880 --> 01:06:00.800]   Holy Spirit guides believers through His all-sufficient word. The Holy Spirit guides
[01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:09.040]   believers through, not apart from, His written word. In other words, you and I will experience
[01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:16.880]   the guiding ministry of the Holy Spirit as we study and apply the principles of His word to
[01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:25.440]   the specific issues we face in everyday life. The question is, "Should I eat at McDonald's or
[01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:36.080]   should I eat at Burger King?" And in general, you have the principle of freedom, except I'm married
[01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:43.920]   to a wife who happens to not like Burger King as much as she likes McDonald's, even though I like
[01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:52.960]   Burger King. She has a preference toward McDonald's. I also have a daughter who really happens to love
[01:06:52.960 --> 01:07:01.520]   the Chicken McNuggets at McDonald's. So when I'm faced in that situation with a car, with my wife
[01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:08.720]   and my daughter in my car, I have to apply scripture. And I have to apply the biblical
[01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:16.640]   principles of love and servanthood and preferring one another above myself in Philippians 2 verses
[01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:24.480]   1-4, considering the issues of others more important than yourself. And those principles
[01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:33.680]   of scripture will guide me to make a decision, most likely in that setting, to drive my daughter
[01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:40.640]   and my wife to McDonald's and not to Burger King. That's a simple example, but I hope you will see
[01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:48.320]   that biblical principles do apply even to the smaller decisions that we make.
[01:07:48.320 --> 01:07:56.320]   This is not the Holy Spirit giving me a woo-woo. This is not the Holy Spirit giving me a direct
[01:07:56.320 --> 01:08:02.320]   zap. This is not me waking up in a night saying, "I saw the golden arches, and I know that it's
[01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:09.760]   God's will for me to take my daughter to McDonald's and not Burger King." This is me thinking through
[01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:16.960]   the biblical principles. Serve one another. Prefer one another. If my wife and my daughter
[01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:23.760]   like a certain preference, then I should seek to serve them. It is as I consider
[01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:33.120]   what the Word of God teaches that the Holy Spirit guides me to make decisions in life.
[01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:42.880]   And I'm just taking scripture and applying God's Word to the decisions that I face. And I'm sure
[01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:49.760]   most of you would be much more impressed if I told you that I received direct word from the Lord,
[01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:55.520]   that I should eat this hamburger instead of the other, but that never happens to me.
[01:08:55.520 --> 01:09:03.840]   We don't need any additional words or revelations apart from scripture. We need to apply what God
[01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:09.520]   has already given. So what I've given you on your handout there, and I would encourage you to get
[01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:17.680]   Stuart Scott's material on this, are just some inadequate means of obtaining guidance, just ways
[01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:26.640]   that people tend to seek guidance from the Holy Spirit apart from simply reading, studying, and
[01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:34.960]   applying the written Word of God. And that can be an entire session on its own, but I want to just
[01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:40.880]   put that in your hands and ask you to think through that. Just very briefly, when people
[01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:47.680]   talk about, "Well, the Holy Spirit led me or guided me," I would just note here that the two
[01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:53.200]   clear examples of the Holy Spirit's leading in scripture, just to bring some balance to
[01:09:53.200 --> 01:10:00.720]   understanding, is Romans 8, which talks about the Holy Spirit leading us to see our adopted status
[01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:07.360]   as sons of God in Christ, and Galatians chapter 5, which talks about the Holy Spirit
[01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:15.040]   leading us to bear the fruit of the Spirit. And so a person who is saying that the Spirit
[01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:22.320]   is leading me ought to be able to say that I am praying to the Father as a child comes to
[01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:29.760]   a father whom he knows, loves the child, and embraces the child, and the Holy Spirit is
[01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:36.080]   leading me to greater sanctification. So that's the basic principle. The Holy Spirit guides
[01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:43.520]   believers through his Word. So I know you might be saying then, "What about that one little circle
[01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:50.800]   called freedom? What about those decisions that we make that are really within the confines of
[01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:57.760]   Christian freedom, and yet we do need to make those decisions? We do need to decide what school
[01:10:57.760 --> 01:11:05.280]   should I go to, or what person should I date, or who should I marry?" And there may be, you know,
[01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:10.800]   three different schools that are all within the moral will of God, and there's freedom, and yet
[01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:19.440]   you and I know that can be agonizing to decide those types of issues. And with teenagers in my
[01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:24.800]   home who are making those types of life decisions, I know that that can be very agonizing. Which
[01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:31.040]   school should I go to? All of them are lawful in the sense that they're permissible by the Lord,
[01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:39.200]   and yet still that is an agonizing decision. And so in that realm, letter B, the Holy Spirit gives
[01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:48.480]   wisdom to apply God's Word to life situation. He is called the Spirit of Wisdom and Understanding.
[01:11:48.480 --> 01:12:00.320]   The proto-deacons in Acts 6, verse 3, were full of the Spirit and of wisdom. Wisdom is the ability
[01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:06.480]   to recognize what is spiritually profitable in a given situation, and sometimes we come alongside
[01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:16.160]   counselees and we say, "You have freedom to choose this job or that job," and yet I'm going to pray
[01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:22.560]   along with the prayer in James 1, verse 5, I'm going to pray that God gives you wisdom to apply
[01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:27.840]   these principles of God's Word to your situation so that you would make the most spiritually
[01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:35.840]   advantageous decision out of all the possible options, even though all of the options are
[01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:49.440]   within God's moral will. And so some decisions have multiple options, and all of those options
[01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:56.160]   are within God's moral will. So wisdom is the ability to apply the truth of God's Word to
[01:12:56.800 --> 01:13:05.040]   a given situation. Now, my last point is this, and as you can see, I'm rushing here a little
[01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:11.440]   bit because there's so much we could say on this topic, but really I need to draw this to a close.
[01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:20.480]   The Holy Spirit leads us as we study and apply the Word of God.
[01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:28.000]   The Holy Spirit gives us wisdom to apply God's Word to life situations and within the realm of
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:35.200]   freedom to make decisions that would be most spiritually advantageous in a given situation.
[01:13:35.200 --> 01:13:41.600]   And then the last thing we would say is that the Holy Spirit, at the bottom of page 6 of
[01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:50.160]   your handout, gives us courage to make hard decisions. So I think the final thing that I
[01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:55.360]   would say on this topic is that understanding this whole topic of guidance and biblical decision
[01:13:55.360 --> 01:14:05.600]   making, someone might say, "Wow, I can't make a decision until I grow more in the Lord," or,
[01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:10.320]   "I can't make a decision until I've read Gary Friesian's book," or, "I can't make a decision
[01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:18.720]   until I've listened to Dave Doyle and Jim Uheiser on this topic. And before I get a PhD in decision
[01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:28.960]   making, I can't make decisions." And I would say that this topic and this session hopefully will
[01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:38.720]   equip you to see that you can make decisions and you should make decisions. And the Holy Spirit will
[01:14:38.720 --> 01:14:47.360]   give you His wisdom that you will make even the hard decisions, that you will search God's Word,
[01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:55.200]   that you will apply to the best of your ability, the principles of Scripture, to the decision
[01:14:55.200 --> 01:15:00.800]   that faces you, that you will obtain wise counsel. And hopefully this counsel will point you to the
[01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:07.920]   Word and not give you counsel that is apart from God's Word. And you will pray for wisdom,
[01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:17.840]   and then you will make decisions. That is to say that God guides us as we move forward in life,
[01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:26.080]   as we make decisions, and as we trust that God will sovereignly work through our decisions to
[01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:32.240]   accomplish His good and perfect plan. Even if our decisions are flawed or if they are not perfect,
[01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:39.200]   we will still trust that God will use even those decisions to accomplish His good and holy
[01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:49.920]   purposes. And the Holy Spirit gives us courage to make those hard decisions. After everything is
[01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:56.560]   said and done, after we've applied Scripture, and if we prayed, and as we sought the best ability to
[01:15:56.560 --> 01:16:03.760]   seek counsel, we will tell our counselees, "Make a decision and then entrust your life to God.
[01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:11.440]   Make a decision and trust that God will even steer you as you make another decision after
[01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:16.800]   that decision. And then you will look back on your life and you will be able to say,
[01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:25.360]   'God led me and that the Holy Spirit led me as I studied and applied His precious Word.'"
[01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:32.880]   So I trust this session was an encouragement to you. Once again, pick up Stuart Scott's
[01:16:34.240 --> 01:16:39.840]   handout on this and Jim Neuheiser's teaching on this. If you need a teaching that is one hour
[01:16:39.840 --> 01:16:45.760]   that's going to encapsulate a lot of this, get Dave Doyle's message off the Kindred website.
[01:16:45.760 --> 01:16:53.200]   And I trust that you will both be guided and led by the Holy Spirit in the practical areas of life
[01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:59.840]   and that you will be equipped to help others to seek that same guidance as well. Let me pray for
[01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:06.480]   us and we'll close our session for tonight. Father, we just thank you so much for your
[01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:12.640]   precious Word. And we thank you that the Holy Spirit leads us as we study and apply the Word
[01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:19.040]   of God. We thank you that we don't need any additional words outside of Scripture. You've
[01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:27.760]   given to us everything that we need for life and godliness. And so help us to be guided by the Holy
[01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:35.360]   Spirit as we carefully apply the principles of Scripture to the situations that are before us.
[01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:39.840]   And we pray that as we make those tough decisions,
[01:17:39.840 --> 01:17:43.840]   that we would trust that you would sovereignly work in our lives.
