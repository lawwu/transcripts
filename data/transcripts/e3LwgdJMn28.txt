[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   Do you annoy God? Do I annoy God?
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   We have kids that we love, but they often annoy us too, right?
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   So, do we annoy God? And do we annoy him to the point that he regrets ever having made us from the beginning?
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   Or does he have some sort of a low-grade regret that we exist?
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   A podcast listener named Chad just read Genesis 6-6 and writes in with the question, "Hello Pastor John,
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   Genesis 6-6, the Bible says, 'And the Lord regretted that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him to his heart.'"
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   I know that you've already done a podcast similar to this in APJ 1053, "I Know God Loves Me, But Does He Like Me?"
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   But there you didn't answer the big question that plagues my own life. Does God regret making me?
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   The devil often hits me hard with this, and I know that we're all sinful and deserve eternal death,
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   but is God, deep down, actually remorseful and resentful about his children?
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   Does he still wish that he had never made me?
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   I understand that we get to heaven not by works, but through Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior,
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   but still, I want to please God. I want to make God proud, and I hope that he doesn't regret me, even if he saved me.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   Pastor John, what would you say to Chad?
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   Okay, there are two things that I want you, Chad, to meditate on when we are finished with this Ask Pastor John.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   I'm going to comment this a little differently, perhaps, than you had thought, and maybe you'll at first think,
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   "He didn't address the question quite directly." No, I didn't, because I think there's a deeper issue,
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   and you can come back later if you want, and we can try to work on it more specifically,
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   but I've got a burden, a real strong sense that if you will take these two things that I'm going to try to unpack
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   and meditate on them, it might change everything.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   So, number one, the first thing I'd love you to take away and meditate about is the unspeakably great truth
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   that God predestined and created a people to be his children—this includes you—in order that he might enjoy
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   the beauty of their enjoyment of him forever and ever.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Secondly, I'll come back and unpack that, but secondly, and this one may be perhaps the most challenging,
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   I want you to meditate long and deep on the fact that God does not stand by watching to see if you will
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   disappoint him or annoy him, but is omnipotently at work to make you and the rest of the church
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   worthy of his enjoyment by beautifying you in holiness.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   Now, I stress both of these because both of them seem to be missing from your assumptions.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   It seems to me that you do not have a very good hold on God's purpose for why he created you and predestined you
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   to be his child, and you don't seem to have a very good hold on the way sanctification works,
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   that is, the way God is beautifying his people for his enjoyment, namely, by God's sovereign work within us,
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   not just his passive watching us become annoying or pleasing.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   Your whole vision of God and life seems to be—now, here, I could be wrong, Chad.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   If I'm wrong, sorry. This is what it seems like.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   This is what it seems is mistaken in your perception of things.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   You are independent and autonomous, and that God is passive while he watches you
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   make whatever you're going to make of yourself so that he can then be either annoyed or frustrated
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   or regretful or disappointed or pleased, and it's all up to you which way it goes.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   That whole picture, Chad, is a distortion of reality.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   It's not what the Bible teaches about God's people and his relation to them.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   So here we go. This is really, really good news, and I hope that you will spend a lot of time recalibrating,
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   if necessary, your mind around these two truths.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   So back to number one, the unspeakably great truth that God predestined and created a people
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   to be his children in order that he might enjoy the beauty of their enjoyment of him in holiness forever and ever.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   Now, let's start with Ephesians 1.5.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   He predestined us for adoption to himself as sons through Jesus Christ,
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   according to the purpose of his will, to the praise of the glory of his grace.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   So God desires and intends to have a family for himself,
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   children who would live for the praise of the glory of his grace.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   Now let that sink in. You and I, as believers in Christ, were predestined by God to be God's loved children
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   for the ultimate purpose of enjoying—because I assume that praising is a joyful act—enjoying his grace, the glory of his grace.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   So what does he ultimately want children for?
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   He wants them to receive his grace and enjoy it in praise to it in a way that shows how great he and his grace are.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   We get the joy of the receiving; he gets the glory of the giving.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   Which leads then to Ephesians 2.5 and 7.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   When we were dead in our trespasses, God made us alive together with Christ.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   So that in the coming ages—this is why he destined us, why he created us, why he made us alive—
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   so that in the coming ages he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   So he predestined us, created us, made us spiritually alive—that's what we call the new birth, conversion, new creation, coming to faith—
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   so that he might spend an eternity of ages pouring grace in kindness over us with the result that we enjoy praising his grace and he enjoys our enjoyment of him.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   Here's the way God puts it in Jeremiah 32, verse 40.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   "I will make with them an everlasting covenant, and I will not turn away from doing good to them,
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   and I will put the fear of me in their hearts that they may not turn from me."
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   So he doesn't turn from us, he doesn't let us turn from him.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   "I will rejoice in doing good to them.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   I'll plant them in this land in faithfulness with all my heart and with all my soul."
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   So God intends to have a people to love, to enjoy, to rejoice over.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   He will see to it that they are never able to turn from him.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   He will see to it that he never turns from them.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   He will always do them good, and he will do it with all his heart and with all his soul.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   Which, according to Zephaniah 317, means God will actually sing over us.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   "The Lord your God is in your midst, a mighty one who will save.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   He will rejoice over you with gladness.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   He will quiet you in his love.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   He will exult over you, Chad, with loud singing."
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   So Chad, my first point for you to meditate on is this.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   God's ultimate purpose in choosing you, predestining you, making you alive, giving you faith, adopting you,
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   keeping you infallibly for himself is that as his loved son,
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   he might enjoy the beauty of your enjoyment of him forever and ever.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   You need to think on that.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   That's why he made you.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   Now, here's the second point to meditate on, which follows from and completes the first.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   God does not stand by watching to see if you will disappoint him or annoy him,
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   but is omnipotently at work to make you and the rest of the church worthy of his enjoyment by beautifying you in holiness.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   Here's another glorious way that the new covenant promise was expressed.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   And this is where I get this point, plus many other texts.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   Ezekiel 36, verse 26, "I will give you a new heart and a new spirit I will put within you,
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   and I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   And I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and be careful to obey my rules.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   And you shall be my people and I will be your God."
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   Oh, glory.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   So God is not passively watching to see if you mess up so that he can respond with approval or annoyance
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   or disappointment or regret.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   What does he say?
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   I'll put my spirit within you and cause you, Chad.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   I'm going to cause you to walk in my statutes and be careful to obey my rules.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   So in Hebrews 13, 21, the writer says, "Now may the God of hope equip you with everything good
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   that you may do his will, working in us," catch that, "working in us that which is pleasing in his sight
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory forever and ever."
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   Indeed, glory to him forever and ever because he works in us what is pleasing in his sight.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   He doesn't just watch, wait and see if we're going to mess up and annoy him or disappoint him.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   He works in us to do his will.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   So Paul says in Ephesians 2, 9 and 10 that we are his workmanship, not ours.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   We're his workmanship created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   that we should walk in them, his, not ours.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   So what is God doing with you, Chad, and with the church?
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   What's he doing?
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   Answer, he is beautifying us for his enjoyment.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   Listen to Ephesians 5, 25.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   This is staggeringly amazing.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   "Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her that he might sanctify her so that he might
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   present the church to himself in splendor," that is, beauty, "without spot or wrinkle or any such thing
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   that she might be holy and without blemish."
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   That's why Jesus died, to make us enjoyable in holiness as we enjoy God, above all things.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   God intends to have a family, a bride for his Son, and a family for himself whom he himself will
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   make beautiful for his own enjoyment, of our enjoyment, of him in holiness.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   To this end, he chose us, he predestined us, he created us, he called us, he made us alive,
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   he gave us faith, he adopted us, and he is at work in us, and he will keep us until there is a splendid,
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   beautiful family whose greatest joy is God himself, so that God can rejoice in our holy joy in him.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   Chad, meditate on these two unspeakably great acts of God on your behalf.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   If you see this and embrace this and rejoice in this, I think everything will change.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   That's really good. Thank you, Pastor John. And thanks for the question, Chad.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   Chad mentioned at the beginning, APJ 1053, an episode titled, "I Know God Loves Me, But Does He Like Me?"
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   It's a really good one, too, to think about if this episode intrigues you.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   You can find that episode, number 1053, in our podcast archive at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   I'm Tony Reinke. We plan to be back on Monday with a new episode, and I have no idea what we're going to be talking about.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   But we'll be back, Lord willing, we'll be back on Monday with Pastor John in studio.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   We'll see you then.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   [end]
