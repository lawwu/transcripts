[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.640]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai and I'm doing this podcast from Sonoma Valley.
[00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:12.840]   I'm here at a friend's place and finally, finally taking our first family vacation.
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.720]   And I gotta admit, it's so far so good.
[00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:22.160]   Our son is about 18 months old now and we waited this long because, well, we were just
[00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.840]   kind of wussies as parents, frankly.
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.080]   We were just, you know, wanted to just stay home, didn't want to deal with the hassle,
[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.260]   the packing.
[00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.680]   We definitely didn't want to get on a flight.
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.960]   So we said, well, let's do a staycation for as long as possible until he starts sleeping
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:37.960]   well.
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.480]   And so now he's sleeping a little bit better now.
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.040]   He can sleep like 8 to 10 hours through the night, most of the time.
[00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.080]   And we thought if we can drive up to Sonoma or Napa, it's only about an hour to hour 15,
[00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.560]   hour 30 minutes away.
[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.480]   We could drive during his nap time and all will be good and so far so good.
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.880]   So the next trip will be Tahoe and then, maybe after 2 years old, we'll take a flight to
[00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.040]   Hawaii.
[00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.780]   So in this podcast, I want to talk about a fun topic which is wedding spending rules
[00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.280]   to follow if you don't want to end up broke and alone.
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.980]   So I'm going to my friend's wedding in November and I know it's going to be an amazing wedding.
[00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:19.400]   So it just got me thinking about how much the average American should spend on a wedding.
[00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.900]   Did you know that the average cost in America for a wedding is around $33,000 according
[00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.120]   to the Knotts 2017 wedding survey?
[00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:33.800]   If you live in Manhattan, the average spend is closer to $77,000.
[00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:39.340]   In comparison, San Francisco weddings are only about $39,329.
[00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:44.800]   So I'm telling you folks, San Francisco is not as expensive as folks make it out to be
[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:45.800]   compared to Manhattan.
[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.140]   Manhattan is way more expensive than San Francisco.
[00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.560]   So with the median household income in America at around $60,000 according to the US Census
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:00.000]   Bureau, what is going on with couples who are willing to spend roughly 70% of their
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.720]   annual after-tax income on such ephemeral pleasure?
[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:10.160]   So I went ahead and asked some readers and asked some random folks who have spent $33,000
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.280]   or more on their weddings to hear what they had to say.
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.580]   Here were some of their responses.
[00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.000]   One woman said, "I wanted a night we'd never forget."
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.180]   Well don't we all.
[00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.560]   Another guy said, "The wedding is more for our family than it is for us.
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.120]   We both have huge extended families that must all be invited."
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.000]   Another woman said, "Everything from the venue to the flowers costs so much nowadays.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.440]   It's hard to spend less."
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.120]   A guy said, "I already spent $18,000 on a ring.
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.480]   What's another $50,000 spread among 200 people?"
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.700]   That's a good point.
[00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.040]   And finally, here's my favorite response from a guy.
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.100]   "I didn't want to spend $300,000 on a wedding.
[00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.180]   My wife did.
[00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.520]   I hate weddings and would rather have just gone to City Hall for a couple hundred bucks.
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:01.200]   It's all curated and fake for thirsty Instagram users."
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.640]   Well said.
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.920]   So given I came up with the engagement buying rules, thousands of lovebirds have followed
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:08.920]   since 2010.
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:14.280]   If you Google "engagement buying ring rules" you'll see Financial Samurai's article up
[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.280]   top.
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.800]   It's only appropriate I come up with wedding spending rules for financial freedom.
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.440]   Controlling wedding costs is arguably much more important than overspending on an engagement
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:29.040]   ring because at least with the engagement ring it can be reused or resold.
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.040]   You won't get the price you paid but you'll get something.
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.280]   Whereas a wedding you don't get anything.
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:40.680]   I'm certain that if you follow my wedding spending rules your marriage will last longer
[00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:46.420]   and you'll have more wealth than if you spend what the average American spends on a wedding.
[00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.760]   And if for some reason your marriage ends before the average duration of 8 years or
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.980]   you end up having a lower household net worth for your age than the average, then you can
[00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.080]   simply blame each other for all your mistakes.
[00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.000]   So here are 5 wedding spending rules to follow.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   1.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.880]   Spend no more than 1% of your newly combined household income.
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:13.600]   So if he makes $60,000 and she makes $80,000 then they should spend no more than $1,400
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:14.600]   on a wedding.
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:19.440]   If their newly combined household income is $1,000,000 then they can ball out on a $10,000
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:20.440]   wedding.
[00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.400]   Only when the couple starts earning $3,000,000 or more should they come close to spending
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:34.480]   what the average American spends on a wedding.
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:39.000]   You can see from the chart in the post the real median household income in America is
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   around $60,000.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.560]   We've just now surpassed our 1999 highs.
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.320]   That's almost 20 years of no income growth.
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.760]   Therefore if the typical American follows my 1% rule, they should limit their wedding
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.720]   cost to roughly $600.
[00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:00.880]   Casual weddings in your backyard are not only intimate, but cost effective.
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.240]   2.
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:08.600]   Spend no more than 1% of the value of your combined pre-tax retirement plans.
[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:14.880]   So everything starts with I think savings and contributing to your 401k and IRA and
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:15.880]   so forth.
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.440]   It's the easiest thing everybody can do to save for retirement.
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:26.440]   So let's say at age 30 she has a financial samurai recommended $150,000 in her 401k and
[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:31.720]   at 35 he has a financial samurai recommended $300,000 in his 401k.
[00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.740]   This couple can spend up to $4,500 on a wedding.
[00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:39.900]   By drawing the couple's attention to their retirement savings plans, there will be a
[00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:44.680]   natural tendency to spend less given spending more means a later retirement.
[00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:49.700]   The more you hate your job, the less you will end up spending on a wedding as a result.
[00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:56.240]   The third rule, spend no more than 50% of your combined side hustle gross income.
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:01.680]   Let's say the couple has a combined W-2 gross income of $120,000, so that's day job income,
[00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.660]   but also makes $20,000 selling t-shirts and trinkets online.
[00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:11.080]   The couple can now spend up to $10,000 on their wedding, but I bet they won't because
[00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:15.720]   everybody who side hustles knows how exhausting it can be to make extra money outside of their
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:16.720]   day job.
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.360]   And why are people side hustling?
[00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:22.760]   They're side hustling because they want to retire early and live a life of freedom, but
[00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:23.960]   they do have the green light.
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.760]   They do have the green light to spend $10,000 because they can.
[00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:32.160]   They're so far ahead of everyone else who just relies on only one source of income to
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:33.160]   survive.
[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:37.760]   I think that's one of the biggest mistakes Americans, human beings have who really want
[00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.640]   to achieve financial freedom.
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:41.120]   Just relying on your job is a no-no.
[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:47.480]   Four, spend no more than 10% of your annual passive income.
[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:52.160]   Side hustle income requires work, so the next step is to build passive income because it
[00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:55.840]   requires little to no work at all once the investments are made.
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:01.120]   And that's why I encourage everyone to build their after-tax investments beyond their pre-tax
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.660]   retirement accounts.
[00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:07.200]   If the couple happens to save and invest aggressively for 10 years to generate $30,000 in annual
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:11.240]   passive income, they're free to spend $3,000 on a wedding.
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:16.880]   My guess is they won't, or maybe they will, because they didn't start generating passive
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:17.880]   income for a wedding.
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:22.040]   They started generating passive income to one day be free, so it really is a little
[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.120]   bit painful.
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:25.900]   But $3,000 is not that much for a wedding.
[00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:28.800]   It's pretty reasonable depending on your wedding-size party.
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:33.300]   And as a gut check, I'd be willing to spend up to $20,000 a year on a wedding based on
[00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:38.480]   my current passive income of about $200,000 that took 19 years to build.
[00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:42.440]   I'm 41 now, she's 38 now.
[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:45.600]   Could we spend $20,000 for our friends and family?
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:52.880]   I think we could, but man, I think I'd rather just spend like $5,000 on a great dinner party,
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:58.260]   do some speeches, some drinks, I don't know, maybe like 50 of our closest friends and family,
[00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:03.640]   and then just save and invest the remaining $15,000 or donate it to people who actually
[00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:04.960]   need the money.
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:08.320]   Alright, so five.
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:11.800]   Spend no more than $1,000 per year you've known each other.
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:16.120]   Or you can do $1,000 per year for as long as you've been dating.
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:21.280]   So if you guys started dating in college at 21 and decided to get married 7 years later,
[00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:25.140]   well, maybe you guys can spend up to $7,000 on a wedding.
[00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:27.320]   It's a pretty easy rule.
[00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:33.080]   Let's say you guys started off as workplace friends at age 25 and then you married other
[00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:38.320]   people, you got divorced and decided 20 years later you were always meant to be together,
[00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:42.280]   then spending up to let's say $20,000 is more digestible.
[00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:46.800]   When you've already gone through the ringer once, you presumably, you should have a better
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:52.120]   idea of what you want with your superior earnings power in your early to mid 40s.
[00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:57.280]   And by then you probably won't want to spend $20,000 because you have less people to impress.
[00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:03.400]   Or, I guess maybe you will spend happily $20,000 because you're just YOLOing life and your
[00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:08.480]   midlife crisis and you know, you understand your morality and mortality.
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:10.080]   Every case is different.
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:14.240]   And finally, I've got this great, great rule.
[00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:19.400]   This is a bonus rule that I think maybe many people, many people take advantage of.
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:23.440]   Feel free to spend as much as your respective parents want to spend.
[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:27.280]   If a couple is lucky enough to have wealthy parents who love them so much to cover all
[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:33.040]   their costs of their wedding, then they should go right ahead and accept their generosity.
[00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:36.960]   And if it turns out the newlyweds accepted their respective parents' help in spite of
[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:41.480]   the fact their parents are financially struggling, then the married couple will simply have to
[00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:45.360]   take care of them financially for the rest of their lives.
[00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:46.520]   It's interesting.
[00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:51.240]   I've always taken the view that as adult children, we should actively try to give back to our
[00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:56.680]   parents, not take from our parents after they spent 18 years taking care of us.
[00:09:56.680 --> 00:10:03.640]   You know, I'm only like 18 months into being a father and man, it is hard work.
[00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:04.640]   It's so hard.
[00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:08.680]   It's so hard that I'm already thinking about taking a vacation and going back to work.
[00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:09.680]   That's how hard it is.
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:10.680]   Think about it.
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:14.040]   So many people just want to leave work to, you know, just chill out and maybe be parents.
[00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:18.860]   But I'm telling you folks, being a stay at home dad is a tremendous amount of work.
[00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:21.720]   And also, you know, I'm writing and I'm doing this podcast.
[00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:23.720]   So there's always something to do.
[00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:29.040]   And if my son doesn't insist on being a man and paying for his own wedding when he's,
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:35.600]   I don't know, 28, 30, 35, whatever the age he gets married is, I'm going to send him
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:36.600]   this post.
[00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:42.320]   I'm going to send him this podcast and say, hey, buddy, I think it's important to pay
[00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:46.200]   your own way because you're an adult now.
[00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:47.200]   You're a man now.
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:48.200]   I'll be there for you.
[00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:49.200]   I'll always love you.
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.920]   I'll support you.
[00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:55.720]   But when it comes to your own relationship and spending money on a probably six hour
[00:10:55.720 --> 00:11:02.120]   to seven hour event, I don't think spending thousands and tens of thousands of dollars
[00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:05.640]   on a wedding is a good idea, son.
[00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:09.440]   So you're obviously free to spend more money on your marriage if you want to, especially
[00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:10.960]   if you're rich.
[00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:14.860]   But spending 33,000 for a wedding is truly a ridiculous amount for the average American
[00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:20.520]   household who only earns about 60,000 a year in 2018.
[00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:26.080]   You know, I guess a lot of parents pay for the wedding and hopefully they can afford
[00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:32.760]   it because if you are a parent in your 60s, 70s, yes, it's going to be a proud moment.
[00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:38.000]   I know I'm going to be so proud if and when my son gets married and finds the love of
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   his life.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.760]   Maybe I'll just open my wallet and pay for everything, but I'd like to see some skin
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:44.760]   in the game.
[00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:49.240]   I'd like to see some rational thinking because at the end of the day, I am a finance oriented
[00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:50.240]   person.
[00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:53.520]   I write a personal finance site and I have a personal finance podcast.
[00:11:53.520 --> 00:12:01.400]   If you annualize the cost of the wedding, the cost is $12,045,000.
[00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:03.800]   And you're asking, "What am I talking about?"
[00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:04.800]   Well, simple.
[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:07.640]   $33,000 is the average cost of the wedding.
[00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:12.760]   Times that by 365 days, that's an annualized cost of $12,000,000.
[00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:15.720]   And goodness forbid something bad happens at the wedding.
[00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:21.280]   I went to one wedding and this guy on the dance floor spilt red wine on the bride's
[00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:23.520]   couture dress.
[00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:26.000]   That was an awkward, sad moment.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.220]   She started crying.
[00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:33.160]   Goodness forbid a drunk friend gives a terrible speech in front of everyone.
[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:37.440]   And goodness forbid thunderstorms wash out the outdoor venue.
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:40.480]   Everybody's got to go from outside to inside, right?
[00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:42.280]   That would be not so good.
[00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:45.440]   So if your wedding isn't perfect, then you're really going to be upset.
[00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:51.080]   Divorce rates are about 46 to 50% in the United States and Australia.
[00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:56.160]   Only Sweden surpasses the United States in terms of divorce rate at 55%.
[00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:58.720]   And then conversely, it's interesting.
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:04.760]   Only Italy, well not only, Italy, Spain, Singapore, Poland, Greece, they all have divorce rates
[00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:06.480]   at 18% or less.
[00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:08.720]   So I wonder what's going on there.
[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:12.720]   If you follow at least one of my wedding spending rules, you'll be able to get your marriage
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:15.260]   off to a great financial start.
[00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:20.800]   Not only can you use the money saved to buy a house, make your future child a 529 millionaire
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:26.160]   if you want, or bolster up your respective retirement accounts, you'll likely have much
[00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:30.860]   less fights, money fights to begin with because you'll have more of it.
[00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:34.560]   As I review my wedding spending rules, I gave five.
[00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:37.920]   I gave five to give some kind of variety.
[00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:40.720]   But my favorite is number two.
[00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:47.080]   Spend no more than 1% of your combined pre-tax retirement accounts on a wedding.
[00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:52.720]   Based on this rule, the average responsible American couple should spend between $2,000
[00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:55.760]   to $3,000 on their wedding and that's it.
[00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:59.920]   Not $33,000 crazy dollars.
[00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:07.440]   In case you're wondering, we spent about $3,000 on our wedding in 2008 and we have no regrets.
[00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:12.880]   That $3,000 included the cost of two round trip tickets to Hawaii, the beach ceremony,
[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:18.480]   and the wedding banquet for 16 people at our favorite all you can eat Korean barbecue place.
[00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:24.200]   We decided to invest the $50,000 we were thinking of spending on various investments instead
[00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:32.120]   and that money has since grown to about $150,000 and it has grown to generate passive income.
[00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:37.240]   So folks, please, please follow these wedding spending rules if you're thinking about getting
[00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:38.240]   married.
[00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:40.880]   Get your marriage off to a great start.
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:44.200]   It's going to be a great time no matter how much you spend because you're going to spend
[00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:49.600]   time with your friends and family and that's what matters at the end of the day.
