[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.040]   Welcome back to the Ask Pastor John podcast. On Friday, Pastor John, we talked about how
[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:14.000]   you write books, which is a really interesting episode. And this week we're going to talk
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.200]   about preaching to celebrate your new book on preaching titled Expository Exaltation.
[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:25.040]   And today's question is a question from a preacher named Brad. "Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:30.520]   How do you define expositional preaching? I ask because many preachers in my neck of
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.760]   the woods, to them, expositional preaching is opening the Bible, reading a text, and
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.080]   then proceeding to say a lot of true things about that text. While this approach is certainly
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.760]   better than many alternatives, often what seems to be missed is the main point of the
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:52.800]   text. Thus, God's agenda in the text is sometimes lost for what the preacher finds most interesting,
[00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.840]   curious, or personally uplifting. What would you say to preachers and to congregants looking
[00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.400]   for expositional preaching? What exactly is it?"
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:09.640]   Well, I totally agree with Brad. If you don't tell people the main point the author, the
[00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:17.320]   biblical author, is trying to communicate in the text, you're not doing faithful exposition,
[00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:23.400]   no matter how many good things you say about the text, no matter how many interesting things
[00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:29.840]   or true things or how much application you give. Exposition, so here's my definition,
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:39.040]   exposition is communicating to people what the biblical author was trying to communicate
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:47.680]   through his inspired words. But I want to hasten to say that in my new book, Expository
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:57.120]   Exaltation, I go way beyond that definition of exposition, because I think many young
[00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:03.740]   preachers, and probably older ones as well, get the idea that in exposition we are dealing
[00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:11.200]   mainly with getting ideas from the biblical author's head into the head of those who
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:17.520]   are listening to the preaching. So when I use the language of finding the author's
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:26.560]   intention in our exegesis and then transferring it into the minds of the listener through
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:33.260]   exposition, I can give the impression that the main task of preaching is idea transfer.
[00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:39.360]   And of course, I don't want to belittle that. Exposition can never be less than that,
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:45.840]   because there are life-changing ideas in all the chapters of the Bible, and these ideas
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:53.640]   do need to be known by Christians. But it doesn't take much reflection to realize
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:03.260]   that the intentions of the inspired writers of the Bible are never, and I repeat, never
[00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:11.160]   to simply transfer information from their minds to our minds. Their intentions are always,
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:21.300]   and I repeat, always larger than information transfer. For example, when Paul says, "Having
[00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:30.220]   been justified by faith, we have peace with God," his intention is not only that our
[00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:38.660]   minds would have some new ideas—namely, that justification is by faith, and that through
[00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:47.780]   this one can enjoy peace with God—his intention also includes that we grasp, that we see with
[00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:54.400]   the eyes of the heart, that we are moved by the wonder and the beauty and the glory of
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:03.260]   what justification is, and what faith is, and what peace is, and what God is, and not
[00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:14.340]   only know what all those words mean but taste what all those realities are so that the reality
[00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:22.820]   behind the words becomes an experience of our whole being. That's part of their intention.
[00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:35.460]   And if this is true, then exposition can never, and I repeat, never be content with idea transfer.
[00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:44.180]   So when I define exposition as communicating to people what the biblical author was trying
[00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:52.300]   to communicate through his inspired words, I include in what the biblical author was
[00:04:52.300 --> 00:05:01.020]   trying to communicate not only the ideas, but the reality behind the ideas—the reality
[00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:07.780]   of God, the reality of justification, the reality of faith, the reality of experiencing
[00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:15.820]   peace with God, and the experience of those realities, the transformation that comes through
[00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:23.100]   the experience of those realities, all of which Paul certainly wanted, intended, hoped,
[00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:31.660]   prayed would happen as he wrote that sentence for the Roman Christians, which is why I define
[00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:47.060]   preaching not just as exposition but as expository exaltation. That's E-X-U-L—not A-L—E-X-U-L-T-A-T-I-O-N.
[00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:53.620]   Expository exalting, expository exaltation. It is, in my mind—I hope I don't overstate
[00:05:53.620 --> 00:06:05.220]   it—prostitution of the biblical text, to deal with it in a way that does not pray and
[00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:16.060]   seek to embody emotionally the reality behind the text, so that our people don't just
[00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:25.820]   hear ideas; they see the reality behind the ideas being experienced by the preacher.
[00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:32.700]   Let me see if I can sum it up like this. I was at a conference recently where my assignment
[00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:39.380]   was from the leaders, "Talk to us for 20 minutes about what you would do if you were
[00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:46.900]   22 again." And one of the things I wanted to say was that I would read my Bible every
[00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:52.660]   day if I was 22. I would read my Bible every day for the next 50 years. No misses. Read
[00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:56.740]   it more often than I kiss my wife, because sometimes she's not with me on a trip, but
[00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:00.420]   my Bible is always with me on a trip. So I'm sure I've read my Bible more often, more
[00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:06.300]   days than I've kissed my wife. That's really important to kiss your wife. It's more important
[00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:11.060]   to read the Bible, because otherwise you won't kiss her like you ought to kiss her. But that's
[00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:20.100]   another podcast. But since I wrote this new book on preaching, I am so keenly aware how
[00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:25.740]   many layers there are to reading your Bible every day, what that really means. I've learned
[00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:32.420]   a few things in the last 50 years since I was 22, and if I were 22 again now, the way
[00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:37.100]   I would state my Bible-reading resolution would go like this—and this is my intention
[00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:43.940]   to summarize what a preacher does with his Bible, both for his own soul and for his people.
[00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:51.900]   I resolve every day in reading my Bible to push through the haze of vague awareness to
[00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:59.220]   the very wording of the text. And I would push into and through the wording of the text
[00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:07.300]   to the intention of the author's mind, both human and divine. And I would push into and
[00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:15.380]   through that intention of the author to the reality behind all the words and grammar and
[00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:24.700]   logic. And I would push into that reality until it became an emotionally experienced
[00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:31.820]   reality, with emotions that correspond to the nature of the reality. And I would push
[00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:39.060]   into and through this proportionately emotional experience of the reality behind the text
[00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:49.260]   until it took form in word and deed in my life. And I would push through this emotionally
[00:08:49.260 --> 00:09:00.060]   charged word and deed until others saw the reality and joined me in this encounter with
[00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:09.440]   God. And really, what I was doing in describing my resolution as a 22-year-old to read my
[00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:16.900]   Bible every day, what I was doing in describing that was describing the task of the preacher
[00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:24.700]   and what I have come to see as the great and wonderful calling of expository exaltation.
[00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:30.940]   Hey, man, what a loaded episode. How to preach the Bible, yes, but working back into how
[00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:35.940]   we read the Bible. And of course, we cannot separate the right preaching of the Word from
[00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:39.980]   the right reading of the Word, and you cannot separate the reading of the Word from what
[00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:44.340]   you think the Bible is in the first place. And that makes preaching the theme of Pastor
[00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:50.700]   John's new book, Expository Exaltation, which is a capstone on his 1,000-page trilogy, which
[00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:53.140]   answers these three critical questions.
[00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:57.300]   Question number one, can we trust the Bible? And that was answered in book number one of
[00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:01.900]   the trilogy titled A Peculiar Glory. And then question number two, how should I go about
[00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:06.820]   reading the Bible to get God's meaning? That was answered in book number two, which is
[00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:10.940]   reading the Bible supernaturally. And then finally, question three, what should I expect
[00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:16.100]   from my church and my pastors when they proclaim this book to me? That is finally answered
[00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:23.300]   in book number three, now out, entitled Expository Exaltation, Christian Preaching as Worship.
[00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:28.420]   It is a beautiful hardcover with a gold foil stamped cover. It's now available. Sinclair
[00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:35.140]   Ferguson calls the book simply a must-read for every preacher of the gospel. It's high
[00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:40.820]   praise. And it's not only for pastors, but consider buying your pastor a copy of Expository
[00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:42.380]   Exaltation.
[00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:46.940]   Next time I'll ask John Piper, what is the proper place for Christian eloquence in the
[00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:53.580]   creative process in sermon making? I am your host, Tony Reinke, and I've jotted down for
[00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:58.700]   a future episode how to kiss your wife like a disciplined Bible reader. That should be
[00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:02.060]   interesting. We'll see you on Wednesday. Thanks for listening.
[00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:04.060]   [END]
[00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:06.060]   1. What is the proper place for Christian eloquence in the creative process in sermon making?
[00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:08.060]   2. What is the proper place for Christian eloquence in sermon making?
