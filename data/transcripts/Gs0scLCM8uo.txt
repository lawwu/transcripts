[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.480]   In a tragic pandemic like the one we're experiencing right now, the Book of Job becomes especially
[00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.600]   relevant to each of our lives.
[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.940]   But that book poses a significant dilemma any Bible reader has to resolve.
[00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:18.320]   It's this dilemma.
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.680]   Which characters in the Book of Job can we trust?
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.560]   Most of the book's characters say things we cannot trust.
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.200]   And the question today comes from a listener named Joel to Pastor John, who joins us over
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.200]   Skype today.
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.240]   Thank you for your wonderful podcast, Pastor John.
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.100]   I'm a long-time listener and now a first-time caller, as they say.
[00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:41.040]   In the wake of this coronavirus pandemic, I have turned repeatedly to the Book of Job.
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.760]   As you've said in past sermons, the book is timeless and therefore relevant to our present
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:46.760]   suffering.
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.360]   I've read through Job before, and I understand the cycle of conversations between Job and
[00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.360]   his friends.
[00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.960]   But I was reading through Job 5, Eliphaz is speaking, and I came to verses 17 to 19.
[00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.880]   I began to ask myself, "When Job and his friends speak of God in their ranting, how do I distinguish
[00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:08.840]   theology that's true about God from their own mistaken assumptions about God?"
[00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.240]   The obvious answer is to survey the landscape of Scripture to find consistencies with other
[00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.240]   texts.
[00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.520]   But can we put any stock in what Job or his friends are saying in the Book of Job?
[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.440]   Pastor John, how would you answer?
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:30.360]   Like the Book of Ecclesiastes, and like some of the parables of Jesus, and like the stories
[00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.600]   in the Book of Judges that describe—I just finished reading Judges this very morning
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.600]   as we're recording.
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:44.560]   Oh my goodness, what a terrible book—describing what happens when there's no king, describing
[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:45.560]   sins.
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:55.200]   And Job also, like those three, Job also narrates ways of thinking and speaking and acting which
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.080]   are sinful.
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.760]   The speeches of Eliphaz, Bildad, Zophar, and Job's involvement with them for 29 chapters
[00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:10.320]   are mingled with bad theology and good theology, and the good theology is regularly misused.
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:16.520]   In fact, I think that's one of the main points of the Book of Job, to show how good theology
[00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.720]   can become bad pastoral practice.
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:27.920]   Really, I don't think you'd spend 29 chapters on the misuse of good theology if that weren't
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.240]   part of the point.
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.080]   There's nothing unusual in all of this in principle, in the way you'd write something.
[00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:41.760]   We all tell conversations that we've had, and we tell about events we've been a part
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.040]   of, and some of the things we narrate in the conversations we disapprove of, and some of
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.640]   the things we tell about in our experiences we disapprove of, and we expect listeners,
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:59.260]   as they listen to us, to distinguish what we're narrating as disapproved and what we're
[00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.880]   narrating as approved.
[00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:07.080]   We need to give them clues; we have to help them understand which is which.
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:14.180]   So what makes Job unusual is not that the book includes ways of thinking and speaking
[00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:24.520]   which are sinful, but that the dialogue containing these errors is so lengthy, from chapter 3
[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:33.840]   through chapter 31, where Job and Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar interact for 29 chapters.
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.920]   That's unusual.
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:41.520]   So Joel's question is, is there value in these speeches?
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.240]   That's one of his questions.
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:49.560]   And how do we sort out in this book what to approve and what to disapprove of?
[00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:56.400]   How can we embrace his life lessons that God intends, and what should we chew up and spit
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.680]   out?
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:06.440]   And I think that there are five ways that God intends, as the one who inspired this
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:15.100]   book, five ways that he intends to help us be able to profit from and rightly handle
[00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.400]   and interpret the book of Job.
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.400]   So here they are.
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.720]   Number one, the inspired author.
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.160]   So not everything Job says is true, and not everything Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar says
[00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:32.440]   is true, but what the author says as the inspired writer, as his own view, that's true.
[00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:41.280]   And he intrudes himself at key points in this story to make us aware of what he's trying
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:47.200]   to say through recording all the bad stuff that are not his views.
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:55.360]   For example, all of chapters one and two, for example, are the express viewpoints of
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.600]   the inspired writer.
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:03.960]   Here's where we can lay it down with great confidence how we are to view God's sovereignty,
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:09.300]   the role of Satan, the proper response of man to suffering and to sovereignty.
[00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.080]   They're all laid out for us in the first two chapters.
[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:23.120]   And perhaps the most remarkable example of this is the writer's comment about Job's response
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:29.380]   at the end of each of Job's two tests from the devil.
[00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:35.240]   So he says, Job says in chapter one, verse 21, at the loss of his children, all 10 of
[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:43.880]   his children killed, he says, "The Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away.
[00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.800]   Blessed be the name of the Lord."
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.520]   And you might take a deep breath there and say, "Are you sure?
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:50.880]   Is that good theology?
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.240]   Should we embrace that?
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.760]   The Lord has taken away, and he's blessed?"
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:04.160]   And the inspired writer inserts precisely to help us grasp this, he inserts that Job
[00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.960]   did not misspeak.
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:06.960]   Here's what he says.
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:14.080]   "In all this, Job did not sin or charge God with wrong."
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.400]   Exactly the same thing in the next chapter.
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:21.440]   When you come to the end of the second test and Job is, God boils from the top of his
[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:27.360]   head to the bottom of his feet, and his wife says to him, "You should curse God and die."
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:34.800]   Job says, "Shall we receive good from God and not receive evil?"
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.200]   And you might stop there and say, "Job, don't talk like that.
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.120]   That's bad theology."
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:47.680]   And so the inspired writer adds, "In all this, Job did not sin with his lips."
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:54.520]   In other words, when Job affirms that good and evil, health and disease come from the
[00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:57.000]   hand of God, he's not sinning.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.120]   He's speaking the way we ought to speak.
[00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:07.000]   Here's another example of how the inspired writer inserts his divine perspective, inspired
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.720]   perspective on Job's suffering.
[00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:17.680]   In chapter 42, verse 11, looking back over the entire event and experience, he says this.
[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:20.160]   This is Job 42, 11.
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:24.440]   I think it's one of the most important verses in the book.
[00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:31.320]   Then came to Job all his brothers and sisters, and they showed him sympathy and comforted
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:37.680]   him for all the evil that the Lord had brought upon him.
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:39.580]   That's not Eliphaz talking.
[00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:41.240]   That's not Bildad talking.
[00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:42.880]   That's not Zophar talking.
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:44.700]   It's not Job talking.
[00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:52.100]   That's the inspired writer putting into words what had happened really in this book.
[00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:57.720]   So my first answer to the question, how does God help us discern how to read this book?
[00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:04.960]   The answer is he causes the voice of the inspired writer to be clear as he intrudes himself
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:07.160]   on his own narrative repeatedly.
[00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:09.760]   Here's the second thing.
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:16.400]   God intends for us to be guided in reading this book by the appearance of Elihu in chapter
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:17.920]   32.
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:24.280]   And Elihu comes, and I believe Elihu is a speaker of truth.
[00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:32.160]   I don't think Elihu is an added idiot to Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar.
[00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:36.160]   I think he speaks straight and is truth.
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:37.600]   Not everybody agrees with me here.
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:38.600]   You need to know that.
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:41.320]   A lot of people think Elihu is just another problem.
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:42.720]   I don't think that's true.
[00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:50.960]   Let me give you five quick reasons why I think Elihu should be listened to as a correct perspective
[00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:55.400]   on what has just been going on between Job and Eliphaz and Bildad and Zophar.
[00:08:55.400 --> 00:09:01.320]   Number one, he arrives on the scene, chapter 32, with a different perspective over against
[00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:04.880]   Eliphaz, Bildad, Zophar, and Job.
[00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:10.640]   Number two, the writer devotes six chapters to Elihu.
[00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:11.640]   Good night.
[00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:14.280]   That's a lot of space.
[00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:15.920]   And here's the catch.
[00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:22.120]   The misguided speeches of Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar had been getting shorter and shorter
[00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:23.600]   and shorter until the end.
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:25.340]   They had nothing more to say.
[00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:29.520]   It wouldn't make any sense in the narrator's strategy if he said, "Now I'm going to give
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:35.840]   you another jerk like Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar, and I'm going to give him six chapters,
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:39.400]   and I'm not going to say a word of criticism of him.
[00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:40.400]   No way.
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.720]   I can't buy it."
[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:49.080]   Number three, Job repents from the very things that Elihu criticizes later on in chapter
[00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:50.720]   40 and 42.
[00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:56.280]   Number four, God—and I think this is the one that tipped me off years ago when I studied
[00:09:56.280 --> 00:10:03.040]   this in more detail—God rebukes explicitly in chapter 42, verse 7.
[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:06.280]   He rebukes Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar.
[00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:09.760]   He never says a negative word about Elihu.
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:12.320]   That's just got to mean something right.
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:21.560]   Number five, Elihu really does give a different perspective on suffering than Job did.
[00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:26.640]   I just commend to you chapter 33, verses 14 to 19.
[00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:30.380]   If you want to go into detail, I preached a sermon on this very thing.
[00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:35.440]   It's called "Job Rebuked in Suffering," which you can find at Desire and God.
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:45.120]   I think Elihu, chapters 32 to 37, are given by the inspired writer to help set right some
[00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:50.000]   of the mistakes that were being made by Eliphaz, Bildad, Zophar, and Job as they were talking
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.160]   in those 29 chapters.
[00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:57.560]   Here's my third reason that I think God gives to us to help us.
[00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:04.440]   God himself speaks in chapters 38 to 41 and gives us a true perspective on his sovereignty
[00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:06.800]   and on Job's repentance.
[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:14.520]   Number four, the book closes with Job's repentance and God stepping in, and we get a glimpse
[00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:19.160]   of what the errors were that Job repented of.
[00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:24.680]   And then finally, and this is the one that Joel himself mentioned, the wider teaching
[00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:31.960]   of Scripture in the Bible functioned, rightly understood, as a kind of sieve to put the
[00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:36.280]   words of Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar, and Job through.
[00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:46.240]   All that to say, I think God has not left us without an ample help and guidance as to
[00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:54.520]   how to sort out what is true and what is not in this book, and not only how to sort out
[00:11:54.520 --> 00:12:02.160]   what is true, but also how to use it rather than to misuse it.
[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:09.680]   It is indeed the book we need right now in this season of suffering in the world to get
[00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:17.560]   our bearings and not to make some of the mistakes that Job made in reaction to God's sovereignty
[00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:18.560]   in his life.
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:19.560]   Yes, indeed.
[00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:22.240]   Very timely and urgently so.
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:26.320]   Thank you, Pastor John, for helping us better understand the book of Job.
[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:30.880]   And speaking of the pandemic, even with all the disruptions to life in this crazy year,
[00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:32.360]   ministry for us has been full throttle.
[00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:36.240]   In fact, it feels like the Lord has even given us more work to do this year in addressing
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:41.440]   the pandemic, particularly with the international launch of Pastor John's new book, Coronavirus
[00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:42.440]   in Christ.
[00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:47.080]   We're investing tens of thousands of dollars to get that timely book translated and distributed
[00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:53.760]   around the world, making it freely available in 29 different languages, and possibly even
[00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:55.800]   more to come in the near future.
[00:12:55.800 --> 00:13:01.040]   And all of this at a time when so many organizations are forced to cut staff and slash budgets.
[00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:05.840]   Instead, we are actually spending more money than ever to freely give away the best news
[00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:07.360]   in the world.
[00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:11.120]   And all of our ministry, the website, the books from Pastor John, and of course, this
[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:15.840]   podcast, all of it is possible because God continues to raise up generous ministry partners
[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:22.760]   around us, people who regularly pray for us and who donate to support all of our work.
[00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:25.440]   If that's you, thank you for your partnership.
[00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:27.560]   We can't do it without you.
[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:30.440]   And if this is not you, maybe you've been a listener to the podcast or a reader of the
[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:34.520]   website for a while or downloaded free books by Pastor John or watched the YouTube videos
[00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:35.520]   we have online.
[00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:39.800]   Maybe you've been blessed by all of this content that our partners have made free of charge
[00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:41.640]   to you in the past.
[00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:45.360]   And now maybe you want to become someone who will now make those resources available to
[00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:50.040]   a new generation who will experience all of Pastor John and Desiring God's content free
[00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:51.560]   of charge.
[00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:55.960]   If that's you, now is a great time to join us as our fiscal year ends in June and our
[00:13:55.960 --> 00:14:00.520]   new fiscal year begins in July, and we begin to dream about all the new resources we want
[00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:06.500]   to make in the year ahead and new audiences we want to reach in the year ahead.
[00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:11.240]   Join us today by going online to DesiringGod.org/donate.
[00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:15.040]   That's DesiringGod.org/donate.
[00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:16.040]   Thank you for supporting us.
[00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:17.040]   I'm Tony Reinke.
[00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:19.240]   We'll see you back here on Monday.
[00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:20.240]   Have a great weekend.
