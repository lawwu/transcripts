[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Every one of us is born with an addiction for human praise.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   We want people to like us, but we also want people to praise us.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   And if we're not careful, we can feed on human praise.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   We get addicted to likes on Facebook and Instagram and retweets,
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   and our day is only going well if people favorite us or heart us or share us.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   We want personal praise gone viral.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   So what does our addiction to human praise do to us,
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   and how can we sever the source of this addiction?
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   To help, here's a clip from John Piper's sermon,
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   "The Love of Human Praise as the Root of Unbelief."
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   Here's what he said.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   Faith is drinking living water for the satisfaction of our souls.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   This is John 4. This is John 6.35.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   "Come to me. I'm water. I'm living water. You drink from me."
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   That's what faith is.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   Faith is a coming to Jesus to drink living water into our desperately thirsty souls
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   so that our souls are rested, satisfied, comforted, deeply happy
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   in all that God is for us in Jesus.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   Now when that happens, it drives out the enslaving craving for the praise of man.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   You don't need it!
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   Once you have tasted this water, the well of Jesus,
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   the well of all that God is in His approval in Christ,
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   who needs the approval of man anymore?
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   This is a barometer of your faith.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   How desperately do you crave people liking you?
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   It's okay to want to be liked.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   I mean, nobody likes to be disliked.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   We're talking about a craving, a needing, a control on your life.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   I've got to be liked. I've got to be approved. I've got to be praised.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   I need, I need, I need.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   And it's an addiction.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   It's a controlling bondage on our lives to need more praise,
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   more statistics in our favor, more kind words, less criticism,
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   more, more, more, more.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   And it never satisfies.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   It's got a buzz to it like drugs.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   It's got a buzz to it.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   And then it's got a hangover to it.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   It's the way it works.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   When you have tasted the beauty of God and the approval of God in Christ,
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   the addiction of human approval is broken and you are free.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   So, God, come and grant right now
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   that our eyes would be opened to see your glory
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   and that taste buds on the tongue of our soul would be awakened
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   so that we can taste how sweet the living water is,
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   sweeter than honey, sweeter than human praise,
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   and grant us, therefore, faith and set us free.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   May God do that for you.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   Father, we're all in this together.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   There's no finger pointing here.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Thank you, Jesus.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   Thank you for putting up this Word in front of us,
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   for showing us some of the reasons why we have a hard time believing you,
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   trusting you, resting in you.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   We invite you collectively.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   I do. I don't know if I can speak for everybody,
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   but all of us who are thus minded,
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   we invite you, do a crucifying work afresh in our lives.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   Take the axe of grace and the Spirit
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   and sever the root of our love affair
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   with the praise of man,
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   that we may believe and glorify you.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   I ask this in Jesus' name. Amen.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   Amen.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   That clip was taken from John Piper's sermon,
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   "The Love of Human Praise as the Root of Unbelief,"
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   which he preached on September 20, 2009.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   You can find that entire sermon at DesiringGod.org.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   For more on how this love of praise manifests itself online,
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   see an old episode we recorded, episode number 61,
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   which is titled "Twitter Goals and Humble Brags,"
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   "Twitter Goals and Humble Brags," episode number 61.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   And we have received a lot of questions
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   over the past few months on the abuse of pastoral authority.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   How do I know if my pastor is a spiritual bully?
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   That's the topic on the table tomorrow.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
