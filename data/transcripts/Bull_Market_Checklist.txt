[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000]   Hello, everybody.
[00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.800]   It's Sam from Financial Samurai, and I hope everyone is doing great.
[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.760]   In this podcast, I want to talk about the bull market checklist to living your best
[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:10.760]   life today.
[00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.880]   And before I get started, there's some housekeeping items I'm going through right now.
[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:22.480]   If you're an RSS subscriber to the blog articles and have been using my FeedBurner RSS feed,
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.980]   we're going to be making some changes and no longer using FeedBurner.
[00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:38.600]   And so I suggest you go on to Feedly or BlogLovin or other types of RSS readers and input www.financialsamurai.com/feed
[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.680]   to switch things up because we're creating a new feed for the podcast.
[00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.160]   So again, if you want to be an RSS reader, check out Feedly and BlogLovin.
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.680]   But on to the main menu, bull market checklist.
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.520]   It is amazing right now, folks.
[00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.560]   It cannot get better than right now.
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:03.440]   If you're not feeling wealthy today, I'm sorry, but you're probably never going to feel wealthier.
[00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.320]   Every single asset class, if you look around, is at all-time highs.
[00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.080]   Real estate has rebounded quite nicely since 2018.
[00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.600]   The S&P 500 is almost at 3,000.
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.240]   Interest rates have come down to around 2% on the 10-year bond yield.
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.440]   Things are kind of nuts.
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.760]   You're saving money and you're making money.
[00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.080]   So when you can do that double under, things are looking pretty good.
[00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.460]   So I wanted to highlight 10 things we should all be doing during this bull market to make
[00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:32.980]   the best of the situation.
[00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:34.280]   Because you know what?
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.000]   It might not last forever and it probably won't last forever.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.440]   So number one, take advantage of lower rates.
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.160]   This is a slam dunk guaranteed home run.
[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:48.040]   10-year bond yield is at two-year lows, folks, which means mortgage rates are also at two-year
[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.320]   lows.
[00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.400]   So for example, if you're looking for a 30-year fix, you can probably get one for 3.5% to
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.680]   3.75% depending on your credit and your relationship.
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.640]   I'm personally locking in a 7-1 arm at 2.75%.
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.840]   This is a relationship pricing.
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.040]   All fees are baked in.
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.840]   And I'm getting, I think, $4,000 credits.
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.840]   So they're giving me $4,000 to refinance for free.
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.440]   So that's pretty darn good, folks.
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.440]   Two, you're probably going to want to stay exposed, exposed to risk assets like stocks,
[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.880]   bonds, and real estate.
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.360]   They're your friends in a declining interest rate environment.
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.680]   Lower interest rates make owning other assets with higher interest rates or potentially
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.280]   higher returns more attractive.
[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.740]   I can't really tell you how much risk exposure you should have since everybody's risk tolerance
[00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.280]   and financial situation is different.
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.160]   All I can say is that you need to quantify your risk tolerance using the financial seer,
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.360]   S-E-E-R method, and then invest accordingly.
[00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.080]   For myself, I'm relatively conservative, folks.
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:56.440]   I have less than 50% of my stock and bond portfolio in stocks.
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:57.440]   But it's OK.
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.300]   It's up about 11%, 11.5%, 12% while the market is up 18%.
[00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.560]   I'll take it because my bogey is 5% a year.
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.960]   So if I'm doing double what my bogey is, I'm feeling good.
[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:14.320]   So you guys have to figure out how much you're looking to risk in order to get what type
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.720]   of reward.
[00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.920]   The most logical risk asset for me is to invest in real estate because of lower mortgage rates
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.680]   that will bring in more real estate demand.
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.120]   Given I'm in San Francisco, I'm thinking there's going to be a liquidity event come November
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:35.000]   or December of 2019 when the lockup periods expire for many workers at Uber, Lyft, and
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.540]   many other firms.
[00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.160]   So I think spring 2020 is going to be pretty frenzied.
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.560]   So I've done some things that are going to go and take advantage of that.
[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.400]   Three, ask for a raise or change jobs.
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.920]   We're currently at full employment, folks.
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:56.980]   The national unemployment rate is only 3.6%, which means that anybody who wants a job pretty
[00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.920]   much can get a job.
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.080]   So in this situation, it is not an employer's market.
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.960]   It is an employee's market.
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:10.920]   The general rule of thumb is that you can get at least a 20% or 25% bump in pay if you
[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.680]   put yourself up on the open market.
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.480]   That's just the way it is, folks.
[00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.320]   And then depending on performance and industry, you can probably get 50% or 100%.
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.480]   I remember when I was working in finance, every two years, people would be job hopping
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:27.360]   for 30% to 50% more guaranteed, and some people got two-year guaranteed bonuses.
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.640]   This one guy job hopped seven times in 10 years.
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:31.640]   I couldn't believe it.
[00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:35.200]   I'm like, you know what, he got pretty, pretty wealthy doing so.
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.840]   So take advantage of the crazy tight job market.
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.880]   Four, take a sabbatical.
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.480]   I know it's tough to get off the grid when so much money is to be made right now, but
[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:50.640]   it may be now or never, as it might be career suicide to take a sabbatical during a downturn.
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:54.400]   Because when you get back, you might not have a job, right?
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:00.440]   Not taking a sabbatical was one of my biggest regrets before retirement.
[00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.320]   Like I wish I took at least a one-month sabbatical, if not three months.
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.280]   At my firm, you're allowed to take up to three months sabbatical every five years you work,
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.280]   and I was there for 11 years, and I didn't take anything.
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.240]   And so basically, I lost out.
[00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.320]   Please take full advantage of your company benefits.
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.560]   Five, start strategically living it up.
[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.400]   This is the core of this podcast, I think.
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.560]   If you can't live it up when times are good, you certainly won't be able to live it up
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.120]   when times are bad.
[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:32.040]   When times are bad, you'll just want to save more and take on more side hustles to make
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.440]   more money because you're freaked out.
[00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:39.960]   The end result is that you never end up spending any of your money on living the good life.
[00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:46.200]   And I see older generations, like my parents and their parents and other parents, they're
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:49.120]   always super frugal, no matter how much they have.
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.480]   They've got lifetime pensions, they've got no debt, and they still aren't willing to
[00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:54.840]   spend it up.
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:01.360]   So I am encouraging my relatives, specifically my parents, to spend their money, to order
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.880]   that nice bottle of wine, to order that Wagy steak.
[00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:06.880]   It's okay.
[00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:08.480]   Things will be okay.
[00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:14.200]   During a bull market, you're making way more beyond your normal expected income, right?
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:20.360]   Day job, side income, hustling, passive income, capital appreciation.
[00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:23.560]   So in other words, bull market money feels like free money or funny money.
[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:27.720]   And your goal is to calculate how much funny money or free money you've made each year
[00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:33.080]   from the bull market and proceed to spend some of it on yourself and your family and
[00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:34.880]   your friends and your loved ones.
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:36.880]   You don't have to spend all of it, of course.
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:43.000]   However, you should try to spend at least 10% of your funny money on living it up.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   For example, in the fourth quarter of 2018, I was down about $300,000 in my house fund
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   portfolio, and that hurt a lot.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.680]   The house fund portfolio is what it says it is.
[00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.000]   It's to buy another piece of property.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.320]   But luckily, the house fund made up all of its losses and then gained about a couple
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:04.000]   hundred thousand for a $500,000 swing in six months.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.240]   So gaining back that $300,000 felt a little bit like free money because I had foolishly
[00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:10.840]   over allocated towards tech stocks.
[00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:15.560]   But making that extra $200,000 really felt like funny free money.
[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:20.520]   Therefore, I took a portion of that $200,000 and lived it up a little.
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:26.480]   Went on a nice longer vacation, bought some new socks, some new shoes, maybe a new tennis
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:27.480]   racket.
[00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:30.880]   Hey, it felt great, and I know it's going to be there with me for a long time.
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:36.100]   And I just really want to encourage everybody to spend money on memories and higher quality
[00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:38.600]   items that will bring them joy.
[00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:41.040]   Six, hunt for unicorns.
[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:44.200]   During a bull market, bigger bubbles tend to form.
[00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:48.800]   And this is the time when you can really, really get rich and when you see people really,
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:49.800]   really get rich.
[00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:54.480]   If you can catch a bubble and ride it before it implodes, you could potentially make a
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:56.120]   lot, a lot of money.
[00:07:56.120 --> 00:08:00.440]   So I would set aside about 10% of your cash flow, not existing investments, your cash
[00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:04.720]   flow in search of the next great speculative investment.
[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:08.840]   Speculative investment is usually an unproven product, doesn't have positive cash flow,
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:10.800]   and is something not mainstream.
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:14.100]   It's something that people will probably ridicule you about.
[00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:20.200]   But that's okay, because by the time everybody recognizes what you've recognized, it's going
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.580]   to be a little bit too late.
[00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:28.020]   You should expect to lose 100% of your 10% with the chance of making perhaps a 1000 plus
[00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:29.020]   percent return.
[00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:35.260]   The likelihood of either happening is probably small, but there's a saying, no bet, no win.
[00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:39.120]   You just can't be on the sidelines and not take a little bit more risk if you want to
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.320]   get richer.
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:47.060]   It's absolutely fine to invest in index funds like the S&P 500 or the Dow Jones or the Nasdaq
[00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:49.100]   or the bond index, whatever you want.
[00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:50.540]   They're low cost, they're great.
[00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:54.280]   You don't want to try to outperform the market with the majority of your money.
[00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:59.140]   The thing you just have to recognize is that you have little chance of ever getting richer
[00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:03.300]   faster than the majority of the investing population.
[00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:08.620]   And Financial Samurai really is about achieving financial freedom sooner rather than later.
[00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:13.700]   Because if everybody makes a million dollars and you make a million dollars, you're just
[00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:16.300]   another regular person.
[00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:20.860]   If everybody's retiring at 60 and you retire at 60, it's just no big deal.
[00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:27.220]   I'm trying to get folks to get wealthier quicker in a risk adjusted and appropriate manner
[00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:31.420]   so that they can live much richer and fuller lives.
[00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:34.460]   All you need is one lucky break to supercharge your wealth.
[00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:39.260]   And once you get that lucky break, you want to protect your wealth and make it multiply
[00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.420]   and make money for you for the long term.
[00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:47.140]   Seven, this is probably not applicable to most people, but shop your business around.
[00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:53.300]   When valuations are high, just like they are in the bull market, you've got a great opportunity
[00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:57.860]   to unload your equity on someone who might not be able to get the same amount of returns
[00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:00.740]   going forward because the valuations are high.
[00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:06.620]   And really folks, if you want to make next generation wealth, you've got to build equity,
[00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:10.540]   own equity and watch that grow and multiply over time.
[00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:12.860]   Number eight, become a charlatan.
[00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:17.540]   In a bull market, qualifications and credentials are often overlooked because everybody's making
[00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:19.340]   so much money.
[00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:25.340]   As Warren Buffett said, you only know who's swimming naked until the tide goes out.
[00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:28.840]   It's only after people start losing money that folks start carefully reading the fine
[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:33.060]   print and questioning the background of the person.
[00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:37.460]   During the last bull market, I know one guy who wrote a book about how to get rich despite
[00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:41.860]   having recently graduated from college with hardly any money.
[00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:49.260]   And then he sold courses, $1,000 courses online on how to negotiate a pay raise.
[00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:52.940]   Meanwhile, the guy had never had a job for more than two years.
[00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:56.300]   He had not been in the work industry for more than two years.
[00:10:56.300 --> 00:11:01.440]   So he ended up partially getting rich because of his book and because of these courses.
[00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:05.100]   And now he can get even richer because he's now rich.
[00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:09.640]   Today I know of 25-year-olds with zero financial backgrounds who are teaching people how to
[00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:13.240]   invest in the stock market and retire early.
[00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:14.720]   It is unbelievable, folks.
[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:16.560]   You can do anything you want.
[00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:22.560]   I've got fellow physicians whose expertise is in obviously surgery, medical stuff.
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:25.340]   They're talking about making money and all that.
[00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:29.480]   And they might be confusing their high incomes with their investment prowess, but it doesn't
[00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:34.120]   really, really matter because it's a bull market and everybody's getting wealthy.
[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:38.800]   So if you've ever wanted to make money as a charlatan, now is the time to take advantage.
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:42.560]   It doesn't matter if you're a failed political consultant trying to position yourself as
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:47.440]   a financial expert or a company founder with no pertinent experience.
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:52.520]   If you fake it, chances are the highest during a bull market that you're going to make it.
[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:56.040]   Nine, calculate your financial independence number.
[00:11:56.040 --> 00:12:01.160]   It's fun to calculate how much you'll have if the bull market lasts for XYZ years.
[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:05.280]   It's also very dangerous to extrapolate massive gains for a long period of time.
[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:11.080]   So if you're extrapolating 10%, 15% year-over-year gains for the next five to 10 years, I think
[00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:13.240]   you're going to be in for a big disappointment.
[00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:17.320]   I'd be extrapolating maybe 4% to 6%.
[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:21.280]   Four to 6%, again, because the 10-year bond yield is 2% and everything is relative to
[00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:22.800]   the risk-free rate.
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:26.960]   Your goal should be to come up with your financial independence number that will produce enough
[00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:30.260]   investment income so you never have to work again.
[00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:34.980]   This is my definition and I think the only definition of financial independence on a
[00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:36.760]   mathematical level.
[00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:42.900]   Having enough investment income cover your best life's living expenses.
[00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:48.320]   So once you've created various financial independence scenarios, you'll naturally start taking steps
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:49.560]   to get there.
[00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:52.520]   Too many people just wing it when it comes to their finances.
[00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:58.320]   Then they wake up 5, 10, 15, 20 years from now and wonder where all their money went.
[00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:03.600]   It's really easy to lose track and lose sight of your money if you don't have a plan and
[00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:08.200]   you don't check them and if you don't stick to the plan over the long term.
[00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:13.240]   In my case, my FI number keeps growing because of kids.
[00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:17.440]   One kid in San Francisco is very, very expensive.
[00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:19.040]   Two kids is going to be more expensive.
[00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:25.160]   So hey, luckily we can't populate the earth forever because we're getting old.
[00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:31.720]   One of the final things that I recommend everyone do, the 10th item, is to really think about
[00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:33.360]   generational wealth.
[00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:38.420]   This is a tricky subject because you want to obviously set yourself up to be financially
[00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:45.480]   independent but you want your loved ones, especially your kids, not to have to suffer
[00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:47.520]   in case you guys are gone.
[00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:52.880]   So the 10th item really is to talk to an estate lawyer, estate planner, and figure out how
[00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:59.840]   to create generational wealth that won't be wasted because there's a great saying, "From
[00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:04.160]   rice paddy field to rice paddy field in three generations."
[00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:08.940]   You've busted your butt working, saving, investing, taking risks.
[00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:12.480]   You want your kids to do the same and to grow their own wealth.
[00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:17.600]   And just in case they fail, just in case they just cannot succeed in this super hyper-competitive
[00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:20.360]   world, you've got a safety net.
[00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:24.280]   But the key is not to let them know they have that safety net.
[00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:26.280]   Nobody knows how long this bull market will last.
[00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:27.400]   I don't know, really.
[00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:31.840]   I thought things would fade a little bit and things did fade a little bit in 2018 with
[00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:34.400]   the real estate market and the stock market.
[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:38.040]   But now it's back to bull markets because the Fed said they're going to do whatever
[00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:40.880]   it takes to keep the party alive.
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:45.560]   All I know is that for the foreseeable future, the Fed is on our side.
[00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:50.760]   Interest rates are low and there's a presidential election coming up promising us lots of freebies.
[00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:55.920]   We're going to get free tuition, free health care, free back massages, whatever you want.
[00:14:55.920 --> 00:15:01.200]   You name it because the politicians need our votes.
[00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:06.480]   So it's conceivable that at the rate candidates are going, that our children will never have
[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:08.640]   to work for a living again.
[00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:10.560]   Pretty cool but also kind of dangerous.
[00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:14.560]   So in conclusion, let's really enjoy this bull market.
[00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:19.440]   But also, let's not be delirious and delusional at the same time.
[00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:23.360]   There is one recession indicator we must all be aware of.
[00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:29.000]   And that is when the Fed starts actively and aggressively cutting their Fed funds rate,
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.320]   a recession is not far behind.
[00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:32.320]   It always happens.
[00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:36.560]   It's within 12 months away once the Fed aggressively starts cutting rates.
[00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:41.600]   And the reason why is because the Fed is a little too slow in cutting rates so they have
[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:46.160]   to aggressively cut rates because they see the slowdown coming.
[00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:47.160]   And it's coming quickly.
[00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:53.520]   So if the Fed only needs to cut a little bit, let's say one to four times instead of eight
[00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:56.320]   times, things will be okay.
[00:15:56.320 --> 00:16:01.680]   But if the Fed has to be like, "Oh my gosh, we've got to save the economy," that's when
[00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:05.040]   things start spiraling out of control.
[00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:07.000]   The good times aren't going to last forever.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.720]   The hammer will eventually drop.
[00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:14.640]   But if we prepare when times are good, maybe only our toes will get bashed in instead of
[00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:15.640]   our heads.
