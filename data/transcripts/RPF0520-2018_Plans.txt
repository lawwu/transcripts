[00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.600]   Today I'm going to tell you about that.
[00:00:45.600 --> 00:01:01.600]   [Music]
[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.000]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.480]   skills, insight and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now, while
[00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.560]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.000]   My name is Joshua and I am your host.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.600]   Today I'll tell you about our 2018 plan.
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.840]   Yes, I know it's February, but hey, you got to get things at least somewhat settled before
[00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.400]   you start talking about them, right?
[00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.000]   At least I feel like I do.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   [Music]
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.920]   Today's episode of Radical Personal Finance will be very focused on just a little bit
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.720]   of personal story, me interacting with you, a little bit of background.
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.440]   I don't have a formal teaching outline that will be a lot of story, but if you care to
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.680]   listen to the story, it should help you with a little bit of analysis, some ideas that
[00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:49.920]   you may apply to your own life.
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.400]   I don't claim to do everything well, but I don't think that that is the basis of being
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.360]   able to share with one another and being able to help one another.
[00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.960]   Sometimes it's helpful to hear somebody else's thinking and their own method of analysis
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.480]   and you can either see something good, which you can take and apply to yourself, or you
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:13.720]   can see something bad, which you can take and apply to yourself in avoiding something.
[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.240]   Frequently, if you listen to other people talk about their plans, you'll notice in their
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:24.520]   own mistakes and in their own problems, you'll notice some things that you can put in place
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.000]   to protect yourself.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.640]   So as I share with you a little bit about my analysis and my family and life and a little
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.680]   bit – a few of the things that we're doing, I hope you'll find it instructive in a positive
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.880]   sense, but if not, I hope you'll at least find it instructive and you can learn from
[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:40.880]   our mistakes.
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:41.880]   So let's get right to it.
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:48.720]   Short story up front, we are planning this year in 2018 to do some major traveling.
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.640]   We intend to do a multi-month round-the-country RV tour.
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.440]   I'll be loading up my family, my wife, my three children, our two dogs, and we'll be
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.000]   hooking up to our 30-foot travel trailer and pickup truck and we're going to travel around
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.760]   the country, which we are very much looking forward to.
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.840]   I'm going to be a little bit vague with you on dates and details because – mostly
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.280]   because they're not set in stone at the moment.
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:18.280]   But my intention is to leave here in the springtime, perhaps as soon as April 1, and to be on the
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.420]   road for – throughout the spring, summer, and probably fall, maybe shorter, maybe longer.
[00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.760]   But that is our intention as far as our traveling dates.
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.000]   As far as the itinerary of where we're planning to go, that also is very flexible.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.680]   I'll tell you a little bit in a few minutes about how you can help us set the itinerary.
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:41.600]   But in short, we'll be starting at our home here in South Florida and we at least want
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.960]   to wind up in the Mountain West to visit my family who lives out in the Mountain West.
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:51.820]   I want to visit my 103-year-old grandmother who has not yet met two of my children.
[00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.780]   So we'd like to take them out and visit her out in the Mountain West.
[00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.080]   So whether we'll go straight up through the country on a diagonal tour from Miami
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.000]   to Seattle, I don't know.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.580]   Whether we'll cruise up through the Northeast and go up the East Coast and then go across
[00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.480]   the middle of the country and then come back down and do the circle tour, we haven't
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.200]   decided those details yet.
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.380]   But you can help us decide those.
[00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.440]   We do have a good long list of friends that we want to visit and destinations that we
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:18.440]   have planned.
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.000]   But we will be, as I'll explain to you in a moment, we'll be traveling slowly and
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.520]   flexibly, which is about the only way that I think that parents can handle a trip like
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.920]   this with young children.
[00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.320]   Now, a little bit of background for you.
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:35.440]   On Radical Personal Finance, I talk quite a bit about unusual lifestyles and I've
[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:41.440]   talked a lot about people who engage in long-term perpetual travel, either long-term trips or
[00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.320]   even of many months or many years.
[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.100]   I've interviewed plenty of people, especially families who've done this.
[00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:53.560]   Many people who are pursuing early retirement are traveling in this way.
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.440]   And so it's a theme that I have featured many times on the show and talked about how
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:59.440]   to do it.
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.120]   I've appeared on various travel podcasts and talked about the financial planning aspects
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.120]   of it.
[00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:11.280]   But for my family and for me, travel hasn't really been a big goal for our life at this
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.860]   point in time.
[00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:19.320]   And so this planned trip that we have here in 2018 is not the culmination of a long-planned
[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.280]   big goal really in any way.
[00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.680]   Sightseeing is not a major goal for me at the moment.
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:31.040]   I've been very fortunate, very privileged to travel throughout much of the United States.
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:36.280]   At this point in my life, I think I've been to either 46 or 47 of these United States.
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:42.200]   I'm missing Hawaii, North Dakota, and Minnesota.
[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:47.600]   I think other than Hawaii, North Dakota, and Minnesota, I have been to all of these 50
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:48.600]   United States.
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.580]   So we'll try to make up at least North Dakota and Minnesota on this trip.
[00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:52.960]   So I can make it up to 49.
[00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.280]   At some point we'll wind up in Hawaii, but that's never opened up.
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:00.880]   So I've been very fortunate in my life, though I am in my early 30s.
[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:04.600]   I haven't yet – I mean, I've been very fortunate to travel with more than many people.
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:09.400]   I've been very fortunate to travel to many international destinations as well, to at
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.920]   least a couple dozen countries, which is far more than the average person and certainly
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:17.680]   far more than the average American and the average global citizen.
[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:22.520]   And so because of that, I have been very blessed and privileged to see many sights.
[00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:28.680]   And I've recognized that although I enjoy sightseeing, sightseeing isn't a core motivator
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.360]   for me.
[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:34.960]   There are very few sights that I really want to see that I feel like, "Oh, if I just
[00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:37.640]   see these things, then my life will be complete."
[00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:41.240]   I have enjoyed seeing many great sights.
[00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:48.360]   It's really remarkable to stand in the Sistine Chapel and look up and see the painting on
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:54.040]   the ceiling or to stand in the Duomo and admire it or to stand in the Colosseum – just using
[00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:59.600]   some examples from Rome – to stand in the Colosseum and imagine what happened there.
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:05.520]   I've been very privileged to walk on the Great Wall of China and to consider what thousands
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:08.920]   of years of history has produced and to see that.
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:12.720]   I've walked in Tiananmen Square and seen some of those incredible things.
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:15.880]   I've been to some really out-of-the-way places too.
[00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:19.480]   My wife and I, when we were newly married, we traveled to Haiti.
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:24.080]   And I always loved – in South Florida, we have a massive Haitian population of Haitian
[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:27.680]   immigrants and I always enjoy being able to talk with them about all the interesting places
[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:31.720]   I've been in Haiti and the sights that we've seen there.
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:38.280]   So whether it's from the well-known, such as the Sistine Chapel to the Basson Rue in
[00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:44.360]   Haiti or to the Palace of Saint-Souci, all of these little places, I've been very fortunate.
[00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:48.120]   But still, I don't have a list of sights I want to see.
[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:51.580]   And I've never really been that interested in perpetual travel either.
[00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:59.320]   In many ways, me personally, I see travel and perpetual travel as in many ways problematic.
[00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:03.480]   There's difference if I just travel and there's problems if my whole family travels constantly.
[00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:10.280]   But although you can build communities on the road, it seems very transitory to me.
[00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:14.580]   And I think that one of the major benefits of life is to put down roots in a community
[00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:21.040]   and to build because when you can build with people and in a neighborhood and in a community,
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:25.040]   you can really have an impact, really have an impact in that place.
[00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:30.920]   And as a society becomes very much transient, we lose our connection to a place.
[00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:35.840]   And so this is not a moral argument that it's wrong to travel.
[00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:39.640]   Just for me, it's not been something that appeals to me very much.
[00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:45.620]   For me, what I find the most impactful about travel is when travel has meaning and purpose
[00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:48.900]   that goes beyond just simply taking in the sights.
[00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:51.520]   Now that meaning and purpose can mean different things.
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:57.160]   It can be travel that involves work based upon the work that you do.
[00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:02.760]   If you go and travel to a city to do an assignment there, whether it's to give a speech or to
[00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:08.600]   research and take local water samples to test the environment or to go into to make a sales
[00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:14.200]   call, then I find that the associated travel with that, as long as you're not on too tight
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:16.960]   of a schedule, can be very enjoyable and very meaningful.
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:22.240]   It's great to fly and schedule meetings on Friday and Monday and take Saturday and Sunday
[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:23.800]   and take in the sights.
[00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:25.080]   That's really ideal.
[00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:29.440]   I find that travel is really impactful if there's a purpose to the trip.
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:31.800]   That purpose can be the work involved in the trip.
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:37.720]   We're going to deliver something to a certain place or we're going to preach and to interact
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:42.160]   in certain churches or we're going to engage in a humanitarian project in a certain place.
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:47.400]   Then that greater meaning, to me, has real purpose and there's an output to the work
[00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:53.000]   where we don't just come home with a photo album filled with photos, which is great,
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.120]   and a mind full of memories, but we come home with the satisfaction of having worked and
[00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:00.120]   having accomplished something significant.
[00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:07.480]   I think travel that's part of a quest or a big goal can be very meaningful.
[00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:13.440]   For example, whether it's to travel the length of the Pan American Highway or to do some
[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:17.520]   great challenge when I was younger, I really wanted to participate in the Mongol Rally,
[00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:22.640]   which is this utterly ridiculous thing that started probably a decade ago where these
[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:29.760]   people will buy a – will either take a – will drive from London to Mongolia to – what's
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:32.160]   the capital of Mongolia?
[00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:33.160]   I think it's Ulaanbaatar.
[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:38.680]   They'll drive a car from London overland to Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia.
[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:44.920]   But as part of the Mongol Rally, part of the design is that instead of driving a reasonable
[00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:51.200]   vehicle as in a four-wheel drive, put-together, kitted out expedition vehicle, you have to
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:52.720]   drive a ridiculous vehicle.
[00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:57.600]   In the old days, it was an old, cheap, underpowered little compact car.
[00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:01.800]   I always wanted to participate in the Mongol Rally when I was younger because that quest,
[00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:04.820]   that challenge, that adventure really appeals to me.
[00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:10.200]   So all of those things for me have meaning and I love to travel when it has a greater
[00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:13.920]   meaning but not just for a sightseeing perspective.
[00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:17.640]   In other ways also at this stage of our life, travel hasn't been a big deal simply because
[00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:23.240]   our children are not at a great age for traveling in the sense of they're not at a great age
[00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:25.980]   to be able to appreciate the benefit.
[00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:31.580]   For years, I've planned that when my children are later older in life and able to embrace
[00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:36.320]   the educational opportunities of it, I've for years planned to take a year or two and
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:41.640]   load up an RV and travel all around the United States and show my children all of the 50
[00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:47.400]   United States, go to all the 50 state capitals and interact with the history, the rich history
[00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:52.000]   of the United States of America and in a way that's meaningful for them.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.620]   So I've long planned to do that.
[00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:58.480]   But at this point in time, a dirt pile in Florida is about the same as a dirt pile in
[00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:01.120]   Maine and has about as much attraction.
[00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:06.840]   The touring Appomattox doesn't exactly have the impact at this stage of my children's
[00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:07.840]   lives.
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:11.460]   And there are many challenges of traveling with small children.
[00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:17.560]   So that was an extensive way of simply saying that travel has not been a significant goal,
[00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:20.520]   at least not at this stage of our life.
[00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:23.960]   It's not been something that has been long planned.
[00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:25.520]   So why are we traveling this year?
[00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:30.040]   Well, there are personal reasons which involve my family and business reasons which involve
[00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:31.180]   you.
[00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:33.520]   But the personal reasons are a fewfold.
[00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:37.120]   Number one, my wife and I have a number of friends that live across the United States
[00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:41.360]   that we would like to visit and that we've wanted to visit for quite a while, people
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:44.000]   that we've wanted to keep in touch with.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.480]   I don't do very well at keeping in touch with people virtually.
[00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:50.880]   I don't enjoy writing emails.
[00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:54.040]   I don't enjoy interacting on virtual mechanisms.
[00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:55.240]   I don't enjoy talking on the phone.
[00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:57.880]   I'm a face-to-face kind of guy.
[00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:04.320]   But it's hard to justify the time and money to just trot across the country, the drop
[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:09.560]   of a hat, to visit somebody, especially given the size of my family at the moment.
[00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:14.600]   When you have many people that you're trying to coordinate together, airplane tickets become
[00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:17.360]   significantly costly.
[00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:23.160]   And with the age of my children, road trips are not as easy as I imagine they'll be down
[00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:24.280]   the road.
[00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:27.240]   So we have a number of friends that we'd like to visit, but there hasn't been a good opportunity.
[00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:31.520]   And so we've seen the opportunity right now to go and to visit some of our friends and
[00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:36.720]   be able to renew relationships that we've had that are important to us.
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:42.560]   Additionally, perhaps more pressing, we have outgrown the house that we're living in right
[00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:43.560]   now.
[00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:46.920]   Now, about a year – no, actually, two and a half years ago, we sold – my wife and
[00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:50.760]   I, we sold a house that was larger and more comfortable for us.
[00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:52.560]   And we sold that house for a number of reasons.
[00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:58.160]   Number one, it was a lifestyle choice to allow me to build the business of Radical Personal
[00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:04.040]   Finance with fewer financial pressures by removing the obligation of a mortgage, lowering
[00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:05.040]   overall expenses.
[00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:09.880]   We moved from a middle-class to upper-middle-class neighborhood into a lower-class neighborhood
[00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:11.660]   rental apartment.
[00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:12.660]   And it's been great for us.
[00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:13.720]   It's been really, really good.
[00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:19.320]   There was also a guess on my part with regard to market conditions.
[00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:24.080]   When I was analyzing the local real estate market, I looked around and I said this was
[00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:27.280]   a good time to sell when we actually sold.
[00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:29.440]   And I was anticipating a few things.
[00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:32.760]   Number one, we'd lived in the house long enough to be able to take the proceeds from
[00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:36.720]   the gain in the property, income tax-free, which is always nice when you've lived in
[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:40.120]   a place for at least enough years to take that gain income tax-free.
[00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:41.300]   I love tax-free money.
[00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:45.400]   When you can give money that's free of income taxes and free of payroll taxes, I mean I
[00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:46.400]   love that.
[00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:52.360]   And that exclusion on increase in value of a personal residence is extremely valuable.
[00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:54.300]   And so we had built in a nice little bit of equity.
[00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:55.300]   We had bought right.
[00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:58.440]   We had bought at a deal and we bought at a low point in the market.
[00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:03.560]   And in my analysis of market conditions, I felt like it was a good time to sell.
[00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:11.260]   I was expecting – my prediction at the time was that some point towards the end of 2016
[00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:18.240]   or during 2017, it was my prediction that we would be into a recession in the US American
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:19.360]   economy.
[00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:21.920]   That was my expectation and there were good reasons for it.
[00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:25.440]   There were good symptoms of it and good indications of that.
[00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:28.560]   And I was wrong.
[00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:32.620]   I was flat out wrong on my timing, which is important to always acknowledge.
[00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:35.480]   When you predict something and get it wrong, it's important to look and say, "Well,
[00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:36.480]   why was I wrong?"
[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:42.940]   You should not expect the growth of growing economy to continue as it has.
[00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:45.700]   Now, it could be that recession is right around the corner.
[00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:48.500]   We are long overdue for recession.
[00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:53.140]   But my particular timing of my crystal ball was not appropriate.
[00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:58.020]   The second concern that I had with local market conditions is that where we live in Palm Beach
[00:15:58.020 --> 00:16:03.420]   County, Florida, local market conditions have become disconnected from the broader economy.
[00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:09.820]   This led to a major problem here in our local housing market, just like it has for many
[00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:11.900]   of you who are listening.
[00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:16.660]   In general, housing should be connected to the labor market.
[00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:22.700]   If you have a local market where people are earning wages, they need a place to live.
[00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:25.680]   And so housing should have a connection to wages.
[00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:31.180]   But in localized pockets, that normal connection, those normal markets become disconnected.
[00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:39.020]   It can become disconnected due to heavy impact of high-income earners, especially if there
[00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:41.420]   are significant regulations.
[00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:46.300]   For example, if you were to go back about 60, 50 to 70 years and you were to go into
[00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:52.460]   a place like Manhattan in New York, you would find that a plumber could live right next
[00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:57.120]   to a banker because housing was very much connected to wages.
[00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:03.720]   But as New York and other major cities have kept very tight codes on the ability to expand
[00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:12.400]   and to build more buildings, what's happened is that as the local population center has
[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:17.660]   grown and wages have become more specialized, you've had many higher-income earners become
[00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:20.720]   concentrated in that specific area.
[00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:25.120]   And because builders have been restricted by zoning regulations, et cetera, from building
[00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:30.640]   more affordable housing units and meeting that market demand, then the lower-wage workers
[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:34.360]   are pushed out from the city center.
[00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:38.200]   And so as those lower-wage workers are pushed out from the city center, that leads to the
[00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:39.380]   process of gentrification.
[00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:44.080]   The city center starts growing up more and more and more and you get into these unusual
[00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:48.160]   situations, whether it's Seattle, whether it's New York City, whether it's Boston, whether
[00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:50.960]   it's Los Angeles, San Francisco.
[00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:59.120]   And the very high-income earners continue to raise that – those local market prices
[00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:02.200]   and it makes it hard to analyze the market.
[00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:06.760]   And I couldn't of course hope to analyze every market.
[00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:11.040]   What's happened where I live in Palm Beach County is we've had a similar effect.
[00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:16.840]   But that similar effect has not been due to wage growth and income growth but due to retirees
[00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:17.840]   coming down.
[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:22.400]   So Palm Beach County is not – South Florida is not part of the south.
[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:28.760]   The further south you go in Florida, the more everything looks like New Jersey and New York.
[00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:31.920]   So southern culture has basically fallen apart.
[00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:35.440]   If you get south of Orlando, you don't have southern culture anymore.
[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:40.400]   You have the northeastern culture because the huge amount of our residents in South
[00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:46.000]   Florida are from New Jersey and New York and other northeastern states, Maryland and Delaware,
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   et cetera.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   Connecticut, places with high taxes and high cost of living.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:57.520]   And so it's led to a very unusual and strange market where if you come down to South Florida
[00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:59.120]   – and this has only happened along the coast.
[00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:01.220]   It doesn't happen on the interior of Florida.
[00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:05.360]   But on the east coast of Florida and the west coast of Florida, you'll have so many people
[00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:10.740]   who move down from New York and New Jersey and they're moving out of very high real
[00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:16.800]   estate price – very high real estate – areas with very high real estate prices due to the
[00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:20.600]   significant buildup in the high population.
[00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:23.880]   And they're looking at South Florida real estate prices and saying, "Man, this is
[00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:24.880]   a steal."
[00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:29.120]   And when you compound that with the second factor, which is the removal of state income
[00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:33.720]   taxes, it's not unusual for a New York or New Jersey resident to move down to South
[00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:37.680]   Florida and to put themselves in a situation where they're saving tens of thousands of
[00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:41.440]   dollars per year on income taxes.
[00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:49.240]   It's very easy for a wealthy northeasterner to move down to South Florida and because
[00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:55.560]   there are tens of thousands of dollars per year of savings on income taxes and they can
[00:19:55.560 --> 00:20:02.040]   cut their house cost in half and still finance the entire thing and still be out as a net
[00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:03.440]   gain.
[00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:06.840]   Commuting between South Florida and the northeast is very easy.
[00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:10.760]   There are constant cheap, easy airplane flights.
[00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:14.800]   You can get there in – there are direct flights everywhere from South Florida throughout
[00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:15.800]   the northeast.
[00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:17.320]   In a few hours, you can be there.
[00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:21.800]   So it's easy to commute back and forth for business and this has led to a real change
[00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:24.280]   in our local real estate market.
[00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:29.040]   What's happening though is the same process that's happened in many other places where
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:34.840]   for those who are not involved in living off of their retirement portfolio, which is the
[00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:40.680]   huge amount of people, for those who are younger people, working class people – I hate that
[00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:49.080]   term and here I am using it – blue collar, low and medium wage earners have been systematically
[00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:53.920]   frozen out and the housing market locally where I live has systematically changed.
[00:20:53.920 --> 00:21:00.360]   The median house price if we go by listing prices in Palm Beach County is about $340,000.
[00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:07.120]   The median rental price for a rental unit is about just under $2,000 a month.
[00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:11.640]   When you start translating those out – and again, those are median prices.
[00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:17.040]   Remember, 50 percent higher and 50 percent lower when we're judging the median price.
[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:20.360]   That leads to major costs, major increases in housing.
[00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:24.520]   Now the question of course is where can that go?
[00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:26.200]   What direction does housing go?
[00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:31.080]   When you try to analyze the local market, what it means is you can't connect it to
[00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:32.080]   wages.
[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:33.120]   Wage growth is slow.
[00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:38.840]   If it exists – I wouldn't say it's nonexistent but it's very, very slow in most wage-earning
[00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:40.360]   occupations.
[00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:42.320]   So you can't connect housing to wages.
[00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:46.320]   Now you're in a situation where you're connecting housing to immigration trends and
[00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:48.160]   to portfolio values.
[00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:55.520]   It's a lot easier for a retiring Northeasterner with a $3 million investment portfolio to
[00:21:55.520 --> 00:22:01.720]   pay more and to buy a nicer house when they have a $3 million portfolio than when their
[00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:08.240]   portfolio is cut to $2 million due to a recent stock market decline.
[00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:13.680]   So these are the factors that make analysis of economic conditions where I live very difficult
[00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:17.080]   and make trend prediction very, very challenging.
[00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:19.760]   You're dependent on the stock market, dependent on immigration flows.
[00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:23.240]   You're dependent on retirees, the number of people retiring, et cetera.
[00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:27.720]   Those have a major effect because most of even the actual wage occupations in South
[00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:31.640]   Florida where I live are built around that retirement occupation.
[00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:34.080]   We have no heavy – very little heavy industry.
[00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:41.460]   Most of the wages are service wages that are related to serving the affluent retiree.
[00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:45.600]   So that's the economic analysis at least that I have applied and it's led to a giant
[00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:46.600]   question mark.
[00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:47.600]   What does the future hold?
[00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:52.120]   Well, it's hard to predict that when you can't look at trends that are trackable.
[00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:55.480]   You can certainly look at trends of immigration, look at trends like that.
[00:22:55.480 --> 00:23:02.560]   But when you can't look at trends from – of wage growth and business growth, et cetera,
[00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:04.880]   it makes it very challenging.
[00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:09.840]   I don't think it makes sense to try to make personal decisions, personal financial decisions
[00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:11.880]   based upon market analysis.
[00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:13.680]   I really don't.
[00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:18.060]   For example, when we sold our house, I didn't sell it because I thought the real estate
[00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:20.320]   market was going to go down.
[00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:25.160]   If we had wanted to live there on an ongoing basis, we would have kept it regardless of
[00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:28.040]   whether it goes up or down.
[00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:32.960]   But if you make a decision from a personal lifestyle perspective, then I think it makes
[00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:39.340]   more sense to look at the market and say, "Now, let me integrate this with the market."
[00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:44.080]   If you want to sell because you want to move, then go ahead and look at the market and say,
[00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:47.640]   "Is there an advantageous time or an advantageous way to sell?"
[00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:55.800]   Because our personal decisions to sell our house were to – were personally based about
[00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:58.160]   – around improving our lifestyle.
[00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:01.480]   At this point in time, our – and our personal decisions for moving out of the apartment
[00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:04.840]   that we're living on are also personal lifestyle.
[00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:08.800]   The simple reality is we've outgrown the apartment that we rented.
[00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:12.960]   The biggest influence is actually with my work.
[00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:17.700]   When we first moved into this apartment, we had just had our second child and that child
[00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:19.440]   was a baby.
[00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:22.680]   Most of the sound was able to be contained.
[00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:26.880]   Children at that age slept for longer – sleep for longer periods of time than older children
[00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:27.880]   do.
[00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:32.580]   It was relatively easy to engage them in one of the distant bedrooms so that I could record
[00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:35.760]   my show and I could work with relative quiet.
[00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:37.320]   So at first, it was fine.
[00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:41.760]   Then as the children got louder, it became worse.
[00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:43.240]   So I made some improvements.
[00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:47.800]   I put in some soundproofing curtains in my office and that helped me to continue to do
[00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:50.440]   the show for you and continue to work.
[00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:55.840]   But as the children have grown older, then of course their geographic range has increased.
[00:24:55.840 --> 00:25:00.960]   So at this point in time, they're much less content to be confined to one bedroom during
[00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:05.860]   the time when I'm working, which can be anywhere from an hour or two to record a show to extensive
[00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:10.400]   hours if I'm trying to record other audio for other products – projects.
[00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:11.400]   So it's gotten bad.
[00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:15.920]   And even the layout of the apartment has resulted in the way for the children to access the
[00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:19.040]   backyard is right through my office.
[00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:23.080]   And so over the past months, there have been systematic growing pains and at this point,
[00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:24.080]   we need to make a change.
[00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:25.640]   It's not – it doesn't have to be done.
[00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:30.600]   We found workarounds but in the sense of – there's not – it doesn't have to be this week.
[00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:34.080]   But the writing on the wall is very, very clear and we need to change.
[00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:37.840]   The problem is I can't really stomach the idea of moving right now where we live in
[00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:38.840]   Palm Beach County.
[00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:42.960]   I can't stomach the idea of buying a house at current real estate prices.
[00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:50.560]   The value for the dollar, especially for someone like me whose income is not connected to geography,
[00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:53.560]   the value for the dollar is so low.
[00:25:53.560 --> 00:26:01.160]   The prices in our local area have increased so significantly on cost of living that it's
[00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:03.080]   hard to see the value.
[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:08.440]   The local culture, it's hard to want to commit to purchasing a house in the local
[00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:16.320]   culture just given the constraints of Palm Beach County and the uniqueness of where it
[00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:20.040]   is and what is happening in the local area.
[00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:24.560]   And in looking at the rental market, it's hard to see the value in the rental market.
[00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:29.880]   It's a little bit stomach twisting for me to think about what's available in the local
[00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:32.000]   market at the current prices.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:38.440]   That said, I don't have any clear indication that we should move or that we want to move
[00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:39.920]   to any other place.
[00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:45.120]   And so it's kind of been in a limbo, a place of limbo for us in many ways.
[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:48.700]   Our reasons for living in Palm Beach County have never been financial.
[00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:53.640]   Financial for me is secondary consideration as I'm sure it is for you.
[00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:57.120]   You can move to the cheapest place in the world, but you're going to be there for some
[00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:59.000]   reason other than financial.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:05.800]   I found – I was recently looking at a traveler who was showing videos of an apartment that
[00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:10.760]   you can rent in Togo for $20 a month.
[00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:18.200]   This would allow you to live on – with all costs of living, housing, food, everything,
[00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:21.960]   on nothing more than a few hundred dollars a month.
[00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:23.160]   But you're going to be living in Togo.
[00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:26.340]   Now, I've never been to Togo.
[00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:28.640]   Maybe someday I'll have the chance to go.
[00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:32.040]   And if you're in Togo, I'm so glad you're listening.
[00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:36.520]   But this particular apartment, I doubt that many of you would want to live in even though
[00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:38.000]   it's $20 a month.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.280]   So we don't choose where we live based just on finances.
[00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:45.820]   We choose where we live on other reasons and then we do a financial calculation and every
[00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:48.280]   place has advantages and disadvantages.
[00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:52.900]   I want to do a separate show on recognizing the resources of where you live.
[00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:57.560]   But it's important not to think that the grass is greener in another place.
[00:27:57.560 --> 00:28:01.760]   It's important to start by recognizing that everywhere you live, you have certain advantages
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:03.520]   and certain disadvantages.
[00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:06.680]   You live in the middle of Kansas on a giant farm.
[00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:10.360]   You have certain resources that are there that you don't have in other places.
[00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:16.440]   If you live in downtown Manhattan in a little bedroom – one-room apartment, you have certain
[00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:19.960]   resources that you don't have when you're in Kansas.
[00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:25.860]   So my reasons and our reasons for living in Palm Beach County have never been financial
[00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:28.360]   in analysis.
[00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:33.120]   Quite simply, for all of my adult life, I have been here in faith.
[00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:36.400]   I've had the faith that this is where God wanted us to be.
[00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:38.240]   I've lost that faith.
[00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:40.120]   But I also don't have faith to move anywhere.
[00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:47.120]   And so in the interim, we've decided to go and to travel and that has seemed to be
[00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:49.040]   the best course of action.
[00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:50.960]   Those are the primary reasons for traveling.
[00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:56.240]   Now let me go to the business reasons which is hopefully where we can connect with you.
[00:28:56.240 --> 00:29:01.280]   One of the major costs that I have learned is a major cost for me.
[00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:07.800]   Taking the path in entrepreneurship that I have taken has been the social isolation and
[00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:10.920]   this is reflected in a couple of ways.
[00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:17.600]   Number one, it's reflected in my actual ability to interact with listeners.
[00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:21.960]   I appreciate the interaction that I get but it's very different for me to be able to
[00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:29.400]   sit and talk with you face to face and to see you and to get your measure and for you
[00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:38.920]   to get mine in a face to face format versus at the other end of a digital point of communication.
[00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:45.200]   Now I'm so blessed that the vast majority of my interactions with you have been positive
[00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:49.400]   and I hear your heart when I read your emails and your interactions.
[00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:55.160]   It's so helpful to me but it's still different and those types of interactions are often
[00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:56.160]   overwhelming to me.
[00:29:56.160 --> 00:30:01.720]   It's often so much that it's hard for me to emotionally commit to that whereas if I
[00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:04.760]   can see you face to face, it makes a big, big difference.
[00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:09.360]   The thing that I have most enjoyed over the years is meeting you when I've been out
[00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:11.080]   and about.
[00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:15.400]   When I've been out at an event or been out and you've come to South Florida and we've
[00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:19.920]   interacted, that makes all the difference in the world because it allows me to really
[00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:23.080]   – well, to see you.
[00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:24.800]   It makes all the difference in the world.
[00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:30.560]   The other thing that has been a major impact is the challenge of working alone in the sense
[00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:37.000]   of as a solopreneur as they're often called and also just working physically alone in
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   my house.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.920]   There are challenges to both of those.
[00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:49.800]   When I – for all of my adult life, I desired to have a business and a job where I could
[00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:56.460]   do my work alone from my house with nothing more than a laptop computer.
[00:30:56.460 --> 00:30:59.480]   That was a goal of mine since high school.
[00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:06.200]   Now it took a circuitous path for me to accomplish it but I have accomplished it.
[00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:11.360]   I was naive in thinking that it was without its own challenges.
[00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:16.000]   I thought that it was always going to be great and I had some opportunities along the way
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:21.680]   where I learned that it wasn't necessarily as great as I thought it was going to be.
[00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:27.480]   But working entirely alone, physically alone over the last few years has confirmed that
[00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:30.240]   it's very, very challenging to do.
[00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:32.760]   It's challenging in the ebb and flow of my house.
[00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:38.920]   It's very challenging to be working at home in this mixture of being available versus
[00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:40.460]   not being available.
[00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:46.040]   There is a great, great benefit for men to be able to go out of the house, a great benefit
[00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:47.880]   for my wife for me to be out of the house.
[00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:52.560]   This is a great benefit for me to go out to an external location which of course I could
[00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:53.560]   do.
[00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:58.520]   I could rent an office and I've investigated and considered doing that at different times
[00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:01.440]   but it hasn't seemed the right path.
[00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:02.440]   But in the future, I think I will.
[00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:06.720]   I think I need an office that is physically outside of my house in order for me to be
[00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:09.240]   the most effective and the most productive.
[00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:13.440]   The second thing that's challenging is working alone without the presence of physical co-workers.
[00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:20.240]   It makes my – when you lack physical co-workers and I have virtual co-workers that work with
[00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:26.560]   me but when you lack physical co-workers, it makes it very challenging to get a sense
[00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:31.680]   of the value of your ideas and to weigh them accurately.
[00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:33.920]   I am an idea person.
[00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:38.340]   I have dozens of what I think are brilliant ideas on a daily basis.
[00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:43.920]   The challenge is to filter those ideas effectively and narrow them down and then to stay committed
[00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:48.280]   to the ones that are truly going to be the most effective.
[00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:54.680]   This is very challenging without a team to help, without a team of people who have other
[00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:57.960]   ideas and who can say, "Well, that's a good idea but that's not a good idea for
[00:32:57.960 --> 00:32:59.520]   right now."
[00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:03.520]   I frequently – my mouth overloads me again and again and again and I've learned to
[00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:08.680]   be more careful with it after falling through on some of my ideas.
[00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:10.400]   I keep most of them to myself.
[00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:15.720]   I've learned tools of challenging my ideas but still, it's very challenging to do alone.
[00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:22.120]   So I either have to – in the future with my business, I either have to build a team
[00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:28.520]   of people who can help me with that feedback, who can help me with that accountability in
[00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:33.360]   the sense of following through on the ones that are the best and who can help me with
[00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:34.360]   that perspective.
[00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:40.200]   It's very easy for me to get lost in my own head and to lose perspective on what's
[00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:44.040]   actually important, what's actually useful.
[00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:49.560]   I was speaking with an advisor of mine the other day and we were talking about this and
[00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:54.600]   he was bringing it back to the action orientation and his comment to me was, "Joshua, let's
[00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:58.320]   talk about how effective are you with helping people take action."
[00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:02.840]   This is I think one of the major challenges that I've recognized that I'm not as effective
[00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:05.720]   as I want to be at helping people take action.
[00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:10.200]   I am intensely philosophical as a person and I think a lot about the philosophy and I get
[00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:16.080]   excited about ideas less than I get – more than I get excited about actions.
[00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:23.160]   The example that I gave to my business advisor was I said, "I am profoundly intrigued by
[00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:27.200]   weird topics that have no relevance to my audience.
[00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:36.840]   I am – I was writing this outline for gold and silver investing one time for a course
[00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:39.960]   that I want to teach on gold and silver investing.
[00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:44.800]   So I went through and I researched all the laws on which types of gold coins and silver
[00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:51.040]   coins can be purchased in which ways with reporting to the US national government and
[00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:57.840]   which can be bought privately, which can be sold privately and all of these weird, arcane,
[00:34:57.840 --> 00:34:59.960]   totally impractical ideas."
[00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:04.520]   Now I was thoroughly enjoyed that process of figuring out how to unlock that little
[00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:05.520]   nut.
[00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:14.480]   I thought that was so interesting and so fun but it has zero practical value for 99.9%
[00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:17.840]   of you.
[00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:21.280]   And so I need someone often to keep me accountable and say, "Joshua, how are you giving something
[00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:22.760]   that's action?"
[00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:26.360]   And so I want to continue to develop that because I'm not – I don't want to just
[00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:30.640]   talk to make myself feel good or just talk to explore interesting concepts that I think
[00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:31.640]   are interesting.
[00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:32.640]   I'm here for a purpose.
[00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:34.080]   I'm here to make a difference.
[00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:35.200]   I want to make a difference in your life.
[00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:41.040]   I want to help you with the knowledge, skills, insight and encouragement that you need to
[00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:47.800]   actually practically, actionably live a rich and meaningful life now and actually practically,
[00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:52.280]   actionably build and execute on a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:54.080]   That's my mission.
[00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:55.480]   And so I need that feedback.
[00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:57.000]   I need those feedback mechanisms.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:58.480]   Now there are many ways it can be done.
[00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:01.720]   I have people who help me with that, who help me with that feedback, who give me a good
[00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:05.440]   slap in the face when I need it and say, "Joshua, wrong direction."
[00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:06.680]   That's really helpful.
[00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:10.680]   But what I want to do more of is I want to interact with you.
[00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:13.760]   And so what we've decided at this point is we're going to do some traveling and
[00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:17.600]   we're going to integrate some of our personal goals and also some of the business goals.
[00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:23.320]   And we want to accomplish as we travel some business plans.
[00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:25.040]   So here's what we have planned.
[00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:30.880]   During 2018, we will be traveling the country for an extended period of time.
[00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:33.520]   I'm thinking spring, summer and fall.
[00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:35.760]   But we are not on any tight schedule.
[00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:40.280]   We'll put all of our things at home and in storage so that the future is not committed
[00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:45.000]   to – we don't have any specific dates that we want to specifically come back to.
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:48.840]   And in fact, in order to be able to survive this adventure, which I will share with you,
[00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:53.920]   one of our strategies for surviving it at our current stage of family life is to have
[00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:59.600]   a very small number of commitments on dates.
[00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:00.600]   Give you two examples.
[00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:05.760]   We'll give you an example of what I'm saying.
[00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:11.880]   As we travel, it's important that we be able to enjoy the day-to-day function of our
[00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:17.600]   family, that we're able to enjoy the day-to-day reality of travel, the place that we happen
[00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:21.520]   to be, to interact with the people with whom we come in contact.
[00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:26.960]   But I also have many commitments to you, to work with you from a business perspective.
[00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:32.560]   And my primary commitment is to work with you in this way, in this digital format.
[00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:37.160]   I'm not trying to say I'm going to stop doing all of the digital work that I do and
[00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:40.400]   move it to entirely physical.
[00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:46.120]   My primary focus is digital because digital interaction allows a scalability that is not
[00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:49.760]   possible in other ways.
[00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:54.080]   But in order to survive that process, it's very important to us that we not be locked
[00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:56.440]   into a rigid schedule.
[00:37:56.440 --> 00:38:01.160]   So we will be going a few days at a time, planning at most a couple of weeks in advance,
[00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:08.280]   and be very much flowing with the ebb and flow of daily life rather than a big commitment
[00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:10.640]   of specific places to go.
[00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:16.720]   I could, for example, I could organize a tour of the United States with – we're going
[00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:21.200]   to do – here are the top 30 cities where I have listeners and I'm going to do a seminar
[00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:25.800]   in the top 30 and interact with you in that format and schedule it all out months in advance.
[00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:29.800]   That could be done very profitably and very effectively.
[00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:33.560]   That's not something that I wish to engage in at this point in time because of the simple
[00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:37.960]   stress of hitting those dates and committing to those dates and doing that.
[00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:40.360]   I don't have any interest in that.
[00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:43.240]   But we will be traveling and along the way I'll be working with you continually here.
[00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:48.480]   You as a listener will notice very little change in what I'm doing with you.
[00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:52.760]   However, along the way, I am going to interact with a lot of people who I've wanted to
[00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:54.360]   connect with in person.
[00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:59.380]   I want to record and find more interesting stories for you, more interesting interviews
[00:38:59.380 --> 00:39:01.960]   with people who are doing interesting things.
[00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:05.160]   I like to do those digitally and I will continue.
[00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:07.720]   I haven't canceled interviews on Radical Personal Finance.
[00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:09.480]   I've just canceled them for the last few months.
[00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:11.680]   They will be back in the future.
[00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:15.480]   But I also do them in person and I want to do – I want to learn how to do a little
[00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:19.680]   bit more effective storytelling with some different audio techniques as I'm able to.
[00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:24.520]   I want to bring you interesting stories and interesting interviews with the type of person
[00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:28.760]   who is unlikely to easily appear in a digital format.
[00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:34.880]   I believe this is a major missing piece in the modern world.
[00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:39.920]   There are so many people who come out and run the podcast circuit.
[00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:43.840]   But this tends to be a certain type of person.
[00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:47.280]   The people who come out and run the podcast circuit and get on all the personal finance
[00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:51.280]   podcast tend to be younger rather than older.
[00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:57.960]   They tend to be very tech savvy and they tend to have a one way of thinking about it.
[00:39:57.960 --> 00:40:03.380]   But financial independence and financial freedom is not fully populated by this person only.
[00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:06.140]   You may get that impression because that's all you hear.
[00:40:06.140 --> 00:40:11.320]   But the reason you hear that is because that's the type of person who is interested in promoting
[00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:13.280]   themselves and their work.
[00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:18.480]   For example, a blogger who is promoting their personal finance blog is much more likely
[00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:24.200]   to appear on a personal finance podcast than the wealthy independent person three doors
[00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:28.040]   down from you that you've never talked to about money because they have something to
[00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:32.040]   promote or the person who is promoting their course or their product or their service or
[00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:35.380]   their financial work or whatever it is.
[00:40:35.380 --> 00:40:38.060]   They have an incentive to appear on a podcast.
[00:40:38.060 --> 00:40:41.920]   Very few people want to expose the personal details of their life and very few people
[00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:46.520]   want to go and be interviewed on a show like mine unless there's some personal benefit
[00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:47.720]   for them.
[00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:54.000]   So the second thing is they tend to be from one stream, this type of person who is doing
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.640]   it.
[00:40:56.640 --> 00:41:00.880]   So that's why there's kind of a sameness to many of the types of guests that we get.
[00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:04.720]   But there are so many other interesting people out there.
[00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:09.080]   There are interesting people with interesting stories to share.
[00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:14.720]   My grandparents on both sides of my family were financially independent in a way that
[00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:17.800]   many people are financially independent.
[00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:21.080]   On the one side, my grandfather was a schoolteacher.
[00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:24.120]   He taught school and he taught at the college level.
[00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:28.360]   My grandmother was a schoolteacher, taught at the primary and secondary level.
[00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:32.720]   As teachers, they developed teachers' pensions and they had income and they were financially
[00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:35.960]   independent and retired based largely upon their teachers' pensions.
[00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:40.880]   I had a number of clients who were financially independent upon teachers' pensions.
[00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:45.400]   That's a very viable way to path towards financial independence but you don't hear a lot of that
[00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:47.520]   on a podcast.
[00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:51.200]   Those types of people have an interesting way of progressing forward.
[00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:54.720]   I've shared before the stories about my grandfather who was a teacher.
[00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:59.480]   He retired three or four times but every time he retired, he found that it wasn't for him.
[00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:03.480]   He worked until his mid-80s and when he did finally retire, that was a major mistake because
[00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:06.200]   then he got old and sick and he died 10 years later.
[00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:10.080]   But he was old and sick along the way in a way that if he kept working, if he figured
[00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:13.460]   out ways for him to continue working, he wouldn't have been old and sick.
[00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:16.960]   Those are the stories of your neighbors.
[00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:19.800]   That's a very accessible story for you.
[00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:24.000]   Now on the flip side, my other side of the family, my grandfather on the other side of
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.040]   my family was a farmer.
[00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:28.760]   Farmers have this interesting problem of financial independence.
[00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:32.200]   They can become wealthy but all their wealth is illiquid.
[00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:33.440]   It's basically tied up in land.
[00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:37.640]   The way the farming business works, at least traditionally, is you work so you can make
[00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:39.360]   the payments to the bank.
[00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:41.920]   But in terms of lifestyle, there's a difference of lifestyle.
[00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:47.440]   It can be financially lucrative or financially non-lucrative but there are independence of
[00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:48.920]   lifestyles.
[00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:53.840]   Those are the types of stories that are harder to get without going and getting them in person.
[00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:56.040]   So I want to bring you some of those interesting stories.
[00:42:56.040 --> 00:43:03.480]   I also want to interact with you both collectively and individually.
[00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:06.680]   As we travel, we'll do a number of small meetups.
[00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:11.040]   I'll announce those from time to time and we'll do them very informally.
[00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:15.440]   I'm not interested in trying to build something where we have giant events with hundreds of
[00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:16.440]   people.
[00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:21.880]   I don't enjoy being with hundreds of people all at once.
[00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:24.300]   It takes a lot of energy to do that well.
[00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:28.280]   But I love to sit and talk with half a dozen of you or a dozen.
[00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:29.280]   That's my favorite.
[00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:32.360]   So I'll share with you from time to time where we're going to be and we'll have some informal
[00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:35.720]   meetups and if you can come and meet me and hang out with me and my family, we'd love
[00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:36.840]   to do that.
[00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:41.960]   In addition to that, I'd love to schedule some small seminars along the way.
[00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:47.240]   What I would think would be really effective is to get together for about a day and I have
[00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:51.440]   various curricula that I've developed that on various topics.
[00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:56.200]   Just to get together for about a day and give you a one-day boot camp on a particular area
[00:43:56.200 --> 00:44:02.040]   of finance, whether this is from a planning perspective, whether it's from a technical
[00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:03.360]   perspective, etc.
[00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:08.640]   And then give extensive time to Q&A and give extensive time to interacting with you personally,
[00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:13.080]   working on some of your personal problems to help you develop a roadmap to that.
[00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:18.320]   So I'd love to schedule some one-day seminars along the way and I think that would be really,
[00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:21.120]   really, really, really productive.
[00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:25.360]   What it would also help me to do is that feedback of what's actionable and what's not helps
[00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:32.680]   me to edit the type of ideas that I share with you here on the podcast to make them
[00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:34.880]   more actionable.
[00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:39.320]   There's a place for philosophy and there's a place for action.
[00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:45.680]   Over the years, I was deeply frustrated with other commentators' obsessive focus on action
[00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:49.400]   and I felt like somebody should articulate the philosophy a little bit better.
[00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:51.360]   I've done that in many areas, trust me.
[00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:54.680]   You haven't even scratched the surface of it in other areas.
[00:44:54.680 --> 00:44:57.840]   But I've gone too far in the direction of philosophy and not enough in the direction
[00:44:57.840 --> 00:44:58.840]   of action.
[00:44:58.840 --> 00:45:04.080]   And I want to adjust that and come back to that balance that has been missing in some
[00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:07.460]   of my personal work because I want to hold those together.
[00:45:07.460 --> 00:45:10.400]   If you only have philosophy, you got a problem.
[00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:12.760]   If you only have action, I think you've got a problem.
[00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:20.400]   But action buttressed by philosophy, to me, that's the most powerful.
[00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:21.800]   So that's our outline.
[00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:27.840]   In short, we're not going on this particular trip that we have planned simply for personal
[00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:31.480]   reasons of sightseeing, although we look forward to much sightseeing.
[00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:35.800]   We're not going on this personal trip simply for the purposes of visiting our own friends
[00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:39.400]   and family, although we look forward to visiting our friends and family that we've wanted to
[00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:40.740]   interact with.
[00:45:40.740 --> 00:45:45.760]   We're not going on this trip simply to interact with you, whether that happens individually
[00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:48.800]   or in a group format, although we look forward to that.
[00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:55.680]   We're not going on this trip simply to do seminars and make money on the way through
[00:45:55.680 --> 00:46:02.280]   doing a one or two-day seminar with you, although we look forward to doing that as well.
[00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:06.580]   But on the whole, the combining of all these things together has come together in a way
[00:46:06.580 --> 00:46:08.240]   that I think we're really excited about.
[00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:11.040]   So we're going to be doing the grand tour of 2018.
[00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:20.440]   Now, as I go, a few comments about how you can help and exactly what we'll be doing.
[00:46:20.440 --> 00:46:27.960]   I haven't decided the extent to which I will share with you everything that we're doing.
[00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:30.640]   It will probably be in the middle.
[00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:36.920]   I won't keep – I won't relate all of the work of Radical Personal Finance to our traveling.
[00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:40.360]   To me, that would be counterproductive and it would cost me in terms of the things that
[00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:41.600]   I want to accomplish.
[00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:46.600]   But I'll also not share everything that we're doing and everywhere we're going simply because
[00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:51.600]   that's a very stressful way to live and my family's privacy is important to us.
[00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:55.760]   So I will share with you here on the show and in other venues what we're doing and
[00:46:55.760 --> 00:47:02.040]   the types of things that we're doing, but it won't be totally digitally available to
[00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:03.040]   you.
[00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:04.520]   What I would like you to do is follow along.
[00:47:04.520 --> 00:47:05.640]   I hope you enjoy the adventure.
[00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:11.560]   I know that many of you have shared with me that you enjoy a little bit of the personal
[00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:14.360]   finance discussion, the financial planning context.
[00:47:14.360 --> 00:47:17.320]   But what you most enjoy is hearing a little bit about our story and I've tried from the
[00:47:17.320 --> 00:47:22.560]   beginning to share with you very transparently the good and the bad so that you can learn
[00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:26.680]   from our good example and from our bad example.
[00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:29.620]   But what I would like you to do is share with me a few things.
[00:47:29.620 --> 00:47:35.140]   Number one, and the format for reaching me is either to use the contact form on the website
[00:47:35.140 --> 00:47:38.720]   or email me, joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com.
[00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:43.920]   Please in your note put in that email either in the body of the email or in the subject
[00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:49.560]   line use the hashtag #2018roadtrip, so 2018 road trip for me.
[00:47:49.560 --> 00:47:52.760]   That will help me to filter and to collect things from the spam filter.
[00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:58.720]   It'll also help me to organize the communication on this topic with me.
[00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:03.840]   But here are the things that I would love for you to take a moment and provide me feedback.
[00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:08.800]   Number one, if you know of an interesting story, an interesting person or an interesting
[00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:16.200]   thing that you would like me to see and to do, then let me know about that.
[00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:17.960]   Let me just give you one example.
[00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:25.960]   For years I've intended to interview the urban farming guys from downtown Kansas City.
[00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:33.200]   Their story, a group of families who I think were originally connected if my research is
[00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:36.680]   correct, I think they were originally connected through a church in Olathe.
[00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:42.360]   A group of families decided that they would move into the inner city in Kansas City to
[00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:49.880]   one of the poorest, most crime-ridden neighborhoods in inner city Kansas City.
[00:48:49.880 --> 00:48:55.680]   They moved there intentionally and they started living there and they started working to bring
[00:48:55.680 --> 00:48:58.520]   new resources to that local community.
[00:48:58.520 --> 00:48:59.660]   They lived in the community.
[00:48:59.660 --> 00:49:01.720]   Some of them worked outside of the community.
[00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:06.760]   They started to build urban gardening and urban farming initiatives.
[00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:12.880]   They began working with various types of new – some of the modern farming technology
[00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:16.680]   that's been developed, whether it's aquaponics and some of the other things that are really
[00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:17.760]   intriguing.
[00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:24.640]   They built a maker space, a large workshop for the community and they've just started
[00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:26.900]   trying to meet the needs of the community.
[00:49:26.900 --> 00:49:28.280]   Over time, more families moved in.
[00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:31.840]   They bought more property and they bulldozed some old houses.
[00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:36.880]   They fixed up other houses and they really have made a tremendous difference in there
[00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:39.260]   in the local community.
[00:49:39.260 --> 00:49:44.920]   So such – and a tremendous difference on some of the metrics, the measurable difference
[00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:48.560]   in crime in the local area as well, etc.
[00:49:48.560 --> 00:49:50.240]   I'd love to go and visit those guys.
[00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:51.880]   I've been wanting to get them on the show for years.
[00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:53.040]   I just haven't gotten around to it.
[00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:55.600]   I have hundreds of people on my list of people to interview.
[00:49:55.600 --> 00:50:00.040]   I'd love to go and visit those guys and see with my own eyes what has happened because
[00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:02.360]   it's one thing to hear from somebody.
[00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:03.480]   It's another thing to see.
[00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:07.520]   I want to see those types of things that are happening because these are the ways that
[00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:10.520]   individuals can make a difference.
[00:50:10.520 --> 00:50:16.960]   I get so tired of the collectivism in the US American culture, the idea that you have
[00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:23.560]   to go and start some big organization or get some government initiative to make a difference.
[00:50:23.560 --> 00:50:24.560]   You don't.
[00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:29.000]   That's the worst way to go about it in my opinion generally for most problems.
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:30.400]   Collectivism doesn't work.
[00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:33.240]   Going and trying to get your favorite politician in will not work.
[00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:35.000]   It will not make a difference.
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:44.360]   What does make a difference is you and your friends choosing something wrong in your area,
[00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:48.960]   whether that's a question of injustice that needs to be solved, a victim that needs to
[00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:53.680]   be defended so justice can be served, whether it's a specific problem that you see in
[00:50:53.680 --> 00:50:54.680]   your local area.
[00:50:54.680 --> 00:50:58.840]   That's what makes a difference is you as an individual saying, "I'm going to work
[00:50:58.840 --> 00:50:59.840]   on this problem."
[00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:04.160]   When you start working, a couple of your friends and your family will get involved and people
[00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:07.640]   will start to notice and things will change over time.
[00:51:07.640 --> 00:51:12.080]   I want to profile those types of stories because those things are important.
[00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:14.320]   I want to see big changes happen.
[00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:17.560]   I don't just want to see you and me get rich.
[00:51:17.560 --> 00:51:21.840]   I want to see communities continue to be transformed.
[00:51:21.840 --> 00:51:26.800]   But collective government action is not going to make the difference.
[00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:31.560]   More welfare programs will do nothing but drive more and more people into poverty.
[00:51:31.560 --> 00:51:36.960]   A higher minimum wage will do nothing more than result in higher unemployment as it always
[00:51:36.960 --> 00:51:37.960]   has done.
[00:51:37.960 --> 00:51:42.880]   I'm sick and tired of seeing the people and the communities that are impacted by this
[00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:43.880]   negatively.
[00:51:43.880 --> 00:51:47.520]   I'm not going to start on that.
[00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:48.520]   I get tired of it.
[00:51:48.520 --> 00:51:49.520]   So I want to see those things.
[00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:50.800]   You know of something interesting.
[00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:55.320]   You know of somebody who's doing something really impactful, a cool work, a cool person,
[00:51:55.320 --> 00:51:59.820]   especially if they're the kind of person who doesn't often get media attention.
[00:51:59.820 --> 00:52:02.400]   I'm not interested in having newspaper stories written about people.
[00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:06.080]   I want to do real – I want to expose you to their story.
[00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:08.880]   So if it's the type of – if you know of something that we'd like to be – that
[00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:12.240]   you think would make for good interaction, please tell me about it.
[00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:13.880]   Write me an email and tell me about it.
[00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:14.880]   Tell me where it is.
[00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:16.200]   Put the city and the town in there.
[00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:20.320]   If possible, put it in the subject line or right up front so I can organize things.
[00:52:20.320 --> 00:52:23.720]   And then describe to me a little bit about the person that you know or the project that
[00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:27.880]   you know of or the initiative that you know of and pique my interest on it.
[00:52:27.880 --> 00:52:32.360]   So I'll put those things on our travel schedule as we can fit them in.
[00:52:32.360 --> 00:52:36.400]   I'll look for those interesting stories and try to shine a light on them, whether
[00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:39.200]   it's in an audio format, whether it's in writing.
[00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:43.160]   I don't know whether it's in video.
[00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:45.680]   As I'm able to, I'll try to shine a light on them.
[00:52:45.680 --> 00:52:49.800]   For you to know about them and for you to take those ideas and to look in your own local
[00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:50.800]   area.
[00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:54.080]   If you know of an interesting story, let me know.
[00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:57.680]   No matter where in the country it is, just write to me and let me know.
[00:52:57.680 --> 00:53:03.400]   If you would like to see me and my family along the way, write to me and let me know.
[00:53:03.400 --> 00:53:06.280]   Again, use the hashtag #2018RoadTrip and let us know.
[00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:12.980]   If you'd like to invite us to come and to see you and stay with you, we'd be happy
[00:53:12.980 --> 00:53:14.640]   to consider doing that.
[00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:15.640]   We are self-contained.
[00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:21.120]   I have a 30-foot travel trailer and a pickup truck, so probably about a 50-foot long rig
[00:53:21.120 --> 00:53:22.120]   total.
[00:53:22.120 --> 00:53:23.280]   So just need a place to park that.
[00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:25.120]   But let us know.
[00:53:25.120 --> 00:53:30.800]   If you'd like to invite us to come and say, "Hey, come and see us and stay with us,"
[00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:38.160]   most likely the answer will be we'd love to, but we're obviously not going to be
[00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:39.160]   there.
[00:53:39.160 --> 00:53:42.760]   But I'd love to know where you are and I'd be happy to interact with you personally.
[00:53:42.760 --> 00:53:48.920]   If you would be interested in getting together with me for something like a one-day seminar,
[00:53:48.920 --> 00:53:50.400]   let me know that and how I would do it.
[00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:52.560]   Let me just give you an idea of how I would do it.
[00:53:52.560 --> 00:53:57.260]   Number one, I have structures of things that I can teach.
[00:53:57.260 --> 00:54:03.000]   When I go to – I have a portfolio of speeches and outlines that I developed over the years.
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:06.680]   And so when I'm asked to speak to an event, I spoke to a Kiwanis club recently, I just
[00:54:06.680 --> 00:54:10.100]   go and I say, "OK, what can I put together that's a 20-minute version?"
[00:54:10.100 --> 00:54:12.000]   And everything is infinitely expandable or contractible.
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:14.320]   So we can take a 20-minute version or the two-day version.
[00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:18.360]   Just depends on how deep down the rabbit hole you want to get on a subject.
[00:54:18.360 --> 00:54:26.800]   But what I'm anticipating is I would deliver to you something like a half-a-day seminar
[00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:28.920]   on prepared outlines.
[00:54:28.920 --> 00:54:31.280]   And then if I were – let's say I'm in Kansas City and I say we're going to do
[00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:36.120]   a Kansas City seminar, I'll write you an email before that and I'll – let's
[00:54:36.120 --> 00:54:37.720]   say 20 people are going to come.
[00:54:37.720 --> 00:54:41.400]   I'll write you an email to the 20 of you who are in Kansas City who are going to come
[00:54:41.400 --> 00:54:43.800]   to a one-day seminar and ask what questions you want to talk about.
[00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:44.800]   We'll work that in.
[00:54:44.800 --> 00:54:50.520]   There will be an extensive amount of time to interact, ask your questions, et cetera.
[00:54:50.520 --> 00:54:52.000]   I'll charge you for it.
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:55:00.160]   I don't wish to try to deliver high-priced seminars but I also wish to not deliver low-priced
[00:55:00.160 --> 00:55:01.160]   seminars.
[00:55:01.160 --> 00:55:11.000]   So I'm thinking something like a couple hundred bucks in that range to come to a one-day seminar.
[00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:14.680]   Schedules are to be determined at this point in time but that's about what I'm thinking.
[00:55:14.680 --> 00:55:19.840]   That gives me room enough to make it worth my while to find a facility and to make it
[00:55:19.840 --> 00:55:24.040]   worth my while financially for me to disrupt other schedules for that seminar.
[00:55:24.040 --> 00:55:27.480]   So if you would be interested in coming to a seminar, write to me and let me know and
[00:55:27.480 --> 00:55:30.240]   let me know the kinds of things that you would enjoy learning or the kinds of things you
[00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:32.120]   would most like to see in that.
[00:55:32.120 --> 00:55:36.880]   And based upon audience feedback, I will look forward to putting that together.
[00:55:36.880 --> 00:55:44.320]   And finally – well, before finally, depending on the number of responses I get with interest
[00:55:44.320 --> 00:55:47.320]   in a seminar, I will adjust our travel schedule accordingly.
[00:55:47.320 --> 00:55:49.400]   Let's say I'm going through North Carolina.
[00:55:49.400 --> 00:55:53.280]   I will come to Charlotte and spend some time in Charlotte where I might otherwise avoid
[00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:54.280]   the city.
[00:55:54.280 --> 00:55:56.440]   Not that there's anything wrong with Charlotte.
[00:55:56.440 --> 00:55:58.440]   I've just been there many times.
[00:55:58.440 --> 00:56:00.840]   But I'd be happy to come to Charlotte and do a seminar in Charlotte if a bunch of you
[00:56:00.840 --> 00:56:01.840]   are in that area.
[00:56:01.840 --> 00:56:08.200]   I will look at that geographic location and try to communicate with you on that.
[00:56:08.200 --> 00:56:13.760]   One thing in terms of expectations, I have no idea how many listeners will write to me
[00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:14.760]   or not.
[00:56:14.760 --> 00:56:15.760]   I have no idea.
[00:56:15.760 --> 00:56:16.760]   It could be a handful.
[00:56:16.760 --> 00:56:18.840]   It could be many hundreds.
[00:56:18.840 --> 00:56:23.320]   But I would just simply caution you and I'm sure you know this but I do think it's important
[00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:24.320]   to say.
[00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:29.200]   If I say, "Thank you so much for the invitation but we can't come, please in advance determine
[00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:31.440]   not to be offended by that."
[00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:35.200]   I am – we have not yet decided our travel schedule.
[00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:37.400]   Now it may be that we're not coming to Maine.
[00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:39.600]   I don't have any intention to come to Maine right now.
[00:56:39.600 --> 00:56:42.640]   Although I have been to Maine and I think Maine is a great place.
[00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:44.720]   We don't have any intention of coming to Maine but I may come – who knows?
[00:56:44.720 --> 00:56:46.400]   I may come there in the future.
[00:56:46.400 --> 00:56:47.880]   So I'd love to hear from you.
[00:56:47.880 --> 00:56:51.040]   If you'd like to just write me a short note, it can be as short or as long as you want.
[00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:52.280]   But I would love to hear from you.
[00:56:52.280 --> 00:56:55.320]   But just please know that two things.
[00:56:55.320 --> 00:56:57.360]   I of course won't be able to come everywhere.
[00:56:57.360 --> 00:57:01.640]   I of course won't be able to respond to every kind of invitation.
[00:57:01.640 --> 00:57:07.840]   And number two, expect me not to commit very far in advance because in order to make this
[00:57:07.840 --> 00:57:11.560]   particular approach work the way that my wife and I want to make it work, I will not be
[00:57:11.560 --> 00:57:14.000]   making commitments long in advance.
[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:16.520]   I'm not going to say, "Here's where we'll be in June."
[00:57:16.520 --> 00:57:22.360]   In June, we'll see where we are and we'll be adjusting the pace of our travel as we
[00:57:22.360 --> 00:57:23.360]   go through it.
[00:57:23.360 --> 00:57:27.920]   That's the whole point of an RV is not to be locked into a specific schedule where I've
[00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:31.560]   got to hit these marks that are scheduled out.
[00:57:31.560 --> 00:57:35.680]   If it were just me traveling by myself, that type of travel is no problem.
[00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:38.520]   You can sketch out your marks and I would tell you four months in advance.
[00:57:38.520 --> 00:57:43.040]   But that would destroy me at this point trying to hit that type of schedule.
[00:57:43.040 --> 00:57:44.040]   That would be so stressful.
[00:57:44.040 --> 00:57:49.040]   I probably wouldn't even embark on that type of trip at this point.
[00:57:49.040 --> 00:57:51.380]   And that my friends is all I wanted to share with you for today.
[00:57:51.380 --> 00:57:52.600]   So I invite you to write to me.
[00:57:52.600 --> 00:57:57.720]   Use the hashtag #2018roadtripplease so I can organize your note.
[00:57:57.720 --> 00:57:59.120]   But pique my interest.
[00:57:59.120 --> 00:58:00.420]   Pique my interest on your story.
[00:58:00.420 --> 00:58:03.120]   If you'd like to be on the show, tell me a little bit about your story.
[00:58:03.120 --> 00:58:06.920]   Pique my interest about your neighbor next door or the guy down the road that has a cool
[00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:11.080]   story but who would be the kind of person who would be unlikely to want to come on a
[00:58:11.080 --> 00:58:12.080]   podcast.
[00:58:12.080 --> 00:58:14.040]   I'll bring you shows from a campground.
[00:58:14.040 --> 00:58:18.640]   I mean, tell you what, there are a lot of wealthy, financially independent people traveling
[00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:19.640]   the country.
[00:58:19.640 --> 00:58:22.480]   I'll bring you some of their stories from the local campground.
[00:58:22.480 --> 00:58:24.920]   If you'd like to come to a seminar, let me know that.
[00:58:24.920 --> 00:58:27.480]   If you'd just like to see us, let me know that.
[00:58:27.480 --> 00:58:32.440]   Write to me, joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com or use the contact form in the website.
[00:58:32.440 --> 00:58:36.800]   My wife and I are very excited, very much looking forward to this trip and I will, of
[00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:41.840]   course, share it with you here and more in other formats as well.
[00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:42.960]   Thank you for listening.
[00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:45.200]   It's an honor and I do pledge this to you.
[00:58:45.200 --> 00:58:54.400]   My commitment to you is primarily to you, not in person but to you who give me the honor
[00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:57.320]   of your time and attention for many hours.
[00:58:57.320 --> 00:59:04.060]   I will be here to continue to serve you in this format for many days in the future.
