[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.840]   get your credit report, look at your credit.
[00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:04.840]   Don't just say, "I got my credit report.
[00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.600]   "I did my good deed."
[00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.200]   Get it, review it, and make sure that it says
[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.620]   what you think it should say.
[00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:17.320]   And if it has additional dates of birth out there for you,
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.640]   or different places where you've never worked,
[00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.760]   or different home addresses, these are red flags.
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.760]   So get your credit report, monitor your credit scores.
[00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.400]   Because if your credit scores take a sudden precipitous drop
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.280]   that you can't explain,
[00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.240]   then it's either one of three reasons.
[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.880]   You didn't pay a bill on time, not good,
[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.520]   you need to know that.
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.360]   You're using too much of your available credit, not so good,
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.960]   you need to know that.
[00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.240]   Or you're a victim of identity theft, really not good,
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.560]   and you need to know that.
