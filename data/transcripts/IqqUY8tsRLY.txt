[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.200]   I should like to call your attention this morning to that portion of scripture that
[00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:13.600]   we read in the book of Revelation in the third chapter, from verse 14 to the end of the chapter,
[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:21.600]   which is of course the letter of the risen Lord to the church of the Laodiceans. I don't
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:30.200]   read any one verse again because obviously this is a letter that contains one big message.
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:36.000]   And it is right therefore that we should look at it as a whole. It's the last of these seven
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.520]   letters that are recorded in these two chapters, chapters two and three of the book of Revelation.
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:49.520]   Letters from the risen Lord to churches on earth. Now there is no doubt that originally
[00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:55.120]   these words were addressed to particular churches in the actual condition that they were in
[00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:01.920]   at the time. But, as has generally been agreed throughout the centuries, these letters are
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:10.220]   also addressed to the church in general, passing through different conditions and phases throughout
[00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:18.020]   the centuries. So that these letters are always of value and always of application. Between
[00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:25.020]   them they do indeed include most of the conditions through which the church has passed. And they
[00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:32.220]   even include in their message the varying conditions in actual churches at the present
[00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.520]   time. So that here we have messages that are always of vital importance to us and for us.
[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.420]   Now we've been trying the last two Sunday mornings and again this morning to look at
[00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.720]   the state and the condition of the Christian church at the present time. And when I say
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:53.020]   the church, I mean once more not only the church in general, but also each one of us
[00:01:53.020 --> 00:02:00.320]   as a particular and individual member of the Christian church. It's obvious from the state
[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.220]   of the world and from the state of the church herself that there is something wrong. The
[00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.820]   church is not functioning as she has done and as she should. And therefore our business
[00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:16.020]   is to discover what it is exactly that is wrong with us. And we've been already considering
[00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:23.320]   two explanations of this state and of this condition. And here this morning we come to
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:29.420]   yet another. And I take this particular letter not because it's the last, but because it
[00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:36.420]   does seem to me to be the one that speaks most directly to the condition of the Christian
[00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:42.220]   church at the present time. And as I understand it, and as I hope to show you, to the condition
[00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:49.220]   of the evangelical church at the present time. I think that that is the peculiar characteristic
[00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:55.320]   of this letter. And I want to open it out before you. It's one of the saddest of the
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:02.820]   seven letters, indeed probably the saddest of all. Our Lord has nothing to commend in
[00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:09.920]   connection with this church. It is a series of criticisms. It's spoken, I think, in sadness
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:15.220]   as he looks upon the state and the condition of this church. Well now the great question
[00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:22.920]   for us is this. Is this true of us or isn't it? This particular message, one that applies
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:29.020]   to us this morning. Well the only thing we can do is to heed our Lord's injunction
[00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:33.620]   at the end. He says, "He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the
[00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:41.320]   churches." Have we this sensitive ear? Can we hear? Let us pray that we may have our
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:48.320]   ears circumcised as it were in order that we may hear truly. Now as we come to consider
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:54.520]   the message, let us recall the one who is addressing us. "And to the angel of the
[00:03:54.520 --> 00:04:01.920]   church of the Laodiceans write, 'These things saith the Amen.'" The perfect one, the
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:09.720]   complete one, the one who is in and of himself everything, but he's also the faithful and
[00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:15.720]   true witness. There is nothing false in him. He said himself that he was the light, he
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:23.420]   is the truth, and he is truth, and he is light. And nothing wrong therefore, or nothing that
[00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:30.320]   is sham, or nothing that partakes of any kind of pretense is to be found in him. As we read
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:36.120]   his letter, let us remember who he is and that he desires truth in our inward paths.
[00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:41.320]   Let us remember that nothing is hidden from him, but all things are naked and open unto
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:47.420]   the eyes of him with whom we have to do. There is no possibility of any benefit in the Christian
[00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:54.720]   life, no improvement, unless we are honest and open and realize that we are indeed in
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:01.520]   the presence of this one who can describe himself accurately as the Amen, the first
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:07.620]   and the last, the beginning, the end, the sum of all truth, and one who is a faithful
[00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:13.920]   and a true witness. Now thank God that he is. He tells us the truth about ourselves,
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:21.320]   doesn't conceal anything, but just tells us exactly what the position is. But he demands
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:26.720]   the same kind of thing as we shall see of us. And he is the beginning of the creation
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:32.020]   of God, which means that everything has been handed to him, the universe and especially
[00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:38.320]   the church. He is the head of all things, to the church in particular, who is the fullness
[00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:45.020]   of him and filleth all and in all. Well now, it is very essential that we should realize
[00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:51.420]   all this, that we are not dealing with something therefore which is but human, or dealing with
[00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:56.520]   a human criticism or a human analysis. This is the wonderful thing about the church, that
[00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:02.120]   she is in such a relationship to the Lord that he deals directly with her. She is the
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:09.120]   bride of Christ. These are some of the pictures that are used. And he deigns to deal with
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:15.520]   us and to speak with us in this direct and immediate manner. Well now, what does he say
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:20.920]   to this church of the Laodiceans? And as I am asking that question, I ask you to carry
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:26.920]   in your minds the other question. Is this, I wonder, a true description of the church
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:33.920]   today? Is it true of us? Now, what does he describe as the state and the condition of
[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:39.120]   this church of the Laodiceans? That's the best starting point, perhaps. What was its
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:46.120]   condition? Well, he makes it perfectly clear. He says it's lukewarm. "I know thy works
[00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:54.920]   that thou art neither cold nor hot. I would that thou wert cold or hot. So then, because
[00:06:54.920 --> 00:07:03.120]   thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot, I am about to spill thee out of my mouth."
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:08.920]   Now, it's very important we should understand this state that he describes here. What is
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:14.720]   this state of lukewarmness? Well, as he defines it, and as we are familiar with the term,
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:21.720]   we know that it means this. You couldn't say that this church or its people were cold.
[00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:27.920]   They were not without interest. They were not altogether without feeling. You can't
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:36.120]   describe them as being like ice or cold, I suppose. That's not true. There was an element
[00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:42.720]   of warmth there. There was something there. He says they're not cold. And, of course,
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:49.720]   this was true of them, and it is true of all who are in this Laodicean condition. And this
[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:56.820]   is what makes this condition such a sad one and such a terrible one, and makes him speak
[00:07:56.820 --> 00:08:01.920]   as he does about his relationship to a church that continues in that state and condition.
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:07.320]   And remember, it's all equally applicable to any individual that is amongst us. Well,
[00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:11.320]   then, this is the first thing. You can't say they're cold. You can't say they're
[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:16.920]   lifeless. You can't say that there's nothing there. There is something there. But then,
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:23.120]   you see, the trouble is that they're not hot either. You can't describe it as real
[00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:31.920]   warmth. Well, it isn't cold, it isn't hot. There's just enough to say that it isn't
[00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:37.320]   cold, but there isn't enough to say that it's warm or that it's hot. What does this
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:44.920]   mean? Well, what it means is this. That there was no true emotion there. There was no true
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:54.420]   feeling. There was no true enthusiasm for the Lord and for his cause. Now, these people
[00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:59.720]   could be enthusiastic about other things, but there was none of that enthusiasm where
[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:05.220]   the Lord was concerned or where his work or where his kingdom was concerned. They're
[00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:10.520]   not cold, but they're not hot. What is this condition, then, as put in more modern terms?
[00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:20.720]   Well, it is, I would say, something like this. It is to be in a kind of sentimental condition.
[00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:26.320]   And that is the whole trouble with sentimentality. You can't say that the sentimental person
[00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:32.220]   is devoid of feeling, but you can say that the sentimental person knows nothing about
[00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:42.120]   true emotion. That is the difference between sentimentality and emotion. On the surface,
[00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:46.120]   it looks as if there is emotion, there's true feeling. But the moment you begin to
[00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:53.320]   analyze it, and especially put it up in contrast with a true emotion, you realize that it is
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:59.520]   not emotion at all. In other words, the condition of these people was that they were rather
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:07.320]   proud of the fact that they never went to extremes. They rather liked this. And this
[00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:13.820]   is a mentality with which we are very familiar, are we not? This has been a very popular idea
[00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:20.720]   as to how a man should be, the natural man should be. There are those who are always
[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:28.020]   contrasting themselves with people who are emotional, and they feel they always strike
[00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:34.420]   the happy medium. These people who are balanced, who never go to extremes, they're always
[00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:41.220]   polite, they're always controlled, they're always respectable. And they think that this
[00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:46.320]   indeed is almost the hallmark of perfection. But you see, it's a condition which our
[00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:52.720]   Lord reprobates. But it's very essential that we should be clear as to what he means
[00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:58.420]   by this definition. And I can't think of any better way of putting it than to say that
[00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:05.820]   it is just typical of what is called sentimentality. The sentimental person is anxious that we
[00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:11.420]   should realize that he's not denied a feeling. But on the other hand, he's equally anxious
[00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:19.420]   that we should know that he's not carried away by emotion. He's got it all, as it were,
[00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:24.420]   in this balanced condition which he regards as being ideal.
[00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:28.820]   Now our Lord reprobates this, as I say, and he says, "If you continue in this condition,
[00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:33.420]   I'll spill the out of my mouth." Why does he say this? Well, the answer is, of course,
[00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:39.720]   that in the end, I suppose, this is the greatest insult that we can ever offer to God. There
[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:49.320]   is an implicit insult in this controlled sentimental condition, which is neither hot nor cold.
[00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:57.620]   For, you see, it means this, that we are in control of the situation, and that we have
[00:11:57.620 --> 00:12:09.520]   decided that even in our relationship to God, we are still in charge. I've often heard people
[00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:15.520]   putting this unconsciously in words. They say it's very right, of course, to be religious,
[00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:21.120]   but you mustn't take it too seriously. You mustn't become an extremist, they say. It's
[00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:25.920]   all right, and we believe in doing this, but, you know, there's a limit after all. I remember
[00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:31.120]   a man once misquoting that statement of Paul in Philippians 4, "Let all your things be
[00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:36.920]   with moderation." And he was applying that to the Christian life. And the idea that these
[00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:43.020]   people have is this, that even in their very relationship to God, they're still always
[00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:50.720]   in control. They know nothing about being lost in wonder, love, and prayer. Now, they
[00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:55.420]   can get very excited about other things. They can be very moved by other things. They can
[00:12:55.420 --> 00:13:00.420]   be moved to tears by a play or by a drama. They can get excited and thrilled by football
[00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:06.520]   matches and other forms of sport, but they're never like that in connection with their religion.
[00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:11.120]   And they would almost feel ashamed if they ever did experience something like that. Their
[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:15.520]   great praise is, "Let everything be done decently and in order." Now, that's scriptural,
[00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:21.820]   but it doesn't refer to this. The fact that we do not believe in excesses does not mean
[00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:26.920]   that we are advocating lukewarmness. But this is the very great danger that so constantly
[00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:34.620]   afflicts a certain type of individual, a certain type of Christian person. In our horror and
[00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:42.620]   dread of excesses, we get into this state described here of the Laodiceans. And so,
[00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:47.620]   we are neither hot nor cold. You can't say that we are devoid of feeling, and yet there
[00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:54.020]   is no true emotion. There is none of this idea of being moved to the depth of our being
[00:13:54.020 --> 00:14:01.620]   and, as I say, being lost in wonder, love, and praise. In other words, it is respectability,
[00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:15.620]   a kind of mild feeling that does duty for true warmth, true richness, and true emotion.
[00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:20.620]   That's the statement which our Lord makes about the Church of the Laodiceans. That has
[00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:25.920]   been the condition of the Christian Church many a time since. Is it not the state and
[00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:30.620]   the condition of the Christian Church today? And I say, especially perhaps those of us
[00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:34.620]   who are evangelical, that this will become still more clear when I come to the second
[00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:40.620]   thing he says about them, which is that they were complacent and that they are self-satisfied.
[00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:46.620]   Because thou sayest, I am rich and increased with goods and of need of nothing. That's
[00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:52.620]   what they said about themselves. And they believed that this was true. Now this generally
[00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:59.120]   accompanies this lukewarm condition. It's a part of it. It's a further expression
[00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:06.120]   of that. You see, the moment you are in charge of your Christianity, this follows. This is
[00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:11.120]   the fatal thing, that we are in charge of it instead of it being in charge of us. That's
[00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:17.120]   the very essence of our Lord's diagnosis of this Church. Even their relationship to
[00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:23.620]   God and the Lord Jesus Christ was in their hand. And the result was, they were very pleased
[00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:29.120]   with themselves. They were very satisfied. They were not conscious of any lack. They
[00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:34.120]   were not conscious of any need. They felt that they've got everything in the realm
[00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:39.120]   of mind and understanding, in the realm of art, and in the realm of their wills, their
[00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:45.620]   conduct, their practice, and their behavior. What am I talking about? Well, I'm talking
[00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:50.120]   about this kind of person. There are some people who are completely satisfied because
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:55.120]   they're orthodox. You see, they can say that they're not curled. They're not like
[00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:59.620]   the liberal, the modernist men who denies the faith. And they're always denouncing
[00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:05.120]   it. There they are. They say, "How terrible." They contrast themselves with that. And they've
[00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:10.620]   got the truth. They're orthodox. They believe the right thing. So they're very pleased
[00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:16.120]   with themselves. And there they are, always guarding this, and dotting the I's, and crossing
[00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:23.120]   the T's. So they're not curled like those unbelievers. They know the truth, and they've
[00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:28.620]   got it, and they understand it, and they possess it. And they're very pleased with themselves
[00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:34.120]   as guardians and custodians of the faith. But then you see, on the other hand, they're
[00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:38.620]   very pleased with themselves because they're not wild also. They say, "Look at those
[00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:44.620]   wild people, those enthusiasts. Look at those people who are always getting so excited."
[00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:52.620]   They're not like that. No, no, they're always controlled. Now, all this, as you realize,
[00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:57.620]   is extremely difficult to put into words, because all along one sounds as if one is
[00:16:57.620 --> 00:17:03.620]   advocating a wildness. But I'm not. All I'm saying is that these people fall into error
[00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:10.620]   because in their pride in themselves, because they're not wild, they're not hot. They're
[00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:16.620]   not cold, but they're not hot either. And not to be cold and not to be hot is thoroughly
[00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:23.620]   bad. I'm trying to describe this condition of self-satisfaction and of complacency, which
[00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:29.620]   feels, therefore, that in general it is in this right position. It's orthodox, it's
[00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:36.620]   controlled, it's decent, it's respectable. It has a kind of sentimental feeling, but
[00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:43.620]   there's never any loss of oneself in this grand inertion. No, no, we don't like that
[00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:49.620]   sort of thing. Everything must be done decently and in order. Let me perhaps tell you a story
[00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:53.620]   which will illustrate what I'm saying perfectly. It's the story that you'll find in the
[00:17:53.620 --> 00:18:01.620]   biography of that great missionary, Dr. Jonathan Goforth, who was used of God in revival in
[00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:09.620]   Korea and in Manchuria in the early part of this present century, 1904, 5, and 6. And
[00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:15.620]   he was coming home, going home to Canada unfurloned at a pass through this country. And certain
[00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:21.620]   authorities who hold great meetings every year in this country heard that he was coming
[00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:24.620]   through this country and wondered what they should do with him. They were in trouble for
[00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:29.620]   this reason. They'd read the reports of the revivals in Manchuria and Korea, and they'd
[00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:34.620]   read that sometimes the meetings there would go on all night. Having started in the evening,
[00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:39.620]   they'd go on all night. And that sometimes there was a little display of excess that
[00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:44.620]   people were carried away in the physical frame, seemed almost incapable of receiving this
[00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:50.620]   great benefit from the Spirit. There was sometimes a kind of disorder in the meeting, what someone
[00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:55.620]   once described as an orderly disorderliness, the kind of thing you get in revival. Now
[00:18:55.620 --> 00:19:01.620]   these people were very troubled about this. What could they do? So they decided to ask
[00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:07.620]   this man to speak, but they reminded him that he must remember that he was no longer in
[00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:13.620]   Korea, no longer in Manchuria, that in their meetings, well, they've got a timetable and
[00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:19.620]   a program, and everything was done decently and in order. Now that's the kind of condition
[00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:28.620]   that I'm describing. Not cold, but certainly not hot. Having an abhorrence of true emotion,
[00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:35.620]   even as they have an abhorrence of looseness, laxity in doctrine on the other hand. And
[00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:41.620]   at the same time, of course, they're moral and they're decent. They don't do the things
[00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:47.620]   that other people do. They've got their curve, they've got their set ideas about how to live,
[00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:53.620]   and they never deviate from it at all. Why then? They bring up their family, they teach
[00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:58.620]   them the Bible, take their children to Sunday school. They've done all these things. There's
[00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:02.620]   nothing in a sense that they're not doing. Not only that, they're busy, they're active,
[00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:07.620]   they're workers. They're prepared to do anything they can to help, and they take great interest
[00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:15.620]   in these matters. But there they are. They're self-contained. They're self-satisfied. They
[00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:22.620]   say, "I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing." Now the question we
[00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:28.620]   ask ourselves is this. Are you conscious of any need this morning? Are you conscious of
[00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:34.620]   any dissatisfaction? Or do you really think you're doing remarkably well? Indeed, that
[00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:39.620]   there's nothing more to be desired. What more could one desire? One believes the right things,
[00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:43.620]   one attends a place of worship, one's concerned about speaking to others, everything's going
[00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:50.620]   well, "I have need of nothing." This is the question. These people really believe that
[00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:56.620]   that was true. They were perfectly satisfied, and they said quite honestly, "I really don't
[00:20:56.620 --> 00:21:02.620]   need any more." Now here is the most important question we can ever face. Do we feel like
[00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:11.620]   that? What's your real feeling about yourself as a Christian? Have you got it all? And I'll
[00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:16.620]   give you the future. Do you feel that if you can just go on as you are now, that all will
[00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:24.620]   be well, nothing more is desired? Is that your feeling? If so, you're a lyricist. So
[00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:31.620]   you analyze yourself in terms of your intellect and understanding of truth and in your feeling
[00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:36.620]   and in the realm of your conduct and of your practice. Now, you see, what our Lord says
[00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:43.620]   to such people is this, "If you continue like this, I am about to spew the air out
[00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:50.620]   of my mouth." It's one of the most terrible things he ever said. This, I say, is something
[00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:56.620]   that he reprobates more than anything else. Why? Well, I repeat, it is because it is the
[00:21:56.620 --> 00:22:03.620]   greatest possible insult to God. He says, "I would that you were either cold or hot."
[00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:08.620]   You know, there's more hope for a man who's right outside than for this kind of person.
[00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:13.620]   He makes no pretense. He doesn't claim to have anything, either in belief or conduct
[00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:20.620]   or practice or behavior or anything else. This is worse than to be cold. Indeed, the
[00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:24.620]   history of the Church throughout the centuries, I think, demonstrates this quite clearly.
[00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:30.620]   The people who have generally been the most bitter opponents of Reformation and Revival
[00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:35.620]   have been this kind of Christian believer in the Christian Church. Now, they are Christians,
[00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:40.620]   remember. They are Christians. You can't say they're cold. They do believe. They're
[00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:47.620]   in the Church. But these are the people who have always hindered revival, true reawakening.
[00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:51.620]   Why? Well, because they're so pleased. They say, "What are you talking about revival?"
[00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:54.620]   There are people who are saying this today. They say, "Some of you are always talking
[00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:58.620]   about revival. What are you talking about revival for? Look at the campaigns. Look
[00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:04.620]   at the Bible colleges. All full. What more do you need? Everything seems to be perfect."
[00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:09.620]   And this is true of groups of people. It is true of individual Christian people. They
[00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:13.620]   really can't see that there's anything wrong at the present time. They feel things
[00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:19.620]   are going remarkably well. And they have need of nothing. All we need to do is to keep on,
[00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:28.620]   they say, as we are. Lukewarm. Neither cold nor hot. Very well. What's the cause of this
[00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:34.620]   condition? Our Lord makes it quite clear. It can be put in one word. It is ignorance.
[00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:40.620]   "Because thou sayest, 'I am rich and increased with goods and of need of nothing,' and knowest
[00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:51.620]   not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked." Now, my dear friends,
[00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:57.620]   I do hope we've got this picture clearly in our mind. He doesn't say that this church
[00:23:57.620 --> 00:24:02.620]   was guilty of wrong belief. He doesn't say that this church was guilty of immorality.
[00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:09.620]   Other churches were, and he's had to deal with it. He doesn't say that. Look that you
[00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:14.620]   see superficially and externally, there's no criticism of this church. What was really
[00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:20.620]   wrong with this church was its whole spirit, its whole attitude towards the Lord and towards
[00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:27.620]   itself. This is the appalling and the terrible thing. You see, when people are respectable,
[00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:31.620]   you can't criticize them for being guilty of particular sins because they're not guilty
[00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:38.620]   of them. The trouble with them is it's the sheer smallness of the thing. The sheer lifelessness.
[00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:46.620]   This absence of heat. This is the terrifying thing about this. So we've got to analyze
[00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:51.620]   it and see what he means. "You don't know," he says, "you're ignorant. You're ignorant."
[00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:57.620]   And this, I maintain, is always the trouble with people who are in this condition. What
[00:24:57.620 --> 00:25:03.620]   were these Laodiceans ignorant of? Well, he tells them quite plainly, they're ignorant
[00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:13.620]   of themselves and of their own state. Congratulating themselves, saying, "I am full, I am rich,
[00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:19.620]   increased with goods, have need of nothing." How could she possibly have said that about
[00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:25.620]   herself? Well, the answer is, you see, that she'd not been examining herself. That's
[00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:31.620]   why he exhorts this church and these people to be zealous, therefore, and repent. The
[00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:35.620]   difficulty with these people was that they didn't stop to think and they didn't stop
[00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:42.620]   to examine themselves. They assumed that everything was all right. It's what we're often told
[00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:47.620]   about the children of Israel under the Old Testament. There's a terrifying word with
[00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:52.620]   respect to them in the book of the prophet Hosea, "Israel has gray hairs upon him and
[00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:59.620]   he knoweth it not." That's the terrible danger. It's so simple, you can understand
[00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:03.620]   this, can't you? Now, this was a Christian church. This consisted of people who were
[00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:07.620]   Christian. They believed the truth. They'd accepted the message. They had joined the
[00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:11.620]   church. They had left the world. They were no longer guilty of certain things. And here
[00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:17.620]   they are in this fellowship. But now, they've so arranged it that it's entirely in their
[00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:23.620]   control. You don't go too far one way or the other. You just keep it as you want it.
[00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:28.620]   It's very nice. Well, when you think of death, you say, "Oh, yes, I'm a Christian.
[00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:32.620]   The blood of Christ has covered my sins." Any question that arises, you've always got
[00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:37.620]   the appropriate answer. And you say, "Well, of course, at a time like this, the fact that
[00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:41.620]   I'm a Christian at all is a very wonderful thing." So many are not. So you spend a lot
[00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:45.620]   of your time in looking at those who are cold, those who are right outside, and you always
[00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:51.620]   say, "Well, I'm not cold." But then you don't go much further. You tend to stop at that.
[00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:54.620]   You see certain people who seem to have lost their heads. You say, "Well, thank God I'm
[00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:58.620]   not like that." And here you are. You see, whichever way you look, you're all right.
[00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:03.620]   That's because you are never looking very deeply. You've just examined the position
[00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:09.620]   on the surface and contrast yourselves with others who are obviously wrong in some shape
[00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:15.620]   or form. Indeed, you see, the picture here is the picture that our Lord gives at the
[00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:21.620]   end of the Sermon on the Mount. Again, one of these terrifying things, ought to be terrifying
[00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:27.620]   to every preacher and to everybody else. "Not everyone that saith unto me, 'Lord, Lord,'
[00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:31.620]   shall enter into the kingdom of heaven, but he that doeth the will of my Father which
[00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:36.620]   is in heaven. Many will say to me in that day, 'Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in
[00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:41.620]   thy name, and in thy name have cast out devils, and in thy name done many wonderful works?'"
[00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:46.620]   It's all true. They were quite genuine. They were perfectly sincere. There's no lie there.
[00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:54.620]   "But he, then will I profess unto them, 'I never knew you. Depart from me, ye that work
[00:27:54.620 --> 00:28:02.620]   iniquity.'" You see, this terrible possibility of self-deception. You get into a certain
[00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:06.620]   mold, you get into a certain groove, if you like, and you feel, "Well, we've arrived,
[00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:12.620]   this is it. What more can there be necessary?" As I say, we're not in the world, we've left
[00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:16.620]   all that, we're not guilty of these terrible things that are happening in the world round
[00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:21.620]   and about us, these horrifying things that we read of in the press and we read of and
[00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:26.620]   see and hear on the television and the radio. We are all right, we are free from all these
[00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:31.620]   things. We are respectable, we are decent, we are good, we are moral, we believe. What
[00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:39.620]   more? Now then, I say the trouble with these people was due to ignorance, and the ignorance
[00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:45.620]   arises from the fact that they haven't examined themselves as they should have done. There
[00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:50.620]   is a kind of examination, but as it's always negative and always contrasting themselves
[00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:54.620]   with extremes, they've never really faced themselves. So I put it like this. What are
[00:28:54.620 --> 00:29:00.620]   they ignorant of? Well, they're ignorant of their own condition because, ultimately, they
[00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:10.620]   are ignorant of the riches and the possibilities of grace. Now here is the whole trouble. You
[00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:16.620]   see, it's possible for us to be orthodox, possible for us to be very moral and decent
[00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:23.620]   and ethical, possible for us to be very busy in the work of the church, organizing, singing,
[00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:27.620]   going to conference after conference, and it seems marvelous, isn't it? Wonderful, they
[00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:33.620]   say. Look at the crowds, everything, it's perfection. What's the matter with these people?
[00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:38.620]   Well, what's really the matter with them is that they're ignorant of the riches and the
[00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:45.620]   possibilities of the grace of God. What does that mean? Well, it means in the first place
[00:29:45.620 --> 00:29:52.620]   that they've never seen it in the New Testament itself. You see, it is possible to read the
[00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:58.620]   scriptures and yet not consider them. It is possible for us all to be reading these great
[00:29:58.620 --> 00:30:03.620]   descriptions of the Christian and of the Christian church as you have them in the New Testament
[00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:10.620]   and never really to face it. Take the things that we are told here about the church, what
[00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:15.620]   the church really is, what the church should be. Look at the descriptions of the early
[00:30:15.620 --> 00:30:20.620]   church as you have it in the New Testament. I've called your attention a great deal to
[00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:25.620]   these things during the last year or so. You remember that lyrical description at the end
[00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:31.620]   of Acts 2. Here it is, "And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple and breaking
[00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:36.620]   bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart, praising
[00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:41.620]   God and having favor with all the people." We've already been told of them that they
[00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:45.620]   continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship and breaking of bread and in
[00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:53.620]   prayers. But it is a lyrical picture. The church was thrilled with joy. There was this
[00:30:53.620 --> 00:31:00.620]   vitality, this life, this abandon. You read of them later with the whole place being shaken,
[00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:05.620]   the very room in which they met. And here you get these marvelous descriptions. Then
[00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:09.620]   you get these analyses of the state and the condition of the church as she should be in
[00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:15.620]   the various epistles. And all these great promises of God, the church as the bride of
[00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:21.620]   Christ, the church as the household of God, the church as a great state, a great kingdom
[00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:27.620]   in which he reigns, and all these thrilling things which exhaust the very superlatives
[00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:35.620]   of the great apostles, all this is here before us. But somehow or another, we just glide
[00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:39.620]   over these statements as if to say, "Well, yes, that's all right, that's very beautiful,
[00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:44.620]   that's very wonderful," as if they've got nothing to say to us. We don't stop and say,
[00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:49.620]   "But am I like that? Is the church like that now? Is this a true description of the church
[00:31:49.620 --> 00:31:54.620]   as I know her at the present time? Is this a description of me as a Christian at this
[00:31:54.620 --> 00:31:59.620]   present time?" There is this teaching. Not only that, we get the experiences of different
[00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:04.620]   persons described to us in this New Testament. Take the things that the apostle Paul says
[00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:10.620]   about himself so often. Take what John says. He writes these things to us, that our joy
[00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:15.620]   might be full, that we may have fellowship with them, and that our joy might be full,
[00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:21.620]   that we might be rejoicing with great assurance, and knowing these things, having lost the
[00:32:21.620 --> 00:32:26.620]   fear of death and the grave, seeing beyond it all. That's the picture. Now, we've got
[00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:31.620]   this in the language we can understand. And we're all, of course, we read our daily portion,
[00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:35.620]   don't we? We're following the scheme and we read the notes. We've got it all. I've
[00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:39.620]   done my portion. I've got it. I understand. I can answer questions. My dear friend, what
[00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:45.620]   I'm asking is this. Have you ever examined yourself in the light of these descriptions?
[00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:52.620]   Here's the question. The great danger is to be content with a kind of head knowledge.
[00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:59.620]   We may have passed examinations on our scriptural knowledge and be dead and lifeless, know nothing
[00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:04.620]   about this very thing about which we can answer questions so correctly. We never stop to say,
[00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:10.620]   "Now, is this true of me? Is this true of the Christian church as I know her?" That
[00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:14.620]   was the cause of the failure of these people. It wasn't that they hadn't heard, they'd
[00:33:14.620 --> 00:33:18.620]   got the message, and they'd believed it, and they'd accepted it, but they'd never applied
[00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:23.620]   it, they'd never tested themselves by it, they'd never looked at themselves in the light
[00:33:23.620 --> 00:33:29.620]   of its teaching. Thou knowest not. And there's only one way whereby we can know, and that
[00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:34.620]   is to take the truth as it is given us. But then, fortunately, we can even add to that.
[00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:42.620]   But it makes our failure still more glaring. It makes our ignorance still more inexcusable.
[00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:49.620]   Not only do we fail to learn from the scriptures, we have also failed to learn from the history
[00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:56.620]   of the church, because we've got it. And as I never tire of saying, next to the scriptures
[00:33:56.620 --> 00:34:01.620]   there is nothing more profitable than to be reading the history of the Christian church.
[00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:07.620]   But you see, the modern man doesn't like doing that. He hasn't got time to read, he tells
[00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:11.620]   me. Our forefathers had time to read, and to read big books. We can't. We say, "We
[00:34:11.620 --> 00:34:17.620]   haven't got the time. We want everything in snippets. We want a little tabloid report,
[00:34:17.620 --> 00:34:20.620]   we're interested in reports, and we're interested in experiences, something that
[00:34:20.620 --> 00:34:25.620]   interests and excites us." But my dear friend, go back and look at the great history of the
[00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:30.620]   church. Now look at it, as I say, in general. I've mentioned the question of revivals.
[00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:36.620]   I mentioned this question once more. Read the accounts of the church with the Spirit
[00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:43.620]   of God coming down upon it, and the church being lifted up and transformed and transfigured,
[00:34:43.620 --> 00:34:50.620]   filled with power and with glory, filled with singing and rejoicing and a great abandon.
[00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:57.620]   None of your polite, respectable, controlled, organized meetings, but everything bursting
[00:34:57.620 --> 00:35:04.620]   over the very edges, as it were, bursting the banks, and the whole countryside being
[00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:09.620]   flooded, and mighty things happening under the power of the Spirit of God. Do we know
[00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:16.620]   about things like this? Have we taken the trouble to examine the history of the church?
[00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:20.620]   Not only what we have in the Bible, but what has happened since. You see, the danger is
[00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:24.620]   always to sort of idealize the New Testament and say, "That was all right then, but of
[00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:28.620]   course the apostles were alive then, and ever since the time of the apostles have gone,
[00:35:28.620 --> 00:35:32.620]   everything has changed." As if we are to live on a lower level. It's an absolute
[00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:37.620]   lie. There is no word to that effect in the whole of the New Testament. What we read here
[00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:42.620]   is applicable to all of us now. It's meant to be true at all times. These letters are
[00:35:42.620 --> 00:35:48.620]   contemporary letters. What our Lord said to the church of the Laodiceans in the first
[00:35:48.620 --> 00:35:55.620]   century is saying to the church today. And what proves that is, these great upheavals,
[00:35:55.620 --> 00:36:00.620]   as it were, these great movements, tides of the Spirit, which you can read of in the long
[00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:08.620]   story of the Christian church. But we seem to be ignorant of all that, as if evangelicalism
[00:36:08.620 --> 00:36:13.620]   had only started with Phineas and Moody, or somebody still more recent perhaps. My dear
[00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:18.620]   friends, it is our ignorance that accounts for our state and condition. Is the Christian
[00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:23.620]   church today as you find the church described in the New Testament? Is she as she has been
[00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:29.620]   in periods of revival? That's the question. And what about us as individuals? Or take
[00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:38.620]   it again, in the history of individuals. I commend to you once more the reading of biographies
[00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:47.620]   and of autobiographies. Have you ever done that? And what have you done when you've
[00:36:47.620 --> 00:36:53.620]   finished? When you've read the journals of Whitefield or Wesley or somebody like that,
[00:36:53.620 --> 00:36:57.620]   what have you done as you've read it? Have you just said, "This is marvellous, this
[00:36:57.620 --> 00:37:01.620]   is wonderful," as if you were reading a fairy tale and you put down the book? Or have
[00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:09.620]   you said to yourself, "Well, am I like this? And if I'm not, why am I not like this?
[00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:15.620]   This is meant to be true of me. These were men of like passions with myself. They were
[00:37:15.620 --> 00:37:20.620]   exceptional in certain respects, so am I. But am I like this?" Now, it is the failure
[00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:27.620]   to do that that accounts for this Laodicean condition. This is the question I'm asking.
[00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:32.620]   As you've read of such men, have you felt at times that perhaps you're not even a Christian
[00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:39.620]   at all? If it doesn't have that effect upon you, you haven't read it truly. Can you read
[00:37:39.620 --> 00:37:44.620]   the New Testament without being disturbed? If you can, there's something seriously wrong
[00:37:44.620 --> 00:37:49.620]   with you. If the New Testament doesn't condemn you every time you read it and make you feel,
[00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:54.620]   "Well, why am I not like this?" Well, then there's something wrong with your reading.
[00:37:54.620 --> 00:37:58.620]   It's not examining you, it's not searching you. You haven't got ears to hear. "He that
[00:37:58.620 --> 00:38:02.620]   hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches." The Spirit is speaking,
[00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:07.620]   the Word is speaking, but we don't seem to hear. Now, that's the whole essence of the
[00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:14.620]   trouble. Because, you see, what you find here and what you find exemplified so constantly
[00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:20.620]   in the long history of the Church is something like this. What are we meant to enjoy? Well,
[00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:28.620]   we are meant to enjoy the unsearchable riches of Christ. That's what we're meant to enjoy.
[00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:38.620]   The unsearchable riches of Christ. Are you enjoying them? That's what you have as a
[00:38:38.620 --> 00:38:43.620]   believer. You've entered into this, and there they are for you, the exceeding riches of
[00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:51.620]   His grace. The love of Christ which passeth knowledge, breadth, length, depth, height,
[00:38:51.620 --> 00:38:59.620]   there it is in all its eternity of wonder. Are you enjoying this? Have you entered into
[00:38:59.620 --> 00:39:04.620]   the possession of this? This is what we are offered in the New Testament. Come, let me
[00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:13.620]   be more particular. The Christian is a man who is meant to know the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:20.620]   That I might know Him. These things I write unto you, says John in the first epistle,
[00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:25.620]   he's writing to those who already believe. As I've reminded you, he writes that their
[00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:33.620]   joy might be full. This, then, is the message that we have heard of him, and so on. These
[00:39:33.620 --> 00:39:39.620]   things write we unto you, that your joy may be full. He says, that which we have seen
[00:39:39.620 --> 00:39:44.620]   and heard declare we unto you, that you also may have fellowship with us. And truly, our
[00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:51.620]   fellowship is with the Father, and with His Son, Jesus Christ. Now we are meant to enter
[00:39:51.620 --> 00:39:57.620]   into that fellowship, or as our Lord puts it here, here it is. Behold, I stand at the
[00:39:57.620 --> 00:40:03.620]   door and knock. If any men hear my voice and open the door, I will come in to him, and
[00:40:03.620 --> 00:40:11.620]   will sup with him, and he with me. Now, he means that. That's what we are meant to be
[00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:16.620]   enjoying. What does this mean? Well, this is a term in which he describes the intimacy
[00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:21.620]   of fellowship that should be possible. It isn't merely that we believe the truth about
[00:40:21.620 --> 00:40:27.620]   him. Of course we do. But he offers more. He says, I will come in, and I will sup with
[00:40:27.620 --> 00:40:36.620]   him, and he with me. This is a very wonderful and glorious description of an intimate personal
[00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:42.620]   fellowship. You see, he's saying, you are very busy, you are doing many things, but
[00:40:42.620 --> 00:40:50.620]   what I'm asking you is this, are you enjoying fellowship with me? It's an intimate meeting
[00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:56.620]   together. There's the table, he's one side and you are the other. He wants to talk to
[00:40:56.620 --> 00:41:03.620]   you. He wants to tell you about his love to you. He wants to know if you love him. That's
[00:41:03.620 --> 00:41:09.620]   the picture. A tête-à-tête, you're meeting together in this intimate fellowship, you
[00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:15.620]   and he and he and you. And you're enjoying his fellowship, and you're enjoying him.
[00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:20.620]   Now, you're not merely enjoying things about him. You're not merely when you happen to
[00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:24.620]   think about it, or when you take meal, or are facing death, oh yes, my sins are forgiven.
[00:41:24.620 --> 00:41:29.620]   When you're stopped with your busy round of activities. No, no. This is the biggest thing
[00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:36.620]   in your life. This is the thing that you value and prize above everything else. I am my Lord
[00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:44.620]   and he is mine. I know him whom I have believed. These are the things, my dear friend. Forget
[00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:51.620]   the people who are cold. But these, you see, are the experiences of those who know something
[00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:59.620]   about warmth and about love. You are familiar with these terms as we find them constantly
[00:41:59.620 --> 00:42:05.620]   in the New Testament. He will speak to you. And he will tell you of his love to you. He
[00:42:05.620 --> 00:42:11.620]   will give you intimations of this. I've so often reminded you of these things. I've
[00:42:11.620 --> 00:42:16.620]   given extracts out of people's diaries. How the love of Christ came upon them in wave
[00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:22.620]   after wave so that they could scarcely stand it. Ravishing their hearts. Carrying them
[00:42:22.620 --> 00:42:27.620]   away in transports of delight. Some of them testifying to being almost unconscious for
[00:42:27.620 --> 00:42:31.620]   hours in the enjoyment of this, forgetting the world and everything else. Now, here is
[00:42:31.620 --> 00:42:37.620]   the way to test ourselves. What do we know about that kind of thing? Do we know anything
[00:42:37.620 --> 00:42:47.620]   about his consolation? Are you able to sing the hymns truly and in an experimental manner?
[00:42:47.620 --> 00:42:52.620]   I need thee every hour. Stay thou nearby. Temptations lose their power when thou art
[00:42:52.620 --> 00:42:57.620]   nigh. Is that true? Now these, you see, are the ways in which we should examine ourselves.
[00:42:57.620 --> 00:43:01.620]   The people of Laodicea haven't been doing this. They did it neatly to all was well.
[00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:06.620]   And they don't realize how poor they are. Yes, it's right to be orthodox. It's right
[00:43:06.620 --> 00:43:09.620]   to be moral and decent and better than the people who are in the world. But my dear friend,
[00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:14.620]   that's not the test for us. The test for us is this. These experiences that were given
[00:43:14.620 --> 00:43:19.620]   to these ordinary people in the first century, that have been repeated to the saints throughout
[00:43:19.620 --> 00:43:26.620]   the centuries, what do we know of these? You look at the poor beggar in the street and
[00:43:26.620 --> 00:43:31.620]   you think you're rich. But then you look at a millionaire and you feel you're a pauper.
[00:43:31.620 --> 00:43:40.620]   That's the thing to do. Are you enjoying his peace? He said before he left, "My peace
[00:43:40.620 --> 00:43:47.620]   I give unto you." My peace, peace I give unto you. My peace give I unto you. Not as
[00:43:47.620 --> 00:43:54.620]   the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be
[00:43:54.620 --> 00:44:01.620]   afraid. Are you enjoying that piece of his? That's what you're meant to enjoy. The
[00:44:01.620 --> 00:44:07.620]   peace of God that passeth all understanding. Now, it doesn't matter what your circumstances
[00:44:07.620 --> 00:44:14.620]   are. That's the teaching everywhere. Paul in prison knows the peace of God that passeth
[00:44:14.620 --> 00:44:20.620]   all understanding. All things are going against him all round. Doesn't matter. He's enjoying
[00:44:20.620 --> 00:44:26.620]   a peace that is absolutely perfect. Nothing can shake it, nothing can disturb it, nothing
[00:44:26.620 --> 00:44:33.620]   can make him lose it. Not as the world, but as I give unto you. My dear friend, are you
[00:44:33.620 --> 00:44:39.620]   enjoying the peace of God that passeth all understanding? Whatever may be happening to
[00:44:39.620 --> 00:44:44.620]   you, whatever you may see coming in the future, are you enjoying? You're meant to enjoy it.
[00:44:44.620 --> 00:44:47.620]   You think you're rich, you think you've arrived, you think you've got all things,
[00:44:47.620 --> 00:44:54.620]   but have you got this? People like ourselves have enjoyed this in this world. This is very
[00:44:54.620 --> 00:44:59.620]   practical. This is true to life. This is not some ideal description. This is the very thing
[00:44:59.620 --> 00:45:06.620]   that was literally enjoyed by the early Christians. It has been enjoyed by the most ordinary people
[00:45:06.620 --> 00:45:17.620]   in Christ ever since throughout the running centuries. And then there's joy and rejoicing.
[00:45:17.620 --> 00:45:25.620]   My joy give I unto you. I read the description of the early church in Acts 2. Gladness of
[00:45:25.620 --> 00:45:32.620]   heart, praising God, rejoicing. Is there any praise in your life? How much? When you get
[00:45:32.620 --> 00:45:37.620]   on your knees, how much praise of God is there? Is it only petitions? I know you've got your
[00:45:37.620 --> 00:45:42.620]   prayer list, haven't you? You're praying for certain people, but are you praising him?
[00:45:42.620 --> 00:45:47.620]   Are you expressing your love to him? Is your heart moved? Are you carried away by all this?
[00:45:47.620 --> 00:45:52.620]   This is the test. Isn't it terrible that we can be so mechanical and pride ourselves on
[00:45:52.620 --> 00:45:56.620]   it? I do pray every day. I read a portion of Scripture and I pray. I allocate this time
[00:45:56.620 --> 00:46:00.620]   to it, which is marvelous. And look at the work I'm doing. And you're rich, you need
[00:46:00.620 --> 00:46:05.620]   nothing. But oh, is your heart moved? Is your heart drawn out? Are you carried away by love
[00:46:05.620 --> 00:46:13.620]   to him? Oh, let me give you it in the words of Peter again. This is what Peter says about
[00:46:13.620 --> 00:46:22.620]   ordinary Christians. "Whom having not seen, ye love. In whom though now ye see him not
[00:46:22.620 --> 00:46:34.620]   yet believing, ye rejoice with a joy unspeakable and full of glory." To ordinary Christians.
[00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:39.620]   Do you still feel you're rich? Do you still feel that you need nothing? Do you still feel
[00:46:39.620 --> 00:46:43.620]   that you've got everything? Are you pleased with yourself? Are you proud of yourself?
[00:46:43.620 --> 00:46:49.620]   Oh, if you are, it just means that you're about as ignorant as a Christian can possibly
[00:46:49.620 --> 00:46:55.620]   be. You don't even know how to read your Scriptures. You know, we're not called just
[00:46:55.620 --> 00:47:00.620]   to read a certain number of verses every day. We are called upon to understand what we read
[00:47:00.620 --> 00:47:05.620]   and appropriate it and allow it to search us and examine us and then give us of the
[00:47:05.620 --> 00:47:12.620]   riches, the unsearchable riches of Christ. That's the object of it all. And this is
[00:47:12.620 --> 00:47:18.620]   what is possible to us. And then he offers us power, he offers us ability, he offers
[00:47:18.620 --> 00:47:23.620]   us something of his own zeal and of his own power. Let me sum it up by putting it like
[00:47:23.620 --> 00:47:30.620]   this. Can we honestly say with Charles Wesley at this moment, and is this your experience?
[00:47:30.620 --> 00:47:41.620]   "Thou, O Christ, art all I want, more than all in thee I find." Is that true? Or as
[00:47:41.620 --> 00:47:48.620]   another put it, "Sight, healing, riches of the mind, yea, all I need in thee to find.
[00:47:48.620 --> 00:47:56.620]   All am of God I come." Or can you say with another, "Object of my first desire, Jesus,
[00:47:56.620 --> 00:48:03.620]   crucified for me." Test yourself in the light of it. "All to happiness aspire, only to
[00:48:03.620 --> 00:48:09.620]   be found in thee. Thee to please and thee to know. Constitute my bliss below. Thee to
[00:48:09.620 --> 00:48:16.620]   see and thee to love. Constitute my life above, my bliss above." Then he goes on, "Lord,
[00:48:16.620 --> 00:48:22.620]   it is not life to live. If thy presence thou deny. Lord, if thou thy presence give, 'tis
[00:48:22.620 --> 00:48:29.620]   no longer death to die. Source and giver of repose, only from thy smile it flows. Peace
[00:48:29.620 --> 00:48:35.620]   and happiness are thine, mine they are if thou art mine. Whilst I feel thy love to me,
[00:48:35.620 --> 00:48:42.620]   every object teems with joy." Have you ever felt his love to you? That's the question.
[00:48:42.620 --> 00:48:48.620]   Love is to be felt. Love's not something abstract. Love's not something theoretical. Love is
[00:48:48.620 --> 00:48:55.620]   between persons. "Whilst I feel thy love to me, every object teems with joy. May I ever
[00:48:55.620 --> 00:49:02.620]   walk with thee, for 'tis bliss without a lie. Let me but thy self possess, total son of
[00:49:02.620 --> 00:49:08.620]   happiness. Real bliss I then shall prove. Heaven below and heaven above." My friend,
[00:49:08.620 --> 00:49:14.620]   is that true of you? That's the question. Forget everything else and just examine yourself
[00:49:14.620 --> 00:49:19.620]   in the light of that possibility. That's what you're meant to have and to enjoy as a Christian.
[00:49:19.620 --> 00:49:25.620]   Have you got it? Are you rich or are you miserable and poor and blind and naked? Is there any
[00:49:25.620 --> 00:49:31.620]   cure for us if we are like the Laodiceans? Well, it's all here. I needn't stay with us.
[00:49:31.620 --> 00:49:38.620]   It's so plain, it's simple, it's explicit. Do you know there's only one hope for us?
[00:49:38.620 --> 00:49:46.620]   And that is his concern for us. If you're in this Laodicean condition, don't try to
[00:49:46.620 --> 00:49:51.620]   work up a feeling. Many are trying to do that. They'll work it up with music, they'll even
[00:49:51.620 --> 00:49:58.620]   jazz the music to do it. They'll clap their hands, they'll introduce false fire. Tragic.
[00:49:58.620 --> 00:50:05.620]   That's not it. We can't do it. It is he alone who can do it. And he's ready to do it. He
[00:50:05.620 --> 00:50:11.620]   says so. Even to these Laodiceans, he shows his concern for us. This is what he says,
[00:50:11.620 --> 00:50:16.620]   "As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten." Have you been rebuked this morning? If you
[00:50:16.620 --> 00:50:23.620]   have, thank God. It means you're a Christian. Have you felt chastened? Have you felt humbled
[00:50:23.620 --> 00:50:29.620]   in this service? If you have, I tell you, you're a Christian. But if you've felt nothing,
[00:50:29.620 --> 00:50:35.620]   you're not. If you're annoyed, you're not. This is the whole question. "As many as I
[00:50:35.620 --> 00:50:44.620]   love, I rebuke and chasten." He does it for our good. And he does it in many ways. I had
[00:50:44.620 --> 00:50:48.620]   a letter last week from a man in a given part of this country, wanting my advice and wanting
[00:50:48.620 --> 00:50:53.620]   to come to see me. And this is what the poor man said. I understand it so well. He says,
[00:50:53.620 --> 00:50:58.620]   "I've been most active and busy in Christian work for twenty years. He now has to have
[00:50:58.620 --> 00:51:04.620]   an operation, and he suddenly finds he can't pray as he'd like to. After twenty years of
[00:51:04.620 --> 00:51:10.620]   exceptionally busy Christian work, he finds it rather difficult to pray." What I said
[00:51:10.620 --> 00:51:16.620]   to that man was that it is his loving Lord who'd sent him this illness, calling for an
[00:51:16.620 --> 00:51:22.620]   operation to save him from something worse, to make him see that in all his busyness and
[00:51:22.620 --> 00:51:28.620]   activity, he'd forgotten the most important and vital thing of all, his relationship to
[00:51:28.620 --> 00:51:37.620]   his blessed Lord. He chastises because he loves and he rebukes and chastens. Not only
[00:51:37.620 --> 00:51:44.620]   that, "Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If any man hear my voice and open the door,
[00:51:44.620 --> 00:51:50.620]   I will come in to him and will sup with him and he with me." I wonder whether he's been
[00:51:50.620 --> 00:51:54.620]   knocking at the door of your life this morning, even as I've been speaking feebly. He uses
[00:51:54.620 --> 00:51:59.620]   even this kind of thing. He's got other ways of doing it. He stands at the door, he knocks,
[00:51:59.620 --> 00:52:06.620]   he even whispers, he speaks. Do you hear his voice? What a wonderful thing that he should
[00:52:06.620 --> 00:52:13.620]   do that for us. We've been so self-satisfied and pleased that we've even forgotten him.
[00:52:13.620 --> 00:52:18.620]   And not only does he stand at the door and knock, he's got everything we need. He's got
[00:52:18.620 --> 00:52:24.620]   this gold tied in the fire, he's got the perfect clothing, he's got the eye salve. What's the
[00:52:24.620 --> 00:52:30.620]   gold? I believe it's faith that opens to us the riches of his grace, the clothing, the
[00:52:30.620 --> 00:52:36.620]   garment of praise, the eye salve. Oh, it's spiritual understanding. And that's the thing
[00:52:36.620 --> 00:52:42.620]   that's so lacking today, spiritual understanding. People are so pleased with activities that
[00:52:42.620 --> 00:52:47.620]   they come to spiritual understanding to see their poverty or even to grasp the riches
[00:52:47.620 --> 00:52:52.620]   of his grace. Eye salve. Never have we needed it more than at this present time that our
[00:52:52.620 --> 00:52:58.620]   eyes may see the possibilities of the grace of God, all that is treasured to us in the
[00:52:58.620 --> 00:53:07.620]   Son of his love. And all you and I need to do is to listen to him. Give yourself a chance
[00:53:07.620 --> 00:53:15.620]   to hear him. Silence the raucous voices of the world for a while and even the shouting
[00:53:15.620 --> 00:53:24.620]   in the church. Be still. Listen. Listen to him in the silences. Be still and know that
[00:53:24.620 --> 00:53:31.620]   I am God. And you'll hear the knock, you'll hear the whisper of his voice. And all you've
[00:53:31.620 --> 00:53:38.620]   got to do is to open the door. See, this is a text for Christians. It should never be
[00:53:38.620 --> 00:53:43.620]   used evangelistically. This is a text for Christians only. We've got the power to open
[00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:52.620]   the door. And we have got to open the door. And he will come in. Have you felt chastised
[00:53:52.620 --> 00:54:03.620]   and rebuked? Have you repented of your foolish pride, your foolish self-satisfaction? Have
[00:54:03.620 --> 00:54:14.620]   you seen your nakedness, your emptiness, your utter poverty? Open the door. And he'll come
[00:54:14.620 --> 00:54:20.620]   in. And in a moment he'll give you to feel something that you've never felt in the whole
[00:54:20.620 --> 00:54:27.620]   of your life. Your heart will be warm. It will begin to burn. And you'll go on your
[00:54:27.620 --> 00:54:35.620]   way rejoicing and will be a blessing to others in a way that you can scarcely imagine. God
[00:54:35.620 --> 00:54:44.620]   have mercy upon us. Oh, that we may give him time that we may silence everything and listen
[00:54:44.620 --> 00:54:54.620]   to the voice divine, though in rebuke it is full of love. And he has to give us all the
[00:54:54.620 --> 00:55:01.620]   unsearchable riches of the grace of God. Amen.
