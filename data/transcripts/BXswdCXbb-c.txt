[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.120]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:21.680]   Paul's epistle to the Ephesians, in the fourth chapter, verses 15 and 16.
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:29.960]   But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things which is the head,
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:39.600]   even Christ, from whom the whole body, fitly joined together and compacted by that which
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:47.600]   every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.640]   increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love.
[00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:01.000]   We resume these studies in the epistle to the Ephesians, which we have interrupted for
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.960]   the last three Sunday mornings.
[00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:13.080]   And here, in these two verses, we come to the winding up of this great section, which
[00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.520]   really began at the first verse of the chapter.
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.640]   And therefore, as we come to look at these two verses, which sound at first very complicated
[00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:32.160]   and very difficult, it is important that we should bear in mind the context and the background.
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.480]   The basic theme is the theme of unity in the Church.
[00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:42.960]   It is that which he puts explicitly in the third verse, endeavouring to keep the unity
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.160]   of the Spirit in the bond of peace.
[00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:52.440]   That is the first great deduction which he draws from the mighty doctrine that he has
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.280]   been laying down in the first three chapters.
[00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.280]   Therefore, he says, I, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that ye walk worthy of the
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.440]   vocation wherewith ye are called.
[00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:09.000]   And that is the first respect in which we are to do so, to preserve and guard and protect
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.760]   the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.920]   And he has been giving us reasons for that, you remember, especially in verses 4, 5, and
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:20.920]   6.
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:28.240]   Well, then in verse 7, he takes up this same subject of the unity of the Church in terms
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:34.480]   of the very nature and constitution of the Church herself.
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.160]   That is the theme, I say, that begins at verse 7.
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.240]   And what he is really doing in these two verses we are looking at this morning is to wind
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:49.760]   up that particular consideration of the nature of the Christian Church.
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:55.840]   His object being, let us not forget, not simply to give us an account of the doctrine of the
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:04.640]   Church, but to show us how inevitable this question of unity is if we really do understand,
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:10.520]   as we ought, this nature and being of the Christian Church.
[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:15.720]   Well, now, we remember that he has been doing this all along.
[00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.320]   He says, "Unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ."
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:26.840]   Then he says, "This gift of Christ is not merely something that we receive individually,
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.200]   but he has given certain gifts to the Church.
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.760]   And these gifts are some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:36.760]   and teachers."
[00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:44.680]   Why has he given these offices and persons to fulfill the offices to the Church?
[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:51.120]   Well, he says, "The answer is for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry,
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:57.200]   for the building up of the body of Christ, until we all come in the unity of the faith
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:04.920]   and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature
[00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.320]   of the fullness of Christ."
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:10.240]   There it is, and we have been looking at it.
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:16.320]   But then, having said it all, and he really has said it all there, he cannot leave it
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.400]   because he is so concerned about it.
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.680]   So he comes back to drive it home in a last word.
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.560]   And this last word is a negative and a positive.
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:34.840]   He drives it home negatively by saying that we henceforth from now on be no more children,
[00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:40.120]   tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the slight of men and
[00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.560]   cunning craftiness wherein they lie in wait to deceive.
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:44.560]   Not that.
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.240]   Well, what then?
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:53.640]   Well, speaking the truth in love, that we may grow up into him in all things, which
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.400]   is the head-even Christ.
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:04.240]   And then follows verse 16 with a final picture of the Church as the body of Christ.
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:09.800]   Very well, now then, there is the background, and we must, as I say, bear it in mind because
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:15.040]   this is really a kind of summing up, stating it all again.
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:20.080]   Nothing new in a sense in what we are going to look at this morning, but he reinforces
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:25.560]   what he has been saying, brings it to a climax and a conclusion, underlines it, emphasizes
[00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:30.440]   it, and that is what we must also try to do.
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:37.600]   Now we have already considered the first statement, namely, speaking the truth in love.
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:43.560]   He says, "These false teachers who mislead and who lie in wait to deceive, there is no
[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.960]   love about them.
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.320]   They have got their own end and object in view only.
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.680]   They are not concerned about you, they are concerned about themselves."
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.440]   That is what the Scripture always says about false teachers.
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:04.160]   They are wolves amongst the sheep, predatory, concerned about themselves only.
[00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.560]   And it has never been the characteristic of false teachers that, "Well, they are
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.520]   false," says the apostle, "you must not be like that.
[00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:17.760]   And what they preach is a lie, it is error, it is false, it is deceit.
[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:20.640]   You," he says, "are to be the exact opposite.
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:25.680]   You are to speak the truth, and you are to speak the truth in love."
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:30.080]   Being concerned about one another, anxious to help one another, in order that you may
[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.080]   build up one another.
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:36.200]   Very well, having put it like that, he says, "You speak the truth in love, why?
[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:47.200]   In order that you may grow up into him in all things which is the head, even Christ."
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:53.440]   Now he, you see, has already said, "even that," where we had it like this, "till
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:58.360]   we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, and to
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:02.680]   a perfect man, and to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ."
[00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:03.680]   That's it.
[00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:07.160]   He's simply saying that again in different words.
[00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:11.200]   We grow up into him in all things which is the head, even Christ.
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.560]   We needn't stay with this, therefore.
[00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:17.360]   But let me just underline what he does say.
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:20.040]   Notice his negative again.
[00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:22.040]   We are not to be children.
[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:24.360]   Well, what's the opposite of being children?
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:26.880]   Well, it's to grow up.
[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:32.960]   To grow up and to advance, and to develop and to go on.
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:37.840]   Well, those of us who were here last Sunday morning were considering that in terms of
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:41.960]   a word out of the epistle to the Hebrews.
[00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:48.320]   It's something that is emphasized everywhere in the scriptures.
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:51.760]   As Christians we are meant to grow, and to grow up.
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:58.000]   There's nothing more tragic than to see somebody remaining in a childish condition, being infantile,
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.960]   though the years are passing.
[00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:02.520]   Is there anything more tragic than that?
[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:07.360]   To see a person who may be in the thirties or the forties with the mentality of a child.
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:13.320]   Well, now that's the sort of thing that can happen to us if we're not careful in the spiritual
[00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:14.320]   life.
[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:19.960]   There are some Christians who never seem to grow up.
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:23.520]   You knew them twenty years ago, and you know them now, and you really can't see anything
[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:25.640]   different in them.
[00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:27.520]   They're still perpetuating the old methods.
[00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:29.400]   They've got the same mannerisms.
[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:32.800]   There's no evidence of development and of growth.
[00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:35.960]   They've got a false view of Christianity.
[00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:36.960]   We are to be no more children.
[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:45.240]   He says, we are to grow up, so that as year passes year, there should be evidence of maturity
[00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:50.400]   and development and growth in us, and those who know us can see it.
[00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:56.160]   And they say, my word, that man is maturing, he's developing.
[00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:00.320]   He was a Christian before, yes, but there's something additional now in everything he
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:02.720]   says and in all he does.
[00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:07.280]   Oh, it's a very sad thing when Christian people don't grow.
[00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:09.640]   Grow up, says Paul.
[00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:10.640]   Develop.
[00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:11.640]   Examine yourselves.
[00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:15.160]   We've been trying to do so the last two Sunday mornings.
[00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:18.480]   That's why these last two Sunday mornings were so important.
[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:22.640]   The last Sunday of the old year, the first Sunday of the new.
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:23.640]   Self-examination.
[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:28.520]   I'm almost tempted to repeat a good deal of it because so many of you were not here
[00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:31.600]   last Sunday morning because of the rain, I imagine.
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:34.160]   But I don't want you to escape that.
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:37.120]   Examine yourselves.
[00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:42.560]   You mustn't evade this, and I mustn't allow you to do so.
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:48.400]   Self-examination is essential, otherwise you'll remain children.
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:50.400]   But we mustn't remain children, says Paul.
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:52.600]   We must grow up.
[00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:55.240]   We must become men.
[00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:57.840]   We mustn't remain as children in any sense.
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:58.840]   Well there it is.
[00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:01.040]   Work it out for yourselves.
[00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:13.440]   Well then he comes to his positive, and he says that we are to grow up in all things.
[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:15.600]   It's the apostle who says that.
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:20.880]   Grow up, went to him, in all things.
[00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:25.320]   There again, last Sunday morning, I was dealing with the importance of balance in the Christian
[00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:26.320]   life.
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:30.600]   It's no use growing in some respects and not in others.
[00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:33.760]   That leads to a monstrosity.
[00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:37.560]   If some parts are overdeveloped and others underdeveloped, that's not beautiful.
[00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:41.240]   That's lacking in symmetry and in form.
[00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:42.240]   That's ugly.
[00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:46.160]   No, no, the growth of the Christian is to be symmetrical.
[00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:50.200]   It's to be in all things and in every respect.
[00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:55.000]   Not only must you develop in your mind and understanding, but your heart and your feeling
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.440]   and your sensibility.
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:02.040]   Let's test ourselves then, I say.
[00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:09.120]   Along those lines and in our conduct and in our behavior, are we growing intellectually?
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:14.800]   Have we got more knowledge of the truth than we had a year ago?
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:18.560]   Do we understand the scriptures better?
[00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:23.880]   Are we less frequently in trouble and in perplexity about these matters?
[00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:28.880]   Do we feel that somehow or another it's all becoming plain to us?
[00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:30.960]   Let's take the obvious illustration.
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:31.960]   Take the student.
[00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:32.960]   He takes up a subject.
[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:34.800]   He's plunged into the midst of lectures.
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.560]   He understands practically nothing at all.
[00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:38.560]   He says, "What is all this about?"
[00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:41.800]   And he feels like giving up, but he's advised to go on.
[00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:46.320]   And he just does go on, and he sits and listens, and he doesn't apprehend very much of it.
[00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:50.320]   But suddenly after a few months, he begins to say to himself, "I'm beginning to get
[00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:51.960]   the hold of this.
[00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:53.520]   I'm beginning to understand it.
[00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:55.840]   It's beginning to make sense to me."
[00:11:55.840 --> 00:12:00.840]   And from there on, the thing becomes clearer and clearer to him, and he's a master of his
[00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:01.840]   subject.
[00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:04.040]   Now, it's exactly like that in the Christian life.
[00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:05.200]   People have often said that to me.
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:09.640]   They said, "You know, when I first began to attend this chapel, I really didn't know
[00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:11.160]   exactly what you were talking about.
[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:15.000]   I felt some general spirit, something laid hold upon me.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.200]   But I didn't know what you were talking about.
[00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:18.200]   I couldn't follow.
[00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:19.200]   I couldn't understand.
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:20.480]   I just came on coming."
[00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:24.400]   And then I gradually began to feel that I was understanding it.
[00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:25.920]   It began to open to me.
[00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:29.180]   Now, that's a sign of growth and of development.
[00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:31.120]   And we should go on like that progressively.
[00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:34.200]   It doesn't matter how much you knew a year ago.
[00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:35.840]   You should know more this morning.
[00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:44.800]   Or test it along the other effective side, the side of the feeling and the emotion.
[00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:49.880]   Does this wondrous truth of the gospel grip us more than ever?
[00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:51.400]   Does it move us more than ever?
[00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:53.600]   Or do we say, "Oh, of course, I'm familiar with that.
[00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:55.360]   I've heard all that before.
[00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:57.560]   I've read my scriptures so often."
[00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:04.080]   Ah, it's a terrible thing when the gospel doesn't move us more and more and fill us
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:09.400]   with an increasing sense of wonder and of amazement and of astonishment.
[00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:15.840]   There are far too many Christians, it seems to me, who have done all the feeling in their
[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:19.480]   Christian life when they were first converted.
[00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:22.560]   And they look back to that and, "It wasn't that wonderful," they say.
[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:25.600]   That's very wrong.
[00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:29.760]   We should feel more and more as we go on.
[00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:34.760]   And if your emotions are not disturbed more and more, what it really means is that your
[00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:37.000]   understanding isn't growing.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.160]   Because to understand this is of necessity to be moved by it.
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:43.520]   You can't help it.
[00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:46.300]   The one follows as the night, the day.
[00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:49.360]   The more we know Christ, the more we must love him.
[00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:54.760]   The more we know any truth about him, the more it must move us in a very deep and vital
[00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:55.760]   sense.
[00:13:55.760 --> 00:14:00.840]   And in the same way, we must grow in the matter of our conduct and of our behavior.
[00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:03.640]   Grow up into him in all things.
[00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:08.760]   Or let me expound what I'm trying to say by quoting the apostle elsewhere.
[00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:13.360]   Listen to him in writing to the Corinthians, first epistle in the fourteenth chapter and
[00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:14.360]   the twentieth verse.
[00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:25.640]   "Brethren," he says, "be not children in understanding, albeit," he says, "in malice, be children.
[00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:29.720]   But in understanding, be men."
[00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:36.480]   Be children in malice, grow less and less in that respect, reverse this process.
[00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:43.960]   Albeit in malice be ye children, but in understanding, be men.
[00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:47.800]   And again he's already said it in writing to the Romans in that last chapter in verse
[00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:48.800]   nineteen.
[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:52.680]   He says, "Your obedience has come abroad unto all men.
[00:14:52.680 --> 00:15:00.080]   I am glad therefore on your behalf, but yet I would have you wise unto that which is good
[00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:05.080]   and simple concerning evil."
[00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:10.600]   We ought to remain children as regards evil and even die altogether, but not with regard
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:11.600]   to that which is good.
[00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:15.280]   We ought to be wise with respect to that which is good.
[00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:20.040]   Very well then, we must no longer be children, but grow up and grow up in everything and
[00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:29.480]   in every respect, and grow up into him, unto him who is the head, even Christ.
[00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:30.960]   What does this mean?
[00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:37.000]   Well, this is again, as I say, another way of saying all that he's been saying in verse
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.800]   thirteen.
[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:45.920]   It means that as individual members and parts of this body, we all grow up into a conformity
[00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:48.920]   to the head.
[00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:55.840]   It's again this whole question of symmetry and of balance and of proportion.
[00:15:55.840 --> 00:16:01.320]   In other words, what he's saying is that every part of the body ought to be worthy
[00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:07.300]   of the head, ought to correspond to the head.
[00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:08.600]   We know what the head is like.
[00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:11.200]   The head is even Christ.
[00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:16.760]   So that every part of the body and every little portion, it doesn't matter how small or
[00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:21.360]   how apparently insignificant, should be in conformity, should be worthy, there should
[00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:24.200]   be no clash.
[00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:28.080]   You can think of obvious illustrations for yourself.
[00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:34.200]   You often find this lack of proportion and of symmetry in nature.
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:42.640]   You may see a very beautiful face with ugly hands, if you like, or a beautiful body and
[00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:44.760]   ugly legs or something like that.
[00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:50.280]   No, it's the opposite of that, the apostle says, is the ideal, that there should be no
[00:16:50.280 --> 00:17:00.120]   clash, as it were, but that the whole body should be perfect, absolutely perfectly proportioned,
[00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:07.800]   balanced, nothing standing out as a kind of oddity or eccentricity, but everything fitting
[00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:12.440]   in together perfectly and in due proportion.
[00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:15.840]   Oh, he says, that's the ideal.
[00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:20.080]   So let us speak the truth in love as we deal with one another.
[00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:24.960]   He's now inside the life of the church, so that we shall all be growing up like this,
[00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:31.440]   together, growing up together, at the same rate if possible, with the same kind of maturity,
[00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:40.600]   and so the whole body shall show this delightful proportion and beauty and perfection of form,
[00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:48.640]   and there shall be no clash as between the head and the various other parts of the body.
[00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:54.280]   But I think that there is also one other thing here which is rather important, and that is
[00:17:54.280 --> 00:18:03.560]   this, that every part of the body should be so developed as to be always ready to respond
[00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:10.960]   to him, not only to conform to him, but to be at his will and at his service, so that
[00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:16.320]   when he, the head, desires something, there shall be no hindrance, no let, no restraint
[00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:18.400]   in any part of the body.
[00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:24.480]   Well, very well, there, I say, is this first statement which he makes, but he continues
[00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:30.640]   in verse 16, and it is to this I want to advert most particularly this morning, because he
[00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:38.280]   goes on, you see, "Grow up in all things into him which is the head, even Christ, from
[00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:49.000]   whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplier,
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:53.640]   according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of
[00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:56.280]   the body unto the edifying of itself in love."
[00:18:56.280 --> 00:19:02.640]   Now, that is undoubtedly the most complicated thing that the Apostle Paul ever wrote.
[00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:07.520]   And it is interesting to notice how some of the commentators of the past, some of the
[00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:14.720]   fathers, in fact, in the Church, had the temerity even to suggest that he became rather muddled
[00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:21.400]   for once, and that his heart or something ran away with his head, and that he piled
[00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:26.360]   so many phrases upon phrases that he rather forgot what he was saying at the beginning
[00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:28.960]   of the sentence.
[00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:36.680]   It certainly is one of the most difficult verses on the surface in the whole of Scripture.
[00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:43.780]   It is an extremely difficult verse to read, and it is a difficult verse to understand
[00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:50.000]   unless you take in your hand the key that the Apostle himself has already provided for
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.760]   us in his previous statements.
[00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:57.800]   There is no doubt in my mind that what he was really doing was this.
[00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:04.000]   He was, as I say, winding up the whole matter, and he was so anxious that no part of it should
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:11.600]   be missing, that he certainly does produce a somewhat involved statement.
[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:17.400]   He adds things in order to make sure that nobody shall forget that particular aspect.
[00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:18.920]   Well what have we here?
[00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:28.600]   Well what we have really is another of his pictures of the Church as the body of Christ.
[00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:34.840]   We have had occasion to remark already that this is undoubtedly his favorite picture when
[00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:37.840]   he comes to describe the Church.
[00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:44.240]   But even this picture is inadequate, for we shall notice, even as we look at this particular
[00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:51.600]   picture, that there are senses in which he himself goes beyond his picture, because the
[00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:56.040]   picture, however good it is, can never convey the full truth.
[00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:59.040]   That is the trouble with every illustration.
[00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:01.280]   Illustrations are all right, but they are never enough.
[00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:05.440]   That is why you have to use several, and the Apostle in dealing with the Church does use
[00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:06.440]   many.
[00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:10.080]   The Church is the body, the Church is the building, the Church is the bride, and so
[00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:11.080]   on.
[00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:13.040]   The Church is a great commonwealth.
[00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:16.760]   Now that is because no one of them can say everything.
[00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:21.520]   And here in this particular picture, though it is the most adequate of them all, there
[00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:23.960]   are nevertheless certain difficulties.
[00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:30.160]   Now the best plan, it seems to me, is that I look with you at the particular terms first
[00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:34.160]   of all, and then look at the whole.
[00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:39.520]   Here is a picture again, then, of the Church as the body of Christ.
[00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:44.000]   The first thing he says is that the head is Christ.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   From whom?
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:53.320]   He has already been saying, "Which is the head, even Christ, from whom?"
[00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:55.720]   He always starts there.
[00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:57.280]   We must always start there.
[00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:02.640]   He has already done it in the first chapter, where he is talking about the risen Lord,
[00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:07.280]   and says that God hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over
[00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:13.360]   all things, to the Church, which is his body, the fullness of him that filleth all in all.
[00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:17.880]   It is repetition, but most wonderful repetition.
[00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:20.080]   And we must always start with this.
[00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:23.160]   Christ is the head of the Church.
[00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:31.240]   He is the source of all her life, her energy, her growth, her everything else.
[00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:35.040]   And apart from him there is no Church, and could not be.
[00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:36.040]   Christ is the head.
[00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:42.800]   Very well, let us go on to consider our position.
[00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:46.800]   And here he makes two statements.
[00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:55.080]   What he says about us is that we are being fitly joined together, and also, secondly,
[00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:56.440]   compacted.
[00:22:56.440 --> 00:23:00.640]   Now take this phrase, "fitly joined together."
[00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:01.640]   What does that mean?
[00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:06.960]   Well, very fortunately, again, he has already given us the same thing previously, in the
[00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:18.520]   second chapter, there in verse 21, in which he says, "All the building fitly framed together
[00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:24.520]   groweth unto one holy temple in the Lord."
[00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:29.360]   And at that time, you may remember that I pointed out that here he was mixing his metaphors,
[00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:33.480]   that having started with the building, he turns to the body.
[00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:46.360]   Fitly framed together means parts fitted closely to each other, a kind of harmony.
[00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:50.840]   It is the very word that he actually uses.
[00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:57.640]   It means several parts bound together, fitting into one another.
[00:23:57.640 --> 00:23:58.640]   That is his first phrase.
[00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:00.600]   Now here he is talking about us.
[00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:02.320]   The head of the body is Christ.
[00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:08.000]   We are members in particular, and these members are articulated.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.840]   They fit into one another.
[00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:14.640]   Everything goes into position, ball and socket.
[00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:17.240]   There it is, articulated.
[00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:24.080]   Fitly framed together, fitly joined together.
[00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:27.560]   All these terms mean exactly the same thing.
[00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:35.280]   The idea is of a number of parts, not simply bound together anyhow somehow, but bound together
[00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:41.040]   in the amazing way in which the various parts of our bodies are joined together.
[00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:46.880]   And this is where one rejoices in a certain amount of knowledge of anatomy.
[00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:48.080]   You think of a joint.
[00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:49.760]   The thing is so perfect.
[00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:57.520]   There, as it were, is a kind of cup, and into that cup fits this other end, this ball, and
[00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:02.800]   the surfaces are smooth so that there is no friction, and everything works easily and
[00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:05.320]   smoothly and in a supple manner.
[00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:09.400]   That is what he is conveying, and that is how members of the Church are to be, and that
[00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:12.360]   is how they are to grow up into him in all things.
[00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:17.680]   And this is the perfection of the Christian Church, every member being what he is meant
[00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:22.960]   to be, yes, and fitting in with every other member, preserving the unity of the Spirit
[00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:30.040]   in the bond of peace, no creaking in the joints, as it were, no angularities, but everything
[00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:33.000]   fitly joined together.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.240]   But you see, he is not even content with that.
[00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:40.000]   He adds another phrase, "compacted."
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:49.400]   And compacted means closely knit, and of course he uses it in order to drive home the point.
[00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:55.880]   Brought and held together, that is what compacted means.
[00:25:55.880 --> 00:26:04.880]   And it is a term that is often used in a figurative sense to mean a kind of mental unity, sympathy
[00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:09.480]   of understanding, concord.
[00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:15.080]   So you see, he is slightly changing his emphasis from the purely mechanical, which you have
[00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:23.880]   in fitly joined together, you have this further notion of minds fitting in together, compacted,
[00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:31.280]   closely knit, as is essential, of course, for a true unity, for an organic unity, and
[00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:32.280]   for proper working.
[00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:34.880]   Well, there is the second thing.
[00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:42.040]   Christ is the head, and here are we as the parts, and that is our condition, fitly framed
[00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:46.360]   together, fitly joined together and compacted.
[00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:57.080]   But now we ask the question, how is all this brought into being, and how is all this maintained?
[00:26:57.080 --> 00:27:02.320]   How can this being joined together and compacted and in the relationship to the head, how is
[00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:06.760]   all this brought about, and how is it kept going, how is it maintained?
[00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:14.480]   Now here we come to one of the most difficult of his phrases, where he says, "By that which
[00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:20.160]   every joint supplieth."
[00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:26.160]   And the difficulty there is over the word "joint," because we instinctively think of
[00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:32.680]   the word "joint" in the way that I've already been using it, of this ball and socket, as
[00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:36.360]   it were, this fitting in, the actual joints.
[00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:38.520]   Well, no, the apostle doesn't mean that.
[00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:44.040]   He's already dealt with that when he says that we are fitly joined together.
[00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:50.120]   So that it would be better to translate the word translated "joint" by the word "band,"
[00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:55.400]   by every band, or if you like, by every connecting link.
[00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:56.720]   That's what "joint" means here.
[00:27:56.720 --> 00:28:03.960]   It doesn't mean an actual joint, it means a band, a connecting link.
[00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:11.080]   In other words, what he is saying at this point is that these bands not merely unite
[00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:16.720]   us together, they do that, but they do something much more important.
[00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:25.760]   It is through these bands, or joints of connection, that the supply of the life and the energy
[00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:30.840]   passes for every part.
[00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:36.040]   You see, this is really misleading to read "which every joint supplieth."
[00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:40.240]   It rather gives the impression that it is the joint that does the supplying that isn't
[00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:41.240]   so.
[00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:45.680]   What he is saying is this, that the supply comes through the joint.
[00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:48.220]   The supply comes through the band.
[00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:54.360]   So that some would translate it like this, "through every joint for supply," or "every
[00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:57.840]   joint which serves for supply."
[00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:00.600]   That's better.
[00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:08.360]   In other words, these joints that he is talking about, these bands, are the channels through
[00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:17.640]   which the supply of life and nutriment and energy passes to all the various parts of
[00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:18.640]   the body.
[00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:23.160]   The supply, if you like, communicated through every joint.
[00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:24.920]   That's a better way of translating it.
[00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:31.520]   So we read, "from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted through the
[00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:40.040]   supply communicated by or through every joint."
[00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:41.960]   And take this word "supply."
[00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:45.480]   This is the most important one.
[00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:55.600]   The word the apostle used carries the meaning of an abundant supply, a superabundance.
[00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:56.840]   It isn't just enough.
[00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:59.160]   No, there is an abundant supply.
[00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:01.840]   I have already quoted it this morning.
[00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:08.280]   John puts it in the prologue of his Gospel and says, "of his fullness we received and
[00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:09.400]   grace upon grace."
[00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:11.400]   Paul has already been saying it.
[00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:16.160]   He has talked in the second chapter of the exceeding riches of his grace.
[00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:19.800]   He has spoken about the love of Christ which passes knowledge.
[00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:24.400]   He has talked about being filled with all the fullness of God.
[00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:27.240]   That is the supply, this abundant supply.
[00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:32.760]   And it comes through the various members of the body, through these channels or joints
[00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:39.640]   of communication, these channels of supply along which it passes.
[00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:45.360]   Now that is what he means, therefore, by "fitly joined together and compacted by that which
[00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:49.240]   every joint supplieth."
[00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:56.240]   And then he adds something even to that, "according to the effectual working in the measure of
[00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:57.240]   every part."
[00:30:57.240 --> 00:31:09.920]   Now, "effectual working" means operative energy, it's energy that does something.
[00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:16.360]   And "the measure of every part" means the capacity of each part.
[00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:23.080]   "According to the effectual working in the measure of every part."
[00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:26.640]   Well, this clearly means this.
[00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:36.520]   This operative energy, this vital power of which he says there is an abundant supply,
[00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:41.960]   passes through the bands of communication to every part.
[00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:43.960]   And how much is given to every part?
[00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:52.120]   Well, he says, what is given to every part is according to the measure of its capacity.
[00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:57.920]   Each part in the body doesn't receive the same amount, but each one, he says, does receive
[00:31:57.920 --> 00:32:02.920]   all that it needs according to the measure of its capacity.
[00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:10.880]   That is the explanation of the effectual working in the measure of every part.
[00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:13.520]   I do hope we are catching this idea.
[00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:15.600]   This is what he's saying.
[00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:19.560]   "There is the head of the body, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:24.280]   Here are we as individual members.
[00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:29.160]   We are all to function as the head desires us to do, and we are all fitly joined together,
[00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:35.480]   and we are compacted, and all this is held together and kept going by these bands of
[00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:36.480]   supply.
[00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:42.160]   Then there is this endless supply that comes down, and every single part, it doesn't matter
[00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:46.600]   whether it's great or small or medium, it's absolutely full.
[00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:49.440]   It gets all that it needs and no more.
[00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:51.760]   It isn't all identical.
[00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:53.400]   We are not all absolutely the same.
[00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:58.120]   No, no, we differ tremendously, but every one of us has got a capacity, and every one
[00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:00.640]   of us is going to be filled according to his capacity."
[00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:05.800]   Now, you see, I said at the beginning that he's summing up here, that he's repeating.
[00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:14.560]   Now he said all that in verse 7, "And to every one of us is given grace according to
[00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:16.720]   the measure of the gift of Christ."
[00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:20.920]   That's it.
[00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:24.280]   There are differences in administrations.
[00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:27.680]   There are diversities of gifts.
[00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:32.080]   There are members of the body that are more important than others, more comely than others.
[00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:36.840]   Read 1 Corinthians 12, and there you'll find a detailed exposition of all that.
[00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:42.440]   The eye and the hand and the foot and the smelling and the tasting and so on, all these
[00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:49.560]   are not equal in importance in that particular sense, but they're all members of the body,
[00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:52.480]   and they're all equally important in that sense.
[00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:59.320]   And what he's saying here is this, that every part is given a full and an abundant supply
[00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:01.980]   of the life and the energy.
[00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:08.040]   So as to enable it to carry out its particular function in a perfect manner.
[00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:09.960]   Very well.
[00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:12.760]   What is the object of all this?
[00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:16.040]   Why is the church so constituted?
[00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:18.960]   Why is the body thus constructed?
[00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:28.240]   And he says the object is this, "It all makes for the increased growth of the body."
[00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:29.640]   That's what it is for.
[00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:37.120]   You see, he's got a kind of parenthesis here, "From whom the whole body fitly joined together
[00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:41.160]   and compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the
[00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:49.080]   measure of every part, maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love."
[00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:55.240]   In other words, the church has been thus constituted in this marvelous manner in order that it
[00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:57.640]   may grow.
[00:34:57.640 --> 00:35:02.120]   That's why you've got the joints fitting in, that is why you've got these bands of communication,
[00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:06.280]   that's the object of this abundant supply, that all the body may grow.
[00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:14.600]   The whole body, you notice he says that, "From whom the whole body fitly joined together,"
[00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:15.960]   etc.
[00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:19.440]   It is to promote this growth.
[00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:22.960]   And that of course can be put in another way by saying, "In order that the body may be
[00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:24.240]   built up."
[00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:26.720]   We've already seen that before.
[00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:31.240]   For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying, the
[00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:36.800]   building up of the body of Christ.
[00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:43.720]   And then, lest we forget what he was talking about at the very beginning, he adds his word
[00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:54.880]   to the edifying of itself in love, because love is the final perfection.
[00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:59.320]   "Where abideth now faith, hope, and love, but the greatest of these is love."
[00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:01.880]   And in this matter of unity, what is more important?
[00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:04.520]   If the head is love, the body must be love.
[00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:10.440]   We are to conform to the head, and he is love, everlasting, eternal love that became incarnate
[00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:13.080]   love, and the body is to correspond to him.
[00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:19.680]   So we build up ourselves and we grow together in love.
[00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:25.960]   Very well, let me give you another translation of the entire statement.
[00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:36.680]   From whom all the body, being closely bound together and constantly being knit together
[00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:42.760]   through the bands through which the abundant supply passes of the vital energy which is
[00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:50.880]   put forth for the capacity of each part, makes for the increased growth of the body, resulting
[00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:54.320]   in the building up of itself in love.
[00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:58.440]   That is what he is really saying.
[00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:04.520]   Now you notice that here there is indeed something which is very similar to and very reminiscent
[00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:09.840]   of the human body.
[00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:15.520]   And the apostle, you see, writing nearly two thousand years ago, seems to have known sufficient
[00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:22.080]   about physiology to use this particular illustration.
[00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:26.880]   Think of the human body.
[00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:30.560]   There is the head containing the brain.
[00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:38.240]   Now the important thing is that the whole nervous system of the body comes out originally
[00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:43.360]   from that brain and is connected to it.
[00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:51.840]   Take the smallest little nerve or nerve tendril in the tip of your finger, you can trace it
[00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:56.360]   all the way back right to the brain.
[00:37:56.360 --> 00:38:02.040]   It goes back into the spinal cord and that in turn sends up its bands that go right up
[00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:06.320]   to the brain, the center of control, the highest center of all.
[00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:09.920]   Now the apostle is really saying something like this.
[00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:12.640]   You see our bodies are very marvelous in this respect.
[00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:17.520]   There is all this articulation that I have been talking about, joint fitting into joint,
[00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:21.320]   forearm fitting into arm, arm into the trunk and all the rest of it.
[00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:26.680]   Yes, but over and above all that there are these other bands of communication.
[00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:32.480]   The nervous system keeps the whole body one and keeps it together and makes it an organic
[00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:37.960]   unity in a way that your ligaments and your joints do not do so.
[00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:42.680]   And the same thing can be said of course about the blood system, the vascular system.
[00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:45.600]   That again combines everything together.
[00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:51.320]   It all starts in the heart and it doesn't matter the smallest venule in your fingertip,
[00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:55.360]   you can trace it right back to the heart and it goes through its various processes.
[00:38:55.360 --> 00:39:04.400]   So your nervous system and your vascular system correspond as it were to these bands of supply
[00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:06.480]   that he is talking about.
[00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:11.320]   And this is the remarkable thing, that the energy, the nervous energy with which I move
[00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:15.000]   my little finger, rarely comes originally from my brain.
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:20.600]   I initiate that movement and I send out energy which passes through and there I am able to
[00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:21.600]   do that.
[00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:28.760]   Now that is the kind of idea that the apostle has got here.
[00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:33.960]   And to that extent his picture, I say, is a very perfect one and is a very wonderful
[00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:34.960]   one.
[00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:41.840]   And what he is saying is that the supply, the origin of life and energy and power and
[00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:49.560]   sustenance and all we need is in the head, which is Christ himself.
[00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:55.560]   And it passes down to every part of the body.
[00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:58.080]   His analogy breaks down in one sense.
[00:39:58.080 --> 00:40:01.880]   He says, "From whom that the whole body comes out of the head."
[00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:05.740]   Well actually, in physical terms that isn't true.
[00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:09.160]   But you see that is where no illustration, as I said, is perfect.
[00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:11.420]   The body does not develop out of the head.
[00:40:11.420 --> 00:40:13.940]   That is not correct.
[00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:17.620]   But forget that, that is just the defect of any illustration.
[00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:24.360]   But hold on to these other aspects, these bands of communication and the energy and
[00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:29.000]   the life that is in the head and that passes through to every part of the body.
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:35.200]   But you notice this, there is a kind of paradox here.
[00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:38.840]   He sounds as if he is contradicting himself and yet he isn't.
[00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:43.360]   He says on the one hand that everything comes from the head and yet he has said that every
[00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:49.440]   part of the body has got its supply according to its capacity in order that the whole may
[00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:54.240]   grow up and develop and edify itself in love.
[00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:55.240]   Is there a contradiction?
[00:40:55.240 --> 00:41:00.460]   No, there isn't, for this reason.
[00:41:00.460 --> 00:41:07.640]   The growth of the whole depends in a sense upon the condition of every part.
[00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:12.480]   Ultimately, we are all entirely dependent upon the head.
[00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:18.440]   He alone is the source of supply and yet it is true to say at the same time that if there
[00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:24.040]   is any defect in any part, well then the development of the whole is interrupted and interfered
[00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:26.160]   with.
[00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:31.440]   And that of course is because of this wonderful interrelationship, this organic unity that
[00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:34.160]   obtains between the various parts of the body.
[00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:38.220]   Let me give you a simple illustration.
[00:41:38.220 --> 00:41:41.280]   You may say what really matters is the condition of my brain.
[00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:48.560]   There is my seat of vital nervous energy and of power, my thinking and my ultimate ability.
[00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:52.760]   And you say, in comparison, what is the significance of a little finger?
[00:41:52.760 --> 00:42:00.560]   Well, I'll tell you what the significance of the little finger is.
[00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:07.240]   If you suddenly develop an acute infection in the tip of your little finger, if a thorn
[00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:14.240]   from a rose bush goes into it and it becomes acutely infected, it begins to throb and you
[00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:15.440]   are getting terrible pain.
[00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:18.400]   Yes, but not only that.
[00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:21.360]   You yourself become ill.
[00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:23.880]   You get a headache.
[00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:29.000]   And though you have got your great brain, you cannot use it, you cannot think.
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:33.920]   The pain, the disease in the little finger puts a kind of paralysis, as it were, upon
[00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:34.920]   the head.
[00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:35.920]   Now that is an illustration.
[00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:39.600]   We don't press it too far, but there is great truth in the illustration.
[00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:43.280]   It is what the apostle is saying.
[00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:46.040]   Christ for the purposes of the Church is the head.
[00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:48.840]   He is not bound to the Church.
[00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:54.800]   And yet there is a sense in which a kind of limit is placed even upon him by the failure
[00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:55.800]   of the Church.
[00:42:55.800 --> 00:43:03.560]   Thank God, not in an ultimate sense, yes, but it is true in a temporary sense.
[00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:08.680]   So that the apostle says that if the whole body is to grow and to develop and to build
[00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:13.240]   itself up in love, well then it is very important that every particular part should be filled
[00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:19.680]   up to its capacity with this vital life and energy, and then as the whole is perfect,
[00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:25.400]   the whole grows and develops in its maturity.
[00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:31.560]   So you see that every single member of the Church is of most vital importance.
[00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:35.920]   Well, I leave it at that this morning.
[00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:42.040]   It is not surprising, is it, that the apostle Pilate, term upon term, was concerned to show
[00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:49.440]   the glory of the Church, the glory of our position as individual members of the Church.
[00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:51.960]   Fancy being in such a body.
[00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:54.000]   Fancy belonging to the head.
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.440]   Fancy receiving the supply from him.
[00:43:56.440 --> 00:43:59.320]   Have you received up to your capacity?
[00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:01.120]   Are you fulfilling your function?
[00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:05.360]   Are you brimming and teeming and tingling with life?
[00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:10.760]   Is this vital energy of Christ the head in you, whatever you are, whatever your place
[00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:13.920]   in the Church this morning?
[00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:16.920]   That is our privilege.
[00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:25.640]   And then think of your responsibility, your responsibility as a member of this body.
[00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:33.320]   Are you causing pain and trouble in other parts of the body by being diseased, by being
[00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:38.880]   sinful or failing, or being lethargic?
[00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:41.480]   These are the questions that inevitably arise.
[00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:45.720]   Ah, the apostle's great appeal is this.
[00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:47.720]   Let us no longer be children.
[00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:53.080]   Let us no longer remain undeveloped, but let us all grow up in everything.
[00:44:53.080 --> 00:45:00.440]   And to him who is the head, even Christ, from whom the whole body fitly joined together
[00:45:00.440 --> 00:45:09.320]   and compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the measure of every part, maketh
[00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:16.680]   increase of the body unto the edifying of itself.
[00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:19.960]   In love.
[00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:25.040]   There is no value in intellectual knowledge unless it finally leads to love.
[00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:28.440]   There is no value in any emotion unless it leads to love.
[00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:33.000]   Our works are useless if they do not produce this love.
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:37.600]   Though I give my body to be burned and have not charity, what's the value of it?
[00:45:37.600 --> 00:45:40.160]   What's the value of anything?
[00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:44.680]   So we build up ourselves in love.
[00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:49.480]   Amen.
