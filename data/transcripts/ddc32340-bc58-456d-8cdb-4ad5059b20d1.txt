[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.620]   I am James Hong and welcome to the Surpassing Value Podcast.
[00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.740]   The fuel and desire for this podcast was born out of a compulsion to flesh out what's
[00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.600]   been going on in the midst of an ocean of megaphones that may not actually withstand
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.620]   the test of scrutiny.
[00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:32.320]   As a signpost theologian, I will do my best to filter out the impurities and point people
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:38.320]   in the right direction.
[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:47.060]   For episodes 7 and 8, I wanted to spend some time and talk about Karl Marx and Marxism.
[00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:52.680]   I initially tried to make this one episode, but once I put the episode together, I realized
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:59.300]   it was way too big of a beast, so I cut it up into two different episodes.
[00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:05.980]   If possible, the best thing to do will be listen to the episodes back to back only because
[00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:13.720]   these ideas are so dense and they're so interlinked.
[00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.000]   On to Marxism.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.500]   Marxism has been thrown around quite a bit recently.
[00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:26.600]   In conservative circles, it's become a scarlet letter of sorts and my perception is that
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:34.120]   many people who throw the term might not have the tightest grasp of what it is.
[00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:39.080]   There are others who immediately upon hearing the word decry it as some kind of scapegoat
[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.280]   only used to defend ruthless capitalism.
[00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.920]   With respect to social justice issues, Patrice Collors, one of the co-founders of the organization
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:56.080]   called BLM, described herself as a "trained Marxist."
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.120]   So what exactly is it?
[00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:03.440]   Is it merely an economic philosophy that's either harmful, benign, or neutral?
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.560]   If it is an economic philosophy, what's the danger in embracing it?
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.160]   Shouldn't good-hearted people such as Christians be compassionate and isn't one way to be
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.840]   compassionate and embrace of Marxism?
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:24.600]   Moreover, the dialectic that is typically framed is Marxism versus capitalism.
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:33.240]   So as Christians, we need not be worried since we are above this dialectic, or so the narrative
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.280]   seems to be.
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.600]   Then there are others who will be quick to assail you even if you attempt to levy some
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:46.440]   type of critique of Marxism because somehow that just seems to be the morally superior
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:53.800]   thing to do while somehow displaying their own cognitive dissonance of their own attitude.
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:59.760]   Whatever the case, Marxism, once thought to be completely dormant by the majority, has
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:07.900]   found renewed interest for differing motivations while evoking differing sentiments.
[00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:13.320]   For that reason alone, it might be wise to see for ourselves what this is and go to the
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.320]   source.
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:20.040]   My plan this episode is to lay out for you exactly what it is by going to the source.
[00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:25.720]   But in order for the source to make more sense, I want to take a little bit of time talking
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.000]   about the Industrial Revolution.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.040]   It was during the Industrial Revolution that the Communist Manifesto, aka Marxism, was
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.460]   birthed.
[00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:41.360]   It was during the Industrial Revolution that goods that were outside the reach of the masses
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.720]   started to become much more affordable.
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.940]   Modern labor was able to be allocated much more efficiently because of the inventions
[00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:53.960]   of the time of various different machinery like the telegraph and the spindle.
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:58.520]   Importing and exporting around the globe began to abound for the first time.
[00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:01.300]   Modern medicine was able to make leaps.
[00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:07.160]   It created a diversified panel of jobs, allowing for greater opportunity.
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:14.400]   It just created more economic opportunities for more people, vastly more people.
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:22.280]   At the very same time, it led to massive overcrowding in urban cities since that's where the epicenters
[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:29.880]   of the revolution was, massive amounts of pollution in those areas, and extremely poor
[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.880]   working conditions for these masses.
[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:39.060]   In order to meet the demand for labor, it was typical to have very poorly constructed
[00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:46.600]   housing for these workers right next to the epicenters.
[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:51.180]   Let's not even talk about child labor laws since they just didn't exist back then.
[00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:58.280]   The prevailing ideology during this explosion, during the Industrial Revolution, was laissez-faire
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:03.600]   capitalism which could be defined as an economic system in which transactions between private
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:12.640]   parties are absent of any form of economic interventionism such as regulation and subsidies.
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:19.800]   To put the Industrial Revolution in one sentence, it would not be unfair to say it was the best
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:27.360]   of times and it was the worst of times, just like most of history.
[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.720]   That was the Industrial Revolution.
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:39.360]   Karl Marx himself was born in 1818 in Prussia.
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:45.080]   Marx grew to love philosophy with a passion, particularly the works of George Hegel.
[00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:49.720]   It would be accurate to say that his entire worldview was shaped by his thought.
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:56.080]   George Hegel was a recently deceased philosopher and his works were widely discussed in Europe
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:02.120]   at the time and he was the father of the Hegelian dialectic.
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.520]   Marx himself had somewhat of an up-and-down life.
[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:10.680]   He eventually ended up penniless, dying from illness with about 13 people attending his
[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:11.680]   funeral.
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:16.560]   Interestingly, being a lifelong atheist, he was buried in East London in Highgate Cemetery
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.680]   in an area reserved for atheists and agnostics.
[00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:27.040]   It was in between this time he befriended Friedrich Engels and wrote Das Kapital, which
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:31.720]   was a critique of capitalism, and The Communist Manifesto.
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:38.400]   The Communist Manifesto begins with the proposition that the entirety of human history is one
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.240]   group exploiting another.
[00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:47.720]   This building block is axiomatic for Karl Marx.
[00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:53.680]   Let me quote to you from the Communist Manifesto.
[00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:59.120]   The history of all hitherto existing society is a history of class struggles.
[00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:04.720]   Freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guildmaster and journeyman,
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:11.200]   in a word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant opposition to one another, carried
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:16.980]   on an uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight, a fight that each time ended either
[00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:23.480]   in a revolutionary reconstitution of society at large, or in the common ruin of the contending
[00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:26.520]   classes.
[00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:28.800]   So again, we have two classes here.
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:32.980]   You are either oppressor or the oppressed.
[00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:36.400]   In other words, and he's going to state this in The Communist Manifesto, you are either
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:39.280]   the bourgeoisie or the proletariat.
[00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:42.280]   The bourgeoisie is not some fancy name for the 1%.
[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:45.480]   The bourgeoisie is just the middle class.
[00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:48.720]   The proletariat is the working class.
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:52.960]   The working class, don't think of a contemporary blue collar worker.
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:58.480]   The working class during that time will be something more akin to someone working, let's
[00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:03.120]   say, in a sweatshop in some part of Southeast Asia.
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:07.880]   The proletariat, according to Karl Marx, is at the mercy of the bourgeoisie.
[00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:14.140]   The bourgeoisie has and continues to oppress the proletariat, and the continuity of oppression
[00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:17.080]   is easy to see, according to Karl Marx.
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:20.360]   Again, the bourgeoisie is not the king.
[00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:27.080]   The bourgeoisie is just what we would think of as the middle class.
[00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:33.500]   So according to Karl Marx, because of the rise of global imports and exports, we just
[00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:38.880]   talked about the Industrial Revolution, because of the rise of global imports, exports, the
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:44.840]   bourgeoisie will always continue to maintain their dominance over the proletariat.
[00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:51.040]   Less civilized nations will eventually be subsumed within the civilized nations, resulting
[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:54.600]   in only an increase of power to the bourgeoisie.
[00:08:54.600 --> 00:09:01.760]   Despite all this, Marx predicts that the bourgeoisie will eventually be overthrown by the proletariat.
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:06.400]   Because of overproduction and overconsumption, resentment between the two classes will spill
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:10.600]   over into a new revolution.
[00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:25.240]   What Marx misses in the Communist Manifesto is that in reality, people typically move
[00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:29.400]   from the proletariat class to the bourgeoisie class.
[00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:32.660]   That's how freedom works.
[00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:38.280]   According to Marx though, a person is stagnant, meaning once you're in the proletariat class,
[00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:39.280]   you stay there.
[00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:41.480]   Once you're in the bourgeoisie class, you stay there.
[00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:46.920]   But in reality, even back then, what he missed was that people will typically start in the
[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:54.200]   proletariat class, and in a free society, you have the room and you have the ability
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:57.440]   to move into the bourgeoisie class.
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:12.120]   This phenomenon is documented and proven heavily by the economist Thomas Sowell.
[00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:26.880]   Because of Marx's own philosophy, one of his goals is the abolition of private property.
[00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:32.020]   And I quote, "In this sense, the theory of the Communists may be summed up in the
[00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:36.040]   single sentence, "Abolition of private property."
[00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:40.540]   We Communists have been reproached with the desire of abolishing the right of personally
[00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:45.680]   acquiring property as the fruit of a man's own labor, which property is alleged to be
[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:50.080]   the groundwork of all personal freedom, activity, and independence.
[00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:56.000]   In one word, you reproach us with intending to do away with your property.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.680]   Precisely so.
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:03.960]   That is just what we intend."
[00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:10.640]   So Marx understood the accusation levied at him was that he wanted to abolish private
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:11.640]   property.
[00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:14.360]   And he says, "You are exactly right.
[00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:17.880]   That is exactly what I want to do."
[00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:29.680]   For Marx, private property is inherently linked with power.
[00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:35.880]   Marx then goes on to define what he perceives to be the bourgeoisie definition of individuality
[00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:38.500]   and freedom.
[00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:43.120]   He goes on to define it because he does not like individuality or freedom.
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:52.540]   So he is going to assign some exclusive meanings, "And the abolition of this state of things
[00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:58.520]   is called by the bourgeoisie abolition of individuality and freedom, and rightly so.
[00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:04.600]   The abolition of bourgeois individuality, bourgeois independence, and bourgeois freedom
[00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:07.360]   is undoubtedly aimed at.
[00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:12.600]   By freedom is meant, under the present bourgeois conditions of production, free trade, free
[00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:14.280]   selling and buying.
[00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:19.320]   But if selling and buying disappears, free selling and buying disappears also.
[00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:23.880]   This talk about free selling and buying, and all the other brave words of our bourgeois
[00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:29.240]   about freedom in general, have a meaning, if any, only in contrast with restricted selling
[00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:34.240]   and buying, with the unfettered traders of the Middle Ages, but have no meaning when
[00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:39.700]   opposed to the communistic abolition of buying and selling, of the bourgeois conditions of
[00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:45.120]   production and the bourgeoisie itself."
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:52.800]   According to Marx, the bourgeoisie definition of individuality is inextricably linked to
[00:12:52.800 --> 00:13:01.200]   free trade which is in turn inextricably linked to bourgeoisie power.
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:08.440]   Only the bourgeoisie have individuality since the laborer to him is nameless and faceless.
[00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:12.320]   According to Marx, freedom is the ability to buy, sell, and trade and only the bourgeoisie
[00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:16.000]   have that, so that must be dissolved too.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:24.040]   So in order to abolish private property, the proletariat must use the vehicle of democracy
[00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:30.760]   since there are more in the proletariat class than there are in the bourgeoisie class.
[00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:38.280]   "The proletariat will use its political supremacy to wrest, by degree, all capital
[00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:44.440]   from the bourgeoisie, to centralize all instruments of production in the hands of the state, of
[00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:50.140]   the proletariat organized as the ruling class, and to increase the total productive forces
[00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:52.040]   as rapidly as possible.
[00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:57.280]   Of course, in the beginning, this cannot be effected except by means of despotic inroads
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:02.240]   on the rights of property and on the conditions of bourgeois production by means of measure
[00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:07.360]   therefore which appear economically insufficient and untenable, but which in the course of
[00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:13.400]   the movement outstrip themselves, necessitate further inroads upon the old social order,
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:20.480]   and are unavoidable as a means of entirely revolutionizing the mode of production.
[00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:23.440]   These measures will, of course, be different in different countries.
[00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:30.080]   Nevertheless, in most advanced countries, the following will be pretty generally applicable.
[00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:35.560]   Abolition of property and land, and application of all rents of land to public purposes.
[00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:39.680]   A heavy, progressive, or graduated income tax.
[00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:43.080]   Abolition of all rights of inheritance.
[00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:47.180]   Confiscation of the property of all immigrants and rebels.
[00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:51.840]   Centralization of credit in the hands of the state, by means of a national bank, with state
[00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:55.520]   capital and an exclusive monopoly.
[00:14:55.520 --> 00:15:00.080]   Centralization of the means of communication and transport in the hands of the state.
[00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:03.240]   Extension of factories and instruments of production owned by the state.
[00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:07.860]   The bringing into cultivation of wastelands, and the improvement of the soil generally
[00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:10.360]   in accordance with a common plan.
[00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:12.840]   Equal liability of all to work.
[00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:16.600]   Establishment of industrial armies, especially for agriculture.
[00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:20.400]   Combination of agriculture with manufacturing industries.
[00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:25.360]   Equal abolition of all the distinction between the town and country, by a more equitable
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:28.600]   distribution of the populace over the country.
[00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:32.200]   Free education for all children in public schools.
[00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:35.200]   Abolition of children's factory labor in its present form.
[00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:41.680]   Combination of education with industrial production."
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:49.120]   According to Marx, once property is abolished, everything, everything will belong to the
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:52.560]   state and be centralized.
[00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:59.840]   There will be heavy taxation, and former property owners who fled because of the rise of this
[00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:05.960]   centralized government will have their property taken from them and now owned by the state.
[00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:14.120]   Every aspect of life is going to be centralized and belongs to the state, including the banking
[00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:16.520]   system and transportation.
[00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:23.480]   In order to keep continuity, the state will have close guards on education and the nuclear
[00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:26.000]   family as well.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:31.460]   Since the current status of the family by the bourgeoisie has relegated it to nothing
[00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:40.880]   more than economics, according to Marx, the family must be abolished.
[00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:47.840]   According to Marx, the family must be abolished.
[00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:50.200]   Abolition of the family.
[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:55.520]   Even the most radical flare up at this infamous proposal of the communists.
[00:16:55.520 --> 00:17:00.360]   On what foundation is the present family, the bourgeois family, based?
[00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:01.400]   On capital.
[00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:03.400]   On private gain.
[00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:09.420]   In its completely developed form, this family exists only among the bourgeoisie.
[00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:14.280]   But this state of things finds its complement in the practical absence of the family among
[00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:17.920]   the proletarians and in public prostitution.
[00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:23.680]   The bourgeois family will vanish as a matter of course when its complement vanishes, and
[00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:31.760]   both will vanish with the vanishing of capital."
[00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:39.580]   According to Marx, any fault of fractured familial relations within the proletariat
[00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:48.820]   are due to the current capitalistic system held onto by the bourgeoisie.
[00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:51.840]   Let me say it a different way.
[00:17:51.840 --> 00:18:00.480]   Any issue within the nuclear family, if you're part of the proletariat class, is completely
[00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:08.320]   the fault of the other class of people.
[00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:15.460]   Based on that reasoning, we need to do completely with the nuclear family.
[00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:18.440]   We need to completely do away with it.
[00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:25.160]   And I quote, "But," you say, "we destroy the most hallowed of relations when we replace
[00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:27.520]   home education by social.
[00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:32.760]   But your education is not that also social and determined by the social conditions under
[00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:39.520]   which you educate, by the intervention, direct or indirect, of society by means of schools.
[00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:45.200]   The communists have not invented the intervention of society and education, and they do but
[00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:50.120]   seek to alter the character of that intervention and to rescue education from the influence
[00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:51.840]   of the ruling class.
[00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:57.520]   The bourgeoisie claptrap about the family and education, about the hallowed co-relation
[00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:02.520]   of parents and child, becomes all the more disgusting, the more by the action of modern
[00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:07.400]   industry."
[00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:15.600]   According to Marx, the state will indoctrinate the children since there will be no more nuclear
[00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:24.640]   family and we need to keep communism going so the state needs to be in charge of raising
[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:27.640]   children.
[00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:35.520]   In fact, this abolition of the nuclear family goes deep into the bonds of marriage itself.
[00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:43.440]   According to Marx, marriage itself is an impediment to the communist revolution.
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:51.240]   Marx ends with exactly that in the Communist Manifesto, a call to revolution.
[00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:57.880]   He bemoans how there have been softer versions of communism and that these softer versions
[00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:01.080]   only end up supporting the bourgeoisie.
[00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:07.080]   He then goes on to expand on this notion of the softer versions actually doing a disservice
[00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:13.360]   to the movement making it explicitly clear that nothing short of a revolution will do.
[00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:21.360]   According to Marx, nothing short of a revolution will do.
[00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:25.520]   The communists disdain to conceal their views and aims.
[00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:31.360]   They openly declare that their ends can be attained only by the forcible overthrow of
[00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:34.040]   all existing social conditions.
[00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:38.480]   Let the ruling classes tremble at a communistic revolution.
[00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:42.040]   The proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains.
[00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:45.960]   They have a world to win.
[00:20:45.960 --> 00:21:00.000]   Working men of all countries unite!
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.660]   The communists disdain to conceal their views and aims.
[00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:08.240]   They openly declare that their ends can be attained only by the forcible overthrow of
[00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:10.320]   all existing social conditions.
[00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:13.660]   Let the ruling classes tremble at a communistic revolution.
[00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:16.580]   The proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains.
[00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:19.000]   They have a world to win.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:24.680]   Working men of all countries unite!
[00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:48.160]   The 1963 US Communist Party's Goals, this is verbatim, just put this into a search engine.
[00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:55.540]   There are 45, I'm going to read you a handful.
[00:21:55.540 --> 00:22:02.400]   Number 12 to number 23, these are their goals, 1960 US Communist Party's Goals.
[00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:04.840]   Number 12 to number 23.
[00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:09.000]   Resist any attempt to outlaw the Communist Party.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.160]   Do away with all loyalty oaths.
[00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:17.560]   Continue giving Russia access to the US Patent Office.
[00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:22.680]   Capture one or both of the political parties in the United States.
[00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:28.320]   Use technical decisions of the courts to weaken basic American institutions by claiming their
[00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:32.100]   activities violate civil rights.
[00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:34.000]   Get control of the schools.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:40.040]   Use them as transmission belts for socialism and current communist propaganda.
[00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:41.500]   Soften the curriculum.
[00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:43.440]   Get control of teachers' associations.
[00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:46.640]   Put the party line in textbooks.
[00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:49.440]   Gain control of all student newspapers.
[00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:55.440]   Use student riots to foment public protests against programs or organizations which are
[00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:57.840]   under communist attack.
[00:22:57.840 --> 00:22:59.600]   Infiltrate the press.
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:04.960]   Get control of book review assignments, editorial writing, policy-making positions.
[00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:10.960]   Gain control of key positions in radio, TV, and motion pictures.
[00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:17.560]   Continue discrediting the American culture by degrading all forms of artistic expression.
[00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:23.840]   An American communist cell was told to eliminate all good sculpture from parks and buildings,
[00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:28.240]   substitute shapeless, awkward, and meaningless forms.
[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:31.720]   Control art critics and directors of art museums.
[00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:38.400]   Our plan is to promote ugliness, repulsive, meaningless art.
[00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:45.280]   I quote it to you verbatim, 12 to 23 of the 45.
[00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:49.800]   Let me quote to you 27 to 31.
[00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:56.160]   Infiltrate the churches and replace revealed religion with social religion.
[00:23:56.160 --> 00:24:01.680]   Discredit the Bible and emphasize the need for intellectual maturity which does not need
[00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:04.320]   a religious crutch.
[00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:09.680]   Eliminate prayer or any phase of religious expression in the schools on the ground that
[00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:14.040]   it violates the principle of separation of church and state.
[00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:18.920]   Discredit the American Constitution by calling it inadequate, old-fashioned, out of step
[00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:24.820]   with modern needs, a hindrance to cooperation between nations on a worldwide basis.
[00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:26.920]   Discredit the American Founding Fathers.
[00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:31.200]   Present them as selfish aristocrats who had no concern for the common man.
[00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:35.960]   Belittle all forms of American culture and discourage the teaching of American history
[00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:39.880]   on the ground that it was only a minor part of the big picture.
[00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:46.560]   Give more emphasis to Russian history since the communists took over.
[00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:49.720]   Number 39 to 43.
[00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:54.840]   Dominate the psychiatric profession and use mental health laws as a means of gaining coercive
[00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:58.940]   control over those who oppose communist goals.
[00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:04.200]   Discredit the family as an institution and encourage promiscuity and easy divorce.
[00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:08.760]   Emphasize the need to raise children away from the negative influence of parents.
[00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:15.480]   Attribute prejudices, mental blocks, and retarding of children to suppressive influence of parents.
[00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:20.760]   Create the impression that violence and insurrection are legitimate aspects of the American tradition
[00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:26.200]   that students and special interest groups should rise up and use united force to solve
[00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:29.680]   economic, political, or social problems.
[00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:35.120]   Overthrow all colonial governments before Native populations are ready for self-government.
[00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:47.840]   Wow.
[00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:54.960]   Maybe you're thinking, "Well, that's from 1963, right?"
[00:25:54.960 --> 00:26:05.200]   Does the listed communist goals from 1963 have any relevance to us today?
[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:10.640]   I'm going to end this episode here, but I'll cover the rest in the next episode.
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:14.320]   So if possible, try to, again, as I stated in the beginning, try to listen to these episodes
[00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:21.200]   back to back because it is a little dense, just to whet your appetite a bit.
[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:31.440]   I'll leave you with this question, along with the relevance of the U.S. Communist Party's
[00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:39.760]   goals from 1963, along with that, which I'll cover in the next episode.
[00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:49.360]   Did C.H. Spurgeon, Charles Haddon Spurgeon, the Prince of Preachers, did he ever speak
[00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:52.800]   out on Marxism?
[00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:58.480]   Did he ever speak out on Marxism?
[00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:01.040]   Thanks for making it to the end.
[00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:04.920]   I'll continue to try to make the journey worth it.
[00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:20.960]   To him, the honor, glory, and eternal dominion, James Honga.
[00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:40.480]   [Music]
[00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:43.060]   (upbeat music)
