[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320]   You said that experience is not the same as expertise in investing.
[00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:05.440]   What did you mean by that?
[00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.280]   Just because you've been in this game for a long time
[00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.200]   doesn't necessarily mean that you're an expert on something.
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.520]   Yes, experience helps because you can,
[00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.320]   if you're investing and you live through a lot of these different market cycles,
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:15.520]   you kind of pick up on some things.
[00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.480]   But I know plenty of investors who have been at this game for decades
[00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.760]   who still make the same mistakes
[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.400]   or they change their investing strategy all the time.
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.800]   It's really more about having a process that you'll stick to.
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.240]   That matters more than how many years you've been doing this.
[00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.320]   Investing is not a game where the guy with 160 IQ beats the guy with 130 IQ.
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.640]   He's like, "You can have the leftover."
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.400]   So it's more about the temperament and the ability to control your emotions
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.600]   and that emotional intelligence.
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.240]   People want to have certainty in their life
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.640]   because the future is always uncertain,
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.760]   especially when it comes to investing in the markets and the economy.
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.840]   No one really knows what's going to happen.
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.520]   I always really was attracted to the people that would say occasionally,
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.240]   "I don't know," or "I was wrong, and here's how we're going to fix it."
