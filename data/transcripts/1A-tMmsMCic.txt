[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.640]   - Billy Graham has been in the news lately.
[00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.080]   He was sick and then he became very weak.
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.120]   And at the time of this recording,
[00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.680]   he seems stronger, we're told,
[00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.800]   but of course he's 95 years old
[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.080]   and he will not be with us much longer.
[00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.920]   With his name in the news brings up questions
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.760]   about Graham's legacy in your own life, Pastor John.
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.760]   Let me ask you a few things about Billy Graham.
[00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:27.600]   We'll start here.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.160]   I've heard somewhere, thank you, Justin Taylor,
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.560]   that when you were young, when you were a kid,
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.800]   you were afraid that Billy Graham would die.
[00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.800]   It frightened you to think of the prospect.
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.460]   What was that fear about?
[00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.200]   - It was immature.
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:49.040]   It was a little faith, oh, ye of little faith,
[00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.200]   but it was real.
[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.680]   It's strange, I can remember, I think it was about 11
[00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.360]   and we had a back porch
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.720]   and my basketball goal was fastened
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:02.680]   to the top of the back porch
[00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.840]   'cause the garage was under the porch
[00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.640]   and I was standing just to the left
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.600]   of the basketball backboard facing the driveway
[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.400]   where I shot buckets.
[00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.440]   And this feeling came over me, isn't this strange?
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:15.680]   I can remember this.
[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.480]   This feeling came over me of fear
[00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.140]   that Billy Graham might die.
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.560]   So that would have been 1950,
[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:31.080]   okay, 46 plus 11, 57, give or take,
[00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.800]   somewhere around there.
[00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.000]   And it was, I think it would,
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.280]   I didn't articulate to myself what would happen,
[00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.160]   you know, what happened to the church, to the world.
[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.400]   I just had this fear that something terrible
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.440]   would happen to the church
[00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.960]   if Billy Graham wasn't there for us, you know?
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:57.320]   And I tried to figure out why did I think that?
[00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.320]   In those days, the '50s, among evangelicals,
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.680]   and I didn't know that word from Adam, you know?
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.420]   I learned that word in college.
[00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.880]   There weren't a lot of respected people
[00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.600]   who spoke for the Bible.
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.640]   So the resurgence of evangelicalism
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.640]   that happened in the late '40s under Harold John Ockengay
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.360]   and Fuller Seminary and Gordon Seminary
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.040]   and Christianity Today and Billy Graham,
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.280]   that Wheaton College,
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.240]   that constellation of central evangelicalism,
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.400]   that was a newer thing on the horizon,
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.040]   and there weren't a lot of people.
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.920]   You know, there were some famous TV personalities,
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.680]   but nobody would have thought of them as evangelical.
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.920]   And so Billy Graham just seemed to be bigger than life.
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.400]   He just represented what we believed about the Bible,
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.640]   and to lose him would have almost,
[00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.480]   to see Christianity vanish off the American cultural scene.
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.160]   I mean, it's a stupid, immature, little faith,
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.240]   and yet it gives you the sense, a little taste maybe,
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:15.320]   of what a little John Piper was learning
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.480]   about the dangers of celebrity attention.
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.800]   We ought to have heroes.
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.740]   We really should have heroes.
[00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.520]   And Billy Graham is still one of mine.
[00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:31.400]   But the danger is always there of making him too important,
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.240]   making any celebrity too important,
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.480]   more important than the cause of Christ,
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.520]   somehow thinking that poor Jesus,
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.800]   poor, risen, omnipotent, all-authority-having Jesus
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.400]   is gonna stumble if one of our heroes stumbles
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.320]   or gets taken off the scene.
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:54.680]   No one is ever indispensable to the cause of Christ.
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.600]   Only Christ is indispensable.
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.120]   And I needed to learn that,
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.720]   and I didn't feel that like I should have at age 11,
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.920]   and I feel ashamed of that,
[00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.000]   but I'm glad God was merciful to me,
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.680]   and he will be to all of us to help us grow up
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.760]   and realize he is everything,
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.840]   and all of his advocates in this world are important,
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.980]   but they are not indispensable.
[00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:21.920]   - Did you ever go to any Crusades,
[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.880]   or did you ever meet Billy Graham himself?
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.520]   - I went to the New York Crusade.
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.600]   So a lot happened when I was 11.
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.200]   (laughs)
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.480]   11 or 12, whatever it was.
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:33.880]   So yeah, the summer it would've been,
[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.880]   it went 11, the summer of 1957, we went as a family,
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.720]   and I'm pretty sure it's because my father
[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.960]   wanted to see this phenomenon up close,
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.800]   because his life was really hanging on this,
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.200]   that is his relationships with very precious friends
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:56.080]   were in the balance as this was being,
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.120]   it was in the media everywhere,
[00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.560]   and many people were criticizing Billy Graham for it,
[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.960]   and others were stunned at the work of God in it,
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.380]   and my father, I think, wanted to see it.
[00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:12.040]   So yeah, I went and saw the Crusade there.
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.280]   I was at one or two other Crusades.
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.040]   I think I was one in California when he came,
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:19.720]   when I was in seminary at the Anaheim Stadium,
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.600]   and I can't remember all of them,
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.720]   but yes, I've been to Crusades,
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.400]   and that one was very, very moving,
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.520]   and probably because so much was in the offing
[00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.440]   with regard to my father's relationships.
[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.600]   I met Billy Graham when I was 14 years old
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:39.840]   at Cliff Barrow's house.
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.740]   Maybe a little background here.
[00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:45.560]   In Greenville, South Carolina, where I grew up,
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.920]   there was the university, Bob Jones,
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:50.640]   where Billy Graham went and left,
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:55.560]   and then my dad stayed, and then later was resigned
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.320]   because of the conflict with Billy Graham,
[00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.840]   but there were a cluster of evangelists called WOES,
[00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.600]   Wives of the Evangelists,
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:08.720]   and Cliff Barrow's, the song leader for Billy Graham,
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:09.560]   lived there.
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:10.960]   I went to high school with his kids,
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:15.440]   and at his home, every now and then,
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.880]   there were these gatherings for the kids and the families,
[00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:20.240]   and Billy Graham happened to show up at one of them,
[00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.960]   and so I think I was 14 years old,
[00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:25.440]   and all I remember is the guy was tall.
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:29.560]   He was a giant, and I was little,
[00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.800]   and so I got to shake his hand,
[00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:35.120]   and I just remember being nervous
[00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.560]   in the presence of greatness, and so that was one,
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.840]   and then more recently, about a year ago,
[00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:43.600]   I was able to visit him at his home here.
[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:46.640]   I say here 'cause I'm living down south as I record this,
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:49.680]   down near Asheville, and what a privilege
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.000]   to spend, I don't know, 15, 20 minutes
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.880]   with a man who is remarkably humble
[00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:02.640]   and seems to love to give credit to others.
[00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:06.240]   He seems to very naturally speak of others
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:11.240]   rather than himself, and he speaks most endearingly
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:16.400]   of Jesus, so that was really a high point of my,
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:19.320]   if I came close to the dangers of hero worship
[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:23.000]   or celebrity admiration, it would be Billy Graham
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.080]   because he's been there as one all my life long,
[00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:30.320]   and still is even in his ill health,
[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:33.800]   so what a privilege it was to spend a few minutes with him.
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:35.080]   - Yes, what a privilege.
[00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.040]   Thank you, Pastor John, and Pastor John,
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.560]   you mentioned your father's relationships
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:40.400]   being tied up with Billy Graham,
[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:43.920]   and tomorrow I wanna talk about one Billy Graham controversy
[00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:47.400]   that impacted the history of the Piper family.
