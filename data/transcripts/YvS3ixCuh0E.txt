[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.880]   Podcast listener Sarah writes in to ask this, "Pastor John, I just got married to a
[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.000]   wonderful guy and we just celebrated our first six months of marriage."
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.080]   Congratulations Sarah. "That being said, I'm confused by 1 Corinthians 7 verses
[00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.680]   32 to 34. I understand Paul is making the point that you can live a more free life
[00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.520]   for the Lord if you're single. But he says this, 'But the married woman is
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.800]   anxious about worldly things, how to please her husband.' That language makes
[00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.160]   it seem as though pleasing your husband or wife, serving them, loving them, laying
[00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.680]   your life down for them, is pointless or a lower calling than being a missionary
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:52.040]   like Paul. Pastor John, can you help me understand this text better?" I don't know
[00:00:52.040 --> 00:01:02.240]   if I can. I will try my hardest, and I totally resonate with how difficult that
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:10.680]   sounds. Let me read a few verses to just make sure everybody's seeing what Sarah
[00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:21.280]   saw and what I see. Paul sees in 1 Corinthians 7 a fragile world liable to
[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:28.360]   come to an end soon, and he says in verse 31, "The present form of this world is
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.480]   passing away." That influences significantly how he thinks and talks
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:40.880]   here. So verse 29 goes like this, "From now on, let those who have wives live as
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.680]   though they had none. Let those who mourn as though they weren't mourning. Those
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.620]   who rejoice as though they weren't rejoicing. Those who buy as though they
[00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.640]   had no goods. Those who deal with the world as though they were not dealing
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.120]   with the world, for the present form of this world is passing away. So be married,
[00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:05.800]   mourn, rejoice, buy, deal with the world with a certain detachment because this
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:13.720]   is a fragile, short-lived world." Those are very striking, strange descriptions of
[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.860]   how to live. Live in the world as though you're not in the world. Be married as
[00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.240]   though you're not married. Cry as though you're not crying. Be happy as though
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:25.280]   you're not being happy. That's really strange, and it's just telling us
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.760]   don't sink your roots too deep here in this world, whether it's happy or
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:35.600]   whether it's sad. That's the backdrop for her verses that she's drawing our
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.640]   attention to. So here comes some instructions then about marriage in this
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:48.600]   context, and Paul commends his singleness. He loves being single for ministry, and
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:55.880]   he talks about its distinct advantages, and they're of course not all advantages.
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.120]   Every single person knows that. So here's where the difficulties come that
[00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.520]   Sarah's asking about, and I'll read the verses. Verse 26, "I think that in view of
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.920]   the present distress it is good for a person to remain as he is, married or
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.480]   single. Are you bound to a wife? Don't seek to be free. Are you free from a wife?
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:21.120]   Don't seek a wife. But if you do marry, you have not sinned." Now, pause,
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.000]   exclamation point three times. That's an amazing statement. He's going to commend
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   singleness as what he prefers and what he wishes more people would do, and then
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.960]   he says, "But marrying is not a sin." Now that's a big statement to say, because if
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.900]   you're not sinning, you're pleasing God, and if you're pleasing God, that's
[00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:45.320]   glorious, because sin is to displease the Lord. There's no neutral place here, like
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:51.560]   halfway between pleasing the Lord and marriage or something. There's
[00:03:51.560 --> 00:04:00.160]   no neutral place. If you're not sinning, you are pleasing God. So he's saying to
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:07.560]   marry is not sin. And then he adds, "Yet those who marry will have worldly
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:13.840]   troubles, literally tribulation in the flesh, and I would spare you that." So it's
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:19.960]   strange for Paul to say as a single man, because his life was so full of
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:23.160]   tribulation. Like he's saying, if you get married, you're gonna have trouble. That's
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:29.120]   all he knew was trouble. So he has some special ideas in mind here. We need
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:34.520]   to try to get to the bottom of it. He clearly does not mean singleness is free
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.480]   from tribulation. He was in prison every other week, and shipwrecked, and
[00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:44.020]   dangerous here and there. I mean, his life was just tremendously burdened, and he
[00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:49.160]   knew what it was to burn in the flesh. So he's talking about something peculiar
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:55.080]   about marriage here, which has got Sarah worked up, and me too. He says, "I want you
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:01.840]   to be free from anxieties." And clearly he means a certain kind of anxiety, because
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.280]   the very next thing he says is, "The unmarried man is anxious for the things
[00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.320]   of the Lord." Well, you just said you don't want us to be free. You want us to be
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.760]   free from anxiety, and now you sayâ€”and it's the very same word in Greek. So I
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:17.880]   want him to be anxious for the things of the Lord. So he means a particular kind
[00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:23.120]   of anxiety. He's trying to spare us. Now, here's the key phrases, the key
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.140]   words that Sarah brought up. "The unmarried man is anxious about the
[00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:32.240]   things of the Lord." How to please the Lord. "But the married man is anxious
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:37.760]   about the things of the world." How to please his wife. And he's divided. "And
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:43.640]   the unmarried or betrothed woman is anxious about the things of the Lord." And
[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:50.400]   how to be holy and embody and spirit. "But the married woman is anxious about
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:56.120]   things of the world." How to please her husband. And so Sarah said this made her
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:02.280]   her efforts to please her husband sound pointless or lower in a calling than a
[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:08.040]   missionary like Paul, and I admit it does sound like that. But I would say it
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:16.500]   sounds so bad that we know it can't be what Paul means in the way she's taking
[00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:23.360]   it. So let me try to illustrate. Two times Paul contrasts things of the Lord with
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:28.760]   the things of the world. If you're not married, you focus on the things of the
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:33.760]   Lord. If you are married, you have to think about the things of the world. And
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:39.080]   so he says for the married person in verse 34 that he or she is divided. Now
[00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:45.840]   that's a really puzzling contrast. Things of the Lord, in the single life, things of
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:50.200]   the world in the married life. That's the first one. I'm gonna come back and try to
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:54.840]   show that those are so bizarre that they can't mean what on the face of them
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:07:00.920]   they seem to mean. Here's the second one. The unmarried man aims to please the
[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:11.320]   Lord, the married man aims to please his wife. Third strange thing. Even more
[00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:17.640]   puzzling. I mean this is really jarring. The unmarried woman aims to be holy in
[00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:24.000]   body and spirit, but the married woman aims to please her husband. You say, "What?"
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:31.400]   You know, just, "What?" How can you contrast those two? Now I would say that those
[00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:37.680]   three contrasts on the face of it are so contrary to what Paul teaches elsewhere
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:42.120]   even in this letter, that we know they don't mean what they seem to mean at
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:45.120]   first. For example, I'm thinking 1st Corinthians 10 31 where he says, "Whether
[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:49.600]   you eat or drink or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God." So you're
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:55.480]   married, you're having sex, or changing the oil, or fixing the faucet, or whatever
[00:07:55.480 --> 00:08:01.040]   you're doing, do it to the glory of God and you'll be holy. So we know he can't
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:07.720]   mean that marriage is all this worldly, second-class stuff, and the real
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:12.640]   holiness and real pleasing the Lord is found outside marriage. Does he
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:18.000]   really mean in a marriage that we only deal with the things of the world and
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.640]   the things of the Lord are for single people? And of course the answer is, "No way
[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:30.440]   does Paul think that. His teachings are full of implications about how the
[00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:36.720]   children and husbands and wives treat each other as concerns of the Lord.
[00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:43.160]   Does he really want us to think that the effort to please the Lord is only
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:49.560]   possible in singleness, and in marriage all the dynamics are different? We don't
[00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:53.360]   please the Lord there, we please each other there. He can't mean that because
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:09:01.360]   he said it's not a sin to marry, and it would be a sin to marry if we didn't try
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:07.000]   to please the Lord while we were married. That's what sin means, is not pleasing
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:15.280]   the Lord. So I'm leaving behind the sphere where I please the Lord when I
[00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:20.080]   get married and now I'm just gonna please my wife. He cannot mean that. And
[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:26.080]   when he says a woman tries to be holy in body and spirit as a single woman but
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:32.360]   please her husband, as opposed to be holy, he can't mean that either, that she stops
[00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:38.600]   being holy when she gets married. So what does he mean? Like, here we are now, okay
[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:44.000]   Sarah, you're asking the right question, I'm with you. What does he mean? Here's
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:51.960]   my effort. By things of the Lord he means the ministry outside of the family of
[00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:57.980]   spreading the gospel in risky evangelism, caring for the destitute, comforting the
[00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:05.120]   hurting saints, exhorting the wayward, and many other ministry-oriented things. He
[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:12.720]   has in mind a focused, more formal, official ministry effort of evangelism
[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:18.200]   and nurture. He does not mean, when he says things of the Lord, he does not mean
[00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:23.640]   fixing the leaky faucet at home to the glory of God. He's not including that. Or
[00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:29.460]   mending the dresser where the dog chewed off the edge of it, or getting home for
[00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:35.360]   dinner when you promised. These are all things that he would know can be done to
[00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:40.040]   the glory of God, but he's not including them in the things of the Lord. Those are
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:44.840]   the things of the world in his vocabulary. Not evil, not evil, just not
[00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:50.640]   what he means by things of the Lord. When he contrasts pleasing the spouse with
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:58.720]   pleasing the Lord, I think he means there is a life of simpler pursuit of how to
[00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:04.600]   minister to the lost and the hurting that does not have to be complicated
[00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:10.240]   with the demands of family. Of course, you can please the Lord by playing with
[00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:15.520]   your children, or fixing that faucet, or mending that dresser, but Paul is saying
[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:22.760]   simply, the unmarried can be more focused on all the demands of ministry without
[00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:29.160]   the complicating demands of family. And that's true, I felt it so much during my
[00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:35.840]   pastoral days. What if I am in a heavy counseling session, and I promised to be
[00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:41.760]   home for supper at 530? This happened regularly. What if I am--and now what?
[00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:46.520]   I've got to--I want to please my wife, and I'm in the midst of this thing of
[00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:52.960]   the Lord. What do I do? What if I'm playing with my kids at night, and an
[00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:56.680]   emergency phone call comes, and somebody's terribly desperate, either
[00:11:56.680 --> 00:12:01.000]   suicidal, or somebody's been rushed to the hospital? I've got a conflict there
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.760]   that I wouldn't have if I didn't have to be concerned with my kids that night.
[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:10.960]   What if a late-night crisis has made me so exhausted, I don't have any energy for
[00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:16.600]   the job I promised to do the next morning, and Paul would like us to be
[00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:23.960]   spared the complexity, the dividedness, if we are single and we can just flat-out
[00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:29.200]   serve all those ministerial things? He's contrasting things of the Lord with a
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:36.120]   ministry life with what happens if it's complicated by the demands of the family.
[00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:42.200]   And when he says that a woman aims at holiness in body and mind as single, but
[00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:48.680]   tries to please the husband when married, I think he means she loses the
[00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:56.320]   simplicity of devoting more time to the Word and prayer, and must fit those
[00:12:56.320 --> 00:13:04.120]   things in to a much more demanding life. In other words, there can be a more
[00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:12.560]   focused sense of pursuing the strategies, the disciplines of holiness, and I've
[00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:17.460]   talked with many married women, "How do you find time with all these kids to
[00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:24.420]   read the Word and to pray?" And she just aches for more spiritual time alone with
[00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:30.720]   God. But here's where we end up. Paul is recruiting radical devotion to the Lord
[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:35.160]   that is uncomplicated by the practical demands of marriage. This is no
[00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:41.200]   getting around it. Paul wants a lot of people to be single because of the
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:46.560]   nature of the demands of ministry and the press of the time. And when he
[00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:52.320]   steps back and hears a question like Sarah's, "Hey, what about those of us who
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:58.320]   believe God is calling us to marriage?" And in marriage, Paul has a glorious
[00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:04.200]   answer, glorious truths to tell about the meaning and the ministry of marriage. But
[00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:09.440]   that's not here in 1 Corinthians 7, except you don't sin. You got to go to
[00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:16.540]   Ephesians 5 for that, and when you go there, it is glorious. Amen, it is
[00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:20.360]   glorious. Thank you, Pastor John, for that comprehensive response, and thank you,
[00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:24.480]   Sarah, for the exceptional question. We need your exceptional questions, and you
[00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:30.000]   can send them to us via email at AskPastorJohn@DesiringGod.org. Well,
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.360]   there is a fear that haunts humanity, and it's the fear of death. This fear is
[00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:40.200]   universally enslaving, and it's also a fear that Jesus Christ came to conquer
[00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:45.040]   and defeat on behalf of sinners like you and me. Tomorrow, Pastor John will explain
[00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:49.480]   how. I'm your host, Tony Reinke. I'll see you tomorrow.
