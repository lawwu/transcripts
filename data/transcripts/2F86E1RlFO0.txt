[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.840]   No pastor lives up to what he preaches. If he does, he's preaching too low. You
[00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.760]   wrote that on Twitter a few years back, Pastor John. How does a pastor think
[00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.280]   through this? Talk to the pastor who is preaching high and feels overwhelmed and
[00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.000]   burdened because of it. Is this a healthy tension for him to feel?
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.280]   Well I sure don't want to solve the problem of the gap between the heights of
[00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:37.640]   our message and the depths of our failure by lowering heights. I'm not
[00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.360]   going to solve the problem that way. We are called to preach the Word, 2nd
[00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.200]   Timothy 2.4. Preach the whole counsel of God. Preach the glory of God as
[00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:55.320]   the goal of all things. And so preach a great salvation and the unsearchable
[00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:02.520]   riches of Christ and the pathway to pleasures forevermore and rejoicing
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:11.840]   always. And the aim of our charge is love from a pure heart. And we have peace. And
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.240]   don't be anxious for anything. And don't grumble. And love your wives like Christ
[00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.520]   loved the church. And love your enemies. And be perfect for I am perfect. It's
[00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:27.600]   overwhelming, right? That's the message. I mean the message is as high as it can
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.120]   possibly be with a focus on God and the gospel and our salvation, our eternal
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:41.280]   hope and the glories of knowing Jesus and all the radical ethical call that
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:48.520]   Jesus gives us. And so the effect that has if we're faithfully lifting this up,
[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:54.640]   we're not going to be like the lawyers in the Gospel of Luke. I think it's
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.720]   chapter 11 where Jesus says, "You load men with burdens hard to bear and
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:06.120]   you don't lift a finger to help them." So that's not what I'm calling for. Like
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:11.560]   dump the burden of "be perfect" on your people then go home and watch basketball
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:18.960]   games. That's not going to be helpful. We are preaching the gospel. And at this
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:24.400]   point in this question I think we're modeling the gospel. That is, we are
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:30.360]   praying like crazy that God would have mercy upon us sinful pastors and work
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:37.080]   work these things into us. We are putting them to death by the power of the Spirit.
[00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:43.800]   Romans 8 13, we're pummeling our bodies lest we be a castaway and be found
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:51.520]   unworthy. 1st Corinthians 9, we're striving to enter by the narrow gate and
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:59.120]   we're doing all that by trusting the gospel. And we are therefore ever
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:08.720]   repenting. Now right here may be the key thing to say. I've had, last Sunday, I'm
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.960]   almost done here at Bethlehem as we make this recording as the pastor and a man
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.200]   man come up to me last Sunday and he said, "Pastor, you know what's what's been
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.880]   especially meaningful to me in your ministry is how vulnerable you've been
[00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:27.320]   in the pulpit. How vulnerable you've been with your own sins and your own marriage
[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:31.400]   and your own parenting and your own sense of failure about things." He said,
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.440]   "I just want you to know how encouraging that's been." So I would say to pastors,
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:42.600]   don't be afraid every time you preach on something to draw attention to the fact
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:49.000]   that you don't get it right usually. You don't measure up to it. Model for
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:56.360]   your people how to constantly confess your sins to the people that you love
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:06.000]   and aim high, fall short, hold tight to Jesus. Those are my three, that's the way
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.200]   I'd kind of sum it up. Go ahead and aim high in your preachings knowing that in
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.880]   this age while sin indwells you're going to fall short and teach the people
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:25.320]   what gutsy guilt is. That is, we go ahead and we assert the truth and we get in
[00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:30.000]   the devil's face and we say we're not going to let go of Jesus because he is
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   our vindication, he is our righteousness, not our pastoral accomplishments and not
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.800]   our husbanding and our parenting, but Christ is our all. And then if you model
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.280]   that for your people, I think it both rescues you from despair as you preach
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:49.840]   high, but it shows them how to stretch and go for broke without being
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.240]   undone by their failures. Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for listening
