[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.300]   - Pastor John, here's a question we get
[00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.120]   with some regularity now from people
[00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.260]   who have no idea what we're talking about.
[00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.460]   Give us a simple definition or description
[00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.220]   of Reformed Theology or this thing we call Calvinism.
[00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:17.940]   What are we talking about when we use
[00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.180]   those terms on this podcast?
[00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.580]   - Here's what I ordinarily mean
[00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.220]   when I use the term Reformed Theology or Calvinism,
[00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.720]   and please, our listeners should understand
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.720]   that others may want to give a lot fuller
[00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.340]   or more precise meaning.
[00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.840]   So don't be surprised if you hear someone say,
[00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.980]   "Piper's definition is way too narrow."
[00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.780]   They're right in one sense.
[00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.060]   Historically, Reformed Theology would include
[00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.820]   everything you read in a big systematic theology
[00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.120]   written by a Reformed theologian.
[00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.580]   So that's Reformed Theology,
[00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.740]   which is why certain Reformed folks get all uptight
[00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.020]   if you just give it a little teeny definition.
[00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.820]   So I totally am okay with that and affirm that,
[00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.980]   but I think what people wanna know and what I mean
[00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.840]   is what are some of the distinctives
[00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.700]   that you're talking about when you use this phrase?
[00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.720]   And so here's what I mean.
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.180]   Reformed Theology, as I mean it,
[00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.180]   is a view of God and His way of working
[00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.740]   in the world that grows like a tree
[00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.980]   with lots of branches out of a deep conviction
[00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:40.980]   that God's glory is the goal of all things
[00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:44.460]   and His freedom and His sovereignty
[00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.260]   are essential to His deity,
[00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.860]   and because He's free and sovereign and glorious,
[00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.620]   He doesn't need to be served by anyone
[00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.340]   to meet His needs, and therefore He is gloriously free
[00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.180]   to be gracious to us.
[00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.180]   That's it in a nutshell.
[00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.060]   So let me just take those one at a time
[00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.780]   and put texts underneath them.
[00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.580]   The glory of God is supreme,
[00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:18.300]   the supreme theme of Reformed Theology.
[00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.300]   So Isaiah 48, "For my name's sake I defer my anger,
[00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.060]   "for the sake of my praise," God says,
[00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.540]   "I restrain it for you, that I may not cut you off.
[00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.040]   "Behold, I have refined you, but not as silver.
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.420]   "I have tried you in the furnace of affliction.
[00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.420]   "For my own sake, for my own sake I do it.
[00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.580]   "How should my name be profaned?
[00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.580]   "My glory I will not give to another."
[00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.280]   I don't think there's a more God-exalting verse
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.540]   in the Bible than Isaiah 48, 9 to 11.
[00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.580]   So the glory of God from creation to consummation
[00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.220]   is the supreme value that God has in the world,
[00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.260]   and He's pursuing it in all that He does.
[00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.700]   "Bring my sons from afar,
[00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.240]   "my daughters from the ends of the earth,
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.740]   "everyone who's called by my name,
[00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:13.740]   "whom I created for my glory," God says in Isaiah 43, 7.
[00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:20.100]   And in doing this, in pursuing His glory
[00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.240]   in all that He does, which is the theme
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.820]   at the center of Reformed theology,
[00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:29.260]   He is totally free and sovereign.
[00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:35.260]   That is, He's not decisively constrained or controlled
[00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.800]   by any force from outside Himself.
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.780]   He can overcome every obstacle to His purposes
[00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.820]   and do everything He pleases.
[00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.940]   So here's a text or two on His freedom.
[00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.000]   Psalm 115, 3, "Our God is in the heavens.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.280]   "He does whatever He pleases," totally free.
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.000]   Or Romans 9, 15, "I have mercy on whom I have mercy.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   "I have compassion on whom I have compassion."
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.180]   A statement like that is designed
[00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.320]   to help us embrace the freedom of God.
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.800]   He does what He pleases,
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.460]   and He does it with absolute sovereignty.
[00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:21.000]   And what I mean by that is Isaiah 46, 9,
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.440]   "I am God, there is no other.
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.600]   "I am God, there is none like me,
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.340]   "declaring the end from the beginning,
[00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.340]   "and from ancient times things not yet done,
[00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.640]   "saying," and here it comes,
[00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.480]   "My counsel shall stand,
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:39.480]   "and I will accomplish all my purpose," says the Lord.
[00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.160]   So nothing can stop Him.
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.240]   He is sovereign.
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.360]   Anything that looks like an obstacle in the way,
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.740]   if He lets it remain an obstacle,
[00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.080]   He's just permitting it.
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.560]   He could go over it any time He wanted,
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.520]   and therefore He's sovereign over it.
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.280]   So He has no needs,
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:03.280]   and therefore overflows in free grace to whom He pleases.
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.160]   Acts 17, "God is not served by human hands
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.860]   "as though He needed anything.
[00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.200]   "He Himself gives and gives and gives
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.560]   "to all mankind, life and breath and everything."
[00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.660]   God is a bountiful God
[00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.200]   because He's not a needy God,
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.960]   and He's not a needy God
[00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.600]   because He's infinitely glorious and free and sovereign.
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.800]   So those are the roots of God's action
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.140]   in creation and history,
[00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:34.980]   which means that when it comes to saving sinners,
[00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.200]   and here's where we get down to the nitty gritty,
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.820]   just briefly,
[00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:41.300]   when it comes to saving sinners,
[00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.600]   God is free and sovereign in the way He does it.
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:46.520]   We are dead.
[00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:51.520]   John Piper was dead in my trespasses and my sins.
[00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.880]   I was unable to change my life.
[00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:57.660]   I did not love God.
[00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:59.060]   I did not trust God.
[00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:00.380]   I did not want God.
[00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:02.860]   I found God boring,
[00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:07.860]   and therefore I was enslaved to my own sin.
[00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:09.620]   God was not beautiful,
[00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:11.180]   and He wasn't satisfying,
[00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.100]   and that's the condition of everybody
[00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:17.200]   until God moves.
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.700]   And so Reformed theology says
[00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:22.960]   the only solution to this hopeless condition
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.760]   that I was in and everybody's in
[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.680]   is that God is sovereign,
[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:31.280]   and by His free grace,
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:34.800]   overcomes our blindness.
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.680]   He raises us from the dead.
[00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:39.320]   He gives us eyes to see the beauty of Christ
[00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:42.900]   so that we freely and joyfully embrace Him
[00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:45.080]   as our supreme treasure.
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:49.200]   For example, 2 Corinthians 4, 6,
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:50.480]   the God who said,
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.300]   "Let light shine out of darkness,"
[00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:53.880]   way back there in creation,
[00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:56.700]   "has shone in our hearts
[00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:58.080]   "to give the light of the knowledge
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:59.840]   "of the glory of God in the face of Christ."
[00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:01.480]   That's how I got saved.
[00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:02.820]   My heart was dark.
[00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:03.980]   It was dead.
[00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:05.840]   It was rebellious.
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:08.540]   It had all the wrong preferences,
[00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:13.540]   and God said, "Let there be gospel light
[00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:16.400]   "in John Piper's heart,"
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:19.320]   and by miracle, in a moment,
[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:21.560]   I saw Christ differently.
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:26.560]   He was compellingly true and beautiful and satisfying,
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:28.620]   and I was saved.
[00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:32.180]   The Bible calls me now a new creation
[00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:34.960]   so that Ephesians 2, 8, and 9 are true.
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:37.560]   By grace, you have been saved.
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:40.360]   Through faith, this is not your own doing.
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.200]   It's a gift of God,
[00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:45.920]   not a result of works or anything we did,
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:47.880]   so faith is a gift.
[00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:50.360]   We don't create it with our free will.
[00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:52.640]   Now, here's where it gets controversial,
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:54.980]   and I'm just gonna close with this statement.
[00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:56.520]   We don't create it.
[00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:59.680]   We don't create faith with our free will.
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:02.460]   If left to our free will,
[00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:06.120]   we will all choose the pleasures of the creation
[00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:08.200]   over the beauty of the Creator.
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:11.700]   Our free will is a slave to sin.
[00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:14.040]   Just read Romans 6,
[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:16.760]   and you'll see that we were enslaved to sin,
[00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:19.620]   enslaved on righteousness.
[00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:23.880]   Only the sovereign grace of God can set us free
[00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:27.440]   so that we see Christ for who He really is
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:29.840]   and embrace Him as our supreme treasure.
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:34.140]   That's what I mean by Reformed theology.
[00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:34.980]   - Excellent.
[00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:35.800]   Thank you for the introduction,
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:36.640]   Pastor John,
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:38.240]   and if you'd like more about Reformed theology,
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:40.040]   see two podcast episodes,
[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:41.400]   episode number 117,
[00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:43.960]   The Joy of Calvinism and the Fight for Joy,
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:46.200]   and see also episode 237,
[00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:48.440]   Where Did All These Calvinists Come From?
[00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:50.640]   And if you want a written introduction to Calvinism
[00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:53.360]   with biblical proofs for you to see and study for yourself,
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.000]   see Pastor John's new book,
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.960]   "Five Points Towards a Deeper Experience of God's Grace."
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:00.780]   The book can be downloaded in its entirety,
[00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:03.440]   free of charge from our website, DesiringGod.org.
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:04.580]   Click on Books at the top,
[00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:07.440]   and then look for the title, "Five Points."
[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:09.280]   While you're at the website, look around.
[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:12.040]   We have thousands of books, articles, blog posts, sermons,
[00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:13.480]   and other resources from John Piper
[00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:15.720]   and all free of charge for you to enjoy.
[00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:17.200]   And they're all intended to explain
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:18.680]   why God is most glorified in us
[00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:21.720]   when we are most satisfied in Him.
[00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:24.080]   Well, spring is here, the sun is out,
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:25.680]   and tomorrow we'll be back to talk
