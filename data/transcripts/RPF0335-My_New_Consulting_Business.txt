[00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.880]   phone but I'm also going to share with you how you can take what I'm doing and use it
[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:54.360]   as possibly a good source of part time income for yourself.
[00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.660]   Hope this content is very useful because some of you could leverage this to make a good
[00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:17.600]   little extra bit of money.
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.560]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.600]   My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host, your fellow voyager on the road to financial
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.600]   freedom.
[00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.820]   I'm here with you to talk about how to live a rich life now while also building a plan
[00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.460]   for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.980]   Today's little idea is partly about me.
[00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:49.620]   Yes, I'm advertising my new business but it's also very useful to you.
[00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.700]   I really think that some of you listening to this show will be able to take what I'm
[00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.340]   talking about in today's show and what I'm doing and what I am testing out and possibly
[00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.540]   use it to make yourself a little bit of extra money.
[00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.580]   So I'm going to share that with you.
[00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:08.060]   So quick up front, basically what I'm offering is I'm offering paid phone consulting in the
[00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.060]   future.
[00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.500]   But before I get into the details of that and that will be open to anybody, any of you
[00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.100]   who have ever asked me or been interested in that, I've gotten many emails.
[00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.620]   I believe this will be a service to many of you.
[00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.900]   I've already spoken and done some consulting calls.
[00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.300]   In fact, just immediately before hanging up the phone – immediately before – you notice
[00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.420]   we don't hang up phones anymore but we still use the terminology.
[00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.760]   Immediately before hitting record and starting the show, I just finished up another consulting
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.220]   call with a listener of the show and so far, they have been really, really good.
[00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.100]   So I'm very excited about offering this to you.
[00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.100]   But I'll get to those details in a minute.
[00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.580]   But I want to give you a little bit of the back story.
[00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:52.580]   Many of you have asked me for personal advice, personal financial consulting and I have up
[00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.620]   till now always said no.
[00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:01.980]   I'd like to explain why and what's different now and how – again, how some of you can
[00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.260]   model and copy what I am doing.
[00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:13.580]   When I originally started Radical Personal Finance, my intention was to build the podcast
[00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:18.660]   and also to build a new financial planning firm.
[00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:26.620]   My thought was at that time, the best business use of a podcast is as a component of marketing
[00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.180]   for a business – a larger business.
[00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.340]   So for example, I think the best business use of a personal finance podcast is as a
[00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.860]   component of the marketing efforts for a financial advisor.
[00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.700]   At the beginning, that was my intention.
[00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:50.340]   I thought that it was possible to build an income from a podcast in some way or another
[00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.620]   but I wasn't sure that that was necessarily the best move.
[00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:59.420]   I thought that it would be better to use a podcast as a marketing component of an overall
[00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.140]   business and I still believe that.
[00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.060]   Now as I started to get into the course of the show and at the very beginning, I didn't
[00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:11.420]   talk much about it at the beginning because I was filing paperwork behind the scenes and
[00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.420]   I was putting in my form ADV and all that stuff with the state to get registered as
[00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.900]   a registered investment advisory firm.
[00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.620]   We talked a little bit about that in yesterday's episode.
[00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.420]   But I was doing that process behind the scenes.
[00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:29.300]   But I started to look at how much time and energy I was investing into the show and I
[00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.380]   started to look at how much time and energy would be required for financial planning to
[00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:38.580]   do financial planning well and I started to get concerned because I ran through it and
[00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.260]   I said, "Well, I'm putting all this effort into Radical Personal Finance.
[00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.580]   I'm putting 50 hours a week, 60 hours a week into this.
[00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.740]   Should I really overhear – how on earth am I going to fit this into the time that
[00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.340]   I have in a week?"
[00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:54.660]   And when I then looked at creating the financial planning firm and you go through all of the
[00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.580]   requirements for that, the registration with the state, all of the software that you need
[00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:03.700]   to get to be able to deliver the traditional financial planning deliverables and formats
[00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:10.900]   and things like that, it's a daunting amount of work and it's also a daunting amount
[00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:15.780]   of money to get everything set up, to get the software subscriptions and get your Morningstar
[00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.100]   and your financial planning software, etc.
[00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:23.500]   It's also a daunting amount of work to simply stay current on all of those things.
[00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:27.820]   And the actual client engagement process, a good engagement with a good financial planner,
[00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:29.820]   I mean it's many, many hours.
[00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:31.100]   And I looked at the money involved.
[00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:34.060]   I looked at the rates I was intending to charge.
[00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.060]   I looked at all the different options.
[00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:41.180]   And ultimately I came to the decision that I could either be a great financial planner
[00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:44.420]   or I could be a great financial broadcaster.
[00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:47.940]   And I looked around and I said, "I know a lot of really good financial planners who
[00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:53.100]   are very good, who don't have the skill of broadcasting, and I know very few great
[00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:54.900]   financial broadcasters."
[00:05:54.900 --> 00:06:03.140]   So I decided that my skill set was best used in the direction of broadcasting.
[00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:05.940]   And so I made the decision to close the firm.
[00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:07.060]   I pulled the paperwork.
[00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:09.060]   It never was approved by the state.
[00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:16.700]   I went ahead and pulled it out of application, shut down the LLC and just collapsed the business.
[00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:20.020]   And I decided to focus and go all in on radical personal finance.
[00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:24.700]   But still along the way, I had wanted to be able to work with individual people.
[00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:27.060]   But the context was difficult.
[00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:34.000]   I couldn't hold myself out as a financial planner, nor could I give advice on specifics
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   of securities without being registered with the state.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.540]   Then when I looked at the actual deliverables and things like that, things that would be
[00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:44.140]   needed to create a good financial planner, I still had all the problems with the time,
[00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:45.540]   the data collection, et cetera.
[00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:49.580]   And you need to do, if you're going to practice on that level, you need to do a good job.
[00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.260]   If somebody comes to me and says, "Joshua, can I afford to retire?
[00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:53.580]   Do I have enough money?"
[00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:55.020]   I need good data.
[00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:56.140]   I need all the statements.
[00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:57.140]   I need everything.
[00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:00.220]   I need to run all of the analyses and all the projections.
[00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:02.200]   You need the tools of the trade.
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:06.060]   And I was so engrossed with creating the show, I didn't have the opportunity to really perfect
[00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:09.620]   those tools of the trade, nor did I have the time to do it.
[00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:14.300]   So I've consistently for the last two years said no to anybody who's inquired for personal
[00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:18.300]   consultations.
[00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:22.060]   Now a few people have begged and pleaded and slipped and squeaked in under the radar where
[00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:26.760]   I did just an hourly engagement where they asked me for advice and I sat down with them
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:33.520]   and they paid me an hourly fee for it, not giving advice on whether they should buy or
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:38.240]   sell a certain stock, just simply staying in the realm of general advice so that I didn't
[00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:42.960]   – since I lapsed all of my licenses, I need to stay clear of giving specific financial
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:47.360]   advice on any kind of buy or sell decisions, things like that.
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:50.600]   But along the way, I've wanted to create something different, but I had to figure out
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:52.320]   how do I actually do it.
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:53.640]   Well, I didn't know.
[00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.920]   I did know that I didn't want to have to do software.
[00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:57.640]   I didn't want to have to deliver a financial plan.
[00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:00.920]   I didn't want to have to deliver some of those things, but that I did want to figure
[00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:02.240]   out how to do consulting.
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:08.680]   A few months ago, I came across a website called Clarity.fm and I looked at it.
[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:11.380]   I said, "This could work," and I just laid it aside.
[00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:14.200]   But last week, I was sitting there thinking and I said, "Wait a second.
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:15.480]   This is perfect."
[00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:22.120]   So Clarity.fm is a new website, a new company, and what they do is they offer phone consultations
[00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:23.320]   with experts.
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:25.120]   But the way they do it is important.
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:30.520]   They allow people to sign up as an expert and establish a profile and they allow people
[00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:33.280]   to sign up and to work with that expert.
[00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:36.800]   So I'm the expert in this case and the reason I'm going through this in detail is because
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:41.160]   I want some of you to consider using this as an extra income source for you.
[00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:44.680]   But I sign up as the expert and I establish my profile.
[00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:49.320]   I establish an hourly rate and I establish all of the details there, telling people who
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:50.400]   I am.
[00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:54.940]   And then if you're interested in speaking to me, the way it works is simple.
[00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:58.860]   You go through to the website and you set up an account.
[00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:04.440]   So you put in your name and a username and a password and things like that.
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.400]   Then you search and find an expert.
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:09.800]   You put in a credit card, credit card information when you establish the account.
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.480]   You search and find the expert.
[00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:14.820]   In this case, it'll be me or there's other people on there too.
[00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:18.320]   But you search and find the expert and I'll link you through directly to my profile to
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:19.760]   make that easy.
[00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:22.560]   And you schedule a call with the expert.
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:26.200]   Now, there's a scheduling function where you choose a few times.
[00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:28.940]   I choose a few times and we get the call scheduled.
[00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:35.040]   And then at the time that the call is scheduled, you estimate how long you anticipate wanting
[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:36.180]   to speak to the expert.
[00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:39.200]   So if that's 30 minutes or an hour, et cetera.
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:43.640]   At the time that you book the call and at the time, excuse me, that the call is confirmed,
[00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:50.480]   your credit card is charged for the actual amount of – excuse me, the time that you
[00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:51.480]   estimate.
[00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:55.760]   So a 30-minute call and the expert's rate is $300 an hour.
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:58.780]   It's $150 that's charged to your card.
[00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:05.040]   You get access to a special customized phone line and a special customized PIN.
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:10.360]   The expert gets one number and a PIN and you, the caller, gets another number and a PIN.
[00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:12.400]   And they're different numbers and PINs.
[00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:16.920]   Then at the appointed time, each of us calls in to the phone line.
[00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:21.280]   We get connected for the conference call and the system, the software, keeps track of how
[00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:23.260]   much time we're on the call.
[00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:28.040]   So if you anticipated a 30-minute call and we actually talk for 15 minutes, then you
[00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:29.040]   hang up.
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:34.680]   Then the call is terminated and you are refunded the balance of the call.
[00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:38.800]   So in the case if it's $300 an hour, you get refunded $75.
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:44.380]   On the flip side, if you wind up talking for 60 minutes or for 45 minutes or however long,
[00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:47.480]   your credit card is billed for the additional amount.
[00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:53.640]   And the thing I love about this system is it's simple, it's clear, and it solves some
[00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:54.640]   of the major problems.
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:58.960]   You see, many of the people that pay that bill on an hourly rate, and when I've done
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:04.520]   this on an hourly rate in the past, it's very difficult to know how to do this exactly right.
[00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:10.440]   First, you often have the challenge of people not wanting to pay for an hourly rate and
[00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:12.920]   not wanting to know how to control the situation.
[00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:18.800]   Well, the cool thing about having it done through a phone line is simply that if you're
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:23.360]   not finding value in the expert's responses and you just want to hang up, you just end
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:24.360]   the call.
[00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:27.880]   And because you have full control over your end or I have full control over my end, the
[00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:31.120]   call is ended, the time is done.
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:34.800]   The billing immediately stops because you have a disinterested third party, which is
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.040]   very nice.
[00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:39.080]   The other thing that's important is getting the time accurate.
[00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:42.840]   If any of you have ever sold your time, one of the challenges as a service provider is
[00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:46.720]   you want to give your client the best amount of value possible.
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:49.640]   There's always a little bit of small talk.
[00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:52.200]   There's always a little bit of question.
[00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:59.240]   Usually most of us who have provided services on an hourly basis, we usually try to round
[00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:01.040]   a little bit in favor of the client.
[00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:04.520]   "Hey, you were in my office for an hour and 45 minutes, but I'll bill you for an
[00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:09.800]   hour and a half, and that way you'll have some better systems."
[00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:14.440]   Many times when clients are paying on an hourly basis, they get a little bit frustrated like,
[00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:15.440]   "Wait a second.
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:16.600]   That wasn't exactly what it was.
[00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:18.120]   That wasn't the exact amount of time."
[00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:21.160]   And so usually to cover yourself as a service provider, you round down.
[00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:26.120]   Well, the cool thing about an extra external system is there's no question.
[00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:27.120]   There's no guessing.
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:29.560]   You're just being billed for the time that you speak.
[00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:33.680]   And so I think this is a truly great opportunity.
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:37.480]   Now I don't know if there are other companies that have done this in the past, but I love
[00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:41.640]   what Clarity is setting up, and I like the system.
[00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:43.160]   And the system is very convenient.
[00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:45.280]   It does a good job with scheduling.
[00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:46.980]   It does a good job with reminders.
[00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:49.240]   You get a text message five minutes before the call.
[00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:50.240]   You click the phone number.
[00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:53.880]   The PIN code is already entered in, so when your smartphone just goes through automatically,
[00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:55.200]   it's fantastic.
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:59.360]   And I love this because what it's going to enable me to do and has already with the three
[00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:06.480]   or four I've done so far – three I've done – it enables me to just simply give specific
[00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:11.360]   advice on whatever you want to talk about without necessarily committing to any of the
[00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:13.780]   follow-up systems.
[00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:15.440]   So I've done this.
[00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:22.900]   I put out the notice among some of the patrons of the show in our Facebook group and I put
[00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:26.980]   out the notice and I've so far had three calls.
[00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:29.600]   And they have been awesome.
[00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:32.440]   The reviews even from the callers – that's the other great thing is that callers can
[00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:34.180]   leave reviews on the profile.
[00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:35.700]   Those reviews are public.
[00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:38.280]   Anybody can come and see how many calls have been made.
[00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:41.500]   Anybody can come and read the reviews, so there's a good feedback mechanism.
[00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:44.400]   So if as an expert you're not doing a good job for a customer, you're wasting their
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:48.080]   time or something like that, the customer can leave that information right there in
[00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:49.080]   the review.
[00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:53.600]   So it's good transparency and accountability, which is fantastic.
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.320]   I've done three calls so far.
[00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:59.960]   In every one of them, I've come away feeling like this is great.
[00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:04.420]   One call was about general life plan – one call is about general life planning.
[00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:06.960]   One call was about business and one call was about podcasting.
[00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:08.980]   Somebody wanted my podcasting advice.
[00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:14.440]   And this is – it's been fantastic because I really came away from it feeling like the
[00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:19.180]   – there was huge value there for the participant.
[00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:23.320]   There was huge value there where I was able to help clarify some things for them.
[00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:27.200]   Many have expressed that you love to listen to the Q&A shows but you just don't want
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:29.600]   to have your personal information made public.
[00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:32.160]   There's personal details that are often important.
[00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:37.000]   So you'll notice even on Q&A shows, I often will make the shows just a little bit vague.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.600]   I won't ask you for a specific on a situation just to help you keep some of your personal
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:42.600]   privacy.
[00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:46.800]   Well, in the context where it's just you and me, we can talk personally.
[00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:50.240]   And so it's really, really a high-quality system.
[00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:54.800]   I've been very impressed with it and have thoroughly enjoyed it.
[00:14:54.800 --> 00:15:01.360]   What I love about it is for me as an expert, it allows me to be compensated for work that
[00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:03.280]   I enjoy doing and it's important to me.
[00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:04.280]   I want to do it.
[00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:09.080]   I don't like to always be just putting information out there without getting the feedback.
[00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:15.440]   Working with real people helps me to stay sharp, helps me to make sure that I'm relevant.
[00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:21.480]   So it allows me to have a really great system to connect and help people without having
[00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:23.240]   all of the other encumbrances.
[00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:26.760]   I don't have to come up, which was one of my plans, with, "Well, I'll have multiple
[00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:31.760]   coaching packages and you'll have a coaching package of four sessions and six sessions
[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:33.480]   and eight sessions," or anything like that.
[00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:34.840]   In this situation, I don't have to do that.
[00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:37.600]   If you want to talk to me again, you just book a call and we talk.
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:40.680]   And if you don't want to talk to me again, you just don't book a call.
[00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:42.520]   There are no commitments.
[00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:43.520]   There's no ongoing plans.
[00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:44.800]   There's no anything.
[00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:48.720]   And I love the pressure that puts on me where if I want another call with you, I've got
[00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:49.720]   to deliver.
[00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:51.480]   So I think it's a really great system.
[00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:58.320]   So in short, if you would like to speak to me and get my advice or input on literally
[00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:01.080]   anything, I'll talk to you about anything except...
[00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:03.160]   Excuse me, I need to put a caveat.
[00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:09.760]   Except I cannot give you specific advice on the purchase or sale of securities and I cannot
[00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:17.240]   give you specific advice on the purchase or sale of a specific insurance contract.
[00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:22.920]   If I do those things, that would cross over the line of things that in the United States
[00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:25.280]   you're required by law to be licensed over.
[00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:27.000]   We can speak generally about those subjects.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.720]   I can educate you on those subjects.
[00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:32.200]   I can give you information that you need to know, but I don't sell any products and I
[00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:36.320]   can't advise you to sell a stock, anything like that.
[00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:38.960]   So if you ever ask me a question like that, just don't bother to call because I won't
[00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:39.960]   answer it.
[00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:42.240]   I'll turn it around and say, "I'm sorry, I can't give you a response on that."
[00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:44.760]   It's important because I'm not licensed anymore.
[00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:46.920]   But beyond that, you could talk to me about anything you want.
[00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:50.600]   So we could talk about business, we could talk about podcasts, we could talk about marketing,
[00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:54.680]   we could talk about anything that you want, financial planning.
[00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:59.400]   I even suggest some of you might be well-served by putting me in your back pocket and taking
[00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:02.840]   me to a financial planning appointment or to meet with your attorney.
[00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:03.840]   I'm willing to do that.
[00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:07.320]   I've wanted to be able to do things like that, but if you want to take a phone and you want
[00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:13.920]   to have a second opinion or for me to get on a conference call with you and your team,
[00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:18.520]   something like that, to say, "Hey, are you getting good advice?"
[00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:23.480]   You can have a perfectly unbiased financial advisor with no commitments, no strings, no
[00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:24.480]   anything.
[00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:28.000]   It's just me on the other end of the line and you're just going to simply pay me for
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.640]   every minute that the call is connected and when the call is disconnected, it's done.
[00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:34.000]   So I'm pretty excited about it.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   I think it'll fit.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.760]   It'll allow me to do something I've wanted to do for a long time but never found the
[00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:44.200]   technology to be able to do it so I could actually do it while still doing everything
[00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:45.200]   else that I'm doing.
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:52.840]   So if you'd like to book a call with me, go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/phonecall.
[00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:57.040]   And at the moment, I've got that link set up so it will pass you through to the Clarity
[00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:59.400]   profile and you can just book directly there.
[00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:00.840]   I'd love to talk with some of you.
[00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:07.560]   I encourage also some of you to consider this as a side income for yourselves.
[00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:12.960]   I consider some of you who are experts, who get people asking you questions, to use this
[00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:17.800]   as a polite way of getting paid for your advice.
[00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:22.240]   In general, I think we should make a practice and habit of giving away very little advice
[00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:23.600]   for free.
[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:28.360]   When you give away free advice, usually the people don't take it and they don't do anything
[00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:29.360]   with it.
[00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:33.600]   So if you're an expert in something, consider very seriously simply not giving advice away
[00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:35.120]   for free.
[00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:40.600]   If you would like to have an easy way to do that, this website could be a good system
[00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:41.600]   for you to do it.
[00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:42.920]   Go ahead and set up your own profile.
[00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:47.240]   You can actually set up – you'll set up a profile with your name and you can transfer
[00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:53.360]   yourself from individual like listener with someone with a question to an expert just
[00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:54.360]   with a click of the button.
[00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:57.200]   Now you have to be approved as an expert so they're just going to check you out and
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:58.560]   make sure that you actually have credentials.
[00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:01.400]   But you can be an expert in just about any area.
[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:03.320]   That's up to you.
[00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:07.120]   But if some of you spend a lot of time answering people's questions, writing long emails,
[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:11.360]   things like that, well, consider using this as a cutout, a way to see if somebody who's
[00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:14.600]   asking you a question is really serious about your advice.
[00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:18.560]   Send them a link and say, "Book a call with me here," and they'll see your hourly
[00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:19.560]   rate.
[00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:21.200]   They'll pay and they'll book a call with you.
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:25.480]   This can be very, very useful in many types of businesses.
[00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:28.420]   I was with a friend recently who had used this.
[00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:29.800]   He was asking some questions.
[00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:33.840]   He wanted to speak with someone who's an experienced videographer who is experienced
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:36.920]   in doing videos for business people.
[00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:40.800]   He went ahead and booked a call with this person, spoke on the phone for about 30 minutes
[00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:44.720]   and just got some advice and got exactly what he needed.
[00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:46.400]   Many of you are experts in your field.
[00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:50.160]   If you're a photographer, if you're a business person, if you're an attorney,
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:54.060]   this could be a very simple way with no strings attached where you can just get connected
[00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:56.480]   with somebody who has a question.
[00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:57.600]   You can bill them.
[00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:59.460]   You choose the rate that you want to bill them.
[00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:00.460]   You can bill them.
[00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:01.460]   It's very simple.
[00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:08.000]   It'll work and you're not getting yourself in over your head with too many entanglements.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:12.040]   You're not getting in over the head with contracts and all those things.
[00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:17.160]   If you do a good job at this level, then you can go ahead and get into other things in
[00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:21.120]   the future where if you want that to lead into other services, other packages, things
[00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:23.080]   like that, I think that will be useful.
[00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:27.720]   I would have loved – now, I don't know the regulation on this but when I did have
[00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:31.040]   a firm, I would have loved – and I was actually licensed in insurance.
[00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:35.840]   I would have loved having the ability to have this as an option for people.
[00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:37.240]   The technology makes it so simple.
[00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:40.840]   If people just want to get your advice on the phone, no sale, no products, anything
[00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:43.400]   like that, they can just speak to you.
[00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:48.440]   Consider you yourself and see if this might be something that you would find useful as
[00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:50.960]   an extra business.
[00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:54.440]   I'm optimistic that many of you will find value in this.
[00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:58.060]   This is not my primary business going forward but I'm making it a priority for a little
[00:20:58.060 --> 00:21:02.200]   bit here while I'm building out other things behind the scenes.
[00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:07.600]   But in terms of the ability to set up just something as simple as a consulting practice,
[00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:11.760]   if you can do something similar to what I've done where you establish yourself as a known
[00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:19.560]   expert, as an expert in a brand, in an area, something as simple as this, a paid consulting
[00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:24.360]   phone call system could be your ticket to a mobile virtual income that you can do from
[00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:29.040]   anywhere and that could be very, very useful to many of you.
[00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:30.960]   You could take an area of expertise.
[00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:35.600]   Many of you who are personal finance bloggers with experienced blogs can take this and you
[00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:37.280]   can teach other bloggers.
[00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:41.840]   There are many personal finance bloggers or podcasters that I would be happy to have paid
[00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:46.080]   for 30 minutes of their advice or 30 minutes of their time, things like that.
[00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:47.080]   Consider it seriously.
[00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:48.440]   Be a mechanic.
[00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:54.080]   This could be a way where you can give somebody advice on something mechanically related.
[00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:57.420]   Just for a few minutes, they want to talk to you, you can set it up as a side business
[00:21:57.420 --> 00:21:58.420]   for yourself.
[00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:00.320]   It's a great model.
[00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:03.940]   Clarity.fm is the website that I'm using.
[00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:05.080]   There might be other options out there.
[00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:07.440]   I have not researched them.
[00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:09.320]   But check it out for yourself and see.
[00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:11.640]   I think it's a really, really great model.
[00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:12.640]   Pro tip.
[00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:15.360]   Well, we'll skip the pro tip for now.
[00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:16.360]   It's a great model.
[00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:19.720]   I encourage some of you to check it out and see if it would be useful.
[00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:22.840]   Like I said, I'm optimistic that many of you will find value in this.
[00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:25.840]   You'll hear me mention it a lot on the show going forward.
[00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:31.160]   Even if you don't want to speak to me personally, take my example and consider trying it yourself.
[00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:34.000]   I'm working on a course.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:39.320]   Working title is something like how to establish yourself as an expert in your industry in
[00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:40.800]   two years or less, something like that.
[00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:46.120]   I'm going to go through systematically what I have done to go from no name brand, no
[00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:53.360]   recognition to being a known and recognized brand and how you can do and model what I
[00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:54.800]   have done at a very low cost.
[00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:57.440]   A lot of work involved but you can do and model it.
[00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:02.680]   I'll lay it out for you with a specific series of steps in this course where I'm going to
[00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:08.440]   give you some pro tips that I've come up with that I see almost nobody else doing.
[00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:10.320]   I'm trying to save some of my stuff to sell.
[00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:11.600]   I give so much away.
[00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:14.760]   I'm trying to save something to sell to you to get you to buy this thing when I'm done
[00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:16.000]   with it.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.200]   But this can be a component of that and many of you could use this to build an expert business
[00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:25.400]   for yourself and then earn through something as simple as phone calls if you had a reliable
[00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:29.440]   consistent stream of income.
[00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:30.760]   I think it'll be useful for you.
[00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:31.760]   That's it.
[00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:33.840]   That's all I wanted to share with you on today's show.
[00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:37.200]   As we go, two things.
[00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:39.760]   First is an announcement.
[00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:44.980]   Next week I'm planning to do a series on disability income insurance.
[00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:49.040]   If you have a question on disability income insurance, send it to me.
[00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:51.840]   Email it to joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com.
[00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:53.960]   Email me your question on disability insurance.
[00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:58.560]   I will do my best to handle as many questions as possible but I'm going to do a series on
[00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:00.160]   disability income insurance.
[00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:01.160]   I think you'll enjoy that.
[00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:06.280]   It's something I mentioned a few times but I have not done detailed shows on it.
[00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:09.840]   I know many of you who want the technical financial planning stuff have been itching
[00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:10.840]   for that.
[00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:17.700]   If you've got a question for me on disability insurance, get it to me via email joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com.
[00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:22.580]   Second, thank you to those of you who are patrons and supporters of the show.
[00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:27.340]   One of my commitments that I've made to patrons and supporters is just to do my best for you
[00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:30.060]   to provide as much value as possible.
[00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:35.660]   As an example, I made the offer to work with patrons and I gave them advanced access at
[00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:43.220]   a significant discount to a phone call with me to those who are in the Facebook group,
[00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:46.140]   the irregulars level, the highest level of supporting patrons.
[00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:49.020]   So if you're at that level and you didn't get that offer, make sure that you either
[00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:53.460]   sign on to patreon.com or into the Facebook group and you'll see that offer there.
[00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:56.020]   I just wanted to say thank you to all of you who support the show.
[00:24:56.020 --> 00:25:00.460]   I wasn't able to open it up at that discount to those of you who are supporting it a few
[00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:05.100]   dollars a month just simply because I need to still create the show and still create
[00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:06.100]   other stuff.
[00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:08.360]   So I couldn't allocate the time there.
[00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:10.340]   But I'm doing my best to continue to give you guys value.
[00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:12.160]   I just want to thank you for your support.
[00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:16.940]   If you're not yet a supporter and patron of the show, go to radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron.
[00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:21.460]   Also remember, if you'd like to ask me a question but you don't want to pay for it on an hourly
[00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:25.380]   rate, you can always feel free to join as a patron of the show and access the Friday
[00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:26.380]   Q&A calls.
[00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:27.660]   That's a really great option.
[00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:31.140]   That'll probably be your least expensive option.
[00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:32.580]   Some of the calls, we have a number of callers.
[00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:35.980]   Some of the calls, we only have one or two callers, and you can get an extensive amount
[00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:39.580]   of time with me on those Q&A calls.
[00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:43.400]   Radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron, and I look forward to speaking to many of you for a consulting
[00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:44.400]   call.
[00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:49.300]   Go to radicalpersonalfinance.com/phonecall, radicalpersonalfinance.com/phonecall to set

[00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:00.240]   Live it with Fiji Airways.
