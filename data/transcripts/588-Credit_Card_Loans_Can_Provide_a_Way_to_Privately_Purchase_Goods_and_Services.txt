[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.680]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.600]   skills, insight and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.800]   while building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less. My name is Joshua. I am your host.
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:32.560]   And this in this episode today, we continue our credit card theme week. I've been celebrating the
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:38.240]   launch of my brand new credit card course called How to Borrow Money Safely and Never Pay Interest
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:43.360]   Using Credit Cards. And as part of the launch festivities, I'm sharing with you this week
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.560]   excerpts from the audio of particular modules of the course. Yesterday, I shared with you
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:54.160]   the audio called Credit Card Debt is a Very Safe Form of Debt. Today, I have a segment entitled
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.880]   Credit Card Loans Can Provide a Way to Privately Purchase Goods and Services. And we'll get right
[00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:04.240]   to that in about 120 seconds. And I'll just simply share with you that audio. But this
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:08.720]   fills a niche and talks about something that I think is underappreciated about credit cards.
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.040]   And I really want you to be equipped with that information. Remember, during this launch week,
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:21.840]   from now, Tuesday, October 9, until this coming Monday, October 15, 2018, you can save 10 bucks
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:28.960]   on the purchase of the course. Here's how you buy. Go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/creditcardcourse.
[00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:34.720]   Again, RadicalPersonalFinance.com/creditcardcourse. Use the coupon code CREDITCARD10,
[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.440]   T-E-N, CREDITCARD10, in the next week. And that'll save you $10 off it, bringing you the
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:46.400]   total cost of the course down to $29. Now, remember, $29 is equivalent to about one month's
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.720]   interest payment on a $2,000 credit card debt. So if you ever think you would have it and you
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:56.800]   want to figure out how to even eliminate that, it's a great deal. Go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/creditcardcourse.
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:02.320]   Use coupon code CREDITCARD10. Now, sit back and enjoy this audio, which is an excerpt from the
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:08.000]   course called "Credit Card Loans Can Provide a Way to Privately Purchase Goods and Services."
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:16.560]   Credit card loans themselves have a benefit of providing you with a way or multiple ways
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.720]   to privately purchase goods and services. Now, there are different levels to privacy.
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.000]   The first thing to consider is actually the transaction itself, the actual credit card
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.520]   transaction. And this transaction has varying levels of privacy, but it's worth considering
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.320]   that even though we usually don't think of credit card transactions as being private,
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:43.680]   they do give you a measure of privacy and protection. First, of course, the individual
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.640]   credit card transactions that you engage in can generally be kept private from other private
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:54.160]   individuals. Consider, if all that exists in your normal banking records is that you've made a
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.440]   normal payment to credit card company X, how can another person find out what you've actually
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:05.520]   purchased, especially if the transaction statements from the credit card company have been separately
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:12.000]   secured or destroyed? Nobody can go through your banking records or your checkbook and find out
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.360]   exactly what you bought with the credit card. They would need the actual credit card statements
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.000]   and the actual receipts. So you can use credit cards to structure your transactions and keep
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.560]   them private from other individuals. Also helpful is you can use credit card transactions to maintain
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:36.160]   privacy from things like banking inquiries. If you go to apply for a mortgage from a standard lender,
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.880]   one of the standard pieces of documentation that you need to provide in your loan application
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:47.280]   is several months of recent banking records. If you use a debit card for all of your normal
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:55.040]   transactions, now all of those transactions are going to be exposed to the scrutiny of that banker.
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.760]   This may or may not be a problem. This may or may not be information that you would prefer to keep
[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:05.680]   private. Now, if you make all of your transactions on a credit card and then once per month simply
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:12.880]   make a payment from your checking account to your credit card, now you can effectively shield
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:19.040]   the actual substance of those transactions from the mortgage lender. They will be able to know
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.600]   how much you owe on the credit card because they'll pull your credit report, but they have
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:30.320]   no need to actually see the individual transactions. Your $1,000 payment to the credit card company this
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:39.120]   month may be $110 transactions or it could be one single $1,000 transaction. They have no way to
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:45.520]   know, so that gives you a little bit of additional privacy in your transactions. Even the actual
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:51.440]   transaction record itself really only includes the merchant's information. So, depending on the
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:57.040]   merchant, you may be able to obscure the specific items or services purchased. A $1,000 spent at the
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:03.920]   local electronics store could be one $1,000 item or it could be multiple smaller items, and that
[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:09.040]   information is not recorded in the credit card transaction. So, that can be helpful as a measure
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:15.520]   of privacy. In addition, you can sometimes use credit card transactions in a more obscure way
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:21.440]   by using the credit card itself as a funding mechanism and using a third-party payment system
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:27.680]   as the payment mechanism. An example here would be PayPal. You fund your PayPal account with a
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:33.600]   credit card and now you have an additional layer of protection over your transaction.
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:38.960]   Or perhaps you create a virtual credit card using a payment system such as Blur,
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:44.560]   and you charge that to your existing credit card. Now you have an additional level of protection,
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:50.720]   so you can obscure your transactions further. And perhaps most importantly, you can always use a
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:58.560]   credit card for a cash advance. And as with any other physical cash transaction, once you slide
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:03.600]   your credit card into the cash machine and take money out, you can then take that money and do
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:09.200]   anything that you want with it. The records stop when the cash comes out of the ATM machine.
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:15.840]   This is very, very helpful because the credit card doesn't ask you what you're going to spend
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:20.400]   the money on. That's different than applying for an auto loan where they know you're going to spend
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:25.520]   the money on a car. That's different than applying for a furniture loan where they know you're going
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:30.960]   to spend the money on the furniture. You slide that credit card into the ATM, you take the cash
[00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:37.280]   out, and you buy whatever products or services you need to buy. And the credit card company itself
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:42.640]   doesn't know the content of those transactions. And of course, one of the most cost-effective
[00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:50.080]   ways for you to do this is to use a credit card to purchase your normal items, which then easily
[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:56.000]   frees up cash in your checking account for you to purchase perhaps more private items. So you can
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:02.880]   use the credit card as a payment mechanism while still being able to access cash that you can then
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:09.280]   use for other private transactions. When you add these benefits together, the ability to access a
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:16.080]   loan with significant privacy is very helpful. The most important feature of this is that because a
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:23.600]   credit card is not a secured debt, it can allow you to purchase items without making a specific
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:32.000]   loan application, which is then connected to a specific item. That is worth your considering.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:41.200]   Now, one other major aspect of privacy of transaction and privacy of credit is credit
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:49.600]   cards can provide for you needed funds without any personal entanglements or obnoxious privacy
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:55.360]   invading loan applications. It's much easier for you to fill out a loan application to
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:08:00.880]   credit card company X in the privacy of your own home, in the privacy of your own web browser,
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:07.520]   than it is for you to go to your wealthy uncle or wealthy aunt and ask them for money.
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:15.760]   They don't even have to know about your credit card application to credit card company X. So
[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:23.200]   this allows you to borrow money very privately without having any personal entanglements.
[00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:32.560]   It also allows you to borrow money without making any statement of the other aspects of your
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:40.240]   finances. Some loan applications are quite invasive in terms of their level of specificity
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:44.320]   that they require of your personal financial situation, but credit card loan applications
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:50.160]   are not that way. Generally, they will simply pull your credit report, ask you what your household
[00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:56.800]   annual income is, inquire about the amount of your rent payment or mortgage payment and whether you
[00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:02.080]   own your own home or not, and from there, they will do their underwriting simply based upon
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:07.760]   your credit score. Again, that's different than many other forms of financing which ask many more
[00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:16.160]   detailed questions. But when you can combine privacy of money while also avoiding personal
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:25.120]   entanglements, you have a very high quality of loan. Now in addition, if you are in a worst-case
[00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:32.560]   scenario and you default on your debt, if you have arranged things appropriately, that default
[00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:38.160]   can frequently be kept private. It can be kept private from employers. It can be kept private
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:44.880]   from family members. That default itself can be managed privately while maintaining the quality
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:51.200]   of your other relationships. This is very helpful because if you borrowed money from your wealthy
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:58.160]   aunt or uncle and you default on that payment, your holiday dinner will taste a little bit different
[00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:04.480]   as both of you try to eat through in the midst of the unpaid debts.
[00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:12.240]   These are major benefits of credit cards. So if you put together these benefits and perhaps others
[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:19.040]   that are more important to you, you will find that when you need debt, credit cards actually have
[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:23.040]   major benefits to offer and you should seriously consider them.
[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:28.640]   Now, if that piqued your interest and you'd like more, remember there are many more arguments for
