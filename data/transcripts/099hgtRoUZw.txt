[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.040]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.840]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.720]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.280]   Today, my guest is Dr. Wendy Suzuki.
[00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.120]   Dr. Suzuki is a professor of neuroscience and psychology
[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.560]   at New York University,
[00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.080]   and one of the leading researchers
[00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.380]   in the area of learning and memory.
[00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.540]   Her laboratory has contributed fundamental
[00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.000]   textbook understanding of how brain areas,
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.940]   such as the hippocampus, which you will learn about today,
[00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.440]   how the hippocampus and related brain circuits allow us
[00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.180]   to take certain experiences and commit them to memory
[00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.740]   so that we can use that information in the future.
[00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:45.040]   Dr. Suzuki is also an expert public educator
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.680]   in the realm of science.
[00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.240]   A few years back, she had a TED Talk
[00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.720]   that essentially went viral.
[00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:51.880]   If you haven't seen it already,
[00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.680]   you should absolutely check it out.
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.820]   In which she describes her experience using exercise
[00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.300]   as a way to enhance learning and memory.
[00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.640]   And on the basis of that personal experience,
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.620]   she reshaped her laboratory to explore how things
[00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.060]   like meditation, exercise,
[00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.240]   and other things that we can do with our physiology
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.580]   and our psychology can allow us to learn faster,
[00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.700]   to commit things to memory longer,
[00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.440]   and indeed to reshape our cognitive performance
[00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.360]   in a variety of settings.
[00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.300]   As such, I am delighted to announce
[00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.460]   that Dr. Suzuki is now not only running a laboratory
[00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:26.940]   at New York University,
[00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.300]   but she is the incoming Dean of Arts and Science
[00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.860]   at New York University.
[00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.660]   And of course she was selected for that role
[00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.180]   for her many talents.
[00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.740]   But one of the important aspects of her program,
[00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.140]   she tells me, is going to be to incorporate
[00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.820]   the incredible power of exercise, meditation,
[00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.060]   and other behavioral practices for enhancing learning,
[00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.260]   for improving stress management,
[00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.740]   and other things to optimize student performance.
[00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.660]   Today, you are going to get access
[00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.140]   to much of that information so that you can apply
[00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.060]   those tools in your daily life as well.
[00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.900]   Dr. Suzuki is also an author of several important books.
[00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.260]   The most recent one is entitled "Good Anxiety,
[00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.620]   Harnessing the Power of the Most Misunderstood Emotion,"
[00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.300]   and a previous book entitled "Healthy Brain, Happy Life,
[00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.300]   A Personal Program to Activate Your Brain
[00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.100]   and Do Everything Better."
[00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.560]   And while that is admittedly a very pop science type title,
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.380]   I will remind you that she is one of the preeminent
[00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.540]   memory researchers in the world
[00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.980]   and has been for quite a while.
[00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.540]   So the information that you'll glean from those books
[00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.120]   is both rich in depth and breadth and is highly applicable.
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.760]   By the end of today's discussion,
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.020]   you will have learned from Dr. Suzuki
[00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.960]   a large amount of knowledge about how memories are formed,
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.180]   how they are lost,
[00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.900]   and you will have a much larger kit of tools to apply
[00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.260]   for your efforts to learn better, to remember better,
[00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.000]   and to apply that information in the ways
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.400]   that best serve you.
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.940]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.860]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.040]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.500]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.340]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.380]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.160]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.380]   Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.
[00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:10.960]   Athletic Greens is an all-in-one
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.420]   vitamin mineral probiotic drink.
[00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.140]   I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,
[00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.580]   so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.460]   The reason I started taking Athletic Greens
[00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:22.000]   and the reason I still take Athletic Greens
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.260]   once or twice a day is that it meets
[00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.680]   all my foundational vitamin mineral and probiotic needs.
[00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.760]   In fact, whenever people ask me
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.540]   if I were to only take one supplement,
[00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:32.820]   which supplement should I take?
[00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.460]   I tell them Athletic Greens for the simple reason
[00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:37.140]   that it covers your base of vitamins,
[00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.640]   minerals, and probiotics.
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.500]   It also has important adaptogens,
[00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.740]   digestive enzymes for gut health.
[00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:45.300]   All of this is very important because we now know
[00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.860]   that gut health and the so-called gut-brain axis
[00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.100]   is very important for things like mood and brain function,
[00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.940]   and also contributes to immune system function.
[00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.900]   With Athletic Greens, you're covering all those bases,
[00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.060]   and of course, you need to eat a nutrition
[00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.940]   and healthy diet that's right for you.
[00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.080]   But by taking Athletic Greens once or twice a day,
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.760]   you can be sure that there are going to be no gaps
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.820]   or deficiencies in your vitamin, mineral,
[00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.900]   or probiotic needs.
[00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.940]   I mix mine with water and a little bit of lemon juice
[00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.780]   or lime juice, and I personally find it delicious.
[00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:16.100]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.040]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.220]   to claim a special offer.
[00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:21.980]   They'll give you five free travel packs
[00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.980]   plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2,
[00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:26.380]   both of which are also vital
[00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.300]   for immediate and long-term health.
[00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.500]   So once again, if you go to athleticgreens.com/huberman,
[00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.420]   you can get a special offer of five free travel packs
[00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.320]   to make it easy to mix up Athletic Greens
[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.780]   while you're in the car or otherwise traveling.
[00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.180]   Plus, they'll give you the year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.980]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Inside Tracker.
[00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.540]   Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:50.100]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:51.700]   to help you better understand your body
[00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.880]   and help you reach your health goals.
[00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.820]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
[00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:59.100]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.380]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.960]   can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.760]   And nowadays, with the advent of modern DNA tests,
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.820]   you can also get insight into, for instance,
[00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:10.300]   what your biological age is
[00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:11.960]   and compare that to your chronological age.
[00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.520]   And of course, your biological age
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.260]   is the number that really matters.
[00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.720]   With Inside Tracker, there's a distinct advantage.
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.140]   And the advantage is that while there are many blood tests
[00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:22.180]   and DNA tests out there,
[00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.540]   Inside Tracker's blood and DNA tests
[00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:28.460]   come also with a platform, meaning a website platform,
[00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:32.360]   that allows you to see exactly what you could or should do
[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.700]   in order to adjust the numbers on things like hormone levels,
[00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.180]   metabolic factors, and lipids, and so on.
[00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:39.340]   It's a little pop-up window.
[00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:41.860]   It points to nutritional, supplementation,
[00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:43.620]   and behavioral regimens that you can take
[00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.540]   in order to put those numbers in the ranges
[00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:46.960]   that are optimal for you.
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.400]   If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.260]   you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman
[00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.060]   to get 20% off any of Inside Tracker's plans.
[00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:57.900]   That's insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off.
[00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.540]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Blinkist.
[00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:03.640]   Blinkist is an app that has thousands of nonfiction books,
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.580]   each condensed down to just 15 minutes
[00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.780]   of key takeaways for those books.
[00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:10.160]   I love reading books from front to back.
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.580]   I like the actual physical book.
[00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:12.940]   I'm sort of old-fashioned in that way.
[00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:15.100]   And I do also listen to audio books.
[00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:18.480]   It's very rare that I don't finish a book that I've started.
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.020]   Nonetheless, I like to revisit some of my favorite books.
[00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.260]   I also like to write down key takeaways from those books,
[00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.620]   sometimes even before I listen to the full-length book.
[00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:28.980]   So I don't mind spoiling the takeaways
[00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:30.120]   because when I read nonfiction,
[00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:31.380]   generally I'm trying to extract
[00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:33.260]   the most valuable knowledge from them.
[00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.180]   So I often listen to a Blinkist 15-minute version,
[00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:39.480]   then the full-length book, or sometimes the full-length book,
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.500]   and then the Blinkist 15-minute version,
[00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:44.460]   either way, Blinkist is a great way to get through any book
[00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:46.920]   and to extract the best from those books.
[00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:49.720]   I've used it for, for instance, Matt Walker's "Why We Sleep,"
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.980]   an excellent book on why we sleep,
[00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:55.020]   as well as Tim Ferriss' "The Four-Hour Body,"
[00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:59.100]   Nassim Taleb's "The Black Swan," and so on and so on.
[00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:01.580]   With Blinkist, you get unlimited access to read or listen
[00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:04.180]   to a massive library of nonfiction books.
[00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:06.540]   It really is a treasure trove of information.
[00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:08.120]   Right now, Blinkist has a special offer
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.020]   just for Huberman Lab Podcast listeners.
[00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:12.540]   If you go to blinkist.com/huberman,
[00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:14.660]   you can get a free seven-day trial
[00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:18.120]   and 25% off a Blinkist premium membership.
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:21.060]   Once again, go to blinkist.com/huberman
[00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:24.260]   to get a seven-day free trial and 25% off.
[00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.980]   And now for my discussion with Dr. Wendy Suzuki.
[00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:30.340]   Wendy, great to see you again and to have you here.
[00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:31.560]   It's been a little while.
[00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:32.620]   - It's been a while.
[00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:33.940]   So great to be here, Andrew.
[00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:35.260]   Thank you so much for having me.
[00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:36.160]   - Yeah, delighted.
[00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:40.820]   I'd like to start off by talking about memory generally.
[00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:44.780]   And then I'd love to chat about your incredible work
[00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:48.020]   discovering how exercise and memory interface
[00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:49.980]   and what people can do to improve their memory
[00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:51.860]   and brain function generally.
[00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:54.980]   But for those that are not familiar,
[00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:56.460]   maybe you could just step us through
[00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:58.900]   the basic elements of memory.
[00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:01.180]   A few brain structures, perhaps.
[00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:02.620]   What happens when I, for instance,
[00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:07.220]   this mug of tea is pretty unremarkable,
[00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:09.700]   but the fact that now I've talked about it,
[00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:11.700]   I don't know that I'll ever forget about it.
[00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:12.940]   Maybe I will, maybe I won't.
[00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:15.740]   So what happens when I look at this mug
[00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:19.940]   and decide that it's something special for whatever reason?
[00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:22.860]   - Yeah, well, I like to see there are four things
[00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:25.060]   that make things memorable.
[00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:28.060]   Number one is novelty.
[00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:30.940]   If it's something new, the very first thing,
[00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:32.740]   the very first time we've seen something
[00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:35.660]   or experienced something, our brains are drawn to that.
[00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:37.900]   Our attentional systems draw us to that.
[00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:40.020]   And when you are paying attention to something,
[00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:43.460]   that's part of what makes things memorable.
[00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:45.220]   Second is repetition.
[00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:48.460]   If you see that cup of tea every single day
[00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:50.300]   and every single time you do an interview,
[00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:52.460]   you talk about your cup of tea, you're gonna remember it.
[00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:57.140]   That's just how our brains work, repetition works.
[00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:59.780]   Third is association.
[00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:04.180]   So if you meet somebody new
[00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:07.060]   that knows lots of people that you know,
[00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:09.980]   so you and I share many, many, many, many people
[00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:14.420]   that we both know, it's easier to remember you,
[00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:16.220]   especially if you were somebody new
[00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:18.660]   that I hadn't met before, we have met before.
[00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:20.100]   So association.
[00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:24.700]   And then the fourth one is emotional resonance.
[00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:26.900]   So we remember the happiest
[00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:29.340]   and the saddest moments of our lives.
[00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:33.700]   And that also includes funny, surprising things.
[00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:38.460]   That is the interaction between two key brain structures,
[00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:43.020]   the amygdala, which is important for processing
[00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:44.820]   lots of emotional, particularly threatening
[00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:46.260]   kinds of situations.
[00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:50.300]   But those threatening, surprising kinds of situations,
[00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:52.100]   the amygdala takes that information
[00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:56.540]   and makes another key structure called the hippocampus
[00:09:56.540 --> 00:10:01.540]   work better to put new long-term memories in your brain.
[00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:06.620]   So that in fact is the key structure for long-term memory,
[00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:08.940]   the structure called the hippocampus.
[00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:10.860]   - Fantastic, so novelty, repetition,
[00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:13.180]   association and emotional resonance.
[00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:14.140]   - Yes.
[00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:16.100]   - You can tell us a bit more about the hippocampus.
[00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:19.180]   I think at least for my generation,
[00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:20.140]   well, I'm a neuroscientist,
[00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:21.700]   but for most people in my generation,
[00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:23.620]   I think they first heard about the hippocampus
[00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:24.860]   from the movie "Memento."
[00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:25.700]   - Oh yeah.
[00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:27.100]   - The guy says hippocampus.
[00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:28.140]   - Yeah.
[00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:29.780]   - And for those of you that haven't seen that movie,
[00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:32.140]   it's a bizarrely constructed movie,
[00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:36.180]   but an interesting one nonetheless about memory.
[00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:38.300]   But even as a neuroscientist,
[00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:43.300]   sometimes I'm perplexed at how the hippocampus works.
[00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:46.620]   Maybe you could, if you would,
[00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:48.380]   step us through kind of what this structure is,
[00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:51.300]   what it looks like, maybe a few of its sub regions,
[00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:55.780]   because unlike vision, the topic that I've worked
[00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:58.220]   most of my career on, where we know,
[00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:00.580]   okay, the eye does this part and the thalamus does this part
[00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:01.860]   and the cortex does that part,
[00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:03.020]   I've always been a little perplexed
[00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:04.580]   about the hippocampus, frankly.
[00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:05.500]   - Okay.
[00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:07.380]   - And I've read the textbooks and I've heard the lectures,
[00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:09.180]   but I'd love to get the update.
[00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:11.180]   What are the general themes of the hippocampus
[00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:13.860]   as a structure and its function?
[00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:16.580]   What do you think everyone, including neuroscientists,
[00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:18.060]   should know about the hippocampus?
[00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:21.220]   - Absolutely, so let's start with the basics.
[00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:24.180]   The word hippocampus means seahorse.
[00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:26.260]   It is shaped, the structure is shaped
[00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:30.540]   like a kind of curly Q seahorse, that is accurate.
[00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:33.700]   Everybody, including neuroscientists,
[00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:35.140]   should know it's a beautiful structure.
[00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:38.900]   It is visually anatomically beautiful
[00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:42.200]   with these kind of intertwining,
[00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:45.580]   twirly sub regions within it.
[00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:49.100]   And I think that's one of the reasons why early anatomists,
[00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:50.940]   who were the very first neuroscientists,
[00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:53.460]   got attracted to it because it's this interesting
[00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:56.980]   kind of twirly structure deep in the heart of the brain.
[00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:58.820]   So that's anatomically.
[00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:01.620]   Functionally, what does it do?
[00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:05.860]   Well, it's easiest to understand what it does
[00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:08.680]   when you look at what happens
[00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:10.580]   when you don't have a hippocampus anymore.
[00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:14.180]   What if you, what if by some disease
[00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:18.300]   or you have your hippocampus removed by accident,
[00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:19.260]   what happens?
[00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:23.000]   Well, we know this from the most famous
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.140]   neurological patient of all time.
[00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:28.020]   His initials were H.M.,
[00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:32.620]   so all psychology and neuroscience students know him.
[00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:37.020]   He was operated in 1954,
[00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:40.560]   and the paper was published in 1957.
[00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:42.780]   They removed both his hippocampi
[00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:45.700]   because he had very terrible epilepsy.
[00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:48.020]   And they knew that the hippocampus
[00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:50.300]   was the genesis of epilepsy.
[00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:51.740]   And this was experimental.
[00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:54.940]   His epilepsy was so bad that they decided
[00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:57.900]   not just to remove one hippocampus, but both.
[00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:00.240]   And what happened was immediate,
[00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:06.360]   immediate loss of all ability to form new memories
[00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:07.860]   for facts and events.
[00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:10.020]   Think about that for a second.
[00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:13.520]   All facts or events you're not able to remember.
[00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:16.660]   I can't remember this interaction between us.
[00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:18.380]   I can't remember any of the facts
[00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:22.420]   that we were just chatting about in our neuroscience lives.
[00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:27.420]   None of that can move into our long-term memory.
[00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:29.900]   So this hippocampus does something
[00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:32.900]   with all of these perceptions that are coming at us
[00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:35.380]   every single day, every minute of the day,
[00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:38.780]   and not for all of them, but for some of them
[00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:40.880]   that have these features that we just talked about.
[00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:42.860]   Maybe they're novel, maybe they have associations,
[00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:44.580]   maybe they're emotionally relevant,
[00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:48.180]   maybe they've been repeated.
[00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:51.540]   Some of those things in the realm of facts or events
[00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:55.820]   get encoded in our long-term memory.
[00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:59.380]   And that's the textbook of why
[00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:01.360]   the hippocampus is so important.
[00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:03.420]   I like to always add, and I mean,
[00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:06.420]   this is why I studied it for so many years,
[00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:07.900]   the hippocampus and what it does
[00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:11.400]   really defines our own personal histories.
[00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:13.700]   It means it defines who we are.
[00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:16.960]   Because if we can't remember what we've done,
[00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:19.140]   the information we've learned,
[00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:22.820]   and the events of our lives, it changes us.
[00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:24.660]   That's what really defines us.
[00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:27.600]   That's why I wanted to study the hippocampus.
[00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:31.380]   And I think the exciting new ideas
[00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:33.820]   about the hippocampus was,
[00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:37.580]   is that hippocampus is important for memory.
[00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:40.300]   So if you say that, you'll impress all your people
[00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:42.780]   at your cocktail party.
[00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:46.020]   But what people have started to realize,
[00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:49.000]   that it's not just memory.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.960]   It's not just putting together associations
[00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:54.820]   for what, where, and when of events
[00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:56.660]   that happened in our past,
[00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:58.660]   but it's putting together information
[00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:01.500]   that is in our long-term memory banks
[00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:04.220]   in interesting new ways.
[00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:06.180]   I'm talking about imagination.
[00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:09.620]   So without the hippocampus, yes, you can't remember things,
[00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:13.880]   but actually you're not able to imagine events
[00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:17.640]   or situations that you've never experienced before.
[00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:21.680]   So what that says is the hippocampus is important for memory
[00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:24.060]   is a too simple a way to think about it.
[00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:26.460]   What the hippocampus is important for
[00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:28.060]   is what we've already talked about,
[00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:30.780]   associating things together writ large.
[00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:33.540]   Anytime you need to associate something together,
[00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:37.060]   either for your past, your present, or your future,
[00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:38.860]   you are using your hippocampus.
[00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:43.060]   And it takes on this much more important role
[00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:45.940]   in our cognitive lives when we think about it like that.
[00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:49.540]   That is kind of the new, the new hippocampus
[00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:52.420]   that neuroscientists are studying these days.
[00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:53.260]   - That's fantastic.
[00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.740]   So it sounds like it really sets context,
[00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:58.140]   but it can do that with elements from the past,
[00:15:58.140 --> 00:15:59.820]   the present, or the future.
[00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:00.660]   - Yes.
[00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:03.100]   - And the, well, for neuroscientists,
[00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:04.460]   the phrase is domain.
[00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:05.960]   We say the time domain,
[00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:08.380]   meaning as opposed to just evaluating things in space.
[00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:11.740]   It sounds like the time domain of hippocampal functioning
[00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:13.100]   is incredibly interesting.
[00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:13.940]   - It is.
[00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:15.940]   - And even the fact that we can have short-term,
[00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:17.140]   medium-term, and long-term memories,
[00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:19.820]   and we could go down any of these rabbit holes.
[00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:21.100]   I'll ask you a true or false,
[00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:23.980]   mostly because I just really want to know the answer.
[00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:27.420]   A few years ago, the theme in various high-profile reviews
[00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:30.800]   seemed to be that the hippocampus was involved in encoding,
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:33.760]   in creating memories, but not in storing memories,
[00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:36.420]   and that the memory storage was in the neocortex
[00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:38.620]   or the other overlying areas of the brain.
[00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:40.620]   Is that too general a statement?
[00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:45.760]   - That's a tricky statement,
[00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:49.940]   because I think that ultimately, yes,
[00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:53.340]   that long-term memories are stored in the cortex,
[00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:55.620]   but those memories are stored in the hippocampus
[00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:58.540]   sometimes for a very, very long time.
[00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:01.920]   So how long is too long,
[00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:03.740]   where you say, oh, it's not the hippocampus anymore?
[00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:06.360]   If it's four years, is that?
[00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:09.920]   Does that mean that it's not stored in the hippocampus?
[00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:12.180]   I think that's a tricky question,
[00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:13.820]   and yes, it was coming up a lot
[00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:15.580]   because people were debating it,
[00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:18.320]   and some people did think that you shouldn't think
[00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:20.760]   about the hippocampus as a storage area,
[00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:23.500]   but I think it's a long, long, long-term
[00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:26.360]   kind of intermediate storage area,
[00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:28.640]   maybe not the long-term storage area.
[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:30.460]   That's why it's hard to answer that question.
[00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:31.600]   - Great.
[00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:35.420]   As I recall, H.M. could remember facts
[00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:37.280]   from before his surgery.
[00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:39.300]   He couldn't form new memories.
[00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:40.960]   And given that he had no hippocampus,
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:43.380]   it would at least partially support the idea
[00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:47.120]   that some memories are retained outside the hippocampus.
[00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:51.720]   - However, he did have part of his posterior hippocampus
[00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:54.800]   intact, so that's the tricky thing.
[00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:59.800]   I think initially, in fact, Scoville, the neurosurgeon,
[00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:03.640]   overestimated the number of millimeters
[00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:07.360]   he intended to remove of the hippocampus,
[00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:12.360]   and then when they did the very historic MRI of H.M.
[00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:15.920]   later in his life, they showed that, in fact,
[00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:17.880]   he did have that posterior hippocampus,
[00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:19.960]   part of the posterior hippocampus intact.
[00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:24.120]   So now it makes it a little bit more complicated
[00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:25.600]   to interpret what's going on,
[00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:28.440]   not that it was never uncomplicated.
[00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:31.440]   Any interpretation of a lesion in a patient,
[00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:33.300]   as you know, is complicated,
[00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:38.300]   but H.M. had this mythical role in neuroscience
[00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:42.320]   and neurology, and now it was complicated
[00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:45.640]   because he does have more of the hippocampus intact.
[00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:46.860]   - I did not know that.
[00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:52.840]   There are some memories that can be formed very quickly,
[00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:54.600]   so-called one-trial learning.
[00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:56.320]   And I'm just looking at this list again,
[00:18:56.320 --> 00:19:00.200]   novelty, repetition, association, and emotional resonance.
[00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:03.600]   It seems like some experiences
[00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:06.060]   can bypass the need for multiple repetitions.
[00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:06.900]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:11.740]   - So, and unfortunately, it seems that our nervous system
[00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:15.160]   is skewed toward creating one-trial memories
[00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:19.780]   for negative events, which has a survival-adaptive mechanism.
[00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:23.200]   What is the neural connection that allows that to happen?
[00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:25.740]   Is it the amygdala to hippocampus connection?
[00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:26.580]   I mean, as you and I know,
[00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:28.700]   it seems like every brain area ultimately
[00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:29.780]   is connected to everything else.
[00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:31.880]   It's just a question of through how many nodes,
[00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:33.840]   just like every city is connected to another city.
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:35.320]   It's just a question of how many flights
[00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:40.320]   and roads do you have to traverse before you get there?
[00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:42.820]   What is it about one-trial learning?
[00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:45.860]   I mean, at a kind of top contour level,
[00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:49.760]   how can we learn certain things so fast?
[00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:51.360]   And other things are tricky.
[00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:52.940]   And now every time I look at this white mug,
[00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:54.320]   it's queuing up something special
[00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:56.460]   that simply by virtue of saying it.
[00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:58.300]   So is that one-trial memory?
[00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:03.300]   But what is it about very emotionally salient events
[00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:06.340]   that allow memories to get stamped in?
[00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:10.220]   - Yeah, I mean, I think you've already alluded to it,
[00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:15.020]   that is, there is this protective function of our brains
[00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:18.260]   that has evolved over the last 2.5 million years,
[00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:20.380]   that you need to pay attention
[00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:23.980]   and remember certain things for your survival.
[00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:26.160]   So some things that get stamped in,
[00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:30.860]   they're memories, but they're fear memories.
[00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:35.860]   If I get mugged on the subway or there are terrible things
[00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:38.900]   that could happen on the subway, as we just learned.
[00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:40.160]   But if something terrible happens,
[00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:43.900]   if something very scary happens, you remember that.
[00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:48.420]   And that fear and that memory of all those things.
[00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:52.260]   I mean, I have one, when I lived in Washington, DC,
[00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:54.820]   I went to work at NIH on a Sunday afternoon
[00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:57.360]   and I came back and when I rounded the corner
[00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:01.640]   to my door of my apartment, it was crowbarred in.
[00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:04.740]   Somebody had taken a crowbar, opened up my door
[00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:09.740]   and stole all of the nicest things in my apartment,
[00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:10.820]   which wasn't that nice
[00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:13.320]   'cause I wasn't making that much money.
[00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:18.320]   But ever since then, whenever I rounded that corner,
[00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:19.700]   I still had that memory.
[00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:22.340]   It was terrible because it put me in a terrible state
[00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:24.460]   when I was just coming home.
[00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:26.820]   And that's a survival mechanism.
[00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:30.460]   - Do you want to be alert to possible danger?
[00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:31.780]   Absolutely, yes.
[00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:35.440]   So part of those one trial memories,
[00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:38.000]   I think is often taking advantage
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.460]   of this evolutionarily developed system
[00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:45.340]   to tamp in things that could be potentially dangerous to you
[00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:46.540]   into your memory.
[00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:51.220]   So you forever will remember this particular corner
[00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:54.520]   or this hallway because that is where something
[00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:56.620]   really bad happened to you.
[00:21:56.620 --> 00:21:58.340]   - It seems like a location.
[00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:00.660]   We talked about conditioned place aversion,
[00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:03.620]   which is just a geek speak for wanting to avoid the place
[00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:06.280]   where something bad happened or condition place preference,
[00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:07.420]   wanting to go back to a place
[00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:08.860]   where something positive happened.
[00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:10.140]   We've been looking at a photograph
[00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:12.540]   of where you had a wonderful time with somebody
[00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:16.020]   and that can evoke all sorts of positive sensations.
[00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:20.620]   It seems like at some level, as complex as the brain is,
[00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:24.220]   the basic elements of feeling good or feeling lousy
[00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:26.500]   are states within the brain and body.
[00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:28.560]   And linking those to places seems like
[00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:30.460]   it's a pretty straightforward formula.
[00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:34.260]   Link place to state, link state to place, et cetera,
[00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:36.980]   as your description just provided.
[00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:39.620]   When we learn more complex information,
[00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:44.420]   a poem, a concept,
[00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:47.140]   or we have to ratchet through a set of ideas,
[00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:49.720]   that also involves memory.
[00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:53.540]   I'm sure that we'll talk more about this,
[00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:58.540]   but is there any way that you're aware of that state,
[00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:04.020]   bodily state, can be leveraged to enhance the speed
[00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:09.220]   or the quality of memories and memory formation?
[00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:12.780]   Because, you know, so to be clear about it,
[00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:16.000]   it seems there's something very important about this fourth,
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.420]   you know, this emotional resonance component, right?
[00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:22.100]   Novelty, the crowbar into the doors,
[00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:24.060]   thank goodness sounds like it was novel,
[00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:26.220]   it wasn't a repeated thing, thank goodness.
[00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:28.020]   So repetition is out and the association
[00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:30.040]   is very, very strong.
[00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:32.900]   But for people trying to learn information
[00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:35.060]   that they're not that excited about,
[00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:38.180]   or that repetition is hard,
[00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:43.180]   or the novelty is simply that it's painful.
[00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:45.220]   - Yes, I've been there, absolutely.
[00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:47.700]   - Yeah, as have I.
[00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:51.500]   Is there something that we can do to leverage knowledge
[00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:53.500]   of how the memory system works naturally
[00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:56.860]   to make that a more straightforward process?
[00:23:56.860 --> 00:24:02.740]   - So I immediately turn to the things that I've studied
[00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:07.220]   that you talk about so beautifully on your podcast,
[00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:12.220]   which are strategies generally
[00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:14.380]   to make your brain work better.
[00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:18.820]   I was just reminding myself of your podcast about cold
[00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:21.980]   because I use that every morning.
[00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:22.980]   - Oh, you do cold? - I do, I do.
[00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:24.940]   - Just take a moment and just tell us
[00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:26.380]   what is your cold exposure protocol,
[00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:27.620]   then I'll take you back to what you're saying.
[00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:29.900]   - So my cold exposure protocol
[00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:34.900]   is at the end of every morning shower that I take,
[00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:37.700]   you know, the shower is warm,
[00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:42.520]   but I give myself a big blast of cold at the end of that.
[00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:45.700]   And it makes me feel so good.
[00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:48.100]   And because I've been doing it for several years,
[00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:49.580]   it's so much less painful.
[00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:53.600]   Okay, I admit it was really painful at the beginning,
[00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:55.820]   but it's much less painful.
[00:24:55.820 --> 00:24:57.900]   I could handle the cold water
[00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:01.300]   and my pipes give nice, really cold water.
[00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:06.820]   And I could feel the awakeness
[00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:09.540]   kind of come up in me after that.
[00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:12.140]   And I miss it if I forget to do it.
[00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:16.140]   Sometimes I run back in and give myself that cold blast
[00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:20.260]   because it is upping, you know,
[00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:21.980]   I think you talked about this on your podcast,
[00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:23.700]   what's happening in the brain?
[00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:26.900]   - Basically the cold stimulus, that shock,
[00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:29.020]   that, you know, catching your breath, et cetera,
[00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:31.520]   is adrenaline from the adrenals.
[00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:33.580]   But also from what we understand now,
[00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:35.260]   some new neuroimaging,
[00:25:35.260 --> 00:25:37.300]   there's epinephrine and norepinephrine
[00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:38.580]   released from locus coeruleus,
[00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:40.740]   which again is a brain structure in the back of the brain,
[00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:42.620]   got sprinklers the rest of the brain
[00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:44.820]   with a kind of a wake-up chemical.
[00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:47.580]   And there's a long arc on dopamine release.
[00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:51.500]   This paper back in 2000 showed that it's a steady increase
[00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:54.100]   up to about 2.5 X of circulating dopamine.
[00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:56.500]   So they weren't looking directly in the brain admittedly,
[00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:58.980]   but it goes on for four or five hours.
[00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:02.060]   So the improved mood and the feeling of alertness
[00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:02.940]   is a real thing.
[00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:05.780]   - Yeah, yeah, so I use that.
[00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:09.160]   I mean, so basically I use my morning routine.
[00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:10.220]   What is my morning routine?
[00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:15.220]   I get up, I do a 45-minute tea meditation.
[00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:18.660]   So meditating over the brewing and drinking of tea
[00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:23.300]   that I learned from a monk who has an institute in Taiwan
[00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:25.660]   where he teaches tea meditation, love it.
[00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:29.680]   I've learned all about tea, different kinds of tea.
[00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:34.680]   And then I do a 30-minute cardio weights workout.
[00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:39.780]   Then I take my shower with the hot cold contrast.
[00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:44.380]   And oh, and before that, key thing,
[00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:46.980]   if I wanna learn something and I want to be able
[00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:51.980]   to get over the difficulty of repeating things
[00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:56.600]   or just push myself to do stuff, sleep.
[00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:58.740]   So good, good sleep.
[00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:01.280]   I've learned that over the pandemic,
[00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:03.660]   I did sleep experiments on myself
[00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:05.920]   and I learned that I was sleeping an hour less
[00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:07.020]   than I really needed.
[00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:09.580]   So I really need seven and a half to eight hours of sleep.
[00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:11.180]   And I was getting six and a half.
[00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:16.180]   And so now, I get that seven and a half to eight hours
[00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:17.820]   every single night.
[00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:18.940]   And guess what?
[00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:21.380]   I come to different difficult tasks
[00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:24.460]   and I am more willing to give it a try,
[00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:26.580]   to try longer, to try harder.
[00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:28.220]   And my brain works better.
[00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:30.300]   And so I think probably if you go back
[00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:32.700]   to all of your podcasts, you'll learn exactly
[00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:34.940]   why each one of those things that I do,
[00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:37.780]   which I would bet that you probably do too,
[00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:38.940]   is helping my brain.
[00:27:39.620 --> 00:27:41.780]   - I guarantee they are.
[00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:43.420]   And I'm impressed that you do all these things,
[00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:44.660]   although not surprised.
[00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:47.020]   And I should say that the extra hour of sleep
[00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:50.340]   is really impressive and extremely beneficial.
[00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:53.260]   I'm curious, do you get that in the early part of the night
[00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:54.260]   by going to bed earlier?
[00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:55.780]   - Yeah, yeah. - Terrific.
[00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:58.100]   And I should just mention,
[00:27:58.100 --> 00:27:59.300]   'cause you're too humble to do it,
[00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:00.620]   but I'll say it again,
[00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:03.860]   that yes, not only are you a full professor running,
[00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:06.340]   a tenured full professor and running a laboratory,
[00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:09.460]   you teach undergraduates, you have an important role
[00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:10.980]   in public education, multiple books,
[00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:14.100]   and you're now Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences
[00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:14.940]   at NYU.
[00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:17.340]   So the extra hour of sleep is benefiting you
[00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:21.900]   and as a consequence, benefiting everybody else as well.
[00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:23.620]   Thanks for sharing with us your protocol.
[00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:26.460]   I took you off the trajectory of what one can do,
[00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:31.060]   but I think that people and I appreciate knowing
[00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:33.060]   kind of what the practical steps are.
[00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:34.620]   Because knowing the science is important,
[00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:36.580]   the mechanism I do believe is important
[00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:38.780]   for embedding protocols in people's minds
[00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:39.940]   and why they might want to do them.
[00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:43.700]   But really hearing that the mechanics of it is useful.
[00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:45.740]   It sounds like everything together takes about an hour.
[00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:47.580]   It's not an excessive amount of time,
[00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:50.860]   but it probably gives you an outsized positive effect
[00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:51.700]   on your day.
[00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:54.700]   - Absolutely, I definitely notice it
[00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:56.420]   if I'm not able to do it.
[00:28:56.420 --> 00:29:00.460]   And when I don't, so I do this seven days a week.
[00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:04.300]   It's also not just five days, seven days a week.
[00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:08.300]   And when I can't do it, it's usually early morning flights
[00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:09.460]   or things like that.
[00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:14.060]   And I get over it, but it's critical.
[00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:16.180]   Critical for the working of my brain.
[00:29:16.180 --> 00:29:17.020]   - I love it.
[00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:18.740]   And I'll just highlight one thing that you said
[00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:20.380]   before we move on, which is that you said,
[00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:22.820]   sometimes if you get out of the shower before the cold,
[00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:24.060]   you'll get back in.
[00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:26.700]   That's to me a really beautiful example
[00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:28.900]   of condition place preference.
[00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:30.660]   Now the cold showers become something
[00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:32.220]   that you sort of look forward to.
[00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:34.660]   I should say that nobody is immune
[00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:36.860]   from the adrenaline increase of cold.
[00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:39.340]   No matter how cold, this is what's interesting about cold.
[00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:41.820]   It's one of the reasons why it's such an important part
[00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:43.660]   of the screening for special operations,
[00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:44.740]   you know, sort of SEAL teams,
[00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:47.380]   but other branches of military too,
[00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:50.660]   which is that there are very few stimuli
[00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:52.660]   that you can give anyone
[00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:57.660]   and consistently get an adrenaline release from that
[00:29:57.660 --> 00:29:58.700]   without harming them.
[00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:00.980]   You know, with heat, eventually you need to use so much heat
[00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:02.260]   that you damage tissue.
[00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:03.700]   Or with exercise, you have to use,
[00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:05.740]   once you exercise it, you can damage joints.
[00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:08.740]   You know, and it's this very kind of brilliant,
[00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:13.100]   I don't know if it was intentional or not.
[00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:14.700]   It's sort of unintentional genius
[00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:16.660]   that special operations has figured out
[00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:19.500]   that by sending people back into the cold over and over,
[00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:21.140]   it never really gets easier.
[00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:23.740]   But over time, people actually start to crave it.
[00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:26.660]   And it provides this reduction in inflammation, et cetera.
[00:30:26.660 --> 00:30:28.420]   So anyway, beautiful practice.
[00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:29.260]   Thank you.
[00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:30.580]   I want to learn more about your tea meditation
[00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:31.500]   later in the episode.
[00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:33.580]   But in any event,
[00:30:33.580 --> 00:30:38.580]   returning to ways that we can improve memory formation,
[00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:43.420]   maybe if you would tell us your story around this.
[00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:44.860]   I know you've told it before,
[00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:47.180]   but I think a lot of members of the audience
[00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:49.460]   and I would love to hear, you know, how you came to this.
[00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:51.300]   Because growing up in neuroscience,
[00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:53.260]   I knew you as one of the,
[00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:55.340]   I would say one of the three or four,
[00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:57.420]   and they're all alongside one another,
[00:30:57.420 --> 00:30:59.860]   not, this isn't a hierarchical statement,
[00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:03.100]   but three or four top memory researchers in the world, right?
[00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:06.780]   Textbook material is Suzuki in the,
[00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:08.620]   my textbooks are filled with the word Suzuki,
[00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:09.820]   your last name,
[00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:14.820]   according to the information on memory and memory formation.
[00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:17.140]   So you were doing that
[00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:19.300]   and doing the things that academics do.
[00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:21.460]   And then you're still doing that,
[00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:24.500]   but still at a very high level,
[00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:26.180]   but then things took a different direction.
[00:31:26.180 --> 00:31:28.420]   And then maybe we could talk about your story
[00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:32.780]   and how you came to the place you are at now,
[00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:34.380]   because I think it provides a number of tools
[00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:36.780]   that people could implement themselves.
[00:31:36.780 --> 00:31:37.900]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:42.900]   So this story happened as I was working to get tenure at NYU.
[00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:48.420]   And as you know, it's a stress-filled process.
[00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:51.580]   They give you six years to, you know, show your stuff
[00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:53.860]   and you are judged in front of all your colleagues.
[00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:56.420]   And either they say, okay, you can join the club,
[00:31:56.420 --> 00:31:58.740]   or they say, sorry, you are, you know,
[00:31:58.740 --> 00:32:00.620]   humiliated in front of everybody.
[00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:01.460]   This was what was going on.
[00:32:01.460 --> 00:32:03.100]   - They actually tell people to leave.
[00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:03.940]   - Yeah.
[00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:04.780]   - If you don't get tenure, you're gone.
[00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:06.540]   - You have to leave your institution.
[00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:09.820]   And so, you know, you work really, really hard.
[00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:12.660]   And so my strategy was,
[00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:14.460]   I'm just gonna not do anything but work
[00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:15.620]   and I'm just gonna work.
[00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:19.260]   And I'm going to just work as hard as I can
[00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:20.460]   for the six years.
[00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:22.940]   And what happens when you work
[00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:26.220]   and you don't have any sort of life outside of work
[00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:27.900]   and you live in New York
[00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:30.260]   where there's all sorts of really good takeout,
[00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:32.540]   you gain 25 pounds, which is exactly what I did.
[00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:34.220]   And you get really, really stressed.
[00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:35.460]   And you start to ask yourself,
[00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:38.220]   how come I'm living in New York City and I love Broadway?
[00:32:38.220 --> 00:32:40.940]   And I've never, I haven't gone to a Broadway show
[00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:41.900]   in two years.
[00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:46.540]   And so I,
[00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:48.140]   25 pounds overweight.
[00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:52.020]   I decided to go on vacation
[00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:54.700]   and I went by myself 'cause I had no friends.
[00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:58.500]   And I went to, I did a adventure
[00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:02.660]   river rafting trip in Peru.
[00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:05.100]   And so I go by myself and, you know,
[00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:06.900]   meet other interesting people.
[00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:10.700]   And I was the weakest person on this whole trip.
[00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:15.700]   Like I was, there were so much in better shape,
[00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:17.100]   it was embarrassing.
[00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:19.460]   And they won't say this, they won't admit this to me,
[00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:20.460]   but it was true.
[00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:21.900]   And I kind of came back and I said,
[00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:25.020]   okay, I cannot be the weakest person.
[00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:27.580]   I'm in my late thirties, I have to do something.
[00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:30.220]   So I went to the gym and I said,
[00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:31.900]   oh my God, I'm 25 pounds overweight.
[00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:35.060]   Let's try at least to lose this weight.
[00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:37.100]   And so I go to the gym.
[00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:39.140]   I notice how much better I feel
[00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:40.740]   when I go to just a single class.
[00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:42.220]   I remember the very first class I went to
[00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:43.540]   was a hip hop dance class.
[00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:45.300]   I'm a terrible hip hop dancer,
[00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:48.700]   but I still felt good after that class.
[00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:52.220]   And then fast forward year and a half,
[00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:53.780]   I've lost the 25 pounds.
[00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:57.140]   So proud of myself, so much happier.
[00:33:57.140 --> 00:34:00.380]   And I'm sitting in my office doing what you and I do a lot,
[00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:04.100]   which is writing an NIH grant, which is our lifeblood, right?
[00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:06.420]   And writing, writing, writing,
[00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:08.300]   and this thought goes through my mind
[00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:10.540]   that had never gone through my mind before,
[00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:15.020]   which was during this six years of frantic grant writing
[00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:16.500]   when I was trying to get tenure.
[00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:20.540]   And that thought was grant writing went well today.
[00:34:20.540 --> 00:34:22.700]   You know, that felt good.
[00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:25.460]   I was like, I've never had that thought before.
[00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:26.460]   What's going on here?
[00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:27.740]   This is really weird.
[00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:29.980]   - I don't know that anyone has had that thought before.
[00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:32.020]   - No, I'm sure people have had that thought.
[00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:36.580]   But I thought maybe I'm just having a good day.
[00:34:36.580 --> 00:34:40.620]   But when I thought about it, I thought it's not just today.
[00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:44.820]   My grant writing seems to have been getting smoother.
[00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:47.380]   Like I'm able to focus longer.
[00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:50.500]   The sessions feel better to me.
[00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:53.860]   And at that point, the only thing that I changed my life,
[00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:54.700]   it was a huge thing,
[00:34:54.700 --> 00:34:59.060]   but I had become a gym rat rather than a workaholic.
[00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:04.060]   And that's when my spidey sense for neuroscientists
[00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:05.860]   popped up and I said,
[00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:08.860]   what do we know about the effects of exercise on your brain?
[00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:10.820]   Because if I think about it,
[00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:12.860]   what was better about my writing is
[00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:16.140]   I could focus longer and deeper, very important.
[00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:19.060]   And I could remember those little details
[00:35:19.060 --> 00:35:20.300]   that you try and pull together
[00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:22.660]   for your million dollar NIH grant
[00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:24.660]   from 30 different articles
[00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:27.220]   that you have open on your screen all at the same time.
[00:35:27.220 --> 00:35:29.020]   That's the hippocampal memory.
[00:35:29.020 --> 00:35:29.940]   I was studying that.
[00:35:29.940 --> 00:35:32.860]   I was writing the grants on hippocampal memory.
[00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:37.300]   And so that's when I got really interested
[00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:39.580]   in the effects of exercise
[00:35:39.580 --> 00:35:42.900]   on both prefrontal focus and attention function
[00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:44.380]   and hippocampal function,
[00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:46.940]   because of my own observation and this kind of,
[00:35:46.940 --> 00:35:48.860]   I still remember where I was sitting,
[00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:52.100]   which office I was in when I had this revelation.
[00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:53.940]   But the thing that really sealed it for me
[00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:56.380]   that made me think not just,
[00:35:56.380 --> 00:35:59.980]   oh, this is interesting, but I wanna study this,
[00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:02.940]   is right around that time,
[00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:04.660]   I got a phone call from my mom
[00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:09.020]   who said that my dad wasn't feeling well
[00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:13.340]   and that he had told her that he got lost
[00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:14.940]   driving back from the 7-Eleven,
[00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:17.900]   which is literally seven blocks from our house
[00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:19.500]   that I grew up in.
[00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:23.180]   And I knew that was hippocampal function.
[00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:24.900]   I suspected dementia.
[00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:27.220]   I suspected, though didn't wanna admit,
[00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:29.740]   Alzheimer's dementia, which he had.
[00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:33.100]   And it was funny because, I mean, it wasn't funny,
[00:36:33.100 --> 00:36:38.100]   but my mom and dad are two sides of a very different coin.
[00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:44.100]   My dad is the engineer, not so active all his life,
[00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:48.500]   but would love to sit and read books all day.
[00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:50.180]   My mom was the athlete.
[00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:54.220]   She played tennis, team tennis into her 80s.
[00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:58.660]   And it started to show at that point.
[00:36:58.660 --> 00:37:03.660]   And so then I had even a more pressing reason
[00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:07.740]   to think about what the effects of exercise were
[00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:10.140]   because I noticed that all the things
[00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:12.940]   that were improving in my brain suddenly went away.
[00:37:12.940 --> 00:37:15.660]   My dad's brain, really, really smart guy,
[00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:19.740]   engineer in Silicon Valley helped that push
[00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:22.300]   in Silicon Valley in the 70s happen.
[00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:24.500]   He had no more memory.
[00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:26.220]   He couldn't focus his attention.
[00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:28.580]   His mood was rock bottom.
[00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:30.700]   He's a very happy guy.
[00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:32.660]   And everything was the opposite in me.
[00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:35.140]   And I started thinking, this isn't just something
[00:37:35.140 --> 00:37:37.900]   to help somebody who wants to get tenure.
[00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:41.260]   This is something that could help
[00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:43.220]   millions and millions of people.
[00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:46.500]   Most importantly, our aging population.
[00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:48.900]   What if, what's happening?
[00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:52.620]   And so the thing that makes me wake up in the morning
[00:37:52.620 --> 00:37:57.620]   is when I realized that every single time you move your body
[00:37:57.620 --> 00:38:01.900]   you are releasing a whole bunch of neurochemicals.
[00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:03.660]   And some of them we've talked about
[00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:05.740]   that the good mood comes from dopamine
[00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:07.940]   and serotonin and noradrenaline.
[00:38:07.940 --> 00:38:09.660]   But the thing that gets released also,
[00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:13.100]   particularly with aerobic exercise is a growth factor
[00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:17.980]   called brain derived neurotrophic factor or BDNF.
[00:38:17.980 --> 00:38:20.460]   And that is so important because what it does
[00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:22.780]   is it goes directly to your hippocampus
[00:38:22.780 --> 00:38:26.900]   and it helps brand new brain cells grow in your hippocampus.
[00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:27.740]   We all have that.
[00:38:27.740 --> 00:38:28.740]   Even if you're a couch potato,
[00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:31.260]   you can get new brain cells in your hippocampus to grow.
[00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:35.220]   But it's like giving your hippocampus a boost
[00:38:35.220 --> 00:38:39.060]   with this regular BDNF if you are exercising,
[00:38:39.060 --> 00:38:41.940]   which means that we all have the capacity
[00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:46.100]   to grow a bigger, fatter, fluffier hippocampus.
[00:38:46.100 --> 00:38:49.500]   And so what I like to give people is this image
[00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:51.300]   of every single time you move your body
[00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:54.140]   it's like giving your brain this wonderful bubble bath
[00:38:54.140 --> 00:38:55.460]   of neurochemicals.
[00:38:55.460 --> 00:38:56.300]   What's going on?
[00:38:56.300 --> 00:38:59.460]   I need my bubble bath of noradrenaline and dopamine
[00:38:59.460 --> 00:39:02.260]   and serotonin and growth factors.
[00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:05.500]   And with regular bubble baths, what am I doing?
[00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:08.740]   I'm growing a big, fat, fluffy hippocampus.
[00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:12.180]   And I'm not gonna cure my father's dementia,
[00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:14.420]   Alzheimer's dementia, but you know what?
[00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:18.660]   If I go into my 70s with a big, fat, fluffy hippocampus,
[00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:22.620]   even if I have that in my genes and it starts to kick in,
[00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:24.740]   it's gonna take longer for that disease
[00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:27.500]   to start to affect my ability to form
[00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:29.860]   and retain new long-term memories for facts and events,
[00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:32.140]   which is my motivation for getting up
[00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:35.660]   and doing my 30 to 45 minutes of aerobic exercise every day.
[00:39:35.660 --> 00:39:36.500]   - Fantastic.
[00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:40.700]   Quick question about your protocol,
[00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:43.780]   just because, and then we'll discuss
[00:39:43.780 --> 00:39:46.700]   a few mechanistic things related to what signals
[00:39:46.700 --> 00:39:48.700]   the body might be sending the brain
[00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:53.700]   and a little bit more detail on BDNF and some circuitry.
[00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:59.500]   So 30 to 45 minutes, it sounds like cardiovascular exercise
[00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:01.860]   might be special. - Yes.
[00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:05.140]   - But as I say that, and I think about the literature
[00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:08.100]   that I'm aware of in mice and some in monkeys
[00:40:08.100 --> 00:40:11.600]   and certainly in humans, looking at the effects of exercise
[00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:13.900]   on brain function and typically the outcome
[00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:15.540]   is improvement, almost always.
[00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:16.940]   I don't think I've ever seen a paper showing
[00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:19.880]   that when animals or humans exercise more
[00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:22.100]   that their brain gets worse. - No.
[00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:24.020]   - I just can't think of a single paper.
[00:40:24.020 --> 00:40:25.300]   It doesn't mean it doesn't exist.
[00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:27.620]   I'm sure someone will put one in the comment section.
[00:40:27.620 --> 00:40:30.340]   They'll find that one and thank you for if you can find that.
[00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:34.380]   But it seems like it's always cardiovascular exercise
[00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:35.620]   and experimentally in a lab,
[00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:38.100]   it's a lot easier to get a mouse to run on a treadmill
[00:40:38.100 --> 00:40:39.540]   than it is to get a mouse to lift weights.
[00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:41.180]   Although people have put a little ankle weights
[00:40:41.180 --> 00:40:42.460]   on mice and done.
[00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:44.800]   And the ways of getting mice to do resistance work
[00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:46.220]   is actually a little bit barbaric
[00:40:46.220 --> 00:40:49.100]   because oftentimes they'll incapacitate a limb
[00:40:49.100 --> 00:40:50.500]   to overload another limb.
[00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:51.780]   So it's an asymmetric thing.
[00:40:51.780 --> 00:40:55.060]   It's not the same as sending them in to do squats
[00:40:55.060 --> 00:40:56.300]   or deadlifts or something.
[00:40:56.300 --> 00:41:00.220]   So, but cardiovascular exercise might be special.
[00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:01.420]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:41:01.420 --> 00:41:03.060]   - What are your thoughts on that?
[00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:06.380]   And please first though, tell us your routine.
[00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:08.920]   Your routine is 30 to 45 minutes of,
[00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:11.380]   are you a Peloton cycler?
[00:41:11.380 --> 00:41:12.420]   Does it matter?
[00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:16.420]   - I think that the data suggests that as long
[00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:19.660]   as your heart rate is getting up for these longterm effects
[00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:21.980]   on your hippocampus and prefrontal cortex,
[00:41:21.980 --> 00:41:26.900]   you also get better at shifting and focusing your attention.
[00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:30.000]   For that you need cardiovascular.
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.820]   And what I use is a video workout that I started
[00:41:32.820 --> 00:41:35.080]   even before the pandemic is called Daily Burn.
[00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:37.940]   And it's just thousands of different workouts.
[00:41:37.940 --> 00:41:42.340]   But I love, they are 30 minutes that I sometimes add on
[00:41:42.340 --> 00:41:46.060]   a 10 to 15 minute stretch at the beginning or at the end.
[00:41:46.060 --> 00:41:47.860]   But I love the variety.
[00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:49.060]   Sometimes I do it with weight.
[00:41:49.060 --> 00:41:51.380]   Sometimes I do it without weights.
[00:41:51.380 --> 00:41:52.340]   I love kickboxing.
[00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:54.180]   So they have a lot of kickboxing in there.
[00:41:54.180 --> 00:41:57.980]   It just fits my routine.
[00:41:57.980 --> 00:41:59.540]   And it's always there.
[00:41:59.540 --> 00:42:01.820]   And I don't have to get all dressed up
[00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:04.340]   to go to the gym to work out.
[00:42:04.340 --> 00:42:05.540]   So that's what I do.
[00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:07.820]   - And that's a daily thing, seven days a week.
[00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:09.400]   Seven days a week, fantastic.
[00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:13.220]   So in terms of the way that some of these changes
[00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:16.540]   are being conveyed from the body to the brain,
[00:42:16.540 --> 00:42:17.740]   that fascinates me, right?
[00:42:17.740 --> 00:42:18.940]   I mean, as you and I know,
[00:42:18.940 --> 00:42:22.340]   and I'm sort of a repeating record on the podcast,
[00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:24.340]   always saying, you got a brain,
[00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:25.460]   but you also have a spinal cord
[00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:27.100]   and then your nervous system connects everything.
[00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:30.060]   Every organ in your body is basically signaled
[00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:32.660]   to by the nervous system and back to the nervous system,
[00:42:32.660 --> 00:42:34.140]   your spleen, everything.
[00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:37.300]   But so let's imagine your morning routine,
[00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:39.580]   you do your cardiovascular exercise.
[00:42:39.580 --> 00:42:41.380]   Okay, so you're pumping more blood.
[00:42:41.380 --> 00:42:43.220]   That's the definition of a higher heart rate.
[00:42:43.220 --> 00:42:46.280]   Stroke volume of the heart goes up over time.
[00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:47.420]   You're getting fitter.
[00:42:47.420 --> 00:42:49.580]   So blood flow to the brain is increasing.
[00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:53.420]   Do we know how that gets translated to a signal
[00:42:53.420 --> 00:42:55.000]   to release more BDNF?
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:57.700]   And then it raises this other question,
[00:42:57.700 --> 00:42:59.780]   which is, does it matter where your mind is
[00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:01.380]   when you exercise?
[00:43:01.380 --> 00:43:03.700]   Because ultimately the brain, of course,
[00:43:03.700 --> 00:43:05.420]   you can anchor your attention to the exercise
[00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:07.740]   or you can be listening to a podcast or something else.
[00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:09.800]   I've always wondered about this.
[00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:11.440]   Can we enhance the effects of exercise
[00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:13.800]   by combining the enhanced blood flow
[00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:16.540]   with cognitive work during exercise?
[00:43:16.540 --> 00:43:18.580]   Or is it simply a matter of just getting more blood flow
[00:43:18.580 --> 00:43:19.860]   up to the hippocampus?
[00:43:19.860 --> 00:43:23.060]   - Yeah, I wish I had the answer to that question too.
[00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:26.720]   My instinct is yes, it matters,
[00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:29.080]   partially because of the work of your colleague,
[00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:33.660]   Alia Crum, on mindset and the power of that to change
[00:43:33.660 --> 00:43:37.400]   how physiologically our body is responding.
[00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:41.540]   So how could it not work in her experiments,
[00:43:41.540 --> 00:43:45.200]   or work in her experiments and not work for my morning
[00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:47.960]   or our morning exercise routine?
[00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:50.320]   So, but are there studies point to a study?
[00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:51.220]   I don't know of one.
[00:43:51.220 --> 00:43:55.420]   So exercise neuroscientists out there,
[00:43:55.420 --> 00:43:59.120]   I'd love to see that study done.
[00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:00.940]   So yes, it works.
[00:44:00.940 --> 00:44:03.940]   Before I go into the aerobic thing,
[00:44:03.940 --> 00:44:07.600]   I always like to start with the least amount of exercise
[00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:10.180]   to get something really useful,
[00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:12.000]   because I don't want people to say,
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.140]   "Oh God, I hate sweating.
[00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:16.060]   "I don't want to listen anymore."
[00:44:16.060 --> 00:44:20.400]   So I always like to start with studies have shown
[00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:24.720]   that just 10 minutes of walking outside can shift your mood.
[00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:26.980]   That is part of that neurochemical bubble bath
[00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:30.060]   that you're getting, dopamine, serotonin, noradrenaline.
[00:44:30.060 --> 00:44:33.380]   And 10 minutes, and anybody can walk for 10 minutes.
[00:44:33.380 --> 00:44:38.600]   And so that is, for all of you thinking that out there,
[00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:40.120]   what is the minimum that I could get
[00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:41.060]   some of these brain effects?
[00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:43.400]   10 minutes of walking, anybody can do it.
[00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:44.460]   - Is outside important?
[00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:47.460]   I'm a big believer in getting photons into the eyes.
[00:44:47.460 --> 00:44:53.500]   - I think that that study was done indoors on a treadmill.
[00:44:53.500 --> 00:44:56.040]   So, and the comparison wasn't done,
[00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:58.440]   but moving your, which is great.
[00:44:58.440 --> 00:45:00.540]   In the middle of the pandemic,
[00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:03.260]   I walked around my apartment for 30 minutes sometimes
[00:45:03.260 --> 00:45:05.600]   just for some variety.
[00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:09.480]   Felt like a rat on a running wheel, but yes.
[00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:14.480]   So that minimum amount of movement in your body
[00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:18.020]   can get you those mood effects.
[00:45:18.020 --> 00:45:21.660]   But what about the big fat fluffy hippocampus?
[00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:24.100]   What about the better performing prefrontal cortex?
[00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:29.100]   That's where you start to need the cardio workout.
[00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:31.640]   And from my reading of the literature,
[00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:33.740]   there haven't been enough studies, you know,
[00:45:33.740 --> 00:45:38.100]   directly comparing, contrasting, kickboxing with running,
[00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:42.100]   with whatever other cardio that you need to do.
[00:45:42.100 --> 00:45:44.880]   But any cardio workout that is done
[00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:46.240]   has these positive effects.
[00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:48.300]   So I'm gonna say, my interpretation of that
[00:45:48.300 --> 00:45:51.380]   is that whatever way you get your heart rate up,
[00:45:51.380 --> 00:45:53.420]   including a power walk,
[00:45:53.420 --> 00:45:55.340]   a power walk can get your heart rate up,
[00:45:55.340 --> 00:45:57.300]   that is beneficial.
[00:45:57.300 --> 00:45:59.940]   And what is happening, there are two pathways
[00:45:59.940 --> 00:46:02.460]   that have been studied about how you go
[00:46:02.460 --> 00:46:05.340]   from moving your body to more BDNF,
[00:46:05.340 --> 00:46:09.540]   that neurotrophin that's increasing the growth
[00:46:09.540 --> 00:46:11.340]   of new hippocampal brain cells.
[00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:12.820]   The two pathways are the following.
[00:46:12.820 --> 00:46:16.540]   One is a myokine, which is a protein released
[00:46:16.540 --> 00:46:18.960]   by the muscles, and not your heart.
[00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:21.740]   These are striated muscles in your body.
[00:46:21.740 --> 00:46:25.480]   And so by running, these were studies done in rats
[00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:26.880]   on running wheels.
[00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:29.020]   They showed that the running rats
[00:46:29.020 --> 00:46:32.340]   had more of this myokine released,
[00:46:32.340 --> 00:46:34.880]   the myokine passed the blood-brain barrier,
[00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:39.620]   so got into the rarefied, very protected bloodstream
[00:46:39.620 --> 00:46:41.480]   of inside the brain.
[00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:44.600]   And that myokine stimulated the release
[00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:47.120]   of BDNF in the brain.
[00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:48.680]   That's pathway number one.
[00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:52.060]   Pathway number two comes through the liver
[00:46:52.060 --> 00:46:56.400]   because exercise is a stress generally.
[00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:57.240]   How do we know that?
[00:46:57.240 --> 00:46:59.980]   Well, cortisol is released whenever we exercise.
[00:46:59.980 --> 00:47:03.700]   We need that sugar in our blood,
[00:47:03.700 --> 00:47:07.840]   and so that's how the physiological mechanisms work.
[00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:12.840]   And so there is a ketone, beta-hydroxybutyrate,
[00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:15.940]   that we've known for a very long time
[00:47:15.940 --> 00:47:19.300]   that gets released by the liver during exercise.
[00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:22.680]   And we also know that that particular ketone
[00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:24.260]   passes that blood-brain barrier,
[00:47:24.260 --> 00:47:26.160]   and it's another stimulant for BDNF.
[00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:29.940]   So kind of the final common pathway seems to be
[00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:34.200]   BDNF stimulation in the hippocampus.
[00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:35.800]   Is it the only one?
[00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:37.280]   Probably not, but that's the one
[00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:39.420]   that has been studied most clearly.
[00:47:39.420 --> 00:47:42.880]   So it comes from all of our physiological systems,
[00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:46.000]   our muscles working, our liver responding
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:49.500]   to the stress of exercise, and what is it doing?
[00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:54.500]   It is giving more BDNF precursors to get into our brain
[00:47:54.500 --> 00:47:59.060]   to cause the up-spike of BDNF,
[00:47:59.060 --> 00:48:00.340]   which is part of your bubble bath
[00:48:00.340 --> 00:48:02.160]   that you're getting every time you move.
[00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:05.160]   - I love that description of a factor from muscle
[00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:06.160]   and a factor from liver,
[00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:09.920]   because anytime we're thinking about movement of the body
[00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:12.320]   and translating that to the brain,
[00:48:12.320 --> 00:48:14.520]   as you so clearly pointed out,
[00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:17.660]   that needs to be, it needs to traverse
[00:48:17.660 --> 00:48:18.680]   the blood-brain barrier.
[00:48:18.680 --> 00:48:20.200]   Not everything that happens in the body
[00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:21.920]   is communicated to the brain,
[00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:25.000]   and these seem like really important signals.
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:28.680]   Beta-hydroxybutyrate, you mentioned, is a ketone.
[00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:31.340]   I just want to underscore, that doesn't mean, folks,
[00:48:31.340 --> 00:48:33.380]   that you need to be on a ketogenic diet.
[00:48:33.380 --> 00:48:35.840]   I think people hear ketone and they think,
[00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:38.920]   I know some people are, most people are not, I imagine.
[00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:42.280]   There are ketones that are released in your brain and body
[00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:45.620]   that can function even if you're ingesting carbohydrates
[00:48:45.620 --> 00:48:48.600]   and not ketogenic, just for a point of clarification.
[00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:53.920]   This issue of new neurons is one that you hear a lot.
[00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:56.560]   Neurogenesis, you're going to grow new neurons, new neurons.
[00:48:56.560 --> 00:49:00.020]   And my understanding is that the rodent literature
[00:49:00.020 --> 00:49:04.160]   is very clear, that animals that run on wheels more often,
[00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:05.840]   it turns out rodents love to run on wheels.
[00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:07.600]   Do you know these studies by Hoppe Hofster,
[00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:08.880]   which are pretty funny?
[00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:10.840]   They're very cool, by the way, Hoppe,
[00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:14.380]   how a huge investigator, I'm not making light of them.
[00:49:14.380 --> 00:49:17.400]   They put running wheels in a field
[00:49:17.400 --> 00:49:20.800]   and wild rodents will run to the running wheel
[00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:22.440]   and run on that running wheel.
[00:49:22.440 --> 00:49:25.640]   So they really enjoy it, which I find amusing
[00:49:25.640 --> 00:49:26.920]   for reasons that probably only
[00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:29.440]   a neuroscientist would find amusing.
[00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:33.640]   In any case, in rodents, it seems that running more
[00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:36.640]   on a wheel can trigger neurogenesis,
[00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:39.280]   literally the birth of new neurons
[00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:41.960]   and the addition of new neurons to the hippocampus.
[00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:44.740]   In monkeys, this has been controversial.
[00:49:44.740 --> 00:49:46.640]   It seems it does happen in the hippocampus
[00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:49.920]   and in the olfactory bulb, probably not in the neocortex,
[00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:52.840]   thinking back to the decades or more controversy
[00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:55.040]   between Liz Gould and Pashko Rakesh.
[00:49:55.040 --> 00:49:57.560]   I hope they settled their differences there.
[00:49:57.560 --> 00:50:01.460]   Neuroscientists love to argue, it's what we do.
[00:50:01.460 --> 00:50:05.920]   And in humans, I think it's been a bit controversial.
[00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:07.920]   Some people say absolutely yes,
[00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:09.280]   other people say absolutely no,
[00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:12.020]   there are new neurons added to the adult brain.
[00:50:12.020 --> 00:50:17.040]   I haven't followed that literature down to the detail,
[00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:21.200]   but I do remember one study that I don't think is contested,
[00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:24.380]   which is the work of Rusty Gage at the Salk Institute,
[00:50:24.380 --> 00:50:28.800]   where they actually injected a sort of dye type marker
[00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:31.720]   into the brains of terminally ill humans
[00:50:31.720 --> 00:50:34.920]   who very graciously offered to have their brains removed
[00:50:34.920 --> 00:50:36.880]   and dissected after death.
[00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:40.880]   And in these, in some cases, very old,
[00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:43.280]   terminally ill humans, they did see evidence
[00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:46.600]   for new neurons being born in the hippocampus.
[00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:48.780]   Can I trust that idea still?
[00:50:48.780 --> 00:50:50.480]   Is that generally accepted?
[00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:54.860]   Well, so after that study, which was quite a while ago,
[00:50:54.860 --> 00:50:58.020]   there are more recent studies, still controversial,
[00:50:58.020 --> 00:51:01.860]   but showing and demonstrating using even new
[00:51:01.860 --> 00:51:03.600]   and better techniques than were used
[00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:05.500]   in that original Rusty Gage study,
[00:51:05.500 --> 00:51:07.720]   which was groundbreaking at the time,
[00:51:07.720 --> 00:51:11.780]   that suggest and I think show
[00:51:11.780 --> 00:51:16.780]   that there are new neurons born in adult human brains
[00:51:16.780 --> 00:51:19.540]   into the ninth decade of life.
[00:51:19.540 --> 00:51:21.100]   So they not only did this,
[00:51:21.100 --> 00:51:23.380]   I think those patients were in their 60s,
[00:51:23.380 --> 00:51:25.480]   then they died of cancer,
[00:51:25.480 --> 00:51:30.140]   but these new studies looking across the timeline,
[00:51:30.140 --> 00:51:31.980]   can we see, because the other thing was,
[00:51:31.980 --> 00:51:34.220]   yeah, maybe you have some when you're 20,
[00:51:34.220 --> 00:51:35.860]   but by the time you're older
[00:51:35.860 --> 00:51:37.940]   and you might need these new neurons,
[00:51:37.940 --> 00:51:39.900]   you have no new neuron growth.
[00:51:39.900 --> 00:51:44.700]   And so these studies seem to suggest that yes, yes, you did.
[00:51:44.700 --> 00:51:48.460]   Yes, you do, and we all do, even into old age.
[00:51:48.460 --> 00:51:49.860]   So yeah. - Great.
[00:51:49.860 --> 00:51:51.500]   And I'll just take a moment to say
[00:51:51.500 --> 00:51:53.980]   that I am personally not aware of any studies
[00:51:53.980 --> 00:51:57.060]   looking at other forms of exercise
[00:51:57.060 --> 00:52:00.300]   besides cardiovascular exercise for sake of brain health.
[00:52:00.300 --> 00:52:03.100]   And this I think is an important gap in the literature
[00:52:03.100 --> 00:52:05.420]   that ought to be filled, whether or not, for instance,
[00:52:05.420 --> 00:52:07.340]   high intensity interval training,
[00:52:07.340 --> 00:52:09.640]   or whether or not weight training,
[00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:12.700]   which has other effects on the musculature.
[00:52:12.700 --> 00:52:15.500]   So you can imagine perhaps the myokine to BDNF pathway,
[00:52:15.500 --> 00:52:17.500]   the pathway one that you mentioned might be signaled,
[00:52:17.500 --> 00:52:19.020]   but maybe not the liver pathway.
[00:52:19.020 --> 00:52:20.900]   Maybe, yes, I'm speculating here.
[00:52:20.900 --> 00:52:22.140]   Those studies need to be done.
[00:52:22.140 --> 00:52:25.140]   To my knowledge, they just haven't been done yet,
[00:52:25.140 --> 00:52:26.340]   but they should be done.
[00:52:26.340 --> 00:52:28.700]   If you would, could you tell us about
[00:52:28.700 --> 00:52:33.700]   some of the more specific effects of exercise on memory?
[00:52:33.700 --> 00:52:36.540]   You know, when memory is a broad category
[00:52:36.540 --> 00:52:38.740]   of effects and phenomena.
[00:52:38.740 --> 00:52:41.500]   So things like, what comes to mind is short-term,
[00:52:41.500 --> 00:52:43.980]   medium and long-term memory, reaction time.
[00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:48.060]   Learning math, at least for me, is quite a bit different
[00:52:48.060 --> 00:52:51.020]   than learning history.
[00:52:51.020 --> 00:52:52.500]   Although there's certainly overlap
[00:52:52.500 --> 00:52:54.740]   in the neural underpinnings.
[00:52:54.740 --> 00:52:57.500]   What has been demonstrated in the laboratory
[00:52:57.500 --> 00:53:00.220]   in animal models, but especially in humans?
[00:53:00.220 --> 00:53:02.560]   And if you want to share with us any results
[00:53:02.560 --> 00:53:05.220]   from your lab, published or unpublished,
[00:53:05.220 --> 00:53:06.760]   I'm sure that the audience would be delighted
[00:53:06.760 --> 00:53:07.660]   to learn about them.
[00:53:07.660 --> 00:53:08.500]   - Absolutely.
[00:53:08.500 --> 00:53:11.560]   Let me start with kind of the immediate effects,
[00:53:11.560 --> 00:53:14.980]   acute effects as they're called, of exercise on the brain.
[00:53:14.980 --> 00:53:19.540]   So this is asking, what does a one-off exercise session do
[00:53:19.540 --> 00:53:20.880]   for your brain?
[00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:25.520]   And there, there are three major effects
[00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:26.820]   that have been reproduced.
[00:53:26.820 --> 00:53:30.020]   I've seen it in my lab, many labs have reproduced this.
[00:53:30.020 --> 00:53:32.080]   So what do you get with a one-off?
[00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:35.640]   This is usually an aerobic type exercise session,
[00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:37.500]   30, 30 to 45 minutes.
[00:53:37.500 --> 00:53:41.300]   What you get is that mood boost, very, very consistent.
[00:53:41.300 --> 00:53:46.100]   You get improved prefrontal function,
[00:53:46.100 --> 00:53:49.380]   typically tested with a Stroop test,
[00:53:49.380 --> 00:53:51.800]   which is a test that asks you to shift
[00:53:51.800 --> 00:53:54.740]   and focus your attention in specific ways.
[00:53:54.740 --> 00:53:57.100]   It's a challenging task and clearly dependent
[00:53:57.100 --> 00:53:59.500]   on the prefrontal cortex, largely.
[00:53:59.500 --> 00:54:03.060]   And significant improvements in reaction time.
[00:54:03.060 --> 00:54:07.700]   So your speed at responding, often a motor kind of,
[00:54:07.700 --> 00:54:11.940]   but cognitive motor response is improved.
[00:54:11.940 --> 00:54:15.180]   Over the pandemic, one of the unpublished studies that I did
[00:54:15.180 --> 00:54:18.140]   looking at the effects of 30 minutes
[00:54:18.140 --> 00:54:23.140]   of age-appropriate workout in subjects ranging in age
[00:54:23.140 --> 00:54:27.140]   from their 20s all the way up to their 90s.
[00:54:27.140 --> 00:54:31.880]   So what are the things that I saw most consistently?
[00:54:31.880 --> 00:54:36.880]   Irrespective of your age, everybody got a decreased anxiety
[00:54:37.060 --> 00:54:40.020]   and depression and a hostility score,
[00:54:40.020 --> 00:54:41.780]   which is very important.
[00:54:41.780 --> 00:54:44.740]   So it's not just decreasing your anxiety and depression,
[00:54:44.740 --> 00:54:47.080]   but decreasing your hostility levels.
[00:54:47.080 --> 00:54:48.260]   - Making the world a better place.
[00:54:48.260 --> 00:54:50.500]   - Making the world a better place.
[00:54:50.500 --> 00:54:54.460]   Energy, the feeling of energy went up.
[00:54:54.460 --> 00:54:58.400]   And what we found is in the older population,
[00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:00.860]   even more than in the younger population,
[00:55:00.860 --> 00:55:04.280]   we saw improved performance on both Stroop
[00:55:04.280 --> 00:55:08.200]   and Erickson-Flanker task, which is another task
[00:55:08.200 --> 00:55:12.540]   dependent on really focusing in on different letters
[00:55:12.540 --> 00:55:15.440]   and paying attention to what letter is being shown.
[00:55:15.440 --> 00:55:19.020]   So these are consistent effects.
[00:55:19.020 --> 00:55:20.120]   How long do they last?
[00:55:20.120 --> 00:55:21.880]   One of the studies that I did publish in my lab
[00:55:21.880 --> 00:55:24.740]   showed that the immediate effects of exercise
[00:55:24.740 --> 00:55:27.520]   lasted up to two hours.
[00:55:27.520 --> 00:55:29.240]   Unfortunately, that was the longest that we last.
[00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:31.800]   They were still there at two hours.
[00:55:31.800 --> 00:55:35.820]   So that's a pretty big bang for your buck.
[00:55:35.820 --> 00:55:37.440]   - That is. - One 30 minute.
[00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:38.280]   - Sorry to interrupt. - Yeah, yeah.
[00:55:38.280 --> 00:55:39.460]   - I just want to make sure I understand.
[00:55:39.460 --> 00:55:42.360]   So when you say the effects lasted up to two hours,
[00:55:42.360 --> 00:55:45.820]   does that mean up to two hours after you finished exercise
[00:55:45.820 --> 00:55:49.980]   or up to two hours of memory challenging work?
[00:55:49.980 --> 00:55:54.580]   - Ah. - Yeah, just to be clear.
[00:55:54.580 --> 00:55:55.800]   - Yeah, that's a great question.
[00:55:55.800 --> 00:56:00.800]   So my study looked at two hours after exercise,
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:03.440]   two hours after you finish your workout,
[00:56:03.440 --> 00:56:05.040]   we gave you these cognitive tests.
[00:56:05.040 --> 00:56:07.120]   During that two hour period,
[00:56:07.120 --> 00:56:10.040]   you were free to do anything except exercise or eat.
[00:56:10.040 --> 00:56:14.540]   And so there was no extra load on people.
[00:56:14.540 --> 00:56:17.680]   But two hours later, you did do significantly better
[00:56:17.680 --> 00:56:20.160]   on these focused attention tasks
[00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:24.920]   compared to a group that watched videos
[00:56:24.920 --> 00:56:26.560]   for the exercise period.
[00:56:26.560 --> 00:56:29.720]   This was an hour of cycling that they did.
[00:56:29.720 --> 00:56:31.920]   These were young subjects in their 20s.
[00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:36.920]   - Okay, so if I finish my exercise at 9 a.m.,
[00:56:36.920 --> 00:56:39.480]   even if I start this cognitive work,
[00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:42.680]   this mental work at 11, I'll still see benefits.
[00:56:42.680 --> 00:56:44.400]   - Yes, at least by 11,
[00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:47.420]   because I didn't go farther than two hours.
[00:56:47.420 --> 00:56:49.440]   So it could last even longer than that.
[00:56:49.440 --> 00:56:51.960]   But I have evidence that it lasts for two hours.
[00:56:51.960 --> 00:56:54.680]   - And perhaps if I had started the cognitive work
[00:56:54.680 --> 00:56:57.360]   and 45 minutes after my exercise ended,
[00:56:57.360 --> 00:56:58.840]   it would also be helpful?
[00:56:58.840 --> 00:56:59.680]   - Yes.
[00:56:59.680 --> 00:57:01.560]   - So there's no reason to think that you have to wait
[00:57:01.560 --> 00:57:02.680]   before starting cognitive work.
[00:57:02.680 --> 00:57:03.620]   - Yeah, no reason at all.
[00:57:03.620 --> 00:57:05.560]   - I'm asking questions of the sort that I get
[00:57:05.560 --> 00:57:07.160]   in the comments that we are going to get
[00:57:07.160 --> 00:57:08.000]   in the comments section.
[00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:10.200]   We always strive for clarity here.
[00:57:10.200 --> 00:57:14.560]   So what this tells me is that exercising early in the day
[00:57:14.560 --> 00:57:17.040]   may have a special effect.
[00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:18.000]   - Right.
[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:20.080]   - I realize that some people cannot exercise
[00:57:20.080 --> 00:57:21.760]   until later in the evening.
[00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:23.740]   But you mentioned something earlier
[00:57:23.740 --> 00:57:25.000]   that I want to cue people to.
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:26.040]   It's very, very important.
[00:57:26.040 --> 00:57:27.800]   I don't think I've ever mentioned this on the podcast,
[00:57:27.800 --> 00:57:30.720]   which is any kind of physical activity
[00:57:30.720 --> 00:57:34.000]   will increase cortisol to varying degrees.
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:35.540]   And so sometimes it's a healthy increase.
[00:57:35.540 --> 00:57:36.920]   Sometimes it's an unhealthy increase
[00:57:36.920 --> 00:57:39.060]   if you do two hours of really intense exercise
[00:57:39.060 --> 00:57:40.520]   and you're not prepared for it.
[00:57:40.520 --> 00:57:42.040]   That's a big spike in cortisol,
[00:57:42.040 --> 00:57:45.120]   probably not a good thing for most people.
[00:57:45.120 --> 00:57:47.580]   But if you are going to do your cardiovascular
[00:57:47.580 --> 00:57:50.120]   or weight training later in the day,
[00:57:50.120 --> 00:57:53.300]   that increase in cortisol can promote too much wakefulness
[00:57:53.300 --> 00:57:54.640]   for sleep, et cetera.
[00:57:54.640 --> 00:57:57.480]   Shifting that cortisol spike early in the day
[00:57:57.480 --> 00:57:59.200]   is associated with a number of important things
[00:57:59.200 --> 00:58:02.000]   related to mood, et cetera.
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:05.080]   But more and more what I'm thinking and hearing
[00:58:05.080 --> 00:58:07.080]   is that exercise early in the day is key.
[00:58:07.080 --> 00:58:09.720]   Our former Dean of the Medical School, Phil Pizzo,
[00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:14.080]   was and is kind of famous still for jogging
[00:58:14.080 --> 00:58:16.240]   between the hours of like four and five a.m.
[00:58:16.240 --> 00:58:19.080]   or five and six, and then running the medical school.
[00:58:19.080 --> 00:58:22.060]   So, and you're up early doing your exercise
[00:58:22.060 --> 00:58:23.680]   and cold shower and meditation.
[00:58:23.680 --> 00:58:25.060]   We'll talk about meditation.
[00:58:25.060 --> 00:58:28.260]   But this is more and more of a push, I feel like,
[00:58:28.260 --> 00:58:32.260]   or a stimulus for us to think about moving our exercise
[00:58:32.260 --> 00:58:33.260]   earlier in the day.
[00:58:33.260 --> 00:58:35.860]   - Yeah, I mean, I like to say that,
[00:58:35.860 --> 00:58:39.620]   I know there are moms and dads out there
[00:58:39.620 --> 00:58:41.780]   and they just say, "Look, I have a kid.
[00:58:41.780 --> 00:58:44.420]   "The kid's more important than my doing my exercise."
[00:58:44.420 --> 00:58:49.420]   So you will get benefits if you do it whenever you can.
[00:58:49.420 --> 00:58:52.040]   So that's great, more power to you.
[00:58:52.040 --> 00:58:55.160]   But what all the neuroscience data suggests
[00:58:55.160 --> 00:58:58.320]   is the best time to do your exercise
[00:58:58.320 --> 00:59:01.120]   is right before you need to use your brain
[00:59:01.120 --> 00:59:04.360]   in the most important way that you need to use it every day.
[00:59:04.360 --> 00:59:07.960]   And so that is why the morning, for most of us,
[00:59:07.960 --> 00:59:08.800]   is beneficial.
[00:59:08.800 --> 00:59:09.980]   That's why I do it in the morning.
[00:59:09.980 --> 00:59:12.840]   I'm lucky enough to be able to do that.
[00:59:12.840 --> 00:59:16.120]   But yeah, it makes sense with all,
[00:59:16.120 --> 00:59:18.360]   everything we know about how this works
[00:59:18.360 --> 00:59:20.140]   and how it benefits our brain.
[00:59:20.140 --> 00:59:23.900]   - I think about our colleague, Eric Kandel,
[00:59:23.900 --> 00:59:27.520]   who not incidentally has a Nobel Prize in studies memory.
[00:59:27.520 --> 00:59:32.140]   And rumor has it that he's been a swimmer
[00:59:32.140 --> 00:59:33.760]   for a lot of years that he'll put in,
[00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:36.780]   I think nowadays he's in his 90s now,
[00:59:36.780 --> 00:59:38.300]   he'll put in half a mile,
[00:59:38.300 --> 00:59:41.020]   but he used to swim a mile a day or something of that sort.
[00:59:41.020 --> 00:59:42.860]   - I heard that too, that he was a swimmer
[00:59:42.860 --> 00:59:44.820]   and he does it very, very religiously.
[00:59:44.820 --> 00:59:46.700]   - Okay, so there are a few other neuroscientists
[00:59:46.700 --> 00:59:47.540]   that do that.
[00:59:47.540 --> 00:59:48.540]   I can think of a lot of neuroscientists
[00:59:48.540 --> 00:59:49.980]   that probably should exercise more.
[00:59:49.980 --> 00:59:51.300]   And I don't say that to poke at them.
[00:59:51.300 --> 00:59:53.700]   I just would love to see them doing their incredible work
[00:59:53.700 --> 00:59:55.060]   for many more decades.
[00:59:55.060 --> 00:59:56.300]   And everything that we're talking about today
[00:59:56.300 --> 00:59:58.180]   indicates that if one doesn't,
[00:59:58.180 --> 01:00:02.240]   unless you have incredible genetics,
[01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:05.060]   we all experience age-related dementia, right?
[01:00:05.060 --> 01:00:09.300]   I mean, the story of your father is a salient one.
[01:00:09.300 --> 01:00:11.820]   And we should remember that as we go forward.
[01:00:11.820 --> 01:00:13.660]   But I also want to emphasize,
[01:00:13.660 --> 01:00:14.980]   I'd love to get your thoughts on
[01:00:14.980 --> 01:00:17.780]   just memory and memory loss in general.
[01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:20.620]   It seems we all get worse at remembering
[01:00:20.620 --> 01:00:24.500]   and learning things, even if we don't get Alzheimer's.
[01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:27.560]   When does that typically start for humans?
[01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:30.560]   - You know, I think there's so much variability,
[01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:34.600]   not only because we are individuals,
[01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:39.280]   but because our stress levels are different.
[01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:42.540]   And well, everybody's anxiety level has gone up
[01:00:42.540 --> 01:00:44.900]   in the last couple of years,
[01:00:44.900 --> 01:00:46.820]   but that also has an effect.
[01:00:46.820 --> 01:00:50.300]   We don't remember as much in a highly stressful,
[01:00:50.300 --> 01:00:52.380]   highly anxious situation.
[01:00:52.380 --> 01:00:56.080]   So, as you know, it's hard to answer that question.
[01:00:56.080 --> 01:00:56.920]   People say, okay,
[01:00:56.920 --> 01:00:58.780]   just tell me how much exercise I have to do.
[01:00:58.780 --> 01:01:00.740]   Okay, just do it. - 30 to 40 miles a day.
[01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:03.380]   But I love that per day.
[01:01:03.380 --> 01:01:05.420]   I've been doing this whole thing of telling people,
[01:01:05.420 --> 01:01:09.420]   oh, the data say 150 to 200 minutes of zone two cardio,
[01:01:09.420 --> 01:01:12.900]   which is kind of moderately hard, but not excessively hard.
[01:01:12.900 --> 01:01:16.060]   But I love this everyday theme
[01:01:16.060 --> 01:01:18.460]   because whenever I do that, the questions that come back are,
[01:01:18.460 --> 01:01:20.540]   well, what if I take a long hike on the weekends?
[01:01:20.540 --> 01:01:22.080]   And so people start negotiating.
[01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:23.300]   There's something that's very powerful
[01:01:23.300 --> 01:01:25.340]   about non-negotiable every day.
[01:01:25.340 --> 01:01:27.540]   Sun in your eyes every day, even through cloud cover.
[01:01:27.540 --> 01:01:29.660]   Exercise for 30 to 45 minutes.
[01:01:29.660 --> 01:01:31.900]   Cold shower every day. - Every day, yeah.
[01:01:31.900 --> 01:01:36.020]   - My understanding of the literature
[01:01:36.020 --> 01:01:38.820]   is that somewhere in our fifties or sixties,
[01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:41.660]   we start noticing little hiccups in memory.
[01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:46.300]   For some people younger, for some people later.
[01:01:46.300 --> 01:01:49.900]   But I have to imagine that doing the exercise
[01:01:49.900 --> 01:01:51.340]   throughout one's entire life
[01:01:51.340 --> 01:01:53.220]   is going to help offset some of this
[01:01:53.220 --> 01:01:56.580]   simply because of the BDNF and other downstream effects.
[01:01:56.580 --> 01:01:59.740]   - Yeah, yeah, I mean, that's what it suggests.
[01:01:59.740 --> 01:02:01.300]   One of my favorite studies,
[01:02:01.300 --> 01:02:03.740]   and then I want to get back to you wanted,
[01:02:03.740 --> 01:02:06.700]   you invited me to share some of my unpublished data
[01:02:06.700 --> 01:02:08.900]   on the effects of long-term exercise.
[01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:11.580]   But first I want to share one of my favorite studies,
[01:02:11.580 --> 01:02:16.500]   which is a longitudinal study done in Swedish women.
[01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:18.920]   And this was published in 2018.
[01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:22.740]   And what they did was back in the 1960s,
[01:02:22.740 --> 01:02:27.740]   they found Swedish women, 300 Swedish women in their forties.
[01:02:27.740 --> 01:02:32.140]   And they characterized them as low fit, mid fit, high fit.
[01:02:32.140 --> 01:02:33.540]   And then 40 years later,
[01:02:33.540 --> 01:02:34.860]   they came back and found these women.
[01:02:34.860 --> 01:02:36.860]   They let them live their lives.
[01:02:36.860 --> 01:02:39.560]   And they asked what happened to these women
[01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:42.340]   as a function of whether they were low fit, mid fit,
[01:02:42.340 --> 01:02:44.660]   high fit in their forties.
[01:02:44.660 --> 01:02:46.180]   They're now in their eighties.
[01:02:46.180 --> 01:02:51.180]   And what they found was that relative to the low fit
[01:02:51.180 --> 01:02:55.980]   or mid fit women, the women that were high fit
[01:02:55.980 --> 01:03:00.980]   gained nine more years of good cognition later in life.
[01:03:00.980 --> 01:03:06.240]   Now, this is not a randomized control study.
[01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:08.460]   This is a correlational study.
[01:03:08.460 --> 01:03:10.300]   But does it agree with everything
[01:03:10.300 --> 01:03:12.640]   that we've been talking about today?
[01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:13.480]   Yes.
[01:03:13.480 --> 01:03:15.280]   Does it agree with this idea that, you know,
[01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:17.380]   the women that were high fit were giving their brains
[01:03:17.380 --> 01:03:21.380]   this bubble bath, you know, maybe not every day,
[01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:24.480]   but very, very regularly for that entire 40 years.
[01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:28.040]   And that built up their big, fat, beautiful hippocampi.
[01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:29.040]   Yes, it does.
[01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:31.220]   So that's one of my favorite studies.
[01:03:31.220 --> 01:03:32.060]   - Yeah.
[01:03:32.060 --> 01:03:37.060]   Another cause for getting the exercise in consistently.
[01:03:37.060 --> 01:03:38.320]   - Yes.
[01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:42.140]   - I am impressed by this 10 minute walk
[01:03:42.140 --> 01:03:45.740]   and the improvements in mood from just a 10 minute walk.
[01:03:45.740 --> 01:03:49.480]   But again, I think that daily repetition,
[01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:54.480]   also I have to imagine has effects on the very pathways
[01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:56.060]   that allow plasticity.
[01:03:56.060 --> 01:03:58.660]   This is something we, in the realm of neuroplasticity,
[01:03:58.660 --> 01:04:00.540]   we don't often hear about or think about,
[01:04:00.540 --> 01:04:02.940]   even as neuroscientists, which is that the pathways
[01:04:02.940 --> 01:04:05.580]   for engaging plasticity probably can be,
[01:04:05.580 --> 01:04:09.080]   probably I'm speculating here, can be made better
[01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:11.120]   by engaging in the sorts of behavior
[01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:12.440]   that stimulate plasticity.
[01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:14.260]   In other words, if one gets better at calming themselves
[01:04:14.260 --> 01:04:17.840]   down under stress, those circuits get better at doing that.
[01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:18.680]   - Yes, absolutely.
[01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:20.320]   - Neural circuits gain proficiency.
[01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:21.160]   - Yeah.
[01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:23.560]   - And so because blood vessels can grow,
[01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:25.400]   capillaries can grow in the brain,
[01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:29.280]   you can imagine that more pumping of blood to the brain,
[01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:33.540]   delivery of these various muscle and liver factors
[01:04:33.540 --> 01:04:37.960]   would also establish larger or more efficient portals
[01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:39.500]   to getting that stuff there.
[01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:42.600]   So you could imagine a kind of an amplifying effect
[01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:43.440]   of exercise.
[01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:44.380]   And again, I'm speculating here,
[01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:47.340]   but I've seen this over and over again in colleagues,
[01:04:47.340 --> 01:04:50.340]   the ones who exercise consistently
[01:04:50.340 --> 01:04:53.360]   seem to be really, really smart and doing amazing work
[01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:55.180]   well into their 80s and 90s.
[01:04:55.180 --> 01:04:57.820]   And the ones who aren't, some of whom actually
[01:04:57.820 --> 01:05:01.460]   pride themselves on how little they exercise,
[01:05:01.460 --> 01:05:03.120]   they get worse over time.
[01:05:03.120 --> 01:05:05.360]   You see them each meeting each decade
[01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:06.680]   and I'm not poking fun at them at all.
[01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:08.920]   It's actually quite hard to see.
[01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:10.320]   And they're kind of a fading light.
[01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:12.260]   They're starting to flicker.
[01:05:12.260 --> 01:05:13.920]   So there is this incredible relationship
[01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:16.940]   between body vitality and brain vitality.
[01:05:16.940 --> 01:05:18.620]   That is, of course, is not an excuse
[01:05:18.620 --> 01:05:20.640]   for spending all day in the gym, right?
[01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:24.280]   The gym rats, I enjoy working out,
[01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:25.560]   so I could imagine doing that.
[01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:28.800]   But that doesn't make us smarter, unfortunately.
[01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:31.400]   You actually have to do the cognitive work also, right?
[01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:32.600]   It's not just exercise.
[01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:33.440]   - Right, right.
[01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:34.480]   - So I'd love to hear about some of these
[01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:35.880]   new unpublished data.
[01:05:35.880 --> 01:05:37.120]   - Yeah, yeah, okay.
[01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:40.880]   So when I jumped into the exercise work,
[01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:44.880]   everybody was studying people 65 or older
[01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:47.440]   because that's when cognitive decline begins.
[01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:49.840]   And if the idea is exercise can help you
[01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:52.360]   with your cognition, then it makes sense.
[01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:56.760]   However, I thought, well, you know, it's great.
[01:05:56.760 --> 01:05:58.800]   There's lots of work there.
[01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:02.480]   I wanted to know what happens in people in their 40s
[01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:06.400]   and their 50s, maybe even their 30s and their 20s.
[01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:10.680]   Why, because that's when we as humans are able,
[01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:14.200]   ready, willing, and able to increase our exercise
[01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:18.560]   and gets us set up to build our brains
[01:06:18.560 --> 01:06:20.560]   as we go into our 60s.
[01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:23.480]   And so the first study that I did
[01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:27.280]   looked at low-fit participants
[01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:30.720]   from their 30s to mid-50s.
[01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:34.200]   And we wanted to ask this question, you know,
[01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:35.760]   how much exercise do you really need
[01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:37.120]   to start seeing benefits?
[01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:37.960]   Do you see benefits?
[01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:39.360]   Or maybe you have to wait
[01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:42.200]   until you start seeing cognitive decline to get benefits.
[01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:44.520]   That was one of the theories out there.
[01:06:44.520 --> 01:06:46.440]   And so that's what I wanted to do.
[01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:49.360]   And so what we did was three months
[01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:52.480]   of two to three times a week cardio.
[01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:56.560]   It was a spin class, so spin classes are great for cardio.
[01:06:56.560 --> 01:06:59.880]   And the comparison group was two to three times a week
[01:06:59.880 --> 01:07:02.600]   of competitive video scrabble.
[01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:07.000]   So no heart rate change, but they had to come into my lab
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.120]   and be in a group just like they were in a group
[01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:11.960]   for the spin class.
[01:07:11.960 --> 01:07:15.000]   We tested them cognitively
[01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.040]   at the beginning of the end of the session.
[01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:21.520]   What we found was two to three times a week of cardio.
[01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:23.000]   In these people, they're a low-fit,
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:26.320]   which means specifically that they were exercising
[01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:29.960]   less than 30 minutes a week for the three months
[01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:31.640]   previous to the experiment.
[01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:34.040]   So they went from that to two to three times a week
[01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:35.240]   of spin class.
[01:07:35.240 --> 01:07:39.960]   And what we found was changes in baseline rates
[01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:42.560]   of their positive mood states went up
[01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:45.360]   relative to the video scrabble group.
[01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:48.800]   Their body image got more positive
[01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:50.840]   because they were exercising, which is great.
[01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:54.920]   And really important, their motivation to exercise
[01:07:54.920 --> 01:07:58.440]   went up significantly compared to the video scrabble group,
[01:07:58.440 --> 01:07:59.640]   which is great.
[01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:01.080]   So the more you exercise,
[01:08:01.080 --> 01:08:03.840]   the more motivated you are to exercise.
[01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:04.760]   What about cognition?
[01:08:04.760 --> 01:08:07.980]   What changed in the cognitive circuits of their brain?
[01:08:07.980 --> 01:08:11.920]   Number one, we got improved performance on the Stroop task,
[01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:15.320]   but we're headed towards my favorite structure,
[01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:17.000]   which is the hippocampus.
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.920]   What we found was improved performance
[01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:22.840]   on both a recognition memory task,
[01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:26.080]   which was a memory encoding task.
[01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:31.080]   And that is, can you differentiate similar items
[01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:34.440]   that we're asking you to remember?
[01:08:34.440 --> 01:08:37.860]   And an spatial episodic memory task,
[01:08:37.860 --> 01:08:40.840]   where we had them play one of those doom-like games
[01:08:40.840 --> 01:08:42.880]   when they went into this spatial maze
[01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:45.480]   and they had to do things in a virtual city.
[01:08:45.480 --> 01:08:47.080]   Their performance there got better,
[01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:49.560]   which is very, very classically dependent
[01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:51.280]   on the hippocampus.
[01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:56.020]   So this, it was so satisfying to do this study
[01:08:56.020 --> 01:08:59.520]   because I've been wanting to answer this question.
[01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:04.520]   What is a minimum amount or doable amount of exercise
[01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:07.640]   that will get you these cognitive benefits?
[01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:11.640]   And now I can say in 30 to 50 year olds
[01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:14.680]   that are low fit two to three times a week,
[01:09:14.680 --> 01:09:15.720]   is that doable?
[01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:16.700]   Absolutely.
[01:09:16.700 --> 01:09:18.260]   Will it be hard if you're low fit?
[01:09:18.260 --> 01:09:20.120]   Yeah, it's gonna be challenging,
[01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:22.040]   but absolutely doable.
[01:09:22.040 --> 01:09:27.040]   And so that is, it makes sense with all of the mechanisms
[01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:31.520]   that we are, I didn't study the mechanisms just to be clear,
[01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:34.760]   but with all the mechanisms we are imagining
[01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:37.880]   are playing a role here, that absolutely makes sense
[01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:39.520]   and it is doable.
[01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:43.220]   This is not like you have to become marathon runner
[01:09:43.220 --> 01:09:45.080]   to get any of these benefits.
[01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:47.160]   This is, you have to start moving your body
[01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:50.560]   on a regular basis, two to three times a week.
[01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:54.780]   And I, so I love that for its realness.
[01:09:54.780 --> 01:09:56.400]   - How long are those sessions again?
[01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:57.240]   - 45 minutes.
[01:09:57.240 --> 01:09:58.080]   - 45 minutes.
[01:09:58.080 --> 01:09:59.240]   - Yeah, 45 minutes.
[01:09:59.240 --> 01:10:02.320]   It's a typical spin kind of class.
[01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:03.760]   There's a warmup for five minutes
[01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:05.040]   and a cool down for five minutes.
[01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:10.040]   So it's really 35 minutes, 35 minutes of, you know,
[01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:12.360]   they're really pushing you.
[01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:13.200]   Yeah.
[01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:15.280]   - So, and so they're breathing reasonably hard.
[01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:16.600]   Heart rate, heart rate is up.
[01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:19.160]   - Heart rate is definitely up, yeah, yeah.
[01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:22.680]   - I find that all of those results are really interesting.
[01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:27.680]   The result showing improvement in motivation to exercise
[01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:29.760]   is interesting 'cause it gets back to this issue
[01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:31.960]   of kind of a self amplifying effect.
[01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:36.500]   And the neuroscientist in me wants to think about
[01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:39.420]   kind of pre-motor circuits and the fact that, you know,
[01:10:39.420 --> 01:10:42.200]   we have a motor system that can obviously do things
[01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:45.760]   like lift cups and walk and run if we want to or need to.
[01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:50.280]   But that it's possible to create a kind of anticipatory
[01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:53.240]   activity in our nervous system where our body
[01:10:53.240 --> 01:10:55.280]   craves a certain stimulus.
[01:10:55.280 --> 01:10:57.640]   You mentioned the cold and how you crave the cold.
[01:10:57.640 --> 01:11:00.560]   Now whether or not that's the adrenaline and the dopamine,
[01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:04.440]   et cetera, or whether or not somebody who exercises
[01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:07.240]   started going from zero, less than 30 minutes per week
[01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:11.080]   to two to three times a week, 45 minutes as you described
[01:11:11.080 --> 01:11:11.920]   for this study.
[01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:16.680]   - I've had that experience before of if I'm,
[01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:19.060]   the cardio that I tend to battle the most,
[01:11:19.060 --> 01:11:23.360]   and I love lifting heavy objects, at least heavy for me.
[01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:26.020]   I'm happy to go to the gym every other day
[01:11:26.020 --> 01:11:27.600]   and just lift heavy objects for an hour.
[01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:28.480]   It just makes me happy.
[01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:29.760]   I like the way it feels.
[01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:32.120]   And I've been doing it since I was in my teens,
[01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:33.440]   so 30 years.
[01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:34.620]   Cardio is a little bit trickier.
[01:11:34.620 --> 01:11:38.360]   I like to run, but if I stop running for a little while,
[01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:40.160]   I find it very hard to get back into.
[01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:42.240]   But if I start running three times a week
[01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:45.260]   for 30 to 45 minutes, and I do this pretty consistently
[01:11:45.260 --> 01:11:46.760]   on the days I don't weight train,
[01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:48.640]   I find that I start to crave it.
[01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:52.320]   It's almost as if my body needs that in order to,
[01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:53.840]   I always say clear out the cobwebs,
[01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:56.040]   but it's like my mind doesn't function as well, clearly.
[01:11:56.040 --> 01:11:59.760]   Now I understand why and why exercise helps.
[01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:03.080]   But also physically, I almost feel like my body needs
[01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:04.160]   to engage in that movement.
[01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:06.720]   Like the pre-motor circuits are kind of revving,
[01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:09.240]   kind of like revving the engine or car while it's in park.
[01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:10.660]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:12:10.660 --> 01:12:12.800]   So the motivation to exercise obviously
[01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:14.740]   could be multifaceted.
[01:12:14.740 --> 01:12:16.480]   It could be purely psychological.
[01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:19.300]   But do you think there's any reason to speculate at least
[01:12:19.300 --> 01:12:23.800]   or believe that we can build an anticipatory,
[01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:26.140]   reverberatory activity into our nervous system?
[01:12:26.140 --> 01:12:27.640]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:32.120]   You know, I agree with that because I also have
[01:12:32.120 --> 01:12:35.060]   those same kinds of thoughts.
[01:12:35.060 --> 01:12:40.060]   And I do have anticipatory exercise when I can't do it.
[01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:44.760]   So I just got back from a week and a half in Paris
[01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:47.460]   where I got to do a book launch of my last book,
[01:12:47.460 --> 01:12:48.640]   "Good Anxiety."
[01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:53.640]   And I walked around a lot,
[01:12:53.640 --> 01:12:57.840]   but I did not do my exercise for that whole week and a half.
[01:12:57.840 --> 01:13:00.780]   But there was a lot of stress
[01:13:00.780 --> 01:13:02.280]   'cause I had to do all these interviews in French.
[01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:03.480]   So I gave myself a break.
[01:13:03.480 --> 01:13:04.320]   - You speak French?
[01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:05.140]   - I speak French, yes.
[01:13:05.140 --> 01:13:05.980]   - I was gonna say, otherwise it would be really stressful.
[01:13:05.980 --> 01:13:07.400]   - Yes, that would be really stressful.
[01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:09.260]   - Now then I'd be really impressed.
[01:13:09.260 --> 01:13:11.620]   Then I would definitely start exercising.
[01:13:11.620 --> 01:13:14.060]   Actually, I would follow your morning routine to a T,
[01:13:14.060 --> 01:13:16.740]   but okay, very impressive nonetheless.
[01:13:16.740 --> 01:13:21.740]   - But I got back and coming back this direction from Paris,
[01:13:21.740 --> 01:13:25.380]   I live in New York, is much easier.
[01:13:25.380 --> 01:13:28.560]   And so I was able to get up at a normal time the next day.
[01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:30.740]   And that exercise session that first day,
[01:13:30.740 --> 01:13:32.220]   it's like, okay, I'm back in my home.
[01:13:32.220 --> 01:13:34.260]   I'm back in my environment.
[01:13:34.260 --> 01:13:36.300]   And it felt so good.
[01:13:36.300 --> 01:13:38.800]   It's like, I wanted to come back.
[01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:43.800]   And I know it's because I worked up over years.
[01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:47.080]   Now I could truthfully say seven days a week,
[01:13:47.080 --> 01:13:50.320]   but it was, first it was four to five,
[01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:51.840]   then it was five to six.
[01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:56.220]   And yeah, seven, but that includes a yoga day
[01:13:56.220 --> 01:13:57.820]   or sometimes I have to do it for 10 minutes
[01:13:57.820 --> 01:14:00.100]   instead of 30 because I have to leave.
[01:14:00.100 --> 01:14:04.960]   But that habit of you do that, even for five minutes,
[01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:08.080]   you do either the wait 10 minute thing
[01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:11.180]   or a five minute thing or a stretch.
[01:14:11.180 --> 01:14:14.100]   That is a tiny habit.
[01:14:14.100 --> 01:14:15.380]   Is that somebody at Stanford
[01:14:15.380 --> 01:14:17.780]   that invented this idea of tiny habits?
[01:14:17.780 --> 01:14:18.780]   I thought it was.
[01:14:18.780 --> 01:14:20.980]   - Well, we've got a number of people there.
[01:14:20.980 --> 01:14:23.260]   And I apologize in advance to all the people
[01:14:23.260 --> 01:14:25.380]   I neglect in this statement,
[01:14:25.380 --> 01:14:28.400]   but I'm happy to put in the comments, folks.
[01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:29.980]   BJ Fogg is there, has done-
[01:14:29.980 --> 01:14:31.660]   - Yes, that's who I-
[01:14:31.660 --> 01:14:34.580]   - Yeah, BJ has done really great work.
[01:14:34.580 --> 01:14:38.080]   And then James Clear wrote a book about habits
[01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:40.840]   and has a very popular newsletter about habits.
[01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:42.080]   We've done an episode about habits
[01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:44.240]   that covers some of their work
[01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:47.840]   and some of the more laboratory-ish, not ish,
[01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:50.480]   laboratory science, peer-reviewed work on it.
[01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:53.280]   Daily behaviors, also daily behaviors performed
[01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:55.320]   at roughly the same time of day.
[01:14:55.320 --> 01:14:56.720]   I mean, one thing we know for sure
[01:14:56.720 --> 01:15:01.720]   is that the circadian system is part of our nervous system's
[01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:03.960]   way of anticipating when things will happen,
[01:15:03.960 --> 01:15:05.300]   not just what will happen.
[01:15:05.300 --> 01:15:07.860]   I'm telling you things you obviously know already,
[01:15:07.860 --> 01:15:10.580]   but for the audience, performing your exercise
[01:15:10.580 --> 01:15:14.020]   at roughly the same time each day will make it easier.
[01:15:14.020 --> 01:15:14.860]   As opposed to just saying,
[01:15:14.860 --> 01:15:17.020]   "I'm going to do it seven days a week sometime today."
[01:15:17.020 --> 01:15:18.880]   But of course, getting it done sometime
[01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:20.080]   is better than not getting it done.
[01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:22.700]   - Yes, absolutely, absolutely.
[01:15:22.700 --> 01:15:24.700]   - Well, those are impressive effects.
[01:15:24.700 --> 01:15:27.120]   And I love that you're starting to look in populations
[01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:27.960]   that are a bit younger,
[01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:31.600]   not because some of these older populations aren't important,
[01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:34.840]   but I think that building good habits
[01:15:34.840 --> 01:15:37.500]   across one's entire life is really what it's about.
[01:15:37.500 --> 01:15:41.380]   As I always say, with anything related to longevity
[01:15:41.380 --> 01:15:44.600]   or offsetting an age-related decline,
[01:15:44.600 --> 01:15:47.240]   it's hard to know if things work
[01:15:47.240 --> 01:15:50.480]   because there's no within-subject control.
[01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:52.380]   But what we also know for sure
[01:15:52.380 --> 01:15:55.640]   is that you don't want to be the control experiment.
[01:15:55.640 --> 01:15:57.800]   You absolutely don't want to be the control experiment,
[01:15:57.800 --> 01:16:00.480]   especially for something that's purely behavioral.
[01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:02.280]   I mean, you're not talking about ingesting
[01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:03.360]   a particular supplement.
[01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:06.120]   You're not talking about changing your diet in any way,
[01:16:06.120 --> 01:16:07.160]   but I am curious.
[01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:13.440]   Diet is a very barbed wire topic on the internet,
[01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:15.640]   which diets, whether or not they work, et cetera.
[01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:18.680]   But in general, in any of these studies,
[01:16:18.680 --> 01:16:19.800]   do they evaluate whether or not
[01:16:19.800 --> 01:16:21.320]   people change their eating habits
[01:16:21.320 --> 01:16:22.960]   when they start to exercise more?
[01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:23.800]   - Yeah.
[01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:29.340]   I think I've seen one study that controlled for that,
[01:16:29.340 --> 01:16:32.260]   but I feel for them because it's hard enough
[01:16:32.260 --> 01:16:35.280]   to get people to exercise at the level
[01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:40.100]   and at the time that you need for your study.
[01:16:40.100 --> 01:16:42.420]   If you also ask them, "Okay, fill out this survey
[01:16:42.420 --> 01:16:44.840]   "to tell us exactly what you ate all day,"
[01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:46.620]   they're gonna say, "Forget you.
[01:16:46.620 --> 01:16:48.680]   "I'm not joining your study."
[01:16:48.680 --> 01:16:51.300]   So it's a critical question.
[01:16:51.300 --> 01:16:55.360]   And again, there's only been one that I've seen.
[01:16:55.360 --> 01:16:59.180]   And the evidence was that diets got better
[01:16:59.180 --> 01:17:01.160]   when they, less processed foods,
[01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:03.840]   when they did adhere to this exercise.
[01:17:03.840 --> 01:17:07.160]   But a lot more information needs to be gathered
[01:17:07.160 --> 01:17:08.540]   in that realm.
[01:17:08.540 --> 01:17:10.580]   The second study that I wanted to share,
[01:17:10.580 --> 01:17:13.200]   unpublished, we're writing it up right now,
[01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:16.560]   is part two of that study that I just described,
[01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:18.480]   which was the low-fit people.
[01:17:18.480 --> 01:17:20.160]   Next, we move to mid-fit people.
[01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:21.300]   Like, what about us?
[01:17:21.300 --> 01:17:23.240]   We're already exercising.
[01:17:23.240 --> 01:17:27.640]   How am I gonna benefit from increasing my exercise?
[01:17:27.640 --> 01:17:31.860]   So here again, we collaborated with a great spin studio
[01:17:31.860 --> 01:17:33.720]   that had a whole bunch of mid-fit people
[01:17:33.720 --> 01:17:37.420]   that, by our definition, were exercising
[01:17:37.420 --> 01:17:39.740]   two to three times a week on a regular basis.
[01:17:39.740 --> 01:17:40.580]   That's great.
[01:17:40.580 --> 01:17:42.260]   All you people out there that are doing that,
[01:17:42.260 --> 01:17:45.260]   you should know you're already benefiting your brain.
[01:17:45.260 --> 01:17:48.280]   But our question was, what if we invited them
[01:17:48.280 --> 01:17:51.680]   to exercise as much as they wanted at the spin studio
[01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:54.480]   for three months, from two to three times,
[01:17:54.480 --> 01:17:56.440]   all the way up to seven times a week?
[01:17:56.440 --> 01:17:58.160]   And let's just see what happened.
[01:17:58.160 --> 01:18:01.800]   And the control group, we asked them
[01:18:01.800 --> 01:18:04.320]   not to change their exercise.
[01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:09.240]   And so what we ended up with was a nice, big array
[01:18:09.240 --> 01:18:12.380]   of starting with mid-fit people
[01:18:12.380 --> 01:18:15.280]   that exercise between staying at two to three times a week
[01:18:15.280 --> 01:18:17.500]   all the way up to seven times a week.
[01:18:17.500 --> 01:18:21.520]   And the bottom line from that study is
[01:18:21.520 --> 01:18:23.560]   every drop of sweat counted.
[01:18:23.560 --> 01:18:27.440]   That is, the more you change and you increase your workout
[01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:31.080]   up to seven times a week, the better your mood was.
[01:18:31.080 --> 01:18:35.920]   You had lower amounts of depression and anxiety,
[01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:39.680]   higher amounts of good affect.
[01:18:39.680 --> 01:18:43.180]   And the better your hippocampal memory was
[01:18:43.180 --> 01:18:45.040]   with the more you worked out.
[01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:46.980]   Again, this was for three months.
[01:18:46.980 --> 01:18:50.160]   So I love that too, because it gives power
[01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:54.520]   to those of us that are regularly exercising and wondering,
[01:18:54.520 --> 01:18:57.520]   do I really need to, I mean, is it really gonna help me?
[01:18:57.520 --> 01:18:58.600]   And the answer is yes.
[01:18:58.600 --> 01:19:00.600]   I mean, not all of us can exercise,
[01:19:00.600 --> 01:19:03.220]   go to a spin class seven times a week.
[01:19:03.220 --> 01:19:08.220]   But I love the message that our body's responsive to that.
[01:19:08.220 --> 01:19:11.600]   And you can get better hippocampal function,
[01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:16.460]   better overall baseline mood affect with a higher level.
[01:19:16.460 --> 01:19:19.480]   So it works for the mid-fit people as well.
[01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:21.240]   - Fantastic.
[01:19:21.240 --> 01:19:22.720]   The more I learned from you,
[01:19:22.720 --> 01:19:25.200]   the more I've been starting to conceptualize the brain
[01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:28.560]   as an organ that is privileged in so many ways,
[01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:31.360]   has this unique blood-brain barrier,
[01:19:31.360 --> 01:19:35.160]   has this incredible quality of being able to predict things.
[01:19:35.160 --> 01:19:36.760]   And its job mainly is, of course,
[01:19:36.760 --> 01:19:40.160]   to predict things among other functions, of course.
[01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:45.160]   But that our brain isn't necessarily going to stay stable
[01:19:45.160 --> 01:19:48.720]   or get better over time, that it needs a signal.
[01:19:49.680 --> 01:19:52.580]   That it isn't sufficient to just say
[01:19:52.580 --> 01:19:53.860]   that we can't take it for granted.
[01:19:53.860 --> 01:19:58.620]   That our brain is actually an organ that requires a signal
[01:19:58.620 --> 01:20:00.980]   in order to maintain its own function.
[01:20:00.980 --> 01:20:03.180]   And it sounds like enhanced blood flow
[01:20:03.180 --> 01:20:05.180]   and these pathways that you described earlier,
[01:20:05.180 --> 01:20:06.740]   these two pathways,
[01:20:06.740 --> 01:20:10.460]   are at least among the more critical signals.
[01:20:10.460 --> 01:20:13.380]   I'm tempted now to move my frequency
[01:20:13.380 --> 01:20:15.020]   of cardiovascular exercise from,
[01:20:15.020 --> 01:20:18.920]   I confess it's about three days, 35 minutes lately,
[01:20:18.920 --> 01:20:22.080]   and it should be more, to daily.
[01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:23.000]   There's something really, again,
[01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.500]   really special about daily because it's non-negotiable.
[01:20:25.500 --> 01:20:26.340]   You just do it.
[01:20:26.340 --> 01:20:29.940]   And it sounds like if one were to do
[01:20:29.940 --> 01:20:32.240]   higher intensity exercise,
[01:20:32.240 --> 01:20:33.960]   in a spin class, I've never taken a spin class,
[01:20:33.960 --> 01:20:35.760]   but I've seen there are times when they're standing up
[01:20:35.760 --> 01:20:37.360]   on the bike and pedaling very hard.
[01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:39.480]   So that is included in these kinds of workouts, right?
[01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:40.700]   - Absolutely, yeah.
[01:20:40.700 --> 01:20:43.560]   I mean, that's what the instructor is doing.
[01:20:43.560 --> 01:20:45.800]   I cannot control.
[01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:49.160]   We did not monitor heart rate of all the subjects.
[01:20:49.160 --> 01:20:52.680]   And it was clearly, compared to the video Scrabble,
[01:20:52.680 --> 01:20:54.020]   it was highly significant.
[01:20:54.020 --> 01:20:54.860]   - I would hope so.
[01:20:54.860 --> 01:20:55.700]   - Yes.
[01:20:55.700 --> 01:20:58.180]   - I guess it depends on how intense that game of Scrabble is.
[01:20:58.180 --> 01:21:04.320]   Could we just briefly talk about mindset and affirmations?
[01:21:04.320 --> 01:21:05.160]   - Yeah, sure.
[01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:09.060]   - You've talked a bit before about affirmations.
[01:21:09.060 --> 01:21:12.320]   And as you mentioned, the beautiful work of my colleague
[01:21:12.320 --> 01:21:13.680]   at Stanford, Alia Crum,
[01:21:13.680 --> 01:21:16.920]   we can summarize her work pretty simply,
[01:21:16.920 --> 01:21:18.560]   although we won't do it complete justice,
[01:21:18.560 --> 01:21:19.800]   she's already been on the podcast,
[01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:24.120]   that just to say that one's beliefs about a behavior
[01:21:24.120 --> 01:21:26.640]   also impact the outcomes of that behavior.
[01:21:26.640 --> 01:21:29.800]   If you learn a lot of true facts
[01:21:29.800 --> 01:21:32.120]   about stress being good for you,
[01:21:32.120 --> 01:21:35.120]   then you will experience stress as better for you
[01:21:35.120 --> 01:21:37.120]   than if you only focus on or learn
[01:21:37.120 --> 01:21:38.540]   about the negative effects of stress.
[01:21:38.540 --> 01:21:40.900]   If you learn about the positive effects of exercise,
[01:21:40.900 --> 01:21:43.980]   you actually derive greater benefit from exercise,
[01:21:43.980 --> 01:21:45.220]   believe it or not.
[01:21:45.220 --> 01:21:47.920]   It's incredible effects, but they make sense
[01:21:47.920 --> 01:21:49.500]   when you understand what the brain is doing,
[01:21:49.500 --> 01:21:51.300]   which is a lot of this predictive coding
[01:21:51.300 --> 01:21:54.860]   and mindsets don't seem as mysterious and woo anymore
[01:21:54.860 --> 01:21:56.980]   once you understand what the brain is really doing.
[01:21:56.980 --> 01:22:01.980]   But what is, if any, the value of affirmation,
[01:22:01.980 --> 01:22:06.500]   of telling yourself something positive about yourself
[01:22:06.500 --> 01:22:10.260]   or of exercise on, not the exercise itself,
[01:22:10.260 --> 01:22:14.200]   but on mood, self-image, memory, and brain function.
[01:22:14.200 --> 01:22:18.660]   - Yeah, so I looked into this
[01:22:18.660 --> 01:22:22.680]   because I am also a certified exercise instructor
[01:22:22.680 --> 01:22:26.360]   and the form of exercise that I teach is called Intensati,
[01:22:26.360 --> 01:22:28.960]   that it's a form of exercise that was developed
[01:22:28.960 --> 01:22:33.100]   by this amazing instructor, Patricia Moreno.
[01:22:33.100 --> 01:22:36.840]   And she combined physical movements from kickbox and dance
[01:22:36.840 --> 01:22:41.060]   and yoga and martial arts with positive spoken affirmations.
[01:22:41.060 --> 01:22:43.020]   So each move, if you're punching back and forth,
[01:22:43.020 --> 01:22:46.380]   as you would do in a kickbox class, you don't just punch,
[01:22:46.380 --> 01:22:49.500]   you say something like, "I am strong now,"
[01:22:49.500 --> 01:22:52.060]   which every punch is associated with a word.
[01:22:52.060 --> 01:22:57.060]   And you can create your own series of affirmations
[01:22:57.060 --> 01:22:59.140]   with the moves that you put together.
[01:22:59.140 --> 01:23:02.940]   And the first time I did it, I just wandered into her class.
[01:23:02.940 --> 01:23:04.060]   I didn't know what it was.
[01:23:04.060 --> 01:23:06.800]   And I felt idiotic.
[01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:09.080]   It's like, I came into the wrong class.
[01:23:09.080 --> 01:23:11.500]   I clearly, I don't wanna come into this class.
[01:23:11.500 --> 01:23:14.000]   But then I saw, they didn't care
[01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:18.100]   whether I thought they looked silly saying these,
[01:23:18.100 --> 01:23:21.520]   not saying, yelling these affirmations out loud
[01:23:21.520 --> 01:23:24.500]   while doing the choreography at the same time.
[01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:27.080]   And then I tried it, okay, I didn't yell out.
[01:23:27.080 --> 01:23:29.880]   I kind of whispered it at first.
[01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:32.380]   But by the end, I was really yelling it out.
[01:23:32.380 --> 01:23:36.380]   There's something about the declaration using your own voice
[01:23:36.380 --> 01:23:40.980]   of saying things that you don't often say to yourself,
[01:23:40.980 --> 01:23:44.520]   like, "I'm strong, I'm inspired, I believe I will succeed,"
[01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:47.020]   are all the kinds of affirmations you say.
[01:23:47.020 --> 01:23:48.620]   And you walk out of that class,
[01:23:48.620 --> 01:23:51.280]   or I walked out of that class thinking,
[01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:54.380]   "Ah, I feel really good now.
[01:23:54.380 --> 01:23:57.360]   Man, I can't wait to come back to this class,"
[01:23:57.360 --> 01:24:00.300]   which is why I ultimately took teacher training
[01:24:00.300 --> 01:24:02.340]   to be able to teach that class.
[01:24:02.340 --> 01:24:06.460]   And so I started to look into
[01:24:06.460 --> 01:24:08.180]   what was known about affirmations.
[01:24:08.180 --> 01:24:11.980]   And they were never combined with physical activity.
[01:24:11.980 --> 01:24:15.520]   But it was clear that there was a literature showing
[01:24:15.520 --> 01:24:18.020]   that positive affirmations,
[01:24:18.020 --> 01:24:21.940]   saying them or reading them could change mood
[01:24:21.940 --> 01:24:25.380]   in the same way as we're talking about Aliyah Crum's work.
[01:24:25.380 --> 01:24:29.140]   If you have this, it's a belief.
[01:24:29.140 --> 01:24:30.780]   Once you start saying these things,
[01:24:30.780 --> 01:24:34.460]   these are not difficult things to believe,
[01:24:34.460 --> 01:24:38.900]   but it's amazing how much you don't say these kinds of things
[01:24:38.900 --> 01:24:41.540]   to yourself or with your own voice.
[01:24:41.540 --> 01:24:43.060]   You might say them about somebody else.
[01:24:43.060 --> 01:24:45.660]   "Oh, you're strong, you're so smart."
[01:24:45.660 --> 01:24:47.220]   Do you say that about yourself?
[01:24:47.220 --> 01:24:50.620]   And that's the thing about the self-affirmations.
[01:24:50.620 --> 01:24:54.060]   It really gets you into a habit
[01:24:54.060 --> 01:24:56.700]   of saying good things about yourself.
[01:24:56.700 --> 01:24:59.660]   And then you start to realize, "Oh my God,
[01:24:59.660 --> 01:25:01.620]   I'm so mean to myself."
[01:25:01.620 --> 01:25:04.740]   I have lots of negative thoughts going on
[01:25:04.740 --> 01:25:06.860]   about myself in my head,
[01:25:06.860 --> 01:25:09.060]   which was part of the other reason
[01:25:09.060 --> 01:25:13.280]   why I loved this particular form of exercise.
[01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:18.280]   So what you get in Tenzati is the mood boost
[01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:20.820]   from the positive spoken affirmations
[01:25:20.820 --> 01:25:25.180]   together with all the other brain and affect boosts
[01:25:25.180 --> 01:25:28.700]   that we've been talking about for this whole podcast
[01:25:28.700 --> 01:25:32.360]   from the exercise, because it's a sweaty workout as well.
[01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:33.460]   - Interesting.
[01:25:33.460 --> 01:25:35.580]   There's a book, I confess I haven't read it,
[01:25:35.580 --> 01:25:38.100]   but I have had the pleasure of having a discussion
[01:25:38.100 --> 01:25:39.540]   with a psychologist from, I believe it was
[01:25:39.540 --> 01:25:43.380]   at University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Ethan Cross,
[01:25:43.380 --> 01:25:44.820]   wrote a book called "Chatter,"
[01:25:44.820 --> 01:25:48.260]   which focuses on the fact that so much
[01:25:48.260 --> 01:25:50.820]   of our inner dialogue is indeed negative.
[01:25:50.820 --> 01:25:54.340]   He certainly wasn't the first to point that out,
[01:25:54.340 --> 01:25:57.600]   but that explicit statements to counter
[01:25:57.600 --> 01:25:59.220]   that negative chatter, I believe,
[01:25:59.220 --> 01:26:02.980]   is one of the hallmarks of readjusting one's own,
[01:26:02.980 --> 01:26:05.120]   not just internal reference frame,
[01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:07.260]   but actually self-image generally.
[01:26:07.260 --> 01:26:11.500]   And it's a fascinating, and I think a very important area
[01:26:11.500 --> 01:26:13.900]   of psychology and neuroscience because,
[01:26:13.900 --> 01:26:16.540]   and I acknowledge this as we're talking about this too,
[01:26:16.540 --> 01:26:19.120]   laboratory neuroscientists who record from neurons
[01:26:19.120 --> 01:26:21.980]   and label neurons and look at stuff down the microscope,
[01:26:21.980 --> 01:26:23.980]   we are now deep in the territory,
[01:26:23.980 --> 01:26:26.780]   in the deep water of what some of our colleagues
[01:26:26.780 --> 01:26:29.700]   and people who think about neuroscience would consider
[01:26:29.700 --> 01:26:33.300]   like really out there on the kind of subjective edges.
[01:26:33.300 --> 01:26:36.740]   And yet I think it's worth pointing out
[01:26:36.740 --> 01:26:39.480]   that the brain does all these things.
[01:26:39.480 --> 01:26:41.900]   It's responsible for simple reflexes and motor behaviors,
[01:26:41.900 --> 01:26:46.180]   but also high-level conceptual ideas about the universe
[01:26:46.180 --> 01:26:47.620]   and what it might look like in 10 years
[01:26:47.620 --> 01:26:49.260]   or a hundred years or a thousand years,
[01:26:49.260 --> 01:26:52.000]   but also high-level conceptual understanding
[01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.960]   of who we are and what we are about.
[01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:57.180]   And so even though it might seem a little bit out
[01:26:57.180 --> 01:26:59.540]   on the fringes, dare I say,
[01:26:59.540 --> 01:27:01.780]   I think that these are some of the more important
[01:27:01.780 --> 01:27:04.380]   untried landscapes of neuroscience.
[01:27:04.380 --> 01:27:07.460]   And I just want to acknowledge my appreciation
[01:27:07.460 --> 01:27:11.420]   for the fact that I'm going to connect the dots here
[01:27:11.420 --> 01:27:13.680]   and say, you went from somebody who didn't exercise,
[01:27:13.680 --> 01:27:15.380]   who went on this rafting trip,
[01:27:15.380 --> 01:27:17.500]   that discovered exercise and its benefits
[01:27:17.500 --> 01:27:20.700]   for your grant writing and then on and on and on,
[01:27:20.700 --> 01:27:22.400]   and then became a certified-
[01:27:22.400 --> 01:27:23.860]   - Yeah, exercise instructor.
[01:27:23.860 --> 01:27:25.000]   - Instructor.
[01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:28.960]   So you don't do anything halfway either as it's clear.
[01:27:28.960 --> 01:27:33.580]   I'd like to touch on something you mentioned earlier,
[01:27:33.580 --> 01:27:37.440]   but we haven't dove into it all in any depth,
[01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:38.580]   which is meditation.
[01:27:38.580 --> 01:27:42.760]   You mentioned this tea meditation.
[01:27:42.760 --> 01:27:47.500]   You had a publication recently on a 10-minute meditation,
[01:27:47.500 --> 01:27:48.340]   right?
[01:27:48.340 --> 01:27:50.160]   Maybe you could tell us about this 10-minute meditation
[01:27:50.160 --> 01:27:52.980]   because it seems like such a tractable amount of time.
[01:27:52.980 --> 01:27:53.920]   - Right.
[01:27:53.920 --> 01:27:54.760]   - And then if you would,
[01:27:54.760 --> 01:27:56.660]   maybe tell us a little bit about the tea meditation,
[01:27:56.660 --> 01:27:59.120]   but it sounds like you've discovered
[01:27:59.120 --> 01:28:03.260]   a close to minimum threshold of meditation
[01:28:03.260 --> 01:28:04.300]   that can really benefit us.
[01:28:04.300 --> 01:28:07.660]   So maybe you could tell us about that study.
[01:28:07.660 --> 01:28:12.660]   - So the study was, as you very astutely pointed out,
[01:28:12.660 --> 01:28:14.940]   very practical study.
[01:28:14.940 --> 01:28:18.300]   Just 10 minutes, not 30 minutes, not an hour of meditation.
[01:28:18.300 --> 01:28:19.300]   That's too hard.
[01:28:19.300 --> 01:28:21.740]   10 minutes guided meditation.
[01:28:21.740 --> 01:28:24.420]   They logged into a site so we can tell that they logged in
[01:28:24.420 --> 01:28:28.280]   and they listened to a, it's a body scan,
[01:28:28.280 --> 01:28:32.180]   very basic but easy to follow kind of meditation.
[01:28:32.180 --> 01:28:35.560]   And we asked them to do it how often?
[01:28:35.560 --> 01:28:39.260]   Daily, seven days a week, just 10 minutes a day.
[01:28:39.260 --> 01:28:41.700]   And the most shocking thing about this study
[01:28:41.700 --> 01:28:45.660]   is that we got more adherence
[01:28:45.660 --> 01:28:47.860]   to the 10-minute daily meditation
[01:28:47.860 --> 01:28:50.720]   than the 10-minute daily podcast listening,
[01:28:50.720 --> 01:28:51.920]   which was our control.
[01:28:51.920 --> 01:28:54.580]   So the highest retention rate I've ever gotten
[01:28:54.580 --> 01:28:57.180]   in any, this kind of study that I've done,
[01:28:57.180 --> 01:29:00.300]   exercise or meditation, they wanted to do it.
[01:29:00.300 --> 01:29:02.500]   10 minutes a day, it was great.
[01:29:02.500 --> 01:29:04.740]   - I'm gonna just start leading meditations
[01:29:04.740 --> 01:29:08.100]   for three hours as it was during three-hour podcasts.
[01:29:08.100 --> 01:29:13.100]   - So we looked at cognitive effects before and after this.
[01:29:15.100 --> 01:29:18.100]   It was eight weeks of daily, it was actually
[01:29:18.100 --> 01:29:22.180]   12-minute meditation, 12 minutes of body scan meditation.
[01:29:22.180 --> 01:29:26.620]   And what we found was significant decreases
[01:29:26.620 --> 01:29:27.780]   in stress response.
[01:29:27.780 --> 01:29:32.780]   We did the stress test to see how you responded
[01:29:32.780 --> 01:29:35.340]   to an unexpected stressful situation.
[01:29:35.340 --> 01:29:37.820]   The meditators did much better.
[01:29:37.820 --> 01:29:41.880]   Their mood was better and their cognitive performance
[01:29:41.880 --> 01:29:43.520]   was also better.
[01:29:43.520 --> 01:29:47.540]   And this was my first little foray into meditation
[01:29:47.540 --> 01:29:51.860]   after I had started my personal team meditation
[01:29:51.860 --> 01:29:58.080]   that really shifted my relationship with meditation.
[01:29:58.080 --> 01:30:03.840]   But it's consistent with many other studies
[01:30:03.840 --> 01:30:08.140]   showing the beneficial effects of meditation.
[01:30:08.140 --> 01:30:11.240]   But the unique thing was we tried to make it doable,
[01:30:11.240 --> 01:30:12.920]   that many, many people out there
[01:30:12.920 --> 01:30:17.180]   could actually follow this typical regimen.
[01:30:17.180 --> 01:30:21.140]   And so we're continuing that.
[01:30:21.140 --> 01:30:24.280]   In fact, my research in my lab right now
[01:30:24.280 --> 01:30:28.860]   is all about those doable, short things
[01:30:28.860 --> 01:30:32.340]   that NYU college students will do,
[01:30:32.340 --> 01:30:34.260]   not just at the beginning of the semester
[01:30:34.260 --> 01:30:36.300]   but at the end of the semester
[01:30:36.300 --> 01:30:38.560]   when the stress and anxiety levels
[01:30:38.560 --> 01:30:41.580]   are now at record-breaking high levels
[01:30:41.580 --> 01:30:44.660]   and they need something to bring that level down
[01:30:44.660 --> 01:30:46.840]   so that they could show their professors
[01:30:46.840 --> 01:30:49.040]   what their brains can actually do.
[01:30:49.040 --> 01:30:51.480]   And so it includes very short meditations,
[01:30:51.480 --> 01:30:56.340]   sound meditations, visual meditations, walking,
[01:30:56.340 --> 01:30:58.420]   things that any college student,
[01:30:58.420 --> 01:31:02.420]   but we're obviously focused on NYU students, will do.
[01:31:02.420 --> 01:31:06.220]   I wanna get at graduation rates.
[01:31:06.220 --> 01:31:09.020]   I wanna get at class performance
[01:31:09.020 --> 01:31:11.700]   with these kinds of interventions.
[01:31:11.700 --> 01:31:12.900]   But it started with that study
[01:31:12.900 --> 01:31:14.860]   that I just described, meditation.
[01:31:14.860 --> 01:31:21.320]   - If you would, and here's where we can highlight this again
[01:31:21.320 --> 01:31:25.680]   as some highly educated speculation, it's coming from you.
[01:31:25.680 --> 01:31:29.300]   What do you think is going on during meditation?
[01:31:29.300 --> 01:31:33.420]   So a body scan involves an interoceptive awareness,
[01:31:33.420 --> 01:31:35.780]   like interoception of course being an attention
[01:31:35.780 --> 01:31:37.780]   to what's going on on the surface of
[01:31:37.780 --> 01:31:39.220]   and within the confines of our skin
[01:31:39.220 --> 01:31:41.000]   as opposed to the outside world.
[01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:46.340]   Drawing our attention to anything inside us or outside us
[01:31:46.340 --> 01:31:48.820]   involves forebrain function, prefrontal cortex,
[01:31:48.820 --> 01:31:50.620]   presumably and other things.
[01:31:50.620 --> 01:31:52.460]   Typically eyes are closed.
[01:31:52.460 --> 01:31:53.860]   Typically it's relaxing.
[01:31:53.860 --> 01:31:55.860]   So there are a lot of variables that could be feeding
[01:31:55.860 --> 01:31:58.500]   into a number of different effects.
[01:31:58.500 --> 01:32:03.420]   But as a neuroscientist, what do you think is going on
[01:32:03.420 --> 01:32:07.660]   that this period of kind of a self-induced,
[01:32:07.660 --> 01:32:09.240]   somewhat unusual state,
[01:32:09.240 --> 01:32:13.940]   what do you think is going on in terms of network behavior
[01:32:13.940 --> 01:32:16.400]   and networks within the brain
[01:32:16.400 --> 01:32:18.580]   that it can have these long-term effects?
[01:32:18.580 --> 01:32:19.700]   Because we got to some of the ones
[01:32:19.700 --> 01:32:21.420]   who relate downstream of exercise.
[01:32:21.420 --> 01:32:26.060]   And I think there's so much evidence.
[01:32:26.060 --> 01:32:27.180]   I know there's so much evidence
[01:32:27.180 --> 01:32:28.780]   that meditation is beneficial.
[01:32:28.780 --> 01:32:31.180]   How do you think it's working?
[01:32:31.180 --> 01:32:32.620]   Or what do you think it's doing?
[01:32:32.620 --> 01:32:36.480]   - Yeah, I think that one of the most important things
[01:32:36.480 --> 01:32:41.380]   that gets worked when we're doing a simple 10 minute
[01:32:41.380 --> 01:32:45.060]   or 12 minute body scan meditation regularly,
[01:32:45.060 --> 01:32:47.720]   this 10 minutes a day, 12 minutes a day,
[01:32:47.720 --> 01:32:52.700]   is the habit building and the practice
[01:32:52.700 --> 01:32:56.420]   of focusing on the present moment.
[01:32:56.420 --> 01:33:00.600]   I think that is very hard for us modern humans to do
[01:33:00.600 --> 01:33:03.940]   because I'm worrying about the thing that's due
[01:33:03.940 --> 01:33:07.760]   at the end of the week that I need to do
[01:33:07.760 --> 01:33:10.800]   and how many hours am I gonna have to be able to do that.
[01:33:10.800 --> 01:33:14.180]   Or I'm worried about whatever the email
[01:33:14.180 --> 01:33:16.320]   that wasn't as polite as it should be that I sent
[01:33:16.320 --> 01:33:19.340]   and what were the repercussions for that.
[01:33:19.340 --> 01:33:24.340]   Instead of focusing on this moment, which is fun,
[01:33:24.340 --> 01:33:26.880]   I get to talk to you.
[01:33:26.880 --> 01:33:28.440]   It's a beautiful day outside.
[01:33:29.600 --> 01:33:32.020]   I'm feeling good right at this moment.
[01:33:32.020 --> 01:33:36.860]   And I think that those, all of the meditative practices
[01:33:36.860 --> 01:33:40.800]   that I've done, and this one also,
[01:33:40.800 --> 01:33:43.380]   whether you know it or not,
[01:33:43.380 --> 01:33:48.260]   is getting you to focus on this moment.
[01:33:48.260 --> 01:33:52.100]   And I think it's even more important in this day and age
[01:33:52.100 --> 01:33:55.940]   where anxiety levels and the next variant might come out
[01:33:55.940 --> 01:33:57.640]   and what are the repercussions there.
[01:33:57.640 --> 01:33:59.700]   And I have a mother who's older
[01:33:59.700 --> 01:34:02.640]   and she's more susceptible to it and there's a war
[01:34:02.640 --> 01:34:04.440]   and what's gonna happen there.
[01:34:04.440 --> 01:34:09.140]   Those are all future possibilities.
[01:34:09.140 --> 01:34:11.660]   And we should be worried about that.
[01:34:11.660 --> 01:34:14.200]   That is a possibility, you need to plan for that.
[01:34:14.200 --> 01:34:19.120]   But you also need to focus on this moment right now.
[01:34:19.120 --> 01:34:21.640]   I'm healthy, I can breathe.
[01:34:21.640 --> 01:34:24.060]   I get to have this interesting conversation
[01:34:24.060 --> 01:34:24.980]   right in this moment.
[01:34:24.980 --> 01:34:26.940]   If I start thinking about other things,
[01:34:26.940 --> 01:34:30.200]   then it takes away from this moment.
[01:34:30.200 --> 01:34:33.780]   Do I know what circuits are involved?
[01:34:33.780 --> 01:34:36.580]   Not exactly, that is not my area.
[01:34:36.580 --> 01:34:39.120]   I think there are some studies that have focused
[01:34:39.120 --> 01:34:44.120]   on that present moment kind of activity.
[01:34:44.120 --> 01:34:46.720]   But that is what I think is most important
[01:34:46.720 --> 01:34:49.040]   about the practice of meditation,
[01:34:49.040 --> 01:34:52.900]   or one of the important things that calms us down.
[01:34:52.900 --> 01:34:54.860]   Because if you know how to do that,
[01:34:54.860 --> 01:34:58.860]   that gives you this powerful tool for the rest of your day.
[01:34:58.860 --> 01:35:03.080]   You're not locked into that fearful future thinking
[01:35:03.080 --> 01:35:04.300]   that so many of us have,
[01:35:04.300 --> 01:35:08.240]   or that just reliving of the terrible past,
[01:35:08.240 --> 01:35:12.320]   but you could enjoy the present moment.
[01:35:12.320 --> 01:35:14.140]   - Yeah, that really resonates.
[01:35:14.140 --> 01:35:16.700]   I think that going back to the earlier part
[01:35:16.700 --> 01:35:18.200]   of our conversation,
[01:35:18.200 --> 01:35:22.400]   the hippocampus has this incredible storage capacity
[01:35:22.400 --> 01:35:25.940]   and ability to set context about past, present, and future.
[01:35:25.940 --> 01:35:27.680]   And that's a beautiful thing,
[01:35:27.680 --> 01:35:30.960]   because as much as I like to think he had some semblance
[01:35:30.960 --> 01:35:33.840]   of a healthy life, none of us want to be HM.
[01:35:33.840 --> 01:35:35.440]   None of us want to be in the position
[01:35:35.440 --> 01:35:36.960]   of not being able to form new memories
[01:35:36.960 --> 01:35:40.240]   and have no context to the past or the present.
[01:35:40.240 --> 01:35:42.660]   So we're grateful that we should all be grateful
[01:35:42.660 --> 01:35:46.200]   that our hippocampus can draw from past, present, and future
[01:35:46.200 --> 01:35:47.360]   in various combinations,
[01:35:47.360 --> 01:35:50.000]   and we should support it through the daily exercise
[01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.920]   and other habits, let's call them habits
[01:35:52.920 --> 01:35:55.440]   so that people make them habits that you've highlighted.
[01:35:55.440 --> 01:35:58.840]   But if we are not deliberately anchoring
[01:35:58.840 --> 01:36:03.320]   within past, present, and future according to what we need,
[01:36:03.320 --> 01:36:06.340]   and we're just shuffling between past, present, and future,
[01:36:06.340 --> 01:36:08.520]   that is not a good way to live.
[01:36:08.520 --> 01:36:10.080]   - No. - It's not effective.
[01:36:10.080 --> 01:36:11.520]   - No. - It sounds like meditation
[01:36:11.520 --> 01:36:15.000]   can really help us go to the right stacks.
[01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000]   I guess people don't go to libraries anymore,
[01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:20.180]   but in the old days, you need to go to the right location
[01:36:20.180 --> 01:36:21.020]   in the library.
[01:36:21.020 --> 01:36:22.840]   You actually can't get distracted by the books
[01:36:22.840 --> 01:36:24.640]   that you're interested in if you need to go,
[01:36:24.640 --> 01:36:27.340]   just reflexively, if you need to go study a particular topic.
[01:36:27.340 --> 01:36:29.300]   So that's kind of how I think about it.
[01:36:29.300 --> 01:36:33.040]   It makes us more linear, perhaps, in our way of being.
[01:36:33.040 --> 01:36:35.460]   - I think so, and it actually counteracts,
[01:36:35.460 --> 01:36:40.700]   not that I'm against technology, but having our phones
[01:36:40.700 --> 01:36:44.760]   and being connected to every good and bad thing
[01:36:44.760 --> 01:36:47.800]   going along, going on in the world today
[01:36:47.800 --> 01:36:51.040]   is incredibly distracting and takes you away
[01:36:51.040 --> 01:36:54.760]   from the present moment, virtually 24 hours a day.
[01:36:54.760 --> 01:36:57.440]   And so we have to work extra hard right now
[01:36:57.440 --> 01:37:00.100]   compared to in the 40s when we didn't have
[01:37:00.100 --> 01:37:02.460]   all this technology or at the same level.
[01:37:02.460 --> 01:37:06.240]   So yeah, it becomes even more important practice,
[01:37:06.240 --> 01:37:07.840]   I think, for everyday life.
[01:37:07.840 --> 01:37:09.920]   - Yeah, or even 10, 15 years ago,
[01:37:09.920 --> 01:37:13.260]   it felt like smartphones weren't as intrusive.
[01:37:13.260 --> 01:37:14.640]   - Yeah.
[01:37:14.640 --> 01:37:18.600]   - One final question and maybe a request
[01:37:18.600 --> 01:37:23.020]   as the new incoming Dean of College of Letters and Sciences.
[01:37:23.020 --> 01:37:26.200]   And I must say, I'm delighted, thrilled, actually,
[01:37:26.200 --> 01:37:28.360]   to hear that a lot of the practices
[01:37:28.360 --> 01:37:30.720]   that we've been discussing today and that you've pioneered
[01:37:30.720 --> 01:37:33.280]   are going to be incorporated into undergraduate education.
[01:37:33.280 --> 01:37:35.520]   I predict and I'd be willing to wager
[01:37:35.520 --> 01:37:38.840]   that that will become a template for how universities
[01:37:38.840 --> 01:37:41.600]   and non-university systems should function
[01:37:41.600 --> 01:37:44.800]   because if indeed, and it is true
[01:37:44.800 --> 01:37:47.320]   that there's this incredible relationship
[01:37:47.320 --> 01:37:51.120]   between physical movement and mental deliberate practices
[01:37:51.120 --> 01:37:55.400]   and performance, any corporation, school, household
[01:37:55.400 --> 01:37:59.180]   would be crazy, would be self-limiting
[01:37:59.180 --> 01:38:02.040]   and even self-destructive to not incorporate those.
[01:38:02.040 --> 01:38:05.240]   I'm so happy that you're gonna do this and collect data.
[01:38:05.240 --> 01:38:06.960]   Please, we'll have to touch back with you
[01:38:06.960 --> 01:38:09.520]   and hear what comes of that.
[01:38:09.520 --> 01:38:13.080]   But one of the main things that I hear so much about today
[01:38:13.080 --> 01:38:15.280]   are issues with attention.
[01:38:15.280 --> 01:38:16.360]   And we haven't talked about attention.
[01:38:16.360 --> 01:38:18.400]   We've mainly been talking about memory and cognition.
[01:38:18.400 --> 01:38:19.240]   - Yes, yes.
[01:38:19.240 --> 01:38:20.900]   - But you know a lot about attention.
[01:38:20.900 --> 01:38:24.240]   And here, I'm not being disparaging.
[01:38:24.240 --> 01:38:26.560]   I think people have done what I'm about to say
[01:38:26.560 --> 01:38:30.760]   as a consequence of need and lack of other resources.
[01:38:30.760 --> 01:38:33.280]   There's an immense amount of Adderall use,
[01:38:33.280 --> 01:38:36.360]   Ritalin use, modafinil use, and caffeine abuse.
[01:38:36.360 --> 01:38:37.880]   Now, I happen to like caffeine.
[01:38:37.880 --> 01:38:40.640]   I don't use the other compounds I described.
[01:38:40.640 --> 01:38:44.320]   But it's just incredible to me how the data on this,
[01:38:44.320 --> 01:38:46.600]   a colleague of mine at Stanford claims that
[01:38:46.600 --> 01:38:49.480]   something like two-thirds or more of college students
[01:38:49.480 --> 01:38:52.360]   use these without prescription for ADHD.
[01:38:52.360 --> 01:38:58.480]   What can we expect in terms of the effects
[01:38:58.480 --> 01:39:00.520]   of regular exercise on attention?
[01:39:00.520 --> 01:39:03.000]   And are there any other things besides exercise
[01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.300]   and meditation that you would like to see people do
[01:39:05.300 --> 01:39:07.960]   in terms of trying to increase their powers of attention?
[01:39:07.960 --> 01:39:11.400]   Because I think the ability to focus and attend
[01:39:11.400 --> 01:39:13.640]   is really the distinguishing feature
[01:39:13.640 --> 01:39:16.400]   between those that will succeed in any endeavor
[01:39:16.400 --> 01:39:18.000]   and those that won't.
[01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:19.920]   And that's a scary thing for a lot of people to hear
[01:39:19.920 --> 01:39:22.240]   because a lot of people think they have ADHD.
[01:39:22.240 --> 01:39:23.680]   They may, they may not.
[01:39:23.680 --> 01:39:26.300]   But I bet that a number of students at both Stanford
[01:39:26.300 --> 01:39:30.940]   and NYU feel challenged with holding their attention
[01:39:30.940 --> 01:39:32.840]   to the thing that they need to hold their attention to.
[01:39:32.840 --> 01:39:34.040]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:39:34.040 --> 01:39:39.040]   So I would say the top three tools that everybody
[01:39:39.040 --> 01:39:44.040]   right this minute today can use to up their capacity
[01:39:44.040 --> 01:39:48.080]   to attend where they want to include exercise
[01:39:48.080 --> 01:39:49.360]   for the reasons we've talked about.
[01:39:49.360 --> 01:39:50.700]   It has a direct effect on
[01:39:50.700 --> 01:39:52.180]   functioning of the prefrontal cortex.
[01:39:52.180 --> 01:39:55.140]   Meditation also, clear clinical studies
[01:39:55.140 --> 01:39:58.260]   showing improved ability to focus
[01:39:58.260 --> 01:40:01.600]   and particularly focus on the present moment.
[01:40:01.600 --> 01:40:03.760]   And the third has to be sleep.
[01:40:03.760 --> 01:40:08.740]   So sleep is, you can't, it's out of the three,
[01:40:08.740 --> 01:40:11.000]   it is the most physiological.
[01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.540]   I mean, I could live my whole life
[01:40:13.540 --> 01:40:15.640]   without meditating one minute.
[01:40:15.640 --> 01:40:17.680]   Could I survive without sleep?
[01:40:17.680 --> 01:40:19.280]   No, none of us could.
[01:40:19.280 --> 01:40:22.320]   So it's more basic physiological.
[01:40:22.320 --> 01:40:27.320]   But it is so important for all core cognitive functions,
[01:40:27.320 --> 01:40:32.780]   including attention, including creativity,
[01:40:32.780 --> 01:40:37.780]   including just good basic brain function.
[01:40:37.780 --> 01:40:46.660]   That is why it's so critical to get that information,
[01:40:46.660 --> 01:40:49.540]   that basic neuroscience information
[01:40:49.540 --> 01:40:51.660]   into the heads of these students
[01:40:51.660 --> 01:40:55.660]   that are trying their best to show us how their brain work,
[01:40:55.660 --> 01:41:00.300]   but being hampered because they're not moving enough,
[01:41:00.300 --> 01:41:03.700]   they're not meditating and there's all these
[01:41:03.700 --> 01:41:06.720]   distracting things that they include in their lives,
[01:41:06.720 --> 01:41:09.260]   some of which a little bit is good,
[01:41:09.260 --> 01:41:14.260]   but 24 hours a day on your phone and LinkedIn,
[01:41:14.260 --> 01:41:16.680]   not LinkedIn, but linked to your phone
[01:41:16.680 --> 01:41:20.800]   is damaging to your attention.
[01:41:20.800 --> 01:41:25.800]   So exercise, meditation, sleep can help you learn,
[01:41:27.140 --> 01:41:30.460]   retain and perform better
[01:41:30.460 --> 01:41:33.980]   than if you do not have these three things in your life.
[01:41:33.980 --> 01:41:34.820]   - Wonderful.
[01:41:34.820 --> 01:41:39.820]   Music to my ears and also either very low cost or zero cost,
[01:41:39.820 --> 01:41:43.820]   considering that the exercise doesn't require a class.
[01:41:43.820 --> 01:41:48.820]   One could use the freely available resource of gravity
[01:41:48.820 --> 01:41:52.860]   to do jumping jacks or burpees or push-ups or whatever,
[01:41:52.860 --> 01:41:54.180]   or sit-ups or all of those in combination.
[01:41:54.180 --> 01:41:55.220]   - And don't forget YouTube,
[01:41:55.220 --> 01:41:59.340]   the freely accessible millions of YouTube videos,
[01:41:59.340 --> 01:42:02.400]   if you don't want to do your jumping jacks by yourself,
[01:42:02.400 --> 01:42:05.220]   I always say this, I talk about breath meditation
[01:42:05.220 --> 01:42:08.220]   for my book, "Good Anxiety,"
[01:42:08.220 --> 01:42:11.180]   and if you don't like the one that I suggest,
[01:42:11.180 --> 01:42:13.180]   there's only about a million more on YouTube
[01:42:13.180 --> 01:42:16.100]   with ratings from one star to five stars,
[01:42:16.100 --> 01:42:18.380]   so use that resource.
[01:42:18.380 --> 01:42:20.180]   - It is a wonderful resource.
[01:42:20.180 --> 01:42:23.100]   And you are an amazing resource.
[01:42:23.100 --> 01:42:26.020]   Wendy, thank you so much for coming here today
[01:42:26.020 --> 01:42:28.880]   to have this discussion and share your knowledge
[01:42:28.880 --> 01:42:30.820]   about not just existing data,
[01:42:30.820 --> 01:42:33.440]   but new data coming out soon,
[01:42:33.440 --> 01:42:37.500]   and for your leadership in the university system,
[01:42:37.500 --> 01:42:39.340]   for your leadership in public education,
[01:42:39.340 --> 01:42:41.580]   for the decades of important work
[01:42:41.580 --> 01:42:43.260]   on memory and neural circuitry,
[01:42:43.260 --> 01:42:46.740]   which we got to learn about today as well.
[01:42:46.740 --> 01:42:48.300]   Thank you ever so much.
[01:42:48.300 --> 01:42:49.480]   - Thank you, Andrew.
[01:42:49.480 --> 01:42:51.100]   Fun conversation.
[01:42:51.100 --> 01:42:52.140]   - Thank you for joining me today
[01:42:52.140 --> 01:42:54.140]   for my discussion about learning and memory
[01:42:54.140 --> 01:42:56.260]   and how to get better at learning and remembering
[01:42:56.260 --> 01:42:57.920]   with Dr. Wendy Suzuki.
[01:42:57.920 --> 01:43:00.220]   If you'd like to learn more about Dr. Suzuki's work,

[01:43:51.080 --> 01:43:53.020]   On many episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[01:43:53.020 --> 01:43:54.460]   we discuss supplements.
[01:43:54.460 --> 01:43:57.220]   While supplements are certainly not necessary for everybody,
[01:43:57.220 --> 01:43:59.620]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[01:43:59.620 --> 01:44:02.940]   for things like accelerating the transition into sleep
[01:44:02.940 --> 01:44:04.620]   and getting better, deeper sleep,
[01:44:04.620 --> 01:44:06.960]   as well as enhancing focus and learning
[01:44:06.960 --> 01:44:10.100]   and other aspects of human performance and health.
[01:44:10.100 --> 01:44:11.140]   We're excited to announce
[01:44:11.140 --> 01:44:13.700]   that we've partnered with Momentous Supplements.
[01:44:13.700 --> 01:44:16.520]   The reason we partnered with Momentous is several-fold.
[01:44:16.520 --> 01:44:19.020]   First of all, we wanted to have one location
[01:44:19.020 --> 01:44:21.020]   where Huberman Lab Podcast listeners could go
[01:44:21.020 --> 01:44:24.240]   in order to find all the supplements that we talk about
[01:44:24.240 --> 01:44:26.060]   and to find those in a form
[01:44:26.060 --> 01:44:28.920]   where they could systematically try one or the other.
[01:44:28.920 --> 01:44:30.580]   This is a real issue in the supplement industry.
[01:44:30.580 --> 01:44:31.980]   A lot of supplement brands out there
[01:44:31.980 --> 01:44:33.980]   combine different ingredients in ways
[01:44:33.980 --> 01:44:36.660]   that don't really allow you to pinpoint exactly what you need
[01:44:36.660 --> 01:44:38.100]   and what you don't need.
[01:44:38.100 --> 01:44:41.960]   So getting supplements that have low doses
[01:44:41.960 --> 01:44:45.340]   or just the minimal effective dose of particular ingredients
[01:44:45.340 --> 01:44:47.960]   and being able to mix and match those ingredients yourself
[01:44:47.960 --> 01:44:51.240]   and really establish what's best for you is really key.
[01:44:51.240 --> 01:44:52.520]   In addition, we came to realize
[01:44:52.520 --> 01:44:54.280]   that a lot of our listeners want supplements,
[01:44:54.280 --> 01:44:56.740]   but they reside outside of the United States.
[01:44:56.740 --> 01:44:58.600]   So we're pleased to tell you that Momentous ships
[01:44:58.600 --> 01:45:01.080]   both within the US and internationally.
[01:45:01.080 --> 01:45:02.940]   And of course, Momentous Supplements
[01:45:02.940 --> 01:45:05.280]   are of the very highest quality ingredients.
[01:45:05.280 --> 01:45:07.840]   And the precision of the amounts of those ingredients
[01:45:07.840 --> 01:45:09.360]   is tightly regulated.
[01:45:09.360 --> 01:45:11.360]   If you're interested in Momentous Supplements,
[01:45:11.360 --> 01:45:13.080]   the catalog of supplements related
[01:45:13.080 --> 01:45:16.440]   to the Huberman Lab Podcast are growing all the time.
[01:45:16.440 --> 01:45:18.080]   A good number of them are already there.
[01:45:18.080 --> 01:45:20.840]   You can go to livemomentous.com/huberman
[01:45:20.840 --> 01:45:22.120]   in order to find them.
[01:45:22.120 --> 01:45:24.080]   And there will be additional supplements
[01:45:24.080 --> 01:45:26.360]   added to that site as we go forward.
[01:45:26.360 --> 01:45:28.260]   If you're not already following Huberman Lab
[01:45:28.260 --> 01:45:30.060]   on Twitter and Instagram,
[01:45:30.060 --> 01:45:33.520]   I post neuroscience and other science-related information
[01:45:33.520 --> 01:45:35.720]   and tools on a regular basis.
[01:45:35.720 --> 01:45:37.160]   Some of that information overlaps
[01:45:37.160 --> 01:45:39.280]   with the content of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[01:45:39.280 --> 01:45:41.400]   but a lot of it is distinct from the information contained
[01:45:41.400 --> 01:45:43.060]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[01:45:43.060 --> 01:45:45.320]   So again, that's Huberman Lab on Instagram
[01:45:45.320 --> 01:45:47.280]   and Huberman Lab on Twitter.
[01:45:47.280 --> 01:45:50.100]   We also have a neural network newsletter.
[01:45:50.100 --> 01:45:51.920]   What that is is a monthly newsletter
[01:45:51.920 --> 01:45:54.520]   in which I distill critical points
[01:45:54.520 --> 01:45:56.080]   from different podcast episodes,
[01:45:56.080 --> 01:45:57.880]   provide links to useful resources.
[01:45:57.880 --> 01:45:59.320]   If you want to sign up for that newsletter,
[01:45:59.320 --> 01:46:00.960]   I should mention it is zero cost
[01:46:00.960 --> 01:46:02.880]   and we do not share your email with anybody.
[01:46:02.880 --> 01:46:05.920]   And we have a very clear privacy policy posted
[01:46:05.920 --> 01:46:07.080]   at HubermanLab.com.
[01:46:07.080 --> 01:46:10.240]   Just go to HubermanLab.com, click on the menu,
[01:46:10.240 --> 01:46:11.840]   you'll see the neural network newsletter.
[01:46:11.840 --> 01:46:13.800]   You can also look at examples of newsletters
[01:46:13.800 --> 01:46:15.160]   without having to sign up to make sure
[01:46:15.160 --> 01:46:17.360]   that you actually do want to sign up.
[01:46:17.360 --> 01:46:20.880]   But if you are interested, the signup is there, very easy,
[01:46:20.880 --> 01:46:22.880]   and you can receive our monthly newsletter.
[01:46:22.880 --> 01:46:25.080]   So once again, thank you for joining me today
[01:46:25.080 --> 01:46:28.480]   for our voyage into the neuroscience of learning and memory
[01:46:28.480 --> 01:46:31.000]   and tools to get better at learning and memory.
[01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:34.040]   And as always, thank you for your interest in science.
[01:46:34.040 --> 01:46:36.620]   [upbeat music]
