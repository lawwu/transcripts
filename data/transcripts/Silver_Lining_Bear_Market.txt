[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.860]   Hello, everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai.
[00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:09.200]   And in this episode, I want to talk about the best silver lining from this bear market.
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.800]   And the best silver lining from this bear market is that it's easier to generate more
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.760]   passive income in a bear market.
[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.420]   You know, obviously, it stinks to lose money in a bear market, whether it's paper losses
[00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.160]   or real losses.
[00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.080]   But the positive really is that we can all generate more passive income.
[00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.820]   And given we can all generate more passive income more easily, we can also get that much
[00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.720]   closer to financial freedom.
[00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.900]   And if you are already financially free, the definition of having enough passive income
[00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:44.680]   to cover your living expenses, then this extra passive income provides just an additional
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.560]   buffer to stay free.
[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.360]   The 2022 bear market is clearly caused by the Fed.
[00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.200]   The Fed should have probably hiked a little bit in 2021, and then more in 2022.
[00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.800]   So it would be more gradual and less sharp and jolting.
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.000]   But what's done is done.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.960]   Interest rates go up to counteract inflation, risk asset prices go down.
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.240]   Pretty simple, because higher interest rates mean there's a greater discount rate of future
[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.200]   cash flows, which reduces the value, the present value of a company today.
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.400]   But here's the thing, folks, when interest rates go up, everything from bond yields to
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.080]   dividend yields also tend to go up.
[00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.400]   And the reason why is because every yield is relative to the risk-free rate of return.
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:36.600]   And the risk-free rate of return is the 10-year government bond yield, which is over 4% today.
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.360]   Back in March 2020, it was about 0.6%.
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:47.160]   So it's clearly risen a lot, a lot over the past 12 to 18 months in particular.
[00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:53.400]   No rational investor would invest in a risk asset if they could get a higher or equal
[00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.480]   risk-free rate of return.
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.000]   To take on risk, you need an equity risk premium.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.200]   Otherwise, you just wouldn't bother.
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.280]   As a result, investors should be able to generate more easily passive income when interest rates
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.560]   are higher.
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.720]   Let's look at corporations, for example.
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.400]   They issue bonds to raise capital to pay for operating expenses, maybe acquisitions, and
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.520]   maybe just to boost their balance sheet, especially when interest rates are low, because that
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.920]   means they pay a lower interest rate.
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:28.200]   However, to stay competitive with government bond yields, they need to pay a higher coupon
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.200]   rate.
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.840]   Otherwise, people would just buy risk-free treasury bonds.
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.720]   Corporations may also have to increase their dividend payout ratios to increase stock dividend
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.120]   yields as well.
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:46.800]   Again, and that is to attract that capital to buy that stock, because the alternative
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.320]   looks much, much better now with risk-free rates higher.
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:57.760]   In regards to real estate, cap rates need to go up to make the property more attractive
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.840]   compared to the risk-free rate of return.
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.320]   Let's say the risk-free rate of return, again, is, let's say, 4.1%.
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:10.440]   If the cap rate is at 3%, I mean, why would you bother buying a rental property if you
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:16.080]   can only get a 3% rate of return when you can do nothing and earn 4.1%?
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:21.400]   Everybody who is a landlord knows that managing tenants, managing maintenance issues can be
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.400]   a hassle.
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.440]   So, we need to be rewarded for that hassle with a higher cap rate.
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:33.080]   So, if rents don't go higher to generate a higher cap rate, then property prices should
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.520]   adjust downward.
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.800]   This is just natural market forces at work.
[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:43.000]   In general, landlords are a big beneficiary of inflation over the long term as real estate
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.360]   prices and rents increase.
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.360]   Inflation acts as a tailwind.
[00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:53.240]   However, in this case, inflation has gone up way too quickly, and it's resulted in higher
[00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.760]   Fed funds rates, higher interest rates hikes.
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:02.820]   If the Fed didn't raise rates, then actually, probably property prices and rent prices would
[00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:08.760]   continue to go at pretty gangbuster rates, and then that would be a detriment to the
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.140]   majority of the population who are not rental property owners.
[00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.240]   That would just be bad for the middle class.
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:20.320]   So what I've just described here is the crowding out of private capital.
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.800]   This is an economic term, crowding out, where higher interest rates on the risk-free rate
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:32.080]   of return crowds out the capital that would have gone to the private sector, to companies,
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:38.640]   and now is going to the public sector or treasury bonds because they're more attractive on a
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:39.640]   relative basis.
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:46.120]   In the past, I would regularly invest majority of my cash flow in the S&P 500 and in private
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.120]   real estate funds.
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:52.600]   Those are the two investments, risk assets that I like to invest to earn 100% passive
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.940]   income.
[00:04:53.940 --> 00:05:00.440]   These two types of investments generated yields of between, let's say, 1.5% with the S&P 500
[00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:07.000]   dividend yield when it was 25% higher and 10% on average with private real estate.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.960]   However, now with higher interest rates, government bonds are crowding out private capital, my
[00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.440]   private capital.
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:18.080]   Instead of mostly investing my cash flow in the S&P 500 and private real estate funds,
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.880]   I've earmarked 60% of my cash towards buying treasury bonds.
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:28.120]   And hopefully you read that article that I wrote talking about treasury bond buying strategies.
[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:33.120]   I think there's probably like a 70% chance that the 10-year treasury bond has peaked
[00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.880]   at 4.3% and is going to roll over.
[00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:40.680]   So it's something to think about locking in one, two, three-year treasury bonds at 4%
[00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.080]   for your treasury bond asset allocation or for your cash allocation.
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.120]   I think that's pretty smart.
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:54.520]   But 40% is still being invested in risk assets, right, if I'm investing 60% in risk-free assets.
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:06:00.240]   But that percentage before the interest rate hikes used to be closer to 80%, 90% of my
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:04.100]   cash flow in cash were being invested in risk assets.
[00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.640]   So it's clearly come down to 60%.
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:12.040]   Might come down even more depending on what interest rates do.
[00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:16.040]   If you click over to the post on generating more passive income in a bear market, you'll
[00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:24.180]   see this really great chart that shows the two-year treasury yield now 280 basis points
[00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:28.200]   higher than the S&P 500 dividend yield.
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:33.760]   So again, as an investor, you're deciding, should I invest in stocks with like a 1.8%
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:40.480]   dividend yield now or should I invest in a two-year treasury bond that's yielding 280
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:44.920]   basis points higher, 2%, 3%, 4.5%, something like that.
[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:49.760]   And I think obviously more investors are going to shift some of their capital to risk-free
[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:52.680]   4.5% treasury bond yield.
[00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:53.680]   It just makes sense.
[00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.500]   It's because everything is relative to something else.
[00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:02.200]   The other interesting thing is the money that could have gone or would have gone to growth
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:08.680]   stocks, which have just gotten crushed in 2022, now is also probably more going towards
[00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:15.280]   higher yielding bonds or higher yielding stocks because there's fear, there's uncertainty,
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.080]   who knows about interest rates.
[00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:22.840]   And so people don't want to chase high value growth because growth is getting crushed.
[00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:28.080]   One real-time example is Alphabet, a parent company of Google, reporting third quarter
[00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:32.340]   2022 results today after the close, October 25th.
[00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:37.400]   And they missed on the top line and the bottom line, and their margins are shrinking, and
[00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:39.960]   they're just losing to TikTok.
[00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:41.440]   And it's not looking that good, right?
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:46.800]   Google used to be the ultimate growth stock, and now the stock is down, what, 5% to 8%
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.360]   after hours.
[00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:52.600]   And so people are wondering, OK, Google, you're not growing as fast as you are.
[00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:54.940]   You have a huge market cap.
[00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:58.040]   Should you start paying a bigger dividend or a dividend?
[00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:01.880]   That's probably something they're considering now, given that they have huge cash flow and
[00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:03.660]   a large balance sheet.
[00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:08.760]   But look, you can lose literally 5% to 8% of your money on Google stock if you had bought
[00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:12.100]   yesterday and then they reported results, right?
[00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:15.400]   So this is a risk, and this is a risk that we all know about.
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:19.880]   And there's more risk with growth stocks than dividend yielding stocks.
[00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:25.900]   And then there's more risk with dividend yielding stocks versus holding treasury bonds.
[00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:32.060]   So whether you want to invest in treasury bonds, municipal bonds, corporate bonds, stocks
[00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:37.920]   that pay a dividend, yields are all going up because it's all relative to the risk-free
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:39.360]   rate of return.
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:44.520]   Now some of you, I've seen the comments on Facebook, on Financial Samurai, saying, oh,
[00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:49.920]   well, if you buy a bond at a 4.5% yield, you're still losing in real terms, right, because
[00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:51.480]   inflation is at 8%.
[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:54.760]   So you're losing negative 3.5% of buying power.
[00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:58.280]   Well, sure, yes, that is a loss in real terms.
[00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:03.480]   However, making a nominal return, let's say 4.5%, is still better than actually losing
[00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:04.480]   money.
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:08.800]   Wouldn't you rather make 4.5% versus losing, let's say, 25% in the stock market year to
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:10.060]   date so far?
[00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:12.040]   Of course you would rather, right?
[00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:17.520]   I mean, thank goodness we put $10,000 each in IBONZ at the end of 2021.
[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:21.480]   We did another $10,000 at the beginning of 2022.
[00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:26.400]   That has saved us, but too bad those are the limits, $10,000 per person per account.
[00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:32.520]   So moving forward, if you're not buying a Treasury bond yielding 4.5% risk-free, and
[00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:39.480]   you're buying stocks or any other risk asset, then that means that over the next 12 months,
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:42.920]   you believe that risk asset will return greater than 4.5%.
[00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:45.080]   Otherwise you shouldn't be buying it.
[00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:50.400]   Now of course, nobody knows the future for certain at all, which is why we diversify.
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:55.400]   So for me, as a semi-retiree, I call myself a fake retiree because I'm still generating
[00:09:55.400 --> 00:10:01.880]   cash flow online, I have shifted 60% of my cash flow to risk-free assets.
[00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:02.880]   4.5%?
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:03.880]   Pretty good.
[00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:06.720]   My target is 5% to 10% returns a year.
[00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:10.640]   So 4.5% is almost there just with no risk and do nothing.
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:11.640]   Awesome.
[00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:17.960]   And I've got 40% still in risk assets because I still think we should be buying stocks after
[00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:23.640]   25% decline, so you're nibbling on real estate if you've seen some opportunity.
[00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:27.360]   And over the long run, stocks and real estate tend to do well.
[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:34.200]   But the risk is over the next three to five years, maybe a decade, the returns for stocks
[00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.440]   might not be as good.
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:39.560]   But the good thing is you've read Financial Samra, you've listened to this podcast, we
[00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:43.120]   talked about lower expected returns.
[00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:45.480]   We talked about Vanguard's forecast.
[00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:48.160]   We talked about Goldman's, Bank of America's.
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:54.320]   They're talking about 4% per annum stock returns and bond returns of like 2% to 3%.
[00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:59.640]   And so far, that's probably going to be correct because we had a terrible 2022 so far.
[00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:02.880]   So don't confuse brains with a bull market.
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:04.480]   These things go in cycles.
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:07.200]   You have to diversify, but you also have to invest for the long term.
[00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:14.240]   All right, finally, I need you all to calculate how much more passive investment income you
[00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:17.240]   can generate over the next 12 months.
[00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:22.360]   Do some performance analysis, see what your savings rate is, how much you're going to
[00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:23.700]   save every month.
[00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:27.440]   What if you invested in various types of assets?
[00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:29.240]   How much more do you think you can generate?
[00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:34.520]   I think you could probably generate, well, actually, it depends on how big your investment
[00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:37.400]   amount is currently and what your cash flow is.
[00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:42.200]   So from my perspective, I know I can boost my overall passive income by about 10% or
[00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:44.620]   about $35,000.
[00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:50.080]   The increases are mainly coming from treasury bonds, private real estate investments, and
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:52.440]   rental property income.
[00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:57.840]   So far, I've invested $250,000 in treasury bonds, so that should generate another $11,250
[00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:59.200]   a year.
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:06.560]   My Sunbelt rental property income is rising from about $50,000 a year to $60,000 a year.
[00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:09.600]   Given higher mortgage rates are pushing more people to rent.
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:15.120]   Check out Fundrise, financialsamurai.com/fundrise for more.
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:20.520]   My Lake Tahoe vacation property, which has been a dog since 2007 when I bought it, right
[00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:22.640]   before everything collapsed.
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:27.560]   I was just putting into my estimates $500 net rental income a month.
[00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:32.840]   But since there are no more COVID restrictions, tourism is booming again, right?
[00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:37.720]   I went twice myself over the summer and it was pretty busy.
[00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:45.280]   So that rental income has gone from $500 to $650 a month to about $1,500 a month and sometimes
[00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:46.280]   a lot more.
[00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:48.860]   I'm just trying to average them out.
[00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:54.320]   And then finally, I've got one rental property where I've boosted rental income from $6,700
[00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:55.320]   to $8,000.
[00:12:55.320 --> 00:13:01.220]   $300 of that is probably due to the market, while $1,000 of that is due to a rebuttal.
[00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:03.840]   And then finally, I have venture debt investments.
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:09.680]   I'm just submitting my capital calls every single time there is a capital call.
[00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:15.620]   As a venture debt investor, you also benefit from higher interest rates because the return
[00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:19.040]   is also pegged off the risk-free rate plus a markup.
[00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:24.800]   So please run a performance analysis on your current passive investment income and how
[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:26.200]   much more you can generate.
[00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:29.040]   This is really the silver lining of the bear market.
[00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:34.080]   If things don't get too bad, in other words, if the S&P 500 doesn't decline by more than
[00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:41.920]   35% from peak to drop-- so we're talking about 3,000, 3,200 S&P 500-- there probably won't
[00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:44.120]   be tremendous amount of layoffs.
[00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:49.960]   The global financial crisis is like right now minus another 20% down.
[00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:54.260]   And then all of your friends are getting laid off left and right every single week.
[00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:55.520]   That was the global financial crisis.
[00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:57.280]   So we're not there yet.
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:59.000]   And I don't think we're going to get there.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.400]   It doesn't feel nearly as bad.
[00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:06.480]   Once the bull market returns-- maybe that's in 12 months, 18 months, who knows?
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:12.360]   Maybe it's two years-- investment yields will likely go down as asset prices rise.
[00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:15.920]   In such a scenario, you're still making the same amount or more in passive investment
[00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:16.920]   income.
[00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:21.880]   However, your portfolio value has gone up, which is going to be obviously the best of
[00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:23.240]   both worlds.
[00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:29.840]   So so long as you have regular cash flow and things don't get too bad, you're always winning.
[00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:35.640]   Because your net worth, your portfolio value is pretty subjective now, right?
[00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:41.360]   One day it was worth x, and now the next day it's worth x minus 25%.
[00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:47.380]   And in some companies, x minus 90% is just devastation with some companies.
[00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:50.800]   But if you can focus on your cash flow, that's what matters most.
[00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:56.320]   And you will realize that matters most when you no longer have a steady paycheck.
[00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:59.280]   If you don't have a job, you don't have a pension.
[00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:01.520]   That's basically what I'm experiencing right now.
[00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:05.720]   I really have focused on cash flow generation.
[00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:08.040]   The net worth growth feels great when it's going up.
[00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:10.620]   It doesn't feel as good when it's going down.
[00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:16.580]   But really, trying to manage and keep sticky and grow that passive income is what we should
[00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:18.120]   all be focused on.
[00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:23.760]   If you're still working day job and you're investing in growth stocks, even dividend
[00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:30.680]   stocks, this bear market is a good reminder to start selling down some of your risk assets
[00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:37.640]   and shifting it to risk-free assets probably three to five years before then.
[00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:39.000]   You want to kind of chop it up.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.120]   You don't want to miss the bull run.
[00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:45.720]   But at the same time, you don't want to just be like, oh, I plan to retire in 2022.
[00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:50.880]   And then boom, you've got a 25% hit to your stock portfolio.
[00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:53.840]   Depending on when you bought your real estate, your real estate portfolio is probably going
[00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:57.920]   to fade 5% to 20% over the next 12 to 18 months.
[00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:04.120]   You don't know for sure, which is why you need to shift those risk assets to risk-free
[00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:08.280]   or lower risk assets the closer you get to retirement.
[00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:09.280]   All right.
[00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:14.500]   And speaking of retirement, if you want a great software to help you retire better,
[00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:20.600]   to go through the nitty gritty, to see many type of what-if scenarios, check out New Retirement.
[00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:24.800]   You can go to financialsamurai.com/nr.
[00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:28.080]   It's really one of the best retirement planning tools out there.
[00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:31.000]   And it's specifically for retirement.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.680]   Also, shout out to Fundrise.
[00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:39.120]   Fundrise posted their third quarter 2022 year-to-date returns.
[00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:46.800]   And all clients are up 5.4% versus public REITs down 28.34% and public stocks, the S&P
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:48.940]   500, down about 24%.
[00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:50.980]   That's through the third quarter.
[00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:56.780]   This outperformance in a bear market is one of the main reasons why I invest in private
[00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:57.780]   real estate.
[00:16:57.780 --> 00:17:06.340]   In 2018, Fundrise, all clients, the portfolio was up 8.81% versus public REITs down 4.1%
[00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:09.420]   and public stocks down 4.38%.
[00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:15.780]   So when you're investing and you want to diversify, you want to invest in things that zig when
[00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:17.740]   others zag, right?
[00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:20.460]   And so this is what Fundrise has been able to do.
[00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:24.260]   So now you've got two really good years of outperformance during down years in the stock
[00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:25.500]   market.
[00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:30.760]   And I expect this type of outperformance to continue when the stock market is down because
[00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:32.540]   Fundrise is vertically integrated.
[00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:35.780]   They invest in undervalued properties in the Sunbelt.
[00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:39.840]   They buy and hold properties for rental income, which is much stickier.
[00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:44.420]   They buy and rehabilitate properties to boost property values and rents.
[00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:49.020]   They have an experienced managed team that is able to identify strong buying opportunities.
[00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:53.620]   And they're also easily able to raise funds to purchase properties with cash at a great
[00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:54.620]   price.
[00:17:54.620 --> 00:18:01.780]   So again, if you want to check out Fundrise, go to financialsamurai.com/fundrise.
