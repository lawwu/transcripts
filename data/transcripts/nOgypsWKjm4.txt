[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.700]   where we discuss science
[00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.940]   and science-based tools for everyday life.
[00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.400]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.560]   and I'm a Professor of Neurobiology and Ophthalmology
[00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.480]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.880]   My guest today is Dr. Martha Beck.
[00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.680]   Dr. Martha Beck did her undergraduate master's
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.480]   and PhD training at Harvard University.
[00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.960]   She is also considered one of the foremost experts
[00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.600]   in the personal development field,
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.880]   having authored many best-selling books,
[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.960]   including her upcoming book, "Beyond Anxiety,"
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.400]   "Curiosity, Creativity, and Finding Your Life's Purpose."
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.560]   I must say that today's discussion is a truly special one.
[00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.760]   I've long benefited from Martha's teachings,
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.120]   and I assure you that during today's episode,
[00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.680]   you will benefit from Martha's teachings.
[00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.120]   She describes and we explore practices in real time
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.160]   that will allow you to truly understand
[00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.800]   what is most important to you
[00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.480]   and what you ought to spend your time pursuing.
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.040]   You will hear a rich discussion
[00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.400]   about how to frame the thoughts and the emotions
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.440]   around any topic, including pain points in life,
[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.520]   as well as your goals
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.600]   and the things that you are in pursuit of.
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.280]   You will also learn how to figure out
[00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.680]   exactly what is most essential to you
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.480]   and indeed how to explore
[00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.360]   what Dr. Martha Beck calls your essential self,
[00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.480]   those deep-rooted desires that are unique to you
[00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:20.600]   and your history
[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.280]   and what will make your life most fulfilling.
[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.520]   By the end of today's episode,
[00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.840]   you will be armed with new intellectual
[00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.440]   and practical knowledge,
[00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.200]   and you will be able to adopt the best possible stance
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.340]   for you as you navigate forward in your life.
[00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.160]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.760]   that this podcast is separate
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.000]   from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.200]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.180]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.360]   about science and science-related tools
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.760]   to the general public.
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.040]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.960]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.960]   Our first sponsor is BetterHelp.
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.880]   BetterHelp offers professional therapy
[00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.600]   with a licensed therapist carried out entirely online.
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.620]   Now, I've been doing weekly therapy for well over 30 years.
[00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:03.960]   Initially, I didn't have a choice.
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.560]   It was a condition of being allowed to stay in high school,
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.200]   but pretty soon I realized that doing regular therapy
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.320]   is extremely important to our overall health.
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.640]   There are essentially three things
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:13.920]   that go into great therapy.
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.000]   First of all, you need to have great rapport
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.100]   with a therapist,
[00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.680]   so you need to be comfortable with that person.
[00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.420]   You need to be able to trust them and talk to them
[00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.360]   about all the issues that are relevant to you.
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.240]   Second, and this is what people normally think of
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.020]   when they think of a great therapist,
[00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.800]   that therapist needs to provide you support
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.400]   in the form of emotional support or directed guidance.
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.240]   And third, excellent therapy
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.280]   has to provide very useful insights,
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.540]   insights that you can apply to be better,
[00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.160]   not just in your emotional life, in your relationship life,
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.400]   but also your relationship to yourself.
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.800]   BetterHelp makes it extremely easy
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.120]   to find an excellent therapist for you,
[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.480]   one with whom you resonate with,
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.720]   have excellent rapport with,
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:49.680]   and that can give you
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.980]   those three essential benefits of therapy.
[00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.360]   If you'd like to try BetterHelp,
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.000]   go to betterhelp.com/huberman
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.080]   to get 10% off your first month.

[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.520]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep.
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.360]   Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.260]   that are customized to your unique sleep needs.
[00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.660]   I've spoken many times before on this and other podcasts
[00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.080]   about the fact that getting a great night's sleep
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.640]   is the foundation of mental health,
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.160]   physical health, and performance.
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.560]   Now, the mattress we sleep on makes an enormous difference
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.020]   in terms of the quality of sleep that we get each night.
[00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.840]   We need a mattress that is matched
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.600]   to our unique sleep needs,
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.200]   one that is neither too soft nor too hard for you,
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.640]   one that breathes well,
[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.460]   and that won't be too warm or too cold for you.
[00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:33.940]   If you go to the Helix website,
[00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:35.440]   you can take a brief two-minute quiz,
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.160]   and it asks you questions such as,
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.920]   do you sleep on your back, your side, or your stomach?
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.000]   Do you tend to run hot or cold during the night?
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.320]   Things of that sort.
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.160]   Maybe you know the answers to those questions,
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.000]   maybe you don't.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.400]   Either way, Helix will match you
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.020]   to the ideal mattress for you.
[00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:51.080]   For me, that turned out to be the Dusk mattress, D-U-S-K.
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.540]   I've been sleeping on a Dusk mattress for, gosh,
[00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.300]   no, more than four years,
[00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:56.580]   and the sleep that I've been getting
[00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.700]   is absolutely phenomenal.
[00:03:58.700 --> 00:03:59.920]   If you'd like to try Helix,
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.820]   you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman,
[00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.460]   take that brief two-minute sleep quiz,
[00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:06.280]   and Helix will match you to a mattress
[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.660]   that is customized to your unique sleep needs.
[00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:12.060]   Right now, Helix is giving up to 25% off mattresses
[00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.220]   and two free pillows.
[00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.340]   Again, that's helixsleep.com/huberman
[00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:19.220]   to get 25% off and two free pillows.
[00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.940]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Element.
[00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:23.420]   Element is an electrolyte drink
[00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:25.980]   that has everything you need and nothing you don't.
[00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:27.300]   That means the electrolytes,
[00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.560]   sodium, magnesium, and potassium,
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.820]   in the correct ratios, but no sugar.
[00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:33.300]   Now, proper hydration is critical
[00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.980]   for the optimal functioning of all the cells in your body,
[00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:39.300]   and that's especially true for the neurons, the nerve cells.
[00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.660]   In fact, we know that even a slight degree of dehydration
[00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.300]   can diminish both cognitive and physical performance.
[00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.260]   So to make sure that I'm getting proper hydration
[00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:47.380]   and electrolytes,
[00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.540]   I personally dissolve one packet of Element
[00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.880]   in about 16 to 32 ounces of water
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.100]   when I first wake up in the morning,
[00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:54.820]   and I drink that or sip that
[00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.020]   across the first half hour of the day or so.
[00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.700]   And then I also make it a point
[00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.220]   to drink another packet of Element
[00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:01.840]   dissolved in an equal amount of water,
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.380]   so 16 to 32 ounces,
[00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:04.900]   at some other point during the day,
[00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.300]   and maybe even a third if I'm exercising
[00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:08.700]   and/or sweating a lot.
[00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.180]   I should mention that Element tastes absolutely delicious.
[00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:12.900]   My favorite flavor is watermelon,
[00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.540]   although I also confess I like the raspberry flavor,
[00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:16.380]   the citrus flavor.
[00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.060]   Basically, I like all the flavors.
[00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.200]   If you'd like to try Element,
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.220]   you can go to drinkelement.com/huberman

[00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.020]   to claim a free sample pack.
[00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.340]   And now for my discussion with Dr. Martha Beck.
[00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:36.780]   Dr. Martha Beck, welcome.
[00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:39.980]   - Oh, it's so good to be here, Andrew, thank you.
[00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:41.900]   - I'm so excited.
[00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:43.660]   I mean, I don't know how to convey
[00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:44.900]   to the people listening and watching
[00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:46.360]   just how excited I am.
[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.320]   I have very few heroes in life,
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.460]   but you are one of them.
[00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:54.260]   - I don't.
[00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:55.080]   - It's true.
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:55.980]   - That does not compute.
[00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:56.820]   - It's true.
[00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:58.420]   I won't name all of them,
[00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:01.780]   but you, the great Oliver Sacks,
[00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:06.500]   are among the people that have really influenced me so much
[00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.740]   in terms of the things I do,
[00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:11.140]   the ways I try and think,
[00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:14.180]   the ways I try to not think at times,
[00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:16.020]   and your life story is an amazing one.
[00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:18.140]   So we have a lot to cover today.
[00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:20.660]   So I'm not going to spend any more time
[00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:23.340]   talking about why I feel that way,
[00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:27.460]   because it's going to just become apparent in our discussion.
[00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:30.540]   But I do want to say that
[00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:33.180]   you have really been ahead of your time.
[00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:34.920]   I mean, you're triple degreed from Harvard,
[00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:37.340]   you have these academic credentials,
[00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:38.740]   and yet you were one of the first people
[00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:42.780]   to be public facing about the mind-body connection
[00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:45.180]   in a way that is operationalized,
[00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:47.940]   what we sometimes call in and around this podcast,
[00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:49.100]   protocols.
[00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:51.340]   And you've offered some practices
[00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:54.580]   that have absolutely transformed my life
[00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:55.620]   and other people's lives.
[00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:57.580]   And I gained them through reading your books,
[00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:00.860]   and that's not a standard book advertisement,
[00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:03.860]   but all of your books have been transformative for me.
[00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:08.820]   One of the exercises that has had a profound effect
[00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:13.140]   on my life is the perfect day exercise.
[00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:14.260]   Oh, yeah.
[00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:15.660]   And when I first read about it,
[00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:18.580]   I thought, what could this possibly be?
[00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:24.860]   And as I recall, it involved taking a little bit of time,
[00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:27.300]   maybe 10 minutes, maybe 30 minutes,
[00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:30.580]   and just sitting or lying down, closing one's eyes,
[00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:35.580]   and just imagining with no limitations one's perfect day.
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:41.600]   And what's so wild about this exercise
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.480]   is that several, not all,
[00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:47.140]   but several of the things that I imagined in that exercise
[00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:51.740]   have amazingly come to be reality.
[00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:52.580]   It works.
[00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:54.140]   I don't know how or why it works,
[00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:57.400]   but I used to have people send me a postcard.
[00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:59.240]   This is how long I've been doing this stuff.
[00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:02.000]   Now it's emails and texts that I say,
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.760]   okay, we just did your ideal day.
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:05.400]   You've got it all written down.
[00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:08.800]   Now send me a notification when that day happens,
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.560]   and I get a lot of notifications.
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.860]   Okay, well, I'm giving you a notification right now,
[00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:15.340]   because at the end of that exercise,
[00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:17.480]   and I ended up doing it several times.
[00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:19.300]   I do it all the time.
[00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:20.680]   Okay, that's good to know.
[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:22.940]   I want to know about the frequency there,
[00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:26.600]   was I'd love to sit down and talk to Martha Beck,
[00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:27.800]   what I wouldn't do.
[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:30.320]   So I'm in a pinch me moment right now.
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:31.160]   This is so great.
[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:32.000]   It's wild.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.240]   It's like reality weaving back on itself.
[00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:35.680]   - I've listened to your podcast,
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:37.220]   and I thought that guy's really cool.
[00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:38.060]   And here I am.
[00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:38.900]   - Oh, thank you.
[00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:41.640]   I'm moved by that.
[00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:44.920]   So let's just talk about this exercise for a second.
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:46.440]   - Cool, yeah.
[00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:49.520]   - Clearly we could come up with scientific explanations
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:51.080]   for why it would work.
[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:53.680]   You know, the brain is a predictive machine.
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:55.160]   You know, once it understands
[00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:56.680]   that something might be possible,
[00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:59.140]   maybe it looks for avenues for that unconsciously.
[00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:00.880]   We could come up with a whole narrative around that.
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:03.560]   But just for sake of those listening,
[00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:06.560]   what is this exercise?
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:08.560]   How would you suggest somebody try it?
[00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:12.240]   - So the first thing is that you don't make up something.
[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:14.240]   People would always tell me they'd make up a day
[00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:18.120]   where they woke up in a white room with white sheets
[00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:21.000]   and windows with white curtains.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.120]   And then they would put on white clothes and drift around.
[00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:27.360]   And I realized finally that these people were just tired.
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:31.600]   And they could not project anything
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:34.560]   but a sort of blankness that I finally realized
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:36.740]   meant that they just pushed themselves too hard.
[00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:38.600]   So I stopped doing this with people
[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:41.240]   until they were well-rested.
[00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:44.840]   Then you don't make it up, you see it happen.
[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:45.680]   That's the key thing.
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:47.760]   You allow it into your mind,
[00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:50.880]   not as though you're reaching with your imagination,
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:52.840]   just as though it emerges.
[00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:54.320]   So I talk people through it.
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:57.840]   First thing is you wake up in the morning,
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:01.780]   you're perfectly refreshed by a beautiful sleep.
[00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:05.920]   In your imagination, don't open your eyes, but listen.
[00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:06.920]   What do you hear?
[00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:10.840]   So you don't make it up, you listen for it.
[00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:12.840]   What do you hear?
[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:19.400]   - For me, the first thing I hear is like
[00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:22.080]   just feeling how comfortable my body is on the bed.
[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:26.160]   Something that I don't do enough.
[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:30.920]   - What about the sound of someone or someone's breathing?
[00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:33.760]   - Yeah, someone next to me breathing
[00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:35.160]   and they're still asleep.
[00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:36.640]   - Ah, lovely.
[00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:38.880]   Is there a dog breathing on the foot of the bed?
[00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:42.440]   - Well, if it was like my bulldog Costello that's snoring.
[00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:43.720]   I'm gonna get another dog soon.
[00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:46.920]   So I would like a dog that breathes
[00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:49.680]   with less snoring than Costello.
[00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:53.040]   Although I must say I miss his-
[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:53.880]   - Bulldogs.
[00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:55.640]   - His like incredibly deep snores.
[00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:58.360]   The early versions of this podcast, the early episodes,
[00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:00.520]   we kept him in the room snoring.
[00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:03.600]   And by the way, the watering up of my eyes,
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.140]   these are truly tears of joy.
[00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:10.600]   And I said at the beginning of the podcast,
[00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:12.080]   I said, "Listen, I have a bulldog.
[00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:13.640]   He's getting toward the end of his life.
[00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:14.820]   So we're gonna keep him in the room.
[00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:16.880]   And so when you hear that breathing in the background,
[00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:19.200]   that snoring, let's call it what it is,
[00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:23.320]   he's in here like, so sorry, not sorry."
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:26.840]   So anyway, so yeah, so there's some bulldog breathing.
[00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:28.600]   - And you can have as many dogs in the room as you want.
[00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:29.560]   Just listen.
[00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:31.360]   And maybe you hear birds outside.
[00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:32.280]   Maybe you hear the ocean.
[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:34.200]   Maybe you hear wind.
[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:37.400]   Maybe you hear people talking or the noise of traffic.
[00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:39.640]   Just listen for a minute
[00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:42.360]   until you're pretty sure you've heard
[00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:43.840]   everything there is to hear.
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:45.920]   - Yeah, I like the sound of kids playing.
[00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:47.440]   - Ah, sweet.
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.900]   Okay, so smell the air.
[00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:52.180]   What's it like?
[00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:53.160]   How humid is it?
[00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:54.320]   What's the temperature?
[00:11:54.320 --> 00:12:00.280]   - You know, I'm a Californian at heart.
[00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:04.160]   I like it in the 70s and 80s.
[00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:05.000]   - Perfect.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.760]   - Not too humid.
[00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:11.560]   And I don't, it's weird that I don't jumps in,
[00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:13.760]   but there's something about the sound
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:15.320]   of airplanes flying over.
[00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:16.160]   - Interesting.
[00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:16.980]   - That always depresses me.
[00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:18.640]   It must be some parrot association
[00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:21.280]   from some time like, I don't like that.
[00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:22.280]   - Okay, no planes.
[00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:24.960]   - So birds, bird chirping.
[00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:26.560]   Who doesn't like birds chirping?
[00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:30.400]   - And by the way, for our listeners,
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:33.800]   this is not one magical day that you'll never live again.
[00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:37.640]   This is a typical day, but your life is now perfect.
[00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:40.520]   So it's an ordinary day, but in your perfect life.
[00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:42.680]   So we'll put it out three years, five years,
[00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:45.840]   whatever makes it possible for you to allow
[00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:49.440]   that your ideal life could form in that time.
[00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:51.840]   You'll find as you do it many times,
[00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:56.000]   the time necessary for it to happen becomes much shorter.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.840]   Anyway, so you get up, look around,
[00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:01.520]   you sit up in the bed, look around, who's next to you?
[00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:03.000]   What does the dog look like?
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.160]   What does the room look like?
[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.240]   - Yeah, it's my partner next to me.
[00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:12.240]   My dog is, you know, I told myself
[00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:14.320]   I wasn't gonna get another bulldog.
[00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:15.160]   - Oh, you are.
[00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:16.000]   - But I think I'm gonna get another bulldog.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:16.840]   - You are.
[00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:17.660]   - They're the best.
[00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:18.500]   - Yeah.
[00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:20.760]   - They're like the essence of efficiency
[00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:25.240]   of metabolism, meaning they do as little as possible
[00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:27.600]   and they experience as much joy as possible.
[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:28.440]   - Oh, that's perfect.
[00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:29.920]   - They're hedonists when it really comes down to it.
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:32.800]   - You need a wise hedonist in your life.
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:34.680]   - Right, and they are capable
[00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:35.800]   of protecting if they need to,
[00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:37.800]   but I honestly don't care about that.
[00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:39.720]   You know, all that stuff, like all that,
[00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:41.600]   like my bulldogs, I don't care about any of that.
[00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:43.680]   - Something tells me you could protect yourself pretty well.
[00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:45.960]   - Yeah, I'm good there.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:47.840]   So.
[00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:51.040]   - Look around the room, what color are the walls?
[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:54.020]   What pictures are hanging there, if any?
[00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:59.020]   - Yeah, I'm a Wyeth fan, Andrew Wyeth fan.
[00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:00.760]   - Which one, Andrew or N.C.?
[00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:04.640]   - Well, recently I saw a caption,
[00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:05.920]   I don't know if this is true,
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:07.920]   because it was an Instagram post,
[00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:11.560]   that the woman in the field image.
[00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:12.520]   - Christina's world.
[00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:16.200]   - That, yeah, I didn't know the name of it.
[00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:19.320]   Thank you, that this was a neighbor of theirs
[00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:23.080]   that had a degenerative neural condition.
[00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:26.680]   And rather than use a wheelchair of sorts,
[00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:28.880]   she insisted on crawling everywhere.
[00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:31.880]   And so that image is actually of her
[00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:35.200]   crawling out into the field, happily to enjoy the field.
[00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:38.000]   Because my impression of the painting before
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.960]   was that somehow, because she's seated up there,
[00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:44.440]   it looks like, in my mind, I projected onto it
[00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:45.920]   that there's some like desperation there
[00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:47.200]   or something to get back to the house.
[00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:48.520]   But that's not it at all.
[00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:52.040]   Turns out, this is a woman who preferred to move
[00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:54.860]   with her own agency, even if it meant crawling
[00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:56.360]   to enjoy nature.
[00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:57.800]   - It's a magnificent painting.
[00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:59.400]   - It's a magnificent painting.
[00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:00.920]   - So it's on the wall there?
[00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:03.040]   - Yes, maybe not the original,
[00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:03.880]   although that would be awesome.
[00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:04.700]   - Why not?
[00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:05.540]   It's your perfect life.
[00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:07.920]   - Then I'm waking up in the Met.
[00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:10.600]   - And also just notice that you're creating a theme,
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:15.000]   which is, the theme is, I will go out as myself.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.920]   And I will reach and strive for things.
[00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:20.180]   And I'm not here to be helped.
[00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:24.120]   I'm here to do hard things and to do them for the joy of it.
[00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:29.120]   So that painting is a strong symbol of who you are.
[00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:33.320]   So get out of the bed and your partner's still sleeping,
[00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:34.840]   the dog's still sleeping.
[00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:36.880]   Go look out the window, where are you?
[00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:40.960]   And you can be anywhere.
[00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:43.040]   - I'm a mountains guy.
[00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:44.820]   As much as I love California,
[00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:49.640]   I've realized that I just went out to Boulder, Colorado
[00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:52.180]   for the first time for a week, just by myself.
[00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:53.480]   And I fell in love with it.
[00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:54.480]   - Yeah.
[00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:58.980]   - So I'm in the mountains, Colorado, feels right to me.
[00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:03.540]   And there's water.
[00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:05.800]   - Like a river.
[00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:08.360]   - The river, they've got great rivers there.
[00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:10.080]   - Yeah, they do.
[00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:11.680]   - Or the little streams.
[00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:14.720]   I like the little streams that they have there
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:16.880]   because the rivers are so loud.
[00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:18.640]   - That's true.
[00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:21.040]   - The rivers are really loud when they get going.
[00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:24.560]   Yeah, and...
[00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:29.000]   Yeah.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.120]   - So are you looking at a small town, a city,
[00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:33.240]   or do you just live out in the mountains by yourself?
[00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:34.560]   - Definitely small town.
[00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:36.260]   I can't be too isolated.
[00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:39.360]   If I'm going to be in a city, I'm going to be in Manhattan.
[00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:40.800]   It's like, it's all or none.
[00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:43.560]   So if I'm going to be in nature, I want to be in nature.
[00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:45.720]   So a small town.
[00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:46.560]   - Beautiful.
[00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:51.560]   So just look around, smell the pine, aspen air,
[00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:55.760]   and then you go into your perfect bathroom.
[00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:57.080]   And it's all, it's beautiful.
[00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:00.240]   You can go through a lot of description if you wanted to,
[00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:01.960]   but I'm going to rush through that
[00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:04.120]   to get to the interesting parts.
[00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:06.920]   So you take a look at yourself in the mirror.
[00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:09.800]   Your body is absolutely perfect.
[00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:12.080]   Of course, in your case, that's not an aspirational thing.
[00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:15.520]   You're already there, but make it even better.
[00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:20.700]   - Yeah, for me, that means being clear-eyed.
[00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:24.720]   People who listen to this podcast know that,
[00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:27.520]   I came up through neuroscience studying a number of things,
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:29.740]   but the visual system, and these two little bits
[00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:32.640]   in the front of our skull are pieces of our brain.
[00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:34.980]   They're the only pieces of our brain outside of our skull,
[00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:38.300]   and they, yes, they may be the windows to the soul
[00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:39.680]   if people want to refer to them that way,
[00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:43.280]   but to me, like just feeling like my eyes are clear,
[00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:49.480]   and there's a certain tone or something that I'm like,
[00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:54.120]   okay, like I'm all there. - Well, there's real clarity.
[00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:54.960]   I've seen it.
[00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:57.320]   I don't know if you've worked with people who are dying
[00:17:57.320 --> 00:17:59.320]   or who are really ill.
[00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:01.560]   Sometimes you'll see a shift in their,
[00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:03.760]   the transparency of their eyes.
[00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:07.920]   There actually seems to be a radiance coming from the eyes
[00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.240]   or gathered around the eyes.
[00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:11.560]   That's what I'm sort of thinking as you talk.
[00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:14.400]   - Yeah, and I think it's the Buddhists that talked about,
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:16.520]   it's someone who's at the level of their,
[00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:18.880]   their eyes are at the level of their skin,
[00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:19.740]   so like right there,
[00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:21.800]   as opposed to sunken back into their eyes.
[00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:22.640]   - Yes.
[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:24.960]   - And then, of course,
[00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:27.440]   some people are like really forward-leaning,
[00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:31.480]   but this, and I also happen to work on the intersection
[00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:35.080]   between the visual system and the autonomic system,
[00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:37.720]   so stress or calm,
[00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:39.940]   and I think what that's referring to,
[00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:41.040]   and I'm speculating here,
[00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:43.760]   is where we are alert but calm.
[00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:44.600]   - Yes.
[00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:46.640]   - So we're present, alert, but calm,
[00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:48.040]   and of course that controls pupil size,
[00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:51.800]   and all of this stuff I do believe has been understood
[00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:54.920]   in other traditions and ancient traditions
[00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:57.000]   through a kind of unconscious genius
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.360]   where they're recognizing all the symbols integrated
[00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:04.460]   of clarity of the eyes and level of the skin,
[00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:06.520]   and of course we can measure the stuff in the lab,
[00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:08.040]   but that's just isolating variables.
[00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:10.000]   So for me, it's looking in the mirror and being like,
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.240]   okay, my eyes are clear.
[00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:14.000]   - This is so interesting 'cause my friend Liz Gilbert
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.080]   of Eat, Pray, Love fame,
[00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:17.920]   she wrote something before she was famous
[00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:20.960]   where she dressed as a man for a week and walked around,
[00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:25.000]   and she's tall and broad-shouldered and has, you know,
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.720]   great chin, so she could get, she could look male,
[00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:30.240]   and she got herself all dressed up male,
[00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:32.360]   and they faked a beard and everything,
[00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:33.960]   and then she had her friends come,
[00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:37.620]   and a male friend said to her, "No, Liz,
[00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:42.560]   "pull yourself back six inches away from your own eyes,"
[00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:44.800]   and she did it, and he said,
[00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:46.600]   "Now you're looking like a man."
[00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:47.440]   - Interesting.
[00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:48.260]   - And she walked around that way,
[00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:52.440]   and she said it was the loneliest, saddest week
[00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:54.520]   she's ever experienced.
[00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:57.280]   Like, yeah, people gave her more respect in certain ways,
[00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:59.780]   but she said, "When they told me to back away
[00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:02.960]   "from my own eyes, it was like my soul went dim."
[00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:03.800]   - Wow.
[00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:05.680]   - And that's really, really interesting
[00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:08.440]   that you would say that exact distance.
[00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:12.180]   - Yeah, it's like a retraction of our humanness.
[00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:13.020]   - That's fascinating.
[00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:15.320]   - I mean, I don't ever recall as a kid, you know,
[00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:19.480]   my dad or my mom or anyone telling me, like,
[00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:21.120]   where to place my vision.
[00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:21.960]   - No, no, no, it's very articulating.
[00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:23.240]   - You know, and I'm probably guilty
[00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:28.240]   of being more expressive, emotional, effusive
[00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:35.280]   than certainly the traditional male stereotype, right?
[00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:37.600]   Like, if I love something,
[00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:38.840]   people are gonna hear about it.
[00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:42.400]   And I'm not shy about the fact that thinking
[00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:44.960]   about Costello or my graduate advisor
[00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:46.960]   or people I love, like, all well up,
[00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:49.440]   and I'm okay with that.
[00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:53.840]   But I think, well, to flip that one around,
[00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:57.720]   do you think that that's a real thing that-
[00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:58.560]   - I have no idea.
[00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:01.640]   - Cultural conditioning that men and women tend
[00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:05.640]   to kind of be either more, I don't know,
[00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:07.040]   there's no language for this.
[00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:09.480]   - I have an N of two, you and Liz Gilbert.
[00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:11.280]   - Okay, all right.
[00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:13.500]   - But I think it's very interesting that you said that,
[00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:15.760]   that you're forward and your eyes,
[00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:18.540]   and the idea that the eyes are the parts
[00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:20.240]   of our brains that are showing.
[00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:22.360]   It's fascinating that she had that experience too.
[00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:27.200]   So I would love to, I'll be asking people from now on,
[00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:30.320]   if you're designated male, identified male,
[00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:34.400]   do you feel you have to pull your sort of vitality
[00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:35.880]   back from the world?
[00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:38.040]   And I suspect it's true.
[00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:41.120]   I suspect it's true just from interacting with people.
[00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:46.840]   And ask women if they, I think it's more vulnerable
[00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:49.760]   to be right on the surface of your life
[00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:51.440]   and in the surface of your eyes,
[00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:53.360]   but it's also much more,
[00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:58.120]   there's a sensuousness to the world
[00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:02.640]   when you're fully present that I know I had to shut down.
[00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:04.600]   Like when I was in the Ivy League,
[00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:07.040]   I had to pull myself back and sink down.
[00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:09.440]   And that's a typically male environment.
[00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:12.600]   I think it's about materialism and conquest
[00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:15.120]   and oppositional thinking as much as gender.
[00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:16.200]   - Very tactical.
[00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:17.040]   - Yes, yeah.
[00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:19.120]   - It's like taking what's out there and holding it in.
[00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:19.960]   I actually can do it.
[00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:20.800]   I know how to do this.
[00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:21.620]   - You just did it.
[00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:22.460]   - Yeah, I know how to do this.
[00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:23.480]   - It's like visible.
[00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:26.040]   - Yeah, I probably just learned how to do it.
[00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:27.460]   - Wow.
[00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:28.300]   - 'Cause I'm comfortable
[00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:29.680]   in a lot of different environments.
[00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:30.640]   There are certainly environments
[00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:32.200]   I don't want to find myself in again
[00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:34.320]   or in the future for the first time.
[00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:37.880]   But yeah, I'm very, very aware
[00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:41.820]   what that distinct change in internal state
[00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:42.660]   that accompanies that.
[00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:44.640]   - That's so, that was so interesting
[00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:46.700]   that you just did that, wow.
[00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:50.580]   Okay, the problem I'm having now is that I have,
[00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:53.420]   and I quote, "An interest-based attention system."
[00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:54.260]   - I love that.
[00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:56.020]   - ADHD, which means I pay attention
[00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:57.500]   to things that interest me,
[00:22:57.500 --> 00:23:00.640]   which means that I literally follow squirrels
[00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:01.900]   away from business meetings.
[00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:04.820]   - But I have paper and pen here and it's okay
[00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:08.700]   because the art of podcasting, in my opinion,
[00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:10.980]   is that we can spin a couple of different plates
[00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:13.540]   and return to them because it's like conversation.
[00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:14.660]   Otherwise, we might as well be
[00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:17.220]   on a highly produced traditional media show
[00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:18.540]   and that's not what this is.
[00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:19.660]   - Sure, I say.
[00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:20.500]   So we're back.
[00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:21.980]   So I look in the mirror and I see.
[00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:23.380]   - Yeah, you are present, man.
[00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:24.740]   - I'm clear and present, okay.
[00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:26.220]   And of course, for those listening,
[00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:28.500]   you should all be doing this exercise for you, right?
[00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:29.420]   Yes, okay.
[00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:31.780]   Okay.
[00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:32.900]   - And now you go to your closet
[00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:34.020]   and you're going to get dressed.
[00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:36.140]   Open your closet, which is the closet
[00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:38.060]   of clothing you have in your ideal life,
[00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:42.340]   and just look at the different outfits you have,
[00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:45.180]   the different, like how many kinds of shoes are there?
[00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:46.080]   - It's just pretty funny
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:48.820]   because I definitely have my ideal wardrobe,
[00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:49.940]   which is very sparse.
[00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:52.380]   I've always owned 20 or so
[00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:56.380]   of these buttoned down black shirts for work purposes.
[00:23:56.380 --> 00:23:59.180]   I like t-shirts that are super soft.
[00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:01.380]   And because I have a short torso and long arms,
[00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:03.140]   like they have to like fit right.
[00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:04.660]   And so I find the ones that fit right,
[00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:06.220]   it's a nightmare trying to get them.
[00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:09.220]   But once I get them, I adore them
[00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:14.220]   because I always own two belts or so,
[00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:18.300]   one watch, black jeans, the shorts I like,
[00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:20.100]   I get teased for wearing mailman shorts,
[00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:22.820]   but they're actually the Costco purchased mail
[00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:26.300]   or like Kmart purchased like mail person shorts.
[00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:28.980]   They fit best for me.
[00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:31.740]   And I've always worn Adidas.
[00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:33.900]   So I'm happy there.
[00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:36.060]   Oh yeah, I own a pair of proper leather shoes.
[00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:36.900]   I have a suit.
[00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:37.900]   I actually own a tuxedo.
[00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:39.240]   - Oh my.
[00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:40.700]   - I own those things.
[00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:44.380]   And I like my closet.
[00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:45.220]   I've always liked it.
[00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:47.100]   It feels very safe in there.
[00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:48.180]   I like it.
[00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:51.900]   And then I've always kept a couple of photographs
[00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:53.780]   of people that I love in my closet.
[00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:55.180]   - Oh, sweet.
[00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:56.700]   So whose photographs are there?
[00:24:56.700 --> 00:24:58.900]   Do you see any photographs you don't recognize
[00:24:58.900 --> 00:24:59.860]   at this moment?
[00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:01.060]   - It's my sister.
[00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:04.140]   It's my grandfather.
[00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:07.100]   And then I think that's it.
[00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:08.140]   - Yeah, don't think it up.
[00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:09.800]   - Apologies to my parents.
[00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:12.100]   - Yeah, everybody else, losers.
[00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:14.100]   - Apologies to my parents and anyone else.
[00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:15.060]   Please forgive me.
[00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:16.660]   Okay, yeah.
[00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:18.940]   Okay, so then you go through the whole day,
[00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:21.140]   and I can spend at least an hour
[00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:22.540]   going through this with someone.
[00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:26.100]   And the important thing is that you do something
[00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:27.060]   I call the three Ns.
[00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:29.920]   You notice what comes into the field of your imagination,
[00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:32.900]   but you don't try too hard to see it specifically.
[00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:34.500]   And then as you go through,
[00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:37.700]   you sort of narrow down what it might be.
[00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:40.700]   And if the name of that thing comes up,
[00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:42.240]   you can then name it.
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:44.680]   But for example, in one of my ideal days,
[00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:47.540]   I was writing short pieces of writing,
[00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:50.620]   and I was interacting with people very regularly about it.
[00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:55.620]   And I couldn't even imagine what kind of job that was.
[00:25:55.620 --> 00:26:00.100]   And then an editor in Manhattan
[00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:01.940]   knocked over a manuscript I'd written,
[00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:05.260]   and she was the editor of a women's magazine.
[00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:08.140]   And she called me and asked me to be a columnist.
[00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:08.980]   And I was like, all right.
[00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:11.580]   And so I was a magazine columnist for like 20 years.
[00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:14.360]   And it was exactly what was in the ideal day,
[00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:15.980]   but I had not named it.
[00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:18.960]   I didn't know that you could live in Phoenix
[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:21.940]   and be a columnist for New York magazines.
[00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:24.580]   So notice what you're doing.
[00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:29.580]   You put on your very comfy T-shirt, very cool black jeans,
[00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:33.540]   your one watch, your belt, your Adidas,
[00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:36.060]   and you go do something really fun
[00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:40.380]   with people you really love in a place you really enjoy.
[00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:45.700]   Well, the work part of my life, quote unquote work,
[00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:49.460]   is like reading and teaching
[00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:52.100]   and talking about stuff on the internet,
[00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:53.940]   which is podcasting.
[00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:59.580]   But what I got a flash of is I'd wanna work
[00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:01.620]   on my fish tanks with my kids.
[00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:04.620]   Oh yeah, see now I skipped a thing.
[00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:05.900]   You're supposed to go down to breakfast
[00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:08.140]   and see if you've got a family.
[00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:13.140]   I do, yeah, I've always wanted kids.
[00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:17.420]   Been trying to time that correctly and with the right person.
[00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:23.280]   So yeah, I like tending to my fish tanks.
[00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:26.120]   I have kept fish tanks since I was a kid.
[00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:27.700]   I haven't had one for a few years now,
[00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:31.380]   but I'm always setting them up for other people.
[00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:32.540]   It's kind of interesting.
[00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:33.880]   I always go play in real life.
[00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:36.760]   I go see people, I'm like, I'm gonna put a fish tank there.
[00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:39.100]   - My interest-based detention system just went,
[00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:40.380]   oh really, you do it for other people?
[00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:42.140]   - Oh yeah, I'll show up and I'll be like,
[00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:43.900]   will you let me, and then I'll set it up.
[00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:45.940]   And I love setting up fish tanks.
[00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:47.780]   It's like the, who knows.
[00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:49.180]   - So your kids are helping you.
[00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:50.380]   How many kids are there?
[00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:53.180]   - Realistically?
[00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:56.340]   - No, in your imagination, you can have 20 if you want.
[00:27:56.340 --> 00:27:58.060]   - Two, two.
[00:27:58.060 --> 00:28:00.740]   For some reason, I got obsessed with numbers for a while,
[00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:03.840]   but I was thinking like five or something, no, two.
[00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:05.940]   - You never know, it could happen.
[00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:07.800]   The important thing about this exercise
[00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:10.180]   is you don't get logical about it.
[00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:13.260]   You don't think what's manageable and what's probable
[00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:15.380]   and you just see who's there.
[00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:16.500]   - Yeah, two feels good.
[00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:17.340]   - All right, fair enough.
[00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:18.620]   - Two feels good.
[00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:22.420]   And yeah, there's so much life in a fish tank.
[00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:23.900]   There's the plants, there's the food,
[00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:26.700]   there's how the fish are interacting with one another,
[00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:29.320]   who's chasing who, who's nibbling, who's hiding,
[00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:32.320]   who's dominant, who's like being kind of unruly
[00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:36.840]   and like, I mean, I must've seen the "Finding Nemo" movie,
[00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:41.840]   especially the second one, like 12 times.
[00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:43.680]   - Fabulous.
[00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:46.520]   - Like 12 times, it's crazy, as an adult.
[00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:48.400]   - It's not crazy, this is wonderful.
[00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:50.600]   - So good, like I just loved the personalities.
[00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:54.840]   I mean, any movie where Willem Dafoe is the voice of a fish,
[00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:59.160]   you're like, okay, like, so, all right,
[00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:02.600]   so we tend to the fish tanks, which is great pleasure.
[00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:07.600]   And then for me, it's, we come here and sit down with you
[00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:14.040]   and hang out with these guys and my team
[00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:19.040]   and share what I like know to be really cool,
[00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:25.300]   useful, like truly useful practices.
[00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:28.240]   - Fabulous, so you're very, very close
[00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:30.400]   to your ideal day right now.
[00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:32.800]   But, and as you said, I don't know the mechanisms
[00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:36.640]   that get put in play, certainly directed attention,
[00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:38.340]   that you're now like a guided missile
[00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:40.200]   that knows where its target is,
[00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:41.840]   or at least what the target looks like.
[00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:44.600]   And we all make countless decisions every day
[00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:47.880]   and you can think of it as a lot of little whys
[00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:50.480]   branching out, and if you've got this in your mind
[00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:53.260]   really clearly, you're gonna take the option
[00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:55.320]   that leads to it.
[00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:57.320]   That's what I tell people, it's logical,
[00:29:57.320 --> 00:30:01.040]   directed attention, except that in many cases,
[00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:04.920]   I have to say, a miracle occurs, you know?
[00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:08.000]   My favorite cartoon is this physics equation
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.740]   with these two physicists, and there are all these symbols
[00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:12.920]   on both sides of the board, in the middle in brackets,
[00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:15.320]   it says, a miracle occurs.
[00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:16.200]   - I love it.
[00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:18.800]   My dad's a theoretical physicist, so he will,
[00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:20.380]   but he will delight in that.
[00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:23.840]   As many of you know, I've been taking AG1
[00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:26.120]   for more than 10 years now, so I'm delighted
[00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:27.880]   that they're sponsoring this podcast.
[00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:30.640]   To be clear, I don't take AG1 because they're a sponsor,
[00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:33.760]   rather, they are a sponsor because I take AG1.
[00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:37.160]   In fact, I take AG1 once and often twice every single day,
[00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:40.880]   and I've done that since starting way back in 2012.
[00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:43.480]   There is so much conflicting information out there nowadays
[00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:45.640]   about what proper nutrition is,
[00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:48.620]   but here's what there seems to be a general consensus on.
[00:30:48.620 --> 00:30:50.960]   Whether you're an omnivore, a carnivore,
[00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:53.820]   a vegetarian, or a vegan, I think it's generally agreed
[00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:56.480]   that you should get most of your food from unprocessed
[00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:58.400]   or minimally processed sources,
[00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:00.900]   which allows you to eat enough, but not overeat,
[00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:02.480]   get plenty of vitamins and minerals,
[00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:05.220]   probiotics, and micronutrients that we all need
[00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:06.920]   for physical and mental health.
[00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:08.720]   Now, I personally am an omnivore,
[00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:11.160]   and I strive to get most of my food from unprocessed
[00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:13.040]   or minimally processed sources,
[00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:15.040]   but the reason I still take AG1 once
[00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:17.640]   and often twice every day is that it ensures
[00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:21.380]   I get all of those vitamins, minerals, probiotics, et cetera,
[00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:24.200]   but it also has adaptogens to help me cope with stress.
[00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:26.480]   It's basically a nutritional insurance policy
[00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:29.200]   meant to augment, not replace quality food.
[00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:31.400]   So by drinking a serving of AG1 in the morning,
[00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:33.440]   and again in the afternoon or evening,
[00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:36.080]   I cover all of my foundational nutritional needs,
[00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:38.760]   and I, like so many other people that take AG1,
[00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:41.800]   report feeling much better in a number of important ways,
[00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:44.960]   such as energy levels, digestion, sleep, and more.
[00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:47.160]   So while many supplements out there are really directed
[00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:49.520]   towards obtaining one specific outcome,
[00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:52.140]   AG1 is foundational nutrition designed to support
[00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:54.580]   all aspects of wellbeing related to mental health
[00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:55.980]   and physical health.
[00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:57.380]   If you'd like to try AG1,
[00:31:57.380 --> 00:32:00.820]   you can go to drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:02.260]   to claim a special offer.
[00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:04.380]   They'll give you five free travel packs with your order,
[00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:06.980]   plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:10.700]   Again, that's drinkag1.com/huberman.
[00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:13.140]   There was something that popped to mind.
[00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:16.460]   I mean, there are all these little things
[00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:17.940]   that also go into my perfect day
[00:32:17.940 --> 00:32:19.560]   that we don't have to go into every detail
[00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:21.540]   about like working out and the whole thing.
[00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:24.900]   But I just want to maybe mention a point of contrast
[00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:27.540]   that served as one of the reasons
[00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:29.440]   why I did this practice in the first place
[00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:33.140]   was that in real life, I was waking up,
[00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:34.500]   and sometimes still do wake up
[00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:37.860]   with this like underlying like tension,
[00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:39.820]   like something's not right.
[00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:41.180]   I don't feel good.
[00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:42.300]   I wasn't anxious.
[00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:44.580]   I wasn't like, but like something's not right.
[00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:48.100]   And I went through years of kind of like gnawing
[00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:49.780]   and scratching at different things
[00:32:49.780 --> 00:32:52.540]   that I quickly discovered,
[00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:54.400]   like going out for a couple of drinks with people
[00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:55.540]   made me feel worse.
[00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:58.240]   I don't judge people who drink whatsoever.
[00:32:58.240 --> 00:32:59.500]   I'm like, I don't like this.
[00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:00.820]   Like it doesn't, like I was just,
[00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:05.820]   but this unease, it's like a restlessness
[00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:08.640]   that lived inside of me for so long
[00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:11.500]   and still can surface as a signal
[00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:13.740]   that like this is not the right life.
[00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:16.780]   And at that point I had a laboratory,
[00:33:16.780 --> 00:33:18.580]   I had grants, we're publishing papers,
[00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:21.240]   like all these things that I loved doing
[00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:24.780]   and that I loved the trajectory that I took to arrive there
[00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:25.860]   and the people that were in my life.
[00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:27.780]   But like, I just knew I could just say like,
[00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:28.620]   something's not right.
[00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:29.860]   And I felt terribly guilty.
[00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:31.700]   The reason I'm telling this is I felt terribly guilty.
[00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:33.920]   Like I owned a home, right?
[00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:36.740]   I was in my mid thirties and it wasn't an expensive home,
[00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:38.060]   certainly not by today's standards,
[00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:40.780]   but I was able to buy a home on my own.
[00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:45.780]   I was, I had my dog, I had, you know, people in my life,
[00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:47.320]   but it was like this,
[00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:49.780]   it was almost like a gear that was grinding.
[00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:53.960]   And that was the stimulus for exploring this perfect day.
[00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:56.540]   My life looks completely different now.
[00:33:56.540 --> 00:33:58.620]   And it's far from quote unquote perfect,
[00:33:58.620 --> 00:34:02.580]   meaning there's still work to do in a lot of domains,
[00:34:02.580 --> 00:34:07.580]   a lot, but I feel like the trajectory is right.
[00:34:07.580 --> 00:34:08.660]   Yeah.
[00:34:08.660 --> 00:34:11.420]   And I really believe the source of all my work, you know,
[00:34:11.420 --> 00:34:14.420]   I was at, I was getting my doctorate at Harvard.
[00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:15.700]   I'd gotten my bachelor's there.
[00:34:15.700 --> 00:34:17.580]   I'd been there since I was 17.
[00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:20.540]   And halfway through my doctorate,
[00:34:20.540 --> 00:34:24.060]   during that time I'd gotten married, had a child.
[00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:25.980]   My second child was prenatally diagnosed
[00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:27.340]   with Down syndrome.
[00:34:27.340 --> 00:34:30.420]   And I was six months into the pregnancy almost.
[00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:33.660]   And I had like two weeks to make a decision
[00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:36.340]   and I'm politically very pro-choice.
[00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:39.340]   And I wouldn't, I can't never judge anyone
[00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:42.540]   who made the other decision, but I couldn't do it.
[00:34:42.540 --> 00:34:44.540]   I was already sort of bonded to him.
[00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:47.220]   And I kept asking the question of myself,
[00:34:47.220 --> 00:34:50.180]   what makes a human life worth living?
[00:34:50.180 --> 00:34:53.260]   Because the doctors at the Harvard Medical Clinic
[00:34:53.260 --> 00:34:55.460]   and all my advisors told me,
[00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:59.100]   you have got to at the very least institutionalize
[00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:01.420]   this child the second he's born.
[00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:02.500]   Institutionalize.
[00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:03.660]   Oh yeah, for sure.
[00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:06.220]   They said, you're throwing your career away.
[00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:09.660]   The head of the obstetrics committee,
[00:35:09.660 --> 00:35:11.980]   there were five obstetricians.
[00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:16.980]   And the chief dude came in and there I was sitting on a bed
[00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:19.140]   in my little hospital napkin.
[00:35:19.140 --> 00:35:23.300]   And he said, this is like a cancerous tumor.
[00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:25.300]   You've got to let us take it out.
[00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:27.020]   It will ruin your life.
[00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:28.180]   And I just looked at him
[00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:30.540]   and I had the weirdest experience ever.
[00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:32.380]   I looked at this very intimidating guy
[00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:35.820]   and I'm there sort of young and naked and pregnant.
[00:35:35.820 --> 00:35:40.820]   And suddenly it was like I could see two faces on him.
[00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:44.780]   And one was this very stern, knowledgeable doctor.
[00:35:44.780 --> 00:35:49.780]   And the other one was a terrified child, terrified.
[00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:53.180]   And it was so striking that I like started looking
[00:35:53.180 --> 00:35:54.020]   at him strangely.
[00:35:54.020 --> 00:35:56.420]   I'm sure he thought I was completely nuts.
[00:35:56.420 --> 00:36:00.420]   But I looked at him and I thought, you're afraid.
[00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:02.580]   You're afraid of this baby.
[00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:04.260]   And I realized, that's when I realized
[00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:06.180]   that a lot of people don't go to Harvard
[00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:07.340]   because they know they're smart.
[00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:09.980]   They go there because they're afraid they're stupid.
[00:36:09.980 --> 00:36:11.820]   And he was-
[00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:15.140]   - Probably true for a lot of higher education institutions.
[00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:18.380]   - And I thought he's afraid of the, in quotes,
[00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:20.860]   stupid little boy inside me,
[00:36:20.860 --> 00:36:23.780]   because he's afraid of the stupid little boy inside him.
[00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:27.780]   He's terrified of being the person
[00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:30.780]   he's worked so hard not to be.
[00:36:30.780 --> 00:36:34.620]   He's afraid of being like my son.
[00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:37.060]   And he thinks that should be thrown away.
[00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:39.700]   And that was the point at which I said,
[00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:43.940]   I will not make my decisions based on social pressure.
[00:36:43.940 --> 00:36:48.740]   I have to do something from a very, very deep place within.
[00:36:48.740 --> 00:36:52.420]   And so I kept that, I mean, he's home right now.
[00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:53.740]   You know, we're having a great time.
[00:36:53.740 --> 00:36:55.820]   - Adam, right? - Adam, my son, Adam.
[00:36:55.820 --> 00:36:57.820]   - I only know his name through your books, of course,
[00:36:57.820 --> 00:37:00.100]   but I feel like I know him a little bit.
[00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:02.340]   'Cause I love the story about him peeing on the doctor.
[00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:05.460]   - Yes, the very first thing I ever did in this life
[00:37:05.460 --> 00:37:09.220]   was the doctor pulled him out of my body
[00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:11.940]   and I saw this arc of urine go straight
[00:37:11.940 --> 00:37:13.780]   into the doctor's face.
[00:37:13.780 --> 00:37:15.100]   And I was like- - Beautiful.
[00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:18.260]   - So proud of my child at that moment.
[00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:20.300]   I thought if only I'd thought to do that.
[00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:26.140]   - I wanna just, for lack of a better way to put it,
[00:37:26.140 --> 00:37:27.220]   double click on two things.
[00:37:27.220 --> 00:37:30.080]   First of all, I wonder if we're going to speculate,
[00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:33.380]   no need to, but if the perfect day exercise
[00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:36.420]   is really about accessing the subconscious.
[00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:38.820]   - That's why I told that long story,
[00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:41.940]   that when I had to make that decision,
[00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:45.040]   it was the first time I had dropped everything conscious
[00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:50.040]   and logical from my mind and come from a place that was,
[00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:53.060]   I believe it's part of our neurological apparatus,
[00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:56.380]   but the cognitive structures are so,
[00:37:56.380 --> 00:37:59.460]   you know, cognitive function is just a tiny fraction
[00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:01.200]   of what our whole nervous systems
[00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:03.120]   are able to detect and tell us.
[00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:06.160]   And for the first time I was making a decision
[00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:08.620]   from every cell in my body,
[00:38:08.620 --> 00:38:12.840]   instead of just my, you know, neocortex.
[00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:17.040]   And I realized my life is not meant to go like his life.
[00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:19.240]   And the person in the next bed,
[00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:21.320]   their life isn't meant to be like mine,
[00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:26.120]   but we all have this programmed into us somehow.
[00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:28.200]   And when we start to leave it,
[00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:31.120]   in my last book I called it, leaving our integrity,
[00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:34.640]   because to be an integrity just means to be one thing.
[00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:37.360]   It doesn't have any moral implications in the original,
[00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:40.500]   like Latin, it just means integer, one thing.
[00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:44.060]   So if we were born knowing who we are,
[00:38:44.060 --> 00:38:48.440]   but at some point, usually not long after birth,
[00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:51.580]   we get socialized away from what,
[00:38:51.580 --> 00:38:55.100]   from expressing exactly what our own truth is telling us.
[00:38:55.100 --> 00:38:57.940]   We get socialized to behave in ways
[00:38:57.940 --> 00:39:00.720]   that please other people, very simple.
[00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:03.280]   And as you're describing it, I had a great life.
[00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:06.220]   I had a lab, I had a dog, I had a house.
[00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:10.000]   Those are all socially recognized items
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:11.980]   that say your life is working,
[00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:16.360]   but they have nothing to do with your personal destiny.
[00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:20.240]   - Right, in my case, again, I loved,
[00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:21.560]   and I still love doing science.
[00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:24.680]   I mean, my lab is certainly shrunk.
[00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:27.860]   I got it made sure people got placed in jobs
[00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:30.320]   and faculty positions, et cetera.
[00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:32.000]   I'm still involved in some clinical trials,
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:35.340]   but one thing that pained me about the work,
[00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:37.080]   I'll just come clean about this.
[00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:40.880]   This makes my throat lock up a bit,
[00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:43.920]   is I've been an animal lover since I was a kid.
[00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:46.480]   I do eat meat, I eat it from sustainable sources,
[00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:50.760]   but not all, but a lot of the work that I did
[00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:53.040]   in my laboratory was on animals.
[00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:56.520]   And at some point, it was approximately halfway
[00:39:56.520 --> 00:39:59.580]   through my first position.
[00:39:59.580 --> 00:40:04.580]   I realized, I was like, "I don't like this."
[00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:07.800]   And we could talk all day about animal research,
[00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:08.940]   non-animal research.
[00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:11.260]   I decided to work on humans instead
[00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:14.580]   because they can consent and they house themselves.
[00:40:14.580 --> 00:40:17.740]   But, you know, so there were some pain points,
[00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:20.720]   but I think my unconscious was pulling at me.
[00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:23.700]   Like, "This isn't good, this isn't good."
[00:40:23.700 --> 00:40:28.700]   And for me, and I do think that the conscious mind
[00:40:28.700 --> 00:40:34.260]   and the logical mind, as you're referring to it,
[00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:36.160]   it's very tactical.
[00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:39.180]   And part of the problem is it works so well,
[00:40:39.180 --> 00:40:41.480]   works in quotes, to move us forward
[00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:43.340]   on metrics related to that.
[00:40:43.340 --> 00:40:48.180]   But I mean, there are very few people that I know
[00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:50.020]   who are truly aligned with their,
[00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:52.260]   I guess what you've called essential self.
[00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:56.580]   One who I'm fortunate to be good friends with,
[00:40:56.580 --> 00:41:00.060]   he just so happens to be famous for lack of a better word,
[00:41:00.060 --> 00:41:02.540]   who resonates with a lot of what we're discussing
[00:41:02.540 --> 00:41:05.420]   is the great Rick Rubin, the music producer
[00:41:05.420 --> 00:41:07.820]   who's produced all these different types of music.
[00:41:07.820 --> 00:41:10.260]   And one thing that's really interesting about Rick,
[00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:11.780]   I've spent a lot of time with Rick
[00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:13.380]   and we communicate all the time.
[00:41:13.380 --> 00:41:15.940]   And one thing that is very interesting about him
[00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:18.900]   is he has incredible powers of observation.
[00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:23.500]   He can really feel the energy of a musical artist
[00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:25.140]   or, and he's produced other things too.
[00:41:25.140 --> 00:41:28.620]   He does great documentary, he's got his own great podcast,
[00:41:28.620 --> 00:41:31.140]   but he doesn't get absorbed by it.
[00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:32.380]   And I wanted to talk to you about this
[00:41:32.380 --> 00:41:37.380]   because I think for people that are very feeling,
[00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:41.780]   very sentient, or really in touch with that,
[00:41:41.780 --> 00:41:44.580]   the ability to like feel music,
[00:41:44.580 --> 00:41:46.180]   to feel other people's emotions,
[00:41:46.180 --> 00:41:50.660]   to really, that's a beautiful life to taste food,
[00:41:50.660 --> 00:41:53.900]   but there's a threshold beyond which
[00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:56.780]   we kind of lose ourselves in the experience of others
[00:41:56.780 --> 00:41:58.060]   and what's going on.
[00:41:58.060 --> 00:42:00.940]   Rick can go right up to that line
[00:42:00.940 --> 00:42:02.860]   and really see it and enjoy it,
[00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:06.340]   but it doesn't absorb him in a way that he has a place
[00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:08.060]   that he returns to that's in him.
[00:42:08.060 --> 00:42:10.460]   And the reason I discovered this is I said,
[00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:11.660]   "Wait, you don't drink alcohol."
[00:42:11.660 --> 00:42:12.500]   He said, "No."
[00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:13.320]   I said, "No drugs."
[00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:14.160]   He said, "No."
[00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:15.420]   Doesn't judge it, but he doesn't do it.
[00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:16.260]   I said, "Did you ever?"
[00:42:16.260 --> 00:42:17.080]   He said, "No."
[00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:19.540]   And I said, "Who comes up through music
[00:42:19.540 --> 00:42:21.700]   and never takes a sip of alcohol,
[00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:23.660]   goes to college and never took a sip of alcohol
[00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:24.540]   or tried any drug?"
[00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:26.340]   And again, I don't judge.
[00:42:26.340 --> 00:42:28.540]   I've talked about psychedelics on this podcast.
[00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:30.780]   I've talked about my own relationship to those,
[00:42:30.780 --> 00:42:32.860]   what I think are very interesting clinical trials
[00:42:32.860 --> 00:42:33.700]   and things of that sort.
[00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:36.340]   I think there's tremendous potential there.
[00:42:36.340 --> 00:42:37.620]   - I agree.
[00:42:37.620 --> 00:42:42.620]   - But what is it to be able to experience life
[00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:44.880]   in the richest way,
[00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:48.120]   but make sure that we don't get lost in feeling
[00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:49.240]   or in thought.
[00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:51.560]   It's like this ability to move back and forth
[00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:56.440]   seems to be the best definition of like a great life,
[00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:59.640]   in my opinion, because we need to do things each day.
[00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:01.040]   - I would say you don't even have to go back and forth.
[00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:02.440]   You can do it all at once.
[00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:04.000]   You can feel, you can think,
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.120]   and you can stay in the driver's seat
[00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:08.000]   and not be overwhelmed,
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.520]   either intellectually or emotionally.
[00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:12.520]   But I think it has a lot to do with,
[00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:13.880]   you were talking about Asian,
[00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:17.040]   Eastern like meditation practices.
[00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:19.320]   There's a little exercise I like to do with people
[00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:21.320]   where if they're struggling with a bad habit,
[00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:23.480]   I say, imagine the part of you
[00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:25.600]   that is always doing the bad thing,
[00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:27.840]   like smoking 20 packs a day or whatever.
[00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:32.320]   Imagine them as a wild thing in your left hand.
[00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:34.600]   And then imagine the part of you that hates him
[00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:37.600]   and says, "Stop smoking," in your right hand,
[00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:42.400]   and look at them and begin to see
[00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:44.200]   that they're both well-meaning,
[00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:46.400]   they're both exhausted,
[00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:49.120]   and you can wish them both well.
[00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:53.360]   So the wild child part is not thinking, it's just feeling.
[00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:56.600]   The controlling part is not feeling, it's just thinking.
[00:43:56.600 --> 00:43:58.640]   And if I can get people,
[00:43:58.640 --> 00:43:59.960]   and I have them put their hands out
[00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:02.080]   because I know it's gonna activate
[00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:03.880]   both sides of their brains,
[00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:07.240]   and then I have them wish these people well,
[00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:09.320]   maybe well, maybe happy,
[00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:13.400]   when they can feel compassion for both sides of themselves,
[00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:16.600]   then I ask them, "So who are you?"
[00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:20.440]   And who they've become is a compassionate witness,
[00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:24.720]   which is not thinking,
[00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:27.400]   and it's not feeling in the way we,
[00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:29.440]   it's not emotional.
[00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:33.280]   Emo, the word emotion means movement, disturbance.
[00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:38.280]   This part of one's being is not ever disturbed or moved.
[00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:42.440]   It's totally still and totally peaceful
[00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:44.480]   and completely compassionate.
[00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:46.160]   - It's like the ultimate parent.
[00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:47.880]   - Yes, it is.
[00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:49.160]   And Dick Schwartz,
[00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:51.600]   who came up with the model
[00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:53.640]   of internal family systems theory,
[00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:55.240]   I don't know if you've had him on the show.
[00:44:55.240 --> 00:44:57.160]   - Have not, but I'm learning more
[00:44:57.160 --> 00:44:59.320]   about internal family systems models.
[00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:00.800]   I learned about this first in the context
[00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:03.440]   of visiting a trauma healing center.
[00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:04.280]   - That's great for trauma.
[00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:06.000]   - And then people are now applying this
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:07.400]   to addiction as well.
[00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:09.080]   - Yeah.
[00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:10.640]   - I'll get his name from you later.
[00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:11.480]   - Richard Schwartz.
[00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:14.040]   Anyway, I was talking to him and he said,
[00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:16.120]   "There is this part, we all have different parts.
[00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:18.000]   There's a part of you that feels like a little kid
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:19.360]   and wants to curl up in bed.
[00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:21.360]   There's a part of you that wants to go rule the world,
[00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:23.360]   whatever your parts are."
[00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:25.520]   So he talks to people about these different parts.
[00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:26.680]   And then sometimes they say,
[00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:29.600]   "Oh, I've just come up against,
[00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:32.160]   there's someone here who's very still,
[00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:34.520]   who's very huge, who's very kind."
[00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:37.520]   And he calls it self with a capital S.
[00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:40.120]   And he says after thousands of patients,
[00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:41.920]   he'll say, "What part of you is that?"
[00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:44.600]   And they say, "Oh, this isn't a part like the others.
[00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:46.000]   This is who I am.
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:47.560]   This is who I am."
[00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:51.320]   And he believes that it's just one unified self.
[00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:56.320]   And for me, if I don't find and lock into that self,
[00:45:56.320 --> 00:46:00.760]   I am immediately swept away by my emotions and my brain,
[00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:04.360]   just like in a gale force winds.
[00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:08.560]   So I have to be very, not grounded,
[00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:13.560]   but centered and identified with this self
[00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:16.120]   before I can even leave the house.
[00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:17.320]   - How do you go about doing that?
[00:46:17.320 --> 00:46:18.920]   And one of the reasons I'm asking this
[00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:21.160]   is because I think everyone, including myself,
[00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:22.680]   would do well to be able to access
[00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:26.560]   this compassionate witness self.
[00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:28.960]   But also because so many people
[00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:31.040]   are on social media nowadays,
[00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:33.200]   where you can almost feel yourself
[00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:36.360]   getting pulled down on these trajectories,
[00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:39.480]   like the gravitational pull of a battle or a video,
[00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:41.640]   or even something that's delightful,
[00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:43.880]   but then you find like two hours went by
[00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:47.360]   and you over-consumed and under-created in some sense.
[00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:48.240]   - It's like junk food.
[00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:50.400]   It tastes delicious, but then you feel like, "Ah."
[00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:51.480]   - Yeah, it goes nowhere.
[00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:52.480]   - Yeah.
[00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:53.960]   - This sort of goes nowhere.
[00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:57.080]   So do you have a practice that you use
[00:46:57.080 --> 00:47:00.040]   to make sure that you're in that place?
[00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:02.300]   - I do, and it's called suffering.
[00:47:02.620 --> 00:47:03.560]   - (laughs)
[00:47:03.560 --> 00:47:04.400]   - It's very reliable.
[00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:05.220]   - Sorry, I lied.
[00:47:05.220 --> 00:47:06.060]   That made me laugh.
[00:47:06.060 --> 00:47:06.900]   Forgive me.
[00:47:06.900 --> 00:47:07.900]   - My best friend, suffering.
[00:47:07.900 --> 00:47:11.580]   I have a deeply love-hate relationship with suffering.
[00:47:11.580 --> 00:47:15.300]   If I'm, for example, I can barely look at Instagram
[00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:20.300]   because I will watch a monkey nursing a kitten,
[00:47:20.300 --> 00:47:23.220]   and then I will be down that rabbit hole so far.
[00:47:23.220 --> 00:47:24.060]   - You and me both.
[00:47:24.060 --> 00:47:26.340]   - And eight hours later, I'm, "Meh."
[00:47:26.340 --> 00:47:28.380]   But I will start to suffer.
[00:47:28.380 --> 00:47:30.740]   I will start to physically feel cramped.
[00:47:30.740 --> 00:47:32.540]   My eyes will start to hurt and water,
[00:47:32.540 --> 00:47:34.980]   and I will start to feel what you were saying,
[00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:37.860]   the grinding of the gear that is wrong.
[00:47:37.860 --> 00:47:41.200]   The machine isn't, it's not in structural integrity.
[00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:43.860]   It's like when your car starts making a funny sound,
[00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:45.700]   and you're like, "I should not ignore that."
[00:47:45.700 --> 00:47:48.500]   And it always feels like discomfort.
[00:47:48.500 --> 00:47:51.860]   Tension, anxiety, anger, any of those things.
[00:47:51.860 --> 00:47:56.020]   And then the practice of my life
[00:47:56.020 --> 00:47:57.940]   is to notice those sensations
[00:47:57.940 --> 00:48:00.360]   at a finer and more granular level
[00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:03.580]   so that the moment I'm off true,
[00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:07.560]   I can stop and say, "Okay, whew, out of integrity, okay."
[00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:08.780]   Now I'm into anxiety
[00:48:08.780 --> 00:48:10.740]   'cause a divided person is always anxious.
[00:48:10.740 --> 00:48:15.740]   So to get away from that, from anxiety, and back to true,
[00:48:15.740 --> 00:48:21.260]   I use the body, sit back, straighten my spine,
[00:48:21.260 --> 00:48:23.460]   take a deep breath, do all the things
[00:48:23.460 --> 00:48:25.020]   that I'm sure you do when you meditate.
[00:48:25.020 --> 00:48:28.020]   And then I sink into that part of myself
[00:48:28.020 --> 00:48:29.580]   that I was just trying to pull up
[00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:33.100]   for people with the two hands exercise.
[00:48:33.100 --> 00:48:34.780]   And I believe,
[00:48:34.780 --> 00:48:36.720]   you could probably tell me the truth of this,
[00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:40.440]   I believe that I've wired a pretty strong superhighway
[00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:43.920]   in my brain that goes, "Oops, suffering,
[00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:45.620]   find self with a capital S."
[00:48:45.620 --> 00:48:48.580]   And I've done it so many thousands of times
[00:48:48.580 --> 00:48:51.660]   that I think I have like a highly myelinated circuit
[00:48:51.660 --> 00:48:53.780]   that just goes there, shoop.
[00:48:53.780 --> 00:48:55.520]   And then no matter what's happening,
[00:48:55.520 --> 00:48:58.500]   I can usually just find it, feel it.
[00:48:58.500 --> 00:49:01.820]   And it's an exquisite sensation.
[00:49:01.820 --> 00:49:05.560]   It's like coming home completely over and over again.
[00:49:05.560 --> 00:49:09.380]   And now when I do an ideal day,
[00:49:09.380 --> 00:49:11.860]   everything else is incidental.
[00:49:11.860 --> 00:49:14.020]   The key is I'm in that self.
[00:49:14.020 --> 00:49:15.700]   - So the state is what's key.
[00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:20.700]   - Yes, and it is so, it has so much fun in this world.
[00:49:20.700 --> 00:49:23.760]   - And so you can walk around in that state.
[00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:25.140]   - Oh yeah, sure.
[00:49:26.020 --> 00:49:29.540]   So to be sure I understand,
[00:49:29.540 --> 00:49:32.120]   so say I wake up in the morning
[00:49:32.120 --> 00:49:34.940]   and I'm just like not feeling right
[00:49:34.940 --> 00:49:39.680]   or something triggers me or I don't know,
[00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:41.540]   just like I'm off center.
[00:49:41.540 --> 00:49:48.060]   You take that sensation of suffering
[00:49:48.060 --> 00:49:51.500]   and you don't fear it, you don't amplify it,
[00:49:51.500 --> 00:49:53.020]   you just kind of pay attention to it.
[00:49:53.020 --> 00:49:54.020]   - You pay attention to it.
[00:49:54.020 --> 00:49:58.380]   And here is the key thing, this is in my new book.
[00:49:58.380 --> 00:50:00.940]   I kept this a secret because it sounded so silly
[00:50:00.940 --> 00:50:03.940]   and I thought this would never go in the Ivy League.
[00:50:03.940 --> 00:50:07.100]   But there's something I call KIST, K-I-S-T,
[00:50:07.100 --> 00:50:11.580]   and it stands for kind internal self talk.
[00:50:11.580 --> 00:50:14.380]   So what do you call yourself when you think to yourself?
[00:50:14.380 --> 00:50:18.340]   Andrew, Andy, what do you call yourself?
[00:50:18.340 --> 00:50:20.300]   - You, yeah, just you.
[00:50:20.300 --> 00:50:23.860]   - So you'd be sitting there and you don't feel good,
[00:50:23.860 --> 00:50:24.700]   you don't feel right.
[00:50:24.700 --> 00:50:27.140]   The first thing you do is allow yourself
[00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:30.900]   to register every sensation without pushing back,
[00:50:30.900 --> 00:50:32.300]   without restricting it.
[00:50:32.300 --> 00:50:35.740]   People talk to me about bringing down their anxiety
[00:50:35.740 --> 00:50:37.860]   and I say, how do you feel if I told you
[00:50:37.860 --> 00:50:39.740]   I was gonna bring you down?
[00:50:39.740 --> 00:50:41.420]   That's not a nice thing to say.
[00:50:41.420 --> 00:50:43.140]   If I told you I'm here to understand you
[00:50:43.140 --> 00:50:45.560]   and care about you, better.
[00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:48.260]   So just allow yourself to feel all the suffering
[00:50:48.260 --> 00:50:52.260]   and then start saying kind things
[00:50:52.260 --> 00:50:54.220]   to the one who is suffering, even if it's just
[00:50:54.220 --> 00:50:57.140]   tiny suffering, just go, how are you?
[00:50:57.140 --> 00:50:57.980]   How you doing?
[00:50:57.980 --> 00:50:58.800]   Not great?
[00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:01.140]   Ah, okay, so there's some anxiety.
[00:51:01.140 --> 00:51:03.360]   Oh, your sinuses are blocked too.
[00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:06.620]   Oh, let's see, what could we do for you?
[00:51:06.620 --> 00:51:10.720]   Let's get you a hot drink and like a call
[00:51:10.720 --> 00:51:12.860]   with a good friend or a book or something.
[00:51:12.860 --> 00:51:17.220]   And you just actively work as your own caregiver
[00:51:17.220 --> 00:51:19.800]   from the moment you are conscious in the morning
[00:51:19.800 --> 00:51:22.000]   and what that does is it makes you so compassionate
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:24.540]   to other people 'cause you're not fighting
[00:51:24.540 --> 00:51:26.380]   the suffering in yourself.
[00:51:26.380 --> 00:51:31.060]   Yeah, people in pain are usually agitated and grumpy
[00:51:31.060 --> 00:51:34.140]   and so it's the inverse of that.
[00:51:34.140 --> 00:51:34.980]   Yeah.
[00:51:34.980 --> 00:51:36.020]   Yeah, I love this.
[00:51:36.020 --> 00:51:39.380]   I mean, in some sense, the words like self-parenting
[00:51:39.380 --> 00:51:41.660]   keep coming up in my mind because a lot of this
[00:51:41.660 --> 00:51:45.780]   is about learning to parent ourselves from the inside.
[00:51:45.780 --> 00:51:49.660]   And I do think that most, we hear about inner child stuff
[00:51:49.660 --> 00:51:51.900]   and I think inner child work is very interesting.
[00:51:51.900 --> 00:51:56.400]   I also think that as a biologist who spent the early part
[00:51:56.400 --> 00:51:58.060]   of my career on developmental neurobiology,
[00:51:58.060 --> 00:52:02.820]   like the same neural stuff is repurposed in adulthood.
[00:52:02.820 --> 00:52:05.360]   Like that's something that it's kind of obvious,
[00:52:05.360 --> 00:52:06.200]   but we overlook.
[00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:08.300]   Right, I'm like, I've got some inner adults here
[00:52:08.300 --> 00:52:10.060]   who aren't very happy too.
[00:52:10.060 --> 00:52:11.420]   Right, right, right.
[00:52:11.420 --> 00:52:14.780]   But the notion that like our attachments when we're young,
[00:52:14.780 --> 00:52:17.180]   somehow that like those neural circuits are set aside
[00:52:17.180 --> 00:52:20.020]   so then we can form more mature adult attachments.
[00:52:20.020 --> 00:52:21.300]   You know, it's like, no, that's crazy.
[00:52:21.300 --> 00:52:22.780]   We repurpose them.
[00:52:22.780 --> 00:52:25.780]   So we're working in an adult landscape
[00:52:25.780 --> 00:52:28.500]   with child based algorithms.
[00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:31.000]   And depending on how childhood went, you know,
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:33.180]   that either can be spectacular or so-so
[00:52:33.180 --> 00:52:34.380]   or a complete disaster.
[00:52:34.380 --> 00:52:35.460]   Usually it's a combination.
[00:52:35.460 --> 00:52:38.500]   That obstetrician at Harvard, I would bet my last dime
[00:52:38.500 --> 00:52:41.020]   that he was still working on the same circuits
[00:52:41.020 --> 00:52:43.940]   he used when he was five and they were pretty scary.
[00:52:43.940 --> 00:52:48.940]   You know, like, so yeah, we all have multiple causes
[00:52:49.740 --> 00:52:51.420]   of suffering, but we also have,
[00:52:51.420 --> 00:52:53.240]   I wouldn't actually call it inner parenting
[00:52:53.240 --> 00:52:55.860]   'cause that basically implies that only parents
[00:52:55.860 --> 00:52:57.980]   give that to children.
[00:52:57.980 --> 00:53:00.980]   And I think it's just humaning.
[00:53:00.980 --> 00:53:05.740]   If you are truly humane, if you are truly in a state
[00:53:05.740 --> 00:53:09.740]   of self with a capital S, there is nothing in you
[00:53:09.740 --> 00:53:13.500]   that wants to cause suffering for any other being.
[00:53:13.500 --> 00:53:14.560]   Right.
[00:53:14.560 --> 00:53:18.020]   And there's nothing in you that doesn't wanna help
[00:53:18.020 --> 00:53:20.500]   ease the suffering of the entire world.
[00:53:20.500 --> 00:53:23.700]   So again, now I'm into a kind of Asian modality
[00:53:23.700 --> 00:53:27.500]   of there's this Bodhisattva prayer that goes,
[00:53:27.500 --> 00:53:30.300]   for as long as space endures and as long
[00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:34.160]   as sentient beings exist, may I also abide
[00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:37.400]   that I might heal with my heart the miseries of the world.
[00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:41.100]   And that part of us is in everyone.
[00:53:41.100 --> 00:53:43.900]   And if we become those people,
[00:53:43.900 --> 00:53:46.820]   it won't just be parents being kind to children.
[00:53:46.820 --> 00:53:49.340]   It will be humans being kind to each other,
[00:53:49.340 --> 00:53:52.340]   the earth and all other beings.
[00:53:52.340 --> 00:53:55.180]   And we may actually make it into another century.
[00:53:55.180 --> 00:53:58.860]   Yeah, no, it's looking a little sketchy right now.
[00:53:58.860 --> 00:54:00.760]   I mean, things are tense.
[00:54:00.760 --> 00:54:06.700]   It sounds like it starts with self-love, compassion,
[00:54:06.700 --> 00:54:10.180]   like only from that place of compassionate witness,
[00:54:10.180 --> 00:54:13.300]   self with a capital S, excuse me,
[00:54:13.300 --> 00:54:16.500]   can we be at our best for others.
[00:54:16.500 --> 00:54:19.980]   I believe it's actually the only part of us that's real.
[00:54:19.980 --> 00:54:22.820]   And I talked a minute ago about people who are dying.
[00:54:22.820 --> 00:54:25.020]   They drop the pretense.
[00:54:25.020 --> 00:54:28.500]   They don't need the pretense of belonging
[00:54:28.500 --> 00:54:31.500]   to the material world or the material body anymore.
[00:54:31.500 --> 00:54:36.460]   And that radiance begins to gather in their eyes.
[00:54:36.460 --> 00:54:40.460]   And it's not new.
[00:54:40.460 --> 00:54:42.420]   It's what they came in with.
[00:54:42.420 --> 00:54:45.380]   If you've looked into the eyes of a young child,
[00:54:45.380 --> 00:54:48.180]   a little baby, you see the same thing.
[00:54:48.180 --> 00:54:50.140]   And it's only when people die
[00:54:50.140 --> 00:54:52.420]   that they put down everything else.
[00:54:52.420 --> 00:54:54.500]   Unless, as Eckhart Tolle says,
[00:54:54.500 --> 00:54:58.700]   you die before you die and learn that there is no death,
[00:54:58.700 --> 00:55:01.260]   because that self does not feel physical.
[00:55:01.260 --> 00:55:03.700]   It feels metaphysical.
[00:55:03.700 --> 00:55:09.380]   - If you would, let's drill into this a little bit more,
[00:55:09.380 --> 00:55:13.460]   'cause this is a high level, but at the same time,
[00:55:13.460 --> 00:55:16.700]   basic and yet abstract concept.
[00:55:16.700 --> 00:55:19.060]   And it's not often on this podcast
[00:55:19.060 --> 00:55:21.140]   that we talk about abstract concepts.
[00:55:21.140 --> 00:55:23.580]   We probably don't do it enough.
[00:55:23.580 --> 00:55:25.300]   We get like, I like to talk about protocols.
[00:55:25.300 --> 00:55:27.260]   You get your sunlight on clear days, you know?
[00:55:27.260 --> 00:55:28.580]   And I love that stuff too.
[00:55:28.580 --> 00:55:30.660]   But as probably people realize by now,
[00:55:30.660 --> 00:55:34.940]   I think a great life is bridging as many things,
[00:55:34.940 --> 00:55:36.820]   at least for me, as possible,
[00:55:36.820 --> 00:55:38.980]   and seeing the overlap in the Venn diagrams.
[00:55:40.260 --> 00:55:44.860]   So it's the only part of us that's real,
[00:55:44.860 --> 00:55:49.420]   meaning the other parts are just conditioned.
[00:55:49.420 --> 00:55:50.260]   I think you've said--
[00:55:50.260 --> 00:55:52.660]   - The other parts are impermanent.
[00:55:52.660 --> 00:55:54.020]   They will vanish.
[00:55:54.020 --> 00:55:56.060]   Everything, as Shakespeare says,
[00:55:56.060 --> 00:56:00.540]   everything will just disappear and leave not a rack behind.
[00:56:00.540 --> 00:56:03.340]   We are such stuff as dreams are made on.
[00:56:03.340 --> 00:56:08.220]   There is an experience that is common to individuals
[00:56:08.220 --> 00:56:09.940]   all over the world in different cultures
[00:56:09.940 --> 00:56:12.180]   at different times where they start to say
[00:56:12.180 --> 00:56:15.100]   they feel as if they've awakened from a dream.
[00:56:15.100 --> 00:56:17.260]   Plato did it with his cave analogy.
[00:56:17.260 --> 00:56:22.260]   He said, imagine that we all live chained in a cave
[00:56:22.260 --> 00:56:25.380]   and there's a fire behind us and we see shadows on the wall
[00:56:25.380 --> 00:56:26.700]   and that's what we call reality.
[00:56:26.700 --> 00:56:29.300]   And then someone gets out of the cave
[00:56:29.300 --> 00:56:32.540]   and goes outside and sees this three-dimensional world
[00:56:32.540 --> 00:56:34.260]   where everything's bright and mobile
[00:56:34.260 --> 00:56:35.500]   and goes back and says,
[00:56:35.500 --> 00:56:38.940]   people, the shadows on the wall are real.
[00:56:38.940 --> 00:56:40.780]   They're real shadows,
[00:56:40.780 --> 00:56:42.420]   but they're not the ultimate reality.
[00:56:42.420 --> 00:56:44.180]   You should come outside and see it.
[00:56:44.180 --> 00:56:46.980]   And Plato said, everybody would say he was crazy.
[00:56:46.980 --> 00:56:50.580]   And that's what academia says now.
[00:56:50.580 --> 00:56:51.420]   You're crazy.
[00:56:51.420 --> 00:56:53.980]   If you've ever had an experience where you felt like
[00:56:53.980 --> 00:56:57.180]   there was something realer than your physical self,
[00:56:57.180 --> 00:56:58.700]   you're crazy.
[00:56:58.700 --> 00:57:00.740]   Like, read Plato.
[00:57:00.740 --> 00:57:04.580]   - Well, it's interesting because a few years ago,
[00:57:04.580 --> 00:57:08.340]   so many concepts that I was intrigued by,
[00:57:08.340 --> 00:57:13.340]   breathwork, for instance, psychedelics, meditation.
[00:57:13.340 --> 00:57:17.380]   I mean, now people get federal grants to study this stuff.
[00:57:17.380 --> 00:57:20.140]   And we do reductionist work to try and understand.
[00:57:20.140 --> 00:57:22.420]   In fact, I had to disguise breathwork
[00:57:22.420 --> 00:57:24.740]   as a respiration physiology,
[00:57:24.740 --> 00:57:26.300]   which we did and we did a clinical trial.
[00:57:26.300 --> 00:57:28.660]   And lo and behold, certain patterns of breathing
[00:57:28.660 --> 00:57:31.100]   shift your internal state and your sleep and your anxiety.
[00:57:31.100 --> 00:57:33.660]   It's like a duh, it's like a giant duh,
[00:57:33.660 --> 00:57:35.980]   but it was scary territory for a while.
[00:57:35.980 --> 00:57:36.820]   - It is, yeah.
[00:57:36.820 --> 00:57:40.900]   - And now psychedelics have kind of broken through as,
[00:57:40.900 --> 00:57:45.020]   I mean, I just have to say this
[00:57:45.020 --> 00:57:46.420]   while touching my forehead.
[00:57:46.420 --> 00:57:51.540]   They adjust neuromodulators just like,
[00:57:51.540 --> 00:57:53.700]   but differently than certain drugs
[00:57:53.700 --> 00:57:55.880]   that adjust neuromodulators and everyone accepted.
[00:57:55.880 --> 00:57:58.300]   So the idea of changing neuromodulators
[00:57:58.300 --> 00:58:00.420]   to change conscious experience
[00:58:00.420 --> 00:58:03.380]   and in that altered experience
[00:58:03.380 --> 00:58:06.020]   to be able to achieve neuroplasticity is like a,
[00:58:06.020 --> 00:58:09.260]   it's also a big duh, of course it works that way.
[00:58:09.260 --> 00:58:12.820]   But six years ago, you'd get fired from the university
[00:58:12.820 --> 00:58:14.980]   if you said, well, maybe psilocybin
[00:58:14.980 --> 00:58:19.620]   could be an interesting compound for depressed people.
[00:58:19.620 --> 00:58:21.380]   And by the way, I'm not suggesting everyone run out
[00:58:21.380 --> 00:58:22.460]   and take a bunch of psilocybin,
[00:58:22.460 --> 00:58:23.420]   especially if you're depressed.
[00:58:23.420 --> 00:58:25.380]   - Yeah, and not without supervision,
[00:58:25.380 --> 00:58:28.580]   but if you can get somebody really good at it,
[00:58:28.580 --> 00:58:29.620]   I'm not saying do it either,
[00:58:29.620 --> 00:58:31.080]   but I'm not saying don't do it.
[00:58:31.080 --> 00:58:35.300]   - Right, and if you're more gun-shy on these things,
[00:58:35.300 --> 00:58:37.100]   contact a local university,
[00:58:37.100 --> 00:58:39.140]   they're likely doing a clinical trial on this.
[00:58:39.140 --> 00:58:42.020]   We can provide some links to clinical trials.
[00:58:42.020 --> 00:58:44.540]   I think the data are incredibly interesting.
[00:58:44.540 --> 00:58:48.340]   In any case, I guess the point is that
[00:58:48.340 --> 00:58:51.340]   I feel like academia is kind of coming around
[00:58:51.340 --> 00:58:55.540]   probably due to the suffering of people in it,
[00:58:55.540 --> 00:58:56.820]   where then they know somebody
[00:58:56.820 --> 00:58:59.220]   who achieved some relief through meditation
[00:58:59.220 --> 00:59:01.140]   or some benefits of meditation.
[00:59:01.140 --> 00:59:03.980]   So now, everyone I think accepts
[00:59:03.980 --> 00:59:05.860]   like meditation can be very useful
[00:59:05.860 --> 00:59:09.420]   for lowering stress and altering conscious experience.
[00:59:09.420 --> 00:59:12.140]   This is not new stuff, as everyone knows,
[00:59:12.140 --> 00:59:13.580]   it's gone back thousands of years.
[00:59:13.580 --> 00:59:18.580]   So it sounds like getting into the capital S self,
[00:59:18.580 --> 00:59:21.860]   the compassionate witness, is step number one.
[00:59:21.860 --> 00:59:25.220]   And so I just wanna make sure that we make clear
[00:59:25.220 --> 00:59:26.500]   how one does that.
[00:59:26.500 --> 00:59:27.660]   - Yeah, it's not step number one.
[00:59:27.660 --> 00:59:29.660]   Step number one is suffering.
[00:59:29.660 --> 00:59:30.820]   We all have that.
[00:59:30.820 --> 00:59:33.060]   You may have never felt good in your life, listener,
[00:59:33.060 --> 00:59:34.940]   but you have suffered, that's for sure.
[00:59:34.940 --> 00:59:37.100]   That's the first noble truth of Buddhism.
[00:59:37.100 --> 00:59:39.220]   There is suffering in this life.
[00:59:39.220 --> 00:59:42.220]   Pay attention to your suffering without fighting it.
[00:59:42.220 --> 00:59:43.180]   Allow it to be there.
[00:59:43.180 --> 00:59:44.260]   I did this meditation.
[00:59:44.260 --> 00:59:47.500]   If something's physically painful or emotionally painful,
[00:59:47.500 --> 00:59:50.380]   I used to say, "Let go, let go," to myself.
[00:59:50.380 --> 00:59:51.340]   Didn't work.
[00:59:51.340 --> 00:59:55.620]   So one day I said, "All right, you can stay, let it stay."
[00:59:55.620 --> 00:59:58.180]   And so I do a let stay meditation.
[00:59:58.180 --> 00:59:59.580]   If there's pain, let it stay.
[00:59:59.580 --> 01:00:01.060]   If there's sorrow, let it stay.
[01:00:01.060 --> 01:00:04.660]   And as soon as I let it stay, it begins to change.
[01:00:04.660 --> 01:00:07.060]   So first step is suffering.
[01:00:07.060 --> 01:00:11.140]   Second step is compassionate attention to one's suffering
[01:00:11.140 --> 01:00:12.620]   with no resistance.
[01:00:12.620 --> 01:00:17.240]   And the third step is to follow the compassion
[01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:20.460]   that is naturally being directed toward that suffering
[01:00:20.460 --> 01:00:22.780]   until you find yourself centered in it.
[01:00:22.780 --> 01:00:24.660]   And that is a huge relief.
[01:00:24.660 --> 01:00:28.060]   And I've done this in massive physical pain.
[01:00:28.060 --> 01:00:30.860]   I've done it when I just lost people I love.
[01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:34.940]   It's a very powerful, maybe not a panacea,
[01:00:34.940 --> 01:00:36.020]   but not that far from it.
[01:00:36.020 --> 01:00:39.780]   If you can get there, you're still suffering,
[01:00:39.780 --> 01:00:43.020]   but there's a peace that holds the suffering
[01:00:43.020 --> 01:00:48.860]   so lovingly that it no longer concerns you.
[01:00:48.860 --> 01:00:52.460]   So on one level that you're suffering,
[01:00:52.460 --> 01:00:56.140]   and on a different level, which feels more real to me,
[01:00:56.140 --> 01:01:01.140]   there's only peace and compassion and wonder and joy.
[01:01:01.140 --> 01:01:03.500]   And somebody asked me once,
[01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:06.820]   if there's a metaphysical reality, why is there suffering?
[01:01:06.820 --> 01:01:08.660]   And I just heard coming out of my mouth
[01:01:08.660 --> 01:01:12.660]   because the self loves experience
[01:01:12.660 --> 01:01:14.240]   and is not afraid to suffer.
[01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:16.900]   It's not afraid.
[01:01:16.900 --> 01:01:21.460]   So then staying in that is highly motivated
[01:01:21.460 --> 01:01:24.500]   by the suffering you feel when you leave.
[01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:27.640]   So to me, that's first step, suffer.
[01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:29.460]   Second step, pay attention to suffering.
[01:01:29.460 --> 01:01:32.920]   Third step, follow compassion to its origin.
[01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:35.740]   Fourth step, never stop doing that.
[01:01:35.740 --> 01:01:38.460]   - And every day.
[01:01:38.460 --> 01:01:41.380]   - Every minute, yeah.
[01:01:41.380 --> 01:01:42.620]   - Yeah, this is very relevant to me.
[01:01:42.620 --> 01:01:45.900]   I have always wondered about,
[01:01:45.900 --> 01:01:48.300]   like, do you push back against the feeling?
[01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:49.900]   Do you live with the feeling?
[01:01:49.900 --> 01:01:51.100]   Do you let it amplify?
[01:01:51.100 --> 01:01:54.460]   It's, there's so much contradiction
[01:01:54.460 --> 01:01:58.940]   inside of the typical discussion of these kinds of things.
[01:01:58.940 --> 01:02:00.700]   That's one of the reasons I love your work so much
[01:02:00.700 --> 01:02:03.840]   is that you don't tell people what to do,
[01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:05.580]   but you provide paths.
[01:02:05.580 --> 01:02:06.420]   - Hope so.
[01:02:06.420 --> 01:02:09.840]   - Absolutely you do, absolutely.
[01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:14.980]   I'd like to talk about two things.
[01:02:14.980 --> 01:02:17.460]   You know, before I came in here, I did a little meditation.
[01:02:17.460 --> 01:02:19.500]   I do this before every episode,
[01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:22.860]   but today I just, it like took only like a minute
[01:02:22.860 --> 01:02:24.820]   'cause it came to me so fast,
[01:02:24.820 --> 01:02:27.140]   which is the two words that popped to mind were,
[01:02:27.140 --> 01:02:29.260]   you know, what's real, what is true.
[01:02:29.260 --> 01:02:31.260]   I mean, I think so much of what we're talking about
[01:02:31.260 --> 01:02:34.740]   in so much of life is like, what's real, what's true.
[01:02:34.740 --> 01:02:37.340]   Certainly out in the world, but like in us.
[01:02:37.340 --> 01:02:40.900]   What I'm hearing is that at some level,
[01:02:40.900 --> 01:02:43.700]   we need to not trust our thinking,
[01:02:43.700 --> 01:02:44.660]   but of course there are times
[01:02:44.660 --> 01:02:46.580]   when we need to trust our thinking.
[01:02:46.580 --> 01:02:48.740]   And then of course we're receiving messages
[01:02:48.740 --> 01:02:50.620]   about what's real, what's not real,
[01:02:50.620 --> 01:02:51.640]   what's true, what's not true.
[01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:52.560]   Sometimes about us.
[01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:54.900]   I mean, there's all this childhood programming.
[01:02:54.900 --> 01:02:56.140]   How do we start to sort through this?
[01:02:56.140 --> 01:02:57.940]   I'm guessing that it has something to do
[01:02:57.940 --> 01:03:00.940]   with being in that compassionate witness place,
[01:03:00.940 --> 01:03:03.580]   but let's say what you've experienced in your life,
[01:03:03.580 --> 01:03:05.180]   I know because you've written and talked about this.
[01:03:05.180 --> 01:03:06.380]   And I certainly have now
[01:03:06.380 --> 01:03:10.000]   that by some interesting twist of fate,
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:11.820]   I'm a public facing person.
[01:03:11.820 --> 01:03:16.820]   People saying things about you or about me that are not true
[01:03:18.300 --> 01:03:22.420]   or that are judgments that don't feel good.
[01:03:22.420 --> 01:03:25.020]   And we are not alone in this.
[01:03:25.020 --> 01:03:26.300]   You don't have to be public facing
[01:03:26.300 --> 01:03:27.500]   in order to experience this.
[01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:31.340]   People all the time are being told they are stupid.
[01:03:31.340 --> 01:03:33.420]   Sometimes they're being told they are brilliant
[01:03:33.420 --> 01:03:35.380]   and they know they're not brilliant.
[01:03:35.380 --> 01:03:36.980]   This can go in every direction.
[01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:40.040]   How are we supposed to hold the narratives,
[01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:43.220]   the voices that we hear in our head and outside us
[01:03:43.220 --> 01:03:45.540]   in a way that really allows us
[01:03:45.540 --> 01:03:48.920]   to be our best essential selves?
[01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:52.400]   Well, can I reverse it and talk about what's true first?
[01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:55.820]   So I remember sitting when I was 17
[01:03:55.820 --> 01:03:58.820]   in the Lamont Library at Harvard,
[01:03:58.820 --> 01:04:01.380]   contemplating ending my life and like-
[01:04:01.380 --> 01:04:02.700]   Actually ending your own.
[01:04:02.700 --> 01:04:05.120]   Yes, yes.
[01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:09.640]   And looking at the equally miserable scratchings
[01:04:09.640 --> 01:04:12.220]   that other teenagers had put in the wood there.
[01:04:12.220 --> 01:04:13.900]   And I thought, okay,
[01:04:13.900 --> 01:04:15.500]   they say the truth will set you free.
[01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:18.260]   All right, I'll give it a try.
[01:04:18.260 --> 01:04:23.260]   And I just started trying to find out what was true.
[01:04:23.260 --> 01:04:25.260]   And I read through all the works
[01:04:25.260 --> 01:04:27.380]   of the greatest philosophers
[01:04:27.380 --> 01:04:30.240]   until I got to Immanuel Kant who says,
[01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:31.860]   "Everything is screened through our perception
[01:04:31.860 --> 01:04:34.380]   "so we can't know that anything is true for certain."
[01:04:34.380 --> 01:04:36.500]   And I felt such relief.
[01:04:36.500 --> 01:04:39.560]   Okay, I can't intellectually know what's true.
[01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:42.100]   Then if it's not true,
[01:04:42.100 --> 01:04:43.800]   if I can't intellectually know something's true
[01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:46.580]   because everything's subjective, what's useful?
[01:04:46.580 --> 01:04:49.780]   What feels like truth to the body?
[01:04:49.780 --> 01:04:52.620]   And I was interested that, for example,
[01:04:52.620 --> 01:04:57.180]   polygraph machines work because the body hates to lie.
[01:04:57.180 --> 01:05:03.740]   It starts to send up a whole bunch of, you know,
[01:05:03.740 --> 01:05:07.140]   activation of stress systems
[01:05:07.140 --> 01:05:09.140]   and puts you in fight or flight and everything
[01:05:09.140 --> 01:05:11.780]   when you tell a lie or when you keep a secret.
[01:05:11.780 --> 01:05:13.960]   So I just started thinking, all right,
[01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:18.960]   what makes my body contract and weaken?
[01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:22.960]   And what makes my body feel peaceful, centered, and grounded?
[01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:24.440]   And you do so much work with the body.
[01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:26.580]   I love that you're a brain-body scientist
[01:05:26.580 --> 01:05:30.040]   because the body is incredibly wise.
[01:05:30.040 --> 01:05:34.000]   So I just started letting myself test things.
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:38.320]   Like I was raised Mormon and very, very Mormon.
[01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:40.280]   So, okay, Mormonism.
[01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:44.700]   Oh boy, that doesn't make me feel good at all.
[01:05:44.700 --> 01:05:45.660]   - It wasn't for you.
[01:05:45.660 --> 01:05:47.080]   - No.
[01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:50.300]   And, okay, so God is not a white man
[01:05:50.300 --> 01:05:52.360]   who lives near the planet Kolob.
[01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:55.980]   Okay, that is not true.
[01:05:55.980 --> 01:05:58.060]   Okay, that feels better, okay.
[01:05:58.060 --> 01:06:03.060]   So I started following what made my body relax
[01:06:03.060 --> 01:06:06.620]   because my whole body, as I said a few minutes ago,
[01:06:06.620 --> 01:06:08.740]   is far more sophisticated,
[01:06:08.740 --> 01:06:13.440]   has spent far more time being tinkered with by evolution
[01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:16.020]   than my human ability to think in language.
[01:06:16.020 --> 01:06:19.940]   So it has a response to truth or falsehood
[01:06:19.940 --> 01:06:21.740]   that's more subtle and sophisticated
[01:06:21.740 --> 01:06:24.100]   than my intellectual knowledge.
[01:06:24.100 --> 01:06:27.260]   That's how I made the decision to keep my son.
[01:06:27.260 --> 01:06:29.660]   That's how I've made almost all my decisions.
[01:06:29.660 --> 01:06:31.540]   Does it make my body relax?
[01:06:31.540 --> 01:06:33.960]   And then does the mind come to the party
[01:06:33.960 --> 01:06:35.660]   and make the math work?
[01:06:35.660 --> 01:06:39.780]   Okay, Mormonism says that all the American Indians
[01:06:39.780 --> 01:06:42.620]   are descended from a group of Israelites
[01:06:42.620 --> 01:06:47.560]   who came across in 600 BC in a boat to the Americas.
[01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:49.780]   Okay, does the math work?
[01:06:49.780 --> 01:06:51.820]   What does the genetic evidence say?
[01:06:51.820 --> 01:06:54.940]   No, they came over the Aleutian Straits
[01:06:54.940 --> 01:06:57.780]   and down into the Americas.
[01:06:57.780 --> 01:07:00.300]   When I was living in Utah,
[01:07:00.300 --> 01:07:05.300]   they excommunicated a DNA expert from the Mormon church
[01:07:05.380 --> 01:07:09.700]   for doing the data, for finding the data
[01:07:09.700 --> 01:07:13.900]   that said that Mormonism's claims were wrong.
[01:07:13.900 --> 01:07:16.420]   So something that makes my body relax
[01:07:16.420 --> 01:07:20.300]   where it's also logically coherent.
[01:07:20.300 --> 01:07:22.200]   That's the first thing.
[01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:25.740]   And then what you find is if you really pursue that,
[01:07:25.740 --> 01:07:28.260]   what is true, what is true, what is true,
[01:07:28.260 --> 01:07:30.780]   everything that makes you suffer
[01:07:30.780 --> 01:07:34.220]   turns out to have flaws in the logic,
[01:07:34.220 --> 01:07:38.900]   including I will die, because I can't know.
[01:07:38.900 --> 01:07:40.660]   I have no idea.
[01:07:40.660 --> 01:07:43.820]   So to say that I will go out like a candle
[01:07:43.820 --> 01:07:47.060]   when my body dies is just as fundamentalist
[01:07:47.060 --> 01:07:50.020]   as saying I'm gonna go sit on a cloud and play a harp.
[01:07:50.020 --> 01:07:52.820]   I don't know.
[01:07:52.820 --> 01:07:55.380]   Nisargadatta Maharaj, one of my favorite yogis,
[01:07:55.380 --> 01:07:59.340]   says the only true assertion that the mind can make
[01:07:59.340 --> 01:08:01.740]   is I do not know.
[01:08:02.780 --> 01:08:05.300]   But you can feel what feels right to you.
[01:08:05.300 --> 01:08:08.500]   So that's what ends up being real.
[01:08:08.500 --> 01:08:12.780]   What's left over when you eliminate all the things
[01:08:12.780 --> 01:08:15.380]   that feel deeply untrue to your body
[01:08:15.380 --> 01:08:18.100]   and don't make logical sense?
[01:08:18.100 --> 01:08:19.740]   And some of those are things that our culture
[01:08:19.740 --> 01:08:21.100]   is very, very fond of.
[01:08:21.100 --> 01:08:23.980]   Like everything has to be measured or it's not real.
[01:08:23.980 --> 01:08:25.100]   Is that true?
[01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:27.300]   - Right, so it sounds like challenging
[01:08:27.300 --> 01:08:31.620]   or sitting with doctrine and labels
[01:08:31.620 --> 01:08:34.180]   and stories that we've heard
[01:08:34.180 --> 01:08:36.140]   and that maybe we've internalized.
[01:08:36.140 --> 01:08:37.620]   - Oh, we've internalized them, yeah.
[01:08:37.620 --> 01:08:40.940]   - Yeah, and systematically exploring
[01:08:40.940 --> 01:08:43.100]   how those make us feel in our body.
[01:08:43.100 --> 01:08:44.420]   - Yeah.
[01:08:44.420 --> 01:08:45.660]   - I'd like to take a brief break
[01:08:45.660 --> 01:08:48.380]   and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Waking Up.
[01:08:48.380 --> 01:08:49.900]   Waking Up is a meditation app
[01:08:49.900 --> 01:08:52.380]   that offers hundreds of guided meditation programs,
[01:08:52.380 --> 01:08:55.740]   mindfulness trainings, yoga nidra sessions, and more.
[01:08:55.740 --> 01:08:59.020]   I started practicing meditation when I was about 15 years old
[01:08:59.020 --> 01:09:01.700]   and it made a profound impact on my life.
[01:09:01.700 --> 01:09:03.060]   And by now, there are thousands
[01:09:03.060 --> 01:09:04.620]   of quality peer-reviewed studies
[01:09:04.620 --> 01:09:07.880]   that emphasize how useful mindfulness meditation can be
[01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:10.620]   for improving our focus, managing stress and anxiety,
[01:09:10.620 --> 01:09:12.900]   improving our mood, and much more.
[01:09:12.900 --> 01:09:15.220]   In recent years, I started using the Waking Up app
[01:09:15.220 --> 01:09:16.940]   for my meditations because I find it
[01:09:16.940 --> 01:09:18.980]   to be a terrific resource for allowing me
[01:09:18.980 --> 01:09:21.940]   to really be consistent with my meditation practice.
[01:09:21.940 --> 01:09:23.900]   Many people start a meditation practice
[01:09:23.900 --> 01:09:25.340]   and experience some benefits,
[01:09:25.340 --> 01:09:27.100]   but many people also have challenges
[01:09:27.100 --> 01:09:28.740]   keeping up with that practice.
[01:09:28.740 --> 01:09:30.260]   What I and so many other people love
[01:09:30.260 --> 01:09:32.340]   about the Waking Up app is that it has a lot
[01:09:32.340 --> 01:09:34.100]   of different meditations to choose from.
[01:09:34.100 --> 01:09:36.660]   And those meditations are of different durations.
[01:09:36.660 --> 01:09:38.220]   So it makes it very easy to keep up
[01:09:38.220 --> 01:09:39.740]   with your meditation practice,
[01:09:39.740 --> 01:09:41.660]   both from the perspective of novelty,
[01:09:41.660 --> 01:09:43.340]   you never get tired of those meditations,
[01:09:43.340 --> 01:09:44.900]   there's always something new to explore
[01:09:44.900 --> 01:09:46.180]   and to learn about yourself
[01:09:46.180 --> 01:09:48.580]   and about the effectiveness of meditation.
[01:09:48.580 --> 01:09:51.260]   And you can always fit meditation into your schedule,
[01:09:51.260 --> 01:09:54.060]   even if you only have two or three minutes per day
[01:09:54.060 --> 01:09:55.180]   in which to meditate.
[01:09:55.180 --> 01:09:56.820]   I also really like doing yoga nidra
[01:09:56.820 --> 01:09:59.220]   or what is sometimes called non-sleep deep rest
[01:09:59.220 --> 01:10:00.780]   for about 10 or 20 minutes,
[01:10:00.780 --> 01:10:03.020]   because it is a great way to restore mental
[01:10:03.020 --> 01:10:05.220]   and physical vigor without the tiredness
[01:10:05.220 --> 01:10:06.660]   that some people experience when they wake up
[01:10:06.660 --> 01:10:07.940]   from a conventional nap.
[01:10:07.940 --> 01:10:09.500]   If you'd like to try the Waking Up app,
[01:10:09.500 --> 01:10:12.340]   please go to wakingup.com/huberman,
[01:10:12.340 --> 01:10:14.420]   where you can access a free 30-day trial.
[01:10:14.420 --> 01:10:17.300]   Again, that's wakingup.com/huberman
[01:10:17.300 --> 01:10:19.860]   to access a free 30-day trial.
[01:10:19.860 --> 01:10:24.420]   I recall the inverse of the perfect day exercise
[01:10:24.420 --> 01:10:25.980]   was another one that I did,
[01:10:25.980 --> 01:10:27.900]   which was like, just call it what it was.
[01:10:27.900 --> 01:10:30.900]   It was like the sucky day, like the shitty day, right?
[01:10:30.900 --> 01:10:34.100]   Or just where you'd imagine something really terrible
[01:10:34.100 --> 01:10:36.820]   and then how it would cause the body to contract.
[01:10:36.820 --> 01:10:37.660]   - Oh, yeah.
[01:10:37.660 --> 01:10:42.660]   - And to recognize the other side of the coin, right?
[01:10:42.660 --> 01:10:45.300]   And just learning that relationship
[01:10:45.300 --> 01:10:47.740]   between the body and thought.
[01:10:47.740 --> 01:10:51.160]   I mean, I can say from my own experience
[01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:53.980]   that one of the biggest mistakes I ever made
[01:10:54.900 --> 01:10:58.700]   was teaching myself to be more resilient
[01:10:58.700 --> 01:11:00.260]   to certain forms of stress.
[01:11:00.260 --> 01:11:01.100]   - Really?
[01:11:01.100 --> 01:11:03.020]   - One of the worst mistakes I ever made.
[01:11:03.020 --> 01:11:03.860]   - Say more.
[01:11:03.860 --> 01:11:05.980]   - I mean, I, and my lab studies stress,
[01:11:05.980 --> 01:11:08.980]   and I talk about stress relief and physiological size
[01:11:08.980 --> 01:11:13.180]   are a great way to reduce real-time stress.
[01:11:13.180 --> 01:11:14.500]   And I stand by that.
[01:11:14.500 --> 01:11:15.520]   So I'm not talking about that.
[01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:18.140]   I stand by meditation and saunas
[01:11:18.140 --> 01:11:20.300]   and all the things that make us feel, vacation,
[01:11:20.300 --> 01:11:21.340]   the things that relax us.
[01:11:21.340 --> 01:11:24.460]   So I'm not saying the ability to modulate stress
[01:11:24.460 --> 01:11:27.680]   is incredibly powerful and useful.
[01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:30.520]   I believe that for sure.
[01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:32.620]   But when I was a kid,
[01:11:32.620 --> 01:11:35.340]   I wasn't the kid that was gonna hold the firecracker
[01:11:35.340 --> 01:11:37.100]   till the last second.
[01:11:37.100 --> 01:11:40.820]   I wasn't the kid that would do the really daring thing.
[01:11:40.820 --> 01:11:42.340]   I had friends like that.
[01:11:42.340 --> 01:11:45.300]   And I felt kind of sheepish about that.
[01:11:45.300 --> 01:11:46.980]   - Those friends are probably dead by now.
[01:11:46.980 --> 01:11:49.060]   - They're not doing well.
[01:11:49.060 --> 01:11:49.900]   That's true.
[01:11:49.980 --> 01:11:54.980]   And I grew up in the then very parentless community
[01:11:54.980 --> 01:11:59.300]   of skateboarders that, and a lot of us were really wild.
[01:11:59.300 --> 01:12:01.900]   We were very free, which I love, the freedom part,
[01:12:01.900 --> 01:12:04.340]   but there was a lot of mayhem and craziness,
[01:12:04.340 --> 01:12:05.480]   especially back then.
[01:12:05.480 --> 01:12:08.100]   And it's a beautiful culture.
[01:12:08.100 --> 01:12:10.300]   I'm still friends with a lot of those folks,
[01:12:10.300 --> 01:12:13.460]   but those cultures, yeah,
[01:12:13.460 --> 01:12:15.540]   split off basically into thirds over time,
[01:12:15.540 --> 01:12:16.740]   about a third dead or in jail,
[01:12:16.740 --> 01:12:19.580]   about a third doing incredibly well personally
[01:12:19.580 --> 01:12:21.100]   and professionally, incredibly well.
[01:12:21.100 --> 01:12:23.540]   And then a third like doing well,
[01:12:23.540 --> 01:12:27.660]   but they're not like still as ambitious about that.
[01:12:27.660 --> 01:12:29.180]   They're more focused on their personal lives
[01:12:29.180 --> 01:12:30.980]   and I hope that's what they wanna be doing.
[01:12:30.980 --> 01:12:34.180]   So that's kind of how it broke down.
[01:12:34.180 --> 01:12:37.740]   But I remember as a young kid and then in that culture,
[01:12:37.740 --> 01:12:41.820]   like learning to push myself past the feeling of like,
[01:12:41.820 --> 01:12:44.820]   this is dangerous to the point where as I got older
[01:12:44.820 --> 01:12:46.740]   and my body eventually got stronger
[01:12:46.740 --> 01:12:48.400]   because back then I was always getting hurt,
[01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:51.460]   which is why I left that sport, wasn't very good.
[01:12:51.460 --> 01:12:53.100]   For the record, it wasn't very good.
[01:12:53.100 --> 01:12:55.660]   Good enough, but not where I wanted to be.
[01:12:55.660 --> 01:12:58.340]   That over time, I remember when I started doing science,
[01:12:58.340 --> 01:13:00.340]   I realized this is crazy.
[01:13:00.340 --> 01:13:03.140]   Skateboarding, you fall, you hurt yourself so badly,
[01:13:03.140 --> 01:13:04.600]   you can't do it anymore.
[01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:05.800]   That doesn't happen with studying.
[01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:08.700]   So I'll just study until I collapse.
[01:13:08.700 --> 01:13:11.940]   I'll just work until I'm sick.
[01:13:11.940 --> 01:13:15.260]   I'll just, you know, like that person down the hall
[01:13:15.260 --> 01:13:16.580]   puts in 80 hours.
[01:13:16.580 --> 01:13:18.160]   Well, then I'll do a hundred
[01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:20.720]   and I'm not a competitive person by nature.
[01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:24.240]   Or even worse, you know, in my mid forties,
[01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:26.180]   getting into like stupid stuff,
[01:13:26.180 --> 01:13:28.800]   like cage exit, great white shark diving
[01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:30.920]   to the point where I had an air failure.
[01:13:30.920 --> 01:13:31.760]   - Oh my God.
[01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:33.520]   - And this is all, you know, this whole thing.
[01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:35.080]   And then coming back from that, I'm like,
[01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:36.000]   what am I doing?
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.480]   And what had happened is I learned to override
[01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:40.360]   the signals of the body.
[01:13:40.360 --> 01:13:43.240]   And it was like, when is enough enough?
[01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:46.520]   It's like when the reaper comes, you know?
[01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:50.780]   And so I think that if we don't listen to the signals
[01:13:50.780 --> 01:13:55.140]   that our body says and we learn to override them repeatedly
[01:13:55.140 --> 01:13:57.100]   and systematically, we can place ourselves
[01:13:57.100 --> 01:14:00.860]   into real psychological, emotional, and physical danger.
[01:14:00.860 --> 01:14:04.000]   And I just like, I don't know why,
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.660]   I just felt like this was a need to do this
[01:14:06.660 --> 01:14:07.860]   in order to grow up.
[01:14:07.860 --> 01:14:10.740]   And now I try and do the exact opposite.
[01:14:10.740 --> 01:14:12.380]   It's like, and then I feel bad.
[01:14:12.380 --> 01:14:13.220]   I feel kind of lazy.
[01:14:13.220 --> 01:14:15.700]   I'm like, oh, I'm not like running at 5 a.m.
[01:14:15.700 --> 01:14:17.660]   I'm like sleeping at 5 a.m.
[01:14:17.660 --> 01:14:21.620]   I'm doing yoga nidra at 7 a.m.
[01:14:21.620 --> 01:14:22.940]   'Cause I didn't feel I slept enough.
[01:14:22.940 --> 01:14:25.020]   And then I have friends in the public facing,
[01:14:25.020 --> 01:14:28.140]   you know, health space that are like, they push so hard.
[01:14:28.140 --> 01:14:29.580]   I'm like, I'm lazy.
[01:14:29.580 --> 01:14:32.140]   And then, so it can go too far.
[01:14:32.140 --> 01:14:34.420]   - Well, we have this culture of push, push, push,
[01:14:34.420 --> 01:14:36.080]   produce, produce, produce.
[01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:39.340]   One of my favorite heroes along with Oliver Sacks
[01:14:39.340 --> 01:14:41.840]   is Ian McGilchrist at Oxford.
[01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:43.380]   I love that man.
[01:14:43.380 --> 01:14:45.260]   I may someday, he may wake up,
[01:14:45.260 --> 01:14:49.060]   someday just find me crouched on his bed watching him sleep.
[01:14:49.060 --> 01:14:51.260]   He's like, he's not just a neurologist.
[01:14:51.260 --> 01:14:52.100]   - Ian, don't be scared.
[01:14:52.100 --> 01:14:54.840]   - Not in a creepy way, not in a creepy way, sir.
[01:14:54.840 --> 01:14:59.940]   But he talks about how our particular culture
[01:14:59.940 --> 01:15:02.700]   for the last few hundred years has veered towards stuff
[01:15:02.700 --> 01:15:04.540]   that is preferentially favored
[01:15:04.540 --> 01:15:05.980]   by the left hemisphere of the brain.
[01:15:05.980 --> 01:15:07.820]   And it has to do with grasping things
[01:15:07.820 --> 01:15:09.780]   and producing physical things
[01:15:09.780 --> 01:15:12.780]   and getting things to happen, controlling them.
[01:15:12.780 --> 01:15:15.140]   Where the right side of the brain,
[01:15:15.140 --> 01:15:18.700]   and of course, it's all, I'm oversimplifying massively,
[01:15:18.700 --> 01:15:21.340]   but functions like meaning, synthesis,
[01:15:21.340 --> 01:15:25.580]   combinations of different bits of knowledge,
[01:15:25.580 --> 01:15:28.100]   we're moving away from those.
[01:15:28.100 --> 01:15:31.060]   And one of my good friends is Jill Bolte-Taylor who had,
[01:15:31.060 --> 01:15:32.380]   she was a Harvard neuroanatomist
[01:15:32.380 --> 01:15:34.860]   and she had a massive left hemisphere stroke.
[01:15:34.860 --> 01:15:36.140]   And so she suddenly,
[01:15:36.140 --> 01:15:38.780]   she watched her left hemisphere go off.
[01:15:38.780 --> 01:15:41.900]   She had a brain bleed and it would pulse.
[01:15:41.900 --> 01:15:44.460]   So her left hemisphere would be there
[01:15:44.460 --> 01:15:46.140]   and she'd see everything as solid
[01:15:46.140 --> 01:15:50.780]   and measurable and verbal, and then it would go off.
[01:15:50.780 --> 01:15:54.740]   And she was in a world where she was like a fluid
[01:15:54.740 --> 01:15:56.300]   the size of the universe.
[01:15:56.300 --> 01:15:58.140]   And she would watch, she was in the shower
[01:15:58.140 --> 01:16:01.100]   and she watched her hand on the tiles
[01:16:01.100 --> 01:16:03.980]   dissolve into fields of energy.
[01:16:03.980 --> 01:16:05.820]   And you were talking about energy earlier.
[01:16:05.820 --> 01:16:08.780]   She said by the time her left hemisphere
[01:16:08.780 --> 01:16:10.460]   had shut down completely,
[01:16:10.460 --> 01:16:12.980]   she managed to get a phone call made.
[01:16:12.980 --> 01:16:16.100]   She couldn't talk by the time the phone call went through.
[01:16:16.100 --> 01:16:19.700]   She got to a hospital, took her eight years
[01:16:19.700 --> 01:16:21.660]   to come back to full functioning.
[01:16:21.660 --> 01:16:23.300]   But she said during that time,
[01:16:23.300 --> 01:16:25.220]   I did not know people's names.
[01:16:25.220 --> 01:16:26.420]   I didn't know the word person,
[01:16:26.420 --> 01:16:29.260]   but boy, could I feel people's energy.
[01:16:29.260 --> 01:16:32.540]   And as she healed, she didn't bother
[01:16:32.540 --> 01:16:35.580]   to get rid of her ability to feel people's energy.
[01:16:35.580 --> 01:16:38.620]   So she's a great fan of using the whole brain,
[01:16:38.620 --> 01:16:41.860]   "Whole Brain Living" is her latest book and it's great.
[01:16:41.860 --> 01:16:44.940]   But Ian McGilchrist talks about how
[01:16:44.940 --> 01:16:46.820]   when we don't use the whole brain,
[01:16:46.820 --> 01:16:48.540]   his book, "The Master and His Emissary"
[01:16:48.540 --> 01:16:51.260]   says the part of the brain that knows meaning
[01:16:51.260 --> 01:16:53.480]   should be the master and the data collector
[01:16:53.480 --> 01:16:55.420]   is just the emissary.
[01:16:55.420 --> 01:16:59.420]   But the data collector has taken over in Western society,
[01:16:59.420 --> 01:17:04.540]   Western educated, industrialized, rich, democratic,
[01:17:04.540 --> 01:17:05.900]   if you wanna get technical.
[01:17:07.740 --> 01:17:10.540]   And so what you were doing to yourself
[01:17:10.540 --> 01:17:15.060]   was completely irrational, completely.
[01:17:15.060 --> 01:17:16.500]   You should get the Darwin Award
[01:17:16.500 --> 01:17:19.820]   for taking yourself out of the gene pool.
[01:17:19.820 --> 01:17:21.100]   - It was like the stupidest thing.
[01:17:21.100 --> 01:17:22.860]   I remember thinking like, what am I doing?
[01:17:22.860 --> 01:17:25.440]   And of course, we used it to get virtual reality
[01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:26.280]   for our lab.
[01:17:26.280 --> 01:17:28.100]   We did a bunch of things that I thought were useful
[01:17:28.100 --> 01:17:30.500]   that we transmuted into studies on stress.
[01:17:30.500 --> 01:17:33.940]   And so there was always a purpose
[01:17:33.940 --> 01:17:35.860]   and a story that could justify being there.
[01:17:35.860 --> 01:17:37.020]   - Oh, there is, yeah.
[01:17:37.020 --> 01:17:39.900]   - And one that was really rooted in goodness and adventure.
[01:17:39.900 --> 01:17:42.260]   I love adventure and I'm super curious.
[01:17:42.260 --> 01:17:43.780]   - I think it's cool that you did that.
[01:17:43.780 --> 01:17:45.420]   I think it's really useful.
[01:17:45.420 --> 01:17:47.580]   I mean, there are many situations
[01:17:47.580 --> 01:17:51.060]   where your ability to do that could be really useful.
[01:17:51.060 --> 01:17:53.140]   Like a pair of scissors could be really useful.
[01:17:53.140 --> 01:17:56.220]   But when you're like trying to re-diaper the baby,
[01:17:56.220 --> 01:17:57.860]   you put the scissors down.
[01:17:57.860 --> 01:18:01.820]   It's a tool that you can use and it's fascinating.
[01:18:01.820 --> 01:18:03.140]   I did martial arts for eight years
[01:18:03.140 --> 01:18:05.060]   and I loved pushing myself
[01:18:05.060 --> 01:18:07.200]   to the point where I was bruised and bleeding.
[01:18:07.200 --> 01:18:10.800]   And my doctor thought I was a victim of domestic abuse.
[01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:13.020]   I think it's useful and even fun,
[01:18:13.020 --> 01:18:18.480]   but you have to know when your heart's in it
[01:18:18.480 --> 01:18:20.180]   and when your heart is not in it,
[01:18:20.180 --> 01:18:23.740]   when yourself is delighting in the adventure
[01:18:23.740 --> 01:18:28.740]   and when self says, "No, Andrew, peace, be still."
[01:18:28.740 --> 01:18:30.340]   - Enough. - Yeah.
[01:18:30.340 --> 01:18:33.460]   - Yeah, I mean, that's a perfect segue.
[01:18:33.460 --> 01:18:35.340]   But before I move on,
[01:18:35.340 --> 01:18:37.980]   I wanna make sure that I linked back what you said
[01:18:37.980 --> 01:18:40.500]   because I think it's exceptionally valuable
[01:18:40.500 --> 01:18:42.640]   about what's real, what's true.
[01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:46.420]   So to really evaluate what's true,
[01:18:46.420 --> 01:18:51.180]   you need to sit or maybe one can learn to do this
[01:18:51.180 --> 01:18:55.180]   while in motion and sense within one's body
[01:18:55.180 --> 01:18:58.300]   what feels liberating, opening
[01:18:58.300 --> 01:18:59.780]   versus what feels contracting.
[01:18:59.780 --> 01:19:00.620]   Is that right? - Yeah.
[01:19:00.620 --> 01:19:02.820]   The Buddha used to say, he said this often,
[01:19:02.820 --> 01:19:06.420]   that wherever you find the ocean, whatever it looks like,
[01:19:06.420 --> 01:19:09.180]   you can know it because the ocean always tastes of salt.
[01:19:09.180 --> 01:19:12.460]   And wherever you find awakening or enlightenment,
[01:19:12.460 --> 01:19:13.740]   no matter what it looks like,
[01:19:13.740 --> 01:19:17.380]   you will know it because it always tastes of freedom.
[01:19:17.380 --> 01:19:20.540]   So it's not that you stop suffering,
[01:19:20.540 --> 01:19:22.380]   it's that you are free.
[01:19:22.380 --> 01:19:24.780]   You are free to interact with your own suffering
[01:19:24.780 --> 01:19:27.420]   in a new way, and that is peace.
[01:19:27.420 --> 01:19:32.140]   So you look, and it literally physically affects the body
[01:19:32.140 --> 01:19:35.860]   as not free, free.
[01:19:35.860 --> 01:19:37.580]   And if anybody out there listening,
[01:19:37.580 --> 01:19:41.300]   go to a really rough time in your life and imagine it.
[01:19:41.300 --> 01:19:42.940]   I mean, go to that time in your life
[01:19:42.940 --> 01:19:44.940]   when you were pushing yourself,
[01:19:44.940 --> 01:19:47.860]   and you can actually remember the tightness in your throat,
[01:19:47.860 --> 01:19:52.340]   in your back, it's contracted,
[01:19:52.340 --> 01:19:55.900]   and then remember the best moment of your life
[01:19:55.900 --> 01:19:57.900]   and what was happening then,
[01:19:57.900 --> 01:20:01.400]   and all your muscles will loosen, relax, and open.
[01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:04.720]   And that is my gauge of truth.
[01:20:04.720 --> 01:20:06.600]   Does it set me free?
[01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:08.440]   The truth sets you free.
[01:20:08.440 --> 01:20:10.440]   So whatever sets you free is the truth.
[01:20:10.440 --> 01:20:16.320]   Then reality is gonna start changing for you,
[01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:18.800]   with or without psychedelics.
[01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:20.000]   And I remember sitting in,
[01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:23.160]   I had this overwhelming obsession with meditation
[01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:26.760]   when I turned 50, and I just bought this place in the woods
[01:20:26.760 --> 01:20:30.000]   in Central California, and I'd go out
[01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:31.520]   and sprinkle myself with birdseed
[01:20:31.520 --> 01:20:33.000]   and meditate in the forest all day
[01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.800]   while the chipmunks came and the birds would land on me.
[01:20:35.800 --> 01:20:36.640]   - Nice.
[01:20:36.640 --> 01:20:38.560]   - And it was amazing.
[01:20:38.560 --> 01:20:43.080]   And about six months into really meditating
[01:20:43.080 --> 01:20:47.400]   for hours every day, I kinda had an experience
[01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:49.680]   like Jill Pulte-Taylor in the shower,
[01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:52.280]   where I was in the forest with the chipmunks and birds,
[01:20:52.280 --> 01:20:54.800]   and then it was just light.
[01:20:54.800 --> 01:20:56.560]   And it was like, (gasps)
[01:20:56.560 --> 01:20:59.040]   it was so startling, it was like I'd fallen off a cliff,
[01:20:59.040 --> 01:21:01.160]   like I couldn't see the ground, I couldn't,
[01:21:01.160 --> 01:21:04.800]   and then everything was back.
[01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:06.720]   And then it started happening a lot.
[01:21:06.720 --> 01:21:09.120]   And I read in shamanic traditions,
[01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:12.440]   they call this experience stopping the world.
[01:21:12.440 --> 01:21:16.360]   And it can happen through the guidance of a shaman
[01:21:16.360 --> 01:21:18.400]   or a plant or whatever.
[01:21:18.400 --> 01:21:21.320]   It was happening to me through meditation.
[01:21:21.320 --> 01:21:24.000]   And in that space of light,
[01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:27.480]   which I stopped fearing after a while,
[01:21:28.240 --> 01:21:30.440]   (sighs)
[01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:34.960]   it looked as if this thing we're doing now is a video game.
[01:21:34.960 --> 01:21:36.720]   If you and I were sitting and playing a video game,
[01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:38.680]   you would choose a character, I would choose a character,
[01:21:38.680 --> 01:21:41.200]   you'd stab me with a sword, I'd hit you with a mace,
[01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:45.080]   and we would say, "You are hurting me, you are killing me."
[01:21:45.080 --> 01:21:46.680]   But really, we'd be talking about characters
[01:21:46.680 --> 01:21:49.280]   in a video game, and then somebody would come say,
[01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:51.840]   "Let's go get lunch," and we would put it down
[01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:54.560]   and go stop stabbing each other and be friends.
[01:21:56.280 --> 01:22:01.280]   It feels to me as if this is more like a game than reality,
[01:22:01.280 --> 01:22:04.800]   the whole physical everything.
[01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:09.800]   And I call this you, me, and you call that me,
[01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:12.180]   and I call it you.
[01:22:12.180 --> 01:22:16.300]   And when the game stops, however that happens,
[01:22:16.300 --> 01:22:22.400]   there's a level of reality as different from this one
[01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:25.620]   as a video game is from three-dimensional life.
[01:22:25.620 --> 01:22:27.560]   There's a world outside the cave,
[01:22:27.560 --> 01:22:29.980]   and I don't know what it is, and I may be wrong.
[01:22:29.980 --> 01:22:32.720]   I don't care. (laughs)
[01:22:32.720 --> 01:22:33.560]   - Love it.
[01:22:33.560 --> 01:22:36.080]   I'm gonna mention Rick Rubin again.
[01:22:36.080 --> 01:22:40.640]   A few years back, I called him up and I said,
[01:22:40.640 --> 01:22:42.040]   "Rick, you're not gonna believe this,"
[01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:44.440]   and I relayed to him a story about someone
[01:22:44.440 --> 01:22:47.600]   that I knew really well and this very,
[01:22:47.600 --> 01:22:50.360]   just kind of wild set of discoveries
[01:22:50.360 --> 01:22:52.840]   that someone else had unearthed about their life
[01:22:52.840 --> 01:22:56.120]   being completely different than it had been presented,
[01:22:56.120 --> 01:22:59.240]   and their business failed,
[01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:00.620]   like the whole thing just collapsed.
[01:23:00.620 --> 01:23:04.660]   And Rick just wrote back.
[01:23:04.660 --> 01:23:09.660]   He said, "Back to nature, the only truth."
[01:23:09.660 --> 01:23:12.380]   Like, that's very Rick.
[01:23:12.380 --> 01:23:13.220]   That's how he talks. - See, that makes
[01:23:13.220 --> 01:23:14.100]   my body relax.
[01:23:14.100 --> 01:23:17.680]   - Exactly, he said, well, actually,
[01:23:17.680 --> 01:23:19.580]   sorry, it was preceded by, he said,
[01:23:19.580 --> 01:23:21.300]   I said, "Did you read this?
[01:23:21.300 --> 01:23:22.120]   Do you see this?
[01:23:22.120 --> 01:23:22.960]   Do you believe this?"
[01:23:22.960 --> 01:23:24.140]   And I'm like, you know this person really well,
[01:23:24.140 --> 01:23:26.100]   and like, I can't, like for a very long time.
[01:23:26.100 --> 01:23:28.740]   And he just said, "It's all lies.
[01:23:28.740 --> 01:23:32.800]   Back to nature, the only truth."
[01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:36.220]   And I just like, and that just like tattooed in my brain,
[01:23:36.220 --> 01:23:38.060]   because so much of what we see and like,
[01:23:38.060 --> 01:23:39.680]   and the shock and like, I can't believe it.
[01:23:39.680 --> 01:23:42.900]   And I think he was referring to something similar.
[01:23:42.900 --> 01:23:45.560]   He also has said, and you're gonna get a kick out of this,
[01:23:45.560 --> 01:23:48.340]   I think, so Rick loves professional wrestling.
[01:23:48.340 --> 01:23:51.900]   He watches 10 hours a week of professional wrestling,
[01:23:51.900 --> 01:23:52.760]   why?
[01:23:52.760 --> 01:23:55.340]   Well, first of all, he believes that it's the only thing
[01:23:55.340 --> 01:23:57.820]   that humans have created that's real.
[01:23:57.820 --> 01:23:58.660]   Why?
[01:23:58.660 --> 01:24:00.540]   Because everyone agrees that it's not real.
[01:24:00.540 --> 01:24:01.740]   - It's fake. - It's fake.
[01:24:01.740 --> 01:24:05.660]   And that he likes that no one gets hurt.
[01:24:05.660 --> 01:24:07.020]   I mean, people actually can get hurt,
[01:24:07.020 --> 01:24:09.200]   but that no one's trying to actually hurt the other person.
[01:24:09.200 --> 01:24:12.820]   They're collaborating in this kind of Shakespearean dance
[01:24:12.820 --> 01:24:13.860]   that they do. - I love that.
[01:24:13.860 --> 01:24:15.120]   - And you have the different characters.
[01:24:15.120 --> 01:24:17.300]   And so I went to see professional wrestling with Rick,
[01:24:17.300 --> 01:24:18.860]   thinking like, what am I doing here?
[01:24:18.860 --> 01:24:21.180]   Like, it was like loud and the flames and all this,
[01:24:21.180 --> 01:24:23.620]   like not a scene I would normally take myself to
[01:24:23.620 --> 01:24:24.460]   on a Friday.
[01:24:24.460 --> 01:24:25.980]   And it was so much fun.
[01:24:25.980 --> 01:24:28.500]   And mostly because of how delighted Rick was
[01:24:28.500 --> 01:24:29.340]   in seeing it. - Oh, I love that.
[01:24:29.340 --> 01:24:30.920]   - And his son as well.
[01:24:30.920 --> 01:24:35.620]   So we can distinguish or like really identify what's true
[01:24:35.620 --> 01:24:36.460]   through this practice.
[01:24:36.460 --> 01:24:37.280]   - As close as we can. - For us.
[01:24:37.280 --> 01:24:39.620]   - We can't ever know completely what's true.
[01:24:39.620 --> 01:24:43.460]   The whole, the Baconian method is accept nothing
[01:24:43.460 --> 01:24:44.980]   until it's proven true.
[01:24:44.980 --> 01:24:46.420]   Well, we can't prove anything true.
[01:24:46.420 --> 01:24:48.100]   We could all be dreaming this.
[01:24:48.100 --> 01:24:51.060]   So I decided that I would accept everything
[01:24:51.060 --> 01:24:53.140]   until I'm convinced that it's false.
[01:24:53.140 --> 01:24:55.260]   So I don't really believe anything,
[01:24:55.260 --> 01:24:57.300]   but I'm willing to-- - Like a scientist.
[01:24:57.300 --> 01:24:59.740]   - Yeah, I don't believe anything because I can't,
[01:24:59.740 --> 01:25:01.780]   nothing can be absolutely proven.
[01:25:01.780 --> 01:25:03.980]   But I do know what's most useful to me,
[01:25:03.980 --> 01:25:05.580]   what makes me healthy.
[01:25:05.580 --> 01:25:10.580]   I've had a really, really sick, weak body most of my life.
[01:25:10.580 --> 01:25:15.020]   And it became a big part of my navigational system.
[01:25:15.020 --> 01:25:18.780]   I now think I have the MCAS,
[01:25:19.860 --> 01:25:21.540]   mass cell activation syndrome.
[01:25:21.540 --> 01:25:23.460]   You put out a podcast on that.
[01:25:23.460 --> 01:25:25.340]   My daughter's been diagnosed with it.
[01:25:25.340 --> 01:25:26.260]   I probably have it.
[01:25:26.260 --> 01:25:28.180]   And it's just this weird random thing
[01:25:28.180 --> 01:25:31.180]   where you get symptoms in different parts of your body.
[01:25:31.180 --> 01:25:32.580]   - It's overactive immune system.
[01:25:32.580 --> 01:25:33.580]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:25:33.580 --> 01:25:35.260]   It'll protect you from cancer.
[01:25:35.260 --> 01:25:36.420]   - Does it really?
[01:25:36.420 --> 01:25:38.740]   - Well, it turns out that people that run
[01:25:38.740 --> 01:25:41.700]   kind of more towards autoimmune conditions,
[01:25:41.700 --> 01:25:43.580]   like people who have skin conditions
[01:25:43.580 --> 01:25:47.060]   that are autoimmune based have fewer skin cancers.
[01:25:47.060 --> 01:25:50.320]   Because the immune system is combating all these invaders.
[01:25:50.320 --> 01:25:51.580]   - It combats everything.
[01:25:51.580 --> 01:25:54.060]   - So there's a, yeah, if there's an upside,
[01:25:54.060 --> 01:25:56.860]   and this is the basis of a lot of the logic
[01:25:56.860 --> 01:25:58.820]   related to immunotherapies for cancers,
[01:25:58.820 --> 01:26:00.660]   is trying to have the immune system fight off
[01:26:00.660 --> 01:26:03.300]   these mutations that are always occurring in the background.
[01:26:03.300 --> 01:26:05.060]   - Wow, super cool. - So I'm not trying
[01:26:05.060 --> 01:26:06.940]   to take away from the suffering it's created,
[01:26:06.940 --> 01:26:07.780]   but that's an upside.
[01:26:07.780 --> 01:26:10.420]   - Yeah, and my mother had it and I just wish she had lived
[01:26:10.420 --> 01:26:13.660]   to see the diagnosis even exist.
[01:26:13.660 --> 01:26:15.700]   But my daughter called me from England the other day
[01:26:15.700 --> 01:26:17.020]   and we were talking about the fact
[01:26:17.020 --> 01:26:18.620]   that she has that diagnosis.
[01:26:18.620 --> 01:26:23.620]   And she said, "I am allergic to my own goddamn emotions."
[01:26:23.620 --> 01:26:27.820]   And I was like, "Yeah, we both are."
[01:26:27.820 --> 01:26:32.820]   And my whole journey has been really, really accelerated
[01:26:32.820 --> 01:26:35.500]   by the fact that if I go off true for myself,
[01:26:35.500 --> 01:26:39.100]   emotionally, psychologically, metaphysically, whatever,
[01:26:39.100 --> 01:26:42.740]   I immediately get physical symptoms of some kind.
[01:26:42.740 --> 01:26:46.680]   But when I am true to myself, they all subside
[01:26:46.680 --> 01:26:49.180]   and I get this unbelievable health.
[01:26:49.180 --> 01:26:51.540]   So I've been told that I had five different
[01:26:51.540 --> 01:26:53.780]   progressive incurable diseases.
[01:26:53.780 --> 01:26:56.380]   I don't have any symptoms.
[01:26:56.380 --> 01:27:00.340]   But if I allow myself to be untrue to myself,
[01:27:00.340 --> 01:27:02.600]   if I allow myself to get out of integrity,
[01:27:02.600 --> 01:27:07.100]   I suffer intensely and immediately in a very real way.
[01:27:07.100 --> 01:27:10.820]   So I don't know what's true, but I know what keeps me healthy
[01:27:10.820 --> 01:27:13.500]   and I know what feels like freedom.
[01:27:13.500 --> 01:27:18.500]   And if I hit a thought like there is nothing to us
[01:27:18.500 --> 01:27:22.340]   but physical matter and it feels like tension,
[01:27:22.340 --> 01:27:24.060]   like when I put down my dog
[01:27:24.060 --> 01:27:29.060]   and I felt something go through me as she died,
[01:27:29.060 --> 01:27:36.500]   it was like, I don't know whether that I was feeling
[01:27:36.500 --> 01:27:39.180]   something that was real,
[01:27:39.180 --> 01:27:42.760]   but that's as close to the truth as I can get.
[01:27:42.760 --> 01:27:48.980]   And if I, see right now, what's happening to me,
[01:27:48.980 --> 01:27:50.620]   I'm getting into this self thing.
[01:27:50.620 --> 01:27:54.440]   And as I'm talking about this dog, I feel that dog.
[01:27:54.440 --> 01:27:57.580]   And I can feel, I'm gonna sound crazy.
[01:27:57.580 --> 01:28:00.460]   No, not if you're talking about dogs and feeling.
[01:28:00.460 --> 01:28:01.300]   I know, right?
[01:28:01.300 --> 01:28:04.060]   You might make me cry 'cause I'm thinking about,
[01:28:04.060 --> 01:28:06.260]   no, 'cause I think I can sense it.
[01:28:06.260 --> 01:28:07.160]   I think I can sense it.
[01:28:07.160 --> 01:28:11.500]   And forgive me if I'm like now sounding like totally crazy.
[01:28:11.500 --> 01:28:14.380]   If anyone's listening like this, I will say,
[01:28:14.380 --> 01:28:16.660]   and I have a, I'm just gonna be blunt.
[01:28:16.660 --> 01:28:18.420]   I got a lot of training in neuroscience.
[01:28:18.420 --> 01:28:20.420]   I got decades of training in it.
[01:28:20.420 --> 01:28:24.600]   And I'll tell you the notion of energy
[01:28:24.600 --> 01:28:27.220]   is not mysterious at all.
[01:28:27.220 --> 01:28:30.180]   I mean, neurons are electricity and chemical exchange
[01:28:30.180 --> 01:28:32.620]   and that happens locally and it happens at a distance.
[01:28:32.620 --> 01:28:34.960]   - Yeah, our phones are electronic circuits
[01:28:34.960 --> 01:28:36.540]   that communicate at a distance.
[01:28:36.540 --> 01:28:38.380]   We are electronic circuits.
[01:28:38.380 --> 01:28:40.940]   Why shouldn't we communicate at a distance?
[01:28:40.940 --> 01:28:41.780]   - That's right.
[01:28:41.780 --> 01:28:43.700]   And the really forward thinking neuroscientists
[01:28:43.700 --> 01:28:46.620]   are starting to put multiple people into scanners
[01:28:46.620 --> 01:28:49.180]   and putting people in scanners in different locations.
[01:28:49.180 --> 01:28:51.000]   And I know it sounds like people are going, oh no,
[01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:52.020]   like, what are you talking about?
[01:28:52.020 --> 01:28:53.420]   This is like spoon bending stuff.
[01:28:53.420 --> 01:28:57.740]   No, the idea that thought and emotion at one location
[01:28:57.740 --> 01:28:59.380]   can impact thought and location in another one
[01:28:59.380 --> 01:29:02.100]   is that magnetoreception has been published
[01:29:02.100 --> 01:29:03.720]   in the journal science.
[01:29:03.720 --> 01:29:06.660]   So we're not outside the bounds of reality.
[01:29:06.660 --> 01:29:10.080]   We are like actually finally as a field
[01:29:10.080 --> 01:29:13.020]   starting to acknowledge that this stuff exists
[01:29:13.020 --> 01:29:15.060]   and starting to poke and prod around in there.
[01:29:15.060 --> 01:29:16.220]   But people have known about this.
[01:29:16.220 --> 01:29:19.900]   So for you, the sensing of your dog passing
[01:29:19.900 --> 01:29:22.140]   or you can feel them present.
[01:29:22.140 --> 01:29:25.220]   - My dog was a physical entity,
[01:29:25.220 --> 01:29:27.700]   but my dog was also an energetic entity.
[01:29:27.700 --> 01:29:31.380]   And that entity was something I could feel.
[01:29:31.380 --> 01:29:34.920]   And this is, I don't know how many, a couple of years later,
[01:29:34.920 --> 01:29:37.360]   I start talking about that dog, I feel it again.
[01:29:37.360 --> 01:29:39.560]   And it is a, I have, okay.
[01:29:39.560 --> 01:29:41.480]   So when I was pregnant with my son, Adam,
[01:29:41.480 --> 01:29:44.440]   but one of the big reasons I chose to keep the baby
[01:29:44.440 --> 01:29:48.000]   is that from the moment he was conceived,
[01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.880]   I started having experiences
[01:29:50.880 --> 01:29:55.880]   that completely blew apart my understanding of reality.
[01:29:55.880 --> 01:30:00.160]   My husband at the time was traveling in Asia a lot.
[01:30:00.160 --> 01:30:02.540]   And when I would think about him,
[01:30:02.540 --> 01:30:04.000]   what happened a lot at night for me,
[01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:07.020]   I'd be like lying in bed and I would think about him
[01:30:07.020 --> 01:30:08.620]   and it would be daytime in Asia.
[01:30:08.620 --> 01:30:12.240]   And I would suddenly be like in a three-dimensional movie
[01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:15.140]   where I'd be walking down a street in Japan
[01:30:15.140 --> 01:30:18.780]   or flying over a thunderstorm in an airplane.
[01:30:18.780 --> 01:30:22.580]   And I'd see these very specific things, very specific.
[01:30:22.580 --> 01:30:25.260]   And then he would call me like the next day and say,
[01:30:25.260 --> 01:30:27.260]   "Oh, I was walking down the street in Japan
[01:30:27.260 --> 01:30:29.140]   and I saw this very specific banner.
[01:30:29.140 --> 01:30:31.840]   And I flew over a thunderstorm
[01:30:31.840 --> 01:30:33.380]   and the lightning was amazing."
[01:30:33.380 --> 01:30:38.380]   And I started to realize I was picking up information
[01:30:38.380 --> 01:30:41.740]   that he was seeing and it was testable.
[01:30:41.740 --> 01:30:43.820]   It kept happening.
[01:30:43.820 --> 01:30:45.860]   So what is that?
[01:30:45.860 --> 01:30:48.540]   It would have been so non-scientific of me
[01:30:48.540 --> 01:30:50.300]   to say that is completely insignificant
[01:30:50.300 --> 01:30:52.460]   and don't pay any attention.
[01:30:52.460 --> 01:30:54.300]   It just was too weird.
[01:30:54.300 --> 01:30:57.980]   And so that's when I decided I'll believe anything
[01:30:57.980 --> 01:30:59.940]   until I'm convinced it's false.
[01:30:59.940 --> 01:31:02.700]   And that throws your whole mind open
[01:31:02.700 --> 01:31:04.140]   to understanding the universe
[01:31:04.140 --> 01:31:06.900]   as being far more mysterious
[01:31:06.900 --> 01:31:10.260]   than our culture likes to say it is.
[01:31:10.260 --> 01:31:13.260]   And yes, there's a danger of getting woo-woo and crazy,
[01:31:13.260 --> 01:31:15.700]   but as I said, the math has to work too.
[01:31:15.700 --> 01:31:20.700]   And you're just telling us how the neurophysics of energy
[01:31:20.700 --> 01:31:25.620]   are being tested and shown to be operative.
[01:31:25.620 --> 01:31:29.380]   It's not woo-woo, it's just at the outside edge
[01:31:29.380 --> 01:31:31.300]   of what our culture is willing to accept.
[01:31:31.300 --> 01:31:33.400]   - Yeah, and the instruments we have to measure things
[01:31:33.400 --> 01:31:34.700]   are just not there yet.
[01:31:34.700 --> 01:31:40.020]   But the same was said about most everything
[01:31:40.020 --> 01:31:43.580]   that has been clearly discovered and is rock solid
[01:31:43.580 --> 01:31:47.080]   over the last 50 plus years, at least in neuroscience.
[01:31:47.080 --> 01:31:51.220]   I can't help but just briefly share
[01:31:51.220 --> 01:31:54.660]   when I put Costello down, 'cause I did that myself,
[01:31:54.660 --> 01:31:55.980]   which sucked. - Oh!
[01:31:55.980 --> 01:31:57.900]   - Yeah, but I didn't wanna, I mean,
[01:31:57.900 --> 01:31:59.380]   the vets, they came to the house,
[01:31:59.380 --> 01:32:01.260]   but it was at home and I was right there.
[01:32:01.260 --> 01:32:03.500]   I didn't do the injection. - Okay, good.
[01:32:03.500 --> 01:32:06.500]   - No, no, no, originally, I thought I would,
[01:32:06.500 --> 01:32:09.600]   because unfortunately, because of my previous job,
[01:32:09.600 --> 01:32:10.940]   I had to do that a number of times.
[01:32:10.940 --> 01:32:12.620]   - That's, ooh. - Yeah.
[01:32:12.620 --> 01:32:14.820]   - That is not an accident. - No, so,
[01:32:14.820 --> 01:32:16.300]   but what was interesting is, you know,
[01:32:16.300 --> 01:32:19.680]   like he let out a big, like, sigh right there at the end,
[01:32:19.680 --> 01:32:22.560]   but the wildest part of it was,
[01:32:22.560 --> 01:32:25.300]   and I swear, it sounds like I'm making this up,
[01:32:25.300 --> 01:32:29.380]   but at the moment he went, I felt my heart heat up.
[01:32:29.380 --> 01:32:32.300]   I thought I was gonna be crushed, like a broken heart.
[01:32:32.300 --> 01:32:35.460]   And I swear, it felt as if he was giving me
[01:32:35.460 --> 01:32:37.500]   all this energy back. - Ah!
[01:32:37.500 --> 01:32:39.760]   - And it's because I had been spending so much time,
[01:32:39.760 --> 01:32:41.860]   he was up in the middle of the night a lot.
[01:32:41.860 --> 01:32:44.020]   He must've had some dementia or that kind of thing.
[01:32:44.020 --> 01:32:45.860]   And I mean, I had that dog on everything.
[01:32:45.860 --> 01:32:48.700]   I was injecting him with testosterone for the last part.
[01:32:48.700 --> 01:32:50.300]   Made him a lot healthier, folks.
[01:32:51.500 --> 01:32:54.620]   Don't let your dog breed, you know, indiscriminately,
[01:32:54.620 --> 01:32:57.380]   but like, I've got my theories about, you know,
[01:32:57.380 --> 01:32:58.860]   all this stuff at hormones and animals
[01:32:58.860 --> 01:33:01.920]   that a lot of the vets are aligned with me on this one.
[01:33:01.920 --> 01:33:04.120]   Talk to your vet, talk to a progressive vet.
[01:33:04.120 --> 01:33:07.900]   You know, I had him on a bunch of different drugs.
[01:33:07.900 --> 01:33:10.020]   I had him, you know, he was really unhappy.
[01:33:10.020 --> 01:33:11.980]   So letting it, it was the right thing to do.
[01:33:11.980 --> 01:33:13.620]   And I'll stop talking about it
[01:33:13.620 --> 01:33:15.380]   'cause I'll get too worked up.
[01:33:15.380 --> 01:33:20.380]   But, forgive me, but that feeling, it was like, whoa.
[01:33:21.300 --> 01:33:22.900]   And I can still feel it.
[01:33:22.900 --> 01:33:25.180]   It's like he gave something back that now,
[01:33:25.180 --> 01:33:26.260]   I think enough time has passed.
[01:33:26.260 --> 01:33:27.900]   I go get another dog.
[01:33:27.900 --> 01:33:30.660]   It was almost like, okay, here's all this resource
[01:33:30.660 --> 01:33:32.380]   and like gratitude.
[01:33:32.380 --> 01:33:34.860]   And so these things sound kind of woo, right?
[01:33:34.860 --> 01:33:36.700]   Could you do an experiment where you put me in the lab
[01:33:36.700 --> 01:33:37.680]   while I go through that?
[01:33:37.680 --> 01:33:38.520]   Sure.
[01:33:38.520 --> 01:33:39.820]   Would you see huge physiological changes?
[01:33:39.820 --> 01:33:40.660]   Sure.
[01:33:40.660 --> 01:33:43.860]   I don't see the point of that kind of experiment
[01:33:43.860 --> 01:33:45.680]   because I think enough people have experienced
[01:33:45.680 --> 01:33:48.720]   these kinds of things that it's not necessary.
[01:33:49.620 --> 01:33:53.360]   In any case, I wanna talk about integrity
[01:33:53.360 --> 01:33:56.100]   and your book, "Way of Integrity."
[01:33:56.100 --> 01:33:59.500]   You ran a very interesting experiment
[01:33:59.500 --> 01:34:04.500]   that frankly, it's gonna sound a little scary to some people
[01:34:04.500 --> 01:34:05.620]   and maybe-
[01:34:05.620 --> 01:34:06.460]   They don't have to do it.
[01:34:06.460 --> 01:34:08.400]   And maybe reflexive to other people,
[01:34:08.400 --> 01:34:14.540]   which is, I think it was one year of no lying.
[01:34:14.540 --> 01:34:15.380]   Yes.
[01:34:15.380 --> 01:34:18.620]   But like no lying of any kind, not even to yourself.
[01:34:18.620 --> 01:34:19.460]   No.
[01:34:19.460 --> 01:34:20.280]   And-
[01:34:20.280 --> 01:34:21.340]   Especially not to myself.
[01:34:21.340 --> 01:34:22.500]   Right.
[01:34:22.500 --> 01:34:24.140]   And previously on the podcast,
[01:34:24.140 --> 01:34:26.260]   we had my colleague, Dr. Ana Lemke,
[01:34:26.260 --> 01:34:28.620]   who runs our Dual Diagnosis Addiction Clinic.
[01:34:28.620 --> 01:34:31.540]   She's done a tremendous service to the world
[01:34:31.540 --> 01:34:35.060]   talking about all the various kinds of addiction.
[01:34:35.060 --> 01:34:36.780]   Addiction as a disease, yes,
[01:34:36.780 --> 01:34:38.380]   but also something that people can overcome.
[01:34:38.380 --> 01:34:40.420]   And one of the things that I love so much
[01:34:40.420 --> 01:34:43.400]   about Ana's message, she wrote the book, "Dopamine Nation,"
[01:34:43.400 --> 01:34:44.240]   but-
[01:34:44.240 --> 01:34:45.060]   Oh, I love that book.
[01:34:45.060 --> 01:34:45.940]   Yeah, wonderful book.
[01:34:45.940 --> 01:34:49.360]   Is she talks about how recovered addicts
[01:34:49.360 --> 01:34:50.960]   are actually her heroes,
[01:34:50.960 --> 01:34:53.660]   because they've learned to navigate this internal process
[01:34:53.660 --> 01:34:56.420]   that most people perhaps who aren't addicts
[01:34:56.420 --> 01:34:57.940]   or don't think they are,
[01:34:57.940 --> 01:35:00.500]   are constantly being yanked around by these dopamine systems
[01:35:00.500 --> 01:35:02.980]   but they've learned to conquer their own dopamine system.
[01:35:02.980 --> 01:35:03.820]   Right.
[01:35:03.820 --> 01:35:06.500]   So they represent the heroes of her world.
[01:35:06.500 --> 01:35:07.900]   And I love that model
[01:35:07.900 --> 01:35:10.740]   because we tend to look at addicts and think about as like,
[01:35:10.740 --> 01:35:13.460]   there's all this judgment on it, but-
[01:35:13.460 --> 01:35:15.440]   No, I think it's amazing.
[01:35:15.440 --> 01:35:16.940]   I think the addicts are people
[01:35:16.940 --> 01:35:19.340]   who are hypersensitive to the suffering
[01:35:19.340 --> 01:35:20.780]   that they are told to accept.
[01:35:20.780 --> 01:35:23.100]   And so they're trying to medicate the suffering
[01:35:23.100 --> 01:35:25.340]   that comes from being out of integrity.
[01:35:25.340 --> 01:35:27.740]   And the society says,
[01:35:27.740 --> 01:35:30.940]   like I talked to people,
[01:35:30.940 --> 01:35:34.620]   I interviewed people for this book who would go to their,
[01:35:34.620 --> 01:35:37.220]   this one woman went with her husband to the psychiatrist
[01:35:37.220 --> 01:35:39.980]   and they said,
[01:35:39.980 --> 01:35:42.780]   she's not happy doing the traditional wife role.
[01:35:42.780 --> 01:35:45.680]   And they sat there and talked about what medication
[01:35:45.680 --> 01:35:50.180]   would enable her to fulfill this social role
[01:35:50.180 --> 01:35:52.280]   that she just didn't like.
[01:35:52.280 --> 01:35:54.240]   It never occurred to anybody to say,
[01:35:54.240 --> 01:35:58.480]   maybe don't do it if you don't like it that much.
[01:35:58.480 --> 01:36:00.680]   And people are medicating themselves
[01:36:00.680 --> 01:36:03.720]   into a conformity with social systems
[01:36:03.720 --> 01:36:05.680]   that are not in line with their true nature.
[01:36:05.680 --> 01:36:08.120]   And addicts hurt.
[01:36:08.120 --> 01:36:10.400]   And they sometimes, they find a substance
[01:36:10.400 --> 01:36:13.560]   or they find an activity that gives them relief.
[01:36:13.560 --> 01:36:16.720]   And so they use it because they're in a lot of pain.
[01:36:16.720 --> 01:36:20.320]   - Until it becomes the source of pain.
[01:36:20.320 --> 01:36:23.220]   - Yeah, and it always does and it's horrible.
[01:36:23.220 --> 01:36:25.400]   But one addiction specialist I know says,
[01:36:25.400 --> 01:36:27.420]   it's like they're standing on a nail
[01:36:27.420 --> 01:36:29.820]   and trying to take enough drugs to stop the pain.
[01:36:29.820 --> 01:36:31.500]   And that is not what you need to do
[01:36:31.500 --> 01:36:32.580]   when you're standing on a nail,
[01:36:32.580 --> 01:36:34.660]   you need to take the nail out.
[01:36:34.660 --> 01:36:37.800]   And the nail is the part of your life
[01:36:37.800 --> 01:36:39.620]   that you're living that's out of integrity
[01:36:39.620 --> 01:36:40.460]   with your true nature
[01:36:40.460 --> 01:36:43.140]   because other people want you to live that way.
[01:36:43.140 --> 01:36:44.620]   And they will force themselves.
[01:36:44.620 --> 01:36:47.420]   They want to stay in the position of pain or fear,
[01:36:47.420 --> 01:36:49.640]   push past it, be stronger.
[01:36:49.640 --> 01:36:52.580]   - Yeah, I've spent a lot of my life there, I'll confess.
[01:36:52.580 --> 01:36:53.980]   And it's super unpleasant
[01:36:53.980 --> 01:36:57.340]   and it's always led to like shitty things.
[01:36:57.340 --> 01:37:00.660]   - But how laudable is it that you took
[01:37:00.660 --> 01:37:02.140]   what the culture told you was good
[01:37:02.140 --> 01:37:04.340]   and by God, you learned to do it.
[01:37:04.340 --> 01:37:06.380]   - And we tell ourselves stories like,
[01:37:06.380 --> 01:37:08.560]   well, if we achieve certain things,
[01:37:08.560 --> 01:37:09.900]   then we'll be in a better position
[01:37:09.900 --> 01:37:10.960]   to do more for other people.
[01:37:10.960 --> 01:37:14.300]   Like there's the martyrdom version of it too.
[01:37:14.300 --> 01:37:15.500]   The reason I brought up Anna
[01:37:15.500 --> 01:37:17.600]   was she was the first to alert me to these studies
[01:37:17.600 --> 01:37:19.700]   that have been done about how myelination
[01:37:19.700 --> 01:37:21.520]   and growth of the prefrontal cortex
[01:37:21.520 --> 01:37:24.500]   is actually accelerated when people tell the truth,
[01:37:24.500 --> 01:37:27.700]   especially around truths that are somewhat uncomfortable.
[01:37:27.700 --> 01:37:31.460]   And it's a beautiful literature that's small,
[01:37:31.460 --> 01:37:33.220]   but starting to really emerge.
[01:37:33.220 --> 01:37:37.700]   Yeah, and a big part of the recovery from addiction
[01:37:37.700 --> 01:37:42.340]   is people first like acknowledging the truth to themselves
[01:37:42.340 --> 01:37:43.860]   and then to other people.
[01:37:43.860 --> 01:37:48.860]   And again, all of that's kind of shrouded
[01:37:48.860 --> 01:37:51.800]   by how we think about addicts.
[01:37:51.800 --> 01:37:54.980]   Like sadly in any major city and even small towns now,
[01:37:54.980 --> 01:37:57.660]   you can see that the bent over, like fentanyl addicts.
[01:37:57.660 --> 01:37:59.300]   And like we judge, we're like,
[01:37:59.300 --> 01:38:01.740]   oh, you know, or we say it's so sad
[01:38:01.740 --> 01:38:06.700]   or, but that's just an example
[01:38:06.700 --> 01:38:10.020]   of how far gone people can get in that particular addiction.
[01:38:10.020 --> 01:38:11.740]   Anna offers an interesting idea,
[01:38:11.740 --> 01:38:15.100]   which is that the more we tell these little micro truths,
[01:38:15.100 --> 01:38:17.700]   the more connected to reality we are.
[01:38:17.700 --> 01:38:18.540]   Yes.
[01:38:18.540 --> 01:38:20.260]   And in the way of integrity,
[01:38:20.260 --> 01:38:22.740]   you talk about this experiment that you did.
[01:38:22.740 --> 01:38:25.060]   My first integrity cleanse.
[01:38:25.060 --> 01:38:27.220]   So an integrity cleanse.
[01:38:27.220 --> 01:38:28.940]   So maybe you could explain what it is.
[01:38:28.940 --> 01:38:33.100]   And it sounds incredibly scary.
[01:38:33.100 --> 01:38:34.500]   It's not just the telling the truth part,
[01:38:34.500 --> 01:38:36.340]   it's the realizing the truth part.
[01:38:36.340 --> 01:38:38.660]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:38:38.660 --> 01:38:41.580]   I guess I'm gonna start with the Wu story.
[01:38:41.580 --> 01:38:43.140]   I was very sick.
[01:38:43.140 --> 01:38:45.220]   And at one point they rushed me into surgery,
[01:38:45.220 --> 01:38:46.220]   didn't know what was wrong with me.
[01:38:46.220 --> 01:38:48.460]   I had some internal bleeding going on.
[01:38:48.460 --> 01:38:51.140]   That's a long story, wrote about it in another book.
[01:38:51.140 --> 01:38:54.340]   Point is during the surgery, I regained consciousness
[01:38:54.340 --> 01:38:58.420]   and sat up and looked at them operating on me,
[01:38:58.420 --> 01:39:01.340]   which was surprising because I was lying down there.
[01:39:01.340 --> 01:39:05.020]   And so I was like very disconcerted and I lay back down
[01:39:05.020 --> 01:39:07.540]   and I looked up between the surgical lights
[01:39:07.540 --> 01:39:10.980]   and between them appeared this ball of light
[01:39:10.980 --> 01:39:13.460]   that was much, much, much brighter
[01:39:13.460 --> 01:39:16.420]   than the surgical lights, which are very bright.
[01:39:16.420 --> 01:39:19.260]   And it was so beautiful.
[01:39:19.260 --> 01:39:22.140]   You just, you can't describe it.
[01:39:22.140 --> 01:39:23.300]   It's outside the cave.
[01:39:23.300 --> 01:39:25.460]   And I was just completely obsessed by it.
[01:39:25.460 --> 01:39:26.620]   And then it started to grow.
[01:39:26.620 --> 01:39:29.460]   And when it touched me and it filled things,
[01:39:29.460 --> 01:39:32.060]   it didn't bounce off things, it filled them.
[01:39:32.100 --> 01:39:34.700]   When it touched me, this incredible joy
[01:39:34.700 --> 01:39:38.740]   and love and warmth flooded my body.
[01:39:38.740 --> 01:39:41.220]   And I started to cry and my body was crying
[01:39:41.220 --> 01:39:45.460]   and the surgeons noticed these tears coming out of my eyes.
[01:39:45.460 --> 01:39:47.100]   And they freaked out because they thought
[01:39:47.100 --> 01:39:49.100]   that I was feeling the surgery
[01:39:49.100 --> 01:39:51.900]   and crying was the only thing I could do about it.
[01:39:51.900 --> 01:39:54.500]   So they were panicking and the anesthesiologist,
[01:39:54.500 --> 01:39:57.340]   they told him, bump up the medication.
[01:39:57.340 --> 01:40:01.500]   Later, because I grilled him later,
[01:40:01.500 --> 01:40:02.460]   what did you give me?
[01:40:02.460 --> 01:40:03.660]   What are the side effects?
[01:40:03.660 --> 01:40:04.940]   What happens?
[01:40:04.940 --> 01:40:06.100]   Can I have some more?
[01:40:06.100 --> 01:40:12.580]   He said afterward that when he went
[01:40:12.580 --> 01:40:16.060]   to increase the medication, he said a voice said to him,
[01:40:16.060 --> 01:40:18.700]   "Don't, she's crying because she's happy."
[01:40:18.700 --> 01:40:20.940]   And he said, "I just did what it said."
[01:40:20.940 --> 01:40:23.540]   And he was white and shaking.
[01:40:23.540 --> 01:40:26.060]   And he said, "Did I do the right thing?"
[01:40:26.060 --> 01:40:27.780]   So I kind of told him a little of the story.
[01:40:27.780 --> 01:40:29.460]   Anyway, this light was there.
[01:40:29.460 --> 01:40:30.300]   - Wild.
[01:40:30.300 --> 01:40:35.180]   - Yeah, and I was just like, home, home, home.
[01:40:35.180 --> 01:40:38.300]   And it said, yeah, okay, so this is what you really are.
[01:40:38.300 --> 01:40:43.100]   And you're about to have a pretty tough time for a while.
[01:40:43.100 --> 01:40:45.700]   But just remember, I'm always here,
[01:40:45.700 --> 01:40:47.420]   even though you can't see me.
[01:40:47.420 --> 01:40:50.180]   And so I came out of that surgery
[01:40:50.180 --> 01:40:53.700]   and I thought I will not allow anything to my life
[01:40:53.700 --> 01:40:56.780]   that doesn't feel like that light.
[01:40:56.780 --> 01:40:59.500]   Oh, that's what it, it wasn't like it used language,
[01:40:59.500 --> 01:41:04.180]   but it said, this is not the way you feel after you die.
[01:41:04.180 --> 01:41:05.180]   This is the way you're supposed
[01:41:05.180 --> 01:41:07.340]   to learn to feel all the time.
[01:41:07.340 --> 01:41:10.020]   So in your body, out of your body, it doesn't matter.
[01:41:10.020 --> 01:41:12.220]   This is how you're meant to feel.
[01:41:12.220 --> 01:41:14.460]   And believe me, when I worked with heroin addicts,
[01:41:14.460 --> 01:41:16.540]   they would describe their first high,
[01:41:16.540 --> 01:41:18.180]   and it was as close to that
[01:41:18.180 --> 01:41:20.380]   as anything I'd heard people describe.
[01:41:20.380 --> 01:41:23.100]   And I would say, I believe you're meant to feel that way,
[01:41:23.100 --> 01:41:25.540]   and also keep your teeth, you know?
[01:41:25.540 --> 01:41:28.940]   But, so I didn't tell a lie for a year.
[01:41:28.940 --> 01:41:30.180]   I came out of it and I thought,
[01:41:30.180 --> 01:41:33.220]   well, lying is definitely not gonna feel like that.
[01:41:33.220 --> 01:41:35.500]   That light does not lie.
[01:41:35.500 --> 01:41:37.420]   So no lies ever.
[01:41:37.420 --> 01:41:38.980]   - Of any kind, even a little micro,
[01:41:38.980 --> 01:41:40.500]   like when are you gonna be home
[01:41:40.500 --> 01:41:44.820]   and you know it's 12 minutes and you say 10.
[01:41:44.820 --> 01:41:47.220]   - Can't say that, say 12.
[01:41:47.220 --> 01:41:49.420]   Do you like my outfit?
[01:41:49.420 --> 01:41:50.460]   No, I do not.
[01:41:50.460 --> 01:41:54.020]   I mean, I found ways to,
[01:41:54.020 --> 01:41:56.900]   I would sort of try to soften the truth.
[01:41:56.900 --> 01:41:58.780]   - Did it mean also telling every truth
[01:41:58.780 --> 01:41:59.860]   that was in your head?
[01:41:59.860 --> 01:42:00.700]   - No. - Or you would keep
[01:42:00.700 --> 01:42:01.580]   certain things to yourself?
[01:42:01.580 --> 01:42:03.140]   - No, in fact, it felt untrue
[01:42:03.140 --> 01:42:04.940]   to say certain things to certain people.
[01:42:04.940 --> 01:42:07.140]   It felt invasive or offensive,
[01:42:07.140 --> 01:42:09.220]   and that didn't feel true.
[01:42:09.220 --> 01:42:12.420]   Sometimes silence was the greatest truth I could tell,
[01:42:12.420 --> 01:42:14.980]   but I didn't even know that that was the case
[01:42:14.980 --> 01:42:17.100]   until I started my experiment.
[01:42:17.100 --> 01:42:19.140]   So I did not lie for that year,
[01:42:19.140 --> 01:42:21.660]   and I've done it many, many times since.
[01:42:21.660 --> 01:42:25.900]   But I would not recommend jumping into it 100%
[01:42:25.900 --> 01:42:30.140]   from a life that hasn't already been pretty examined.
[01:42:30.140 --> 01:42:31.700]   - What Ana has said,
[01:42:31.700 --> 01:42:33.820]   and I think in the backdrop of what you're saying
[01:42:33.820 --> 01:42:38.100]   is that everybody does these little micro adjustments,
[01:42:38.100 --> 01:42:39.900]   or, and you've said-- - Constantly.
[01:42:39.900 --> 01:42:40.740]   - Constantly.
[01:42:40.740 --> 01:42:42.800]   And you've said that this is largely
[01:42:42.800 --> 01:42:44.860]   to smooth social interactions,
[01:42:44.860 --> 01:42:47.180]   that most of lying is to smooth social interactions.
[01:42:47.180 --> 01:42:49.140]   - Yeah, the research shows that most people lie
[01:42:49.140 --> 01:42:50.940]   at least three times within 10 minutes
[01:42:50.940 --> 01:42:53.420]   of meeting another person, they lie to them.
[01:42:53.420 --> 01:42:56.180]   And men are socially conditioned to tell lies
[01:42:56.180 --> 01:42:58.700]   that make them seem a little bit cooler
[01:42:58.700 --> 01:43:00.780]   than they maybe think they are for real.
[01:43:00.780 --> 01:43:03.620]   And women, people identified as women,
[01:43:03.620 --> 01:43:05.260]   are socialized to tell lies
[01:43:05.260 --> 01:43:07.660]   that make other people feel good about themselves.
[01:43:07.660 --> 01:43:10.800]   So it takes you in different directions,
[01:43:10.800 --> 01:43:14.420]   but I just wasn't gonna tell any lie at all.
[01:43:14.420 --> 01:43:18.820]   And let me just say that that year I,
[01:43:18.820 --> 01:43:21.160]   it's not like, I could say I lost these things,
[01:43:21.160 --> 01:43:22.580]   but the fact is I dropped them,
[01:43:22.580 --> 01:43:24.020]   I walked away from them.
[01:43:24.020 --> 01:43:27.280]   My religion, my, with the religion
[01:43:27.280 --> 01:43:29.420]   went the family of origin.
[01:43:29.420 --> 01:43:31.220]   Every friend I had growing up,
[01:43:31.220 --> 01:43:34.460]   because to leave Mormonism is worse than murder
[01:43:34.460 --> 01:43:39.460]   in that community, I was cast into outer darkness.
[01:43:39.460 --> 01:43:42.340]   My marriage, realized I was gay, oops.
[01:43:42.340 --> 01:43:44.180]   I hadn't figured that out at 29.
[01:43:44.180 --> 01:43:46.420]   - That came to you as a realization in that year.
[01:43:46.420 --> 01:43:47.500]   - Yeah. - Okay.
[01:43:47.500 --> 01:43:50.860]   It must've been in your unconscious someplace prior.
[01:43:50.860 --> 01:43:52.180]   - Yeah. - There'd never been a,
[01:43:52.180 --> 01:43:54.620]   there'd never been a kind of like knock, knock, hey.
[01:43:54.620 --> 01:43:59.100]   - No, I was so bent on being a good person
[01:43:59.100 --> 01:44:00.500]   according to my socialization,
[01:44:00.500 --> 01:44:04.740]   the same way you were bent on being a brave, strong male
[01:44:04.740 --> 01:44:06.900]   according to the skateboarding culture.
[01:44:06.900 --> 01:44:10.220]   I would never have let that anywhere near my consciousness.
[01:44:10.220 --> 01:44:14.100]   And it had to be a series of experiences.
[01:44:14.100 --> 01:44:16.580]   And my ex-husband was gay as well.
[01:44:16.580 --> 01:44:21.380]   So I'd known that about him for a while.
[01:44:21.380 --> 01:44:23.780]   And so, and I knew he was his best self
[01:44:23.780 --> 01:44:25.060]   when he was his gay self.
[01:44:25.060 --> 01:44:26.980]   So that kind of helped,
[01:44:26.980 --> 01:44:29.100]   but the marriage ended because of that.
[01:44:29.100 --> 01:44:32.060]   Let's see, what else happened?
[01:44:32.060 --> 01:44:34.380]   Oh, yeah, I quit academia.
[01:44:34.380 --> 01:44:36.620]   So my industry, the thing I'd gone
[01:44:36.620 --> 01:44:38.340]   to all those years of school for,
[01:44:38.340 --> 01:44:43.100]   my job, means of support, left my,
[01:44:43.100 --> 01:44:44.580]   I was living in Utah at the time
[01:44:44.580 --> 01:44:48.220]   and I sort of fled for the border, so I lost my home.
[01:44:48.220 --> 01:44:50.060]   - How were you feeling during this time?
[01:44:50.060 --> 01:44:51.820]   - Better and better and better.
[01:44:51.820 --> 01:44:54.500]   (both laughing)
[01:44:54.500 --> 01:44:57.580]   - I expected you to be like, it was horrible.
[01:44:57.580 --> 01:44:59.260]   You're like, no, better and better.
[01:44:59.260 --> 01:45:00.100]   - It kind of was,
[01:45:00.100 --> 01:45:02.980]   but not as horrible as staying in all those things.
[01:45:02.980 --> 01:45:08.940]   - And the part that intrigues me at the moment
[01:45:08.940 --> 01:45:13.700]   is like the losing of friends,
[01:45:13.700 --> 01:45:15.860]   like losing of people and the structures
[01:45:15.860 --> 01:45:18.660]   that we relied on also for safety.
[01:45:18.660 --> 01:45:19.940]   That's gotta be hard.
[01:45:19.940 --> 01:45:24.060]   Oh, it's very, yeah, for parts of the psyche
[01:45:24.060 --> 01:45:29.060]   that are very attached to socialization
[01:45:29.060 --> 01:45:32.060]   and attached to people that are familiar to you,
[01:45:32.060 --> 01:45:34.980]   it's heartbreaking, really heartbreaking,
[01:45:34.980 --> 01:45:39.980]   but that light gave me a full-on experience of the self.
[01:45:39.980 --> 01:45:45.140]   And I just, what it told me was, it's always there.
[01:45:45.140 --> 01:45:46.540]   My son, who has Down syndrome,
[01:45:46.540 --> 01:45:50.220]   one day told me after his friend's mother died,
[01:45:50.220 --> 01:45:51.500]   we were coming home from the funeral,
[01:45:51.500 --> 01:45:53.580]   and he said, "I didn't cry."
[01:45:53.580 --> 01:45:55.100]   And I said, "It's okay if you cried.
[01:45:55.100 --> 01:45:57.780]   "Strong men cry, and this is a sad time."
[01:45:57.780 --> 01:46:01.140]   And he said, "It's not as hard after the light comes
[01:46:01.140 --> 01:46:03.620]   "and opens your heart."
[01:46:03.620 --> 01:46:07.740]   And he can barely talk, and so it was very garbled.
[01:46:07.740 --> 01:46:10.420]   And I was like, what, a light came and opened your heart?
[01:46:10.420 --> 01:46:11.460]   He said, "Mm-hmm."
[01:46:11.460 --> 01:46:13.340]   I said, "Well, when did this happen?"
[01:46:13.340 --> 01:46:15.300]   He said, "May 10th."
[01:46:15.300 --> 01:46:17.220]   And I was like, "This year?"
[01:46:17.220 --> 01:46:19.660]   "No, I was 13."
[01:46:19.660 --> 01:46:21.620]   And I was like, "You're holding out on me."
[01:46:21.620 --> 01:46:24.820]   So this light had appeared in his room
[01:46:24.820 --> 01:46:26.940]   when he was having a really hard time.
[01:46:26.940 --> 01:46:29.660]   Kids with Down syndrome don't have easy lives.
[01:46:29.660 --> 01:46:32.260]   And it touched his heart.
[01:46:32.260 --> 01:46:35.180]   And he said, "Since then, nothing was as hard."
[01:46:35.180 --> 01:46:37.380]   And I said, "You know, I saw it too,
[01:46:37.380 --> 01:46:39.660]   "and it said to me that it's always with us,
[01:46:39.660 --> 01:46:41.620]   "even though we can't see it."
[01:46:41.620 --> 01:46:44.100]   And he said, "Oh, I can see it."
[01:46:44.100 --> 01:46:46.700]   And I was like, "You can?"
[01:46:46.700 --> 01:46:48.660]   And he was like, "Yeah."
[01:46:48.660 --> 01:46:51.700]   Like, he was sort of disappointed in me.
[01:46:51.700 --> 01:46:52.700]   And I said, "Well, where is it?
[01:46:52.700 --> 01:46:54.860]   "Is it like up there, down here in your head,
[01:46:54.860 --> 01:46:55.700]   "in your heart?"
[01:46:55.700 --> 01:46:59.380]   And he just looked at me and he said, "Mom, it's everywhere."
[01:46:59.380 --> 01:47:01.580]   He just sees the whole world illuminated.
[01:47:01.580 --> 01:47:04.060]   And I think that's what I saw in the forest
[01:47:04.060 --> 01:47:06.820]   when suddenly the world would just turn to light.
[01:47:06.820 --> 01:47:08.940]   It was that light.
[01:47:08.940 --> 01:47:10.540]   So that was the field.
[01:47:10.540 --> 01:47:14.540]   And as I lost each friendship, as I lost each job,
[01:47:14.540 --> 01:47:18.020]   as I faced the fear and the heartbreak and everything,
[01:47:18.020 --> 01:47:19.900]   those parts of me were dissolving,
[01:47:19.900 --> 01:47:24.020]   and I was becoming more identified with that light.
[01:47:24.020 --> 01:47:25.700]   And that was the thing.
[01:47:25.700 --> 01:47:26.940]   It was completely selfish.
[01:47:26.940 --> 01:47:28.940]   I was not going back to the way I felt
[01:47:28.940 --> 01:47:30.700]   before I felt that light.
[01:47:30.700 --> 01:47:32.380]   Never going back there.
[01:47:32.380 --> 01:47:35.780]   - Did you feel as if you had to accomplish certain things,
[01:47:35.780 --> 01:47:39.900]   degrees, et cetera, first, in order to allow yourself this?
[01:47:40.780 --> 01:47:42.500]   - 'Cause I hear this a lot.
[01:47:42.500 --> 01:47:45.060]   And in the backdrop of this entire conversation,
[01:47:45.060 --> 01:47:48.940]   I have one little piece of neural real estate,
[01:47:48.940 --> 01:47:52.180]   which is like devoted to the audience that is saying,
[01:47:52.180 --> 01:47:55.060]   "Okay, I can do these things once I have a job,
[01:47:55.060 --> 01:47:58.420]   "once I have blank, once I have the resources."
[01:47:58.420 --> 01:48:00.740]   But at the same time, I do wanna highlight for people
[01:48:00.740 --> 01:48:03.620]   that everything that we've talked about
[01:48:03.620 --> 01:48:05.980]   in terms of practices and things to do,
[01:48:05.980 --> 01:48:08.060]   like you just do them.
[01:48:08.060 --> 01:48:09.700]   There's no purchase.
[01:48:09.700 --> 01:48:11.540]   Like it's inside of us.
[01:48:11.540 --> 01:48:15.060]   There's no looking to something in a package
[01:48:15.060 --> 01:48:16.780]   or in even a program.
[01:48:16.780 --> 01:48:19.340]   It's all within us.
[01:48:19.340 --> 01:48:22.020]   So it can be done at really anywhere
[01:48:22.020 --> 01:48:26.020]   and with any amount of resources or lack thereof, but--
[01:48:26.020 --> 01:48:27.980]   - But be gentle with yourself.
[01:48:27.980 --> 01:48:28.980]   Don't quit your job.
[01:48:28.980 --> 01:48:30.260]   I mean, I was very violent.
[01:48:30.260 --> 01:48:31.980]   I was quite a lot like you.
[01:48:31.980 --> 01:48:32.900]   The way I got to Harvard
[01:48:32.900 --> 01:48:35.260]   was I had a part of myself called Fang
[01:48:35.260 --> 01:48:37.540]   that did not care what hurt me.
[01:48:37.540 --> 01:48:39.660]   I'd go running in the snow.
[01:48:39.660 --> 01:48:42.660]   I remember once I bought running shoes that were too small
[01:48:42.660 --> 01:48:44.940]   and all my toenails came off during that run
[01:48:44.940 --> 01:48:46.220]   and I just kept running.
[01:48:46.220 --> 01:48:50.100]   And I'd stop and take off another toenail and keep running.
[01:48:50.100 --> 01:48:52.740]   I was able to be very brutal to myself.
[01:48:52.740 --> 01:48:54.940]   - Just living in Boston is brutal to me.
[01:48:54.940 --> 01:48:56.540]   - Well, you know, on the plus side,
[01:48:56.540 --> 01:48:58.860]   my feet were completely numb because of the cold, so--
[01:48:58.860 --> 01:49:00.220]   - Right, okay, there's that.
[01:49:00.220 --> 01:49:05.260]   So you have the capacity for extreme resilience.
[01:49:05.260 --> 01:49:06.100]   - Yeah.
[01:49:06.100 --> 01:49:09.180]   - And it perhaps took you too far.
[01:49:09.180 --> 01:49:11.420]   - Yeah, and I think that's why I did this
[01:49:11.420 --> 01:49:14.060]   massive integrity cleanse when I was at a place
[01:49:14.060 --> 01:49:16.540]   where I was far, far away from my true self.
[01:49:16.540 --> 01:49:17.660]   And because of that,
[01:49:17.660 --> 01:49:20.780]   it was a kind of violent breaking of connections.
[01:49:20.780 --> 01:49:24.580]   So now if I'm coaching somebody, I'm like, be very gentle.
[01:49:24.580 --> 01:49:26.940]   Take the, I call it one degree turns.
[01:49:26.940 --> 01:49:28.100]   If you're flying a plane
[01:49:28.100 --> 01:49:31.220]   and you turn one degree north every half hour,
[01:49:31.220 --> 01:49:33.100]   you won't even notice it's turning,
[01:49:33.100 --> 01:49:35.340]   but you'll end up someplace very different.
[01:49:35.340 --> 01:49:40.340]   So just gently move away from what causes you to suffer.
[01:49:40.340 --> 01:49:44.900]   Get yourself the hot cup of tea in the morning
[01:49:44.900 --> 01:49:46.340]   to soothe your throat.
[01:49:46.340 --> 01:49:48.360]   Listen to your own sorrow.
[01:49:48.360 --> 01:49:51.860]   Cancel a meeting because you just don't feel like doing it.
[01:49:51.860 --> 01:49:53.080]   You know, these are the things
[01:49:53.080 --> 01:49:55.300]   that bring you back to your truth.
[01:49:55.300 --> 01:49:57.460]   And it's always loving.
[01:49:57.460 --> 01:49:59.700]   And it's not loving necessarily to just say,
[01:49:59.700 --> 01:50:01.780]   I'm gonna say the truth about everything
[01:50:01.780 --> 01:50:04.580]   and I don't care who hates me for it.
[01:50:04.580 --> 01:50:05.660]   That was just my way.
[01:50:05.660 --> 01:50:09.740]   - And inevitably a much kinder,
[01:50:09.740 --> 01:50:11.900]   more generous version of ourselves emerges
[01:50:11.900 --> 01:50:13.820]   when we're living our truth.
[01:50:13.820 --> 01:50:17.100]   I mean, it's a foregone conclusion, but still worth stating.
[01:50:17.100 --> 01:50:21.300]   Yeah, I can personally say that most of my suffering
[01:50:21.300 --> 01:50:26.300]   has been the consequence of the fact that I love love.
[01:50:26.300 --> 01:50:30.940]   And I'm blessed with many great friends
[01:50:30.940 --> 01:50:35.820]   and things of that sort, business partners, et cetera.
[01:50:35.820 --> 01:50:39.860]   But I have a tendency to get into relationships quickly
[01:50:39.860 --> 01:50:42.540]   and ending them feels near impossible.
[01:50:42.540 --> 01:50:46.380]   And this has caused me and also others too much suffering.
[01:50:46.380 --> 01:50:48.620]   And so a lot of that is,
[01:50:48.620 --> 01:50:50.980]   the reason I raised this is that
[01:50:50.980 --> 01:50:55.060]   it's about holding two truths at the same time,
[01:50:55.060 --> 01:50:57.560]   which feel incompatible.
[01:50:57.560 --> 01:50:59.900]   On the one hand, really loving and caring
[01:50:59.900 --> 01:51:01.640]   about someone.
[01:51:01.640 --> 01:51:04.460]   And at the same time,
[01:51:04.460 --> 01:51:07.100]   knowing that the loving caring thing to do
[01:51:07.100 --> 01:51:08.660]   is to go separate ways.
[01:51:08.660 --> 01:51:10.600]   And it's this relationship to loss
[01:51:10.600 --> 01:51:14.100]   that I sort of can't accept or haven't been able to.
[01:51:14.100 --> 01:51:16.060]   Like I can accept that people die.
[01:51:16.060 --> 01:51:19.940]   All three of my academic advisors, wonderful people,
[01:51:19.940 --> 01:51:21.580]   suicide, cancer, cancer.
[01:51:21.580 --> 01:51:25.140]   Like, so I had to come to the conclusion pretty early on
[01:51:25.140 --> 01:51:26.220]   in my academic career.
[01:51:26.220 --> 01:51:29.300]   Like, wow, like I'm the common denominator.
[01:51:29.300 --> 01:51:32.420]   I joke, like, and it took me a long time to realize
[01:51:32.420 --> 01:51:36.180]   like this might not be my fault.
[01:51:36.180 --> 01:51:37.020]   I know it's crazy.
[01:51:37.020 --> 01:51:38.340]   Like how would that,
[01:51:38.340 --> 01:51:40.980]   but I think that it also woke me up to the idea,
[01:51:40.980 --> 01:51:44.500]   like life as we know it in this life ends.
[01:51:44.500 --> 01:51:46.820]   And so to try and make the most of it,
[01:51:46.820 --> 01:51:51.820]   but the idea that people would move apart,
[01:51:51.820 --> 01:51:57.380]   even in circumstances where death doesn't separate them,
[01:51:57.380 --> 01:51:59.620]   to me, it's like, it's so painful.
[01:51:59.620 --> 01:52:02.200]   - Yeah, was it Keats who said that of all the ways
[01:52:02.200 --> 01:52:05.900]   there are to lose a person, death is the kindest.
[01:52:05.900 --> 01:52:07.660]   Like that, yeah.
[01:52:07.660 --> 01:52:10.300]   - Yeah, and this has roots in all sorts of things,
[01:52:10.300 --> 01:52:11.120]   in me, of course.
[01:52:11.120 --> 01:52:13.540]   But the reason I raise it is that I think that
[01:52:13.540 --> 01:52:16.460]   when we have two incompatible truths,
[01:52:16.460 --> 01:52:18.420]   that's when we feel stuck.
[01:52:18.420 --> 01:52:21.380]   Like we love people, we wanna take care of them.
[01:52:21.380 --> 01:52:23.500]   Maybe we want them to remain in our lives,
[01:52:23.500 --> 01:52:26.820]   but we have to, like the letting go process sucks.
[01:52:26.820 --> 01:52:29.140]   There can't be incompatible truths.
[01:52:29.140 --> 01:52:31.700]   I think what happens is that you,
[01:52:31.700 --> 01:52:34.060]   and just tell me where I'm wrong, okay?
[01:52:34.060 --> 01:52:36.640]   I could be completely full of crap.
[01:52:36.640 --> 01:52:38.980]   It sounds to me like you're one of the people
[01:52:38.980 --> 01:52:41.860]   who have a huge heart,
[01:52:41.860 --> 01:52:45.740]   who sometimes confuse love with self-abandonment,
[01:52:45.740 --> 01:52:50.740]   who love so deeply that you want the joy of the beloved
[01:52:50.740 --> 01:52:52.580]   more than you want your own joy.
[01:52:52.580 --> 01:52:54.100]   - 100%.
[01:52:54.100 --> 01:52:59.100]   - And that is not love, that is a hostage situation, okay?
[01:52:59.100 --> 01:53:02.780]   Like there's something I call spider love.
[01:53:02.780 --> 01:53:05.420]   If you say to a spider, "How do you feel about flies?"
[01:53:05.420 --> 01:53:06.940]   It would say, "Oh, I love them."
[01:53:06.940 --> 01:53:10.500]   And it expresses that love by immobilizing them,
[01:53:10.500 --> 01:53:12.580]   wrapping them up, and injecting them with poison,
[01:53:12.580 --> 01:53:14.340]   and then sucking out their life force
[01:53:14.340 --> 01:53:15.380]   whenever it needs them.
[01:53:15.380 --> 01:53:18.500]   And it loves those flies, yum.
[01:53:18.500 --> 01:53:23.460]   But love always sets the beloved free, okay?
[01:53:23.460 --> 01:53:25.060]   So there's a consumptive love.
[01:53:25.060 --> 01:53:28.980]   And when you are a fly, and you meet a spider,
[01:53:28.980 --> 01:53:32.180]   and you give your whole self to this person,
[01:53:32.180 --> 01:53:35.580]   who goes, "Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, I really want that,"
[01:53:35.580 --> 01:53:40.580]   you find yourself starved of your own validation,
[01:53:40.580 --> 01:53:44.580]   your kindness to your true self,
[01:53:44.580 --> 01:53:46.420]   and you've given it all to the other person,
[01:53:46.420 --> 01:53:48.260]   and that's when it will not work.
[01:53:48.260 --> 01:53:51.900]   And you may be missing the people
[01:53:51.900 --> 01:53:55.940]   who aren't looking for flies, or who want to just,
[01:53:55.940 --> 01:53:58.040]   I'm not gonna extend this metaphor any further,
[01:53:58.040 --> 01:54:01.540]   who just wanna be with you as a whole human,
[01:54:01.540 --> 01:54:04.100]   who want to know what your limitations are,
[01:54:04.100 --> 01:54:07.280]   as well as their own, who will say to you,
[01:54:07.280 --> 01:54:10.260]   "I have a new friend who had pneumonia,
[01:54:10.260 --> 01:54:12.720]   "and I wanted to talk to her on the phone,
[01:54:12.720 --> 01:54:15.100]   "and I told my assistant, I don't care if I have pneumonia."
[01:54:15.100 --> 01:54:18.860]   And she wrote me a text, and she said,
[01:54:18.860 --> 01:54:22.060]   "Do not impinge on your own health,
[01:54:22.060 --> 01:54:23.860]   "because you want me to feel loved.
[01:54:23.860 --> 01:54:27.940]   "I don't like it, I want you to be healthy."
[01:54:27.940 --> 01:54:29.880]   And I was like, "Well, whew."
[01:54:29.880 --> 01:54:35.940]   So I would examine the moment
[01:54:35.940 --> 01:54:40.340]   where you become so entranced with another,
[01:54:40.340 --> 01:54:43.700]   that you stop caring about yourself,
[01:54:43.700 --> 01:54:46.180]   and try to feed your whole life to them,
[01:54:47.060 --> 01:54:49.060]   'cause that is not love.
[01:54:49.060 --> 01:54:51.100]   It's just something our culture defines as love.
[01:54:51.100 --> 01:54:54.060]   A lot of parents love their children that way.
[01:54:54.060 --> 01:54:57.740]   But you have to be able to know exactly what you want,
[01:54:57.740 --> 01:54:59.900]   to communicate it to the other person,
[01:54:59.900 --> 01:55:03.260]   and to have them say, "I completely respect that."
[01:55:03.260 --> 01:55:06.940]   Or you don't have a love situation, you have codependency.
[01:55:06.940 --> 01:55:08.460]   - That's very useful, thank you.
[01:55:08.460 --> 01:55:11.180]   And I know it will be very useful to many people.
[01:55:11.180 --> 01:55:14.380]   What is the suggestion for people
[01:55:15.420 --> 01:55:18.780]   that are trying to figure out what they want,
[01:55:18.780 --> 01:55:20.460]   or need, or both?
[01:55:20.460 --> 01:55:22.540]   - I'll relate it to this relationship thing,
[01:55:22.540 --> 01:55:25.340]   because it applies across everything,
[01:55:25.340 --> 01:55:27.300]   but it's hardest in relationships.
[01:55:27.300 --> 01:55:32.260]   And that is, start to notice the first moment
[01:55:32.260 --> 01:55:35.620]   when part of you, a deep part of you,
[01:55:35.620 --> 01:55:38.820]   knew you were losing your integrity.
[01:55:38.820 --> 01:55:40.740]   So if you think about a relationship you had
[01:55:40.740 --> 01:55:43.540]   that ended poorly, where you loved the other person
[01:55:43.540 --> 01:55:46.340]   by giving your whole self to them,
[01:55:46.340 --> 01:55:48.460]   which you've been taught is called love,
[01:55:48.460 --> 01:55:50.660]   even though I don't think it is called love.
[01:55:50.660 --> 01:55:55.500]   So, and then look back on the first moment
[01:55:55.500 --> 01:55:58.860]   that she wanted something,
[01:55:58.860 --> 01:56:01.580]   and you abandoned yourself to give it to her.
[01:56:01.580 --> 01:56:04.620]   And it's usually very early in the relationship.
[01:56:04.620 --> 01:56:06.460]   Like, day one.
[01:56:06.460 --> 01:56:08.540]   - Yeah, it's like, this isn't safe.
[01:56:08.540 --> 01:56:09.380]   - Exactly.
[01:56:09.380 --> 01:56:13.300]   And you just crushed right over that boundary,
[01:56:13.300 --> 01:56:17.500]   that very sensitive inner vigilance
[01:56:17.500 --> 01:56:20.140]   that's saying this is how we stay whole,
[01:56:20.140 --> 01:56:22.740]   and/or this is how we stay in integrity.
[01:56:22.740 --> 01:56:26.140]   So most people, with a job, with a relationship,
[01:56:26.140 --> 01:56:30.020]   with any choice they make, they can trace it back.
[01:56:30.020 --> 01:56:32.620]   When I pick up the pieces for them years later,
[01:56:32.620 --> 01:56:35.620]   they're like, "Oh, I knew that the first week,
[01:56:35.620 --> 01:56:38.580]   "and I stayed in there for 20 years."
[01:56:38.580 --> 01:56:40.460]   So it's about, as I said earlier,
[01:56:40.460 --> 01:56:42.700]   being really granular in your experience
[01:56:42.700 --> 01:56:43.580]   of your own suffering,
[01:56:43.580 --> 01:56:47.340]   and knowing that you are not here to suffer.
[01:56:47.340 --> 01:56:52.540]   There's this big thing that men in our society are taught
[01:56:52.540 --> 01:56:54.140]   that if, you know, there are love songs,
[01:56:54.140 --> 01:56:59.140]   like I would, the, I can't remember his name,
[01:56:59.140 --> 01:57:01.420]   he won the Nobel Prize for Literature,
[01:57:01.420 --> 01:57:04.580]   and, you know, I would crawl down the avenue,
[01:57:04.580 --> 01:57:07.980]   black and blue, to show my love, to make you feel my love.
[01:57:07.980 --> 01:57:11.260]   And it's like, okay, that's not showing me love.
[01:57:11.260 --> 01:57:14.180]   You don't have to hurt yourself to show me love.
[01:57:14.180 --> 01:57:17.420]   But maybe that's why you have to pull back
[01:57:17.420 --> 01:57:19.940]   six inches from your own eyes
[01:57:19.940 --> 01:57:22.460]   to brutalize yourself for other people.
[01:57:22.460 --> 01:57:27.460]   That martyr archetype, it's, no, it doesn't work.
[01:57:27.460 --> 01:57:31.140]   Yeah, it's caused me, and I think others,
[01:57:31.140 --> 01:57:34.460]   a lot of suffering, because I think what ends up happening
[01:57:34.460 --> 01:57:38.460]   is that when we get separation from that person,
[01:57:38.460 --> 01:57:40.540]   then we do a little bit of self-recovery,
[01:57:40.540 --> 01:57:43.460]   but then it's like all fractured.
[01:57:43.460 --> 01:57:44.620]   - And repeat, yeah.
[01:57:44.620 --> 01:57:46.900]   - And repeat, right, exactly.
[01:57:46.900 --> 01:57:49.620]   What you just described is extremely helpful.
[01:57:49.620 --> 01:57:53.740]   I'm curious, in your role as a coach to many people,
[01:57:53.740 --> 01:57:58.460]   how often are romantic relationships,
[01:57:58.460 --> 01:57:59.940]   partnership-type things,
[01:57:59.940 --> 01:58:02.140]   whatever form that takes for people,
[01:58:02.140 --> 01:58:06.060]   how often is that like the bulk of what people struggle with,
[01:58:06.060 --> 01:58:08.300]   at least in terms of what they bring to the table?
[01:58:08.300 --> 01:58:10.660]   Or is it more often, I don't like my job,
[01:58:10.660 --> 01:58:13.220]   I'm in the wrong life, professionally?
[01:58:13.220 --> 01:58:18.220]   If you had to give us like the non-peer-reviewed study,
[01:58:18.220 --> 01:58:20.820]   but like kind of crude breakdown.
[01:58:20.820 --> 01:58:23.180]   - Yeah, I think because they identify me as a coach,
[01:58:23.180 --> 01:58:25.180]   they go to a therapist with relationship things,
[01:58:25.180 --> 01:58:27.580]   but people come to me with my life's just not working,
[01:58:27.580 --> 01:58:28.980]   that feeling you were describing.
[01:58:28.980 --> 01:58:29.820]   - Like the whole thing, oh, great, nice.
[01:58:29.820 --> 01:58:30.640]   So they give you the whole thing.
[01:58:30.640 --> 01:58:31.480]   - Yeah, the whole thing's not working,
[01:58:31.480 --> 01:58:33.460]   I need to change my job, I need to change my job,
[01:58:33.460 --> 01:58:37.940]   I need to get my purpose, I need to have my life's meaning.
[01:58:37.940 --> 01:58:40.340]   And it always ends up ending up
[01:58:40.340 --> 01:58:42.440]   to be about the relationship as well.
[01:58:42.440 --> 01:58:46.820]   Anybody, anything we do that's dysfunctional
[01:58:46.820 --> 01:58:48.100]   for any part of ourselves
[01:58:48.100 --> 01:58:50.620]   is dysfunctional for every part of ourselves.
[01:58:50.620 --> 01:58:53.500]   The way we do anything is the way we do everything.
[01:58:53.500 --> 01:58:55.740]   So if you come in with a job issue
[01:58:55.740 --> 01:58:59.060]   because you've got a horrible boss,
[01:58:59.060 --> 01:58:59.900]   but you never complain,
[01:58:59.900 --> 01:59:01.520]   you're gonna end up telling me
[01:59:01.520 --> 01:59:03.000]   that you're in a horrible marriage
[01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:06.300]   with a spouse who's awful, but you never complain.
[01:59:06.300 --> 01:59:10.580]   The same issues come forward as a kind of gift
[01:59:10.580 --> 01:59:13.440]   to show us over and over, not that way.
[01:59:13.440 --> 01:59:15.400]   No, okay, see that pattern?
[01:59:15.400 --> 01:59:16.240]   No.
[01:59:16.240 --> 01:59:17.080]   See that pattern?
[01:59:17.080 --> 01:59:17.900]   No.
[01:59:17.900 --> 01:59:18.820]   - Well, it's interesting that you say that,
[01:59:18.820 --> 01:59:20.980]   'cause I feel like professionally,
[01:59:20.980 --> 01:59:23.000]   it's like there's like a gravitational pull.
[01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:26.520]   Like I wanted to get into tropical fish when I was a kid,
[01:59:26.520 --> 01:59:27.560]   and I was like, tropical fish, tropical,
[01:59:27.560 --> 01:59:29.560]   I would spend all day at the tropical fish store.
[01:59:29.560 --> 01:59:31.100]   Then it was birds.
[01:59:31.100 --> 01:59:33.320]   Then it was skateboarding.
[01:59:33.320 --> 01:59:35.640]   Then it was, you know, I wanted to be a firefighter,
[01:59:35.640 --> 01:59:37.640]   like whatever, eventually it was neuroscience
[01:59:37.640 --> 01:59:38.880]   and it was podcasting.
[01:59:38.880 --> 01:59:43.040]   You know, it's just like, I can't miss.
[01:59:43.040 --> 01:59:45.320]   When I say that, I mean, I can't keep myself
[01:59:45.320 --> 01:59:47.040]   from doing what I really want.
[01:59:47.040 --> 01:59:49.460]   I would say likewise with friendships,
[01:59:49.460 --> 01:59:51.040]   I'm fortunate to have a great relationship
[01:59:51.040 --> 01:59:52.680]   to my biological family.
[01:59:52.680 --> 01:59:55.440]   It was rock, really rocky for a lot of years,
[01:59:55.440 --> 01:59:58.240]   but it's like the work has paid off
[01:59:58.240 --> 01:59:59.800]   and they've done a lot of work.
[01:59:59.800 --> 02:00:04.140]   In romantic partnership, it's like a carve out.
[02:00:04.140 --> 02:00:05.340]   It's been much more challenging.
[02:00:05.340 --> 02:00:09.320]   I've had some amazing partners in partnerships, like amazing.
[02:00:09.320 --> 02:00:12.680]   I'm still on excellent terms with many of them.
[02:00:12.680 --> 02:00:15.880]   And then I've had some like really, really brutal,
[02:00:15.880 --> 02:00:19.560]   like barbed wire, just like,
[02:00:19.560 --> 02:00:22.040]   and you know, I've had to take a look at my role
[02:00:22.040 --> 02:00:23.760]   in that too, right?
[02:00:23.760 --> 02:00:26.160]   So in this case, for me, it's like a carve out.
[02:00:26.160 --> 02:00:29.520]   I think of it as like this like wedge shaped carve out.
[02:00:29.520 --> 02:00:31.300]   It just seems so much more challenging.
[02:00:31.300 --> 02:00:33.800]   But I think in talking with you today,
[02:00:33.800 --> 02:00:36.840]   it's clear that it's because of this thing of like,
[02:00:36.840 --> 02:00:39.640]   it's not, I'm not approaching it from the standpoint
[02:00:39.640 --> 02:00:43.160]   of like, I want to do this and it's good for me,
[02:00:43.160 --> 02:00:47.400]   to be frank, whereas in the work domain,
[02:00:47.400 --> 02:00:50.400]   it's like what feels good ends up being really good for me.
[02:00:50.400 --> 02:00:52.960]   - 'Cause for a while you did things that hurt you
[02:00:52.960 --> 02:00:54.960]   and then you realized, no, the things that hurt me,
[02:00:54.960 --> 02:00:55.800]   I'm not gonna do that.
[02:00:55.800 --> 02:00:57.440]   I'm gonna do the things I like.
[02:00:57.440 --> 02:00:59.360]   When you bring another human being into it,
[02:00:59.360 --> 02:01:01.460]   when it's a romantic partnership,
[02:01:01.460 --> 02:01:03.720]   I think you still have the pattern of,
[02:01:03.720 --> 02:01:05.200]   I will do things that hurt me.
[02:01:05.200 --> 02:01:07.400]   I will abandon my sense of safety.
[02:01:07.400 --> 02:01:12.400]   I will go over my own experienced internal boundary
[02:01:12.400 --> 02:01:15.320]   and you just haven't, you've done it in other areas
[02:01:15.320 --> 02:01:19.040]   of your life, but this is, yeah, this is a big one for you
[02:01:19.040 --> 02:01:22.080]   where you just haven't applied the same wisdom
[02:01:22.080 --> 02:01:23.340]   you've learned in other areas.
[02:01:23.380 --> 02:01:26.820]   And I would guess that it's because you don't feel
[02:01:26.820 --> 02:01:29.100]   that that's loving to the other person.
[02:01:29.100 --> 02:01:32.340]   If you decide you're not gonna kill animals at your job,
[02:01:32.340 --> 02:01:35.220]   the people at your lab aren't gonna be heartbroken.
[02:01:35.220 --> 02:01:38.860]   But if you decide you don't want to live a certain kind
[02:01:38.860 --> 02:01:41.300]   of life with another person,
[02:01:41.300 --> 02:01:43.540]   that person's heart could get broken
[02:01:43.540 --> 02:01:45.500]   or at least they could feel that way.
[02:01:45.500 --> 02:01:47.900]   They could genuinely feel pain.
[02:01:47.900 --> 02:01:50.580]   So I think maybe that's why it's a cutout thing
[02:01:50.580 --> 02:01:54.640]   because it's changing your job doesn't hurt someone,
[02:01:54.640 --> 02:01:57.540]   but changing your relationship pattern,
[02:01:57.540 --> 02:01:59.640]   somebody could get hurt.
[02:01:59.640 --> 02:02:03.980]   And if you don't change your pattern,
[02:02:03.980 --> 02:02:05.460]   someone will also get hurt.
[02:02:05.460 --> 02:02:08.300]   - Right, well, and that's often the case, right?
[02:02:08.300 --> 02:02:10.940]   And I think, so this notion of others getting hurt
[02:02:10.940 --> 02:02:13.720]   when we make the choice that's most in line
[02:02:13.720 --> 02:02:16.780]   with our own integrity, whether it's relationship
[02:02:16.780 --> 02:02:20.740]   or family or the decision to move or leave a job,
[02:02:20.740 --> 02:02:22.300]   how do you sit with that?
[02:02:22.300 --> 02:02:24.780]   I mean, how does one sit with that?
[02:02:24.780 --> 02:02:27.820]   I mean, I think I have clearly internalized some script
[02:02:27.820 --> 02:02:30.980]   that says if someone else is really upset,
[02:02:30.980 --> 02:02:33.140]   even, you know, and obviously the right thing
[02:02:33.140 --> 02:02:35.100]   is often not the thing that makes people feel best,
[02:02:35.100 --> 02:02:36.620]   et cetera, et cetera, you know,
[02:02:36.620 --> 02:02:39.340]   but how do you work with that?
[02:02:39.340 --> 02:02:41.660]   - So there are different ways of reframing it.
[02:02:41.660 --> 02:02:45.420]   And one example, since you know a lot about addiction,
[02:02:45.420 --> 02:02:48.540]   if somebody is addicted to you pleasing them,
[02:02:48.540 --> 02:02:52.220]   you're pleasing them and going out of your integrity
[02:02:52.220 --> 02:02:54.540]   to please them, to give them whatever they want
[02:02:54.540 --> 02:02:55.580]   that pleases them.
[02:02:55.580 --> 02:02:58.520]   Your addiction as a codependent is giving them
[02:02:58.520 --> 02:03:02.620]   that emotional energy, whatever gets them high.
[02:03:02.620 --> 02:03:06.940]   And their absorption of that energy
[02:03:06.940 --> 02:03:08.740]   and the imbalance that results,
[02:03:08.740 --> 02:03:11.620]   it's as if they are getting high on you.
[02:03:12.580 --> 02:03:17.020]   And an alcoholic, if you take away the bottle of booze,
[02:03:17.020 --> 02:03:18.940]   will tell you, you are hurting me.
[02:03:18.940 --> 02:03:21.940]   This is the worst thing you could ever do to me.
[02:03:21.940 --> 02:03:25.140]   You have no idea how much I'm suffering.
[02:03:25.140 --> 02:03:27.660]   And the thing you have to do in an intervention is,
[02:03:27.660 --> 02:03:30.380]   no, it's the alcohol that's doing the hurting.
[02:03:30.380 --> 02:03:32.080]   You know, it's the overgiving.
[02:03:32.080 --> 02:03:34.500]   It's allowing someone to consume your energy
[02:03:34.500 --> 02:03:36.220]   and to get high on it.
[02:03:36.220 --> 02:03:37.660]   That is an addiction.
[02:03:37.660 --> 02:03:39.620]   I will not let you do it.
[02:03:39.620 --> 02:03:44.220]   I will separate from you person to person
[02:03:44.220 --> 02:03:47.040]   if you continue in your addictive pattern.
[02:03:47.040 --> 02:03:49.620]   Doesn't mean that we won't be together in the great self
[02:03:49.620 --> 02:03:50.780]   and that we're all oneself
[02:03:50.780 --> 02:03:52.700]   and we can all love each other forever.
[02:03:52.700 --> 02:03:56.660]   But it is not kind to feed someone's addiction
[02:03:56.660 --> 02:03:58.620]   to eating your energy.
[02:03:58.620 --> 02:03:59.460]   Does that make sense?
[02:03:59.460 --> 02:04:00.420]   - Yes.
[02:04:00.420 --> 02:04:03.540]   - It's not, you have to do some tough love.
[02:04:03.540 --> 02:04:07.620]   - Yeah, the compassionate thing is to do the right thing.
[02:04:07.620 --> 02:04:09.700]   Yeah, this is not helping you.
[02:04:09.700 --> 02:04:11.420]   And they say, but I want more of you.
[02:04:11.420 --> 02:04:14.340]   And you say, no, no, you really don't.
[02:04:14.340 --> 02:04:15.800]   You want something false.
[02:04:15.800 --> 02:04:18.580]   I was creating for you and it's actually not me.
[02:04:18.580 --> 02:04:21.620]   You know, my friends who, why would you leave the church?
[02:04:21.620 --> 02:04:23.020]   Now you're lost to us.
[02:04:23.020 --> 02:04:26.700]   And I was like, no, I was always a gay non-Mormon.
[02:04:26.700 --> 02:04:29.580]   You know, I was just feeding you the story
[02:04:29.580 --> 02:04:32.060]   that I was a straight Mormon girl, you know,
[02:04:32.060 --> 02:04:33.980]   and I can't feed you that anymore.
[02:04:33.980 --> 02:04:34.820]   It's making you sick.
[02:04:34.820 --> 02:04:35.740]   It's making me sick.
[02:04:35.740 --> 02:04:36.640]   It's not true.
[02:04:37.480 --> 02:04:41.960]   And some of them I never saw again.
[02:04:41.960 --> 02:04:44.840]   And some of them came around years later and said,
[02:04:44.840 --> 02:04:46.600]   oh, I figured it out.
[02:04:46.600 --> 02:04:51.120]   And some probably still are really happy
[02:04:51.120 --> 02:04:52.520]   and think I'm going to hell.
[02:04:52.520 --> 02:04:57.120]   - Sorry, I didn't mean to laugh at that, but I did.
[02:04:57.120 --> 02:04:58.760]   I don't know.
[02:04:58.760 --> 02:05:00.280]   - I find it hilarious.
[02:05:00.280 --> 02:05:03.280]   - I mean, sorry, not sorry.
[02:05:03.440 --> 02:05:06.560]   - No, that was just nothing to do but laugh there.
[02:05:06.560 --> 02:05:09.840]   Goodness.
[02:05:09.840 --> 02:05:12.640]   Yeah, I think this notion of things ending
[02:05:12.640 --> 02:05:15.680]   because we realized that we were telling lies.
[02:05:15.680 --> 02:05:16.520]   - Yeah.
[02:05:16.520 --> 02:05:18.520]   - And gosh, it even hurts to say.
[02:05:18.520 --> 02:05:19.360]   - Yeah.
[02:05:19.360 --> 02:05:22.440]   - You know, it's like, because we weren't trying
[02:05:22.440 --> 02:05:23.280]   to tell lies.
[02:05:23.280 --> 02:05:24.280]   - No, no.
[02:05:24.280 --> 02:05:25.960]   - We didn't know we were telling lies.
[02:05:25.960 --> 02:05:28.840]   - Yeah, it's an innocent mistake.
[02:05:28.880 --> 02:05:33.880]   - To me, that often grows from what I think of as empathy,
[02:05:33.880 --> 02:05:37.720]   probably not, certainly not the best form of empathy.
[02:05:37.720 --> 02:05:40.840]   But I think that there's a human phenotype
[02:05:40.840 --> 02:05:42.360]   that I'm familiar with,
[02:05:42.360 --> 02:05:45.960]   where we feel other people's emotions,
[02:05:45.960 --> 02:05:48.960]   which I think is healthy, can be healthy.
[02:05:48.960 --> 02:05:53.960]   And we love seeing people enjoy and we delight in it.
[02:05:55.180 --> 02:05:58.900]   So it feels good to us to feed this addiction.
[02:05:58.900 --> 02:05:59.740]   - Oh, I know the feeling.
[02:05:59.740 --> 02:06:02.340]   - It's not like, it's like, oh, here I am, martyrdom,
[02:06:02.340 --> 02:06:04.620]   like I'm bleeding out, bleeding out, bleeding out.
[02:06:04.620 --> 02:06:07.140]   But it's not in line with this essential self.
[02:06:07.140 --> 02:06:10.020]   And here, I guess the little vignette that's related to this
[02:06:10.020 --> 02:06:13.260]   is that I do think there's one very healthy form of this,
[02:06:13.260 --> 02:06:17.260]   which is, I believe, at least for me, with a dog,
[02:06:17.260 --> 02:06:19.940]   I like other animals too, but with a dog,
[02:06:19.940 --> 02:06:24.940]   when we love them, we are seamlessly attached
[02:06:25.380 --> 02:06:27.140]   to their love of us.
[02:06:27.140 --> 02:06:29.420]   And so loving them and empathizing with them
[02:06:29.420 --> 02:06:30.820]   means like double the love.
[02:06:30.820 --> 02:06:32.820]   Like we love them and we can feel their love.
[02:06:32.820 --> 02:06:36.340]   And it's like a perfect, it just feels like a perfect circle.
[02:06:36.340 --> 02:06:40.060]   And with people, that can happen too, I imagine.
[02:06:40.060 --> 02:06:42.260]   I felt that a few times.
[02:06:42.260 --> 02:06:43.780]   I certainly feel that in my friendships.
[02:06:43.780 --> 02:06:45.140]   I feel that with my sister.
[02:06:45.140 --> 02:06:49.780]   And I've felt it in a few of my romantic relationships.
[02:06:49.780 --> 02:06:53.940]   But the empathy for the other's pleasure
[02:06:53.940 --> 02:06:55.740]   can go too far.
[02:06:55.740 --> 02:06:58.540]   And then when we, quote, unquote, lose ourselves,
[02:06:58.540 --> 02:07:00.740]   I think it's because there's a component of ourselves
[02:07:00.740 --> 02:07:02.540]   that's like not attached to the part
[02:07:02.540 --> 02:07:04.900]   that still has our own needs.
[02:07:04.900 --> 02:07:05.740]   Does that resonate?
[02:07:05.740 --> 02:07:06.740]   - Oh, totally, yeah.
[02:07:06.740 --> 02:07:07.700]   Here's the thing.
[02:07:07.700 --> 02:07:11.460]   You don't expect your dog to pretend it's not a dog.
[02:07:11.460 --> 02:07:15.820]   You don't expect your dog to stop loving walks
[02:07:15.820 --> 02:07:18.180]   and chasing a ball and just being a dog.
[02:07:18.180 --> 02:07:20.260]   And when it's tired, it'll go to sleep.
[02:07:20.260 --> 02:07:22.740]   But often when we fall in love,
[02:07:22.740 --> 02:07:26.060]   we try to make ourselves not who we are
[02:07:26.060 --> 02:07:28.500]   and try to become the person
[02:07:28.500 --> 02:07:32.740]   that will make the other maximally thrilled with us.
[02:07:32.740 --> 02:07:34.980]   And I know exactly what you're talking about.
[02:07:34.980 --> 02:07:39.140]   I have thrown, like, I love to give money to people.
[02:07:39.140 --> 02:07:40.700]   - Yeah, I do too. - 'Cause it makes them happy.
[02:07:40.700 --> 02:07:42.780]   And then it never works.
[02:07:42.780 --> 02:07:44.540]   Well, it works out only in cases
[02:07:44.540 --> 02:07:47.140]   where it feels true in my heart.
[02:07:47.140 --> 02:07:50.940]   If I overgive because someone's there saying, "I need,"
[02:07:50.940 --> 02:07:53.380]   and it doesn't feel good in the giving,
[02:07:53.380 --> 02:07:55.100]   I am not being a dog.
[02:07:55.100 --> 02:07:58.420]   A dog would say, "No, this is where my limits are.
[02:07:58.420 --> 02:08:00.580]   "I'm gonna go lie down on the floor and sleep.
[02:08:00.580 --> 02:08:03.740]   "But I will get an extra job to give money to people
[02:08:03.740 --> 02:08:05.260]   "that I don't wanna give money to
[02:08:05.260 --> 02:08:07.100]   "after the first little while."
[02:08:07.100 --> 02:08:11.180]   So we bend ourselves out of our true being.
[02:08:11.180 --> 02:08:13.620]   And I think the reason we love dogs so much
[02:08:13.620 --> 02:08:15.620]   is that they love, but they love truly.
[02:08:15.620 --> 02:08:16.740]   They love honestly.
[02:08:16.740 --> 02:08:19.140]   They don't pretend to be something they're not.
[02:08:20.260 --> 02:08:22.180]   And they don't have the empathy that says,
[02:08:22.180 --> 02:08:26.180]   "If your leg is broken, I will break my own leg
[02:08:26.180 --> 02:08:27.140]   "and lie down next to you
[02:08:27.140 --> 02:08:29.860]   "so that I feel exactly the same pain you're feeling."
[02:08:29.860 --> 02:08:33.980]   It is not empathy to feel everything
[02:08:33.980 --> 02:08:35.740]   the other person is feeling.
[02:08:35.740 --> 02:08:38.420]   If they then, take the broken leg example,
[02:08:38.420 --> 02:08:40.260]   if you got hit by a car,
[02:08:40.260 --> 02:08:41.780]   you're lying there screaming in anguish,
[02:08:41.780 --> 02:08:45.180]   and I felt your feelings so strongly that I couldn't cope,
[02:08:45.180 --> 02:08:47.500]   and I, you know, fell down in a faint.
[02:08:49.220 --> 02:08:51.700]   I had a client once who has passed away now,
[02:08:51.700 --> 02:08:53.780]   so I'll tell this anecdote.
[02:08:53.780 --> 02:08:56.980]   Her husband was like you.
[02:08:56.980 --> 02:08:58.660]   He would give himself away,
[02:08:58.660 --> 02:09:01.620]   and she gladly consumed all his life energy.
[02:09:01.620 --> 02:09:05.020]   And one day he had a heart attack,
[02:09:05.020 --> 02:09:07.060]   a near-fatal heart attack.
[02:09:07.060 --> 02:09:08.940]   And she called me and said,
[02:09:08.940 --> 02:09:12.380]   "I couldn't get him to take care of my needs
[02:09:12.380 --> 02:09:13.580]   "while he was having this heart attack.
[02:09:13.580 --> 02:09:15.340]   "He just had it."
[02:09:15.340 --> 02:09:18.060]   And I was like, "Yeah, he couldn't help that."
[02:09:18.060 --> 02:09:19.940]   And she said, "Well, I told him."
[02:09:19.940 --> 02:09:22.060]   He said, "I can't be there for you right now.
[02:09:22.060 --> 02:09:23.220]   "I'm having a heart attack."
[02:09:23.220 --> 02:09:24.820]   And she said, "You're not the one
[02:09:24.820 --> 02:09:27.700]   "whose husband may be dying from a heart attack."
[02:09:27.700 --> 02:09:31.940]   She was so into consuming his energy
[02:09:31.940 --> 02:09:35.700]   that she actually said that with a straight face.
[02:09:35.700 --> 02:09:36.900]   - Unbelievable.
[02:09:36.900 --> 02:09:38.860]   - She was expecting him to give empathy.
[02:09:38.860 --> 02:09:39.900]   That's not empathy.
[02:09:39.900 --> 02:09:41.900]   That's selling yourself out.
[02:09:41.900 --> 02:09:44.820]   Empathy acknowledges self-other awareness.
[02:09:44.820 --> 02:09:46.660]   There are four components to a real empathy.
[02:09:46.660 --> 02:09:49.100]   Self-other awareness, I am not you.
[02:09:49.100 --> 02:09:52.660]   As Byron Katie, one of my favorite spiritual teachers says,
[02:09:52.660 --> 02:09:54.740]   "My favorite thing about separate bodies
[02:09:54.740 --> 02:09:56.500]   "is that when you hurt, I don't.
[02:09:56.500 --> 02:09:58.700]   "It's not my turn."
[02:09:58.700 --> 02:10:01.500]   - So good, so good.
[02:10:01.500 --> 02:10:04.300]   - Yeah, another one is emotion regulation.
[02:10:04.300 --> 02:10:05.940]   So you see something that's horrific
[02:10:05.940 --> 02:10:09.500]   and you can like, this is where you can use your skills.
[02:10:09.500 --> 02:10:12.100]   Dealing with your emotions, you bring it down.
[02:10:12.100 --> 02:10:14.100]   Okay, I'm a surgeon.
[02:10:14.100 --> 02:10:16.620]   I'm dealing with a horrible ER accident.
[02:10:16.620 --> 02:10:18.020]   I can't feel that.
[02:10:18.020 --> 02:10:19.580]   I have to get to work.
[02:10:19.580 --> 02:10:20.860]   So that's emotion regulation.
[02:10:20.860 --> 02:10:21.780]   You can do that.
[02:10:21.780 --> 02:10:25.780]   Self-other awareness, emotion regulation.
[02:10:25.780 --> 02:10:28.620]   There are two other components,
[02:10:28.620 --> 02:10:31.500]   but those are the two that I think
[02:10:31.500 --> 02:10:33.860]   we really need to focus on.
[02:10:33.860 --> 02:10:34.900]   If you hurt, I don't.
[02:10:34.900 --> 02:10:36.620]   It's not my turn.
[02:10:36.620 --> 02:10:39.780]   And when you're hurting and I start to hurt too much
[02:10:39.780 --> 02:10:40.620]   because you're hurting,
[02:10:40.620 --> 02:10:44.060]   I can bring myself back into my own body, relax,
[02:10:44.060 --> 02:10:46.980]   and be contented in my own skin
[02:10:46.980 --> 02:10:49.860]   so that I can be present for you.
[02:10:49.860 --> 02:10:51.580]   So here's the thing I love.
[02:10:51.580 --> 02:10:55.060]   It's a short quote from a poem by Hafiz,
[02:10:55.060 --> 02:10:57.460]   who was a 13th century Persian poet.
[02:10:57.460 --> 02:10:58.780]   It's so simple.
[02:10:58.780 --> 02:11:00.540]   Remember it though.
[02:11:00.540 --> 02:11:04.420]   Troubled, then stay with me for I am not.
[02:11:04.420 --> 02:11:07.540]   - I love that.
[02:11:07.540 --> 02:11:11.180]   - Yeah, that's being yourself in a relationship.
[02:11:12.060 --> 02:11:14.620]   Then stay with me for I am not,
[02:11:14.620 --> 02:11:16.140]   but I'm really, really unhappy.
[02:11:16.140 --> 02:11:17.060]   I see that.
[02:11:17.060 --> 02:11:18.700]   And I'm not unhappy,
[02:11:18.700 --> 02:11:20.860]   but I really, really want to be together.
[02:11:20.860 --> 02:11:23.900]   I really see that that's how you feel.
[02:11:23.900 --> 02:11:25.020]   And I don't want it.
[02:11:25.020 --> 02:11:28.500]   - It's so interesting because I feel like
[02:11:28.500 --> 02:11:32.780]   in the domain of work and with my friends
[02:11:32.780 --> 02:11:34.620]   and largely with family,
[02:11:34.620 --> 02:11:38.020]   you know, like giving feels great.
[02:11:38.020 --> 02:11:40.660]   And then people are like sated.
[02:11:40.660 --> 02:11:42.300]   And then they go on their way.
[02:11:42.300 --> 02:11:45.940]   But I noticed a contrast with romantic partnerships
[02:11:45.940 --> 02:11:50.260]   when, as I said, I maintain good relationships
[02:11:50.260 --> 02:11:52.940]   with a couple of girlfriends that I had, you know,
[02:11:52.940 --> 02:11:54.620]   in some cases, I'm good friends with their husbands.
[02:11:54.620 --> 02:11:56.420]   Like they actually one just came and visited
[02:11:56.420 --> 02:11:57.940]   with her sister and her kid recently
[02:11:57.940 --> 02:12:00.500]   and like on just great platonic terms.
[02:12:00.500 --> 02:12:05.220]   But for years, I like, I didn't worry about them,
[02:12:05.220 --> 02:12:08.460]   but I felt like I could still feel the energetic pull
[02:12:08.460 --> 02:12:10.700]   even though they weren't asking for anything.
[02:12:10.700 --> 02:12:12.860]   And then when I attended their wedding,
[02:12:12.860 --> 02:12:14.460]   this particular person's wedding,
[02:12:14.460 --> 02:12:17.940]   I was like, oh, I was like, my work is done.
[02:12:17.940 --> 02:12:20.820]   And I got to enjoy and still get to enjoy the friendship
[02:12:20.820 --> 02:12:21.940]   with the whole family.
[02:12:21.940 --> 02:12:26.180]   But it really showed me how much the whole relation,
[02:12:26.180 --> 02:12:28.180]   so much of the relationship had been about
[02:12:28.180 --> 02:12:30.860]   like trying to make sure the other person was okay.
[02:12:30.860 --> 02:12:32.860]   - You make it your job to make them happy.
[02:12:32.860 --> 02:12:36.140]   And it is never your job to make another person happy.
[02:12:36.140 --> 02:12:39.180]   You can not do it.
[02:12:39.180 --> 02:12:42.000]   Happiness is an inside job.
[02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:44.740]   You cannot make another person happy.
[02:12:44.740 --> 02:12:47.900]   You can't be, you can't go far enough
[02:12:47.900 --> 02:12:50.860]   into someone else's sadness to make them happy.
[02:12:50.860 --> 02:12:52.500]   You can't go far enough into their sickness
[02:12:52.500 --> 02:12:53.940]   to make them well.
[02:12:53.940 --> 02:12:56.180]   You have to get out of your own sadness
[02:12:56.180 --> 02:13:00.180]   and your own sickness and then stay in your integrity
[02:13:00.180 --> 02:13:03.300]   with love for them and model what it is
[02:13:03.300 --> 02:13:05.500]   to be in your own skin.
[02:13:05.500 --> 02:13:08.100]   There's the only one you're ever gonna have.
[02:13:08.100 --> 02:13:11.420]   My oldest child as a teenager,
[02:13:11.420 --> 02:13:13.740]   I was so over-involved and everything.
[02:13:13.740 --> 02:13:18.740]   And they gave me a song called "Let Me Fall"
[02:13:18.740 --> 02:13:22.340]   by a man who had fallen from a tree
[02:13:22.340 --> 02:13:24.180]   and been, he broke his spine.
[02:13:24.180 --> 02:13:26.220]   He was a paraplegic.
[02:13:26.220 --> 02:13:30.460]   And he just says, "The one I will become will catch me.
[02:13:30.460 --> 02:13:32.420]   "Don't catch me anymore."
[02:13:33.580 --> 02:13:37.740]   And it was so hard as a parent to let my child have,
[02:13:37.740 --> 02:13:40.100]   suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune.
[02:13:40.100 --> 02:13:44.220]   And what they were telling me, they/them pronouns,
[02:13:44.220 --> 02:13:50.620]   was that this is my life and my suffering is my birthright.
[02:13:50.620 --> 02:13:53.180]   And I am here to figure it out as I go.
[02:13:53.180 --> 02:13:54.860]   And you are not loving me
[02:13:54.860 --> 02:13:57.460]   when you shove yourself into my affairs
[02:13:57.460 --> 02:13:59.940]   to try to take away my suffering.
[02:13:59.940 --> 02:14:01.460]   Let me fall.
[02:14:01.460 --> 02:14:05.300]   - What a mature and generous thing for them to say.
[02:14:05.300 --> 02:14:07.940]   - Yeah, they are, extraordinary.
[02:14:07.940 --> 02:14:09.220]   - It sounds like it.
[02:14:09.220 --> 02:14:10.940]   This is your oldest.
[02:14:10.940 --> 02:14:13.300]   The contrast, and I think what drives a lot of,
[02:14:13.300 --> 02:14:15.420]   what we're really talking about here is codependency.
[02:14:15.420 --> 02:14:16.260]   - Oh, yes.
[02:14:16.260 --> 02:14:18.460]   - Yeah, for those that don't know that.
[02:14:18.460 --> 02:14:19.300]   We haven't caught on.
[02:14:19.300 --> 02:14:20.260]   - Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
[02:14:20.260 --> 02:14:21.260]   - Right, exactly.
[02:14:21.260 --> 02:14:26.700]   Is that sometimes when we cut people off
[02:14:26.700 --> 02:14:29.780]   or we just say, "Hey, I can give, but only to this point."
[02:14:29.780 --> 02:14:31.740]   Or, "You can get this aspect of me,
[02:14:31.740 --> 02:14:33.580]   but not these other aspects."
[02:14:33.580 --> 02:14:36.300]   Especially if they've been receiving them before,
[02:14:36.300 --> 02:14:38.860]   they get pissed.
[02:14:38.860 --> 02:14:41.780]   I mean, this is, I mean, and it's unclear,
[02:14:41.780 --> 02:14:43.820]   especially if the relationship had been different
[02:14:43.820 --> 02:14:48.820]   up until then, that, you know, like,
[02:14:48.820 --> 02:14:51.580]   that's why it sometimes feels unfair to do.
[02:14:51.580 --> 02:14:53.460]   It's like, you know, it's one thing
[02:14:53.460 --> 02:14:55.860]   to invite someone over for a drink,
[02:14:55.860 --> 02:14:58.140]   then to discover that they're an alcoholic,
[02:14:58.140 --> 02:15:01.860]   continue to fill their glass, enjoy the exchange,
[02:15:01.860 --> 02:15:04.100]   and then one day realize they're an alcoholic.
[02:15:04.100 --> 02:15:04.940]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:15:04.940 --> 02:15:06.900]   - And I guess that term isn't used anymore.
[02:15:06.900 --> 02:15:08.700]   I've been told by many audience members,
[02:15:08.700 --> 02:15:10.980]   forgive me, it's alcohol use disorder.
[02:15:10.980 --> 02:15:12.620]   - I said that too, I'm sorry.
[02:15:12.620 --> 02:15:14.020]   - No, quite all right.
[02:15:14.020 --> 02:15:18.740]   I think that field of addiction medicine is nascent enough
[02:15:18.740 --> 02:15:20.300]   that we're still making the transition.
[02:15:20.300 --> 02:15:22.260]   And I don't say this, by the way, for political correctness.
[02:15:22.260 --> 02:15:23.780]   I'm not a politically correct person.
[02:15:23.780 --> 02:15:26.980]   It's just, I've had to learn to reframe these things
[02:15:26.980 --> 02:15:30.020]   for the specific purpose of trying to be more,
[02:15:30.020 --> 02:15:31.820]   to bring more people into the conversation.
[02:15:31.820 --> 02:15:36.380]   Also, I like the sound of, I don't like the idea,
[02:15:36.380 --> 02:15:38.860]   but the words alcohol use disorder,
[02:15:38.860 --> 02:15:40.940]   the disorder piece is also controversial.
[02:15:40.940 --> 02:15:43.540]   But what I love is that as soon as we start to name things
[02:15:43.540 --> 02:15:45.660]   and rename things, we're all talking about those things,
[02:15:45.660 --> 02:15:47.420]   and then there's no way out of the conversation.
[02:15:47.420 --> 02:15:51.500]   So that's my, like, kind of jujitsuing out of the,
[02:15:51.500 --> 02:15:52.880]   so that means we have to talk about it,
[02:15:52.880 --> 02:15:55.380]   just like autism spectrum disorder, or autism,
[02:15:55.380 --> 02:15:59.280]   or neurotypical, atypical, well, guess what, folks?
[02:15:59.280 --> 02:16:00.460]   Now we're all talking about it,
[02:16:00.460 --> 02:16:01.840]   and it needs to be talked about.
[02:16:01.840 --> 02:16:06.180]   So in any case, at some point, there's the idea,
[02:16:06.180 --> 02:16:07.500]   like, I'm cutting you off.
[02:16:07.500 --> 02:16:10.180]   And the person says, but this is what we do.
[02:16:10.180 --> 02:16:13.540]   This is the kind of promise that you made.
[02:16:13.540 --> 02:16:16.780]   And so then we find ourselves in like the other scripts
[02:16:16.780 --> 02:16:20.900]   of like, well, now I'm like being bad.
[02:16:20.900 --> 02:16:23.620]   I'm doing the right thing, but I'm breaking a promise,
[02:16:23.620 --> 02:16:25.780]   which we're told from like the time we're little,
[02:16:25.780 --> 02:16:26.860]   like you don't do.
[02:16:26.860 --> 02:16:29.240]   - But only in the eyes of the other person.
[02:16:29.240 --> 02:16:31.140]   If you come back into your own integrity,
[02:16:31.140 --> 02:16:35.180]   okay, did I promise to always give more than I can?
[02:16:35.180 --> 02:16:37.340]   Well, I did by my actions.
[02:16:37.340 --> 02:16:38.900]   I established a precedent.
[02:16:38.900 --> 02:16:39.860]   Isn't that a promise?
[02:16:39.860 --> 02:16:41.280]   They say it's a promise.
[02:16:41.280 --> 02:16:45.680]   No, or if I did make a promise, I was in error.
[02:16:45.680 --> 02:16:47.140]   I apologize, I made a mistake.
[02:16:47.140 --> 02:16:49.820]   I promised something I couldn't really give.
[02:16:49.820 --> 02:16:52.160]   Have you heard the term extinction burst?
[02:16:53.340 --> 02:16:56.740]   - In the notion of galaxies developing
[02:16:56.740 --> 02:16:58.700]   or something like that? - No, it's when pigeons are,
[02:16:58.700 --> 02:17:00.060]   well. - Awesome.
[02:17:00.060 --> 02:17:02.500]   I am way off. - The galactic pigeons.
[02:17:02.500 --> 02:17:04.140]   - I'm like trying to be Elon Musk here,
[02:17:04.140 --> 02:17:07.060]   and you're telling me, no, it's about pigeons, cool.
[02:17:07.060 --> 02:17:09.340]   - It's about any animal. - I love pigeons.
[02:17:09.340 --> 02:17:11.100]   I even have a pigeon tattoo.
[02:17:11.100 --> 02:17:14.260]   Yeah, I do. - I love all the animals.
[02:17:14.260 --> 02:17:18.780]   Anyway, if you give pigeons, they peck a lever
[02:17:18.780 --> 02:17:22.340]   and they get a pellet at unpredictable intervals,
[02:17:22.340 --> 02:17:24.140]   which is highly motivating.
[02:17:24.140 --> 02:17:26.840]   It's the most highly motivating thing they can do.
[02:17:26.840 --> 02:17:30.100]   So, and then if the pellets stop coming,
[02:17:30.100 --> 02:17:31.740]   the pigeons go bananas.
[02:17:31.740 --> 02:17:33.260]   - They perseverate. - Peck, peck, peck, peck,
[02:17:33.260 --> 02:17:34.760]   peck, peck, peck, peck, peck.
[02:17:34.760 --> 02:17:36.060]   They peck it a lot more.
[02:17:36.060 --> 02:17:38.580]   They peck it angrily.
[02:17:38.580 --> 02:17:42.740]   They insist that the researchers promise them those pellets.
[02:17:42.740 --> 02:17:45.380]   And then they just give up and go away
[02:17:45.380 --> 02:17:47.460]   'cause the pellets stop coming.
[02:17:47.460 --> 02:17:51.080]   When you have been giving too much and you realize that,
[02:17:51.080 --> 02:17:52.460]   and you say to stay in my integrity,
[02:17:52.460 --> 02:17:54.180]   I have to pull back and care for myself,
[02:17:54.180 --> 02:17:55.420]   and that's where I stop.
[02:17:55.420 --> 02:18:01.020]   The other person will put on an extinction burst, for sure.
[02:18:01.020 --> 02:18:03.780]   And your job is to stay inside your integrity
[02:18:03.780 --> 02:18:06.060]   until they stop pecking.
[02:18:06.060 --> 02:18:07.920]   And they'll be much more healthy.
[02:18:07.920 --> 02:18:09.420]   I had a golden retriever once
[02:18:09.420 --> 02:18:11.060]   who would just come and bark to be petted.
[02:18:11.060 --> 02:18:12.100]   (imitates barking)
[02:18:12.100 --> 02:18:15.700]   Big, huge dog, but he was young.
[02:18:15.700 --> 02:18:17.900]   And it was so annoying.
[02:18:17.900 --> 02:18:20.660]   And we had to get a dog behaviorist to come in
[02:18:20.660 --> 02:18:23.100]   because he was just barking at everybody constantly
[02:18:23.100 --> 02:18:23.940]   to be petted.
[02:18:23.940 --> 02:18:26.540]   And she said, "When he does that, get up,
[02:18:26.540 --> 02:18:28.260]   walk across the room, go into another room,
[02:18:28.260 --> 02:18:29.740]   and shut the door in his face."
[02:18:29.740 --> 02:18:33.100]   And we were like, "Oh, that would be cruel."
[02:18:33.100 --> 02:18:34.140]   She's like, "It's not cruel.
[02:18:34.140 --> 02:18:35.780]   He'll understand it."
[02:18:35.780 --> 02:18:37.380]   And I'll never forget watching him bark.
[02:18:37.380 --> 02:18:38.740]   It's like, "Rawr, rawr, rawr."
[02:18:38.740 --> 02:18:41.780]   And they got up, walked out, shut the door in his face.
[02:18:41.780 --> 02:18:44.260]   He stood by the door and went, "Rawr."
[02:18:44.260 --> 02:18:45.740]   Then he went, "Meh."
[02:18:45.740 --> 02:18:46.820]   He went over and laid down.
[02:18:46.820 --> 02:18:48.740]   He was like, "All right, well, that didn't work."
[02:18:48.740 --> 02:18:51.340]   And you know, that's ultimately what happens
[02:18:51.340 --> 02:18:52.920]   when you stay inside your integrity
[02:18:52.920 --> 02:18:55.500]   and don't let people play with you that way.
[02:18:55.500 --> 02:18:57.660]   Don't let them tug you around.
[02:18:57.660 --> 02:18:58.620]   - Yeah.
[02:18:58.620 --> 02:19:01.380]   Yeah, it's interesting because with work,
[02:19:01.380 --> 02:19:04.520]   it's like, I love learning, organizing information,
[02:19:04.520 --> 02:19:05.820]   having conversations like this,
[02:19:05.820 --> 02:19:06.860]   and sharing them with the world.
[02:19:06.860 --> 02:19:09.780]   It feels kind of like the relationship to a dog.
[02:19:09.780 --> 02:19:11.380]   It's like this reciprocity.
[02:19:11.380 --> 02:19:13.820]   And if people don't like it, okay.
[02:19:13.820 --> 02:19:14.940]   And if you like it, great.
[02:19:14.940 --> 02:19:16.060]   And if you love it, even better.
[02:19:16.060 --> 02:19:17.820]   But I would be doing it anyway.
[02:19:17.820 --> 02:19:19.180]   That's like, I'd be doing it anyway.
[02:19:19.180 --> 02:19:23.020]   Like there's no feeling of loss.
[02:19:23.020 --> 02:19:26.300]   There's no metabolizing of self, any of that.
[02:19:26.300 --> 02:19:27.140]   - Yeah, I know.
[02:19:27.140 --> 02:19:28.860]   And I call it what I,
[02:19:28.860 --> 02:19:31.540]   in the book that I just wrote called "Beyond Anxiety,"
[02:19:31.540 --> 02:19:34.540]   I talk about when people like you live that way
[02:19:34.540 --> 02:19:39.540]   from their joy, they begin to create economic ecosystems.
[02:19:39.540 --> 02:19:43.140]   You create so much value that in multiple ways,
[02:19:43.140 --> 02:19:48.140]   people start to, you can get streams of income.
[02:19:48.140 --> 02:19:49.740]   - And people pay me to do this.
[02:19:49.740 --> 02:19:50.700]   And I still can't believe it.
[02:19:50.700 --> 02:19:52.660]   I come in here and I talk to my producer
[02:19:52.660 --> 02:19:55.380]   who's also my business partner and my closest friend, Rob.
[02:19:55.380 --> 02:19:58.060]   And I'm like, I can't believe they pay us to do this.
[02:19:58.060 --> 02:19:58.900]   - I know.
[02:19:58.900 --> 02:19:59.720]   - I can't believe it.
[02:19:59.720 --> 02:20:00.980]   And that's also how I felt about science
[02:20:00.980 --> 02:20:02.580]   the first time I looked down the microscope
[02:20:02.580 --> 02:20:05.120]   and saw a slice of a particular brain area
[02:20:05.120 --> 02:20:06.940]   called the dorsolateral geniculate nucleus.
[02:20:06.940 --> 02:20:07.900]   And we had labeled this around.
[02:20:07.900 --> 02:20:10.120]   I turned to Barbara Chapman, my graduate advisor there,
[02:20:10.120 --> 02:20:12.720]   and I was like, this is amazing.
[02:20:12.720 --> 02:20:14.100]   And her response was so funny.
[02:20:14.100 --> 02:20:17.420]   She was also Harvard trained Radcliffe to be specific.
[02:20:17.420 --> 02:20:19.460]   And she said, "Yeah, brains are really cool.
[02:20:19.460 --> 02:20:21.520]   "They're kind of like little walnuts."
[02:20:21.520 --> 02:20:22.340]   (laughing)
[02:20:22.340 --> 02:20:24.020]   And I was like, so Barbara,
[02:20:24.020 --> 02:20:25.140]   the smartest people I ever met.
[02:20:25.140 --> 02:20:28.080]   She was just like, and I was like, and I thought,
[02:20:28.080 --> 02:20:29.300]   and then I looked around her lab.
[02:20:29.300 --> 02:20:31.860]   I was doing rotations where you get to sample different labs
[02:20:31.860 --> 02:20:33.460]   and you hope they'll take you.
[02:20:33.460 --> 02:20:35.460]   And she had green counters in her lab
[02:20:35.460 --> 02:20:36.660]   instead of black counters.
[02:20:36.660 --> 02:20:37.500]   - Oh, cool.
[02:20:37.500 --> 02:20:41.300]   - And she had pictures of mushrooms.
[02:20:41.300 --> 02:20:43.520]   And she had this picture of a cat
[02:20:43.520 --> 02:20:45.680]   coming out of a farm silo.
[02:20:45.680 --> 02:20:46.520]   It's like its hat.
[02:20:46.520 --> 02:20:48.820]   And I thought, I really like this lady.
[02:20:48.820 --> 02:20:49.660]   - Oh, that's awesome.
[02:20:49.660 --> 02:20:50.480]   - Like, I want to work here.
[02:20:50.480 --> 02:20:52.080]   I'm going to do my PhD here.
[02:20:52.080 --> 02:20:55.440]   And I had already committed to another lab.
[02:20:55.440 --> 02:20:58.440]   And I started sneaking into her laboratory at night
[02:20:58.440 --> 02:20:59.280]   to do experiments.
[02:20:59.280 --> 02:21:00.680]   - Did you break the heart of the other lab?
[02:21:00.680 --> 02:21:01.720]   - She got over it.
[02:21:01.720 --> 02:21:03.080]   So in the professional domain,
[02:21:03.080 --> 02:21:04.760]   I'm a completely different animal
[02:21:04.760 --> 02:21:05.680]   when it comes to these things.
[02:21:05.680 --> 02:21:07.680]   I walked into the other woman's lab.
[02:21:07.680 --> 02:21:09.240]   I mean, she's done tremendously well without me.
[02:21:09.240 --> 02:21:11.940]   So I just said, "Listen, I'm going to join this other lab."
[02:21:11.940 --> 02:21:16.580]   But I have no trouble doing that in the work domain, none.
[02:21:16.580 --> 02:21:18.480]   It's like, when I started the podcast,
[02:21:18.480 --> 02:21:19.980]   sure there were these voices in my head
[02:21:19.980 --> 02:21:21.860]   where my colleagues going to think this and that.
[02:21:21.860 --> 02:21:25.020]   And I was like, "Nah, I hope they're living their best life.
[02:21:25.020 --> 02:21:25.860]   I'm going to live mine."
[02:21:25.860 --> 02:21:26.700]   - Yeah.
[02:21:26.700 --> 02:21:28.580]   - And I see them and some love it, some hate it.
[02:21:28.580 --> 02:21:30.620]   And some, like really, I can tell,
[02:21:30.620 --> 02:21:32.820]   like I hear the judgments and I also hear the,
[02:21:32.820 --> 02:21:34.420]   like, I love it, that kind of thing.
[02:21:34.420 --> 02:21:37.620]   It's a mix because public facing anything
[02:21:37.620 --> 02:21:39.940]   is going to evoke different responses from people.
[02:21:39.940 --> 02:21:42.940]   And, but I'm sort of like, "You do you, I'll do me,
[02:21:42.940 --> 02:21:44.740]   and we'll both be good."
[02:21:44.740 --> 02:21:46.220]   - We live in this weird economy
[02:21:46.220 --> 02:21:48.080]   where you're supposed to get a job
[02:21:48.080 --> 02:21:50.300]   and it's all based on factory work.
[02:21:50.300 --> 02:21:51.640]   You're supposed to go to a place
[02:21:51.640 --> 02:21:53.340]   and do something you don't really like
[02:21:53.340 --> 02:21:56.100]   to get your little allowance and then you go home.
[02:21:56.100 --> 02:21:58.500]   And that has only existed for the last couple of hundred
[02:21:58.500 --> 02:22:00.220]   years since the industrial revolution.
[02:22:00.220 --> 02:22:03.460]   Before that, people existed for hundreds of thousands
[02:22:03.460 --> 02:22:04.780]   of years doing what?
[02:22:04.780 --> 02:22:06.940]   Hunting, fishing, gardening, weaving,
[02:22:06.940 --> 02:22:10.220]   singing songs, telling stories,
[02:22:10.220 --> 02:22:13.660]   doing the things that we do as hobbies.
[02:22:13.660 --> 02:22:15.960]   But we have this weird mindset that says,
[02:22:15.960 --> 02:22:20.740]   "No, if I do things that bring me joy, like a hobby does,
[02:22:20.740 --> 02:22:22.660]   the things that people have been doing
[02:22:22.660 --> 02:22:23.980]   for hundreds of thousands of years,
[02:22:23.980 --> 02:22:27.540]   if I just put my joy out there and see what I can do
[02:22:27.540 --> 02:22:30.400]   with the wild new creations of our particular time,
[02:22:30.400 --> 02:22:33.820]   if I don't do the job, I'm being weird somehow
[02:22:33.820 --> 02:22:35.660]   and it won't work."
[02:22:35.660 --> 02:22:38.060]   But what I'm seeing is the economic structures
[02:22:38.060 --> 02:22:40.140]   of this society are all being fractured.
[02:22:40.140 --> 02:22:42.260]   They're falling apart around us.
[02:22:42.260 --> 02:22:44.900]   And it's people who are afraid.
[02:22:44.900 --> 02:22:48.100]   I used to watch this video of a tsunami
[02:22:48.100 --> 02:22:51.940]   that hit Sendai, Japan in 2011, I think it was.
[02:22:51.940 --> 02:22:56.100]   And this wave comes in and it eats a city in six minutes,
[02:22:56.100 --> 02:22:57.100]   this one wave.
[02:22:57.100 --> 02:23:00.940]   And you watch the whole city be ripped to shreds
[02:23:00.940 --> 02:23:01.780]   in six minutes.
[02:23:01.780 --> 02:23:04.340]   And people are running into the buildings
[02:23:04.340 --> 02:23:07.060]   and then the buildings start to collapse
[02:23:07.060 --> 02:23:08.820]   and you know there are people in there.
[02:23:08.820 --> 02:23:11.420]   And I watched this and I thought
[02:23:11.420 --> 02:23:13.220]   there is so much change in our culture.
[02:23:13.220 --> 02:23:15.020]   It's like that wave has hit us.
[02:23:15.020 --> 02:23:19.080]   And then accidentally I hit something in YouTube or whatever
[02:23:19.080 --> 02:23:23.100]   and it switched to Mike Parsons surfing,
[02:23:23.100 --> 02:23:25.420]   one of the biggest waves ever filmed.
[02:23:25.420 --> 02:23:28.500]   It was a rogue wave and it went up like 70 feet.
[02:23:28.500 --> 02:23:32.380]   And the camera pulls back and here's this man,
[02:23:32.380 --> 02:23:34.820]   a naked, basically naked man on a board
[02:23:34.820 --> 02:23:39.100]   with a wave that is like the wrath of God.
[02:23:39.100 --> 02:23:41.260]   And he's this tiny little figure.
[02:23:41.260 --> 02:23:43.660]   The wave is seven stories tall.
[02:23:43.660 --> 02:23:45.620]   And he comes riding down the face of that
[02:23:45.620 --> 02:23:48.740]   and it breaks over him and you think, "Oh, he's dead."
[02:23:48.740 --> 02:23:52.540]   And then he shoots out of the spray, just like shouting.
[02:23:52.540 --> 02:23:55.120]   And I thought those are the choices we have right now.
[02:23:55.120 --> 02:23:56.900]   We can run into the institutions
[02:23:56.900 --> 02:23:58.660]   that we think will keep us safe
[02:23:58.660 --> 02:24:02.160]   and change will crush us and drown us and kill us.
[02:24:02.160 --> 02:24:04.880]   Or we can deal with the fact
[02:24:04.880 --> 02:24:08.380]   that there's a huge wave of change in our society right now
[02:24:08.380 --> 02:24:11.300]   and everything's changing at an accelerating rate.
[02:24:11.300 --> 02:24:16.300]   And we can risk running out naked and just with our joy
[02:24:16.300 --> 02:24:18.900]   and just balance on our joy
[02:24:18.900 --> 02:24:21.620]   and let the wave take us for a ride.
[02:24:21.620 --> 02:24:22.720]   You're surfing.
[02:24:24.460 --> 02:24:27.340]   You are an example to the world of someone
[02:24:27.340 --> 02:24:30.900]   who is balanced in his joy, except in relationships,
[02:24:30.900 --> 02:24:32.260]   but you'll get over that.
[02:24:32.260 --> 02:24:33.940]   Anyway- - It's taking some work.
[02:24:33.940 --> 02:24:34.940]   It's taking some work.
[02:24:34.940 --> 02:24:37.460]   - There's a woman hanging onto the end of your surfboard.
[02:24:37.460 --> 02:24:38.300]   It's not gonna-
[02:24:38.300 --> 02:24:40.940]   - Unfortunately, it's a lot more complicated than that.
[02:24:40.940 --> 02:24:44.340]   But I am seeing a portal toward,
[02:24:44.340 --> 02:24:47.220]   I guess what you're calling true integrity,
[02:24:47.220 --> 02:24:49.380]   where in the back of my mind,
[02:24:49.900 --> 02:24:54.500]   I have this very vestigial understanding
[02:24:54.500 --> 02:24:57.040]   of what all of that relationship stuff
[02:24:57.040 --> 02:25:01.040]   actually looks like and feels like when it's right for me.
[02:25:01.040 --> 02:25:03.860]   I just, I think it's not gonna look like
[02:25:03.860 --> 02:25:06.300]   the way I try to script it out.
[02:25:06.300 --> 02:25:08.660]   - Do an ideal day with that relationship
[02:25:08.660 --> 02:25:12.020]   and it could be the weirdest thing you've ever heard of.
[02:25:12.020 --> 02:25:13.900]   It will work.
[02:25:13.900 --> 02:25:14.740]   I promise you.
[02:25:14.740 --> 02:25:17.340]   I have a very weird relationship life.
[02:25:17.340 --> 02:25:18.380]   - That's reassuring to me.
[02:25:18.380 --> 02:25:20.420]   I can't believe I'm gonna say this on this podcast.
[02:25:20.420 --> 02:25:21.620]   So I have two partners.
[02:25:21.620 --> 02:25:22.700]   - Your partner is awesome.
[02:25:22.700 --> 02:25:25.180]   Oh, I met, well, I just met one of them.
[02:25:25.180 --> 02:25:27.300]   - One was the very first relationship
[02:25:27.300 --> 02:25:28.380]   I ever had with a woman.
[02:25:28.380 --> 02:25:30.980]   That was 20 some years ago.
[02:25:30.980 --> 02:25:34.500]   And then I was living on my ranch and meditating all day.
[02:25:34.500 --> 02:25:37.500]   And my partner, Karen, came to me
[02:25:37.500 --> 02:25:40.940]   and this Australian poet, Rowan,
[02:25:40.940 --> 02:25:44.420]   was staying on our ranch with some other people.
[02:25:44.420 --> 02:25:45.540]   And Karen sat me down.
[02:25:45.540 --> 02:25:48.900]   She said, "Marty, I have to tell you,
[02:25:48.900 --> 02:25:50.860]   I'm having very strong, I don't know,
[02:25:50.860 --> 02:25:53.580]   maybe maternal feelings toward Rowan."
[02:25:53.580 --> 02:25:55.020]   I was like, "No, they're not maternal.
[02:25:55.020 --> 02:25:57.220]   I'm not getting a maternal energy."
[02:25:57.220 --> 02:26:01.700]   And I got hit by this blast of joy, joy, joy.
[02:26:01.700 --> 02:26:03.140]   It was like that white light thing.
[02:26:03.140 --> 02:26:06.020]   It was like, and I said, "You're in love with her.
[02:26:06.020 --> 02:26:07.700]   This is amazing.
[02:26:07.700 --> 02:26:09.380]   Tell her to come in.
[02:26:09.380 --> 02:26:10.900]   I'll go to the guest room.
[02:26:10.900 --> 02:26:11.820]   You guys can have the..."
[02:26:11.820 --> 02:26:14.860]   I was just like, happy, happy, happy.
[02:26:14.860 --> 02:26:17.180]   And I looked for jealousy and I looked for,
[02:26:17.180 --> 02:26:19.860]   I was like, "This isn't supposed to work this way."
[02:26:19.860 --> 02:26:23.220]   So Rowan came up and we all sat around talking
[02:26:23.220 --> 02:26:26.180]   and we sat around talking a lot more.
[02:26:26.180 --> 02:26:27.940]   And we all sat on the same couch talking,
[02:26:27.940 --> 02:26:29.780]   going, "This isn't weird, is it?"
[02:26:29.780 --> 02:26:31.700]   And after a couple of weeks,
[02:26:31.700 --> 02:26:34.220]   we realized everybody was in love with everybody
[02:26:34.220 --> 02:26:36.420]   and we couldn't live without each other.
[02:26:36.420 --> 02:26:37.420]   - And so that's how you-
[02:26:37.420 --> 02:26:39.260]   - That was eight years ago.
[02:26:39.260 --> 02:26:43.620]   And we have a three-year-old named Lila, who's delightful.
[02:26:43.620 --> 02:26:44.460]   - Awesome.
[02:26:44.460 --> 02:26:49.460]   - And it is, we call it feeling good by looking weird.
[02:26:49.460 --> 02:26:53.340]   And you can cut it out on the podcast if it's too-
[02:26:53.340 --> 02:26:57.020]   - No, we have no master, no overlord.
[02:26:57.020 --> 02:26:57.860]   Are you kidding me?
[02:26:57.860 --> 02:27:00.420]   I mean, what we're talking about here is love,
[02:27:00.420 --> 02:27:01.900]   first of all.
[02:27:01.900 --> 02:27:03.180]   I mean, let's just be,
[02:27:03.180 --> 02:27:05.980]   of all the things to cut out of a podcast,
[02:27:05.980 --> 02:27:08.980]   we're not gonna cut love out of a podcast.
[02:27:08.980 --> 02:27:10.940]   - Oh, I love that about this podcast
[02:27:10.940 --> 02:27:12.500]   'cause a lot of people would.
[02:27:12.500 --> 02:27:14.640]   - Yeah, well, not me.
[02:27:14.640 --> 02:27:18.980]   And for people that bulk at that
[02:27:18.980 --> 02:27:20.900]   or it creates internal friction in them,
[02:27:20.900 --> 02:27:23.180]   then I just invite you to, I don't know,
[02:27:23.180 --> 02:27:25.500]   visit your compassionate witness self,
[02:27:25.500 --> 02:27:26.340]   see if it's still there.
[02:27:26.340 --> 02:27:28.020]   And if it's still there, then,
[02:27:28.020 --> 02:27:31.280]   hey, I actually believe that humans,
[02:27:31.280 --> 02:27:35.320]   partially based on developmental wiring experiences,
[02:27:35.320 --> 02:27:38.060]   but also just differences in wiring,
[02:27:38.060 --> 02:27:41.380]   I could just fundamentally believe in this.
[02:27:41.380 --> 02:27:44.260]   I mean, one of my closest friends,
[02:27:44.260 --> 02:27:46.380]   my third postdoc, my third advisor,
[02:27:46.380 --> 02:27:48.260]   who was my postdoc advisor at Stanford is the,
[02:27:48.260 --> 02:27:50.340]   now, unfortunately, he died of pancreatic cancer,
[02:27:50.340 --> 02:27:51.420]   is the late Ben Barris.
[02:27:51.420 --> 02:27:55.060]   He was born an identical twin girl.
[02:27:55.060 --> 02:27:55.900]   - Wow.
[02:27:55.900 --> 02:27:58.420]   - Okay, then went up through medical school,
[02:27:58.420 --> 02:28:01.500]   living as a woman, graduate school as a woman,
[02:28:01.500 --> 02:28:06.500]   and then transitioned to Ben pretty late in life.
[02:28:06.500 --> 02:28:08.780]   So I only met Ben.
[02:28:08.780 --> 02:28:09.620]   Ben was a close friend
[02:28:09.620 --> 02:28:11.420]   and then unfortunately had,
[02:28:11.420 --> 02:28:14.260]   probably because he had the BRCA2 mutation,
[02:28:14.260 --> 02:28:16.020]   died of multiple cancers,
[02:28:16.020 --> 02:28:18.580]   but that initiated by pancreatic cancer.
[02:28:18.580 --> 02:28:19.820]   First transgender member
[02:28:19.820 --> 02:28:21.180]   of the National Academy of Sciences.
[02:28:21.180 --> 02:28:22.180]   - Wow.
[02:28:22.180 --> 02:28:24.540]   - I wrote his obituary for the journal "Nature."
[02:28:24.540 --> 02:28:26.220]   We were very, very close.
[02:28:26.220 --> 02:28:30.600]   And just an amazing, very quirky dude, you know?
[02:28:30.600 --> 02:28:33.860]   And didn't have a romantic partner,
[02:28:33.860 --> 02:28:36.500]   at least not at the time when he passed
[02:28:36.500 --> 02:28:38.900]   or in the time that I knew him, to my knowledge.
[02:28:39.660 --> 02:28:42.260]   And, you know, Ben used to say,
[02:28:42.260 --> 02:28:46.260]   like there are components of our wiring that are ubiquitous,
[02:28:46.260 --> 02:28:47.860]   the parts that control breathing,
[02:28:47.860 --> 02:28:49.260]   you know, the parts that control heart.
[02:28:49.260 --> 02:28:52.160]   And then there are parts of our wiring
[02:28:52.160 --> 02:28:53.540]   that are just different.
[02:28:53.540 --> 02:28:56.340]   And to me as a scientist, like it makes perfect sense.
[02:28:56.340 --> 02:28:58.780]   Like the notion that any of that would be controversial
[02:28:58.780 --> 02:28:59.820]   is like, what?
[02:28:59.820 --> 02:29:01.660]   Like it doesn't make any sense whatsoever
[02:29:01.660 --> 02:29:03.940]   that one would like not believe
[02:29:03.940 --> 02:29:05.260]   that people have differences in wiring
[02:29:05.260 --> 02:29:07.500]   because most people want to believe in differences
[02:29:07.500 --> 02:29:10.660]   in wiring when it's like convenient for themselves.
[02:29:10.660 --> 02:29:12.820]   So I really appreciate that you're sharing this
[02:29:12.820 --> 02:29:16.100]   and because yeah, every which version works.
[02:29:16.100 --> 02:29:18.140]   And I also learned from my graduate advisor,
[02:29:18.140 --> 02:29:19.780]   Barbara Chapman, she used to say,
[02:29:19.780 --> 02:29:21.820]   "Tolerance has to go both ways."
[02:29:21.820 --> 02:29:24.520]   So I also like love and applaud
[02:29:24.520 --> 02:29:26.700]   like the whatever traditional nuclear families
[02:29:26.700 --> 02:29:28.060]   that still called that.
[02:29:28.060 --> 02:29:30.120]   - Oh my gosh, yes.
[02:29:30.120 --> 02:29:32.920]   But I would love you to really sit down,
[02:29:32.920 --> 02:29:35.060]   get incredibly authentic with yourself and say,
[02:29:35.060 --> 02:29:39.380]   "Honestly, if I had the perfect romantic life,
[02:29:39.380 --> 02:29:40.380]   "what would it look like?"
[02:29:40.380 --> 02:29:43.620]   And be what you will call very selfish,
[02:29:43.620 --> 02:29:45.960]   what I will call very much in your integrity.
[02:29:45.960 --> 02:29:49.580]   Don't tell yourself any lies about what you really want.
[02:29:49.580 --> 02:29:54.660]   Yeah, it's very strange, but both Karen and I felt like
[02:29:54.660 --> 02:29:58.820]   there was a tremendous absence in a couple of years
[02:29:58.820 --> 02:30:01.700]   before Ro came into our life.
[02:30:01.700 --> 02:30:04.580]   And we're just, it's like we're a three-legged stool,
[02:30:04.580 --> 02:30:07.500]   two-legged stools do not make sense to us, they fall down.
[02:30:07.500 --> 02:30:14.140]   Whatever comes into your vision of joy,
[02:30:14.140 --> 02:30:17.020]   whatever makes you feel free,
[02:30:17.020 --> 02:30:21.700]   write it down and read it often.
[02:30:21.700 --> 02:30:23.260]   And when you get into a relationship,
[02:30:23.260 --> 02:30:24.900]   read it even more often.
[02:30:24.900 --> 02:30:25.740]   - Maybe have the other person read it.
[02:30:25.740 --> 02:30:27.860]   - And let the other person read it.
[02:30:27.860 --> 02:30:30.140]   - Totally, that would be, that I can do.
[02:30:30.140 --> 02:30:32.600]   As difficult as it is to have certain conversations,
[02:30:32.600 --> 02:30:33.820]   I could certainly write things down
[02:30:33.820 --> 02:30:34.660]   and just like slide it down.
[02:30:34.660 --> 02:30:37.220]   - It's like a pre-nup, here's what I'm after,
[02:30:37.220 --> 02:30:41.000]   don't let me do the things in column B, it won't end well.
[02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:43.020]   - I love it.
[02:30:43.020 --> 02:30:44.540]   And I really appreciate that you shared that.
[02:30:44.540 --> 02:30:46.940]   And I know people listening will as well.
[02:30:46.940 --> 02:30:47.780]   - I hope so.
[02:30:47.780 --> 02:30:50.420]   And if not, I read a book by Samantha Irby,
[02:30:50.420 --> 02:30:51.620]   a wonderful comedian.
[02:30:51.620 --> 02:30:53.020]   And she says, here's what you say
[02:30:53.020 --> 02:30:54.860]   when people tell you that you're horrible
[02:30:54.860 --> 02:30:56.700]   and you're doing something awful.
[02:30:56.700 --> 02:30:59.820]   You say, I like it.
[02:30:59.820 --> 02:31:00.660]   - Nice.
[02:31:02.380 --> 02:31:04.740]   One of the reasons I oriented very young towards
[02:31:04.740 --> 02:31:06.520]   and still love punk rock music,
[02:31:06.520 --> 02:31:10.540]   like that genre is because to me, I could be wrong,
[02:31:10.540 --> 02:31:12.460]   maybe classical music being an exception,
[02:31:12.460 --> 02:31:15.180]   but to me, it's the only genre of music
[02:31:15.180 --> 02:31:19.580]   where all the versions of self and emotions are welcome.
[02:31:19.580 --> 02:31:22.920]   There's angry music, there's like political music,
[02:31:22.920 --> 02:31:27.920]   there's sad music, there's music about friendship
[02:31:27.920 --> 02:31:29.980]   and camaraderie about loss.
[02:31:29.980 --> 02:31:31.860]   And you look at the community,
[02:31:31.860 --> 02:31:33.580]   like I'm really into this stuff.
[02:31:33.580 --> 02:31:36.340]   So look at the community that my good friend,
[02:31:36.340 --> 02:31:39.540]   Tim Armstrong has created around certain bands.
[02:31:39.540 --> 02:31:41.100]   He's gonna be on the Mount Rushmore of punk rock
[02:31:41.100 --> 02:31:42.860]   or the great Joe Strummer from The Clash.
[02:31:42.860 --> 02:31:46.300]   Political music, you know, or Laura Jane Grace,
[02:31:46.300 --> 02:31:48.460]   like one of the first transgendered,
[02:31:48.460 --> 02:31:51.020]   like outwardly facing transgendered people
[02:31:51.020 --> 02:31:54.260]   in the punk rock community and does amazing music.
[02:31:54.260 --> 02:31:55.420]   Well, it was against me.
[02:31:55.420 --> 02:31:57.880]   And then Laura Jane Grace, I'm like, she's a hero of mine.
[02:31:57.880 --> 02:31:58.860]   One of my shortlist of heroes.
[02:31:58.860 --> 02:32:03.860]   I love, love, love what she's done at so many levels.
[02:32:03.860 --> 02:32:07.340]   And it's like, there's like this tapestry
[02:32:07.340 --> 02:32:09.980]   of all the different humans and human experiences
[02:32:09.980 --> 02:32:12.580]   in a kind of single genre.
[02:32:12.580 --> 02:32:14.820]   And I don't know much about other genres of music,
[02:32:14.820 --> 02:32:16.620]   but I don't see that.
[02:32:16.620 --> 02:32:17.460]   I don't see that,
[02:32:17.460 --> 02:32:19.980]   like maybe across the totality of rock and roll or whatever.
[02:32:19.980 --> 02:32:21.740]   But, you know, and so like,
[02:32:21.740 --> 02:32:24.100]   if ever there was a sector of life
[02:32:24.100 --> 02:32:27.260]   that's like all inclusive, it's that.
[02:32:27.260 --> 02:32:30.180]   But not because it's loud, it's fast, and it's anti.
[02:32:30.180 --> 02:32:32.940]   It's like, so much of it is like pro-social, right?
[02:32:32.940 --> 02:32:33.780]   You know? - Yeah.
[02:32:33.780 --> 02:32:35.680]   - So I think there's a big misunderstanding around that.
[02:32:35.680 --> 02:32:38.580]   So that ethos is something that's always resonated.
[02:32:38.580 --> 02:32:42.300]   And I feel the same way about like relationships.
[02:32:42.300 --> 02:32:43.260]   We're on social media.
[02:32:43.260 --> 02:32:45.140]   One of the reasons I can go on social media
[02:32:45.140 --> 02:32:48.220]   and not have it like spike my cortisol constantly
[02:32:48.220 --> 02:32:49.140]   is I'm there and I'm like, okay,
[02:32:49.140 --> 02:32:50.740]   there's some like mentally healthy people here,
[02:32:50.740 --> 02:32:52.520]   some mentally unhealthy people here.
[02:32:52.520 --> 02:32:53.700]   People are here to fight.
[02:32:53.700 --> 02:32:54.660]   People are here to love.
[02:32:54.660 --> 02:32:55.980]   People are here to find partners.
[02:32:55.980 --> 02:32:57.140]   People are here to flirt.
[02:32:57.140 --> 02:32:58.460]   People are, and you know what?
[02:32:58.460 --> 02:32:59.700]   People are here to attack me.
[02:32:59.700 --> 02:33:01.820]   Like, cool, I'm glad I'm giving you a purpose
[02:33:01.820 --> 02:33:02.660]   for your morning.
[02:33:02.660 --> 02:33:03.500]   You know, that kind of thing.
[02:33:03.500 --> 02:33:05.840]   I try and just approach it all that way,
[02:33:05.840 --> 02:33:08.660]   where you just made all of this very clear
[02:33:08.660 --> 02:33:10.020]   in a much more succinct way,
[02:33:10.020 --> 02:33:13.140]   where you just said like, great, I like it.
[02:33:13.140 --> 02:33:14.780]   - Yeah, I like it.
[02:33:14.780 --> 02:33:15.600]   - It's awesome.
[02:33:15.600 --> 02:33:18.900]   Yeah, yours with a real genuine sense of joy.
[02:33:18.900 --> 02:33:19.740]   - Yeah.
[02:33:19.740 --> 02:33:21.220]   - Like no, like, well, I like it.
[02:33:21.220 --> 02:33:23.620]   There's no friction in that statement.
[02:33:23.620 --> 02:33:24.820]   It's just, I like it.
[02:33:24.820 --> 02:33:26.100]   - Yeah, I really like it.
[02:33:26.100 --> 02:33:27.300]   I like a lot.
[02:33:27.300 --> 02:33:28.780]   (laughing)
[02:33:28.780 --> 02:33:30.340]   - I love that you like it a lot,
[02:33:30.340 --> 02:33:31.580]   and that you can say it that way.
[02:33:31.580 --> 02:33:32.420]   - Who can't?
[02:33:32.420 --> 02:33:34.940]   Like, if it's all love, nobody can really,
[02:33:34.940 --> 02:33:37.260]   you can outlove almost anything.
[02:33:37.260 --> 02:33:38.420]   You're furious at me?
[02:33:38.420 --> 02:33:39.820]   I like it.
[02:33:39.820 --> 02:33:41.540]   I just outloved you.
[02:33:41.540 --> 02:33:43.460]   And I think that's why Jesus said,
[02:33:43.460 --> 02:33:44.900]   you know, charity never faileth.
[02:33:44.900 --> 02:33:46.860]   It's not that you're gonna win everything
[02:33:46.860 --> 02:33:48.640]   if you are a loving person.
[02:33:48.640 --> 02:33:50.780]   It's that no matter what happens,
[02:33:50.780 --> 02:33:52.220]   it's like that self.
[02:33:52.220 --> 02:33:53.540]   You're suffering, you're pain,
[02:33:53.540 --> 02:33:55.300]   you're codependency, whatever.
[02:33:55.300 --> 02:33:56.820]   It loves it all.
[02:33:56.820 --> 02:33:57.660]   Bring it.
[02:33:57.660 --> 02:33:58.480]   It loves it all.
[02:33:58.480 --> 02:34:00.780]   And that means that no matter what you come at me with,
[02:34:00.780 --> 02:34:03.500]   I can hold that in a field of love.
[02:34:03.500 --> 02:34:06.020]   And my experience is love.
[02:34:06.020 --> 02:34:08.220]   - What was the quote from Jesus?
[02:34:08.220 --> 02:34:09.900]   - It's, I don't know if it's from Jesus,
[02:34:09.900 --> 02:34:12.460]   but in, I think it's in Paul.
[02:34:12.460 --> 02:34:14.980]   It says, "Charity never faileth."
[02:34:14.980 --> 02:34:17.380]   You know, love never fails.
[02:34:17.380 --> 02:34:19.140]   And it's because I can say, I hate myself.
[02:34:19.140 --> 02:34:22.300]   Yes, but I love the part of me that hates myself.
[02:34:22.300 --> 02:34:24.180]   Just outloved you.
[02:34:24.180 --> 02:34:26.540]   - Were you, well, of course the answer is gonna be yes.
[02:34:26.540 --> 02:34:28.820]   I was gonna ask, were you always like this?
[02:34:28.820 --> 02:34:31.800]   Meaning that you could hold this position
[02:34:31.800 --> 02:34:32.820]   on the balance beam,
[02:34:32.820 --> 02:34:35.140]   and then I feel like you've taken this balance beam
[02:34:35.140 --> 02:34:39.140]   and like created this big Mesa for others to stand on.
[02:34:39.140 --> 02:34:42.060]   So, 'cause it's a really stable place to be
[02:34:42.060 --> 02:34:43.540]   once you're there.
[02:34:43.540 --> 02:34:47.940]   But getting to this place of like essential self
[02:34:47.940 --> 02:34:50.740]   and the path to integrity,
[02:34:50.740 --> 02:34:53.740]   I mean, can I just say it the way I feel it?
[02:34:53.740 --> 02:34:54.580]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:34:54.580 --> 02:34:55.580]   - It's fucking difficult.
[02:34:55.580 --> 02:34:57.380]   - Yeah, that's what I was,
[02:34:57.380 --> 02:34:58.820]   I was about to use that same word.
[02:34:58.820 --> 02:35:03.820]   I think in order to be, to become stable,
[02:35:03.820 --> 02:35:07.580]   I always say that the raw material
[02:35:07.580 --> 02:35:10.340]   for any good experience is its opposite.
[02:35:10.340 --> 02:35:15.340]   So, I was messed, I was effed up beyond belief.
[02:35:15.340 --> 02:35:17.780]   There's snafu, these are both military terms.
[02:35:17.780 --> 02:35:21.020]   Snafu means situation normal, all fucked up.
[02:35:21.020 --> 02:35:24.740]   Fubar means fucked up beyond all recognition.
[02:35:24.740 --> 02:35:26.420]   I was fubar.
[02:35:26.420 --> 02:35:27.940]   (laughs)
[02:35:27.940 --> 02:35:30.300]   Now I occasionally get snafu,
[02:35:30.300 --> 02:35:36.300]   but I was so fubar that the suffering was so intense
[02:35:36.300 --> 02:35:39.260]   that when I learned to come home,
[02:35:39.260 --> 02:35:42.820]   the contrast was very sharp.
[02:35:42.820 --> 02:35:46.900]   And I never, ever want to,
[02:35:46.900 --> 02:35:49.000]   I never wanna leave the consciousness
[02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:50.860]   that that light is always with us,
[02:35:50.860 --> 02:35:53.100]   and we can feel it if we're honest,
[02:35:53.100 --> 02:35:54.620]   and that's all we have to do.
[02:35:54.620 --> 02:35:57.900]   Be honest, and there it is, boom, it's got us.
[02:35:57.900 --> 02:36:03.260]   - I feel like it starts with the scope of self.
[02:36:03.260 --> 02:36:04.980]   Like we have to do this for ourselves
[02:36:04.980 --> 02:36:08.180]   before we can do this with and for other people.
[02:36:08.180 --> 02:36:09.140]   - Yeah.
[02:36:09.140 --> 02:36:12.700]   - And then at some point, the fantasy in my mind, right?
[02:36:12.700 --> 02:36:14.900]   Like it sounds like my mother and my mother,
[02:36:14.900 --> 02:36:19.660]   from the youngest age I can remember in myself
[02:36:19.660 --> 02:36:22.060]   was talking about like trying to heal the world.
[02:36:22.060 --> 02:36:24.220]   And I've seen the toll it's taken on her.
[02:36:24.220 --> 02:36:25.580]   Like she'll call sometimes and I'll be like,
[02:36:25.580 --> 02:36:26.420]   "How's it going?"
[02:36:26.420 --> 02:36:27.740]   And like, "Something will have happened in the news."
[02:36:27.740 --> 02:36:31.700]   Like, I can just tell, like, it really wears on her.
[02:36:31.700 --> 02:36:34.220]   And it's hard for me to hear and see,
[02:36:34.220 --> 02:36:38.260]   'cause I feel it too.
[02:36:38.260 --> 02:36:39.660]   It's like, goodness.
[02:36:39.660 --> 02:36:44.660]   Like, do you feel like there's hope for our species?
[02:36:44.660 --> 02:36:46.260]   I mean, I'm trying to not throw
[02:36:46.260 --> 02:36:49.380]   the whole problems of the world at you, but-
[02:36:49.380 --> 02:36:50.660]   - No, I've been thinking about it.
[02:36:50.660 --> 02:36:52.060]   - I mean, like what?
[02:36:52.060 --> 02:36:54.020]   I'm almost 50.
[02:36:54.020 --> 02:36:56.500]   I feel like at this point, I've seen enough to be like,
[02:36:56.500 --> 02:36:59.000]   there's so much goodness in people,
[02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:01.980]   but there's also like the capacity for so much,
[02:37:01.980 --> 02:37:03.940]   like misunderstanding bad.
[02:37:03.940 --> 02:37:05.820]   You got the developmental wiring.
[02:37:05.820 --> 02:37:07.680]   You got the hurt people hurt people.
[02:37:07.680 --> 02:37:09.860]   We're all, everyone's doing the best they can.
[02:37:09.860 --> 02:37:11.460]   Everyone wants safety and acceptance
[02:37:11.460 --> 02:37:12.820]   and they're just trying to find it this way.
[02:37:12.820 --> 02:37:15.660]   And like, and then there are your truly bad actors
[02:37:15.660 --> 02:37:17.820]   'cause they're either miswired or whatever.
[02:37:17.820 --> 02:37:19.220]   And they're like creating havoc.
[02:37:19.220 --> 02:37:23.620]   Like, is there any real hope
[02:37:23.620 --> 02:37:27.420]   for like a different version of things that's persistent?
[02:37:27.420 --> 02:37:29.940]   - The first time I remember worrying about this,
[02:37:29.940 --> 02:37:34.340]   I was four and I'm 10 years older than you are,
[02:37:34.340 --> 02:37:37.660]   but I knew at four that I was here
[02:37:37.660 --> 02:37:39.420]   to try to help with something.
[02:37:39.420 --> 02:37:42.620]   And as I grew up, it just wouldn't go away,
[02:37:42.620 --> 02:37:44.500]   this feeling that I was supposed to help with something.
[02:37:44.500 --> 02:37:46.900]   And in my teens, it became,
[02:37:46.900 --> 02:37:49.240]   I need to help change the way people think.
[02:37:49.240 --> 02:37:50.080]   I don't know.
[02:37:50.080 --> 02:37:52.260]   And then I started noticing other people
[02:37:52.260 --> 02:37:54.460]   who seemed to be like me.
[02:37:54.460 --> 02:37:58.260]   And I'd be like, I think they're on the same team I'm on.
[02:37:58.260 --> 02:37:59.300]   And I was like, what team?
[02:37:59.300 --> 02:38:00.920]   What am I talking about?
[02:38:00.920 --> 02:38:02.940]   And it all came to a head
[02:38:02.940 --> 02:38:06.020]   when I was in South Africa in the wilderness.
[02:38:06.020 --> 02:38:08.660]   And I had a dream that my ancestors were coming to visit me.
[02:38:08.660 --> 02:38:10.280]   And I thought it was funny.
[02:38:10.280 --> 02:38:12.740]   So I told it to some friends from the Shangaan tribe
[02:38:12.740 --> 02:38:16.600]   who reacted like this, and then they ran.
[02:38:16.600 --> 02:38:18.060]   And I was like, what did I do wrong?
[02:38:18.060 --> 02:38:21.100]   And later that night, we're all sitting around the fire,
[02:38:21.100 --> 02:38:22.080]   there are lions roaring.
[02:38:22.080 --> 02:38:24.260]   They bring this little woman from Mozambique
[02:38:24.260 --> 02:38:26.540]   and she's a sangoma, she's a shaman.
[02:38:26.540 --> 02:38:28.940]   And she did her divinatory system,
[02:38:28.940 --> 02:38:30.860]   which is she threw the bones for me.
[02:38:30.860 --> 02:38:33.440]   'Cause if you had dream I had,
[02:38:33.440 --> 02:38:35.940]   you have to see a sangoma right away
[02:38:35.940 --> 02:38:37.820]   or bad things will happen.
[02:38:37.820 --> 02:38:39.940]   So she said stuff about me that was true,
[02:38:39.940 --> 02:38:42.280]   but she could have Googled it, you know?
[02:38:42.280 --> 02:38:45.540]   And it was weird when she looked at me,
[02:38:45.540 --> 02:38:47.740]   I felt like these ice needles going through me.
[02:38:47.740 --> 02:38:50.620]   It was not cute, but it was very intense.
[02:38:50.620 --> 02:38:52.660]   And what she said was,
[02:38:52.660 --> 02:38:55.620]   there are people being born to be healers
[02:38:55.620 --> 02:38:56.440]   all over the world,
[02:38:56.440 --> 02:38:59.480]   just like there are in the traditional tribes.
[02:38:59.480 --> 02:39:01.580]   You need to go find them and tell them
[02:39:01.580 --> 02:39:03.260]   what they're here to do.
[02:39:03.260 --> 02:39:04.980]   They're here to heal the world
[02:39:04.980 --> 02:39:08.420]   and they need the wisdom that the traditional people had
[02:39:08.420 --> 02:39:10.820]   and they need their technology.
[02:39:10.820 --> 02:39:13.460]   And it was so interesting because she was like confused.
[02:39:13.460 --> 02:39:15.340]   She acted very frightened and confused
[02:39:15.340 --> 02:39:16.780]   by what she was saying to me.
[02:39:16.780 --> 02:39:18.500]   She had to get a group of people behind her
[02:39:18.500 --> 02:39:21.420]   who would chant, "We agree, we agree,"
[02:39:21.420 --> 02:39:23.120]   because she was freaked out.
[02:39:23.120 --> 02:39:28.380]   But I think that in every traditional group
[02:39:28.380 --> 02:39:30.860]   of 100 to 150 people,
[02:39:30.860 --> 02:39:34.140]   there were a few healers that were recognized by the elders
[02:39:34.140 --> 02:39:37.040]   as people who were highly sensitive.
[02:39:37.040 --> 02:39:38.860]   They were interested in nature and science.
[02:39:38.860 --> 02:39:40.640]   They were interested in animals.
[02:39:40.640 --> 02:39:42.620]   They were interested in the mystery.
[02:39:42.620 --> 02:39:44.020]   They were interested in the arts.
[02:39:44.020 --> 02:39:45.460]   They were performers,
[02:39:45.460 --> 02:39:49.380]   but they were also very like introverted
[02:39:49.380 --> 02:39:52.220]   and thinky-thinky.
[02:39:52.220 --> 02:39:57.160]   It's an archetype of healing, of medicine person.
[02:39:57.160 --> 02:40:00.980]   The coaches I coach, I call it Wayfinders,
[02:40:00.980 --> 02:40:03.180]   which is a term from an anthropologist.
[02:40:03.180 --> 02:40:06.060]   If you're born in that archetype,
[02:40:06.060 --> 02:40:08.180]   if you have that phenotype,
[02:40:08.180 --> 02:40:09.540]   I believe it's a phenotype
[02:40:09.540 --> 02:40:12.640]   and I believe it crops up in every 100 to 150 people
[02:40:12.640 --> 02:40:17.140]   several times, and our culture has no word for it
[02:40:17.140 --> 02:40:19.060]   and no path for it.
[02:40:19.060 --> 02:40:21.180]   But if we are going to save the world,
[02:40:21.180 --> 02:40:24.860]   we will draw on whatever was born into us
[02:40:24.860 --> 02:40:26.460]   that makes us wanna heal things,
[02:40:26.460 --> 02:40:30.620]   and we will use the technologies we've developed,
[02:40:30.620 --> 02:40:35.080]   and we will use our joy and our refusal to participate
[02:40:35.080 --> 02:40:37.300]   in the nonsense of our culture,
[02:40:37.300 --> 02:40:41.040]   and we will hold firm and we will try to change
[02:40:41.040 --> 02:40:43.900]   the way humanity lives on this planet.
[02:40:43.900 --> 02:40:46.660]   And I don't know which way it's gonna go,
[02:40:46.660 --> 02:40:48.400]   but I'm in the game.
[02:40:48.400 --> 02:40:51.580]   And I kind of think you are too.
[02:40:51.580 --> 02:40:54.140]   - I have a feeling I am too.
[02:40:54.140 --> 02:40:58.020]   And I'm certain that I'm in it thanks to you.
[02:40:58.020 --> 02:40:59.020]   - Aw, yeah.
[02:40:59.020 --> 02:41:02.300]   - Seriously, in large part.
[02:41:02.300 --> 02:41:06.100]   I've told the story earlier that the path I'm on
[02:41:06.100 --> 02:41:08.740]   and the fact that anyone's listening to this
[02:41:08.740 --> 02:41:12.340]   and watching it is the consequence of having read your books
[02:41:12.340 --> 02:41:16.820]   and done the exercises and will continue to do them.
[02:41:16.820 --> 02:41:21.660]   So I must say there really aren't words
[02:41:21.660 --> 02:41:25.040]   to express how much this means to me
[02:41:25.040 --> 02:41:26.500]   that you would come here,
[02:41:26.500 --> 02:41:29.520]   take the time to share with us your wisdom,
[02:41:29.520 --> 02:41:32.360]   and to delve into some topics
[02:41:32.360 --> 02:41:34.920]   that are of particular interest to me,
[02:41:34.920 --> 02:41:36.920]   'cause I, like everyone else, I'm a work in progress
[02:41:36.920 --> 02:41:40.160]   who's curious about the best ways to move forward.
[02:41:40.160 --> 02:41:43.200]   And yeah, every time you speak,
[02:41:43.200 --> 02:41:45.240]   and just when you show up someplace,
[02:41:45.240 --> 02:41:48.160]   it's an incredible thing.
[02:41:48.160 --> 02:41:50.640]   Everybody learns, everybody gets better,
[02:41:50.640 --> 02:41:55.640]   and everyone walks away with tools and empowerment.
[02:41:55.640 --> 02:41:59.880]   And I just wanna say thank you so much.
[02:41:59.880 --> 02:42:02.240]   There's really not a whole lot else.
[02:42:02.240 --> 02:42:03.140]   - Same to you.
[02:42:03.140 --> 02:42:05.040]   You're just looking in the mirror.
[02:42:06.840 --> 02:42:07.680]   Thank you.
[02:42:07.680 --> 02:42:09.340]   - Thank you.
[02:42:09.340 --> 02:42:11.440]   I might be the only podcast ever ending in tears.
[02:42:11.440 --> 02:42:12.680]   Thank you so much.
[02:42:12.680 --> 02:42:14.720]   Thank you for joining me for today's discussion

[02:42:57.560 --> 02:42:59.440]   I do read all the comments.
[02:42:59.440 --> 02:43:00.600]   For those of you that haven't heard,
[02:43:00.600 --> 02:43:01.800]   I have a new book coming out.
[02:43:01.800 --> 02:43:03.400]   It's my very first book.
[02:43:03.400 --> 02:43:05.920]   It's entitled "Protocols, an Operating Manual
[02:43:05.920 --> 02:43:06.960]   for the Human Body."
[02:43:06.960 --> 02:43:08.140]   This is a book that I've been working on
[02:43:08.140 --> 02:43:09.280]   for more than five years,
[02:43:09.280 --> 02:43:11.620]   and that's based on more than 30 years
[02:43:11.620 --> 02:43:13.160]   of research and experience.
[02:43:13.160 --> 02:43:16.220]   And it covers protocols for everything from sleep
[02:43:16.220 --> 02:43:18.720]   to exercise, to stress control,
[02:43:18.720 --> 02:43:21.160]   protocols related to focus and motivation.
[02:43:21.160 --> 02:43:24.520]   And of course, I provide the scientific substantiation
[02:43:24.520 --> 02:43:26.600]   for the protocols that are included.
[02:43:26.600 --> 02:43:30.520]   The book is now available by presale at protocolsbook.com.
[02:43:30.520 --> 02:43:32.880]   There you can find links to various vendors.
[02:43:32.880 --> 02:43:34.640]   You can pick the one that you like best.
[02:43:34.640 --> 02:43:36.440]   Again, the book is called "Protocols,
[02:43:36.440 --> 02:43:39.040]   an Operating Manual for the Human Body."
[02:43:39.040 --> 02:43:41.360]   If you're not already following me on social media,
[02:43:41.360 --> 02:43:44.280]   I am Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[02:43:44.280 --> 02:43:47.160]   So that's Instagram, Twitter, now known as X,
[02:43:47.160 --> 02:43:49.120]   Threads, Facebook, and LinkedIn.
[02:43:49.120 --> 02:43:50.600]   And on all those platforms,
[02:43:50.600 --> 02:43:52.920]   I discuss science and science-related tools,
[02:43:52.920 --> 02:43:54.420]   some of which overlap with the contents
[02:43:54.420 --> 02:43:55.680]   of the Huberman Lab podcast,
[02:43:55.680 --> 02:43:57.720]   but much of which is distinct from the contents
[02:43:57.720 --> 02:43:59.360]   of the Huberman Lab podcast.
[02:43:59.360 --> 02:44:03.080]   Again, that's Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[02:44:03.080 --> 02:44:04.320]   If you haven't already subscribed
[02:44:04.320 --> 02:44:05.960]   to our Neural Network Newsletter,
[02:44:05.960 --> 02:44:07.400]   our Neural Network Newsletter
[02:44:07.400 --> 02:44:09.480]   is a zero-cost monthly newsletter
[02:44:09.480 --> 02:44:11.080]   that includes what we call protocols,
[02:44:11.080 --> 02:44:13.520]   which are brief one- to three-page PDFs
[02:44:13.520 --> 02:44:16.560]   that cover things such as neuroplasticity and learning,
[02:44:16.560 --> 02:44:19.640]   dopamine optimization, how to get better sleep,
