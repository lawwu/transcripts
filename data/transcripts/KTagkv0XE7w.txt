[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160]   somebody comes in professionally dressed when they didn't need to.
[00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.840]   So they've got a crisp clean shirt. They've got a nice wash.
[00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:05.920]   How old are they?
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.440]   20.
[00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.440]   They're too conformist. Again, some jobs conformity is great,
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.200]   but I get a little suspicious at least for what I'm looking for.
[00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.240]   Interesting.
[00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.000]   But I wouldn't rule them out for a lot of things. It's a plus, right?
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.600]   Is there a point though where you're in some way being conformist by dressing up
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.960]   in a polo shirt? Like if you're in San Francisco, right now,
[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.080]   it seems like the conformist thing is not to wear a suit to an interview.
[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.520]   If you're like trying to be a software engineer.
[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.760]   Yeah. There might be situations where it's so weird. So over the top,
[00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.760]   so conformist that it's actually total non-conformism.
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.280]   Like I don't know anyone who's a conformist like you are.
[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.360]   Maybe they're not being a conformist, right?
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.080]   They're just some kind of nut and then you're interested again.
