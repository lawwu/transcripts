[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.360]   - Welcome to Huberman Lab Essentials,
[00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:04.400]   where we revisit past episodes
[00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.600]   for the most potent and actionable science-based tools
[00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.360]   for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.880]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.000]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.480]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:18.800]   Today, we're going to talk about
[00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.660]   an extremely important topic
[00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.440]   that's central to our daily life, and that's motivation.
[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.040]   We're going to talk about pleasure and reward.
[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.920]   What underlies our sense of pleasure or reward?
[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.680]   We're going to talk about addictions.
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.720]   As well, we're going to talk about
[00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.540]   the neurochemistry of drive and mindset.
[00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.320]   But for now, let's just talk about
[00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.960]   the neuroscience of motivation and reward,
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.560]   of pleasure and pain,
[00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.560]   because those are central to what we think of as emotions,
[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:47.680]   whether or not we feel good,
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.520]   whether or not we feel we're on track in life,
[00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.960]   whether or not we feel we're falling behind.
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.960]   So motivation is fundamental to our daily life.
[00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.200]   It's what allows us to get out of bed in the morning.
[00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.560]   It's what allows us to pursue long-term goals
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.100]   or short-term goals.
[00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.600]   Motivation and the chemistry of motivation
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.600]   is tightly wound in with the neurochemistry of movement.
[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.320]   In fact, the same single molecule, dopamine,
[00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.320]   is responsible for our sense of motivation and for movement.
[00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.400]   It's a fascinating molecule,
[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.760]   and it lies at the center of so many great things in life,
[00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.560]   and it lies at the center of so many terrible aspects
[00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.000]   of life, namely addiction
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.200]   and certain forms of mental disease.
[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.320]   So if ever there was a double-edged blade
[00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.120]   in the world of neuroscience, it's dopamine.
[00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.040]   There's a fundamental relationship
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.320]   between dopamine released in your brain
[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.600]   and your desire to exert effort.
[00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.560]   And you can actually control
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.160]   the schedule of dopamine release,
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.620]   but it requires the appropriate knowledge.
[00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.040]   This is one of those cases where understanding
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.480]   the way the dopamine system works
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.680]   will allow you to leverage it to your benefit.
[00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.260]   Let's get a few basic facts on the table.
[00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.160]   Dopamine was discovered in the late 1950s,
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.900]   and it was discovered as the precursor,
[00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.780]   meaning the thing from which epinephrine
[00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.640]   or adrenaline is made.
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.880]   Epinephrine is the same thing as adrenaline,
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.080]   except in the brain we call it epinephrine.
[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.220]   Epinephrine allows us to get into action.
[00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.480]   It stimulates changes in the blood vessels,
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.760]   in the heart, in the organs and tissues of the body
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.320]   that bias us for movement.
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.960]   Dopamine was initially thought to be
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.240]   just the building block for epinephrine.
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.800]   However, dopamine does a lot of things on its own.
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.800]   It's not always converted to epinephrine.
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.880]   Dopamine is released from several sites
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.300]   in the brain and body,
[00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.720]   but perhaps the most important one for today's discussion
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.640]   about motivation and reward
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.060]   is something that's sometimes just called
[00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.920]   the reward pathway.
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.000]   For the aficionados,
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.320]   it's sometimes called the mesolimbic reward pathway,
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.160]   but it's fundamentally important
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.560]   to your desire to engage in action.
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.880]   And it's fundamentally important
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.120]   for people getting addicted to substances or behaviors.
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.520]   So how does this work?
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.880]   Well, you've got a structure
[00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.480]   in the deep part of your brain called the VTA.
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.960]   The VTA or ventral tegmental area contains neurons
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.320]   that send what we call axons, little wires,
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.280]   that spit out dopamine at a different structure
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.200]   called the nucleus accumbens.
[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.000]   And those two structures, VTA and nucleus accumbens,
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.060]   form really the core machinery of the reward pathway
[00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.720]   and the pathway that controls your motivation for anything.
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.980]   You can think of them like an accelerator.
[00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.560]   They bias you for action.
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.220]   However, within the reward pathway, there's also a break.
[00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.640]   The break or restriction on that dopamine,
[00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.280]   which controls when it's released
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.360]   and how much it's released, is the prefrontal cortex.
[00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.720]   The prefrontal cortex is the neural real estate
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.240]   right behind your forehead.
[00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.080]   You hear about it for decision-making,
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.920]   executive function, for planning, et cetera.
[00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.680]   And indeed, it's responsible for a lot of those.
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.720]   It's this really unique real estate
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.820]   that we were all endowed with as humans.
[00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.180]   Other animals don't have much of it.
[00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:03.640]   We have a lot of it.
[00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.280]   And that prefrontal cortex acts
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.600]   as a break on the dopamine system.
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.920]   And that brings us to the important feature of motivation,
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.700]   which is that motivation is a two-part process,
[00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.300]   which is about balancing pleasure and pain.
[00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:19.900]   So when you're just sitting around,
[00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.360]   not doing much of anything,
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.800]   this reward pathway is releasing dopamine
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.760]   at a rate of about three or four times per second.
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.280]   It's kind of firing at a low level.
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.680]   If suddenly you get excited about something,
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.900]   you anticipate something, not receive an award,
[00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.880]   but you get excited in an anticipatory way,
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.360]   then the rate of firing,
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.680]   the rate of activity in this reward pathway
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.020]   suddenly increases to like 30 or 40 times.
[00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.800]   And it has the effect
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.640]   of creating a sense of action or desire to move
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.880]   in the direction of the thing that you're craving.
[00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.480]   In fact, it's fair to say
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:59.520]   that dopamine is responsible for wanting and for craving.
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.340]   And that's distinctly different
[00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.400]   from the way that you hear it talked about normally,
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.080]   which is that it's involved in pleasure.
[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.440]   So yes, dopamine is released in response to sex.
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:09.980]   It's released in response to food.
[00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:12.560]   It's released in response to a lot of things,
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.440]   but it's mostly released in anticipation
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.760]   and craving for a particular thing.
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.320]   It has the effect of narrowing our focus
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.200]   for the thing that we crave.
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.400]   And that thing could be as simple as a cup of coffee.
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.340]   It could be as important as a big board meeting.
[00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:28.640]   It could be a big final exam.
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.760]   It could be the person that we're excited to meet or see.
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.600]   Dopamine doesn't care about what you're craving.
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.200]   It just releases at a particular rate.
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.320]   If we just take a step back
[00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.380]   and we look at the scientific data
[00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:44.380]   on how much the dopamine firing increases
[00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:45.680]   in response to different things,
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.960]   you get a pretty interesting window
[00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:49.800]   into how your brain works
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.300]   and why you might be motivated or not motivated.
[00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.120]   Let's say you're hungry
[00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.640]   or you're looking forward to a cup of coffee
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.520]   or you're going to see your partner.
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.720]   Well, your dopamine neurons are firing at a low rate
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.400]   until you start thinking about the thing that you want
[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.480]   or the thing that you're looking forward to.
[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:09.520]   When you eat that food,
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.280]   the amount of dopamine that's released
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:14.000]   in this reward pathway goes up about 50%
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.060]   above baseline.
[00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:18.060]   Sex, which is fundamental
[00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:21.780]   to our species continuation and reproduction,
[00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:23.980]   sex does release dopamine
[00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:26.920]   and it increases dopamine levels about 100%.
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.340]   So basically doubles them.
[00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:32.220]   Nicotine increases the amount of dopamine
[00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:35.000]   about 150% above baseline.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.700]   Cocaine and amphetamine increase the amount of dopamine
[00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:39.820]   that's released a thousand fold
[00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:43.020]   within about 10 seconds of consuming the drug.
[00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:45.980]   However, just thinking about food,
[00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:48.720]   about sex, about nicotine,
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.740]   if you like nicotine or cocaine or amphetamine
[00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:54.520]   can increase the amount of dopamine that's released
[00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:58.260]   to the same degree as actually consuming the drug.
[00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.800]   Now it depends, in some cases, for instance,
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.080]   the cocaine user, the addict that wants cocaine
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:05.920]   can't just think about cocaine
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:07.900]   and increase the amount of that's released
[00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:10.160]   about a thousand fold, it's actually much lower,
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.760]   but it's just enough to put them on the motivation track
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:15.100]   for it to crave that particular thing.
[00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:15.940]   Now there are reasons
[00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:17.860]   why you would have brain circuitry like this.
[00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:19.060]   I mean, brain circuitry like this
[00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:20.900]   didn't evolve to get you addicted.
[00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:24.460]   Brain circuitry like this evolved
[00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:27.620]   in order to motivate behaviors toward particular goals,
[00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:30.860]   water when you're thirsty, sex in order to reproduce.
[00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:33.900]   These things and these brain areas and neurons
[00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:36.780]   were part of the evolutionary history
[00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:39.420]   that led to the continuation of our species.
[00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:41.780]   Things like cocaine and amphetamine
[00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:43.380]   are disastrous for most people
[00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:45.580]   because they release so much dopamine
[00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:47.360]   and they create these closed loops
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:50.500]   where people then only crave the particular thing,
[00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:51.820]   cocaine and amphetamine,
[00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:54.620]   that leads to those massive amounts of dopamine release.
[00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:57.980]   Most things don't release that level of dopamine.
[00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:00.880]   And nowadays there's a ton of interest in social media
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:02.460]   and in video games.
[00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:05.220]   And there have been some measurements
[00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:06.900]   of the amount of dopamine released.
[00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:09.140]   Video games, especially video games
[00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:11.200]   that have a very high update speed
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.460]   where there's novel territory all the time.
[00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:15.840]   Novelty is a big stimulus of dopamine.
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:17.100]   Those can release dopamine
[00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:19.820]   somewhere between nicotine and cocaine.
[00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:22.740]   So very high levels of dopamine release.
[00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:24.820]   Social media is an interesting one
[00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:26.660]   because the amount of dopamine that's released
[00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:29.020]   in response to logging onto social media
[00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:30.880]   initially could be quite high,
[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:33.540]   but it seems like likely that there's a taper
[00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:34.840]   in the amount of dopamine,
[00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:36.860]   but and yet people still get addicted.
[00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:37.700]   So why?
[00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:40.220]   Why is it that we can get addicted to things
[00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:43.580]   that fail to get to elicit the same massive amount
[00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:45.660]   of pleasure that they initially did?
[00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:48.180]   Being addicted to something isn't just about
[00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:49.700]   the fact that it feels so good
[00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:51.180]   that you want to do it over and over again.
[00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:54.900]   And that's because of this pleasure pain balance
[00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:56.300]   that underlies motivation.
[00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:57.460]   So let's look a little bit closer
[00:08:57.460 --> 00:08:58.620]   at the pleasure pain balance
[00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:01.160]   because therein lies the tools
[00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:03.100]   for you to be able to control motivation
[00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:06.060]   toward healthy things and avoid motivated behaviors
[00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:08.100]   towards things that are destructive for you.
[00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:11.260]   There are a lot of reasons why people try novel behaviors,
[00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:12.540]   whether or not those are drugs
[00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:15.620]   or whether or not those are adventure thrill-seeking things
[00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:17.620]   or they take a new class.
[00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:19.940]   As you'll notice, I'm not placing any judgment
[00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:21.800]   or value on these different behaviors.
[00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:23.460]   Although I think it's fair to point out
[00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:25.140]   that for most people,
[00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:28.800]   addictive drugs like cocaine and amphetamine
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:30.320]   are very destructive.
[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:35.380]   Actually, we know that about 15 to 20% of people
[00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:38.580]   have a genetic bias towards addiction
[00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:41.600]   that you sometimes hear that the first time
[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:44.140]   that you use a drug, you can become addicted to it.
[00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:46.020]   That's actually not been shown to be true
[00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:47.620]   for most things in most people,
[00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:49.620]   but for some people that actually is true.
[00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:52.780]   But in any case, the way that addiction works
[00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:54.940]   and the way that motivation works generally
[00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:56.500]   in the non-addictive setting
[00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:58.300]   is that when you anticipate something,
[00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:00.000]   a little bit of dopamine is released.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.420]   And then when you reach that thing,
[00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:03.620]   you engage in that thing,
[00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:06.000]   the amount of dopamine goes up even further.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.860]   But as you repeatedly pursue a behavior
[00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:11.200]   and you repeatedly engage with a particular thing,
[00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:14.420]   let's say you love running or you love chocolate.
[00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:16.900]   As you eat a piece of chocolate,
[00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:19.220]   believe it or not, it tastes good.
[00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:23.720]   And then there's a shift away from activation of dopamine.
[00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:26.200]   And there are other chemicals that are released
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:29.100]   that trigger a low level sense of pain.
[00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:31.080]   Now you might not feel it as physical pain,
[00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:35.560]   but the craving that you feel is both one part dopamine
[00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:38.260]   and one part, the mirror image of dopamine,
[00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.180]   which is the pain or the craving
[00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:42.420]   for yet another piece of chocolate.
[00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:44.780]   And this is a very important and subtle feature
[00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:47.740]   of the dopamine system that's not often discussed.
[00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:49.500]   People always talk about just as pleasure.
[00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:52.140]   You love social media, so it gives you dopamine.
[00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:53.780]   And so you engage in that, you like chocolate,
[00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:55.280]   it releases dopamine, so you do that.
[00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:57.780]   But for every bit of dopamine that's released,
[00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:00.460]   there's another circuit in the brain that creates,
[00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:02.840]   you can think of it as kind of like a downward deflection
[00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:03.680]   in pleasure.
[00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:05.500]   So you engage in something you really want
[00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:06.980]   and there's an increase in pleasure.
[00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:11.040]   And then there's a, without you doing anything,
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:12.460]   there's a mirror image of that,
[00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:14.460]   which is a downward deflection in pleasure,
[00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:15.740]   which we're calling pain.
[00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:17.260]   So for every bit of pleasure,
[00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:20.140]   there is a mirror image experience of pain.
[00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:22.500]   And they overlap in time very closely.
[00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:24.700]   So it's sometimes hard to sense this, but try it.
[00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:26.600]   The next time you eat something really delicious,
[00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:28.460]   you'll take a bite, it tastes delicious.
[00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:32.220]   And part of the experience is to want more of that thing.
[00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:35.340]   This is true for any pleasureful experience.
[00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:37.660]   Now, the diabolical part about dopamine
[00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:39.900]   is that because it didn't evolve
[00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:42.540]   in order to get you to indulge in more and more
[00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:44.040]   and more of something,
[00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:47.460]   what happens is that initially,
[00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:50.780]   you experience an increase in pleasure
[00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:53.340]   and you also experience this increase in pain
[00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:56.380]   shortly after or woven in with the pleasure
[00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:58.380]   that makes you want more of that thing.
[00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:03.080]   But with each subsequent time that you encounter that thing,
[00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:06.180]   the experience of dopamine release and pleasure
[00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:08.060]   is diminished a little bit.
[00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:12.340]   And the diabolical thing is that the pain response
[00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:14.420]   is increased a little bit.
[00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:15.980]   And this is best observed
[00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:18.160]   in the context of drug seeking behavior.
[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:21.180]   The first time someone decides to take cocaine or amphetamine
[00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:23.580]   they will experience a huge dopamine release
[00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:26.760]   and they will feel likely very good.
[00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:28.100]   However, the next time they take it,
[00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:29.860]   it won't feel quite as good
[00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:31.860]   and it won't feel even as good the third time
[00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:33.280]   or the next time.
[00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:36.060]   But the amount of pain,
[00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:38.740]   the amount of craving that they experienced for the drug
[00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:40.240]   will increase over time.
[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:42.220]   So much of our pursuit of pleasure
[00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:45.500]   is simply to reduce the pain of craving.
[00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:47.800]   So the next time you experience something you really like,
[00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:49.460]   I don't want to take you out of that experience,
[00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:52.340]   but it's really important that you notice this,
[00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:54.700]   that if there's something you really enjoy,
[00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:58.120]   part of that enjoyment is about the anticipation
[00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:00.580]   and wanting of more of that thing.
[00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:02.820]   And that's the pain system in action.
[00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:04.820]   And so we can distinguish between dopamine,
[00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:06.120]   which is really about pleasure
[00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:08.260]   and dopamine, which is really about motivation
[00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:13.260]   to pursue more in order to relieve or exclude future pain.
[00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:14.340]   Let me repeat that.
[00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:16.460]   Dopamine isn't as much about pleasure
[00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:20.860]   as much as it is about motivation and desire to pursue more
[00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:24.580]   in order to reduce the amount of pain.
[00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:27.560]   And we are now talking about pain as a psychological pain
[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:28.400]   and a craving.
[00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:32.300]   Although people that miss a lover very badly
[00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:35.580]   or that really crave a food very badly
[00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:39.620]   or that are addicted to a drug and can't access it
[00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:42.780]   will experience that as a physical craving
[00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:43.860]   and a mental craving.
[00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:45.980]   The body and brain are linked in this way.
[00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:47.940]   It's almost, they'll describe it as painful.
[00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:49.300]   They yearn for it.
[00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:50.740]   And I think the word yearning
[00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:52.780]   is one that's very valuable in this context
[00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:56.820]   because yearning seems to include a whole body experience
[00:13:56.820 --> 00:14:00.180]   more than just wanting, which could just be up in the mind.
[00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:03.820]   So your desire for something is proportional
[00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:07.920]   to how pleasureful it is to indulge in that thing,
[00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:09.700]   but also how much pain you experience
[00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:11.140]   when you don't have it.
[00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:13.700]   And you can now start to let your mind wander
[00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:15.520]   into all sorts of examples of addictions
[00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:17.640]   or things that you happen to like.
[00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:19.580]   I'll use the example that I sometimes use on here,
[00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:21.100]   which is my love of croissants.
[00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:22.820]   The taste of that croissant makes me want
[00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:24.100]   to eat more croissants.
[00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:26.100]   Now, eventually blood sugar goes up,
[00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:27.540]   satiety is reached, et cetera.
[00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:28.460]   What happens then?
[00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:30.780]   What is satisfaction and satiety about?
[00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:32.720]   Well, that's a separate neuromodulator.
[00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:35.420]   That's about the neuromodulator serotonin.
[00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:37.220]   It's about oxytocin.
[00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:39.140]   It's about a hormone system
[00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:40.700]   that involves something called prolactin.
[00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:43.540]   So we're going to talk about all of those in the book,
[00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:45.600]   "The Molecule of More," wonderful book.
[00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:49.260]   Those were described as the here and now molecules,
[00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:52.020]   the ones that allow you to experience your sensations
[00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:53.340]   and pleasure in the present
[00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:56.560]   and for which the brain stops projecting into the future.
[00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:58.820]   So now let's talk about craving
[00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:00.860]   and these so-called here and now molecules
[00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:03.940]   and how those engage in a kind of push-pull balance
[00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:07.140]   that will allow you to not just feel more motivated,
[00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:09.380]   but also to enjoy the things in life
[00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:12.140]   that you are pursuing to a much greater degree.
[00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:15.060]   We have neurons in an area of our brain called the raphe,
[00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:16.780]   R-A-P-H-E.
[00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:19.720]   The raphe releases serotonin
[00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:21.300]   at different places in the brain.
[00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:25.500]   Serotonin is the molecule of bliss and contentment
[00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:27.120]   for what you already have.
[00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:30.140]   I've talked before about exteroception.
[00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:32.960]   Exteroception is a focus on the outside world,
[00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:35.580]   everything beyond the confines of your skin.
[00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:37.400]   I've also talked about interoception,
[00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:39.460]   a focus on things that are happening internally
[00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:41.100]   within the confines of your skin.
[00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:47.320]   Dopamine and serotonin can be thought of
[00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:49.720]   as related to exteroception.
[00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:52.160]   Dopamine makes us focused on things outside us
[00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:55.040]   that are beyond what we call our personal space
[00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:57.840]   where we actually have to move and take action
[00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:59.440]   in order to achieve things.
[00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:02.200]   And serotonin in general has to do with the things
[00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:03.880]   that are in our immediate here and now,
[00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:07.280]   hence the description of these as the here and now molecules.
[00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:09.320]   So it's interesting to point out
[00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:13.240]   that the body and the brain can direct its attention
[00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:14.920]   towards things outside us or inside us
[00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:17.080]   or split our attention between those.
[00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:19.440]   Just understand that dopamine biases us
[00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:21.600]   toward thinking about what we don't have.
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:24.260]   Whereas serotonin and some of the related molecules
[00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:26.400]   like the endocannabinoids,
[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:27.880]   if you picked up on the word cannabinoid,
[00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:29.000]   yes, it's like cannabis
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.240]   because cannabis attaches to endocannabinoid receptors
[00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:36.120]   and the endocannabinoids are receptors and chemicals
[00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:38.280]   that the cannabinoids that you naturally make
[00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:40.640]   that are involved in things like forgetting,
[00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:43.320]   but you make these molecules that bind to these receptors
[00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:45.120]   that make you feel kind of blissed out
[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:47.160]   and content in the present.
[00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:48.360]   So you've got these two systems.
[00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:50.180]   They're kind of like a push pull.
[00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:53.240]   And if you were to say, do the, you know, in the book,
[00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:54.660]   wherever you go, there you are.
[00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:57.320]   Jon Kabat-Zinn talks about this meditation practice
[00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:59.300]   that's different than most meditation practices
[00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:00.880]   where you eat one almond
[00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:03.640]   and you focus all of your attention on the almond,
[00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:06.220]   the taste of the almond, the texture of the almond.
[00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:08.540]   That's really a mindfulness practice
[00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:11.200]   that's geared towards trying to take a behavior
[00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:13.480]   which is normally about pursuit.
[00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:15.640]   Normally feeding is we're going,
[00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:17.880]   we engage in feeding because of dopamine.
[00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:19.060]   We pursue more of a food
[00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:20.680]   because of that pleasure pain relationship
[00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:22.000]   I talked about before.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.840]   The focus on the one almond
[00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:27.160]   or becoming very present in any behavior
[00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:28.960]   that normally would be a kind of
[00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:31.240]   extra receptive pursuit behavior
[00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:33.320]   and bring it into the here and now.
[00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:37.820]   That's a mental trick or a mental task
[00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:40.580]   that the mindfulness community has really embraced
[00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:42.820]   in order to try and create increased pleasure
[00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:44.380]   for what you already have.
[00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:46.600]   It's really trying to accomplish a shift
[00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:49.540]   from dopamine being released to serotonin
[00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:53.260]   and the cannabinoid system being involved in that behavior.
[00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:55.580]   Dopamine has the quality of making people
[00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:57.740]   kind of rabidly in pursuit of things.
[00:17:57.740 --> 00:18:02.420]   Drugs like marijuana, the opioids,
[00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:06.860]   anything that really hits the serotonin system hard
[00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:08.760]   tend to make people rather lethargic
[00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:10.380]   and content to stay exactly where they are.
[00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:12.780]   They don't want to pursue much at all.
[00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:14.980]   So you've got these molecules like dopamine
[00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:16.740]   that make you focused on the things you want
[00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:17.780]   and the things you crave.
[00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:19.280]   And then you've got the molecules
[00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:21.420]   that make you content with what you have.
[00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:24.620]   So the most important thing perhaps
[00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:27.500]   in creating a healthy emotional landscape
[00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:28.460]   is to have a balance
[00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:30.700]   between these two neuromodulator systems.
[00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:32.540]   So at about this point in the podcast,
[00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:34.460]   I'm guessing that some of you are thinking,
[00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:36.140]   okay, great, I want more dopamine.
[00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:37.540]   I want to be more motivated.
[00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:39.620]   I don't want to procrastinate as much.
[00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:42.060]   And I want to be able to experience life.
[00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:45.100]   I want these here and now molecules to be released as well.
[00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:46.420]   Well, there is a way to do that,
[00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:49.800]   but you have to understand the source of procrastination
[00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:51.380]   is not one thing.
[00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:53.540]   There are basically two kinds of procrastinators
[00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:55.620]   or so says the research.
[00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:58.860]   The first kind are people that actually really enjoy
[00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:02.080]   the stress of the impending deadline.
[00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:03.900]   It's the only way they can get into action.
[00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:05.420]   There are other procrastinators
[00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:08.340]   for which they simply are not releasing enough dopamine.
[00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:10.260]   For those people, there are a variety of things
[00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:11.380]   that can increase dopamine.
[00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:13.780]   I do suggest you talk to a psychiatrist or doctor.
[00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:18.780]   I've talked about mucunipurines, which is 99.9% L-DOPA,
[00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:21.200]   the precursor to dopamine.
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:24.220]   There are antidepressants like Wellbutrin,
[00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:26.460]   bupryron is the other name for it,
[00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:28.560]   which increased dopamine and epinephrine.
[00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:32.100]   However, if you think back to our earlier discussion
[00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:37.100]   about dopamine, dopamine, if it's very high,
[00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:40.780]   creates a sense of pleasure and the desire for more.
[00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:43.180]   So you can also become a person
[00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:45.580]   for which enough is never enough.
[00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:47.860]   The only thing that dopamine really wants
[00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:50.180]   is more of the thing that releases dopamine.
[00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:52.140]   And so one of the things that you can do
[00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:54.740]   in order to generally just be a happier person,
[00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:57.260]   especially if you're a person in pursuit of long-term goals
[00:19:57.260 --> 00:20:01.460]   of any kind, is the longer that you can extend
[00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:04.260]   that positive phase of the dopamine release.
[00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:08.020]   And the more that you can blunt the pain response to that,
[00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:08.860]   the better.
[00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:10.020]   And you can actually do this cognitively.
[00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:13.300]   I used to joke with my lab that when we'd publish a paper,
[00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:14.900]   I would get really excited,
[00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:17.220]   but I wouldn't allow myself to get too excited.
[00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:18.380]   What I wanted to do instead,
[00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:21.680]   and what I've still tried to do is try and extend the arc
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:24.420]   of that positive experience as long as I possibly can,
[00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:26.460]   simply by thinking back like, oh, that was really cool.
[00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:27.820]   I really enjoyed doing that work.
[00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:30.080]   I really enjoyed the discovery.
[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:31.860]   I really enjoyed doing that with the people
[00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:34.060]   that I was working with at the time.
[00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:35.700]   What a pleasure that was.
[00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:38.300]   So you can extend pleasure without having to engage
[00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:40.260]   in the behavior over and over.
[00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:43.020]   That's extending the arc of that dopamine release.
[00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:45.380]   As well, it offsets some of the pain
[00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:48.620]   of not having that experience occur
[00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:50.200]   over and over and over again.
[00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:51.740]   Now, for the high performers out there,
[00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:53.340]   you're probably familiar with this.
[00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:55.080]   Many people who have a big achievement,
[00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:56.980]   their first thoughts are, well, now what?
[00:20:56.980 --> 00:20:57.940]   What am I going to do next?
[00:20:57.940 --> 00:20:59.140]   How am I ever going to exceed that?
[00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:01.740]   And indeed, many people who are very high
[00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:03.420]   on this kind of dopamine sensation
[00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:06.500]   and novelty-seeking scale are prone to addiction.
[00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:09.340]   They're prone to the rabid pursuit of external goals,
[00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:12.940]   of exteroception, to the neglect of these internal mechanisms
[00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:14.980]   that allow them to feel calm and happy.
[00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:17.960]   So for people that are very driven, very motivated,
[00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:21.180]   adopting a practice of being able to engage
[00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:23.740]   in the here and now, the sort of almond-type practices
[00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:27.600]   we talked about earlier of learning how to achieve
[00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:29.940]   a really good night's sleep on a regular basis
[00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:31.980]   through tools and mechanisms I talked about
[00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:34.740]   on previous podcasts, gives a sort of balance
[00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:38.540]   to the pleasure-seeking and offsetting of pain
[00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:40.580]   and the pleasure in the here and now.
[00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:42.260]   So pleasure is really two things.
[00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:46.580]   It's a joy in pursuit, but it's also the joy
[00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:48.100]   in what you have.
[00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:50.800]   The cool thing is you can actually regulate
[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:55.100]   this whole system in a way that will steer you
[00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:57.840]   or lean you towards more positive anticipation
[00:21:57.840 --> 00:21:59.840]   of things in life and less disappointment.
[00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:01.380]   It's simply a matter of adjusting
[00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:03.980]   what we call the dopamine schedule.
[00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:06.620]   In order to understand how to control the dopamine system,
[00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:08.900]   how to leverage it for a better life,
[00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:11.680]   you need to understand the results
[00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:13.440]   of a very important experiment.
[00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:17.780]   This experiment was able to separate
[00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:19.960]   pleasure from motivation.
[00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:23.540]   It's a very simple, but like many simple experiments,
[00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:25.820]   a very elegant experiment.
[00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:27.380]   What they did, and this has now been done
[00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:32.160]   in animals and in humans, they offered rats food.
[00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:34.600]   It was a food that they particularly liked.
[00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:37.340]   And the animals would lever press for a pellet of food,
[00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:38.660]   kind of classic experiment.
[00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:41.940]   They'd eat the food, and they presumably liked the food
[00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:45.060]   because they were motivated to press the lever and eat it.
[00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:46.020]   Great.
[00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:47.400]   They took other rats.
[00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:50.720]   They eliminated the dopamine neurons.
[00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:52.760]   You can do this by injection of a neurotoxin
[00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:54.500]   that destroys these neurons.
[00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:56.760]   So they actually had no dopamine in their brain.
[00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:59.320]   They have no ability to release dopamine.
[00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:01.760]   And they gave them a lever.
[00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:03.440]   The rats would sit there and they'd hit the lever
[00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:04.360]   and they'd eat the food.
[00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:06.660]   They're still enjoyed the food.
[00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:08.560]   So you say, well, okay,
[00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:10.440]   so dopamine isn't involved in motivation.
[00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:11.800]   It isn't involved in pleasure.
[00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:13.820]   No, it absolutely is.
[00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:16.080]   They could still enjoy the food,
[00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:19.820]   but if they moved the rat literally one body length
[00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:21.580]   away from the lever,
[00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:23.620]   what they found was the animals that had dopamine
[00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:25.700]   would move over to the lever, press it and eat.
[00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:28.620]   And the ones, the rats that did not have dopamine
[00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:32.420]   available to them wouldn't even move one body length,
[00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:35.900]   one rat length to the lever in order to press it
[00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:36.980]   and get the food.
[00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:40.060]   Dopamine therefore is not about the ability
[00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:41.740]   to experience pleasure.
[00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:44.180]   It is about motivation for pleasure.
[00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:46.260]   And so many of you are probably thinking,
[00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:48.160]   wow, I'm not a very motivated person.
[00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:49.200]   Like you talked about the one kind
[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:50.360]   of procrastination earlier.
[00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:53.640]   What about when I just feel kind of meh about life?
[00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:54.900]   Now, for some of you,
[00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:56.500]   there may be a real clinical depression
[00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:57.940]   and you should talk to a professional.
[00:23:57.940 --> 00:24:00.420]   There are very good prescription drugs
[00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:02.120]   that can really help people.
[00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:06.280]   There's also great non-drug treatments of psychotherapy
[00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:08.560]   and other treatments that are being developed
[00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:09.760]   in addition to psychotherapy
[00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:12.340]   and the various kinds of psychoanalysis, et cetera,
[00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:13.600]   that one can use.
[00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:15.120]   I think the data really point to the fact
[00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:17.680]   that a combination of pharmacology
[00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:20.440]   and talk therapies are generally best.
[00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:22.000]   And there are a huge range of these things.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.560]   I know many of you are in these professions.
[00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:25.360]   We're not going to talk about that right now.
[00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:27.360]   There is a compound that's kind of interesting
[00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:31.360]   in the supplement space that isn't Mucunipurine L-DOPA.
[00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:35.560]   It's not L-tyrosine that isn't promoting
[00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:39.160]   massive releases of dopamine or even dopamine alone,
[00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:41.760]   but a combination of dopamine and serotonin.
[00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:43.520]   And it's an intriguing molecule.
[00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:45.200]   It's sold over the counter.
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:48.800]   Again, you have to check with your healthcare provider
[00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:50.820]   before you would take anything or remove anything.
[00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:51.960]   That's very important.
[00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:56.960]   But it's phenyl ethyl amine or PEA.
[00:24:56.960 --> 00:25:01.960]   PEA or beta phenyl ethyl amine releases dopamine
[00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:06.640]   at low levels, but also serotonin at low level.
[00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:10.600]   So it's kind of a cocktail of the motivation molecules
[00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:13.760]   as well as the quote unquote here and now molecules.
[00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:17.640]   And people's response to this varies widely,
[00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:20.840]   but many people report feeling heightened sense
[00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:23.240]   of mental acuity, wellbeing, et cetera.
[00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:24.960]   It is a bit of a stimulant,
[00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:27.120]   like anything that triggers activation of the dopamine
[00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:28.760]   and norepinephrine pathway,
[00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:30.280]   but it is an interesting supplement.
[00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:32.480]   So now let's talk about what is a dopamine schedule
[00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:34.580]   and how you can leverage this
[00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:37.480]   in order to have heightened levels of motivation,
[00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:39.720]   but not get so much dopamine that you're experiencing
[00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:41.120]   a crash afterwards.
[00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:43.680]   And also so that you can experience heightened pleasure
[00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:47.040]   from the various pursuits that you are engaged in in life.
[00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:48.760]   And here's the key principle.
[00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:52.840]   Dopamine is very subjective,
[00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:55.080]   meaning you can either allow yourself
[00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:58.000]   to experience the pleasure of reaching a milestone
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.120]   of achieving or some craving or not.
[00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:05.040]   It's actually pretty powerful what one can do
[00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:06.720]   with the subjective system.
[00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:08.760]   In fact, I'm going to describe you an experiment
[00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:12.400]   that highlights just how powerful the subjective readout
[00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:14.220]   or the subjective interpretation
[00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:15.840]   of a given experience really can be,
[00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:18.200]   even at the level of pharmacology.
[00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:19.600]   And the title of the experiment
[00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:22.520]   is "Expectation for Stimulant Type,
[00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:26.200]   Modifies Caffeine's Effects on Mood and Cognition."
[00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:27.800]   This was done in college students.
[00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:29.560]   It's a fascinating study.
[00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:34.200]   What they did is they gave college students
[00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:37.920]   either placebo, essentially nothing,
[00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:39.680]   or 200 milligrams of caffeine.
[00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:42.120]   200 milligrams of caffeine is about what's in
[00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:44.280]   a typical coffee, like a medium coffee
[00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:46.160]   that you would buy, a drip coffee.
[00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:50.600]   So they took 65 undergraduate students in college.
[00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:54.160]   They randomized them to either placebo or caffeine.
[00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:57.680]   And they told them that they were either getting caffeine
[00:26:57.680 --> 00:26:59.120]   or Adderall.
[00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:01.880]   Now, Adderall cognitively carries
[00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:05.280]   a very different expectation.
[00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:06.720]   College students know Adderall
[00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:09.260]   to be a much stronger stimulant than caffeine.
[00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:11.560]   They know it to create a sort of high.
[00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:13.320]   This is the way the students described it.
[00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:16.500]   And they thought that it would increase their level of focus
[00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:18.200]   and their ability to perform work.
[00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:21.600]   So what's really interesting is there was definitely
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:23.500]   an effect of placebo versus caffeine.
[00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:25.200]   That's not surprising, however, right?
[00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:29.000]   You take a placebo, you may or may not feel more alert,
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:30.480]   but you take 200 milligrams of caffeine,
[00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:32.180]   very likely you're going to feel very alert.
[00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:35.660]   But there was also an effect of whether or not
[00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:38.800]   the students thought they were getting caffeine or Adderall.
[00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:41.340]   The subjects receiving caffeine reported feeling
[00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:43.640]   more stimulated, anxious, and motivated
[00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:46.040]   than the subjects that received the placebo, okay.
[00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:48.000]   But the ones that expected Adderall
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.040]   reported stronger amphetamine effects.
[00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:53.280]   They performed better on a working memory test.
[00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:58.240]   And in general, they had all the increased cognitive effects
[00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:00.320]   that would have been seen with Adderall,
[00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:02.760]   but they were only ingesting caffeine.
[00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:04.840]   So it led to heightened performance
[00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:06.560]   simply because the students thought
[00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:08.160]   they were getting Adderall.
[00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:09.520]   And I think this is very important
[00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:11.440]   because I think that it points to the fact
[00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:14.240]   that the top down,
[00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:16.160]   the kind of higher level cognitive processes
[00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:19.640]   are impacting even the most basic fundamental aspects
[00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:23.420]   of say dopamine release or adrenaline release
[00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:24.720]   or epinephrine release in ways
[00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:27.000]   that can positively impact performance.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.760]   In this case, it was a positive improvement
[00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:30.640]   in working memory and focus.
[00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:34.060]   So today we've talked a lot about the dopamine system
[00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:36.000]   and those kinds of schedules
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.360]   that will allow craving or addiction,
[00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:41.400]   but what's the schedule of dopamine
[00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:43.440]   that's going to allow you to maximize
[00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:46.960]   on your pursuit of pleasure and your elimination of pain?
[00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:49.560]   And we get the answer to that
[00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:52.920]   from our good friend gambling.
[00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:54.480]   The reason gambling works,
[00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:56.680]   the reason why people will throw their lives away,
[00:28:56.680 --> 00:29:00.440]   the reason why people go back again and again and again
[00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:03.780]   to places like Las Vegas and Atlantic City
[00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:06.840]   is because of the hope and anticipation.
[00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:09.920]   Those are cities and places built on dopamine.
[00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:11.920]   They are leveraging your dopamine system.
[00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:13.040]   And as a friend of mine
[00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:15.680]   who's a certified addiction treatment specialist
[00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:19.060]   tells me that gambling addiction is a particularly sinister
[00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:21.980]   because the next time really could be
[00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:23.440]   the thing that changes everything.
[00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:24.520]   Unlike other addictions,
[00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:26.200]   the next time really could change everything
[00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:28.640]   and that's embedded in the mind of the gambling addict.
[00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:31.000]   And rarely does it work out
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.320]   in favor of the wellbeing of the gambling addict
[00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:34.940]   and their family.
[00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:38.200]   However, the intermittent reinforcement schedule
[00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:41.420]   was discovered long ago by scientific researchers.
[00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:44.060]   So this is the slot machine that every once in a while
[00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:45.980]   gives you a win to keep you playing.
[00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:49.620]   This is the probability of winning on the craps table
[00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:51.460]   or the roulette table or at blackjack
[00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:54.380]   just often enough that you're willing to buy tickets,
[00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:55.940]   head out there, play again,
[00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:57.400]   go downstairs again from your room
[00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:59.140]   even though you swore you were done for the night.
[00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:02.700]   Intermittent reinforcement is the most powerful form
[00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:05.980]   of dopamine reward schedule to keep you doing something.
[00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:09.320]   So we can export that, we can use it for good.
[00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:11.060]   If there's something that you're pursuing in life,
[00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:12.900]   whether or not it's an academic goal
[00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:15.220]   or a financial goal or relationship goal,
[00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:17.740]   one of the things that you can do
[00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:20.580]   to ensure that you will remain on the path to that goal
[00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:21.860]   for a very long time
[00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:23.020]   and that you will continue
[00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:25.320]   to exceed your previous performance
[00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:28.300]   as well as continue to enjoy the dopamine release
[00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:30.360]   that occurs when you hit the milestones
[00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:32.140]   that you want to achieve
[00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:37.140]   is to occasionally remove rewards subjectively.
[00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:39.980]   Let's say you set out a goal of making,
[00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:41.100]   I'm going to make this quantitative
[00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:42.260]   with respect to finances
[00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:43.820]   'cause it just is an easy description,
[00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:46.720]   but this could also be in sport, this could be in school,
[00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:47.560]   this could be in music,
[00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:49.420]   could be in anything, creative endeavors.
[00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:51.660]   But let's say you set out a certain financial goal
[00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:53.680]   or let's say you want to get a certain number of followers
[00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:56.220]   on whatever social media platform.
[00:30:56.220 --> 00:30:58.780]   As you reach each one of those goals,
[00:30:58.780 --> 00:31:01.240]   you should know now that the amount of dopamine
[00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:02.220]   is not going to peak,
[00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:04.940]   it's actually going to diminish and make you crave more.
[00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:07.580]   The key to avoiding that crash,
[00:31:07.580 --> 00:31:09.140]   but to still keep it in healthy levels
[00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:11.260]   that will allow you to continue your pursuit
[00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:14.500]   is as you are staircasing toward your goal,
[00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:17.220]   you actually want to blunt the reward response
[00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:19.820]   for some of those intermediate goals.
[00:31:19.820 --> 00:31:21.900]   Now, I'm not telling you you shouldn't celebrate your wins,
[00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:24.440]   but I'm telling you not to celebrate all of them.
[00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:27.420]   Or as a good friend of mine who recently,
[00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:30.380]   fortunately for him, had a great financial success,
[00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:32.360]   he asked me and somebody else,
[00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:33.280]   a good friend of mine,
[00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:36.080]   who's very tuned into dopamine reward schedules,
[00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:38.200]   understands how they work at a really deep level.
[00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:40.040]   And he said, "I don't know what to do next."
[00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:42.120]   And we said, "Oh, well, that's simple.
[00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:44.040]   You should just give most of it away."
[00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:47.240]   And this wasn't a ploy to receive any of the money ourselves,
[00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:51.040]   this was really about reducing the impact of that reward.
[00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:52.720]   Now, hopefully giving him money away
[00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:54.280]   if you already have enough of it
[00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:57.600]   would be something that was rewarding in and of itself.
[00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:01.200]   But if you're a student who's pursuing goals in university,
[00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:03.960]   or you're an athlete who's pursuing goals,
[00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:07.280]   it actually makes sense from a rational perspective,
[00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:09.520]   once you understand these mechanisms,
[00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:13.440]   to hit a new high point of performance,
[00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:15.480]   or to get that A-plus or for you,
[00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:17.800]   if it's an A-minus, et cetera,
[00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:20.200]   and to tell yourself, "Okay, that was good."
[00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:23.340]   But to actually actively blunt the reward,
[00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:26.820]   to not go and celebrate too intensely.
[00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:28.020]   Because in doing that,
[00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:30.440]   you keep your dopamine system in check,
[00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:33.000]   and you ensure that you're going to stay on the path
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.120]   of continued pursuit,
[00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:36.160]   not just for that thing, but for all things.
[00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:39.960]   Big increases in dopamine lead to big crashes in dopamine,
[00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:42.820]   and big increases in dopamine up the ante.
[00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:47.280]   So you can lift what Las Vegas and Atlantic City
[00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:50.400]   and other gambling mechanisms
[00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:51.800]   and places have known for a long time.
[00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:53.120]   They lifted it from the scientists.
[00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:54.520]   You can now take it back,
[00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:56.200]   and you can start to leverage that.
[00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:57.680]   And you just make it intermittent.
[00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:00.500]   You reward yourself, not on a predictable schedule.
[00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:01.920]   So not every other time,
[00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:03.600]   or every third time, or every 10th time,
[00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:04.940]   but sometimes it's three in a row,
[00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:07.040]   then not at all for 10 days.
[00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:09.640]   So reward is important.
[00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:11.560]   Self-reward is critically important,
[00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:13.560]   but make sure that you're not doing it
[00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:15.840]   on such a predictable schedule,
[00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:18.760]   that you burn out these dopamine circuits,
[00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:20.840]   or that you undercut your own ability
[00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:23.520]   to strive and achieve.
[00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:25.520]   Hopefully you now know far more
[00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:29.000]   about the dopamine system, reward, and motivation
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.600]   than you did at the beginning of this podcast.
[00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:33.280]   Hopefully you also understand
[00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:35.480]   the other side of dopamine and reward,
[00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:38.920]   which is pain and the balance of this pleasure-pain system,
[00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:41.840]   as well as the molecules that we call,
[00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:44.360]   or that were described in the "Molecule of More" book,
[00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:46.560]   I should say, as the here and now molecules,
[00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:49.240]   things like serotonin and the endocannabinoids.
[00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:50.440]   Finally, I want to thank you
[00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:52.120]   for your time and attention today.
[00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:53.520]   I hope you learned a lot
[00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:55.800]   and that you learned a lot of possible tools
[00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:57.800]   that you could incorporate into your life
[00:33:57.800 --> 00:34:01.280]   as it relates to motivation and emotions.
[00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:03.280]   Thank you for your interest in science.
