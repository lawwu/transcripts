[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540]   Unwrap the holiday savings at Citadel Outlets.
[00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.620]   Shop the early access Black Friday sales
[00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:07.340]   for the best deals of the season.
[00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:08.880]   The all night shopping party starts
[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.040]   Thanksgiving night at 8 p.m.
[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.080]   Visit CitadelOutlets.com for more information.
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.420]   - Okay, okay, okay, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine.
[00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.540]   After dozens and dozens of requests,
[00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.700]   I'll do the show for you.
[00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.620]   What is Joshua's advice for how to get
[00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:28.300]   into the financial planning field?
[00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.260]   That's today, I give you my thoughts.
[00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.840]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:48.420]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.660]   My name is Joshua Sheets.
[00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.020]   Today is Thursday, January 22, 2015.
[00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.380]   This is the show where we talk about
[00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.320]   all things financial planning,
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.820]   both from a consumer perspective
[00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.260]   and also from a professional perspective.
[00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.560]   No secrets here.
[00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:03.760]   Everything I know I'll give you
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.380]   from either side of the table.
[00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.940]   And today I answer probably one of the more
[00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.160]   asked questions that I get.
[00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.240]   How would I get into financial planning
[00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.340]   if I were interested?
[00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.920]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.140]   I really have been asked this question
[00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.020]   at least a few dozen times.
[00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.340]   And I've been meaning to do a show on it.
[00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.420]   And I've done some, I've skirted around the issue
[00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:26.740]   a little bit.
[00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.700]   But today I'm gonna tackle it straight on.
[00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.740]   And I'm gonna try to give you my perspective,
[00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.620]   my opinions, my advice on getting into this industry
[00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.460]   and getting into this field.
[00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:37.700]   Now you need to recognize, however,
[00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.780]   that this is my opinion and my experience.
[00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.960]   And my experience is limited.
[00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.140]   But I'll do my best to give you some thoughts.
[00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.500]   And essentially this is the speech that I would give you
[00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.940]   if we were sitting down having a drink together
[00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.420]   and you wanted to get into the financial planning business
[00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.380]   and we're interested in how to approach it.
[00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.100]   As we start, let me give you a brief view
[00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.380]   into some of the types of emails that I get.
[00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.940]   I've chosen four to read to you.
[00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.580]   And I've trimmed them a little bit for time
[00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:04.420]   and for content.
[00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.300]   But let me just give you an idea.
[00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.580]   The first two are interesting.
[00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:08.660]   The first one comes from Jordan
[00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.160]   and the second one comes from Tim.
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.340]   These came in to my email inbox
[00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.260]   within 45 minutes of each other over the Christmas break.
[00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.100]   (laughing)
[00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.940]   And I was fascinated by these questions
[00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.820]   and just how similar they were
[00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.000]   and how close they were in time.
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:25.480]   Question from Jordan.
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.240]   Hey, Joshua, I consider personal finance
[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.600]   and financial planning a hobby
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.320]   and I dole out my amateur advice
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.720]   to friends, colleagues, and family.
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:34.620]   A little bit of background.
[00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.100]   I'm 25 years old and currently working as an auditor
[00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.000]   in the big four in my third year
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.880]   and I've just been early promoted to senior associate.
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.960]   The thing is I don't see myself auditing forever
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.140]   and I really want to get into financial planning.
[00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.840]   My plan is to start taking the courses for the CFP
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.100]   in May and June of 2015 after my busy season is over.
[00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.960]   I feel secure in my job but I just don't love it.
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.680]   Do you have any advice for a 20-something
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.840]   wanting to transition to a career in financial planning
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.740]   with zero experience?
[00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.960]   Next question, 45 minutes later.
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.160]   Hey, Joshua, I'm writing because I'd love to get your insight
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.400]   in a career as a financial advisor.
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.640]   A little background on myself.
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.620]   I'm a 28-year-old CPA who has worked as an auditor
[00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.400]   at a large CPA firm for the past four years.
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.120]   I've been thinking about making a career change
[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.320]   and given my interests, I've begun looking
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.400]   into possibly starting a career as a financial advisor.
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.840]   I really enjoy the technical side of financial planning,
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.800]   including the tax side of planning,
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.160]   but I'm also enjoying learning
[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.720]   about the investing side as well.
[00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.400]   In talking with a few other people,
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.360]   I have heard that being a financial advisor
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.280]   is basically a sales job where you are asked
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.920]   to utilize your own contacts to push financial products on.
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.560]   What I have heard is basically the only way to make money
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.600]   is to have rich friends or family to get established.
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.280]   I really like the fact that I could be helping people
[00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.760]   but the cold calling and pushing financial products
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.240]   on people does not sound appealing.
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.080]   Also, I don't believe I have the wealthy contacts needed
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.500]   to get established.
[00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.400]   I would love to get your insight on this matter
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.600]   and to hear if the stories I hear about careers
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.720]   as a financial advisor are correct.
[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.680]   Additionally, I'd love to hear any recommendations
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.700]   you would have for somebody looking to get into a career
[00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:12.840]   as a financial advisor.
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:13.900]   Thanks, Tim.
[00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.880]   I guess the auditing community is gonna be losing
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.560]   a couple of its good representatives.
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.240]   Next email from Eric.
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.080]   Hi, Josh.
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.240]   In 2013, I became completely obsessed
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.920]   with all things finance.
[00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.140]   I first picked up books about stock picking
[00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.000]   because I thought that was the way to go.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.760]   But within a month or two, I was recommended
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.960]   the Intelligent Investor and I've been going
[00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.160]   with the Boglehead strategy since then.
[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.800]   I've been very lucky in getting a job
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.600]   straight out of college that pays quite well
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.440]   in the software industry and since I started in July 2013,
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.440]   I've saved 70 to 80% of my take home income.
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.760]   I figure within 2015, I will become
[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.240]   financially independent at age 25.
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.920]   I've been listening to your podcast daily
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.520]   since I discovered it last month
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.800]   and needless to say, it has quickly become
[00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.280]   my favorite podcast.
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.580]   Keep up the awesome work.
[00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.600]   I listen to every new episode.
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.560]   I am interested in becoming a fee-only financial planner.
[00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.800]   Every time I get the opportunity to talk with someone
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.720]   who is also interested in finance,
[00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.340]   believe me, this is super rare, I get very excited.
[00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:15.640]   Nothing makes me happier, basically.
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.000]   I have a bachelor's degree in computer engineering
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.960]   right now.
[00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.280]   I'm wondering, what is the shortest path
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.880]   that I could take to get to the place
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.520]   where I can hang out a shingle
[00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:27.280]   and start advising people for a small fee?
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.560]   I am not interested in charging for assets under management.
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.280]   I simply want to share knowledge with people
[00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:33.840]   so they can make their own investments
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.380]   and financial decisions.
[00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:38.600]   I want to do the opposite of most advisors, basically.
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.440]   I'd be okay charging very little money
[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.200]   for just a consultation because I will be
[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.660]   financially independent.
[00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:45.320]   You mentioned in one episode that you got
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.040]   a master's degree in financial planning
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:49.560]   and I know you need the CFP certification.
[00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.240]   With just my bachelor's degree, could I get this CFP
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:53.560]   and start taking on clients?
[00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.920]   Or would I need other certifications as well?
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:57.280]   Thanks, Eric.
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:01.440]   And those are representative of many emails that I get.
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.000]   And then I'll finish with a fourth one here,
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.740]   just a different life situation.
[00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:09.000]   I've gotten a few different ones from clients,
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.160]   or from prospective clients.
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.960]   I've gotten one from men, from women.
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.000]   These are from three young men.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.360]   And this one is from an older man,
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.600]   but I've gotten a couple from some ladies
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.700]   who are kind of mid-career and they've asked me
[00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:20.760]   this question.
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.580]   And so here would be another example
[00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:23.960]   of a different take on the question.
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:25.760]   And this one wasn't a specific question,
[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:26.920]   it was part of an email exchange
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.320]   that I was having with a listener.
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.920]   Listener says, Joshua, I've realized over time
[00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.920]   that I'm a poor candidate for the traditional
[00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:34.200]   early retirement.
[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:38.160]   And instead, I would like to focus my next 15 to 17 years,
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:42.880]   roughly ages 52 to 67, on doing something that I like.
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.160]   This person was actually a practicing physician.
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.060]   Be it as an administrator in a medical business
[00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:49.840]   that I believe in, being a health coach
[00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:52.160]   for middle-aged guys trying to get back into shape,
[00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:54.560]   or opening a gelato shop in my neighborhood.
[00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.040]   Actually, my dream job would probably be selling tickets
[00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:00.480]   in a booth at a ski resort, but maybe later on that one.
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:04.080]   I've also thought about becoming a personal finance coach
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.300]   or advisor for doctors.
[00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.280]   I see them make stupid mistakes all the time.
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:11.200]   I could probably do a series of podcasts
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.520]   on stupid things my partners have done.
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:16.720]   Perhaps you could help me get that one off the ground.
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:17.560]   All the best.
[00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:21.040]   And again, this was a man who is a physician.
[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:23.720]   So, these are representative,
[00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:27.520]   and I should have included in my preparing for the show
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:28.880]   just a few of the ones from the ladies,
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:30.760]   and I get yelled at from you guys.
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:35.600]   It's not just a male, it is a male-dominated industry,
[00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:38.460]   but there are more and more ladies who are getting into it.
[00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:40.880]   Some of the most effective financial advisors
[00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:43.520]   that I've ever worked with have been ladies.
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:46.640]   So, it's an interesting question,
[00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:48.840]   'cause all of these come at it from a different angle.
[00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:53.400]   And so, I wanna talk about just some different,
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:54.820]   I'm gonna talk a little bit about
[00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:59.820]   the way the financial advice industry is currently.
[00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:02.880]   And one of the things I'm most excited about
[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:07.880]   is today, in 2015, there is no one model
[00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:10.680]   which is gonna be the most effective
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.680]   or the most important.
[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:16.740]   There are many models that are emerging,
[00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:19.360]   and especially with some of the changes in technology,
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:22.120]   there are some new models being tested.
[00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:24.060]   I'm excited about some of the new models
[00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:25.000]   that are being tested.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.360]   And I think we need, frankly, I think we need more models.
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:30.480]   And I'm excited about seeing and helping those develop,
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:33.280]   profiling people who are trying new things
[00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:36.760]   and building new ways of working with clients.
[00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:39.080]   The key is to understand the different models
[00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:41.800]   and approaches to a financial planning practice
[00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:43.620]   that are available, and then figure out
[00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:45.820]   which one will be effective for you.
[00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:49.080]   There are actually many historical models
[00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:52.800]   that are time-honored and still work,
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:54.560]   and then there are some brand new ones.
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:56.920]   One of the oldest models of giving financial advice
[00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:01.360]   is the model of a traditional life insurance agent.
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:04.520]   Years, I mean, back in the 1800s
[00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:06.880]   was when life insurance first started to be developed.
[00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:08.360]   Life insurance companies were started,
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:11.400]   and at that time, there were life insurance agents
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:14.440]   riding around on horseback from farm to farm to farm,
[00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:18.520]   selling the farmers and their families
[00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:20.160]   life insurance policies.
[00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:21.640]   And as far as I'm concerned,
[00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:26.080]   that was an amazingly valuable service,
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:27.680]   and that was financial planning.
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:31.400]   Now, today, there are many fewer people doing that,
[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.040]   but there's nothing, in my opinion,
[00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:34.260]   that has changed about the model
[00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.000]   that makes the idea and the model
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.880]   of being a life insurance agent less relevant.
[00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:40.720]   I'm gonna talk in detail about some different ways
[00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:42.800]   that that can be approached even today.
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:44.960]   You also traditionally had a stockbroker,
[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:47.960]   and so a stockbroker historically was one
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:52.500]   who helped handle the transaction in individual securities.
[00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:55.440]   Now, that changed, that model was destroyed over time,
[00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:58.000]   and so many stockbrokers moved on
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.560]   to managing some portfolios, choosing individual stocks.
[00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:03.480]   That model, as far as I can tell,
[00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:07.040]   has pretty much been destroyed by the mutual fund industry.
[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:10.200]   So many stockbrokers have moved on to selling mutual funds.
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:12.960]   That model is quickly disappearing,
[00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:16.360]   the sale of mutual funds for a commission.
[00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:19.440]   Charles Schwab, was it Schwab who destroyed that business
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:24.440]   with his mutual fund supermarket back in the day?
[00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:27.840]   I mean, some of these models have just changed over time.
[00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:31.080]   The index fund has taken a serious bite
[00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:34.960]   out of the actively managed fund marketplace.
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:39.080]   The hedge fund industry has taken a lot of some business
[00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:40.920]   away from the mutual fund industry.
[00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:43.640]   So the idea of selling mutual funds for a commission,
[00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:45.560]   this has changed, although there are plenty
[00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:46.660]   of people still doing this,
[00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:48.760]   but that has certainly changed the model.
[00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:52.440]   And now, the most popular model is to do fee-based
[00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:56.160]   or fee-only planning, where instead of being paid commissions
[00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:57.320]   off of the sale of investments,
[00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:59.540]   you are billing fees to the account.
[00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:02.520]   But all of these are some variation of financial planning,
[00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:03.340]   even accounting.
[00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:07.760]   Historically, you would have a time-honored model
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:09.240]   of working as an accountant,
[00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:13.120]   perhaps a tax planner where you are working
[00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:15.160]   and preparing individual tax returns,
[00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:17.260]   corporate tax returns, giving tax advice
[00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:18.400]   and accounting services.
[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:20.400]   And that's absolutely financial planning.
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:24.280]   In fact, today in 2015, the most trusted advisor
[00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:27.040]   for most people who are wealthy
[00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:29.160]   is generally their accountant.
[00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:32.320]   Many of us who came in from the product side,
[00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:35.480]   the life insurance side or the investment side,
[00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:38.400]   have often been jealous of accountants.
[00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:42.000]   And I know several friends who started as tax preparers
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.280]   and have added on financial products to their business.
[00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:48.760]   Now, financial planning as its own discipline
[00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:53.320]   is still extremely young as a professional discipline,
[00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:54.360]   but it's emerging.
[00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:55.960]   And it started largely, if you're interested,
[00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:58.600]   to go back and listen to the episode with Michael Kitsis
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:01.240]   in the archives.
[00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:06.240]   And that episode number is episode 92.
[00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:09.940]   So you can find that at radicalpersonalfinance.com/92.
[00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:12.860]   But Kitsis and I tried to talk a lot about the history
[00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:14.100]   of the financial planning industry.
[00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:15.900]   And we tried to be very,
[00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:20.200]   there were no curtain held there,
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.400]   just simply we talked about the history
[00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:22.240]   and the different models
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:24.240]   and different things that are there.
[00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:26.440]   And so financial planning,
[00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:28.560]   it originally kind of started to be developed
[00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:31.240]   largely as a way to sell more product.
[00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:33.360]   It was added on as a benefit.
[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:36.200]   But frankly, I think the best product salespeople
[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:40.400]   have largely always been great financial planners.
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:42.800]   I think of two specific people
[00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:45.800]   that I have read a lot of their work.
[00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:47.360]   The more recent of the two was a man,
[00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:50.340]   he just died a year ago, a couple of years ago,
[00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:51.720]   named Al Granum.
[00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:55.360]   Al is a legend in the life insurance business.
[00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:58.200]   He originally started with Northwestern Mutual
[00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:00.080]   as a young man.
[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:03.360]   He built one of the most successful life insurance agencies
[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:07.320]   while Northwestern Mutual history
[00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:09.320]   and Northwestern in industry history.
[00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:13.420]   And he perfected a sales system called the one card system,
[00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:14.720]   which is a subject for another day.
[00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:17.020]   But it was actually the system that I was trained on
[00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:18.520]   as a new life insurance agent.
[00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:20.080]   And it was basically a system
[00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:22.000]   of measuring your daily activity,
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.320]   where you tracked how many phone calls you made,
[00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:27.280]   how many people you saw, what you did on a daily basis.
[00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:29.160]   And he probably has had a bigger impact
[00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:32.360]   on the life insurance industry than just about anybody else.
[00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:35.800]   But if you go back and you read his books that he wrote,
[00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:38.760]   he has one that is, I would say,
[00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:40.620]   is a mandatory must read for anybody
[00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:43.200]   who's interested in building a financial services practice.
[00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:46.760]   That book is called "Building a Financial Services Clientele,"
[00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:48.200]   I think is what it's entitled.
[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:49.720]   And he goes through the entire process
[00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:52.760]   of how to start from nothing to today.
[00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:57.760]   But he's had a bigger impact on just about anybody than,
[00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:00.920]   excuse me, he's had a bigger impact on the industry
[00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:02.800]   than just about anybody else.
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:06.160]   But he was absolutely a financial planner,
[00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:07.580]   just wasn't called that.
[00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:09.600]   But the point was he was finding out
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:10.740]   what people's goals were,
[00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:12.160]   what they were trying to accomplish,
[00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:14.380]   and then helping to solve those goals.
[00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:17.500]   And the solutions involved financial products.
[00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:18.640]   That's how people often forget,
[00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:20.280]   and which I'm gonna get to in just a minute
[00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:23.160]   about the connection between selling.
[00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:25.280]   We all have financial products,
[00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:28.200]   and I'm gonna talk about professional selling in a minute.
[00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:30.360]   But it's very difficult to,
[00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:32.000]   we can't solve our financial needs
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.960]   without some sort of financial product.
[00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:36.480]   That may be a savings account that's offered by your bank,
[00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:39.740]   a CD that's offered by your bank or by a brokerage firm.
[00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:41.760]   It may be some gold coins that you buy
[00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:43.440]   from a local coin dealer,
[00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:47.220]   or some, I don't know, some silver bullion
[00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:49.120]   that you hold offshore with somebody
[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:50.640]   that advertises over the internet.
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:53.520]   That might be a mutual fund
[00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:55.560]   that's run by a mutual fund company,
[00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:56.840]   a life insurance policy
[00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:58.840]   that's run by a life insurance company.
[00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:01.420]   The financial products, we all consume them.
[00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:05.200]   And so Al Granum was, in his day,
[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:10.200]   was a comprehensive financial planner,
[00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:13.480]   even though I doubt that he personally
[00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:15.200]   ever worked with investments.
[00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:19.960]   He was almost surely primarily working with insurance.
[00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:21.360]   The other person that I think of
[00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:22.760]   is a man named Ben Feldman.
[00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:26.040]   And to the best of my knowledge, Ben still holds the,
[00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:28.320]   or he's dead now, he died 10 years ago,
[00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:30.440]   but he still holds the title
[00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:34.480]   as the world's greatest life insurance salesperson.
[00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:36.880]   He worked with New York Life,
[00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:40.320]   which is another amazing insurance company
[00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:42.400]   with a tremendous history.
[00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:44.480]   And he sold, let's see,
[00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:46.120]   he sold, I pulled up his Wikipedia page,
[00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:49.560]   he sold $1.8 billion worth of life insurance
[00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:54.400]   for New York Life from 1942 through 1993.
[00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:57.820]   And he once held the world record
[00:15:57.820 --> 00:16:00.860]   for the most products sold by value
[00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:02.560]   by a salesperson in a career,
[00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:04.840]   in his total career.
[00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:07.720]   In a year, he sold $100 million of life insurance in a year,
[00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:08.560]   and in a single day,
[00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:11.260]   he sold $20 million of life insurance.
[00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:14.440]   And so now to put that into context,
[00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:17.880]   in Ben Feldman's day as an active producer,
[00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:20.320]   there's an organization in the life insurance industry
[00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:21.960]   called Million Dollar Roundtable.
[00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:22.920]   And it's titled that
[00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:25.720]   because to sell a million dollars worth of insurance
[00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:28.320]   in a year was a massive achievement,
[00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:30.160]   a million dollars worth of total,
[00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:32.320]   what we call in the insurance business, face amount,
[00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:34.920]   total, if you sold $10,000 or a million dollars,
[00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:37.280]   that would count into that million dollar roundtable.
[00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:40.240]   Today, I very rarely, when I was in life insurance,
[00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:41.680]   it was rare for me to sell a policy,
[00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:44.040]   I don't know, less than half a million.
[00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:45.360]   So you could hit a million bucks
[00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:46.880]   with just any normal family.
[00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:48.760]   I'd try to never leave anybody
[00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:51.720]   without at least a million bucks of life insurance.
[00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:53.660]   But back in Ben Feldman's day,
[00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:55.280]   that would have been a year's accomplishment.
[00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:58.520]   So when you put his numbers into inflation adjusted terms,
[00:16:58.520 --> 00:16:59.360]   it was stunning.
[00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:00.560]   So I read a couple of his books
[00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:04.160]   and just understood what he did and how he sold.
[00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:06.040]   And the man was a financial planner.
[00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:08.000]   He was a financial planner.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.880]   Just wasn't called that at the time.
[00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:13.480]   Now in today's world, again,
[00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:16.440]   there's a greater need for financial planning
[00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:19.520]   as its own discipline than there's ever been.
[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:21.760]   Simply because our financial lives
[00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:24.600]   are much more complex than they've ever been.
[00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:26.540]   There are some major trends
[00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:28.800]   that are dramatically pressing,
[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:30.360]   frankly, the global population,
[00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:32.600]   but at least in the United States of America.
[00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:36.600]   One of the biggest ones is the destruction
[00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:39.060]   of the defined benefit pension program.
[00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:42.020]   For many years, people never conceived of retiring.
[00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:44.120]   Then when they did conceive of retiring,
[00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:47.280]   then you could plan on a defined benefit pension
[00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:51.240]   from your company, and those are largely destroyed.
[00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:52.360]   People are living longer
[00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:54.500]   and being responsible for retiring.
[00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:56.360]   There are more financial products
[00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:58.240]   that have been invented and marketed
[00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:00.160]   to individuals than ever before.
[00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:02.560]   And these financial products are more complex
[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:04.680]   than anything in the history of mankind.
[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:06.120]   I mean, you just sit down and try to read,
[00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:07.560]   try to sit down and read a prospectus
[00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:09.320]   for your average mutual fund,
[00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:11.200]   let alone your average variable annuity
[00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:13.740]   or something like an equity indexed annuity.
[00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:15.600]   Just sit down and read the prospectus,
[00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:18.480]   and it's overwhelming.
[00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:20.320]   The tax code is more complex
[00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:22.920]   than it's ever been in the history of mankind.
[00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:25.800]   It's, how many pages is it?
[00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:30.800]   It's over 70,000 pages now, 70,320 pages long,
[00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:34.400]   and more than 3.7 million words.
[00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:37.680]   That's just the tax code, let alone insurance products.
[00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:42.280]   And I could list off 30 different types
[00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:44.440]   of life insurance that exist today.
[00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:46.040]   I could list, I mean, there are dozens
[00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:49.860]   of investment products that have been created.
[00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:51.960]   I mean, we've got, I mean, everyone knows,
[00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:53.400]   okay, we've got open-end mutual funds,
[00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:55.400]   closed-end mutual funds, unit investment trusts,
[00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:57.560]   guaranteed investment contracts.
[00:18:57.560 --> 00:18:58.520]   You've got annuity contracts.
[00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:00.160]   I mean, there's dozens of hedge funds.
[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:02.400]   I mean, just these words, you know,
[00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:04.600]   the word hedge fund has no meaning
[00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:06.880]   other than a general classification,
[00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:09.560]   but there are dozens, you know, all these subtypes.
[00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:11.720]   So the investment marketplace
[00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:13.600]   has gotten more complex than ever,
[00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:16.160]   and the legal code has gotten more complex than ever,
[00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:18.840]   and family situations and planning
[00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:20.800]   has gotten more complex than ever.
[00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:23.840]   In a world where the majority, you know, it seems,
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:26.800]   I think the majority of families are,
[00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:30.840]   where many families are blended families,
[00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:33.380]   and you've got, dad has his two kids
[00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:34.400]   from his first marriage,
[00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:36.420]   and mom has her two kids from her first marriage,
[00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:37.840]   and now there's two kids together,
[00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:40.200]   and we're trying to equalize, you know,
[00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:42.240]   planning and figure out who's gonna care for what,
[00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:44.200]   and who's gonna be this, and who's gonna do that,
[00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:46.720]   the needs for whether you're,
[00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:48.160]   just every aspect of planning
[00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:50.280]   has gotten more and more complex.
[00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:52.880]   And so what, in many days, you know,
[00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:57.880]   if I go back and just paint a very simple picture,
[00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:01.320]   in many ways, all somebody needed in the past
[00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:03.420]   was a few simple products, you know,
[00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:05.320]   long-term care products didn't exist,
[00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:06.740]   disability products didn't exist,
[00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:09.000]   maybe a small life insurance policy
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.360]   for dad and an investment contract,
[00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:12.200]   and the kids were there,
[00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:16.320]   and maybe just some simple blue chip stocks.
[00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:18.720]   The world was relatively simple,
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:21.040]   but now it's incredibly complex.
[00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:23.400]   So I scratch my head to understand
[00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:27.860]   how anybody can possibly get through effectively
[00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:30.580]   this current world without either in-depth
[00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:32.520]   financial knowledge, if you're a do-it-yourselfer,
[00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:36.500]   without a good, caring, trustworthy, trusted advisor.
[00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:40.960]   So financial planning as an independent discipline
[00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:42.960]   has really, really grown.
[00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:45.660]   Now the key is, in the industry,
[00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:48.840]   there has always been specialization.
[00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:51.480]   There have always been boutique,
[00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:53.560]   specialist firms, and consultants,
[00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:57.240]   no matter what aspect of the industry that you look at.
[00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:58.680]   So if you were focused on,
[00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:00.640]   I'll use life insurance as an example,
[00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:04.960]   then life insurance had many different aspects.
[00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:08.340]   There's what I call kitchen table selling,
[00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:10.460]   working with median income,
[00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:13.240]   American households sitting at the kitchen table
[00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:15.120]   on Tuesday night at seven o'clock,
[00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:16.380]   doing a needs analysis,
[00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:18.040]   and figuring out how much life insurance,
[00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:19.880]   and working with individual families
[00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:23.280]   to protect mom, to protect dad in case they die.
[00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:26.800]   There's a whole market of life insurance
[00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:27.980]   that's still very active today.
[00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:29.880]   It's called final expense insurance,
[00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:33.640]   and it's a sale of a life insurance product
[00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:37.720]   that is purely intended to provide a cash payment
[00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:42.280]   for any final expenses, and a burial policy.
[00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:43.200]   This is very active.
[00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:44.840]   There are many life insurance agents
[00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:46.160]   that this is what they do.
[00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:49.760]   It still exists today, believe it or not,
[00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:51.100]   but it used to be much more popular.
[00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:53.000]   I've spoken with life insurance agents
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   who started in this industry.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.320]   There's something called a debit policy,
[00:21:57.320 --> 00:21:58.880]   or industrial life insurance,
[00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:01.360]   and this is essentially where the agent,
[00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:03.280]   a policy would be sold door to door,
[00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:04.480]   and the agent would go by
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:06.320]   and collect the premiums every month.
[00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:09.000]   And I've spoken with agents here where I live
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.720]   who started in this, and they would go every month,
[00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:14.060]   and collect the premium in working class neighborhoods
[00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:15.600]   for just a little bit of money.
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:19.000]   And that has largely collapsed,
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.360]   but it still does exist in a measure.
[00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:24.640]   At the other end of the spectrum,
[00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:26.960]   there have always been firms in life insurance
[00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:30.640]   that specialize in deferred compensation programs,
[00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:31.840]   and defined benefit planning.
[00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:35.480]   If you listened to last week's Q&A shows,
[00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:37.660]   I went through just a rudimentary introduction
[00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:39.780]   to deferred compensation,
[00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:41.440]   and deferred compensation programs
[00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:44.480]   are often funded with life insurance contracts.
[00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:46.080]   So there are specialist firms
[00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:48.580]   that work with large Fortune 500 companies,
[00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:51.320]   and do massive, multi-million dollar
[00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:53.200]   cash value life insurance policies
[00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:55.960]   for the purpose of funding deferred compensation.
[00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:58.040]   And that may be on an individual level,
[00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:00.600]   it may be in the corporate-owned life insurance market,
[00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:02.280]   the Coley market, there are various,
[00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:03.840]   it's a specialized market.
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:05.500]   There's a market of life insurance planning
[00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:07.520]   called BOLI, bank-owned life insurance.
[00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:10.040]   And this today, I have one friend here in West,
[00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:12.240]   two friends that do this, and they are specialists,
[00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:13.480]   and they don't work with anybody locally,
[00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:15.000]   they don't ever work with individuals.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:19.520]   They are exclusively working with bank boards of directors,
[00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:22.680]   and bank executive leadership teams
[00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:26.640]   to put in place large, bank-owned life insurance policies.
[00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:28.980]   And the way these work, if you've never heard of this,
[00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:32.480]   is in essence, the cash values of the policies
[00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:36.040]   form a portion of the bank's cash reserves.
[00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:37.680]   So they get a little bit higher interest on it
[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:40.280]   while still being able to keep their cash reserves on hand,
[00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:42.520]   and they do it through putting policies
[00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:46.060]   on their boards of directors, on their key employees.
[00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:47.760]   It's kind of a unique market.
[00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:49.520]   Someday maybe I'll do a show on it.
[00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:51.720]   You have, to this day, estate planning firms,
[00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:54.200]   boutique estate planning firms that specialize
[00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:55.960]   in only estate planning life insurance.
[00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:58.240]   I have a couple friends, there are several firms here
[00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:00.320]   where I live in the Palm Beach market,
[00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:02.320]   but most of their business is done, frankly,
[00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:04.880]   on a national basis, and they're just as likely
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:09.000]   to fly out to see a large client in Chicago,
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.160]   or fly out to Kansas City,
[00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:12.840]   or to work with this sports team president,
[00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:13.880]   or fly out to California.
[00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:15.700]   I mean, it's a large national market.
[00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:19.440]   So there is always a boutique firm in every industry.
[00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:21.600]   There are occupation-specific niches,
[00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:23.800]   so there are people who have built
[00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:27.040]   financial planning practices that are based upon,
[00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:30.360]   whether it's something as regular as physicians,
[00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:32.680]   or whether it's something like race car drivers.
[00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:34.200]   Doesn't, I mean, it doesn't matter.
[00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:35.880]   There are people who specialize in this.
[00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:38.480]   There are firms that specialize exclusively
[00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:40.480]   in working with celebrity athletes,
[00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:43.280]   and they do comprehensive wealth management
[00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:45.680]   for celebrity assets, excuse me,
[00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:48.360]   celebrity athletes, or movie stars,
[00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:50.240]   or whatever their niche is
[00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:52.120]   that they've figured out how to work in.
[00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:53.920]   There are also firms that,
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:57.520]   instead of marketing to a specific client base,
[00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:59.840]   that have built their practice
[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:02.760]   based upon a certain technical skill.
[00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:04.280]   So perhaps their technical skill
[00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:06.500]   is a certain type of investment management,
[00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:09.760]   or portfolio management, and this would range every bit
[00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:13.280]   from a local $100 million firm
[00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:14.880]   working with local business people
[00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:18.900]   that manages a million-dollar fee-only accounts,
[00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:22.280]   to something like, I don't know, Peter Schiff,
[00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:25.440]   and his global strategies for managing,
[00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:28.760]   was it the Euro-Pacific, is that the name of his firm?
[00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:30.120]   Yeah, it's Euro-Pacific Capital,
[00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:33.020]   and here he is working with people,
[00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:36.200]   trying to help US citizens practically, basically,
[00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:40.120]   divest themselves of the US dollar in exchange for that.
[00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:41.760]   There are certain geographic specialties,
[00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:44.240]   so if you go into many, you know, some town,
[00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:46.720]   and this specific financial advisor
[00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:49.280]   has all of the business in this local town.
[00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:52.680]   My point in going through this list of specialties,
[00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:54.840]   or specialized approaches, is to point out
[00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:59.480]   that being a financial advisor can mean many, many things,
[00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:02.360]   and all of those are legitimate aspects
[00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:04.860]   of being a financial advisor.
[00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:06.360]   But what's changing more than ever
[00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:09.200]   is ways of marketing your services.
[00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:12.760]   So there are plenty of financial advisory firms
[00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:15.160]   that are old and established,
[00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:18.520]   maybe they're practically a family office at this point.
[00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:20.880]   I mean, we have a gazillion family offices here in Palm Beach
[00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:23.040]   or multi-family offices,
[00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:24.480]   which is essentially a family office
[00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:26.240]   is if you are a wealthy family,
[00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:29.120]   you'll put together your own financial planning firm
[00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:30.880]   just purely to serve your family.
[00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:33.880]   At some point, I need to get some of these guys
[00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:36.440]   and gals that work here in Palm Beach on the show.
[00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:37.840]   I gotta find someone to do it,
[00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:39.840]   and they won't tell who their families are,
[00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:41.380]   but I've talked with a few of them.
[00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:45.020]   But, you know, this famous rich family A,
[00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:47.400]   they've got $3 billion that they're managing.
[00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:50.480]   And so they might be doing everything from handling,
[00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:52.160]   well, they are, they're doing everything.
[00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:54.040]   And there'll be an in-house accountant,
[00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:55.760]   there'll be an in-house investment person,
[00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:57.680]   there'll be an in-house coordinator,
[00:26:57.680 --> 00:26:59.520]   an in-house administrative staff,
[00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:02.200]   which is responsible for paying all the bills.
[00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:05.080]   It's a really interesting market.
[00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:08.760]   There's also the small multi-family office.
[00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:11.240]   So instead of, you know, hey, I don't have $4 billion,
[00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:12.880]   but I've got 400 million,
[00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:14.600]   maybe if you bring your 400 million
[00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:16.240]   and I bring my 400 million,
[00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:19.240]   and we get Joe to bring, you know, his 300 million,
[00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:21.680]   and we get Sally to bring her half a billion,
[00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:22.960]   we put enough together, enough money.
[00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:24.280]   I mean, I'm making things up.
[00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:26.360]   There are a lot of those here as well.
[00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:27.780]   And so they don't accept clients,
[00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:29.640]   but they're a financial planner.
[00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:32.400]   They're working in a financial advisory space.
[00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:33.880]   Or there are just, like I said,
[00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:37.600]   a firm, you know, Smith Capital Management.
[00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:40.400]   And Smith has 100 different families
[00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:43.200]   that are all established here in the community.
[00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:46.920]   And he works only by referral.
[00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:49.320]   So he doesn't market except by referral.
[00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:51.820]   Satisfied client sends a satisfied client.
[00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:54.080]   Some larger firms build a reputation
[00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:55.280]   in their marketing plan,
[00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:57.840]   is their reputation for a certain level of service,
[00:27:57.840 --> 00:27:59.600]   or for a certain type of service.
[00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:03.560]   So the best example here would be a bank trust department.
[00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:05.620]   Some banks, example, there's one near my house
[00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:06.800]   called Comerica Bank.
[00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:10.400]   Comerica is well-known for their trust management services.
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:12.120]   And the trust services at banks
[00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:14.120]   is usually the most conservative aspect
[00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:15.900]   of financial planning that you'll ever find.
[00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:18.280]   But they hire and have financial advisors
[00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:20.440]   that work with their families
[00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:22.400]   for whom they provide trust services
[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:24.000]   in a comprehensive manner.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.220]   Or if you had pure trust companies,
[00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:28.220]   standalone trust companies like Bessemer Trust
[00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:32.980]   or Northern Trust, these are long-established firms.
[00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:34.240]   You'll never hear them in the news.
[00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:35.760]   They're very conservative.
[00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:39.200]   But they don't market on the basis of picking up the phone
[00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:44.200]   and calling individual,
[00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:47.760]   median income net worth people.
[00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:49.760]   Everything is based upon referral
[00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:53.600]   within a very tight, high net worth community.
[00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:55.520]   If that type of community is there for you,
[00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:57.260]   it's possible to set up your own firm
[00:28:57.260 --> 00:28:58.400]   and network your way in.
[00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:00.860]   It's gonna take time, but again, here in Palm Beach,
[00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:03.620]   I know several firms that exclusively work
[00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:06.120]   in the affluent Palm Beach marketplace,
[00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:08.040]   and they've just built it up over time.
[00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:10.220]   Now, some firms are more mass market.
[00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:13.080]   So if you went and joined one of the large wire houses,
[00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:15.080]   that would be more mass market.
[00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:17.400]   Or that was how I got into the business
[00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:20.760]   was I was working in a mass market approach,
[00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:22.660]   and I started with the people that I knew
[00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:23.620]   and the people that they knew.
[00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:25.760]   And I worked from friend to friend to friend,
[00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:27.840]   calling my friends, asking for introductions
[00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:29.900]   to their friends, asking for introductions
[00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:31.880]   to their friends, and doing that.
[00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:33.280]   Some people start with cold calling.
[00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:34.120]   I never did that.
[00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:35.460]   I thought it was, I didn't need to.
[00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:40.200]   I had a large, warm market of people with whom I could work.
[00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:42.440]   But you could still start today with cold calling.
[00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:44.000]   It's tougher than ever.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.320]   But one of the keys is that marketing is changing,
[00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:47.160]   even today.
[00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:48.640]   And by the way, I'm gonna share my experience
[00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:50.640]   'cause that was what the second email
[00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:51.880]   was specifically asking about.
[00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:54.600]   And I'll explain what makes doing that well
[00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:56.800]   versus what makes doing that not well.
[00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:59.720]   Like what makes that professional versus not professional.
[00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:01.120]   But marketing is changing today.
[00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:05.500]   And today, you've got the big people
[00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:06.700]   with the big media presence.
[00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:11.020]   So some, Rick Edelman, he's got his entire firm
[00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:13.000]   is all of the prospects are coming
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.700]   based upon his marketing brilliance
[00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:16.980]   and driving clients to his firm.
[00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:19.420]   He's built the largest firm.
[00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:21.340]   It's just an amazing business.
[00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:23.900]   Or if you've got other radio people, Dave Ramsey,
[00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:25.340]   he's got his endorsed local provider.
[00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:26.900]   So the people that sign on
[00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:28.860]   for his endorsed local provider program,
[00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:30.580]   they pay him a fee, and in exchange,
[00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:31.700]   he sends clients their way.
[00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:33.700]   And so that's their marketing method.
[00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:35.320]   You've got the marketing method now
[00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:38.400]   that's really being built with technological solutions.
[00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:41.020]   So an example here would be something like personal capital.
[00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:44.720]   Personal capital builds this beautiful interface
[00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:48.140]   for you to see all of your accounts in one place,
[00:30:48.140 --> 00:30:51.200]   to look at your fees, and an exchange on the backend
[00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:54.260]   that gives the advisors that they have backend service
[00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:55.340]   to review your portfolio
[00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:56.900]   and to have everything in one place.
[00:30:56.900 --> 00:30:58.940]   And so it's a brilliant business model
[00:30:58.940 --> 00:31:01.620]   because instead of me as an individual going out
[00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:03.660]   and sitting down at a table with a legal pad
[00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:05.040]   writing down all your assets,
[00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:06.460]   you just load them all into the computer
[00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:07.740]   and you can see them.
[00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:09.120]   You see the marketing efforts
[00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:12.140]   with the so-called robo-advisors today.
[00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:14.580]   So examples here would be Betterment.
[00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:17.140]   And you see Betterment building their marketplace.
[00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:20.140]   And what they're touting is their technological solution,
[00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:23.200]   that we are able to manage a portfolio more efficiently
[00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:24.860]   and at a lower cost, so therefore,
[00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:29.060]   bring us your portfolio and we will cover it for you.
[00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:30.940]   Or you have a firm like Wealthfront.
[00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:32.700]   These are the more well-known ones right now,
[00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:35.580]   but Wealthfront, working with an individual advisor,
[00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:38.700]   but with this mass market virtual relationship.
[00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:41.460]   So whether that's, or you have, I mean,
[00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:43.700]   the insurance business, the best example would be
[00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:47.460]   the infinite banking concepts or Bank on Yourself.
[00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:49.060]   This is their marketing plan.
[00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:51.740]   Write a book, infinite banking or Bank on Yourself.
[00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:53.060]   Write a book about the virtues
[00:31:53.060 --> 00:31:54.800]   of whole life insurance policies.
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:56.780]   And then this is the marketing plan.
[00:31:56.780 --> 00:31:58.620]   People find it, they read it, and then they call you up
[00:31:58.620 --> 00:32:00.220]   and you're able to work with them
[00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:02.140]   on life insurance perspective.
[00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:06.140]   Marketing is key to any business.
[00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:09.340]   And that's why one of my actually most concerning statements
[00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:14.340]   in these emails is in Tim's email,
[00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:17.140]   because where Tim is concerned about,
[00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:18.620]   I don't want a cold call,
[00:32:18.620 --> 00:32:21.180]   I don't want to push financial products on people.
[00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:24.740]   And there's a right way and a wrong way to, in my opinion,
[00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:28.420]   to approach that, meaning that certainly the idea
[00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:31.860]   of cold calling and pushing products on people is,
[00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:33.460]   it doesn't sound, I mean, I don't know anyone
[00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:35.460]   that that would be attractive to.
[00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:39.100]   If that's a general idea of I don't like sales,
[00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:41.280]   and I hear this a lot, I've heard this in other emails,
[00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:43.060]   which I didn't bring in to read
[00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:43.940]   at the beginning of the show,
[00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:46.100]   but people say, well, I don't like selling.
[00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:50.840]   As your financial advisor, at least your virtual advisor,
[00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:54.300]   let me commend to you that not liking selling
[00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:56.700]   or not being willing or able to sell
[00:32:56.700 --> 00:32:59.640]   is going to be pretty destructive to your wealth.
[00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:03.740]   Sales is the key to every single business.
[00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:07.740]   And if you are interested in being wealthy,
[00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:10.640]   no matter what job you do, you better like sales.
[00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:14.100]   Because if you are working a job that you say,
[00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:15.320]   I don't have to be in sales,
[00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:17.220]   I've just been working this specific job
[00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:19.020]   and I just do my job and go home.
[00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:20.920]   The reality is if you're an investor,
[00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:25.060]   you'd better have great sales forces
[00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:27.700]   in the companies into which you're investing.
[00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:30.660]   'Cause businesses live or die based upon their sales.
[00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:33.060]   So you'd better like sales
[00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:35.560]   even if you don't view yourself as a salesperson.
[00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:37.520]   But as an individual or an entrepreneur,
[00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:38.620]   especially as an entrepreneur,
[00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:41.280]   you'd better be brilliant at selling.
[00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:43.880]   Selling is one of the most valuable skills you can have,
[00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:45.740]   especially financially valuable skills,
[00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:48.740]   because there's always a direct connection
[00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:51.140]   between your sales skill and revenue.
[00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:52.700]   So that means that your compensation
[00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:54.140]   can be directly tied to revenue.
[00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:56.020]   That's what commissions are all about.
[00:33:56.020 --> 00:34:00.420]   I personally am and desire to be even better,
[00:34:00.420 --> 00:34:01.980]   but I'm a world-class salesperson
[00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:03.340]   and I'm very proud of that,
[00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:07.680]   because I set out to become a world-class salesperson.
[00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:10.020]   Now, where does sales go wrong?
[00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:13.520]   Where do we get this perspective of sales
[00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:15.060]   not being something that we admire
[00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:16.940]   and not something that we wanna do?
[00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:20.380]   I commend to you that it goes wrong
[00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:22.460]   when it's not professional.
[00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:24.380]   And by professional, I mean it goes wrong
[00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:26.040]   when you try to sell something
[00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:27.840]   that's not a right fit for a client.
[00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:31.560]   And this is a problem in the financial market.
[00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:37.820]   I believe that the majority of the bad reputation
[00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:43.420]   that the financial services industry has developed
[00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:46.980]   is due to a bad connection
[00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:49.940]   where simply a product is not a right fit for a customer.
[00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:52.980]   If you don't have a good fit
[00:34:52.980 --> 00:34:56.060]   between your product and your customer,
[00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:57.060]   you've got problems.
[00:34:57.060 --> 00:34:58.300]   But if you've got a great fit
[00:34:58.300 --> 00:34:59.620]   between your product and your customer,
[00:34:59.620 --> 00:35:02.700]   no matter the product and no matter the customer,
[00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:05.180]   you're gonna be in great shape.
[00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:10.340]   One person says, "Hey, I need the most economical car
[00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:14.300]   "that I can find, and my biggest priorities
[00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:19.300]   "in buying a car are fuel efficiency, low price,
[00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:22.220]   "low upfront cost, and long-term quality."
[00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:27.900]   Now, if the car salesperson has three cars on their lot,
[00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:31.060]   one is a Honda Civic, one is a Chevy Corvette,
[00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:34.220]   and another is a Ford one-ton pickup truck,
[00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:40.000]   if they sell the person in that needs base a Honda Civic,
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.580]   is there a good chance that person
[00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:43.340]   is gonna be thrilled with their purchase
[00:35:43.340 --> 00:35:45.960]   and very happy if the salesperson
[00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:47.200]   treats them professionally
[00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:48.860]   and takes care of all of the details
[00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:53.660]   and makes it a smooth and excellent process?
[00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:55.780]   Of course they're gonna be happy.
[00:35:55.780 --> 00:35:57.220]   Now, flip it around, guy comes in,
[00:35:57.220 --> 00:35:58.540]   he's wearing work boots, work pants,
[00:35:58.540 --> 00:36:01.460]   says, "I gotta tow a 20,000-pound trailer."
[00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:03.180]   If all of a sudden the salesperson says,
[00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:05.260]   "Hey, you gotta buy this Corvette,"
[00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:09.300]   unhappy customer, bad reputation.
[00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:12.300]   But if the sales guy says, "I got a one-ton truck over here,"
[00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:15.660]   now we've got a good situation,
[00:36:15.660 --> 00:36:18.020]   and you can make up the Corvette example.
[00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:19.980]   Now, let's do it this way.
[00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:22.220]   How does the salesperson sell professionally
[00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:25.660]   if, take away, he doesn't have the one-ton truck on his lot,
[00:36:25.660 --> 00:36:27.880]   and the client comes in and says,
[00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:30.320]   "Listen, I'm wearing work boots and a flannel shirt,
[00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:33.280]   "and I gotta tow my backhoe or my bobcat,
[00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:34.940]   "and the thing is gonna weigh 20,000 pounds
[00:36:34.940 --> 00:36:37.940]   "by the time I load up the truck and I load up the trailer."
[00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:41.200]   If there's no dually on the lot,
[00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:43.620]   does the salesperson all of a sudden
[00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:46.340]   try to talk the guy into a fuel-efficient Honda Civic?
[00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:49.540]   Or does he say, "Listen, you gotta go down the road
[00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:50.740]   "and see my buddy Bob.
[00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:52.240]   "Bob works at the Ford dealership,
[00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:54.200]   "and man, they've got a row of duallys out front
[00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:55.260]   "that's beautiful."
[00:36:55.260 --> 00:36:57.680]   That's professional selling.
[00:36:57.680 --> 00:37:02.260]   So in the insurance business, or in the investment business,
[00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:04.060]   or in the accounting business,
[00:37:04.060 --> 00:37:06.620]   or in any aspect of financial planning,
[00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:08.100]   you've gotta have a good fit
[00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:11.180]   between the capabilities of your firm,
[00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:12.820]   the products of your firm,
[00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:15.820]   and the goals, needs, and desires of your client.
[00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:17.780]   If you don't have that,
[00:37:17.780 --> 00:37:20.100]   then an ethical professional salesperson
[00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:23.220]   will not consummate the sale, and will not push for it,
[00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:24.620]   but will make the recommendation
[00:37:24.620 --> 00:37:26.580]   and the referral that needs to be made.
[00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:29.580]   So if you're a salesperson,
[00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:31.740]   and you're working in a call center
[00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:33.900]   with inbound term life insurance leads,
[00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:37.380]   because your company is advertising on CNN every night
[00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:39.900]   and saying, "Buy term insurance,"
[00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:41.340]   then all your customer wants from you
[00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:42.380]   is to help them square away
[00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:44.140]   and figure out how much insurance,
[00:37:44.140 --> 00:37:45.820]   and where can they get the best price
[00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:47.620]   if they've got high blood pressure.
[00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:49.380]   That's professional selling.
[00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:51.620]   If you all of a sudden try to start pushing
[00:37:51.620 --> 00:37:54.020]   the high-end hedge funds onto this client,
[00:37:54.020 --> 00:37:55.020]   and you're talking about,
[00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:56.700]   "Well, let me explain to you the lockup period
[00:37:56.700 --> 00:37:58.380]   "and the two and 20 compensation model,
[00:37:58.380 --> 00:38:00.420]   "and we've got this really great manager,"
[00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:01.940]   are you gonna have a satisfied customer
[00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:04.360]   with a good feeling in their heart?
[00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:06.800]   No, you're gonna destroy that relationship.
[00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:09.960]   But if you're sitting down over a cup of coffee
[00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:11.660]   with a high-end multimillionaire,
[00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:13.680]   and this gal says to you,
[00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:16.460]   "Listen, I'm interested in hedge funds.
[00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:18.040]   "All my friends have been investing.
[00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:20.160]   "I'm thinking about putting a portion of my capital
[00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:21.220]   "into hedge funds.
[00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:24.040]   "Could you educate me on what the risks are,
[00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:25.500]   "what the advantages are,
[00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:29.360]   "and tell me what the different options would be,
[00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:31.320]   "and what the costs would be,
[00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:33.060]   "what those types of things are,"
[00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:34.600]   if all of a sudden you say,
[00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:36.300]   "Listen, I got a great life insurance,"
[00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:40.460]   even closer, "Listen, let me tell you about index funds,"
[00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:43.160]   are you gonna have a satisfied customer?
[00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:44.340]   Probably not.
[00:38:44.340 --> 00:38:46.740]   Now, if you perceive through that process
[00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:49.940]   that having a five-year lockup period for somebody,
[00:38:49.940 --> 00:38:52.220]   two-year lockup period is more appropriate,
[00:38:52.220 --> 00:38:53.140]   for somebody who's not,
[00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:53.980]   and you're working with somebody
[00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:55.620]   who's not an accredited investor,
[00:38:55.620 --> 00:38:56.820]   and they're just getting started,
[00:38:56.820 --> 00:38:57.660]   and they're talking about,
[00:38:57.660 --> 00:39:00.180]   "Hey, I gotta put money in the Roth IRA,"
[00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:01.340]   chances are you're not gonna,
[00:39:01.340 --> 00:39:02.700]   I mean, you just immediately say,
[00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:03.760]   "Listen, this isn't a good fit.
[00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:05.260]   "Hedge funds are not for you."
[00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:07.860]   Everything is about fit.
[00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:12.580]   Fit with the right product and the right person.
[00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:13.540]   That's the need.
[00:39:13.540 --> 00:39:14.460]   That's the key.
[00:39:14.460 --> 00:39:18.100]   Does the H&R Block accountant
[00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:20.160]   all of a sudden need to start talking to somebody
[00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:22.100]   who's coming in and getting
[00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:24.080]   a low-priced tax return prepared
[00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:26.300]   about some beautiful strategy
[00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:28.820]   of moving their company to Puerto Rico,
[00:39:28.820 --> 00:39:32.780]   and, you know, or moving all of their assets offshore
[00:39:32.780 --> 00:39:34.780]   to protect themselves from the US dollar,
[00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:35.620]   and the person says,
[00:39:35.620 --> 00:39:37.540]   "Listen, I just need a tax return done."
[00:39:38.620 --> 00:39:40.140]   There's a bad fit.
[00:39:40.140 --> 00:39:42.980]   So the key is to connect what you can sell
[00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:44.700]   with the appropriate model,
[00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:45.940]   and be able to work through it
[00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:49.540]   with a proper, fully disclosed ethical compensation model.
[00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:52.180]   Professional selling is,
[00:39:52.180 --> 00:39:55.180]   if you're being sold to by a professional salesperson,
[00:39:55.180 --> 00:39:59.140]   it should be an absolutely wonderful experience.
[00:39:59.140 --> 00:40:02.200]   If you're being sold to by a non-professional salesperson,
[00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:03.260]   it is awful.
[00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:06.660]   I love great salespeople,
[00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:09.780]   and I despise dealing with horrible ones,
[00:40:09.780 --> 00:40:11.980]   because, I don't know, I like to study sales,
[00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:13.760]   and I think it's important.
[00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:16.720]   And I'll give you one short anecdote.
[00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:21.720]   Recently was called on by somebody selling solar,
[00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:24.460]   basically solar systems, various types of solar,
[00:40:24.460 --> 00:40:26.920]   both photovoltaic electrical panels,
[00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:30.720]   and also solar-heated water systems.
[00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:32.200]   Now, I've got an issue in my house right now
[00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:33.460]   that I've got to replace my water heater.
[00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:34.580]   It's super old,
[00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:37.820]   and my insurance company is requiring me
[00:40:37.820 --> 00:40:39.640]   to update it and improve it.
[00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:43.340]   So I am probably the most perfect prospect
[00:40:43.340 --> 00:40:46.740]   at this stage in my life for a water heater system.
[00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:49.220]   I don't know as much as I need to know about water heaters.
[00:40:49.220 --> 00:40:50.620]   I don't know what I need.
[00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:53.020]   I'm very interested in energy efficiency.
[00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:55.900]   I'm very interested in maximum bang for my buck.
[00:40:55.900 --> 00:40:58.860]   And so this salesperson called on me,
[00:40:58.860 --> 00:41:01.660]   and I said, "Absolutely, I'm very interested."
[00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:03.700]   It was one of the worst sales presentations
[00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:05.380]   I've ever had in my life.
[00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:06.340]   It was awful.
[00:41:06.340 --> 00:41:08.700]   It was absolutely awful.
[00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:11.600]   And I am a great person to sell to
[00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:13.900]   because I've been a professional salesperson.
[00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:16.000]   So I am, if you want information, man,
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:17.700]   I'll give you every bit of data that you need.
[00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:21.000]   That was always, when I was doing face-to-face sales,
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:22.380]   I always just, I need information.
[00:41:22.380 --> 00:41:24.780]   I need it, like, and that's one of the great skills
[00:41:24.780 --> 00:41:26.220]   of being a salesperson,
[00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:28.380]   is being able to pull information out of somebody
[00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:31.940]   in a gentle and appropriate and professional way.
[00:41:31.940 --> 00:41:33.980]   So I'm willing to give all the information.
[00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:35.660]   I'm willing to go through electrical statements.
[00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:36.900]   I'm willing to go and look at all the things.
[00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:38.980]   Well, 10 minutes into the presentation,
[00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:40.660]   the guy slaps a legal pad down,
[00:41:40.660 --> 00:41:42.100]   starts writing a pen and says,
[00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:43.900]   "Well, normally the system that we can do for you
[00:41:43.900 --> 00:41:45.700]   "is about $20,000, but today only,
[00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:46.660]   "we've got a special discount.
[00:41:46.660 --> 00:41:47.800]   "I give it to you at 50% off
[00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:49.580]   "and you get a tax rebate and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."
[00:41:49.580 --> 00:41:52.980]   And the dude hadn't once gotten up from my kitchen table
[00:41:52.980 --> 00:41:54.860]   to walk even over to my water heater
[00:41:54.860 --> 00:41:57.700]   and see how many BTUs I have or how big it is.
[00:41:57.700 --> 00:41:59.500]   He didn't go out and look at my air conditioner
[00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:01.940]   and figure out how big of a unit it is.
[00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:04.620]   Didn't ask if I had one air conditioning unit or two.
[00:42:04.620 --> 00:42:06.740]   Didn't ask if I was interested in energy.
[00:42:06.740 --> 00:42:08.040]   It was awful.
[00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:12.700]   And yet people do that in financial sales all the time.
[00:42:12.700 --> 00:42:16.620]   And that's the problem.
[00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:19.900]   Trot in off the street, say,
[00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:20.860]   "Listen, I gotta tell you
[00:42:20.860 --> 00:42:23.040]   "about my great whole life insurance policy
[00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:24.020]   "and the realities."
[00:42:24.020 --> 00:42:25.940]   You didn't ask a single question.
[00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:28.860]   "Let me tell you about the tax benefits."
[00:42:28.860 --> 00:42:30.580]   What a bunch of bunk.
[00:42:30.580 --> 00:42:32.660]   Now, find out the details.
[00:42:32.660 --> 00:42:33.620]   And if you have a client
[00:42:33.620 --> 00:42:35.780]   who needs a whole life insurance policy,
[00:42:35.780 --> 00:42:40.780]   man, work it out and do it in the right situation.
[00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:44.340]   But don't trot in when the person needs a term life policy
[00:42:44.340 --> 00:42:46.780]   and sell a whole life policy, and that's the problem.
[00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:47.980]   Don't come in and start talking
[00:42:47.980 --> 00:42:50.060]   about long-term care insurance
[00:42:50.060 --> 00:42:52.180]   when the person doesn't have any money.
[00:42:52.180 --> 00:42:53.340]   But on the flip side,
[00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:56.020]   don't come in and talk about portfolio management
[00:42:56.020 --> 00:42:58.660]   and the ability to get an extra 13 basis points
[00:42:58.660 --> 00:43:01.820]   or alpha when the person's biggest risk is,
[00:43:01.820 --> 00:43:03.620]   "I need long-term care insurance."
[00:43:03.620 --> 00:43:06.740]   Do your job, in other words.
[00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:08.260]   Professional selling is a job
[00:43:08.260 --> 00:43:10.140]   and it's important to do it right.
[00:43:10.140 --> 00:43:14.340]   And if every single financial advisor
[00:43:14.340 --> 00:43:17.420]   and financial planner would work very hard
[00:43:17.420 --> 00:43:19.580]   at being a professional salesperson,
[00:43:19.580 --> 00:43:23.380]   then our industry would have a wonderful reputation
[00:43:23.380 --> 00:43:25.060]   and people would love working
[00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:26.660]   with a great financial advisor.
[00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:29.800]   So why doesn't it happen?
[00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:32.740]   Well, a bunch of reasons.
[00:43:32.740 --> 00:43:37.480]   But usually, it's due to one of these things or multiple.
[00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:40.780]   You could simply have an ignorant advisor,
[00:43:40.780 --> 00:43:43.140]   a well-meaning but ignorant person.
[00:43:43.140 --> 00:43:44.420]   And I've been that way.
[00:43:44.420 --> 00:43:46.660]   I have been ignorant and still am ignorant
[00:43:46.660 --> 00:43:49.380]   on certain aspects of financial planning.
[00:43:49.380 --> 00:43:52.860]   I'm ignorant of many of the most complex aspects
[00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:55.340]   of portfolio management, for example.
[00:43:55.340 --> 00:43:57.840]   I'm ignorant of how to hedge my currency risk
[00:43:57.840 --> 00:43:59.540]   when managing a multi-billion dollar portfolio.
[00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:00.860]   I don't have a clue what I'm talking about
[00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:02.340]   when it comes to that.
[00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:04.820]   So if I get into a situation
[00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:06.700]   where I'm asked for my opinion on that,
[00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:07.540]   I'm gonna immediately say,
[00:44:07.540 --> 00:44:08.460]   "I don't know anything about that.
[00:44:08.460 --> 00:44:10.060]   "I'm sorry, I can't help you."
[00:44:10.060 --> 00:44:14.060]   But some people don't and that's a problem.
[00:44:14.060 --> 00:44:17.780]   So somebody could be very well-meaning and very ignorant.
[00:44:17.780 --> 00:44:19.700]   They could just simply be unethical.
[00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:21.500]   Ethics is a big deal.
[00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:24.420]   And one of the things that is most difficult
[00:44:24.420 --> 00:44:27.100]   is ethical systems are very much based
[00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:29.060]   upon somebody's worldview,
[00:44:29.060 --> 00:44:30.600]   but what they think is right to do
[00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:32.360]   and what they think is wrong to do.
[00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:37.300]   And this is a tough one for you as a consumer to figure out.
[00:44:37.300 --> 00:44:39.440]   How do you judge somebody's ethics?
[00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:43.180]   What do ethics do different worldviews permit?
[00:44:43.180 --> 00:44:47.960]   I mean, it's a whole challenging philosophical conversation.
[00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:51.660]   But ethics are not the same for every person.
[00:44:51.660 --> 00:44:54.820]   It's very much dependent on what someone's worldview is.
[00:44:54.820 --> 00:44:57.260]   There could just be simply a bad fit for capabilities
[00:44:57.260 --> 00:44:59.300]   and there could be a reason why
[00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:01.580]   an advisor is trying to push something.
[00:45:01.580 --> 00:45:03.460]   So maybe there's a bad compensation model
[00:45:03.460 --> 00:45:05.940]   or the advisors feeling a shortfall
[00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:07.460]   and they're like, "I gotta make this deal."
[00:45:07.460 --> 00:45:08.540]   And so they start pushing.
[00:45:08.540 --> 00:45:10.120]   This happens a lot because of the different
[00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:12.940]   compensation models in the financial planning industry.
[00:45:12.940 --> 00:45:15.340]   Or it could just be a bad service or a poorly run firm
[00:45:15.340 --> 00:45:17.780]   or a poorly designed product.
[00:45:17.780 --> 00:45:20.420]   I mean, there could be many, many reasons.
[00:45:20.420 --> 00:45:22.620]   So what do you do?
[00:45:23.620 --> 00:45:26.740]   As somebody who's interested in getting into
[00:45:26.740 --> 00:45:31.340]   the financial planning industry in an intelligent way,
[00:45:31.340 --> 00:45:32.980]   I'd say, what are your skills?
[00:45:32.980 --> 00:45:35.040]   What do you actually bring to the table?
[00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:37.820]   The most difficult skill to find
[00:45:37.820 --> 00:45:40.220]   is not technical financial planning knowledge.
[00:45:40.220 --> 00:45:41.260]   There are many people out there
[00:45:41.260 --> 00:45:42.860]   who have an interest in personal finance,
[00:45:42.860 --> 00:45:44.620]   an interest in financial knowledge,
[00:45:44.620 --> 00:45:50.040]   an expertise in some level of technical planning.
[00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:51.780]   That's actually incredibly easy to find.
[00:45:51.780 --> 00:45:53.520]   There's a lot of people on the market that have that.
[00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:56.180]   What's difficult to find is marketing skill.
[00:45:56.180 --> 00:45:59.180]   That's the most difficult thing.
[00:45:59.180 --> 00:46:03.620]   And that's what many people who are interested in finance
[00:46:03.620 --> 00:46:05.260]   and who pursue don't have,
[00:46:05.260 --> 00:46:08.060]   the ability to market their services effectively.
[00:46:08.060 --> 00:46:10.140]   Whether that's face-to-face, person-to-person,
[00:46:10.140 --> 00:46:14.020]   phone call after phone call, verbally, audibly,
[00:46:14.020 --> 00:46:17.620]   in writing, on a blog, in video, on a podcast,
[00:46:17.620 --> 00:46:19.740]   that's the toughest skill to find.
[00:46:19.740 --> 00:46:20.660]   And you gotta start with that.
[00:46:20.660 --> 00:46:22.540]   If you don't have marketing skills,
[00:46:22.540 --> 00:46:26.280]   you need to recognize that and not go into a position
[00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:28.480]   which is going to require marketing skills.
[00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:31.120]   So as an example, the third email that I read,
[00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:33.440]   Eric, if you're interested in going in
[00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:35.800]   and working with people, you better have a marketing plan.
[00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:38.000]   Now I recognize that you might be financially independent,
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:40.120]   which by the way, be careful when you declare yourself
[00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:44.280]   financially independent at 25 with a few $200,000 of assets
[00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:45.920]   'cause you can live on $1,500 a month.
[00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:47.400]   I'm not saying you can't do it.
[00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:49.160]   I think it's awesome that if you did,
[00:46:49.160 --> 00:46:51.040]   but life has a habit of changing
[00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:54.140]   and your goals might evolve over time.
[00:46:54.140 --> 00:46:55.580]   Mine have, and they might still.
[00:46:55.580 --> 00:46:57.220]   So I have my own numbers,
[00:46:57.220 --> 00:47:00.500]   but your goals might develop over time.
[00:47:00.500 --> 00:47:03.660]   So make sure you're just aware of that mentally.
[00:47:03.660 --> 00:47:06.060]   But if, for example, if you don't have a marketing plan,
[00:47:06.060 --> 00:47:08.940]   it doesn't matter how interested you are in finance
[00:47:08.940 --> 00:47:10.700]   or how great you are at having a discussion,
[00:47:10.700 --> 00:47:12.840]   you're not gonna have a client
[00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:14.900]   because the reality is most of your friends
[00:47:14.900 --> 00:47:16.300]   don't wanna hear about you with money.
[00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:18.380]   I have a rule, I don't give free financial advice.
[00:47:18.380 --> 00:47:21.080]   Either somebody asked for it,
[00:47:21.080 --> 00:47:23.440]   and if it's somebody that I care about,
[00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:24.560]   I'm willing to help,
[00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:27.400]   but I don't offer financial advice anymore.
[00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:29.680]   I made that mistake for a long time.
[00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:30.720]   That's why I do a podcast.
[00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:31.880]   It's here for you if you want it,
[00:47:31.880 --> 00:47:33.680]   but you have to seek it out.
[00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:35.720]   But you need a marketing plan for your services.
[00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:36.800]   If you don't have one, again,
[00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:38.880]   you gotta go somewhere where you don't need one.
[00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:41.480]   And so now instead of setting up your own firm
[00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:44.420]   or working in a position where you're gonna be outbound,
[00:47:44.420 --> 00:47:46.480]   which is what many of the positions
[00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:48.040]   that are the easiest to get are,
[00:47:48.040 --> 00:47:50.500]   you're gonna have to build some other unique skill.
[00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:53.180]   So perhaps your skill is you are a tax attorney,
[00:47:53.180 --> 00:47:56.220]   and you are an expert at tax planning,
[00:47:56.220 --> 00:47:59.260]   or estate tax planning, perhaps, or income tax planning.
[00:47:59.260 --> 00:48:01.460]   Well, now you trot down to Northern Trust
[00:48:01.460 --> 00:48:03.620]   and you apply for one of their positions, or Bessemer,
[00:48:03.620 --> 00:48:07.300]   and there's no sales requirements there,
[00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:09.540]   but you're not setting up an independent firm.
[00:48:09.540 --> 00:48:11.300]   You're gonna die if you don't have marketing skills.
[00:48:11.300 --> 00:48:13.700]   You need to go find a job that's gonna fit that.
[00:48:13.700 --> 00:48:16.140]   Whatever market you're pursuing,
[00:48:16.140 --> 00:48:17.560]   you need to make sure there's a good fit
[00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:19.540]   for your ability to serve that market.
[00:48:19.540 --> 00:48:21.100]   So Eric, someone like you,
[00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:23.280]   if you're interested in financial independence,
[00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:24.980]   then I would suggest to you that,
[00:48:24.980 --> 00:48:26.740]   and if you consider yourself financially independent,
[00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:28.920]   then maybe you need to set up a boutique practice
[00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:30.900]   where you exclusively work with people
[00:48:30.900 --> 00:48:33.180]   who are interested in becoming financially independent
[00:48:33.180 --> 00:48:34.180]   at an early age.
[00:48:34.180 --> 00:48:37.260]   But you gotta figure out your marketing plan.
[00:48:37.260 --> 00:48:42.040]   Same thing with our physician friend who wrote me the email.
[00:48:42.040 --> 00:48:44.340]   That would be a really great fit,
[00:48:44.340 --> 00:48:45.560]   it may be working with physicians,
[00:48:45.560 --> 00:48:48.220]   but you gotta build up then the technical expertise.
[00:48:48.220 --> 00:48:49.180]   So I'll give you my story
[00:48:49.180 --> 00:48:51.100]   of how I started in the industry and why.
[00:48:51.100 --> 00:48:52.340]   And I've mentioned this before on the show,
[00:48:52.340 --> 00:48:54.140]   but I'll try to give a little bit of detail
[00:48:54.140 --> 00:48:55.700]   that will be helpful.
[00:48:55.700 --> 00:48:56.660]   When I started in the industry,
[00:48:56.660 --> 00:48:58.660]   I'd been laid off from my previous job.
[00:48:58.660 --> 00:49:01.460]   And I knew that I wanted to be an entrepreneur,
[00:49:01.460 --> 00:49:03.240]   but I didn't have a great idea,
[00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:06.640]   or necessarily the background of a specific business
[00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:08.500]   that I really wanted to pursue.
[00:49:08.500 --> 00:49:09.520]   I had a few ideas,
[00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:11.920]   and they ranged from some blue collar businesses
[00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:14.180]   to some product ideas,
[00:49:14.180 --> 00:49:17.460]   but I didn't know how to go out and figure out
[00:49:17.460 --> 00:49:19.700]   how to get my product designed and prototyped
[00:49:19.700 --> 00:49:22.500]   and ship it in from China and set that up.
[00:49:22.500 --> 00:49:25.140]   And I knew that I wasn't quite ready for that.
[00:49:25.140 --> 00:49:27.160]   So I wanted something where I could be paid,
[00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:29.780]   not for the hours that I worked, but for what I produced.
[00:49:29.780 --> 00:49:32.660]   I wanted something that was my own business,
[00:49:32.660 --> 00:49:34.660]   but that I built up ongoing income.
[00:49:34.660 --> 00:49:37.060]   I didn't wanna go and sell houses as an example,
[00:49:37.060 --> 00:49:40.220]   where you only get income if you sell a house.
[00:49:40.220 --> 00:49:42.620]   I wanted something that built up residual income
[00:49:42.620 --> 00:49:47.180]   and residual value, equity in a business that I could sell.
[00:49:47.180 --> 00:49:51.180]   I wanted something that I wasn't tied to one location,
[00:49:51.180 --> 00:49:53.100]   either during the day,
[00:49:53.100 --> 00:49:55.140]   'cause I got sick and tired of sitting in an office
[00:49:55.140 --> 00:49:56.700]   under a fluorescent light all day.
[00:49:56.700 --> 00:49:57.540]   That was for me.
[00:49:57.540 --> 00:49:58.760]   I wanted to be out and about,
[00:49:58.760 --> 00:50:02.180]   and/or geographically with regard to where I lived.
[00:50:02.180 --> 00:50:03.500]   And so I was trying to build,
[00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:04.940]   you know, I was very interested in travel
[00:50:04.940 --> 00:50:07.420]   and independence of location independence.
[00:50:07.420 --> 00:50:08.660]   And so I was trying to build that.
[00:50:08.660 --> 00:50:10.220]   And I wanted something that I enjoyed
[00:50:10.220 --> 00:50:13.940]   and that I could do well at and feel good about.
[00:50:13.940 --> 00:50:15.180]   So I was interested in finance,
[00:50:15.180 --> 00:50:16.580]   and then I got the referral to,
[00:50:16.580 --> 00:50:19.420]   it was Northwestern Mutual was where I got referred to.
[00:50:19.420 --> 00:50:21.820]   But I had very strong feelings about finance.
[00:50:21.820 --> 00:50:25.340]   And I didn't like certain ways of approaches.
[00:50:25.340 --> 00:50:28.580]   Because I had the good fortune to be introduced
[00:50:28.580 --> 00:50:30.980]   to somebody who was a comprehensive financial planner,
[00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:33.020]   I actually had a good personality fit
[00:50:33.020 --> 00:50:36.700]   with this specific office of that company.
[00:50:36.700 --> 00:50:41.060]   And I liked the fact that we didn't push product
[00:50:41.060 --> 00:50:44.140]   in the sense of, you know,
[00:50:44.140 --> 00:50:45.980]   hey, listen, Joshua, we gotta move 20,000 shares
[00:50:45.980 --> 00:50:48.980]   of XYZ stock, or we gotta move 50,000 ABC bonds.
[00:50:48.980 --> 00:50:50.980]   And the person with whom I interviewed
[00:50:50.980 --> 00:50:53.820]   was extremely low key and was extremely down to earth.
[00:50:53.820 --> 00:50:54.660]   And I liked that.
[00:50:54.660 --> 00:50:59.260]   I've never been attracted to the flashy personality.
[00:50:59.260 --> 00:51:01.900]   So I started with insurance planning.
[00:51:01.900 --> 00:51:03.460]   And the reality with insurance planning
[00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:05.180]   is that the vast majority of people
[00:51:05.180 --> 00:51:07.980]   in the United States of America are underinsured.
[00:51:07.980 --> 00:51:12.540]   And if you're willing to do the work,
[00:51:12.540 --> 00:51:16.340]   you can build an amazing business by doing excellent,
[00:51:16.340 --> 00:51:19.860]   ethical, important, and valued insurance planning
[00:51:19.860 --> 00:51:22.740]   only for individual clients.
[00:51:22.740 --> 00:51:28.820]   Many people would greatly value an insurance expert
[00:51:28.820 --> 00:51:30.780]   doing a review of their situation.
[00:51:30.780 --> 00:51:33.220]   And you can reasonably quickly
[00:51:33.220 --> 00:51:35.140]   become an expert at insurance.
[00:51:35.140 --> 00:51:36.940]   Or at least on general market,
[00:51:36.940 --> 00:51:40.740]   mainstream employees type of insurance.
[00:51:40.740 --> 00:51:44.220]   I focused on life insurance, disability insurance,
[00:51:44.220 --> 00:51:45.380]   long-term care insurance,
[00:51:45.380 --> 00:51:48.380]   and I did a very small amount of health insurance
[00:51:48.380 --> 00:51:50.460]   in very select cases, actually,
[00:51:50.460 --> 00:51:53.020]   until the Affordable Care Act was passed
[00:51:53.020 --> 00:51:56.580]   and it destroyed the individual health insurance market.
[00:51:56.580 --> 00:51:59.220]   The key is to know who you actually help.
[00:51:59.220 --> 00:52:01.340]   So let me give you an example with health insurance.
[00:52:01.340 --> 00:52:03.980]   I only did a very small amount of health insurance
[00:52:03.980 --> 00:52:07.420]   for a few specific individuals
[00:52:07.420 --> 00:52:10.300]   because I didn't have the capacity to deliver
[00:52:10.300 --> 00:52:13.740]   on any promise that I could make on a larger basis.
[00:52:13.740 --> 00:52:15.900]   I wasn't staffed up to walk into a company
[00:52:15.900 --> 00:52:17.700]   with 300 employees and say,
[00:52:17.700 --> 00:52:19.740]   "Listen, I'm an expert on group health insurance."
[00:52:19.740 --> 00:52:20.740]   I wasn't.
[00:52:20.740 --> 00:52:22.180]   So I never pursued that.
[00:52:22.180 --> 00:52:25.100]   When people asked me about that, I always referred it out.
[00:52:25.100 --> 00:52:27.540]   And to make sure that clients were satisfied,
[00:52:27.540 --> 00:52:29.940]   I always told people, "I don't do much insurance,
[00:52:29.940 --> 00:52:32.740]   "but I did become an expert at a couple of companies
[00:52:32.740 --> 00:52:34.940]   "that in my area had good networks,
[00:52:34.940 --> 00:52:36.540]   "and those couple of companies
[00:52:36.540 --> 00:52:39.340]   "did individual health insurance."
[00:52:39.340 --> 00:52:42.900]   If I had a larger case,
[00:52:42.900 --> 00:52:47.900]   I had a few small companies that I worked with,
[00:52:47.900 --> 00:52:50.580]   but I always worked with a partner who was an expert.
[00:52:50.580 --> 00:52:51.940]   And we split the commissions.
[00:52:51.940 --> 00:52:54.700]   My partner serviced that case,
[00:52:54.700 --> 00:52:57.620]   and those actually, one of them didn't go well.
[00:52:57.620 --> 00:52:59.580]   And it was because I was working in a market
[00:52:59.580 --> 00:53:02.300]   where I wasn't an expert
[00:53:02.300 --> 00:53:03.860]   and I wasn't close enough to it.
[00:53:03.860 --> 00:53:05.860]   And looking back now, I shouldn't have done it.
[00:53:05.860 --> 00:53:07.660]   Now, I didn't do anything ethically wrong.
[00:53:07.660 --> 00:53:10.100]   It just wasn't a great fit for my ability to deliver.
[00:53:10.100 --> 00:53:11.700]   And eventually the client left
[00:53:11.700 --> 00:53:15.060]   and found someone that was better able to fit their needs.
[00:53:15.060 --> 00:53:17.700]   So the key was I did a very small amount
[00:53:17.700 --> 00:53:18.540]   of health insurance,
[00:53:18.540 --> 00:53:20.380]   but when it comes to something like life insurance,
[00:53:20.380 --> 00:53:21.300]   I was an expert.
[00:53:21.300 --> 00:53:25.620]   I didn't try to position myself as an expert on 401(k) plans.
[00:53:25.620 --> 00:53:26.780]   I don't have any ability to go in
[00:53:26.780 --> 00:53:30.620]   and service a 401(k) for 200 employees.
[00:53:31.740 --> 00:53:34.780]   I focused on life insurance, disability insurance planning,
[00:53:34.780 --> 00:53:37.660]   long-term care insurance planning, and that was it.
[00:53:37.660 --> 00:53:41.340]   And then because I had chosen a market
[00:53:41.340 --> 00:53:43.260]   where I had multiple insurance options,
[00:53:43.260 --> 00:53:46.260]   I didn't try to force massive whole life insurance policies
[00:53:46.260 --> 00:53:47.560]   on young broke couples.
[00:53:47.560 --> 00:53:49.780]   I sold them disability insurance,
[00:53:49.780 --> 00:53:52.260]   which is what they actually needed.
[00:53:52.260 --> 00:53:54.780]   I get so angry when I come across bad insurance planning
[00:53:54.780 --> 00:53:58.180]   because if you'll just care for a client
[00:53:58.180 --> 00:54:01.300]   and provide good planning over time,
[00:54:01.300 --> 00:54:03.220]   you'll build a lifelong client.
[00:54:03.220 --> 00:54:06.540]   And if you've got those three to four product sets
[00:54:06.540 --> 00:54:07.420]   in your back pocket,
[00:54:07.420 --> 00:54:10.220]   you've got life insurance, disability insurance,
[00:54:10.220 --> 00:54:11.460]   and long-term care insurance,
[00:54:11.460 --> 00:54:14.300]   you could do a great job with many, many people.
[00:54:14.300 --> 00:54:16.700]   There are enough commissions that you can earn
[00:54:16.700 --> 00:54:18.980]   with term insurance and disability insurance
[00:54:18.980 --> 00:54:20.900]   with young families of median income
[00:54:20.900 --> 00:54:23.540]   that you're able to do an effective job over time
[00:54:23.540 --> 00:54:26.300]   and able to eat while you're building up your knowledge.
[00:54:26.300 --> 00:54:29.700]   And it's important that you understand
[00:54:29.700 --> 00:54:33.420]   who do I have to work with and what market do I need
[00:54:33.420 --> 00:54:35.580]   and how can I service effectively?
[00:54:35.580 --> 00:54:37.060]   When I started, I was 23 years old.
[00:54:37.060 --> 00:54:42.060]   I didn't have a marketplace of million dollar accounts
[00:54:42.060 --> 00:54:44.020]   and I wouldn't have known what to do
[00:54:44.020 --> 00:54:47.820]   with a million dollar account if I'd come across it.
[00:54:47.820 --> 00:54:49.340]   There wouldn't have been a chance in the world
[00:54:49.340 --> 00:54:50.720]   I could have won the business.
[00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:53.860]   And I shouldn't have because I didn't have any skill.
[00:54:53.860 --> 00:54:55.860]   And that's how it should be, so recognize that.
[00:54:55.860 --> 00:54:56.820]   So I started with something
[00:54:56.820 --> 00:54:58.460]   that I could become an expert at.
[00:54:59.660 --> 00:55:02.620]   That's the key, what can you become an expert at?
[00:55:02.620 --> 00:55:04.580]   What capabilities do you have?
[00:55:04.580 --> 00:55:07.100]   Who can you actually serve?
[00:55:07.100 --> 00:55:08.860]   And make sure you're in a product set
[00:55:08.860 --> 00:55:12.020]   where you could actually serve somebody.
[00:55:12.020 --> 00:55:13.020]   I'll give you an example.
[00:55:13.020 --> 00:55:18.020]   There's a company that, I guess it doesn't matter.
[00:55:18.020 --> 00:55:19.780]   There's a company called,
[00:55:19.780 --> 00:55:22.000]   it's Art Williams' old company called Primerica.
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:23.380]   Well, it's Primerica now, he sold it.
[00:55:23.380 --> 00:55:25.020]   It was the A.L. Williams Life Insurance Company
[00:55:25.020 --> 00:55:26.140]   for a long time.
[00:55:26.140 --> 00:55:29.340]   But Primerica is a company, I interviewed with them.
[00:55:29.340 --> 00:55:32.260]   I've been recruited multiple times to work with them.
[00:55:32.260 --> 00:55:36.420]   And when I looked at their product set,
[00:55:36.420 --> 00:55:39.700]   I came to the conclusion that practically the only product
[00:55:39.700 --> 00:55:44.140]   that I could represent under their contract
[00:55:44.140 --> 00:55:45.780]   was term life insurance.
[00:55:45.780 --> 00:55:48.680]   And the term life insurance didn't have any competitive,
[00:55:48.680 --> 00:55:53.340]   didn't have any competitive advantage in the marketplace.
[00:55:53.340 --> 00:55:56.460]   It wasn't the cheapest, it wasn't necessarily the best.
[00:55:56.460 --> 00:55:58.180]   It was just that there was a marketing force
[00:55:58.180 --> 00:56:00.220]   behind that specific product.
[00:56:00.220 --> 00:56:02.140]   Now, what I came to the conclusion of
[00:56:02.140 --> 00:56:04.580]   was how could I make enough money
[00:56:04.580 --> 00:56:08.060]   only having term life insurance in my back pocket?
[00:56:08.060 --> 00:56:09.640]   Now, anybody who's worked with Primerica knows
[00:56:09.640 --> 00:56:10.620]   they do have other products,
[00:56:10.620 --> 00:56:13.580]   but I couldn't see how it could work
[00:56:13.580 --> 00:56:15.260]   with only having term life insurance.
[00:56:15.260 --> 00:56:17.740]   There's not enough money, enough compensation
[00:56:17.740 --> 00:56:20.140]   when you've got, let's see,
[00:56:20.140 --> 00:56:23.300]   you've got $20 a month times two, you got $40 a month.
[00:56:23.300 --> 00:56:27.980]   So you've got $480 of annual premium.
[00:56:27.980 --> 00:56:32.180]   And I don't remember what their commission rate is,
[00:56:32.180 --> 00:56:34.020]   but average is somewhere between 50 to 100%.
[00:56:34.020 --> 00:56:36.380]   Let's just say it's 100% of the first year commission.
[00:56:36.380 --> 00:56:41.100]   So it's $480 of commissions on a case.
[00:56:41.100 --> 00:56:42.620]   And if you actually know the numbers
[00:56:42.620 --> 00:56:44.040]   in the life insurance business,
[00:56:44.040 --> 00:56:45.980]   the numbers of people that you have to call on,
[00:56:45.980 --> 00:56:48.580]   that you have to see, that you have to build a plan for
[00:56:48.580 --> 00:56:52.080]   and to actually have a client,
[00:56:52.080 --> 00:56:53.580]   there was no way to make enough money
[00:56:53.580 --> 00:56:56.140]   to where I'd be making any kind of reasonable wage.
[00:56:56.140 --> 00:56:57.580]   And so this is what you find
[00:56:57.580 --> 00:56:59.140]   is people always wonder if you go online
[00:56:59.140 --> 00:56:59.980]   and you start looking around,
[00:56:59.980 --> 00:57:02.260]   it's like why are people pushing the business opportunity?
[00:57:02.260 --> 00:57:04.780]   Well, if the products that you have
[00:57:04.780 --> 00:57:06.940]   in your back pocket as a financial advisor
[00:57:06.940 --> 00:57:11.940]   are life insurance and a business opportunity,
[00:57:11.940 --> 00:57:15.760]   and the business opportunity makes you more money,
[00:57:15.760 --> 00:57:18.060]   is it any surprise that you're gonna start
[00:57:18.060 --> 00:57:19.220]   pushing the business opportunity
[00:57:19.220 --> 00:57:22.180]   on people who probably aren't a good fit for it?
[00:57:22.180 --> 00:57:23.500]   Now, they do have other products.
[00:57:23.500 --> 00:57:25.540]   They have investment products and other things as well.
[00:57:25.540 --> 00:57:27.380]   So I'm not mad at Primeirica,
[00:57:27.380 --> 00:57:32.380]   but a little bit mad 'cause of one experience
[00:57:32.380 --> 00:57:34.780]   with one friend that I was able to rescue from it.
[00:57:34.780 --> 00:57:38.700]   But there's nothing unethical necessarily about it.
[00:57:38.700 --> 00:57:42.180]   But if you look at what are the interests
[00:57:42.180 --> 00:57:44.060]   for the person who's involved?
[00:57:44.060 --> 00:57:45.980]   And so you need a certain product set
[00:57:45.980 --> 00:57:46.860]   that's gonna work for you.
[00:57:46.860 --> 00:57:48.540]   So as I started off in that,
[00:57:48.540 --> 00:57:51.460]   I was able to make enough money to live.
[00:57:51.460 --> 00:57:52.620]   And one of the things that's important
[00:57:52.620 --> 00:57:54.540]   is I did not wanna start with a firm
[00:57:54.540 --> 00:57:56.060]   that paid a salary.
[00:57:56.060 --> 00:57:58.540]   I wanted to start with a firm where it was commissioned.
[00:57:58.540 --> 00:58:00.060]   I didn't want a boss.
[00:58:00.060 --> 00:58:00.980]   I didn't want somebody that said,
[00:58:00.980 --> 00:58:02.340]   "You have to be here at this certain time."
[00:58:02.340 --> 00:58:04.580]   I've always pried it, praised, preferred,
[00:58:04.580 --> 00:58:05.420]   not the wrong word.
[00:58:05.420 --> 00:58:08.300]   I've always wanted my own personal lifestyle independence.
[00:58:08.300 --> 00:58:11.380]   And if I have a salary and I'm expected to be in the office
[00:58:11.380 --> 00:58:14.420]   at 7.30 in the morning in order for me to get my salary
[00:58:14.420 --> 00:58:16.160]   while I'm in training, I didn't want that.
[00:58:16.160 --> 00:58:19.140]   I'd rather work and just be responsible for myself.
[00:58:19.140 --> 00:58:21.740]   And when I started, I had savings.
[00:58:21.740 --> 00:58:24.000]   I had at least six months of cash.
[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:25.900]   So I could get through that initial period
[00:58:25.900 --> 00:58:28.340]   until I could get my client base started to be set up.
[00:58:28.340 --> 00:58:31.020]   And that's an important consideration.
[00:58:31.020 --> 00:58:32.540]   So along the way, me personally,
[00:58:32.540 --> 00:58:35.620]   I studied and I tried to learn what I needed to know
[00:58:35.620 --> 00:58:38.140]   in order to work my way into new markets.
[00:58:38.140 --> 00:58:41.380]   I learned that I enjoy complex planning.
[00:58:41.380 --> 00:58:43.300]   So I started to move into the retirement market
[00:58:43.300 --> 00:58:45.380]   and away from the kitchen table market.
[00:58:45.380 --> 00:58:47.100]   Nothing wrong with kitchen table market.
[00:58:47.100 --> 00:58:48.780]   I just didn't particularly enjoy it.
[00:58:48.780 --> 00:58:50.500]   I like complex scenarios.
[00:58:50.500 --> 00:58:53.440]   I like sitting down and looking at a client
[00:58:53.440 --> 00:58:55.860]   that has an inheritance here and a piece of real estate there
[00:58:55.860 --> 00:58:58.660]   and a rental property here and some land here
[00:58:58.660 --> 00:59:01.540]   and a house here and kids here and a college fund.
[00:59:01.540 --> 00:59:03.780]   I like that complexity 'cause it interests me.
[00:59:03.780 --> 00:59:06.360]   It engages that part of my personality.
[00:59:06.360 --> 00:59:08.620]   I don't like doing the same thing over and over again.
[00:59:08.620 --> 00:59:11.300]   There are financial people that I have known
[00:59:11.300 --> 00:59:13.860]   that love doing the same thing over again.
[00:59:13.860 --> 00:59:17.020]   They're a better fit for the kitchen table market.
[00:59:17.020 --> 00:59:18.860]   So I learned what I needed to learn
[00:59:18.860 --> 00:59:21.380]   so that I could switch over.
[00:59:21.380 --> 00:59:24.360]   And so the key is knowing what you want to do,
[00:59:24.360 --> 00:59:26.320]   but that comes with time.
[00:59:26.320 --> 00:59:29.280]   Now, over time I got to the point
[00:59:29.280 --> 00:59:32.020]   where I could set up a firm on my own.
[00:59:32.020 --> 00:59:36.500]   Today, I could set up my own firm and run my own firm.
[00:59:36.500 --> 00:59:37.600]   There is not a chance in the world
[00:59:37.600 --> 00:59:40.080]   I could have done that at 23 years old.
[00:59:40.080 --> 00:59:41.480]   I needed training.
[00:59:41.480 --> 00:59:42.800]   I needed somebody to show me
[00:59:42.800 --> 00:59:44.560]   how to have a financial conversation,
[00:59:44.560 --> 00:59:46.720]   how to ask somebody how much money they make.
[00:59:46.720 --> 00:59:47.560]   If you've never done that,
[00:59:47.560 --> 00:59:51.540]   that is a very difficult thing to ask your first time.
[00:59:51.540 --> 00:59:52.980]   You're used to not talking about money
[00:59:52.980 --> 00:59:54.580]   and you ask someone, "How much do you make?"
[00:59:54.580 --> 00:59:56.140]   You need a little training on that.
[00:59:56.140 --> 00:59:59.180]   And so I needed to work somewhere where I could be trained.
[00:59:59.180 --> 01:00:02.140]   I can't conceive of how most people
[01:00:02.140 --> 01:00:03.860]   could start on their own,
[01:00:03.860 --> 01:00:06.100]   setting up an independent firm from the beginning,
[01:00:06.100 --> 01:00:07.140]   and make it a success.
[01:00:07.140 --> 01:00:08.000]   I really can't.
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:11.780]   So I needed a training company.
[01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:13.060]   That was one of the things that attracted me
[01:00:13.060 --> 01:00:14.820]   to the firm that I joined is I needed the training.
[01:00:14.820 --> 01:00:17.580]   And they were well known for having excellent training.
[01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:21.180]   Now, you also need for whatever your firm is,
[01:00:21.180 --> 01:00:23.560]   you need a marketing plan that's gonna allow you to connect
[01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:25.600]   with an appropriate audience.
[01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:26.580]   So here would be a good example.
[01:00:26.580 --> 01:00:29.240]   Let's say that you have a real passion for helping people
[01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:31.240]   with their individual personal finances,
[01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:34.600]   their budget coaching, and helping people get out of debt.
[01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:37.680]   How are you going to connect with people
[01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:39.240]   who need to get out of debt,
[01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:41.160]   who are willing to actually do the work,
[01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:43.160]   and who are willing to pay you
[01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:45.160]   for your advice on getting out of debt?
[01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:47.400]   Frankly, I don't know how anybody
[01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:48.760]   can make this business model work.
[01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:52.840]   I've spoken with a couple of people who are working at it.
[01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:54.320]   I haven't, and I had a couple of people
[01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:56.280]   that I've interacted with that tried it.
[01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:59.920]   Dave Ramsey has a whole organization of debt coaches.
[01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:02.680]   I'm sure he has some people that are successful with that.
[01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:03.960]   I haven't met them yet.
[01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:05.740]   I don't know how you can charge someone
[01:01:05.740 --> 01:01:08.440]   who's not financially responsible
[01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:11.340]   to help get out of debt and have that work
[01:01:11.340 --> 01:01:14.040]   on a long-term basis and find enough of those people.
[01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:16.740]   If you have a massive marketing plan,
[01:01:16.740 --> 01:01:18.720]   for example, i.e. the Dave Ramsey show,
[01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:19.720]   I think you can do it,
[01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:21.300]   but I don't see how an individual person
[01:01:21.300 --> 01:01:24.200]   without that large of a marketing audience behind them
[01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:26.400]   can actually set that up and do it.
[01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:28.320]   But if that's the case, though,
[01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:31.040]   you need to figure out who's my marketing plan.
[01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:32.320]   Okay, I need people to get out of debt.
[01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:33.760]   That means I'm not working on Palm Beach.
[01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:34.960]   I'm not working on Jupiter Island.
[01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:38.800]   I'm not working in San Francisco with tech billionaires.
[01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:40.440]   I'm working with people who get out of debt.
[01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:41.440]   So that would be a great approach
[01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:43.200]   to set up a get out of debt blog,
[01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:45.200]   set up a get out of debt podcast,
[01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:48.720]   and build that up.
[01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:51.400]   But if you want to do portfolio management
[01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:53.360]   and you have a unique investment strategy
[01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:55.640]   that you think has value,
[01:01:55.640 --> 01:01:56.640]   you've got to figure out
[01:01:56.640 --> 01:01:58.340]   what's my marketing plan in that direction.
[01:01:58.340 --> 01:02:00.400]   How are you going to build that firm?
[01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:02.900]   And you need a financially viable path
[01:02:02.900 --> 01:02:04.560]   to make the transition.
[01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:08.440]   How are you actually going to fund yourself as you start?
[01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:11.840]   So when I started with Northwestern Mutual,
[01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:15.720]   I knew that I couldn't go down and figure out
[01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:18.560]   I don't have a million dollar people in my pocket.
[01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:19.560]   Somehow that I can pick up the phone
[01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:20.560]   and get a bunch of appointments
[01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:21.560]   and bring in million dollar portfolios.
[01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:22.560]   I was 23 years old.
[01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:23.560]   I had a baby face.
[01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:27.220]   I've always been – I had a baby face
[01:02:27.220 --> 01:02:29.200]   and I looked 12 until I stood up
[01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:30.380]   and then people thought I was 30.
[01:02:30.380 --> 01:02:33.920]   But the point is that I needed to work
[01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:35.360]   on somewhere where I could actually do it
[01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:37.200]   and I had the funds to get started
[01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:41.160]   in straight commission insurance sales.
[01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:43.400]   Now if I didn't,
[01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:45.440]   I would have needed to do something else.
[01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:47.640]   I would have needed to work as a staff planner
[01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:48.960]   if I had a CFP.
[01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:49.960]   I would have needed to work
[01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:51.600]   as an administrative assistant.
[01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:53.000]   I would have needed to work someplace
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:54.220]   where they would pay me a salary
[01:02:54.220 --> 01:02:56.480]   to be in a supporting role on a team
[01:02:56.480 --> 01:02:58.320]   while I learned what I needed to know.
[01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:00.320]   You got to figure out what's the planning time.
[01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:01.320]   So for example,
[01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:03.440]   I think the certified financial planning designation
[01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:04.880]   is quickly going to become
[01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:07.480]   not a nice to have in the financial industry
[01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:09.520]   but an entry level you must have this
[01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:10.520]   in many ways in the way
[01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:14.280]   that the CPA designation has become for accountants.
[01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:15.360]   For many accounting majors
[01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:18.200]   who have an interest in accounting and working,
[01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:22.120]   it's become – I mean the CPA is expected
[01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:23.520]   more than it ever was in the past.
[01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:25.400]   I'll put it that way.
[01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:26.400]   Although I did just read something
[01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:27.400]   that made me question that
[01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:28.680]   that I realized I needed to research
[01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:31.160]   and make sure that's still the case.
[01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:32.600]   But if you don't have –
[01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:33.600]   the point is the CFP,
[01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:36.000]   you're going to need three years of experience.
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:37.920]   So if you're going to hold yourself out
[01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:40.560]   as a fee only financial planner,
[01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:42.320]   how are you going to get the experience
[01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:47.360]   that you need in order to launch your own firm?
[01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:49.680]   That would be a question.
[01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:53.040]   I think you need to clearly identify
[01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:54.240]   what you want to do.
[01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:55.880]   So when you're building a firm,
[01:03:55.880 --> 01:03:56.880]   who do you want to work with?
[01:03:56.880 --> 01:03:58.440]   What kind of practice do you want?
[01:03:58.440 --> 01:03:59.440]   Do you want a local office
[01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:01.240]   or do you want a virtual office?
[01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:03.200]   At this stage, my backup plan
[01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:04.800]   if this radical personal finance
[01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:06.560]   business venture fails,
[01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:07.680]   my backup plan is I'll start
[01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:08.720]   another financial planning firm
[01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:09.720]   but I will do it virtually.
[01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:11.240]   I don't have any desire
[01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:13.160]   to have a physical office space.
[01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:15.640]   I would do it virtually.
[01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:16.960]   And who knows?
[01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:18.280]   I don't think at this stage
[01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:20.680]   that I'll do that but maybe someday I will.
[01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:22.360]   You never know.
[01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:23.360]   When you figure out
[01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:24.880]   what kind of client do you want,
[01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:28.040]   do you want a mainstream professional?
[01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:30.320]   Are you a really detailed oriented person
[01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:32.840]   that you like working with engineers?
[01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:34.400]   Do you like working with doctors?
[01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:37.040]   Do you like working with attorneys?
[01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:38.240]   Those are three professions
[01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:39.880]   that I would prefer.
[01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:41.440]   I only had one or two engineers
[01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:43.080]   that I was able to effectively work with
[01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:44.600]   and many physicians and attorneys
[01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:47.360]   I've not worked well with as an individual.
[01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:49.080]   Not that there's necessarily anything wrong
[01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:50.760]   but sometimes the personality,
[01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:53.240]   there can be certain personality conflicts.
[01:04:53.240 --> 01:04:55.000]   I like blue collar business owners.
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:56.800]   That's who I have enjoyed working with,
[01:04:56.800 --> 01:04:58.960]   more down to earth, less flashy.
[01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:01.200]   That's kind of my personality.
[01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:03.480]   But do you want to work with mainstream clients?
[01:05:03.480 --> 01:05:04.560]   Were you doing mainstream planning?
[01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:06.800]   Are you, the dollar's going to crash
[01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:07.640]   and let me figure out how to get you
[01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:08.480]   into precious metals.
[01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:09.960]   Well, go do that then.
[01:05:09.960 --> 01:05:12.560]   Are you into international expatriation?
[01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:14.160]   So you're going to launch a consulting
[01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:15.360]   financial planning firm,
[01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:18.160]   helping people to get out of the United States
[01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:21.480]   and move to Singapore or wherever.
[01:05:21.480 --> 01:05:22.560]   Or do you like taxes?
[01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:24.280]   So therefore you're going to be a tax consultant.
[01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:26.480]   Well, are you going to do tax returns?
[01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:30.640]   Or are you going to just simply be a consultant?
[01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:31.680]   Are you going to do life insurance,
[01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:33.000]   general planning or whatever?
[01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000]   So you got to figure out what kind of practice you want,
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:36.560]   what kind of client you want.
[01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:39.000]   Then you need to know, is it financially viable?
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:43.440]   How long does it take to actually build a client base?
[01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:46.000]   It takes a while.
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:47.880]   You've got to talk to a lot of people
[01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:50.440]   and you got to find people in any business,
[01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:51.640]   especially in financial planning,
[01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:55.360]   you got to find people who are at an appropriate stage
[01:05:55.360 --> 01:05:57.560]   where they're ready to make a transition
[01:05:57.560 --> 01:05:59.400]   and you're on their radar screen.
[01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:02.320]   The financial planning business is very much about timing.
[01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:07.200]   The timing has to be right for there to be a good fit.
[01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:09.440]   Clients working to get out of debt,
[01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:11.400]   timing is not so great for investments.
[01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:15.360]   They might like you, they might love you,
[01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:17.520]   but they're working on getting out of debt
[01:06:17.520 --> 01:06:19.240]   and that's what they should be doing.
[01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:21.640]   So you've got to, in financial planning,
[01:06:21.640 --> 01:06:24.680]   a lot of it is just being on the radar screen of somebody
[01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:26.200]   at the appropriate timing.
[01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:27.960]   And so you got to know,
[01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:30.760]   can I afford to actually do this?
[01:06:30.760 --> 01:06:33.080]   Or do I need to go and get a corporate job working
[01:06:33.080 --> 01:06:36.400]   so I can save some money till I can't afford to do it?
[01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:38.840]   What skills do you actually have?
[01:06:38.840 --> 01:06:42.360]   And what skills don't you have that you need to develop?
[01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:46.680]   Personal finance knowledge may qualify you
[01:06:46.680 --> 01:06:49.880]   to help as a budget coach.
[01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:52.080]   It may qualify you to help somebody
[01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:55.640]   with building out a goal plan.
[01:06:55.640 --> 01:06:58.000]   Hey, listen, you can put some money aside.
[01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:02.120]   It does not qualify you to give in-depth financial advice.
[01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:03.080]   That's why I do this show,
[01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:04.280]   'cause I get sick and tired of people
[01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:06.800]   who are not qualified to give in-depth financial advice
[01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:09.160]   giving in-depth financial advice.
[01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:13.320]   529 or ESA is not just a slam dunk where you give a rule.
[01:07:13.320 --> 01:07:14.720]   It's very much about an individual.
[01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:16.840]   And I said, somebody needs to do this better.
[01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:19.200]   But I tell you, I could not have done this show
[01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:21.560]   when I was 23.
[01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:24.680]   I thought I was arrogant enough to think I could.
[01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:26.920]   'Cause after all, I know everything I know
[01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:28.000]   about personal finance.
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.560]   I was typical 23-year-old, I guess.
[01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:34.640]   But I thought I could, but I could not have done it.
[01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:36.720]   Some years of reading personal finance books
[01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:39.360]   and some years of trolling around forums
[01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:41.360]   and reading blogs did not prepare me,
[01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:44.200]   would not have prepared me to do what I do on this show.
[01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:45.040]   And that's okay.
[01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:47.600]   It's okay to take time to learn something.
[01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:49.120]   I'll tell you what I couldn't have done
[01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:50.200]   is I had everything,
[01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:53.800]   and for one or two of the authors writing to me,
[01:07:53.800 --> 01:07:55.240]   who knows, maybe for you,
[01:07:55.240 --> 01:07:56.520]   this is supposed to have a general audience,
[01:07:56.520 --> 01:08:00.000]   but I'll tell you, if I had tried to start doing this show
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.560]   at 23, I'll tell you where I would have gone wrong.
[01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:06.920]   I didn't have at that time any personal empathy
[01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:08.760]   for the challenges of real people.
[01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:11.980]   At that time, I had everything worked out in my brain
[01:08:11.980 --> 01:08:14.760]   of how everything should ideally be.
[01:08:14.760 --> 01:08:16.620]   But having not walked with clients
[01:08:16.620 --> 01:08:18.560]   through difficult situations
[01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:20.720]   and having not grown up a little bit,
[01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:23.520]   I don't think I would have had any of the perspective
[01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:27.840]   that it takes to actually be able to appeal
[01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:29.960]   to a larger audience.
[01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:32.960]   I hadn't worked with going through with a grandfather
[01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:35.840]   who had dementia and then knowing what that was like,
[01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:37.500]   so now I can understand people
[01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:40.440]   who are working as caregivers for their grandparents.
[01:08:40.440 --> 01:08:43.200]   Hadn't gone through what it's like to get married,
[01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:46.760]   so I wouldn't have been qualified to give advice
[01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:50.700]   on here's what you need to do to go through being married.
[01:08:50.700 --> 01:08:52.600]   Hadn't gone through the challenges
[01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:56.240]   of finding people with radically different perspectives,
[01:08:56.240 --> 01:08:57.960]   with radically different goals,
[01:08:57.960 --> 01:08:59.820]   and understanding that there are different people
[01:08:59.820 --> 01:09:01.840]   who love different fee structures,
[01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:04.360]   different approaches, different perspectives.
[01:09:04.360 --> 01:09:05.280]   How do you work with someone
[01:09:05.280 --> 01:09:07.120]   who doesn't trust the stock market
[01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:08.960]   and give good financial advice?
[01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:09.880]   How do you work with someone
[01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:12.120]   who only wants to invest in the stock market
[01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:13.080]   and give financial advice?
[01:09:13.080 --> 01:09:15.680]   I couldn't have done that without those six years
[01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:16.620]   of working with clients.
[01:09:16.620 --> 01:09:18.080]   I learned a lot.
[01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:21.800]   And I guess, I think we short circuit this sometimes.
[01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:24.160]   I tend to, we have a culture today
[01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:28.520]   that seems to prize and praise the quick starter,
[01:09:28.520 --> 01:09:31.320]   the quick success story.
[01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:33.240]   I'm a millionaire by 25, that's awesome,
[01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:34.400]   but you know what?
[01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:36.280]   That's tough for many people to repeat.
[01:09:36.280 --> 01:09:38.680]   Hopefully I can lay out a, sketch out a plan
[01:09:38.680 --> 01:09:43.680]   to help my son do that, but what does that say
[01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:45.680]   to the people who aren't millionaires at 25
[01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:47.200]   or millionaires at 55?
[01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:51.080]   It takes a little time to build some compassion
[01:09:51.080 --> 01:09:52.200]   to work with people.
[01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:53.760]   And so you might recognize
[01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:55.280]   that I need to get started at something.
[01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:56.400]   I might need to work something.
[01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:59.840]   It's like, who is qualified to be an executive chef
[01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:02.320]   when they just got out of culinary school at 20 years old?
[01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:04.800]   You're not, you're simply not.
[01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:07.800]   And in our culture, we seem to have forgotten that a lot,
[01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:10.000]   especially in the internet world.
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.160]   My advice to young people, be careful
[01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:13.720]   what advice you get in the internet world
[01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:17.080]   because there may be ways to become a quick success story,
[01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:19.240]   but I tell you, the more success stories I look at,
[01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:20.680]   just doesn't happen.
[01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:22.960]   It's a lot of hard work that's not been seen.
[01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:27.240]   I read an article last night by Gary Vaynerchuk
[01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:29.880]   and he was talking about, it was an article
[01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:32.360]   that he published on Medium.
[01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:35.240]   He entitled it, "Stop asking me about your personal brand
[01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:37.600]   "and start doing some work."
[01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:40.560]   He talked about the people, he's known as this branding guy.
[01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:41.720]   People say, "How do I set up my brand?"
[01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:45.480]   And he says, "I spent 10 years working like a crazy man
[01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:49.040]   "to build up my knowledge and to build up,
[01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:51.840]   "to become somebody that knew something."
[01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:55.680]   And in many ways, we've inserted this idea
[01:10:55.680 --> 01:10:57.800]   of credentialization as knowledge,
[01:10:57.800 --> 01:10:59.840]   or have this degree or have this certification
[01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:01.640]   and that's knowledge, and we've discarded
[01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:04.760]   the value of experience, but experience has value.
[01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:06.920]   At some point, who am I to tell you
[01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:08.040]   when you're experienced enough?
[01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:11.040]   But you have to ask yourself, am I experienced enough?
[01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:15.320]   Telling you, go work as a staff planner somewhere
[01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:17.840]   for a few years before you try to open your own business
[01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:20.160]   and you'll learn a little bit in person.
[01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:23.900]   Anybody who's done something that,
[01:11:23.900 --> 01:11:27.960]   I hesitate to use myself, but,
[01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:33.200]   gaffing a CFP credential is really not that big of a deal.
[01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:34.480]   I mean, it is a big deal.
[01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:36.440]   Let me diminish other people's achievements,
[01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:39.960]   but it's not a big deal as it is if you think about
[01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:41.360]   all the other work that's involved.
[01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:43.200]   I spent a lot of mornings of my life getting up
[01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:47.280]   very early and studying a lot of really boring textbooks
[01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:48.960]   to be able to do what I do now.
[01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:50.160]   So you've got to put that time in.
[01:11:50.160 --> 01:11:52.280]   It's not just a matter of, oh, I've got some personal
[01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:54.760]   finance knowledge, now I'm gonna be a brilliant advisor.
[01:11:54.760 --> 01:11:56.640]   Becoming a really great financial advisor,
[01:11:56.640 --> 01:11:58.880]   I think, is one of the most difficult things in the world.
[01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:00.800]   'Cause you gotta take all the technical knowledge
[01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:03.040]   that actually doesn't matter to most people.
[01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:04.440]   'Cause most people cannot distinguish
[01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:05.400]   the technical knowledge.
[01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:08.160]   And you gotta combine that with an ability
[01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:11.160]   to work with people relationally,
[01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:13.080]   and to recognize when you're being too aggressive
[01:12:13.080 --> 01:12:15.400]   and to recognize when you're not being aggressive enough,
[01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:17.920]   to recognize when you need to make someone uncomfortable,
[01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:20.160]   to recognize when you need to make someone comfortable,
[01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:22.280]   to recognize the scale at which you're dealing
[01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:24.680]   when you need to, it's, and I'm not sure
[01:12:24.680 --> 01:12:25.580]   that I'm even great at it,
[01:12:25.580 --> 01:12:28.080]   but I recognize the challenge of it.
[01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:31.620]   And so I commend it to you to really take it seriously.
[01:12:31.620 --> 01:12:34.080]   And you can do that.
[01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:36.640]   Just set out an education plan for yourself.
[01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:39.840]   And if you wanna transition from being an auditor,
[01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:42.960]   and you wanna get your CFP or your CPA/PFS
[01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:46.200]   or whatever you wanna do, set out the educational plan.
[01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:48.200]   And then start working with people.
[01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:49.880]   Start talking to a financial advisor.
[01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:52.200]   Start looking for opportunities.
[01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:54.380]   Start networking around and asking people,
[01:12:54.380 --> 01:12:56.880]   how do I develop this knowledge?
[01:12:56.880 --> 01:12:59.520]   Maybe do some tax planning on the side if you're a CPA.
[01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:03.120]   Do a little bit of, build up a side business of tax work.
[01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:04.520]   And let that be your entryway.
[01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:07.680]   If you don't have a marketing plan, start one today.
[01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:10.320]   Start your blog, start your podcast.
[01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:14.480]   Start, if you need to build up a network, build one.
[01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:16.040]   Start getting networked in the community.
[01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:20.080]   Go to Rotary, go to Kiwanis, go to Toastmasters,
[01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:22.440]   go to your Chamber of Commerce meetings.
[01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:24.560]   Build that plan.
[01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:27.320]   One of the reasons why I did well in my first couple years
[01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:30.760]   is when I sat down my first day as a financial advisor,
[01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:34.840]   I was 23, but I had 2,000 people sitting in my cell phone
[01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:36.700]   that had some connection with me
[01:13:36.700 --> 01:13:39.000]   that I could go to and talk to.
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.680]   That was a lot easier to get started there
[01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:44.000]   than to move on and start cold calling
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.620]   out of the phone book.
[01:13:46.620 --> 01:13:49.160]   So I had an asset, and I knew I had an asset
[01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:51.080]   because I'd been paying attention over the years.
[01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:52.600]   May not have been 2,000, may have been 1,000.
[01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:53.720]   I'm not sure the exact number.
[01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:54.560]   It was a lot.
[01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:57.760]   I never actually got through all of my initial phoning list.
[01:13:57.760 --> 01:13:59.400]   And by the way, if you're getting started
[01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:00.760]   in the financial planning business,
[01:14:00.760 --> 01:14:04.720]   don't expect anybody that you know to buy from you, period.
[01:14:04.720 --> 01:14:07.140]   Because they don't.
[01:14:07.140 --> 01:14:08.280]   Because they know you.
[01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:09.920]   And they're sick and tired of you telling them
[01:14:09.920 --> 01:14:11.520]   what to do with your money.
[01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:13.720]   Or what to do with their money.
[01:14:13.720 --> 01:14:14.840]   That's how it is.
[01:14:14.840 --> 01:14:17.400]   It takes years for the people that are closest to you
[01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:18.240]   to become your clients.
[01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:19.640]   It takes years.
[01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:20.580]   It really does.
[01:14:20.580 --> 01:14:25.800]   If you have a background,
[01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:27.740]   and I don't know what fit is right for you,
[01:14:27.740 --> 01:14:30.360]   it's not that tough today to go out
[01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:31.560]   and set up an independent firm.
[01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:35.640]   So for example, the listener who wrote me the email
[01:14:35.640 --> 01:14:39.280]   and is a physician and is in his 50s,
[01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:41.760]   with two or three years of focused study
[01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:43.240]   to build up the technical knowledge
[01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:45.560]   and all of that background in the medical business,
[01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:47.040]   if you had any interest in working
[01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:49.320]   in the medical marketplace,
[01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:51.880]   I would say that somebody in that perspective
[01:14:51.880 --> 01:14:54.320]   with business experience and customer experience
[01:14:54.320 --> 01:14:57.480]   and patient experience and all of the medical experience,
[01:14:57.480 --> 01:14:59.280]   I would say somebody in that market
[01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:01.640]   could set up an independent firm.
[01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:06.640]   And for basically today, 10 to 15,000 bucks out of pocket,
[01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:08.420]   you know, depending on your skill level,
[01:15:08.420 --> 01:15:10.240]   depending on how much you're willing to do yourself,
[01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:13.520]   for 10 grand, you can set up an independent firm.
[01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:16.800]   You can establish a registered investment advisory firm.
[01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:20.080]   You can go and get the appropriate licensing that you need.
[01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:22.840]   You need your 65, your series 65.
[01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:25.080]   Get your CFP designation.
[01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:26.720]   File your paperwork.
[01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:28.560]   You can have the money that you need
[01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:30.280]   to set up the compliance.
[01:15:30.280 --> 01:15:32.240]   You can set up the funds and reserve.
[01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:35.480]   I would say 10 to 15 grand is doable.
[01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:37.780]   And so that one could, you know,
[01:15:37.780 --> 01:15:40.460]   that listener could probably do this.
[01:15:40.460 --> 01:15:43.160]   If you're just interested in getting into the business
[01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:44.960]   and you don't have 10 or 15 grand
[01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:47.080]   or you don't have years of experience
[01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:48.120]   as someone like a physician
[01:15:48.120 --> 01:15:49.720]   who you're used to working with clients
[01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:51.280]   and asking difficult questions,
[01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:53.500]   that experience is very transferable.
[01:15:53.500 --> 01:15:54.840]   I'm not sure that the experience
[01:15:54.840 --> 01:15:56.440]   of being an auditor is transferable.
[01:15:56.440 --> 01:15:58.200]   Maybe it is, I've never been an auditor.
[01:15:58.200 --> 01:16:00.000]   But you would need to learn a little bit.
[01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.800]   And so I would just go and try to get into,
[01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:04.920]   you know, many accounting firms
[01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:07.280]   will have a financial services arm.
[01:16:07.280 --> 01:16:09.620]   Make friends there, see if you can transition over.
[01:16:09.620 --> 01:16:11.320]   When you're not in a busy season
[01:16:11.320 --> 01:16:13.600]   with corporate returns or individual returns
[01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:15.760]   or auditing work, I guess auditors,
[01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:17.520]   you're not necessarily gonna have that same season.
[01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:19.700]   But then maybe you can start working
[01:16:19.700 --> 01:16:21.160]   and make friends with the person in your firm
[01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:22.380]   who's doing financial services
[01:16:22.380 --> 01:16:24.500]   and go on some appointments, shadow,
[01:16:24.500 --> 01:16:28.160]   and see if it's something that you think would work.
[01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:29.720]   But you've gotta build out a transition plan.
[01:16:29.720 --> 01:16:31.320]   You need to be very honest with yourself
[01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:32.900]   about your actual skills.
[01:16:32.900 --> 01:16:37.720]   Don't dismiss just the need to go and work for a firm.
[01:16:37.720 --> 01:16:40.720]   I believe that at many firms, not all,
[01:16:40.720 --> 01:16:43.480]   I've got a few locally big names that I just,
[01:16:43.480 --> 01:16:45.640]   I'm not so sure about, but at many firms,
[01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:47.800]   you can find a way to work with clients
[01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:49.600]   in a really beautiful way.
[01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:51.600]   And you can do it ethically, you can do it
[01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:53.720]   and feel good about the work that you're doing.
[01:16:53.720 --> 01:16:55.760]   'Cause I'll tell you this,
[01:16:55.760 --> 01:17:00.080]   there is so much of a demand for great financial advisors
[01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:01.960]   and I believe it's never been easier in life
[01:17:01.960 --> 01:17:03.400]   than to market to a niche audience.
[01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:05.440]   I really do think that the wire houses
[01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:07.640]   are gonna have to change in the coming years.
[01:17:07.640 --> 01:17:10.360]   The restriction, the reason I ultimately left Northwestern,
[01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:11.600]   I couldn't do this show.
[01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:14.060]   That's gotta change because with the number of emails
[01:17:14.060 --> 01:17:15.760]   that I get now from people saying,
[01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:18.560]   "Joshua, will you do planning work for me?"
[01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:22.400]   I mean, this is a powerful, powerful marketing tool.
[01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:25.320]   And the transition has gotta happen
[01:17:25.320 --> 01:17:27.500]   because the corporatized, I think people are sick
[01:17:27.500 --> 01:17:31.560]   and tired of the corporate sanitized professional image.
[01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:34.660]   And it's like, and the trust level is so low.
[01:17:34.660 --> 01:17:36.260]   So I don't know how it's gonna happen
[01:17:36.260 --> 01:17:38.500]   'cause the rules are pretty strict for a broker dealer,
[01:17:38.500 --> 01:17:40.600]   but I think it is gonna happen.
[01:17:40.600 --> 01:17:42.840]   So I'm rambling a little bit here at the end,
[01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:44.920]   I'm off my outline, so I'm gonna wrap up.
[01:17:44.920 --> 01:17:47.320]   But I hope these thoughts are helpful for you.
[01:17:47.320 --> 01:17:49.720]   I'm not going through the technical details purposely
[01:17:49.720 --> 01:17:53.600]   of how do I set up an RIA and how do I write my form 80V
[01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:57.320]   and how do I do this, spend a little time online.
[01:17:57.320 --> 01:17:59.200]   It's pretty easy if you wanna go that route,
[01:17:59.200 --> 01:18:01.400]   but I just would hate to see somebody,
[01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:02.880]   I mean, it's not easy, but it's doable.
[01:18:02.880 --> 01:18:06.120]   Check out what Alan Moore is doing at XY Planning Network.
[01:18:06.120 --> 01:18:10.480]   They're basically building a turnkey business model
[01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:13.520]   where they can help you with coaches and with materials
[01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:15.140]   to set up an independent firm.
[01:18:15.140 --> 01:18:17.960]   If you've got some industry background,
[01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:19.040]   I think that can work for you.
[01:18:19.040 --> 01:18:20.540]   If you haven't, if you don't,
[01:18:22.920 --> 01:18:24.800]   maybe I just don't have enough confidence,
[01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:26.560]   but I can't imagine somebody who doesn't have
[01:18:26.560 --> 01:18:27.840]   a little bit of industry background
[01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:29.680]   or who hasn't been under somebody's wing
[01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:33.440]   in financial planning making that transition.
[01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:35.960]   If you're an accountant, get over and work
[01:18:35.960 --> 01:18:39.500]   in somebody's office as a support staff
[01:18:39.500 --> 01:18:42.640]   in financial planning and get that experience
[01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:45.640]   so that you can figure out if it's right for you.
[01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:47.440]   Hope this is helpful to some of you.
[01:18:50.440 --> 01:18:51.600]   It's a question I get a lot,
[01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:53.960]   and hopefully this provides a little bit of insight.
[01:18:53.960 --> 01:18:55.400]   I would say this.
[01:18:55.400 --> 01:18:57.840]   We need great financial advisors now,
[01:18:57.840 --> 01:19:00.060]   and the demand for great financial advisors is there,
[01:19:00.060 --> 01:19:04.280]   and the ability now in 2015 to cut this channel.
[01:19:04.280 --> 01:19:05.680]   Before, if you were gonna advertise,
[01:19:05.680 --> 01:19:07.120]   there wasn't any possibility
[01:19:07.120 --> 01:19:08.680]   that an individual could advertise.
[01:19:08.680 --> 01:19:12.920]   I couldn't afford to take out an ad in a newspaper
[01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:17.360]   and pay those fees for some stupid branding ad
[01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:19.940]   that didn't mean anything, but in today's world,
[01:19:19.940 --> 01:19:22.840]   when you can connect content to individual,
[01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:24.660]   I think we're gonna see a massive growth,
[01:19:24.660 --> 01:19:26.680]   and my hope is that we can help this.
[01:19:26.680 --> 01:19:28.680]   We in the financial services industry
[01:19:28.680 --> 01:19:32.780]   can rescue our ratings and our trust
[01:19:32.780 --> 01:19:34.740]   by making sure that we're not working with people
[01:19:34.740 --> 01:19:37.000]   who are not a good fit for us as a client
[01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:40.560]   and making sure that, just by making sure that.
[01:19:40.560 --> 01:19:45.560]   That's the key, is making sure that you're a good fit.
[01:19:45.560 --> 01:19:48.900]   There's a need for everything,
[01:19:48.900 --> 01:19:51.080]   but don't put someone who doesn't trust the stock market
[01:19:51.080 --> 01:19:56.080]   into the stock market, and don't try to sell
[01:19:56.080 --> 01:19:58.280]   the wrong products to the wrong people.
[01:19:58.280 --> 01:20:01.040]   Find the right people and make the right referrals,
[01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:03.660]   and that's what changes it over time.
[01:20:03.660 --> 01:20:06.040]   There are a lot of products I love.
[01:20:06.040 --> 01:20:08.000]   Probably the most contentious one
[01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:11.000]   is things like insurance, life insurance.
[01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.720]   This is the contentious one that everyone argues about.
[01:20:13.720 --> 01:20:14.900]   Biggest life insurance I made
[01:20:14.900 --> 01:20:17.840]   was my final year of my time at Northwestern.
[01:20:17.840 --> 01:20:21.800]   It was $50,000 of annual premium, and it was a perfect sale.
[01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:24.400]   The perfect set of needs, the perfect goals,
[01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:26.080]   the perfect client perspective,
[01:20:26.080 --> 01:20:28.640]   exactly the right design of the policy.
[01:20:28.640 --> 01:20:30.760]   It was 50,000 bucks of commission,
[01:20:30.760 --> 01:20:33.320]   excuse me, not commission, of premium.
[01:20:33.320 --> 01:20:36.640]   But the key was, you don't try to do that
[01:20:36.640 --> 01:20:38.520]   when you're three days in the industry
[01:20:38.520 --> 01:20:39.800]   and you don't have a clue what you're doing
[01:20:39.800 --> 01:20:42.280]   and you're just gonna go out and do that.
[01:20:42.280 --> 01:20:44.780]   I've done a lot of, anyway, I'm done.
[01:20:44.780 --> 01:20:46.960]   I hope this is helpful to you guys.
[01:20:46.960 --> 01:20:48.800]   Thank you guys so much for listening.
[01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:51.280]   Yeah, kind of an inside look
[01:20:51.280 --> 01:20:52.840]   at the financial planning business.
[01:20:52.840 --> 01:20:54.880]   I'll be back with you tomorrow for Q&A show

[01:20:57.040 --> 01:20:58.760]   on some more in-depth topics.
[01:20:58.760 --> 01:21:00.800]   Didn't mean to be so introspective here at the end.
[01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:02.200]   Have a great day, everybody.
