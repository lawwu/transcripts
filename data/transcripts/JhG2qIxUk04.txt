[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   Pastor John, can a sinner repent and be saved in their final moments leading up to their death?
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   Before the answer can be given to that question, we have to ask, "Which sinner?"
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   Which might seem strange, I suppose.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   The sinner who can genuinely repent, genuinely trust, genuinely be changed into a lover of Christ
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   who deeply regrets a life wasted in preferring the world to Christ,
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   that's one kind of sinner who might try to repent.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   But there's little reason to think that anyone who puts off repentance and loves sin for a whole lifetime
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   would ever become that kind of sinner at the end,
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   who genuinely repents, genuinely trusts, genuinely loves Jesus, now genuinely hates sin,
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   genuinely regrets a whole life of sinning.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   The mistake that so many make when they contemplate the possibility of putting off Christ
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   is that they think it's like snapping their finger.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   It's like choosing to eat or not eat, and it isn't.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   You can't choose to raise yourself from the dead.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   You can't choose to stop loving the world, especially when you have loved it for 70 years.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   I wonder if people who contemplate this possibility and wonder about it read Romans 8, 7,
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   "The mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   It does not submit to God's law. Indeed, it cannot."
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   That's why I said, if you're going to ask, "Can a sinner repent at the moment of death?"
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   I said, "Which sinner?"
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   "This one can't, and the can't is not God won't let him,
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   but he doesn't have it in himself to change himself."
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   "I can't. I'm a lover of the flesh," or 1 Corinthians 2, 14.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   "The natural person does not accept the things of the Spirit of God.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   They are folly to him, and he cannot understand them because they're spiritually discerned."
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   So if a person thinks that they can come to that moment in life and just snap their finger and say,
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   "Well, now I can stop being a person in the grip of the flesh, stop being a person enslaved to sin,"
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   they don't have that freedom to do that.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   They can't just snap their finger and become a different kind of person after years and years.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   There is a hardening that a person can reach after which God won't strive with them anymore.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   Oh, I remember my father preaching on this to young people as a kid
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   and telling the stories of young people who walked out of his services saying,
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   "Maybe later, Pastor. Maybe later we'll get serious about Jesus,"
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   and being killed by being hit by a train on the way home.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   I watched the tears flow down my father's face because it was a real story
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   that he was talking about from one of his crusades.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   But the answer that the person may be asking is,
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   "If my mom is 80, can she be saved?
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   If she's going to die two days from now and she's on a respirator,
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   can she be saved after living all her life?"
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   And the answer to that is, the thief on the cross had lived his whole life in sin,
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   and he looked to Jesus in the very last hours of his life and he said,
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   "Remember me, please."
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   And Jesus looked at him and said, "Today you will be with me in paradise."
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   Those are really sweet words for the person who has lived their whole life
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   and now really, really regrets that they have wasted it.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   And the reason it's possible for a person in the 11th hour to be saved
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   is because by grace you have been saved.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   It is not your own doing.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   It is the gift of God, not of works, not a lifetime of works,
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   not of works in the last hours, not of works so that no one may boast.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   And Jesus told a parable, didn't he, about the workers in the vineyard
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   and some worked all day and some worked just an hour at the end of the day.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   And Jesus paid them all the same, and when the people who had worked all day got angry,
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   Jesus said, "Am I not allowed to do what I choose with what belongs to me?
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   Or do you begrudge my generosity? Is your eye evil because I'm good?"
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   In other words, he's saying, "I'm free.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   I can show grace to people at the end of the day if I choose to do that,
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   so be glad that you got yours and I will give what I please to whom I please."
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   So I think the word to all of us in this is, "Behold, now is the favorable time."
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   And the now is for a 14-year-old now or an 84-year-old now.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   Now is the day of salvation.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   In Hebrews 3, "Exhort one another every day as long as it is called today
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   that none of you be hardened."
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   So the question in the end is, "Can or will God save the truly repentant in the last hour?"
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   Indeed, he will.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   And the question is, "Will we be able to repent?"
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   And I would warn everyone, you can't presume that you will be able to repent
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   if you push Jesus away now.
