[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in the Epistle to the Hebrews,
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   in the first chapter and the first three verses of the chapter.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   The first three verses in the Epistle to the Hebrews.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   God, who at sundry times and in diverse manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets,
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son,
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds,
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   who, being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person,
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   and upholding all things by the word of his power,
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   Now I want in particular this morning, of course, this Good Friday morning,
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   to call attention to the words,
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   "When he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high."
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   The author of this epistle, in these three verses,
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   is introducing what is to be the great theme of the entire epistle,
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   and that is the glory and the preeminence of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   He was writing to Hebrew Christians, people who had been brought up in the Jewish religion,
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   but who, having heard the Christian gospel, had preached it, had believed it,
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   and had become members of the Christian church.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   But for various reasons, they found themselves in a position of unhappiness.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   They were being persecuted and tried, the years were passing,
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   and the Lord had not returned as they had heard in the preaching he would do,
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   and thus they had become somewhat depressed.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   And some of them were even beginning to look back with longing eyes at their old religion.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Now it was in order to counteract that, and to help these people, that this man writes his letter.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   And the theme of the letter, I say, is the preeminence,
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   and the all-sufficiency of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   that he and he alone is the Saviour, the only way to God.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   So at once he introduces this great theme of his,
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   and he therefore gives us these wonderful statements concerning our blessed Lord and Saviour.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   Possibly there is no place in the whole of Scripture
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   where we have gathered together in such a short and small compass
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   such a wonderful description of our Lord and his glory as we have in these three verses.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   But there is one thing that must strike us immediately,
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   and that is that there is reference only to one thing
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   which our Lord did while he was here in this world.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   He describes him, you see, as the eternal Son of God in all his glory.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   He describes how he returned to the glory,
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   having descended to the earth and having done certain things,
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   how he went back and took his seat at the right hand of God again in the glory from which he had come.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   But I say what strikes us and hits us immediately is
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   that he only mentions one thing of all that happened
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   during the time that our blessed Lord was here on earth in the flesh and as a man,
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   and that is his death.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   Now then we must look at this together.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   You see, this is the theme of this man, this preeminence of Christ.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   He is greater than the prophets, he is greater than the angels,
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   he is greater than Moses, he is greater than Aaron,
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   he is greater than everybody, he is unique, and he stands alone.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   But here I say he introduces this one thing,
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   and it's the only thing that he mentions of what our Lord did while he was here on earth.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   There's not a word about his teaching,
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   there's no mention of any miracle that he wrought,
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   there's nothing here about the perfect life which he lived.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   He refers only to this one thing.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   Here is this great movement from the glory into the world, back into the glory,
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   and the only thing mentioned is when he had by himself purged our sins.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   Now there must be some very special reason for this, and of course there is.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   Why does this man single out only the death of Christ upon the cross,
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   the thing that we are met together to consider this moment?
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   Well, there seem to me to be two main answers to that question.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   One of them is just in his own immediate context.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   It is because of what he did on the cross
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   that our Lord has been exalted to sit at the right hand of the majesty on high.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   The apostle Paul puts that for us very plainly in the epistle to the Philippians in the second chapter,
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   where he puts it like this.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   He says, "Being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient unto death,
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   even the death of the cross."
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   Wherefore? Because of this.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   "God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every other name."
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   So he introduces this element here because it is the preliminary to his taking his seat
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   at the right hand of the majesty on high in the everlasting glory.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   But the second reason is still more important, and this is the one that we must consider together.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   He mentions only the death of Christ upon the cross,
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   and nothing else, because this is the key event.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   This is the vital event.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   This man keeps on making this same point.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   Let me put it like this.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   Our Lord came into this world.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   He left the everlasting glory and took unto him human nature for one great reason.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   It wasn't merely to give us certain ethical teaching.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   It wasn't merely to give us an example as to how we are to live.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   All that is involved, thank God for it.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   But that isn't why he came.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   He left the glory in order to die.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   Here it is, you see, in the very introduction.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   He then puts it again still more clearly, perhaps in the second chapter in verse 9.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   We see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   That's why he was made a little lower than the angels.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   That is why he was born as a baby in Bethlehem.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   He came in order to die.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   It was the deliberate object and purpose that he, by the grace of God, should taste death for every man.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   In other words, this is the great theme of the epistle, as it is, of course, of the whole of the New Testament.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   Our Lord's death was not an accident.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   Our Lord's death was not an afterthought.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   Our Lord's death was not something that was contrived by men primarily.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   He came in order to die.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   This is the central, crucial, unique event.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   He humbled himself.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   He came as a man and in the likeness of sinful flesh and as a servant in order that he might go to that death on the cross on Calvary's Hill.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   In other words, he did this because it was only in this way that your salvation and mine could be made possible.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   Now then, my friends, we need to consider this.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   There are teachings in the Church, alas, as well as in the world at the present time,
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   who not only do not see this but who even deny it,
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   and would have us believe that our Lord came into the world simply to announce that God loves us.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   That, they say, was the main object of the Incarnation,
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   that he came to tell us that God loves us all,
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   and the whole trouble and tragedy with mankind is that it doesn't know that God loves it,
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   but we are told God loves everybody.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   And if only men and women realized that, how much happier they would be.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   So God sent his Son into the world to tell people that God loves them,
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   and he came to make that great announcement.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   So when they come to the cross, they put it like this,
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   that what is happening on the cross is that God is telling us that though we crucify his Son, he still loves us.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   That there he shows his love to us in a picture.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   I've sent my only Son, you've crucified him, you've killed him, doesn't matter.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   I still go on loving you, as I've always done.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   And they say the same about the Son himself,
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   that he there on the cross is simply saying, though you're doing this to me,
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   still I love you, and God loves you.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   In other words, it is nothing but an announcement, a proclamation, a teaching.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   But all that, it seems to me, gives the lie direct to what we have in our text this morning.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   No, no, my friends, what was happening on the cross on Calvary's Hill was not just an announcement.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   What was happening there was that God in Christ was doing something,
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   Christ was doing something, which makes forgiveness of sins possible.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   He is not merely announcing that God does forgive sins and forgive everybody.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   No, what he is saying is, after he had by himself purged our sins,
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   there was an action taking place.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   It's not just an announcement, not just a proclamation.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   It was an event and a crucial event.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   In other words, we cannot hesitate to put it like this,
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   that if what happened on the cross on Calvary's Hill had not taken place,
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   there would be no forgiveness.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   The cross, the death upon the cross, is essential to forgiveness.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   Without it, there would be forgiveness for no one.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   Very well, that's the thing that he stated so clearly for us
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   in this word that we are looking at together this morning.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   He purged our sins, their sins were being dealt with there.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   Something was happening about our sins,
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   without which, I say, there would be no hope for anyone
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   and no possible reconciliation unto God.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   Now, that is the only adequate explanation
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   as to why this man here, in this introductory statement,
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   singles out the death upon the cross.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   The only thing mentioned in the earthly life of our Lord. Why?
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   Well, because it is the crucial event.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   It's the central event.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   It is the most essential event.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   Very well, then, let's look at it together as this man puts it before us.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   What exactly was being accomplished on the cross?
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   That's our fundamental proposition.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   That something was happening there, something was being done there,
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   there was an accomplishment. What is it?
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   Well, I've tried to divide it up for you like this.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   Let us look for a moment at the strangeness of the work
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   that was accomplished on the cross,
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   the strangeness of this work.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   And this man puts it before us in a most extraordinary manner.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   Did you notice the contrasts that are involved in his statements?
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   What happened on the cross on Calvary's Hill is the most extraordinary,
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   the most amazing, the most astounding thing that has ever happened.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   Have you seen the wonder of the cross?
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   Have you seen the marvel and the amazement of it all?
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   Come and look with me for a moment at the cross.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   There you are looking at a little hill called Calvary
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   and you see three men crucified upon crosses.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   Look at the one in the center.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   What do we see here?
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   Well, you say, I see a man there nailed to a tree.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   And you're perfectly right.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   He was a man.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   And yet, you see, this man's whole point is just to say this.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   God, who at sundry times and in divers men
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   hath spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets,
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son,
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   a man, Son of God, both in one,
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   in that strange person on the middle cross, man, God.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   But go on. What else do you see?
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   Well, you look at him and you're given the impression of extreme poverty.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   While he lived in this world, he had no place whereon to lay his head.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   He never had a home of his own.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   He never seemed to have owned anything.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   He was always lonely and possessed nothing.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   But here he is now, even losing his life,
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   even that's being taken from him, nothing left.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   Extreme poverty.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   And yet, you see, the point we are told about him is this,
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   that God has made, appointed him heir of all things.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   And here he is, the one in this extreme and abject poverty.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   As Isaac Watts puts it, "All riches are his native right,
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   yet he sustained amazing loss."
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   He has nothing, even his life goes.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   And yet he is the heir of the whole universe, the entire cosmos.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   Everything belongs to him, and yet here he is in extreme poverty.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   "Oh yes," says the apostle Paul to the Corinthians,
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   "ye know the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   how that though he was so rich, yet for our sakes he became poor."
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   It's all there in the one person.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   Extreme, abject poverty, and yet the riches of the universe,
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   the heirship of all things.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   What else?
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   Well, of course, you look at him and you're impressed by his utter weakness.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   He was arrested and didn't seem to be capable of defending himself.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   He staggers as he tries to carry that cross up this little hill of Golgotha.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   He's weak, he's helpless, he seems to have no strength.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   Who is this, so weak and helpless?
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   Child of lowly Hebrew maid, who is he?
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   Well, the answer that we are given is this.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   He is the one by whom God made the worlds.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   He is the one who is also upholding all things by the word of his power.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   Now I do ask you, my dear friends, look at this cross, look at the paradox,
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   look at the amazing contradictions, look at the things that meet together,
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   the utter weakness, the absolute helplessness.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   But he is the one through whom the whole world has been made.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   It was by him that God made the worlds, gathered together the things
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   out of which the world was to be made, and put them in their right order.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   Not only that, he is the one who upholds all things by the word of his power.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   Everything would collapse were it not that he kept them going.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   As the Apostle Paul puts it again to the Colossians,
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   it is by him that all things consist.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   He has sufficient power that he not only made the world, he keeps it going,
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   he holds everything in position.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   And yet there he is, I said, dying in apparent utter weakness and helplessness.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   Who is this that hangeth dying while the rude world scoffs and scorns,
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   numbered with the malefactors, torn with nails and crowned with thorns?
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   'Tis the God who ever liveth, 'mid the shining ones on high,
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   in the glorious golden city, reigning everlastingly.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   Who is he in Calvary's throes, asks for blessings on his foes?
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   'Tis the Lord, O wondrous story, 'tis the Lord, the King of glory,
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   at his feet we humbly fall, crown him, crown him, Lord of all.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   Weakness and yet almighty strength.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   What else? Well, there he is, I say, between two thieves,
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   condemned as a malefactor.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   Robbers, thieves, the whole atmosphere is one of sin and of shame.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   There he is between the two thieves, and yet I am told at the same time
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   that he is one who is capable of sitting down on the right hand of the Majesty on high.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   He is on the throne of the universe, he is the lawgiver, he is the righteous judge,
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   amongst malefactors, yet the Lord of righteousness and of glory.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   And then look at the final thing we are told.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   You look at those crosses and you see nothing but shame.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   'Cursed is every one,' says the Lord, 'that hangeth on a tree.'
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   There was nothing more shameful than this, to be put to death in that way and manner.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   It was the final curse, the final shame, and there are the people mocking and cursing and jeering.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   What utter shame!
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   Who is this who is in this shameful position,
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   with the thieves amongst the malefactors, and despised and rejected of men?
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   The answer is that he is the brightness of the glory of God
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   and the express image of the person of God.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   He is to the Father, if you like, what the rays of the sun are to the sun.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   He is the full expression of the everlasting God.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   The glory of God is in him and shining through him, the everlasting glory.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   That's who he is, the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   But here he is in utter shame,
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   the most shameful thing that could ever happen to a human being.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   And yet all these things meet in the same person.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   And then finally, of course, he dies.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   But who is this that is dying in this weakness and amidst this shame?
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   Well, I say again, he is one who will soon be seated at the right hand of the Majesty on high,
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   waiting until all his enemies shall be made his footscroll.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   Who is he who dies? He is the one who says, 'I am the resurrection and the life.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   He that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live.'
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   And whosoever believeth in me shall never die.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   Here then is this extraordinary strangeness of this which happened upon the cross.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   It's all a part of the message, my friends.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   You've got to realize who this blessed person is.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   This is not just a man.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   This is no mere human religious teacher or political agitator.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   This is the brightness of God's glory and the express image of his person.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   This is the one through whom all things were made that are made,
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   and without whom nothing was made that is made.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   Here he is, I say, the one who upholds the whole cosmos in the might of his power and strength.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   There he is, dying in shame and weakness, in sorrow.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   It is the strangest, the most remarkably event that has ever taken place or ever will take place.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   Look at that cross.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   Behold the strangeness of what is happening there.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   But let's go on.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   What is the nature of this strange work that happened on the cross?
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   What is this?
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   Why should the Son of God be dying on a cross?
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   Why should this glorious person be in such a condition of shame?
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   Why should the all-powerful, almighty One be dying in weakness?
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   What is this? Here's the question.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   Here's the whole secret. Here's the meaning of it all.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   What's it mean? Well, the answer is given.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   When he had by himself purged our sins.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   It's the only answer. This man goes on giving it right through this great epistle.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   Let me give you alternative translations.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   Having made a cleansing for sins, or if you prefer it, to make purification for sins.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   What does this mean?
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   Well, what he says is this, that there on the cross he removed sins by purification.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   He purified them away.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   He made expiation.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   What is this?
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   Well, to answer that question, of course, you must go to the Old Testament.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   Here's the fulfillment of all the Old Testament types.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   And in the Old Testament, this is what you find.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   If anything became defiled in the temple or anywhere else,
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   because some sinful person had touched it.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   If something became defiled in that way, what they did was this.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   They sprinkled blood upon it.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   And as the result of the sprinkling of the blood of some animal that had been killed upon it,
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   was that it was delivered from the defilement of the sin.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   The sin was purged or purified away.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   It was a stain, as it were, that is removed by the power of blood.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   You can think of the obvious analogy.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   Stains fall on a cloth or on some metal, and you have to apply some chemical to remove the stain.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   You purify the thing from the blot and the stain by the application of this chemical.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   That's the picture that we have before us in this extraordinary work.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   He purged, he purified sins.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   He got rid of them by what was happening there upon the cross.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   What is the meaning of this, I ask again.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   And here the whole Bible answers the question.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   You have teaching concerning it in the Old Testament,
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   about the burnt offerings and the sacrifices and the paschal lamb,
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   and in the teaching of the prophets, and it's the great theme of the New Testament.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   Let me put it simply and quietly in these terms.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   Sin makes us guilty before God, and sin also defiles us, stains us,
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   leads to blots upon us and upon the soul.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   And what every man born into this world needs is to be delivered from these two things,
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   the guilt of sin, the stain, and the pollution of sin.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   There's the great problem.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   And what this man says is that there upon the cross,
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   our Lord was dealing with the two aspects of our problem.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   He removes sin.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   He takes away the guilt, he takes away the stain.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   How does he do it? With his own blood.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   There was nothing that had ever been discovered that was powerful enough
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   to remove the guilt and the stain and the pollution of sin.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   All the offerings and the sacrifices of all the animals of the Old Testament couldn't do it.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   He came because he alone could do it, and in that one act, he's purging sins.
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   He's taking them away. He's removing them.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   How does he do it?
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   Well, I like the phrase that is here in this authorized translation,
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   but which we've got to admit and agree is not in the best manuscripts.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   We read here that when he had by himself purged our sins.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   The expression "by himself" is not found, I say, in the most ancient manuscripts,
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   but the authorities are all agreed that the word that is used
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   carries and conveys that very impression in itself.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   You see, it means this.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   He didn't use his power to get rid of our sins.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   He didn't devise some marvelous method to get rid of it and do it through somebody else.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   He didn't do it by teaching. He didn't do it by example.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   He didn't do it indirectly by some word or by using some other person.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   He didn't do it by using his almighty power. Well, how did he do it?
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   The answer is that he did it himself.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   He did it by himself, which means this, of course,
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   that when he came into this world, he was made of a woman.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   He was made under the law.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   He put himself into our position.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   He took our nature upon him, not only that.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   He identified himself with our sins.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   That's why he asked John the Baptist to baptize him.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   He had no need of baptism, but he said, "This is right. With us we fulfill all righteousness."
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   He puts himself alongside us. He stands with sinners.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   He does it himself. He doesn't send an agent. He doesn't send an angel.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   He doesn't raise some great men. He can't do it by a teaching.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   He himself has to come, so he leaves the courts of heaven.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   He's born as a baby in helplessness. He lives an ordinary life, and he's baptized.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   He puts himself into the position of a sinner.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   More than that, he renders a perfect obedience to the holy law of God
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   and never broke it in one jot or tittle, but above all on the cross.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   This is what he's doing.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   He takes your sins and mine upon himself.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   As the apostle Peter puts it, "For his own self bear our sins in his own body on the tree."
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   Not by an agent, not by a substitute, by himself.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   He takes them upon himself. God lays them upon him in his own body, with his own shed blood.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   He purges our sins himself. Our sins were laid upon him.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   And he received the punishment that was due to you and to me.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   That is why he groaned in spirit at the grave of Lazarus.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   That is why he was sweating drops of blood in Gethsemane.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   That is why he cries on the cross, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   He was experiencing the wrath of God. His Father's wrath upon you, our sins, and mine was upon him.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   The chastisement of our peace was upon him.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   By his stripes we are healed. He there is purging sins.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   His blood is shed, let loose, and it washes the sins away.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   And thus he purifies us from sin.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   Thus he answers the law of God and reconciles us to God.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   Thus, I say, he takes away the defilement.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   And the result is, as this man goes on to say in the tenth chapter, in the nineteenth verse,
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   "Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest of all by the blood of Jesus."
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   He has made a new and a living way that we, defiled and clean,
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   can stand clean, spotless, pure, before God in the holiest of all.
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   That is what he was doing.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   And he did it himself.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   He is not merely announcing, I say, that God is love and that he'll forgive us.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   No, no, he's making it possible for God's love to forgive.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   He's satisfying the righteousness of God.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   He's making a way of salvation.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   That is the nature of the strange work that takes place on the cross on Calvary's hill.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   But let me go on to emphasize the completeness of the work that he did.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   And this in itself again is a wonderful theme.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   When he had by himself purged our sins,
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   the author of this epistle deliberately there used what is called the Aorist tense,
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   "having purged."
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   And the Aorist tense is a tense which conveys the notion of something that was done once and forever.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   A completed action, an action that never needs to be repeated again and never will be.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   Once and forever.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   Having purged, he's done it, he's finished it.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   There is nothing more that ever needs to be done. It never needs to be supplemented.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   But not only are we told that by the use of the Aorist tense, we've got this further extraordinary expression.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   When he had by himself purged our sins, he sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   This is a wonderful thing.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   Go back to your Old Testament and read the accounts of the high priests entering into the holiest of all once a year
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   with the blood of the sacrifice to make atonement for the people.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   The sacrifice was accepted.
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   But you never read that the high priest sat down. Never.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   He entered in with the blood and he sprinkled it and then he walked out again.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   He never sat down. Why?
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   Well, the answer is given repeatedly in this very great epistle.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   The answer was that the work of the high priest was never finished.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   It was never completed. Listen to this.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   All that he says in chapter 9, verse 9, was a figure for the time then present
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices that could not make him that did the service perfect
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   as pertaining to the conscience.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   For if the blood of bulls and of goats and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   sanctifies to the purifying of the flesh, that's all it could do.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   It could give one a kind of purification of the flesh and in an external manner,
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   but it couldn't purify nor purge the conscience.
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   And again in verse 10, it is not possible, chapter 10, verse 4,
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sin.
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   They simply covered it over. It was a temporary expedient.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   So the high priest went in and he remained standing and he walked out.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   But this man, having once purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   Why? Well, the answer is this.
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal spirit
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   to serve the living God?
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   He's finished the work. He cried upon the cross, "It is finished.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   Every demand of the Lord has been satisfied positively and negatively.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   Nothing more needs to be done. He has obtained eternal redemption for us."
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   The work he did, he did once and for all and forever.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   He never dies again. You don't add to it, you don't supplement it, you don't repeat it.
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   He died once and forever, having purged.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   It's been done. 'Tis done. The great transaction's done.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   There is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   He that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all,
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   Who shall separate us from the love of God?
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   Impossible. I am persuaded that neither death nor life, nor angels,
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature shall be able to separate us
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   Who is he that condemneth? It is God that justifies. It's finished.
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   All who are in Christ and who believe in him and who have been purged by his act
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   upon the cross from their sins are eternally safe.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   Nothing shall separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   Very well, my friends, let me draw just some two or three conclusions as I close.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   And they are inevitable conclusions from this teaching.
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   The first is the depth of the terrible problem of sin.
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   Sin is such that this had to take place before it could be forgiven.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   Sin is not a slight or a superficial problem. Sin is rebellion against God.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   The wages of sin is death. Sin is horrible in the sight of God.
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   Here it is exposed by this act on Calvary's hill.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   But secondly, isn't it obvious also that this is the only way whereby we ever can be forgiven
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   or salvation is ever possible?
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   Do you ask me to believe that the Son of God with all his power and glory
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   would ever have come to this position, to the weakness, the shame, the ignominy,
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   the suffering, the condemnation, the death, and all the agony and all it involved
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   in his holy body and in his spirit? Would that ever have happened?
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   Unless it is the only way whereby men can be forgiven,
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   is it conceivable that the Almighty Father would have averted his gaze
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   from his only begotten dearly beloved Son
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   and have allowed him to pass through this agony and shame if there were any other way?
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   Indeed, our Lord himself asked the question in the agony in the Garden of Gethsemane.
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   "Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass by.
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   Nevertheless, not my will but thine be done."
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   And that means this. He turned to the Father and said, "Is this the only way?"
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   He wasn't merely shrinking from physical death.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   He was shrinking from the bearing of the wrath and the punishment of God
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   turning his face away. He said, "Is there no other way?"
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   The answer is, "There wasn't."
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   And there wasn't because God is just and righteous and holy as well as love.
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   God is light and in him is no darkness at all.
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   And he must punish them. He said so, and he does.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   And the only way whereby you and I can be forgiven is that our sentence be punished
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   for what we have been dealt with, and they have been.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   That is what happened on the cross.
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   He purged our sins by receiving and bearing our punishment.
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   It was the only way.
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   There was none other that was strong enough to bear this.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   God had made Adam perfect, but he wasn't strong enough. He fell.
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   No use making another perfect man. He'd fall again.
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   For you and I might be saved. It needs an incarnation.
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   The Son of God must come and take unto him human nature, and he did.
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   The brightness of his glory in the express image of his person,
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   the one through whom all was made, the one who sustains everything, he came.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   He is a helpless babe. He died in helplessness on the cross. Why?
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   He's a he alone. He's strong enough to bear the guilt and the punishment
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   and rise triumphant o'er it all.
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   There was none other good enough to pay the price of sin.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   He only could unlock the gates of heaven and let us in.
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   Very well, my final word to you is this.
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   This man introduces this great statement with these words.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   "God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake, spoke,
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   in times past to the fathers by the prophets, hath in these last days
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   spoken unto us in his Son, spoken."
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   Have you heard him? Has he spoken to you?
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   Have you heard the message of the cross?
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   Have you heard the word of God streaming from Calvary?
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   What is it? It's this. Repent!
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   God is telling you there that he's a holy and a righteous and a just God.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   He's telling you that he's the judge of the whole earth,
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   that it is appointed unto all men once to die and after death the judgment.
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   That's what he's saying. That's a judgment. That's a judgment upon sin.
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   Yes, and he's saying, you are to be judged.
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:27.000]   Everybody's to be judged. Man is a responsible being.
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   And God will demand things of us. We will all stand before God
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   and give an account of our lives lived in this world.
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   We'll be asked what we've done with the soul. Judgment!
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   And what he's telling us is this, that we all by nature
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   and as the result of the lives we've lived are all damned and lost.
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   There is none righteous, no, not one.
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   All have sinned and come short of the glory of God.
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   All your patriarchs, all your prophets, even Adam, all sinned, all failed.
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   All men failed. How then can we stand before God?
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   Here's the answer.
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   God hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   God so loved the world that whosoever that he gave his only begotten Son,
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   that whosoever believeth in him shall not perish, but have everlasting life.
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   You notice what it says?
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   If you don't believe in him, if you don't believe that on Calvary's cross
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   he was purging your sins away, purifying you from them by shedding his own blood,
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   if you don't, you perish.
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   And perish inevitably.
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   But whosoever believeth in him shall not perish,
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   but have everlasting life.
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   My friend, the message is that the Lord of glory,
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   the express image of God's person, the creator of the universe,
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   bar your sins in his own body on the tree,
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   that you being dead unto sin should live unto righteousness.
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   He's speaking, God is speaking, God's addressing you,
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   and that's what he's saying, repent and believe on the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   And thou shalt be saved.
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   Have you seen it?
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   Have you heard the message?
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   Have you heard God speaking unto you?
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   What is he saying? He's saying this through me.
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   I am an ambassador for Christ.
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   As though Christ did beseech you by us, we say,
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   be ye reconciled unto God.
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   The way is open.
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   You have nothing to do but to believe that the Son of God purged away your sins
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   on the cross on Calvary's hill, and rose again for your justification,
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   and is at this moment seated at the right hand of God in the glory everlasting,
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   ever living to make intercession for you,
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   and preparing a place for you, and will come again and receive you unto himself,
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:34.000]   that where he is, you will be also.
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   God spake, God is still speaking.
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   Have you heard him?
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   Let us join in singing our closing hymn, which is hymn number 176.
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   We are singing the second part of the hymn only.
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:59.000]   Hymn number 176, part two, beginning at verse seven.
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   Join all the glorious names of wisdom, love and power.
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   Hymn number 176.
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   [music]
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:41.000]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
