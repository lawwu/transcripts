[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.160]   A podcast listener named Ty writes in to ask this, "Pastor John, what does it mean for
[00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:15.320]   the Spirit to bear witness that we are children of God?" in Romans 8 16.
[00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:22.880]   This is enormously important because what I have found over the years is that right
[00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:35.080]   up there with fear and lust and anger, Christians everywhere at some time, all of us, deal with
[00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.080]   the problem of assurance, the assurance of salvation.
[00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.000]   Am I really a Christian?
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.760]   Every Christian deals with this at some point, and some Christians all the time.
[00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.440]   And so I really would like to help here if I can.
[00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.600]   So this person is thinking about Romans 8 14 to 16.
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.280]   So let me read the verses because the verses themselves provide the clue to what is being
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.400]   meant here.
[00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.080]   This is verse 14 Romans 8.
[00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.280]   "All who are led by the Spirit of God are the sons of God."
[00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.840]   So led by the Spirit of God are the sons of God.
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.920]   A clue that you're the son of God is that you're being led by the Spirit.
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.840]   Verse 15, "For you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:33.120]   have received the spirit of adoption as sons by whom we cry, 'Abba, Father.'"
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:40.600]   A very intimate, warm, personal, affectionate cry to God as our Father.
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.600]   The Spirit is witnessing.
[00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.880]   Verse 16, "The Spirit himself bears witness, is witnessing in that cry, 'Abba, Father,'
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.760]   with our spirit that we are the children of God."
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.960]   So here's the first thing I would say.
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:03.280]   The witness of the Holy Spirit that you are a child of God is not a word whispered in
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.280]   your ear.
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.080]   "You're my child."
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.120]   That's not the way he does it.
[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:12.600]   That's external, and the devil could do that to an unbeliever.
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.360]   And I don't doubt that the devil does whisper that in people's ears, because it says at
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.760]   the end of the day, there are going to be people who think they've called Jesus Lord,
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.700]   and they really haven't.
[00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.560]   What it means is two things, and these are in the text.
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.660]   It is the work of the Spirit.
[00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:37.880]   So the witness of the Spirit is the work of the Spirit giving evidences in our lives that
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.480]   we are the sons of God.
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:45.680]   Now get that from verse 14, "All who are led by the Spirit are the sons of God."
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:56.480]   So the work of the Spirit leading us is the Spirit witnessing in our lives that we are
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.040]   God's.
[00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.440]   His work provides evidences, and that's what witnesses do.
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.380]   They give evidences of reality.
[00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.080]   So we look for what it means to be led by the Spirit.
[00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:18.720]   And if you go to Galatians 5, being led by the Spirit, walking by the Spirit, living
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.580]   by the Spirit is the same as bearing the fruit of the Spirit.
[00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.200]   So we look for love, joy, peace, patience, goodness, kindness.
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:35.240]   In other words, as we look at our lives, are there evidences that the Spirit is producing
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:42.560]   things that are contrary to a fallen, unbelieving, selfish human nature?
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:50.520]   And I want to be real clear here, never does the Bible say that the evidence is perfection.
[00:03:50.520 --> 00:04:00.040]   It's always a direction of life where we say, "This, this, and this was contrary to my selfish
[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.520]   spirit, and God worked that in me.
[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:08.960]   I thank you, God, for giving me some measure of evidence that I belong to God."
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:09.960]   That's number one.
[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:16.000]   So verse 14 points to the fact that the witness of the Spirit is His giving evidences in our
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.760]   life that we're His.
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.760]   And here's the second one.
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:31.200]   It means a heartfelt cry rises up in us to God as our Father and Christ as our Lord.
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:40.040]   So verse 15 and 16, "You have received the Spirit of adoption as sons by whom you cry,
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.340]   'Abba, Father!'
[00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.880]   The Spirit Himself bearing witness with your spirit."
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:54.760]   So when there rises in the believer's heart a humble, authentic, dependent, thankful,
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:05:01.840]   happy Father, Father, that's the Holy Spirit.
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:11.600]   Because a person who is without Christ cannot call out to God in a dependent, loving, thankful,
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:12.600]   humble way.
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:13.600]   They're too selfish.
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.120]   They're too self-reliant.
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.480]   They don't treat God that way.
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:24.880]   And the reason I said it's also a heart cry to Jesus as Lord is because He says almost
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.760]   the same thing in 1 Corinthians 12.
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:28.760]   3.
[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:35.000]   "Therefore, I want you to understand, no one speaking in the Spirit of God ever says,
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.800]   'Jesus is cursed.'
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:43.360]   And no one can say, 'Jesus is Lord,' except in the Holy Spirit."
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:50.640]   So if your heart rises up not only to say, "Father, Father, I need you," but also rises
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:56.760]   up to say, "Jesus, my Master, my Lord, my God, my everything."
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:01.840]   If your heart rises up to say that, that's the Holy Spirit in you.
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:05.320]   That's the evidence of God in your life.
[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.600]   That's part of His assuring work.
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.520]   So here's one last counsel.
[00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:19.320]   The source of assurance, finally, is not found by focusing on our hearts and ourselves.
[00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:25.480]   It's found by focusing on that Lord and that Father.
[00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:33.600]   Because Jesus said, "When the Spirit of truth comes," this is John 16, 13, and 14, "When
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:38.840]   the Spirit of truth comes, He will glorify me."
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:44.840]   Which means, if you want the Holy Spirit to be at work in you, awakening that authentic
[00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:51.440]   cry to Jesus, "My Lord and to God, my Father," you look to them.
[00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:55.640]   You look to them, because that's whom the Holy Spirit glorifies.
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:07:01.200]   If you look within and take your life, I mean your eyes, off of Jesus, what's the Holy Spirit
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:02.200]   going to glorify?
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:07.920]   There's nothing for Him to magnify if you're not looking at Jesus and the Father.
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:14.800]   So bottom line, the Holy Spirit's witness is, one, His work in us to create evidences
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:18.000]   that we're His child by producing the fruits of the Spirit.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:25.640]   And number two, it's His awakening in us of a heartfelt cry, "Daddy, Father, I need you.
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:30.320]   And Jesus, you're my Lord, you're my guide, you're my treasure."
[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:35.480]   When our hearts are crying out with authentic dependence like that, and our lives are giving
[00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:41.160]   some evidence of His presence, then that's the work of the Holy Spirit witnessing.
[00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:44.800]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for listening to this podcast.

[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:22.400]   How do we who are strangers, exiles, aliens, and pilgrims on the earth think about patriotism?
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:25.120]   Pilgrims and patriots, that's the topic tomorrow morning.
