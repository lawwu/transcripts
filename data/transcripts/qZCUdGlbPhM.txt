[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.840]   I'm Cal Newport, and this is In Depth, a semi-regular series where I interview interesting people
[00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:13.040]   about the quest to cultivate a deep life.
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.400]   Today's episode is presented by Defender, a vehicle designed for those of us seeking
[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.920]   adventure in a distracted world.
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.120]   I'm excited about today's show because I'll be talking with Kendra Adachi.
[00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.640]   I've known Kendra for a while, and she's a leader in a movement that she calls Compassionate
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.280]   Time Management.
[00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:39.180]   You might know her from her Lazy Genius podcast or from her book, The Lazy Genius, but she
[00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.320]   has a new title out, that's what we're gonna be talking about today, a new book that is
[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.280]   called The Plan, Manage Your Time Like a Lazy Genius.
[00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:55.360]   So Kendra and I are exploring similar spaces that I explored in my prior episode with Oliver
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.780]   Berkman, but we come at it from different angles that I think are fascinating and useful
[00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.960]   for our quest on this show to understand depth, how to build a life that matters without getting
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.600]   obsessed about the process of the building.
[00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.440]   I think Kendra's fantastic on it.
[00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.720]   Here's some of the issues we get into in today's episode.
[00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.040]   Why being a genius in one thing means you might have to be lazy in many other things,
[00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.400]   and that that's okay.
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.400]   We talk about why the unceasing pursuit of greatness, which is the focus of a lot of
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.200]   time management productivity advice, this idea that everything you're doing now is about
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.280]   achieving some greatness in the future, we get into why that can be self-defeating and
[00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:42.320]   exhausting, and how the alternative, which Kendra calls integration, which involves living
[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.720]   wholly with your current situation, can in the end be so much more fulfilling.
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:54.000]   We get into my own recovery from greatness pursuit addiction.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.800]   We get some free therapy here from Kendra about my own middle-age evolution of what
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.440]   I think is important in my life.
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.480]   And I think this is critical.
[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:07.160]   We get into why time management and productivity writing tends to neglect the reality of women,
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.840]   and how Kendra is trying to remedy that with this book and her podcast and writings in
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:12.840]   general.
[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.840]   Now, I gave a cover blurb for the plan.
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.200]   In fact, I think I'm the only male blurber of this book, something that I'm very proud
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.200]   about.
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.520]   Here's what I wrote on the cover of Kendra's book.
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.520]   Strikingly original and compassionate, Kendra offers a vision of time management that embraces
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:37.120]   the unique messiness of your life instead of trying to optimize it away.
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:44.560]   I very much agree with that sentiment, and I think you might too after you hear our conversation.
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.320]   But first, I want to say a word about today's presenting sponsor, Defender.
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.660]   Let's start with the idea of a presenting sponsor altogether.
[00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.000]   This is new, but it was what I have said from the beginning of this series.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.920]   My goal is to try to find for each episode a single presenting sponsor, a high-quality
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:10.380]   brand I actually like, that would then allow us to present the interview without interruption.
[00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.640]   So that once we get to the interview, we can really get lost in the conversation without
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:15.640]   ad breaks.
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.100]   Well, I couldn't be more excited that our very first such presenting sponsor we have
[00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.740]   found for this series is Defender.
[00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:30.340]   The iconic Defender line of vehicles has been reimagined for a new generation of explorers.
[00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:37.280]   The Defender 90, 110, and 130, which can seat up to eight passengers, all maintained a legendary
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.980]   off-road capability for which Defender is known, but now combined with legendary new
[00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.100]   on-road capabilities as well.
[00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:51.800]   This includes, for example, 21st century technology, such as 3D surround cameras, the ability to
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:57.140]   see underneath your car, as well as to see through your rear window, even if it is obstructed,
[00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:02.260]   a next-generation PVPro infotainment system and intuitive driver displays.
[00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:08.000]   What I really like about Defender, however, is that psychologically speaking, it keeps
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.060]   you connected to a sense of adventure.
[00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:17.160]   So even as you're enjoying all those technologies on your smooth driving commute to work, you
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:25.580]   will be reminded, because you're in this iconic vehicle brand, that adventure awaits and that
[00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:31.220]   there's more to life than just the pragmatic through the motions chores that you might
[00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:32.720]   be looking at today.
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.100]   It's a mindset that I think at our current age of email and Zoom meetings is important
[00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:41.120]   to keep in mind, that sometimes you want to just get out there and get after it, whether
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.040]   that be physically or metaphorically.
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.980]   So I'm glad that Defender is our sponsor.
[00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:55.380]   You can visit LandRoverUSA.com to learn more about Defender.
[00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:01.060]   And with that, let us now get to our interview with Kendra Adachi, presented without any
[00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.060]   interruption.
[00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:03.060]   All right.
[00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.880]   Well, Kendra, it's great to see you again.
[00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.900]   Thanks for coming on the podcast.
[00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.760]   I've been looking forward to this one.
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.480]   You've done something very interesting with this book that I'm looking forward to getting
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:13.480]   into.
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.980]   So we'll start with it.
[00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:16.140]   Let's start with the book.
[00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:20.060]   It's called The Plan, Plan Capitalized, because it's an acronym.
[00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.020]   We'll get to that in a second.
[00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:28.620]   Manage Your Time Like a Lazy Genius, a certified New York Times bestseller, I should say.
[00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.220]   For a lot of people who know you, the phrase "lazy genius" is like a course.
[00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:33.820]   This is like what you're associated with.
[00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:39.980]   But for the part of my audience that's new to the world of Kendra, maybe bring us up
[00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:45.420]   to speed on this term "lazy genius" was not chosen at the last minute as you're writing
[00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:46.620]   this particular subtitle.
[00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:49.580]   This is a long existing concept in your universe.
[00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:50.780]   So what do we mean by that?
[00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:51.780]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:57.380]   So a lazy genius is someone who is a genius about the things that matter, and lazy about
[00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:59.020]   the things that don't.
[00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:03.500]   And the key here is that you get to decide what matters to you and whatever season of
[00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.300]   life that you're in.
[00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:11.980]   Most of the rhetoric I heard for so long, years ago, over a decade ago, was either you're
[00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:18.900]   just amazing at everything, like she can do it all, or you are like messy hair don't care.
[00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:23.140]   Like there was these two extremes of either you're amazing at everything or you just care
[00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:27.540]   about nothing and you've given up, and even that giving up is like a badge of honor.
[00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:33.420]   Now that's definitely something that is in, I would say, the female space a lot more,
[00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:39.220]   but it's a really tough spectrum to kind of swing between those two ends.
[00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:45.080]   And I think most people, not just women, most people live in a very wide middle where there
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.340]   are things that they want to be excellent at.
[00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:51.360]   You want to give your genius energy and your time to these things that matter to you.
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:54.380]   But if you do that, you do have to be lazy about other things.
[00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:57.860]   You do have to sort of let things slide or be happy with C-level work or delegate them
[00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:59.220]   a lot or whatever.
[00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:06.300]   So what I try to teach people is not just, it's not necessarily about like hacks and
[00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:07.780]   specific tips.
[00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:14.260]   It's more this almost lifestyle of paying attention to where you are in the season of
[00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:19.260]   life you're in and naming what matters there so that you can actually make wise decisions
[00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:20.260]   about your time.
[00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:24.460]   I mean, I learned that phrase for the first time, "Lazy hair don't care."
[00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:28.740]   In your interview with Sharon McManus, who also has a cool new book out, and I was like,
[00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:29.740]   that is a cool phrase.
[00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:36.100]   Well, and there's also an interesting sort of niche in the market out there of, I guess,
[00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:41.140]   people who are in that camp but aren't really because they're spending a lot of very focused
[00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:46.140]   time trying to market that message and writing books about that message or whatever.
[00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:48.340]   The performative laziness is an interesting thing.
[00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:49.340]   It is.
[00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:50.340]   It really is.
[00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:56.220]   And that's why I found such resonance with this message because a lot of people, we sort
[00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:59.840]   of already know intuitively that trying to do it all doesn't really work.
[00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:04.180]   Sometimes we keep going, but there are actually more resources out there for people who are
[00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:05.720]   trying to do more.
[00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:13.300]   So it's easier to find a path sort of to feel like you're making some headway in this direction,
[00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:18.720]   even though I'm not sure a lot of us do, at least with not some expense that we pay on
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:21.520]   the back end with our health and our time and our family and whatever.
[00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:30.120]   But this other side, yeah, the performative laziness, it's just as unfulfilling and is
[00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:35.400]   just as unsustainable as trying to do it all because it's not authentic to most people.
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:41.420]   We actually do want to care about things like life is fulfilling because we feel a purpose
[00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:42.420]   in certain directions.
[00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:45.120]   You just can't feel a purpose in every single one.
[00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:47.360]   This is an odd connection to make, but stick with me here.
[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:50.440]   I want to connect that to college admissions.
[00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:51.760]   Let's do it.
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:52.760]   Okay.
[00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:57.720]   When I was younger and I was writing books for students, I got very into giving talks
[00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:02.520]   and even wrote a book about this, about college admissions and the stress surrounding it.
[00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:06.800]   And this was this very interesting dynamic that arose in the early 2000s when there was
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:11.880]   a huge stress as the echo boom sort of squeezed into a smaller number of spots and colleges
[00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:13.220]   got more competitive.
[00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:20.160]   What I found was there was a whole industry whose response to the stress of college admissions
[00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:25.720]   was just to preach the message, there's more to life than Harvard, right?
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:26.720]   Just chill out.
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:29.240]   Like you shouldn't be so stressed about college.
[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:30.240]   Life is long.
[00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:31.640]   It doesn't matter that much.
[00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:35.680]   And most of these people were Ivy League educated and there was a sort of like pull the ladder
[00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:36.880]   up behind you.
[00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:41.400]   And so this wasn't resonating with the people who are suffering the most stress because
[00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:44.840]   they were the most locked in on like, it really matters where I go to college.
[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:46.480]   So they were just completely tuning out that message.
[00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:51.160]   So then I came in, I was giving these talks around the country where my whole approach
[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:57.040]   was validating, okay, this is a valid, you know, ambition.
[00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:00.800]   You care about the college you go into, but the stress of the way that people are doing
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.320]   this is not worth it.
[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:06.600]   So maybe we can find a way, this is like lazy genius ahead of time, maybe we can find a
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:10.920]   way to keep interesting options open for colleges, but you're not going to burn yourself out
[00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:11.920]   at the age of 17.
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:16.600]   And it was a really hard path to go because there was the crew of like, no, no, no, just
[00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:19.560]   there's more to life than college and parents are bad because their kids want to get into
[00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:20.560]   it.
[00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:24.240]   And then on the other end it was, you know, pipe till your, study till your eyes bleed.
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:25.240]   That's right.
[00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:26.240]   That's all that matters.
[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:27.240]   Yeah.
[00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:28.240]   Yeah.
[00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:29.760]   And that in between resonated because people say, yeah, I have this ambition, but also
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:33.640]   I don't want to sleep three hours a day when I'm, when I'm 16.
[00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:36.440]   So there's that, I love that sweet spot.
[00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:41.080]   So, so, okay, here's the terminology from your book that I thought was profound.
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:48.160]   Talk about integration versus greatness as this spoke to me in a lot of ways.
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:49.560]   I love hearing that.
[00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:59.040]   So I have read so many time management productivity books over the years, like I, for the purpose
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:03.040]   of trying to do it all, like that was my original reason.
[00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:08.720]   And as I was researching this book and trying to think about what this was going to be,
[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:13.520]   I just had this like light bulb moment where I realized, wait a minute, almost every single
[00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:18.400]   book I've ever read and every episode, podcast episode that I listened to, like everything
[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:23.200]   in the space in general is trying to make me better.
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:24.960]   It's trying to make me amazing.
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:27.880]   It's trying to level up and 10X.
[00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:30.520]   Everything is just this upward movement.
[00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:33.560]   And I went, I don't want that though.
[00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:37.440]   Like that's not what I want the goal of my day to day life to be.
[00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:43.160]   It's not greatness because if that is the goal, I will always be behind.
[00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:48.040]   I will always feel like a day is a failure because what does great even mean?
[00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:49.920]   Like what's the, what's the measurement for that?
[00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:53.100]   There's no universal gauge for what that's going to be like.
[00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:58.840]   And when you talk about a female experience in particular where you're kind of holding
[00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:04.120]   like you're holding the domestic tasks of the home, it's like the invisible scaffolding
[00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:12.840]   of your household management, all those things, it's just, it feels so debilitating to feel
[00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:15.320]   like you have to be great all the time.
[00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:21.040]   And but our, even our country in many ways is built on that.
[00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:26.360]   It's built on potential and chasing your dreams and you hustle your way to the top and anybody
[00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:27.560]   can get what they want.
[00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:30.440]   And I think that in many ways that's really beautiful.
[00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:36.100]   Like that's a hopeful, beautiful thing that we can have as part of our DNA.
[00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:45.200]   But this expectation that everyone wants to be great and has the capacity and interest
[00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:49.360]   to be great in every element of their lives is just like false.
[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:52.600]   I just think we've been, we've been sold a lie.
[00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:53.600]   Right.
[00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:56.360]   So instead, what if we have a different goal?
[00:12:56.360 --> 00:13:01.040]   What if instead of greatness being our goal at every turn, what if it's integration?
[00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:06.880]   What if it is being a grounded whole person right where we are, where we do not, it's
[00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:13.040]   like you just said about those college kids, where we are not sacrificing our humanity
[00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:17.560]   on the altar of productivity, on the altar of optimization, on getting more done in less
[00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:18.560]   time.
[00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:20.840]   What if integration is where we began?
[00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:24.320]   So what that, what that, it honestly changes everything.
[00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:31.320]   If that is your lens, if you're looking through a lens of integration, you stop asking questions
[00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:35.720]   like, well, how can I make the most of this day off that I have?
[00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:41.080]   How can I make the most of the, everything no longer becomes about making the most of.
[00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:46.400]   How can I be here right now and honor who I am and who's in front of me and my season
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:47.600]   of life?
[00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:53.440]   It's just a very like, um, it's a very present perspective.
[00:13:53.440 --> 00:14:00.040]   And I will say it's a bit of a hard sell though, because it's not, it's not very like you can't
[00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:01.360]   make a list out of it.
[00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:03.280]   It's not a very sexy sell.
[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:08.880]   And yet it's the most sustainable fulfilling sale I think that there is for most people.
[00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:11.840]   What's the role, because I can't help like connecting to this.
[00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:16.000]   I'm thinking about the role of technology in this, right?
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.200]   Because I went back, it was like a hobby horse of mine.
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:25.040]   I'm very interested in like the state of book publishing on these topics versus other discussions
[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:26.040]   on these topics.
[00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:30.080]   And I actually think book publishing has gotten to like a, an interesting place.
[00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:31.080]   I have it here somewhere.
[00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:38.080]   I went through and actually got the top 10, top 10 bestsellers on Amazon right now in
[00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:40.240]   time management.
[00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:45.640]   And I went through them and like, right now in this moment, um, very few of the books
[00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:50.880]   that are big right now are about chart 10 X scene or doing more.
[00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:53.720]   There's almost like we're in like a back flat, a backlash.
[00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:54.720]   Some of these I don't know as well.
[00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:56.000]   Number one right now is buy back your time.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.760]   I think that's like one of these entrepreneur books where it's basically saying, um, you
[00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:02.760]   outsource stuff.
[00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:06.680]   If you're an entrepreneur, like you see that as a business investment like any other, uh,
[00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:07.680]   that book seems really popular.
[00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:10.800]   Slow productivity is up there, which is, you know, the opposite of that four hour work
[00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:14.920]   week was like the original, uh, complete dismissal.
[00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:15.920]   I mean, it's interesting.
[00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:19.460]   Ferris is seen as the optimization man, but that book was like the original work is so
[00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:23.120]   unimportant that you should just figure out a way to take advantage of the internet to
[00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:26.200]   automate something that makes you just enough money that you can learn tango.
[00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:29.320]   It's like nihilistic, almost like anarchist book.
[00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:32.400]   The organized mind is up there right now, which is just, that's actually a neuroscience
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:33.400]   book.
[00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:36.600]   It's a 12 week year, which is about like, Hey, business is not as valuable as we think.
[00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:37.600]   Right.
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:42.160]   12 week year is, is I think a traditional corporate get more done, right?
[00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:44.720]   Because it's like compress your timeframe, so you'll be more urgent.
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:45.720]   Yeah.
[00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:46.720]   Yeah.
[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:49.720]   It's kind of like if you rename what a year is, you have more years available to you.
[00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:52.200]   So you can hustle harder because you have the pressure.
[00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:53.200]   Yeah.
[00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:57.320]   Um, and then we have essentialism, your book, art of laziness, getting things done.
[00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:01.280]   So it's like the, and getting things done also, I have this long argument about is that's
[00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:02.880]   like a cry to cure.
[00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:03.880]   This is like David Allen.
[00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:07.480]   Like, how do you like maintain your sanity when we have so much damn stuff we have to
[00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:08.480]   do all day.
[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:15.880]   It was like this weird sort of nihilistic, um, but online the conversation is much different.
[00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:22.800]   Everything you're talking about feels like it is in lights on the marquee online, the,
[00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:26.920]   the morning routine stuff, the, the fitness stuff is crazy.
[00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:32.660]   I mean, men and women, every man doing fitness stuff online is like a superhero and muscle
[00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:33.660]   body.
[00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:34.660]   And it's like, well, why aren't you like this at 44?
[00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:35.780]   Like, what are you doing with your time?
[00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:39.800]   This is only three hours a day and weighing all your food or whatever.
[00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:41.160]   Why can't you do this as well?
[00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:44.160]   Um, the, the connection, the optimization, the hustle culture.
[00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:47.960]   And so this is all, it's like the, the heart of productivity discourse had moved online
[00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:49.280]   and it seems like it's for the worst.
[00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:55.780]   And I'm wondering if because of algorithms, because of what works, it's the, the discourse
[00:16:55.780 --> 00:17:01.020]   around productivity because it has shifted online has shifted towards extremes.
[00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:06.080]   And that is why like a book like yours is resonating with so many people because we're
[00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:11.120]   tired of that online, that online space is treatment of this is really trying to exhaust
[00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:12.120]   us.
[00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:19.080]   Well, it's because contentment does not drive the social media marketplace.
[00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:23.360]   You know, the messages of contentment are not going to keep people on line, you know,
[00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:28.800]   so it's, it is a, there's always a deficit, you know, we have to be told where the bucket
[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:33.120]   is emptying or where we can do better so that we'll stay on and we're like, Oh wait, is
[00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:34.120]   that a problem?
[00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:38.240]   I guess I, okay, well let me see how this guy can do his burpees when he's doing it.
[00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:41.360]   You know, like it's, it is kind of silly.
[00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:49.200]   And I think to a point we are, I think most people are intuitive and wise enough to sort
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:54.880]   of see, you know, you know, they take kind of the, the, is it like the blue pill or the
[00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:55.880]   red pill?
[00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:58.760]   It's like the machinery of it all.
[00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:06.800]   And yet we're so easily influenced by it because contentment is not something that is highly
[00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:12.440]   valued for a lot of people in Western capitalistic culture.
[00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:16.460]   Like it's just not something, it doesn't, it doesn't drive anything forward.
[00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:17.680]   It doesn't make money.
[00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:21.000]   If you're happy with your life, if you're happy with what you have, if you're like,
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.980]   you know what, this is enough, that's not great for the industry.
[00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:35.040]   And so it's, it makes sense to me that the online messaging doesn't align as much as
[00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:41.400]   the publishing world because it's not going to, you know, it's not going to keep the internet
[00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:42.400]   moving anyway.
[00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:50.600]   But I also think it just, it just speaks to our, I don't know, it's like there's this,
[00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:56.840]   there's this deep need that we have to feel like that our lives mean something, you know,
[00:18:56.840 --> 00:19:00.120]   that they matter, that we want our lives to have purpose.
[00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:04.680]   And if we don't already have an answer to that question for our own lives, we're going
[00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:09.280]   to fill in the blank with what the internet is telling us we should do because we don't
[00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:10.440]   have anything there.
[00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:15.240]   So that's why really the ultimate work that I want to do is to help people name that.
[00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:17.120]   To where are you right now?
[00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:19.200]   What matters to you right now?
[00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:20.880]   What makes you feel like yourself?
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:22.600]   How do you feel like you're contributing?
[00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:24.080]   Are you resting?
[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:28.620]   Like you are a, like a tree planted by the water, right?
[00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:30.800]   You are not a balloon floating in the air.
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:33.360]   Like let's be planted where we are.
[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:40.960]   And I think that that, the more that people are that way individually, the more that contentment
[00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:46.300]   and just things being enough as they are.
[00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:49.360]   It feels like you're not being counterintuitive.
[00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:51.080]   It feels like you're not being countercultural.
[00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:54.560]   It's like, again, back to your college admission thing that you were trying to convince these
[00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:59.160]   people there is a third way to think about this, but they didn't know because the only
[00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:01.400]   things that were filling in the blanks were these two extremes.
[00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:06.840]   So it's like, we're trying, we're trying to like widen, widen that gap and help people
[00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:09.320]   see it through a completely new paradigm.
[00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:13.680]   Well, so maybe you can help me because, you know, I'm a recovering greatness addict.
[00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:20.180]   This is a, like a recurrent theme in my own life is moving beyond that narrative, which
[00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:23.220]   has been a driving narrative for my life for a while.
[00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:26.660]   And now I'm kind of at the limits of the various things I've been doing for 20 years.
[00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:27.660]   Yeah.
[00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:28.660]   You've done a good job.
[00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:30.700]   You have a lot of things that you've been great at.
[00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:31.700]   Yeah.
[00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:34.600]   But I'll tell you, it's a, it's Sisyphean, right?
[00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:36.900]   Because no matter where, this is what, this is what I found.
[00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:40.780]   It's my book is number two on the New York Times bestseller list.
[00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:41.780]   So what's the thought?
[00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:43.680]   What does it take to get the number one?
[00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:44.680]   Exactly.
[00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:45.680]   You know, that's the, it's Sisyphean.
[00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:46.880]   The finish line is always moving.
[00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:48.020]   It's always moving.
[00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:51.680]   But there is a satisfaction, right, in the hatching of the plan.
[00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:58.180]   I think this is a lot of what sort of that hustle oriented productivity is leveraging.
[00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:01.200]   There's a satisfaction in I have a plan.
[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:07.320]   Imagining the reward of the plan allows you to get a down payment on feeling good about
[00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:08.320]   it.
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:09.320]   Yep.
[00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:10.320]   And so there's that kind of fulfillment you have.
[00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:14.100]   I don't know if it's distracting from life or orienting life or whatever when you have
[00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:15.480]   some sort of plans in place.
[00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:22.520]   So I'm trying to figure out with your help, how does a integration mindset sort of replace
[00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:27.520]   that need to have too much, have your focus on a future state that like, oh, I have this
[00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:30.600]   plan and this exciting, I can daydream about the plan.
[00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:37.920]   How do we get more satisfaction out of being more present with our life as it is now and
[00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:39.080]   what's good about it and what we're doing with it?
[00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:44.040]   Like help me walk through as recovering greatness addict, how to move more towards like an integration
[00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:45.040]   mindset.
[00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:48.680]   I think that you are and I'm the same way.
[00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:55.320]   People who are really good planners in the normative way, people who are really good
[00:21:55.320 --> 00:22:00.120]   at organization and the way that the narrow way that we've all been taught it should look,
[00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:05.640]   it's harder for us to actually disengage it because we are rewarded by it because we're
[00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:06.640]   good at it.
[00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:12.280]   We can get that dopamine hit when we make the plan and when it might come true.
[00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:17.600]   And so it's actually, I think, harder work for people who are naturally gifted at preparation
[00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:21.080]   and organization and even optimization.
[00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:29.000]   And if your actual work, if your career trajectory is one that people would envy, people see
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   you, I know people see you as somebody that they want to follow.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.080]   Like I like, Cal has done it.
[00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:39.080]   What did Cal do?
[00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:40.920]   How can I do it like Cal did?
[00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:46.040]   So it's actually a lot harder for people who are good at the thing to disengage from the
[00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:47.040]   thing.
[00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:52.880]   And I will say, you had mentioned it before, that plan is capitalized because it's an acronym.
[00:22:52.880 --> 00:23:01.040]   So the three of the letters of that acronym, the P, A, and the N, prepare, adjust, and
[00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:02.480]   notice.
[00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:08.000]   Those three words work in harmony with one another.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.160]   They work equally with one another.
[00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:17.760]   And what has happened is that we have been given this very narrow view of what it means
[00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:19.640]   to be a planner.
[00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:26.240]   And I think a way that we can disengage from this idea of greatness and looking at our
[00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:31.960]   lives through a lens of integration and almost in this state of recovery almost is to look
[00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:36.320]   to the people in our lives who are actually really, really good, maybe not at preparation,
[00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:40.640]   but at making adjustments in the moment, who are really good at noticing what's happening
[00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:44.680]   in the room, that they know what's happening with the people that we walk in and we're
[00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:45.680]   like, "Okay, here's our checklist.
[00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:46.680]   Let's go."
[00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:50.160]   And they walk in and they go, "The vibe in here.
[00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:51.680]   Somebody's worried about their job."
[00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:58.520]   Or there are people who are really gifted at these other just as important elements,
[00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:00.120]   in my opinion, of planning.
[00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:08.560]   And so if we can expand our definition of what it means to be a good planner into someone
[00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:13.480]   who is also really good at pivoting, really good at immediate problem solving, that they
[00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:18.120]   don't have to have the color-coded list, that they don't have to have the Google calendar
[00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:23.360]   that's set up in such a way that every single minute is accounted for, that there are people
[00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:27.080]   who can, again, they're intuitive and they walk in a room and they're relational or they're
[00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:33.880]   quiet or they just know what's going on under the surface for people.
[00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:39.880]   People like that have been left out of the conversation of what it means to be a good
[00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:43.080]   planner and therefore they don't have a problem with what I'm saying.
[00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:47.440]   They're like, "Oh, I'm on board because you're leaving space for me."
[00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:51.800]   For people like you and I, it's like, "Oh, wait a minute, but I'm really good at this
[00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:52.800]   though.
[00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:55.920]   Why do I have to stop?"
[00:24:55.920 --> 00:25:04.480]   And I would say that for people like both of us who have this addiction, have had this
[00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:11.160]   addiction to greatness and optimization and leveling up all the time, for us to look back
[00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:15.600]   and go, "What is it done?
[00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:17.640]   What is it good for?"
[00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:21.600]   It has gotten me things, of course.
[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:23.780]   It's gotten us career success or whatever.
[00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:32.840]   But if you stop and go, "If that's where I begin, if I open my eyes in the morning and
[00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:37.240]   I put on a pair of glasses and that lens is a lens of greatness, how much am I going to
[00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:38.440]   get done today?
[00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:40.640]   How impressive am I going to be?
[00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:42.320]   How organized am I going to be?"
[00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:46.920]   In this very normative sense that I'm already good at and have been affirmed in, listen,
[00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:55.200]   it is really hard to switch those glasses to glasses of integration because it's smaller.
[00:25:55.200 --> 00:26:01.120]   It makes people smaller in a way at first that's really scary, I think.
[00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:08.280]   I think moving to a place of integration, you take yourself off the pedestal in a way
[00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:10.120]   that's like, "Oh."
[00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:15.560]   It's uncomfortable because for many of us, I will not speak for you in this.
[00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:20.120]   My success, I was valedictorian of my high school class.
[00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:25.000]   I was voted most dependable by my senior class.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:30.600]   In second grade, teachers were like, starting then, I was always the room monitor when the
[00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:32.360]   teacher left the room.
[00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:34.040]   I do things well.
[00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:37.900]   I can be depended on and I'm going to be excellent at them.
[00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:41.520]   If that has been your trajectory for a long time, it's really hard to separate that from
[00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:44.240]   your value as a person.
[00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:49.520]   It's really scary and this doesn't have to become like a therapy session or whatever.
[00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:54.400]   I think that's why it's hard because when you're rewarded for being great and you're
[00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:57.960]   great at being great, why would you want to let that go?
[00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:02.120]   But it's also exhausting on the inside and you think if you don't, like if I didn't make
[00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:04.720]   the New York Times for this book, I've written three books.
[00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:08.640]   The first two made all four lists and this one I'm like, "Well, if I don't make this
[00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:10.760]   one, everybody in the industry is going to think I'm an idiot and I don't know what I'm
[00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:15.160]   talking about," even though the book came out in a really competitive month.
[00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:22.560]   Greatness becomes this, it's like the core of your identity in a way that takes you out
[00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:25.480]   of your own life.
[00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:27.080]   It's kind of like you have to choose.
[00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:28.240]   I have to choose.
[00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:34.240]   I would rather be a person who is okay with the disappointment of not being great at a
[00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:41.280]   thing and being with myself in that, than being great and feel like a husk of a person.
[00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:45.140]   It's a very soul-level choice.
[00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:46.140]   Let's stick with it then.
[00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:49.560]   You mentioned, from a practical perspective, you mentioned the pyramid.
[00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:53.960]   So it's prepare, notice, adjust, and they're supposed to be in balance, right?
[00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:57.040]   So it's sort of like an equilateral triangle, if we're going to be nerdy about it.
[00:27:57.040 --> 00:28:00.960]   Yeah, a tetrahedron I think is what the real word is.
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:04.120]   Even tetrahedron doesn't sound as good as a planned pyramid, so we had to go with planned
[00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:05.120]   pyramids.
[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:06.120]   Now you're speaking my language.
[00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:08.080]   Like, let's get into the right polygon references.
[00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:09.080]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:10.080]   Yeah, let's talk about.
[00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:14.800]   If there's no trigonometry in your time management book, what are you doing?
[00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:15.800]   What are we doing?
[00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:16.800]   Yeah, what are we doing?
[00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:17.800]   What are we doing here?
[00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:18.800]   Absolutely.
[00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:19.800]   All right, so walk us through that, though.
[00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:23.000]   Okay, so prepare, adjust, notice, trying to keep these three things in balance.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:27.440]   And then you have live, I've heard it both described as the foundation and also as the
[00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:28.440]   point.
[00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:29.440]   It's the point.
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:30.440]   Yeah, the point.
[00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:35.120]   So the foundation of the pyramid itself is what matters to you in the season that you're
[00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:36.120]   in.
[00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:37.120]   Okay.
[00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:38.120]   All right, so walk us through this.
[00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:39.120]   Yeah.
[00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:40.120]   Yeah, we're going to make.
[00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:41.120]   So let's throw a triangle on the ground.
[00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:42.120]   Okay?
[00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:43.120]   That's the foundation of our pyramid here.
[00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:45.960]   The triangle on the ground is what matters to you in the season that you're in.
[00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:50.720]   What matters to you right now, if you think back, Cal, to when you were 23, what mattered
[00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:54.520]   to you at the age of 23 probably does not matter now.
[00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:55.520]   And it shouldn't.
[00:28:55.520 --> 00:29:00.600]   And I think a lot of times what matters to us is going to change as we grow and we evolve
[00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:03.480]   as people and our families change and all of that.
[00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:11.560]   So it's wise, it is so wise to not lock in on something that matters to you 15 years
[00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:12.560]   ago.
[00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:13.640]   You're allowed to change your mind.
[00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:15.320]   You're allowed to change your mind.
[00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:17.240]   So name what matters to you right now in the season you're in.
[00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:18.240]   And then you have those three.
[00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:22.680]   And you're saying, by the way, that that scale of season can also be very variable, right?
[00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:26.440]   Like this could change throughout the year as well as change throughout your life.
[00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:29.240]   It could change over the decades, but it also could change within the month.
[00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:32.360]   Like you have these different scales, which I think is an important concept.
[00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:33.360]   Yeah.
[00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:37.880]   Like my, we are recording this the week after Thanksgiving.
[00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:41.080]   My daughter has had pneumonia for the last 10 days.
[00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:43.400]   We have been in, that's been the season that we're in.
[00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:47.000]   What matters right now with the kids sick at home and we're moving into like family
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:52.640]   coming in and I have to cook a big meal and all the things, your priorities have to change
[00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:54.640]   based on what matters right now.
[00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:57.180]   It is a deeply, deeply wise thing to do.
[00:29:57.180 --> 00:30:01.800]   And the reason that it feels strange to do that, just to, you know, go down a rabbit
[00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:08.680]   trail really quickly is because most of the traditional productivity books historically
[00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:14.800]   have been like, make a plan, you know, figure out your idea life 30 years down the road,
[00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:16.880]   reverse engineer it and stick with the plan.
[00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:19.620]   And if you don't, you're an undisciplined person.
[00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:21.240]   Like that's sort of the vibe.
[00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:22.240]   Yeah.
[00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:26.480]   Like that's not sustainable or realistic for anyone really.
[00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:28.680]   So yeah, name what matters in your season.
[00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:35.640]   Your season can be whatever boundary you need it to be.
[00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:39.920]   And then the three sides of the pyramid are prepare, adjust and notice.
[00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:43.980]   And just for like the sake of under, I won't go through all of them, but just to kind of
[00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:48.600]   get a vibe, there are principles for each one of these letters to help you sort of know
[00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:51.960]   like, how am I, where, where am I in this?
[00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:53.160]   Just reminders for us.
[00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:57.320]   So like prepare, some of the mindsets for prepare are not everything can matter.
[00:30:57.320 --> 00:31:03.400]   As you're preparing, you have to believe that not every single thing in your life can matter
[00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:04.840]   in an equal way.
[00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:06.920]   A plan that you make, a plan is an intention.
[00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:08.600]   It is not a pass fail.
[00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:11.920]   If you, if you prepare something and it doesn't go to plan, it doesn't mean it failed or that
[00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:12.920]   you failed.
[00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:15.060]   It just means the intention didn't happen.
[00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:16.060]   It's life.
[00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:17.520]   It's the way it goes.
[00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:23.200]   For adjust, match your expectations to the energy that you're willing and able to give.
[00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:28.840]   If you have, so often if we decide that we're going to do something, we have expectations
[00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:31.040]   for something and it doesn't happen.
[00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:35.980]   We try to hack our energy rather than adjust our expectations, right?
[00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:37.880]   So as that's a way that we adjust.
[00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:43.040]   For notice, staying grounded is better than staying on task.
[00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:44.320]   That's a weird one for people to get behind.
[00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:45.640]   They're like, wait a minute.
[00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:46.800]   The task is all the things.
[00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:52.120]   I'm like, I think you need to start by being with yourself and in that moment going, what
[00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:53.240]   matters most right now?
[00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:59.840]   Like if for me, the times that take me out of that, the quickest are my children.
[00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:05.480]   And so if I, if a kid is like still lying on the couch and his ride is picking him up
[00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:08.040]   for school in five minutes and he has not brushed his teeth and he doesn't have shoes
[00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:13.240]   on and he's 15 years old and I start to go, he can legally drive a car in a year and he
[00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:14.920]   still forgets to brush his teeth.
[00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:15.920]   What are we doing?
[00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:20.640]   I will come, I will turn into a rage mother, a Hulk monster.
[00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:25.760]   But if I go, okay, hold on, notice what matters right now actually is that I stay connected
[00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:27.000]   with my kid.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.280]   Not that I force him to be this compliant person that I want him to be.
[00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:31.920]   For me, that's my goal.
[00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:33.960]   So I'm going to go, what matters right now?
[00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:36.840]   I'm going to stay grounded rather than getting him on task.
[00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:41.600]   I'm going to be kind so that I can go to him and stay kind and preserve this relationship
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:43.920]   and then also be like, get off the couch and go brush your teeth.
[00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:49.320]   You know, it's like we're not, it's really important when I talk about this, it's really
[00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:56.920]   important to make sure that people understand, I'm not saying don't do your stuff.
[00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:58.480]   Don't be good at your stuff.
[00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:00.000]   Don't try to even be great.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:06.720]   But if you begin with this far out future view, with this lens of I've got to do all
[00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:13.120]   of it perfectly well and I cannot deviate off course, rather than this fluid, very human,
[00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:17.360]   wise responsiveness to your life, you will burn out so fast.
[00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:24.880]   But you can, I believe you still, you get your things done better and in a way that
[00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:30.640]   brings you more fulfillment when you are a tree by the water.
[00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:34.760]   You know, when those roots keep going deep and then back to the pyramid, the L is the
[00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:35.760]   point.
[00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:36.760]   It's the top.
[00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:37.760]   It's pulling it all up.
[00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:38.760]   It's pulling it all up to the point of it all.
[00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:40.960]   The 2D shape into a 3D.
[00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:41.960]   Yes.
[00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:47.240]   To live our lives, to be where we are, to enjoy our people, to go outside and do the
[00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:50.680]   fun things we like to do.
[00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:57.640]   I don't want to live only when I'm 70 years old and I've done all of these things to get
[00:33:57.640 --> 00:33:59.560]   me to this future ideal place.
[00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:00.560]   I want to live today.
[00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:02.120]   I want to live my life right now.
[00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:09.080]   Well, I mean, first I'll say to my audience, partially why this is important is we don't
[00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:10.960]   cover this well.
[00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:14.680]   I don't do a ton of time management advice.
[00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:15.680]   I'm known for it.
[00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:19.160]   But what I do talk about tends to be very narrowly focused.
[00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:21.400]   I think this is another issue.
[00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:27.000]   Very narrowly focused on the modern knowledge work, digital office, and it's like a survival
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   game.
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:32.400]   It's this, "Oh my God, I'm getting 150 emails a day.
[00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:37.000]   I'm feeling murderous towards the inventor of Zoom.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:43.600]   And we got to fix this, but how do I survive that eight hours in the office without going
[00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:46.160]   insane and actually getting things done?"
[00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:50.160]   But what I've learned, and I have to argue with my audience a lot, is the mindset that
[00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:55.040]   you would use for, "How do I manage this weird, terrible, busy period at the beginning
[00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:58.720]   of COVID where everything's moving online in a particular job, and I have 10 bosses
[00:34:58.720 --> 00:34:59.840]   yelling at me?"
[00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:02.120]   It doesn't translate to other things.
[00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:04.240]   It doesn't translate to all the other parts of your life.
[00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:07.520]   It's not a good way to go about almost anything else that's happening in your life.
[00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:08.760]   It is very artificial.
[00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:12.680]   I had this, actually we agreed in the end, I had this conversation with Oliver Berkman
[00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:18.120]   about it, where I was basically, he was talking about his ideal way to plan, and I think there's
[00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:19.960]   a lot of similarities with your book.
[00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:22.560]   And I was like, "Yeah, that is right.
[00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:28.960]   And the stuff I'm talking about is some unfortunate reality of particular jobs, and you want to
[00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:31.080]   get away from it as quickly as you can throughout your day."
[00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:33.160]   So I want to first give that disclaimer to my audience.
[00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:37.840]   This is great because I don't cover well, "How do you deal with all of your life?"
[00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:39.960]   And not just, "How do I deal with my email inbox?"
[00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:40.960]   Which is much more boring.
[00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:42.240]   How do you deal with all of your life?
[00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:43.240]   But guess what?
[00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:47.000]   How do you deal with your inbox is essential to how you deal with your life.
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.920]   I mean, it is.
[00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:49.920]   It's all connected.
[00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:55.000]   It's a lot harder to talk about how to deal with your whole life because it's so big.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:58.040]   The email problem is something that feels, "Okay, well, this is manageable.
[00:35:58.040 --> 00:35:59.040]   I can figure this out.
[00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:03.520]   I can focus my energy on this and solve this problem, that this is a huge problem in my
[00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:04.520]   work."
[00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:05.520]   And for a lot of people, it is.
[00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:06.520]   So it's deeply valuable.
[00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:13.680]   But you're right, most of those approaches, you're right, they don't translate as well
[00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:16.180]   to the rest of life very easily, very seamlessly.
[00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:20.960]   And something that's interesting about the book is in the prepare leg of that base, the
[00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:27.720]   edge of that triangle that builds up into the pyramid, you have advice for systems,
[00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:28.720]   right?
[00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:31.840]   When you're preparing, trying to figure out what makes sense to do, you talk about what's
[00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:36.440]   a good way to think about a to-do list, for example, and you have a nice model there for
[00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:40.280]   something that's less strict than specific days.
[00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:43.440]   You talk about a planning rhythm, how you're kind of planning out what you want to get
[00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:45.000]   done at different timescales.
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:48.720]   But the vibe is, these systems aren't the hard part.
[00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:52.720]   Yes, you need to write down what you need to do somewhere so you don't have to keep
[00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:53.720]   track of it in your head.
[00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:55.720]   Yeah, you need to think ahead.
[00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:59.000]   Someone's coming and you want to know that, like, I need to start preparing a week in
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:00.720]   advance or whatever.
[00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:03.440]   But it's de-centered in your book.
[00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:06.920]   It's actually the psychology is what's more important.
[00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:11.560]   The systems are kind of the easy part, like, yeah, be organized and make some reasonable
[00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:12.560]   decisions.
[00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:15.840]   But you have to adjust and you have to notice and you can't fall away.
[00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:17.560]   The adjustment is a fantastic point.
[00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:20.040]   I mean, I often talk about fairytale planning.
[00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:23.520]   It's like when we're sitting down and trying to plan our day or our week, we write like
[00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:28.960]   a fairytale about, in theory, if you are taking Felix Felicitas or whatever the potion is
[00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:31.800]   from Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, I definitely don't have three boys who read
[00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:33.800]   that book recently.
[00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:39.200]   In the perfect day, like we often plan, like, wouldn't it be great if I was able to get
[00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:42.240]   like three hours of riding in plus this plus this workout.
[00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:46.320]   But during the workout, I'm going to do my conference scheduling for my kids on the Peloton
[00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:47.320]   bike.
[00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:50.760]   And then, like, as I move and you lay out this day and then you fall in love with it.
[00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:51.760]   What a great fairytale.
[00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:56.120]   I'm really comforted by the idea of a world in which all of this works out like this and
[00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:58.980]   you feel great about that fairytale world you built.
[00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:04.200]   And then, like, 12 minutes into that day, of course, the Peloton bike is on fire and,
[00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:07.240]   you know, you've missed your kid has to come home sick or whatever.
[00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:09.920]   And you're like, oh, this wasn't a realistic plan.
[00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:11.240]   It was a fairytale plan.
[00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:15.840]   So that ability that like adjustments the whole game, it's like a rough intention and
[00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:17.840]   then you start to roll with it.
[00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:22.680]   It's like I think of mission control in Apollo 13.
[00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:25.000]   You're rolling with the oxygen tanks exploded.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:30.120]   Like that's your skill is like rolling with and making reasonable decisions, not making
[00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:31.120]   a fairytale come true.
[00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:33.840]   Yeah, that room was that room was full of problem solvers.
[00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:34.840]   Yeah.
[00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:35.840]   It wasn't full of planners.
[00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:37.680]   It was full of problem solvers.
[00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:40.040]   I say I say this in my work a lot.
[00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:44.320]   Learning to pivot is more important than learning to plan.
[00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:56.040]   I think we are better served as people in cultivating the skill or maybe just the comfort.
[00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:58.040]   Maybe it's not even a skill.
[00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:03.000]   Maybe for some of us, it's just like I am not going to freak out because this fairytale
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:06.960]   plan didn't work or even just a basic non fairytale plan.
[00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:10.760]   I'm going to be OK that not everything is OK.
[00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:11.760]   Yeah.
[00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:12.760]   Like I'm going to be here.
[00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:13.760]   That's that's what it is.
[00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:17.560]   That's the psychology of it is because we are required.
[00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:23.440]   Our lives require us to pivot far more than they require us to plan.
[00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:30.760]   But we don't recognize that really, because so much of what we have been taught, especially
[00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:36.160]   in the early 2000s, was it was all about preparation.
[00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:37.960]   That was the whole thing.
[00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:45.760]   So it makes sense that people of this generation, so to speak, are like, well, what am I if
[00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:48.040]   I don't have my list ready to go?
[00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:51.120]   Like if I don't know what my day is going to look like, if I don't have, you know, theme
[00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:55.920]   work days, if I don't if everything doesn't fit into this category or bucket or whatever.
[00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:59.880]   And it makes me think of recently I did an interview on another show that's hosted by
[00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:06.800]   two women and one of them, she's like I have she held up her she held up her planner and
[00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:07.800]   like she had post-it notes.
[00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:08.800]   She had lists everywhere.
[00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:09.800]   Right.
[00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:13.200]   And then the other host, she said, I've never made a list of my life.
[00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:15.000]   And and they said, what do we do?
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:16.960]   Like how do we how do we meld these?
[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:18.520]   Like what do we need to do to get to the middle?
[00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:20.960]   And I said, y'all, you don't have to make a middle.
[00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:22.160]   Like do what works for you.
[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:27.200]   You don't have to fall into this normative way of planning that we've been taught because
[00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:33.560]   it really only works well for a small sliver of people who are naturally wired to do that.
[00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:42.640]   And so there's this we have to give ourselves permission to be okay that the things fall
[00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:48.860]   apart 12 minutes in, that that's expected, that we really that us expecting our plan
[00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:51.480]   to not work is not fatalistic.
[00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:56.680]   It's not even it doesn't keep us from getting our stuff done.
[00:40:56.680 --> 00:40:57.680]   I just think it's realistic.
[00:40:57.680 --> 00:40:58.680]   Yeah.
[00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:01.840]   And we go, it's probably it's probably not going to work.
[00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:03.600]   If it does, that's so rad.
[00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:12.360]   But at least to have a baseline to work from rather than nothing, or that it's so rigid
[00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:17.800]   that it's not flexible, right, because most of our lives are deeply flexible, especially
[00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:22.520]   a woman's life if she's at home taking care of her kids and she's doing you know, like,
[00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:28.160]   I have spoken to so many people over the last couple of years about this book and the number
[00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:37.240]   of women especially who are like, I feel so seen because like 93% of the time management
[00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:44.320]   books are written by men and 70 to 90% of them are read by women.
[00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:53.440]   And so we need a broader definition of what it means to not necessarily just plan or organize
[00:41:53.440 --> 00:42:01.200]   but to really live and these ideas of contentment and pivoting that these things are valued
[00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:07.560]   at a very high level above greatness, that we value those things more than we value the
[00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:08.560]   greatness.
[00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:09.560]   It doesn't mean we dismiss the greatness.
[00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:10.560]   But you're right.
[00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:11.800]   It's like they're decentered.
[00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:16.480]   The greatness and the task fulfillment is decentered.
[00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:20.520]   The humanity is in the center where I think it needs to be.
[00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:24.360]   Well, I want to talk about the audience point because I think this is also a fascinating
[00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:26.360]   point about the genre in general.
[00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:31.040]   So I mean, this book, though, has a broad audience, you're very specific in the book
[00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:37.040]   that you have women in mind, in particular, yes, as an underserved, as you said, 93% of
[00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:42.380]   time management productivity books are written by men, I probably wrote 25% of those.
[00:42:42.380 --> 00:42:43.380]   And they're all real good.
[00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:44.940]   I've read every single one of them.
[00:42:44.940 --> 00:42:46.700]   But they're not.
[00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:52.700]   But the readership is not only split halfway, but even you said 70% Yeah.
[00:42:52.700 --> 00:42:57.660]   And I've come to realize this later in my career that they're the people writing these
[00:42:57.660 --> 00:43:02.580]   books, we don't necessarily think how specific our voices, because there's really only been
[00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:07.660]   two major there's been two dominant voices as far as I can tell in time management productivity.
[00:43:07.660 --> 00:43:11.180]   We have the corporate voice, which was like the dominant voice from like Stephen Covey
[00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:15.940]   on through the 90s, which was very much to like, this comes out of helping people in
[00:43:15.940 --> 00:43:21.020]   like a large company, like manage and be a manager, this goes all the way back, right.
[00:43:21.020 --> 00:43:24.740]   And then we got the kind of the wave that I was a part of, which I think of as like,
[00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:31.260]   I don't know, the, the blogging bro voice, this was like the more entrepreneurial coming
[00:43:31.260 --> 00:43:35.600]   out of like new media online spaces coming out of like the blog revolution in the 2000s.
[00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:39.260]   And there's like Tim Ferriss, and there's me, etc, whatever.
[00:43:39.260 --> 00:43:42.260]   Those are two very, those are perfectly fine voices, like they're speaking to particular
[00:43:42.260 --> 00:43:44.660]   audiences, but they're very specific.
[00:43:44.660 --> 00:43:47.500]   And I learned this one, because, you know, some of my books have sold enough copy now
[00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:52.000]   as I hear from a lot of people, and man, I learned quick, the way I think and talk about
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:53.860]   things is not universal.
[00:43:53.860 --> 00:43:56.340]   And it took me a while to understand this, because I'd be like, I don't understand these
[00:43:56.340 --> 00:43:57.340]   complaints.
[00:43:57.340 --> 00:44:02.780]   Like, I'm, I'm very engineering and logical, I guess this not I am delivering information
[00:44:02.780 --> 00:44:06.820]   that is like an optimal way of thinking about how the brain functions.
[00:44:06.820 --> 00:44:10.780]   And so now I've really come to appreciate this idea that there needs to be many different
[00:44:10.780 --> 00:44:14.100]   flavors of talking about these issues.
[00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:19.680]   So talk about so with women audiences in particular, this has been very ill served.
[00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:22.580]   So in what way is like, what is it?
[00:44:22.580 --> 00:44:27.860]   What is it that you're noticing was missing that you're able to fill in?
[00:44:27.860 --> 00:44:36.580]   Yeah, it's, I think an important word here is that what we have been given is just incomplete.
[00:44:36.580 --> 00:44:37.900]   None of it's wrong.
[00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:40.780]   You know, I mean, there are definitely things that I don't align with that I don't, I'm
[00:44:40.780 --> 00:44:43.420]   like, I don't really want to live my life that way.
[00:44:43.420 --> 00:44:46.880]   But it's not that it's like fundamentally wrong.
[00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:48.660]   It's just we all get to choose, right?
[00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:51.880]   But the, the advice has been incomplete, especially for women.
[00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:56.260]   And this is, this is a pretty broad, this is a pretty broad thing.
[00:44:56.260 --> 00:45:01.820]   But we live, we live in a patriarchal society, it was built for men by men.
[00:45:01.820 --> 00:45:08.060]   And women have not had a whole lot of time where their voice has been loud enough for
[00:45:08.060 --> 00:45:15.780]   the changes and adjustments that they are, that we are wanting on a on a cultural level,
[00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:17.220]   on a systemic level.
[00:45:17.220 --> 00:45:24.260]   There's just not been a lot of time where those things are now so part of the culture
[00:45:24.260 --> 00:45:26.200]   that we can feel it.
[00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:41.080]   But I still feel, I still feel like more is expected of me than is expected of my husband.
[00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:44.600]   Like women are not allowed to be mediocre.
[00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:48.200]   We can't be mediocre mothers, mediocre spouses or partners.
[00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:49.680]   We can't be mediocre to our jobs.
[00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:53.640]   Like we have to be excellent at everything.
[00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:58.440]   Kids can be mediocre in places and they don't really get a lot of flack for it.
[00:45:58.440 --> 00:46:07.280]   And so when you are in a position where you are holding almost, it's a generality here,
[00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:09.200]   but it's a generality for a reason.
[00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:12.300]   It is something that is very true for a lot of women.
[00:46:12.300 --> 00:46:17.120]   Women are expected to hold more than their male counterparts are in the home and in work.
[00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:22.880]   And we're the ones probably getting the Christmas gifts and figuring out like the logistics
[00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:26.040]   of getting the kid their thing for this, you know, field trip that they're doing.
[00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:30.240]   And they're just all of these invisible pieces that are floating around all the time.
[00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:34.920]   My husband doesn't know the names of my kids, friends, parents.
[00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:35.920]   He doesn't have their numbers.
[00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:36.920]   I do.
[00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:37.920]   Yeah.
[00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:38.920]   Right.
[00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:39.920]   Because I'm the one who's home.
[00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:40.920]   I work from home.
[00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:41.920]   He doesn't.
[00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:42.920]   And so it makes sense that I would have them.
[00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:48.200]   But also it's too accepted that women are holding so much more, but women are also not
[00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:50.280]   given as much support to do those things.
[00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:55.280]   And one of the ways that that shows up is in the books that are available to women,
[00:46:55.280 --> 00:47:00.720]   that they are written not with their own life experience in mind.
[00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:04.160]   And we're also not paying attention to like, you can, you can read the plan to be a dude.
[00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:05.400]   I don't come after you.
[00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:12.560]   Like it's, I don't come after you hard because I think that this is actually a way of viewing
[00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:18.200]   our lives that is attractive to a lot of people, men and women.
[00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:22.280]   Because we, a lot of us are like, man, trying to be great at everything really is exhausting.
[00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:23.980]   Let's find a, let's find a new paradigm.
[00:47:23.980 --> 00:47:28.560]   So it's not, it's not exclusively for women, but there is also, there's a, there's a chapter
[00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:33.520]   in the book about periods, because listen, if you're a lady and your energy is changing,
[00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:36.160]   if you're in your forties and you're going through perimenopause right now, and you have
[00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:42.480]   a part-time job of having to eat protein now, it's a whole thing that dudes just don't understand.
[00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:49.600]   And they're, it's okay that they don't, but we need wider resources for the lived experience
[00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:54.240]   and the cultural pressures and the relational expectations and all of these things that
[00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:55.640]   women hold.
[00:47:55.640 --> 00:48:01.520]   And so if you say, yeah, you need to prioritize getting eight to 10 hours of sleep every night.
[00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:05.920]   And I'm like, well, are you, my kid, my kid wakes me up in the middle of the night.
[00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:06.920]   What are you talking about?
[00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:07.920]   That's not a thing.
[00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:12.640]   Like they're just, it feels unrealistic, but what, this is the last thing I'll say about
[00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:20.680]   this because I can get a little heated because I care so much about women having their, their,
[00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:24.680]   their lives honored in this way.
[00:48:24.680 --> 00:48:34.680]   But what, what I think happens is that if all of the resources say, here's how it's done
[00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:40.340]   and a woman cannot do it, she thinks she's the problem.
[00:48:40.340 --> 00:48:41.840]   It's not the system.
[00:48:41.840 --> 00:48:45.700]   It's not that that book's not for me or this part or this part might work, but not the
[00:48:45.700 --> 00:48:46.700]   whole thing.
[00:48:46.700 --> 00:48:48.600]   Like it becomes an identity thing.
[00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:50.880]   It's like, the problem is me.
[00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:58.200]   And so the very beginning of the plan is to show us all the problem is not you.
[00:48:58.200 --> 00:48:59.200]   The problem is not you.
[00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:02.640]   The problem is that this industry of time management and productivity is built on a
[00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:08.280]   lens and a, and a centering of greatness and optimization and leveling up.
[00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:11.840]   It has been historically, it is starting to shift, which I am so glad that we're part
[00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:13.560]   of that.
[00:49:13.560 --> 00:49:17.320]   But if you are, all you're hearing is be great, do great.
[00:49:17.320 --> 00:49:18.320]   It's possible.
[00:49:18.320 --> 00:49:20.000]   See, everyone else is doing it.
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:24.960]   And you're just over here struggling day to day and you're like, I can't even take a nap.
[00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:27.520]   Like what are you talking about?
[00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:33.840]   It's, it feels really devastating on like a soul level and because we think the problem
[00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:36.120]   is us and the problem is not you.
[00:49:36.120 --> 00:49:37.120]   It's not you.
[00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:40.960]   Well, I think it's much needed.
[00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:47.360]   I think my, my impression of male centric time management productivity is that it's
[00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:49.720]   sort of a psychological vacuum.
[00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:57.080]   So like there's, there's very little psychological reality in it because it's men are more simplistic
[00:49:57.080 --> 00:49:58.080]   about it.
[00:49:58.080 --> 00:49:59.080]   It's all kind of optional.
[00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:01.200]   Like, Oh, wouldn't it be cool?
[00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:06.640]   It'd be cool to get in really good shape, but like, I don't, I'm also, if that's not
[00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:10.040]   me and I've got the, the, the belly and the, that's fine.
[00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:13.600]   Like a high five, like you do you, like you don't feel, it all feels optional.
[00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:18.800]   It might be really cool to get super organized and make my, my web business like take over
[00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:19.800]   whatever.
[00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:22.560]   It would be cool to pursue that, but like, I don't care if I don't.
[00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:24.480]   And like, you know, no one's going to judge me if I don't.
[00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:29.640]   And so there's a lack of a lack of psychological language, I would say.
[00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:35.720]   So I mean, I, I can imagine there's multiple groups that we need specialization in this
[00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:36.720]   topic.
[00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:37.720]   Yeah.
[00:50:37.720 --> 00:50:43.320]   Because I mean, everyone has to deal with the issue of just life, organizing life, figuring
[00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:47.060]   out what to do or what not to do, how to, you know, make sure the electric bill gets
[00:50:47.060 --> 00:50:48.740]   paid or figure out.
[00:50:48.740 --> 00:50:52.240]   And there's so many different relevant ways of receiving that.
[00:50:52.240 --> 00:50:56.240]   So I really love this idea and this is the obvious big missing one because it's half
[00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:57.240]   the population.
[00:50:57.240 --> 00:50:59.560]   So like, let's start with women.
[00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:03.680]   This is half the population and the majority of actually the readers of these books.
[00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:09.120]   But you could imagine other, age stratified is something I've been thinking about recently.
[00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:10.120]   Absolutely.
[00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:15.320]   If you're 24, maybe more of like this, the more like online, you know, I don't know,
[00:51:15.320 --> 00:51:18.800]   get after it, like whatever, like actually maybe that's like keeping you out of trouble.
[00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:22.040]   And maybe that's good when you're in your 20s and you have all this time and you're,
[00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:25.480]   you're laying a base of whatever that'll be, so then you can like, as you have kids and
[00:51:25.480 --> 00:51:29.040]   you have no time, you can, you'll be okay or say, I don't know, maybe that's better.
[00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:33.560]   I hear a lot from people who are nearing retirement as another group and like, well, wait, I'm
[00:51:33.560 --> 00:51:35.320]   thinking about things completely differently.
[00:51:35.320 --> 00:51:39.960]   Like how do I, so I love this movement and I, and I, and I love what you're doing with
[00:51:39.960 --> 00:51:40.960]   it.
[00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:41.960]   So I'm a, and you say the response has been strong.
[00:51:41.960 --> 00:51:45.320]   I'm not surprised that you're, yeah, it has been.
[00:51:45.320 --> 00:51:48.480]   It's definitely been stronger from women than from men.
[00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:55.080]   I, I've most of the rooms I speak to are majority women, but I spoke at a conference a few weeks
[00:51:55.080 --> 00:51:59.840]   ago and it was, it was half and half and it was, it was really interesting that I had
[00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:05.240]   to, I had to kind of get the, get the guys on board a little bit because it was a room
[00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:06.880]   full of entrepreneurs.
[00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:08.640]   They were very successful people.
[00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:13.640]   Again, their greatness is honored and, and, and that's not bad, like that's morally neutral,
[00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:14.640]   right?
[00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:15.640]   It's a great thing.
[00:52:15.640 --> 00:52:21.240]   It's a great thing to have a life experience, this, this psychological language.
[00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:22.240]   You're right.
[00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:24.840]   It's not something that we're hearing enough across the board.
[00:52:24.840 --> 00:52:27.760]   Women are hearing it and they're resonating with it very quickly because they're like,
[00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:29.120]   oh, I know that's my life.
[00:52:29.120 --> 00:52:30.120]   I see that.
[00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:35.160]   But we, I, I want, it's why I'm so grateful that you even asked me to be on your show
[00:52:35.160 --> 00:52:37.840]   because this is not a message for women.
[00:52:37.840 --> 00:52:39.520]   This is a message for all people.
[00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:43.560]   Like it makes, I told the men in this room, I said, you might not, you might not align
[00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:44.560]   with this.
[00:52:44.560 --> 00:52:48.280]   This might not, this might not be how you want to see your own life, but I guarantee
[00:52:48.280 --> 00:52:51.600]   that there are people on your team, it's how they would want to see theirs.
[00:52:51.600 --> 00:52:58.160]   And so it makes you a better leader for you to understand and widen the perspectives of
[00:52:58.160 --> 00:53:04.400]   the people that you work with, that not everybody wants to be accessible 24 hours a day.
[00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:05.760]   They don't want that kind of job.
[00:53:05.760 --> 00:53:10.360]   They don't, they don't want that kind of, um, the, the hustle and the, and the greatness
[00:53:10.360 --> 00:53:14.680]   that they may, that you think that they aspire to, they actually don't.
[00:53:14.680 --> 00:53:20.160]   And so let's honor people's humanity more than you, you know, prize their productivity.
[00:53:20.160 --> 00:53:23.760]   Let's start there and, and see them in that.
[00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:30.600]   And so it's, it's a really important message for all of us to just be exposed to.
[00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:32.160]   It's exposure therapy right now.
[00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:40.120]   Like I just want, I just want more people and men to hear that women, we feel like we're
[00:53:40.120 --> 00:53:46.200]   whining that we're like, it's just so hard to take care of the kids and to do the thing,
[00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:48.640]   you know, dah, dah, dah, because it's not your lived experience.
[00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:53.160]   It's very easy to say, well, maybe they just need to figure out a different system.
[00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:57.120]   You know, we're, we are all under the umbrella of thinking, well, maybe you just need a different
[00:53:57.120 --> 00:54:02.000]   system rather than recognizing that the system could be broken in some ways.
[00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:03.000]   You're in a different system.
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:04.000]   We're in a different system.
[00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:05.000]   Yeah.
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:06.000]   We're swimming in different water.
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:07.000]   Yeah.
[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:08.000]   Yeah.
[00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:11.360]   And so I, as a man, re-knit two different ways that I found that really useful.
[00:54:11.360 --> 00:54:12.360]   Right.
[00:54:12.360 --> 00:54:17.760]   So one was, as you were just talking about being able to better understand other people,
[00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:19.000]   especially women's experience.
[00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:24.800]   And two, just a straight up advice I found really useful because there is not a lot of
[00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:29.240]   advice out there in that space that says, okay, when you're, when you're not just focusing,
[00:54:29.240 --> 00:54:34.400]   focusing exclusively on greatness on a particular goal is like everything.
[00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:36.320]   How do you structure your life?
[00:54:36.320 --> 00:54:37.600]   Like what do you do?
[00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:38.600]   That is a huge void.
[00:54:38.600 --> 00:54:43.560]   I mean, just speaking more like, you know, across all audiences, that's a big void that
[00:54:43.560 --> 00:54:48.080]   they're now is starting to be more of these sort of humanistic productivity books that
[00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:49.080]   are, that are coming at it.
[00:54:49.080 --> 00:54:56.080]   But it's, it is a new thing and it is a huge void for when you're stepping away from, I'm
[00:54:56.080 --> 00:55:01.400]   just all in on like crushing my 10 X business, what you step into.
[00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:04.200]   And I think for a lot of people, a lot of men, when they step, when they, they, it's
[00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:06.960]   not that they even step out of it, they just, it's not going well for them.
[00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:12.880]   It's too easy to fall into various addictions, for example, to just get lost, be it in substances
[00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:16.520]   or be it in, you know, digital distraction or just anger.
[00:55:16.520 --> 00:55:20.480]   And like, it's, it's difficult to, how do you structure an integrated life?
[00:55:20.480 --> 00:55:22.640]   And that space I think is a, is a critical space.
[00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:29.400]   And so I loved it yet the period chapter was a little less relevant to me, but if you are,
[00:55:29.400 --> 00:55:36.640]   if you are around or live with a woman who has a menstrual cycle, it's actually, it makes
[00:55:36.640 --> 00:55:38.040]   you compassionate.
[00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:42.800]   Like my, I call my whole thing, compassionate time management.
[00:55:42.800 --> 00:55:47.200]   I want us to be more compassionate towards ourselves and towards other people, however
[00:55:47.200 --> 00:55:51.500]   they choose to run their lives and spend their time.
[00:55:51.500 --> 00:55:58.120]   We all get to choose, but we just haven't had tools that align with this very different
[00:55:58.120 --> 00:56:03.760]   choice of contentment and integration versus the future and greatness and all of that.
[00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:09.240]   We needed a new lens and that lens is being expanded by a lot of people right now.
[00:56:09.240 --> 00:56:10.560]   And it really is a beautiful thing.
[00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:12.120]   I give our generation credit for that.
[00:56:12.120 --> 00:56:13.720]   Can we, can we take credit for this?
[00:56:13.720 --> 00:56:14.720]   Right.
[00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:20.320]   Can we, can we millennials take, take credit for, I mean, I feel like we are the generation
[00:56:20.320 --> 00:56:21.320]   who figures these things out.
[00:56:21.320 --> 00:56:24.800]   I had this whole gloss before that, like we were the generation that was raised on follow
[00:56:24.800 --> 00:56:30.320]   your passion and then went through the financial crises, 9/11, these various things and realized
[00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:33.200]   like, wait a second, your job's not going to be the source of all of your meaning in
[00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:34.200]   life.
[00:56:34.200 --> 00:56:39.720]   And then we were the ones who got really interested in the 2000s and lifestyle design and life
[00:56:39.720 --> 00:56:44.680]   hacking and trying to figure out like, well, how do we, how do we like rebuild things?
[00:56:44.680 --> 00:56:46.380]   And we're very self-reflective in that way.
[00:56:46.380 --> 00:56:52.840]   So I think it makes sense that our generation is starting to free time management and productivity,
[00:56:52.840 --> 00:56:55.640]   I guess, from the Stephen Covey generation.
[00:56:55.640 --> 00:56:56.960]   I know, I think so.
[00:56:56.960 --> 00:57:01.880]   We're like curious problem solvers on a very soulful human level.
[00:57:01.880 --> 00:57:08.180]   Like, okay, let's, I want to, I think it has, there has to be something to that of not growing
[00:57:08.180 --> 00:57:13.080]   up with technology at your fingertips either, you know, like being skeptical of it.
[00:57:13.080 --> 00:57:19.760]   Like I was taught to like, don't trust Wikipedia, anybody, like all of those things, like, but
[00:57:19.760 --> 00:57:20.760]   I agree with you.
[00:57:20.760 --> 00:57:27.040]   I think there's a, we can make jokes about it, but it is really fulfilling to see this
[00:57:27.040 --> 00:57:34.120]   wave happening where people feel lighter about their own lives in a way they haven't before.
[00:57:34.120 --> 00:57:41.360]   I think our generation having kids change things like I say, this has been my big revelation
[00:57:41.360 --> 00:57:47.640]   was when my three boys all got to basically elementary school age, there was this huge
[00:57:47.640 --> 00:57:54.240]   shift where it was, oh, we need every minute of that time possible, which felt very different
[00:57:54.240 --> 00:58:00.200]   than before, where it's more sort of a survival mode, all hands on deck is this kid like physically
[00:58:00.200 --> 00:58:03.500]   and safely being taken from here to here and has like food or whatever, you know.
[00:58:03.500 --> 00:58:04.500]   It's all logistics.
[00:58:04.500 --> 00:58:05.500]   For a while, it's just logistics.
[00:58:05.500 --> 00:58:06.500]   It's logistics.
[00:58:06.500 --> 00:58:08.680]   And then that very much, I was like three boys, she wants to spend as much time with
[00:58:08.680 --> 00:58:09.680]   that as possible.
[00:58:09.680 --> 00:58:12.480]   And it completely changes the way you think about, for example, work, you're like, okay,
[00:58:12.480 --> 00:58:18.720]   well, so like, how does work serve to help set up a lifestyle that has like as much time
[00:58:18.720 --> 00:58:19.720]   as possible for this?
[00:58:19.720 --> 00:58:21.600]   Because there's like an eight year window or something like that, where that's really
[00:58:21.600 --> 00:58:22.600]   important.
[00:58:22.600 --> 00:58:26.920]   And I think a lot of this, at least for me, is parenthood has been a big driver of these
[00:58:26.920 --> 00:58:31.000]   evolutions, these evolutions of productivity thinking.
[00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:36.440]   And we hit various limits as we, you know, as we get to certain ages, as we get into
[00:58:36.440 --> 00:58:40.880]   our forties, it's like, okay, I kind of am as far as I'm going to be able to go in this
[00:58:40.880 --> 00:58:42.660]   pursuit or that pursuit.
[00:58:42.660 --> 00:58:44.480]   And it turns out I'm not going to play professional baseball.
[00:58:44.480 --> 00:58:45.480]   Okay.
[00:58:45.480 --> 00:58:49.300]   I'm finally able to say like, that ship has sailed, like this is how successful of a person
[00:58:49.300 --> 00:58:52.380]   I'm going to be in my job and I'm, it's good.
[00:58:52.380 --> 00:58:55.320]   I there's, I don't see there being a big jump after this.
[00:58:55.320 --> 00:58:58.460]   There's a big sort of shift, like, okay, so how do we organize life?
[00:58:58.460 --> 00:59:02.640]   It just seems like the right conversation to be having right now.
[00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:03.640]   I agree.
[00:59:03.640 --> 00:59:04.640]   Yeah.
[00:59:04.640 --> 00:59:05.640]   Yeah.
[00:59:05.640 --> 00:59:06.640]   And your book does it beautifully.
[00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:07.640]   Thank you.
[00:59:07.640 --> 00:59:08.640]   Thank you.
[00:59:08.640 --> 00:59:12.640]   It means, it means the world that you read it and are, yeah, talking about it.
[00:59:12.640 --> 00:59:15.280]   And I'm just, I'm excited.
[00:59:15.280 --> 00:59:18.480]   I sometimes call myself Pollyanna with a clipboard.
[00:59:18.480 --> 00:59:23.700]   I'm so idealistic and I'm like everything, you guys, we can make this world so beautiful.
[00:59:23.700 --> 00:59:26.140]   And here's the list of how to do it.
[00:59:26.140 --> 00:59:31.860]   I just feel really excited about this message getting, getting spread out there that people
[00:59:31.860 --> 00:59:38.180]   start to feel like themselves in their own lives rather than machines and something of
[00:59:38.180 --> 00:59:39.180]   their own manufacturing.
[00:59:39.180 --> 00:59:42.460]   That's not the way any of us want to live.
[00:59:42.460 --> 00:59:44.140]   So thanks for giving it a platform.
[00:59:44.140 --> 00:59:45.140]   Of course.
[00:59:45.140 --> 00:59:46.780]   And one of the platforms, we only have a minute left here.
[00:59:46.780 --> 00:59:51.220]   You have a sort of well-known extensive platform online.
[00:59:51.220 --> 00:59:56.060]   Maybe can you help explain for my listeners how to get all things Kendra?
[00:59:56.060 --> 00:59:57.060]   Yeah.
[00:59:57.060 --> 01:00:00.060]   All Things Kendra is at thelazygeniuscollective.com.
[01:00:00.060 --> 01:00:04.100]   I have a podcast, The Lazy Genius Podcast, comes out every Monday.
[01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:07.660]   We're coming up on 400 episodes, so that's, we've been doing this a long time.
[01:00:07.660 --> 01:00:09.740]   And yeah, The Plan is my third book.
[01:00:09.740 --> 01:00:14.580]   The first two, The Lazy Genius Way and The Lazy Genius Kitchen are, you know, kind of
[01:00:14.580 --> 01:00:15.580]   foundational books.
[01:00:15.580 --> 01:00:21.240]   I reference a lot in the episodes, but everything is meant to help you name what matters to
[01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:26.340]   you and feel permission to live your life in a way that makes you feel like a person.
[01:00:26.340 --> 01:00:27.340]   Okay.
[01:00:27.340 --> 01:00:28.340]   So go to that website, go to that podcast.
[01:00:28.340 --> 01:00:32.300]   You have a great newsletter, big Instagram presence as well.
[01:00:32.300 --> 01:00:33.300]   Yeah.
[01:00:33.300 --> 01:00:34.300]   Yeah.
[01:00:34.300 --> 01:00:35.300]   Or so I hear.
[01:00:35.300 --> 01:00:38.660]   It's like, it's big-ish and I'm not there very often to make it bigger because I just
[01:00:38.660 --> 01:00:40.900]   choose to be lazy about Instagram and that's okay.
[01:00:40.900 --> 01:00:41.900]   I like it.
[01:00:41.900 --> 01:00:42.900]   Yeah.
[01:00:42.900 --> 01:00:43.900]   Yeah.
[01:00:43.900 --> 01:00:44.900]   Okay.
[01:00:44.900 --> 01:00:45.900]   All right, Kendra.
[01:00:45.900 --> 01:00:47.740]   Well, always a pleasure to talk with you.
[01:00:47.740 --> 01:00:48.740]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:00:48.740 --> 01:00:49.740]   Thanks for helping to share the word.
[01:00:49.740 --> 01:00:50.900]   The book is The Plan.
[01:00:50.900 --> 01:00:54.420]   Check out The Lazy Genius Collective as well to find out more.
[01:00:54.420 --> 01:00:56.260]   And thanks for coming on.
[01:00:56.260 --> 01:00:57.260]   Thanks Cal.
[01:00:57.260 --> 01:00:58.260]   All right.
[01:00:58.260 --> 01:01:04.500]   So that was my interview with Kendra Adachi, brought to you by Defender, a vehicle designed
[01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:06.780]   for those seeking adventure in a distracted world.
[01:01:06.780 --> 01:01:08.860]   So thank you Defender for sponsoring today's interview.
[01:01:08.860 --> 01:01:10.820]   Well, I really liked that discussion.
[01:01:10.820 --> 01:01:13.300]   We covered a lot of ground.
[01:01:13.300 --> 01:01:15.780]   There's one point in particular that I want to underscore here.
[01:01:15.780 --> 01:01:23.500]   I really liked early on in the interview where Kendra set up this dichotomy, which she says
[01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:28.700]   is very common in the communities and spaces where she often exists.
[01:01:28.700 --> 01:01:32.820]   And she says there's often this dichotomy, especially among women in productivity discourse,
[01:01:32.820 --> 01:01:35.360]   where you have two choices.
[01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:41.820]   You can be the super achiever, your eating year, whatever they ask for you to do now,
[01:01:41.820 --> 01:01:48.180]   eating grams of protein an hour while working out two hours a day at the gym and crushing
[01:01:48.180 --> 01:01:54.820]   it with your Instagram photos and working 50 hours a day and all this sort of craziness.
[01:01:54.820 --> 01:01:59.620]   Or you have to be, and I believe her term was something like, have the wild hair energy,
[01:01:59.620 --> 01:02:02.540]   the messy hair energy, which is you have to lean into.
[01:02:02.540 --> 01:02:06.380]   Your only other option is to lean into, oh my God, look how messy my life is and my act
[01:02:06.380 --> 01:02:07.380]   isn't together.
[01:02:07.740 --> 01:02:12.460]   You know, this is just how it is.
[01:02:12.460 --> 01:02:13.460]   Everything is completely chaotic.
[01:02:13.460 --> 01:02:15.540]   And she's saying it doesn't have to be either of those things.
[01:02:15.540 --> 01:02:18.340]   Neither of those are very good options.
[01:02:18.340 --> 01:02:22.340]   But there's an option in the middle, and I think we often forget this option because
[01:02:22.340 --> 01:02:29.260]   that first option, the sort of super achiever option for all of us, when it becomes unattainable,
[01:02:29.260 --> 01:02:31.320]   we know we need to do something different.
[01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:37.340]   But if our only other option is just let everything go to chaos, that's just as bad.
[01:02:37.340 --> 01:02:42.500]   So I think of compassionate time management as one way of describing an approach to that
[01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:44.940]   space in between.
[01:02:44.940 --> 01:02:50.140]   It's a way of saying, yeah, you got to care about things, you need to plan your to-do
[01:02:50.140 --> 01:02:54.740]   list, you need to look ahead of what's coming up, you need to make decisions and pivot when
[01:02:54.740 --> 01:02:58.140]   something doesn't work and make priority decisions about what should I do instead and how are
[01:02:58.140 --> 01:02:59.140]   we going to pull this off.
[01:02:59.140 --> 01:03:03.440]   And if this kid's going to be homesick for school, there's a complicated logistical chain
[01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:06.980]   that makes the rescue of the Apollo 13 capsule seem somewhat simplistic by comparison.
[01:03:06.980 --> 01:03:09.400]   I got to get on the ball, I got to make this happen.
[01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:13.780]   You need to do those things, but also have compassion for yourself, not try to do too
[01:03:13.780 --> 01:03:16.020]   many of those things.
[01:03:16.020 --> 01:03:19.620]   Recognize that some seasons of life, it's just this is what's going on, is trying to
[01:03:19.620 --> 01:03:23.120]   keep up with details, and other seasons of life, you have some freedom to actually push
[01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:28.140]   on something or to push harder on an optional project, and that can shift over time, and
[01:03:28.140 --> 01:03:29.140]   that's okay.
[01:03:29.140 --> 01:03:30.140]   And then things can go slower.
[01:03:30.140 --> 01:03:33.340]   I talk about this in my book, Slow Productivity, work at a natural pace.
[01:03:33.340 --> 01:03:36.820]   We don't know, looking back historically, when we see people who did great things, we
[01:03:36.820 --> 01:03:41.020]   don't know how long it took them, and if they took twice as long or half as long, we wouldn't
[01:03:41.020 --> 01:03:42.020]   know the difference.
[01:03:42.020 --> 01:03:45.700]   We would just say that was a cool book you wrote, it was a cool impact you had, so be
[01:03:45.700 --> 01:03:50.260]   able to let things take more time, to be lazy about more things so you can be a genius on
[01:03:50.260 --> 01:03:54.980]   other, to not have to be the very best at X, Y, and Z, but to be good at something that
[01:03:54.980 --> 01:03:58.900]   matters on your own terms, and that's good enough.
[01:03:58.900 --> 01:04:04.500]   That middle space between the messy hair energy and the superachiever is a space that we don't
[01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:05.500]   explore enough.
[01:04:05.500 --> 01:04:12.020]   I'm going to explore that more with my deep life philosophy, by saying the goal is a lifestyle,
[01:04:12.020 --> 01:04:15.980]   not a grand accomplishment, not a specific thing you can point to and impress other people
[01:04:15.980 --> 01:04:19.740]   by, not a particular number in your bank account, but a holistic view of your lifestyle, opens
[01:04:19.740 --> 01:04:21.460]   up a lot of freedom for how you get there.
[01:04:21.460 --> 01:04:25.580]   And in particular, if a particular path you're taking is not working well, it's stressing
[01:04:25.580 --> 01:04:28.180]   you out, it's unsustainable, you can switch to something else.
[01:04:28.180 --> 01:04:29.380]   You can give yourself that grace.
[01:04:29.380 --> 01:04:31.060]   So I really love this type of thinking.
[01:04:31.060 --> 01:04:38.340]   I have been using the term humanistic or humane productivity in some of my recent conversations.
[01:04:38.340 --> 01:04:41.060]   Kendra has this idea of compassionate time management.
[01:04:41.060 --> 01:04:43.260]   We have Oliver Berkman is in on this space, too.
[01:04:43.260 --> 01:04:45.580]   He's kind of approaching this space from a related direction.
[01:04:45.580 --> 01:04:49.740]   I guess Oliver is saying something sort of similar to Kendra, at least in the part of
[01:04:49.740 --> 01:04:54.980]   be organized enough to make progress on the thing that matters and not to let too many
[01:04:54.980 --> 01:05:01.200]   things fall through the cracks and then be okay with that, not having to optimize everything
[01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:02.200]   else.
[01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:03.200]   Enough.
[01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:04.420]   You got enough time towards something.
[01:05:04.420 --> 01:05:05.700]   You have your arms around enough things.
[01:05:05.700 --> 01:05:10.860]   I think Oliver, I think Kendra, I think me, we're all kind of surrounding similar topics.
[01:05:10.860 --> 01:05:11.860]   And it's a great one.
[01:05:11.860 --> 01:05:16.020]   So Kendra added a great voice to this conversation.
[01:05:16.020 --> 01:05:17.700]   And so I was glad to have her on the show.
[01:05:17.700 --> 01:05:18.700]   So thank you for that, Kendra.
[01:05:18.700 --> 01:05:22.420]   We'll have another one of these episodes coming up pretty soon, you know, again, semi-regular.
[01:05:22.420 --> 01:05:25.260]   I do these as I have interesting people to talk to.
[01:05:25.260 --> 01:05:28.460]   And there's a person I've wanted to talk to who agreed to talk to me recently.
[01:05:28.460 --> 01:05:29.460]   No spoilers.
[01:05:29.460 --> 01:05:33.220]   I'm going to try to get that up, you know, maybe in a couple of weeks or so.
[01:05:33.220 --> 01:05:34.220]   And we'll continue.
[01:05:34.220 --> 01:05:36.140]   Do you have any feedback about the show?
[01:05:36.140 --> 01:05:38.920]   Your best bets to send that to producer Jesse at jesse@calnewport.com.
[01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:41.260]   He makes sure I see what I need to see.
[01:05:41.260 --> 01:05:44.660]   Be back on Monday, of course, with our normal episode of the show.
[01:05:44.660 --> 01:05:47.340]   Until then, stay deep.
[01:05:47.340 --> 01:05:51.740]   Hey, if you like this video, I think you'll really like this one as well.
