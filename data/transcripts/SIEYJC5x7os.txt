[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.680]   Knowing that anything is possible, anything is possible.
[00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:06.780]   It's like your mom said, when you were a little kid, you can do anything if you try.
[00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:07.740]   It's totally true.
[00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.120]   You can make millions in real estate.
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.120]   You could build a tech company.
[00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.960]   You could be a digital nomad and live on points and 500 bucks a month or whatever.
[00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.120]   You could do whatever you want.
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.580]   Start with the feeling of life you want to have.
[00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:18.840]   Define your ideal day.
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:19.600]   I love that practice.
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.900]   We're just like, what does the ideal perfect day look like?
[00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.300]   And then jot that down.
[00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.720]   And now, you know, where you're headed.
[00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.120]   Now you can find the strategy that's going to get you there.
[00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.000]   But the mindset of this, like I want an ideal life and an ideal life is possible
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.680]   for me, so I'm going to pursue it with every ounce of my being.
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.900]   And almost everybody I know who is incredibly happy and incredibly
[00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.000]   successful, not just from money, but from anything.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.660]   People I know who have an amazing marriage, it's because they know that
[00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.640]   having an amazing marriage is possible and they work for it and they fight for
[00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.420]   it because they know it's possible.
[00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.480]   And so that's the thing I think a lot of people in general miss is they never
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.480]   take time to envision what's possible.
[00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.700]   And they just do whatever in front of them.
