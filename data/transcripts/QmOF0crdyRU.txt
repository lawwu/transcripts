[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.480]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.320]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.380]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.160]   Today, we are going to talk all about dopamine
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.160]   and what drives you to do the things that you do.
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.480]   We're going to talk about motivation and desire and craving,
[00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.160]   but also how dopamine relates to satisfaction
[00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.040]   and our feelings of wellbeing.
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.580]   And of course, any discussion about dopamine
[00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.300]   has to include a discussion about the potential
[00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.440]   for dopamine-induced addiction.
[00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.000]   Indeed, dopamine lies at the heart of addiction
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.960]   to all things, but today we are mainly going to focus on
[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.320]   how what we do and how we do it
[00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.160]   and how we conceptualize those things
[00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.200]   leads to changes in this amazing molecule
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.160]   in our brain and bodies that we call dopamine.
[00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.640]   I'm going to teach you what dopamine is and what it is not.
[00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.000]   There are a lot of myths about the molecule dopamine.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.560]   We often hear about so-called dopamine hits.
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.060]   Today, we are going to dispel
[00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.980]   many common myths about dopamine,
[00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.180]   and we are going to talk about how dopamine actually works.
[00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.760]   We're going to discuss the biology of dopamine,
[00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.640]   the psychology, we will discuss some neural circuits,
[00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.600]   and a really exciting aspect of dopamine biology
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.880]   are so-called dopamine schedules.
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.280]   In other words, we are going to discuss
[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.920]   how things like food, drugs, caffeine, pornography,
[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.000]   even some plant-based compounds
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.880]   can change our baseline levels of dopamine,
[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.300]   and in doing so, they change how much dopamine
[00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.680]   we are capable of experiencing
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.040]   from what could be very satisfying events
[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.180]   or events that make us feel not so good
[00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.060]   because of things that we did or took prior.
[00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.800]   So I promise you it's going to be a vast discussion,
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.320]   but I will structure it for you,
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.580]   and you'll come away with a deep understanding
[00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.080]   of really what drives you.
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.520]   You will also come away with a lot of tools,
[00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.480]   how to leverage dopamine
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.280]   so that you can sustain energy, drive, and motivation
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.680]   for the things that are important to you
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.680]   over long periods of time.
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.720]   Before we dive into the meat of today's discussion,
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.200]   I'd like to share with you a fascinating result
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.040]   that really underscores what dopamine is capable of
[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.100]   in our brains and bodies and underscores the fact
[00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.860]   that just through behaviors, no drugs, nothing of that sort,
[00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.560]   just through behaviors, we can achieve terrifically high
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.080]   increases in dopamine that are very long
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.200]   and sustained in ways that serve us.
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.420]   This is a result that was published
[00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.500]   in the European Journal of Physiology.
[00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.120]   I'll go into it in more detail later,
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.720]   but essentially what it involved is having human subjects
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.880]   get into water of different temperatures.
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.280]   So it was warm water, moderately cool water,
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.200]   and cold, cold water.
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.120]   Had them stay in that water for up to an hour,
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.000]   and they measured, by way of blood draw,
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.320]   things like cortisol, norepinephrine, and dopamine.
[00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:03.540]   What was fascinating is that cold water exposure
[00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.360]   led to very rapid increases in norepinephrine and epinephrine,
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.680]   which is also just called adrenaline.
[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.460]   It also led to increases in dopamine,
[00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:16.840]   and these increases in dopamine were very significant.
[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.380]   They kicked in around 10 or 15 minutes
[00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.420]   after submersion into the cold water,
[00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.100]   and I should mention the head wasn't below water,
[00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.860]   it was just up to the neck,
[00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.500]   and the dopamine release continued to rise
[00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.400]   and rise and rise and eventually reached
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.800]   250% above baseline.
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.880]   Now, what was interesting is after subjects got out
[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.940]   of this cold water, that dopamine increase was sustained,
[00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.980]   and I know nowadays many people are interested
[00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.460]   in using cold water therapy as a way
[00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:48.260]   to increase metabolism and fat loss,
[00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.400]   but also to improve sense of wellbeing,
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.600]   improve cognition, improve clarity of mind.
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.100]   You know, there's something really special
[00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.280]   about this very alert but calm state of mind
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.460]   that seems to be the one that's optimal
[00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:03.980]   for pretty much everything except sleep,
[00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.620]   but for all aspects of work and for social engagement
[00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.000]   and for sport, that highly alert but calm state of mind
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.460]   really is the sweet spot that I believe most of us
[00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:17.180]   would like to achieve, and this cold water exposure,
[00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.900]   done correctly, really can help people achieve
[00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.300]   that state of mind through these increases in dopamine
[00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.100]   that last a very long time.
[00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.440]   So I will later detail the specifics of that study,
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.860]   what it entailed in terms of how long the variations
[00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.700]   that different subjects experienced,
[00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.300]   as well as how to limit the amount of stress hormone,
[00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.180]   cortisol, that's released as a consequence of the cold water
[00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.980]   and we will also talk about compounds,
[00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.100]   supplements that people can take in order
[00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.500]   to increase their levels of dopamine should they choose.
[00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.960]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.820]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.060]   It is however, part of my desire and effort
[00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.860]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.580]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:01.740]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.660]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:06.600]   Our first sponsor is Roca.
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.700]   Roca makes sunglasses and eyeglasses
[00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.260]   that are of the absolute highest quality.
[00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.620]   I've spent a lifetime working on the visual system
[00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:14.860]   and I can tell you that the visual system
[00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.580]   has to go through a lot of work in order to maintain clarity
[00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.140]   of what you see when there are shadows,
[00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:22.020]   when you go into different types of indoor lighting
[00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.460]   and so on and a lot of glasses don't work well
[00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.660]   because you put them on and then you're in bright light
[00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.420]   and you can see fine, but then you move into a shadow
[00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:31.420]   and then you have to take them off and they don't adjust
[00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:33.180]   or they don't adjust quickly enough.
[00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.120]   With Roca, their eyeglasses and sunglasses are designed
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.760]   with the visual system biology in mind.
[00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.680]   So you always see things with perfect clarity.
[00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.000]   The glasses are also terrific
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.340]   because they're very lightweight
[00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:45.680]   and they won't slip off your face if you're exercising,
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:46.700]   if you're running or biking.
[00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.420]   In fact, they were designed for the purpose
[00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:50.820]   of being able to be worn while you're engaging
[00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.820]   in those sorts of activities or simply working at your desk.
[00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:56.860]   I happen to wear readers at night when I drive
[00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.200]   or when I work and I love their sunglasses
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.180]   'cause I can wear them anywhere and also the aesthetics
[00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.300]   of their sunglasses and eyeglasses are terrific.
[00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.160]   Unlike a lot of other performance glasses
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.580]   that frankly make people look like cyborgs,
[00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.380]   the aesthetics on Roca's are really terrific.
[00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:12.580]   You could wear them anywhere you'd like to go.
[00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.100]   If you'd like to try Roca glasses,
[00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:17.540]   you can go to roca.com, that's R-O-K-A.com

[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:25.460]   at checkout.
[00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.940]   Today's podcast is also brought to us by Inside Tracker.
[00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:31.340]   Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:33.740]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:35.780]   to help you better understand your body
[00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:37.700]   and help you reach your health goals.
[00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:40.780]   I'm a big believer in getting regular blood work done.
[00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:43.020]   And now with the advent of modern DNA tests,
[00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:46.100]   you can also analyze your DNA to see what you ought
[00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:49.320]   to be doing for your immediate and long-term health.
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.180]   We hear a lot these days about optimization,
[00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:53.360]   optimizing hormones, optimizing your metabolism,
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:54.820]   optimizing this, optimizing that.
[00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:57.860]   But unless you know the measurements of metabolic factors,
[00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:01.340]   hormones, and other things that are in your blood and DNA,
[00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:03.120]   you don't know what to optimize.
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:05.900]   With Inside Tracker, it makes all of that very easy.
[00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:08.140]   They can come to your house to take the blood and DNA test,
[00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:10.220]   or you can go to a nearby clinic.
[00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:13.060]   They send you the information and you take those results.
[00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:16.300]   And unlike a lot of laboratories doing blood work out there
[00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:18.580]   and DNA tests, they have a simple platform,
[00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:21.540]   a dashboard that walks you through your results
[00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:23.940]   and helps you identify what sorts of nutritional
[00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:26.300]   or behavioral or other types of practices
[00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:28.020]   you might want to incorporate into your life
[00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:30.540]   in order to positively impact your immediate
[00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:31.900]   and long-term health.
[00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:33.580]   It's a very easy system to use,
[00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:35.160]   and you will gain a ton of information
[00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:36.340]   simply by doing that test,
[00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:37.740]   whether or not you end up making changes
[00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:39.500]   to what you're doing or not.
[00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:41.320]   If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,
[00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:44.340]   you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman
[00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:47.320]   to get 25% off any of Inside Tracker's plans.

[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.780]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Headspace.
[00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:56.220]   Headspace is a meditation app backed by 25 published studies
[00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:59.500]   and has over 600,000 five-star reviews.
[00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:02.300]   I've been meditating for a long time, but I confess,
[00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:05.440]   sometimes I meditate and sometimes I am very inconsistent
[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:06.980]   about my meditation.
[00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:10.500]   Ideally, I would meditate every day for 20 or 30 minutes,
[00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:12.600]   but what I found over the years is that
[00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.100]   I'll start a meditation practice,
[00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:17.600]   and then as life gets more stressful or busier,
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.660]   which is exactly when I need to meditate more,
[00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:21.980]   I tend to meditate less often.
[00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:24.100]   Switching over to Headspace as a meditation app
[00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:25.700]   really helped me stay consistent
[00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:27.260]   with my meditation practice.
[00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.300]   And that's because they have a huge range of meditations
[00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:31.160]   to select from.
[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.180]   Some are short, some are longer.
[00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:36.160]   And in general, I try and get 20 minutes of meditation
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:38.280]   in every day, but some days it's just five minutes
[00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:40.900]   and they have some terrific just five-minute meditations.
[00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:43.540]   The science says that even a five-minute meditation
[00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:45.660]   can be beneficial for different aspects
[00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:47.740]   of our brain and body.
[00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:48.820]   If you want to try Headspace,

[00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:12.360]   I'd like to announce that there's an event
[00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:14.700]   that some of you may find very useful.
[00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:16.700]   This is an event put on by Logitech
[00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:18.380]   that I will be speaking at.
[00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:22.160]   It's called Rethink Education, The Biology of Learning,
[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.320]   Reimagining Learning Through Neuroscience.
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.180]   And at this event, I will be speaking,
[00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:27.780]   there will be other speakers as well.
[00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:30.100]   And I will be talking about neuroplasticity
[00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:33.140]   and its applications for teaching and for learning.
[00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:36.000]   I will describe what I call the plasticity super protocol
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.820]   that incorporates all of what we know about rapid learning,
[00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:42.860]   efficient learning, and the best ways to teach and learn.
[00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:45.140]   It's geared towards educators of all kinds.
[00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:46.620]   It is zero cost.
[00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:48.460]   So please feel free to sign up.
[00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:53.460]   The event is September 30th, 2021 at 3 p.m. Eastern.
[00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:56.000]   You can find the registration link
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.260]   in the caption for this episode.
[00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.000]   So let's talk about dopamine.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.560]   Most people have heard of dopamine
[00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:04.260]   and we hear all the time now about dopamine hits,
[00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:08.260]   but actually there's no such thing as a dopamine hit.
[00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:12.220]   And actually the way that your body uses dopamine
[00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:15.540]   is to have a baseline level of dopamine,
[00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:17.120]   meaning an amount of dopamine
[00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:20.340]   that's circulating in your brain and body all the time.
[00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:21.840]   And that turns out to be important
[00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:23.560]   for how you feel generally,
[00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:26.760]   whether or not you're in a good mood, motivated, et cetera.
[00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:29.080]   And you also can experience peaks
[00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:31.500]   in dopamine above baseline.
[00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:35.280]   This has a very specific name in the neurobiology literature,
[00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:39.380]   so-called tonic and phasic release of dopamine.
[00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:41.420]   And I'll explain what that means in a couple of minutes.
[00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:44.380]   But if you remember nothing else from this episode,
[00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:48.380]   please remember this, that when you experience something
[00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:51.740]   or you crave something really desirable,
[00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:54.300]   really exciting to you, very pleasurable,
[00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:58.380]   what happens afterwards is your baseline level
[00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:00.740]   of dopamine drops, okay?
[00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:03.320]   So these peaks in dopamine,
[00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:05.100]   they influence how much dopamine
[00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:07.380]   will generally be circulating afterward.
[00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:09.340]   And you might think, oh, a big peak in dopamine,
[00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:11.340]   after that, I'm going to feel even better
[00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:13.380]   because I just had this great event.
[00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:14.340]   Not the case.
[00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:16.980]   What actually happens is that your baseline level
[00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:18.220]   of dopamine drops.
[00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:21.340]   And I will explain the precise mechanism for that, okay?
[00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:23.340]   In the neuroscience literature,
[00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:28.340]   we refer to this as tonic and phasic release of dopamine.
[00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:32.240]   Tonic being the low level baseline
[00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:34.920]   that's always there circulating,
[00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:37.220]   released into your brain all the time.
[00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:41.440]   And then phasic, these peaks that ride above that baseline.
[00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:43.160]   And those two things interact.
[00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:44.940]   And this is really important.
[00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:46.500]   I'm going to teach you the underlying neurobiology,
[00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:48.420]   but even if you have no background in biology,
[00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:49.660]   I promise to make it all clear.
[00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:52.020]   I'll explain the terms and what they mean.
[00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:54.220]   And I'm excited to teach you about dopamine
[00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:56.340]   because dopamine has everything to do
[00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:59.100]   with how you feel right now as you're listening to this.
[00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:01.300]   It has everything to do with how you will feel
[00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:03.320]   an hour from now has everything to do
[00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:06.320]   with your level of motivation and your level of desire
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:08.860]   and your willingness to push through effort.
[00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:10.880]   If ever you've interacted with somebody
[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:14.640]   who just doesn't seem to have any drive they've given up,
[00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:16.120]   or if you've interacted with somebody
[00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:18.880]   who seems to have endless drive and energy,
[00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:22.020]   what you are looking at there in those two circumstances
[00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:26.020]   is without question a difference in the level
[00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:28.920]   of dopamine circulating in their system.
[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:30.840]   There will be other factors too,
[00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:34.820]   but the level of dopamine is the primary determinant
[00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:37.900]   of how motivated we are, how excited we are,
[00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:40.600]   how outward facing we are and how willing we are
[00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:43.140]   to lean into life and pursue things.
[00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:45.500]   Dopamine is what we call a neuromodulator.
[00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:48.060]   Neuromodulators are different than neurotransmitters.
[00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:50.600]   Neurotransmitters are involved in the dialogue
[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:52.680]   between neurons, nerve cells,
[00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:56.260]   and neurotransmitters tend to mediate local communication.
[00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:57.980]   Just imagine two people talking to one another
[00:12:57.980 --> 00:12:59.220]   at a concert.
[00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:01.820]   That communication between them is analogous
[00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:05.120]   to the communication carried out by neurotransmitters,
[00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:08.560]   whereas neuromodulators influence the communication
[00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:09.600]   of many neurons.
[00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:11.220]   Imagine a bunch of people dancing
[00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:13.720]   where it's a coordinated dance involving 10 or 20
[00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:15.480]   or hundreds of people.
[00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:18.420]   Neuromodulators are coordinating that dance.
[00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:19.940]   In the nervous system what this means
[00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:23.240]   is that dopamine release changes the probability
[00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:25.340]   that certain neural circuits will be active
[00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:29.880]   and that other neural circuits will be inactive, okay?
[00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:33.020]   So it modulates a bunch of things all at once.
[00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:34.160]   And that's why it's so powerful.
[00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:36.240]   It's shifting not just our levels of energy,
[00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:39.760]   but also our mindset, also our feelings
[00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:44.360]   of whether or not we can or cannot accomplish something.
[00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:46.720]   So how does dopamine work and what does it do?
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:50.100]   Well, first of all, it is not just responsible for pleasure.
[00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:53.240]   It is responsible for motivation and drive primarily
[00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:54.520]   at the psychological level.
[00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:57.560]   Also for craving, those three things are sort of the same,
[00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:59.200]   motivation, drive, and craving.
[00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:01.160]   It also controls time perception.
[00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:03.920]   And we will get deep into how dopamine
[00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:07.600]   can modulate time perception and how important it is
[00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:12.040]   that everybody be able to access increases in dopamine
[00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:13.480]   at different timescales.
[00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:14.720]   This turns out to be important
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:16.720]   to not end up addicted to substances,
[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:19.000]   but it also turns out to be very important
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.120]   to sustain effort and be a happy person
[00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:22.400]   over long periods of time,
[00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:24.680]   which I think most everybody wants.
[00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:27.880]   It certainly is adaptive in life to be able to do that.
[00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:31.260]   Dopamine is also vitally important for movement.
[00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:35.000]   I'll explain the neural circuits for dopamine and mindset
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.540]   and dopamine and movement in a moment,
[00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:42.540]   but in diseases like Parkinson's or Louie's body's dementia,
[00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:45.780]   which is similar to Parkinson's in many ways,
[00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:48.240]   there's a depletion or death of dopamine neurons
[00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:50.160]   at a particular location in the brain,
[00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:54.400]   which leads to shaky movements, challenges in speaking,
[00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:57.580]   challenges in particular in initiating movement.
[00:14:57.580 --> 00:15:01.620]   And because dopamine is depleted elsewhere too,
[00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:03.960]   people with Parkinson's and Louie's,
[00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:07.300]   excuse me, Louie body dementia also experience drops
[00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:10.140]   in motivation and affect, meaning mood.
[00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:12.800]   They tend to get depressed and so on.
[00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:15.380]   When those people are properly treated,
[00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:17.300]   they can, not always,
[00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:20.360]   but they can recover some fluidity of movement,
[00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:22.120]   some ability to initiate movement.
[00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:23.980]   And almost without question,
[00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:26.820]   those people feel better psychologically,
[00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:28.020]   not just because they can move,
[00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:31.640]   but also because dopamine impacts mood and motivation.
[00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:35.400]   So what are the underlying neural circuits?
[00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:38.020]   For those of you that are not interested in biology
[00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:40.860]   and specific nomenclature, you can tune out now if you want,
[00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:42.600]   but it's actually pretty straightforward.
[00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:45.580]   You have two main neural circuits in the brain
[00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:50.580]   that dopamine uses in order to exert all its effects.
[00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:54.540]   The first one is a pathway that goes from this area
[00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:56.820]   in the what's called the ventral tegmentum.
[00:15:56.820 --> 00:15:58.940]   That's a fancy, but ventral just means bottom
[00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:01.060]   and tegmentum actually means floor.
[00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:02.860]   So it's at the bottom of the brain
[00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:04.540]   and it's the ventral part of the floor.
[00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:06.300]   So it's really low in the back of the brain,
[00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:07.780]   the ventral tegmentum,
[00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:11.540]   and it goes from the ventral tegmentum
[00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:14.100]   to what's called the ventral striatum
[00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:15.340]   and the prefrontal cortex.
[00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:16.500]   Now that's a lot of language,
[00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:17.820]   but basically what we call this
[00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:20.260]   is the mesocorticolimbic pathway.
[00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:24.400]   This is the pathway by which dopamine influences
[00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:27.220]   motivation, drive, and craving.
[00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:28.720]   It involves structures that some of you
[00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:29.640]   may have heard of before,
[00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:32.900]   things like nucleus accumbens and the prefrontal cortex.
[00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:35.620]   This is the pathway that really gets disrupted
[00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:39.300]   in addictions where in particular drugs
[00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:41.180]   that influence the release of dopamine
[00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:42.580]   like cocaine and methamphetamine,
[00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:44.060]   we'll talk about those drugs today,
[00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:45.580]   they tap into this pathway.
[00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:49.460]   But if you are pursuing a partner,
[00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:50.420]   a boyfriend or girlfriend,
[00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:52.400]   if you're pursuing a degree in school,
[00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:54.780]   if you're pursuing a finish line in a race,
[00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:56.260]   you are tapping into this so-called
[00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:58.340]   mesocorticolimbic pathway.
[00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:03.340]   This is the classic reward pathway in all mammals.
[00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:06.820]   The other pathway emerges from an area in the brain
[00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:08.660]   called the substantia nigra,
[00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:13.560]   so-called because the cells in that area are dark
[00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:17.060]   and the substantia nigra connects to an area of the brain
[00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:18.420]   called the dorsal striatum.
[00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:22.480]   This is not surprisingly called the nigrostriatal pathway.
[00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:24.460]   For those of you who have never done any neuroanatomy,
[00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:26.340]   I'm going to teach you a little trick right now.
[00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:27.720]   Everything in neuroanatomy,
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:32.420]   the first part of a word tells you where the neurons are.
[00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:33.580]   And then the second part tells you
[00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:34.760]   where they are connecting to.
[00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:37.300]   So when I say nigrostriatal pathway,
[00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:39.340]   it means that the neurons are in the substantia nigra
[00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:42.520]   and they connect to the striatum, nigrostriatal pathway.
[00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:46.240]   So while it's a lot of language, there is some logic there.
[00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:47.660]   So we've got these two pathways,
[00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:49.860]   one mainly for movement.
[00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:53.020]   This is the substantia nigra to dorsal striatum.
[00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:55.620]   And we've got this other pathway,
[00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:57.280]   the so-called mesocorticolimbic pathway
[00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:59.920]   that's for reward reinforcement and motivation.
[00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:03.740]   I want you to remember that there are two pathways.
[00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:05.940]   If you don't remember the two pathways in detail,
[00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:08.740]   that's fine, but please remember that there are two pathways
[00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:10.600]   because that turns out to be important later.
[00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:12.700]   Now, the other thing to understand about dopamine
[00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:16.180]   is that the way that dopamine is released
[00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:19.460]   in the brain and body can differ,
[00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:24.460]   meaning it can be very local or it can be more broad.
[00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:27.460]   Now, most of you have probably heard of synapses.
[00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:30.620]   Synapses are the little spaces between neurons
[00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:32.220]   and basically neurons, nerve cells
[00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:33.860]   communicate with one another
[00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:36.280]   by making each other electrically active
[00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:39.780]   or by making each other less electrically active.
[00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:40.620]   So here's how this works.
[00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:43.080]   You can imagine one nerve cell and another nerve cell
[00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:45.660]   with a little gap between them, a little synapse.
[00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:47.760]   And the way that one nerve cell
[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:49.880]   causes the next nerve cell to fire,
[00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:52.600]   what we call fire really means to become electrically active
[00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:55.500]   is that it vomits out these little packets,
[00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:56.440]   what we call vesicles.
[00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:58.880]   They're little bubbles filled with a chemical.
[00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:01.720]   When that chemical enters the synapse,
[00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:04.940]   some of it docks or parks on the other side
[00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:06.320]   in the other neuron.
[00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:10.140]   And by virtue of electrical changes in the,
[00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:12.400]   what we call the postsynaptic neuron,
[00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:14.460]   that chemical will make that neuron
[00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:17.540]   more electrically active or less electrically active.
[00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:20.960]   Dopamine can do that like any other neurotransmitter
[00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:22.440]   or neuromodulator.
[00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:25.960]   So it can have one neuron influence another neuron,
[00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:28.240]   but dopamine can also engage
[00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:30.460]   in what's called a volumetric release.
[00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:33.580]   Volumetric release is like a giant vomit
[00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:37.820]   that gets out to 50 or a hundred or even thousands of cells.
[00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:40.480]   So there's local release, what we call synaptic release,
[00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:41.960]   and then there's volumetric release.
[00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:44.720]   So volumetric release is like dumping all this dopamine
[00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:46.260]   out into the system.
[00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:50.180]   So dopamine is incredible because it can change the way
[00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:52.860]   that our neural circuits work at a local scale
[00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:54.780]   and at a very broad scale.
[00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:57.280]   And for those of you that are only interested in tools,
[00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:59.120]   like how do I get more dopamine?
[00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:01.740]   Let me tell you, this part is really important
[00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:05.600]   because if you were to take a drug or supplement
[00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:07.560]   that increases your level of dopamine,
[00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:11.700]   you are influencing both the local release of dopamine
[00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:13.840]   and volumetric release.
[00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:16.160]   This relates back to the baseline of dopamine
[00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:18.920]   and the big peak above baseline.
[00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:20.480]   And that turns out to be important.
[00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:23.200]   And I'll just allude to why it's important.
[00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:28.200]   Many drugs and indeed many supplements that increase dopamine
[00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:32.300]   will actually make it harder for you to sustain
[00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:34.780]   dopamine release over long periods of time
[00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:37.960]   and to achieve those peaks that most of us are craving
[00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:39.680]   when we are in pursuit of things.
[00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:40.640]   Why?
[00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:43.540]   Because if you get both volumetric release,
[00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:45.340]   the dumping out of dopamine everywhere,
[00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:47.220]   and you're getting local release,
[00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:49.540]   what it means is that the difference between the peak
[00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:52.820]   and baseline is likely to be smaller.
[00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:57.820]   And this is very important, how satisfying or exciting
[00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:00.700]   or pleasureful a given experience is
[00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:03.880]   doesn't just depend on the height of that peak.
[00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:05.840]   It depends on the height of that peak
[00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:08.060]   relative to the baseline.
[00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:12.360]   So if you increase the baseline and you increase the peak,
[00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:14.080]   you're not going to achieve more
[00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:15.760]   and more pleasure from things.
[00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:18.840]   I'll talk about how to leverage this information
[00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:22.800]   in a little bit, but just increasing your dopamine,
[00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:25.220]   yes, it will make you excited for all things.
[00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:26.960]   It will make you feel very motivated,
[00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:31.240]   but it will also make that motivation very short lived.
[00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:34.700]   So there's a better way to increase your dopamine.
[00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:36.260]   There's a better way to optimize
[00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:38.260]   this peak to baseline ratio.
[00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:39.420]   For now, what we've talked about
[00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:42.020]   is two main neural circuits, one for movement
[00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:45.040]   and one for motivation and craving with dopamine.
[00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:47.880]   And we've talked about two main modes of communication
[00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:50.460]   between neurons with dopamine.
[00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:52.920]   One is this local synaptic release.
[00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:56.500]   One is more volumetric release.
[00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:57.600]   And in the back of your mind,
[00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:59.200]   you can relate this back to again,
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:02.240]   this baseline versus peaks above baseline.
[00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:04.000]   So that's a description of what we would call
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.920]   the spatial effects or the spatial aspects of dopamine.
[00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:11.120]   I said, this connects to that, that connects to this.
[00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:13.920]   You can get local or more broad volumetric release.
[00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:16.140]   What about the duration of release
[00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:19.020]   or the duration of action for dopamine?
[00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:23.300]   Well, dopamine is unique among chemicals in the brain
[00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:26.640]   because dopamine unlike a lot of chemicals in the brain
[00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:29.480]   works through what are called G protein coupled receptors.
[00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:31.120]   And for those of you that are about to pass out
[00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:32.960]   from the amount of detail, just hang in there with me.
[00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:34.980]   It's really not complicated.
[00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:38.240]   There are two ways that neurons can communicate
[00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:39.480]   or mainly two ways.
[00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:40.660]   There are a third and a fourth,
[00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:45.620]   but mostly neurons communicate by two modes.
[00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:48.960]   One are what we call fast electrical synapses,
[00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:51.360]   ionotropic conduction, all right?
[00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:52.280]   You don't need to know what that means,
[00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:56.320]   but basically one neuron activates another neuron
[00:22:56.320 --> 00:23:00.700]   and little holes open up in that neuron and ions rush in.
[00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:05.160]   Sodium is the main ion salt by which one neuron
[00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:07.240]   influences the electrical activity of another neuron
[00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:10.140]   because sodium ions contain a charge, okay?
[00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:12.480]   There are other things like chloride and potassium.
[00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:13.680]   If you're interested in looking this up,
[00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:17.180]   just look up ionic conductances in the action potential,
[00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:18.700]   or I could do a post on it sometime
[00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:20.520]   and we could go into detail,
[00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:22.360]   but just understand that when neurons want to
[00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:23.400]   influence each other,
[00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:26.520]   they can do it by way of this fast ionotropic conduction.
[00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:29.600]   This is a really quick way for one neuron
[00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:31.920]   to influence the next.
[00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:34.240]   Dopamine doesn't communicate that way.
[00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:35.680]   Dopamine is slower.
[00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:36.600]   It works through what are called
[00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:38.520]   G protein coupled receptors.
[00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:40.580]   So what happens is dopamine is released
[00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:42.560]   in these little vesicles that I've mentioned before,
[00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:45.040]   get vomited out into the synapse.
[00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:47.300]   Some of that dopamine will bind
[00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:49.400]   to the so-called postsynaptic neuron.
[00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:50.760]   It'll bind to the next neuron.
[00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:53.300]   And then it sets off a cascade.
[00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:55.240]   It's kind of like a bucket brigade of one thing
[00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:58.020]   getting handed off to the next, to the next, to the next.
[00:23:58.020 --> 00:24:00.360]   It's G protein coupled receptors.
[00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:02.120]   And anytime you hear about these GPCRs
[00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:04.360]   or G protein coupled receptors,
[00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:06.620]   pay attention because they're really interesting.
[00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:07.880]   They're slow,
[00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:11.120]   but they also can have multiple cascades of effects.
[00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:14.320]   They can impact even gene expression at some level.
[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:17.240]   They can change what a cell actually becomes.
[00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:20.560]   They can change how well or how poorly that cell
[00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:23.960]   will respond to the same signal in the future.
[00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:26.760]   So dopamine works through the slower process,
[00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:28.420]   these G protein coupled receptors.
[00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:32.780]   And so its effects tend to take a while in order to occur.
[00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:37.800]   This aspect of dopamine transmission is important
[00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:39.460]   because it now underscores two things.
[00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:42.520]   One, there's two pathways for dopamine to communicate,
[00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:44.660]   one for movement, one for motivation and craving.
[00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:49.020]   There's two spatial scales at which dopamine can operate
[00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:51.220]   synaptically or volumetrically.
[00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:56.220]   And dopamine can have slow effects, really slow effects,
[00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:58.280]   or even very long lasting effects.
[00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:00.880]   And it even can control gene expression.
[00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:03.460]   It can actually change the way that cells behave.
[00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:05.520]   One thing that's not often discussed about dopamine,
[00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:07.900]   but is extremely important to know
[00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:11.040]   is that dopamine doesn't work on its own.
[00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:15.880]   Neurons that release dopamine co-release glutamate.
[00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:18.540]   Glutamate is a neurotransmitter,
[00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:21.200]   and it's a neurotransmitter that is excitatory,
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:24.760]   meaning it stimulates neurons to be electrically active.
[00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:28.680]   So now, even if you don't know any cell biology,
[00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:31.920]   should start to gain a picture that dopamine is responsible
[00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:34.340]   for movement, motivation, and drive.
[00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:35.720]   It does that through two pathways,
[00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:39.680]   but also the dopamine stimulates action in general
[00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:41.960]   because it releases this excitatory neurotransmitter.
[00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:45.880]   It tends to make certain neurons that are nearby,
[00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:48.240]   or even that are far away because of volumetric release,
[00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:50.080]   it tends to make those more active.
[00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:52.240]   So dopamine is really stimulating.
[00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:56.320]   And indeed, we say that dopaminergic transmission
[00:25:56.320 --> 00:26:00.600]   or dopamine tends to stimulate sympathetic arousal.
[00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:02.680]   Sympathetic doesn't have anything to do with sympathy.
[00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:05.880]   It's just simply means that it tends to increase
[00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:07.300]   our levels of alertness.
[00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:10.780]   It tends to bring an animal or a human into a state
[00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:15.100]   of more alertness, readiness, and desire to pursue things
[00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:17.400]   outside the confines of its skin.
[00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:21.040]   So if I were to just put a really simple message
[00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:22.800]   around dopamine, it would be,
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:24.880]   there's a molecule in your brain and body
[00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:29.880]   that when released tends to make you look outside yourself,
[00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:32.620]   pursue things outside yourself,
[00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:35.760]   and to crave things outside yourself.
[00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:39.080]   The pleasure that arrives from achieving things
[00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:40.460]   also involves dopamine,
[00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:43.840]   but is mainly the consequence of other molecules.
[00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:46.620]   But if ever you felt lethargic and like just lazy
[00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:48.280]   and you had no motivation or drive,
[00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:50.480]   that's a low dopamine state.
[00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:52.960]   If ever you felt really excited, motivated,
[00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:55.680]   even if you were a little scared to do something,
[00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:57.040]   maybe you did your first skydive
[00:26:57.040 --> 00:26:59.000]   or you're about to do your first skydive
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:00.500]   or you're about to do some public speaking
[00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:02.820]   and you really don't want to screw it up,
[00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:05.600]   you are in a high dopamine state.
[00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:08.900]   Dopamine is a universal currency in all mammals,
[00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:13.660]   but especially in humans for moving us toward goals
[00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:17.640]   and how much dopamine is in our system at any one time
[00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:20.520]   compared to how much dopamine was in our system
[00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:24.220]   a few minutes ago and how much we remember
[00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:27.740]   enjoying a particular experience of the past.
[00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:30.740]   That dictates your so-called quality of life
[00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:33.260]   and your desire to pursue things.
[00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:34.180]   This is really important.
[00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:36.160]   Dopamine is a currency
[00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:38.620]   and it's the way that you track pleasure.
[00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:40.360]   It's the way that you track success.
[00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:42.540]   It's the way that you track whether or not
[00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:44.920]   you are doing well or doing poorly.
[00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:47.000]   And that is subjective.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:50.340]   But if your dopamine is too low,
[00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:52.000]   you will not feel motivated.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.360]   If your dopamine is really high, you will feel motivated.
[00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:57.760]   And if your dopamine is somewhere in the middle,
[00:27:57.760 --> 00:27:59.680]   how you feel depends on whether or not
[00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:04.160]   you had higher dopamine a few minutes ago or lower dopamine.
[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:05.760]   This is important.
[00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:08.800]   Your experience of life and your level of motivation
[00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:13.480]   and drive depends on how much dopamine you have
[00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:17.080]   relative to your recent experience.
[00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:20.560]   This is, again, something that's just not accounted for
[00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:23.760]   in the simple language of dopamine hits, okay?
[00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:26.860]   A simple way to envision dopamine hits
[00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:28.320]   is every time you do something you like,
[00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:29.920]   you eat a piece of chocolate, dopamine hit.
[00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:31.640]   You look at your Instagram, dopamine hit.
[00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:34.280]   You see someone you like, dopamine hit.
[00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:37.540]   All these things described as dopamine hits
[00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:40.640]   neglect the fact that if you scroll social media
[00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:43.740]   and you see something you really like, dopamine hit.
[00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:45.800]   Sure, there's an increase in dopamine,
[00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:47.640]   but then you get to something else
[00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:49.680]   and you go, "Hmm, not that interesting."
[00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:53.520]   However, had you arrived at that second thing first,
[00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:55.880]   you might think that it was really interesting.
[00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:59.540]   If you had arrived to that second Instagram post
[00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:01.560]   three days later or four days later,
[00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:03.940]   you might find it extremely interesting.
[00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:07.260]   Again, how much dopamine you experience from something
[00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:09.320]   depends on your baseline level of dopamine
[00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:14.320]   when you arrive there and your previous dopamine peaks, okay?
[00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:16.600]   That's super important to understand,
[00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:18.120]   and it's completely neglected
[00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:20.180]   by the general language of dopamine hits.
[00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:23.680]   This is why when you repeatedly engage in something
[00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:27.140]   that you enjoy, your threshold for enjoyment
[00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:29.040]   goes up and up and up.
[00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:30.960]   So I want to talk about that process,
[00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:33.060]   and I want to explain how that process works,
[00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:34.840]   because if you understand that process
[00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:37.760]   and you understand some of these schedules and kinetics,
[00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:39.000]   as we call them around dopamine,
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.840]   you will be in a terrific position
[00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:44.560]   to use any dopamine-enhancing tools that you decide to use.
[00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:46.860]   You'll be in an excellent position to modulate
[00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:48.760]   and control your own dopamine release
[00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:50.960]   for optimal motivation and drive.
[00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:53.360]   I realized that was a lot of information
[00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:55.000]   about the biology of dopamine,
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.480]   sort of like trying to make you drink
[00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:59.280]   from the fire hose of dopamine biology.
[00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:01.360]   However, I realize that some people probably want
[00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:03.880]   even more information about the biology
[00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:05.720]   of dopamine transmission.
[00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:07.240]   If you're interested in that,
[00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:09.840]   I'll post a link to a absolutely stellar review
[00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:12.360]   that was published in Nature Reviews Neuroscience
[00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:15.480]   called Spatial and Temporal Scales of Dopamine Transmission.
[00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:18.240]   It is quite detailed, but they have beautiful diagrams
[00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:20.280]   and can walk you through all the things
[00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:22.680]   that I just described and get into even more detail.
[00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:25.300]   We'll put a link to that in the caption on YouTube.
[00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:29.360]   Right now, I want to share with you two anecdotes,
[00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:34.220]   one from my own life and one from some fairly recent history
[00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:38.140]   that illustrate some of the core biology of dopamine
[00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:41.560]   and how profoundly it can shape our experience.
[00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:45.980]   The first one is a really tragic situation that occurred.
[00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:49.300]   This was in the '80s.
[00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:52.360]   There was a outbreak of what looked
[00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:56.300]   like Parkinsonian symptoms in a young population.
[00:30:56.300 --> 00:30:58.200]   So many of you heard of Parkinson's disease.
[00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:00.260]   Parkinson's disease is a disease
[00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:03.640]   in which people initially start to quake,
[00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:05.080]   can't generate smooth movements.
[00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:06.320]   They'll have issues with speech,
[00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:08.560]   sometimes cognition as well.
[00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:10.940]   There are examples like Michael J. Fox,
[00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:13.500]   which are kind of early onset Parkinson's.
[00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:16.660]   Typically, it hits people a little bit later in life.
[00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:18.240]   There's a genetic component,
[00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:22.700]   but there is this question and there's always been
[00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:25.260]   this question whether or not certain lifestyle factors
[00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:27.580]   can also create Parkinson's.
[00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:32.140]   And some years ago, there was a situation
[00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:35.300]   where laboratories, street laboratories,
[00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:39.980]   illicit laboratories were trying to make a drug called MPPP,
[00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:41.780]   which is an opioid-like compound.
[00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:46.780]   It's a bit like heroin and heroin addicts seeking heroin
[00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:50.680]   went out and bought what they thought was MPPP.
[00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:56.120]   Unfortunately, it was not MPPP.
[00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:58.000]   I mean, it would have been tragic if it was anyway,
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.200]   because they were drug addicts,
[00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:02.280]   but what they ended up taking turned out to be a lot worse.
[00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:05.740]   What they ended up taking was MPTP,
[00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:10.740]   and MPTP can arise in the synthesis of MPPP.
[00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:12.680]   So someone in a lab someplace,
[00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:14.660]   this was mainly in the Central Valley in California,
[00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:16.820]   but elsewhere as well,
[00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:20.160]   somebody created MPTP.
[00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:23.820]   And what ended up happening was a large number
[00:32:23.820 --> 00:32:26.780]   of young people who were opioid addicts
[00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:30.220]   became completely boxed in paralyzed,
[00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:34.240]   couldn't speak, couldn't blink, couldn't do anything,
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:35.800]   couldn't function, couldn't move.
[00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:40.800]   So both aspects of dopamine transmission were disrupted.
[00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:43.300]   They had no motivation and drive.
[00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:45.740]   They couldn't generate any movement of any kind.
[00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:47.880]   They were literally locked in frozen.
[00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:51.540]   And sadly, this is irreversible.
[00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:54.900]   It's irreversible because what MPTP does
[00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:58.180]   is it kills the dopaminergic neurons
[00:32:58.180 --> 00:33:00.900]   of the substantia nigra, that nigrostriatal pathway
[00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:02.780]   that's involved in generating movement,
[00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:05.180]   and it kills the dopaminergic neurons
[00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:07.940]   of the so-called mesocortical limbic pathway.
[00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:10.980]   I was in college when this whole MPTP thing happened,
[00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:13.100]   and I remember hearing this story.
[00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:16.320]   At the time, I had no understanding of what it is
[00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:18.380]   to have very high levels of dopamine
[00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:20.660]   or extremely depleted levels of dopamine.
[00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:22.560]   There was no reason why I should have that understanding.
[00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:24.700]   I mean, of course, I had experienced different pleasures
[00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:27.660]   of different kinds, and I've had lows in my life,
[00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:32.040]   but nothing to the extreme that I'm about to discuss.
[00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:38.060]   I got Giardia, and Giardia is a stomach bug
[00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:40.780]   that if any of you ever had it, it is terrible.
[00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:43.180]   It's terrible diarrhea, you end up very dehydrated,
[00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:45.740]   very quickly, you drop a ton of weight,
[00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:48.120]   and it is extremely unpleasant.
[00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:51.660]   I ended up going to the emergency room,
[00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:53.780]   and in the emergency room,
[00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:56.100]   I begged them for something to stop up my guts,
[00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:57.340]   and they gave it to me.
[00:33:57.340 --> 00:33:59.500]   They put a saline line in to rehydrate me,
[00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:02.660]   and they injected something into the saline bag,
[00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:07.660]   and within minutes, I felt more sadness,
[00:34:08.700 --> 00:34:13.340]   more overwhelming sense of depression,
[00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:16.580]   basically lower than I'd ever felt in my entire life.
[00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:19.620]   It was absolutely profound.
[00:34:19.620 --> 00:34:23.700]   I was crying endlessly without knowing why I was crying.
[00:34:23.700 --> 00:34:26.740]   I was miserable, and I asked them, "What did you inject?"
[00:34:26.740 --> 00:34:29.020]   And they said, "We injected Thorazine."
[00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:31.540]   Thorazine is an anti-psychotic drug.
[00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:34.120]   It's actually used to block dopamine receptors.
[00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:37.380]   It's what's given to people who have schizophrenia,
[00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:39.440]   often is given to people who have schizophrenia,
[00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:42.860]   because schizophrenia involves, among other things,
[00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:44.500]   elevated levels of dopamine.
[00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:47.860]   It was horrible.
[00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:50.620]   The experience of it was miserable,
[00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:53.140]   unlike anything I'd ever experienced.
[00:34:53.140 --> 00:34:56.540]   And so I actually said to them, "What did you give me?"
[00:34:56.540 --> 00:34:58.220]   They said, "Thorazine," and I said,
[00:34:58.220 --> 00:35:00.700]   "You have to give me L-DOPA.
[00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:01.780]   You have to give me something
[00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:04.100]   to get my dopamine levels back up again."
[00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:04.980]   And they did.
[00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:07.320]   They gave me an injection of L-DOPA into the bag
[00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:08.500]   went straight into my bloodstream,
[00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:12.220]   and within minutes, I felt fine again.
[00:35:12.220 --> 00:35:15.300]   It was incredible, and it really opened up my mind
[00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:17.060]   and my experience to what it is
[00:35:17.060 --> 00:35:21.060]   to have absolutely plummeted levels of dopamine.
[00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:23.120]   There's nothing more miserable than that, I'll tell you.
[00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:27.820]   And these poor souls who had this MPTP experience,
[00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:29.820]   unfortunately, they couldn't recover those cells.
[00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:31.980]   People who have severe Parkinson's
[00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:33.360]   are struggling with this as well,
[00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:35.500]   because in Parkinson's and in Lewy body dementia,
[00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:37.800]   the dopaminergic neurons often die.
[00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:38.700]   It's not just a problem
[00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:40.940]   with those neurons releasing enough dopamine.
[00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:43.200]   Later, we're going to talk about some approaches
[00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:46.040]   to maintaining dopaminergic neuron health
[00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:47.800]   and things that we can all do for that.
[00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:49.980]   But I will tell you, these dopamine neurons
[00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:51.800]   that we all have are very precious
[00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:54.240]   for movement and mood and motivation.
[00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:56.120]   Having experienced what it is
[00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:58.720]   to have very, very low levels of dopamine,
[00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:00.740]   or in this case, to have my dopamine receptors
[00:36:00.740 --> 00:36:05.740]   blocked from thorazine was eye-opening, to say the least,
[00:36:05.740 --> 00:36:09.060]   and has given me tremendous sensitivity
[00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:12.120]   to the fact that dopamine is perhaps
[00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:13.900]   one of the most powerful molecules
[00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:16.460]   that any of us has inside of us,
[00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:19.120]   and the one that we ought to all think very carefully
[00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:20.100]   about how we leverage.
[00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:24.380]   Because while most experiences and most things
[00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:27.260]   that we do and take and eat and et cetera
[00:36:27.260 --> 00:36:30.860]   won't create enormous highs and enormous lows in dopamine,
[00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:33.600]   even subtle fluctuations in dopamine
[00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:35.740]   really shape our perception of life
[00:36:35.740 --> 00:36:38.060]   and what we're capable of and how we feel.
[00:36:38.060 --> 00:36:39.180]   And so we want to guard those
[00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:40.580]   and we want to understand them.
[00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:42.660]   So let's lean into that understanding about dopamine,
[00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:45.220]   and then let's talk about some tools that we can all use
[00:36:45.220 --> 00:36:48.340]   to leverage dopamine in order to keep that baseline
[00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:50.520]   in the appropriate healthy place
[00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:53.780]   and still be able to access those peaks in dopamine,
[00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:55.520]   because those, after all,
[00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:58.380]   are some of what makes life rich and worth living.
[00:36:58.380 --> 00:37:00.620]   So let's talk about the baseline of dopamine
[00:37:00.620 --> 00:37:03.640]   that we all have and the peaks in dopamine
[00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:07.040]   that we all can achieve through different activities
[00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:08.560]   and things that we ingest.
[00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:13.760]   All of us have different baseline levels of dopamine.
[00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:17.000]   Some of this is sure to be genetic.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:21.240]   Some people just simply ride at a level a little bit higher,
[00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:22.500]   they're a little bit more excited,
[00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:24.620]   they're a little bit more motivated,
[00:37:24.620 --> 00:37:25.980]   or maybe they're a lot more excited
[00:37:25.980 --> 00:37:27.240]   or a lot more motivated.
[00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:30.340]   Some people are a little mellower,
[00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:32.460]   some people are a little less excitable.
[00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:34.500]   And some of that has to do with the fact
[00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:37.180]   that dopamine doesn't act alone.
[00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:41.300]   Dopamine has close cousins or friends in the nervous system,
[00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:42.640]   and I'll just name off a few of those
[00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:44.000]   close cousins and friends.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:48.620]   Epinephrine, also called adrenaline,
[00:37:48.620 --> 00:37:52.020]   is the main chemical driver of energy.
[00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:54.280]   We can't do anything.
[00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:56.980]   Anything at all unless we have some level of epinephrine
[00:37:56.980 --> 00:37:58.620]   in our brain and body.
[00:37:58.620 --> 00:38:00.020]   It's released from the adrenal glands,
[00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:01.180]   which ride atop our kidneys.
[00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:03.420]   It's released from an area of the brainstem
[00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:05.420]   called locus coeruleus.
[00:38:05.420 --> 00:38:08.620]   And its release tends to wake up neural circuits
[00:38:08.620 --> 00:38:11.880]   in the brain and wake up various aspects
[00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:15.780]   of our body's physiology and give us a readiness.
[00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:16.940]   So it should come as no surprise
[00:38:16.940 --> 00:38:19.580]   that dopamine and epinephrine,
[00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:22.300]   AKA adrenaline, hang out together.
[00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:24.640]   In fact, epinephrine and adrenaline
[00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:28.120]   are actually manufactured from dopamine.
[00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:30.560]   There's a biochemical pathway involving dopamine,
[00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:32.200]   which is a beautiful pathway.
[00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:33.700]   If ever you want to look it up,
[00:38:33.700 --> 00:38:36.120]   you could just look up biochemistry of dopamine.
[00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:39.160]   But what you'll find is that L-DOPA
[00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:41.480]   is converted into dopamine.
[00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:47.200]   Dopamine is converted into noradrenaline,
[00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:49.500]   norepinephrine, it's also called.
[00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:52.840]   And noradrenaline, norepinephrine is converted
[00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:54.460]   into adrenaline.
[00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:57.800]   So not only are dopamine and epinephrine,
[00:38:57.800 --> 00:39:00.020]   AKA adrenaline close cousins,
[00:39:00.020 --> 00:39:02.540]   they are actually family members, okay?
[00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:04.060]   They're closely related.
[00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:06.260]   I'm not going to get too deep into epinephrine today.
[00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:08.380]   I'm not going to talk too much about those pathways,
[00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:11.020]   but anytime I'm talking about dopaminergic transmission
[00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:13.060]   or that you have a peak in dopamine,
[00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:15.100]   inevitably that means that you have a peak
[00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:17.660]   in release of epinephrine as well.
[00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:21.560]   What dopamine does is dopamine really colors
[00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:24.340]   the subjective experience of an activity
[00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:26.340]   to make it more pleasureful,
[00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:28.600]   to make it something that you want more of.
[00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:30.780]   Epinephrine is more about energy.
[00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:35.780]   Epinephrine alone can be fear, paralysis, trauma,
[00:39:35.780 --> 00:39:38.640]   not physical paralysis, but mental paralysis,
[00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:42.160]   frozen in fear or being traumatized or scared.
[00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:45.980]   But the addition of dopamine to that chemical cocktail,
[00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:48.380]   if dopamine was released in the brain,
[00:39:48.380 --> 00:39:53.060]   well, then that epinephrine becomes one of excitement.
[00:39:53.060 --> 00:39:54.860]   Okay, I'm using a broad brush here,
[00:39:54.860 --> 00:39:57.460]   but essentially what you need to know is that dopamine
[00:39:57.460 --> 00:40:00.820]   and epinephrine, AKA adrenaline are family members
[00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:03.160]   and they tend to work together like a little gang
[00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:06.020]   to make you seek out certain things.
[00:40:06.020 --> 00:40:08.100]   So what sorts of activities,
[00:40:08.100 --> 00:40:11.200]   what sorts of things increase dopamine
[00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:14.000]   and how much do they increase dopamine?
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:17.700]   Well, let's take a look at some typical things
[00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:21.340]   that people do out there or ingest out there
[00:40:21.340 --> 00:40:23.840]   that are known to increase dopamine.
[00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:26.580]   So let's recall that you have a baseline level of dopamine
[00:40:26.580 --> 00:40:28.200]   and that everybody does.
[00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:29.360]   And even within a family,
[00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:31.900]   you might have family members who are very excitable,
[00:40:31.900 --> 00:40:34.500]   happy and motivated and others who are less excitable,
[00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:36.080]   happy and motivated.
[00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:40.660]   But your level of dopamine has everything to do
[00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:41.800]   with those genetics,
[00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:44.640]   but also with what you've experienced in the previous days
[00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:46.380]   and the previous months and so on.
[00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:50.440]   When you do or ingest certain things,
[00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:54.500]   your levels of dopamine will rise above baseline transiently
[00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:57.980]   and depending on what you do or ingest,
[00:40:57.980 --> 00:41:00.780]   it will rise either more or less
[00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:03.700]   and it will be very brief or it'll last a long time.
[00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:05.540]   So let's take a look at some of the typical things
[00:41:05.540 --> 00:41:08.820]   that people take and do and eat.
[00:41:08.820 --> 00:41:11.180]   Some are good for us, some are not good for us.
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:15.720]   And let's ask how much dopamine is increased above baseline.
[00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:16.940]   Now, of course, these are averages,
[00:41:16.940 --> 00:41:19.100]   but these are averages that have been measured
[00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:21.860]   in so-called micro dialysis studies in animals.
[00:41:21.860 --> 00:41:24.020]   So actually extracting from particular brain areas,
[00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:27.340]   how much dopamine is released or from measuring the serum,
[00:41:27.340 --> 00:41:30.720]   the circulating levels of dopamine in humans.
[00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:35.820]   Chocolate, they didn't look at milk versus dark chocolate,
[00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:38.940]   but chocolate will increase your baseline level
[00:41:38.940 --> 00:41:41.920]   of dopamine 1.5 times, okay?
[00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:44.400]   So it's a pretty substantial increase in dopamine.
[00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:48.000]   It's transient, it goes away after a few minutes
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.320]   or even a few seconds.
[00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:53.280]   I'll explain what determines the duration in a minute,
[00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:55.620]   but 1.5 times for chocolate.
[00:41:55.620 --> 00:42:01.600]   Sex, both the pursuit of sex and the act of sex
[00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:06.320]   increases dopamine two times.
[00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:08.980]   So it's a doubling above baseline.
[00:42:08.980 --> 00:42:11.300]   Now, of course, there's going to be variation there,
[00:42:11.300 --> 00:42:15.220]   but that's the average increase in baseline dopamine
[00:42:15.220 --> 00:42:17.720]   caused by sex.
[00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:22.300]   Later, I will talk about how the different aspects
[00:42:22.300 --> 00:42:25.260]   of the so-called arousal arc, the different aspects of sex,
[00:42:25.260 --> 00:42:28.900]   believe it or not, have a differential impact on dopamine.
[00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:33.060]   But for now, as a general theme or activity,
[00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:37.100]   sex doubles the amount of dopamine circulating in your blood.
[00:42:37.100 --> 00:42:43.340]   Nicotine, in particular, nicotine that is smoked,
[00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:44.940]   like cigarettes and so forth,
[00:42:44.940 --> 00:42:49.900]   increases dopamine 2.5 times above baseline.
[00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:53.240]   So there's a peak that goes up above baseline
[00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:55.640]   2.5 times higher.
[00:42:55.640 --> 00:42:59.160]   It is very short-lived.
[00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:01.480]   Anyone who's ever been a chain smoker
[00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:03.440]   or observed a chain smoker understands
[00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:06.580]   that the increase in dopamine from nicotine
[00:43:06.580 --> 00:43:08.420]   is very short-lived.
[00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:12.300]   Cocaine will increase the level of dopamine
[00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:15.080]   in the bloodstream 2.5 times above baseline.
[00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:21.340]   And amphetamine, another drug that increases dopamine,
[00:43:21.340 --> 00:43:25.000]   will increase the amount of dopamine in the bloodstream
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.420]   10 times above baseline,
[00:43:27.420 --> 00:43:30.200]   a tremendous increase in dopamine.
[00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:31.780]   Exercise.
[00:43:31.780 --> 00:43:34.460]   Now, exercise will have a different impact
[00:43:34.460 --> 00:43:35.660]   on the levels of dopamine,
[00:43:35.660 --> 00:43:37.500]   depending on how much somebody
[00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:40.580]   subjectively enjoys that exercise.
[00:43:40.580 --> 00:43:43.300]   So if you're somebody who loves running,
[00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:47.740]   chances are it's going to increase your levels of dopamine
[00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:51.320]   two times above your baseline, not unlike sex.
[00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:55.140]   People who dislike exercise
[00:43:55.140 --> 00:43:57.500]   will achieve less dopamine increase
[00:43:57.500 --> 00:44:01.000]   or no increase in dopamine from exercise.
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:02.560]   And if you like other forms of exercise,
[00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:05.920]   like yoga or weightlifting or swimming or what have you,
[00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:08.320]   again, it's going to vary by your subjective experience
[00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:11.380]   of whether or not you enjoy that activity.
[00:44:11.380 --> 00:44:12.720]   This is important.
[00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:14.100]   And it brings us back to something
[00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:15.280]   that we talked about earlier.
[00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:19.300]   Remember that mesocorticolimbic pathway?
[00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:21.560]   Well, the cortical part is important.
[00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:25.220]   The cortical part actually has a very specific part,
[00:44:25.220 --> 00:44:26.980]   which is your prefrontal cortex.
[00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:28.900]   The area of your forebrain
[00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:31.360]   that's involved in thinking and planning
[00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:35.460]   and involved in assigning a rational explanation
[00:44:35.460 --> 00:44:38.060]   to something and involved in assigning
[00:44:38.060 --> 00:44:41.100]   a subjective experience to something.
[00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:43.240]   So for instance, the pen that I'm holding right now,
[00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:44.580]   it's one of these Pilot V5s.
[00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:45.700]   I love these Pilot V5s.
[00:44:45.700 --> 00:44:46.680]   They don't sponsor the podcast.
[00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:47.520]   I just happen to like them.
[00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:49.780]   I like the way that they write, how they feel.
[00:44:49.780 --> 00:44:53.260]   If I spent enough time thinking about or talking about it,
[00:44:53.260 --> 00:44:54.700]   I could probably get a dopamine increase
[00:44:54.700 --> 00:44:56.220]   just talking about this Pilot V5.
[00:44:56.220 --> 00:44:58.840]   And that's not because I have the propensity
[00:44:58.840 --> 00:45:00.260]   to release dopamine easily.
[00:45:00.260 --> 00:45:03.520]   It's that as we start to engage with something more and more
[00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:05.040]   and what we say about it
[00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:07.980]   and what we encourage ourselves to think about it
[00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:11.080]   has a profound impact on its rewarding
[00:45:11.080 --> 00:45:13.300]   or non-rewarding properties.
[00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:15.780]   Now it's not simply the case that you can lie to yourself
[00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:17.260]   and you can tell yourself, I love something.
[00:45:17.260 --> 00:45:18.620]   And when you don't really love it
[00:45:18.620 --> 00:45:20.880]   and it will increase dopamine.
[00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:22.740]   But what's been found over and over again
[00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:24.580]   is that if people journal about something
[00:45:24.580 --> 00:45:27.780]   or they practice some form of appreciation for something
[00:45:27.780 --> 00:45:31.540]   or they think of some aspect of something that they enjoy,
[00:45:31.540 --> 00:45:35.580]   the amount of dopamine that that behavior will evoke
[00:45:35.580 --> 00:45:37.140]   tends to go up.
[00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:38.660]   So for people that hate exercise,
[00:45:38.660 --> 00:45:41.580]   you can think about some aspect of exercise
[00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:42.660]   that you really enjoy.
[00:45:42.660 --> 00:45:47.660]   However, I will caution you against saying to yourself,
[00:45:47.660 --> 00:45:52.700]   I hate exercise or I hate studying or I hate this person,
[00:45:52.700 --> 00:45:55.900]   but I love the reward I give myself afterward.
[00:45:55.900 --> 00:45:59.280]   Later we're going to talk about how rewards given afterward
[00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:01.640]   actually make the situation worse.
[00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:04.600]   They won't make you like exercise more or studying more.
[00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:07.080]   They actually will undermine the dopamine release
[00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:09.440]   that would otherwise occur for that activity.
[00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:13.580]   So certain things, chemicals have a universal effect.
[00:46:13.580 --> 00:46:16.040]   They make everybody's dopamine go up.
[00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:17.540]   So some people like chocolate,
[00:46:17.540 --> 00:46:19.380]   some people don't of course,
[00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:22.860]   but in general it causes this increase in dopamine,
[00:46:22.860 --> 00:46:25.940]   but sex, nicotine, cocaine, amphetamine,
[00:46:25.940 --> 00:46:28.040]   those things cause increases in dopamine
[00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:29.500]   in everybody that takes them.
[00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:33.400]   Things like exercise, studying, hard work,
[00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:35.300]   working through a challenge in a relationship
[00:46:35.300 --> 00:46:38.100]   or working through something hard of any kind,
[00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:40.300]   that is going to be subjective
[00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:42.740]   as to how much dopamine will be released.
[00:46:42.740 --> 00:46:45.320]   And we will return to that subjective component
[00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:46.780]   in a little bit.
[00:46:46.780 --> 00:46:50.900]   But now you have a sense of how much dopamine
[00:46:50.900 --> 00:46:53.060]   can be evoked by different activities
[00:46:53.060 --> 00:46:54.980]   and by different substances.
[00:46:54.980 --> 00:46:57.440]   One that you might be wondering about is caffeine.
[00:46:57.440 --> 00:46:59.320]   I'm certainly drinking my caffeine today
[00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:03.500]   and I do enjoy caffeine in limited quantities.
[00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:07.340]   I drink Yerba Mate and I drink coffee and I love it.
[00:47:07.340 --> 00:47:10.100]   Does it increase dopamine?
[00:47:10.100 --> 00:47:11.820]   Well, a little bit.
[00:47:11.820 --> 00:47:14.380]   Caffeine will increase dopamine to some extent,
[00:47:14.380 --> 00:47:17.580]   but it is pretty modest compared to the other things
[00:47:17.580 --> 00:47:18.780]   that I described.
[00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:21.580]   Chocolate, sex, nicotine, cocaine, amphetamine, and so on.
[00:47:21.580 --> 00:47:25.780]   However, there's a really interesting paper published
[00:47:25.780 --> 00:47:28.540]   in 2015, this is Volkow et al,
[00:47:28.540 --> 00:47:30.580]   you can look it up, it's very easy to find,
[00:47:30.580 --> 00:47:33.600]   that showed that regular ingestion of caffeine,
[00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:36.100]   whether or not it's from coffee or otherwise,
[00:47:36.100 --> 00:47:40.940]   increases up regulation of certain dopamine receptors.
[00:47:40.940 --> 00:47:45.940]   So caffeine actually makes you able to experience
[00:47:45.940 --> 00:47:47.940]   more of dopamine's effects.
[00:47:47.940 --> 00:47:49.060]   Because as I mentioned before,
[00:47:49.060 --> 00:47:51.260]   dopamine is vomited out into the synapse
[00:47:51.260 --> 00:47:52.500]   or it's released volumetrically,
[00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:53.960]   but then it has to bind someplace
[00:47:53.960 --> 00:47:56.820]   and trigger those G protein coupled receptors.
[00:47:56.820 --> 00:47:59.700]   And caffeine increases the number,
[00:47:59.700 --> 00:48:03.380]   the density of those G protein coupled receptors.
[00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:06.020]   Now, sitting back and thinking about that,
[00:48:06.020 --> 00:48:09.300]   you might think, oh yeah, sometimes I'll notice people,
[00:48:09.300 --> 00:48:11.900]   at least in the old days that it used to be a cigarette
[00:48:11.900 --> 00:48:14.660]   and a cup of coffee, or when people drink alcohol,
[00:48:14.660 --> 00:48:16.260]   oftentimes they'll smoke.
[00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:18.980]   And it's well known that different compounds
[00:48:18.980 --> 00:48:23.020]   like alcohol and nicotine or caffeine and nicotine
[00:48:23.020 --> 00:48:25.660]   or certain behaviors and certain drugs
[00:48:25.660 --> 00:48:28.740]   can synergize to give bigger dopamine increases.
[00:48:28.740 --> 00:48:30.580]   And this is not terribly uncommon.
[00:48:30.580 --> 00:48:32.840]   There are a lot of people nowadays who, for instance,
[00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:34.740]   take pre-workout energy drinks.
[00:48:34.740 --> 00:48:36.420]   They'll drink, I won't name names,
[00:48:36.420 --> 00:48:38.640]   but they'll drink a canned energy drink
[00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:40.500]   or they'll drink a pre-workout
[00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:42.900]   and they'll try and get that big stimulation,
[00:48:42.900 --> 00:48:45.960]   that stimulant effect for the dopamine, the norepinephrine,
[00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:47.680]   that family of molecules that works together
[00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:48.700]   to make you motivated.
[00:48:48.700 --> 00:48:51.720]   And then they'll also exercise to try and get even more
[00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:54.940]   of a dopaminergic experience out of that workout.
[00:48:54.940 --> 00:48:59.100]   Sometimes it's also to perform better as well, of course.
[00:48:59.100 --> 00:49:01.840]   But as we'll talk about in a few minutes,
[00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:04.140]   that aspect or that approach rather
[00:49:04.140 --> 00:49:05.500]   of trying to just get your dopamine
[00:49:05.500 --> 00:49:07.040]   as high as you possibly can
[00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:09.540]   in order to get the most out of an experience,
[00:49:09.540 --> 00:49:11.820]   turns out to not be the best approach.
[00:49:11.820 --> 00:49:15.980]   And what you'll find as we talk about dopamine schedules
[00:49:15.980 --> 00:49:19.660]   is that layering together multiple things,
[00:49:19.660 --> 00:49:23.100]   substances and activities that lead to big increases
[00:49:23.100 --> 00:49:26.980]   in dopamine actually can create pretty severe issues
[00:49:26.980 --> 00:49:30.460]   with motivation and energy right after those experiences
[00:49:30.460 --> 00:49:32.180]   and even a couple of days later.
[00:49:32.180 --> 00:49:33.940]   So I'm not saying that people shouldn't take
[00:49:33.940 --> 00:49:35.800]   the occasional pre-workout if that's your thing
[00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:38.560]   or drink a cup of coffee or two before working out.
[00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:40.660]   Now and again, some people really enjoy that.
[00:49:40.660 --> 00:49:42.720]   I certainly do that every once in a while.
[00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:44.240]   But if you do it too often,
[00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:48.380]   what you'll find is that your capacity to release dopamine
[00:49:48.380 --> 00:49:51.500]   and your level of motivation and drive and energy overall
[00:49:51.500 --> 00:49:53.380]   will take a serious hit.
[00:49:53.380 --> 00:49:55.760]   Now I've been alluding to this dopamine peaks
[00:49:55.760 --> 00:49:57.480]   versus dopamine baseline thing
[00:49:57.480 --> 00:49:58.940]   since the beginning of the episode,
[00:49:58.940 --> 00:50:01.960]   talked about tonic and phasic release and so forth.
[00:50:01.960 --> 00:50:04.280]   But now let's really drill into what this means
[00:50:04.280 --> 00:50:07.960]   and how to leverage it for our own purposes.
[00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:10.200]   In order to do that, let's take a step back and ask,
[00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:12.960]   why would we have a dopamine system like this?
[00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:15.100]   Why would we have a dopamine system at all?
[00:50:15.100 --> 00:50:16.260]   Well, we have to remember
[00:50:16.260 --> 00:50:20.900]   what our species primary interest is.
[00:50:20.900 --> 00:50:24.980]   Our species like all species has a main interest
[00:50:24.980 --> 00:50:26.740]   and that's to make more of itself.
[00:50:26.740 --> 00:50:28.580]   It's not just about sex and reproduction.
[00:50:28.580 --> 00:50:31.300]   It's about forging for resources.
[00:50:31.300 --> 00:50:32.540]   Resources can be food.
[00:50:32.540 --> 00:50:36.600]   It can be water, it can be salt, can be shelter,
[00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:38.100]   can be social connection.
[00:50:38.100 --> 00:50:44.040]   Dopamine is the universal currency of forging and seeking.
[00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:46.780]   We call sometimes talk about motivation and craving,
[00:50:46.780 --> 00:50:49.600]   but what we mean in the evolutionary adaptive context,
[00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:52.460]   what we mean is forging and seeking, seeking water,
[00:50:52.460 --> 00:50:54.780]   seeking food, seeking mates,
[00:50:54.780 --> 00:50:57.320]   seeking things that make us feel good and avoiding things
[00:50:57.320 --> 00:50:58.280]   that don't make us feel good,
[00:50:58.280 --> 00:51:00.040]   but in particular seeking things
[00:51:00.040 --> 00:51:03.760]   that will provide sustenance and pleasure in the short term
[00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:06.520]   and will extend the species in the longterm.
[00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:09.080]   Once we understand that dopamine
[00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:12.240]   is a driver for us to seek things,
[00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:14.240]   it makes perfect sense as to why
[00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:17.400]   it would have a baseline level and it would have peaks
[00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:19.880]   and that the baseline and peaks would be related
[00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:21.920]   in some sort of direct way.
[00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:23.800]   Here's what I mean by that.
[00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:26.080]   Let's say that you were not alive now,
[00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:28.920]   but you were alive 10,000 years ago
[00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:31.160]   and you woke up and you looked
[00:51:31.160 --> 00:51:33.800]   and you realize you had minimal water
[00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:36.120]   and you had minimal food left.
[00:51:36.120 --> 00:51:38.560]   Maybe you have a child, maybe you have a partner,
[00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:39.960]   maybe you're in an entire village,
[00:51:39.960 --> 00:51:43.120]   but you realize that you need things, okay?
[00:51:43.120 --> 00:51:47.240]   You need to be able to generate the energy
[00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:49.040]   to go seek those things.
[00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:52.120]   And chances are there were dangers in seeking those things.
[00:51:52.120 --> 00:51:55.160]   Yes, it could be saber tooth tigers and things of that sort,
[00:51:55.160 --> 00:51:56.840]   but there are other dangers too.
[00:51:56.840 --> 00:51:58.460]   There's the danger of a cut to your skin
[00:51:58.460 --> 00:51:59.480]   that could lead to infection.
[00:51:59.480 --> 00:52:01.880]   There's the danger of storms, there's the danger of cold,
[00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:04.680]   there's the danger of leaving your loved ones behind.
[00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:07.480]   So you go out and forage, right?
[00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:08.940]   You could be hunting, you could be gathering,
[00:52:08.940 --> 00:52:10.920]   or you could be doing both.
[00:52:10.920 --> 00:52:14.500]   The going out and foraging process was,
[00:52:14.500 --> 00:52:16.980]   we are certain, driven by dopamine.
[00:52:16.980 --> 00:52:18.720]   I mean, there's no fossil record of the brain,
[00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:20.600]   but these circuits have existed, we know,
[00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:23.820]   for tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of years
[00:52:23.820 --> 00:52:27.000]   and they are present in every animal, not just mammals,
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:28.880]   but even in little worms, like C. elegans,
[00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:32.280]   the same process is mediated by dopamine.
[00:52:32.280 --> 00:52:35.100]   So dopamine drives you to go out and look for things.
[00:52:35.100 --> 00:52:37.500]   And then let's say you find a couple berries
[00:52:37.500 --> 00:52:39.500]   and these ones are rotten, these ones are good.
[00:52:39.500 --> 00:52:41.640]   Maybe you hunt an animal and kill it,
[00:52:41.640 --> 00:52:43.660]   or you find an animal that was recently killed
[00:52:43.660 --> 00:52:45.260]   and you decide to take the meat.
[00:52:45.260 --> 00:52:48.720]   You are going to achieve, or I should say,
[00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:51.560]   experience some sort of dopamine release.
[00:52:51.560 --> 00:52:53.980]   You found the reward, that's great,
[00:52:53.980 --> 00:52:57.480]   but then it needs to return to some lower level.
[00:52:57.480 --> 00:52:58.320]   Why?
[00:52:58.320 --> 00:53:00.380]   Well, because if you just stayed there,
[00:53:00.380 --> 00:53:02.620]   you would never continue to forage for more.
[00:53:02.620 --> 00:53:06.720]   It doesn't just increase your baseline and then stay there,
[00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:08.240]   it goes back down.
[00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:09.860]   And what's very important to understand
[00:53:09.860 --> 00:53:11.460]   is that it doesn't just go back down
[00:53:11.460 --> 00:53:13.500]   to the level it was before,
[00:53:13.500 --> 00:53:16.720]   it goes down to a level below what it was
[00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:19.020]   before you went out seeking that thing.
[00:53:19.020 --> 00:53:20.940]   Now, this is counterintuitive.
[00:53:20.940 --> 00:53:24.340]   We often think, oh, okay, I'm going to pursue the win, right?
[00:53:24.340 --> 00:53:26.420]   Let's move this to modern day.
[00:53:26.420 --> 00:53:28.500]   I'm going to run this marathon,
[00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:29.700]   I'm going to train for this marathon.
[00:53:29.700 --> 00:53:32.200]   Then you run the marathon and you finish,
[00:53:32.200 --> 00:53:34.460]   you cross the finish line, you feel great.
[00:53:34.460 --> 00:53:37.180]   And you would think, okay, now I'm set for the entire year.
[00:53:37.180 --> 00:53:38.200]   I'm going to feel so much better.
[00:53:38.200 --> 00:53:40.140]   I'm going to feel this accomplishment in my body.
[00:53:40.140 --> 00:53:41.460]   It's going to be so great.
[00:53:41.460 --> 00:53:42.900]   That's not what happens.
[00:53:42.900 --> 00:53:44.320]   You might feel some of those things,
[00:53:44.320 --> 00:53:45.900]   but your level of dopamine
[00:53:45.900 --> 00:53:48.460]   has actually dropped below baseline.
[00:53:48.460 --> 00:53:51.320]   Now, eventually it will ratchet back up.
[00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:52.700]   But two things are really important.
[00:53:52.700 --> 00:53:55.800]   First of all, the extent to which it drops below baseline
[00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:59.020]   is proportional to how high the peak was.
[00:53:59.020 --> 00:54:02.700]   So if you cross the finish line pretty happy,
[00:54:02.700 --> 00:54:05.980]   it won't drop that much below baseline afterward.
[00:54:05.980 --> 00:54:08.940]   If you cross the finish line ecstatic,
[00:54:08.940 --> 00:54:10.140]   well, a day or two later,
[00:54:10.140 --> 00:54:12.360]   you're going to feel quite a bit lower
[00:54:12.360 --> 00:54:13.380]   than you would otherwise.
[00:54:13.380 --> 00:54:14.480]   You might not be depressed
[00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:17.180]   because it depends on where that baseline was to begin with.
[00:54:17.180 --> 00:54:19.060]   But the so-called postpartum depression
[00:54:19.060 --> 00:54:21.700]   that people experience after giving birth
[00:54:21.700 --> 00:54:25.620]   or after some big win, a graduation,
[00:54:25.620 --> 00:54:27.620]   or any kind of celebration,
[00:54:27.620 --> 00:54:32.260]   that postpartum drop in mood and affect and motivation
[00:54:32.260 --> 00:54:35.060]   is the drop in baseline dopamine.
[00:54:35.060 --> 00:54:36.380]   This is very important to understand
[00:54:36.380 --> 00:54:38.740]   because this happens on very rapid timescales
[00:54:38.740 --> 00:54:40.640]   and it can last quite a long time.
[00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:44.620]   It also explains the behavior
[00:54:44.620 --> 00:54:46.100]   that most of us are familiar with
[00:54:46.100 --> 00:54:48.220]   of engaging in something that we really enjoy,
[00:54:48.220 --> 00:54:51.060]   going to a restaurant that we absolutely love
[00:54:51.060 --> 00:54:53.140]   or engaging in some way with some person
[00:54:53.140 --> 00:54:55.220]   that we really, really enjoy.
[00:54:55.220 --> 00:54:57.300]   But if we continue to engage in that behavior
[00:54:57.300 --> 00:55:01.180]   over and over again, it kind of loses its edge.
[00:55:01.180 --> 00:55:05.300]   It starts to kind of feel less exciting to us.
[00:55:05.300 --> 00:55:10.100]   Some of us experience that drop in excitement
[00:55:10.100 --> 00:55:12.860]   more quickly and more severely than others,
[00:55:12.860 --> 00:55:16.360]   but everyone experiences that to some extent.
[00:55:16.360 --> 00:55:18.860]   And this has direct roots
[00:55:18.860 --> 00:55:22.180]   in these evolutionarily conserved circuits.
[00:55:22.180 --> 00:55:23.620]   Some of you may be hearing this and think,
[00:55:23.620 --> 00:55:25.500]   "No, no, no, that's not how it works for me.
[00:55:25.500 --> 00:55:27.540]   I'm just riding higher and higher all the time.
[00:55:27.540 --> 00:55:29.420]   I love my kids. I love my job.
[00:55:29.420 --> 00:55:31.100]   I love school. I love wins.
[00:55:31.100 --> 00:55:33.020]   I don't want losses."
[00:55:33.020 --> 00:55:33.860]   I agree.
[00:55:33.860 --> 00:55:37.460]   We all feel good when we are achieving things,
[00:55:37.460 --> 00:55:40.120]   but oftentimes we are feeling good
[00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:43.880]   because we are layering in different aspects of life,
[00:55:43.880 --> 00:55:46.460]   consuming things and doing things that increase our dopamine.
[00:55:46.460 --> 00:55:48.240]   We're getting those peaks.
[00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:52.720]   But afterward, the drop in baseline occurs
[00:55:52.720 --> 00:55:54.680]   and it always takes a little while
[00:55:54.680 --> 00:55:58.160]   to get back to our stable baseline.
[00:55:58.160 --> 00:56:01.520]   We really all have a sort of dopamine set point.
[00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:04.800]   And if we continue to indulge in the same behaviors
[00:56:04.800 --> 00:56:07.420]   or even different behaviors that increase our dopamine
[00:56:07.420 --> 00:56:10.000]   in these big peaks over and over and over again,
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:12.560]   we won't experience the same level of joy
[00:56:12.560 --> 00:56:16.360]   from those behaviors or from anything at all.
[00:56:16.360 --> 00:56:18.580]   Now that has a name, it's called addiction,
[00:56:18.580 --> 00:56:22.000]   but even for people who aren't addicted,
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:23.980]   even for people don't have an attachment
[00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:26.360]   to any specific substance or behavior,
[00:56:26.360 --> 00:56:30.160]   this drop in below baseline after any peak in dopamine
[00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:33.240]   is substantial and it governs whether or not
[00:56:33.240 --> 00:56:34.340]   we are going to feel motivated
[00:56:34.340 --> 00:56:36.960]   to continue to pursue other things.
[00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:39.880]   Fortunately, there's a way to work with this.
[00:56:39.880 --> 00:56:42.120]   Such that we can constantly stay motivated,
[00:56:42.120 --> 00:56:44.440]   but also keep that baseline of dopamine
[00:56:44.440 --> 00:56:46.380]   at an appropriate healthy level.
[00:56:46.380 --> 00:56:48.700]   A previous guest on the Huberman Lab podcast
[00:56:48.700 --> 00:56:49.880]   was Dr. Anna Lemke.
[00:56:49.880 --> 00:56:52.660]   She's head of the Addiction Dual Diagnosis Clinic
[00:56:52.660 --> 00:56:56.140]   at Stanford, has this amazing book, "Dopamine Nation,
[00:56:56.140 --> 00:56:58.020]   Finding Balance in the Age of Indulgence."
[00:56:58.020 --> 00:56:59.040]   If you haven't read the book,
[00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:02.000]   I highly encourage you to check it out, it's fantastic.
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:03.980]   The other terrific book about dopamine
[00:57:03.980 --> 00:57:05.520]   is "The Molecule of More,"
[00:57:05.520 --> 00:57:08.000]   which is similar in some regard,
[00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:09.440]   but isn't so much about addiction,
[00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:11.840]   it's more about other types of behaviors.
[00:57:11.840 --> 00:57:15.520]   Both books really focus on these dopamine schedules
[00:57:15.520 --> 00:57:17.160]   and the relationship between these peaks
[00:57:17.160 --> 00:57:18.560]   and baselines of dopamine.
[00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:21.480]   In Dr. Lemke's book,
[00:57:21.480 --> 00:57:23.320]   and when she was on the Huberman Lab podcast,
[00:57:23.320 --> 00:57:24.160]   another podcast,
[00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:26.040]   she's talked about this pleasure-pain balance
[00:57:26.040 --> 00:57:28.780]   that when we seek something that we really like,
[00:57:28.780 --> 00:57:29.620]   or we indulge in it,
[00:57:29.620 --> 00:57:31.160]   like eating a little piece of chocolate,
[00:57:31.160 --> 00:57:33.540]   if we really like chocolate, there's some pleasure,
[00:57:33.540 --> 00:57:37.080]   but then there's a little bit of pain
[00:57:37.080 --> 00:57:38.680]   that exceeds the amount of pleasure.
[00:57:38.680 --> 00:57:41.560]   And it's subtle and we experience it
[00:57:41.560 --> 00:57:43.700]   as wanting more of that thing.
[00:57:43.700 --> 00:57:45.760]   Okay, so there's a pleasure-pain balance,
[00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:48.640]   and I'm telling you that the pleasure and the pain
[00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:50.680]   are governed by dopamine to some extent.
[00:57:50.680 --> 00:57:52.080]   Well, how could that be, right?
[00:57:52.080 --> 00:57:54.880]   I said before, when you engage in an activity
[00:57:54.880 --> 00:57:57.580]   or when you ingest something that increases dopamine,
[00:57:57.580 --> 00:58:00.320]   the dopamine levels go up to a substantial degree
[00:58:00.320 --> 00:58:02.240]   with all the things I listed off.
[00:58:02.240 --> 00:58:06.080]   Where's the pain coming from?
[00:58:06.080 --> 00:58:09.080]   Well, the pain is coming from the lack of dopamine
[00:58:09.080 --> 00:58:10.940]   that follows,
[00:58:10.940 --> 00:58:15.940]   and you now know what that lack of dopamine reflects.
[00:58:15.940 --> 00:58:17.080]   How do you know?
[00:58:17.080 --> 00:58:18.660]   Well, earlier we were talking about
[00:58:18.660 --> 00:58:22.040]   how dopamine is released between neurons,
[00:58:22.040 --> 00:58:23.080]   and I mentioned two ways.
[00:58:23.080 --> 00:58:24.460]   One is into the synapse
[00:58:24.460 --> 00:58:26.720]   where it can activate the postsynaptic neuron,
[00:58:26.720 --> 00:58:28.760]   and the other was what I called volumetric release
[00:58:28.760 --> 00:58:31.000]   where it is distributed more broadly.
[00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:33.660]   It's released out over a bunch of neurons.
[00:58:35.240 --> 00:58:37.960]   In both cases, it's released from these things
[00:58:37.960 --> 00:58:40.800]   we call synaptic vesicles, literally little bubbles,
[00:58:40.800 --> 00:58:43.760]   tiny, tiny little bubbles that contain dopamine.
[00:58:43.760 --> 00:58:47.580]   They get vomited out into the area or into the synapse.
[00:58:47.580 --> 00:58:50.680]   Well, those vesicles get depleted.
[00:58:50.680 --> 00:58:54.400]   For the synaptic physiologists out there,
[00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:58.900]   we call this the readily releasable pool of dopamine.
[00:58:58.900 --> 00:59:03.080]   We can only deploy dopamine that is ready to be deployed,
[00:59:03.080 --> 00:59:04.720]   that's packaged in those little vesicles
[00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:05.560]   and ready to go.
[00:59:05.560 --> 00:59:07.240]   It's like when you order a product
[00:59:07.240 --> 00:59:10.520]   and they say out of stock until two months from now,
[00:59:10.520 --> 00:59:12.320]   well, it's not ready to be released.
[00:59:12.320 --> 00:59:13.220]   Same thing with dopamine.
[00:59:13.220 --> 00:59:16.420]   There's a pool of dopamine that's synthesized,
[00:59:16.420 --> 00:59:20.000]   and you can only release the dopamine
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:20.920]   that's been synthesized.
[00:59:20.920 --> 00:59:22.820]   It's the readily releasable pool.
[00:59:22.820 --> 00:59:27.000]   The pleasure pain balance doesn't only hinge
[00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:29.400]   on the readily releasable pool of dopamine,
[00:59:29.400 --> 00:59:33.160]   but a big part of the pleasure pain balance
[00:59:33.160 --> 00:59:36.620]   hinges on how much dopamine is there
[00:59:36.620 --> 00:59:38.680]   and how much is ready and capable
[00:59:38.680 --> 00:59:40.320]   of being released into the system.
[00:59:40.320 --> 00:59:44.960]   So now we've given some meat to this thing
[00:59:44.960 --> 00:59:47.240]   that we call the pleasure pain balance.
[00:59:47.240 --> 00:59:49.680]   And now it should make perfect sense
[00:59:49.680 --> 00:59:52.620]   why if you take something or do something
[00:59:52.620 --> 00:59:55.760]   that leads to huge increases in dopamine,
[00:59:55.760 --> 00:59:58.220]   afterward, your baseline should drop
[00:59:58.220 --> 01:00:00.960]   because there isn't a lot of dopamine around
[01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:02.740]   to keep your baseline going.
[01:00:03.460 --> 01:00:07.260]   Fortunately, most people do not experience
[01:00:07.260 --> 01:00:10.140]   or pursue enormous increases in dopamine
[01:00:10.140 --> 01:00:12.360]   leading to these severe drops in baseline.
[01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:17.880]   Many people do, however, and that's what we call addiction.
[01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:20.400]   When somebody pursues a drug or an activity
[01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:22.820]   that leads to huge increases in dopamine,
[01:00:22.820 --> 01:00:24.320]   and now you understand that afterward,
[01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:26.780]   the baseline of dopamine drops
[01:00:26.780 --> 01:00:28.660]   because of depletion of dopamine,
[01:00:28.660 --> 01:00:30.520]   the readily releasable pool,
[01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:33.320]   the dopamine is literally not around to be released,
[01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:35.640]   and so people feel pretty lousy.
[01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:37.520]   And many people make the mistake
[01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:41.040]   of then going and pursuing the dopamine evoking,
[01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:43.240]   the dopamine releasing activity or substance.
[01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:46.300]   Again, thinking mistakenly
[01:00:46.300 --> 01:00:48.080]   that it's going to bring up their baseline.
[01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:50.340]   It's going to give them that peak again.
[01:00:50.340 --> 01:00:52.020]   Not only does it not give them a peak,
[01:00:52.020 --> 01:00:54.200]   their baseline gets lower and lower
[01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:57.280]   because they're depleting dopamine more and more and more.
[01:00:57.280 --> 01:00:59.480]   And we've seen this over and over again
[01:00:59.480 --> 01:01:01.640]   when people get addicted to something,
[01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:04.380]   then they're not achieving much pleasure at all.
[01:01:04.380 --> 01:01:08.240]   You can even see this with video games.
[01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:10.940]   People will play a video game, they love it,
[01:01:10.940 --> 01:01:12.580]   it's super exciting to them,
[01:01:12.580 --> 01:01:15.200]   and then they'll keep playing and playing and playing,
[01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:19.540]   and either one of two things happens, typically both.
[01:01:19.540 --> 01:01:22.360]   First of all, I always say addiction
[01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:23.720]   is a progressive narrowing
[01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:25.120]   of the things that bring you pleasure.
[01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:26.620]   So oftentimes what will happen is
[01:01:26.620 --> 01:01:30.080]   the person only has excitement and can achieve dopamine
[01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:33.700]   release to the same extent doing that behavior
[01:01:33.700 --> 01:01:35.140]   and not other behaviors.
[01:01:35.140 --> 01:01:37.560]   And so they start losing interest in school,
[01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:39.900]   they start losing interest in relationships,
[01:01:39.900 --> 01:01:42.300]   they start losing interest in fitness and wellbeing
[01:01:42.300 --> 01:01:44.980]   and depletes their life.
[01:01:44.980 --> 01:01:47.460]   And eventually what typically happens
[01:01:47.460 --> 01:01:50.220]   is they will stop getting dopamine release
[01:01:50.220 --> 01:01:52.260]   from that activity as well,
[01:01:52.260 --> 01:01:55.120]   and then they drop into a pretty serious depression.
[01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:57.320]   And this can get very severe and people have committed
[01:01:57.320 --> 01:02:01.680]   suicide from these sorts of patterns of activity.
[01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:04.200]   But what about the more typical scenario?
[01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:06.640]   What about the scenario of somebody
[01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:10.080]   who is really good at working during the week,
[01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:13.680]   they exercise during the week, they drink on the weekends?
[01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:16.200]   Well, that person is only consuming alcohol
[01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:17.980]   maybe one or two nights a week,
[01:02:17.980 --> 01:02:20.640]   but oftentimes that same person
[01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:23.280]   will be spiking their dopamine
[01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:25.360]   with food during the middle of the week.
[01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:26.480]   Now we all have to eat
[01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:28.280]   and it's nice to eat foods that we enjoy.
[01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:29.440]   I certainly do that.
[01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:31.380]   I love food in fact,
[01:02:31.380 --> 01:02:34.300]   but let's say they're eating foods
[01:02:34.300 --> 01:02:36.180]   that really evoke a lot of dopamine release
[01:02:36.180 --> 01:02:37.160]   in the middle of the week,
[01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:39.760]   they're drinking one or two days on the weekend,
[01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:42.560]   they are one of these work hard, play hard types.
[01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:45.320]   So they're swimming a couple miles in the ocean
[01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:48.140]   in the middle of the week as well.
[01:02:48.140 --> 01:02:49.920]   They're going out dancing once on the weekend,
[01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:53.360]   sounds like a pretty balanced life as I describe it.
[01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:55.180]   Well, here's the problem.
[01:02:55.180 --> 01:02:59.200]   The problem is that dopamine
[01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:01.520]   is not just evoked by one of these activities,
[01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:04.280]   dopamine is evoked by all of these activities.
[01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:08.900]   And dopamine is one currency of craving motivation
[01:03:08.900 --> 01:03:11.240]   and desire and pleasure.
[01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:13.480]   There's only one currency.
[01:03:13.480 --> 01:03:16.760]   So even though if you look at the activities,
[01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:18.480]   you'd say, well, it's just on the weekends
[01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:21.340]   or this thing is only a couple of times a week.
[01:03:21.340 --> 01:03:23.840]   If you looked at dopamine simply as a function,
[01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:26.940]   as a chemical function of peaks and baseline,
[01:03:26.940 --> 01:03:28.480]   it might make sense why this person,
[01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:31.460]   after several years of work hard, play hard,
[01:03:31.460 --> 01:03:34.120]   would say, yeah, you know, I'm feeling kind of burnt out.
[01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:35.840]   I'm just not feeling like I have the same energy
[01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:37.360]   that I did a few years ago.
[01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:39.280]   And of course there are age-related reasons
[01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:42.400]   why people can experience drops in energy,
[01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:45.200]   but oftentimes what's happening
[01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:48.100]   is not some sort of depletion in cellular metabolism
[01:03:48.100 --> 01:03:49.080]   that's related to aging.
[01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:51.420]   What's happening is they're spiking their dopamine
[01:03:51.420 --> 01:03:54.760]   through so many different activities throughout the week
[01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:57.200]   that their baseline is progressively dropping.
[01:03:57.200 --> 01:03:59.540]   And in this case, it can be very subtle.
[01:03:59.540 --> 01:04:00.880]   It can be very, very subtle.
[01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:05.880]   And that's actually a very sinister function of dopamine,
[01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:08.840]   we could say, which is that it can often drop
[01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:10.740]   in imperceptible ways,
[01:04:10.740 --> 01:04:15.360]   but then once it reaches a threshold of low dopamine,
[01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:16.480]   we just feel like, hmm,
[01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:18.600]   we can't really get pleasure from anything anymore.
[01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:20.460]   What used to work doesn't work anymore.
[01:04:20.460 --> 01:04:23.100]   So it starts to look a lot like the more severe addictions
[01:04:23.100 --> 01:04:25.000]   or the more acute addictions
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:26.620]   to things like cocaine and amphetamine,
[01:04:26.620 --> 01:04:28.380]   which lead to these big increases,
[01:04:28.380 --> 01:04:29.620]   these big spikes in dopamine,
[01:04:29.620 --> 01:04:33.380]   and then these very severe drops in the baseline.
[01:04:33.380 --> 01:04:36.980]   Now, of course, we all should engage in activities
[01:04:36.980 --> 01:04:38.240]   that we enjoy.
[01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:39.820]   I certainly do, everybody should.
[01:04:39.820 --> 01:04:42.160]   A huge part of life is pursuing activities
[01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:44.680]   and things that we enjoy.
[01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:47.240]   The key thing is to understand this relationship
[01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:48.640]   between the peaks and the baseline
[01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:50.920]   and to understand how they influence one another.
[01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:52.300]   Because once you do that,
[01:04:52.300 --> 01:04:55.320]   you can start to make really good choices in the short run
[01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:56.500]   and in the long run
[01:04:56.500 --> 01:04:59.860]   to maintain your level of dopamine baseline,
[01:04:59.860 --> 01:05:02.880]   maybe even raise that level of dopamine baseline,
[01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:04.760]   and still get those peaks
[01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:08.480]   and still achieve those feelings of elevated motivation,
[01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:10.000]   elevated desire and craving.
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.840]   Because again, those peaks
[01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:16.280]   and having a sufficiently healthy high level
[01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:17.720]   of dopamine baseline
[01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:19.380]   are what drove the evolution of our species.
[01:05:19.380 --> 01:05:20.740]   And they're really what drive the evolution
[01:05:20.740 --> 01:05:22.760]   of anyone's life progression too.
[01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:23.600]   So they're a good thing.
[01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:25.380]   Dopamine is a good thing.
[01:05:25.380 --> 01:05:26.220]   Just very briefly,
[01:05:26.220 --> 01:05:28.800]   because it was also covered in the interview episode
[01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:32.480]   I did with Anna Lemke about addiction.
[01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:34.160]   Some of you might be asking,
[01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:36.600]   what should I do if I experience a drop
[01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:38.820]   in my baseline level of dopamine
[01:05:38.820 --> 01:05:41.600]   because of engagement with some activity
[01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:44.080]   or some substance that led to big peaks?
[01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:48.120]   Just to put some color and example on this,
[01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:49.080]   a few episodes ago,
[01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:52.360]   I talked about a friend who I've known a long time.
[01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:53.920]   So actually the child of a friend
[01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:57.520]   who has basically become addicted to video games.
[01:05:57.520 --> 01:06:00.200]   He decided actually after seeing that episode with Anna
[01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:04.400]   to do a 30 day complete fast from phone,
[01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:07.400]   from video games and from social media of all kinds.
[01:06:07.400 --> 01:06:08.880]   He's now at day 29.
[01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:11.000]   He's really accomplished this.
[01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.400]   Not incidentally, his levels of concentration,
[01:06:13.400 --> 01:06:14.520]   his overall mood are up.
[01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:16.880]   He's doing far, far better.
[01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:18.080]   What he did is hard.
[01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:20.600]   In particular, the first 14 days is really hard.
[01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:23.920]   But the way that you replenish the releasable pool
[01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:25.880]   of dopamine is to not engage
[01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:29.080]   in these dopaminergic seeking behaviors.
[01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:31.840]   Because remember, typically people arrive at a place
[01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:34.080]   where they want to stop engaging in these behaviors
[01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:37.120]   or ingesting substances when that dopamine is depleted,
[01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:38.660]   when they're not getting the same lift.
[01:06:38.660 --> 01:06:40.240]   In his case, he was feeling depressed.
[01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:41.520]   He thought he had ADHD.
[01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:44.420]   They were starting to treat it as ADHD.
[01:06:44.420 --> 01:06:47.160]   And certainly there are people out there who have ADHD,
[01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:48.640]   but what he found was that his levels
[01:06:48.640 --> 01:06:49.680]   of concentration are back.
[01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:52.680]   He does not need to be treated for ADHD.
[01:06:52.680 --> 01:06:55.100]   And actually the psychiatrist wondered if he did prior
[01:06:55.100 --> 01:06:58.000]   to this video game social media fast.
[01:06:58.000 --> 01:06:58.880]   He's feeling good.
[01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:01.560]   He's exercising again, not making this up.
[01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:04.880]   This is really a very specific,
[01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:08.440]   but very relevant example of how the dopamine system
[01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:10.640]   can replenish itself.
[01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:13.180]   Of course, if there's a clinical need for ADHD treatment,
[01:07:13.180 --> 01:07:14.700]   by all means, pursue that.
[01:07:14.700 --> 01:07:19.320]   But I think a lot of ADHD does go misdiagnosed
[01:07:19.320 --> 01:07:21.900]   because of this depletion in dopamine that occurs
[01:07:21.900 --> 01:07:23.980]   because of overindulgence and other activities
[01:07:23.980 --> 01:07:25.640]   in the drop in baseline.
[01:07:25.640 --> 01:07:28.720]   So for anyone that's experienced a real drop in baseline
[01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:31.180]   who has addictive tendencies,
[01:07:31.180 --> 01:07:32.840]   whether or not their behaviors are substances,
[01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:36.980]   that is always going to be the path forward,
[01:07:36.980 --> 01:07:38.880]   is going to be either cold Turkey
[01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:42.780]   or through some sort of tapering to limit interactions
[01:07:42.780 --> 01:07:46.400]   with what would otherwise be the dopamine evoking behavior
[01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:47.400]   or substance.
[01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:51.920]   So let's talk about the optimal way to engage in activities
[01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:55.680]   or to consume things that evoke dopamine.
[01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:57.300]   And by no means am I encouraging people
[01:07:57.300 --> 01:07:58.360]   to take drugs of abuse.
[01:07:58.360 --> 01:07:59.280]   I would not do that.
[01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:00.540]   I am not doing that.
[01:08:00.540 --> 01:08:03.180]   But some of the things on these lists
[01:08:03.180 --> 01:08:07.160]   of dopamine evoking activities are things like chocolate,
[01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:11.960]   coffee, even if it's indirect, sex and reproduction,
[01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:15.080]   provided it's healthy, consensual, context appropriate,
[01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:17.440]   age appropriate, species appropriate, of course,
[01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:21.800]   is central to our evolution and progression as a species.
[01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:24.760]   So certain things like cocaine, amphetamine,
[01:08:24.760 --> 01:08:26.880]   I will put in the classification of bad.
[01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:27.720]   I'm willing to do that.
[01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:31.200]   And other things are part of life, food, exercise.
[01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:32.560]   If that evokes your dopamine,
[01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:33.840]   how are we supposed to engage
[01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:37.000]   with these dopamine evoking activities in ways
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:38.520]   that are healthy and beneficial for us?
[01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:40.240]   How do we achieve these peaks,
[01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:43.020]   which are so central to our wellbeing and experience of life
[01:08:43.020 --> 01:08:45.040]   without dropping our baseline?
[01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:50.040]   And the key lies in intermittent release of dopamine.
[01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:55.260]   The real key is to not expect or chase high levels
[01:08:55.260 --> 01:08:58.760]   of dopamine release every time we engage
[01:08:58.760 --> 01:08:59.980]   in these activities.
[01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:05.160]   Intermittent reward schedules are the central schedule
[01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:08.800]   by which casinos keep you gambling,
[01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:12.360]   the central schedule by which elusive partners
[01:09:12.360 --> 01:09:15.200]   or potential partners keep you texting and pursuing
[01:09:15.200 --> 01:09:18.680]   on either side of the relationship.
[01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:22.040]   Intermittent schedules are the way that the internet
[01:09:22.040 --> 01:09:27.040]   and social media and all highly engaging activities
[01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:31.400]   keep you motivated and pursuing.
[01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:32.720]   And we can take this back
[01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:36.260]   to our evolutionary adaptive scenario,
[01:09:36.260 --> 01:09:38.360]   where you are out there looking for water,
[01:09:38.360 --> 01:09:42.820]   looking for food, not every trail, not every pursuit,
[01:09:42.820 --> 01:09:46.640]   not every hunch about where the animals will be,
[01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:49.800]   where the food will be, where the berries will be,
[01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:51.860]   not every single one of those played out.
[01:09:51.860 --> 01:09:56.560]   There's something called dopamine reward prediction error.
[01:09:56.560 --> 01:09:58.880]   When we expect something to happen,
[01:09:58.880 --> 01:10:01.500]   we are highly motivated to pursue it.
[01:10:01.500 --> 01:10:04.720]   If it happens, great, we get the reward.
[01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:06.640]   The reward comes in various chemical forms,
[01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:09.480]   including dopamine, and we are more likely to engage
[01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:11.020]   in that behavior again.
[01:10:11.020 --> 01:10:13.560]   This is the basis of casino gambling.
[01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:15.480]   This is how they keep you going back again and again
[01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:19.060]   and again, even though on average, the house really does win.
[01:10:19.060 --> 01:10:22.440]   You can transplant that example
[01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:24.660]   to any number of different pleasureful activities.
[01:10:24.660 --> 01:10:27.140]   If you're not a gambler and that doesn't appeal to you,
[01:10:27.140 --> 01:10:29.340]   I have to imagine there's something that appeals to you,
[01:10:29.340 --> 01:10:31.940]   something that you do repeatedly because you enjoy it.
[01:10:31.940 --> 01:10:34.220]   And almost inevitably it's because
[01:10:34.220 --> 01:10:36.160]   there's an intermittent schedule.
[01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:40.000]   There's a intermittent schedule by which dopamine
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.100]   sometimes arrives, sometimes a little bit,
[01:10:42.100 --> 01:10:45.860]   sometimes a lot, sometimes a medium amount, okay?
[01:10:45.860 --> 01:10:48.200]   That intermittent reinforcement schedule
[01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:53.200]   is actually the best schedule to export to other activities.
[01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:54.940]   How do you do that?
[01:10:54.940 --> 01:10:59.480]   Well, first of all, if you are engaged in activities,
[01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:01.760]   school, sport, relationship, et cetera,
[01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:04.120]   where you experience a win,
[01:11:04.120 --> 01:11:06.820]   you should be very careful about allowing yourself
[01:11:06.820 --> 01:11:09.120]   to experience huge peaks in dopamine,
[01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:12.520]   unless you're willing to suffer the crash that follows
[01:11:12.520 --> 01:11:17.060]   and waiting a period of time for it to come back up.
[01:11:17.060 --> 01:11:18.960]   What would this look like in the practical sense?
[01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:20.200]   Well, let's say you are somebody
[01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:22.360]   who really does enjoy exercise,
[01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:24.640]   or let's say you're somebody who kind of likes exercise,
[01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:26.280]   but forces yourself to do it,
[01:11:26.280 --> 01:11:28.520]   but you make it pleasureful by giving yourself
[01:11:28.520 --> 01:11:30.460]   your favorite cup of coffee first,
[01:11:30.460 --> 01:11:32.520]   or maybe taking a pre-workout drink,
[01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:34.120]   or taking an energy drink,
[01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:35.640]   or listening to your favorite music,
[01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:37.440]   and then you're in the gym and you're listening to your music
[01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:39.080]   that all sounds great, right?
[01:11:39.080 --> 01:11:42.260]   Well, it is great, except that by layering together
[01:11:42.260 --> 01:11:44.800]   all these things to try and achieve that dopamine release,
[01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:46.780]   and by getting a big peak in dopamine,
[01:11:46.780 --> 01:11:50.920]   you're actually increasing the number of conditions required
[01:11:50.920 --> 01:11:53.560]   to achieve pleasure from that activity again.
[01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:55.800]   And so there is a form of this
[01:11:55.800 --> 01:11:58.200]   where sometimes you do all the things that you love
[01:11:58.200 --> 01:11:59.360]   to get the optimal workout.
[01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:00.860]   You listen to your favorite music,
[01:12:00.860 --> 01:12:02.600]   you go at your favorite time of day,
[01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:04.520]   you have your pre-workout drink if that's your thing,
[01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:08.280]   you do all the things that give you that best experience
[01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:09.860]   of the workout for you.
[01:12:09.860 --> 01:12:12.620]   But there's also a version of this
[01:12:12.620 --> 01:12:14.960]   where sometimes you don't do
[01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:17.180]   the dopamine enhancing activities.
[01:12:17.180 --> 01:12:19.840]   You don't ingest anything to increase your dopamine.
[01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:22.800]   You just do the exercise.
[01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:27.380]   You don't do the exercise and expect dopamine to arrive
[01:12:27.380 --> 01:12:30.520]   through some what we call exogenous source as well.
[01:12:30.520 --> 01:12:31.880]   You might think, well, that sounds lame.
[01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:35.000]   I want to continue to enjoy exercising.
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:36.840]   Ah, but that's exactly the point.
[01:12:36.840 --> 01:12:39.960]   If you want to maintain motivation for school,
[01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:44.120]   exercise, relationships, or pursuits of any duration in kind,
[01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:47.720]   the key thing is to make sure that the peak in dopamine,
[01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:50.440]   if it's very high, doesn't occur too often.
[01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:54.380]   And if something does occur very often,
[01:12:54.380 --> 01:12:56.840]   that you vary how much dopamine you experience
[01:12:56.840 --> 01:13:00.260]   with each engagement in that activity.
[01:13:00.260 --> 01:13:02.500]   Now, some activities naturally have
[01:13:02.500 --> 01:13:05.240]   this intermittent property woven into them, right?
[01:13:05.240 --> 01:13:07.920]   We sometimes have classes that we like
[01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:09.360]   and other classes we don't like.
[01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:11.360]   We don't always get straight A's.
[01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:13.000]   Sometimes we don't get rewarded
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:14.720]   with the outcome that we would like.
[01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:18.000]   We don't always have the perfect relationship outcome,
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.640]   but understand that your ability to experience
[01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:23.520]   motivation and pleasure for what comes next
[01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:25.960]   is dictated by how much motivation and pleasure
[01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:28.260]   and dopamine you experienced prior.
[01:13:28.260 --> 01:13:32.420]   The reason I can't give a very specific protocol
[01:13:32.420 --> 01:13:36.020]   like delete dopamine or lower dopamine every third time
[01:13:36.020 --> 01:13:38.200]   is that that wouldn't be intermittent.
[01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:40.680]   The whole basis of intermittent reinforcement
[01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:44.460]   is that you don't really have a specific schedule
[01:13:44.460 --> 01:13:46.560]   of when dopamine is going to be high
[01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:48.020]   and when dopamine is going to be low
[01:13:48.020 --> 01:13:49.840]   and when dopamine is going to be medium.
[01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:51.320]   That's a predictable schedule,
[01:13:51.320 --> 01:13:53.920]   not a random intermittent schedule.
[01:13:53.920 --> 01:13:57.200]   So do like the casinos do, certainly works for them.
[01:13:57.200 --> 01:14:00.000]   And for activities that you would like to continue
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:03.960]   to engage in over time, whatever those happen to be,
[01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:07.120]   start paying attention to the amount of dopamine
[01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:09.320]   and excitement and pleasure that you achieve with those
[01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:11.980]   and start modulating that somewhat at random.
[01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:15.040]   That might be removing some of the dopamine
[01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:18.100]   releasing chemicals that you might take prior.
[01:14:18.100 --> 01:14:21.020]   Maybe you remove them every time,
[01:14:21.020 --> 01:14:23.540]   but then every once in a while you introduce them.
[01:14:23.540 --> 01:14:27.460]   Maybe it involves sometimes doing things socially
[01:14:27.460 --> 01:14:28.580]   that you enjoy doing socially,
[01:14:28.580 --> 01:14:30.780]   sometimes doing the same thing, but alone.
[01:14:30.780 --> 01:14:34.180]   There are a lot of different ways to do this.
[01:14:34.180 --> 01:14:36.240]   There are a lot of different ways to approach this,
[01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:38.860]   but now knowing what you know about peaks
[01:14:38.860 --> 01:14:41.660]   and baselines in dopamine and understanding
[01:14:41.660 --> 01:14:43.940]   how important it is not just to achieve peaks,
[01:14:43.940 --> 01:14:46.380]   but to maintain that baseline at a healthy level,
[01:14:46.380 --> 01:14:48.500]   it should be straightforward for you to implement
[01:14:48.500 --> 01:14:49.980]   these intermittent schedules.
[01:14:49.980 --> 01:14:54.320]   For those of you that are begging for more specificity,
[01:14:54.320 --> 01:14:55.740]   we can give you a tool.
[01:14:55.740 --> 01:14:59.240]   One would be you can flip a coin before engaging
[01:14:59.240 --> 01:15:01.820]   in any of these types of activities and decide whether
[01:15:01.820 --> 01:15:06.300]   or not you are going to allow other dopamine supportive
[01:15:06.300 --> 01:15:09.540]   elements to go, for instance, into the gym with you.
[01:15:09.540 --> 01:15:10.980]   Are you going to listen to music or not?
[01:15:10.980 --> 01:15:13.620]   If you enjoy listening to music, well then flip a coin.
[01:15:13.620 --> 01:15:15.400]   And if it comes up heads, bring the music in.
[01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:17.820]   If it comes up tails, don't, okay?
[01:15:17.820 --> 01:15:19.940]   Sounds like you're undercutting your own progress,
[01:15:19.940 --> 01:15:23.040]   but actually you are serving your own progress,
[01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:25.740]   both short-term and long-term by doing that.
[01:15:25.740 --> 01:15:29.020]   Now, the smartphone is a very interesting tool
[01:15:29.020 --> 01:15:30.980]   for dopamine in light of all this.
[01:15:30.980 --> 01:15:35.160]   It's extremely common nowadays to see people texting
[01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:39.180]   and doing selfies and communicating in various ways,
[01:15:39.180 --> 01:15:41.660]   listening to podcasts, listening to music,
[01:15:41.660 --> 01:15:43.620]   doing all sorts of things while they engage
[01:15:43.620 --> 01:15:45.760]   in other activities or going to dinner and texting
[01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:48.800]   other people or making plans, sharing information.
[01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:49.640]   That's all wonderful.
[01:15:49.640 --> 01:15:52.540]   It gives depth and richness and color to life,
[01:15:52.540 --> 01:15:56.900]   but it isn't just about our distracted nature
[01:15:56.900 --> 01:15:59.440]   when we're engaging with the phone.
[01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:02.300]   It's also a way of layering in dopamine.
[01:16:02.300 --> 01:16:06.660]   And it's no surprise that levels of depression
[01:16:06.660 --> 01:16:09.680]   and lack of motivation are really on the increase.
[01:16:11.180 --> 01:16:15.420]   Everything that we've talked about until now sets up
[01:16:15.420 --> 01:16:17.540]   an explanation or an interpretation
[01:16:17.540 --> 01:16:21.220]   of why interacting with digital technology
[01:16:21.220 --> 01:16:23.420]   can potentially lead to disruptions
[01:16:23.420 --> 01:16:26.960]   or lowering in baseline levels of dopamine.
[01:16:26.960 --> 01:16:30.620]   I can use a personal example for this.
[01:16:30.620 --> 01:16:32.220]   I happen to really enjoy working out.
[01:16:32.220 --> 01:16:33.900]   I've always really enjoyed it.
[01:16:33.900 --> 01:16:38.020]   But in recent years, I noticed that if I was bringing
[01:16:38.020 --> 01:16:39.780]   my phone to my workouts,
[01:16:39.780 --> 01:16:41.980]   then not only was I a little bit more distracted
[01:16:41.980 --> 01:16:43.580]   and not focusing on what I was doing
[01:16:43.580 --> 01:16:45.800]   as much as I could have or should have,
[01:16:45.800 --> 01:16:49.380]   but also I started to lose interest in what I was doing.
[01:16:49.380 --> 01:16:50.820]   It wasn't as pleasureful.
[01:16:50.820 --> 01:16:53.680]   I would feel like it just didn't have the same kind of oomph
[01:16:53.680 --> 01:16:55.980]   and I was beginning to question my motivation.
[01:16:55.980 --> 01:16:59.620]   As I started learning more about this relationship
[01:16:59.620 --> 01:17:02.020]   between the peaks and the baselines and dopamine,
[01:17:02.020 --> 01:17:04.380]   what I realized was that some time ago,
[01:17:04.380 --> 01:17:07.560]   I probably experienced a incredible increase
[01:17:07.560 --> 01:17:09.900]   in the amount of dopamine during one of my workouts
[01:17:09.900 --> 01:17:13.760]   because I enjoy working out and I enjoy listening to music.
[01:17:13.760 --> 01:17:15.280]   I also enjoy listening to podcasts.
[01:17:15.280 --> 01:17:17.360]   I also enjoy communicating with people.
[01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:18.700]   Those are all wonderful pursuits,
[01:17:18.700 --> 01:17:22.540]   but I had layered in too many of them too many times.
[01:17:22.540 --> 01:17:25.940]   And then it essentially wasn't working for me anymore,
[01:17:25.940 --> 01:17:28.140]   much in the same way a drug wouldn't work for somebody
[01:17:28.140 --> 01:17:29.060]   who takes it repeatedly
[01:17:29.060 --> 01:17:31.520]   because their baseline of dopamine is dropping.
[01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:33.860]   So at least for this calendar year,
[01:17:33.860 --> 01:17:35.380]   I've made a rule for myself,
[01:17:35.380 --> 01:17:40.380]   which is I don't allow my phone into my workouts at all.
[01:17:40.380 --> 01:17:42.580]   No music, at least not from the phone.
[01:17:42.580 --> 01:17:43.640]   It can be in the room.
[01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:46.920]   I might listen to a podcast in the room,
[01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:49.060]   but I don't listen to anything
[01:17:49.060 --> 01:17:51.460]   or engage in anything on my phone, no texting whatsoever.
[01:17:51.460 --> 01:17:52.300]   And most of the time,
[01:17:52.300 --> 01:17:54.480]   I just don't even bring it with me for that period of time.
[01:17:54.480 --> 01:17:56.340]   It's only a short period of time.
[01:17:56.340 --> 01:17:58.000]   I'm not training that often.
[01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:03.940]   This is something that I think has been misinterpreted
[01:18:03.940 --> 01:18:06.380]   as people can't be alone now.
[01:18:06.380 --> 01:18:07.880]   People talk about, oh, you know,
[01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:10.180]   they can't walk across the street
[01:18:10.180 --> 01:18:13.320]   or they can't go anywhere, ride the bus,
[01:18:13.320 --> 01:18:15.720]   can't be on the plane without being in contact.
[01:18:15.720 --> 01:18:17.380]   They can't handle just their thoughts.
[01:18:17.380 --> 01:18:19.120]   I don't think that's really what's going on.
[01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:20.760]   I think what's happened is
[01:18:20.760 --> 01:18:23.780]   that we achieved the great dopamine increase
[01:18:23.780 --> 01:18:25.520]   that comes from this incredible thing,
[01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:28.620]   which I personally enjoy being able to communicate
[01:18:28.620 --> 01:18:30.700]   by phone, by text and exchange pictures
[01:18:30.700 --> 01:18:33.500]   and send links and these kinds of things, social media.
[01:18:33.500 --> 01:18:36.220]   But then what happens is it doesn't have
[01:18:36.220 --> 01:18:38.620]   that same fulfilling aspect to it.
[01:18:38.620 --> 01:18:41.260]   And it tends to remove the excitement
[01:18:41.260 --> 01:18:42.960]   and the pleasure of the very activities
[01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:44.640]   that we are engaged in.
[01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:46.860]   So I know this is a hard one for many people,
[01:18:46.860 --> 01:18:49.140]   but I do invite you to try
[01:18:49.140 --> 01:18:52.820]   removing multiple sources of dopamine release,
[01:18:52.820 --> 01:18:56.100]   or what used to be multiple sources of dopamine release
[01:18:56.100 --> 01:18:58.940]   from activities that you want to continue to enjoy
[01:18:58.940 --> 01:19:00.820]   or that you want to enjoy more.
[01:19:00.820 --> 01:19:03.000]   And now you understand the biological mechanisms
[01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.740]   that would underlie a statement like that.
[01:19:05.740 --> 01:19:07.820]   It takes a little bit of working with.
[01:19:07.820 --> 01:19:10.800]   I know it can be challenging in the first week or so
[01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:14.140]   of not engaging with the phone during any kind of workout.
[01:19:14.140 --> 01:19:16.020]   That actually was really tough.
[01:19:16.020 --> 01:19:18.960]   But now I'm back to a place where I enjoy it that much more.
[01:19:18.960 --> 01:19:20.540]   I also feel as if I conquered something
[01:19:20.540 --> 01:19:23.300]   in terms of the circuitry related to dopamine.
[01:19:23.300 --> 01:19:26.740]   I now understand why something that I enjoyed so much
[01:19:26.740 --> 01:19:29.420]   had become less pleasureful for me.
[01:19:29.420 --> 01:19:31.560]   And there's a deep, deep satisfaction
[01:19:31.560 --> 01:19:32.540]   that comes from understanding,
[01:19:32.540 --> 01:19:34.640]   okay, there wasn't anything wrong with me
[01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:38.440]   or what I was doing or anything at all.
[01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:39.440]   It was just,
[01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:41.360]   there was something wrong with the approach I was taking,
[01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:43.660]   which was layering in all these sources of dopamine
[01:19:43.660 --> 01:19:45.240]   and dropping my baseline.
[01:19:45.240 --> 01:19:46.600]   For this very same reason,
[01:19:46.600 --> 01:19:49.660]   I caution people against using stimulants
[01:19:49.660 --> 01:19:54.660]   every time they study or every time they work out
[01:19:54.660 --> 01:19:57.380]   or every time that they do anything
[01:19:57.380 --> 01:19:59.040]   that they would like to continue to enjoy
[01:19:59.040 --> 01:20:00.900]   and be motivated at.
[01:20:00.900 --> 01:20:02.660]   There's one exception, which is caffeine,
[01:20:02.660 --> 01:20:06.680]   because I mentioned before, if you like caffeine,
[01:20:06.680 --> 01:20:08.660]   that actually could be a good thing for your dopamine system
[01:20:08.660 --> 01:20:11.740]   because it does upregulate these D2, D3 receptors.
[01:20:11.740 --> 01:20:14.600]   So it actually makes whatever dopamine is released
[01:20:14.600 --> 01:20:18.340]   by that activity more accessible or more functional
[01:20:18.340 --> 01:20:20.900]   within the biochemistry and the pathways
[01:20:20.900 --> 01:20:22.060]   of your brain and body.
[01:20:22.060 --> 01:20:25.900]   However, a number of energy drinks
[01:20:25.900 --> 01:20:28.420]   and in particular pre-workouts contain things
[01:20:28.420 --> 01:20:30.580]   that are precursors to dopamine.
[01:20:30.580 --> 01:20:33.820]   And on their own, even if you didn't engage in the activity,
[01:20:33.820 --> 01:20:36.720]   would cause the release of dopamine to a substantial degree.
[01:20:36.720 --> 01:20:38.460]   They do cause the release of dopamine
[01:20:38.460 --> 01:20:40.060]   to a substantial degree.
[01:20:40.060 --> 01:20:44.080]   And over time, that will deplete your dopamine.
[01:20:44.080 --> 01:20:48.300]   So energy drinks, pre-workout drinks,
[01:20:48.300 --> 01:20:51.280]   drugs of various kinds that people take to study
[01:20:51.280 --> 01:20:52.120]   and pay attention.
[01:20:52.120 --> 01:20:54.060]   We talked about some of these for the ADHD episode,
[01:20:54.060 --> 01:20:58.300]   things like Adderall, Ritalin, Armadafinil, Modafinil.
[01:20:58.300 --> 01:21:00.580]   Taken repeatedly over time
[01:21:00.580 --> 01:21:03.640]   will reduce the level of satisfaction and joy
[01:21:03.640 --> 01:21:05.940]   that you get from the activities you engage in
[01:21:05.940 --> 01:21:10.060]   while under the influence of those compounds.
[01:21:10.060 --> 01:21:11.820]   I'm not trying to demonize those compounds
[01:21:11.820 --> 01:21:13.020]   for their clinical use.
[01:21:13.020 --> 01:21:14.860]   What I'm saying is taking stimulants
[01:21:14.860 --> 01:21:16.620]   and then engaging in activities
[01:21:16.620 --> 01:21:19.220]   that you would like to continue to feel pleasureful
[01:21:19.220 --> 01:21:20.920]   is undercutting the process.
[01:21:20.920 --> 01:21:23.660]   And inevitably, it might not happen tomorrow,
[01:21:23.660 --> 01:21:24.900]   might not happen in a month,
[01:21:24.900 --> 01:21:27.140]   but inevitably you will have challenges
[01:21:27.140 --> 01:21:30.500]   with motivation and drive related to those activities.
[01:21:30.500 --> 01:21:32.260]   Now, some people can keep it right in check.
[01:21:32.260 --> 01:21:34.760]   They can just do the one can of the energy drink
[01:21:34.760 --> 01:21:36.860]   or they only do their pre-workout
[01:21:36.860 --> 01:21:39.940]   before really hard days, for instance.
[01:21:39.940 --> 01:21:41.040]   More power to you.
[01:21:41.040 --> 01:21:44.780]   I actually do that sometimes, frankly.
[01:21:44.780 --> 01:21:47.460]   But people who are trying to get into that peak,
[01:21:47.460 --> 01:21:49.680]   super motivated, driven, driven state,
[01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:52.900]   really focused every time they engage in an activity,
[01:21:52.900 --> 01:21:55.220]   you are absolutely undercutting the process
[01:21:55.220 --> 01:21:57.780]   and you are undermining your ability to stay motivated
[01:21:57.780 --> 01:21:58.900]   and focused.
[01:21:58.900 --> 01:22:02.940]   So just as we talked about intermittent reward schedules
[01:22:02.940 --> 01:22:07.160]   a moment ago, intermittent spiking of dopamine,
[01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:10.260]   if you do it at all, is definitely the way to go.
[01:22:10.260 --> 01:22:12.980]   And chronically trying to spike your dopamine
[01:22:12.980 --> 01:22:15.900]   in order to enhance your motivation, focus, and drive
[01:22:15.900 --> 01:22:19.380]   will absolutely undermine your motivation, focus, and drive
[01:22:19.380 --> 01:22:20.460]   in the long run.
[01:22:20.460 --> 01:22:24.780]   Ingestion of caffeine is somewhat of an exception
[01:22:24.780 --> 01:22:27.420]   among the other examples of things I've mentioned
[01:22:27.420 --> 01:22:30.220]   to avoid before what would otherwise be
[01:22:30.220 --> 01:22:32.260]   dopamine-increasing activities.
[01:22:32.260 --> 01:22:37.260]   Because again, caffeine can increase the density
[01:22:37.260 --> 01:22:40.280]   and the efficacy of these dopamine receptors.
[01:22:40.280 --> 01:22:45.140]   Turns out that the source of caffeine could also matter.
[01:22:45.140 --> 01:22:48.860]   While coffee or tea or other forms of caffeine
[01:22:48.860 --> 01:22:51.700]   will have this effect of increasing dopamine receptors.
[01:22:52.660 --> 01:22:55.380]   Yerba mate, something I've talked about before
[01:22:55.380 --> 01:22:58.180]   on this podcast, has some interesting properties.
[01:22:58.180 --> 01:22:59.900]   First of all, it contains caffeine.
[01:22:59.900 --> 01:23:02.000]   It's also high in antioxidants.
[01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.640]   It also contains something called GLP-1,
[01:23:04.640 --> 01:23:07.780]   which is favorable for management of blood sugar levels.
[01:23:07.780 --> 01:23:12.980]   Yerba mate, it turns out, has also been shown
[01:23:12.980 --> 01:23:17.940]   to be neuroprotective specifically for dopaminergic neurons.
[01:23:17.940 --> 01:23:20.100]   Now I should mention this is just a couple of studies,
[01:23:20.100 --> 01:23:23.020]   so we don't want to conclude too much from these studies.
[01:23:23.020 --> 01:23:24.460]   More needs to be done.
[01:23:24.460 --> 01:23:27.780]   But they showed that in a model of damage
[01:23:27.780 --> 01:23:31.100]   to dopamine neurons, ingestion of yerba mate
[01:23:31.100 --> 01:23:33.300]   and some of the compounds within yerba mate
[01:23:33.300 --> 01:23:35.780]   can actually serve to preserve the survival
[01:23:35.780 --> 01:23:39.100]   of dopamine neurons in both the movement-related pathway
[01:23:39.100 --> 01:23:41.240]   and the motivation pathway.
[01:23:41.240 --> 01:23:44.100]   So perhaps you need that incentive
[01:23:44.100 --> 01:23:46.140]   in order to ingest yerba mate tea.
[01:23:46.140 --> 01:23:48.220]   Perhaps you don't need any incentive.
[01:23:48.220 --> 01:23:49.740]   In my case, I don't need any incentive.
[01:23:49.740 --> 01:23:53.220]   I already enjoy yerba mate as my principal source of caffeine
[01:23:53.220 --> 01:23:55.100]   although I do drink coffee as well.
[01:23:55.100 --> 01:23:57.860]   But if one were going to consume caffeine,
[01:23:57.860 --> 01:24:00.140]   you might consider consuming that caffeine
[01:24:00.140 --> 01:24:01.980]   in the form of yerba mate,
[01:24:01.980 --> 01:24:05.040]   both for sake of upregulating dopamine receptors
[01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:07.800]   and getting more of a dopamine increase.
[01:24:07.800 --> 01:24:10.380]   And of course, for the stimulant properties of caffeine,
[01:24:10.380 --> 01:24:12.520]   if that's what you're seeking.
[01:24:12.520 --> 01:24:13.980]   And in addition to that,
[01:24:13.980 --> 01:24:16.780]   because yerba mate does appear to have
[01:24:16.780 --> 01:24:18.500]   some sort of neuroprotective
[01:24:18.500 --> 01:24:22.100]   and in particular dopamine neuron protective properties.
[01:24:22.100 --> 01:24:24.540]   Now that doesn't mean that caffeine is always beneficial.
[01:24:24.540 --> 01:24:27.540]   And actually there's one instance related to dopamine
[01:24:27.540 --> 01:24:30.740]   where caffeine can be particularly dangerous.
[01:24:30.740 --> 01:24:33.340]   This relates to MDMA, so-called ecstasy.
[01:24:33.340 --> 01:24:37.460]   MDMA is under investigation in various clinical trials
[01:24:37.460 --> 01:24:40.320]   for its potential to treat trauma and depression.
[01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:44.760]   It's also of course a drug that's used recreationally.
[01:24:44.760 --> 01:24:47.600]   It's still illegal, at least in the United States.
[01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:52.600]   Whether or not MDMA is neurotoxic
[01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:53.820]   has been very controversial.
[01:24:53.820 --> 01:24:56.240]   Early on, it was thought that it is neurotoxic,
[01:24:56.240 --> 01:24:58.880]   that it can destroy serotonergic neurons.
[01:24:58.880 --> 01:25:01.680]   There were other papers that came out
[01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:04.520]   which argued that's not the case.
[01:25:04.520 --> 01:25:07.640]   And that's in particular because one of the early papers
[01:25:07.640 --> 01:25:09.160]   published in Science Magazine
[01:25:09.160 --> 01:25:12.220]   claiming that MDMA was neurotoxic.
[01:25:12.220 --> 01:25:14.700]   That paper was retracted.
[01:25:14.700 --> 01:25:17.860]   It turns out that that study had mistakenly used
[01:25:17.860 --> 01:25:19.500]   methamphetamine instead,
[01:25:19.500 --> 01:25:21.880]   and methamphetamine is known to be neurotoxic.
[01:25:21.880 --> 01:25:25.420]   I think most of the data point to the idea
[01:25:25.420 --> 01:25:29.980]   that MDMA might not be neurotoxic, but in any case,
[01:25:29.980 --> 01:25:32.260]   caffeine has been shown to increase
[01:25:32.260 --> 01:25:34.580]   the toxicity of MDMA receptors.
[01:25:34.580 --> 01:25:36.420]   And you might say, well, how could that be?
[01:25:36.420 --> 01:25:39.420]   Well, now you understand why that could be.
[01:25:39.420 --> 01:25:42.460]   Caffeine increases the density and efficacy
[01:25:42.460 --> 01:25:45.260]   of these dopamine receptors, the D2 and D3 receptors.
[01:25:45.260 --> 01:25:50.260]   MDMA is a potent drug for increasing concentrations
[01:25:50.260 --> 01:25:53.820]   of dopamine as well as serotonin and other neuromodulators.
[01:25:53.820 --> 01:25:56.100]   And it appears that caffeine ingestion
[01:25:56.100 --> 01:25:58.240]   by upregulating these receptors
[01:25:58.240 --> 01:26:02.420]   can lead to more toxicity of MDMA.
[01:26:02.420 --> 01:26:06.740]   So caffeine can be a beneficial substance in one context
[01:26:06.740 --> 01:26:08.820]   and actually can be a detrimental
[01:26:08.820 --> 01:26:11.940]   if not dangerous substance in another context.
[01:26:11.940 --> 01:26:14.660]   Two substances that greatly increase dopamine,
[01:26:14.660 --> 01:26:17.600]   namely amphetamine and cocaine,
[01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:22.560]   can cause long-term problems with the dopaminergic pathways.
[01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:24.800]   And this is largely based on a study
[01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:27.840]   that was published some years ago, 2003,
[01:26:27.840 --> 01:26:29.820]   but still holds a lot of merit.
[01:26:29.820 --> 01:26:30.980]   This is a paper published
[01:26:30.980 --> 01:26:33.240]   in "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,"
[01:26:33.240 --> 01:26:36.940]   a very high tier, stringent journal.
[01:26:36.940 --> 01:26:38.900]   First author is Kolb, K-O-L-B.
[01:26:38.900 --> 01:26:42.400]   And the title of the paper pretty much tells the story.
[01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:45.120]   Amphetamine or cocaine limits the ability
[01:26:45.120 --> 01:26:47.860]   of later experience to promote structural plasticity
[01:26:47.860 --> 01:26:49.420]   in the neocortex and nucleus accumbens.
[01:26:49.420 --> 01:26:54.080]   Neocortex is the outer shell of the brain, more or less,
[01:26:54.080 --> 01:26:55.740]   and the nucleus accumbens is part
[01:26:55.740 --> 01:26:58.500]   of that mesolimbic dopamine pathway
[01:26:58.500 --> 01:27:01.420]   for motivation, drive, and reinforcement.
[01:27:01.420 --> 01:27:02.700]   Neuroplasticity, of course,
[01:27:02.700 --> 01:27:04.180]   is the brain's ability to change
[01:27:04.180 --> 01:27:05.220]   in response to experience,
[01:27:05.220 --> 01:27:08.580]   and neuroplasticity is the basis of learning
[01:27:08.580 --> 01:27:12.140]   and memory and essentially remodeling
[01:27:12.140 --> 01:27:15.420]   of our neural circuitry in positive ways of all kinds.
[01:27:15.420 --> 01:27:18.780]   And this study was really one of the first to show
[01:27:18.780 --> 01:27:21.740]   that ingesting amphetamine and cocaine
[01:27:21.740 --> 01:27:26.140]   because of the high peak in dopamine that it creates
[01:27:26.140 --> 01:27:27.980]   and the low dopamine state,
[01:27:27.980 --> 01:27:31.740]   the baseline drop that it creates afterwards,
[01:27:31.740 --> 01:27:34.200]   limits plasticity and learning subsequent
[01:27:34.200 --> 01:27:36.340]   to taking amphetamine and cocaine.
[01:27:36.340 --> 01:27:38.500]   It was, at least in this study,
[01:27:38.500 --> 01:27:40.340]   shown to be a long-lasting effect.
[01:27:40.340 --> 01:27:41.860]   I doubt it's a permanent effect,
[01:27:41.860 --> 01:27:45.260]   but this should serve as a serious cautionary note
[01:27:45.260 --> 01:27:48.260]   that amphetamine and cocaine not only can cause
[01:27:48.260 --> 01:27:49.620]   a drop in baseline dopamine,
[01:27:49.620 --> 01:27:51.940]   but can actually put the brain into a state
[01:27:51.940 --> 01:27:55.280]   in which it cannot learn and modify itself to get better,
[01:27:55.280 --> 01:27:57.300]   at least for some period of time.
[01:27:57.300 --> 01:28:00.220]   In a previous episode on ADHD,
[01:28:00.220 --> 01:28:02.740]   I talked about the widespread use of drugs
[01:28:02.740 --> 01:28:05.340]   like Adderall, Ritalin, modafinil, and armodafinil,
[01:28:05.340 --> 01:28:07.860]   all of which lead to very large increases in dopamine
[01:28:07.860 --> 01:28:12.700]   and for people with ADHD can really improve their symptoms.
[01:28:12.700 --> 01:28:15.300]   But of course, there's a lot of non-prescription,
[01:28:15.300 --> 01:28:17.980]   non-clinical use of those compounds as well.
[01:28:17.980 --> 01:28:21.220]   And it stands to reason that the use of those substances
[01:28:21.220 --> 01:28:24.980]   to increase dopamine could very well provide
[01:28:24.980 --> 01:28:27.140]   the same sort of blockade of neuroplasticity
[01:28:27.140 --> 01:28:28.620]   that cocaine and amphetamine do,
[01:28:28.620 --> 01:28:31.960]   because when you look at the amount of dopamine increase
[01:28:31.960 --> 01:28:35.320]   that's triggered by those compounds, it's really comparable.
[01:28:35.320 --> 01:28:38.640]   So again, a cautionary note against spiking
[01:28:38.640 --> 01:28:41.520]   one's dopamine too much on a regular basis,
[01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:45.520]   unless there's a valid clinical need for doing that.
[01:28:45.520 --> 01:28:48.160]   So we've been focusing a lot for the last few minutes
[01:28:48.160 --> 01:28:50.880]   on the kind of darker side of dopamine
[01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:54.520]   and how getting big peaks in dopamine can be detrimental.
[01:28:54.520 --> 01:28:56.460]   But I want to acknowledge the truth,
[01:28:56.460 --> 01:28:59.060]   which is that dopamine feels great.
[01:28:59.060 --> 01:29:01.840]   Being in pursuit and motivated and craving things
[01:29:01.840 --> 01:29:05.400]   feels wonderful, and I don't want to demonize dopamine.
[01:29:05.400 --> 01:29:07.440]   What I'm trying to do today is to illustrate
[01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:09.260]   how dopamine works in your brain
[01:29:09.260 --> 01:29:12.120]   so that you can continue to engage
[01:29:12.120 --> 01:29:15.780]   in dopamine evoking activities.
[01:29:15.780 --> 01:29:18.500]   And certainly there is a place for ingesting things
[01:29:18.500 --> 01:29:22.300]   that can increase dopamine provided that they are safe for us
[01:29:22.300 --> 01:29:23.680]   in the short and long-term.
[01:29:23.680 --> 01:29:27.880]   There are activities that we can do
[01:29:27.880 --> 01:29:31.620]   that will give us healthy sustained increases in dopamine,
[01:29:31.620 --> 01:29:35.440]   both the peaks when they happen and to maintain
[01:29:35.440 --> 01:29:37.720]   or even increase our baseline levels of dopamine.
[01:29:37.720 --> 01:29:39.120]   So how do we do that?
[01:29:39.120 --> 01:29:41.000]   What are some of these activities?
[01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:44.360]   Well, in recent years, there's been a trend
[01:29:44.360 --> 01:29:47.640]   toward more people doing so-called cold exposure.
[01:29:47.640 --> 01:29:51.120]   In part, this was popularized by Wim Hof,
[01:29:51.120 --> 01:29:53.960]   the so-called Iceman, getting into cold showers,
[01:29:53.960 --> 01:29:57.360]   taking ice baths, exposing oneself to cold water
[01:29:57.360 --> 01:30:00.980]   of various kinds can in fact increase our levels
[01:30:00.980 --> 01:30:04.300]   of dopamine as well as the neuromodulator, neuronephrine.
[01:30:04.300 --> 01:30:07.080]   This is not a new phenomenon.
[01:30:07.080 --> 01:30:12.040]   In the 1920s, a guy by the name of Vincent Priznitz
[01:30:12.040 --> 01:30:14.580]   was one of the first people to popularize
[01:30:14.580 --> 01:30:17.360]   and formalize cold water therapies.
[01:30:17.360 --> 01:30:20.600]   He was an advocate of cold water exposure
[01:30:20.600 --> 01:30:22.880]   in order to boost the immune system
[01:30:22.880 --> 01:30:24.560]   and increase feelings of wellbeing.
[01:30:24.560 --> 01:30:26.140]   And actually this practice dates back
[01:30:26.140 --> 01:30:30.080]   long before Vincent's popularized it.
[01:30:30.080 --> 01:30:33.320]   And Wim Hof is the more recent iteration of this.
[01:30:33.320 --> 01:30:35.220]   First of all, some of the safety parameters.
[01:30:35.220 --> 01:30:36.600]   Let's establish those first.
[01:30:36.600 --> 01:30:38.800]   Getting into very, very cold water, you know,
[01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:42.120]   30 degree Fahrenheit or even low 40 degree Fahrenheit
[01:30:42.120 --> 01:30:44.640]   can put somebody into a state of cold water shock.
[01:30:44.640 --> 01:30:46.460]   I mean, people can die doing that.
[01:30:46.460 --> 01:30:49.560]   So obviously you want to approach this with some caution,
[01:30:49.560 --> 01:30:52.940]   but for most people getting into 60 degree water
[01:30:52.940 --> 01:30:55.680]   or 50 degree water, or if you're acclimated
[01:30:55.680 --> 01:30:57.780]   and comfortable with it, you know,
[01:30:57.780 --> 01:31:00.020]   40 degree water or 45 degree water
[01:31:00.020 --> 01:31:03.300]   can have tremendously beneficial results
[01:31:03.300 --> 01:31:06.300]   on your neuromodulator systems, including dopamine.
[01:31:06.300 --> 01:31:10.700]   What temperature of water you can tolerate will depend
[01:31:10.700 --> 01:31:14.400]   on how cold water adapted you are and how familiar you are
[01:31:14.400 --> 01:31:16.940]   with the experience of getting into cold water.
[01:31:16.940 --> 01:31:19.840]   And when I say comfortable with, I should mention,
[01:31:19.840 --> 01:31:23.120]   there is never a case in which getting into cold water
[01:31:23.120 --> 01:31:27.620]   does not evoke a release of epinephrine.
[01:31:27.620 --> 01:31:29.840]   So the quickening of the breath, the widening of the eyes,
[01:31:29.840 --> 01:31:32.880]   the feeling as if you can't catch your breath
[01:31:32.880 --> 01:31:35.420]   and even some physical pain at the level of the skin,
[01:31:35.420 --> 01:31:37.260]   that happens almost every time
[01:31:37.260 --> 01:31:39.360]   or every time that you get into cold water,
[01:31:39.360 --> 01:31:41.140]   even if you're cold water adapted.
[01:31:41.140 --> 01:31:44.460]   What almost everybody knows and understands is that
[01:31:44.460 --> 01:31:47.020]   that wall, as I like to refer to it, is coming.
[01:31:47.020 --> 01:31:48.780]   That's always the first experience
[01:31:48.780 --> 01:31:50.060]   of getting into cold water.
[01:31:50.060 --> 01:31:52.420]   There's no real way around that.
[01:31:52.420 --> 01:31:55.340]   Now, the study that I mentioned earlier,
[01:31:55.340 --> 01:31:58.300]   human physiological responses to immersion into water
[01:31:58.300 --> 01:32:00.520]   of different temperatures, really interesting study
[01:32:00.520 --> 01:32:03.540]   that was done and published in the University of,
[01:32:03.540 --> 01:32:06.180]   excuse me, the European Journal of Applied Physiology.
[01:32:06.180 --> 01:32:09.700]   I can provide a link to that study in the show caption.
[01:32:09.700 --> 01:32:10.980]   It's a really interesting study.
[01:32:10.980 --> 01:32:14.460]   They looked at people getting exposed to water
[01:32:14.460 --> 01:32:16.780]   that was warm, moderately cold or very cold.
[01:32:16.780 --> 01:32:19.020]   It was 32 degrees Celsius, 20 degrees Celsius
[01:32:19.020 --> 01:32:21.100]   or 14 degrees Celsius.
[01:32:21.100 --> 01:32:23.380]   You can just put those online and do the conversion
[01:32:23.380 --> 01:32:25.740]   or you can do the conversion to Fahrenheit if you like.
[01:32:25.740 --> 01:32:29.820]   But in any case, what they looked at were the concentrations
[01:32:29.820 --> 01:32:34.120]   of things like epinephrine and dopamine and so on.
[01:32:34.120 --> 01:32:36.340]   And what they found was really interesting.
[01:32:36.340 --> 01:32:41.340]   First of all, upon getting into cold water,
[01:32:41.340 --> 01:32:46.580]   the changes in adrenaline and noradrenaline,
[01:32:46.580 --> 01:32:49.740]   epinephrine and norepinephrine were immediate and fast
[01:32:49.740 --> 01:32:52.020]   and these were huge increases.
[01:32:52.020 --> 01:32:53.820]   So that's the getting into the cold water
[01:32:53.820 --> 01:32:55.160]   that everybody experiences,
[01:32:55.160 --> 01:32:57.300]   these huge increases in adrenaline.
[01:32:57.300 --> 01:32:59.500]   But then what was interesting is they observed
[01:32:59.500 --> 01:33:03.180]   that dopamine levels started to rise somewhat slowly
[01:33:03.180 --> 01:33:06.460]   and then continue to rise and reach levels
[01:33:06.460 --> 01:33:10.740]   as high as 2.5 times above baseline.
[01:33:10.740 --> 01:33:12.760]   That's a remarkably high increase.
[01:33:12.760 --> 01:33:17.760]   Remember, if we go back to our examples of chocolate, sex,
[01:33:17.760 --> 01:33:20.180]   a doubling above baseline, nicotine,
[01:33:20.180 --> 01:33:23.000]   2.5 times above baseline, cocaine,
[01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:27.060]   the increase in dopamine from cold water exposure
[01:33:27.060 --> 01:33:31.080]   of this kind was comparable to what one sees from cocaine,
[01:33:31.080 --> 01:33:36.080]   except in this case, it wasn't a rise and crash.
[01:33:36.080 --> 01:33:40.000]   It was actually a sustained rise in dopamine
[01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.500]   that took a very long time, up to three hours
[01:33:42.500 --> 01:33:46.060]   to come back down to baseline, which is really remarkable.
[01:33:46.060 --> 01:33:50.080]   And I think this explains some of the positive mental
[01:33:50.080 --> 01:33:53.260]   and physical effects that people report subjectively
[01:33:53.260 --> 01:33:55.320]   after doing cold water exposure.
[01:33:55.320 --> 01:33:57.500]   One question that many of you are probably asking is
[01:33:57.500 --> 01:33:59.940]   just how cold should the water be?
[01:33:59.940 --> 01:34:01.660]   Well, you could mimic what was done in this study
[01:34:01.660 --> 01:34:03.220]   and do 14 degrees Celsius,
[01:34:03.220 --> 01:34:05.280]   but for some people that won't be cold enough,
[01:34:05.280 --> 01:34:07.580]   for some people that will be too cold.
[01:34:07.580 --> 01:34:10.060]   They did look at the release of stress hormones
[01:34:10.060 --> 01:34:11.820]   like cortisol in addition to the release
[01:34:11.820 --> 01:34:13.940]   of things like epinephrine and adrenaline.
[01:34:13.940 --> 01:34:17.280]   And it's interesting that they noted that in all cases,
[01:34:17.280 --> 01:34:19.180]   but especially at that coldest temperature,
[01:34:19.180 --> 01:34:22.160]   there was an increase in cortisol, but that it was transient
[01:34:22.160 --> 01:34:24.080]   that eventually people's cortisol,
[01:34:24.080 --> 01:34:26.780]   the stress hormone subsided a bit.
[01:34:26.780 --> 01:34:28.740]   There are basically two different approaches
[01:34:28.740 --> 01:34:31.700]   to remaining in the cold when it's uncomfortable.
[01:34:31.700 --> 01:34:34.200]   One is to try and relax yourself,
[01:34:34.200 --> 01:34:36.780]   to try and practice slow breathing,
[01:34:36.780 --> 01:34:38.220]   to try and dilate your gaze.
[01:34:38.220 --> 01:34:40.060]   I've talked about this before in previous podcasts,
[01:34:40.060 --> 01:34:41.180]   to go into panoramic vision,
[01:34:41.180 --> 01:34:42.980]   to essentially try and calm yourself
[01:34:42.980 --> 01:34:46.660]   so that it's not as stressful in the cold.
[01:34:46.660 --> 01:34:49.580]   Other people, however, take the approach
[01:34:49.580 --> 01:34:51.540]   of trying to ramp up their level
[01:34:51.540 --> 01:34:53.780]   of internal autonomic arousal,
[01:34:53.780 --> 01:34:55.700]   meaning to get really energized
[01:34:55.700 --> 01:34:58.300]   and kind of lean into the friction of the cold.
[01:34:58.300 --> 01:34:59.740]   And they find that easier.
[01:34:59.740 --> 01:35:01.180]   Other people distract themselves.
[01:35:01.180 --> 01:35:04.100]   They recite the alphabet or they do something,
[01:35:04.100 --> 01:35:06.100]   anything to try and distract themselves
[01:35:06.100 --> 01:35:08.060]   from the discomfort.
[01:35:08.060 --> 01:35:09.060]   To be totally honest,
[01:35:09.060 --> 01:35:12.020]   it does not matter for sake of dopamine release
[01:35:12.020 --> 01:35:14.060]   because the dopamine release is triggered
[01:35:14.060 --> 01:35:17.900]   and then continues even after you get out of the cold water.
[01:35:17.900 --> 01:35:22.380]   Now, in this study, it was long exposure to cold water.
[01:35:22.380 --> 01:35:23.960]   It was an hour.
[01:35:23.960 --> 01:35:25.580]   That's a long period of time.
[01:35:25.580 --> 01:35:29.180]   And I do warn you against getting into cold water
[01:35:29.180 --> 01:35:32.160]   that's so cold that it will make your temperature drop
[01:35:32.160 --> 01:35:33.780]   and make you hyperthermic for an hour.
[01:35:33.780 --> 01:35:35.500]   That actually could be dangerous for a lot of people.
[01:35:35.500 --> 01:35:36.940]   You might have a hard time reheating
[01:35:36.940 --> 01:35:39.540]   and hypothermia is not a good thing.
[01:35:39.540 --> 01:35:42.980]   They had people monitoring subjects in these studies
[01:35:42.980 --> 01:35:45.220]   and paying attention to their core body temperature.
[01:35:45.220 --> 01:35:47.820]   They were able to reheat them afterwards.
[01:35:47.820 --> 01:35:51.220]   It's well-established now that getting into cold water,
[01:35:51.220 --> 01:35:52.920]   whether or not it's a shower, an ice bath,
[01:35:52.920 --> 01:35:55.220]   circulating cold water, a stream, et cetera,
[01:35:55.220 --> 01:35:59.380]   that can evoke the norepinephrine release immediately
[01:35:59.380 --> 01:36:01.580]   and the long arc of that dopamine release.
[01:36:01.580 --> 01:36:02.680]   Why would that be good?
[01:36:02.680 --> 01:36:04.780]   Up until now, I've basically said
[01:36:04.780 --> 01:36:06.940]   getting increases in dopamine
[01:36:06.940 --> 01:36:09.340]   are detrimental to your baseline.
[01:36:09.340 --> 01:36:12.380]   Well, this does appear to raise the baseline of dopamine
[01:36:12.380 --> 01:36:13.940]   for substantial periods of time.
[01:36:13.940 --> 01:36:18.060]   And most people report feeling a heightened level
[01:36:18.060 --> 01:36:22.060]   of calm and focus after getting out of cold water.
[01:36:22.060 --> 01:36:23.660]   So cold water exposure turns out to be
[01:36:23.660 --> 01:36:27.300]   a very potent stimulus for shifting the entire milieu,
[01:36:27.300 --> 01:36:30.520]   the entire environment of our brain and body
[01:36:30.520 --> 01:36:34.980]   and allowing many people to feel much, much better
[01:36:34.980 --> 01:36:36.760]   for a substantial period of time
[01:36:36.760 --> 01:36:40.560]   after getting out of the ice bath or cold water of any kind
[01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:42.140]   than they did before.
[01:36:42.140 --> 01:36:44.340]   Now you might ask how often to do this.
[01:36:44.340 --> 01:36:45.980]   Some people do this every day.
[01:36:45.980 --> 01:36:47.260]   It can be very stimulating.
[01:36:47.260 --> 01:36:49.980]   So typically doing it early in the day,
[01:36:49.980 --> 01:36:50.800]   it's going to be better.
[01:36:50.800 --> 01:36:53.700]   I don't necessarily recommend doing it right before sleep,
[01:36:53.700 --> 01:36:55.620]   but some people do it in the afternoon
[01:36:55.620 --> 01:36:58.500]   and some people will indeed do that seven days a week.
[01:36:58.500 --> 01:36:59.660]   Other people, three days a week.
[01:36:59.660 --> 01:37:01.220]   Other people, every once in a while.
[01:37:01.220 --> 01:37:05.300]   What I can say is once you become cold water adapted,
[01:37:05.300 --> 01:37:09.120]   once it no longer has the same impact of novelty
[01:37:09.120 --> 01:37:10.900]   and feeling a bit like a,
[01:37:10.900 --> 01:37:12.220]   I don't want to say a shock to your system
[01:37:12.220 --> 01:37:13.760]   because you don't want to go into cold water shock,
[01:37:13.760 --> 01:37:17.960]   but once it is comfortable for you,
[01:37:17.960 --> 01:37:20.220]   then it will no longer evoke this release.
[01:37:20.220 --> 01:37:22.340]   There really does seem to be something in the pathway
[01:37:22.340 --> 01:37:25.460]   from cold water exposure through the norepinephrine pathway
[01:37:25.460 --> 01:37:27.240]   and into the mesolimbic brainstem
[01:37:27.240 --> 01:37:29.360]   that causes this release in dopamine.
[01:37:29.360 --> 01:37:32.560]   But nonetheless, it's a basically zero cost.
[01:37:32.560 --> 01:37:34.380]   I mean, you need access to water of some sort,
[01:37:34.380 --> 01:37:35.580]   cold water, shower, et cetera,
[01:37:35.580 --> 01:37:38.160]   but basically zero cost way of triggering
[01:37:38.160 --> 01:37:39.860]   a long lasting increase in dopamine
[01:37:39.860 --> 01:37:42.780]   without ingesting anything, no pharmacology whatsoever.
[01:37:42.780 --> 01:37:46.000]   Please again, approach it with safety and caution in mind,
[01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:47.920]   but it is a very potent stimulus.
[01:37:47.920 --> 01:37:51.740]   Again, 250% rise in baseline,
[01:37:51.740 --> 01:37:55.100]   two and a half times rise in baseline rivals that of cocaine,
[01:37:55.100 --> 01:37:56.760]   which is really remarkable.
[01:37:56.760 --> 01:37:59.580]   Now I'd like to talk about the positive aspects of rewards
[01:37:59.580 --> 01:38:01.860]   for our behavior and the negative aspects
[01:38:01.860 --> 01:38:03.020]   of rewards for our behavior.
[01:38:03.020 --> 01:38:06.060]   And from that, I will suggest a protocol
[01:38:06.060 --> 01:38:09.180]   by which you can achieve a better relationship
[01:38:09.180 --> 01:38:12.060]   to your activities and to your dopamine system.
[01:38:12.060 --> 01:38:14.500]   In fact, it will help tune up your dopamine system
[01:38:14.500 --> 01:38:18.260]   for discipline, hard work, and motivation.
[01:38:18.260 --> 01:38:22.580]   Hard work is hard.
[01:38:22.580 --> 01:38:26.000]   Generally, most people don't like working hard.
[01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:29.020]   Some people do, but most people work hard
[01:38:29.020 --> 01:38:31.380]   in order to achieve some end goal.
[01:38:31.380 --> 01:38:34.900]   End goals are terrific and rewards are terrific,
[01:38:34.900 --> 01:38:38.820]   whether or not they are monetary, social, or any kind.
[01:38:39.820 --> 01:38:43.860]   However, because of the way that dopamine relates
[01:38:43.860 --> 01:38:48.860]   to our perception of time, working hard at something
[01:38:48.860 --> 01:38:52.300]   for sake of a reward that comes afterward
[01:38:52.300 --> 01:38:55.700]   can make the hard work much more challenging
[01:38:55.700 --> 01:38:58.840]   and make us much less likely to lean into hard work
[01:38:58.840 --> 01:38:59.820]   in the future.
[01:38:59.820 --> 01:39:01.600]   Let me give you a couple examples
[01:39:01.600 --> 01:39:03.840]   by way of data and experiments.
[01:39:03.840 --> 01:39:07.620]   There's a classic experiment done actually at Stanford
[01:39:07.620 --> 01:39:11.980]   many years ago in which children in nursery school
[01:39:11.980 --> 01:39:14.840]   and kindergarten drew pictures.
[01:39:14.840 --> 01:39:17.680]   And they drew pictures 'cause they liked to draw.
[01:39:17.680 --> 01:39:20.660]   The researchers took kids that liked to draw
[01:39:20.660 --> 01:39:23.540]   and they started giving them a reward for drawing.
[01:39:23.540 --> 01:39:25.580]   The reward generally was a gold star
[01:39:25.580 --> 01:39:28.940]   or some thing that a young child would find rewarding.
[01:39:28.940 --> 01:39:33.480]   Then they stopped giving them the gold star.
[01:39:33.480 --> 01:39:35.660]   And what they found is the children
[01:39:35.660 --> 01:39:40.660]   had a much lower tendency to draw on their own, no reward.
[01:39:40.660 --> 01:39:44.300]   Now, remember this was an activity
[01:39:44.300 --> 01:39:46.460]   that prior to receiving a reward,
[01:39:46.460 --> 01:39:50.400]   the children intrinsically enjoyed and selected to do.
[01:39:50.400 --> 01:39:52.800]   No one was telling them to draw.
[01:39:52.800 --> 01:39:54.500]   What this relates to is so-called intrinsic
[01:39:54.500 --> 01:39:57.260]   versus extrinsic reinforcement.
[01:39:57.260 --> 01:39:58.800]   When we receive rewards,
[01:39:58.800 --> 01:40:01.980]   even if we give ourselves rewards for something,
[01:40:01.980 --> 01:40:04.060]   we tend to associate less pleasure
[01:40:04.060 --> 01:40:07.940]   with the actual activity itself that evoked the reward.
[01:40:07.940 --> 01:40:09.420]   Now, that might seem counterintuitive,
[01:40:09.420 --> 01:40:10.660]   but that's just the way
[01:40:10.660 --> 01:40:13.240]   that these dopaminergic circuits work.
[01:40:13.240 --> 01:40:16.640]   And now understanding these peaks and baselines in dopamine,
[01:40:16.640 --> 01:40:20.300]   which I won't review again, this should make sense.
[01:40:20.300 --> 01:40:24.260]   If you get a peak in dopamine from a reward,
[01:40:24.260 --> 01:40:25.740]   it's going to lower your baseline.
[01:40:25.740 --> 01:40:29.060]   And the cognitive interpretation
[01:40:29.060 --> 01:40:31.540]   is that you didn't really do the activity
[01:40:31.540 --> 01:40:34.420]   because you enjoyed the activity, you did it for the reward.
[01:40:34.420 --> 01:40:37.320]   Now, this doesn't mean all rewards of all kinds are bad,
[01:40:37.320 --> 01:40:39.740]   but it's also important to understand
[01:40:39.740 --> 01:40:42.780]   that dopamine controls our perception of time.
[01:40:42.780 --> 01:40:46.200]   When and how much dopamine we experience
[01:40:46.200 --> 01:40:48.160]   is the way that we carve up
[01:40:48.160 --> 01:40:50.540]   what we call our experience of time.
[01:40:50.540 --> 01:40:52.140]   When we engage in an activity,
[01:40:52.140 --> 01:40:56.980]   let's say school or hard work of any kind or exercise,
[01:40:56.980 --> 01:40:59.420]   because of the reward we are going to give ourselves
[01:40:59.420 --> 01:41:01.100]   or receive at the end, the trophy,
[01:41:01.100 --> 01:41:05.320]   the Sunday, the meal, whatever it happens to be,
[01:41:05.320 --> 01:41:10.500]   we actually are extending the time bin
[01:41:10.500 --> 01:41:15.500]   over which we are analyzing or perceiving that experience.
[01:41:15.500 --> 01:41:19.380]   And because the reward comes at the end,
[01:41:19.380 --> 01:41:22.820]   we start to dissociate the neural circuits
[01:41:22.820 --> 01:41:24.520]   for dopamine and reward
[01:41:24.520 --> 01:41:28.580]   that would have normally been active during the activity.
[01:41:28.580 --> 01:41:32.880]   And because it all arrives at the end over time,
[01:41:32.880 --> 01:41:35.800]   we have the experience of less and less pleasure
[01:41:35.800 --> 01:41:39.180]   from that particular activity while we're doing it.
[01:41:39.180 --> 01:41:43.100]   Now, this is the antithesis of growth mindset.
[01:41:43.100 --> 01:41:45.780]   My colleague at Stanford, Carol Dweck, as many of you know,
[01:41:45.780 --> 01:41:49.040]   has come up with this incredible theory and principle,
[01:41:49.040 --> 01:41:50.900]   and it actually goes beyond theory and principle
[01:41:50.900 --> 01:41:51.980]   called growth mindset,
[01:41:51.980 --> 01:41:54.140]   which is this striving to be better,
[01:41:54.140 --> 01:41:56.760]   to be in this mindset of I'm not there yet,
[01:41:56.760 --> 01:42:00.880]   but striving itself is the end goal.
[01:42:00.880 --> 01:42:03.200]   And that of course delivers you to tremendous performance
[01:42:03.200 --> 01:42:05.160]   has been observed over and over and over again,
[01:42:05.160 --> 01:42:06.580]   that people that have growth mindset,
[01:42:06.580 --> 01:42:09.420]   kids that have growth mindset end up performing very well
[01:42:09.420 --> 01:42:12.000]   because they're focused on the effort itself.
[01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:15.540]   And all of us can cultivate growth mindset.
[01:42:15.540 --> 01:42:18.140]   The neural mechanism of cultivating growth mindset
[01:42:18.140 --> 01:42:21.600]   involves learning to access the rewards
[01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:23.800]   from effort and doing.
[01:42:23.800 --> 01:42:27.880]   And that's hard to do because you have to engage
[01:42:27.880 --> 01:42:30.380]   this prefrontal component of the mesolimbic circuit.
[01:42:30.380 --> 01:42:33.660]   You have to tell yourself, okay, this effort is great.
[01:42:33.660 --> 01:42:35.180]   This effort is pleasureful,
[01:42:35.180 --> 01:42:37.500]   even though you might actually be in a state of physical pain
[01:42:37.500 --> 01:42:40.100]   from the exercise, or I can recall this from college,
[01:42:40.100 --> 01:42:42.240]   just feeling like I wanted to get up from my desk,
[01:42:42.240 --> 01:42:43.640]   but forcing myself to study,
[01:42:43.640 --> 01:42:45.140]   forcing myself and forcing myself.
[01:42:45.140 --> 01:42:48.420]   What you find over time is that you can start to associate
[01:42:48.420 --> 01:42:51.020]   a dopamine release, you can evoke dopamine release
[01:42:51.020 --> 01:42:53.980]   from the friction and the challenge
[01:42:53.980 --> 01:42:55.820]   that you happen to be in.
[01:42:55.820 --> 01:42:59.580]   You completely eliminate the ability to generate
[01:42:59.580 --> 01:43:02.340]   those circuits and the rewarding process
[01:43:02.340 --> 01:43:06.040]   of being able to reward friction while in effort,
[01:43:06.040 --> 01:43:09.540]   if you are focused only on the goal that comes at the end,
[01:43:09.540 --> 01:43:12.500]   because of the way that dopamine marks time.
[01:43:12.500 --> 01:43:15.440]   So if you say, oh, I'm going to do this very hard thing
[01:43:15.440 --> 01:43:17.340]   and I'm going to push and push and push and push
[01:43:17.340 --> 01:43:20.260]   for that end goal that comes later,
[01:43:20.260 --> 01:43:24.980]   not only do you enjoy the process of what you're doing less,
[01:43:24.980 --> 01:43:27.060]   you actually make it more painful
[01:43:27.060 --> 01:43:28.520]   while you're engaging in it.
[01:43:28.520 --> 01:43:30.260]   You make yourself less efficient at it,
[01:43:30.260 --> 01:43:33.500]   because if you were able to access dopamine while in effort,
[01:43:33.500 --> 01:43:35.360]   dopamine has all these incredible properties
[01:43:35.360 --> 01:43:37.940]   of increasing the amount of energy in our body
[01:43:37.940 --> 01:43:39.880]   and in our mind, our ability to focus
[01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:43.200]   by way of dopamine's conversion into epinephrine,
[01:43:43.200 --> 01:43:46.160]   but also you are undermining your ability
[01:43:46.160 --> 01:43:48.540]   to lean back into that activity the next time.
[01:43:48.540 --> 01:43:51.500]   The next time you need twice as much coffee
[01:43:51.500 --> 01:43:53.660]   and three times as much loud music
[01:43:53.660 --> 01:43:55.700]   and four times as much energy drink
[01:43:55.700 --> 01:43:58.360]   and the social connection just to get out the door
[01:43:58.360 --> 01:44:00.740]   in order to do the run or to study.
[01:44:00.740 --> 01:44:04.780]   So what's more beneficial in fact can serve
[01:44:04.780 --> 01:44:07.640]   as a tremendous amplifier on all endeavors
[01:44:07.640 --> 01:44:11.200]   that you engage in, especially hard endeavors,
[01:44:11.200 --> 01:44:15.660]   is to A, not start layering in other sources of dopamine
[01:44:15.660 --> 01:44:17.500]   in order to get to the starting line,
[01:44:17.500 --> 01:44:19.960]   not layering in other sources of dopamine
[01:44:19.960 --> 01:44:21.220]   in order to be able to continue,
[01:44:21.220 --> 01:44:24.580]   but rather to subjectively start to attach
[01:44:24.580 --> 01:44:27.500]   the feeling of friction and effort
[01:44:27.500 --> 01:44:30.340]   to an internally generated reward system.
[01:44:30.340 --> 01:44:32.380]   And this is not meant to be vague.
[01:44:32.380 --> 01:44:35.140]   This is a system that exists in your mind,
[01:44:35.140 --> 01:44:37.000]   that exists in the minds of humans
[01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:38.900]   for hundreds of thousands of years
[01:44:38.900 --> 01:44:41.740]   by which you're not just pursuing the things
[01:44:41.740 --> 01:44:44.660]   that are innately pleasureful, food, sex,
[01:44:44.660 --> 01:44:47.860]   warmth, water when you're thirsty.
[01:44:47.860 --> 01:44:51.180]   But the beauty of this mesolimbic reward pathway
[01:44:51.180 --> 01:44:52.820]   that I talked about earlier
[01:44:52.820 --> 01:44:54.380]   is that it includes the forebrain.
[01:44:54.380 --> 01:44:59.240]   So you can tell yourself the effort part is the good part.
[01:44:59.240 --> 01:45:00.080]   I know it's painful.
[01:45:00.080 --> 01:45:02.380]   I know this doesn't feel good, but I'm focused on this.
[01:45:02.380 --> 01:45:04.940]   I'm going to start to access the reward.
[01:45:04.940 --> 01:45:07.380]   You will find the rewards,
[01:45:07.380 --> 01:45:10.060]   meaning the dopamine release inside of effort
[01:45:10.060 --> 01:45:12.040]   if you repeat this over and over again.
[01:45:12.040 --> 01:45:13.720]   And what's beautiful about it
[01:45:13.720 --> 01:45:15.240]   is that it starts to become reflexive
[01:45:15.240 --> 01:45:17.420]   for all types of effort.
[01:45:17.420 --> 01:45:19.280]   When we focus only on the trophy,
[01:45:19.280 --> 01:45:22.960]   only on the grade, only on the win as the reward,
[01:45:22.960 --> 01:45:25.520]   you undermine that entire process.
[01:45:25.520 --> 01:45:27.400]   So how do you do this?
[01:45:27.400 --> 01:45:31.420]   You do this in those moments of the most intense friction,
[01:45:31.420 --> 01:45:34.760]   you tell yourself, this is very painful.
[01:45:34.760 --> 01:45:36.920]   And because it's painful,
[01:45:36.920 --> 01:45:40.580]   it will evoke an increase in dopamine release later,
[01:45:40.580 --> 01:45:43.900]   meaning it will increase my baseline in dopamine.
[01:45:43.900 --> 01:45:48.640]   But you also have to tell yourself that in that moment,
[01:45:48.640 --> 01:45:50.460]   you are doing it by choice
[01:45:50.460 --> 01:45:53.640]   and you're doing it because you love it.
[01:45:53.640 --> 01:45:55.980]   And I know that sounds like lying to yourself.
[01:45:55.980 --> 01:45:58.380]   And in some ways it is lying to yourself,
[01:45:58.380 --> 01:46:01.260]   but it's lying to yourself in the context of a truth,
[01:46:01.260 --> 01:46:05.020]   which is that you want it to feel better.
[01:46:05.020 --> 01:46:07.780]   You want it to feel even pleasureful.
[01:46:07.780 --> 01:46:10.820]   Now, this is very far and away different
[01:46:10.820 --> 01:46:14.300]   from thinking about the reward that comes at the end,
[01:46:14.300 --> 01:46:17.000]   the hot fudge Sunday after you cross the finish line,
[01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:18.320]   and you can replace hot fudge Sunday
[01:46:18.320 --> 01:46:21.980]   with whatever reward happens to be appealing to you.
[01:46:21.980 --> 01:46:23.660]   We revere people who are capable
[01:46:23.660 --> 01:46:25.800]   of doing what I'm describing.
[01:46:25.800 --> 01:46:28.060]   David Goggins comes to mind as a really good example.
[01:46:28.060 --> 01:46:30.160]   Many of you are probably familiar with David Goggins,
[01:46:30.160 --> 01:46:31.480]   former Navy SEAL,
[01:46:31.480 --> 01:46:36.040]   who essentially has made a post-military career
[01:46:36.040 --> 01:46:39.800]   out of explaining and sharing his process
[01:46:39.800 --> 01:46:42.640]   of turning the effort into the reward.
[01:46:42.640 --> 01:46:45.340]   There are many other examples of this too, of course.
[01:46:45.340 --> 01:46:48.720]   Throughout evolutionary history,
[01:46:48.720 --> 01:46:50.580]   there's no question that we revered people
[01:46:50.580 --> 01:46:53.920]   who were willing to go out and forage and hunt and gather
[01:46:53.920 --> 01:46:58.560]   and caretake in ways that other members of our species
[01:46:58.560 --> 01:47:00.400]   probably found exhausting
[01:47:00.400 --> 01:47:02.720]   and probably would have preferred to just put their feet up
[01:47:02.720 --> 01:47:04.020]   or soak them in a cool stream
[01:47:04.020 --> 01:47:06.060]   rather than continue to forage.
[01:47:06.060 --> 01:47:10.420]   The ability to access this pleasure from effort aspect
[01:47:10.420 --> 01:47:14.980]   of our dopaminergic circuitry is without question
[01:47:14.980 --> 01:47:17.580]   the most powerful aspect of dopamine
[01:47:17.580 --> 01:47:19.520]   and our biology of dopamine.
[01:47:19.520 --> 01:47:23.020]   And the beautiful thing is it's accessible to all of us,
[01:47:23.020 --> 01:47:25.940]   but just to highlight the things that can interfere with
[01:47:25.940 --> 01:47:29.920]   and prevent you from getting dopamine release
[01:47:29.920 --> 01:47:32.120]   from effort itself,
[01:47:32.120 --> 01:47:34.980]   don't spike dopamine prior to engaging in effort
[01:47:34.980 --> 01:47:39.420]   and don't spike dopamine after engaging in effort.
[01:47:39.420 --> 01:47:42.980]   Learn to spike your dopamine from effort itself.
[01:47:42.980 --> 01:47:47.480]   One straightforward example of learning to attach dopamine
[01:47:47.480 --> 01:47:52.480]   to effort and strain as opposed to a process or a reward
[01:47:52.480 --> 01:47:55.260]   that naturally evokes dopamine release
[01:47:55.260 --> 01:47:57.120]   is so-called intermittent fasting.
[01:47:57.120 --> 01:47:59.500]   I know this is very popular nowadays.
[01:47:59.500 --> 01:48:01.160]   Some people like to do intermittent fasting,
[01:48:01.160 --> 01:48:02.300]   some people don't.
[01:48:02.300 --> 01:48:05.180]   Some people have a 12 hour feeding window every 24 hours.
[01:48:05.180 --> 01:48:08.260]   Some people do long fasts of two to three days even.
[01:48:08.260 --> 01:48:11.540]   I personally don't monitor a feeding window
[01:48:11.540 --> 01:48:12.660]   with a lot of precision.
[01:48:12.660 --> 01:48:15.380]   I tend to skip one meal a day, either breakfast or lunch,
[01:48:15.380 --> 01:48:16.840]   and then I eat the other two meals of the day
[01:48:16.840 --> 01:48:18.100]   depending on which meal I skip.
[01:48:18.100 --> 01:48:19.740]   So it's either breakfast, lunch,
[01:48:19.740 --> 01:48:22.280]   and maybe a little something in the evening,
[01:48:22.280 --> 01:48:25.700]   or I'll skip breakfast and do lunch and dinner and so on.
[01:48:25.700 --> 01:48:28.320]   Many people are now eating this way
[01:48:28.320 --> 01:48:30.240]   in part because many people find it easier
[01:48:30.240 --> 01:48:35.220]   to not eat at all than to eat a smaller portion
[01:48:35.220 --> 01:48:36.060]   of some food.
[01:48:36.060 --> 01:48:37.420]   And that has everything to do
[01:48:37.420 --> 01:48:42.000]   with the dopamine reward evoking properties of food.
[01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:45.940]   When we ingest food, or when we are about to ingest food,
[01:48:45.940 --> 01:48:47.160]   our dopamine levels go up.
[01:48:47.160 --> 01:48:49.320]   And typically when we ingest food,
[01:48:49.320 --> 01:48:51.000]   if it evokes some dopamine release,
[01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:52.680]   then we tend to want even more food.
[01:48:52.680 --> 01:48:55.960]   Remember, dopamine's main role is one of motivation
[01:48:55.960 --> 01:48:56.800]   and seeking.
[01:48:56.800 --> 01:49:00.680]   And what dopamine always wants more of is more dopamine,
[01:49:00.680 --> 01:49:05.180]   more activity or thing that evokes more dopamine release.
[01:49:05.180 --> 01:49:09.080]   Well, let's just look at fasting from the perspective
[01:49:09.080 --> 01:49:11.880]   of dopamine schedules and dopamine release
[01:49:11.880 --> 01:49:13.180]   and peaks and baselines.
[01:49:13.180 --> 01:49:18.820]   Typically when we eat, we get dopamine release,
[01:49:18.820 --> 01:49:21.520]   especially when we eat after being very hungry.
[01:49:21.520 --> 01:49:24.180]   If you've ever gone camping or you're very, very hungry,
[01:49:24.180 --> 01:49:26.080]   the food tastes that much better.
[01:49:26.080 --> 01:49:28.080]   And that's actually because of the way
[01:49:28.080 --> 01:49:32.800]   that deprivation states increase the way
[01:49:32.800 --> 01:49:35.080]   that dopaminergic circuits work.
[01:49:35.080 --> 01:49:38.540]   Our perception of dopamine is heightened
[01:49:38.540 --> 01:49:40.320]   when the receptors for dopamine
[01:49:40.320 --> 01:49:42.440]   have not seen much dopamine lately.
[01:49:42.440 --> 01:49:43.840]   They haven't bound much dopamine.
[01:49:43.840 --> 01:49:45.760]   So when you fast, fast, fast, fast, fast,
[01:49:45.760 --> 01:49:49.640]   and then you finally eat, it evokes more dopamine release.
[01:49:49.640 --> 01:49:52.000]   So this is the big reward that comes at the end.
[01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:55.440]   Even bigger because you deprived yourself.
[01:49:56.200 --> 01:49:59.000]   This is true for all rewarding behaviors and activities,
[01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:00.200]   by the way.
[01:50:00.200 --> 01:50:02.960]   The longer you restrict yourself from that activity,
[01:50:02.960 --> 01:50:05.280]   the greater the dopamine experience
[01:50:05.280 --> 01:50:06.820]   when the dopamine is finally released
[01:50:06.820 --> 01:50:09.680]   because of an upregulation of the receptors for dopamine.
[01:50:09.680 --> 01:50:13.440]   But I just spent five minutes or more telling you
[01:50:13.440 --> 01:50:16.420]   that you should avoid too much reward at the end,
[01:50:16.420 --> 01:50:20.000]   and you should actually focus on the dopamine
[01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.680]   that you can consciously evoke
[01:50:22.680 --> 01:50:24.880]   from the deprivation strain and effort.
[01:50:24.880 --> 01:50:28.060]   And in fact, this is what happens for many people
[01:50:28.060 --> 01:50:31.160]   that start doing fasting and take a liking to it.
[01:50:31.160 --> 01:50:33.960]   Many people say that their state of mind
[01:50:33.960 --> 01:50:35.880]   when they fast is clear,
[01:50:35.880 --> 01:50:39.080]   that they actually start to enjoy the period of fasting.
[01:50:39.080 --> 01:50:41.840]   In fact, some people start pushing out their eating window
[01:50:41.840 --> 01:50:44.220]   or skipping entire days of eating more and more
[01:50:44.220 --> 01:50:47.920]   in order to get deeper into that state of mind
[01:50:47.920 --> 01:50:50.420]   where surely it's not just dopamine,
[01:50:50.420 --> 01:50:53.340]   but dopamine is released, they will track their clock.
[01:50:53.340 --> 01:50:56.020]   Oh, I've been fasting 12 hours, 16 hours, et cetera.
[01:50:56.020 --> 01:50:58.440]   They are starting to attach dopamine release
[01:50:58.440 --> 01:51:01.440]   or create dopamine release from the deprivation,
[01:51:01.440 --> 01:51:03.740]   not from the food reward itself.
[01:51:03.740 --> 01:51:06.240]   And this, I think, makes it an interesting practice
[01:51:06.240 --> 01:51:10.220]   and one that certainly has been practiced for centuries
[01:51:10.220 --> 01:51:12.200]   in different cultures and different religions
[01:51:12.200 --> 01:51:14.240]   of deliberately restricting food,
[01:51:14.240 --> 01:51:17.980]   not just to increase the rewarding properties of food itself
[01:51:17.980 --> 01:51:20.520]   but also to increase the rewarding properties
[01:51:20.520 --> 01:51:22.040]   of deprivation.
[01:51:22.040 --> 01:51:25.040]   And I should emphasize that a lot of the subjective aspects
[01:51:25.040 --> 01:51:27.480]   of the knowledge of the benefits of fasting
[01:51:27.480 --> 01:51:32.480]   serve as reinforcing dopamine amplifying aspects to fasting.
[01:51:32.480 --> 01:51:36.560]   Meaning if somebody does intermittent fasting
[01:51:36.560 --> 01:51:38.340]   and they are deep into their fast
[01:51:38.340 --> 01:51:39.240]   and they're telling themselves,
[01:51:39.240 --> 01:51:41.880]   oh, my blood lipid profiles are probably improving
[01:51:41.880 --> 01:51:44.460]   and my glucose management is probably improving,
[01:51:44.460 --> 01:51:46.240]   my insulin sensitivity is going up
[01:51:46.240 --> 01:51:47.160]   and I'm going to live longer.
[01:51:47.160 --> 01:51:50.960]   All these things that have some basis from animal studies
[01:51:50.960 --> 01:51:53.720]   and some basis or not from human studies,
[01:51:53.720 --> 01:51:55.760]   it's all kind of still in emerging literature,
[01:51:55.760 --> 01:51:57.600]   but it does seem to be pointing in that direction
[01:51:57.600 --> 01:52:01.280]   that fasting can encourage things like autophagy,
[01:52:01.280 --> 01:52:04.520]   the engulfment of dead cells and things of that sort.
[01:52:04.520 --> 01:52:07.760]   Well, as people tell themselves these things,
[01:52:07.760 --> 01:52:10.960]   they are enhancing the rewarding properties
[01:52:10.960 --> 01:52:12.840]   of the behavior of fasting.
[01:52:12.840 --> 01:52:14.960]   And so this is a salient example
[01:52:14.960 --> 01:52:17.120]   of where knowledge of knowledge
[01:52:17.120 --> 01:52:21.840]   can actually help us change these deep primitive circuits
[01:52:21.840 --> 01:52:23.020]   related to dopamine.
[01:52:23.020 --> 01:52:25.440]   And this illustrates how the forebrain,
[01:52:25.440 --> 01:52:28.240]   which carries knowledge and carries interpretation
[01:52:28.240 --> 01:52:32.680]   and rational thought can be used to shape the very circuits
[01:52:32.680 --> 01:52:35.240]   that are involved in generating reward
[01:52:35.240 --> 01:52:37.400]   for what would otherwise just be kind of primitive
[01:52:37.400 --> 01:52:39.060]   behaviors, hardwired behaviors.
[01:52:39.060 --> 01:52:41.320]   And that's the beauty of these dopamine circuits.
[01:52:41.320 --> 01:52:42.540]   And that's the beauty of dopamine.
[01:52:42.540 --> 01:52:46.080]   It's not just attached to the more primitive behaviors
[01:52:46.080 --> 01:52:49.480]   of food, sex, heat, et cetera.
[01:52:49.480 --> 01:52:52.400]   It's also attached to the things that we decide
[01:52:52.400 --> 01:52:54.660]   are good for us and are important for us.
[01:52:54.660 --> 01:52:58.640]   So telling yourself that exercise or fasting or studying
[01:52:58.640 --> 01:53:01.760]   or listening better or any kind of behavior is good for you
[01:53:01.760 --> 01:53:05.880]   will actually reinforce the extent to which it is good
[01:53:05.880 --> 01:53:08.000]   for you at a chemical level.
[01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.800]   And a somewhat eerie example of what I just mentioned
[01:53:10.800 --> 01:53:13.740]   was a study that was published last year
[01:53:13.740 --> 01:53:15.440]   in the journal Neuron, Cell Press Journal,
[01:53:15.440 --> 01:53:20.160]   excellent journal, that showed that hearing something
[01:53:20.160 --> 01:53:22.920]   that reinforces one's prior beliefs
[01:53:22.920 --> 01:53:25.400]   actually can evoke dopamine release.
[01:53:25.400 --> 01:53:28.460]   So the dopamine pathway is so vulnerable
[01:53:28.460 --> 01:53:32.260]   to subjective interpretation that it actually makes it such
[01:53:32.260 --> 01:53:34.440]   that when we see something or hear something
[01:53:34.440 --> 01:53:36.840]   that validates a belief that we already have,
[01:53:36.840 --> 01:53:40.560]   that itself can increase dopamine release.
[01:53:40.560 --> 01:53:44.140]   Along the lines of how dopamine and dopamine schedules
[01:53:44.140 --> 01:53:46.640]   and our perception of things can shape the way
[01:53:46.640 --> 01:53:49.520]   that we experience things as pleasureful or not.
[01:53:49.520 --> 01:53:51.120]   There are beautiful studies,
[01:53:51.120 --> 01:53:54.480]   mainly looking at sugar appetite and our sense of pleasure
[01:53:54.480 --> 01:53:58.640]   from sweet things, but also for savory foods, et cetera.
[01:53:58.640 --> 01:54:00.600]   And essentially the results that come out of this
[01:54:00.600 --> 01:54:01.540]   are the following.
[01:54:01.540 --> 01:54:03.800]   If you ingest something that you like,
[01:54:03.800 --> 01:54:05.080]   it tastes good to you,
[01:54:05.080 --> 01:54:07.900]   but then you ingest something that's even sweeter
[01:54:07.900 --> 01:54:11.760]   or even more savory, and then you go back to the food
[01:54:11.760 --> 01:54:13.540]   that you ate previously,
[01:54:13.540 --> 01:54:15.560]   well, you don't like it as much.
[01:54:15.560 --> 01:54:18.280]   And that might seem like a duh, obviously,
[01:54:18.280 --> 01:54:22.560]   but that shift in perception can be blocked
[01:54:22.560 --> 01:54:25.160]   by blocking the shift in dopamine.
[01:54:25.160 --> 01:54:28.160]   And so this really speaks to these peaks and valleys
[01:54:28.160 --> 01:54:29.480]   in dopamine that I mentioned before
[01:54:29.480 --> 01:54:33.040]   and how your experience of anything is going to depend
[01:54:33.040 --> 01:54:35.880]   on your prior experience of other things
[01:54:35.880 --> 01:54:36.840]   that evoke dopamine.
[01:54:36.840 --> 01:54:39.840]   Big dopamine release makes it more challenging
[01:54:39.840 --> 01:54:42.960]   to experience more big dopamine release.
[01:54:42.960 --> 01:54:45.400]   So dopamine is one of those things that you don't want,
[01:54:45.400 --> 01:54:47.820]   too high or too low for too long.
[01:54:47.820 --> 01:54:50.100]   It's all about staying in that dynamic range,
[01:54:50.100 --> 01:54:52.460]   and that's going to be different for everybody.
[01:54:52.460 --> 01:54:57.460]   So for the very savory foods that are now everywhere,
[01:54:57.460 --> 01:54:59.600]   those highly savory foods,
[01:54:59.600 --> 01:55:02.160]   or I think they call them highly palatable foods,
[01:55:02.160 --> 01:55:06.000]   are making more bland foods, whole foods,
[01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:07.400]   meaning foods that aren't processed,
[01:55:07.400 --> 01:55:10.140]   it's making those tastes less good, at least for a while.
[01:55:10.140 --> 01:55:12.280]   And all it takes is a short period of time,
[01:55:12.280 --> 01:55:14.600]   even just days, two days or so,
[01:55:14.600 --> 01:55:17.920]   of not consuming any highly palatable foods.
[01:55:17.920 --> 01:55:22.400]   And suddenly broccoli with just a little bit of seasoning
[01:55:22.400 --> 01:55:24.480]   tastes delicious to you, all right?
[01:55:24.480 --> 01:55:26.600]   So again, this just speaks to the fact
[01:55:26.600 --> 01:55:29.120]   that dopamine is this universal currency.
[01:55:29.120 --> 01:55:31.560]   It establishes value based on
[01:55:31.560 --> 01:55:33.200]   not just what you're experiencing in the moment,
[01:55:33.200 --> 01:55:36.580]   but what you experienced in the days and minutes before.
[01:55:36.580 --> 01:55:40.400]   Now that you understand how your previous level of dopamine
[01:55:40.400 --> 01:55:42.680]   relates to your current level of dopamine
[01:55:42.680 --> 01:55:45.200]   and how your current level of dopamine
[01:55:45.200 --> 01:55:48.460]   will influence your future level of dopamine,
[01:55:48.460 --> 01:55:52.560]   it should become obvious why things like pornography,
[01:55:52.560 --> 01:55:54.640]   not just the accessibility of pornography,
[01:55:54.640 --> 01:55:57.280]   but the intensity of pornography
[01:55:57.280 --> 01:56:01.200]   can negatively shape real-world romantic
[01:56:01.200 --> 01:56:02.680]   and sexual interactions.
[01:56:02.680 --> 01:56:04.020]   This is a serious concern.
[01:56:04.020 --> 01:56:06.180]   The discussion is happening now.
[01:56:06.180 --> 01:56:09.800]   The underlying neurobiological mechanisms you now understand,
[01:56:09.800 --> 01:56:12.880]   and this isn't to pass judgment on whether or not
[01:56:12.880 --> 01:56:14.720]   people like or don't like pornography.
[01:56:14.720 --> 01:56:15.900]   That's an ethical discussion.
[01:56:15.900 --> 01:56:18.000]   It's a moral discussion that has to be decided
[01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:21.320]   for each individual by virtue of age, et cetera.
[01:56:21.320 --> 01:56:27.500]   But again, any activity that evokes a lot of dopamine release
[01:56:27.500 --> 01:56:32.120]   will make it harder to achieve the same level
[01:56:32.120 --> 01:56:34.560]   and certainly the greater level of dopamine
[01:56:34.560 --> 01:56:36.840]   through a subsequent interaction.
[01:56:36.840 --> 01:56:40.400]   So yes, indeed, many people are addicted to pornography
[01:56:40.400 --> 01:56:44.500]   and yes, indeed, many people who regularly indulge
[01:56:44.500 --> 01:56:46.800]   in pornography experience challenges
[01:56:46.800 --> 01:56:49.100]   in real-world romantic interactions.
[01:56:49.100 --> 01:56:50.560]   You now understand the mechanisms
[01:56:50.560 --> 01:56:52.260]   behind what I'm telling you.
[01:56:52.260 --> 01:56:55.040]   Now, there are circumstances in which increasing levels
[01:56:55.040 --> 01:56:57.840]   of dopamine is desirable and advantageous
[01:56:57.840 --> 01:56:59.380]   and clinically helpful.
[01:56:59.380 --> 01:57:01.740]   Good example of this would be the drug wellbutrin,
[01:57:01.740 --> 01:57:03.240]   also called bupryron,
[01:57:03.240 --> 01:57:06.120]   which increases dopamine and norepinephrine.
[01:57:06.120 --> 01:57:07.800]   Wellbutrin and bupryron was developed
[01:57:07.800 --> 01:57:10.200]   as an alternative treatment for depression
[01:57:10.200 --> 01:57:12.840]   because some people who take the so-called SSRI,
[01:57:12.840 --> 01:57:15.560]   selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,
[01:57:15.560 --> 01:57:17.820]   which as the name suggests, increase serotonin,
[01:57:17.820 --> 01:57:21.360]   suffer from serotonin-related side effects,
[01:57:21.360 --> 01:57:24.720]   things like decreased appetite, decreased libido,
[01:57:24.720 --> 01:57:27.080]   or sometimes increased appetite
[01:57:27.080 --> 01:57:30.360]   or other side effects that they don't want.
[01:57:30.360 --> 01:57:34.200]   And wellbutrin seems to avoid the sexual side effects.
[01:57:34.200 --> 01:57:38.460]   It can blunt appetite and these sorts of things
[01:57:38.460 --> 01:57:40.540]   because of the increase in norepinephrine
[01:57:40.540 --> 01:57:44.480]   and dopamine increases levels of motivation and craving,
[01:57:44.480 --> 01:57:49.120]   but also can create a state of elevated alertness
[01:57:49.120 --> 01:57:52.120]   that can sometimes get in the way of healthy eating
[01:57:52.120 --> 01:57:52.960]   and things of that sort.
[01:57:52.960 --> 01:57:55.520]   So one has to work with their clinician,
[01:57:55.520 --> 01:57:57.960]   as a psychiatrist, it is a prescription drug,
[01:57:57.960 --> 01:57:59.920]   in order to find the dosage of wellbutrin
[01:57:59.920 --> 01:58:01.840]   that's correct for them.
[01:58:01.840 --> 01:58:04.400]   In addition, things like wellbutrin and bupryron
[01:58:04.400 --> 01:58:05.480]   can increase anxiety
[01:58:05.480 --> 01:58:08.200]   because of the way that dopamine and norepinephrine
[01:58:08.200 --> 01:58:10.080]   are stimulating and tend to place people
[01:58:10.080 --> 01:58:11.720]   into heightened levels of alertness.
[01:58:11.720 --> 01:58:14.640]   Nonetheless, many people have gained terrific relief
[01:58:14.640 --> 01:58:17.240]   from depression from wellbutrin and bupryron,
[01:58:17.240 --> 01:58:19.780]   and many of those same people had serious trouble
[01:58:19.780 --> 01:58:21.040]   with some of the SSRI.
[01:58:21.040 --> 01:58:24.000]   So it does seem to be a very useful drug in certain contexts,
[01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.840]   both for depression and for the treatment of smoking,
[01:58:26.840 --> 01:58:29.140]   for people desiring to quit smoking.
[01:58:29.140 --> 01:58:31.240]   And of course, there are a lot of people out there
[01:58:31.240 --> 01:58:34.800]   who are seeking to increase their baseline levels of dopamine
[01:58:34.800 --> 01:58:38.640]   without taking any prescription pharmaceutical compounds.
[01:58:38.640 --> 01:58:42.400]   And nowadays there exists a lot of supplements to do that.
[01:58:42.400 --> 01:58:44.760]   The two most common ones that are directly
[01:58:44.760 --> 01:58:48.400]   within the dopamine pathway are mucuna prurines,
[01:58:48.400 --> 01:58:53.400]   which is actually a velvety bean whose contents are L-DOPA.
[01:58:53.400 --> 01:58:56.280]   Believe it or not, the content of this bean
[01:58:56.280 --> 01:58:58.600]   is the precursor to dopamine.
[01:58:58.600 --> 01:59:01.480]   So mucuna prurines is sold over the counter,
[01:59:01.480 --> 01:59:03.160]   at least in the United States,
[01:59:03.160 --> 01:59:07.060]   and it literally is the precursor to dopamine.
[01:59:07.060 --> 01:59:08.160]   Meaning if you take it,
[01:59:08.160 --> 01:59:11.160]   you will experience very large increases in dopamine.
[01:59:11.160 --> 01:59:14.040]   Those increases are transient and very, very intense.
[01:59:14.040 --> 01:59:17.760]   And in fact, if you look at the constellation of effects
[01:59:17.760 --> 01:59:19.600]   of mucuna prurines,
[01:59:19.600 --> 01:59:21.480]   what you find is that they're pretty striking
[01:59:21.480 --> 01:59:25.640]   and they look a lot like, if not identical to L-DOPA.
[01:59:25.640 --> 01:59:28.360]   The most obvious of those is in the context
[01:59:28.360 --> 01:59:29.660]   of Parkinson's disease.
[01:59:29.660 --> 01:59:31.740]   There are at least five studies that have shown
[01:59:31.740 --> 01:59:35.160]   that mucuna prurines can reduce the symptoms
[01:59:35.160 --> 01:59:37.400]   of Parkinson's disease, much in the same way
[01:59:37.400 --> 01:59:41.280]   that L-DOPA can reduce the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
[01:59:41.280 --> 01:59:42.920]   And that shouldn't come as any surprise
[01:59:42.920 --> 01:59:43.840]   given what I just told you,
[01:59:43.840 --> 01:59:46.800]   that mucuna prurines is essentially L-DOPA.
[01:59:46.800 --> 01:59:50.240]   It also can reduce a particular hormone called prolactin.
[01:59:50.240 --> 01:59:51.860]   Dopamine and prolactin tend to be
[01:59:51.860 --> 01:59:53.880]   in somewhat push-pull fashion.
[01:59:53.880 --> 01:59:57.240]   When dopamine is up, prolactin is down, and vice versa.
[01:59:57.240 --> 01:59:59.600]   Prolactin is involved in milk let down in women.
[01:59:59.600 --> 02:00:02.300]   It's involved in setting the refractory period
[02:00:02.300 --> 02:00:06.000]   for sex after ejaculation in males.
[02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:07.800]   The reason mating can occur
[02:00:07.800 --> 02:00:09.520]   and then not occur after ejaculation
[02:00:09.520 --> 02:00:11.200]   is because of an increase in prolactin.
[02:00:11.200 --> 02:00:14.920]   Mucuna prurines is often used to blunt prolactin.
[02:00:14.920 --> 02:00:17.020]   And there are actually a couple of studies showing
[02:00:17.020 --> 02:00:18.480]   that it can indeed do that.
[02:00:18.480 --> 02:00:21.760]   Mucuna prurines has a number of other effects
[02:00:21.760 --> 02:00:24.900]   that lie in the sort of sex and reproduction pathway
[02:00:24.900 --> 02:00:26.000]   that are worth noting.
[02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:29.660]   Sperm concentration, sperm quality
[02:00:29.660 --> 02:00:32.520]   is actually greatly increased by mucuna prurines.
[02:00:32.520 --> 02:00:33.760]   These are kind of curious effects
[02:00:33.760 --> 02:00:35.000]   until you understand a little bit more
[02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:36.400]   about the biology of dopamine,
[02:00:36.400 --> 02:00:37.900]   which I'll mention in a moment.
[02:00:37.900 --> 02:00:41.680]   But there are several studies, four in fact,
[02:00:41.680 --> 02:00:46.680]   that describe how mucuna prurines can increase sperm count,
[02:00:46.680 --> 02:00:49.640]   sperm quality, and sperm motility.
[02:00:49.640 --> 02:00:52.360]   So for those of you seeking to conceive children,
[02:00:52.360 --> 02:00:54.940]   mucuna prurines might be an interesting choice
[02:00:54.940 --> 02:00:58.100]   if you're interested in exploring non-prescription compounds.
[02:00:58.100 --> 02:01:02.680]   However, I should mention that anytime you consume
[02:01:02.680 --> 02:01:07.680]   a substance that increases dopamine by mimicking dopamine
[02:01:07.680 --> 02:01:10.600]   or acting as a direct precursor to dopamine,
[02:01:10.600 --> 02:01:13.560]   there's almost inevitably a crash
[02:01:13.560 --> 02:01:16.440]   or a reduction in the baseline in dopamine
[02:01:16.440 --> 02:01:18.640]   that we referred to previously.
[02:01:18.640 --> 02:01:20.760]   So many people who take mucuna prurines
[02:01:20.760 --> 02:01:24.840]   feel really elevated, really motivated, really alert,
[02:01:24.840 --> 02:01:26.600]   all the sorts of things that one would expect
[02:01:26.600 --> 02:01:30.360]   from a dopaminergic drug, which mucuna prurines is,
[02:01:30.360 --> 02:01:34.720]   and then they feel a low or a reduction in drive
[02:01:34.720 --> 02:01:38.160]   and excitement and enthusiasm after the drug wears off,
[02:01:38.160 --> 02:01:40.160]   just like they would with any other
[02:01:40.160 --> 02:01:41.960]   dopamine-increasing compound.
[02:01:41.960 --> 02:01:45.340]   For that reason, many people have turned
[02:01:45.340 --> 02:01:47.360]   to the use of L-tyrosine.
[02:01:47.360 --> 02:01:50.760]   L-tyrosine is an amino acid precursor to L-DOPA,
[02:01:50.760 --> 02:01:54.160]   so it lies further up the dopamine synthesis pathway.
[02:01:54.160 --> 02:01:57.480]   And nowadays it's very common because L-tyrosine
[02:01:57.480 --> 02:02:00.040]   is sold over the counter in the United States,
[02:02:00.040 --> 02:02:02.860]   that people will take L-tyrosine as a way
[02:02:02.860 --> 02:02:06.120]   to get more energized, alert, and focused.
[02:02:06.120 --> 02:02:09.560]   Indeed, there are data that L-tyrosine will accomplish that.
[02:02:09.560 --> 02:02:13.160]   L-tyrosine is typically taken in capsule form
[02:02:13.160 --> 02:02:18.160]   or powder form, anywhere from 500 to 750 to 1,000 milligrams.
[02:02:18.160 --> 02:02:21.840]   It is a potent stimulus for increasing dopamine.
[02:02:21.840 --> 02:02:23.700]   And the timescale for increasing dopamine
[02:02:23.700 --> 02:02:26.480]   is about 30 to 45 minutes after ingestion,
[02:02:26.480 --> 02:02:28.340]   dopamine levels start to peak.
[02:02:28.340 --> 02:02:31.640]   The classic study that really nailed down the fact
[02:02:31.640 --> 02:02:34.000]   that tyrosine has this effect
[02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:36.720]   was published way back in 1983,
[02:02:36.720 --> 02:02:39.520]   Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism,
[02:02:39.520 --> 02:02:42.900]   that directly compared L-tyrosine supplementation
[02:02:42.900 --> 02:02:47.900]   with tryptophan ingestion on plasma dopamine and serotonin,
[02:02:47.900 --> 02:02:51.320]   tryptophan being a precursor to serotonin.
[02:02:51.320 --> 02:02:55.000]   And indeed what they found is that ingestion of L-tyrosine
[02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:58.800]   can increase the amount of dopamine circulating in the blood
[02:02:58.800 --> 02:03:00.740]   and in the brain too, of course.
[02:03:00.740 --> 02:03:04.540]   The tyrosine ingestion induced dopamine increases
[02:03:04.540 --> 02:03:07.640]   within 45 minutes, and they were short lasting.
[02:03:07.640 --> 02:03:10.960]   After about 30 minutes, the effect had dissipated,
[02:03:10.960 --> 02:03:13.940]   meaning the levels of dopamine had dropped down to baseline.
[02:03:13.940 --> 02:03:16.060]   And even though they didn't look at levels
[02:03:16.060 --> 02:03:19.140]   of baseline dopamine past that time point,
[02:03:19.140 --> 02:03:21.600]   the expectation based on everything we know
[02:03:21.600 --> 02:03:24.160]   about dopamine biology is that it would then drop
[02:03:24.160 --> 02:03:27.240]   below baseline due to the depletion
[02:03:27.240 --> 02:03:29.900]   of the readily reservable pool of dopamine vesicles
[02:03:29.900 --> 02:03:30.960]   that we talked about way back
[02:03:30.960 --> 02:03:33.320]   at the beginning of this episode.
[02:03:33.320 --> 02:03:35.760]   The nice thing about this study is it does show specificity
[02:03:35.760 --> 02:03:38.280]   of effect because ingestion of tryptophan
[02:03:38.280 --> 02:03:40.300]   did not increase dopamine.
[02:03:40.300 --> 02:03:42.320]   Instead, it increased serotonin.
[02:03:42.320 --> 02:03:44.260]   So there's really specificity of these pathways
[02:03:44.260 --> 02:03:46.580]   that rule out any placebo type effects.
[02:03:46.580 --> 02:03:50.280]   I'm not suggesting that anybody,
[02:03:50.280 --> 02:03:52.640]   everybody increase their dopamine levels
[02:03:52.640 --> 02:03:55.900]   by way of tyrosine and macuna purines.
[02:03:55.900 --> 02:03:57.460]   For those of you that are seeking to increase
[02:03:57.460 --> 02:03:59.780]   your dopamine levels without prescription drugs,
[02:03:59.780 --> 02:04:01.900]   those are the most direct route to that.
[02:04:01.900 --> 02:04:05.440]   Of course, if you have a preexisting dopaminergic condition,
[02:04:05.440 --> 02:04:08.640]   so schizophrenia or psychosis of any kind,
[02:04:08.640 --> 02:04:13.060]   bipolar, anxiety, things like macuna purines
[02:04:13.060 --> 02:04:15.860]   and L-tyrosine will not be good for you.
[02:04:15.860 --> 02:04:18.900]   And if you don't, you should just understand
[02:04:18.900 --> 02:04:21.260]   and expect that it's going to lead
[02:04:21.260 --> 02:04:23.340]   to an increase in dopamine.
[02:04:23.340 --> 02:04:25.140]   You'll certainly feel an elevated state.
[02:04:25.140 --> 02:04:27.820]   For some of you, that might be agitating.
[02:04:27.820 --> 02:04:29.580]   For some of you, that might be really pleasureful.
[02:04:29.580 --> 02:04:31.880]   And then you will feel a crash afterwards.
[02:04:31.880 --> 02:04:34.340]   How deep is that crash will really depend
[02:04:34.340 --> 02:04:38.300]   on your biology and where your dopamine baseline began.
[02:04:38.300 --> 02:04:41.020]   So I personally am not a fan of using things
[02:04:41.020 --> 02:04:43.620]   like macuna purines at all for myself,
[02:04:43.620 --> 02:04:45.680]   for the reasons I mentioned earlier,
[02:04:45.680 --> 02:04:48.280]   just too intense and too much of a crash.
[02:04:48.280 --> 02:04:50.700]   I do use L-tyrosine from time to time
[02:04:50.700 --> 02:04:52.460]   for enhancing focus and motivation,
[02:04:52.460 --> 02:04:55.180]   but I want to emphasize from time to time.
[02:04:55.180 --> 02:04:58.460]   So I might use it once a week, occasionally twice a week,
[02:04:58.460 --> 02:05:01.340]   but I've never been one to take L-tyrosine regularly
[02:05:01.340 --> 02:05:04.900]   in order to focus or train or do any kind of mental work.
[02:05:04.900 --> 02:05:08.940]   I just don't want to rely on any exogenous substance
[02:05:08.940 --> 02:05:12.320]   in order to get my dopamine circuits activated.
[02:05:12.320 --> 02:05:15.140]   And I don't want to experience the drop in dopamine
[02:05:15.140 --> 02:05:18.420]   that inevitably occurs some period of time afterwards.
[02:05:18.420 --> 02:05:22.260]   I should also mention things that can reduce your levels
[02:05:22.260 --> 02:05:23.960]   of baseline dopamine.
[02:05:23.960 --> 02:05:27.620]   One that is rarely discussed is melatonin.
[02:05:27.620 --> 02:05:30.460]   I have talked before on this podcast about melatonin,
[02:05:30.460 --> 02:05:33.220]   why I am not a fan of using melatonin
[02:05:33.220 --> 02:05:35.120]   in order to enhance sleep.
[02:05:35.120 --> 02:05:37.660]   It can help one get to sleep, but not stay asleep.
[02:05:37.660 --> 02:05:39.300]   Dr. Matt Walker, sleep expert
[02:05:39.300 --> 02:05:41.400]   from University of California, Berkeley.
[02:05:41.400 --> 02:05:43.840]   I think I don't want to put words in his mouth,
[02:05:43.840 --> 02:05:48.600]   but in our discussion about melatonin on this podcast,
[02:05:48.600 --> 02:05:51.400]   when Matt was a guest and in his book and on other podcasts,
[02:05:51.400 --> 02:05:54.660]   Matt has generally stated that the use of melatonin,
[02:05:54.660 --> 02:05:56.580]   except for treatment of jet lag,
[02:05:56.580 --> 02:05:59.740]   is generally not a good idea, and I agree.
[02:05:59.740 --> 02:06:03.180]   I think that melatonin is not often thought about
[02:06:03.180 --> 02:06:04.820]   as impacting the dopamine pathway,
[02:06:04.820 --> 02:06:08.660]   but there's at least one study published in 2001.
[02:06:08.660 --> 02:06:12.540]   First author is Nishiyama, just as it sounds.
[02:06:12.540 --> 02:06:14.480]   It's spelled just as it sounds.
[02:06:14.480 --> 02:06:16.420]   Acute effects of melatonin administration
[02:06:16.420 --> 02:06:19.020]   on cardiovascular autonomic regulation in healthy men.
[02:06:19.020 --> 02:06:21.800]   So the study wasn't specifically about dopamine,
[02:06:21.800 --> 02:06:24.180]   but they looked at norepinephrine and dopamine levels,
[02:06:24.180 --> 02:06:26.640]   and they found a significant,
[02:06:26.640 --> 02:06:29.740]   statistically significant decrease in dopamine
[02:06:29.740 --> 02:06:32.700]   60 minutes after melatonin administration.
[02:06:32.700 --> 02:06:36.060]   I've talked before about how viewing bright lights
[02:06:36.060 --> 02:06:38.160]   between the hours of 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.
[02:06:38.160 --> 02:06:40.500]   has been shown in studies by Dr. Samir Hattar,
[02:06:40.500 --> 02:06:42.900]   David Berson, excellent circadian scientists
[02:06:42.900 --> 02:06:46.980]   to reduce levels of dopamine for several days
[02:06:46.980 --> 02:06:48.280]   after that light exposure.
[02:06:48.280 --> 02:06:50.420]   So dim the lights at night.
[02:06:50.420 --> 02:06:53.660]   If you can, avoid exogenous melatonin,
[02:06:53.660 --> 02:06:56.260]   meaning if you don't have to take melatonin
[02:06:56.260 --> 02:06:58.060]   and you can find a better alternative,
[02:06:58.060 --> 02:06:58.960]   that would be a good idea
[02:06:58.960 --> 02:07:01.700]   if you want to maintain healthy levels of dopamine.
[02:07:01.700 --> 02:07:04.460]   Now, there is one compound that you are all familiar with
[02:07:04.460 --> 02:07:07.540]   and you've probably actually taken without realizing it
[02:07:07.540 --> 02:07:08.780]   that increases dopamine,
[02:07:08.780 --> 02:07:12.980]   and that's something called PEA for phenylethylamine,
[02:07:12.980 --> 02:07:16.060]   technically beta phenylethylamine.
[02:07:16.060 --> 02:07:19.180]   And PEA is found in various foods.
[02:07:19.180 --> 02:07:23.020]   Chocolate just happens to be one enriched in PEA
[02:07:23.020 --> 02:07:25.680]   and can increase synaptic levels of dopamine.
[02:07:25.680 --> 02:07:29.620]   I personally take PEA from time to time
[02:07:29.620 --> 02:07:32.700]   as a focus and work aid
[02:07:32.700 --> 02:07:35.400]   in order to do intense bouts of work.
[02:07:35.400 --> 02:07:36.860]   Again, I don't do that too often.
[02:07:36.860 --> 02:07:39.300]   This might be once a week or once every two weeks.
[02:07:39.300 --> 02:07:41.660]   I might use it for training, but typically I don't.
[02:07:41.660 --> 02:07:42.980]   It's usually for mental work.
[02:07:42.980 --> 02:07:46.180]   And I will take 500 milligrams of PEA
[02:07:46.180 --> 02:07:49.220]   and I'll take 300 milligrams of alpha-GPC.
[02:07:49.220 --> 02:07:50.800]   That's something that I personally do.
[02:07:50.800 --> 02:07:51.840]   That's what's right for me.
[02:07:51.840 --> 02:07:54.320]   It's within my margins of safety for my health.
[02:07:54.320 --> 02:07:55.940]   Again, you have to check with your doctor
[02:07:55.940 --> 02:07:57.920]   and decide what's right for you.
[02:07:57.920 --> 02:08:02.500]   It leads to a sharp but very transient increase in dopamine
[02:08:02.500 --> 02:08:05.500]   that lasts about 30 to 45 minutes.
[02:08:05.500 --> 02:08:06.760]   And at least in my system,
[02:08:06.760 --> 02:08:10.080]   I found to be much more regulated
[02:08:10.080 --> 02:08:13.280]   and kind of even than something like L-tyrosine
[02:08:13.280 --> 02:08:15.100]   and certainly much more regulated
[02:08:15.100 --> 02:08:17.440]   and even and lower dopamine release
[02:08:17.440 --> 02:08:20.200]   than something like macuna prurines.
[02:08:20.200 --> 02:08:22.820]   One of the lesser talked about compounds that's out there,
[02:08:22.820 --> 02:08:26.540]   but that's gaining popularity for increasing dopamine
[02:08:26.540 --> 02:08:28.300]   and as a so-called nootropic
[02:08:28.300 --> 02:08:30.580]   is something called Hooperzine A.
[02:08:30.580 --> 02:08:33.780]   Hooperzine A is a compound sold over the counter,
[02:08:33.780 --> 02:08:35.180]   at least in the United States,
[02:08:35.180 --> 02:08:38.100]   that can increase acetylcholine transmission,
[02:08:38.100 --> 02:08:40.380]   a different neuromodulator entirely.
[02:08:40.380 --> 02:08:42.580]   But what's interesting is that Hooperzine A
[02:08:42.580 --> 02:08:44.980]   somehow by way of interactions
[02:08:44.980 --> 02:08:48.200]   between the cholinergic system and the dopaminergic system
[02:08:48.200 --> 02:08:51.020]   leads to increases in dopamine
[02:08:51.020 --> 02:08:53.660]   in the medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus.
[02:08:53.660 --> 02:08:55.620]   Hippocampus, of course, being an area of the brain
[02:08:55.620 --> 02:08:57.180]   associated with learning and memory
[02:08:57.180 --> 02:08:58.980]   and prefrontal cortex being associated
[02:08:58.980 --> 02:09:02.300]   with the mesolimbic pathway decision-making focus, et cetera.
[02:09:02.300 --> 02:09:04.580]   And so I think the reason why we're seeing an increase
[02:09:04.580 --> 02:09:06.620]   in popularity of companies,
[02:09:06.620 --> 02:09:09.460]   including Hooperzine A and nootropic compounds
[02:09:09.460 --> 02:09:12.140]   is both for the cholinergic stimulating properties,
[02:09:12.140 --> 02:09:15.520]   but also for stimulating dopamine release.
[02:09:15.520 --> 02:09:17.500]   I personally have never tried Hooperzine A.
[02:09:17.500 --> 02:09:21.440]   You can go to examine.com or put Hooperzine A into PubMed
[02:09:21.440 --> 02:09:22.660]   if you'd like to search around
[02:09:22.660 --> 02:09:24.340]   and see some of the science behind it.
[02:09:24.340 --> 02:09:26.300]   Again, I'm not recommending anyone take these things.
[02:09:26.300 --> 02:09:28.460]   In fact, I recommend against anyone just diving in
[02:09:28.460 --> 02:09:29.620]   and starting to consume things
[02:09:29.620 --> 02:09:32.380]   without gaining knowledge about how they function
[02:09:32.380 --> 02:09:33.940]   and whether or not they're right for you.
[02:09:33.940 --> 02:09:36.080]   But nonetheless, I think in the years to come,
[02:09:36.080 --> 02:09:39.320]   we are going to see a lot more of L-tyrosine,
[02:09:39.320 --> 02:09:42.300]   PEA, phenylethylamine, and Hooperzine
[02:09:42.300 --> 02:09:44.720]   as a way of tapping into the dopaminergic
[02:09:44.720 --> 02:09:45.960]   and cholinergic circuits,
[02:09:45.960 --> 02:09:48.360]   certainly along with things like alpha-GPC
[02:09:48.360 --> 02:09:50.860]   as non-prescription, short-lived,
[02:09:50.860 --> 02:09:53.300]   somewhat milder alternatives
[02:09:53.300 --> 02:09:56.340]   to things that really spike dopamine,
[02:09:56.340 --> 02:09:57.740]   things like Adderall, Ritalin,
[02:09:57.740 --> 02:10:00.620]   Modafinil, R-Modafinil, and similar.
[02:10:00.620 --> 02:10:02.900]   And I can't help but share with you one more result.
[02:10:02.900 --> 02:10:04.900]   It's not related to pharmacology.
[02:10:04.900 --> 02:10:08.540]   It's related to behaviors and social interactions.
[02:10:08.540 --> 02:10:10.220]   And that's the very interesting,
[02:10:10.220 --> 02:10:12.340]   and I would say important finding
[02:10:12.340 --> 02:10:15.140]   that was made a few years ago by my colleague, Rob Malenka,
[02:10:15.140 --> 02:10:17.500]   who's in our department of psychiatry at Stanford,
[02:10:17.500 --> 02:10:20.820]   showing that oxytocin and social connection
[02:10:20.820 --> 02:10:24.740]   is actually directly stimulating the dopamine pathway.
[02:10:24.740 --> 02:10:27.940]   I think for many years, all of us, including me,
[02:10:27.940 --> 02:10:31.900]   would hear and thought that oxytocin
[02:10:31.900 --> 02:10:33.780]   was in the serotonergic pathway,
[02:10:33.780 --> 02:10:35.300]   that it was about pair bonding,
[02:10:35.300 --> 02:10:37.380]   and it was about some of these neuromodulators
[02:10:37.380 --> 02:10:40.080]   that were more associated with things related
[02:10:40.080 --> 02:10:43.500]   to feeling good with what we have in the present moment.
[02:10:43.500 --> 02:10:44.620]   That's typically what we think of
[02:10:44.620 --> 02:10:46.140]   when we think of the opioid system
[02:10:46.140 --> 02:10:48.080]   or the serotonergic system.
[02:10:48.080 --> 02:10:50.920]   The dopamine system is really about seeking and reward.
[02:10:50.920 --> 02:10:53.800]   But in a paper published in 2017 in the journal Science,
[02:10:53.800 --> 02:10:57.040]   excellent journal, the paper's titled
[02:10:57.040 --> 02:11:00.480]   "Gating of Social Reward by Oxytocin
[02:11:00.480 --> 02:11:02.580]   "in the Ventral Tegmental Area."
[02:11:02.580 --> 02:11:04.160]   You now know what the ventral tegmental area,
[02:11:04.160 --> 02:11:06.280]   it's that area of the mesolimbic pathway.
[02:11:06.280 --> 02:11:08.000]   What this paper essentially showed
[02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:11.320]   is that oxytocin, social connection,
[02:11:11.320 --> 02:11:15.000]   and pair bonding itself triggers dopamine release.
[02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:18.420]   And as everyone read this result, we all realized,
[02:11:18.420 --> 02:11:21.900]   ah, this makes total sense that for the evolution
[02:11:21.900 --> 02:11:23.840]   of our species, indeed for any species
[02:11:23.840 --> 02:11:26.640]   where social connections are important,
[02:11:26.640 --> 02:11:29.240]   it's also important to go seek social connections.
[02:11:29.240 --> 02:11:31.580]   And so while it's fun to think about pharmacology
[02:11:31.580 --> 02:11:34.900]   and underlying neural circuitry and cold water baths
[02:11:34.900 --> 02:11:38.500]   and all these different things related to dopamine schedules
[02:11:38.500 --> 02:11:41.300]   and reward mechanisms and attaching reward to effort
[02:11:41.300 --> 02:11:43.340]   and all the various things that we've talked about today
[02:11:43.340 --> 02:11:45.540]   in terms of science and tools and protocols,
[02:11:45.540 --> 02:11:49.700]   I'd be remiss if I didn't include description of this result
[02:11:49.700 --> 02:11:53.740]   and just emphasize that social connections,
[02:11:53.740 --> 02:11:55.860]   close social connections in particular
[02:11:55.860 --> 02:11:57.340]   that evoke oxytocin release.
[02:11:57.340 --> 02:12:01.200]   So those are romantic type, those are parent-child type,
[02:12:01.200 --> 02:12:02.680]   those are friendship related,
[02:12:02.680 --> 02:12:06.540]   and those can even be just friends at a distance related.
[02:12:06.540 --> 02:12:08.720]   It doesn't actually require skin contact
[02:12:08.720 --> 02:12:11.340]   to get oxytocin release,
[02:12:11.340 --> 02:12:13.340]   but oxytocin release is central
[02:12:13.340 --> 02:12:15.900]   to stimulating the dopamine pathways.
[02:12:15.900 --> 02:12:18.720]   So the take-home message there is quite simple,
[02:12:18.720 --> 02:12:24.060]   engage in, pursue quality, healthy social interactions.
[02:12:24.060 --> 02:12:26.300]   I know I've covered a lot of material today.
[02:12:26.300 --> 02:12:28.100]   I've really tried hard to focus on things
[02:12:28.100 --> 02:12:31.260]   that lie directly within the dopamine pathway
[02:12:31.260 --> 02:12:34.660]   and circuitries, as well as things that directly stimulate
[02:12:34.660 --> 02:12:36.940]   those pathways and circuitries.
[02:12:36.940 --> 02:12:39.560]   What I haven't talked about are all the things
[02:12:39.560 --> 02:12:42.880]   that indirectly serve the dopamine pathways.
[02:12:42.880 --> 02:12:44.320]   And out there on the internet,
[02:12:44.320 --> 02:12:46.360]   and indeed in the scientific literature,
[02:12:46.360 --> 02:12:47.640]   you will find, for instance,
[02:12:47.640 --> 02:12:50.200]   that things like maca root can increase dopamine,
[02:12:50.200 --> 02:12:53.520]   things like the gut microbiome can influence dopamine,
[02:12:53.520 --> 02:12:54.920]   and indeed they can,
[02:12:54.920 --> 02:12:57.040]   but they do that through indirect mechanisms
[02:12:57.040 --> 02:12:59.960]   by creating an environment, a milieu,
[02:12:59.960 --> 02:13:03.440]   in which dopamine and dopamine circuits can flourish.
[02:13:03.440 --> 02:13:04.800]   Maca is a good example of that.
[02:13:04.800 --> 02:13:06.320]   It will reduce cortisol,
[02:13:06.320 --> 02:13:09.380]   and through some indirect pathways related to cortisol
[02:13:09.380 --> 02:13:10.860]   can increase dopamine,
[02:13:10.860 --> 02:13:13.060]   but it's not a direct increase in dopamine.
[02:13:13.060 --> 02:13:15.180]   And so as a consequence, it's rather subtle
[02:13:15.180 --> 02:13:17.380]   compared to the various compounds and behaviors
[02:13:17.380 --> 02:13:18.740]   that I talked about today.
[02:13:18.740 --> 02:13:23.240]   Indeed, cold water exposure leads to huge increases
[02:13:23.240 --> 02:13:25.540]   in dopamine, as we talked about before,
[02:13:25.540 --> 02:13:27.520]   and very sustained ones at that.
[02:13:27.520 --> 02:13:31.000]   I realize in giving you a lot of information
[02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:32.560]   about science and mechanism,
[02:13:32.560 --> 02:13:34.660]   all the way from psychological and biological
[02:13:34.660 --> 02:13:36.500]   to circuitry and synaptic transmission,
[02:13:36.500 --> 02:13:39.100]   volumetric transmission, and so forth,
[02:13:39.100 --> 02:13:40.720]   that it might seem overwhelming.
[02:13:40.720 --> 02:13:42.560]   The most important things to understand
[02:13:42.560 --> 02:13:43.800]   are that these dopamine pathways
[02:13:43.800 --> 02:13:45.760]   really are under your control,
[02:13:45.760 --> 02:13:49.040]   and the locus of control resides in the fact
[02:13:49.040 --> 02:13:51.280]   that your previous levels of dopamine
[02:13:51.280 --> 02:13:54.060]   are influencing your levels of dopamine right now,
[02:13:54.060 --> 02:13:55.560]   and your current levels of dopamine
[02:13:55.560 --> 02:13:56.960]   and where you take them next
[02:13:56.960 --> 02:13:58.520]   will influence your dopamine levels
[02:13:58.520 --> 02:14:00.300]   in the next days and weeks to come.
[02:14:00.300 --> 02:14:04.000]   So I hope both with the mechanisms that you now have in hand
[02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:06.720]   plus some of the tools to tap into the dopaminergic system,
[02:14:06.720 --> 02:14:09.140]   both behavioral, pharmacologic, prescription,
[02:14:09.140 --> 02:14:10.760]   and non-prescription, et cetera,
[02:14:10.760 --> 02:14:12.180]   that you'll feel that you have more control
[02:14:12.180 --> 02:14:13.440]   over your dopamine system,
[02:14:13.440 --> 02:14:15.480]   and certainly that you have a better understanding
[02:14:15.480 --> 02:14:18.380]   of your dopamine system so that you can modulate
[02:14:18.380 --> 02:14:19.840]   and adjust your levels of dopamine
[02:14:19.840 --> 02:14:22.080]   in the ways that serve you best.

[02:15:18.320 --> 02:15:20.460]   Today and on previous podcast episodes,
[02:15:20.460 --> 02:15:22.360]   we talked a bit about supplements.
[02:15:22.360 --> 02:15:24.320]   Supplements certainly aren't necessary,
[02:15:24.320 --> 02:15:25.920]   but many people find them beneficial
[02:15:25.920 --> 02:15:27.920]   for things like adjusting their levels of dopamine
[02:15:27.920 --> 02:15:29.920]   or for other purposes.
[02:15:29.920 --> 02:15:31.080]   If you're going to use supplements,
[02:15:31.080 --> 02:15:33.280]   it's very important that the supplements you use
[02:15:33.280 --> 02:15:34.680]   be of very high quality
[02:15:34.680 --> 02:15:37.920]   and that the quantity of ingredients that are on the label
[02:15:37.920 --> 02:15:39.560]   match what's actually in those bottles.
[02:15:39.560 --> 02:15:42.840]   For that reason, we've partnered with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,
[02:15:42.840 --> 02:15:45.040]   because Thorne has the highest levels of stringency
[02:15:45.040 --> 02:15:46.560]   with respect to quality
[02:15:46.560 --> 02:15:48.840]   and how much of each supplement
[02:15:48.840 --> 02:15:51.040]   they put in the products that they sell.
[02:15:51.040 --> 02:15:52.840]   If you'd like to see the supplements that I take,
[02:15:52.840 --> 02:15:57.840]   you can go to thorne.com/u/huberman.
[02:15:57.840 --> 02:15:59.260]   And there you can see what I take.
[02:15:59.260 --> 02:16:02.000]   You can get 20% off any of those supplements.
[02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:04.040]   And if you navigate into the Thorne site
[02:16:04.040 --> 02:16:05.640]   through that portal,
[02:16:05.640 --> 02:16:08.020]   then you can get 20% off any of the supplements
[02:16:08.020 --> 02:16:09.060]   that Thorne makes.
[02:16:09.060 --> 02:16:11.180]   If you're not already following us on Instagram
[02:16:11.180 --> 02:16:12.740]   at Huberman Lab, please do so.
[02:16:12.740 --> 02:16:15.960]   There I teach neuroscience tools and information.
[02:16:15.960 --> 02:16:17.580]   Oftentimes it's tools and information
[02:16:17.580 --> 02:16:19.660]   that I don't cover on the podcast.
[02:16:19.660 --> 02:16:22.280]   We're also on Twitter, also at Huberman Lab.
[02:16:22.280 --> 02:16:24.500]   And last, but certainly not least,
[02:16:24.500 --> 02:16:26.320]   thank you for your interest in science.
[02:16:26.320 --> 02:16:28.900]   [upbeat music]
