[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.280]   We get loads of email questions about decision-making and the will of God, like this one today
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.240]   from a long-time listener to the podcast named Zach.
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.960]   "Pastor John, please help me.
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:21.680]   Should there always be a peace and calm about decisions before we make those decisions with
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:22.680]   confidence?"
[00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.200]   What would you say to Zach?
[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:33.160]   I'm not sure Zach is asking this exactly the way he wants to.
[00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.440]   Not to read Zach's mind, but I could be misunderstanding.
[00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:44.680]   It sounds like he wants to know whether he can choose, quote, "with confidence" that
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:50.380]   something is right to do if he doesn't have peace and calm before he chooses.
[00:00:50.380 --> 00:01:00.520]   But acting with confidence, by its very nature, it seems to me, implies the conscience is
[00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:01.520]   clear.
[00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.760]   That's how you have this strong confidence.
[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.720]   There is a kind of peace there if you're acting with confidence.
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.440]   So the way he puts the question seems all ready to contain the answer.
[00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:21.960]   You can only act with confidence if your action is untroubled by doubt and guilt.
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.720]   That's what "with confidence" means.
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.640]   But not to be too picky.
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.520]   I don't think that's what Zach is really asking.
[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:37.720]   I think what he means is, and this is a hard question, should you act, should you choose
[00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:48.480]   an action, if there is a lack of peace and a lack of calm in your heart about the decision?
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.720]   I think that's what he's asking.
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.040]   It's a good question.
[00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:58.000]   My guess is that behind that question are a couple of passages of Scripture that he
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.280]   has been taught or read over the years.
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:10.720]   Colossians 3:15, "Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to which indeed you were
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.960]   called in the one body, and be thankful."
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.720]   So, peace of Christ ruling in your heart.
[00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:22.000]   Or the other one is Philippians 4, 6, "Don't be anxious about anything, but in everything
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.840]   by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your request be made known to God, and
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:40.520]   the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds in Christ
[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:41.520]   Jesus."
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:47.880]   So, if we put those two texts together, Colossians and Philippians, if we put them together,
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:56.520]   it seems like the peace of Christ or the peace of God should function in our minds and hearts
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:05.920]   to hold sway there and protect, guard the mind and the heart from forces that would
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:14.000]   ruin the ability of the mind and the heart to trust God and to think rightly about his
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.440]   character and his will.
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:26.200]   So Zach is right to connect the peace that Christ gives to his followers and the decisions
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.560]   that we have to make.
[00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.560]   There's a connection.
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.880]   So the question now remains, and now it has some biblical support behind it to make it
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.840]   all the more crucial.
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:43.480]   Should we act, should we choose an action, if there is a lack of peace or a lack of calm
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.720]   in our heart about the decision?
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.240]   And let me make just several observations to point to an answer.
[00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:59.960]   Number one, what Paul does not say in those two texts is that peace and calm are the only
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:06.140]   factors in determining what one ought to do.
[00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:13.540]   The point of peace ruling in the heart is not to help you decide whether to obey explicit
[00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.440]   commands of the apostle.
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.360]   For example, when Paul says in Romans 12, 14, "Bless those who persecute you.
[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.200]   Bless and do not curse them."
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:28.080]   He does not mean that this command is optional if you happen not to have peace about it.
[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:33.880]   The explicit commands of Scripture are to be obeyed, yes, ideally with a heart of great
[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:42.240]   peace and great calm, but in the absence of that peace, we should confess our sinful anxiety
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.320]   and obey anyway.
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.960]   Bless those who persecute you.
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.280]   Bless and do not curse them.
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:48.440]   So that's the first observation.
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.080]   Here's the second one.
[00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:59.680]   When it comes to choices that are not explicitly commanded or prohibited in Scripture but depend
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:08.320]   on wisdom in the situation, the state of our hearts and our minds, the presence or absence
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.600]   of peace and calm do matter.
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:18.420]   For example, Paul said in Romans 14, 23, "Whatever does not proceed, whatever behavior does not
[00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:23.160]   proceed from faith is sin."
[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:31.800]   Now I think that means if you act against your conscience, even if what you do is not
[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:36.560]   objectively wrong, it is sin for you to do it.
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:45.840]   And so, insofar as peace and calm are missing as a fruit of faith, when you have doubts
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:51.320]   about a decision, then going ahead with the decision is sin.
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:56.120]   And let me just throw out a recommendation here for a book by Andrew Nacelle and J.D.
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:01.200]   Crowley called "Conscience," who tackles that kind of thing.
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:04.040]   Third observation.
[00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:14.600]   Remember that our peace and calm can be disturbed as we make a decision, not only by whether
[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:20.440]   the decision is right or wrong, but our peace and calm can be disturbed by whether the decision
[00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:23.400]   will be costly or not.
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:31.600]   So if you're about to make a decision to do something good for somebody, and your conscience
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:39.400]   is not disturbed that it might be wrong, but your heart is disturbed that it might be painful,
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.240]   do it.
[00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:49.320]   Lack of peace over possible danger and lack of peace over possible sinning are not the
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.320]   same.
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:53.480]   Last observation.
[00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:58.120]   It is always right to be free from anxiety, if you can be.
[00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:59.720]   You should be.
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:05.640]   We are commanded not to be anxious about anything, Philippians 4.4.
[00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:10.280]   We will not arrive at this perfect state in this life.
[00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:13.080]   That's my view of sanctification.
[00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:15.800]   We should have perfect peace all the time.
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:17.440]   We don't, and we won't.
[00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:21.240]   But we should fight for it, pray for it, aspire to it.
[00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:27.080]   But it should be something we lay hold on if we can, by faith.
[00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:35.280]   In fact, the closer we come to peaceful, cheerful, loving acts, even in the face of loss and
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:41.600]   pain, the more clearly the light of Christ's worth will shine through us.
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:42.600]   Amen.
[00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:49.000]   And that's why we exist, to reflect the worth of Christ to the world, imaging, reflecting
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   the perfect image.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.600]   Thank you, Pastor John.

[00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:17.960]   Well, we love to proclaim the truths of Christian hedonism, the idea that God is most glorified
[00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:21.640]   in us when we are most satisfied in him.
[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:25.960]   But how do we parent our kids to understand these precious truths at an age-appropriate
[00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:27.960]   level that they can understand?
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:32.320]   Grandfather John Piper will take a stab at what this would look like in family devotions
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:36.920]   today and he will help us understand what points a parent would want to emphasize in
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:37.920]   those conversations.
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:42.040]   I've been looking forward to this topic and this episode for a really long time.
[00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:43.880]   We're finally going to tackle it on Wednesday.
[00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:44.880]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
