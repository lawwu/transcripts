[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.880]   The second chapter of the Book of the Acts of the Apostles, from the fourteenth verse
[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:13.300]   to the thirty-sixth verse. Because there, as you saw, we have one complete statement,
[00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:20.240]   namely the sermon which was preached by the Apostle Peter in the city of Jerusalem on
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:26.840]   the day of Pentecost. Now that was a most notable and vital day, not only in the history
[00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.240]   of the Christian Church, but in the history of the whole world. One of those great turning
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:39.800]   points in history. One of those points, especially, without which, and without understanding which,
[00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:46.480]   it is quite impossible to have any correct notion as to the character and the nature
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:53.480]   of the Christian Church and of the Christian message. And that is why I am calling your
[00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:59.840]   attention to it. Here we have the first sermon that was ever preached under the auspices
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:08.480]   of the Christian Church, as she has become known to us. And therefore, this sermon has
[00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:15.200]   an unusual importance. Now, I am holding it before you for this reason. We are obviously
[00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:23.780]   confronted by confusion concerning what is Christianity, what is the Christian Church.
[00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.880]   Terrible confusion with regard to this. And my simple argument is that if we really want
[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.720]   to know the answer to those questions, well then, the obvious thing to do is to go back
[00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.800]   to the beginning and to the origin. And this is the only history that we have. What references
[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:46.480]   there are in secular history confirm this, but this is the only authoritative history
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:51.240]   that we have. It is not a question of your opinion or mine as to what the Churches are
[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.740]   ought to be, nor what the Christian messages are ought to be. The question before us is,
[00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:02.880]   what is it actually? What was it that produced the Christian Church? What was it that the
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.120]   Christian Church preached at the beginning? Well, we have got an answer to that question
[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:13.420]   here in this chapter. Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice and said unto
[00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:22.720]   them. And then, there we have the sermon. Now, I am calling attention to this, I say,
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:31.440]   because we are confronted by this fact, this tragic fact, that the world speaking generally
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:37.560]   is not interested in this message. At any rate, we know with regard to our own country
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:44.600]   that the vast majority of the people are not interested in it at all. Ninety percent of
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:50.920]   the population are not interested at all in the Christian message, nor in the Christian
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:03:02.440]   Church. Now, I say, that is a very staggering fact, because here we are in a world which
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:12.120]   we do not understand. We understand it less and less. I was reading a learned article
[00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:18.760]   the other day, or an article in a learned journal, and it put this fact before us. And,
[00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:28.680]   of course, it is the simple truth. Towards the last quarter of the last century, scientists
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:40.440]   have become exceedingly confident and optimistic. Even great men like Lord Kelvin did not hesitate
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:47.040]   to say that it was merely a matter of time before all the secrets of nature would have
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:54.840]   been discovered. That was the kind of confident note with which they faced the whole of life.
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:00.920]   Studies had been made, inventions had been made. Men were getting to understand increasingly
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:07.080]   the secrets of life through scientific research and endeavour, and they thus became quite
[00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:15.080]   confident that it was merely a matter of time—a very short time, they felt—before all these
[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:22.040]   secrets would be open to our sight and fully revealed. And I think the quotation in that
[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:27.360]   article of Lord Kelvin was a particularly important one, because he was one of the sanest
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.920]   of them all, and one of the best men amongst them—a great man in every sense of the word.
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:39.080]   But that is what he said. But the article went on to point out, quite rightly, that
[00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:48.560]   in a very short time indeed, all such notions and ideas were completely exploded. By what?
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:56.680]   Well, by further discoveries of science. The discovery of X-rays shattered that optimism.
[00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:03.560]   The moment they discovered X-rays, the idea that you would soon understand all the mystery
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:12.040]   of the universe had gone once and forever. Radium increased it, and then later discoveries
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:17.040]   in this century of the nature of the atom, and so on, has just exploded it completely.
[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:22.480]   The whole thing has become so mysterious that we know less and less and less. Now, that's
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:28.920]   the sort of world in which we find ourselves. The whole universe is a mystery. But apart
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:39.960]   from that, life itself—what is it? What's the object and the purpose of it all? What
[00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:51.280]   are we doing here? And then, of course, death. Here it is, this inevitable thing to which
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:06:02.120]   everybody is tempted. What is it? What lies beyond it? We're only here for a short while—three
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:08.120]   score years and tenths of the Bible's sum taken beyond it, yes, ninety, and even more.
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:14.200]   But it comes, it's bound to come. Now, what I'm putting to you is this. Isn't
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:22.360]   it amazing and astonishing that, confronted by all our ignorance about the universe, about
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:31.200]   ourselves, about life, death, and eternity, isn't it astonishing that mankind still
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:41.440]   will not consider, not look at, speaking generally, the only book, the only teaching that really
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:48.040]   gives us even a modicum of explanation and of understanding? Now, I suggest to you that
[00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:55.400]   that is an astounding thing, that the world can still go on in its fatal optimism in spite
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:07:00.800]   of facts which are shaking it, even their own discoveries as I've illustrated to you,
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:07.560]   and even facts and events such as the prominent and uppermost in our minds undoubtedly gathered
[00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:11.240]   this evening, and all the people probably of this country.
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:17.640]   Now, what I'm saying is a mystery of how men and women, in such a position, in such
[00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:29.640]   a condition, can go on without insisting upon, and knowing and understanding, at any rate,
[00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:36.000]   the teaching and the message of this gospel and of this book. Now, that's the thing that
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.800]   is before us, and that's why I'm calling your attention to it, for I'm here to assert
[00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:45.760]   once more that, apart from what we've got here, there is no guidance, there is no help
[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:51.680]   at all. And that's not a mere assertion. I could demonstrate it to you. I would ask
[00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:59.520]   you to produce any guidance, any hope whatsoever, anywhere else. It isn't there. The scientists
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:06.440]   don't know. The philosophers don't know. The politicians and statesmen don't know.
[00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:11.960]   This is the only word that comes to us. And yet, you see, as we've been seeing in our
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:17.560]   consideration of this subject on past Sunday nights, people turn away from it. They ignore
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:23.360]   it, or else dismiss it, or else they misunderstand it completely, to such an extent that it becomes
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:28.600]   pointless and meaningless, because, as I was trying to show last Sunday night, if it's
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:33.920]   just a question of philosophy and simply a matter of thinking and postulating certain
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:38.600]   things and arriving at certain conclusions with your great minds and brains, well, there
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:42.480]   are two things to be said. One is that, with all your philosophy, you'll never arrive
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:47.160]   at knowledge. You can only put up theories and suppositions, and you've got to be an
[00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:57.120]   able, exceptional person in order to do that. So it isn't that. Neither is it, as I said,
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:06.240]   simply a kind of glorified paganism. Oh, what a lot of paganism passes for Christianity.
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:15.280]   It's nothing but sheer paganism. All official religion is more pagan than Christian. It
[00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:20.680]   isn't that, as we tried to see last Sunday night. No, no, it's the activity of the living
[00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:27.080]   God. It's the thing that we have here. But now, we've looked at all that, and I've tried
[00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:32.600]   to show that this, again, isn't a matter of theory. If you say to me, "But that's simply
[00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:38.140]   your ideas over against the others," my answer is, "It isn't. It isn't. I haven't propounded
[00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:43.320]   a theory. I'm simply confronted by historical facts. I start with the fact of the Christian
[00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:47.440]   church. I say, "Where did she come from? What was her origin?" Here's the answer. It all
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:53.440]   comes back to this. And when you come back to this, you come to something which is entirely
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:58.600]   different from what passes in the minds of so many people as Christianity, both the nature
[00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:04.280]   of the church and the character of her message. It's something entirely different. And it's
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:09.160]   because people don't know that, that they're not interested in it and turn away from it,
[00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:15.760]   and are left to their own misery and unhappiness, disturbed, I say, by events, shaken for a
[00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:20.640]   moment when they stand over an open grave, but rushing away to take a drink, or plunge
[00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:25.400]   into pleasure, or look at the television, and forget all about it. Now, I'm suggesting
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:30.720]   that that's not intelligent, apart from anything else. By just dismissing a thing, and brushing
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:35.040]   it away, and turning your back upon it, you're not acting in an intelligent manner. Now,
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:42.200]   here is a message that asks us all to think, and to face solid facts of history. And that
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:50.520]   is why I come back to it once more this evening. Now, let's put it like this this evening.
[00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:55.460]   Another reason which people very often give for not being Christian, and for not being
[00:10:55.460 --> 00:11:02.780]   interested at all in Christianity and the message of the Christian church, is this.
[00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:09.840]   They dismiss it as they think, finally and completely, in terms of what is called psychology.
[00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:15.560]   Psychology. Now, this takes many different forms. The argument, in its essence, we can
[00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:20.880]   put like this. They say, "Now, Batoukian, here are you people, claiming to have your
[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:26.640]   religious experiences, and people like you have claimed this throughout the centuries."
[00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:31.320]   And people used to think, of course, that all this was very real. But now, we know.
[00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:38.800]   That's how they put it. We know, as the result of psychology. And incidentally, when I was
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:43.960]   talking about the assertion of Lord Kelvin just now, the answer was given to Lord Kelvin
[00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:50.600]   not merely by the discovery of X-rays, but perhaps quite as much by the new theories
[00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:58.640]   of a man called Freud, and his school of psychology, which shook the whole situation in a similar
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:06.360]   manner. Now, the argument is this. Well, yes, of course, there are certain people who belong
[00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:11.920]   to a certain type. We recognize that there are certain types of people. We're not all
[00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:17.720]   the same. And we are made in different ways, we have different temperaments, and we react
[00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:24.040]   in different ways to the same set of facts. And, well, that's all right. We discover that,
[00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:30.880]   and we recognize these things as facts. And we've discovered, furthermore, that people
[00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:37.440]   tend to do certain things with their experiences. People used to think that there was a great
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:43.200]   God in the heavens, and that everything was under God. Of course, we now have discovered
[00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:49.200]   as the result of psychological research that there's nothing really there at all. But people
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:55.240]   sort of conjure up an idea of some kind of great father figure, someone who's over all.
[00:12:55.240 --> 00:13:00.840]   Certain things, you see, frighten them. And they say, "Well, now, what is this? Ah, they
[00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:05.640]   say it must be some great being outside us." Of course, there's nothing there. It's their
[00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:12.480]   projecting their own feelings, their own sensations. That's the essence of religion. Now, they
[00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:21.680]   say it's very interesting. So they now ask us to look at the science of the development
[00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:26.120]   of religions, the philosophy of religion, as they call it. And they say, "This is what
[00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:31.000]   you find." The further back you go in the story of the human race, the more primitive
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:38.680]   people are, well, the more superstitious they are, the more frightened they are of life.
[00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:44.440]   The primitive native is always frightened of everything, and he tends to personalize
[00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:51.120]   everything. He hears a thunder clap, and he says, "Oh, there's some great being up there.
[00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:59.240]   He's just roared, or he's shouted. Flash of lightning, he's struck some tinder or something."
[00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:05.320]   And so they turned all this into gods. Now, they say, "That's primitive men. He sees
[00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:09.120]   a flower, and he sees it growing. He says, 'Why is that?' Well, there must be a spirit
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:14.600]   in it." And so on. Now, they start, you see, and then they say, "You trace all this up,
[00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:21.320]   and as people grow and develop and begin to use their minds, this becomes less crude in
[00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:30.640]   its form, and you go up the scale, and you'll find fewer and fewer gods." And eventually,
[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:36.560]   you arrive at the Jews, who reached the topmost pinnacle of all in this development, and said
[00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:41.960]   there's only one God, and that the others were not gods at all. But, of course, they
[00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:47.960]   say, even the Jews were wrong. They advance tremendously. It's a great advance to have
[00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:53.280]   only one God, instead of having dozens of gods. But, of course, the point is, they say,
[00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:59.040]   we now know that there isn't even one. And even the most intelligent people, not only
[00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:05.440]   the Jews, but Christian people, are still just doing the same old thing. They're objectifying
[00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:10.160]   their fears and phobias and all these other things, and they've put them all together
[00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:18.000]   in a being, in a person, whom they call God. In other words, they say that that is the
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.640]   total and the sole explanation of religion, and of Christianity, which is a still higher
[00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:31.440]   and modified form of the religion of the Jews. Now, there's the argument, and I'm very
[00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:38.480]   concerned about this for this reason, that very often I find that Christian people don't
[00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:46.120]   dare to answer it, and have often indeed lended support even to that argument. Now, they do
[00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:52.280]   it like this, if I may put it in the form of a personal experience. Back, I think it
[00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:58.680]   was in 1935, I had the privilege of taking part in a summer school of ministers in a
[00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:08.720]   certain part of this country, and one evening we had a discussion, and I was most interested
[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:13.800]   to notice, I was in charge of the discussion, I was most interested to notice that certain
[00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:19.000]   men who were arguing from the same position as I was, were giving me, in a sense, more
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:24.080]   trouble than the people with whom we were arguing. And they were doing it for this reason.
[00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:27.920]   They got up one after another, and they said something like this, and how often has one
[00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:33.200]   heard it? "Now," they said to the others, "it doesn't matter what you may say, I don't
[00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:38.600]   care what scientific evidence you produce, you can argue as you like, and with your learning
[00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:46.120]   you can riddle my Bible and take most of it from me, and science can prove this and that,
[00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:55.240]   but you'll never take from me my experience." Now, why do I criticize that? Well, I criticize
[00:16:55.240 --> 00:17:00.160]   that for the reason that I had to give that night. While these men thought that in that
[00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:07.440]   way, they were answering the scientists, they were simply delivering themselves lock, stock
[00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:13.320]   and barrel into the arms of the psychologists. "Quite so," said the psychologists, "that's
[00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:18.280]   exactly the trouble with you religious people. You shut your eyes to all the facts, you say
[00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:25.320]   my experience." But of course, they said, "we can explain your experience quite simply."
[00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:32.640]   Look at this man who says he's had an experience of God and has felt the presence of God and
[00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:38.720]   all. What is it? Well, they say, if you could only really analyze that man, you'd probably
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:45.680]   find that on some given occasion, he was terrified by his own father. He'd done something he
[00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:52.880]   shouldn't do, and his father came and reprimanded him very severely and perhaps smacked him.
[00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:59.720]   This began to rankle and it built up until it became this idea of God. In other words,
[00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:04.960]   the moment you base the whole of your position upon your experiences, and so many Christians
[00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:10.840]   do that. Now, don't misunderstand me. I believe in the validity of these experiences. All
[00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:16.000]   I'm trying to show you is this. You cannot base the Christian message on experiences,
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:21.200]   because these men come along with their explanations. And then, of course, they go further and they
[00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:26.960]   say this, "well, of course, you say that the only explanation of these experiences
[00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:31.400]   is your Christian message. But of course, we know something about the cults. We've
[00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:35.960]   heard similar things about the Christian scientists. They say, 'I used to be worried and troubled,
[00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:40.080]   you know, and everything was a burden to me, but now, since I've taken up this teaching,
[00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:45.520]   I'm never ill, I'm never worried, I sleep perfectly at night, marvellous!' And so,
[00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:51.360]   many of the other cults offer exactly the same explanation. So I'm arguing that if
[00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:56.680]   you base your position or put the Christian case in terms of some wonderful experience
[00:18:56.680 --> 00:19:02.480]   you've had, or in terms of 'come to Jesus and you'll find a friend', or 'come to
[00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:06.920]   Jesus you'll get physical healing', 'come to Jesus you'll get guidance', 'come to
[00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:11.160]   Jesus you'll get peace, joy', or any one of these things, I say if you put it like
[00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:22.880]   that, you're just giving over the case to this psychological explanation of these phenomena
[00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:28.320]   and experiences of which you talk so much. My dear friends, that is not the basis of
[00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:32.280]   the Christian faith. Because you see, a man can come to you and say, 'well, all right,
[00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:36.200]   I'm very interested in your experience. You tell me that you used to be a very worried
[00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:39.920]   person, but that since you've become a Christian you've never worried again.' You know,
[00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:44.040]   he says, 'I'm very interested in that as a fact and as a phenomenon, but it has nothing
[00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:48.320]   to do with me. I never have been a worrier.' And then another one says, 'but look here,
[00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:51.560]   I have physical healing, you know.' 'Well, fortunately,' says this man, 'I've never
[00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:55.880]   been ill. I enjoy wonderful health.' And so on, you go through the whole gamut of your
[00:19:55.880 --> 00:20:00.680]   experiences, and he says, 'well, it's all right, I'm quite prepared to accept it,
[00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:06.080]   and I'm very glad that you're better than you used to be. I'm thankful for any kind
[00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:10.560]   of agency that can deliver people from their troubles and their problems. I think they
[00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:14.640]   may be very wrong in their explanation of the many of them, but as long as it makes
[00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:19.360]   them feel better and happier, all well and good, carry on. But don't say that it's
[00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:25.120]   got anything to do with me. Don't say that I, Otto, come and have the same thing simply
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:29.800]   because you've got it. We're obviously different kinds of persons, and I really don't need
[00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:35.360]   what you're talking about. I find life going very happily and very smoothly. I've got
[00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:39.440]   a good job, I'm earning good money, I've got a wife and children, we've got a wonderful
[00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:45.360]   house and home. There's really nothing that I can desire, and you come with your great
[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:50.260]   stories and you ask me to take this, that, and the other. The answer is, thank you, but
[00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:56.860]   I don't need it. And you see, the vast majority of the people of this country are in precisely
[00:20:56.860 --> 00:21:01.680]   that position tonight. And you can stand before them and say, 'come to Jesus,' and you'll
[00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:09.920]   have this, that, and the other. Not interested. Now then, that, I say, is the kind of fallacy
[00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:16.200]   which is to be seen on both sides, by many who reject the Gospel and by many who believe
[00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:21.040]   it, who are not understanding it as they should do. What's the answer to that? Now then,
[00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:28.160]   the answer to that is Peter's sermon on the day of Pentecost. What do you mean, Sir Simon?
[00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:32.400]   Well, what I mean is this. Why does Peter preach? He preaches in order to give them
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:39.120]   an explanation of what they could see. Here were these people in Jerusalem suddenly confronted
[00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:46.440]   by a body of men and women who were obviously very simple people, fishermen and others.
[00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:53.720]   And they may have known them before, but they suddenly find these people entirely changed.
[00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:57.800]   Something astounding and amazing has happened to them, and the people we are told they were
[00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:02.040]   all amazed and marveled, saying one to another. When this was noised abroad, the multitude
[00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:06.200]   came together and were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his own
[00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:09.960]   language. Some of them said, 'these men are full of new wine, these men are drunk,
[00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:17.120]   what is this?' Now, you see, they're confronted by a phenomenon, by an experience, by a change
[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:22.000]   in the lives of men and women. And the whole question is, what is it? What's done this?
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:28.080]   And what Peter does in his sermon is to give the answer to that question. And you notice
[00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:34.440]   what he does. He doesn't just talk about his experience. He didn't just get up and
[00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:37.880]   say, 'you know, it's wonderful, and you people can have the same thing, you know,
[00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:42.160]   this is marvellous, this is.' That isn't what he did at all. He says, 'this is that
[00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:46.760]   which was spoken.' And he begins to quote a prophet, and then quotes another prophet,
[00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:54.840]   and expounds the Scriptures. In addition, he expounds these Scriptures in terms of certain
[00:22:54.840 --> 00:23:02.400]   facts. The whole of this sermon is a recital of facts, and an explanation of them, put
[00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:09.540]   in this most interesting manner. Peter says, 'now then, we are witnesses of these things.'
[00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:13.640]   But indeed, he addresses them, 'ye men of Israel, hear these words, Jesus and Nazareth,
[00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:19.280]   a man approved of God among you, by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him
[00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:29.520]   in the midst of you, as you yourselves also now.' He's pointing them to objective facts.
[00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:37.240]   And then he works out his great argument. You see, the essence of the argument is this.
[00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:46.320]   What is this, you say? Well now, says Peter, I can only explain this to you in terms of
[00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:54.880]   a person called Jesus of Nazareth. He is the sole explanation of this, which you're looking
[00:23:54.880 --> 00:24:01.240]   at and which you're trying to understand. So, you notice that in the body of his sermon,
[00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:07.160]   he gives them again a recital and a reminder of these facts. Jesus of Nazareth, a man of
[00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:12.520]   Israel, a man approved of God among you, miracles, wonders, signs, which God did by him in the
[00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:17.920]   midst of you, as you yourselves also now, him being delivered by the determinate counsel
[00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:23.480]   and foreknowledge of God, you have taken him by wicked hands and crucified and slain, whom
[00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:29.360]   God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death, because it was not possible that
[00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:33.920]   he should be holden of it. Now, what this comes to is this. He gives them a recital
[00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:39.120]   of the facts. He says, if you want to understand what's happened to us, if you want to understand
[00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:46.760]   this amazing phenomenon, you've got to look at that person, Jesus of Nazareth. So he tells
[00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:52.960]   them about his birth again, about his life, about his teaching, especially about his death
[00:24:52.960 --> 00:25:00.760]   upon the cross, his burial in a grave, and then resurrection, and his ascension, and
[00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:05.560]   this thing which had just happened to them on the day of Pentecost. Now, you see, the
[00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:13.360]   apostle's argument can be put in this form. He says this wouldn't have happened to us
[00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:20.920]   were it not for those facts, were it not that he has risen from the dead and has appeared
[00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:26.960]   to us, nothing would have happened. It is because of these facts that this has happened
[00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:33.800]   to us. You see, his argument can be put in this form. He is claiming that this Jesus
[00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:41.160]   of Nazareth is the only begotten Son of God. And he says what proves that is his resurrection
[00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:47.720]   from the dead. So he has this quotation, this long quotation that I read to you from David.
[00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:52.680]   He says, you know, David foresaw this and he prophesied this, and he was talking about
[00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:57.120]   this thing which has happened because David himself, he says, is dead and buried, and
[00:25:57.120 --> 00:26:01.400]   his sepulchre is still with us. But the thing he says that has made the difference is that
[00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:08.040]   this Jesus whom you crucified and who died and was buried has risen again. And he has
[00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:14.280]   ascended to heaven and has sent down this power, even as he promised he would do. And
[00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:19.760]   Peter's argument is it is the sole explanation of this thing that has happened to us. Now,
[00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:25.200]   you notice, you see, he doesn't answer in terms of a theory. He doesn't make a psychological
[00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:29.840]   analysis. He doesn't try to explain it. He says, I have only one explanation, and it
[00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:34.440]   is this person whom you have seen, whom you have heard, whose miracles you have witnessed,
[00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:40.840]   you are witnesses of these things. And here he has risen, even as he said he would, and
[00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:46.320]   he has sent forth this gift of the Spirit, even again as he said he would. Now then,
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:54.480]   Peter puts before them facts. It doesn't matter what your temperament is. It doesn't
[00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:59.080]   matter what your psychological makeup may happen to be or may not be. My friends, I
[00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:08.920]   am here to remind you of certain historical facts of history. May I put it like this to
[00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:16.360]   you, to fix it in your minds. This may well be known as the age of Winston Churchill,
[00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:27.720]   fact of history. There has been an age of Cromwell. There was an age of Julius Caesar.
[00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:38.960]   These are facts, historical personages. Jesus of Nazareth is an historical personage. This
[00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:45.600]   is the whole argument of the Apostle. This is not a theory. This is not some experience
[00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:51.440]   which I am trying to explain. I start with certain events that have taken place, solidly
[00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:57.240]   belonging to history. There they are. And Peter's argument is, this is why this has
[00:27:57.240 --> 00:28:01.320]   happened to us, because of him, who he is, what's happened to him proves who he is,
[00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:07.360]   and he's proved it still further by sending this upon us. Now then, that is how he starts
[00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:13.640]   his sermon. But you notice he puts it in a very interesting way. He puts it in terms
[00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:21.400]   of this next element that I want to emphasize, which is what is called prophecy. This, he
[00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:30.440]   says, is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel. And then he proceeds to quote the prophecy
[00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:39.080]   of this man, Joel, who had lived many centuries before. And in a sense, this is again one
[00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:44.720]   of the main arguments that he develops in this entire sermon. And I want to show you
[00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:49.960]   the importance of this argument from prophecy tonight. Now, it's very interesting to notice
[00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:56.040]   how these preachers repeat themselves. The apostle Peter was very fond of this point.
[00:28:56.040 --> 00:29:00.800]   Later on, much later on, when he came to write a letter, he puts it like this in his first
[00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:06.400]   epistle. He's talking about this great salvation. He says, "Of which salvation the prophets
[00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:11.600]   have inquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come unto
[00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:15.920]   you, searching what or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did
[00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:23.000]   signify when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ and the glory that should follow,
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:29.680]   unto whom it was revealed that not unto themselves but unto us they did minister the things which
[00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:34.280]   are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy
[00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:41.200]   Ghost sent down from heaven, which things also the angels desire to look into." But
[00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:46.680]   then listen to him in his last epistle, the second epistle, when he tells them that he
[00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:53.240]   is an old man. He says, "I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these
[00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:58.320]   things, though you know them and be established in this present truth. Yea, I think it meet
[00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:04.200]   as long as I am in this tabernacle to stir you up by putting you into remembrance, knowing
[00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:10.240]   that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle, even as the Lord Jesus Christ hath shown me.
[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:14.960]   His body is but a tent or a tabernacle to him." He says, "I am going to put it off.
[00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:22.000]   I am going on to the realm of the spiritual." What is he reminding them of? He says, "Listen,
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   we have not followed cunningly devised fables when we made known unto you the power and
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:33.240]   coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty. For he received
[00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:38.080]   from God the Father honour and glory when there came such a voice to him from the excellent
[00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:44.400]   glory, 'This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.' And this voice which
[00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:53.120]   came from him we heard when we were with him in the holy mount." We have also a more
[00:30:53.120 --> 00:31:00.120]   sure word of prophecy, "Whereunto he do well that he take heed, as unto a light that
[00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:06.600]   shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn and the day star arise in your hearts."
[00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:11.440]   Now, what does all that mean? Well, you see, what the old man is saying is this. "Look
[00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:16.080]   here," he says, "I am going to die. I am not going to be with you much longer. And
[00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:19.560]   I want you to hold on to these things that you have heard, because you are living in
[00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:23.960]   a difficult world, and you are confronted by the world, the flesh, and the devil, and
[00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:29.080]   you have got to die yourselves. And I am thinking of you having an abundant entry into the everlasting
[00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:35.600]   kingdom of God when you come to die. The only way is to hold on to the truth you have heard."
[00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:39.720]   But somebody may say, "Why should we believe it? On what grounds do we believe it?"
[00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:48.800]   Well, since Peter, you know, I am by way of being a witness. I remember a day, he says,
[00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:56.240]   when this Jesus of Nazareth turned to Peter, turned to James, and John, and to me, and
[00:31:56.240 --> 00:32:02.360]   he said, "Come along. I want you to come with me up onto the top of a certain mountain."
[00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:06.880]   So they went up, leaving the other disciples at the foot of the mountain. And you know
[00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:11.520]   that Peter, I will never forget it. There the three of us were with him on top of this
[00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:18.040]   mountain. And suddenly the place was overshadowed by a bright shining cloud. And as we looked
[00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:22.800]   at him, he was entirely transfigured. He began to shine with an amazing luminosity. Even
[00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:26.960]   his clothing was shining. And the radiance of heaven came into him. And two men appeared
[00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:35.800]   speaking unto him, Moses and Elias. And we heard a voice speaking from heaven, saying,
[00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:41.920]   "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Hear him."
[00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:48.600]   "Listen," says Peter, "I am an old man. I am on the verge of the grave. I am testifying
[00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:54.760]   to you. I was there. I heard it. I am a witness to it." So my two brethren, James and John,
[00:32:54.760 --> 00:33:04.760]   we heard that voice on the holy mount. We heard God speaking about this Jesus.
[00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:10.480]   You have not followed cunningly devised fables. We have not been telling you fairy tales and
[00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:16.880]   stories. We have had to suffer for this. And I know that I am going to suffer, says Peter.
[00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:21.800]   He told me, he prophesied, that I was going to die a most extraordinary form of death.
[00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:26.320]   Jesus had predicted that when Peter came to die, he would be crucified upside down. And
[00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:31.400]   according to tradition, he was. Here is an old man, knowing that that is coming, he says,
[00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:37.880]   "Listen, I tell you in the presence of God. I heard the voice. I was there. So were my
[00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:45.560]   two brothers with me." But you notice that he does not stop at that.
[00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:52.420]   The facts are important. The facts are there. He says, "But we have also a word of prophecy
[00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:59.680]   made more sure. If you do not believe my testimony," says Peter, "if you do not believe my evidence,
[00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:08.460]   my witness, listen, I have got another bit of evidence, prophecy, verified prophecy."
[00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:12.480]   You see, at the end of his life, he is preaching the same sermon, in a sense, as he preached
[00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:17.800]   on the day of Pentecost, his very first sermon. Here he is, here, he reminds these people
[00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:21.520]   of Jesus, "You are witnesses, you have seen them, and I have seen them." But listen,
[00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:27.820]   he says, "This is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel." Prophecy again. This
[00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:33.560]   word of prophecy, verified and made more sure. Now then, this is the thing that I want to
[00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:38.160]   hold before you, my friends. You see, you cannot explain things like this in terms of
[00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:44.960]   psychology. We are dealing with evidence, we are dealing with facts. What are they?
[00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:51.320]   Well, we are dealing, as Peter quotes here, with two prophecies in particular, the prophecy
[00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:58.240]   of the prophet Joel and David, who, because he was a man of God and illumined by the Spirit
[00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:07.300]   at times, also prophesied and put his prophecy in the form of Psalms. And this is the argument
[00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:17.500]   of the apostle. Prophecy is a fact. Now, what I mean is this. Here is the record, here are
[00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:26.920]   the prophecies. These things were written centuries before the birth of Jesus Christ.
[00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:31.640]   Now, it doesn't matter what your temperament is, whether you are a volatile person or a
[00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:35.720]   quiet one, whether you are an optimist or a pessimist, it doesn't make the slightest
[00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:41.680]   difference. Here is a solid fact of history that many centuries before—eight centuries,
[00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:51.280]   some of them, seven others, others six—men wrote down, and the documents were available
[00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:58.360]   and were preserved, they wrote in these documents certain prophecies about a person who was
[00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:05.680]   going to come. They give the most extraordinary details concerning him. They tell you where
[00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:11.080]   he is going to be born, namely in Bethlehem. They tell you something about his poverty.
[00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:14.720]   They tell you about the character of his life. There are many things they tell you. They
[00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:20.360]   tell you that he is going to ride into Jerusalem to die on the fall of an ass. Even that is
[00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:25.520]   there. They tell you that he is going to be sold for thirty pieces of silver. They tell
[00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:29.480]   you that he is going to be led as a lamb to the slaughter and crucified, that he is going
[00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:36.800]   to die. Yes, but that he is rise again, and that he will ascend and send down the Holy
[00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:40.880]   Spirit. All that was prophesied.
[00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:51.200]   Now, you see, this is the basis of the Christian faith. I am not here simply to preach experiences
[00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:55.440]   to you. Thank God I have had experiences, but I do not stand here and tell you what
[00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:59.760]   has happened to me. I do not talk about myself. With the Apostle Paul I say, "We preach
[00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:07.840]   not ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord." And that is why I never believe in just putting
[00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:11.960]   up people to give their testimonies and say, "Now come to Jesus and you will get the
[00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:18.520]   same thing." No, no, I know the answer to that. I am here to hold these facts before
[00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:24.120]   you, the facts recorded in the Gospels, and behind them, prophecy, the fact of prophecy.
[00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:34.160]   Now, here is the question. How do you explain prophecy? How comes it to pass that these
[00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:40.440]   men, so many centuries before the event, were able to tell us about them and to tell us
[00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:44.280]   exactly how they were going to happen? There is only one answer. It is the answer given
[00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:48.520]   by Peter in that last letter of his, when he tells people, "If you do not listen to
[00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:55.560]   me, listen to the word of prophecy." Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the Scripture
[00:37:55.560 --> 00:38:02.480]   is of any private interpretation, by which he means this, that no man ever wrote a prophecy
[00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:08.000]   simply conjured or excogitated out of his own mind or imagination. The prophet was not
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:14.080]   just a man who sat down and thought philosophically about life and tried with his insight to understand
[00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:18.920]   and then had a brilliant idea. He could not. You cannot foretell facts. You can give your
[00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:22.880]   theories, you can make a forecast, but it is generally wrong rather than right. But
[00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:27.080]   these men were right and right in details. What is the explanation? That no prophecy
[00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:32.560]   of the Scripture is of any private interpretation, for the prophecy came not in old time by the
[00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:46.480]   will of men, but holy men of God speak, as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. It is the
[00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:52.160]   only explanation. If it were just one odd fact, you could say coincidence, but it isn't.
[00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:58.560]   There are dozens. There are details. It is extraordinary. It is amazing. And here is
[00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:03.680]   the exact fulfillment. How do you explain it? There is only one explanation. It is this
[00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:08.880]   God who is behind everything, revealing it, making it known. And the prophets say that
[00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:12.600]   read their works for yourselves. They don't say I have suddenly had a brilliant idea.
[00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:17.480]   They say the word of the Lord came unto me, the burden of the Lord, the Lord spake unto
[00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:23.160]   me, and they were given what to say. They act, they say, almost mechanically. It was
[00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:29.720]   given to them, revealed to them. They didn't think it out. Now, my dear friend, this is
[00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:37.160]   the basis of this message. And it is something, I suggest to you, that is unanswerable. What
[00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:41.440]   does it mean? Well, let me summarize what it means to you, what is the great message
[00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:58.880]   of all this. First and foremost, it reminds us of the living God. He is not an abstraction.
[00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:06.280]   He is not a philosophic ex about which you argue and debate and sit down with your pipes
[00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:14.120]   and give your opinions. No, no. He is a living God who can give revelations, give knowledge,
[00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:27.440]   impart information. But then the apostle makes this very striking point. In those revelations
[00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:32.520]   which he gave to the prophets, he was revealing that he has got a great plan and purpose with
[00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:39.740]   respect to this world. And that is the message of Christianity, and that is why I am really
[00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:47.020]   in this pulpit tonight, because there is no other hope. Princes and lords may flourish
[00:40:47.020 --> 00:40:55.400]   and may fade, they do. The great statesman dies, the great leader goes. There is an enemy
[00:40:55.400 --> 00:41:05.280]   that conquers all. It is death. And they leave us in a world of problems and of tragedies
[00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:12.960]   and of pain. What can we do? This is an historic occasion, this is a great day that will go
[00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:22.560]   down in history. January the 24th, 1965, the death of Sir Winston Churchill. History, all
[00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:27.200]   right, let us think about history. Let us go back, let us look at history. What does
[00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:33.320]   he tell us? Well, what he tells us is this, that great men arise, they give an impetus
[00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:39.320]   to the human race, they solve certain problems, but they die and the problems remain and the
[00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:51.040]   world goes round in circles. That great man said that he did not believe he had been called
[00:41:51.040 --> 00:42:00.480]   to preside at the liquidation of the British Empire, but he really saw it, didn't he?
[00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:07.400]   And that is the whole message of history. Men come, they strive, they cut a great figure
[00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:13.120]   on the stage of history. Out they go and the world goes on and the problems remain. What
[00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:18.360]   is there? Is there any hope? Who can we look for? The greatest come, they go, they leave
[00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:29.000]   the problem. I am not detracting from them in saying that. All honour to great men in
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:38.040]   a natural sense, but it has got nothing to do with Christianity. The message of Christianity
[00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:44.960]   is that God has got a plan and a purpose. Did you notice this word in verse 23, Peter
[00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:51.400]   referring to the death of our Lord, he says, "Him being delivered by the determinate
[00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:58.280]   counsel and foreknowledge of God, you have taken and by wicked hens have crucified and
[00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:04.640]   slain." Did you notice it? Determinate, pre-determinate counsel and foreknowledge
[00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:15.360]   of God. That's what this message is about. It is to tell you that the death of Christ
[00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:21.560]   and the cross was not an accident, that it wasn't even something ultimately that was
[00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:27.240]   achieved by men. It was a plan, a part of the plan and the purpose of God, the pre-determinate
[00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:33.880]   counsel and foreknowledge of God. Listen to this, whether you are an optimist or a pessimist,
[00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:38.560]   whether you are mercurial or phlegmatic, and all your scientific and psychological knowledge,
[00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:45.080]   listen to this, the great eternal God who revealed the plan, 800 years, is carrying
[00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:52.000]   it out. And he sent his son into this world even to the death of the cross. It's part
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:44:01.080]   of a plan, a purpose. And what is the object and the purpose of this plan? Well, it is
[00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:09.720]   to save. The end, you remember, of the quotation from Joel is this, "And it shall come to
[00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:18.920]   pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved." Saved from what?
[00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:25.520]   Saved from the punishment we all so richly deserve from God whom we have rebelled against
[00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:31.720]   and whom we have offended. Saved from eternal misery. Saved from a continuation in the life
[00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:37.920]   beyond the veil of the misery and the unhappiness of this, even in a worse form. Saved to a
[00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:44.160]   positive knowledge of God. Saved to a new life, a fuller life, an expanding life, a
[00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:52.720]   life that leads to glory everlasting. That's God's plan. And that is what he revealed
[00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:59.960]   through the prophets. He sent them to the children of Israel all those centuries before
[00:44:59.960 --> 00:45:05.760]   the events. In their misery and shame he said, "It's all right, listen. Comfort ye, comfort
[00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:10.920]   ye my people, saith your God. I'm going to, I'm going to send him. All eyes shall see
[00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:17.120]   the salvation of God. Here it is, God's plan, purposed before the very dawn of history,
[00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:22.960]   before the very creation of the world, the everlasting God." And he reveals it, showing
[00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:30.960]   that he's there, showing that he's interested, showing his mighty activity. His purpose,
[00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:38.680]   his plan, are a purpose and a plan of salvation and of deliverance. How is he going to do
[00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:44.680]   it? Well, he's going to do it by sending this person into the world. The prophets have
[00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:50.400]   written, the prophets have foretold, the babe is to be born of a virgin in Bethlehem and
[00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:56.000]   so on. This one, he's coming, the deliverer, the Messiah. Here's the one, wait for him.
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:04.040]   That's the whole message of the prophets. God is going to send a deliverer. How will
[00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:12.080]   he deliver us? Will he deliver us by just living a perfect life before us and saying
[00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:19.360]   to us, "Follow me, imitate that"? Thank God, that isn't the message. Who can imitate
[00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:24.480]   Christ? It's easy for the philosophers to talk and write about it, but have you ever
[00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:33.520]   tried to do it? Imitation of Christ, it means damnation. No, no, he didn't come merely
[00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:38.560]   to give us an example, he didn't come merely to teach us. He didn't come and tell us,
[00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:43.800]   "Do this and you'll save yourselves." For, my dear friends, he knew we couldn't
[00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:53.240]   do it. The Son of Man is come to seek and to save that which is lost. It was because
[00:46:53.240 --> 00:46:59.600]   the whole world lieth guilty before God that he came. It was because men couldn't save
[00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:05.000]   himself. Read your Old Testament. You see them trying to. God gives them a law. He says,
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:09.360]   "Keep that, you'll save yourselves." They can't. None can keep it. By the law is the
[00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:20.360]   knowledge of sin. "By the knowledge of the law shall no man be saved in his sight, all
[00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:26.080]   have sinned and come short of the glory of God." No, no, he didn't come to give us
[00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:30.200]   an example, he didn't come to teach us and to tell us how to save himself. What? Well,
[00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:39.520]   here it is, him being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God. God sent
[00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:45.720]   his Son into this world to bear the guilt of our sins himself and to punish them in
[00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:56.920]   him. It was God who contrived the cross. It was the cruel hands of men that actually knocked
[00:47:56.920 --> 00:48:04.120]   in the nails. But it was the predeterminate counsel and foreknowledge of God. It is God's
[00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:09.800]   way of saving in his Son and by his death. And to prove it, he raises him again. He's
[00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:16.080]   big enough and strong enough to bear all our sins. "Whom God hath raised up, having loosed
[00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:22.680]   the pains of death, because it was not possible that he should be holden of it." Why? Because
[00:48:22.680 --> 00:48:28.240]   he's Son of God, because he's God the Son in the flesh, and he cannot die. He's divine,
[00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:37.440]   he's eternal, he rises, he bursts us under the bands of death.
[00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:45.880]   And so you see the Apostles teaching them. And this is the Christian message, that this
[00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:54.000]   is the only way of salvation, that men and women, we all need to be delivered from the
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:59.240]   guilt and the bondage and the power and the captivity of sin, and that it is Christ alone
[00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:04.000]   who can do it, and that he's come to do it. God sent him to do it, and this is the only
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:16.840]   way. This is God's plan, determined and purposed before the very foundation and creation of
[00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:22.720]   the world. But listen, here is the thing I'd like to leave in your minds as a final thought
[00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:34.480]   this evening. God has not only got a plan, it is a certain plan, and it is a sure plan,
[00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:43.280]   and nothing can stop it. Here it is, him being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge
[00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:55.580]   of God, you have taken and by wicked hands have crucified and slain, whom God hath raised
[00:49:55.580 --> 00:50:03.280]   up having loosed the pains of death. You remember the story? The Pharisees and Sadducees and
[00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:10.800]   Stribes and Herodians and Doctors of the Law and the Roman authorities, all against him,
[00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:15.400]   all delivering him up to death. He was a danger, he was a nuisance. They regarded him as a
[00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:20.640]   political agitator. Away with him! And the people were carried away by them. Oh, the
[00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:29.920]   silly people. Do you still have confidence in their verdicts? Well, they told you the
[00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:35.000]   sort of people they are in 1945, and they've done it again this week with the different
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:44.240]   men. Away with him, crucify him, the unintelligent mob, the mass, the crowd that says today there's
[00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:49.400]   nothing in religion, Christianity is played out, it's all a matter of psychology. Oh,
[00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:56.760]   the unintelligent mob, the unintelligent mass. They crucified him with wicked hands. They
[00:50:56.760 --> 00:51:06.880]   thought it was the end. But what they didn't know was this, that even as they were hammering
[00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:13.080]   in the nails, they were carrying out God's will. The God I preach to you can use his
[00:51:13.080 --> 00:51:18.040]   enemies, and he often has done so. They don't know what's happening. He does. He uses his
[00:51:18.040 --> 00:51:26.440]   enemies to carry out his own plan. Not only that, the malignity of men cannot stop his
[00:51:26.440 --> 00:51:33.760]   plan, nor frustrate it. They thought that when they'd crucified him and killed him
[00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:38.680]   and saw his body buried in a grave, that that was the end of him, but it wasn't. Hell had
[00:51:38.680 --> 00:51:46.840]   let itself loose. Man and devil had done their utmost. God smashes it all. Him, God, raised
[00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:52.040]   him from the dead. Here's the answer. He's over all. He'll triumph over all, even over
[00:51:52.040 --> 00:51:57.680]   all his enemies, even the devil and hell and everything that is against him. All are to
[00:51:57.680 --> 00:52:04.680]   be defeated. He has announced it in the resurrection.
[00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:12.840]   That's what the apostle says here. "Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly
[00:52:12.840 --> 00:52:24.200]   that God hath made that same Jesus whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ." My
[00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:32.920]   dear friends, this is the solemn thought, that we are face to face with God. You say,
[00:52:32.920 --> 00:52:37.520]   "I'm all right. I'm happy. I've got all I want. I'm having a wonderful life." All right,
[00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:45.600]   my friend, but this is my question to you. How do you explain these facts concerning
[00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:54.320]   Jesus of Nazareth? Why did it happen? Why did it have to happen? Why did God send him?
[00:52:54.320 --> 00:52:59.640]   Why God's plan? Why this message that was revealed to the prophets so long before the
[00:52:59.640 --> 00:53:05.760]   time when it actually took place? What is this? What's your psychology got to do with
[00:53:05.760 --> 00:53:09.840]   it? What's your temperament? What's anything, any of your experiences? It doesn't matter.
[00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:19.840]   You're a living soul and this has happened in your world. And it has happened with respect
[00:53:19.840 --> 00:53:27.160]   to you as it has happened with respect to everybody else. We are all different, you
[00:53:27.160 --> 00:53:35.440]   say. I agree, and yet we're all the same. We're all sinners. Your most respectable
[00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:42.440]   citizen in this country tonight is as much a sinner as the vilest blaggard in London.
[00:53:42.440 --> 00:53:47.960]   Not in the same way, but in the sight of God, he is. There is no difference. All have sinned
[00:53:47.960 --> 00:53:56.800]   and come short of the glory of God. There is none righteous, no, not one. So you don't
[00:53:56.800 --> 00:54:06.760]   evade the issue by talking about psychology and temperament, and by dismissing experiences.
[00:54:06.760 --> 00:54:14.600]   What is confronting you and every one of us is the fact of this Jesus of Nazareth. Yes,
[00:54:14.600 --> 00:54:28.400]   it's Sunday, January the 24th, 1965. Why? Not because Sir Winston Churchill died, but
[00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:38.440]   because Jesus of Nazareth was born and lived and taught and died and rose again and sent
[00:54:38.440 --> 00:54:44.560]   down the Spirit. My friend, that's the thing for you to face. It doesn't matter who you
[00:54:44.560 --> 00:54:48.480]   are, it doesn't matter whether you're able or whether you're lacking in talent, whether
[00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:52.680]   you're learned or ignorant, knowledgeable or know nothing at all. It doesn't matter.
[00:54:52.680 --> 00:54:56.040]   It doesn't matter what you've been, it doesn't matter what your constitution, nothing
[00:54:56.040 --> 00:55:03.200]   matters except this, you're a human being. And God sent his only begotten Son into a
[00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:13.960]   world of human beings. So the problem confronting you is this, not what you need, but who is
[00:55:13.960 --> 00:55:23.520]   this? And why did he ever come? Why did the prophets write about him, especially why did
[00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:31.120]   God ever send him to die? Has this got anything to do with me? That's your question. That's
[00:55:31.120 --> 00:55:36.760]   the way to face history. That's the way to face the history even of a great man. You
[00:55:36.760 --> 00:55:41.720]   don't just say, "Well, wonderful, this and that." You say, "Now, what's all this
[00:55:41.720 --> 00:55:46.120]   got to do with me?" You relate yourself to history. It's right, it's good, we should
[00:55:46.120 --> 00:55:58.240]   all be trying to do it, but here is the supreme fact of history. Why Jesus Christ? Why Bethlehem?
[00:55:58.240 --> 00:56:06.560]   Why Golgotha? Why Calvary? Why grave? Why resurrection? Why descent of the Holy Ghost?
[00:56:06.560 --> 00:56:15.960]   Why the Church? Why all these things? Have you ever asked that question? It is because
[00:56:15.960 --> 00:56:27.520]   men and women never face the fact of Christ and the fact of prophecy, that they continue
[00:56:27.520 --> 00:56:33.880]   in the darkness and the misery of sin, not knowing where they are going, not understanding
[00:56:33.880 --> 00:56:40.360]   life, not ready to die, afraid of the eternal future. My friend, consider him, believe the
[00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:49.680]   message concerning him. And you will understand yourself for the first time. You will understand
[00:56:49.680 --> 00:56:56.840]   history. You will understand life. You will have a vision and an ability to see through
[00:56:56.840 --> 00:57:04.560]   death. And you will have a glimpse of the glory everlasting. I say to you in the name
[00:57:04.560 --> 00:57:11.160]   of God, this is God's plan, nothing can stop it. The devil brought out his last reserves
[00:57:11.160 --> 00:57:20.640]   on Calvary and he was utterly defeated by the resurrection. And his time is limited,
[00:57:20.640 --> 00:57:31.960]   and your time is limited. And God's plan is inexorable, unavoidable. And whether you
[00:57:31.960 --> 00:57:40.880]   face this fact of Jesus of Nazareth in this life or not, you will have to face him. Great
[00:57:40.880 --> 00:57:52.200]   and small, mighty and insignificant, all will have to stand before him, for he is the King
[00:57:52.200 --> 00:58:13.920]   of kings and Lord of lords. This day reminds us of birth, life, death, beyond. And that's
[00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:21.480]   the truth about you. As people have said today, Sir Winston Churchill is gone. They'll say
[00:58:21.480 --> 00:58:33.640]   it about you. They'll say it about me. Make use of this day, make use of history, to ask
[00:58:33.640 --> 00:58:43.360]   yourself this fundamental question. Who is this Jesus? Why did he come? Why did he live?
[00:58:43.360 --> 00:58:53.040]   Why did he die? Why did he rise again? What's it to do with me? And if you do that seriously,
[00:58:53.040 --> 00:58:59.240]   you'll come to see that it has everything to do with you. For he came to seek and to
[00:58:59.240 --> 00:59:10.880]   save that which is lost. He came to give his life a ransom for many by his stripes. We
[00:59:10.880 --> 00:59:22.720]   who believe in him are healed. Oh, my dear friends, look at the facts, and especially
[00:59:22.720 --> 00:59:34.360]   this great fact of prophecy of which the facts are a verification.
[00:59:34.360 --> 00:59:38.440]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones. All of
