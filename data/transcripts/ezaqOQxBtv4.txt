[00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.400]   Steve writes in to ask this, "Pastor John, can our emphasis on gospel-centered
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.440]   sanctification, rooted in our justification, lead to antinomianism?"
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:24.720]   In the sinfulness and finiteness and fallibility and cultural limitations of the human heart,
[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.200]   any way of thinking can lead to any other way of thinking.
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.920]   [Laughter]
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:41.920]   In my sin, in our sin, we are not rational. Sin is not rational. It's insane. It's irrational.
[00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:49.360]   It's suicidal. So if it looks like there's no possible path from God-centeredness and
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:58.000]   justification to a lawless life, that's a mirage. There is a path from anywhere to anywhere in the
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:06.560]   mind of the flesh. In the darkness of sin, two plus two is five. And gospel plus justification
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:16.720]   is antinomianism. But that's not probably what Steve is asking. He probably knows this. He wants
[00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:23.680]   to know, well, how might it lead there? I mean, how might it lead there? So let me just think
[00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:29.200]   out loud for a minute. Let's start with a robust affirmation for gospel-centered life. Yes,
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.640]   absolutely. What else would you want your life to be centered on but the gospel? And let's start
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:41.360]   with a robust affirmation of justification-rooted sanctification. Where else would you want to root
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:47.440]   your justification than in the fact that God has declared you righteous before him already?
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:54.080]   There certainly is no sanctification for the unjustified. So yes, yes, yes. Gospel-centered
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:02.960]   life, justification-rooted life. But the question is, how does the gospel work at the center? How
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:10.080]   does calling it central give it effectiveness in our lives? There's the question. Until we explain
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:17.120]   how the gospel centrality brings about justification or brings about sanctification,
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:27.840]   we're just sloganeering, probably. And how does justification work as the root of sanctification?
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:35.040]   How does the declaration of righteousness bring about the fruit of righteousness? Paul says,
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:42.720]   Paul prays in Philippians 1, "Believers should be filled, that believers would be filled with
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.800]   the fruit of righteousness." How does justification help that happen? That's where we can go off the
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:55.920]   rails. And what I have found is that when we start talking about this, the devil is in the
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:01.920]   definitions or the absence of the definitions. There's a common saying, "The devil is in the
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:08.720]   details." Well, right. Broad-sweeping generalizations are hard to disagree with
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:16.160]   because they don't say anything clear and specific. The devil is in the detailed definitions,
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.640]   and the truth is in the detailed definitions, and we can't recognize the one from the other
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:27.280]   until we get to those detailed definitions. So on this issue of justification and sanctification,
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:35.280]   the term antinomianism is often, it's not defined enough for me to know what to say. I'm not sure
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:43.200]   what people are referring to when they talk about it. It contains the word law, nomian, and anti,
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:50.640]   which means against or in the place of, so it can mean a person is against the law as a way of
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:59.760]   salvation. But what's in mind with the word law here? All imperatives, Mosaic law, whole Old
[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:06.960]   Testament, ceremonial law, ethnic Jewish markers, and what is meant by the word way, in way of
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:14.560]   salvation. Do they mean law-keeping as a way of earning salvation, or do they mean way in the
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:21.200]   sense of path, so that they are saying we don't even walk in the path of love, which is a fulfillment
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:28.560]   of all the law? So I just want to scream sometimes, say, "Oh, for definitions, please, definitions."
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:34.800]   Does antinomian mean anti-godliness, anti-holiness of life, anti-fruit of the Holy Spirit,
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:42.800]   anti-obedience of faith? It would be a lot clearer if people said what they precisely
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:48.800]   mean if they're going to accuse somebody of being antinomian or if they're going to distance
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:56.720]   themselves from antinomianism. I'm just constantly crying out for definitions and for the freedom
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:08.560]   from ambiguities in the absence of these kinds of failed or absent definitions. So here's what I
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:15.040]   would ask a person who exalts in God-centeredness and justification in relation to sanctification.
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:24.560]   Does your view mean the obedience of faith or the work of faith, as it's called in 2 Thessalonians
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:30.400]   111, or the fruit of the Spirit or the fruit of righteousness, as it's called in Philippians 111,
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:38.240]   or practical holiness and purity of life? Does your view mean any of these are unimportant
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:44.320]   or unessential in the Christian life? And then I would say, "How important or how essential are
[00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:51.600]   they?" And then I would say, "How does the gospel at the center and justification at the root bring
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:58.880]   these about?" And the answer to those questions will reveal whether gospel-centeredness and
[00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:05.120]   justification-rootedness have begun to undermine a life of holiness or not.
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:11.120]   Thank you, Pastor John. So you left us hanging on how exactly gospel-centeredness and
[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:16.000]   justification work. And so we'll go there tomorrow. Thanks for listening to this episode of the Ask
