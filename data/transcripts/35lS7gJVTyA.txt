[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.520]   [silence]
[00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.160]   If we are going to feel motivated at all,
[00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.560]   that is if we are going to wake up in the morning
[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.320]   or have any period of time during our day
[00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.140]   in which we feel like we are capable of pursuing goals,
[00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.760]   we are going to have to have a healthy level
[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.600]   of baseline dopamine.
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.100]   In other words, we are going to have to have enough dopamine
[00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.360]   in the wave pool, enough water in the wave pool, that is,
[00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.380]   before we can generate any waves or peaks in dopamine,
[00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.400]   let alone troughs and the rest.
[00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.820]   So how do we achieve a healthy baseline level of dopamine?
[00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.740]   Well, there we can really look
[00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:36.520]   to some foundational practices,
[00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.280]   practices that perhaps you've heard about
[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.700]   on this podcast before,
[00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.900]   and that to some of you might seem a little mundane,
[00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.960]   although some of them are a bit more sophisticated,
[00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.520]   maybe even esoteric.
[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.140]   The good news is that we can all control these things,
[00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.560]   and they don't require purchasing anything,
[00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.180]   but they do require some degree
[00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.320]   of regular upkeep and effort.
[00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.900]   Those things include what I call the very basics.
[00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.460]   Now, the very basics put in the context
[00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:02.900]   of today's discussion are the things
[00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.620]   that put water in the wave pool.
[00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.260]   Those are going to be getting sufficient amounts
[00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:09.780]   of quality sleep each night,
[00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.700]   something that we've done several episodes on
[00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.380]   and have online toolkits for,
[00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.040]   so you can see the Master Your Sleep episode,
[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.340]   the Perfect Your Sleep episode,
[00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:17.900]   the Light and Health episode.
[00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.900]   If you want to skip all that and just get right to the tools,
[00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.220]   we have a sleep toolkit,
[00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:23.660]   or it's actually called the Toolkit for Sleep
[00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.480]   that you can access at hubermanlab.com,
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:26.980]   completely zero cost.
[00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.120]   You just go there and download that toolkit.
[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.380]   Getting sufficient sleep each night
[00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.740]   literally restores your dopamine reserves.
[00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.540]   It allows dopamine to be present
[00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.140]   and for you to have a level of baseline dopamine
[00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.540]   that will allow you to even consider your goals
[00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.520]   in any kind of meaningful or reasonable way.
[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.900]   Second, there are practices
[00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.940]   that are supported by the scientific literature
[00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.580]   to increase your baseline level of dopamine
[00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.260]   that are independent of sleep,
[00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:54.460]   but are similar to sleep,
[00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.380]   and I like to refer to these as non-sleep deep rest.
[00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.300]   This is not meditation.
[00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.280]   There's actually very little evidence
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.500]   that meditation of the traditional kind
[00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.420]   of sitting eyes closed, third eye,
[00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.240]   focusing on your third eye center,
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.020]   which is this area behind your forehead,
[00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.560]   there is very little evidence
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.860]   that that increases levels of dopamine.
[00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.120]   There is a place for meditation
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.880]   in the context of today's discussion,
[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.700]   but I'll repeat, meditation itself is a focusing exercise.
[00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.580]   It is not known to increase dopamine.
[00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.300]   However, non-sleep deep rest,
[00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.480]   so-called NSDR, very similar,
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.000]   although different to what's sometimes called yoga nidra,
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.260]   which is where you lie there,
[00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.060]   you do a sort of body scan, some long exhale breathing.
[00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.980]   NSDR is very similar.
[00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.740]   You can find a link to a zero cost NSDR on YouTube.
[00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:40.760]   It's a 10 minute long one.
[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.260]   There are also 20 and 30 minute ones out there
[00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.100]   also on YouTube,
[00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.800]   but I'll provide a link to the 10 minute one.
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.140]   Those have been shown to increase the amount of dopamine
[00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.160]   in your dopamine reserves by up to 65%,
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.560]   which is a remarkable number.
[00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.980]   So quality sleep, non-sleep deep rest,
[00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.900]   AKA yoga nidra, very powerful ways
[00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.220]   to keep your baseline level of dopamine
[00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.780]   at a sufficient level.
[00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.260]   In addition to that,
[00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.300]   nutrition no doubt plays a role
[00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:09.760]   in your baseline level of dopamine
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.000]   because tyrosine, the amino acid,
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.660]   is the rate limiting enzyme for the synthesis of dopamine.
[00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.300]   Tyrosine is present in varying levels in different foods.
[00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:20.580]   You can look those up online.
[00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.460]   You just simply put in a search
[00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:25.240]   for tyrosine levels in different foods,
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.260]   everything from particular cheeses,
[00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.400]   like Parmesan cheese has high levels of tyrosine,
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.820]   certain meats, certain nuts, certain vegetables.
[00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.380]   Without getting into details and specifics,
[00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.260]   you can find those there,
[00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.780]   but you need proper nutrition
[00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.460]   and therefore nutrients, in particular tyrosine,
[00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:44.520]   in order to have sufficient levels of baseline dopamine.
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:45.520]   The third thing on the list,
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:46.860]   and again, these are things that we come back to
[00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:47.840]   almost every episode,
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.340]   but I don't think they can be repeated enough
[00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:50.420]   because these are really things
[00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.220]   that we need to focus on every 24 hours.
[00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.740]   You might be able to skip a day here or there
[00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:56.580]   if you get sick or you're traveling
[00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:57.920]   or you have some major life event,
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.960]   but really every 24 hours we need to re-up our sleep.
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.580]   We need to re-up our nutrients.
[00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:05.420]   Even if you're fasting,
[00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:06.460]   you're re-upping your nutrients
[00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:09.180]   from stored sources within your body.
[00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.940]   The third thing is sunlight,
[00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:12.220]   morning sunlight in particular.
[00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.780]   I've done extensive episodes about this.
[00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:16.280]   Check out the episode on lighting your health
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:17.740]   if you want all the details,
[00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:19.620]   but you want to try and view sunlight
[00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.220]   as early in the day as possible.
[00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.860]   Five to 10 minutes on a clear day, minimum.
[00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.560]   10 to 20 minutes on a cloudy day, minimum.
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:32.020]   20 or 30 minutes on a very overcast day, minimum.
[00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.460]   Without sunglasses, don't stare at the sun.
[00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:35.780]   Please don't damage your eyes.
[00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.460]   Look off, slightly off from the sun,
[00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.500]   but yes, you want to face eastward towards the sun.
[00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.400]   And on those cloudy days, that's especially important to do.
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.240]   Why?
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.020]   Well, viewing morning sunlight
[00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.720]   increases cortisol early in the day, which is excellent
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.860]   because you want cortisol elevated early in the day
[00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.380]   and you want it lower later in the day.
[00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.260]   And because of the relationship
[00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.020]   between the cells in your eye that sense sunlight,
[00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.260]   specifically morning sunlight, believe it or not,
[00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.580]   that happens, and signal to your hypothalamus
[00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.660]   and the relationship between the hypothalamus
[00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.120]   and the pituitary and other endocrine organs,
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.980]   it sets in motion a dopamine-related cascade
[00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:13.940]   in neuromodulators, dopamine,
[00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.260]   and hormones that lead to states of well-being,
[00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.080]   elevated mood, alertness, et cetera, throughout the day.
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.280]   It also helps your sleep at night,
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.440]   but today we're talking about dopamine.
[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:23.520]   So yes, believe it or not,
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:24.880]   that morning sunlight exposure
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.920]   does increase your levels of dopamine, not just cortisol.
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.520]   And fourth on the list is going to be movement,
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.400]   exercise of varying kinds.
[00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.400]   It could be resistance training,
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:35.820]   it could be cardiovascular training.
[00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.440]   That does increase levels of dopamine.
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:42.000]   Here, we're not talking about achieving peaks in dopamine.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.120]   That could be accomplished
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:45.340]   through setting a personal record, a PR,
[00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.900]   or through sprints or heavy lifts,
[00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:49.940]   or learning some new dynamic movement.
[00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:51.500]   What we're really talking about here
[00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.000]   is getting into a regular exercise program
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.100]   of if not every day, at least five days a week,
[00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:59.960]   a mixture of cardiovascular and resistance exercise.
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.580]   That we also know is known to elevate
[00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:07.620]   and maintain an elevated level of baseline dopamine.
[00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:09.680]   So it's not just about the euphoria you feel
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.460]   during or after exercise,
[00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:14.900]   it's also about the baseline level of dopamine
[00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:17.220]   that's achieved through regular movement
[00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:18.460]   and engaging in movement.
[00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:19.980]   And if you're asking, how could that be?
[00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:21.820]   Well, you already know the answer.
[00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:25.020]   The circuits in the brain and body that generate movement,
[00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:27.780]   not just goal-seeking, but movement itself,
[00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:31.700]   as I mentioned earlier, that nigrostriatal pathway.
[00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:33.920]   And yes, that circuit is separate
[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:37.100]   from the VTA nucleus accumbens to cortical circuit,
[00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:38.260]   the mesocortical circuit
[00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.700]   that we've mainly been focusing on today, but they interact.
[00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:43.580]   And so by engaging in regular movement,
[00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:46.060]   you ensure that you're maintaining elevated levels
[00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:48.620]   of baseline dopamine, which is what you want
[00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:50.020]   if you're going to be able to engage
[00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:53.280]   in any kind of motivated pursuit behavior of any kind.
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:54.500]   So those are the fundamentals
[00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:59.500]   that will set the level of baseline dopamine in your system.
[00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.500]   A couple of key points.
[00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:05.420]   Yes, there is variation based on both genetics
[00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:07.740]   and circumstance in baseline levels of dopamine.
[00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:09.940]   If someone's going through a particular hard time,
[00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:11.780]   or if somebody inherited a gene
[00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:13.640]   in the dopamine synthesis pathway,
[00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:16.160]   that simply affords them higher levels of baseline dopamine.
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.660]   We likely know these people.
[00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:19.380]   They seem hyper-motivated all the time,
[00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:21.700]   not just based on prior success,
[00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:23.700]   but they just seem to have a lot of energy
[00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:25.020]   and a lot of go drive.
[00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:26.700]   You know, you talk about activation energy.
[00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:28.140]   Some of you may know what that term means.
[00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:29.340]   Others of you won't.
[00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:31.140]   Having low activation energy is great.
[00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:32.560]   I mean, the amount of energy that it takes
[00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:34.660]   to get into action to pursue adaptive
[00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:35.980]   and meaningful, healthy goals.
[00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:38.540]   Some people just seem to have lower activation energy
[00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:39.860]   and higher levels of dopamine
[00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:42.180]   are probably associated with that.
[00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:45.100]   Some of us have lower levels of baseline dopamine.
[00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:47.460]   Regardless, everyone needs to engage
[00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:49.840]   in the foundational things
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:51.720]   that I just mentioned a few moments ago,
[00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:54.300]   every 24 hours, or at least strive to.
[00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:55.700]   There is no escaping that.

[00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:01.460]   (upbeat music)
