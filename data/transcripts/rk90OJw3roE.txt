[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.760]   We come in our consideration of the fifth chapter of the epistle to the Romans this
[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.820]   evening to verses 16 and 17.
[00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:19.640]   Verses 16 and 17 in the fifth chapter of Paul's epistle to the Romans, "And not as it was
[00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:28.720]   by one that sinned, so is the gift; for the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:34.280]   free gift is of many offenses unto justification.
[00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:41.000]   For if by one man's offense death reigned by one, much more they which receive abundance
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:50.620]   of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ."
[00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:58.860]   We are continuing, in other words, our consideration of this striking contrast which the apostle
[00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:06.900]   here shows us between what has happened to us in Adam and what happens to us in the Lord
[00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.140]   Jesus Christ.
[00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:15.240]   Having dealt with the question of the exact meaning of the "many" and "all" and so on,
[00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.980]   we can now come back to this which is, after all, the apostle's main object in this section
[00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:26.860]   and the main purpose which he had in his mind in bringing out the contrast.
[00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:34.860]   At one and the same time, he is concerned to show that there are similarities and dissimilarities
[00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:41.580]   in our relationship to Adam and in our relationship to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:49.060]   And here he is working them out, having said at the end of verse 14 that Adam is the figure
[00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.940]   of him that was to come.
[00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:02.020]   In verse 15, we saw a fortnight ago, he states the big difference in a general manner.
[00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:07.940]   He put it like this, "But not as the offense, so also is the free gift," which means that
[00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:13.100]   the free gift is not exactly like the offense, indeed there is a striking contrast.
[00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:21.820]   And here it is, "If through the offense of one many be dead, much more the grace of God
[00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:29.220]   and the gift by grace which is by one man Jesus Christ hath abounded unto the many."
[00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:35.260]   Well now, there it was in general, but we come tonight to these two verses in which
[00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:42.380]   the Apostle is going to state in detail what he there stated in verse 15 in general.
[00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.340]   That again is a thing which he frequently does.
[00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.260]   He puts a thing as a whole, and then in order to help us, he divides it up into its component
[00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.340]   parts.
[00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.900]   And that is, I say, what he is doing in these two verses.
[00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:01.580]   Therefore, let us bear in mind as we come to consider the details, let us bear in mind
[00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.700]   the big thing.
[00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:11.220]   And the big thing is this, it is to show the glorious superiority of that which the Lord
[00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.820]   Jesus Christ has done for his people.
[00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.700]   We shall see what Adam did for his people, for all who belong to him, but the object
[00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:30.220]   is to show this much more of what the Lord Jesus Christ has done for those whom he represented,
[00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:36.180]   those who belong to him, those who are his people.
[00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:45.900]   Now verse 15 put it there in this way, you remember, that the offense of the one led
[00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:51.300]   to the fact that many died.
[00:03:51.300 --> 00:04:00.900]   He just puts it like that there in general, by the offense of one, many died.
[00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.700]   But now he is concerned to show us how they arrived at that, that is the end, death is
[00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:06.700]   the end.
[00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.860]   How did that ever happen to them?
[00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:14.540]   He does not give us the intermediate steps in verse 15, but he does in verses 16 and
[00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:15.540]   17.
[00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:21.280]   So let us follow him as he now proceeds to show us how that one offense led to the result
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.940]   that many died.
[00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.740]   Well look at verse 16 first.
[00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:38.100]   Once more you see he starts with this contrast, "Not as it was by one that sinned, so is."
[00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.260]   Not as, so is.
[00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.580]   In other words, he says you are not going to find on the positive side in the case of
[00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:50.500]   the Lord Jesus Christ what you found on the other side.
[00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:55.400]   It is still true to say that we were all in Adam, and it is true to say that all his people
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.860]   are in Christ.
[00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.780]   But he says, having said that, that is the big similarity, the thing that strikes us
[00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.520]   is this great and striking contrast.
[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.380]   Not as, so is.
[00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:11.660]   And he says the contrast comes out everywhere.
[00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:21.100]   So he is going to compare and to contrast Adam's disobedience with Christ's obedience,
[00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:29.220]   Adam's sin, Adam's offense, with this perfect work that the Lord Jesus Christ has done for
[00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:32.140]   us and on our behalf.
[00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:33.140]   Very well.
[00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:36.180]   What was it that Adam's sin led to?
[00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:43.140]   He tells us quite plainly, "Not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift."
[00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:44.980]   Well, what did the sin lead to?
[00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:52.660]   Well, here it is, "For the judgment was by one to condemnation."
[00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.820]   Now, there is the statement.
[00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:59.240]   Here we are getting the steps, you see.
[00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:04.380]   Adam offended, Adam sinned.
[00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:05.380]   What does sin lead to?
[00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:07.700]   Well, he says sin leads to judgment.
[00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.620]   And what is judgment?
[00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.260]   Well, judgment is the sentence.
[00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:16.780]   It's the decision or the sentence of a judge.
[00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:20.780]   The very term judgment conjures up the picture before us, doesn't it, of a law court and
[00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:22.980]   the judge sitting upon a bench.
[00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:27.300]   He's heard the case, the evidence has been produced, the prosecution has said what it's
[00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:29.460]   got to say.
[00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:34.620]   What defense there is, has been put forward, but having listened to it all, the judge pronounces
[00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:39.360]   his judgment, he delivers his sentence.
[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:43.480]   So sin led to a judgment.
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:49.260]   We remember, don't we, that God had warned Adam beforehand that if he did, this judgment
[00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:50.260]   would follow.
[00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:51.260]   Very well.
[00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:56.220]   Paul says, "Adam sinned and the judgment came in."
[00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:04.300]   But you notice that he says, "For the judgment was by one," to condemnation.
[00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:07.100]   One what?
[00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:10.060]   And there are those who would say that it means by one man.
[00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:15.420]   Well, of course, it does mean by one man, but I think that it means something much more
[00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:18.020]   particular than that.
[00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:25.500]   It seems to me that we must interpret this one as referring to one sin.
[00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:30.300]   And my reason for saying that is this, that the Apostle has already been saying that.
[00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:35.020]   He said it in verse 12 at the very beginning, "By one man sin entered into the world and
[00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:38.100]   death by sin, and so death passed upon all men."
[00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:40.540]   But there's a further reason here.
[00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:47.500]   It seems to me that we must say that this one refers to one sin because of the contrast
[00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:53.220]   which the Apostle is going to draw in the second half of the sentence, which is this.
[00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:58.740]   He says, "For the judgment was by one sin," to condemnation.
[00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:05.340]   But the free gift is of many offenses, many sins, unto justification.
[00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:10.860]   Now the only possible contrast with the many offenses is one offense.
[00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:16.300]   That is why I say it is so important that we should be bearing in mind that he is out
[00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:19.960]   to emphasize the contrast this much more.
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:28.780]   And here it is, therefore, the one sin of Adam led to that judgment, but as we shall
[00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:38.540]   see on the other side, the many offenses are covered by the one act of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:45.400]   Very well then, the judgment was by one, by the one sin.
[00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:46.400]   And what did it lead to?
[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:50.860]   Well, it was a judgment, he says, of condemnation.
[00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:57.380]   Here is his doctrine we've already been considering, but he's again so concerned
[00:08:57.380 --> 00:09:01.100]   that they should understand it that he repeats it.
[00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:11.020]   It means, in other words, that a sentence of condemnation was passed on all men on account
[00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:17.980]   of, and as the result of, that one sin of Adam.
[00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:23.580]   I don't stay with that because we have gone into it exhaustively, but do observe the way
[00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:26.620]   in which the apostle goes on repeating it.
[00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:30.140]   We are not left with just one statement in verse 12.
[00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:34.880]   As I pointed out at that time, he goes on repeating it practically in every single one
[00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:40.660]   of these verses, and yet people still stumble at it, and people dislike it and object to
[00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:42.220]   it, and reject it.
[00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:45.720]   But here it is, perfectly plain and clear.
[00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:50.940]   It is that one sin that led to the judgment of condemnation.
[00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:54.280]   Now, let's be clear about this.
[00:09:54.280 --> 00:10:01.980]   He doesn't say that that one sin of Adam has led us, by following Adam's example,
[00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:05.920]   to sin ourselves and thereby bring us under condemnation.
[00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:08.300]   That isn't what he's saying.
[00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:14.100]   He says that the judgment of condemnation has come as the result of that one sin, and
[00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:17.900]   that is his whole case throughout.
[00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:22.460]   Neither does he say that as the result of that one sin of Adam, we've all inherited
[00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:29.460]   from Adam a sinful nature, and that because we've got a sinful nature, God condemns
[00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:30.460]   us.
[00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:31.460]   He doesn't say that.
[00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:35.300]   He says the judgment of condemnation came on the one sin.
[00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:38.900]   He doesn't say that because we've got that sinful nature, we then in turn fall into
[00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:41.460]   sin and thereby under condemnation.
[00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:42.460]   Not at all.
[00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:49.100]   It is the one sin that produced the judgment of condemnation.
[00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:53.580]   You see, it's all in verse 12, "By one man sin entered into the world, and death
[00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:57.620]   by sin, and so death passed upon all men."
[00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:05.900]   It's the one sin all along that has produced all these evil consequences and terrible results.
[00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:11.540]   So we sum it up once more by saying that the apostle is asserting here that as the result
[00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:22.540]   of Adam's one sin, condemnation, a judgment, a sentence of condemnation, has been passed
[00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:27.740]   upon the whole world of men.
[00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:32.140]   But thank God we can turn to the other side.
[00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:36.780]   Not as it was by the one that sinned, so is the gift.
[00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:39.700]   Thank God, I say, we can turn to this.
[00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:51.220]   For whereas the judgment was by one to condemnation, the free gift is of many offenses unto justification.
[00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:55.660]   Now notice these contrasts, they really are most important.
[00:11:55.660 --> 00:12:06.940]   And the contrast is complete, and therefore we must look at it and work it out in detail.
[00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:14.180]   You see, it's the contrast between what Adam's disobedience has produced for us and Christ's
[00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:16.660]   obedience has produced for us.
[00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:19.660]   Well, he says the free gift.
[00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:20.660]   What does this oppose?
[00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:24.340]   Well, that's the opposite to the judgment.
[00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:27.060]   Not as it was by one that sinned is the free gift.
[00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:32.180]   The free gift, he says again, and how he delights to repeat these terms.
[00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:36.660]   He glories in free grace and in the free gift of salvation.
[00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:40.100]   It's also free, and it's always a gift.
[00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:44.980]   He'll never allow us to forget that for a moment, though he said it so plainly in verse
[00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:52.060]   15, here it is again, "Not as the offense, so also is the free gift."
[00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:58.420]   And you know, it's a very good test of our Christian profession to ask ourselves and
[00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:02.220]   to discover in ourselves how we react to these terms.
[00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:04.980]   Are we as fond of them as the apostle was?
[00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:11.220]   Do we like to talk about free grace and the free gift?
[00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:16.900]   Pharisees never like to, because Pharisees feel that that makes them paupers, and they
[00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:19.260]   like to feel they've earned it and they've done something.
[00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:21.500]   They don't like to emphasize this freeness.
[00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:27.180]   Oh, if a man delights in free grace and in the free gift, you can be sure he's a man
[00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:31.660]   who's seen his utter sinfulness and his utter hopelessness and helplessness.
[00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:36.580]   The free gift is the opposite to the judgment.
[00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:38.780]   Then notice the second contrast.
[00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:49.660]   Here, he says, what we've got is that many offenses have been justified.
[00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:53.740]   In spite of our many offenses, we have been justified.
[00:13:53.740 --> 00:14:02.100]   Now, as I was saying, the many offenses are the contrast to the one offense of Adam.
[00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:06.660]   And therefore we notice this, which is most important for us.
[00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:17.860]   The many offenses include not only the one original sin of Adam, but it includes all
[00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:26.460]   the sins that have ever been committed, or ever will be committed, by any of Christ's
[00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:27.540]   people.
[00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:30.100]   We were condemned because of the one sin of Adam.
[00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:35.740]   Ah, yes, but when we come to be justified, we are not only justified in respect to that
[00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:41.880]   one sin, but all the sins that we've all committed ourselves.
[00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:44.940]   The many offenses.
[00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:48.420]   So I trust we're all perfectly clear about that.
[00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:55.100]   In the work of Christ, we are not only delivered from what we've inherited in Adam, we are
[00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:59.580]   delivered and we are cleared from all the sins and offenses.
[00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:02.860]   We ourselves have ever been guilty of.
[00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:07.180]   What a large, what a free, what a glorious salvation this is.
[00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:15.940]   All our sins were laid upon him, all the sins of all his people.
[00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:21.420]   Even those yet unborn who are going to be his people, all their sins were laid upon
[00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:29.140]   him, and in him we are all justified from all our sins, past, present, and future.
[00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:31.780]   That's what he's saying.
[00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:34.180]   And he brings it out, you see, in his contrast.
[00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:37.620]   The one offense, the many offenses.
[00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:44.220]   And then the final contrast is this justification.
[00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:50.180]   And justification, you notice, is the antithesis of condemnation.
[00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:55.860]   The most important point, I wonder if you remember, that when we began to deal with
[00:15:55.860 --> 00:16:05.980]   this term right at the beginning in the first chapter, in verse 17 and so on, I was at great
[00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:16.780]   pains to emphasize this, that justification must never be thought of in terms of our state
[00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:22.720]   and condition, never be thought of in terms of our sanctification.
[00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:27.560]   I emphasized, and I've gone on emphasizing, that justification is a legal or a forensic
[00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:28.560]   term.
[00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:32.520]   It's a judgment delivered by a judge upon the bench.
[00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:42.100]   And indeed, I was at pains to say this, that justification is always the opposite of condemnation.
[00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:48.580]   Here is the verse which says that perhaps more plainly than any other single verse.
[00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:54.380]   His contrast at this point is condemnation, justification.
[00:16:54.380 --> 00:17:00.860]   In other words, as condemnation is a forensic term, justification is a forensic term.
[00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:04.060]   And it must always be thought of in that way.
[00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:11.600]   So he says that the contrast is that as the result of this free gift of many offenses
[00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:25.260]   unto justification, righteous judgment, God pronouncing us to be righteous in Christ.
[00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:30.060]   In spite of what we've inherited from Adam, in spite of all the sins we've been guilty
[00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:38.580]   of ourselves, God pronounces us to be clear, that he regards us as righteous in Christ.
[00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:47.300]   All our sins are blotted out, and he pronounces us and declares us to be acceptable and righteous
[00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:50.460]   in his most holy sight.
[00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:57.540]   It is the complete and exact opposite and antithesis of condemnation, the thing that
[00:17:57.540 --> 00:18:03.460]   came upon us as the result of Adam's sin and the judgment that was pronounced upon
[00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:04.460]   it.
[00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:10.420]   Nothing could be fuller, nothing could be freer, nothing could present such a glorious
[00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:12.100]   and such a striking contrast.
[00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:18.020]   Very well, now he's brought us, you see, up to this point.
[00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:25.740]   He said in verse 15 that this one offense of Adam had led to this result, that many
[00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:26.740]   died.
[00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:30.900]   Well, in verse 16 he's taken us as far as this.
[00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:36.380]   The one offense, the one sin, led to judgment, and the judgment was condemnation.
[00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:38.420]   But he doesn't take it any further.
[00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:48.660]   Now here, in verse 17, he takes it a step further.
[00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:52.260]   Sin leads to judgment, the judgment is one of condemnation, and the condemnation that
[00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:58.360]   is passed and is pronounced is death.
[00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:03.940]   So he takes up that point here, you see, "For if by one man's offense, death reigned by
[00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:04.940]   one."
[00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:07.260]   There he's completed it.
[00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:12.080]   Having stated it in general in verse 15, he's shown us how the steps intervene and bring
[00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:16.380]   us to this point of death.
[00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:23.060]   But on the other hand, he's going to tell us that salvation doesn't stop at justification,
[00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:32.300]   but leads on to what he calls "our reigning in life by one, Jesus Christ."
[00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:40.280]   So that he has now worked the full statement of verse 15 out in all its details and component
[00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:41.280]   parts.
[00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:45.780]   But let's again follow him as he does it step-by-step.
[00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:55.340]   You notice he doesn't hesitate to repeat, "For if by one man's offense," there it is
[00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:56.340]   again.
[00:19:56.340 --> 00:20:03.620]   It does really pass comprehension, doesn't it, as to how anybody can possibly argue with
[00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:04.620]   this statement.
[00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:11.060]   And as I reminded you the other Friday evening, they don't really argue with it at all.
[00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:16.940]   You either accept this or you've just got to say, as so many modern expositors do, say
[00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:21.700]   that the Apostle Paul was wrong at this point, that he was making a mistake, that he was
[00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:24.340]   just following the rabbinical teaching of his age.
[00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:25.620]   They don't hesitate to say that.
[00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:29.500]   Of course, they're bound to say it, or else to accept it as it is.
[00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:34.040]   There is no question as to what Paul is saying, and they've got to grant that and do grant
[00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:35.040]   that.
[00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:39.220]   So all they're left with saying is, "Well, of course he was wrong there, that's all.
[00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:40.380]   They just don't agree with him.
[00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:44.580]   He was a child of his age, and he fell into error," and so on.
[00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:50.300]   At any rate, we'll grant this, that it's a clear position and a logical one.
[00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:54.460]   But no Christian who believes this to be the word of God has any right to be muddled at
[00:20:54.460 --> 00:21:00.580]   all, because the Apostle, in every single sentence he utters, he keeps on repeating
[00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:01.580]   it.
[00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:11.740]   "For if by one man's offence," that one man being Adam, "it is by his one offence that
[00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:18.180]   death reigned by one."
[00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:25.820]   Now here, you see, he's adding it again, "death reigned by one."
[00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:26.820]   What is this?
[00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:31.380]   Well, again, it's the one man Adam.
[00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:35.620]   And there is only one conceivable explanation, and that is that the Apostle was so anxious
[00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:40.540]   that nobody should be, in any way, muddled in his or her mind about this.
[00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:50.620]   So having said, "for if by one man's offence death reigned by one," he's re-emphasizing,
[00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:57.660]   he's repeating, for the sake of double emphasis, so that nobody should ever be in any trouble.
[00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:02.740]   It's the one man, and it's the one offence of that one man.
[00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:08.660]   So you see, in the one sentence he says, "by one," twice over.
[00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:13.740]   Can we now then take it for granted that everybody is clear about that?
[00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:19.980]   His double, surely, at this point, ought to settle it for us once and forever.
[00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:32.180]   It was Adam's one offence, that one man Adam, and his one offence that brought in death.
[00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:40.300]   But you notice that he puts this in a most extraordinary phrase, "if by one man's offence
[00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:49.340]   death reigned," he says, "death reigned," what a graphic statement it is.
[00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:58.500]   Can you think of or imagine any statement which more perfectly sums up life in this
[00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:10.660]   world apart from Christ than that particular statement, "death reigned."
[00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:19.580]   Death came in as a conqueror, death triumphed over all, death held sway over everybody.
[00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:25.660]   And so the whole of mankind, as the result of this one sin of Adam, has been subject
[00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:27.820]   to death and to the tyranny of death.
[00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:33.500]   Now, you see, he has already said this before, in verse 12, "wherefore as by one man sin
[00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:42.820]   entered into the world, and death by sin, and so death passed upon all men."
[00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:46.500]   There it is, it passed upon all men.
[00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:54.780]   In verse 14, still more definitely, "nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses."
[00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:59.340]   What a terrible, horrible phrase it is, but how true.
[00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:07.980]   And again, of course, he said it in verse 15 as well, "many be dead."
[00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:12.780]   But here he is now, I say, putting it still more plainly to us.
[00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:19.420]   It isn't merely that death passed upon all men, death, he says, has been reigning.
[00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:23.900]   Now a very good commentary on that is to be found in that chapter, the second chapter
[00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:27.220]   of the epistle to the Hebrews that we read just now.
[00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:32.980]   Listen to it, verses 14 and 15, "for as much then as the children are partakers of
[00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:40.820]   flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same, that through death
[00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:47.020]   he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil, and deliver them
[00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:57.580]   who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage."
[00:24:57.580 --> 00:25:02.780]   That is mankind in sin.
[00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:09.500]   You'll find that coming out so often in the Old Testament.
[00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:14.740]   You'll find the psalmist looking and seeing death coming and saying, "Oh, I want to
[00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:20.140]   praise you now," "Why, can the dead praise you?"
[00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:27.940]   Then you'll find the wise men in Proverbs saying, "Better a live dog than a dead lion."
[00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:33.460]   Death is so devastating, it's the end of everything.
[00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:38.220]   And that is why in the Old Testament, you see, before the glorious doctrine of the resurrection
[00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:43.300]   is fully expounded and brought clearly to light, as it is by the resurrection of the
[00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:48.820]   Lord Jesus Christ, you feel that there is this gloom and this doom.
[00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:55.420]   Oh, thank God, the patriarchs and others were given the faith to see beyond it.
[00:25:55.420 --> 00:26:00.820]   But I say, apart from that, apart from this preview they were given, there is gloom and
[00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:03.700]   death seems to be the end.
[00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:14.020]   And of course, the profoundest literary men of the world have always acknowledged this,
[00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:15.820]   they've always confessed it.
[00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:23.020]   Listen to some of them saying, "It's since every man who lives, says Dryden, is born
[00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:29.060]   to die, and none can boast sincere felicity.
[00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:34.780]   With equal mind, what happens, let us bear, nor joy, nor grieve too much for things beyond
[00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:36.220]   our care.
[00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:42.820]   Like pilgrims to the appointed place we tend, the world's an inn, and death, the journey's
[00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:43.820]   end."
[00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:44.820]   That's it.
[00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:56.100]   Go and listen to Thomas Gray as he meditates and ruminates in that churchyard in Stoke
[00:26:56.100 --> 00:27:02.660]   Purges, and this is what you'll find him saying, "The burst of heraldry, the pump of power,
[00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:08.260]   and all that beauty, all that wealth there gave, await a like the inevitable hour.
[00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:19.060]   The paths of glory lead but to the grave, where all their lifetimes subject to bondage,
[00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:22.580]   and the world today is as terrified of death as it ever was.
[00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:26.640]   Much of the modern excitement about the hydrogen bomb is because of that.
[00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:30.540]   These men you see, about whom you read in the papers, they've got no hope beyond this
[00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:35.540]   world and beyond death and the grave, so they're protesting, and that's their reason for it.
[00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:38.400]   They know nothing about life in glory.
[00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:42.540]   This life's everything to them, so the horrible thing is death.
[00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:45.540]   They're manifesting it unconsciously.
[00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:50.900]   That's quite apart from one's personal particular views about the use of hydrogen bombs, which
[00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:55.620]   on any showing is sheer madness, but it's interesting to note the people who get most
[00:27:55.620 --> 00:28:04.420]   excited about it, and they're there just acknowledging that death is reigning over them, and they're
[00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:09.260]   horrified, they're terrified, and all this modern cult of trying to keep young and not
[00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:12.380]   aging gracefully, it's all part of the same thing.
[00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:15.300]   It's their horror and terror and dread of death.
[00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:20.260]   It's the specter that amazes them and haunts them, and they ever see coming nearer and
[00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:21.260]   nearer to them.
[00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:30.060]   Oh, I've quoted you bits of poetry, here's another one.
[00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:35.720]   I strove with none, for none was worth my strife.
[00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:39.940]   Nature I loved, and next to nature art.
[00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:47.100]   I worn both hands before the fire of life, it sinks, and I am ready to depart.
[00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:48.660]   What utter hopelessness.
[00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:51.700]   I have nothing to fall back upon.
[00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:53.180]   Death reign.
[00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:58.060]   And shall I quote you one more?
[00:28:58.060 --> 00:29:03.300]   The head of an Oxford college wrote words like this in his own autobiography during
[00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:04.300]   the last war.
[00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:10.380]   He said, "But for me, the outbreak of war brought to an end the long summer of my life.
[00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:16.900]   Henceforth, I have nothing to look forward to except chill autumn and still chillier winter.
[00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:21.580]   But I must somehow try not to lose hope."
[00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:23.740]   I know of nothing more hopeless than that.
[00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:27.380]   Death reigned, and so it has.
[00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:34.480]   Ever since Adam fell, death ray has reigned over mankind and over the whole world.
[00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:36.980]   It's a place of cemeteries, if you like.
[00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:41.220]   It's a place of death and gloom and end.
[00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:42.220]   Death reigned.
[00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:44.580]   How true it is.
[00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:51.220]   And how thankful we should be that we can turn to the contrast, that we have something
[00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:52.780]   else to consider.
[00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:53.780]   Listen.
[00:29:53.780 --> 00:30:03.020]   "For if by one man's offence death reigned by one, much more, much more, they which receive
[00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:10.460]   abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ."
[00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:15.700]   Oh, let's look at the terms.
[00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:16.700]   What is the contrast?
[00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:22.180]   Well, "much more," he says, "they which receive."
[00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:27.940]   Here's the contrast, isn't it?
[00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:36.420]   The contrast is undoubtedly this, that here on this side we actively and voluntarily receive
[00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:45.100]   and believe by contrast to our unconscious involvement in the sin of Adam.
[00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:50.860]   Now, that's not a contrast that I thought of; that's John Calvin's contrast for you.
[00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:57.060]   Calvin says that one of the contrasts here is "they that receive the activity of faith."
[00:30:57.060 --> 00:31:01.860]   He isn't considering at the moment how a man ever gets faith; that will come in due time.
[00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:08.860]   He's simply saying here that "they that receive the abundance of grace."
[00:31:08.860 --> 00:31:16.820]   We were unconsciously involved in Adam; here we consciously embrace the gift of salvation.
[00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:21.500]   And every man who is a Christian does that.
[00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:26.780]   Very well, then, here is the first contrast, "they that receive."
[00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:32.540]   He is contrasted with the thing that happened to us way back in the Garden of Eden, so many
[00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:35.060]   centuries before we were ever born.
[00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:40.920]   We were involved in it; we sinned there, unconsciously.
[00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:44.960]   But here we receive, "they that receive."
[00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:46.580]   And then here is this great phrase.
[00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:51.500]   I needn't stay with it because we really did deal with it in verse 15, but let us take
[00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:57.740]   to ourselves the pleasure of repeating it again, "they which receive abundance of grace
[00:31:57.740 --> 00:32:01.660]   and of the gift."
[00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:02.660]   Of what?
[00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:08.980]   Well, it is, he says, the gift of righteousness.
[00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:15.580]   And we must stop with this because here you see he's advanced the doctrine again.
[00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:19.820]   At the end of verse 16 he left us with justification.
[00:32:19.820 --> 00:32:23.140]   He says justification isn't the end.
[00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:26.260]   Justification is only the beginning, and it's only part of it.
[00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:30.780]   We receive the gift of righteousness.
[00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:31.780]   What is this?
[00:32:31.780 --> 00:32:34.340]   Well, let me try and explain it.
[00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:41.020]   Justification, I say, means that we are pronounced to be righteous.
[00:32:41.020 --> 00:32:49.380]   It includes forgiveness of sins and the pronouncement that we are righteous, that God smiles upon
[00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:50.500]   us.
[00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:52.900]   We are reconciled to God.
[00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:58.820]   Yes, says Paul, but don't forget that even there, there is something further, and it
[00:32:58.820 --> 00:33:01.540]   is this.
[00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:03.780]   It is not merely that we are forgiven.
[00:33:03.780 --> 00:33:07.700]   We are forgiven, but over and above being forgiven.
[00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:14.060]   The righteousness of Jesus Christ is put to our account.
[00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:15.900]   It is put upon us.
[00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:22.580]   We are clothed with the righteousness of Jesus Christ, much more they which receive abundance
[00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:25.780]   of grace and of the gift of righteousness.
[00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:29.860]   You're not merely told that your sins are forgiven but left as you were, not at all.
[00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:33.620]   The righteousness of Christ is imputed to you, it's put upon you.
[00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:41.420]   So Zinzendorf could write his hymn and John Wesley translated, "Jesus, thy robe of righteousness,
[00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:47.300]   thy beauty is my glorious dress."
[00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:48.300]   That's the thing.
[00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:54.220]   We are robed and clothed with the righteousness of Jesus Christ.
[00:33:54.220 --> 00:34:00.500]   And therefore, I must remind you once more that Isaac Watts was perfectly right when
[00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:10.160]   he said, "In him the tribes of Adam boast more blessings than their father lost."
[00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:16.060]   Adam was righteous, but it was his own righteousness as a created being.
[00:34:16.060 --> 00:34:19.100]   It was the righteousness of a man.
[00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:24.700]   Adam never had the righteousness of Jesus Christ upon him.
[00:34:24.700 --> 00:34:28.100]   What he lost was his own righteousness.
[00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:32.380]   But you and I are not merely given back a human righteousness, the righteousness that
[00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:39.220]   Adam had before he fell, we are given the righteousness of Jesus Christ.
[00:34:39.220 --> 00:34:46.060]   Much more, much more abundance, superabundance, give full weight to it.
[00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:52.060]   So we receive this abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness.
[00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:55.700]   Oh, how important this is!
[00:34:55.700 --> 00:35:00.940]   And nowhere is it more important than when you and I pray to God.
[00:35:00.940 --> 00:35:03.940]   For what is prayer?
[00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:09.500]   Prayer is going to have an audience with the King.
[00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:13.500]   And there is nothing more important as you enter into the audience chamber than to know
[00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:20.100]   that you are suitably clad, that you are sufficiently respectable if you like to go in.
[00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:23.540]   That's the thing that would engage our attention if we were going to have an audience with
[00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:24.540]   the Queen.
[00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:26.860]   We'd want everything to be right and perfect.
[00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:33.020]   Oh, how infinitely more important is it when we go to have an audience with the Maker and
[00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:36.540]   the Creator of the universe, with God?
[00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:44.820]   Let us never forget that our only right of entry, the only way in which we can enter
[00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:50.780]   at all with any kind of confidence, is to know that we have received the gift of righteousness,
[00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:55.940]   that we are clothed with the righteousness of Jesus Christ, and that therefore in a sense
[00:35:55.940 --> 00:36:00.740]   we have a right to stand, having therefore, brethren, says the author of the epistle to
[00:36:00.740 --> 00:36:07.340]   the Hebrews, boldness to enter into the holiest of all.
[00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:15.900]   Confidence and assurance with boldness, it's all because we have received the righteousness
[00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:17.580]   of Jesus Christ.
[00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:19.700]   It isn't only forgiveness, remember.
[00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:21.620]   It isn't only absolution.
[00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:29.100]   It is being given and clothed upon with the righteousness of Jesus Christ.
[00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:30.100]   What else?
[00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:31.860]   Well, here is the final.
[00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:42.900]   The final antithesis is between being dominated by death, death reigned over every man.
[00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:49.140]   If by one man's offense death reigned, what is the opposite?
[00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:53.300]   Well, you say the opposite of death reigning is life reigning.
[00:36:53.300 --> 00:37:00.420]   You are quite right, but the apostle says there is much more than that in it, much more.
[00:37:00.420 --> 00:37:06.420]   Because he says the contrast to death reigning is this, that we shall reign in life by one,
[00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:08.900]   Jesus Christ.
[00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:12.780]   And what a tremendous distinction.
[00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:17.840]   In other words, he is not merely saying that as the result of our Lord's work, that instead
[00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:23.260]   of death reigning over us, that we are going to receive the gift of eternal life and that
[00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:25.660]   therefore life is going to reign over us.
[00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:26.980]   That is gloriously true.
[00:37:26.980 --> 00:37:30.660]   But wait, he says, we go beyond that.
[00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:35.820]   We ourselves shall reign in life.
[00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:36.820]   Much more.
[00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:42.820]   It isn't the exact opposite; it is more than an exact opposite.
[00:37:42.820 --> 00:37:47.860]   Now then, what does he mean by our reigning in life by one, Jesus Christ?
[00:37:47.860 --> 00:37:53.780]   Well, I think he means something like this.
[00:37:53.780 --> 00:38:03.220]   We reign in life by Jesus Christ partly, even here and now in this present world.
[00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:08.660]   You will find that the apostle Paul in his epistle to the Ephesians in the second chapter
[00:38:08.660 --> 00:38:15.780]   says this, "Even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ, and
[00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:25.780]   hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus."
[00:38:25.780 --> 00:38:27.980]   That has already happened to us.
[00:38:27.980 --> 00:38:32.960]   And that is a part of the reigning in life, even here and now.
[00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:39.300]   Another one is the one that he gives us there in Hebrews 2.15, "And deliver them who through
[00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:47.020]   fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage."
[00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:53.140]   The Christian should be delivered from the fear of death.
[00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:58.060]   Christ delivers him from it, so he is no longer under that bondage and tyranny of the fear
[00:38:58.060 --> 00:38:59.060]   of death.
[00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:02.500]   He is reigning in it, reigning over it.
[00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:09.380]   He has got a victory over death already before he has met it.
[00:39:09.380 --> 00:39:17.260]   But not only that, sin does not reign over him either, and sin, you remember, leads to
[00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:19.900]   judgment and judgment to death.
[00:39:19.900 --> 00:39:24.820]   So if we are to reign in life, we must be free from the dominion of sin.
[00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:30.460]   And in the next chapter the apostle will tell us in verse 14, "For sin shall not have dominion
[00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:37.220]   over you, for you are not under the law, but under grace."
[00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:41.460]   Not only do we get a victory over sin, we even get a victory over the devil.
[00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:47.780]   "Look here," says James, "resist the devil and he will flee from you."
[00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:54.900]   Peter puts it in the same way, "Your adversary the devil, he says, is a roaring lion, seeketh
[00:39:54.900 --> 00:40:01.300]   whom he may devour, whom resist, steadfast in the faith."
[00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:04.860]   That is what he means by reigning in life.
[00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:06.900]   We have lost the fear of death.
[00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:11.580]   We are no longer under the dominion of sin, whereas we once were.
[00:40:11.580 --> 00:40:14.140]   We are no longer under the dominion of the devil.
[00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:17.420]   We can resist him and make him flee.
[00:40:17.420 --> 00:40:24.660]   Indeed, we are no longer under the tyranny of life itself.
[00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:29.020]   In the eighth chapter the apostle will say, having given a list of the things that are
[00:40:29.020 --> 00:40:34.620]   set against us, "For thy sake we are killed all the day long, we are accounted as sheep
[00:40:34.620 --> 00:40:35.620]   for the slaughter."
[00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:42.460]   Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.
[00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:45.600]   We are more than conquerors.
[00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:49.900]   We are reigning in life.
[00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:54.140]   And he says the same thing, you remember, in that glorious statement of his in the fourth
[00:40:54.140 --> 00:41:03.300]   chapter of the epistle to the Philippians, in verses 9 to 11, he says here that he is—not
[00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:10.860]   that I—verses 11 to 13, "Not that I speak in respect of want, for I have learned in
[00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:16.660]   whatsoever state I am therewith to be content.
[00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:22.860]   I know both how to be abased and I know how to abound everywhere, and in all things I
[00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:29.380]   am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.
[00:41:29.380 --> 00:41:36.340]   I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me."
[00:41:36.340 --> 00:41:45.820]   He is reigning in life, he has mastered life, sin, Satan, life, death, everything.
[00:41:45.820 --> 00:41:55.300]   He is more than conqueror; that is already in the present.
[00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:58.820]   But oh, tremendous and glorious things are coming.
[00:41:58.820 --> 00:42:03.260]   This is but a first fruit, a foretaste of it all.
[00:42:03.260 --> 00:42:09.780]   It is when the Lord returns and when we shall be with him that we shall really know what
[00:42:09.780 --> 00:42:12.700]   it means to reign in life fully.
[00:42:12.700 --> 00:42:13.700]   What is it?
[00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:20.060]   Well, he has already hinted at it in chapter 2 in verse 7 and verse 10, where he says we
[00:42:20.060 --> 00:42:26.220]   are looking for glory and honor and immortality and peace.
[00:42:26.220 --> 00:42:32.100]   Our Lord himself has already told us about it.
[00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:39.020]   He is going to say to his people, "Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom
[00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:43.740]   prepared for you from the foundation of the world."
[00:42:43.740 --> 00:42:50.620]   "Yes," says the apostle Paul, "at the end of his long and arduous and suffering life,
[00:42:50.620 --> 00:42:57.620]   henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness."
[00:42:57.620 --> 00:43:06.340]   "Yes," says the author of the epistle to the Hebrews in chapter 2, verse 5, "not unto
[00:43:06.340 --> 00:43:11.860]   the angels hath he put in subjection the world to come whereof we speak."
[00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:13.180]   Well, for whom then?
[00:43:13.180 --> 00:43:16.420]   For us, the heirs of salvation.
[00:43:16.420 --> 00:43:21.660]   This glorious world that is coming, it isn't to be subject to angels, but to us, he says,
[00:43:21.660 --> 00:43:24.780]   not unto angels, but unto us.
[00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:33.220]   "Yes," says John in the book of Revelations, chapter 1, verse 6, "he hath made us kings
[00:43:33.220 --> 00:43:41.900]   and priests unto God," a kingdom if you like, but that is kings and priests unto God.
[00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:47.340]   Or listen to him in chapter 3, verse 21, "To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with
[00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:54.860]   me in my throne, even as I also overcame and am sat down with my Father in his throne."
[00:43:54.860 --> 00:43:56.220]   You are going to be a king.
[00:43:56.220 --> 00:43:59.580]   The crowning day is coming.
[00:43:59.580 --> 00:44:06.780]   Chapter 5, verse 10, "And hath made us unto our God kings and priests, and we shall reign
[00:44:06.780 --> 00:44:13.180]   on the earth, reign in life by one."
[00:44:13.180 --> 00:44:20.020]   "Oh," says the apostle Paul to the Corinthians in his first epistle, chapter 6, verse 2,
[00:44:20.020 --> 00:44:25.300]   "the foolish people were going to court against one another and couldn't settle little disputes."
[00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:30.260]   Listen, says Paul, "Do you not know that the saints shall judge the world?"
[00:44:30.260 --> 00:44:35.460]   And then in verse 3, "Know ye not that we shall judge angels?"
[00:44:35.460 --> 00:44:45.980]   "Shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ."
[00:44:45.980 --> 00:44:47.980]   Who is Jesus Christ?
[00:44:47.980 --> 00:44:53.220]   Well, I'll tell you who Jesus Christ is.
[00:44:53.220 --> 00:45:00.140]   Jesus Christ is described as the King of kings.
[00:45:00.140 --> 00:45:05.780]   Well, who are the kings of whom he is the king?
[00:45:05.780 --> 00:45:07.100]   You and myself.
[00:45:07.100 --> 00:45:11.060]   That's what that means.
[00:45:11.060 --> 00:45:13.100]   It doesn't mean earthly kings.
[00:45:13.100 --> 00:45:14.940]   All that will have gone by then.
[00:45:14.940 --> 00:45:16.740]   He's King of kings.
[00:45:16.740 --> 00:45:17.940]   Who are the kings?
[00:45:17.940 --> 00:45:18.940]   His people.
[00:45:18.940 --> 00:45:20.620]   Every one of us is made a king.
[00:45:20.620 --> 00:45:22.100]   We shall reign with him.
[00:45:22.100 --> 00:45:23.580]   We shall judge the world.
[00:45:23.580 --> 00:45:26.420]   We shall judge angels.
[00:45:26.420 --> 00:45:32.260]   Oh, it's not surprising that the apostle therefore puts it as he does here in this
[00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:39.460]   seventeenth verse, "For if by one man's offence death reigned by one, much more they which
[00:45:39.460 --> 00:45:46.020]   receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one,
[00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:50.500]   Jesus Christ."
[00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:54.500]   Adam was made Lord of creation.
[00:45:54.500 --> 00:45:56.540]   He lost it.
[00:45:56.540 --> 00:46:00.020]   We shall not only have that back, we shall have infinitely more.
[00:46:00.020 --> 00:46:06.020]   We shall share the throne with the Son of God who shares the throne with his Father.
[00:46:06.020 --> 00:46:08.420]   That's the prospect awaiting us.
[00:46:08.420 --> 00:46:13.620]   Is it surprising he talks about much more and about abundance and about the freeness
[00:46:13.620 --> 00:46:17.860]   and the fullness of it all?
[00:46:17.860 --> 00:46:31.420]   King of kings, reigning in life by one, Jesus Christ.
[00:46:31.420 --> 00:46:37.140]   Very well then, my dear friends, realizing these things.
[00:46:37.140 --> 00:46:42.340]   This is what we say about ourselves, isn't it?
[00:46:42.340 --> 00:46:53.980]   "From glory into glory, till in heaven we take our place, till we cast our crowns before
[00:46:53.980 --> 00:47:04.380]   him, lost in wonder, love, and praise."
[00:47:04.380 --> 00:47:11.940]   Do you realize as you sit in this chapel this evening that he has made you already king
[00:47:11.940 --> 00:47:22.380]   and priest, that we are seated with him in the heavenly places, that therefore we should
[00:47:22.380 --> 00:47:30.140]   be reigning in life here and now, whatever may be set against us, and that we should
[00:47:30.140 --> 00:47:39.420]   regard ourselves ever as those who are going to judge the world with him and even judge
[00:47:39.420 --> 00:47:43.380]   angels?
[00:47:43.380 --> 00:47:46.380]   Amen.
[00:47:46.380 --> 00:47:56.940]   O Lord, our God, as we realize these things together and come into thy holy presence,
[00:47:56.940 --> 00:48:05.060]   we confess and acknowledge that we are ashamed of ourselves, that we whom thou hast thus
[00:48:05.060 --> 00:48:12.980]   set free through thy dear Son should listen so much to the world and to the flesh and
[00:48:12.980 --> 00:48:21.060]   to the devil, and should be afraid of the world and the flesh and the devil and death.
[00:48:21.060 --> 00:48:30.700]   O God, have mercy and have pity upon us, and so reveal the truth to us concerning ourselves
[00:48:30.700 --> 00:48:39.140]   in Christ Jesus by thy blessed Holy Spirit, that we shall realize that we are thy children,
[00:48:39.140 --> 00:48:48.460]   that we are kings and priests, and that we shall reign in the earth and over the earth
[00:48:48.460 --> 00:48:51.660]   and judge the world and angels.
[00:48:51.660 --> 00:49:01.060]   O God, open our eyes and fill us with a sense of the certainty and the glory of the blessed
[00:49:01.060 --> 00:49:02.920]   truth.
[00:49:02.920 --> 00:49:12.420]   We ask it in the name of thy dear Son, our blessed Lord and Savior, who by his perfect
[00:49:12.420 --> 00:49:20.620]   obedience and his perfect oblation once made upon the cross, and by his triumph over death
[00:49:20.620 --> 00:49:28.260]   and the grave, and by his glorious resurrection and ascension, seated at thy right hand even
[00:49:28.260 --> 00:49:35.180]   now, makes all this possible to us and for us.
[00:49:35.180 --> 00:49:41.820]   And so may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship and
[00:49:41.820 --> 00:49:49.140]   the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now this night, throughout
[00:49:49.140 --> 00:49:59.260]   the remainder of this short and certain earthly life and pilgrimage, and until we shall be
[00:49:59.260 --> 00:50:04.220]   with him in glory forever.
[00:50:04.220 --> 00:50:06.020]   Amen.
[00:50:06.020 --> 00:50:09.940]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones.
