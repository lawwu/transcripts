[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.480]   We continue this morning our consideration of the seventeenth verse in the seventeenth
[00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:17.680]   chapter of the Gospel according to Saint John. 'Sanctify them through thy truth; thy word
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:28.040]   is truth.' In our consideration of this verse we have been emphasising the fact that the
[00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:37.980]   process of sanctification goes on in us and is maintained in us by God through his word.
[00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:44.180]   That is obviously the import of this petition which is here offered by our Lord on behalf
[00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:51.140]   of his people. He doesn't merely say 'sanctify them' but 'sanctify them through or in thy
[00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:57.280]   truth.' He prays that we all may be brought into the realm of the truth and to such an
[00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:03.720]   extent that the truth will operate upon us. We shall be living in it and it will be working
[00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:12.440]   in us and producing its gracious effects and results upon us and in us.
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:19.240]   And we are now in the process of considering this truth which does this. Our Lord further
[00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:25.880]   defines it by saying 'thy word is truth' and we are looking at that word. We have come
[00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.880]   to the conclusion that it is the whole word, that everything in the word conspires to this
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:38.840]   one end, that there is no part of the word truly considered and understood which doesn't
[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:45.120]   promote our sanctification. In other words, the truth that sanctifies is not just some
[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:53.040]   little department of truth, one aspect of truth. It is the whole truth, the entire truth,
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:02:00.080]   meaning, in a sense, which we have in this book which we call the Bible.
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.800]   But having said that it is thus the whole truth, we have indicated further that obviously
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:12.960]   there are certain big headings, certain big divisions, and last Sunday morning we began
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:19.960]   our consideration of these divisions. And we found that allowing the word to speak to
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:28.600]   us that clearly and obviously the first great section of truth which we must consider is
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:34.680]   the truth about God himself. And how most of our troubles arise from the fact that we
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.560]   start with ourselves instead of starting with God.
[00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.920]   The ultimate business of salvation is to bring us to know God. It isn't merely to make us
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.560]   better, it isn't merely to make us happy. There are all sorts of agencies that can do
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:58.360]   that. The primary object of Christian salvation is to bring men to know God, and to know themselves
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:05.400]   as the children of God, and the heirs of God, and joined as with Christ. You can have religion
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.480]   without God, you can have morality without God, you can have happiness, in a sense, without
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:18.760]   God. The specific object and purpose of everything that God has been graciously pleased to do
[00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:25.440]   in and through his only begotten Son is to bring us to a knowledge of himself. Our Lord
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:31.400]   has stated that so plainly in this great chapter that we are considering together. This is
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:39.040]   life eternal, that they might know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou
[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:45.600]   hast sent. And whatever we may have experienced, whatever may have happened to us, if we have
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:51.520]   not this knowledge of God, well then it's doubtful whether we are in a position of salvation
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:57.400]   at all. And there is certainly no value to any moral or ethical qualities that may belong
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:04.560]   to us, unless they derive centrally from this knowledge. We must start with the doctrine
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:11.120]   of God. The Bible is a book about God, and man has his being because of God. Everything
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:18.800]   comes from God, and everything goes to God. So that over everything is this great doctrine
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:23.360]   of God, the truth of the word of God about God himself.
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:31.960]   Well, having said that, and having emphasized that, we now come to the second great section
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:39.840]   of the truth, and that is, of course, the one which follows by a kind of inevitability
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:48.480]   and logical necessity from the doctrine of God, namely the doctrine of sin. What the
[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:58.000]   word has to tell us about sin, and about ourselves in a state and condition of sin. If, as I
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.800]   say, salvation ultimately means to know God, the great problem is, what is it that separates
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:10.040]   us from God? And the answer to that is sin. That's the biblical answer. It's nothing
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:17.520]   else. It isn't a lack of intellectual capacity. It isn't a philosophical inability. The
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:26.000]   one thing that comes between any one of us, and all of us, and God is sin. Now that's
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.600]   a great doctrine which you find running right through the Bible.
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:36.920]   Now I wonder whether we're all prepared to agree once more that here again is an aspect
[00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:45.640]   of the truth which, for some strange reason, we tend to neglect. I feel about this doctrine
[00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:52.920]   of sin that we can say about it what I once heard a man saying about the Lord's Day
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:06:00.080]   and the observance of the Lord's Day. He said he had come to the conclusion that the
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:10.020]   Lord's Day, like the Lord himself, was in danger of dying and expiring between two thieves.
[00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:16.040]   The two thieves, he said, are Saturday night and Monday morning. That increasingly, Saturday
[00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:21.180]   night was extended and extended and extended into Sunday. And then people started their
[00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:26.980]   Monday morning, he said, quite early on Sunday evening. Sunday just becomes just a few hours
[00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:32.180]   during the morning. Then we say, well, Sunday's finished now. We've been to church once
[00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:36.580]   and there's the end of it, and we begin our Monday, and our Lord's Day is being
[00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:41.060]   lost between the two thieves. I feel that it's equally true to say something
[00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:47.300]   like that about this biblical doctrine of sin. And it seems to me to be happening in
[00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:53.540]   this way. When we're dealing with the unconverted, we tend to say to them, "Ah, you needn't
[00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:58.500]   worry about sin now. That'll come later. All you need to do is to come to Christ, or
[00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:03.100]   to give yourself to Christ. Don't worry ahead about sin. Of course, you can't understand
[00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:07.500]   that now. All that'll develop later. Don't you worry whether you've got a sense of
[00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:12.500]   sin or deep conviction, and whether you understand these things or not. All you need to do is
[00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:17.280]   to come to Christ and to give yourself to Christ, and then you'll be very happy. That's
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:21.140]   one aspect. Then when we're dealing with those who have
[00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:27.420]   so come, our tendency to say to them is, "But of course, you mustn't look at yourself
[00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:33.820]   now. You must look to Christ. You mustn't be analyzing yourself." That's what you
[00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:37.700]   did before you were converted. You were thinking in terms of yourself and what you've got
[00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:44.380]   to do. The only thing you've got to do is to keep looking to Christ and away from yourself.
[00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:48.660]   And we imagine, therefore, that all that is needed by Christians is a certain amount of
[00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:54.480]   comfort and of encouragement, preaching about the love of God and about the general providence
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:59.820]   of God, and perhaps a certain amount of moral and ethical exhortation.
[00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:06.980]   And so, you see, the doctrine of sin is, as it were, crowded out. We don't emphasize
[00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:12.460]   it before conversion, and we don't emphasize it after conversion. And the result of it
[00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:17.220]   all is that we hear very little at all about it.
[00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:21.540]   Now, whether we agree with my explanation or not, I think we all must agree with the
[00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:30.820]   fact that the doctrine of sin has been sadly and grievously neglected. We know that instinctively
[00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:40.220]   we none of us like it. And thus it comes to pass, I say, that this doctrine is so little
[00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:45.700]   emphasized and so little has been heard of it. And yet, when you come to the Bible, as
[00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:55.020]   I say, you find it everywhere. And of necessity, it should be central for these reasons.
[00:08:55.020 --> 00:09:01.940]   Why should anybody come to Christ? What do they do when they come to Christ? What do
[00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:07.260]   they mean when they say that they believe on the Lord Jesus Christ? How can that possibly
[00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:14.940]   happen apart from some understanding of sin? You can't give yourself or your heart to Christ.
[00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:20.340]   You can't surrender to him. You can't, to use the phrase, take him as your Savior, unless
[00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:28.900]   you know what he's to save you from. So that surely it is unscriptural, utterly unscriptural,
[00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:34.340]   to indulge in any sort of evangelism apart from the doctrine of sin. There is no real
[00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:42.780]   meaning or content to the term Savior or salvation apart from this doctrine of sin, which has
[00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:48.260]   this tremendous emphasis in the Bible from beginning to end.
[00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:57.940]   Our fathers, perhaps I should say our grandfathers, and those who preceded them, the older evangelicalism
[00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:05.780]   always laid great emphasis on what it called a law work. It emphasized the importance of
[00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:14.220]   a thoroughgoing law work before you came to the gospel and its redemption. And they were
[00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:19.960]   very distrustful, always, of those who claimed salvation except in terms of a thoroughgoing
[00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:26.780]   preliminary law work. And as you read their lives, you will find that they have a great
[00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:31.580]   deal to say about the plague of their own hearts.
[00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:37.900]   Now if you read of saintly men like Robert Murray McChay and men of that generation and
[00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:42.860]   men who preceded that generation, the men of the eighteenth century, you'll find that
[00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:49.440]   that was their language, that was their terminology. And as I say, it's a language and a terminology
[00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:53.620]   that has somehow or another dropped out. And I think it has done so in the way that I've
[00:10:53.620 --> 00:11:00.920]   been indicating. But after all, whatever they may have said and thought, the fact by which
[00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:06.420]   we are confronted is that this is something that is found in the Bible everywhere, in
[00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:11.940]   the Old Testament and in the New. You can't get away from it. It's a doctrine that permeates
[00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:18.060]   the whole book, runs right through the whole teaching. And it is for that reason that we
[00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:24.300]   have to consider it. I'm suggesting that it is absolutely vital and essential to a
[00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:29.260]   true understanding of sanctification that we should know something about the biblical
[00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:38.500]   doctrine of sin. It is only as we realize the truth about ourselves and our condition,
[00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:46.060]   it is only as we come to realize our ultimate need that we apply to Christ who alone can
[00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:52.540]   supply it. In other words, there is surely nothing in experience that so drives one to
[00:11:52.540 --> 00:12:01.500]   Christ as the realization of one's need and of one's helplessness. "Foul I to the fountain
[00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:10.780]   fly, wash me, Saviour, or I die." Isn't that it? It's because I'm foul I fly to the fountain.
[00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:18.700]   If I don't realize my need of being washed, I won't go to the fountain. "Naked, come to
[00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:28.740]   thee for dress; helpless, look to thee for grace." These things of necessity go together.
[00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:34.540]   They that are hull have no need of a physician, but they that are sick. You don't go to your
[00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:40.100]   doctor if you feel perfectly well. You never make any kind of application for any kind
[00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:45.340]   of healing or redemption or salvation unless you are conscious of your need in it. And
[00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:49.340]   that, of course, is the whole trouble with the world today. It doesn't realize this need.
[00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:52.820]   That's why it doesn't believe in the Lord Jesus Christ. But the same thing is true in
[00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:59.420]   principle of the converted and of the Christian. It is those who realize their condition and
[00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:09.340]   their need most deeply are the ones who apply most constantly to the Lord himself.
[00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:16.300]   Now this is the universal testimony of the saint. It doesn't matter when they lived,
[00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:22.420]   where they lived, it doesn't matter what century they belonged to. You read the life
[00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:29.740]   of any saint of God, anyone who so stood out in saintliness that somebody felt it right
[00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:33.740]   and good and fitting that a biography should be written of him or of her, and you'll find
[00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:40.900]   that invariably this has been a characteristic of such a person. You read their lives and
[00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:47.420]   you find if you read their diaries that they bemoaned the fact that there was sin still
[00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:54.940]   in them, indwelling sin. Yes, this plague of their own heart, as they called it. This
[00:13:54.940 --> 00:14:03.020]   thing in them that was vitiating so often their testimony and hampering what they really
[00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:09.300]   desired to be and to do for the Lord. It's invariable. Those who have testified to the
[00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:16.780]   most high and glorious and thrilling experiences have always at the same time testified to
[00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:20.980]   this other thing. Indeed, the life of the Christian seems to
[00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:28.020]   be some sort of an ellipse which works and runs between these two focal points. At one
[00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:35.580]   and the same time, you always find in the saint a hearty detestation of self, a misery
[00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:43.260]   about self, and yet a rejoicing and a joy in the Lord, and the one of necessity determines
[00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:47.620]   the other. Well then, here I say is something that is
[00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:53.540]   found thus in general everywhere in the Scriptures and in the testimony of God's people throughout
[00:14:53.540 --> 00:15:00.740]   the centuries. But let us be a little bit more particular. This is the truth, I say,
[00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:05.700]   which the Word of God teaches us. It teaches us about God, then it teaches us about sin,
[00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:10.060]   and that's the way in which it sanctifies us. Let me ask a question, therefore. What
[00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:17.300]   are the ways in which it presents this particular aspect of the truth? I am not going to deal
[00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:22.980]   with it exhaustively. I am going to give you some of the most obvious general divisions.
[00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:29.340]   The first way in which the Scriptures, the Word of God teach this is, of course, by means
[00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:37.220]   of the teaching about the law, the law of God. Now there is great teaching about the
[00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:44.460]   law, the law of God in the Bible. A law was originally given to man in the Garden of Eden.
[00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:48.460]   The Scriptures tell us that there is a law written on the heart of every person born
[00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:52.940]   into this world, that even the heathen, who have never heard this Scripture, have got
[00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:58.340]   the law of God written in their hearts. Paul, you remember, teaches that in the second chapter
[00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:03.980]   of the Epistle to the Romans. And then, of course, it is here in the Bible in a very
[00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:13.660]   special way, in terms of the law that was given through Moses to the children of Israel.
[00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:19.400]   Here you get the account of it given in the book of Exodus. Then you get constant references
[00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:24.620]   to it. You get the references in the Psalms. You get it running right through the prophets.
[00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:30.020]   They are, in a sense, doing nothing but applying this law that was given, reminding the nation
[00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:36.060]   of it. It is everywhere in the Old Testament. And, indeed, it is true to say that we just
[00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:40.860]   cannot understand the Old Testament and its message unless we are clear about the place
[00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:46.180]   and the function of the law of God in it. And you come to the New Testament and you
[00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:52.820]   find it there again everywhere. These constant arguments concerning the law, what is their
[00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:57.660]   meaning, what is their purpose, if we do not really understand what the law is?
[00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:06.020]   Now, the law, I say, is given primarily in order to bring out these two points about
[00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:13.100]   the holiness of God and the consequent sinfulness of men in the light of that holiness. It is
[00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:20.100]   very interesting to observe in this connection the way in which the Jews completely misunderstood
[00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:26.500]   that. The real trouble with the Jews, as Paul especially is never tired of arguing, the
[00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:32.380]   real trouble with them was that they entirely misinterpreted the meaning of the law. They
[00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:37.380]   thought the purpose of the law was this, that God gave them the law and, in effect, said
[00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:42.180]   to them, 'Now you keep that and you will be saved. You save yourselves by keeping the
[00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:48.100]   law.' And they persuaded themselves that they had done so. They conveniently misinterpreted
[00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:52.820]   it and then they carried out their own misinterpretation and they said, 'We have kept the law and
[00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:59.740]   we are just before God.' That was the very essence of their error. The purpose and the
[00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:05.500]   function of the law was rarely, as Paul argues in this seventh chapter of Romans, which we
[00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:12.340]   read at the beginning, to show the exceeding sinfulness of sin. 'Was then that which
[00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:17.500]   is good made death unto me? God forbid, but sin that it might appear, sin working death
[00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:27.780]   in me by that which is good, that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.'
[00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:34.100]   The law was not given in order to save men, or that men might save themselves by it. It
[00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:41.380]   was given, really, for one purpose only, and it was this, that sin might be defined, that
[00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:48.940]   sin, as it were, might have attention focused upon it. Mankind did not realize its sinfulness,
[00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:53.300]   so God gave the law, not that they might save themselves by keeping it, but that their very
[00:18:53.300 --> 00:19:00.380]   sinfulness should be brought out. The law is our schoolmaster to bring us to Christ.
[00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:05.260]   That is its only function, to show us our helplessness, to show us our need of grace
[00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:11.500]   and of a further salvation. It cannot save, by the law, the knowledge of sin. Now those
[00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:18.500]   are the scriptural statements about the law. In other words, I am reminding you that the
[00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:29.580]   great purpose of the law is to teach us this doctrine concerning the sinfulness of sin.
[00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:36.780]   And in every place, wherever it is applied and elaborated, that is exactly what it does.
[00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:42.620]   So all this great biblical teaching about the law is simply to bring out in us a sense
[00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:50.060]   of sin. And therefore it follows, doesn't it, of necessity, that if we have never really
[00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:54.480]   studied this biblical doctrine of the law, if we have never applied it to ourselves,
[00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:59.060]   if we are not doing so constantly, well then we are not aware of our own sinfulness as
[00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:05.180]   we should be. That is what the Fathers meant by a thoroughgoing law work. It is only as
[00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:09.900]   I truly face the law of God that I begin to see what I am. That is the argument again
[00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:14.780]   of the Seventh of Romans. That is one way in which it does it.
[00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:20.220]   Then, of course, coming to the New Testament, you get it in the Sermon on the Mount. The
[00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:25.220]   Sermon on the Mount, in its essence, is an explication and an exposition of God's law.
[00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:32.260]   It is our Lord showing us the real spiritual content of the law, showing its spiritual
[00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:38.540]   nature, denouncing the false interpretation of the Pharisees, and really bringing us to
[00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:47.280]   an end. And why? Well, again, surely the object is this. It is to bring us to see and to realize
[00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:51.460]   our sinfulness. The object of the Sermon on the Mount is to
[00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:59.140]   disabuse all ideas about human self-righteousness. It was an exposure of the Pharisees and scribes
[00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:05.940]   and all who tended to follow them. In a sense, the whole purpose of the Sermon on the Mount
[00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:10.820]   is to bring us into a condition in which we shall be poor in spirit, in which we shall
[00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:17.380]   mourn, in which we shall hunger and thirst after righteousness. That is its object. It
[00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:23.620]   is to bring us into the position and the state of those described by the Beatitudes. In other
[00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:31.140]   words, it is again a realization of our sinfulness. And then you get the same teaching, of course,
[00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:39.560]   in the epistles. That is the meaning of these discussions and arguments about the law. That
[00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:45.020]   is the meaning of the teaching about the old men and the new men and the flesh, and the
[00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:52.180]   law of sin and death, and so on. You find this constantly in the New Testament epistles.
[00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:57.620]   You find it in their exhortations. They are exhortations to the people to examine themselves,
[00:21:57.620 --> 00:22:03.340]   to prove their own selves, to make certain that they are in the faith, to test the spirits,
[00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:09.540]   to avoid the false, to hold fast only to that which is true. All that is really a part of
[00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:18.940]   the teaching concerning sin. Very well then, that is the way in general in which you find
[00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:24.580]   this doctrine about sin presented in the Scriptures.
[00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:30.700]   That leads me to ask my second question. What then, in particular, is this teaching about
[00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:38.280]   sin? If that is the way in which it is presented in general, what does it say in particular?
[00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:42.180]   Now obviously I am dealing with it this morning solely from the standpoint of Christians and
[00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:47.220]   of believers. I should be emphasizing certain other things if I were presenting it to the
[00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:52.220]   unbeliever. I am particularly concerned now about the biblical teaching concerning sin
[00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:58.220]   with regard to God's people. And here there are certain principles which stand out very
[00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:10.060]   clearly. The first is the vital and essential distinction between sin and sins. The trouble
[00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:14.580]   is generally with a false doctrine of sin that it tends to think of sin only in terms
[00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:21.340]   of actions. Now there have been many false schools of teaching about holiness which have
[00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:27.740]   been wrong and false entirely because they have defined sin only in terms of particular
[00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:34.160]   actions. And therefore they have said that as long as we are not guilty of those actions—voluntary,
[00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:40.940]   willful sin—we are perfect and we are entire and fully sanctified. But the Bible draws
[00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:48.540]   this very sharp distinction between particular actions and a sinful state and condition.
[00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:52.980]   And its emphasis is not so much upon what we do as upon the condition which leads us
[00:23:52.980 --> 00:24:00.380]   to do it. That's a broad principle that it lays down everywhere. That it is not merely
[00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:06.940]   the things we do, but it is what we are. Then conversely, you see, by putting it the other
[00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:14.900]   way around, it puts its emphasis upon being rather than doing, in a positive sense. The
[00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:18.900]   true Christian is not so much a man who does certain things as a man who is something,
[00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:27.420]   and because he is, he does. It's being, it's condition, rather than actions.
[00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:36.540]   Another way in which it puts this general principle is that it teaches us that sin primarily
[00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:45.660]   is a wrong attitude towards God and a wrong relationship towards him. Again, you see,
[00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:50.780]   that its way of defining sin is not merely in terms of the moral, ethical character of
[00:24:50.780 --> 00:25:01.260]   the action. No, before that, and in its essence, sin is a wrong relationship to God and a wrong
[00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:10.260]   attitude towards God. So that sin really, defined comprehensively, is anything or everything
[00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:19.740]   that prevents our living only to God and for him and for his glory.
[00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:27.660]   Those who say that sin ultimately means self, are of course perfectly right. They are right
[00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:34.320]   as far as they go, but they don't go far enough. Sin is self, and sin is self-centeredness
[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:39.700]   and selfishness. Yes, but the real trouble about selfishness and self-centeredness is
[00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:48.140]   this. Not so much that I am self-centered as that I am not God-centered. You see, you
[00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:55.420]   can have your philosophical and moral and ethical teachings which will denounce selfishness.
[00:25:55.420 --> 00:26:06.020]   All your idealistic systems, all your programs for utopia, are always very careful to denounce
[00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:11.720]   selfishness and self-centeredness. Obviously, you cannot have a well-ordered society if
[00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:15.980]   everybody is out for himself or herself. There must be give and take. They say you must consider
[00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:20.740]   the other person, and you must put a certain limit upon you of freedom in order that the
[00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:28.020]   other person may enjoy freedom. So, you can denounce self as such, and still be far removed
[00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:36.460]   from the biblical doctrine of sin. Self in all its forms is sinful, says the Bible, because
[00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:44.340]   it puts self where God ought to be. Now, if you start with that definition of sin, you
[00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:48.940]   see how comprehensive it becomes. Take that Pharisee, for instance, who thanked God that
[00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:52.500]   he was not like other people. Up to a point, he was quite honest and truthful in what he
[00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:56.780]   said. He wasn't guilty of certain things, and he did other things. Yes, but he stopped
[00:26:56.780 --> 00:27:03.380]   at that. If he had realized that the essence of sin is to fail to be in the right relationship
[00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:09.060]   to God, or to have the right attitude to God, he would have realized his sinfulness. There
[00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:16.100]   are many Christian people, alas, who are very careful not to commit certain external sins,
[00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:21.260]   but they're not quite so careful about pride, and about self-satisfaction, and about smugness,
[00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:25.660]   and about glibness. They're not quite so careful about rivalry and jealousy within
[00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:30.300]   their own Christian organizations. No, no, they've forgotten all that. Self is in the
[00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:36.180]   ascendant even in their work at times, instead of God. But because they think of sin only
[00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:42.420]   in terms of actions, and have forgotten that it's primarily a relationship to God, they're
[00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:49.780]   not aware of their sinfulness. But that is the very essence of sin, not to live entirely
[00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:56.260]   and wholly to the glory of God. And it matters not how good we may be, nor how much better
[00:27:56.260 --> 00:28:01.700]   we may be than other people. If I am not loving the Lord my God with all my heart, and all
[00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:11.700]   my soul, and all my mind, and all my strength, I am a sinner. All have sinned and come short
[00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:16.460]   of the glory of God. That's the biblical teaching.
[00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:24.740]   And the other great principle concerning it is this, that sin is something which is deep
[00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:31.060]   down in our natures. It isn't something on the surface. It isn't a lack of culture,
[00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:37.800]   a lack of knowledge, a lack of instruction. It isn't something like just a little speck
[00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:43.140]   on the surface, on the skin of an otherwise perfect apple. No, no, it's at the center,
[00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:48.060]   it's in the core. It isn't merely something in the stream. It's in the fountain out
[00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:54.780]   of which the stream comes. It's something which is central in a man's being and life.
[00:28:54.780 --> 00:29:01.300]   Now that is emphasized, as you realize, everywhere in the Scripture. It refers to it as a principle.
[00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:06.660]   That's the whole meaning of the term "the flesh." It doesn't mean the physical body.
[00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:12.700]   It means a principle in a man's life that tends to be controlled. Indeed, the Bible
[00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:19.100]   says that sin is so deep in men that nothing can possibly rid him of it or deliver him
[00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:27.100]   from it except a rebirth. Teaching isn't enough. Exhortation is not enough. Example
[00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:32.180]   is not enough. Even the example of Christ is not enough. In a sense, it damns more than
[00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:38.620]   anything else. "There is only one hope," says the Scripture. "You must be born again.
[00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:45.220]   You must be made and created anew." Sin is so deep down in human nature that man needs
[00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:51.620]   a new nature. Sin indeed is as deep a problem as this, that nothing but the Incarnation
[00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:57.340]   and all our Lord did can possibly deal with it. It's as profound and as deep a problem
[00:29:57.340 --> 00:30:02.340]   as that. And therefore, we have to realize that though we are Christians and have received
[00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:07.460]   the new nature, the problem is still there because of the old nature. We haven't finished
[00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:12.780]   with it. Well, there I suggest to the three main controlling
[00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:21.700]   principles. But still, we must divide that up just a little further. If that is the truth
[00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:29.580]   about sin, how does it rarely show itself? And this seems to be the teaching. First and
[00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:36.420]   foremost, it is what is always described as missing the mark, not being at the place where
[00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:41.900]   you ought to be. You're shooting and you've just missed the mark, or you're traveling
[00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:47.620]   and you don't arrive at the exact destination. Now, that is, of course, of the very essence
[00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:53.540]   of the biblical understanding of sin. It's an absence of righteousness. It's an absence
[00:30:53.540 --> 00:31:00.020]   of holiness. Every sinner is not what he ought to be. We are not as we came out of the hands
[00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:07.440]   of God. We are not reflecting the glory of God as we were meant to do. We are not still
[00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:13.700]   as we were when man was made in God's image. The image has been marred. Something has gone.
[00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:20.140]   There is a failure to be what we are meant to be. You see the importance of regarding
[00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:26.060]   sin in that way? The man who realizes that that is a primary part of the definition of
[00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:30.620]   sin is a man who realizes that he is still a sinner. But if you are simply looking at
[00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:34.980]   drunkards and prostitutes, or simply looking at certain particular actions, of course you
[00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:39.500]   are all right and you are not conscious of sin, and you are not humble, and you don't
[00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:45.700]   – you are self-satisfied and content and you are looking down at other people. But
[00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:52.780]   once you realize that we are meant to be holy and to be righteous, and that we are not that,
[00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:58.020]   then you realize at once that you are a sinner. But it is not only that. It is not merely
[00:31:58.020 --> 00:32:03.740]   this negative condition of not being righteous and holy. It is also actual transgression
[00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:08.620]   of the law. You remember John's argument about that in his first epistle and in the
[00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:14.780]   third chapter. "Sin," he says, "is transgression of the law," breaking the
[00:32:14.780 --> 00:32:23.100]   commandments of God, doing what is wrong. Sin is disobedience. And the Bible emphasizes
[00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:27.420]   this quite as much as the other. Our trouble is not only that we are not what we ought
[00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:35.120]   to be, but that we deliberately are and do things that we should not do. It is a breaking
[00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:42.380]   of the law, a disobedience of the commandment, a transgression, a cutting across what God
[00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:50.860]   has indicated as his holy will. Yes, but it is something even worse than that. It is what
[00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:58.260]   is described as concupiscence. You noticed that word coming in this reading of the seventh
[00:32:58.260 --> 00:33:05.300]   of Romans at the beginning of this morning? And it is something that we must always watch.
[00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:13.340]   "But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence;
[00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:19.580]   for without the law sin was dead." What does this mean? Well, this is the biblical
[00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:29.260]   way of describing desire, evil desire. The trouble with us is not simply that we break
[00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:33.060]   the law and transgress and do things that are wrong. The trouble with us is that we
[00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:37.940]   ever want to do that, that it ever gives us pleasure to do that, that there is ever an
[00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:44.180]   inclination to do that, that there is something in us that makes that appeal to us. That is
[00:33:44.180 --> 00:33:52.180]   partly. But you know it is even worse than that. Concupiscence is as terrible and as
[00:33:52.180 --> 00:34:03.100]   foul a thing as this, that even the law of God inframes it. Did you notice Paul's argument?
[00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:12.300]   He said, "For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sin which were by the law did
[00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:20.300]   work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death. Is then the law sin? God forbid! Nay,
[00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:24.620]   I had not known sin, but by the law; for I had not known lust, except the Lord said,
[00:34:24.620 --> 00:34:30.700]   Thou shalt not covet. But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner
[00:34:30.700 --> 00:34:37.700]   of concupiscence. The commandment which was ordained to life I found to be unto death;
[00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:45.460]   for sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me. Was then that
[00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:51.460]   which is good made death unto me? God forbid! But sin, that it might appear sin, working
[00:34:51.460 --> 00:34:58.500]   death in me by that which is good, that sin by the commandment might become exceedingly
[00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:08.500]   painful." All that means this. There is this terrible thing called concupiscence in men,
[00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:15.740]   and it works in this way. You tell a man, you tell a child, you tell anybody not to
[00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:20.340]   do a thing. Now, that's a good thing to say. It's a good thing to tell people not to do
[00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:24.900]   that which is wrong, and to tell them to do that which is good. "Yes," says Paul, "but
[00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:29.180]   this is what I found." And we've all found the same thing, that the very commandment
[00:35:29.180 --> 00:35:35.140]   which tells me not to do that evil thing, by drawing my attention to me, inflames my
[00:35:35.140 --> 00:35:41.740]   desire to do it, so that the very law of God leads me to sin. "It isn't because the law
[00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:45.940]   isn't right and good and just and holy," says Paul. "God forbid that anybody should
[00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:49.860]   say that." Well, what's the matter? "Oh, it's this awful thing in me called concupiscence.
[00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:56.820]   It'll even turn good into evil. To the pure, all things are pure. But to those that are
[00:35:56.820 --> 00:36:02.980]   not pure, there's nothing pure. That is why, as a Christian, I've never believed in morality
[00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:08.540]   teaching. That is why I've never believed in those who argue, 'Tell people the evil
[00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:13.060]   effects of that sin, and it'll keep them from it.' No, it won't. If they're sinful, it'll
[00:36:13.060 --> 00:36:21.700]   inflame their desire for the very thing that you're telling them not to do." And that is
[00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:30.320]   why people quite often delude and fool themselves in reading books about such things. They say
[00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:34.380]   that what they want to do, of course, is to see the evil of the thing. What is often happening
[00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:40.540]   is that they're rather enjoying it. They're sinning in their minds and in their imaginations.
[00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:47.420]   That's what's meant by concupiscence. This passion, this flame, this fire, and even the
[00:36:47.420 --> 00:36:53.460]   law of God becomes a kind of bellows that makes the flame burst. Tell a man not to,
[00:36:53.460 --> 00:36:59.060]   it may drive him to do it. You're introducing it to him. So it's a dangerous thing with
[00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:06.020]   fallen men to think and to imagine that moral instruction about sex and such things is going
[00:37:06.020 --> 00:37:11.500]   to control the moral problem. It's having the exact opposite effect. And to believe
[00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:18.260]   in that kind of teaching is to misunderstand the essential biblical teaching about sin.
[00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:23.700]   No, our fathers were right. They didn't tell their children about sex and about morality
[00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:29.660]   and such things, and there was less immorality than there is now. It's a dangerous thing.
[00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:37.220]   To talk about these things, it's like pouring pepper onto fire. Concupiscence. That's the
[00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:40.420]   great argument of the Seventh of Romans.
[00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:48.540]   Finally, I must put it in these words. It shows itself, says Paul, as a kind of law
[00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:55.420]   in my life and in my members. Do you notice him talking about the law in his members?
[00:37:55.420 --> 00:38:01.980]   I delight in the law of God after the inward men, but I see another law in my members,
[00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:06.940]   warring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which
[00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:12.700]   is in my members. You see, that's sin. You see, it's a terrible power. It's a great
[00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:20.860]   principle. It's a veritable law, says Paul, and it works in this way. Even though we may
[00:38:20.860 --> 00:38:26.340]   know that the law of God is right and good and just and holy and believe in it and even
[00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:35.580]   want to keep it, we find that we are doing something else. Why? Well, it's because there
[00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:41.060]   is another law in our members. It's this thing called the flesh. Therefore, he comes
[00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:45.000]   to the conclusion that in me—that is to say, in my flesh, which doesn't mean the
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:51.860]   physical body, it means this principle of sin, this law of sin, this law in the members,
[00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:59.140]   they're all synonymous terms—it's this thing that governs me, so that though I want
[00:38:59.140 --> 00:39:04.860]   to do that and with my mind subscribe to it and love it, I nevertheless find myself doing
[00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:09.860]   the other thing. Well, that is in its essence, as I see it,
[00:39:09.860 --> 00:39:19.280]   the biblical teaching with regard to sin. And we know it's true. Yes, but my friends,
[00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:24.360]   how often do we think about this? How often do we meditate upon it? How often do we search
[00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:28.680]   ourselves and examine ourselves to see how guilty we are of these things? Are we dismissing
[00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:34.400]   these things lightly, brushing them away, not really facing them? The Scriptures exhort
[00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:40.100]   us to face them. That's why it puts the law before us everywhere. We need to be kept down.
[00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:44.640]   We need to be humbled. We need to be convicted of sin.
[00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:50.920]   And it is only as we are that we shall realize the need of sanctification. It is only as
[00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:57.800]   we are we shall fly to Christ and seek his face and seek God. It is only as we are that
[00:39:57.800 --> 00:40:03.480]   we shall thank God that the whole of salvation from beginning to end is God's work and
[00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:10.040]   not ours. It will deliver us out of the superficial, dealing with the problem in terms of actions.
[00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:19.000]   It will enable us to see our true condition as souled under sin, governed by the law of
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:29.720]   sin and death, doomed and condemned and hopeless. And needing that mighty operation of the Spirit
[00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:37.600]   of God, which, blessed be his name, gives us new life and new birth, and then proceeds
[00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:47.240]   by the application of this blessed Word in us and upon us to perfect us until eventually,
[00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:54.000]   because it is his work and his power, we shall stand before him faultless and blameless and
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:41:03.200]   with exceeding joy. God grant us an increasing understanding of the biblical teaching, the
[00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:32.440]   Spirit of God's teaching about sin, that it may drive us to Christ. Amen.

[00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:40.440]   And all we have doth sacrifice,

[00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:55.440]   And all we have doth die.
[00:43:57.440 --> 00:44:17.440]   May we live together for thy sight,
[00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:24.440]   May we live together,
[00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:31.440]   May we live together,
[00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:36.440]   May we live together.

[00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:44.440]   And to present us faultless,

[00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:52.440]   To the only wise God our Saviour,
