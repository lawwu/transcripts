[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980]   If you are careful in areas where the substance is light, then you want
[00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.820]   to be really strong on procedure.
[00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:09.620]   Like if you're going to hire your kids, we want procedure to be really strong.
[00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:10.800]   Well, what would procedure be?
[00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.660]   That's all those technical formalities.
[00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.220]   That's I want an employment contract.
[00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:15.160]   I want an hours log.
[00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.200]   I want a calendar.
[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.860]   I want to know exactly what they're doing.
[00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:19.780]   We want to actually issue a W2.
[00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:21.460]   So we have really strong procedure.
[00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:22.920]   The substance is a little light.
[00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:23.580]   They're your kids.
[00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.840]   We're like a little bit skeptical, but we've got all this proof that actually
[00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:30.020]   we've got some substance there where people tend to go wrong in these types
[00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.200]   of areas is they do neither the substance is light because you know what, it's my
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.640]   kid and I'm just kind of paying them to take out the trash and I would never
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.080]   actually pay whatever, $15,000 a year for someone to take out the trash.
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.320]   And then, Oh, by the way, I have no employment contract, no proof, nothing.
[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.460]   Whereas that might hold in a third party arrangement, right?
[00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.340]   If I hired a random person off the street and paid them 20,000 a year, I may be fine
[00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:52.960]   with not having an employment contract.
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.320]   I may be fine with not having all these technicalities, but because there's no
[00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.720]   related party nature, it doesn't get the same scrutiny.
