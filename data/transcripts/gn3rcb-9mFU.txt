[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.280]   What is the key to effective ministry?
[00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.360]   Just about every Christian wants to be used by God to transform the lives of others.
[00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.660]   So how does God use us?
[00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.120]   How does he make ministry effective in us and through us?
[00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.760]   It's a question Pastor John asked and then answered from scripture in front of an auditorium
[00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:28.640]   full of college students at the Passion Conference 2006 in Nashville.
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:35.160]   His message was titled, "How Our Suffering Glorifies the Greatness of the Grace of God."
[00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.640]   Have a listen.
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:44.360]   The purpose of God in creating the universe is to display the greatness of the glory of
[00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:52.360]   his grace supremely in the suffering of his Son.
[00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.320]   That's yesterday.
[00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:04.520]   Today the summons, "Will you join the Son in displaying the supreme satisfaction of
[00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:10.800]   the glory of grace in joining him on the Calvary road of suffering?"
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:18.140]   Because there's no other way the world is going to see the supreme glory of Christ today
[00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:25.720]   except that we break free from the Disneyland of America and begin to live lifestyles of
[00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:32.280]   missionary sacrifice that looks to the world like our treasure is in heaven and not on
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.280]   the earth.
[00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.180]   It's the only way.
[00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:40.580]   The prosperity gospel will not make anybody praise Jesus.
[00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.880]   It will make people praise prosperity.
[00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.660]   Of course I'll have a Jesus who will give me a car.
[00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:52.580]   Who wouldn't want a Jesus who gives me health, a car, a fine marriage?
[00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.020]   I'll take your Jesus if the payoff is right.
[00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.020]   It's not the way you're going to win your campuses.
[00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:07.580]   Dressing the coolest, driving the coolest, typing on the coolest.
[00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:14.540]   It's not going to get any praise for the suffering Christ.
[00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:24.540]   Paul said, "If there's no resurrection, we are of all men most to be pitied."
[00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.580]   Listen to how he puts the point on his own experience.
[00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:33.380]   He said, "If the dead are not raised, why am I in peril every hour?
[00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:42.420]   I protest, brothers, by my exaltation which I have in Christ, Jesus our Lord.
[00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.300]   I die every day."
[00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.300]   So he says two things.
[00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.740]   "I'm in peril every hour and I die every day."
[00:02:51.740 --> 00:03:01.380]   I choose, I make so many choices to magnify Jesus in hard places, it hurts me every day.
[00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.980]   I would not choose this if it weren't true.
[00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:12.860]   If I couldn't expect a resurrection from the dead where everything would be paid back
[00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:18.740]   to me a thousandfold that I have laid down in the service of Jesus, I wouldn't go this
[00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.740]   way.
[00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.140]   I'm in peril every hour.
[00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.420]   I die every day.
[00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.420]   And I want to ask, "Why, Paul?
[00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.460]   What are you up to?
[00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:39.820]   What's the meaning of this chosen life of risk and suffering?"
[00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.380]   And you need to ask that right now.
[00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:51.940]   Why would I choose to deny myself ordinary, innocent things and take risks with my life
[00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.140]   for the cause of Christ?
[00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.020]   Why would I do that?
[00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.740]   And I want to take you to Colossians 1.
[00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:02.900]   If you have a Bible and you can see it, then you can look at it with me if you'd like.
[00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.020]   I'm going to read Colossians 1.24-29.
[00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:11.100]   Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake.
[00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.860]   He was a very strange man, wasn't he?
[00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:19.300]   I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake.
[00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:27.900]   And in my flesh, his body, I am filling up what is lacking in Christ's afflictions.
[00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:34.420]   For the sake of his body, that is, the church.
[00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:35.420]   Let's just stop there.
[00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:36.420]   That's enough.
[00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.460]   Let's focus on that.
[00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:45.620]   I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, talking to the church, and in my flesh, I
[00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:53.220]   am filling up what is lacking in Christ's afflictions for the sake of his body, that
[00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.380]   is, the church.
[00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.860]   That's almost heresy.
[00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.500]   Almost.
[00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:09.100]   To say in my body, my fallen sinful body, I am completing or filling up what is lacking
[00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:13.540]   in the sufferings of Christ, that's almost heresy.
[00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:21.780]   It would be heresy if he meant the sufferings of Christ lack something in their atoning
[00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.300]   worth.
[00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:28.820]   In the death that he paid for sin, there's not enough there.
[00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:35.420]   I'm going to add the rest so that the world can have an atonement that is sufficient for
[00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:36.580]   their sins.
[00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:38.460]   That's heresy.
[00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.500]   And that's not what he meant.
[00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.020]   What did he mean?
[00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:44.660]   What did he mean when he said, "In my body"?
[00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:53.900]   What would you mean if you walked out of here tomorrow and said, "All right, I am God helping
[00:05:53.900 --> 00:06:01.540]   me, going to fill up what is lacking in the afflictions of Christ on my campus or among
[00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:03.780]   the unreached peoples of the world."
[00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:04.780]   What would you mean?
[00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:07.660]   You really should be able to say that.
[00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:10.100]   I hope you will.
[00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:19.260]   I think what you should mean is not that you add to the atoning merit or value or worth
[00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:27.180]   of the death of Christ, but that you add the extension of that suffering to those for whom
[00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:31.380]   he died in your own body and suffering.
[00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:39.500]   There's a parallel statement to this, Colossians 1:24 in Philippians 2.
[00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:43.220]   The situation is that the Philippian church loves Paul.
[00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:46.900]   Paul is in prison in Rome, hundreds of miles away.
[00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:52.740]   Epaphroditus says, "I am willing to take the offering and the blessing that we as a church
[00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:56.020]   want to show, the love that we have for Paul we want to show."
[00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:59.660]   So Epaphroditus takes whatever it was, we're not told, it could be money, it could be books,
[00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:04.980]   it could be food, whatever, clothing, and he takes it to Rome and he almost dies.
[00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:06.180]   He suffers in doing this.
[00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:11.820]   He suffers in extending the love of the Philippians to Paul.
[00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:19.900]   And then you have this sentence where Paul encourages people to praise such a one as
[00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:26.980]   Epaphroditus, "Because he came close to death for the work of Christ, risking his life to
[00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:31.860]   fill up what is lacking in your service to me."
[00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:33.300]   He said that to the Philippians.
[00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:42.200]   You got almost exactly the same wording in Philippians 2.30 as you do in Colossians 1.24.
[00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:43.860]   Almost exactly the same wording.
[00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:48.660]   "I fill up what is lacking in the sufferings of Christ."
[00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:53.380]   Epaphroditus fills up what is lacking in the service of the Philippians.
[00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:58.320]   Now what was lacking in the service of the Philippians?
[00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:00.140]   Listen to this commentator Marvin Vinson.
[00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:02.460]   I think he gets it exactly right.
[00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:07.380]   He says, "The gift to Paul was a gift of the church as a body.
[00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:09.660]   It was a sacrificial offering of love.
[00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:16.380]   What was lacking was the church's presentation of this offering in person.
[00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:17.760]   This was impossible.
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:23.500]   And Paul represents Epaphroditus as supplying this lack by his affectionate and zealous
[00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:24.500]   ministry."
[00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:29.000]   I think that's exactly what Colossians 1.24 means.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.660]   When Paul says, "I rejoice in my sufferings for you and I fill up what is lacking in the
[00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:42.260]   sufferings of Christ, the afflictions of Christ, in my body, in my flesh," he means Christ
[00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:46.420]   died for millions of people all over the world.
[00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:49.260]   People on your campus, people in the unreached peoples of the world.
[00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:53.460]   Their debt has been paid and they don't know it.
[00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:54.860]   They can't taste it.
[00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:56.100]   They can't feel it.
[00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:57.860]   They can't sing that song.
[00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:00.660]   "I thank you for the cross, my friend.
[00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:02.500]   I thank you for the cross."
[00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:05.540]   There's something missing in this offering.
[00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:08.380]   It's not showing up.
[00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:10.140]   It's not connecting.
[00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:19.220]   There's something lacking in the sufferings, namely the presentation of the sufferings.
[00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:20.220]   Here's the amazing thing.
[00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:22.980]   You might say, "Well, obviously the gospel has to be spread."
[00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:26.060]   It's not obvious what he's saying here.
[00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:30.540]   He's not saying simply the gospel has to be spread.
[00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:41.860]   He is saying it is through my body and my sufferings that the sufferings of Christ arrive
[00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:45.820]   in the unreached peoples of the world, on your campus.
[00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:51.620]   How do the sufferings of Jesus arrive on your campus?
[00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:55.220]   They arrive through your sufferings.
[00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:58.260]   That's the meaning of Colossians 1.24.
[00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:07.220]   "I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, filling up what is lacking in the afflictions
[00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:11.060]   of Christ in my own flesh."
[00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:14.480]   It's an amazing statement.
[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:17.780]   And just think about the history of missions for a moment.
[00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:24.620]   If you have any inkling of how we got to where we are today with 1.3 or 4 billion people
[00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:30.340]   professing faith in Jesus Christ when it started from 12, how did we get there?
[00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:32.580]   You know what the answer is?
[00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:33.860]   Suffering.
[00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:40.400]   There never has been a breakthrough into an unreached place or people without suffering.
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:43.860]   If you're going to be a missionary, mark it down.
[00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:53.300]   Pain, loss of a child, malaria, marital strife, tensions on the team, demonic opposition,
[00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:55.900]   martyrdom, it's going to come.
[00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:59.380]   Don't think it's strange when it comes.
[00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:00.900]   It's the price.
[00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:07.080]   He paid his life for our salvation.
[00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:13.700]   We join him in that suffering to display the nature of it.
[00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:22.060]   How are they going to see how satisfying he is in us if we look like it's the computer
[00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:26.020]   toy that is really satisfying?
[00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:27.420]   The computer toy.
[00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:28.420]   That's amazing.
[00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:34.380]   That was from a sermon preached at a college student conference in 2006, 18 months before
[00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:37.000]   the iPhone was announced.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.180]   So if I can take the liberty to restate that last line, I'd put it like this today.
[00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:47.940]   How are others going to see how satisfying God is in us if we look like the smartphone
[00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:51.500]   is where we're getting satisfied?
[00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:52.580]   That's powerful.
[00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:57.420]   This entire Passion Conference 2006 message is online.
[00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:03.460]   Search for the title, "How Our Suffering Glorifies the Greatness of the Grace of God."

[00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:35.260]   This is a question from a podcast listener named Andrea, and it's a good one.
[00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:36.260]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.180]   We'll see you next time on Friday.
