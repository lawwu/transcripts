[00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.600]   - Santa Claus is coming to town,
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.440]   likely to a shopping mall near you.
[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.200]   And Santa appears a lot this time of year
[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.480]   and in a lot of our listener emails too.
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.480]   In fact, 200 mentions of Santa are in the inbox to date.
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.160]   But it's been a few years since we've last addressed him
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.120]   here on the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.920]   And to do so today, Pastor John joins me over the phone.
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.080]   Pastor John, of course,
[00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.040]   there's a fourth century Greek historical figure
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.040]   named Saint Nicholas.
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.240]   That's not who we're talking about.
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.160]   All of those 200 references to Santa
[00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.360]   are speaking about the mythical, white bearded,
[00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.160]   red suited, reindeer flying Santa, that one.
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.440]   And most recently from a podcast listener named Jill.
[00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.880]   Dear Pastor John, I'm a stay at home mother
[00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.360]   of three small children, five, four, and two.
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.060]   My husband and I grew up as children
[00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.240]   believing Santa Claus to be real.
[00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.160]   And while it was truly magical for those nine years
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.240]   when I found out that it wasn't true,
[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.240]   I remember burying my head and sobbing.
[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.800]   I was not angry at my parents.
[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.880]   I knew they wanted to surprise me
[00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.600]   and make Christmas special.
[00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.700]   However, I was truly disappointed.
[00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.640]   Now, as a mother, I feel torn between scriptures
[00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.040]   like do not lie to one another, Colossians 3, 9,
[00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.420]   and yet still desiring to create something mythical
[00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.640]   and special and magical for my children around Christmas.
[00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.400]   But I fear more emphasis is placed
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.320]   on the bearded man in a suit than Jesus, our savior.
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.000]   My question is, what if my husband feels differently
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.320]   and actually wants to keep the Santa myth alive
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.040]   for our children?
[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.040]   What, Pastor John, should I do?
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.440]   - Well, I see three different issues
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:59.440]   in what Jill is asking, at least if I hear her correctly.
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.400]   And so let me say a word about each one of these.
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.600]   And I'm gonna end on the very question
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.460]   about dealing with her husband.
[00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.920]   But I think there are two other issues besides that one
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.960]   that probably need to be addressed.
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.960]   Number one is that the primary crisis in her own mind
[00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.360]   seems to be, can you preserve the myth and magic
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.800]   of Santa Claus without disobeying the biblical command
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.960]   in Colossians 3, 9 not to lie to one another?
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.760]   And I think the answer to that is really quite simple
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.380]   and straightforward, no, you can't.
[00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.580]   That is, you can't teach your children
[00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.320]   that Santa Claus is real if your intention
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.660]   is to teach them the truth.
[00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.540]   And by real, I mean real the way children think of real,
[00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.700]   not the way sophisticated intellectuals
[00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.100]   would call a myth real or that imagination is real.
[00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.220]   I get that.
[00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:58.260]   It's just not the point.
[00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.460]   The point is, are we misleading the children
[00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:07.060]   in saying to them, is a simple statement of fact,
[00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.700]   Santa Claus lives at the North Pole a fact?
[00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.540]   Santa Claus flies with reindeer, leaves gifts under the tree,
[00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.180]   is served by elves.
[00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.180]   To present this myth as fact is not truthful
[00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.300]   to our children.
[00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.660]   Now, I'm trying to get inside other people's heads
[00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.640]   when they listen to this and ask questions.
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.660]   And so I'm responding here to imaginary questions
[00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:32.820]   that I would ask myself.
[00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.540]   This is different, for example,
[00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.380]   from reading fiction to your children.
[00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.100]   Somebody might say, well, it's not wrong
[00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.660]   to have fiction in your kids' lives,
[00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.460]   like "Chronicles of Narnia" or "Grimm's Fairy Tales."
[00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:50.460]   Those are presented not as real the way breakfast is real
[00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:53.780]   and backyards are real.
[00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.960]   They're made up, just like Jesus made up parables.
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.620]   And the children should know that they're made up
[00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:01.580]   and they should know,
[00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:04.900]   why do parents tell children made up stories?
[00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.220]   'Cause it's a good thing, I think,
[00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.300]   to tell children made up stories.
[00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.700]   There's a reason why Jesus told parables
[00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.860]   and that you have these kinds of things in the Bible.
[00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.860]   Here's another response to a possible objection.
[00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:20.020]   Not being truthful about Santa Claus
[00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:21.940]   or untruthful about Santa Claus
[00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.940]   is different from keeping from small children
[00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.020]   many difficult issues in married life.
[00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.620]   I can imagine somebody saying,
[00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.740]   well, we don't tell our children all the truth
[00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.220]   about what's going on.
[00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.300]   It's not lying when we don't burden our younger children
[00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.540]   with financial hardships or marital squabbles
[00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:45.860]   or difficulties with the in-laws.
[00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.740]   The older they get, the more they should know.
[00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.840]   But when they're very young,
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.820]   not capable of dealing with any of those things,
[00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.840]   we just withhold them.
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.820]   But foisting on our children
[00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.980]   an entire fabricated framework
[00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:07.780]   for understanding Christmas that is not true
[00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.820]   and which they take to be true is totally different
[00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.820]   from helping our children handle as much truth as they can
[00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:17.940]   in an age-appropriate way.
[00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:22.940]   Santa Claus is not a withholding of painful truth
[00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.740]   until the children are old enough to handle it.
[00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:30.740]   Santa Claus is the obscuring of thrilling truth
[00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:33.820]   because we think the real truth
[00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:36.020]   can't compete with Santa Claus
[00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.220]   in the hearts of our children,
[00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.740]   which leads now to the second issue,
[00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.180]   namely that the first issue is not the real issue.
[00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:45.740]   Can you say this without lying?
[00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:50.740]   The first issue was, can Santa Claus myth and magic
[00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:54.020]   be presented and preserved for our children
[00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.340]   as something real without lying?
[00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:57.500]   That's not the issue.
[00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:58.660]   That's just not the issue.
[00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:03.100]   The main issue is, why would a Christian
[00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:05.180]   who has found in Jesus Christ
[00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.500]   the greatest treasure in the world
[00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:12.260]   and who sees in the incarnation and life and death
[00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.540]   and resurrection and reign of Jesus
[00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:19.060]   the most amazing story in the world
[00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:24.020]   and who knows that in this real historical event,
[00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:28.660]   all the truth of myth and magic became reality,
[00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:32.620]   why would such a Christian ever dream
[00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:36.380]   of replacing or obscuring or supplementing
[00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:41.140]   this coming true of every story worth telling
[00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:45.620]   with such a non-gospel, pathetic myth like Santa Claus
[00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:47.900]   whose message is, you better be good.
[00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:49.540]   You better not cry.
[00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:51.900]   I just can't imagine it.
[00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:55.380]   But I regard the effort of Christian parents
[00:06:55.380 --> 00:07:00.380]   to lay the Santa Claus story over the Jesus story
[00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:03.100]   as a failure to be thrilled
[00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:04.900]   with the greatest story in the world
[00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:07.460]   and a failure of imagination
[00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:09.820]   for how to speak about the real story
[00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:12.180]   and show the real story in a way
[00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:14.740]   that helps children share our amazement.
[00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:15.860]   It's a failure.
[00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:19.980]   It's a syncretistic compromise with culture.
[00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:22.460]   Poor Jesus, poor Jesus.
[00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:24.260]   He's invisible.
[00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:25.660]   Santa Claus is not.
[00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:27.980]   You can see him at the mall.
[00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:32.620]   Poor Jesus doesn't make any rounds on a sled in the sky
[00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:34.820]   leaving toys under the tree.
[00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:38.700]   So instead of searching the scriptures for,
[00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:43.300]   why is it a great thing for Jesus to be invisible
[00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:46.340]   and not to be here as it says in John 16, 7,
[00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:48.780]   that it is a great thing that he's not here.
[00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:53.780]   Why is it a great thing that he left the earth
[00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:57.140]   and sent his spirit instead of staying here
[00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:58.580]   or riding on a sled?
[00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:03.580]   Why is his slowness to come back again
[00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:06.460]   at the end of the age in the great second coming
[00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:10.500]   a huge mercy that the children ought to understand?
[00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:12.780]   Second Peter 3, 9.
[00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:15.180]   In other words, I'm dealing with the invisibility
[00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:16.860]   of Jesus here.
[00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:21.580]   And why is it not amazing to parents
[00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:24.900]   that we are representatives on earth?
[00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:27.140]   That's a glorious view of human life.
[00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:29.860]   Second Corinthians 5, 20.
[00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:33.200]   Instead of finding these stupendous answers
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:35.920]   to these questions that children may have,
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:38.100]   finding answers in the Bible,
[00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:42.180]   we replace the most important questions in the world
[00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:43.700]   with an easy distraction.
[00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:44.540]   That's the real issue.
[00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:45.540]   Why would we do that?
[00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:48.320]   Why would we do that?
[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:50.280]   Now, the last issue.
[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:54.960]   Jill wants to know what if she does want to focus
[00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:58.280]   on the glories of the truth of Christ,
[00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:01.280]   but her husband is still stuck
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:05.200]   in the superiority of the Santa substitute.
[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:08.200]   Here's my three suggestions to her.
[00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:12.280]   Number one, talk this through with him in August,
[00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:13.540]   not December.
[00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:15.400]   Now I say that, I know it's too late.
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:20.600]   This is a principle of conflict
[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:23.960]   that Noel and I have found very helpful over the years.
[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:28.560]   Separate principled issue discussions
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:31.920]   from pressured emotional crises
[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:33.960]   in the moment of application.
[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:35.000]   That's number one.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.920]   Number two, spell out the gains, not the losses.
[00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:43.400]   Dropping Santa is gain,
[00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:46.620]   or Christianity is a lie.
[00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:50.220]   If Christ cannot compete with Santa
[00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:51.900]   in the hearts of our kids,
[00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:53.500]   we don't know the real Christ,
[00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:55.740]   or there is no real Christ.
[00:09:55.740 --> 00:10:00.140]   Number three, give your husband concrete ideas
[00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:03.100]   for ways of celebrating Christ's coming
[00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:07.940]   that are just as exciting as the charade of Santa Claus.
[00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:10.380]   And if you need help, my wife wrote a book
[00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:14.020]   called "Treasuring God in Our Traditions"
[00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:16.020]   that describes some of the things we did
[00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:18.420]   over the years for our little kids
[00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:21.900]   when we didn't have Santa Claus,
[00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:24.700]   we didn't have stockings, we didn't even have a tree.
[00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:26.780]   (both laughing)
[00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:28.380]   But you say, "How can you not have a tree?"
[00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:31.660]   Well, there are alternative exciting things to do.
[00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:35.580]   Bottom line, truth is stranger than fiction.
[00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:39.460]   Stranger, more amazing, more thrilling, more durable,
[00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:43.140]   more heart transforming, more Christ honoring,
[00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:45.140]   more soul satisfying.
[00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:47.740]   And your children, get this now,
[00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:52.740]   your children have Christ-shaped empty spaces
[00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:54.660]   in their hearts.
[00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:57.700]   They don't know this.
[00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:00.660]   You must show them.
[00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:02.220]   But it can't be done.
[00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:06.660]   That can't be done with Santa Claus, only Christ.
[00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:07.740]   - Amen.
[00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:10.540]   In fact, all of us have this Christ-shaped empty space
[00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:12.220]   in our hearts, and the promises of Santa
[00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:14.560]   will never fill that space ever.
[00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:15.620]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:17.900]   And Jill, thanks for sending in the question.
[00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:20.580]   You represent many, many listeners out there
[00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:22.580]   who are asking similar questions,
[00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:23.660]   so thanks for sending it in
[00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:26.500]   and being the representative to ask it.
[00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:29.940]   And speaking of Christmas, next time on the podcast,
[00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:33.500]   we're gonna address how to find purpose and meaning
[00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:36.880]   in our Christmas gift giving to others.
[00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:38.740]   Now, of course, all this talk about Christmas
[00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:41.820]   means another year is about to end.
[00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:44.600]   2019 will soon be here.
[00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:47.200]   It's incredible how fast these years go by.
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:49.280]   And as 2018 draws to a close,
[00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:52.080]   we enter a really critical season in our budget cycle
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:54.320]   here at Desiring God.
[00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:57.960]   Get this, nearly 40% of our annual budget
[00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:02.720]   comes to us from donors in the month of December alone.
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:03.840]   40%.
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:06.400]   So this last month of the year is really huge
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:09.560]   for our year-round labors here at DG.
[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:12.840]   And if you are a regular listener to the podcast,
[00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:15.500]   and if you benefit from the resources at Desiring God,
[00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:19.820]   would you consider making a donation before December 31st?
[00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:22.180]   In fact, you can do so right now online.
[00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:26.540]   Go to desiringgod.org/give.
[00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:31.340]   That's desiringgod.org/give.
[00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:34.940]   Thank you for considering it during this really critical
[00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:37.280]   last month of the year for us.
[00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:40.980]   I am a very grateful Tony Reinke,
[00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:43.660]   and we will see you back here on Friday.
[00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:46.240]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:48.820]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:58.820]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
