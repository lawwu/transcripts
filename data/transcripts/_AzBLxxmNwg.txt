[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.480]   I can certainly tell you that there's no reason to believe that smoking cannabis is somehow
[00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:17.340]   better than smoking cigarettes, but the dose seems to be significantly lower.
[00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.680]   In other words, you know, let's consider a person who smokes a pack a day for 20 years.
[00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.360]   We call that a 20 pack year smoker.
[00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:31.120]   Someone who smokes two packs a day for 15 years is a 30 pack year smoker.
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:36.480]   That's a person who's dramatically increased their risk of many cancers, including lung
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.080]   cancer and also their risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease.
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:45.440]   Again, I'm not a, I'm not a THC guy, so I don't, I can't necessarily speak for the habits
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.200]   of people that are smoking marijuana.
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.000]   I can't imagine they're smoking that much.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   Probably not.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   Yeah.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:59.780]   But while on a, on a joint to cigarette basis, they're probably equivalent in terms of harm.
[00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:00.780]   I don't know.
[00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.340]   Let's say a person smokes a joint a day.
[00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.480]   That would be like smoking a cigarette a day.
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.320]   You know, that's a 20th of a pack.
[00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.400]   Again, I don't want to say that there's no downside to that, but it's, it's probably
[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.560]   significantly less.
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.160]   So I don't, I don't think the risk fully tracks.
[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.200]   I think the same is probably true for vaping.
[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.560]   And I want to be clear, like, I don't think vaping is a good idea.
[00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:29.560]   My, my, you know, I, the last time I looked at the data on this, it was surprisingly sparse.
[00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:36.480]   But to me, the only advantage I could see to vaping was if it was the only way a person
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.480]   would stop smoking.
[00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:42.180]   So there was, you know, I sort of looked at it as, it was the, definitely the lesser of
[00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:48.880]   two evils, but the, by far the better scenario was not to do any of these things.
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.400]   If nicotine is what you're after, there are better ways to get nicotine, for example,
[00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.720]   through lozenges and gum and things like that.
[00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.480]   So that you shouldn't be turning to those things to do it.
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.800]   But, but if it was like, if gum is here and cigarettes are here, you know, vaping was
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:03.800]   probably here.
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.280]   But boy, I don't know.
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:12.080]   For those listening, Peter spaced his hands far apart for gum and smoking and put vaping
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.080]   about a third of the way from gum toward smoking.
[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.640]   In other words, vaping isn't good for you, but it's not as bad as smoking.
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.580]   That would be my, that would be my, I mean, do you have a, you've probably looked into
[00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:24.580]   this as well.
[00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:25.580]   What were your reviews on this?
[00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:26.580]   Yeah, we did an episode on nicotine.
[00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.720]   I did an episode on cannabis and you know, that the discussion around cannabis gets a
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.720]   little contentious for reasons that aren't important.
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.280]   It's kind of funny, people, the moment someone starts to confront cannabis as a potential
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.000]   health harm, people say it's not as nearly as bad as alcohol, which is a crazy argument,
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   right?
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.040]   Getting hit by a bus isn't nearly as bad as getting hit by a motorcycle in most cases,
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.800]   but sometimes, you know, so that's just kind of silly.
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.360]   And clearly cannabis has medical applications.
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.360]   Yeah.
[00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.360]   Clearly.
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.920]   And then it becomes an issue of the ratio of THC to CBD, pure CBD forms actually being
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.840]   quite effective for the treatment of certain forms of epilepsy, so-called Charlotte's Web.
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.440]   That's actually what it's called.
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:12.520]   Very high THC containing cannabis clearly predisposes, especially young males to later
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.840]   onset psychosis.
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.240]   Those data are starting to become clear, clear enough to me anyway that people ought to be
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.100]   aware of them at least and maybe make decisions on the basis of those.
[00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:28.980]   When it comes to the smoking versus vaping, it's just very, very apparent that the chemical
[00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:37.440]   constituents of the vape and what people are inhaling are terrible for people and are loaded
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.760]   with carcinogens and a bunch of other stuff, many of which cross the blood brain barrier.
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.360]   So that's what worries me the most, you know, obviously I'm not a clinician, but anytime
[00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.440]   I hear about small molecules, you know, these small inorganic molecules getting across the
[00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.360]   blood brain barrier and then being maintained in neurons for many, many years, I worry because
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.120]   the experiment is ongoing mostly in young people.
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.280]   So anyway, without going too far down that track, I think if people can avoid smoking
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.720]   and vaping, they should.
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.080]   And as you mentioned, there are other delivery devices for nicotine and cannabis, tinctures
[00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:13.680]   and patches and gums and things that, um, edibles that, um, if people choose to use
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:14.680]   those substances.
[00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:15.680]   Yeah.
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:21.400]   I think sometimes people would benefit to, to imagine what the surface area of the lung
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.840]   is, right?
[00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:29.040]   If you took the alveolar air sacs of the lungs and spread them out, you would easily cover
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.200]   a tennis court.
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.200]   Remarkable.
[00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:39.040]   So just think about anytime you inhale something, you are exposing, your body is so adept at
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.040]   absorbing it.
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:45.640]   I mean, we have this unbelievable system for gas exchange that was designed for gas exchange.
[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.640]   And anytime you're putting something else in that wake, you're doing a really good job
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.000]   of getting it into your body.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.800]   So be mindful of what that is.
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.920]   Um, and, and that, look, that applies to, to pollution too.
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:59.020]   I mean, the, the PM 2.5 data is pretty good.
[00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:04.440]   I think once you, so particulates that are less than 2.5 microns are, are getting straight
[00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:09.800]   into the body, um, which is like a great argument for avoiding air pollution, right?
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:15.400]   I mean, I, I, I always find it funny not to get off on this tangent, but to me, the most
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:21.920]   compelling arguments around cleaner energy have nothing to do with greenhouse gases.
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.640]   They have to do with air pollution.
[00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:30.700]   I promise you more people are dying from the particulate matters in air that result from
[00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:36.980]   burning coal than are ever going to die from the CO2 emissions that result from that.
[00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:39.600]   It's not, it's, and I would argue that's going to be two orders of magnitude.
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:40.980]   It's not even in the same zip code.
[00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:42.260]   That makes sense.
[00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:46.420]   During the fires, which seemed to follow me, uh, because when I was in Northern California,
[00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:50.860]   there were a bunch of fires and we were constantly looking, I mean, wake up in the morning, everything
[00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:52.020]   was covered with ash.
[00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:53.920]   Um, my dog was having trouble breathing.
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.180]   I was having trouble breathing.
[00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:56.180]   Everyone was suffering.
[00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:00.860]   Uh, but there are websites that one can go, you can just look at air pollution and we
[00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.260]   tend to only do this during fires.
[00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.420]   And then, um, you know, when I'm in Southern California, there tend to be fires here.
[00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:10.940]   So, um, you know, it's correlation, not causation, but, um, for sure I didn't set those fires
[00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:11.940]   folks.
[00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:15.940]   But it's clear that it disrupts your breathing for a very long period of time.
[00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:19.140]   But it's the long tail of that, that we're really talking about here, the very small
[00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:24.020]   particulate that we know firefighters for instance, and certain, um, industrial workers
[00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:27.660]   can end up with that stuff embedded in their brain tissue for extremely long periods.
[00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:28.900]   It's just not good.
[00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:30.660]   Um, you make a really interesting point.
