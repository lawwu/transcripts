[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.600]   - This week, Randy Elkhorn joins us on the phone.
[00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.440]   He's the author of the new book, Happiness,
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.900]   and we are talking about happiness all week
[00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.080]   on the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:19.040]   And Randy, what is the relationship between spiritual joy
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.920]   and the joy of God honoring parties and feasts?
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.880]   How should we think about spiritual joys
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.640]   and the enjoyment of great food and friends?
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.000]   - Well, it's amazing when you look at scripture
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.040]   and you see all these passages in the Old Testament
[00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.560]   about the parties, the feasts,
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:39.520]   and that's what feasts were.
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:40.360]   They were parties.
[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.540]   They would involve often sacrifices,
[00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.280]   but most of the time was spent eating and drinking
[00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.000]   and basically having fun and taking time off.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.960]   You see in Leviticus 23, God says,
[00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.720]   "You shall take on the first day
[00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.060]   "the fruit of splendid trees, branches of palm trees,
[00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.520]   "boughs of leafy trees, willows of the brook,
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.040]   "and you shall rejoice before the Lord your God
[00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.760]   "for seven days."
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.760]   I mean, this is a seven-day party of rejoicing in God.
[00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.760]   And the Old Testament is full of God-ordained celebrations
[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.600]   for the Israelites.
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.660]   In fact, there were seven different holidays
[00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.920]   built into Israel's calendar,
[00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.040]   and they added up to about 30 days per year.
[00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.800]   But when you add the weekly Sabbaths
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.800]   and then you add the days of feasting and rest
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.400]   and later feasts of Purim and Hanukkah
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.640]   and weddings and birth celebrations
[00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.200]   and all of this kind of stuff,
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.120]   the amount of time taken off exceeded three months annually.
[00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.080]   And you look at Deuteronomy 14.
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.440]   This is a passage that I just was so struck with.
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.900]   In verses 24 to 26 in the ESV, it says,
[00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.860]   "If the way is too long for you
[00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.900]   "so that you are not able to carry the tithe,
[00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.500]   "when the Lord your God blesses you,
[00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.780]   "then you shall turn it into money
[00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.460]   "and bind up the money in your hand
[00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.920]   "and go to the place that the Lord your God chooses
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.120]   "and spend the money for whatever you desire,
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.520]   "oxen or sheep or wine or strong drink,
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.120]   "whatever your appetite craves.
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.800]   "And you shall eat there before the Lord your God
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.200]   "and rejoice."
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.560]   And what strikes me, first of all, is the language.
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.920]   You talk about hedonism.
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.800]   I mean, this is a God-directed,
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.240]   he does whatever your appetite craves.
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.280]   Get the best of whatever you want to eat and drink,
[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.100]   wine, strong drink, and you shall eat there
[00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.760]   before the Lord your God and rejoice.
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.960]   And I love that it says, "Before the Lord your God."
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.720]   Happiness and joy are not things
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.060]   we're to experience behind God's back.
[00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.760]   As if that were possible, which of course it's not.
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.360]   But he calls upon them, "Do it all before me
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.920]   "and I am, by implication, I'm gonna be there with you.
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.760]   "I'm going to enjoy it with you."
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.160]   And so when you're partying, I'll be partying with you.
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.840]   And think about the rejoicing that takes place
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.600]   in the presence of the angels of God
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.520]   that Jesus speaks of twice in Luke 15.
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.620]   And who's in the presence of the angels?
[00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.500]   Well, God's in the presence of the angels.
[00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.620]   God's people are in the presence of the angels.
[00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.580]   And of course, the angels themselves are there.
[00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.620]   But all heaven is throwing a party.
[00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.260]   All heaven is rejoicing over conversions on earth.
[00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.140]   And these are things that we are to celebrate.
[00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.860]   In 2 Chronicles 30, it talks about the people of Israel
[00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.220]   kept the feast of unloved bread for seven days
[00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.940]   with great gladness.
[00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.700]   And the words gladness and the various Hebrew words,
[00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.060]   numbers of them are used in all of these
[00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.980]   Old Testament celebrations.
[00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.260]   And you know, Tony, one of the things I really believe
[00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.140]   is that if people looked at the church
[00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.700]   less as a group of always critical, always complaining,
[00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.940]   always feeling persecuted, really bunch of curmudgeons,
[00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.700]   which sometimes we can project that image to the world,
[00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:22.060]   no doubt, and we can also project it even to our children.
[00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.820]   Growing up in Christian homes,
[00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.980]   they hear what mom and dad are saying
[00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.260]   and the critical spirit and the complaining
[00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.140]   and the ingratitude and all that sort of thing.
[00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.780]   But what if we as believers were known
[00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.380]   as the place of celebration and gladness,
[00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.260]   the place of feasting?
[00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.140]   And the New Testament, it wasn't just Old Testament,
[00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.540]   the New Testament church, the Lord's Supper,
[00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.200]   the love feast, you know.
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:51.940]   Now we've got the cracker and the juice, you know,
[00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.140]   and it's fine symbolically,
[00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.460]   but we really need to have feasts.
[00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.320]   And what if the world looked at us?
[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.500]   What if we led the way in celebrating the United Nations?
[00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.980]   It was a unanimous vote, 192 countries several years ago,
[00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.060]   appointed March 20th
[00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.740]   as the International Day of Happiness.
[00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.620]   What if the church celebrated
[00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.580]   the International Day of Happiness
[00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.300]   by celebrating the good news of happiness
[00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.560]   that Isaiah 52.7 talks about?
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.660]   - Yes, more feasts in either case.
[00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:26.580]   Thank you, Randy.
[00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:29.060]   And in our circles, we like to say
[00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:30.900]   that external circumstances of life
[00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.460]   do not determine our happiness.
[00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.820]   This is helpful for those who are suffering.
[00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.340]   And it's an important pushback to our world
[00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.620]   that says outward circumstances in life
[00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.980]   are essential for true happiness.
[00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:44.680]   That's just, it's false.
[00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.340]   But it also seems disingenuous to say
[00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:51.600]   that outward circumstances play no role
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.460]   in God-glorifying happiness.
[00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.980]   So how do we talk about joy in God
[00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:00.660]   in God-glorifying circumstances in our lives?
[00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.240]   - Well, I think, first of all,
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.420]   we see Paul rejoicing over circumstances.
[00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:11.420]   And the Greek verb kairo and the noun form kara
[00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:15.860]   that are translated rejoicing and joy,
[00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:17.900]   those words are associated with Paul
[00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:22.580]   when he finds out that Epaphroditus,
[00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:25.660]   who these people were very deeply concerned about,
[00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:28.340]   is better now and he came close to death,
[00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:32.260]   but now we're rejoicing that he's well.
[00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:33.660]   Well, that's a circumstance.
[00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:36.180]   That's a good friend was in trouble.
[00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:39.260]   And now he's okay and you're rejoicing in that.
[00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.140]   And it's fine to rejoice in circumstances.
[00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:45.380]   If you get a raise, great, rejoice, be happy.
[00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:48.040]   That's circumstantial, but at the same time,
[00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.160]   it's a blessing of God.
[00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.400]   Many of God's common graces are circumstantial.
[00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:57.400]   However, we cannot rest our ultimate joy and happiness
[00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:00.340]   upon the circumstances in our lives.
[00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:02.460]   And I remember as a young Christian,
[00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:07.460]   when I was a teenager reading Richard Wurmbrand's
[00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:11.540]   Torture for Christ and Corrie Ten Boom's Hiding Place
[00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:14.060]   and Brother Andrew's God Smuggler
[00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:17.020]   and all of these great stories of people
[00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:22.020]   in huge tribulation, I mean, going through horrific things,
[00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:27.980]   yet in the midst of them, experiencing a transcendent joy,
[00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:33.900]   happiness, gladness, delight, pleasure in God.
[00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:36.660]   And I think one of the things that we need to do
[00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:41.140]   is to remind ourselves of our true circumstances.
[00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:42.780]   Usually when we think of circumstances,
[00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:44.620]   we're almost kind of dismissive about it.
[00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:48.460]   Well, it's just like, okay, if things are going well,
[00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:51.740]   well, Scripture says give thanks in all circumstances.
[00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:55.100]   In 1 Thessalonians 5, 18, and Paul says,
[00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:57.780]   "I have learned in whatever situation I am in
[00:07:57.780 --> 00:07:59.340]   "to be content.
[00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:01.020]   "I know how to be brought low.
[00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:04.000]   "I know how to abound in any and every circumstances.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.460]   "I've learned the secret of facing plenty
[00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:08.400]   "and hunger, abundance and need.
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:11.340]   "I can do all things through Him who strengthens me."
[00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:13.620]   But I also think we need to focus on
[00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:16.260]   what I would call our true circumstances,
[00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.940]   which is not all circumstances are visible.
[00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:23.700]   We are created by a good and happy God.
[00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:25.020]   We're created in His image.
[00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:26.780]   He gave us the capacity to be happy.
[00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:29.900]   If you just took Romans 8 alone,
[00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:30.820]   I mean, think of verse one,
[00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:32.780]   "There is therefore no condemnation
[00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:34.740]   "for those who are in Christ Jesus."
[00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:36.820]   And verse two, "In Jesus I've been set free
[00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:40.060]   "from sin and death, and God sent His Son to save me."
[00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:43.260]   And verse six, "I can set my mind on the Spirit,
[00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:44.980]   "and that's life and peace."
[00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:48.780]   And verse 11, "God's Spirit indwells and empowers me."
[00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:51.540]   And verse 15, "God's adopted me,
[00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:54.860]   "and I can call Him Abba, Father."
[00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:57.660]   Verse 16, "I'm an heir of God, fellow heir with Christ."
[00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:00.660]   Verse 18, "The sufferings of this present time
[00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:02.700]   "are worthy to be compared with the glory
[00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:04.460]   "that's to be revealed in us."
[00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:08.860]   The creation will be delivered
[00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:11.260]   to the freedom and glory of God's children.
[00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.820]   The world itself, the universe itself
[00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:16.620]   will be ultimately redeemed.
[00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:18.340]   The redemption of our bodies,
[00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:21.220]   the Spirit prays for us in our weakness.
[00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:24.140]   Christ Himself intercedes for us.
[00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:25.420]   They indwell us.
[00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:30.140]   We have been called to a life in which God promises
[00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:34.140]   that He will cause all things to work together for our good.
[00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:36.340]   We're more than conquerors through Him who loved us,
[00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:37.700]   God who gave us His Son.
[00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:39.020]   How much more will He give us?
[00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:41.940]   And then finally, to top it all off,
[00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:45.100]   nothing shall separate us from the love of Christ.
[00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:48.100]   Well, those are the true circumstances
[00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:49.020]   of the Christian life.
[00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:52.100]   Let's meditate on those circumstances
[00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:57.100]   which are a true ground for eternal and present happiness.
[00:09:57.100 --> 00:10:00.100]   - Yes, what a magnificent chapter.
[00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:01.180]   Romans chapter eight,
[00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:03.940]   the true circumstances of the Christian life.
[00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:04.940]   Randy Alcorn, thank you.
[00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:06.780]   We're talking about Randy's new book, "Happiness,"
[00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:08.460]   and tomorrow we're gonna end our week
[00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:11.500]   and I'll ask Randy about joy in heaven.
[00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:13.940]   Randy is the author of the bestselling book, "Heaven,"
[00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:15.820]   and now he's the author of a great new book
[00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:16.820]   titled "Happiness."
[00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:19.860]   So what will our happiness look like in heaven?
[00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:20.820]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:22.060]   We'll find out tomorrow.
[00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:24.640]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:27.220]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:37.220]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
