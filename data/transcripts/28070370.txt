[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (gentle music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.000]   - Welcome friends to this episode
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.720]   of the Everyday Educator podcast.
[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.560]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey,
[00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:15.120]   and I am excited to spend some time with you today
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.880]   as we encourage one another, learn together,
[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.880]   and ponder the delights and challenges
[00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.360]   that make homeschooling the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.560]   Whether you're just considering
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.560]   this homeschooling possibility
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.880]   or deep into the daily delight of family learning,
[00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.080]   I believe you'll enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.640]   But don't forget,
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.520]   although this online community is awesome,
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.520]   you'll find even closer support in a local CC community.
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.780]   So go to classicalconversations.com
[00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.600]   and find a community near you today.
[00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.600]   Well, listeners, I have a treat for you,
[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.800]   and actually it's a treat for me too.
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.300]   I have with me today, Amy Jones.
[00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.300]   Amy and I talked several weeks ago about finding wonder,
[00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.880]   especially as we begin this new school year
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.440]   with our children at home.
[00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.720]   How can we do more to find wonder
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.800]   in the world that God has given us?
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.700]   And how can we bring that wonder into our families
[00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.840]   and into our schooling?
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.640]   And Amy and I didn't get finished talking.
[00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.480]   So I invited Amy to come back today,
[00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:42.000]   and we are gonna talk about finding wonder.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   And so I put out the podcast as putting on your wonder hat,
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.120]   because that's something that Amy encouraged me to do
[00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.640]   as we prepared to talk together again.
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.440]   This is just gonna be an hour of encouraging you.
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.680]   And specifically, we are, as we go,
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.680]   gonna look at how do we find wonder
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.840]   with our youngest children?
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.000]   And we're gonna talk to you a little bit
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.960]   about how you could use the Scribblers resource,
[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.200]   the brand new Scribblers at Home recipes
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.880]   from Lifelong Learners resource,
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.680]   not just with your littlest learners,
[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.180]   but with your whole family.
[00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.180]   And it can be a real tool for finding wonder in your day.
[00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.820]   So Amy, thank you so much for agreeing
[00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.280]   to talk with me about this again.
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.120]   - Oh, thanks, Lisa.
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.700]   This is one of the most delightful things I do for my day,
[00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.840]   is to contemplate wonder.
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.640]   - And you're so good at it.
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.640]   Every time I talk to you about how to find wonder,
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.960]   for our families and our homeschooling journey,
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.480]   what I discover, Amy, I'll be really honest,
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.480]   is a new way that God is calling me, Grandma,
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:12.200]   to find wonder in my everyday world
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.140]   so that I can connect with Him.
[00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:19.140]   And so moms and dads who are listening to this podcast,
[00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:24.040]   we're not encouraging you to find wonder just
[00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.600]   so you can show it to your children,
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:35.100]   so that you can find wonder that ministers to your soul,
[00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:40.900]   that draws you back into deep fellowship with the Lord.
[00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:46.560]   So hey, maybe it'll be just kind of like a revival
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.560]   for all of us today as we explore this.
[00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.280]   I wanna ask you first though, Amy,
[00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:58.440]   how can we encourage wonder in our families?
[00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.600]   What can we do every day to chase the wonder?
[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.920]   - Oh, that's such a great question.
[00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.920]   I really love the way the Scribblers lays out
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.240]   that play, pray, read, explore, serve,
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.200]   because it's not just for, it's just like you said,
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.200]   it's not just for our children,
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:25.200]   that the rhythm of our day and recognizing in that rhythm
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:30.760]   God's presence and having that awareness,
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.520]   I was just reminded that the scriptures,
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.340]   like the Psalm about the heavens declaring the glory of God
[00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:43.340]   and Romans telling us that He reveals His divine nature
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.520]   and eternal power and through the creation.
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.320]   Those texts were written for adults.
[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.600]   They weren't written for little children to discover.
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.080]   They're written for us because God knows
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:02.080]   that we respond to beauty and that beauty and wonder
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.480]   draws us into relationship with Him.
[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:10.480]   So I would say that the way that we can incorporate wonder
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.400]   is the awareness of God's presence
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.080]   and how He reveals Himself.
[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.400]   And I know the natural world is a calling card,
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.840]   that's really, we walk outside and He's,
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.560]   the beauty of His world wherever we are
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.840]   just reminds us of Himself,
[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:34.840]   but also just in the everyday rhythms of our home
[00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:40.040]   as we incorporate praying and even the idea
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:45.040]   of playing, of just being open to God's presence in our home.
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:50.080]   And I think it really does start with where our minds go.
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:55.720]   If they, if Philippians tells us to think on these things
[00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:00.120]   and they're not things like worry or prayer,
[00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.880]   they're things that are lovely and praiseworthy.
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:07.520]   And I think just having that, beginning that habit
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.640]   of drawing my mind to a higher thing,
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:14.120]   to recognizing God's presence,
[00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:18.120]   that's one of those rhythms that we can incorporate.
[00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:23.120]   And I think that we, in scribblers, it describes,
[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.640]   let's pray every day, play every day, read every day,
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:29.040]   explore every day, serve every day,
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:33.360]   that I guarantee that if we as adults
[00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.480]   incorporate those things,
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:38.520]   that it would open us up to an understanding of God
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:42.680]   that we don't really experience in my head down,
[00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.720]   get to the next thing sort of day.
[00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:49.440]   So I think it's just, for me, it's a real attitude,
[00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.920]   an intentional attitude of the heart.
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:55.120]   And it's also incorporating rhythms in my day
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:57.200]   that are kind of reminders,
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.320]   like a little tap on the shoulder of God is here,
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:03.380]   God is present here and look for Him.
[00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:06.320]   - I love what you just said,
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:10.680]   because I think it speaks to how we all homeschool,
[00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.700]   especially at the beginning of a year,
[00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:16.360]   that we have so much on our plate
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:20.440]   and so many good things on our list of to-dos
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.880]   that we start every day, hit the ground running,
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:26.320]   and we're just moving from thing to thing.
[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:30.200]   And in our mind, that is a good thing
[00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:33.580]   because we are cramming so much good stuff
[00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:34.980]   into every day.
[00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:41.120]   But your call to us
[00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:46.760]   to maybe change our rhythm
[00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:49.360]   to a more restful rhythm.
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:54.480]   I wrote down plan rest into your day.
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:58.520]   So maybe get your list of all these things
[00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:03.520]   and take, I don't know, 50% of it off the table
[00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:07.940]   so that you can develop a rhythm
[00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:12.620]   that is governed by smaller principles.
[00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:17.620]   Like the scribblers pray, play,
[00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:21.440]   read, explore, and serve,
[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:26.420]   things that allow you to slow down
[00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:30.660]   and develop a more restful attitude
[00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:34.500]   so that you have time to look around
[00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:38.400]   and see what it is that God has brought
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:41.120]   into your orbit today,
[00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:45.600]   instead of blowing past 10 good things
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:48.960]   to get to the good thing that you put on your list.
[00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:52.800]   I wonder, I was gonna ask you
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:57.200]   if you think there are any prerequisites
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:01.240]   for finding wonder, because I thought of one
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:04.980]   that I might write down, but I wanted to ask you,
[00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:07.920]   do you think there are any prerequisites
[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:10.360]   for us to finding wonder?
[00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:15.360]   Oh yeah, I do, because I think it's our anticipation
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:17.700]   that God is present, that He's here.
[00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:22.700]   I think recognizing that, wow, God is present with me
[00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:25.940]   and He has something for me today.
[00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:29.700]   And what I recognize about in our relationship with God
[00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:33.540]   is that He always treats me like a human being.
[00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:36.500]   He doesn't treat me like a human doing.
[00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:38.620]   He doesn't give me those lists.
[00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:40.980]   He really calls to rest,
[00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:44.360]   and that really is an act of faith, Lisa, isn't it?
[00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:47.220]   We have to kind of turn our back
[00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:52.220]   on the way the world measures, or even success,
[00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:58.300]   or the way the world expresses value.
[00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:02.020]   It does kind of express the value of being a human.
[00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:06.560]   It expresses value of always the outcome.
[00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:11.560]   There's this franticness of activity
[00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:16.780]   that supposedly brings about a meaning in your life,
[00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:19.200]   and some people measure their life
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:21.540]   by how frantically busy they are.
[00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:25.020]   They must be accomplishing things, and that's very worldly.
[00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:29.760]   And with the Lord, He says, "Wait on me, wait.
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:33.820]   "Be still, acknowledge me, and rest."
[00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:35.620]   And that's a real act of faith.
[00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:39.140]   But a prerequisite to me is just a natural curiosity
[00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:43.740]   of the world and a willingness to poke around and ask,
[00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:46.380]   what, why, how does that work? (laughs)
[00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:50.300]   - Yes, yes, that is a great prerequisite.
[00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:55.300]   I was thinking that one of the prerequisites to wonder
[00:10:55.300 --> 00:11:00.780]   is allowing yourself and your family time to contemplate.
[00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:02.980]   It's just being still.
[00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:05.500]   Because when you're not still, like you said,
[00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:09.740]   when you're just rushing and on to the next thing,
[00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:12.540]   you're not being still enough,
[00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:16.960]   you're not waiting for God to show you something.
[00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:23.140]   So I would agree that the prerequisites for finding wonder
[00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:27.740]   are being still and being curious.
[00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:30.020]   I like that, I like that a lot.
[00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:31.660]   So let me ask you this, I do wanna,
[00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:35.740]   we are going to dive into a Scribbler activity
[00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:40.740]   and look specifically at how that will take us
[00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:45.300]   as families toward finding wonder.
[00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:48.260]   But I wanted to ask you, we talk so much
[00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.780]   in classical conversations about the value
[00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:55.780]   of a classical Christian community
[00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:59.900]   that I wanted to ask you about those attributes.
[00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:04.900]   How does a classical education promote wonder?
[00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:08.900]   - Oh yes, I feel like I've learned so much
[00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:11.220]   from being in classical conversations.
[00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:14.780]   It's just sort of opened my understanding
[00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:17.780]   to the beauty of classical education,
[00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:20.300]   even though we know it's not, quote, Christian,
[00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:25.300]   but it very much is a natural reflection of humanness.
[00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:30.500]   And I think those questions, Lisa,
[00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:34.700]   are probably the tools, those classical tools
[00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:38.500]   of those five common topics and those core habits
[00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:40.980]   of grammar, and they're in the Scribbler's Guide,
[00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:44.360]   so you're right there, they're in the catalog,
[00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:45.820]   they're so available.
[00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:50.660]   But I find that wonder starts with questions,
[00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:53.840]   but not just any question.
[00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:57.020]   I feel like what the classical education does
[00:12:57.020 --> 00:13:01.260]   is it gives us good questions to ask.
[00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.980]   That's where those tools come in.
[00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:06.980]   So when you're asking even simple questions
[00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:10.540]   like what do you see, what do you hear,
[00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:13.460]   just helping them recognize, our children recognize,
[00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:17.940]   wait, that requires stopping and achieving.
[00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:22.420]   And then incorporating that into what's the definite,
[00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:25.100]   what is this thing, what is it not?
[00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:27.340]   I remember reading that for the first time
[00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:28.980]   and thinking that is brilliant,
[00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:33.580]   because so many things we define in those terms,
[00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:37.900]   this is what a flower is, it's not a tree,
[00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:40.440]   and that we naturally move to comparison.
[00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:45.440]   And those tools, those classical tools give us ways
[00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:52.040]   of looking at the world and helping us discern
[00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:53.700]   how to learn about the world.
[00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:58.500]   It's like a connector of questions to me
[00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:02.860]   help guide my thinking, but they also help guide
[00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:05.800]   my children's thinking, where it's not just random
[00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:09.200]   and they're never yes and no answered questions,
[00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:12.420]   they're probing, they're probing questions.
[00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:15.200]   And I just, I love that.
[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:20.200]   It really has been, for my life with CC,
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:24.660]   it has been phenomenal in the way I think.
[00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:28.020]   It's just, it's a form that I can follow
[00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:33.020]   that helps me begin to understand something
[00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:37.540]   that I didn't know before, and it helps my children.
[00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:42.400]   I'm not fumbling around, so that is probably
[00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:44.660]   the most helpful that I've found.
[00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:48.880]   - I love it, I love the whole, the classical model
[00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:53.880]   of grammar, dialectic, and rhetoric is so beautiful.
[00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:56.800]   And you think, well, what does that have to do with wonder?
[00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:59.940]   I think what you said, asking all those good questions,
[00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:04.940]   what do you see, what do you hear, what is this thing,
[00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:09.820]   what is this thing not, is it like, what's it like,
[00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:14.820]   what is it, how is it different, all those good grammar,
[00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:18.300]   those are good, building the knowledge,
[00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:21.020]   building the knowledge of that thing
[00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:26.020]   allows us to just kind of explore the ooh,
[00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:30.900]   that's so cool aspect of it, but then the dialectic,
[00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:33.900]   where you're asked, where you are comparing it,
[00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:35.980]   and you are seeing what it will do,
[00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:38.380]   and what it doesn't do, and how does it behave,
[00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:42.620]   and where did I find it, and putting all those pieces
[00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:47.060]   together, the dialectic that is designed to help us
[00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:52.060]   think more deeply about that thing is awesome,
[00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:55.060]   but then the rhetoric, to me,
[00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:57.060]   is where the celebration comes in.
[00:15:57.060 --> 00:16:00.780]   It's like, wow, God has revealed this to me,
[00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:04.660]   and I have explored it, and I have actually come
[00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:06.660]   to understand God a little bit more,
[00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:11.220]   or realize that I'll never understand God all the way,
[00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:14.580]   and isn't that amazing, but just to celebrate.
[00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:17.860]   So for me, that classical model of grammar,
[00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:21.940]   dialectic, and rhetoric really does promote wonder,
[00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:25.460]   and the best part is that celebration of wow,
[00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:30.260]   we serve an amazing God who clearly was way more creative
[00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:34.460]   than I'll ever be, and who gave us a world of light,
[00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:37.780]   and color, and beauty, when it could all
[00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:41.980]   have just been functional, and grayscale.
[00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:43.940]   You know, that really promotes wonder.
[00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:45.060]   Well, let me ask you this.
[00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:49.340]   How does a Christian education promote wonder?
[00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:54.340]   - Oh, you know, it's what it's all about.
[00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:59.140]   It's just what you said, that at every turn,
[00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:04.140]   God uses his creation to point to even greater majesty
[00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:05.780]   of himself.
[00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:10.580]   Every work brings us into worship.
[00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:16.500]   I find that if I, even simple things like going outside,
[00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:20.580]   and look, the moon right now has just been so beautiful.
[00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:22.420]   - Oh, yes, yes!
[00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:24.740]   - And I look at that, and I think, the Lord,
[00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:28.820]   you made this rhythm of these, you know,
[00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:32.860]   it's full, it's new, and it marks time,
[00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:36.060]   and it's a mystery to me still.
[00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:41.060]   And yet, you put that in the sky for me to think about.
[00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:46.660]   It reminds me of his sovereignty over creation,
[00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:49.860]   his trustworthiness, his faithfulness.
[00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:53.060]   It's never, we're never gonna go outside,
[00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:55.900]   and the moon just disappears today,
[00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:57.820]   and it's gonna go up to mark.
[00:17:57.820 --> 00:17:58.940]   It's never like that.
[00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:01.900]   He gives us that security of our world,
[00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:06.140]   of that predictability as a reflection of his faithfulness.
[00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:10.740]   I, it just, it always brings me to higher thoughts
[00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:12.380]   about him.
[00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:17.380]   - I think it is so cool that God uses the beauty
[00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:20.420]   of creation to woo us.
[00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:23.900]   He is using it to woo us, and for our children,
[00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:25.940]   when they see how beautiful it is,
[00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:30.260]   or how tiny something is, or how complex it is,
[00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:33.780]   it woos them, and we can lead them to think
[00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:36.540]   how great a God we serve.
[00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:39.500]   It woos us into relationship.
[00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:42.660]   - Exactly, that's a beautiful way to put it, yes.
[00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:46.580]   - I just think that's the coolest.
[00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:50.860]   And you know, the only way that we'll ever see
[00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:57.140]   what was intended by the world
[00:18:57.140 --> 00:19:00.260]   is to get to know the author.
[00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:04.340]   I mean, the author, the creator is the only one
[00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:07.300]   who knows what he intended,
[00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:10.180]   what message he intended to send
[00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:12.300]   when he created this world.
[00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:15.500]   And so the only way for us to get to the bottom
[00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:19.020]   of our curiosity is to get to know the Lord.
[00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:22.740]   And so it's such a great circle where he woos us
[00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:25.820]   because he loves us, because he wants us to know him.
[00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:27.340]   - It's remarkable.
[00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:30.140]   I mean, it's so humbling, isn't it?
[00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:34.700]   It's just the thing, no one will ever pursue me that way.
[00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:37.300]   And as much as others love me,
[00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:40.900]   they will never pursue me in love that way.
[00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:45.740]   It is, yeah, it's beyond me.
[00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:49.860]   - I think that that's a beautiful thing
[00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:52.500]   to transmit to our children,
[00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:55.580]   how deeply God loves you
[00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:59.620]   and how much he wants you to know him.
[00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:01.940]   So let me ask you this,
[00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:06.940]   how does or how might community promote wonder?
[00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:09.660]   - Oh, that's a great question.
[00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:14.580]   I think that if in my own CC community,
[00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:20.300]   I believe that because there's this gaggle of people
[00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:23.180]   that are like-minded and we all love the Lord
[00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:26.220]   in our own ways, that just rubbing shoulders
[00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:29.060]   with people who are different and have different wonders.
[00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:35.020]   And I think that that just expands my understanding of God.
[00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:40.180]   Someone, we had a director who just was phenomenal
[00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:42.580]   at understanding geography.
[00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:45.300]   And she just, I would just look at rocks.
[00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:48.460]   I mean, I'm confessing here and go, "That's a rock."
[00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:52.820]   - Yeah, it's brown, it's another brown rock.
[00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:57.140]   - But after spending time with Hannah, our director,
[00:20:57.140 --> 00:21:01.540]   she just opened up this world of beauty
[00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:06.540]   that God has hidden in rocks and strata.
[00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:09.500]   I mean, she could explain things.
[00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:11.860]   So just being around other people
[00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:16.860]   that have their own recipe of wonder,
[00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:19.980]   so to speak, they have something in their heart
[00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:23.460]   that God has designed that draws them into creation
[00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:24.700]   that they can share.
[00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:26.780]   And really just the simplest things
[00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:31.780]   my granddaughters go to CC here in our community.
[00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:35.740]   And I just love hearing what they're gonna present.
[00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:40.740]   You know, the presentations of children help us see again,
[00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:44.860]   the wonder of God.
[00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:47.180]   One of my granddaughters shared about her,
[00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:50.300]   she had a giant praying mantis in a jar.
[00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:52.900]   And another one had her favorite,
[00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:55.540]   she recited her favorite little poem.
[00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:59.140]   And of course, David brought his Spiderman outfit.
[00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:06.740]   They all have a taste of wonder.
[00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:09.100]   And I think in community,
[00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:11.300]   that's what we can share with each other.
[00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:14.740]   And that, I mean, that's the body of Christ.
[00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:19.300]   It's really proclaiming his nature to one another
[00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:24.580]   and praising him through just that sharing with each other.
[00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:26.100]   Oh, did you know about this?
[00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:27.420]   Did you see this?
[00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:31.180]   And that's why community is so important.
[00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:33.980]   It really builds that in us, doesn't it?
[00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:37.180]   And I feel like for our children,
[00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:40.940]   my children were very different from me, surprisingly.
[00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:43.300]   And they had their own wonders.
[00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:45.060]   And so they could find a community
[00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:47.620]   with like-minded wanderers, you know,
[00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:51.100]   that everyone, oh, this group of people loves insects,
[00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:53.540]   you know, and are drawn together.
[00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:57.940]   So I just found community absolutely essential
[00:22:57.940 --> 00:23:00.060]   for just for myself,
[00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:04.180]   but also just to really encourage my own children
[00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:06.180]   to see that there were people
[00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:10.100]   that really had proclivities that they matched with them.
[00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:13.180]   And that was kind of a neat,
[00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:16.500]   that's just an extra, I don't think we promote that.
[00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:19.340]   - Yeah, I know, but it's really true.
[00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:22.380]   That's very beautifully presented, Amy.
[00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:24.380]   I think, yeah, that that's really true.
[00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:27.020]   One of the beauties of community
[00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:29.340]   is that we can find kindred spirits.
[00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:32.580]   And our children need that because you know what?
[00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:36.700]   We're not always the kindred spirit for our child.
[00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:40.860]   Their passion is not always what we're passionate about.
[00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:43.100]   And so we can't chase it
[00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:46.940]   as well as a friend they may find in community.
[00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:49.100]   That's lovely.
[00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:52.220]   So you and I have talked about Scribblers before
[00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:54.860]   because we worked on Scribblers together,
[00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:59.380]   and we've discussed those pillars of a homeschool day
[00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:02.380]   that you've already recounted for us.
[00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:04.220]   In Scribblers, we talk about,
[00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:08.660]   if you have done these five things every day,
[00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:10.460]   it's been a good day.
[00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:16.220]   Yep, if you pray together, play together,
[00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:20.340]   read together, explore together,
[00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:24.620]   and serve together every day, it's been a good day.
[00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:29.620]   So how can we embrace wonder as we pray, play,
[00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:33.060]   read, explore, and serve?
[00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:38.060]   So I ask Amy to choose one of the Scribblers activities,
[00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:40.940]   and I don't know which one she's picked,
[00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:44.180]   to choose one of the Scribblers activities
[00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:47.340]   and help us see the wonder.
[00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:49.940]   So Amy, tell me which one you picked,
[00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:51.940]   and I'm gonna look it up in my book.
[00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:54.620]   Well, it was really hard to narrow it down.
[00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:59.620]   But I chose a science page 207 called "Turn Over a New Leaf."
[00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:03.900]   But I'll tell you, Lisa,
[00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:08.100]   when I was going through this a few days ago,
[00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:12.660]   I was thinking there is wonder in every one of the strands,
[00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:15.460]   because we start off with poetry,
[00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:20.460]   and there is such beauty in language that there's a wonder.
[00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:23.660]   Like if we just read the poetry,
[00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:26.180]   there are people that find that so beautiful.
[00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:29.580]   And of course, history and arithmetic.
[00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:32.860]   And I was thinking, I even looked into Latin,
[00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:36.340]   I was like, okay, that's me, the true test, right?
[00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:40.420]   But I thought here again is the regularity of God,
[00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:45.100]   that a language that was spoken hundreds of years ago,
[00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:49.500]   I can understand because the commonality
[00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:52.020]   of the structure of language,
[00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:53.740]   and that's a gift from the Lord.
[00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:58.740]   And here again, every time you uncover this beauty
[00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:02.420]   and that he incorporates in all aspects.
[00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:03.980]   So it was hard for me.
[00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:08.980]   But I thought, okay, I love being outside with the children.
[00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:14.060]   And sometimes that was the last thing on my list
[00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:17.500]   is to get outside.
[00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:19.300]   And I thought this is an invitation.
[00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:23.180]   So, and I love this activity, because anybody can do it
[00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:27.500]   if you're just for three year olds or 23 year olds,
[00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:28.340]   you can all do it.
[00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:31.980]   And it's super simple, because basically,
[00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:35.500]   it's going outside and you equip yourself,
[00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:38.820]   especially young children love instruments, right?
[00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:43.820]   So the purpose of this is to find a tree
[00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:47.460]   or a bush is a little tricky,
[00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:52.300]   but if you can find a tree that you are going to focus on,
[00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:56.380]   and so I would say, grab a towel,
[00:26:56.380 --> 00:26:59.060]   and the way you're gonna get some like,
[00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:01.700]   I think of scissors and old spoons,
[00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:05.740]   and you don't have to buy things.
[00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:07.140]   Get some masking tape.
[00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:11.780]   I say if you have a string, like children can handle,
[00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:15.020]   that's pretty handy for this activity.
[00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:19.100]   And a magnifying glass, just get them to gather things.
[00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:21.100]   Oh my goodness, children just love that.
[00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:25.820]   And then get in a bag and choose a tree.
[00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:28.460]   And then what I loved about this activity
[00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:33.460]   is that you look at the tree from three points of view.
[00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:40.740]   You have, you lay on the ground,
[00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:43.460]   you, I say, okay, the three points of view
[00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:46.140]   is you're gonna look at it from eye level
[00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:49.180]   from down on the ground, and then you're gonna,
[00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:52.060]   well, ground floor, and then you're gonna look at eye level,
[00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:57.060]   and then what I call your head back, looking up. (laughs)
[00:27:57.060 --> 00:28:00.460]   So you're gonna just take some time
[00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:03.340]   and around that base of the tree,
[00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:05.940]   just what's growing around there?
[00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:07.300]   What kind of dirt does it have?
[00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:09.580]   Dig up some dirt, put it in a bag,
[00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:12.980]   start gathering your specimens around the tree.
[00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:14.900]   That's where a masking tape comes in handy.
[00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:17.220]   You can stick it, the sticky side out,
[00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:18.940]   you can stick it down on the ground
[00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:21.300]   and pull it up and see what you get.
[00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:23.380]   And then around the base of the tree,
[00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:25.780]   you can stick it around there and pull it out.
[00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:27.780]   If you wanna get a piece of bark
[00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:29.940]   or look at if you can see the roots,
[00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:32.180]   you can kind of take a look at the roots
[00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:36.740]   and kind of feel them, just really kind of engage
[00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:39.140]   at that level where you're touching things,
[00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:41.020]   you're digging things, you're looking at things.
[00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:46.020]   Even if you find dead stuff, stick it in. (laughs)
[00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:48.700]   We were always finding dead stuff.
[00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:51.500]   And if there's a bug, you might have to talk about
[00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:53.420]   if we're gonna bring in the house or not.
[00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:55.940]   - Right. (laughs)
[00:28:55.940 --> 00:29:00.900]   - But then if you can, then get your child,
[00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:02.380]   one of the things that we've done too
[00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:04.940]   is just take a piece of string, this is wildlife string,
[00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:07.220]   and get them to measure the base of the tree.
[00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:10.380]   Like what is, how big is the trunk?
[00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:14.260]   And a string is nice because you can measure
[00:29:14.260 --> 00:29:16.220]   around the trunk and then just clip it
[00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:18.900]   and then stick it in your bag
[00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:20.860]   so you can come inside and measure it
[00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:25.620]   because sometimes it's unwieldy to do a tape measure,
[00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:27.100]   you know, that--
[00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:32.100]   - I agree, especially for little hands on uneven surfaces.
[00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:34.220]   Yeah, that's good. - You wanna make it
[00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:35.980]   really hospitable for them.
[00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:38.740]   And then have them stand up and start looking
[00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:41.180]   at where their eye level,
[00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:42.780]   which is gonna be different than yours,
[00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:44.580]   but compare those eye levels.
[00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:48.180]   Like they may see lower branches
[00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:51.060]   or they may see particular leaves or buds,
[00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:53.300]   it depends on what time of year it is,
[00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:54.740]   and they can just notice
[00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:57.140]   and you can just start helping them compare,
[00:29:57.140 --> 00:29:58.780]   like how is this different
[00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:00.460]   than what you saw at the base of the tree?
[00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:02.900]   How is this, what do you anticipate?
[00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:04.420]   Why do you think things are here?
[00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:07.300]   And just start asking those questions
[00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:10.580]   of helping them start exploring really
[00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:11.460]   what you're gonna do.
[00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:14.620]   And one of the places that I find interesting,
[00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:16.020]   if you have a low enough tree,
[00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:19.060]   it's a look at the branch coming off the trunk
[00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:22.620]   and just sort of looking at how is it shaped?
[00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:23.620]   What's this form?
[00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:24.620]   What's this pattern?
[00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:26.180]   What do you recognize?
[00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:30.300]   So getting them to sort of think about,
[00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:35.300]   oh, this is interesting because this tree goes up and out
[00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:38.660]   and this tree, you know, other trees like Christmas trees,
[00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:40.860]   you know, they're just like triangle.
[00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:45.780]   So helping them, is this a leaf or is this a pine needle
[00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:50.780]   or is this, you know, is this kind of a small shaped leaf
[00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:55.060]   or does this look like a maple leaf?
[00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:55.900]   What does this look like?
[00:30:55.900 --> 00:31:00.060]   And in this, for this chart that goes
[00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:02.460]   with this section is a leaf chart.
[00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:06.300]   So you can actually take it outside and get them to say,
[00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:08.260]   oh, well, are the leaves arranged?
[00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:09.380]   How are they arranged?
[00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:10.780]   And what are the parts?
[00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:14.220]   It's so cool to get to have some language
[00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:15.620]   that you can share with them.
[00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:17.380]   And then I say the head up.
[00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:21.100]   I just say, look up, step back, look at the tree.
[00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:23.940]   What's the overall shape and get them to draw it.
[00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:25.340]   They don't have to be perfect.
[00:31:25.340 --> 00:31:28.420]   You know, I can draw a triangle or a big circle,
[00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:29.940]   but get them to see the shape.
[00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:32.860]   And then what is their circumstance, so to speak?
[00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:34.340]   What's around the tree?
[00:31:34.340 --> 00:31:37.020]   Are there other trees?
[00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:40.020]   Is it out in the field?
[00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:43.940]   Do you see any animals in the trees or have you,
[00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:47.380]   is it like birds or a little butterflies?
[00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:49.660]   Right now we have butterflies over our trees.
[00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:51.620]   So what do you see?
[00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:54.460]   And again, from the big picture and then,
[00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:57.140]   and then just come inside and kind of parse out,
[00:31:57.140 --> 00:32:01.300]   you know, dump all your specimens and then just sort,
[00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:04.180]   you know, what's different, what did we learn?
[00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:09.180]   And I would say, you know, asking, well, what did we,
[00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:12.140]   and this would usually be something we can start with.
[00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:14.740]   What do we know about trees?
[00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:17.180]   And then what do we hope to know?
[00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:18.740]   What do we want to discover?
[00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:22.100]   Starting that before you go out and kind of anticipating.
[00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:25.700]   And then I used to write that down.
[00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:27.140]   And then when we came back,
[00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:30.860]   hey, did any of these questions get answered for you?
[00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:33.540]   And there was always something that we,
[00:32:33.540 --> 00:32:35.380]   yeah, I didn't know.
[00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:40.380]   We had, you know, the root system look, you know,
[00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:43.020]   look like that, you know,
[00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:46.020]   or I didn't know that the trunk was that big around.
[00:32:46.020 --> 00:32:48.220]   Sometimes we've been with trunks
[00:32:48.220 --> 00:32:51.820]   where two kids would have to like, you know, hold hands.
[00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:53.180]   Hold hands to go around.
[00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:54.820]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:32:54.820 --> 00:32:59.420]   But yeah, like that is just a very simple thing
[00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:05.660]   you can, activity you can do right outside.
[00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:10.660]   And I just find that's your field trip for the day, right?
[00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:12.620]   Yes.
[00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:14.700]   One of the beautiful things
[00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:19.700]   that I think endeavor trips like that,
[00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:23.340]   one of the beautiful things that you show your children is
[00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:26.460]   when you're outside and exploring
[00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:27.820]   and you're just having fun
[00:33:27.820 --> 00:33:31.060]   and you're just following your senses
[00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:33.500]   wherever they take you.
[00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:35.700]   But when you come back in and think about it
[00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:37.140]   and retrace your steps,
[00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:41.100]   you realize that all of that observing
[00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:45.500]   and testing answered some of your questions.
[00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:50.500]   And so that begins from a really early age to teach them,
[00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:52.700]   I can learn about the world
[00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:56.380]   and that the way that I interact
[00:33:56.380 --> 00:33:58.660]   with what God is showing me,
[00:33:58.660 --> 00:34:03.660]   how I find the wonder actually helps me know creation better.
[00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:10.380]   And the really wonderful thing is that you can do this
[00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:16.780]   with four-year-olds and five-year-olds and 10-year-olds
[00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:21.300]   and 12-year-olds and 16-year-olds.
[00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:22.580]   But I wanna tell you, Amy,
[00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:25.420]   that you can do this with 15-month-olds.
[00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:30.420]   Now I know that we did not market scribblers necessarily
[00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:35.420]   to 15-month-olds, but one of the joys of my heart
[00:34:35.420 --> 00:34:38.140]   is my grandson, Gideon.
[00:34:38.140 --> 00:34:41.380]   And I had the chance yesterday
[00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:43.780]   to spend some time with him outside.
[00:34:43.780 --> 00:34:48.300]   We were strolling around, walking and walking and walking.
[00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:53.020]   And when he was ready to have a deep drink of milk
[00:34:53.020 --> 00:34:55.220]   and get out of the stroller for a little while,
[00:34:55.220 --> 00:34:56.620]   we were sitting on a bench together
[00:34:56.620 --> 00:35:00.180]   and he's a very observant kid.
[00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:02.940]   Of course, I feel like he's the smartest 15-month-old
[00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:04.700]   that ever lived.
[00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:06.420]   But he was very interested in,
[00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:08.380]   there was a bush sitting beside our bench
[00:35:08.380 --> 00:35:10.740]   and he kept pointing to the bush
[00:35:10.740 --> 00:35:12.300]   and he kept looking at me
[00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:13.780]   and then he'd point to the bush.
[00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:16.740]   And I said, "Do you want a leaf?"
[00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:18.180]   And he kind of nodded.
[00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:23.180]   And so I pulled off one of the leaves and I gave it to him.
[00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:27.820]   And he felt it and he traced it with his finger
[00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:30.100]   and he crinkled it and he shook it
[00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:31.220]   to see if it would make a noise
[00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:32.860]   and I showed him how to twirl it.
[00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:34.820]   And then he started pointing.
[00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:37.480]   On the ground were some of the leaves
[00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:38.860]   that had already fallen off
[00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:40.020]   and they were a different color.
[00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:43.580]   So we talked about, okay, it's a smooth leaf,
[00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:47.860]   it's a green leaf, it came from this tree
[00:35:47.860 --> 00:35:48.940]   and I pulled it off.
[00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:50.860]   And we talked about in the fall,
[00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:52.820]   the leaves will turn brown and they'll fall.
[00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:55.420]   And he pointed to the ground and there's a brown leaf.
[00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:59.140]   And so I gave it to him and he held one in each hand
[00:35:59.140 --> 00:36:02.620]   and I said, "Okay, so does it feel different?"
[00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:05.700]   So he rubbed him and he's 15 months old,
[00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:08.320]   he's not telling me things, he's not talking,
[00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:13.320]   but he can point and when I say feel it, he would feel it.
[00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:15.540]   And so he twirled both of them
[00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:17.260]   and he walked around for a while
[00:36:17.260 --> 00:36:20.260]   and then he pointed to another bush that was also green,
[00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:22.740]   but it was a different kind of bush.
[00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:24.540]   And so I said, "Do you want one of those?"
[00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:25.900]   And he nodded and I gave it to him.
[00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:28.200]   I said, "Okay, now it has a sticker on the end.
[00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:31.060]   "If you poke your finger with this, it might hurt."
[00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:34.140]   So he took the green leaves and he held them out.
[00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:36.820]   He actually held one in each hand and he was looking.
[00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:39.140]   I said, "Okay, so this one is long.
[00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:40.900]   "This one is big and long and thin
[00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:43.060]   "and this one is short and round
[00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:44.540]   "with the sticker on the end."
[00:36:44.540 --> 00:36:49.540]   And so even a 15 month old can be interested
[00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:52.520]   in the world that God's created.
[00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:57.080]   And find things to marvel at, the feel of it.
[00:36:57.080 --> 00:37:00.360]   And I will say, he did lift it to his lips
[00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:03.680]   and he looked at me 'cause we had been singing a song
[00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:06.320]   about all the senses and God gave us eyes
[00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:08.000]   and nose and fingers.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:09.500]   And so he put it up to his mouth and I said,
[00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:11.400]   "No, no, it is not for taste.
[00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:14.780]   "It is just for looking and touching."
[00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:18.340]   And he was like, "Okay, Lolly, that's fine."
[00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:21.220]   But I guess I share that with you
[00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:26.220]   because there is wonder even in what you can do
[00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:28.400]   with a 15 month old.
[00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:31.260]   It doesn't have to be a verbal child
[00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:35.040]   and it can be a child that could write a paragraph
[00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:37.180]   about what you're observing.
[00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:41.460]   The point, I think, for me, the point is,
[00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:44.580]   can we find wonder alongside our children?
[00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:47.880]   Will we allow the Lord to woo us
[00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:51.320]   with the beauty that he's provided for us
[00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:54.260]   into a deeper relationship with him?
[00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:59.260]   And will we make finding wonder the linchpin
[00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:04.320]   of our homeschooling for this year?
[00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:07.400]   I would love that.
[00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:10.700]   Hey, Amy let me know, well, actually,
[00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:14.240]   I had not discovered it yet, but Amy discovered something
[00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:16.820]   that you guys might really want to know,
[00:38:16.820 --> 00:38:21.160]   especially since we've talked about scribblers at home,
[00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:24.460]   recipes from lifelong learners.
[00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:28.240]   For this next month, so starting today,
[00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:32.240]   starting today and going to mid-October,
[00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:34.320]   Scribblers is on sale.
[00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:36.260]   It's a buy one, get one.
[00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:40.360]   It is an amazing resource.
[00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:42.760]   No matter how old your children are,
[00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:47.300]   there are lots of activities that your whole family can do,
[00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:50.660]   but every activity comes with a chart
[00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:55.660]   that shows you as the parent where these activities
[00:38:55.660 --> 00:38:59.040]   are taking you and your student
[00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:01.520]   as they grow and mature and learn.
[00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:04.980]   So I've had hundreds of families say to me,
[00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:09.160]   hey, I don't have a preschooler anymore,
[00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:11.900]   but I'm buying scribblers 'cause I want all the charts
[00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:13.260]   in one place.
[00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:17.640]   And I would not say no to that myself.
[00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:19.000]   So I want to encourage you,
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:22.560]   if you've been curious about scribblers,
[00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:27.240]   but hesitant for whatever reason, this is your moment.
[00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:29.200]   This is the opportune moment.
[00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:33.560]   Buy one, get one is an awesome opportunities
[00:39:33.560 --> 00:39:35.440]   for families to share this.
[00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:39.840]   And if you're like me, I have multiple young moms
[00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:42.020]   that I would like to share this with.
[00:39:42.020 --> 00:39:45.840]   And this is a great build my Christmas list
[00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:50.840]   and check it off opportunity for scribblers.
[00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:53.460]   Amy, you mentioned that your grandchildren
[00:39:53.460 --> 00:39:55.060]   are loving the activities.
[00:39:55.060 --> 00:39:55.900]   - They do.
[00:39:55.900 --> 00:40:00.560]   And Lisa, that is great because I gave both of these to,
[00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:04.760]   I bought two for my daughters-in-law
[00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:09.620]   because it's just so wonderful
[00:40:09.620 --> 00:40:11.760]   to be able to have a resource like this
[00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:15.560]   because not only you have activities,
[00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:18.560]   which are really fun and they've designed them in ways
[00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:21.080]   that you can just, like I just did,
[00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:23.800]   just get a towel and a butter knife
[00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:26.000]   and you're good to go, right?
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.440]   But also those charts,
[00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:33.160]   and even if you're not in the challenge world yet,
[00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:35.680]   but they educate you so well.
[00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:40.060]   Like they have all that with the English grammar.
[00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:42.060]   I was referring to that the other day
[00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:45.120]   and I thought, man, this is so rich
[00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:49.580]   because just repair you as an adult,
[00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:52.820]   as the educator of your home that you can go,
[00:40:52.820 --> 00:40:57.400]   okay, I need to learn that part of speech
[00:40:57.400 --> 00:40:59.980]   or the arithmetic part.
[00:40:59.980 --> 00:41:02.620]   They have so many cool activities
[00:41:02.620 --> 00:41:06.400]   that incorporate higher level thinking about math
[00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:11.400]   that I would never go flipping through a book for that,
[00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:13.600]   but it's right here.
[00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:15.360]   That's what I like about it. - It's right there.
[00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:19.180]   - It's already designed for you to,
[00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:20.680]   it's like your own curriculum.
[00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:23.840]   - Yeah, it really is.
[00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:25.240]   It really is.
[00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:27.560]   The basics of what you need to know
[00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:29.480]   about all of these subjects
[00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:32.600]   kind of in an orderly fashion,
[00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:36.780]   from simple concepts to more complex concepts
[00:41:36.780 --> 00:41:40.200]   that you will really sink your teeth into as you learn.
[00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:42.080]   I love that, I love that.
[00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:47.060]   Well, so we encourage you guys to check out Scribblers,
[00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:51.720]   and we encourage you to put on your wonder hat
[00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:54.180]   and go out and find the wonder
[00:41:54.180 --> 00:41:58.840]   that God is using to woo you and your family to himself.
[00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:04.680]   If your family is looking for another occasion
[00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:10.280]   to think heady thoughts or to talk about good books,
[00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:15.120]   I have a reminder for you.
[00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:19.460]   There is a Words Aptly Spoken book club
[00:42:19.460 --> 00:42:24.280]   that's led by Classical Conversations founder, Lee Borton.
[00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:28.120]   You could join weekly this book club.
[00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:30.200]   It's hosted online.
[00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:34.460]   And every week the meeting centers around a new book.
[00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:39.060]   So some are exclusives like selections
[00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:41.360]   from the Copper Lodge Library.
[00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:44.860]   It's also literary classics like Tom Sawyer
[00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:48.080]   or C.S. Lewis's Mere Christianity.
[00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:52.080]   There's some really good thought-provoking conversations.
[00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:55.240]   Sometimes you just need somebody else
[00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:58.360]   to prime the pump of your deep thinking
[00:42:58.360 --> 00:43:01.920]   or somebody else to encourage you to grab a book
[00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:03.920]   you've always been curious about
[00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:07.000]   but never really dipped all the way into.
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:10.600]   Words Aptly Spoken book club is probably for you.
[00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:15.600]   Visit leebortons.com and you can find the link
[00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:19.660]   to join the live Words Aptly Spoken book club.
[00:43:19.660 --> 00:43:24.580]   So that's leebortons.com, okay?
[00:43:24.580 --> 00:43:27.940]   Amy, thank you so much for chasing wonder
[00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:29.580]   again with me today.
[00:43:29.580 --> 00:43:31.780]   This has been fun.
[00:43:31.780 --> 00:43:34.260]   - Oh, it's just been so delightful, always.
[00:43:34.260 --> 00:43:35.540]   So thank you, Lisa.
[00:43:35.540 --> 00:43:36.480]   It's been fun.
