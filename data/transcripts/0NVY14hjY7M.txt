[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.720]   Hey, it's Cal Newport here. This is my second weekly update video. This is where I give you
[00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:13.600]   a look inside my life as a professional writer, professor, and podcaster, including the types of
[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:19.600]   struggles that I personally go through as I attempt to work deeply in an increasingly distracted world.
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:31.280]   [Music]
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:37.680]   So here's the plan for today's video. I want to focus in particular on where I am with my writing.
[00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:45.200]   It was an interesting week that I've had with my book writing progress since the last video,
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:51.600]   so I want to get into that. And then I want to show you something here in my DeepWork HQ that
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:58.080]   I left off of the tour, the tour from last week's video, the most important part of the HQ I left
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.080]   out of the tour, and I'm going to show it to you at the end of this video, so be ready for that.
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:07.440]   All right, let's do a writing update. If you remember, I'm writing a book called Slow
[00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:14.080]   Productivity. I have some internal milestones. These are self-imposed goals that I'm trying to
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:20.400]   match, and right now in the month of October, I am trying to finish chapter six. The schedule I
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.960]   try to keep is writing first thing every morning, five to six days a week. Here's the problem.
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:33.440]   Since the last video, I have not gotten much done on this chapter. I was just looking at my
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:40.000]   Scrivener before we started recording. I think I've written less than 2,000 words. So I want to
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.080]   talk about what happened there and use that as an excuse to talk about more broadly difficulties
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.480]   that you face trying to do DeepWork on a regular basis. So here's why I didn't get much done. Two
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:57.920]   things happened. One, an unexpected commitment fell onto my plate in this case. The New Yorker
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.280]   asked me to write a reaction piece to something that was timely. So in my two-shift system,
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.680]   where in the morning I work on my primary DeepWork, and in the afternoon I do a short shift
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:14.480]   on my secondary DeepWork, I had to swap and make this New Yorker article the thing I was working on
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.280]   during my primary DeepWork hours. That's hard writing. It requires my full concentration.
[00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:25.200]   And my book got moved to the second shift, which means I'm not really making progress on my word
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.560]   count. I'm just doing background research, outlining, walking, and thinking through how
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:38.960]   I want the chapter to unfold. Next, calendar creep. So as much as I try to defend the morning
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:45.280]   for when I work on my book, inevitably there will be days where things come in that take up that
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.320]   time. And I've had multiple things recently come right near each other in my schedule. It's
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.000]   actually been a little bit frustrating. It's just coincidence. But they've come into my schedule,
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.640]   they've been hard to avoid, but they've made progress on the book difficult. So I'm looking
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.960]   at my calendar here, I'm going to give you two real world examples of calendar creep,
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:11.600]   places where my attempts to protect my morning failed. So the first was I had a call had to fall
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:17.200]   onto my schedule for 1030. It was a timely call and there wasn't any other time for me to do it.
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:25.440]   Later that day at 1, I was coming here to do some live call recording for my podcast.
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.640]   Then a reporter who's working on a potential profile of me wanted to come that day as well.
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:36.480]   So now suddenly, what was going to be a full morning of writing is basically nothing because
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.680]   I have to be completely ready for the reporter and coming to the studio, which requires some prep.
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.720]   I have to be done with that before my call that happens at 1030, which means I probably have to
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:52.240]   start getting ready for all of that at 10 or 930, depending on how much my prep goes. I don't get
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:57.760]   back from dropping my kids off from school until 830 or 845. There's no time left to do real writing.
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.960]   So these type of things happen. They happen to me, they happen to other people. Things pile
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:08.720]   unexpectedly on your calendar, your best laid plans to protect time goes away. This is where
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:15.360]   having the arbitrary milestones helps. Because I have this goal of finishing this chapter by the
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:22.560]   end of October, and because I know I have fallen behind on that goal, I have now reacted to this
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:29.120]   slow last week by adding extra sessions in the days ahead. I'm going to try to compensate
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:34.640]   for what I lost so that I can actually hit this arbitrary milestone.
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.560]   I'm looking at my calendar now. Here's what I'm doing. On Friday of this week,
[00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.360]   I'm adding, I've arranged to have an afternoon into the early evening writing block.
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:49.200]   I don't normally do that, but I'll come here to the HQ, change the scenery and power through. I've
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:54.000]   added a Saturday writing block for this weekend. I don't normally write on Shabbat, but this is a
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.400]   special occasion. On Sunday, I had to change the calendar, flip things around with my wife so that
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:05.440]   the morning I could have off, and I'm going to do a pretty intense Sunday morning writing session.
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:12.720]   Next week, I'm going on a trip. I'm going to a conference. I'm now systematically structuring
[00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.280]   in writing sessions into my schedule at that conference. I'm going to do a lot more writing
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:23.520]   in the next 10 days than I would do in a normal week because I have an arbitrary goal and I'm
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:29.280]   trying to compensate for a slow week. We'll see how that goes. The lesson I'm extracting from this,
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:34.160]   at least from my own experience, is that structuring deep work and trying to stick
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:40.480]   to the structure has this beneficial side effect of it will push you to do things like adding these
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:47.040]   extra sessions that you wouldn't normally do if you instead approach these big projects without
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:53.120]   structure. If I just said, "I write every day. This book is due in March. Let's see what happens,"
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:58.800]   this last week would never be compensated for. That's what's going on. Next week, I'll update
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:05.120]   you on how this is unfolding, but I have a lot of writing in my future. As I promised,
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:12.560]   I wanted to show you a secret element of the Deep Work HQ that I think we will all agree in the end
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.320]   is probably the most important element of this headquarters. I didn't show it to you in the
[00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:22.160]   tour last week, but I'm going to show it to you right now. Follow me. What we're going to do here
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:31.600]   is go back around the corner to the office portion of the HQ. Progress is being made.
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:36.240]   Each new week, this is becoming a better and better office. We have a monitor again. I finished
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:46.320]   building a 3D printer. This office portion of the HQ contains the cornerstone of the Deep
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:54.640]   Questions podcast franchise, the most important element of that franchise. That is my famous blue
[00:06:54.640 --> 00:07:05.040]   shirt. I present to you where the blue shirt lives, this cluttered closet on this single
[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:12.480]   hanger. Every week, this comes out, podcast is recorded, and it goes back into the closet.
[00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:18.720]   Little known fact, we have a $500,000 insurance policy on this room because without this shirt,
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:28.000]   podcasts can't exist.
