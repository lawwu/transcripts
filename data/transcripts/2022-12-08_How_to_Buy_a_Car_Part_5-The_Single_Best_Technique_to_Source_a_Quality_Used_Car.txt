[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.240]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:37.160]   skills, insights, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now, while
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.960]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.920]   On today's podcast, I want to share with you the single best technique for sourcing a quality
[00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.760]   used car.
[00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.040]   This episode, of course, fits into our how to buy a car series.
[00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.920]   In episode one of that series, I talked about how to decide whether you should buy a car
[00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:56.920]   or not.
[00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.920]   I want to encourage that if possible, without giving too much lifestyle, just skip having
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:01.920]   a car.
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.480]   Then, of course, acknowledging that most of us are going to choose to have a car for various
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:07.480]   reasons.
[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.120]   We talked in episode two about how to decide what kind of car you should buy, and then
[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.960]   episode three, setting a budget for that car, deciding how much you should spend on a car
[00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.000]   before you go and look.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.800]   The natural outcome of the budget for many people is going to be that the decision about
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.200]   buying a used car or a new car is going to be fairly obvious.
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.660]   Remember that we're aiming for somewhere between around 10% of our annual income to as high
[00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.640]   as 50%.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.560]   The lower the better for wealth creation purposes, as long as you can get a vehicle that's appropriate
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:39.800]   for your needs.
[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:45.400]   That's our target in terms of overall spending, meaning amount of money to spend on a car
[00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.840]   across our household.
[00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.960]   Aiming for 10% if you're serious about wealth building, and up as high as 50% if your wealth
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.360]   building goals are more modest and you're trying to perhaps buy a vehicle that's not
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.760]   available at the lower end.
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.080]   If we think about these numbers, let's say you're earning $100,000, that 10% number is
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.680]   going to be about $10,000.
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.320]   If you're spending $10,000 to $20,000, you're going to be buying most likely a used car.
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.120]   On the other hand, if your annual budget, your income is $1 million a year, then of
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.300]   course you're almost certainly going for a new car to get all the benefits of a new car.
[00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.940]   Not really much of a reason to go for a used car at that budget.
[00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.640]   We spoke about in episode four, this question extensively about deciding if you buy a new
[00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.980]   car or a used car.
[00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:35.000]   Let's acknowledge the fact that especially in the early stages of wealth building, most
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.120]   of us are going to be buying used cars, not new cars.
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.320]   The problem is how do you find a good one?
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:47.880]   In the next episode, I'll talk about shopping broadly, buying from a private party, buying
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.560]   from a dealer, etc.
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.040]   I want to create a standalone episode and simply tell you how I do this.
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.760]   The technique is very simple.
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.280]   I want to make sure that I buy a car that I know the history of.
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:06.760]   The biggest fear or the biggest genuine problem with buying a used car is you're going to
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.140]   wind up buying a car that you don't know the history of.
[00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.080]   You can solve that problem in a couple of ways.
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.060]   A new car solves the problem because it has no history.
[00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.340]   It's coming directly from the factory, therefore you know it's delivered to me.
[00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.960]   I'm the one who's changed the oil every 3,000 miles or of course today, 5 or 10.
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.440]   I'm the one who has cared for it.
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.880]   I'm the one who's made sure that any mechanical failures are fixed properly with OEM parts,
[00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:32.880]   etc.
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.760]   I know the history of a new car.
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.240]   With a used car, I don't know the history.
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:43.800]   I think it's perfectly fine for you to buy a used car for which you don't know the history
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:49.240]   as long as you're careful about making sure that you buy a car that is known for quality,
[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:53.980]   that has the features that you want, and you get it mechanically inspected before you buy
[00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:54.980]   it.
[00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:56.620]   We'll talk about that in the next episode.
[00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.500]   But there is a simple technique that I have utilized throughout my entire lifetime to
[00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:05.000]   buy high-quality used cars for which I know the history.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.100]   The technique is this.
[00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.500]   Buy it from someone you know.
[00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.040]   This technique is rock solid.
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:19.000]   If your goal is to buy quality used cars, buy cars from people that you know, from people
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.980]   that you trust.
[00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:27.560]   If you do that, you'll buy used cars for which you can be confident of the history and either
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:32.440]   the car won't have any problems or you'll know about whatever those problems are.
[00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.140]   This plan is not perfect.
[00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:39.620]   For example, I've never intentionally chosen the color of a car myself.
[00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.860]   It doesn't really matter much to me.
[00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.040]   Car comes along, it's painted, no big deal.
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:50.400]   I've also often given up on some of those features that you might like to have.
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:55.000]   I've never gone to a dealership myself and ordered a car of a certain trim package so
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.880]   that I could get exactly what I wanted on the new car.
[00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.400]   I've given up some of those things that are fun.
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.120]   If you have the choice, take the choice that you want.
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:09.320]   But what I myself have gotten in exchange is a long history of owning high-quality used
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.960]   cars that I've operated very, very inexpensively.
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.840]   I've done this by buying the cars from people that I know.
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:22.280]   Let me expand on this technique because it's not just as simple as, "Hey, so-and-so's selling
[00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.280]   a car."
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:24.280]   It does matter.
[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.920]   But here are the steps that you want to go through.
[00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:29.440]   It is that, but it's a bit more.
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.400]   I want to give you a few more things that you can do.
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.640]   Now for a limited time until I'm on motorsports.
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:41.500]   Financing as low as 1.99% for 36 months on Select 2023 Can-Am Maverick X3.
[00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.920]   Considering the Mavericks taking home trophies everywhere from King of the Hammers to Uncle
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:50.720]   Ned's backcountry rally, you're not going to find a better deal on front row seats to
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.520]   a championship winner.
[00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.720]   Don't lose out on your chance to get a Maverick X3.
[00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:59.240]   Visit Del Amo Motorsports in Redondo Beach and get yours.
[00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.240]   Offer in soon.
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.120]   See dealer for details.
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.600]   The first thing you want to really focus on is the kinds of cars that would be appropriate
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.160]   for your needs.
[00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:13.040]   The reason I spent so much time in the early episode talking about deciding what kind of
[00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:17.400]   car you should buy is to get you to think about what kind of car will fit your needs
[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.960]   and fit your lifestyle.
[00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:25.840]   By thinking ahead and considering what your needs are likely to be in the next few years,
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:29.960]   you can start to keep your eyes out for a quality car.
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:37.740]   An obvious simple example is that I've been shopping for a bigger minivan for the last
[00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:38.740]   few years.
[00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:39.740]   We have a 7 passenger minivan.
[00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:45.180]   There's no urgency, no hurry, but with a 7 passenger minivan, our own family will fill
[00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:47.280]   it up and we won't have space for any guests.
[00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:52.320]   I always like to have space for guests, so I need to upgrade to a larger vehicle so that
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:54.320]   we have space for guests.
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:56.480]   This is not something that's urgent, not pressing.
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:58.720]   I can always rent a car, I can always borrow a car.
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:04.840]   There's always solutions, but I've been systematically shopping for a vehicle for the last several
[00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:05.840]   years.
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:07.560]   Here's the way my shopping works.
[00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:13.600]   If I know a friend or I notice somebody that I know, it doesn't have to be a friend, it
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.440]   could be a co-worker, it could be a casual acquaintance, etc.
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:21.360]   I simply say to them, "Hey, if you're ever interested in selling your car, let me know."
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:27.680]   I notice that so-and-so has a nice 12 passenger van or a 15 passenger van or I want a four-wheel
[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:31.040]   drive pickup truck and I notice that someone has one that I like.
[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:35.120]   I simply tell them, "Hey, if you ever have any interest in selling your car or if you
[00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:38.720]   ever have any interest in selling your car, let me know."
[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:42.960]   What this accomplishes is it simply puts me on their radar screen where they think about
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:43.960]   it.
[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:49.920]   In most cases, that's all I'll ever say or I won't make an offer, I won't tell them what
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:50.920]   I'm willing to pay.
[00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:54.560]   I just simply say, "Hey, if you're ever interested in selling your car, please let me know.
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:57.440]   I'd like to have a car kind of like yours."
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:01.240]   In some cases, that will actually stimulate someone to go and get another car because
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:03.240]   they know they could sell their current car easily.
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:05.840]   I might be able to buy it soon enough.
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:09.880]   Most people are going to replace their car over the next, say, few years.
[00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:14.520]   By lodging that little seed in somebody's brain, they'll think of me when it comes time
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:16.280]   to sell their car.
[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:19.240]   In some cases, I've gone beyond this.
[00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:23.960]   If there's a car that I have genuinely thought was a good deal, I've gone ahead and offered
[00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:26.600]   a price for the car.
[00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:27.840]   I'll do it something like this.
[00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:30.160]   I'll say, "Hey, I really like your car.
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:33.080]   Listen, if you ever want to sell your car, please let me know.
[00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:36.400]   I'll be happy to pay you the dealer price for it."
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:40.760]   Or, "I'll be happy to pay you the dealer price plus 10% for it."
[00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:41.760]   Something like that.
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:46.240]   What I want to assure the person, if it's a car that I really like or perhaps it's the
[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:49.480]   kind of person that doesn't just want to give me a deal, I want to assure the person that
[00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:53.360]   I'm not looking for a big discount.
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:59.240]   When you're purchasing a used car, because the risk of buying a car that is poorly maintained
[00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:07.420]   is so high, I don't think shopping for a discount is generally the first order of business.
[00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:16.680]   If I'm buying, say, a $20,000 car, getting $500 off or $1,000 off is relatively immaterial
[00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:22.560]   as compared to the risk of very quickly having a $500 or $1,000 bill at the mechanic.
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:29.760]   I would rather pay an extra $500 or $1,000 more than what I could get otherwise in order
[00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:33.720]   to have a car where I know I'm not going to immediately be dropping thousands of dollars
[00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:35.880]   on mechanical service.
[00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:39.600]   As we've discussed previously, all cars are going to need service.
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:42.360]   But I want to know where that car came from.
[00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:48.080]   It's cheaper for me to "overpay" for the car than it is for me to have to go and fix a
[00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:52.200]   car that I got cheap because somebody was trying to get rid of a problem.
[00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:57.520]   So if it comes to a price, I'll often, I have said, most cases you don't need to, but I
[00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:02.440]   have said to people, "Listen, whatever the dealer offers you, I'll give you that plus
[00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:04.120]   10%."
[00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:08.400]   And so this creates a win-win situation.
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:12.720]   If somebody wants to sell the car and they want to sell the car at top price, they're
[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:17.280]   probably going to go through the hassle of marketing their vehicle.
[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:22.220]   They're going to shine it up, spiff it up, put it out on every advertising method.
[00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:24.000]   They're going to meet at the set at their house.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   They're going to have buyers come through their house.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   They're going to meet with people.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.120]   They're going to try to find people who have enough money, etc. to close the transaction.
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:35.680]   They're going to deal with a bunch of tire kickers and eventually they'll sell the car
[00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:36.800]   for top price.
[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:38.240]   That's possible.
[00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:45.160]   But I think most people who are selling cars in the price range that you and I are likely
[00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:50.200]   to buy are probably not interested in dealing with that.
[00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:55.560]   If you're selling cars at the very low end, a $5,000 car, a $3,000 car, etc., there are
[00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:58.080]   many people who can just pull out the cash and buy that.
[00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:05.680]   If you're selling cars in that high value, mid-range used car space, $25,000, $30,000,
[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:12.560]   $35,000, $15,000, that range right there, your pool of potential buyers is much smaller.
[00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:18.360]   Very few people are going to show up to your house with $30,000 in cash.
[00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:20.360]   So then you're often dealing with bank checks.
[00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:22.800]   You're dealing with people who might need to get financing.
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:27.660]   And frequently the people who have that kind of money and who just want to do a cash deal
[00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:31.420]   will often be shopping at a dealer rather than private party.
[00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:38.000]   Or they'll be the kind of person that's tempted to upgrade to a new car instead.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.200]   After all, if you're going to spend $35,000 on a used car, why not just go ahead and spend
[00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:44.080]   $50,000 and get exactly what you want?
[00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:45.940]   That's the way that many people look at it.
[00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:52.320]   So in this kind of middle-range space, $15,000 to $25,000 just to make up some numbers, the
[00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:57.080]   normal way that people dispose of those cars is just trade it into a dealer because it
[00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:58.940]   eliminates the hassle of trying to sell it.
[00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:02.800]   It eliminates the hassle of them trying to make sure most people aren't comfortable taking
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:03.800]   $20,000 of cash.
[00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:09.780]   They don't know the risks of taking a bank check or a wire transfer, etc.
[00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:12.520]   And so it's just more comfortable for them to go to the dealer.
[00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:17.600]   So if I make them an offer and I say, "Listen, I'll pay you the dealer price plus 10%," then
[00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:22.840]   I can get a price that's a very fair price and I can solve their problem for them.
[00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:26.380]   They know me, so they'll be happy to take money from me directly.
[00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:29.240]   They probably will take a personal check, certainly take a bank check.
[00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:32.340]   I can just hand them cash and we can be done with the whole thing.
[00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:34.720]   We have an agreed-upon way of setting a fair price.
[00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:37.760]   Take it to the dealer, get the quote, I'll pay you 10% more of that.
[00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:41.120]   They'll make 10% more than what they would get trading it into the dealer, which they'll
[00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:44.480]   be happy about, and they can sell their car quickly with no hassle.
[00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:47.120]   I, on the other hand, win as well.
[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:52.040]   I get a car that I know where it came from, I know the history of it, I know if it has
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:53.040]   any problems.
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:56.900]   I know the person, so the person's going to be honest and disclose them to me.
[00:12:56.900 --> 00:13:03.920]   And I get a discount on what I would have to pay for that car at a dealer.
[00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:07.960]   And again, this is all built upon the benefit that I get of knowing where that car came
[00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:08.960]   from.
[00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:13.600]   If I go buy a car from a dealer or a private party, I'm not going to be sure of the history
[00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:14.600]   of that car.
[00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:18.160]   Especially at a dealer, I'm not going to know the history of the car very well.
[00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:21.120]   And from a private party, while I can know the history of the car, I'm not going to be
[00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:22.120]   sure of it.
[00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:25.120]   I've got to look out for scammers and people lying to me.
[00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:27.120]   So that's a huge value to me.
[00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:32.520]   And yet, I'm still probably, the dealer cost or the dealer offer for a trade-in, plus 10%,
[00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:37.920]   is still probably cheaper than I could get the car, certainly at a dealer or in the private
[00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:38.920]   market.
[00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:44.560]   And regardless, as I said, the cheapness of it saving $1,000 or $2,000 is not particularly
[00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:48.360]   important when we're looking at the total life cycle of the car.
[00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:54.400]   To boot, in many cases, you can actually get it cheaper.
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:58.740]   So frequently when we sell something to a friend, we like to give our friends deals.
[00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:00.040]   We like to give our friends discounts.
[00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:03.160]   "Hey, the dealer could give me 20 grand, but I'll tell you what, I'll sell you this car
[00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:05.420]   for $18,000."
[00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:10.160]   And so you don't always have to overpay for what the dealer would give to you.
[00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:14.920]   You can underpay a little bit as well and often get a great deal.
[00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:18.020]   This is a technique that I have used again and again.
[00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:29.560]   Not all of the vehicles that I have personally purchased have been purchased using this method.
[00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:35.200]   I have gone out and purchased various vehicles from a dealer, from private parties, etc.
[00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:38.660]   But usually when I have been forced to do that, it's because I've been looking for something
[00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:42.800]   specific that I couldn't access in my network.
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:45.520]   I was looking for, in one case, I bought a 15-passenger van.
[00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:48.200]   I bought an RV from somebody.
[00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:51.520]   I bought a couple of big diesel pickup trucks, but I was looking for trucks that were older
[00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:53.840]   that somebody didn't want to sell, etc.
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:57.320]   So I had to go and source those from different people.
[00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:59.680]   One case, I went and bought an SUV from a dealer.
[00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:05.440]   So it's not that this always works, but the best vehicles I have purchased have always
[00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:07.160]   come this way.
[00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:10.940]   And it's something that you can repeat again and again and again.
[00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:13.940]   It's extremely low risk and it works.
[00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:19.080]   It allows you to get a high-quality used car where you know the history of it, you know
[00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:25.280]   where it came from at a very fair price, and that is the key of what you are looking for.
[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:30.440]   So what are the last few factors that you need to be prepared for to make this technique
[00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:31.440]   work?
[00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:33.400]   The most important one is you need to have money.
[00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:35.860]   And you need to be ahead of the game.
[00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:39.800]   So many people go shopping for a car when you need a car.
[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:45.120]   Generally speaking, a good rule of personal finance is don't shop when you need something
[00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:52.040]   or you're going to pay whatever price is demanded by the person selling it to you.
[00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:55.880]   Always shop when it's convenient for you to shop and you can get the best deal.
[00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:58.220]   So a couple of silly examples.
[00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:05.440]   If you go to Costco, you can buy a flat of 30 half-liter water bottles for $3.
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:10.600]   So $3 divided by 30, if my math is right, you're paying about 10 cents a water bottle.
[00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:11.840]   That's a great deal, right?
[00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:16.400]   10 cents a water bottle is your cheapest deal you're going to get on a bottle of water.
[00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:23.240]   But if you don't bring water with you and you're at the airport boarding area for your
[00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:28.720]   plane and you're dying of thirst, you're going to go and you're going to pay $6 for the same
[00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:30.480]   10-cent bottle of water.
[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:35.440]   So this is the difference between buying something when it's convenient for you versus buying
[00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:37.680]   something when you really need it.
[00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:42.480]   If you want to buy a lawnmower, one of the best times to do that is in the fall and winter
[00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:45.180]   when everything is discounted after the summer season.
[00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:48.600]   If you want to buy a winter coat, one of the best times to do that is in the spring and
[00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:51.400]   summer when everything is being cleared out.
[00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:55.300]   And it's the same whether you're buying new from a store or whether you're buying from
[00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:58.000]   a yard sale, etc.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:05.120]   Buying things at off-peak prices is usually your best way to get the lowest possible cost.
[00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:09.160]   But in order for that to work, you have to be thinking ahead about your future needs
[00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:13.600]   and you have to have the money that you can comfortably use to pick up a lawnmower in
[00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:17.480]   the wintertime knowing it's going to sit there for some months before you ever fire it up.
[00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:19.840]   So the same thing applies with cars.
[00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:23.960]   You need to be thinking ahead about what you need and then you need to buy it before you
[00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:25.060]   need it.
[00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:28.920]   If your current car breaks down, let's assume that you have a catastrophic breakdown or
[00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:33.960]   you have an accident and your vehicle is totaled, then you're immediately forced into what I'm
[00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:36.000]   going to call the retail price world.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.840]   You have to go out and whatever car prices are at this very moment, you have to go and
[00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:42.120]   pay those.
[00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:44.360]   So this is what happened to many people over the last two years.
[00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:51.120]   We've had a very unusual used car marketplace caused by supply chain disruptions, especially
[00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:53.040]   chip shortages, etc.
[00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:56.560]   And so anybody who needed to go out and buy a car over the last couple of years has paid
[00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:58.660]   a very, very high price.
[00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:03.200]   But if you could just afford comfortably to keep your vehicle going, then you can reach
[00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:06.640]   back and you can buy the car when you're at a normal market.
[00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:07.640]   And I think we're close.
[00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:11.360]   If we're not there already, we're back to a pretty normal market in many vehicles.
[00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:16.480]   Not all, but in the vehicle market has changed dramatically in the last six months.
[00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:19.800]   So you don't want to be forced to shop.
[00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:21.440]   So that means a couple of things.
[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:25.720]   Number one, you need to be prepared to replace your current vehicle before it ends its life
[00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:26.720]   cycle.
[00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:33.000]   Now, remember, we're usually talking about years where this is perfectly reasonable.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.920]   Vehicles have such a long life cycle compared to other consumer items that we use that you
[00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:42.040]   can drive it for an extra year and generally you're not going to have any trouble with
[00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:43.040]   that.
[00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:44.040]   But you need to be thinking ahead.
[00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:50.280]   Hey, the car that I have in my driveway is nearing the end of its useful life cycle or
[00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:53.360]   nearing the end of its reliable life cycle.
[00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:55.920]   So I need to be looking for a replacement.
[00:18:55.920 --> 00:19:00.400]   And looking for a replacement using this technique might take a couple of years to appear.
[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:04.940]   The other thing that you need is you need to always have money available to do the deal
[00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:06.700]   when it's offered to you.
[00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:15.760]   So if I've used this technique and I get a call from someone saying, "Hey, you mentioned
[00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:17.400]   to me that you might like to buy my car.
[00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:19.200]   Would you like to buy my car?"
[00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:22.680]   Usually I have a couple of days to decide to buy it or not.
[00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:25.440]   Now, if I choose not to, it's no big deal.
[00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:26.440]   No harm, no foul.
[00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:32.800]   I haven't harmed anybody by expressing interest in buying a car that they're selling.
[00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:37.000]   But if I'm going to act on it, I need to be prepared to act quickly.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.120]   So I need to have stockpiles of money set aside, ready to go quickly.
[00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:44.480]   I don't need to go, and I also generally going to avoid financing, of course.
[00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:48.280]   We don't want to finance a depreciating asset.
[00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:49.520]   That's dumb.
[00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:51.000]   But I just need to have money available.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.760]   I need to have liquid money where I can say, "Absolutely, I want to buy that car.
[00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:56.800]   Let's work out a price and let's make it happen quickly."
[00:19:56.800 --> 00:20:01.260]   I believe that's everything that's important for me to share with you.
[00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:08.640]   This simple technique is, in my experience, one of the most reliable ways for you to consistently
[00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:15.400]   purchase high-quality used automobiles at fair prices and basically minimize the hassle
[00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:20.480]   of maintaining a fleet of vehicles.
[00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:25.640]   I've identified the areas in which it won't work, specialty cars, specific things that
[00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:32.120]   you want in a car, but it is an effective way of having transportation.
[00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:33.120]   I'm not a car guy anymore.
[00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:34.120]   It's a transportation.
[00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:39.680]   If it goes down the road and it does what I need it to do, I don't care what color it
[00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:40.680]   is.
[00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:41.680]   Your mileage may vary.
[00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:43.920]   You might be in a different situation, but that is the technique.
[00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:49.880]   I hope you'll use it, and I hope you'll teach it to others because the net impact of this
[00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:55.000]   can be thousands and thousands of dollars of savings over the course of a lifetime,
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:00.560]   which can really make a big impact of helping you get on the road to wealth.
