[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.640]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:12.600]   the Gospel according to St. John, in the third chapter, in the eighteenth verse.
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:19.280]   The eighteenth verse in the third chapter of the Gospel according to St. John.
[00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:31.040]   He that believeth on him is not condemned, but he that believeth not is condemned already,
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:38.900]   because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.
[00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:48.040]   He that believeth on him is not condemned, but he that believeth not is condemned already,
[00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:58.200]   because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.
[00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:05.400]   I come back once more to a consideration of this great and most important verse.
[00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:14.520]   My reason for doing so is its very greatness and its central importance.
[00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:21.760]   We have been working our way through this amazing conversation that took place between
[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:30.480]   the Lord Jesus Christ and this man, Nicodemus, this teacher of the Jews, this Pharisee, this
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:35.600]   remarkable man, indeed this great man.
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.400]   You remember that the whole conversation took place because Nicodemus went seeking an interview
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:50.800]   with our Lord as the result of his observation of our Lord's miracles in Jerusalem.
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.960]   And you remember how he made his statement and was obviously on the verge of putting
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.840]   his question when our Lord interrupted him and said, "Verily, verily, I say unto thee,
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.040]   except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God."
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:11.840]   At once he shows him that his whole approach is wrong and that unless he is born again,
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:19.480]   born from above, born of the Spirit, he stands no chance whatsoever of even beginning to
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.440]   understand these things.
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:27.440]   And then, having done that, our Lord, you remember, has gone on to make certain positive
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:33.640]   statements about himself and the meaning and the purpose of his coming.
[00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:39.520]   And he has, as it were, summed it up in this great well-known sixteenth verse, "For God
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:46.600]   so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:53.120]   not perish, but have everlasting life."
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.640]   The verse we all think we know.
[00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.280]   The verse we all think we understand.
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.960]   But I think I've been able to show you that there is no verse that is more misunderstood
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.560]   than that.
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.280]   And we've been looking at the misunderstandings on the two sides.
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.720]   There are those who fail to see the love of God at all, so that our Lord found it necessary
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:23.640]   to add in verse 17, "For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world, but
[00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.040]   that the world through him might be saved."
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.560]   There are some people who've never seen the love of God.
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.160]   But on the other hand, as this eighteenth verse reminds us, and as I was showing last
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:43.840]   Sunday night, there are those who see nothing but the love of God, and think that John 3,
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:49.880]   16 is just a general proclamation to the effect that because God is love, everybody will be
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.960]   saved, and we have nothing at all to worry about.
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:58.000]   Well, now, here this eighteenth verse, you see, makes that very plain and clear that
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.680]   that is entirely wrong.
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.600]   There are two divisions, as we've seen.
[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.720]   There are two "he's."
[00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.600]   He that believeth, he that believeth not.
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.880]   And their fates correspond.
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:19.000]   Is not condemned, is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.200]   begotten Son of God.
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:30.200]   Very well, here we are looking at these great and all-important and momentous things.
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:37.640]   Now we've been working through these verses in detail, and we've gone through them quietly.
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:43.880]   And as we've done so, we cannot have failed to have noticed that there is one word which
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.000]   keeps on recurring.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.240]   It seems to be the controlling word in the entire passage, especially beginning from
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.680]   verse fourteen.
[00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.600]   Notice how our Lord puts it.
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:03.340]   As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up,
[00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:08.640]   that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:15.440]   For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:20.200]   in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:25.080]   For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through
[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.520]   him might be saved.
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:34.280]   He that believeth on him is not condemned, but he that believeth not is condemned already,
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:41.800]   because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:49.560]   Now here I say we see at once that the important word is this word "to believe," "he that
[00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.120]   believeth or believeth not."
[00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:58.400]   Indeed, it is of course the truth to say that this is the great word that is emphasized
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.800]   everywhere, right through the New Testament.
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:09.900]   It is the characteristic mark of the New Testament gospel that it puts in the forefront this
[00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:12.520]   word "to believe."
[00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:17.680]   It is particularly the great word of the Protestant faith.
[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:25.240]   The grand discovery that was made by Martin Luther was that a man is justified by faith,
[00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.840]   which means his belief.
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:34.760]   And this, therefore, is something I say that really must engage our most careful attention.
[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:44.960]   Therefore, I want to talk to you this evening simply and directly about this one word.
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:50.720]   And I want to put it to you in the number of propositions.
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:07:01.520]   The first thing, obviously, is this—the importance, the all-importance of belief.
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:07.580]   Now it is quite clear that this, according to our Lord's teaching here, as indeed according
[00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:17.240]   to his teaching everywhere as I've just been saying, this is the thing that determines
[00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:21.440]   our eternal destiny.
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:26.880]   And therefore, it needs no demonstration to say that there is no more important word for
[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:30.840]   us to look at together.
[00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:35.240]   Now let me put it to you in this particular way.
[00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:44.120]   Nothing strikes one as one reads through the Bible more obviously and evidently than this—the
[00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:48.080]   seriousness of life in this world.
[00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:52.280]   Now there are many forms of teaching in the Scriptures, and there are many particular
[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:58.040]   aspects of truth that are put before us, but I say there is one thing that you can't
[00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:03.360]   fail to grasp as you go through from Genesis to Revelation.
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:08.120]   And that is that the people of God, as they appear in this book, have always been a people
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:15.240]   who have regarded that life is a very serious thing.
[00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:17.840]   And why is life a serious thing?
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:25.360]   Well, it is a serious thing for this reason—that this life of ours is nothing but a kind of
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:28.280]   preparatory school.
[00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:31.600]   It's a place of probation.
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:34.000]   It is a place of preparation.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.840]   Now to say that is not a derogate from the importance of life in this world.
[00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:40.520]   The Bible never does that.
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:45.400]   The Bible, with its serious view of life, says that looked at from any angle or from
[00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:51.200]   any standpoint, life is a very big and a very great and a very momentous thing.
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:55.920]   Not over and above every other subsidiary reason that we may have for regarding life
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:57.920]   seriously.
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:07.160]   This is the one that should be uppermost—that life, as I say, is a place of probation.
[00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:10.760]   Life is not something in and of itself.
[00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:15.000]   This world is not something in and of itself.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.340]   We are simply here for a while, and we pass through it.
[00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:22.160]   These are the characteristic biblical terms, aren't they?
[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:25.640]   It calls us strangers and pilgrims.
[00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:29.440]   It calls us travelers and journeymen and sojourners.
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:31.580]   That's its picture.
[00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:35.880]   And as it describes its great men of faith, that's what it tells us—that these were
[00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:41.880]   all men who were looking for a city which has foundation, whose builder and maker is
[00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:44.200]   God.
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:54.280]   The seriousness of life, and particularly because, I say, it is the realm in which our
[00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:59.800]   eternal future is determined, nothing less than that.
[00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:05.880]   Its teaching is that man has been given a soul, and that when his body dies, his soul
[00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:12.160]   goes on, and that it goes on to all eternity.
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:17.600]   So that this, the moment you see it, gives to life a tremendous sense of importance and
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:24.720]   of seriousness—that during the short time, comparatively speaking, we are in this world,
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:31.560]   we are determining an everlasting and eternal destiny.
[00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:36.600]   Very well then, if that is true, my second proposition must, of necessity and inevitably,
[00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:39.400]   be true.
[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:47.160]   The most important thing we do in this life and in this world is the thing we are doing
[00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.960]   at this very moment.
[00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:53.440]   It is simply to listen to this gospel.
[00:10:53.440 --> 00:11:00.440]   Now that's what our Lord is, in other words, saying to Nicodemus at this point, because
[00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:08.360]   he says this, you see, that what determines that eternal destiny, whichever it is, is
[00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:10.800]   our relationship to him.
[00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:13.360]   He that believeth on him is not condemned.
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:15.840]   That's his eternal destiny.
[00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:21.160]   But he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of
[00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:23.440]   the only begotten Son of God.
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:26.040]   Here we are, I say, determining our eternal destiny.
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:32.040]   It's either to be one of bliss or one of misery, and what determines it is our relationship
[00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:37.360]   to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:44.760]   And so I say that there is nothing in the whole of life which is more important than
[00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:52.240]   what you and I are engaged in at this very second, to listen to the gospel, to listen
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:59.640]   to the words of the Lord Jesus Christ, and our response and our reaction to that.
[00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:06.200]   Now this is something, I say, that is more important than everything else, more important
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:12.040]   than politics, more important than the strikes, more important than the lockouts, more important
[00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:13.040]   than everything else.
[00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:17.320]   May I put it like this in a very personal way?
[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:28.440]   I've read during this last week two criticisms of evangelical preaching, the kind of preaching
[00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:33.080]   that anyone who comes and listens here listens to.
[00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:34.080]   And what is the criticism?
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:39.000]   Well, the criticism of it is this.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.440]   In one instance it was a criticism of me, it was in the other instance a criticism of
[00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:48.360]   all evangelicals, and it's what's always being said about this method of preaching
[00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:49.360]   the gospel.
[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:54.480]   "Oh," they say, "he just goes on saying the same thing, whether prime ministers
[00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:58.440]   fall or whether they don't."
[00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:03.920]   You see what is meant by that, that I should be standing in this pulpit when there happens
[00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:08.040]   to be the fall of a prime minister or the change of a government, that I should address
[00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:12.400]   you on that subject.
[00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:19.600]   And I suppose therefore this evening I ought to be preaching on the strikes.
[00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:21.440]   Why don't I do so?
[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:26.480]   Well, I could give you many reasons as to why I don't do so.
[00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:29.600]   One sufficient reason for me is this.
[00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:33.920]   I rarely don't know enough about the facts to express an intelligent opinion.
[00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:39.720]   I read the newspapers like everybody else, but still I don't really know.
[00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:42.440]   There is probably a great deal to be said on all sides.
[00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:45.040]   I am not in a position to offer advice.
[00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:48.240]   I really cannot help.
[00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:55.000]   And I try to make it a rule not to speak about a subject if I don't know much about it.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.360]   I should have thought that's enough, but I have an infinitely bigger and more important
[00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:03.680]   reason than that.
[00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:09.720]   While industrial and economic and social conditions of course are important, and every one of
[00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:15.680]   us should try to be as intelligent as possible with respect to them, the business of the
[00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:23.400]   Church of God is to do something that is surpassing altogether in importance, and that is this,
[00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:29.880]   to deal with the question of men's eternal destiny.
[00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:34.800]   Of course the trade of this country is important, but my dear friend, that's only going to apply
[00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:36.920]   to you for a while.
[00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:42.320]   I am talking to you this evening about something that will apply to you for all eternity, without
[00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:43.320]   end.
[00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:50.520]   And there are so few voices that do that.
[00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:55.680]   The Lord Jesus Christ was telling Nicodemus that he was addressing him about the most
[00:14:55.680 --> 00:15:01.000]   vital and the most urgent matter that can ever engage a man's attention.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.360]   But come what I am anxious to put to you this evening is this.
[00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:11.520]   Isn't it appalling to realize that men and women who take these other things so seriously
[00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:15.800]   take this so casually?
[00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:19.880]   How heated and excited people get about other things.
[00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:24.880]   How casual they are and cursory in their consideration of this.
[00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:29.160]   Come let me ask you a simple question therefore.
[00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:33.080]   Have you believed this gospel, this message?
[00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:39.480]   Have you realized the importance of knowing whether you believe it or not?
[00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:44.480]   This I say is something which is of eternal importance.
[00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:49.440]   The Lord himself said on one occasion, "Take heed, are we here."
[00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:53.880]   Have we realized, my dear friends, that we shall have to answer in eternity for the way
[00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:56.800]   we've listened to this?
[00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:04.640]   It is this that determines and decides our everlasting destiny.
[00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:09.040]   Nothing is more important therefore than belief.
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:12.560]   Very well, having established that, let me go on to the next question, which is obviously
[00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:14.800]   this one.
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:20.040]   What then is the exact nature and content of belief?
[00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:24.160]   If our Lord goes on repeating this word like this, well, what's it mean?
[00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:28.360]   You say to us, sir, someone that it's this believing or not believing that determines
[00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:29.760]   my final destiny.
[00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:33.160]   Well, what exactly do you mean by believing?
[00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:35.880]   Oh, what an important question this is.
[00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:40.640]   Let me put it therefore first of all negatively.
[00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:48.520]   To believe is not simply to say that you believe certain things.
[00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:54.360]   It includes that, but it isn't only that.
[00:16:54.360 --> 00:17:04.480]   There is a difference between belief as defined in the scripture and what you may call a believism.
[00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:07.160]   There's nothing in a sense which is quite so easy as for people to say, "All right,
[00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:08.160]   I'll believe that."
[00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:12.480]   Now, that I say is not belief.
[00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:18.600]   Secondly, to believe according to the New Testament is not merely to give an intellectual
[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:23.520]   assent to a number of assertions and propositions.
[00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:29.120]   Of course, it again includes that, but it doesn't stop at that.
[00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:34.480]   It is possible for us, alas, to give a theoretical assent to the whole of the scriptures.
[00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:39.280]   I've known men who've done that, and it's had no effect upon their lives at all.
[00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:41.080]   They happen to have been brought up in that atmosphere.
[00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:45.240]   They've got intellect, and they were interested in these things, and they knew their Bibles
[00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:49.320]   and could argue about them, but it had no influence at all upon their behavior and their
[00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:50.320]   conduct.
[00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:53.680]   It really had no influence upon their spirit.
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:58.960]   It's an appalling thing, but it's absolutely true that one can have a merely intellectual,
[00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:04.560]   purely objective and external interest even in the Word of God and in the gospel of our
[00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:08.040]   Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:10.560]   So it isn't merely that.
[00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:13.480]   I want to go even a step further and to say this.
[00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:23.360]   Belief, as it is defined here by our Lord himself, does not simply mean believing certain
[00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:27.280]   things about the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:32.200]   Once more, it's obvious, isn't it, that we must believe certain things about him.
[00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:36.600]   But I'm trying to show you that this term "belief" is a very comprehensive one.
[00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:38.880]   It includes a number of matters.
[00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:43.360]   There are people who would say without any hesitation that they think that Jesus of Nazareth
[00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:45.640]   is the best man that this world has ever seen.
[00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:47.760]   Now that's quite true.
[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:50.400]   They say that he's the greatest teacher that the world has ever seen.
[00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:52.080]   Again, it's perfectly true.
[00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:56.400]   They say his teaching in the Sermon on the Mount is the highest ethic that mankind has
[00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:57.400]   ever confronted.
[00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:01.840]   Again, it's absolutely right.
[00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:05.600]   But you know, to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ is not just that.
[00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:10.880]   There are people who take things out of him and they say, "Yes, I believe that," and
[00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:12.280]   they think they believe in him.
[00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:18.840]   Now, belief must be defined as he defined it himself.
[00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:22.640]   And he has defined it here for us perfectly, plainly, and clearly.
[00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:24.480]   Now let me remind you of it again.
[00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:27.040]   Let me sum it up for you.
[00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:31.040]   What is to believe in the name of the only begotten Son of God?
[00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:42.600]   Well, it means that we believe the specific teaching that he here gave Nicodemus.
[00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:46.960]   It involves a total attitude.
[00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:49.200]   What do you mean by your total attitude, says someone?
[00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:53.080]   Well, I mean things like this.
[00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:59.120]   To believe in the name of the only begotten Son of God, to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:07.600]   means in the first place that we accept his teaching about mankind as it is in and of
[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:11.760]   itself in sin.
[00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:14.800]   You notice his word, don't you?
[00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:19.120]   That whosoever believeth in him should not perish.
[00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:20.720]   He says it in the fifteenth verse.
[00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:23.040]   He says it in the sixteenth verse.
[00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:28.080]   God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in
[00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:31.360]   him should not perish.
[00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:36.080]   Now then, belief in the Lord Jesus Christ includes that.
[00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:41.360]   You can't talk about believing in him without this, because if you don't talk of this belief
[00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:45.640]   in terms of that, your belief is inadequate and incomplete.
[00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:47.520]   That therefore must be the starting point.
[00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:51.960]   You may say, "It's not enough for a man to say to me, 'Ah, yes, I believe that Jesus
[00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:56.000]   of Nazareth was the Son of God, and I believe that he worked miracles and that he gave a
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   certain teaching.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.240]   I believe all that."
[00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:06.800]   But the vital question is this, "Do you believe that you yourself are perishing?"
[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:10.560]   What is it that man needs?
[00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:16.400]   If you believe that Jesus of Nazareth is the Son of God, why did he come into the world?
[00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:19.080]   Why was it ever necessary that he should come?
[00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:23.640]   You see, it's a part of believing in him, and he's made it perfectly plain himself.
[00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:30.440]   He says, "As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of
[00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:33.600]   Man be lifted up."
[00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:45.120]   Mankind, every one of us by nature, is in a lost and in a perishing condition.
[00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:48.760]   Have we believed that?
[00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:55.120]   It isn't enough to admire his person and to say that you think his life was beautiful
[00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:58.200]   and his teaching was beautiful.
[00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:00.240]   That's not difficult.
[00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:05.280]   What's difficult is to admit the truth about ourselves.
[00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:07.720]   Mankind has always objected to this.
[00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:09.320]   It's still objecting to it.
[00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:14.040]   I've often reminded you of a man who wrote a criticism of Charles Wesley's great hymn,
[00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:16.160]   "Jesus, Lover of My Soul."
[00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:23.280]   He took up those phrases, "Thou and full of sin I am, thou art full of truth and grace."
[00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:27.480]   What an appalling thing to say, he said.
[00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:32.440]   Did you ever hear of a man, he says, applying for a post, putting in his application, "I
[00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:34.640]   am vile and full of sin"?
[00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:39.000]   Of course you didn't, and he should never say it.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.920]   But it's an essential part of this belief.
[00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:44.920]   You can't believe in him in abstract.
[00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:46.280]   You take him as he is.
[00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:50.520]   Here he is addressing Nicodemus, and this is what he's pressing upon Nicodemus, who
[00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:55.640]   thought that he could save himself by being a good Pharisee and by living a good life,
[00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:56.640]   and so on and so forth.
[00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:58.720]   "No, no," says Christ, "you can't.
[00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:02.840]   I've come and I've got to be lifted up as Moses lifted up the serpent.
[00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:06.720]   You are lost, you are perishing, and you cannot save yourself.
[00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:12.880]   I've come to save you."
[00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:17.000]   That is an essential part of belief.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:21.760]   You don't just believe in the Son of God, in the Lord Jesus Christ as a friend or a
[00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:24.560]   help or an aid.
[00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:28.240]   You believe in him as a Savior.
[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:34.060]   You believe in him as one who came and whose soul was made an offering for sin.
[00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:36.360]   You believe this must of his.
[00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:42.240]   You believe when he says that if he doesn't do it, you're done and you're doomed.
[00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:45.320]   Belief in him includes death.
[00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:51.920]   So I say that it means also that you include in its content that you know why he came into
[00:23:51.920 --> 00:24:00.040]   the world and what he has done by coming into this world.
[00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:08.280]   And that furthermore, you realize that you've got to trust yourself and your eternal future
[00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:15.000]   utterly and absolutely to him and what he has done for us.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:22.680]   Very well then, I can summarize it by putting it in this form.
[00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:31.160]   If I say that I believe on the name of the only begotten Son of God, what I'm really
[00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:39.760]   saying is this, that I realize that I'm just passing through this world and that I'm
[00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:43.720]   always under the eye of God.
[00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:48.920]   And that I know when I come to die that I and all others will have to stand before God
[00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:51.920]   in the judgment.
[00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:56.720]   And that I see clearly that I'm condemned, that I'm lost, that nothing that I can
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:25:06.440]   do can save me, and that I'm going inevitably in the direction of that judgment.
[00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:12.640]   But that I now see that God has so loved me that he sent his only begotten Son to bear
[00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:18.200]   my sins and their punishment, that he gave his life for me, that he died that I might
[00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:21.240]   be forgiven, he died to make me good.
[00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:26.400]   I believe that he came right out of heaven here on earth in order to do that for me and
[00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:29.600]   to save me from that appalling consequence.
[00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:38.760]   And therefore, having seen that, I forsake the life I live, the world I belong to, and
[00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:43.280]   I go after him.
[00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:45.880]   Believing includes all that.
[00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:49.060]   It means you see a total view of life.
[00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:52.680]   It means that we've come to see that the biggest and the most important thing in this
[00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:57.560]   life and in this world is that we realize this business of this eternal destiny, and
[00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:02.040]   that we've become urgent and desperate, and that we've seen the truth, and we've
[00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:04.880]   clung to him and are trusting to him.
[00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:09.480]   And now obviously we're going to avoid everything that has produced this calamity
[00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:16.960]   in the history of the race.
[00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:21.640]   That is what believing on the Lord Jesus Christ means.
[00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:27.640]   It means that these things have become central, these things have become controlling in my
[00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:32.040]   life and all my activity and all my experience.
[00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:38.200]   It means that in every realm of my life I am governed by this overruling principle that
[00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:41.720]   I am under God and I'm going on to face God.
[00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:45.360]   I am a child of God walking through this world.
[00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:49.920]   Take the way the apostle put it in that first epistle of his, in that fifth chapter that
[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:51.440]   I read to you at the beginning.
[00:26:51.440 --> 00:27:02.360]   "Fear of God, little children, and the whole world lieth in the evil one."
[00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:10.360]   Have you believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God?
[00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:17.200]   Is your belief in him the biggest thing in your life and the controlling factor everywhere?
[00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:20.040]   What a momentous thing it is to believe.
[00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:22.640]   What a big thing it is to believe.
[00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:28.200]   You know you've got to work it all out and then having worked it all out you commit yourself
[00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:29.200]   to him.
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:36.200]   Belief, I say, is not just saying that you believe.
[00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:39.320]   It's not just saying that you accept certain things.
[00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:43.880]   It's the coming home to you of this truth that he preached in Nicodemus.
[00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:46.600]   It's the significance of the word perishing.
[00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:51.960]   It's the realization that we're all involved in this and that at any moment the end may
[00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:54.240]   come and we are face to face with him.
[00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:59.720]   It's the realization of all this and the flying to Christ and the committal of ourselves
[00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:05.600]   to him and our whole life in turn is modeled according to that conception.
[00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:10.720]   Belief, that's what it means.
[00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:14.880]   You can see it in a flash, of course, thank God.
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:22.480]   But I'm emphasizing the content, which is that it involves all this.
[00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:28.720]   Very well then, that brings me to my last point this evening, which is this one.
[00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:30.960]   We've seen the importance of belief.
[00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:39.280]   We have seen the content or the character of belief.
[00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:47.880]   And I put as my third and my last proposition and principle the opposite of all that, the
[00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:54.440]   enormity of unbelief.
[00:28:54.440 --> 00:29:02.480]   He that believeth on him is not condemned, but he that believeth not is condemned already
[00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:09.000]   because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:14.200]   There is no sin that is greater than the sin of unbelief.
[00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:24.120]   There is no sin to which the word enormity is so applicable as this particular sin.
[00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:29.720]   You see how sadly we go astray, we classify sins, don't we?
[00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:34.120]   And there are some people in their ignorance who think they've never sinned at all because
[00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:36.000]   they haven't done certain things.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:42.800]   I am asserting that there is no greater sin than the sin of unbelief.
[00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:45.040]   That's what our Lord says to Nicodemus.
[00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:49.680]   It is because he hath not believed on the name of the only begotten Son of God that
[00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:54.400]   he is condemned already, as I showed you last Sunday evening.
[00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:59.920]   Very well, why is this the greatest sin?
[00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:06.080]   We are discussing a very solemn matter together this evening.
[00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:13.640]   Well, this is the greatest sin essentially for this reason.
[00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:23.440]   That unbelief just means this, that we put up and assert our opinions over and against
[00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:28.640]   God's truth and God's revelation.
[00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:30.640]   Now that is the principle.
[00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:36.000]   You see, every one of us in this chapel at this moment is in one of two positions.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:43.600]   We either accept the teaching of this book about God and about man, about our souls,
[00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:48.640]   about our life in this world, about death, about what happens after death, about what
[00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:50.000]   happens in eternity.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:57.080]   We either accept this revelation or else, and it's the only alternative, we set up
[00:30:57.080 --> 00:31:01.000]   our own ideas and our own opinions and our own thoughts.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.640]   Of course, we may accept the thoughts and opinions and ideas of somebody else.
[00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:07.200]   Yes, but it's we who decide to do that.
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:09.280]   We say, "Now this is the thing that I believe.
[00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:12.120]   This man has said it so much better than I can say it myself.
[00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:15.800]   One of these scientists or these philosophers, that's what he says, that's what I believe."
[00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:20.280]   Well, you're putting up his opinion, which is a human opinion, with your own opinion
[00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:24.800]   against God's revelation.
[00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:28.000]   Now that is a tremendous thing to do.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:32.440]   And if I do nothing else this evening, I just ask you solemnly to ponder the thing that
[00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:38.240]   is being done by so many today, the people who dismiss it all and who laugh at it and
[00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:40.760]   who ridicule it.
[00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:46.840]   What they don't realize is that they're dismissing and brushing aside the revelation
[00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:54.440]   of God and are putting up their own opinions and their own thoughts.
[00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:56.540]   There's only one word to describe that.
[00:31:56.540 --> 00:31:59.320]   It is the word enormity.
[00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:04.040]   But come, let me work out that principle with you just a little bit in detail.
[00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:06.240]   Why is unbelief such a terrible thing?
[00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:09.840]   Well, here's the first reason.
[00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:19.800]   It obviously flouts God's law and God's judgment on us and on our sin.
[00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:23.840]   You see, I'm not standing here to give you my own opinions.
[00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:30.600]   I'm simply expounding to you and telling you what is to be found in this book.
[00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:36.640]   So your argument is not with me, it's an argument with this book.
[00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:40.280]   And there in that book I find God's law.
[00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:46.680]   And I find that God's law makes certain pronouncements on me and on my conduct and on my behavior
[00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:50.520]   and on the whole of my life.
[00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:55.200]   So that if I do not believe on the name of the only begotten Son of God, what I'm virtually
[00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:56.640]   doing is this.
[00:32:56.640 --> 00:33:04.280]   I am rejecting what God says about me in his law.
[00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:10.440]   The law of God calls upon us to love the Lord our God with all our heart and all our soul
[00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:17.880]   and all our mind and all our strength and to love our neighbor as ourself.
[00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:24.000]   The law of God calls me to live to the glory of God entirely and utterly and absolutely.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:30.840]   And it tells me quite plainly that if I don't, I'm condemned and I'm under the wrath of God.
[00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:36.320]   Now I say not to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ is to deny that and to dismiss it and
[00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:42.760]   to flout it and to reject it.
[00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:50.000]   How difficult it is to realize that we do that when we reject this gospel.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:56.240]   We are proclaiming if we reject this gospel that we know the truth about men.
[00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:58.880]   We stand up and we say, "No, we don't believe that at all."
[00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:00.840]   That's the sort of thing that people used to believe.
[00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:04.320]   We believe with our modern knowledge that if a man lives a good life and so on, that
[00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:06.320]   all is well.
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:10.720]   That just means, I say, that you're taking the law of God and throwing it on the ground
[00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:16.520]   and spitting upon it or throwing it into the fire and burning it.
[00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:18.480]   God's law.
[00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:22.200]   You know what happens to a man that does that with the law of the land.
[00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:26.640]   Well multiply that by infinity and you'll see the fate of a man who does that with God's
[00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:27.640]   law.
[00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:29.680]   But that's what unbelief means.
[00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:33.500]   We just stand up and we say, "We are not at all concerned about this.
[00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:38.040]   You talk about sin and you talk about judgment and you talk about heaven and about hell.
[00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:39.560]   I don't believe in any of it."
[00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:47.120]   Very well then, all I'm asking you to see is that you are deliberately flouting God's
[00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:53.840]   law and what he has revealed concerning himself and his view of men and the relationship between
[00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:58.120]   men and himself.
[00:34:58.120 --> 00:35:02.080]   Can there be anything more terrible than that?
[00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:06.640]   But listen to this, this is worse.
[00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:14.040]   Not to believe this gospel means that we are guilty of rejecting the testimony of God's
[00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:17.280]   only begotten Son.
[00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:19.880]   That's what he's saying here to Nicodemus, isn't it?
[00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:27.320]   He is condemned already because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten
[00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:30.120]   Son of God.
[00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:35.720]   Oh, that the Holy Spirit might enable me to make this point plain and clear.
[00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:40.200]   You see, what mankind doesn't realize tonight is this, that something unique has happened
[00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:42.880]   in the history of the whole human race.
[00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:45.040]   Nearly two thousand years ago it happened.
[00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:50.920]   There was a birth in Bethlehem and a babe was born such as the world had never seen.
[00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:53.800]   It wasn't just another babe coming into the world.
[00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:59.200]   It was the eternal Son of God entering into time, taking flesh unto him.
[00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:04.640]   The Word was made flesh and dwelt among us.
[00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:09.440]   I am not confronting you with the words of a man or the words of men, the greatest and
[00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:10.440]   the noblest.
[00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:16.920]   I am saying that here the Son of God, the only begotten Son of God, has been amongst
[00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:20.040]   us and has borne his witness and his testimony.
[00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:22.160]   That's what he was saying to Nicodemus.
[00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:27.000]   Now let me remind you of how he said it.
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.200]   You remember how he put it in the eleventh verse?
[00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:40.440]   "Verily, verily," he said, "I say unto thee, we speak that we do know and testify that
[00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:44.320]   we have seen, and you receive not our witness."
[00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:48.520]   "Man," he said, "don't you realize who I am?
[00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:50.000]   I am not just talking theory.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:54.360]   I am not just spinning out a web of my own philosophy.
[00:36:54.360 --> 00:37:01.440]   I am speaking that which I do know, and I am testifying that which I have seen."
[00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:03.560]   Listen to him putting it in the thirteenth verse.
[00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:09.560]   "No man hath ascended up into heaven but he that came down from heaven, even the Son
[00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:11.520]   of Man which is in heaven."
[00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:13.600]   Nicodemus, you are a master of Israel.
[00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:15.320]   You are a great religious teacher.
[00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:18.000]   Yes, but tell me, have you been into heaven?
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.040]   Have you looked over God's shoulder?
[00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:22.600]   Have you looked into the book of life and the book of the law?
[00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:24.080]   You are speaking secondhand.
[00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:25.080]   I have seen.
[00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:26.080]   I am a witness.
[00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:27.080]   I am a direct witness.
[00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:28.080]   I have come down from heaven.
[00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:29.080]   I am the Son of Man.
[00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:39.480]   I am the only begotten Son of God.
[00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:45.360]   And you and I, as we listen to this gospel, are listening to his witness and to his testimony.
[00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:49.560]   But listen, he goes on at the end of this chapter to put it still more clearly.
[00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:52.160]   It comes rarely in the words of John the Baptist.
[00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:54.960]   Listen to verse 31.
[00:37:54.960 --> 00:38:01.240]   "He that cometh from above," says John the Baptist about him, "is above all."
[00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:05.640]   You see, some of John's disciples were a little bit jealous on John's behalf.
[00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:09.640]   They said to him, "Are you going to let this other teacher take the crowd from you?"
[00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:15.040]   Listen, says John, "He must increase, but I must decrease.
[00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:18.400]   He that cometh from above is above all.
[00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:22.400]   He that is of the earth is earthly and speaketh of the earth.
[00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:29.840]   He that cometh from heaven is above all, and what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth,
[00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:33.000]   and no man receiveth his testimony.
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:44.200]   He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true."
[00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:50.760]   Could it possibly be put more clearly to us than that?
[00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:59.040]   In rejecting this gospel, we are rejecting the testimony of the only begotten Son of
[00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:00.040]   God.
[00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:03.640]   That is our claim.
[00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:04.640]   This is not a religion.
[00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:07.700]   The religions have been produced by men.
[00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:09.280]   This is the Son of God.
[00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:10.280]   This is revelation.
[00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:15.600]   God, who at sundry times and in divest menace spake in time past unto the fathers by the
[00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:24.520]   prophets, hath in these last days spoken unto us in his Son, the One who is the brightness
[00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:31.400]   of his image, of his glory, and the express image, the effulgence of his glory, the One
[00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:34.960]   who has made all things and who sustains all things.
[00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:40.080]   That is the One who is speaking.
[00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:44.880]   Do you see the enormity of rejecting this?
[00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:47.800]   Rejecting this, we do not reject the words and theories of men.
[00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:54.080]   We are hurling back into his face the testimony of the eternal Son of God.
[00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:57.560]   But come there is something even worse.
[00:39:57.560 --> 00:40:03.240]   If we reject him and his message, if we stand up and say, "I am not interested, I am not
[00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:06.200]   concerned," that is what a man says who is not a Christian.
[00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:09.320]   He says, "I am not interested in what happened two thousand years ago.
[00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:11.960]   I do not believe in your incarnation very well."
[00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:17.480]   You see, he is denying the most momentous event in history.
[00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:21.520]   But he is doing something even worse.
[00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:28.680]   He is not only rejecting the testimony of the Son of God, he is rejecting the testimony
[00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:31.560]   of God himself to his own Son.
[00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:37.600]   Had you realized this, let me quote these verses to you again.
[00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:44.240]   Here it is, you see, in this thirty-third verse, "He that hath received his testimony
[00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:50.080]   hath set to his seal that God is true."
[00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:55.400]   A man who believes in the Lord Jesus Christ, said John the Baptist, is putting his seal
[00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:58.600]   to God's testimony to his own Son.
[00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:03.240]   But listen to John putting it negatively in the first epistle, in that fifth chapter in
[00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:04.240]   the tenth verse.
[00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:05.760]   Do you remember how he put it there?
[00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:14.080]   Listen to this, "He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself.
[00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:26.080]   He that believeth not God hath made him a liar, because he believeth not the record
[00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:30.160]   that God gave of his Son."
[00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:35.040]   So if you reject this message, if you reject the Son of God, what you are doing is to say
[00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:39.400]   that God is a liar.
[00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:41.840]   Is there anything more terrible than that?
[00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:46.440]   That is why I use this term enormity, the enormity of sin.
[00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:52.400]   It makes God a liar, for God hath borne witness and testimony to his Son.
[00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:53.400]   How did he do it?
[00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:55.520]   Well, he did it in many ways.
[00:41:55.520 --> 00:42:01.520]   Do you remember what happened when our Lord was baptized by John the Baptist at the Jordan?
[00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:09.400]   There he was, apparently just a man, and he had submitted a baptism by John.
[00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:12.920]   But as he was just coming up out of the water, you remember what happened?
[00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:19.120]   The Holy Ghost descended upon him in the form of a dove, and a voice spake from heaven saying,
[00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:23.960]   "This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased."
[00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:29.080]   God is speaking from heaven, bearing witness and testimony to his Son.
[00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:30.680]   Do you believe God?
[00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:32.520]   Have you accepted his testimony?
[00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:35.640]   He says, "I have sent my Son for you."
[00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:38.960]   Have you believed him, or do you say he is a liar?
[00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:42.480]   It is one or the other.
[00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:47.480]   But he not only bore witness to him there in the descent of the Holy Ghost and in the
[00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:54.000]   voice he spoke again on the Mount of Transfiguration, but he went on bearing his witness and his
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:58.840]   testimony to him in enabling him to work the miracles that he worked.
[00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:04.000]   The Lord in almost desperation one afternoon turned to these incredulous Jews and said,
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:07.360]   "If you believe not me, believe the very works.
[00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:09.440]   Believe for the works' sake.
[00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:15.440]   If you do not believe my words," he said, "look what I am doing."
[00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:19.000]   And you know he even had to say something very similar, you remember, even to poor John
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:24.320]   the Baptist, who had been languishing in prison for months.
[00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:29.080]   And as the result of his physical infirmity and various other reasons, doubts had come
[00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:34.920]   into his mind, and he sent his two disciples to ask, "Art thou he that should come, or
[00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:37.240]   do we look for another?"
[00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:39.160]   You remember the reply?
[00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:47.240]   "Go," said our Lord to these two emissaries, "go and tell John again the things which he
[00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:54.240]   do see and hear, the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the
[00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:58.920]   deaf are made to hear, the very dead are raised, and the gospel is preached to the poor.
[00:43:58.920 --> 00:44:07.000]   There is the evidence, the miracles, the signs, the marks."
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:13.880]   That was God's way of giving his witness and bearing his testimony to his only begotten
[00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:23.680]   Son, and you and I finally have something on top of all this, the resurrection.
[00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:33.240]   The first truly to arise from amongst the dead, declared to be the Son of God with power
[00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:38.400]   according to the Spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead.
[00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:41.160]   My dear friend, let me hold it before you.
[00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:44.560]   God has borne his witness to his Son and to his words.
[00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:45.560]   Have you believed?
[00:44:45.560 --> 00:44:46.560]   Have you accepted?
[00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:49.160]   Don't you see that it means this if you don't?
[00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:51.000]   You are saying God is a liar?
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   It isn't true.
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:57.280]   There is no need to argue about it.
[00:44:57.280 --> 00:45:01.680]   Anybody who says that God is a liar is condemned already.
[00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:08.040]   But I leave you with this word.
[00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:19.360]   The enormity of sin is ultimately seen in this, that it means that a man who doesn't
[00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:31.680]   believe on the name of the only begotten Son of God is spurning and rejecting God's love
[00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:35.720]   and his wondrous way of salvation.
[00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:43.840]   God so loved the world.
[00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:52.200]   If you don't believe on him and on his message, it means that you turn your back upon his
[00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:55.560]   love.
[00:45:55.560 --> 00:46:05.560]   You say you are not interested, that it doesn't matter, that the Son left the courts of heaven
[00:46:05.560 --> 00:46:12.440]   and came here on earth and humbled and abased himself.
[00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:15.560]   It is nothing to you.
[00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:29.400]   Though he went to the shame and the suffering of the cross, you couldn't care less.
[00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:31.760]   I have got to put it very plainly.
[00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:40.120]   Either the death of the Son of God on the cross is the biggest thing in the world to
[00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:47.280]   you or else you don't believe it.
[00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:56.040]   Not to believe that, to ignore God's outpouring of his eternal heart of love.
[00:46:56.040 --> 00:47:04.480]   There is nothing to be said about it except that a man who is guilty of death is condemning
[00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:15.320]   himself, he is shutting himself outside the love of God, the only thing that can save
[00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:18.880]   him and rescue him and redeem him.
[00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:22.720]   Oh, my dear friend, have I made it plain to you?
[00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:27.600]   The enormity of unbelief, there is nothing finally more terrible.
[00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:38.440]   You are spurning everything that is most glorious and wondrous, even in God himself.
[00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:46.640]   There is nothing left but the bearing of the awful consequences.
[00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:49.680]   I don't want to leave you on that note.
[00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:54.800]   I ask you rather to look at him again, consider him.
[00:47:54.800 --> 00:48:01.800]   Look at this person who spoke to Nicodemus, listen to his words, listen to his authority,
[00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:09.080]   listen to all he said, look at him on the cross and see there the only begotten Son
[00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:19.160]   of God dying for you and for your sins to reconcile you to God and to open the gateway
[00:48:19.160 --> 00:48:20.160]   of heaven.
[00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:27.600]   Ah, but before you get to heaven, he will change everything for you in this world.
[00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:31.160]   You will know that blessed new birth.
[00:48:31.160 --> 00:48:33.440]   You will become a new man.
[00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:43.760]   You will see all things new and you will begin to enjoy the smile and the love of God.
[00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:53.080]   God forbid that anyone should go out of this service in unbelief.
[00:48:53.080 --> 00:48:58.920]   Amen.
[00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:02.560]   Have you believed on him?
[00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:12.000]   If you haven't until this night, tell him so now and thank him and ask him to enable
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:20.320]   you to love him as you ought.
[00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:30.040]   And now may the grace of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship
[00:49:30.040 --> 00:49:39.200]   and the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now this night throughout
[00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:49.040]   the remainder of this short uncertain earthly life and pilgrimage and evermore.
[00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:51.360]   Amen.
[00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:55.280]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
