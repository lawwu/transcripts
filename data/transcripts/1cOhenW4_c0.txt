[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.980]   Guys, we did it.
[00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.420]   We lined up our first guest
[00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.780]   and we have our first shoot here in a couple of days.
[00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.500]   It's gonna be with Paul Patron.
[00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.100]   He and I used to work together at LinkedIn.
[00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.420]   He's an awesome guy, a great storyteller
[00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.180]   and a very empathetic individual.
[00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.640]   So, basically the exact person we're looking for, right?
[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.340]   Should be really fun.
[00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.580]   Another reason why I picked him was just because
[00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.800]   I know that the vibe will be good,
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.960]   that we can jibba jabba off one another.
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.720]   And so, hopefully the conversation can feel natural
[00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.180]   and organic and great.
[00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:47.160]   We had a pre-call yesterday.
[00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.800]   It was 30 minutes and it was opportunity for me to, again,
[00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.040]   get on the same page with him,
[00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.040]   kind of walk through the flow.
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.040]   But more importantly,
[00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.560]   I wanna understand what he cared about.
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.800]   Is there anything that he really wants me to bring up
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.080]   that he can kind of lean into or whatnot?
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.440]   And he definitely gave me some things, which is great.
[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.520]   And I kind of helped him remind him also
[00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.080]   the things that I wanna kind of cover.
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.160]   So, as we have organic conversations,
[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.700]   at least we're kind of aligned to the flow of stuff.
[00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:20.260]   I do not know if he's gonna be recording this from his room,
[00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:25.960]   from an office, from the, in a conference room.
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.520]   I have no idea where he's gonna be.
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.720]   So, I can't control his lighting situation,
[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:33.840]   his acoustic or whatever.
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.000]   So, all I could do is say,
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.360]   hey, look, from a clothing perspective,
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.060]   like try not to any weird crazy patterns.
[00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.480]   Yeah, we'll see.
[00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:48.060]   I think when we start filming, excuse me,
[00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.700]   I'm probably gonna take the first five minutes
[00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.640]   just to kind of hear audio and make him sit close enough.
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.760]   I think that I do want him to be closer, ideally,
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.600]   like this much gap in the top of the screen.
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:00.480]   Like, who knows?
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.600]   We'll figure that out.
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.680]   I'm trying to figure out the tone of these videos
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.560]   and the look and feel of it.
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.280]   I like this kind of this podcast presentation.
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.800]   I don't know if that works
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.260]   in a one-to-one interview situation.
[00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.480]   Like if he's talking directly to the camera
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.520]   and I'm talking like this, is that weird?
[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.000]   Should the mic be gone
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.720]   and should I just be talking to him straight on?
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:34.160]   So, I think I'm gonna make a decision right now
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.300]   and I may regret this.
[00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.600]   I'm gonna maybe hide the camera from view.
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.080]   And so, it might be more straight on conversation.
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.800]   So, it looks more like we do expect on a Zoom call
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.100]   since we'll be using Zoom.
[00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.120]   I don't know.
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.680]   We'll have to revisit that one.
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.000]   I think as I go through these videos,
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.900]   the styles may change and evolve over time.
[00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.080]   And so, that'll be something.
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.240]   I scheduled an hour and a half for a call.
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.720]   I don't think we'll use an hour and a half.
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.280]   I think we'll probably use just an hour,
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.160]   maybe in 45 minutes.
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.680]   I legit feel bad putting an hour and a half block
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.840]   on this calendar 'cause when you see that
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.480]   in your Google Calendar, it looks like a big block.
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.200]   And I was like, oh man, that looks,
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.720]   that almost looks like a full day kind of a situation.
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.680]   But I'm gonna do that for now just in case.
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:25.840]   It's my first one.
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.440]   If I have any like technical snafus,
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.100]   I have time to kind of rectify that.
[00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.600]   But I think in the future,
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.720]   keeping it to an hour is probably the way to go.
[00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.320]   And it's just an hour and a half, just kind of crazy.
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.800]   I'm also leaving myself time at the end
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.760]   to do some quick fast fire questions.
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.280]   I wanted to have some B-roll,
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.400]   some fun videos like behind the scenes.
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.720]   And so, I have 10 questions I'm gonna be throwing his way.
[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.200]   I just try to think of some stuff
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.040]   that were really fun.
[00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.000]   And so like the one of them was like,
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.720]   all right, you're on a deserted island.
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.420]   You have two choices.
[00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:58.920]   Do you bring someone with you
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.560]   and you can bring any item of your choice?
[00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.740]   Or do you go alone and you bring five items of your choice?
[00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:08.520]   I don't know what he's gonna do.
[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.960]   I think for people who are extroverted,
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.920]   they might wanna have a companion.
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.360]   I'm naturally introverted, so no disrespect to my wife.
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:19.400]   I think I'm gonna go alone
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.320]   and I'm gonna bring five items of my choice
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.920]   of which one of them is probably something
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.420]   that allows me to create fire, like a flint or something.
[00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.920]   But anyways, it'll be fun.
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.280]   I think personality will come out.
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.840]   And so that'll be very fun.
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.840]   So yeah, I'll let you know how this goes.
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.640]   I got a few days to prep.
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.400]   I did prep something like 30 to 40 questions.
[00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.260]   There's no way I'm gonna go through all of those,
[00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.600]   but I think it was good exercise for me
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.240]   because I had to be smart and I need to get...
[00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.200]   I wanna ask smart questions.
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.480]   I use ChatGPT to kind of help me brainstorm.
[00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.360]   But I think ultimately I wanna ask
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.400]   maybe the four or five smart questions
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.440]   out of the 30 or 20 garbage ones out there.
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.040]   So garbage ones probably being my ideas,
[00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.160]   not necessarily ChatGPT.
[00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.120]   ChatGPT is quite amazing, actually.
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.760]   I ask questions like...
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:12.880]   So I know his job titles,
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.680]   like he's a content marketer, for example.
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.960]   So I was like, what do content marketing people care about?
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.000]   Or questions to ask content marketers on a podcast.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.920]   That was literally one of my thing.
[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.000]   And it's been some stuff, and I was like,
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.680]   oh, well, thankfully I already had most of those on my list,
[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.880]   so I'm kind of on the right path.
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.440]   But then I would say, oh, maybe I refine that
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.600]   by adding a qualifier like blog writing,
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:36.000]   or how do you advise someone being a content marketer
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.640]   who is not traditionally a content marketer?
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:39.480]   Those kind of questions came up.
[00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:43.000]   So again, it added a few questions to me,
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.760]   more so it helped me reaffirm
[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.560]   or reword some of my existing questions.
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.200]   But it was great.
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.920]   It also let me just get smarter about his field.
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:55.280]   So I'm thankful for this era of AI.
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.400]   It just, it boosts productivity a lot.
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.720]   I think I'll be leaning that a lot,
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:02.840]   especially looking at my roadmap of interviews,
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.080]   and they are gonna be topics
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.000]   that I have a lot less familiarity with.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   And so I'll definitely be glad to have any resources I can.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.880]   Cool, all right, this is where I'm at right now.
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.240]   Next time you see me,
[00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.080]   my first shot should be done.
[00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:18.880]   See you guys later.
