[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   Welcome, everyone.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.200]   This short screencast is an overview of the experiment protocol document.
[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.320]   This is the second document on your way to the final paper.
[00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.080]   It's a somewhat unusual document,
[00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.840]   but I think it's really important in terms of helping you and your teammates and
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.500]   your mentor get complete clarity on what you're going to achieve for the final paper.
[00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.400]   The rationale at high level is the same as the one for the lit review.
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.780]   It's about productive dialogue.
[00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:33.480]   We want you in productive dialogue with your teammates and with yourself and
[00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.300]   with your mentor about the scope of the project and its overall goals.
[00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.700]   We want you to identify the core questions you'll be addressing at this stage.
[00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.840]   We want you to identify your core methods, that is, data, models, metrics, and everything
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.460]   that goes along with that.
[00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.980]   And maybe most importantly for this phase, we want you to identify obstacles and propose
[00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.380]   some workarounds.
[00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.960]   The more the merrier in terms of uncovering these things that are threatening the convergence
[00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:01.960]   of the project.
[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.140]   If we can identify these things at this stage, we can probably find really productive workarounds.
[00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.560]   But as it gets closer and closer to the final paper deadline, it becomes harder and harder
[00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.720]   to get these things to converge in a happy way.
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.160]   The requirements are linked from the course website.
[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.340]   You can see the link at the top here.
[00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.580]   Let me just offer a quick rundown.
[00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:28.100]   This is a short, structured report that is establishing your core experimental framework
[00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.660]   and kind of talking about it.
[00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.020]   I emphasize short.
[00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.260]   They can get long if you have a lot of obstacles or points of uncertainty, but by and large,
[00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.120]   if things are going well, we expect this to be a short document.
[00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.660]   We do specify that the max is eight pages, but I'll say that the norm is for them to
[00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.140]   be shorter than that.
[00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.920]   We have, as before, an optional Overleaf template.
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.060]   This is just derived from the ACL templates.
[00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.580]   We encourage you to use it, but it is not required at this stage.
[00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.220]   And then we come to the required pieces.
[00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.060]   I mentioned these in the lit review overview.
[00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:05.920]   We want you to now to state your core hypothesis or hypotheses as clearly as possible.
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.380]   We want you to talk about what data resources that you're going to use and any limitations,
[00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.460]   access limitations, producing data is a big limitation, anything that might threaten the
[00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.620]   need that you have for data.
[00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:18.700]   Metrics.
[00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:19.700]   This is important.
[00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.460]   If it's a standard sort of classification problem, it might be a very short thing that
[00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:29.060]   you report, like you say, macro F1, but if you're working on a specialized problem or
[00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.020]   inventing your own metrics, this might be a more detailed discussion.
[00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.540]   Models of course, or architectures.
[00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.640]   We want to know about the baselines that you plan, the comparison points, the ablations,
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.760]   all of that stuff, and we would like to see how it keys into the core hypotheses you listed
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.700]   in 4A.
[00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.760]   And then the general reasoning, how does the project come together?
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.560]   How do the data and the models and the metrics connect with the hypothesis?
[00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:01.100]   I think that's the most important thing, most powerful thing to convey at that point.
[00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.900]   And then a summary of progress so far.
[00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.700]   I emphasize you are not required to have any results at this stage.
[00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:13.060]   It could be purely a planning document, but if you do have results, it's great to report
[00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.060]   them.
[00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.720]   It means that you've got a minimal viable project and we can start to build on whatever
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.940]   insights those results have offered.
[00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:21.940]   But it's not required.
[00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.260]   But we would like to know what you've done so far.
[00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.240]   Even if it's just assembling the raw ingredients, let us know.
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.460]   If you've run some experiments and you got stuck, that's an obstacle that we'll want
[00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:32.940]   to identify.
[00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.000]   That is the spirit of this progress report.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.740]   It's not evaluative in terms of us giving you a grade based on how far along you are.
[00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:41.740]   Quite the contrary.
[00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:46.860]   It is entirely evaluated based on the extent to which you can give us a clear insight into
[00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.740]   how you're doing for this project.
[00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:53.540]   And then finally, as always, a required references section.
[00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:58.580]   In terms of tips, I would say first, there's no particular length we have in mind.
[00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:04.200]   A short or a long rubric could be bad or good depending on the state of your project and
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.460]   what you're trying to achieve.
[00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:08.820]   So completely open-minded about that.
[00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:13.060]   As I said before, please try to call out concerns you have, even if they are distant ones.
[00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.880]   This is meant to be a last chance to make sure the project will converge in the time
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:17.880]   allotted.
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.580]   So you might as well err on the side of more disclosures.
[00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:25.220]   Yes, you need to be able to state a hypothesis.
[00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:30.500]   It is common for engineers to come to me and say, but I don't have a hypothesis.
[00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.500]   All I want to do is see whether this model is a good model for my problem.
[00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.260]   And I say to them, that is a hypothesis.
[00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.500]   Just state that as a claim about what you think will work.
[00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.140]   And that will actually guide us intellectually and also guide us in terms of choosing baselines
[00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:49.460]   and ablation studies and other things that will give us insight into whether you're right
[00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.740]   about this thing that you feel about this model that you're evaluating.
[00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.480]   No, you do not need to report results, as I said before.
[00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.580]   But they are very welcome because they're a sign that you've kind of got all the working
[00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:06.720]   pieces in place and the project machine is functioning.
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.100]   We want you to have a full working pipeline as soon as possible.
[00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:13.980]   It is, I confess, tempting to insist on initial results so that that pipeline would be in
[00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:14.980]   place.
[00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:16.060]   I think that's premature.
[00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:21.060]   But the spirit of this is that we want you basically to be at a state where any day you
[00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.020]   could submit a project.
[00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:24.220]   It would be a working project.
[00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:27.380]   It might not be the one that you envisioned, but you could submit it.
[00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:31.540]   Once you get to that point, it's a really happy state in which you're mainly just adding
[00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:36.380]   new experimental results, improving the reporting, adding analyses and other things that allow
[00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:39.580]   you to build a really fleshed out project.
[00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:45.500]   So get that minimal viable project in the bag soon so that you can do creative exploration
[00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:49.940]   without feeling like you're under a lot of undue pressure.
[00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:54.140]   For other tips and resources, I have a very large markdown document that covers lots of
[00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:55.140]   things.
[00:05:55.140 --> 00:06:00.740]   FAQs that I've seen in the past, discussions of each one of the documents that's associated
[00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:05.900]   with the final project work, examples of past final papers that have gone on after some
[00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:09.700]   work to be publications, and a whole lot else besides.
[00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:14.620]   So if you feel like you just need some guidance on crucial points about how to develop a project
[00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.260]   in the space, I highly recommend this document.
[00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.700]   I think it's got lots of good stuff in it.
[00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:24.380]   And if your paper goes on to be a publication, I would love to hear about it.
[00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:29.300]   Drop me a note and I will, with your permission, add that to the list of published papers stemming
[00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:30.300]   from work for this course.
[00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:33.540]   I'm very proud of how long and diverse that list is.
[00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:43.540]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
