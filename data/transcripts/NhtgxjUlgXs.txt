[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.960]   I think there's a real question mark on this company over the medium to long term,
[00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.680]   and I think it's best represented in this graphic. Starbucks is a sugar company. For example,
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:16.400]   a caramel macchiato, 32 grams of sugar. A mocha frappuccino, 60 grams of sugar. This is three
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:22.080]   times what you're supposed to have as a human in a day. And these products also average 400 to 500
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:29.600]   calories per drink. So the real issue is that more consumers, as they question the repercussions of
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:35.280]   consuming a lot of sugar, what will they do as more consumers get on GLP-1s? What will they do
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.800]   as more people think about the fact that fat was never an enemy? In fact, fats are actually really
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.360]   good for you. What will consumers do? And I think that's a really big strategic question mark,
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.880]   because the company has to embrace where the world is going. The world is going away from sugar.
