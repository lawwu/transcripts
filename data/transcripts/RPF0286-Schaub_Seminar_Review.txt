[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Today on Radical Personal Finance, I'm going to share with you a review of John Schaub's
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.920]   Building Wealth One House at a Time of a seminar.
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.160]   Recently I had the opportunity to go to it, spent two days there at the seminar.
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.960]   I'll share with you the outline of the seminar, some of the things that I learned and my impressions
[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.200]   and feedback as to whether or not this might be something that you should consider going
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.200]   to.
[00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:42.160]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.880]   My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host.
[00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.160]   Thank you for being with me.
[00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:51.480]   We talk real estate, love the seminar, love John's plan.
[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.600]   It's a plan I'm pursuing as I talked about on a recent show.
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.560]   I'm going to share with you some of the reasons why, but I'm also going to tell you why would
[00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.280]   a guy sell his house and talk about why there are myths of home ownership and then turn
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.480]   around and want to get right back into real estate investing.
[00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:16.720]   When you think about it, that'll probably be some of the more interesting part of the
[00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:17.720]   show.
[00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.560]   I will answer that question, although I can do it here in one sentence.
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:21.920]   It's very simple.
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.680]   Houses are personal consumption items.
[00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.440]   They are not investments.
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.840]   Everything that I said about real estate was related to houses as a personal consumption
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:30.840]   item.
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:37.040]   Basically, all of the flaws that I talked about were flaws of – well, many of them
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.560]   were the flaws of viewing a house as an investment, as a wise financial move.
[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:48.560]   The end of the day, when it comes to a place to live, if you view a house as a consumption
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.960]   item, as a luxury lifestyle decision, nothing wrong with that.
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.800]   We all need a place to live and I think for many people, a major goal that many people
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.520]   have is to live in a luxurious house.
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.000]   Now how you define luxury is up to you, but that really is the case.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.680]   But when we talk about investing, they're night and day.
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.000]   So I'll cover that more in a little bit though.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:17.280]   But last weekend, I went to John Schaub's Building Wealth One House at a Time seminar.
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.920]   This comes – it's a seminar that's related to a book that he has written called Building
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.700]   Wealth One House at a Time.
[00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:23.700]   Book has been out.
[00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:24.700]   It's been updated a few times.
[00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.640]   He's coming out with a new version of the book, I believe this summer.
[00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:33.320]   And so when he releases that, I'll have him back on the show to talk about that personally.
[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.960]   But we've interviewed him in the past on Radical Personal Finance and that was a great
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:37.960]   interview.
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:42.720]   He shared a lot of the strategy that he follows and pursues and a lot of his personal story.
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.520]   If you'd like to go back and listen to it, it was episode 119 of the show.
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.000]   I will put a link in the show notes for today's show.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.240]   You can go back and hear that episode.
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.920]   But Schaub is one of my favorite real estate guys.
[00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:01.400]   I shared in the past that I got involved in the real estate guru world about ten years
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.400]   ago.
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.520]   What's interesting is since that time, there have been real estate market crashes and recession
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.960]   and all kinds of issues.
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.400]   When you go through times of recession, you can find out who are the people who know what
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.320]   they're doing and know what they're talking about and who are the people who are just
[00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.760]   talking about what they think they want you to think that they know what they're talking
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:22.800]   about.
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.920]   As the axiom goes, when the tide goes out, you can see who was swimming naked.
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.120]   Unfortunately, that's what happens with real estate gurus.
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:36.080]   There's so many just total frauds out there and there are so many of them in the real
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.080]   estate space.
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.960]   A suggestion to you, if you're reading a book written by a real estate guru, the first place
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:47.640]   that you should go is to John T. Reed's website and look at his guru ratings and read what
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.440]   he has to say about that guru.
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.920]   That should be the very first thing that you should do.
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.680]   I will also link that up in the show notes for today if you are not familiar with those
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.920]   ratings with the work that John T. Reed does.
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.080]   There are many systems and many ways of investing in real estate.
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.680]   John Schaub's approach that he teaches in Building Wealth One House at a Time is not
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.880]   for everybody.
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.180]   There are dozens of approaches.
[00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.420]   You could be a house flipper, buying properties and reselling them.
[00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:18.700]   You could be a rehabber.
[00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.320]   You could work in commercial rentals.
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.600]   You can rent out trailer parks.
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.520]   You can invest in tax liens.
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.320]   There are dozens and dozens of niches and specialties in real estate.
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:35.800]   If somebody says, "Oh, I'm a real estate investor," your spider sense should go up a little bit
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:36.800]   and say, "Well, wait a second.
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.800]   What kind of real estate investor are you?"
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.560]   Because there are very, very specialized types of real estate.
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.920]   But what appeals to me about John Schaub's system is the fact that it's an appropriate
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:52.040]   scale and appropriate system for what I'm looking for personally.
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:56.280]   I do not want to operate a real estate business.
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:02.720]   My business is radical personal finance and that is what I want to serve as the primary
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.280]   economic engine and driver of my financial life.
[00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.680]   That's the business that I want to have and that I want to run.
[00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:14.480]   However, I also need to be busy with investing.
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.840]   Good for me to invest into my business.
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.520]   That's likely where the highest returns are going to come and I'm investing into my business
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.360]   and I will continue to do so.
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:30.040]   However, it would be a poor decision of mine if I were to put everything into my business.
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:33.240]   That would be a bad asset allocation decision.
[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.200]   This is one of the things that entrepreneurs often do is they often invest everything into
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:42.320]   their business and they keep investing everything in their business and that leaves them vulnerable
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.720]   to things that could happen.
[00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.880]   Now, I don't know what those things are.
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:52.820]   I don't know if I could fall into a situation where all of a sudden some laws or rules change
[00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:54.740]   and now my content is meaningless.
[00:05:54.740 --> 00:06:00.400]   I could say something that angers 90% of my audience and nobody wants to listen to me
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.400]   anymore.
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:06.800]   I could wind up being sick or hurt and not be able to come and do the show every day.
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.460]   If that were to happen at the moment, my business would fall apart because everything is built
[00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.340]   upon me continuing to do it.
[00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:18.560]   If I were to focus everything on my business, I don't have any backup plans.
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.520]   I need an investment plan.
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:25.440]   Now, in the past, I've shared with you about some of the different challenges I've had
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:27.360]   with figuring out an investment plan.
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:31.520]   I've looked hard and fast at different options for me and I've had to figure out what is
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:38.000]   an appropriate investment plan that fits where I'm at, fits my skills, fits my inclinations
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.520]   and fits the scale, the amount of capital that I have to invest.
[00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:43.520]   That's a big decision.
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:50.560]   So, when you get into the world of real estate, Shab's system is, for me, perfect at this
[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:52.560]   point of my life.
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.080]   His system – let me just lay it out.
[00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:56.080]   I don't want to beat around the bush.
[00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:58.200]   Let me just lay it out for you.
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:05.120]   He teaches his students to go out and simply focus on buying one rental house each year
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:11.080]   until they have enough rental houses owned to be able to supply all of their economic
[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.480]   goals and all of their income goals.
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:17.360]   Right in the very beginning of his seminar, he talks about the meaning of building wealth
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.840]   one house at a time and he says, "Why houses?"
[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:22.080]   His reasons, number one, there's plenty of opportunity.
[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:23.840]   There's lots of houses.
[00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:27.720]   Number two, houses are little deals that can be bought with little down and little
[00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:28.880]   risk.
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:33.200]   So you can survive any mistakes that you make in a deal.
[00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:38.400]   Bankers like houses for collateral, so financing is generally available at lower costs and
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.840]   better terms than commercial loans.
[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:43.600]   The tenants of houses stay longer than apartment tenants.
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:46.100]   You're dealing with a different type of tenant.
[00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:50.880]   Houses are easier to sell at close to a retail price for cash than other types of property
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:56.720]   and many buyers are interested in buying on terms that can be profitable to you as a seller.
[00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:02.920]   So he teaches to buy houses, not land, not apartments, not trailer parks, but houses
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:04.040]   and a certain type of house.
[00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:09.800]   One of the big things that he focuses on is finding and investing in rental houses that
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:15.160]   are squarely in the middle class market.
[00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:19.660]   So you want a house that's big enough to fit a family and their things.
[00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:24.680]   Buy a three-bedroom house that has either a garage or a basement, at least a three-bedroom
[00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:27.680]   house that has a garage or basement, a place for stuff.
[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:33.160]   You want normal houses, good construction quality in quiet, well-maintained neighborhoods
[00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:38.100]   on streets that have more owners than renters with lots that are appropriate and adequate
[00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:42.540]   for the needs of a family that are near popular schools, that are close to employment centers
[00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:47.120]   and shopping, and you put together deals that can produce an acceptable cash flow for you
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:49.360]   that you can buy at a bargain price.
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:53.960]   And this helps you to solve one of the major problems of real estate, which is finding
[00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:56.600]   and attracting the perfect tenants.
[00:08:56.600 --> 00:09:00.760]   John teaches in his seminar that you want a house that will attract a perfect tenant,
[00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:05.980]   and a perfect tenant is a tenant who stays forever, who pays early, who never calls,
[00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:09.480]   and who fixes everything.
[00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:16.120]   That's not necessarily a normal rental tenant, but with John's experience and his story,
[00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:18.400]   that's his normal rental tenant.
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:22.920]   And if they're not, then he fixes the situation so that they are.
[00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:28.720]   That's the fundamental premise, and the idea is to build a house investment plan that is
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:29.720]   passive.
[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:38.000]   The goal is to have a passive investment plan, not an active real estate business.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.560]   To me, that's important because I don't want to get into the business of actively flipping
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:43.560]   real estate.
[00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:48.380]   I don't want to get into the business where I'm looking for passive investments in the
[00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:50.880]   real – that happen to be through the context of real estate.
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:56.000]   In a moment, I'll talk about the advantages of real estate, of why it can be such an attractive
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.880]   financial opportunity, and I'll also go through some of the financial results of John's
[00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:05.520]   plan, if you just buy one house a year.
[00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:10.040]   And then I'll also talk about his rules for investing, and then we'll go in-depth
[00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:11.040]   on the seminar.
[00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:14.800]   Before I go into that, I want to talk about the sponsor for this half hour of the show
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:16.000]   is Trade King.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.400]   Trade King is the official brokerage company sponsor of Radical Personal Finance.
[00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:29.620]   Awesome company, very inexpensive trades, $4.95 stock trades, very high quality level
[00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:31.300]   of education and information.
[00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:34.380]   The best thing that I love about Trade King is I've been in their offices.
[00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:37.180]   I've met their CEO on multiple occasions.
[00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:40.740]   I've looked them straight in the face, and I've been able to get a sense of who they
[00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:44.980]   are as a company and how much they work to serve you, the client.
[00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:50.380]   I've been in their call room standing next to their customer service reps as they're
[00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:53.740]   working there to solve customer service issues.
[00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:57.860]   Today we're talking about real estate, and real estate can be a tremendous way of investing.
[00:10:57.860 --> 00:10:59.460]   However, it is not the only way.
[00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:03.100]   It's not the perfect way, and there are major advantages and disadvantages that real
[00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:04.100]   estate faces.
[00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:06.220]   For example, listen to what I just said.
[00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:10.380]   Trade King will do trades for you, $4.95 a trade.
[00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:14.820]   Every single real estate transaction is going to be way, way more expensive than that.
[00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:16.860]   Think of all the costs involved in closing your real estate.
[00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:19.100]   You're talking big dollar amounts.
[00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:20.100]   It's hard to figure out.
[00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:25.200]   There are a couple ways in real estate you can do it with tax liens and bundled instruments,
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:28.980]   but it's hard to figure out how to invest in real estate for a couple thousand bucks.
[00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:33.780]   But you can put some trades in place on a stock trade, whether that's direct purchases
[00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:36.100]   or whether that's setting up options trades.
[00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:41.220]   You can do that with a couple thousand bucks, and if your trades are well chosen, you can
[00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:44.740]   do very well with your rate of return.
[00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:49.660]   When you get a cost of $4.95, it's hard to beat those costs.
[00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:53.100]   The other great thing about stock investing and a disadvantage of real estate, real estate
[00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:55.020]   is much less liquid than stocks.
[00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:58.220]   With stocks, you can hit sell and your stocks can be sold.
[00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:01.980]   With real estate, one of the major things that John Seminar was trying to talk about
[00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:07.620]   ways to sell more quickly at close to retail value, but it is certainly not as easy to
[00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:12.820]   do – sell a real estate property as quickly and easily as it is a stock.
[00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:16.920]   So if you'd like to open a brokerage account, if you have an IRA or a Roth IRA, or if you
[00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:22.340]   have a stock account at another firm and you'd like to get low-cost trades and also really
[00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:25.580]   great customer service, consider transitioning to Trade King.
[00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:30.600]   If you use the special Radical Personal Finance referral link, that helps them to track you
[00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:33.340]   as a customer, but you get a $100 bonus for doing that.

[00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:38.640]   get a $100 bonus from them.
[00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:43.440]   So if this is the year that you'd like to start experimenting with trading, consider
[00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:51.540]   going to TradeKing.com/radical, go to TradeKing.com/radical, open an account and get an extra $100 courtesy
[00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:56.820]   of – well, it's courtesy of Trade King, but courtesy of Radical Personal Finance to
[00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:59.020]   fund your account and let me know how you do this year.
[00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:00.380]   There might be some opportunities.
[00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:04.860]   Volatility might be a good time for some of you to really be trading well.
[00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:11.400]   So on John's one house a year plan, I'm just going to read one page to you from the
[00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:15.940]   workbook from the course and it's as simple as this.
[00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:20.240]   Quoting from the book, "For more than 30 years, I have suggested to beginning and seasoned
[00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:27.380]   investors alike that they simply but consistently buy one house a year as an investment.
[00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:32.340]   The result of steadily buying through all types of markets spreads your risk and allows
[00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:35.900]   you to learn the business and make better deals over the years.
[00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:40.820]   As the houses increase in value, you can increase your cash flow by selling some and paying
[00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:42.140]   off the rest.
[00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:46.140]   Or as the following example shows, just sell your weaker houses and replace them with better
[00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:49.220]   houses, keeping some cash for yourself.
[00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:50.340]   Here are the rules.
[00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:55.260]   Buy one house a year using John's advanced 10-10-10 rule.
[00:13:55.260 --> 00:14:03.780]   10-10-10 rule is buy at least 10% below the market, pay no more than 10% down on the property,
[00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:08.380]   and produce a 10% cash flow return on your down payment."
[00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:12.660]   Just a side note here, that rule used to be pay no more than 10% interest.
[00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:14.460]   That was in the past when interest rates were much higher.
[00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:20.940]   He modified that rule to be this one, "Produce a 10% cash flow return on your down payment.
[00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:25.220]   Hold on to the houses until the first one doubles in value, and then sell the first
[00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:30.420]   house you bought and buy a replacement house," again, using the 10-10-10 rule.
[00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:34.780]   And what's so amazing is in the beginning of the seminar, John doesn't start his seminar
[00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:37.540]   with a lot of motivation, a lot of talk.
[00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:42.500]   Many real estate seminars, especially the bad ones, are all motivation, all hype, all
[00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:43.620]   pictures of riches.
[00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:44.920]   Look at the lifestyle you can live.
[00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:45.920]   Look at that.
[00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:46.920]   He doesn't do that.
[00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:48.380]   His seminar is very practical.
[00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:49.580]   It's very tangible.
[00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:52.680]   But he does have one page right at the front where he says, "Here are the potential results
[00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:57.740]   of buying one house a year," and I'll share them with you because this example could really
[00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:01.220]   be life-changing for some of you.
[00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:03.380]   It really could be.
[00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:11.700]   And so as an example, let's say that you start with an initial house with a fair market value
[00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:14.440]   of about $180,000.
[00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:19.460]   So this would vary depending on market, but remember, we're going with middle-class housing,
[00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:22.020]   houses that you and I would want to live in.
[00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:23.060]   That's the goal.
[00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:33.860]   That's the type of house that we want to own because we want to attract the type of tenants
[00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:39.180]   that will stay and be there for a long time and pay us consistently and never call.
[00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:41.620]   So you want to buy a house that's worth $180,000.
[00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:46.580]   Well, if the house is worth $180,000, remember, you're not going to pay $180,000.
[00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:50.460]   Your maximum purchase price is 90% of that, which would be $162,000.
[00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:54.260]   You've got to buy 10% under market.
[00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:58.240]   Next, you're going to make a down payment of no more than 10%.
[00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:04.220]   So you're going to put a down payment of no more than $16,000 into that property.
[00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:08.920]   That means your original loan balance would be $146,000.
[00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:12.820]   Under this example, let's say that you finance it at 5% for 30 years.
[00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:17.420]   That would mean that your principal and interest payment is $783.
[00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:24.300]   Then you hold the house until it doubles in value, so let's say about $400,000.
[00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:26.980]   Who knows how long it will take for the house to double in value?
[00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:30.540]   This is one of the most interesting things about John because he's been an investor for
[00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:32.220]   over 40 years.
[00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:36.020]   He's seen many of his houses double in value multiple times.
[00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:39.100]   He's got the benefit of hindsight.
[00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:42.260]   But sell the house when it doubles in value, $400,000.
[00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:45.980]   Assume for a moment that it takes 10 years for that house to double in value.
[00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:52.040]   Well, if that were the case, then your loan balance at that time would be about $120,000.
[00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:58.700]   You would sell the house, pay off the loan for $120,000, and you would net $280,000 cash.
[00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:03.860]   Well, you have to replace that house, so you go out and you replace a house that's in that
[00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:07.180]   $350,000 to $400,000 price range.
[00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:11.140]   Let's say that you buy it for $300,000, about 10% below the market.
[00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:17.660]   You need $30,000 on the down payment, and you wind up netting off of that house $250,000
[00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:22.900]   before taxes of cash in your pocket, and you've gone ahead and replaced your rental house.
[00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:26.720]   Now obviously those are round numbers and it's just an illustration, but it's a pretty
[00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:27.720]   good illustration.
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:31.500]   What's remarkable though, at the bottom of the page John has you do a little bit of math.
[00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:37.060]   If you did that, one house under those rules each year for the next 10 years, after 10
[00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:41.380]   years, you would own approximately $4 million in real estate.
[00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:46.340]   You would have approximately $2 million of debt in mortgages on that real estate, and
[00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:50.820]   your equity would be about $2 million.
[00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:59.620]   I repeat, if you bought one house a year using that formula each year for 10 years, under
[00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:04.460]   those assumptions, you would own about $4 million in real estate.
[00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:08.940]   You would have about $2 million in mortgages, and you would have about $2 million of equity
[00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:11.700]   in the properties.
[00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:13.580]   Now that's remarkable.
[00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:19.420]   You can figure out whether you buy the assumptions or not.
[00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:20.420]   Is it 10 years?
[00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:21.420]   Is it 12 years?
[00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:22.420]   Who knows?
[00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:24.460]   Does it take 10 years for a house to double in value, 15 years for a house to double in
[00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:25.460]   value?
[00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:27.020]   You can argue that stuff endlessly.
[00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:29.820]   Go find a real estate forum and talk about that.
[00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:35.060]   Conceptually though, think about how powerful that is as a wealth building tool.
[00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:40.340]   The reason that it's so powerful is because the fundamental premise of this type of real
[00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:48.300]   estate investing is that your tenants pay off your debt.
[00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:52.900]   As the saying in real estate goes, the quickest way to become rich is go out, borrow a million
[00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:57.140]   dollars, and then let your tenants pay it off for you.
[00:18:57.140 --> 00:19:01.420]   It's obviously not as clear as a simple investment because you're involved in the work.
[00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:03.220]   This is where the business comes in.
[00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:06.980]   You have to be involved in finding the potential deals.
[00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:08.060]   That takes work.
[00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:09.060]   It takes effort.
[00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:13.420]   Then you have to be involved in managing the property, which is basically it's a part-time
[00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:14.420]   business.
[00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:16.340]   You have to be involved.
[00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:19.500]   Those two things can sink many potential real estate investors.
[00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:24.020]   Number one, some people aren't willing or aren't able to go out and do the work of finding
[00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:25.180]   the deals.
[00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:29.260]   You may have to look at hundreds of potential properties until you find a deal that works.
[00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:33.580]   You may have to discard plenty until you find a deal that works.
[00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:38.100]   Many people aren't going to be involved in the deal – in the management of properties.
[00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:41.940]   They don't want to deal with the toilets and the tenants and the turnover.
[00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:47.380]   But if you can solve those problems, if you are willing to be involved in the management
[00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:52.880]   of the properties and if you are able to put in the time and the work to find the properties,
[00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:57.780]   you can produce tremendous wealth from your part-time business.
[00:19:57.780 --> 00:20:04.580]   For many people who are working at a job and looking for a side business, for many people
[00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:11.600]   this type of real estate business is a much better type of part-time endeavor to be involved
[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:17.860]   in than a brick and mortar business or than a part-time extra job.
[00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:22.480]   Now, if you need cash quickly, then this is not the strategy for you.
[00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:26.900]   If you need cash to pay off credit card debt, then you should go and deliver the proverbial
[00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:28.160]   pizzas.
[00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:33.440]   But if you're looking for investments, spending some time, spending 10 or 15 to 20 hours a
[00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:38.480]   week on your part-time real estate business can reap huge rewards.
[00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:42.540]   You need some time and you need some money, but it can reap huge rewards.
[00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:48.260]   There are many, many, many people who have done it, many ordinary men and women just
[00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:51.580]   like you and me who have done it.
[00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:55.980]   There are a bunch of ways that you can massively improve the system.
[00:20:55.980 --> 00:21:02.140]   But that's the fundamental basis of John's system and it's so elegantly simple.
[00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:07.060]   But with his positioning of it, at this point, you check back in a couple of years and I'll
[00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:13.540]   let you know my personal experience, but I'm convinced it is definitely a doable system.
[00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:19.580]   For me, it is the best type of real estate investment plan that fits my ability, the
[00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:23.020]   amount of time I'm willing to devote to it, the amount of money that I have to invest
[00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:27.260]   and my goals for financial independence and financial freedom.
[00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:28.260]   It fits those things.
[00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:35.260]   It also fits my local market because – well, it fits my local market.
[00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:39.500]   If you have different investment goals, if your goal is to transition to a full-time
[00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:43.120]   real estate business as quickly as possible, this approach is probably not going to be
[00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:44.420]   for you.
[00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:49.940]   You might need to work as properties that are smaller dollar values and do more management,
[00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:54.480]   more intensive – excuse me, intensive management for those properties to generate higher cash
[00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:55.620]   flow returns.
[00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:58.220]   You may need to have a different type of system.
[00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:01.780]   If you don't have any money, you've got to use other people's money or you've
[00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:06.020]   got to develop some sort of synthetic equity or you've got to flip deals and assign them.
[00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:07.620]   You've got to do something else.
[00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:12.820]   But if you fit that type of person like me who you have some investment capital and you're
[00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:16.820]   looking for something that it takes a little bit of time where you can compete but it's
[00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:22.780]   not too much, then John's system is really the best that I've ever been aware of.
[00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:26.500]   Again, the most important thing to me is the type of tenant.
[00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:31.500]   I do not want to manage a 30-unit apartment complex.
[00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:34.540]   That's not something that I want to do with my time.
[00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:36.500]   That can be a very profitable endeavor.
[00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:38.440]   I don't want to do that.
[00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:43.500]   But I could manage 10 or 20 or 30 rental houses.
[00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:49.060]   If you go back and listen to John's interview on episode 119 of the show, you'll hear
[00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:53.460]   me question him about that and he'll point out his management systems that are very,
[00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:54.460]   very simple.
[00:22:54.460 --> 00:23:00.700]   He does – a couple of my requirements with real estate, I do not want to do any hands-on
[00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:02.220]   construction work.
[00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:07.700]   He does no hands-on construction work and I want good tenants and he has excellent tenants.
[00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:13.420]   He talks in the seminar about the amount of time that he spends in management and it's
[00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:14.420]   minimal.
[00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:18.340]   Probably averages out if memory is correct to be an hour or two a day.
[00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:22.140]   Some days more, some days less but an hour or two a day on average.
[00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:24.260]   He lives a great lifestyle, has done a great job.
[00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:27.060]   So it's definitely a proven plan.
[00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:28.300]   That was why I wanted to go.
[00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:33.180]   Now before I chose to go to the seminar, I had read John's books and so I know that
[00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:40.740]   I knew that this was exactly what I wanted and I had done enough other research to know
[00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:45.580]   what I was looking for as far as an approach to a seminar.
[00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:48.380]   Quick comment on seminars versus books.
[00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:50.780]   Seminars can be wonderful things to attend.
[00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:55.180]   They really can be and John's seminar is a great – is a very, very good one.
[00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:56.260]   I really enjoyed it.
[00:23:56.260 --> 00:23:58.760]   It was exactly what I was hoping that it was.
[00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:01.260]   But you shouldn't go to seminars if you don't know what you're trying to get out
[00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:04.140]   of it because that is crazy expensive.
[00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:10.340]   Now one of the best things about John's seminar is that his price for it was only
[00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:11.340]   $550 I think.
[00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:13.540]   That was what he was selling it for on his website.
[00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:18.580]   I was able to work out a deal with him where in exchange for my reviewing the seminar publicly
[00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:21.740]   and also I want to help him with some publicity for his books.
[00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:23.020]   I'm hoping we can do more.
[00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:24.460]   I actually have some ideas.
[00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:30.660]   I want to work with John on my own projects and try to build out some educational stuff
[00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:33.580]   for the media for radical personal finance in the future.
[00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:36.300]   I've got some ideas of ways I want to work with him.
[00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:38.580]   So none of that stuff is set in stone.
[00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:42.820]   But he gave me a complimentary review ticket to the seminar which helped me and saved me
[00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:43.820]   $550.
[00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:46.260]   I still had to pay to get there and pay for the hotels and all that.
[00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:47.940]   But that saved me a bunch of money.
[00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:54.740]   But John's entry price of $550, that is among the cheaper – I mean it's one of
[00:24:54.740 --> 00:25:00.380]   the most reasonable seminar prices that I'm aware of, especially in this real estate world
[00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:03.820]   where usually the prices are so, so high.
[00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:07.660]   But think about the number of books that you can buy and read in exchange for the seminar
[00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:08.660]   price.
[00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:14.380]   So I do not think it's a good plan for people to go to seminars as a way of getting exposure
[00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:15.980]   to different ideas.
[00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:19.560]   The first thing you should do if you're interested in ideas is read books, listen
[00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:24.020]   to the BiggerPockets podcast, spend time on their forums, find any landlording or real
[00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:27.980]   estate forums that you can be involved in, spend time on the internet looking for stuff
[00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:28.980]   there.
[00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:32.460]   And then only after you've built a base of foundation, you've invested in the books
[00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:36.620]   and the things that you need, at that point in time then go to a seminar.
[00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:41.340]   And then what I was looking for at the seminar was I was looking for the comprehensive plan
[00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:45.220]   and the personal access to the seminar leader.
[00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:47.700]   And that's exactly what John's seminar delivered.
[00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:49.500]   I was very, very impressed.
[00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:53.980]   I'll give you some specific points on the seminar and then some of the things that I
[00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:57.500]   really loved and some of the things that I didn't in just a moment.
[00:25:57.500 --> 00:26:00.540]   Before I do, sponsor second half of the show is Paladin Registry.
[00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:03.820]   Paladin Registry is a registry service for financial advisors.
[00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:08.100]   If you are looking for a financial advisor, start your search at Paladin.
[00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:13.060]   Go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/Paladin, P-A-L-A-D-I-N.
[00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:19.820]   Start your search with advisors who have been pre-screened carefully, independent, comprehensive,
[00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:25.420]   well-qualified financial advisors whose backgrounds and records and qualifications have been checked
[00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:26.420]   out.
[00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:29.420]   Go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/Paladin and that's where you should start your search.
[00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:30.860]   It's the best solution.
[00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:35.020]   If I were looking for a new financial advisor, that's exactly where I would go.
[00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:38.300]   So let's talk about the seminar.
[00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:40.500]   I've been to a lot of seminars.
[00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:42.860]   And I've been to a lot of good ones and I've been to a lot of bad ones.
[00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:48.780]   And I do think seminars are worth, as long as you're not just becoming a seminar junkie
[00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:51.540]   without doing anything, they are well worth the money.
[00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:54.700]   I've spent a lot of money on seminars.
[00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:57.860]   I'll tell you some of the things that just most impressed me with John's seminar.
[00:26:57.860 --> 00:26:59.820]   Number one, it was no nonsense.
[00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:01.300]   It was straightforward.
[00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:06.540]   It was packed with information and it wasn't overhyped and oversold.
[00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:10.820]   One of the things, and I've written the outline for a potential seminar that I want to do
[00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:13.820]   in the future, and it's always a challenge when you're thinking about how to design a
[00:27:13.820 --> 00:27:17.460]   seminar because you can go over the top and you can make the thing so fancy.
[00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:21.240]   You've got to rent a fancy hotel room, do all kinds of beautiful fancy signage.
[00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:25.020]   You can do all kinds of great marketing stuff.
[00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:26.140]   But that stuff all costs money.
[00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:30.900]   And the question is, does it really add value for the seminar attendees?
[00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:32.040]   Sometimes yes, maybe.
[00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:33.260]   Sometimes no.
[00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:37.100]   But I was glad that John's seminar was not hyped up.
[00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:39.940]   As I remember, I don't think he had any signs.
[00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:44.460]   It was just him and his wife who were there welcoming people.
[00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:50.620]   There were, by my count, I think there were about 75 attendees there.
[00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:52.380]   We got in on Saturday morning.
[00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:54.340]   We got started all day Saturday.
[00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:56.940]   We went out in the evening and knocked on doors.
[00:27:56.940 --> 00:27:58.140]   We'll get to that in a minute.
[00:27:58.140 --> 00:27:59.540]   And then all day Sunday.
[00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:01.820]   And the best thing about it was the atmosphere.
[00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:07.180]   It was enough people to feel like you were there learning with a bunch of other people.
[00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:12.700]   But there was plenty of time to have tons of personal interaction with the seminar leader.
[00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:18.260]   I think that's so important at a seminar, if possible, to have time for that interaction
[00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:20.120]   with the seminar leader.
[00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:27.900]   So I thought it was a great deal, a great price, and just an awesome thing.
[00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:32.260]   Seminars can be so expensive to go to if you're paying for expensive tickets, plus you've
[00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:37.500]   got the cost of getting there, plus you've got the hotel costs, plus you've got the opportunity
[00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:40.400]   costs, the things you're giving up to get there.
[00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:43.780]   And so I thought $550 for a two-day seminar.
[00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:46.860]   Basically you add hotels and food and transportation.
[00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:49.180]   Most people are looking at $1,000.
[00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:54.400]   And that to me is a very reasonable price.
[00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:55.900]   And it was packed with value.
[00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:59.840]   I really was glad that John's seminar was practical.
[00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:02.540]   He gave specific tips.
[00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:07.620]   He gave at the beginning very practical goal setting, building a plan of how to do it.
[00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:10.660]   He gave very practical examples of financing.
[00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:15.060]   And the best part of the seminar was Shab's experience.
[00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:19.600]   He's done hundreds of – I don't know if hundreds.
[00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:22.660]   He's done dozens and dozens.
[00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:25.500]   He didn't say exactly, but dozens and dozens of deals.
[00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:30.260]   And so he was able to use all of these examples from personal deals that he's done, properties
[00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:33.400]   he's bought, properties he's owned, properties he's sold.
[00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:37.020]   He gave examples where he was the borrower and gave examples where he was the lender.
[00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:41.860]   He's able to give – because of his 40 years of experience, he's able to give examples
[00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:44.000]   from all different economic cycles.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:49.080]   John studied real estate in college and then he got out of – when he got out of college,
[00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:51.740]   he quickly went full time into the real estate business.
[00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:56.720]   He for a while had an agent's license, started to build that, found out that wasn't working
[00:29:56.720 --> 00:30:01.260]   and then it wasn't worth the time and the hassle, and then focused on investments.
[00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:07.140]   And he built his entire real estate empire as a full-time investor, starting with nothing,
[00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:08.140]   starting broke.
[00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:10.880]   But he built it and did a great job.
[00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:18.260]   He did a good job of using clear, specific examples that were real world examples, not
[00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:24.620]   pie in the sky, this is the best deal I ever did, real world examples, lots of them.
[00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:30.180]   He did a good job of giving the basics and going a little bit deeper.
[00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:32.900]   One of the things I ask myself is who is this seminar appropriate for?
[00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:40.340]   I would say at least 50 percent probably my guess would be at least half of the attendees
[00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:44.660]   in there were already active real estate investors, some of them very experienced.
[00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:50.340]   There were some very experienced investors with many, many properties, managing 10, 20,
[00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:52.600]   30 or even more units.
[00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:55.760]   There were investors there with decades of experience.
[00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:59.640]   So I would say at least half of them were experienced investors.
[00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:05.760]   The other half were probably newbies and some of the newbies had never had any investment
[00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:10.320]   experience and that was cool to talk with some of the people who were totally new.
[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:15.100]   If you are totally new to the world of real estate, I don't know that I would necessarily
[00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:18.400]   start here or at least if I did start here, I would expect to need to do some homework
[00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:24.820]   because John does a good job of going into some of the practical nuts and bolts of investing.
[00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:27.260]   But some of the language might be a little bit foreign to you.
[00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:32.360]   For example, John is an expert with lease options and he has done a lot of deals buying
[00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:35.200]   with lease options and selling with lease options.
[00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:39.800]   If you don't know what a lease option is or just the basics of how the contracts are
[00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:44.480]   structured or what the benefits are, it's going to be hard to benefit from the in-depth
[00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:47.960]   discussion of how this particular deal was structured.
[00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:53.640]   But if you have at least a cursory understanding of, "OK, here's what a lease options are.
[00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:58.720]   Here's how you could structure a note," then you could really benefit from the content
[00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:00.800]   of the seminar.
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:05.480]   So I wouldn't say it was for rank beginners but you could be a pretty good beginner and
[00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:06.480]   still do it.
[00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:12.080]   The best thing about the conference was the access that John gave to his content especially
[00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:13.480]   for beginners.
[00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:17.640]   On the first day on Saturday at lunch, he had all of the new investors, people who had
[00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:21.480]   never bought properties or who were just new investors.
[00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:23.440]   He sat at lunch at a table with us.
[00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:27.640]   So I got to sit next to him at lunch and ask him all of my questions and that was really,
[00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:28.640]   really beneficial.
[00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:31.880]   Then he had one of his friends who was also an experienced investor take another table
[00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:32.880]   of newbies.
[00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:35.080]   So everybody who wanted to sit at those tables was excluded.
[00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:36.920]   So that was awesome.
[00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:41.360]   On the first – on the night, Saturday night, he invited all of the attendees over to his
[00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:44.520]   house and that was really, really gracious of him.
[00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:48.240]   He and his wife hosted everyone and his son hosted everyone at their house and got a chance
[00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:51.540]   plenty of time to talk to them and ask all kinds of questions.
[00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:56.960]   So there was plenty of access which to me speaks wonders.
[00:32:56.960 --> 00:33:00.400]   I hate going to a seminar when you don't have access to the seminar attendee.
[00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:04.720]   If I go to a seminar and you don't have access to the seminar – to the presenter,
[00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:08.840]   excuse me, to the presenter and if there's no structure there to build relationships
[00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:11.320]   with the other attendees, I just say, "What's the point?
[00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:13.040]   Why didn't I just buy the CDs?
[00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:16.880]   I don't want to waste my time going and sitting in a classroom if I'm not going
[00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:21.000]   to access the presenter or if I'm not there and going to have specific time that I'm
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.520]   going to really be able to engage with the other attendees."
[00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:24.520]   It's a waste of time.
[00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:26.800]   Let me just buy the audio from it and listen to it.
[00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:30.640]   I learned better as a self-directed student in that situation.
[00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:36.240]   But because of all of the access John gave to him for personal relationship and then
[00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:39.640]   also the time with other attendees, it was really, really good.
[00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:44.000]   I really appreciated how the focus was on action.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:45.600]   Obviously when you're at a seminar, you're there to learn.
[00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:50.640]   But on the first day, one of the primary ways that John encourages people to find deals
[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:53.360]   is to go out and knock on doors.
[00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:57.760]   The process goes, because we're looking for a specific criteria, you start with what
[00:33:57.760 --> 00:34:01.380]   location do you want to invest in, specifically what neighborhoods.
[00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:05.160]   Not just going out and saying, "Can I find a deal?" and building this thing in a non-planned
[00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:08.980]   fashion, whatever deal happens to pop out of the woods at you, but rather you're building
[00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:10.040]   very strategically.
[00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:14.420]   What neighborhoods, specific neighborhoods do you want to invest in?
[00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:19.120]   He gave us a map of all of the different neighborhoods that he owns houses in, neighborhoods that
[00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:21.080]   he's chosen that fit his criteria.
[00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:26.880]   Then we split out into teams of two or three people and we went out and knocked on doors.
[00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:30.400]   Basically just trying to find out about any possible leads on properties.
[00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:34.040]   You have a lot of competition in the real estate investment world.
[00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:45.360]   One of the ways to beat your competition is to find the property before it's available.
[00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:49.640]   You got to find the properties before they go on the market.
[00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:52.880]   One of the best ways that John has found to do it is just to knock on doors and start
[00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:56.800]   getting connected in those neighborhoods and find out any leads on properties in specific
[00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:57.800]   neighborhoods.
[00:34:57.800 --> 00:35:00.760]   That's kind of scary for many people who haven't gone.
[00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:04.480]   I've never done that, but it was pretty cool because we got to prove to ourselves, "Yes,
[00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:06.400]   we can go knock on doors."
[00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:11.800]   All of us found leads or options on things that we could follow up on.
[00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:17.240]   The guy that I went out knocking on doors with, we found a couple of properties that
[00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:19.200]   were definitely worth following up on.
[00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:21.280]   Passed along the address to John in case he wanted to invest in.
[00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:25.760]   I don't own real estate in Sarasota, but in case he wanted to pursue it, some opportunities.
[00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:30.800]   So it was definitely a really great solution.
[00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:37.720]   My favorite thing about the seminar was how John talked about the buying process.
[00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:45.400]   One of the big things about his system is to finance the properties with less than 10%
[00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:49.120]   down, but not to use banks for financing.
[00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:53.760]   John said in 40 years of investing, he's never borrowed money from a bank.
[00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:55.320]   So you say, "Well, how do you do that?"
[00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:57.200]   Well, it takes a little bit of a different approach.
[00:35:57.200 --> 00:36:00.920]   He went through example after example of his own buying, and then he also went through
[00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:04.920]   example after example of his own selling in places where he sold.
[00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:05.920]   He's lent money.
[00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:08.880]   He's done co-investing on different deals.
[00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:13.520]   One of the things that most attracts me to John's system is because that method of borrowing,
[00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:18.400]   the way that he teaches people, that method of borrowing substantially reduces the risk.
[00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:23.200]   Borrowing on real estate is much less risky than many other forms of borrowing.
[00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:30.480]   Even if you're just buying with traditional mortgages, because the mortgage debt is non-collectible,
[00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:34.400]   usually at fixed rates, it's very, very safe debt.
[00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:35.720]   It's also very, very liquid debt.
[00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:37.160]   You can sell the notes easily.
[00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:38.400]   Banks like real estate is collateral.
[00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:41.540]   That's why the debt market for mortgages is so filled.
[00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:46.960]   So borrowing on real estate first and foremost has much less risk than many other things.
[00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:51.560]   I would never personally – I would never – I shouldn't say never.
[00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:55.720]   At this point, I have never been willing to think of any scenario that I would ever consider
[00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:59.280]   borrowing on margin for stocks.
[00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:00.280]   Some people do it.
[00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:01.720]   I would not be willing to do it.
[00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:04.160]   But borrowing on real estate is a totally different animal.
[00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:06.520]   It's much less risky.
[00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:10.480]   Then also if you can structure a debt in a certain – in different ways where you don't
[00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:14.000]   actually own the banks but you own individual – owe individual investors, you owe the
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:18.360]   seller of the house, you structure it in a bunch of different ways, then that in and
[00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:20.960]   of itself substantially lowers your risk.
[00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:28.360]   Then if you manage the way that you have – manage the way that you owe the debt on the properties,
[00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:29.360]   that lowers the risk.
[00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:33.360]   One of the things that was very encouraging to me was that John confirmed even something
[00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:38.440]   I had figured out that I covered in the Myths show that your lowest – you should always
[00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:40.840]   keep your debt on as few properties as possible.
[00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:42.960]   So let's say you have a portfolio of ten properties.
[00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:48.280]   You're better off having five of those properties financed almost to 100 percent and five of
[00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:53.440]   them free and clear than you are having all of the properties at 50 percent debt to equity
[00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:54.760]   ratio.
[00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:58.600]   So he confirmed a lot of the things that I figured out the hard way over the last few
[00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:04.400]   years and it was nice to have my opinions confirmed by someone with much more experience
[00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:06.480]   and much more wealth than me.
[00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:07.720]   So that was really nice.
[00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:10.520]   So that was my favorite aspect of the seminars, him going through the deals.
[00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:12.120]   How to structure them, how to build notes.
[00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:14.440]   Now, it wasn't a course on paper.
[00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:17.760]   It wasn't a course on how to structure paper and notes to buy and sell.
[00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:22.080]   But it was just awesome to see it because that's where I could see my skill and my
[00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:26.840]   ability really developing, being able to creatively structure deals in ways that are win, win,
[00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:28.560]   win, win, win across the board.
[00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:33.740]   A little bit of creativity, a good property, a good situation, that's where you can really
[00:38:33.740 --> 00:38:34.740]   do well.
[00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:37.080]   The other thing I appreciate about John was just his ethics.
[00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:41.600]   He's a very upright and ethical man of integrity.
[00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:47.360]   And that to me is very important because I don't want to be in a situation where I'm
[00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:48.600]   a leech on people.
[00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:51.520]   I don't want to be – I don't want to take advantage of people.
[00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:55.560]   And the cool thing is if you can find the right situation, then you can solve people's
[00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:59.960]   problems at a profit and everybody is happy.
[00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:03.200]   You can solve people's problems at a profit and everybody is happy.
[00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:04.880]   And John gave so many examples of that.
[00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:09.360]   And even he gave examples of how when – in the past where he was a lender and how he
[00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:12.940]   talked about the lender's interest and the borrower's interest and when he was a lender
[00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:17.120]   and he had deals go bad and how he would sit down and renegotiate and how if you understand
[00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:21.360]   the incentives, basically your whole – one of the major things to make a good real estate
[00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:27.880]   investor is to craft the proper offers, to craft the offers that fix all of the problems
[00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:30.280]   and figure out how can you keep everybody happy.
[00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:32.900]   And that's the good basis of negotiation.
[00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:37.440]   In a successful business deal, I believe everybody should go away happy.
[00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:39.680]   Everyone should go away feeling like they won.
[00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:44.400]   And so not everybody who's living in a house is saying, "Well, my way to win is just
[00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:46.480]   to sell this house for the maximum profit."
[00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:49.960]   So you got to find those people that you can help and they're going to go away happy
[00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:51.040]   with the deal.
[00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:52.560]   The investor needs to be happy with the deal.
[00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:55.240]   The tenants need to be happy with the deal and you can do that.
[00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:59.760]   John did a great job of talking about tenant management, of his property management systems
[00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:04.800]   and I could just see how his systems were developed through trial and error to weed
[00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:09.480]   out the bad tenants and it's not an accident that he has very low maintenance tenants.
[00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:13.880]   And then also it was very valuable, his checklists, his agreements, his contracts and his mortgages
[00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:16.480]   were all part of the workbook for the seminar.
[00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:22.340]   So I came away without question feeling just totally impressed and ready – totally impressed
[00:40:22.340 --> 00:40:23.340]   with the seminar.
[00:40:23.340 --> 00:40:24.520]   I may go back in the future.
[00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:27.760]   I was impressed at how many experienced real estate investors were there.
[00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:28.880]   I was also impressed.
[00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:33.360]   I had breakfast one morning with one seminar attendee who had traveled from Singapore to
[00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:38.440]   Florida to go to the conference and he had been going to Shobb seminars for years.
[00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:40.320]   I was very, very impressed with that.
[00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:41.320]   I talked to him.
[00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:45.160]   I was thankful to live in the United States of America as far as from an investment perspective
[00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:49.240]   after hearing the investment situation that he faces living in Singapore.
[00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:53.360]   Just amazing how the different challenges that investors face around the world.
[00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:55.640]   But it was just packed, packed with value.
[00:40:55.640 --> 00:40:56.640]   Very, very impressed.
[00:40:56.640 --> 00:41:00.540]   I even appreciated how John sold at the seminar.
[00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:05.000]   One of the keys to running a good marketing business is you should always give your students
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:07.800]   next steps, ways to go on with you.
[00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:11.760]   So if you're having a seminar, you always want to make sure that you have an offer to
[00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:15.600]   present to your attendees that's the way that they can continue.
[00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:16.680]   And so John did a great job with that.
[00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:21.920]   He has a bunch of self-study courses and he did a good job offering a very, very strong
[00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:26.460]   deal with good discounts on his products but for quality products.
[00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:30.800]   And because the seminar was packed full of quality and content, I don't know – I didn't
[00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:35.320]   count the percentage but plenty of people were thrilled to buy his additional products
[00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:39.200]   and I'm looking forward to them too.
[00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:42.160]   He's got great products.
[00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:43.280]   And then also just the additional seminars.
[00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:46.440]   But he didn't go over the top because there's that fine line I believe that needs to be
[00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:51.920]   done of good professional presentation and selling without going over the top and starting
[00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:55.760]   to put psychological tactics on people and hammering it too long.
[00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:58.780]   And I just thought – I thought they did a great job.
[00:41:58.780 --> 00:42:05.560]   When you combine all those things, the content, the plan, the access, the value, I mean I
[00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:12.520]   was very impressed and been to a lot of seminars, very impressed.
[00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:16.880]   Points of improvement, suggestions that I would make, there weren't many.
[00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:21.160]   But I would say probably the two things.
[00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:26.040]   Number one, in the very beginning of day one, we started with talking about kind of what's
[00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:27.040]   the plan.
[00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:33.660]   There were some points in John's workbook of some pages to fill in and some lines to
[00:42:33.660 --> 00:42:35.200]   fill in of, OK, what's your goal?
[00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:36.200]   What's your cash flow goal?
[00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:37.480]   What is your shopping list?
[00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:42.280]   I really appreciate that because it's so important I think for people to have a specific
[00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:43.760]   plan of here's what you're trying to do.
[00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:47.120]   You don't need $30 million of real estate to be wealthy.
[00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:48.120]   That's absurd.
[00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:51.300]   I mean if you want it, fine, but you don't need it.
[00:42:51.300 --> 00:42:53.280]   How on earth are you going to spend the money from that?
[00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:55.360]   There's no way to spend that money.
[00:42:55.360 --> 00:43:00.200]   So most people could manage what they need with just a few rental houses.
[00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:07.320]   I mean if you have in my neighborhood or my city here, if I had five rental houses and
[00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:14.640]   let's say net rent on houses this size that I'm pursuing because I know specifically
[00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:19.000]   what I want, I know some of the neighborhoods already that I'm targeting, if you have five
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:23.600]   houses and they're renting for $1,800 a month gross, let's say you're netting $1,400
[00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:31.400]   a month after expenses not including financing, that's $7,000 a month.
[00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:34.760]   Most people, $7,000 a month, that's $84,000 a year.
[00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:37.780]   That's double the median income in the United States of America.
[00:43:37.780 --> 00:43:45.060]   So five to ten houses is really about all most people need to be very, very financially
[00:43:45.060 --> 00:43:48.000]   comfortable.
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:56.180]   But I think coming in with a shopping list, one of the suggestions I make to John is that
[00:43:56.180 --> 00:44:00.540]   if you would in advance like have people create the shopping list, have people create what
[00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:05.380]   do you want to buy, how much money, specific numbers so you can come in and the plan can
[00:44:05.380 --> 00:44:11.420]   be okay, I need to create $10,000 of monthly income, $10,000 of monthly income that in
[00:44:11.420 --> 00:44:15.820]   my neighborhood here are the types of houses, here's what the rents can be, so this is the
[00:44:15.820 --> 00:44:19.540]   number of houses that I need and here's when I need them paid off so I can own them free
[00:44:19.540 --> 00:44:24.100]   and clear so I can have that income very, very safely.
[00:44:24.100 --> 00:44:30.220]   That could be done in a simple PDF sent out in advance and I think if seminar attendees
[00:44:30.220 --> 00:44:34.900]   did that, it would help to come away with a more applicable personal plan.
[00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:38.900]   I think that would be one really beneficial idea.
[00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:44.380]   Secondly, I would love – John doesn't permit recording at his seminars and I think
[00:44:44.380 --> 00:44:48.500]   that's fine, but I think it would be a really nice touch to go ahead and include an audio
[00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:52.720]   of the seminar, of that specific seminar as a go-away present.
[00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:56.900]   That can be done so inexpensively and for people who have just bought the course and
[00:44:56.900 --> 00:45:00.620]   who would like to go back and listen to it again because there's a lot in two days
[00:45:00.620 --> 00:45:05.140]   that's not passed into the book and so to send seminar attendees away with an audio
[00:45:05.140 --> 00:45:12.580]   or offer it as a $50 or $100 or purchase price to be able to have a nicely recorded audio
[00:45:12.580 --> 00:45:17.860]   of the same seminar delivered previously, I think that would be a really big value.
[00:45:17.860 --> 00:45:23.620]   So those are my two suggestions to John of ways to improve it and create even more satisfied
[00:45:23.620 --> 00:45:24.940]   customers.
[00:45:24.940 --> 00:45:27.820]   But those are my thoughts and that's my review.
[00:45:27.820 --> 00:45:31.820]   So that's my review of John's Building Wealth One House at a Time seminar.
[00:45:31.820 --> 00:45:37.420]   Again I went January 16 and 17, 2016 in Sarasota, Florida and it was great.
[00:45:37.420 --> 00:45:42.440]   If you get an opportunity to go in the future, read the books first, but it was without question
[00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:43.440]   a great seminar.
[00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:45.940]   I may go back in the future, I don't know.
[00:45:45.940 --> 00:45:46.940]   But I was thoroughly impressed.
[00:45:46.940 --> 00:45:49.020]   I want to thank John for letting me come.
[00:45:49.020 --> 00:45:55.960]   Again, he was very generous to allow me to come and I wanted to – I was ready to buy
[00:45:55.960 --> 00:46:02.340]   the ticket if he didn't allow me to come, but he graciously allowed me to come in exchange
[00:46:02.340 --> 00:46:07.940]   for – I just said I want to help you publicize your stuff and I hope you guys can hear the
[00:46:07.940 --> 00:46:11.100]   value that there has been in the seminar.
[00:46:11.100 --> 00:46:13.440]   Hope this review even was valuable to you.
[00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:15.860]   So if you're considering thinking about it, hopefully with the information that I
[00:46:15.860 --> 00:46:19.740]   presented you'll be able to make a good decision and I'm looking forward to having
[00:46:19.740 --> 00:46:21.860]   John on the show with his new book.
[00:46:21.860 --> 00:46:25.360]   When the new book comes out, that will be extremely valuable for you as well.
[00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:29.540]   In the meantime, if you haven't read Building Wealth One House at a Time, Amazon used books,
[00:46:29.540 --> 00:46:32.440]   that's the way to go.
[00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:35.900]   It's just amazing how cheap information is now.
[00:46:35.900 --> 00:46:37.740]   You got to – it's cheap in dollar prices.
[00:46:37.740 --> 00:46:38.900]   It's not cheap in time.
[00:46:38.900 --> 00:46:41.300]   You got to put the work in to educate yourself.
[00:46:41.300 --> 00:46:43.340]   But just think again as we go today.
[00:46:43.340 --> 00:46:48.100]   Just think about the numbers that in that example scenario.
[00:46:48.100 --> 00:46:53.340]   One house a year, 10% down, hold them until they double in value.
[00:46:53.340 --> 00:46:58.620]   If they double in value, under those conservative assumptions after 10 years, you would wind
[00:46:58.620 --> 00:47:03.580]   up owning $4 million of real estate and have $2 million of equity in that real estate.
[00:47:03.580 --> 00:47:07.580]   Rents, your tenants paying off the mortgages for you.
[00:47:07.580 --> 00:47:11.180]   You do the work of finding the properties and of managing them.
[00:47:11.180 --> 00:47:15.940]   For many of you, that should probably be the most productive part-time job that you could
[00:47:15.940 --> 00:47:17.140]   do.
[00:47:17.140 --> 00:47:20.980]   That could be the most productive way for you to invest 15 or 20 hours a week.
[00:47:20.980 --> 00:47:28.020]   A couple hours, two nights a week and Saturdays, it could be very, very productive for you.
[00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:32.100]   That's the ticket.
[00:47:32.100 --> 00:47:35.180]   That's the plan.
[00:47:35.180 --> 00:47:36.820]   So consider it.
[00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:37.980]   Start with John's book.
[00:47:37.980 --> 00:47:40.580]   Go back and listen to episode 119 of the show.
[00:47:40.580 --> 00:47:43.100]   I think you'll really enjoy that.
[00:47:43.100 --> 00:47:44.740]   I think that's it.
[00:47:44.740 --> 00:47:45.740]   Thank you all for listening.
