[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.880]   How can a Christian live with a debilitating disability and not waste their lives?
[00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.120]   It's an important question from a listener named Sarah.
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.800]   "Hello Pastor John, I've enjoyed listening to your podcast for several years.
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.080]   My husband and I actually started our dating relationship by listening to and discussing
[00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.600]   Ask Pastor John episodes together."
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.480]   I mean, that is how you start a relationship, right?
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.680]   "I was very encouraged by your episode, God's Sovereign Plans Behind Your Most Unproductive
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:32.680]   Days.
[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:33.680]   And my question is related.
[00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.160]   I have had chronic illness for several years and am struggling to understand God's purpose
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.160]   in it.
[00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.080]   Five years ago I left my job to serve as an intern on the mission field in Haiti.
[00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.740]   After the internship I started to pursue a longer term on the mission field, but doors
[00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.960]   clearly closed and my health problems began.
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.840]   I settled into my church, became involved there and met my husband.
[00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.520]   I was working at a job I loved and often invited co-workers to church, but my health continued
[00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.080]   to worsen and last year I had to quit my job altogether.
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:08.320]   I've also had to drop out of serving at church and frequently cannot even attend on Sunday.
[00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.720]   I've spent thousands of dollars I would gladly give to missions on medication and treatments.
[00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.160]   Time I would gladly serve the Lord with or invest in others is eaten up by doctor's appointments
[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.160]   too.
[00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.080]   My energy is very limited and sometimes I can't even focus well enough to pray.
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.960]   I'm desperate to not waste my life, but the days, weeks and months consumed with illness
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.200]   are slipping through my fingers like sand.
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.960]   Five years ago I had so much to give and now I feel that I have so little to offer.
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:41.400]   Can weeks and months of sickness spent in bed count as much for eternity and God's glory
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.280]   as weeks and months spent serving on the mission field?
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:51.280]   How can I be a faithful servant to the Lord on the days when I can do nothing?
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:58.860]   The best thing I can do for Sarah, perhaps, is point her, if she isn't already familiar
[00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:09.680]   with it, to a sonnet by John Milton, the author of the greatest poem in English, namely Paradise
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:17.540]   Lost, and help her see herself with him in what he says in this poem, because he wrote
[00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:26.920]   it after he had gone totally blind in the midst of his writing career.
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.920]   And then put this in a biblical context.
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:41.000]   God changed Milton's heart, gave him an astonishing resilience, but in this poem you hear his
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:49.820]   sense of great loss at his blindness, just like Sarah feels great loss in what she's
[00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:54.180]   able to give and do for the sake of the kingdom.
[00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.340]   And I hope she'll find encouragement.
[00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:02.440]   Let me read the sonnet and then make some comments on it from a biblical standpoint.
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:10.400]   When I consider how my light is spent ere half my days in this dark world and wide,
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.820]   And that the one talent which is death to hide
[00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:19.180]   Lodged with me useless, though my soul more bent
[00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.620]   To serve there with my Maker, and present my true account,
[00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.720]   Lest he returning chide, doth God exact day labor
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.760]   Light denied, I fondly ask?
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:36.060]   But patience, to prevent that murmur, soon replies,
[00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.480]   God doth not need either man's work or his gifts.
[00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.580]   Who best bear his mild yoke, they serve him best.
[00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:51.220]   His state is kingly, thousands at his bidding speed,
[00:03:51.220 --> 00:04:00.500]   And post or land and ocean without rest, They also serve, who only stand and wait.
[00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:08.920]   Now, that's a beautiful poem from one who felt, at least at first, like God had taken
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:16.840]   away the gift and the strength to do the one thing he felt called to do.
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.360]   And I think it is biblical, the way he works it through.
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:28.460]   So let's think from Scripture about what it means to lose one's capacity to do what we
[00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:35.720]   would love to do, what we have loved doing for Christ and his kingdom.
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:45.280]   In August 1992, during the Summer Olympics, I preached two messages on what I called "Olympic
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:52.500]   spirituality," just to connect the sermons with what everybody was watching.
[00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:57.200]   And I built the messages around those several parts of Scripture that compared athletic
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:04.220]   efforts to the Christian life, like running the race and boxing, fighting sin.
[00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:11.680]   And as I preached those messages, I was aware that Elsie Viren, one of the oldest ladies
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:19.460]   in our church, was recovering from a broken hip in Augustana Home a couple of blocks away.
[00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:28.140]   And I knew that Elsie would never run again, just like Milton would never see again.
[00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:29.900]   Not in this life.
[00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:38.340]   So I wrote an article for the church newsletter, "How Can Elsie Run?"
[00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.780]   She doesn't look like an Olympic marathoner.
[00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:46.100]   She's in her late 80s, and she's got a broken hip and she can barely move.
[00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:50.540]   She doesn't look like an Olympic boxer.
[00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:56.420]   Can Elsie be an Olympian spiritually?
[00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:01.720]   And the answer is not that she doesn't have to run.
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:08.280]   The answer is that we all must run, whether old or young, whether sick or healthy, whether
[00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.700]   blind or seeing.
[00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:18.580]   And this is possible for the sick and senile because the race is a race against unbelief,
[00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:21.340]   not against sickness or senility.
[00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:26.060]   They may come, and we still win.
[00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:29.380]   Sickness may come, senility may come, and we still win.
[00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:40.780]   It is possible for the unhealthy to win the fight against unbelief because the fight is
[00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:47.420]   against lost hope, lost faith, not against lost health.
[00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:49.500]   Here's the biblical evidence for this.
[00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:55.940]   First Timothy 6.12, Paul says, "Fight the good fight of faith.
[00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:01.540]   Take hold of eternal life to which you were called when you made the good confession."
[00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:04.300]   So the fight is a fight of faith.
[00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:07.620]   It's not a fight to get out of bed.
[00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:10.960]   It's a fight to rest in God.
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:16.940]   It's not a fight to keep all the powers of youth, but to trust in the power of God.
[00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:24.620]   The race is run against doubt in God's goodness and love for us.
[00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:30.860]   It's a fight to stay satisfied in God in spite of broken hips and lost sight and failed memory
[00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:34.900]   and inexplicable fatigue.
[00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:41.140]   The race can and may be run flat out on your back.
[00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:44.940]   Paul said in 2 Timothy 4.7, "I have fought the good fight.
[00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:47.140]   I have finished the race.
[00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:51.740]   Namely, I have kept the faith."
[00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:56.420]   Keeping the race means keeping faith.
[00:07:56.420 --> 00:08:01.780]   It's a race against unbelief, not against aging or physical deterioration.
[00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:04.820]   Those are real temptations.
[00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:10.140]   But the great enemy is unbelief and lost hope.
[00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:15.980]   What gets us across the finish line with the saints cheering and the crown of life is not
[00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:16.980]   legs.
[00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:18.860]   It's not hands.
[00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:21.340]   It's faith and hope.
[00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:29.380]   When we cheer on the diseased or aging runners who run their final laps in hospital beds,
[00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:35.580]   what we are really saying is, "Don't throw away your confidence in Christ.
[00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:39.360]   It has great reward," Hebrews 10.35.
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:49.660]   The finishing line is crossed in the end, not by a burst of human energy, but by collapsing
[00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:53.060]   into the arms of God.
[00:08:53.060 --> 00:09:01.760]   And by all means, let those of us who have any energy left remember that we are called
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:10.980]   upon to, Paul says, "encourage the faint-hearted, help the weak, be patient with them all,"
[00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:13.900]   1 Thessalonians 5.14.
[00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:20.620]   Finishing the race for all of us is a community effort.
[00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:25.580]   And this is especially true of those who are losing the ability they once had to use the
[00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:28.300]   means of grace.
[00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:40.020]   So my conclusion is, may God give us the grace to help every Elsie and every Sarah finish
[00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:43.700]   the race, namely the fight of faith.
[00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:44.700]   Amen.
[00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:48.420]   That's a beautiful word to Sarah and to all of us in various ways.
[00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:49.900]   Pastor John, thank you.
