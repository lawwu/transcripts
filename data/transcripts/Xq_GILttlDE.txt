[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Hello everyone, it's Tony again. Before we dive into today's episode from the SING conference in Nashville, I have a small favor to ask
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.040]   We love to serve you in this podcast and we want to serve you even better in 2020 and beyond and to serve you better
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.800]   Means we need to know you better and to that end we put together a brief little survey
[00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.060]   That takes just a few minutes to fill out and it will be up online until the end of January
[00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:28.480]   If you're willing to help us out, we would really appreciate it. Go online to DesiringGod.org/survey
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:34.840]   That's DesiringGod.org/survey and I'll mention that address after today's episode which starts right now
[00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:44.520]   This spring Pastor John and I recorded five episodes live and in the flesh in Nashville, Tennessee
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.160]   A number of you joined us for that recording session. It was great to see you and at one point in Nashville
[00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.040]   We talked about marriage. Here's the interchange
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.720]   A lot of questions in this room. We've got a hundred questions from folks in attendance
[00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.640]   Most of those had to do with marriage. When life gets busy, pastoring gets busy. You've got young kids
[00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:09.200]   How did you find over the years ways to invest in your wife and make your marriage a priority?
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.760]   Especially in those busy years of pastoring and with young kids
[00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.000]   What do you remember from those days about how you built into Noel and your marriage?
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.120]   I think the biggest investment that a wife or a husband
[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:32.080]   Can make in their spouse is the investment they make in their own soul
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.880]   Here's what I mean
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.400]   If you
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.400]   Did you get married?
[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.240]   all's rosy great love each other and
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:47.240]   Time goes by and you read all kinds of books and you hear a question like that
[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.320]   And so I said, how are you investing in your wife?
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.260]   Like that investing in my wife. What does that even mean?
[00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.000]   investing in my wife
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.040]   I think it is very easy to
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:06.240]   Abstract that from your own soul
[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.720]   Transformation so that becomes a project
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:17.000]   Marriage is the project. I'll read another book. I'll go to another seminar. I've got to learn the right, you know love language
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.560]   Well, that can be that can be good but far more important is
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.160]   Do I go to the Lord and
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.700]   Invest in him and say God
[00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:41.040]   Make me a new person and that's not just what you pray at the beginning of your Christian life
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:47.640]   I mean if you've lived long enough and I see people older a lot of older people out here like me
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.360]   We know we're sinners today
[00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.920]   and
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.640]   I've got
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.400]   Soul work to do so that when I open my mouth with my wife
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.600]   I'm always
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.600]   Investing in her I'm a new person
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.920]   Who loves better who loves better than I did yesterday?
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.480]   so at
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.400]   73 I'm fighting for my marriage every day
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.400]   by fighting for my holiness
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.960]   I'm going to this book and asking not to be
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:32.720]   Unkind not to be critical. I'm asking to be love joy peace patience
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:39.120]   Goodness kindness meekness faithfulness self-control that's called happy marriage
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:46.720]   Right it and then the main the main battle is here. It's really here
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:53.160]   even if even if there's conflict that's where the main battle is a
[00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.720]   Text that is just massively important. I think is
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:02.240]   Colossians 3 I think it's 12 and 13 and it says
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:08.760]   Endure one another in love forgiving one another
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:16.240]   Now in the old King James the words are forbear and forgive but endure
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:20.520]   Is really quite an unromantic word?
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:24.520]   And and it's good
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.440]   Forgiveness is an awesome and wonderful thing
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.560]   every every spouse needs to make a
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.160]   vocation out of asking forgiveness and giving forgiveness
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:42.880]   Has to happen has to happen almost daily. I would say but here's the rub that I learned really quick
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.680]   She doesn't think what bothers me is a sin
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:53.880]   She's got nothing to repent of
[00:04:53.880 --> 00:05:02.640]   And therefore I've got nothing to forgive and I'm ticked off
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:12.200]   Now what I mean that's serious sounds funny, but guess what?
[00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.000]   So
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.760]   the Bible
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.000]   This is a great book. This is a really good book
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.480]   This is a great marriage book the best marriage book there is
[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:30.360]   It says
[00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.680]   Endure one another
[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.320]   Well now just take five minutes to put flesh on that
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.520]   What's that mean?
[00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:44.480]   Now I wrote a book on marriage probably the most important thing in that book is the compost pile
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:47.120]   illustration
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.320]   Every marriage needs a compost pile
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:57.160]   You have any idea what a compost pile is it means you've got a really nice green backyard. It's wonderful
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.480]   it's a great place to hang out and
[00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:02.960]   The relationship has
[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:10.040]   Kooky dirty lousy no good stuff in it that neither of you
[00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:13.160]   considers to be sin
[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:17.200]   And you could be wrong on that
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:23.400]   You build a compost pile way off in the corner and
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.120]   You you throw?
[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.120]   that
[00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:31.000]   Habit of your spouse in the compost pile
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:35.440]   now you can camp out by a compost pile and
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:39.000]   smell the stinky stuff all night long or
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:48.040]   You can pull a curtain around it and have a picnic at the picnic table on the green grass with the woman you married
[00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:56.800]   While while all the compost all your junk and all her junk is in the compost pile you both know
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.720]   They're there, but the smell is bracketed
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:06.480]   It's just cut off and you both are looking in each other's eyes, and you're no very honestly. There's a compost pile back there
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:08.480]   We're not gonna talk about it right now
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:16.520]   We're gonna enjoy these grandkids and we're gonna we're gonna do this barbecue and so
[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:25.160]   Goodness I've got 18 things written down here. That's three of them. I really I probably what I just say and then stop is
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:29.000]   Behaviors are
[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:32.280]   Late things I wrote you an email about this recently
[00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:36.920]   behaviors are late things early things are
[00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:40.800]   Soul things
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:43.200]   attitudes feelings
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:49.520]   Angers joys, and that's where the battle is fought with Jesus over your Bible
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:53.880]   So that when you get up in the morning go down to the breakfast table after a half an hour with
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:58.520]   Jesus come in terms with your own sin confessing you're able to speak up
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:02.920]   Building things let nothing come out of your mouth. This is my wife's favorite verse
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:09.320]   I think when it comes to relationship that nothing come out of your mouth, but only what is gracious what builds up and
[00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:13.640]   And that's what she faults me with all the time is that you should do that better
[00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:22.040]   This whole episode echoes that famous Robert Murray McShane quote to pastors
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:30.160]   My people's greatest need is my personal holiness or my wife's greatest need is my personal holiness
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:37.380]   Which of course is all made possible by the atonement of Jesus Christ for me and the living Spirit of God inside of me
[00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:43.660]   This is one of five episodes. We recorded in Nashville at the sing conference the third to be published in the podcast now
[00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:49.240]   We've already published the episode on when a pastor leaves the faith. That was episode 1379
[00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:52.560]   That's online and when to stop listening to the podcast
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:57.660]   Episode 1382 and then of course today's episode what every marriage needs most
[00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:02.360]   It's episode 1418 that makes number three and that leaves two more to come
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:10.440]   parenting non-christian teenagers that one is scheduled for January 15th, which is a phenomenal episode if I may say so myself and
[00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:15.840]   Finally an episode addressing pro LGBT evangelicals later to come in
[00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:22.800]   2020 but up next what are the drawbacks to Christianity as a major cultural voice?
[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:26.280]   That's my question to Pastor John next time on Friday
[00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:32.040]   Until then if you're willing to help us out fill out our online survey go to desiringgod.org/survey
[00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:34.240]   That's desiringgod.org/survey
[00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:37.160]   Thanks
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:47.160]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
