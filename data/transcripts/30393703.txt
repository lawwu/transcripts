[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.360]   - Welcome friends to this episode
[00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.940]   of the "Everyday Educator" podcast.
[00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.500]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey,
[00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.800]   and I'm excited to spend some time with you today
[00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.320]   as we encourage one another, learn together,
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.180]   and ponder the delights and challenges
[00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.480]   that make homeschooling the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.720]   Whether you're just considering
[00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.760]   this homeschooling possibility
[00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.940]   or deep into the daily delight of family learning,
[00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.680]   I believe you'll enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.120]   But don't forget,
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.540]   although this online community is awesome,
[00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.540]   you'll find even closer support in a local CC community.
[00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.100]   So go to classicalconversations.com
[00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.740]   and find a community near you today.
[00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.800]   Well, friends, as we kind of draw near
[00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.200]   to the end of another academic year,
[00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.200]   I know that lots of you are thinking about the milestones
[00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.000]   that you have passed
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.400]   and the milestones that are coming up on your journey.
[00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.680]   And lots of us are thinking about celebrations
[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.380]   that are ahead at the end of our homeschooling year.
[00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.940]   Things that we are joyously celebrating,
[00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.760]   some things that we are maybe reluctantly celebrating,
[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.300]   some things that might be joyful
[00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.340]   and reluctantly celebrated by your family.
[00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.860]   Today, I have one of my favorite podcast friends with me,
[00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.180]   Kelly Wilt, and Kelly and I are going to talk about
[00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.000]   how we celebrate milestones the classical way.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.980]   So Kelly, thank you so much for being with me
[00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.900]   and tackling this topic.
[00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.060]   - Absolutely, Lisa.
[00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.660]   This is one of my favorite things to discuss
[00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.340]   because I think as homeschoolers,
[00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.700]   we should always be in a spirit of celebration
[00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.580]   for the good things that God is doing
[00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.060]   in and through our homeschools.
[00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.620]   So I am so excited to talk about this.
[00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:08.500]   - That is so neat.
[00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.940]   You know, when I started thinking about this,
[00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.300]   your face jumped to mind immediately
[00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.300]   because I know that you are a natural celebrator.
[00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.700]   Have you always been that way?
[00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:24.780]   - I think so.
[00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:25.820]   I think so.
[00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.720]   Part of that might be because my birthday
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.660]   comes right before Christmas.
[00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.220]   And so I have always, always been one for a party
[00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.220]   and for celebrating.
[00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.980]   And there is just a spirit of joyfulness
[00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.820]   that typically accompanies times of celebration.
[00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.380]   And I just am so drawn to that.
[00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.080]   And just that feeling of remembrance
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.900]   for, like I said, those good things,
[00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.260]   to me is so heartwarming.
[00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.820]   So yes, I think I would answer that question.
[00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.540]   I have always been a natural celebrator.
[00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.100]   - Yeah, and I love what you just said,
[00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:10.100]   that part of celebrating is the sheer joy of accomplishment,
[00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.660]   but part of celebrating is remembering
[00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.260]   what brought you to this point of celebration.
[00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.500]   And let's be real, you and I have homeschooled a long time.
[00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.420]   What brings us to the point of celebration,
[00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.140]   every little piece is not always joyful.
[00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.900]   - Oh, amen, amen.
[00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.580]   - I mean, I said that, and as I heard myself say that,
[00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:33.900]   I thought, "Oh, maybe I shouldn't say that."
[00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.880]   What I really mean is that all of the things
[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.060]   that brought us to these points of celebration
[00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.620]   are not always happy.
[00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:42.540]   - Right.
[00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.140]   - They're not always easy.
[00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.200]   It's not always a jolly old time
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.140]   in the homeschool house today.
[00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.300]   But there is deep joy in knowing
[00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:55.560]   that you are following the path
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.380]   that the Lord called you to,
[00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:01.300]   even when it's a little bit hard.
[00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.500]   - Absolutely, absolutely.
[00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.260]   - I do love that.
[00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.620]   Okay, you are a natural celebrator,
[00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:09.820]   and you have now told us
[00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.580]   that probably that has always been true.
[00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:18.380]   What kinds of things do you celebrate in your family?
[00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.060]   Your family where you, maybe the family that you grew up in,
[00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.420]   but certainly the family where you live now.
[00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:24.380]   - Oh, for sure.
[00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.680]   Well, I think that we've already locked into the fact
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.100]   that celebrations are times of remembrance,
[00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.140]   as well as times of jubilation, I guess.
[00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:38.100]   And in our family,
[00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.380]   we tend to celebrate both big things and small things.
[00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.780]   So for instance, when my children were little,
[00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.900]   we would celebrate the end of reading books together.
[00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.540]   And something as simple as that,
[00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:57.220]   which is, you're definitely not going to the store
[00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.980]   and purchasing lots of supplies for something like that.
[00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:04.340]   We would celebrate small things like that,
[00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:08.780]   but we would also celebrate big things like birthdays,
[00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.780]   or just life events.
[00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.540]   Each of our children, when they were baptized,
[00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.660]   we would invite family, and we would purchase a cake,
[00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.740]   and we would have a meal together,
[00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:25.100]   and we would celebrate that commitment at that time.
[00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:29.660]   So we celebrate small things on a daily basis,
[00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:31.620]   and we celebrate big things too.
[00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.100]   And it weaves together our family culture,
[00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.820]   so that hopefully my children
[00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:41.660]   will be cultivated celebrators too.
[00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:45.420]   - My kids, I've had friends of my children come home
[00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:50.020]   and look at us oddly, at some of the things that we do.
[00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:53.380]   And I ever heard one kid tell my daughter one time,
[00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:55.860]   "Your family celebrates a lot of odd things."
[00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.340]   (both laughing)
[00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:59.700]   And I never realized that we celebrated,
[00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:03.100]   and that made me think, okay, what is it that we're doing?
[00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:06.340]   And we did develop a lot of strange little customs.
[00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:07.500]   Like we celebrated,
[00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.940]   I remember when Stephanie was really little,
[00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:13.860]   we got a book from the library that talked about spring,
[00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:16.260]   and in there, her favorite page
[00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.540]   talked about my spring robin.
[00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:21.540]   And so for years,
[00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:25.020]   we celebrated the day that we saw
[00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:27.260]   my first spring robin every year.
[00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:28.100]   - I love that.
[00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:29.660]   - And just all kinds of things.
[00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:32.660]   I love what you said about celebrating the big things
[00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:35.500]   that we all think of as celebrations,
[00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:40.500]   baptisms, and birthdays, and anniversaries, and Christmas,
[00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:46.300]   but also the little things like finishing a good book.
[00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:49.780]   Although I will tell you, Sarah cried one time.
[00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:52.020]   We finished reading "Cricket" in Times Square.
[00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:54.100]   She loved that book so much.
[00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:56.500]   And I thought we would celebrate the end of it
[00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:57.740]   and make like a little,
[00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:59.860]   we were gonna use a little box
[00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:01.340]   and make a cricket home and everything.
[00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:04.300]   And I looked at her and tears were rolling down her face.
[00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:05.140]   And I thought, oh no,
[00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:07.860]   this is not the celebration I had envisioned.
[00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:11.220]   But I realized then that sometimes
[00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:13.740]   that was quite an accolade.
[00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:16.580]   She was not, she loved stories,
[00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:18.260]   but didn't love books the same way
[00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.060]   that my older daughter had.
[00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:23.820]   And so for her, that was a celebration of a story
[00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:25.300]   that had touched her heart.
[00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:29.620]   So celebrations look different for different families
[00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:32.340]   and for different occasions.
[00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:37.340]   I know that you have tutored and directed lots of levels
[00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:38.820]   within your community
[00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:43.660]   and that this year you are a Challenge 4 director.
[00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:48.660]   How have you celebrated this milestone year
[00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:51.940]   with your community this year?
[00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:54.180]   - Oh, this has been a wonderful year.
[00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:57.780]   And I am just so grateful for God's gift
[00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:00.260]   in giving me this group of young people
[00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.740]   to shepherd through this season.
[00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:05.260]   And at the beginning of the year,
[00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.380]   well, let me preclude this by saying,
[00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:09.740]   I had the blessing of directing this class
[00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:11.260]   also in Challenge 3.
[00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.580]   So before this year began,
[00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:15.780]   all the moms and I got together
[00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:18.300]   and we really brainstormed together,
[00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:22.580]   how can we make this just a celebratory year
[00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:25.020]   for these exceptional young people?
[00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:28.820]   And one of the ways that we chose to celebrate
[00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:33.420]   was that we actually decided to have a senior thesis retreat
[00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:34.580]   for this class.
[00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:36.460]   And this was no small undertaking.
[00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:40.420]   So there was lots of parent power behind this event,
[00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:43.740]   but we got together and we pulled our resources
[00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:45.740]   and found a lovely place at the beach.
[00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:48.500]   Now, this is not something that is expected
[00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:49.580]   or should be expected.
[00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:51.540]   It was just something as families,
[00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:55.140]   we got together and wanted to give this class as a gift.
[00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:56.380]   We got together,
[00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:59.260]   we found a place where we could stay for a few days.
[00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:02.380]   Every mom signed up to cook a different meal.
[00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:06.060]   We kind of took that upon ourselves
[00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:09.140]   and we went away with this class
[00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:12.020]   so that we could focus on senior thesis.
[00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:13.300]   And I will say this,
[00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:17.100]   we had the best time and we made the best memories,
[00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:19.860]   playing board games together late at night,
[00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:21.700]   going for walks on the beach,
[00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:23.660]   singing together, praying together.
[00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:28.420]   It just was an exceptional celebratory time for them
[00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:32.260]   as we're thinking about the ending of one time
[00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.860]   and the commencement of something wonderful for them
[00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:36.020]   as they move forward.
[00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:37.460]   So that is one way.
[00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:39.900]   And you know, Lisa, with graduation coming up,
[00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:44.500]   my friends, these moms, we've gotten together
[00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:46.900]   and we've actually met every month or so.
[00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:48.300]   I think part of it is a reason
[00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:50.180]   just for us to get together and fellowship.
[00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:52.540]   - Yes, yes, and support each other.
[00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:56.020]   That's one of those milestones that is both a joy
[00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:59.380]   and a little bit of a heart tug
[00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:01.180]   because it's the, like you said,
[00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:04.780]   it's the beginning of something for those kids,
[00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:07.740]   but it's the end of something for those students
[00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:09.220]   and for their parents.
[00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:10.980]   - It's true, it's true.
[00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:14.260]   We have been thinking and planning through ideas
[00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:17.980]   for graduation just to make it personal
[00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:21.620]   and personally celebratory for each of them.
[00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:23.940]   So we are overjoyed with,
[00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:25.980]   we've had conversations with our children
[00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:28.460]   and been thinking through what are the ways
[00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:31.740]   that we can honor God and glorify God
[00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:35.860]   for what He's done for us in this event.
[00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:39.900]   And I think that spirit will, you know,
[00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:42.620]   I think bring that event
[00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:45.780]   to a different celebratory level for all of us.
[00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:48.780]   We're not just celebrating what we've accomplished,
[00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:51.260]   but really we're giving honor to Him
[00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:54.020]   for what He's done through us.
[00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:56.860]   And that to me makes me so excited
[00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:59.700]   to see these young people walk down the aisle
[00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:02.780]   at graduation in just a few short weeks.
[00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:04.220]   - That is, that's awesome.
[00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:07.180]   That is a beautiful presentation
[00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:10.220]   of how we might celebrate a graduation.
[00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:12.580]   And it really brings me right to this next question
[00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:14.060]   I wanted to ask you.
[00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:17.700]   Why is celebrating important?
[00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:19.060]   Why, 'cause you started,
[00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:21.860]   you alluded to that a little bit in your last comment.
[00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:25.300]   Why is it so important for us to celebrate?
[00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:26.620]   - Oh, yeah.
[00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:28.460]   You know, I think when I was younger,
[00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:30.740]   I would have had a completely different answer.
[00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:32.700]   I would have said because it's fun.
[00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:34.140]   - Right, right. - It's fun.
[00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:37.740]   But I think the farther I get along
[00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:39.300]   in our homeschooling journey,
[00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:41.300]   my answer has changed.
[00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:44.020]   And I think my answer now would be
[00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:48.380]   that we need to give honor to whom it is due.
[00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:51.260]   And that's whom with a capital W
[00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:55.900]   because it rightly aligns our children's hearts
[00:11:55.900 --> 00:12:00.140]   to have a soul and a spirit of gratitude to Him.
[00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:04.500]   And so, you know, as we're celebrating these small things,
[00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:06.020]   you know, one thing that comes to mind
[00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:08.740]   is very similar to you, Lisa.
[00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:11.580]   I remember the first time I read the picture book,
[00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:13.620]   "Bread and Jam for Francis"
[00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:16.860]   by Lillian Hoban to my children.
[00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:19.220]   And they were all just, I mean,
[00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:24.060]   very busy foundations-aged students at that time.
[00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:27.420]   And, oh, we just, they were fascinated by the idea
[00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:30.340]   that this little badger would only eat bread and jam
[00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:32.940]   and she wouldn't eat all these delicious things
[00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:34.580]   that her mother had prepared for her.
[00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:38.020]   So we celebrated the end of that book
[00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:40.420]   by eating what else?
[00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:41.940]   Bread and jam.
[00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:43.460]   And it was such a little thing.
[00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:46.900]   But I remember at that time,
[00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:51.100]   those were the first awakenings in my mama heart
[00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:55.060]   of, Lord, thank you for giving me this opportunity
[00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:58.620]   to share this experience with these three young people.
[00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:00.620]   And, you know, for me, you know, for them,
[00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:02.780]   it was bread and jam and we read a great story.
[00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:05.580]   But for me, it was, thank you, Lord,
[00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:09.660]   for this opportunity that you provided for me as a mom
[00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:12.060]   to experience this with my babies.
[00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:15.540]   So I think, you know, as time has elapsed,
[00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:17.740]   you know, like all good things, you know,
[00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:20.660]   I hopefully have grown in wisdom
[00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:23.500]   and realizing that, you know,
[00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:25.940]   all good gifts are given by him.
[00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:29.220]   And celebrating is giving honor to him
[00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:32.180]   for the good things that he's entrusted us with
[00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:34.260]   and that he's allowed us to experience.
[00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.660]   And good, as you said before,
[00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:40.860]   not always super happy, super joyful.
[00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:44.180]   Good sometimes means growing as well.
[00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:47.260]   And so being able to recognize that in our celebrations
[00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.260]   I think is also valuable.
[00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:50.180]   - I love that.
[00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:52.060]   There's so much wisdom in that.
[00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:57.060]   Celebration is not just for hurraying the end of the year
[00:13:57.060 --> 00:14:02.740]   or the end of a hard task, or, you know,
[00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:06.780]   I never have to do this again, or this went so well.
[00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:08.860]   But celebrating is also, I love it,
[00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:13.860]   a lovely chance to look back and embrace
[00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:17.900]   recognize and embrace what we've learned
[00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:21.500]   and recognize the guiding hand of a good father
[00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:23.380]   who has led us in this way.
[00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:26.100]   I love that so very much.
[00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:29.980]   Now, I know Kelly, you and I have both graduated some kids
[00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:32.300]   and we have been able to celebrate that,
[00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:37.100]   but we have lots of families at all different points
[00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:38.540]   on their homeschooling journey.
[00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:40.820]   So not everybody's graduated.
[00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:42.260]   I want you to look back.
[00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:47.260]   You've had lots of CC milestones to celebrate.
[00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:53.340]   Name some other ones that you had with your children
[00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:55.380]   and you continue to have with your children
[00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:57.660]   that maybe lead up to graduation
[00:14:57.660 --> 00:15:01.220]   so we can all get in on this celebration conversation.
[00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:03.140]   - Well, and you know, Lisa, just thinking about that
[00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:04.860]   and reflecting on that,
[00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:08.500]   I just, that in itself is worthy of celebration.
[00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:10.980]   Just thinking about all those stones of memory
[00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:13.260]   that we have.
[00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:17.740]   And, you know, I think back to the very earliest days,
[00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:21.180]   I remember our first day of classical conversations.
[00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:23.700]   I had two very wiggly little boys
[00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:26.780]   and a baby and a carrier and a baby carrier
[00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:28.620]   who sat in the corner of the classroom
[00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:30.580]   and slept peacefully and rocked
[00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:33.460]   and was cooed over and loved over.
[00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:37.220]   I remember we were so early in our journey
[00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:39.620]   that we did not stay for essentials.
[00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:41.060]   - Right, right.
[00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:44.860]   - And I remember that first day we even celebrated.
[00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:47.020]   We got in the car and if I'm not mistaken,
[00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:48.420]   we drove through a drive-through
[00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:50.940]   and got a Frosty or something like that
[00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:53.660]   just to celebrate that first day.
[00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:56.100]   And, you know, that has only morphed
[00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:59.900]   into greater celebrations for different things.
[00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:03.020]   You know, I had children who were memory masters
[00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:06.580]   and obviously that is something worthy of celebration.
[00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:08.540]   But I also had children who,
[00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:11.180]   that was just not their priority.
[00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:12.860]   They mastered the material,
[00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:15.020]   but they just were not,
[00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:17.180]   they were not interested in that.
[00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:19.380]   - Like showmen, yes, exactly.
[00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:20.220]   - Right, right.
[00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:24.300]   And so, you know, we found ways to celebrate that at home.
[00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:25.180]   You know, it could have been,
[00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:28.540]   I remember cooking favorite meals
[00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:30.580]   as a time of celebration
[00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:33.180]   and, you know, making desserts and that kind of thing.
[00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:36.300]   You know, food, good food is never a miss
[00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:38.340]   at a celebration. - Never, never.
[00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:40.900]   - But, you know, I also,
[00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:43.340]   some of our celebrations were as simple
[00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:46.140]   as just going around the table and saying,
[00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:48.900]   you know, "I'm proud of you because you did this,"
[00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:50.900]   or telling one another, you know,
[00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:55.900]   "I am grateful for God's gifting of this in you that I see."
[00:16:55.900 --> 00:17:00.980]   You know, simple things like that are also celebratory.
[00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:05.340]   I do know there were some very large celebrations
[00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:09.140]   in our household when capstone events in Challenge
[00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:11.220]   came to pass, like Science Fair.
[00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:13.940]   I think we celebrated the end of a refrigerator
[00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:17.100]   full of pickles. - Oh, my gosh, yes, yes.
[00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:20.660]   - For our middle son who was about to graduate this year
[00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:22.380]   in my Challenge 4 class.
[00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:24.780]   And, you know, I think he really delighted
[00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:26.420]   in emptying all the pickle juice
[00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:28.780]   out of our refrigerator after that.
[00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:31.580]   I know I was glad to have the refrigerator space back.
[00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:33.860]   But, you know, I think, you know, we,
[00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:36.580]   as I've seen my children grow,
[00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:38.740]   I see them recognizing things
[00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:40.700]   that are worthy of celebrating.
[00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:43.860]   And, you know, we really are in a season of celebration
[00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:46.220]   as a family because our eldest,
[00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:49.100]   who graduated from Challenge 4 several years ago,
[00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:52.700]   is graduating with his undergraduate degree this year.
[00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:53.860]   So in the month of May,
[00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:57.020]   we literally have back-to-back-to-back
[00:17:57.020 --> 00:17:59.740]   celebrations of graduation. - Oh, my goodness, yeah.
[00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:04.620]   - So, you know, I'm grateful for that family culture
[00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:09.620]   of celebrating, giving honor when it is due
[00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:12.540]   because it knits our hearts together
[00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:15.860]   and it directs our vision to be grateful
[00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:17.460]   to the one that has allowed us
[00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:20.460]   to experience these things together.
[00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:23.700]   And so, you know, I look back over our time
[00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:26.860]   in Classical Conversations, what a gift.
[00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:29.980]   You know, I think if I was gonna have a celebratory party
[00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:32.300]   when we get to the end of our homeschooling journey,
[00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:35.820]   which, interestingly, is only three years away,
[00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:37.980]   when did that happen? - Oh, my goodness.
[00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:40.700]   Don't blink anymore or you'll miss it.
[00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:42.100]   - Exactly, exactly.
[00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:43.580]   You know, I look at that and I think,
[00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:45.100]   if I were having a party
[00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:47.380]   at the end of our homeschool journey,
[00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:51.580]   the best gift would be the collective experience
[00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:53.100]   that we've had together as a family.
[00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:54.940]   Because in years to come,
[00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:57.340]   that is a gift that in my mind's eye,
[00:18:57.340 --> 00:19:02.340]   I can take out and I can enjoy time and time again.
[00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:05.340]   And there's no greater blessing, I think,
[00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:07.300]   for a homeschooling parent
[00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:09.820]   than to have the gift of those memories.
[00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:10.860]   - You are so right.
[00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:14.420]   And I really appreciate what you had to say
[00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:17.180]   about the simple ways to celebrate,
[00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:20.300]   like around the dinner table, taking turns,
[00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:25.300]   telling one another what you're proudest of in someone else
[00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:27.580]   and just sharing those memories.
[00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:32.340]   I love that when we celebrate together, you said it,
[00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:36.860]   we knit our hearts together more closely.
[00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:39.620]   And when we celebrate one another,
[00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:42.380]   it teaches, when we do that within the context
[00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:44.940]   of our family and our homeschool journey,
[00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:49.940]   it teaches us very well how to love others
[00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:51.180]   well.
[00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:56.620]   I can remember my younger daughter
[00:19:56.620 --> 00:20:00.620]   was not much of one for being in the limelight.
[00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:01.700]   She did not.
[00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:04.540]   Now my older daughter, she just, you know,
[00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:07.340]   she thought it was lucky that everybody got to hear
[00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:09.060]   the stories she had to tell.
[00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:10.380]   So she was always happy.
[00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:13.260]   She was very happy to tell what she was excited about.
[00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:16.580]   So presentations were not a burden to her.
[00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:18.980]   My younger daughter did not like
[00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:20.700]   to be the center of attention.
[00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:23.340]   Even when she had something to say,
[00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:25.300]   she didn't really want to say it to a big crowd.
[00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:27.900]   And so I can remember one week when she was,
[00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:30.700]   you know, it seemed to me out of reason,
[00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:33.140]   worked up about her presentation.
[00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:35.380]   And it was important to her big sister
[00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:40.260]   to go and attend her little sister's class
[00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:43.900]   so she could be there for her presentation.
[00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:49.580]   And she celebrated her sister's triumph
[00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:53.980]   by being there and smiling at her
[00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:57.420]   and offering her a hug at the end.
[00:20:57.420 --> 00:21:01.020]   And that, those little pieces,
[00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:03.180]   that's a celebration, y'all.
[00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:05.580]   It's not just a party.
[00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:08.740]   It's not just a big extravagant trip.
[00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:11.060]   That's not the only way to celebrate.
[00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:14.860]   We celebrate one another with a hug and a smile
[00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:18.420]   and an acknowledgement of I'm proud of you
[00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:20.580]   or this doesn't seem like a big thing,
[00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:22.740]   but for you, this was huge.
[00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:23.940]   And I love that.
[00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:25.020]   I love that.
[00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:30.180]   Are your kids natural celebrators too, Kelly?
[00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:33.380]   Your family celebrates lots of things, I know.
[00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:36.260]   Are your kids all natural celebrators?
[00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:38.420]   Do they embrace your celebrations
[00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:41.580]   or do they kind of go along with mama?
[00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:46.060]   Well, there's an element of that, yes.
[00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:49.860]   I would say that one of my three, my youngest,
[00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:52.860]   we jokingly say is a party everywhere she goes.
[00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:56.780]   And her birthday happens to be on Cinco de Mayo.
[00:21:56.780 --> 00:22:00.860]   So she fully embraces that as part of her personality.
[00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:05.060]   And I look at her and the way that God has created her
[00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:07.940]   with that desire for celebration.
[00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:10.740]   And I am hopeful that someday
[00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:14.420]   I will be a grandmother and I will see her as a mom
[00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:17.260]   doing some of these same goofy, kooky things
[00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:21.340]   that we have done together.
[00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:23.500]   I love that.
[00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:24.340]   I love that.
[00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:29.060]   I do think that, so listeners out there
[00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:31.940]   who may be big celebrators and you have kids
[00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:33.180]   that kind of roll their eyes
[00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:36.500]   and go along with your exuberant enthusiasm,
[00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:39.180]   what I want you to know is that you may be making
[00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:42.340]   more of an impression on your children than you think,
[00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:45.900]   that maybe they are closet celebrators
[00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:48.620]   or when they get out and they are responsible
[00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:52.500]   in their own homes for celebrating, they will.
[00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:57.500]   I have become a grandmother in the last year and a half
[00:22:57.500 --> 00:23:01.860]   and I absolutely love seeing my daughter
[00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:06.860]   having small daily celebrations of discovery
[00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:09.100]   with my grandson, Gideon.
[00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:11.140]   It blessed my heart.
[00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:14.460]   My daughter sent me a Snapchat one day of a picture.
[00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:18.900]   She had spread a plastic tablecloth in her living room
[00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:22.980]   and had filled a little basin with water
[00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:26.820]   and given my grandson all kinds of cups and things
[00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:28.780]   to play in this water with.
[00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:30.740]   He's so fascinated with water
[00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:33.500]   and he can't really reach any of their sinks well.
[00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:38.500]   And so she was celebrating his enthusiasm
[00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:42.780]   for discovery and it blessed my heart to think
[00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:47.220]   she knows how to celebrate the small moment
[00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:49.500]   that you were thinking, talking about, Kelly,
[00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:54.500]   the small moment of discovery that we can encourage
[00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:58.780]   in our children and experience with our children
[00:23:58.780 --> 00:23:59.900]   as they grow up.
[00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:02.780]   And I just love that, I just love it.
[00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:04.900]   - Well, and you know, Lisa, I will add,
[00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:07.780]   I have one other child who is not as inclined
[00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:09.300]   to be celebratory.
[00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:12.140]   But now that he is forging his own path in life,
[00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:16.500]   when things do happen, he makes sure to let us know
[00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:19.100]   so that we celebrate with him.
[00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:22.540]   And so, you know, I can't help but think you're right.
[00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:24.460]   You know, at the time you may think,
[00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:28.220]   oh, I am casting seed on very dry ground,
[00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:31.300]   but it may be taking root in ways
[00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:33.980]   that you don't realize quite yet.
[00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:36.180]   Because, you know, it's funny when we all sit
[00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:39.260]   around the table and we say, oh, do you remember the time
[00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:42.140]   that, and fill in the blank here, you know,
[00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:46.420]   it brings to mind all of those great celebratory memories
[00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:48.220]   that we have together as a family.
[00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:50.340]   And that is a wonderful thing.
[00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:51.940]   - And you know what, you just remind me,
[00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:54.620]   another thing that celebration does for us
[00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:57.220]   is cement our relationships.
[00:24:57.220 --> 00:25:00.060]   Because we do harken back, do you remember that?
[00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:02.220]   And times that we have celebrated together.
[00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:04.980]   And every time you celebrate with your family,
[00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:07.380]   you're building another memory,
[00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:10.660]   you're building another shared experience.
[00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:14.300]   And so I really think that celebrating
[00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:16.660]   cements our relationships.
[00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:18.700]   So when we celebrate with our family,
[00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:20.740]   when we celebrate with our friends,
[00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:25.020]   with our challenge class, with our broader CC community,
[00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:30.020]   we are cementing those bonds that hold us together.
[00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:33.500]   And that's another good reason to celebrate,
[00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:37.420]   to build family, to build community.
[00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:41.460]   All right, so I know we wanna talk about,
[00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:44.060]   we wanna think about what it means
[00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:48.220]   to celebrate classically, okay?
[00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:49.580]   How do we celebrate classically?
[00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:53.580]   How might celebrating classically be different
[00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:56.900]   from non-classical celebrations?
[00:25:56.900 --> 00:26:00.340]   What do we even mean by celebrating classically?
[00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:04.620]   - Yeah, it's funny when I think about this,
[00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:05.900]   when my children were young,
[00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:09.140]   I don't think I specifically honed in on the fact
[00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:14.060]   that I was using classical tools to celebrate, but I was.
[00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:18.380]   And that is just further proof that it is a natural way
[00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:22.220]   for us to embrace the world around us that God has created.
[00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:25.260]   So when I think about the celebrations
[00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:28.860]   that we have as families, I think definitely,
[00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:33.220]   we utilize all five of the core habits when we celebrate.
[00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:37.220]   We are naming those things that have been accomplished
[00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:40.700]   or that have been done and that we want to remember,
[00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:43.900]   we are attending to the people
[00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:46.820]   that were involved in those events,
[00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:50.420]   attending to the growth that has happened
[00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:54.340]   or the accomplishment that has been made.
[00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:57.620]   Hopefully we're committing to memory those things,
[00:26:57.620 --> 00:27:01.820]   like we talked about before, that we're memorizing,
[00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:06.460]   we're committing those acts of memory to our hearts
[00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:07.980]   so that we can recall them,
[00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:12.380]   that family fabric is knit in those moments.
[00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:14.940]   And obviously we're expressing,
[00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:17.420]   when we're having our celebrations,
[00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:20.740]   we're proclaiming God's goodness to us,
[00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:25.740]   we're proclaiming what things have been accomplished.
[00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:30.300]   And we're telling a story, whether we realize it or not,
[00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:34.420]   we're telling a story of God's goodness to that individual,
[00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:37.580]   God's goodness to our family.
[00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:38.780]   What happened?
[00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:40.220]   How do we see Him better?
[00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:44.100]   How do we know Him better through this thing
[00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:46.020]   that we're celebrating together?
[00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:49.220]   So I can definitely see in retrospect,
[00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:52.620]   and I'm thankful for God's mercy in that,
[00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:57.180]   utilizing all five of those core habits,
[00:27:57.180 --> 00:27:59.300]   even when my children were small.
[00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:01.540]   And I think moving forward into the future,
[00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:04.420]   now that I have a greater awareness of that,
[00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:07.460]   I hope that I can use those tools more effectively
[00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:11.460]   in our celebrations moving forward.
[00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:15.340]   But when I think about celebrating classically,
[00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:21.580]   I think those tools and utilizing them, wielding them well,
[00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:26.020]   is a way for us to continue to push our children
[00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:31.020]   toward this culture of just joyful remembrance
[00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:33.900]   or those things.
[00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:37.900]   And I really, it's a good question.
[00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:39.780]   Lisa, I wish we'd recorded this podcast
[00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:42.140]   maybe about 10 or 15 years ago.
[00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:44.900]   - I know, I know, but you know what?
[00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:47.180]   Here's the thing, and this I hope is an encouragement
[00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:49.460]   to you guys who are listening.
[00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:51.740]   Here's the thing, 10 or 15 years ago,
[00:28:51.740 --> 00:28:53.780]   we didn't know what we know now
[00:28:53.780 --> 00:28:56.380]   because the beautiful thing, y'all,
[00:28:56.380 --> 00:29:01.380]   is that God is educating us as we educate our children.
[00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:04.500]   He is not done with me.
[00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:06.220]   I am still learning things.
[00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:08.780]   And I look back and think, man,
[00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:10.380]   my children could have benefited
[00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:12.660]   from some of this stuff that I'm learning.
[00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:17.060]   And I'm certain that they wish that they had had as a mama,
[00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:20.140]   this woman that their children have as a lolly,
[00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:23.380]   because she is a lot more intentional
[00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:28.060]   and a lot more delighted by things
[00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:29.980]   that used to irritate her.
[00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:34.980]   And I think, so listeners, here's the thing.
[00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:39.500]   Keep growing in who you are and don't despair
[00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:42.620]   that you never used to celebrate this way
[00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:45.780]   or you didn't think celebration was important.
[00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:48.020]   And, oh, look at all the years I've missed.
[00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:52.940]   No, look at all that the Lord is gonna open up to you
[00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:56.820]   and your family now that you are perhaps
[00:29:56.820 --> 00:29:59.540]   more committed to celebrating
[00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:04.540]   and more aware of how to do it well and joyfully.
[00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:06.980]   - I love that, Lisa.
[00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:10.780]   And, you know, when we were initially talking
[00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:14.380]   about this topic, a part of one of my favorite books
[00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:17.100]   came to mind and I had to look online for a quote
[00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:19.940]   and it deals with that very thing.
[00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:22.620]   It's from "The Last Battle,"
[00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:25.700]   the last book in the "Chronicles of Narnia" series.
[00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:28.580]   And I just, when I was thinking about celebrating
[00:30:28.580 --> 00:30:32.220]   and, you know, thinking about how God has been so good
[00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:34.860]   to our family over our years in classical conversations,
[00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:36.620]   this quote came to mind.
[00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:38.260]   All their life in this world
[00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:40.420]   and all their adventures in Narnia
[00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:43.420]   had only been the cover and the title page.
[00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:46.740]   Now at last they were beginning chapter one
[00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:50.500]   of the great story which no one on earth has read,
[00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:52.500]   which goes on forever,
[00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:56.940]   in which every chapter is better than the one before.
[00:30:56.940 --> 00:31:00.460]   And I just, that quote, I just revel in that
[00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:03.220]   as a homeschool mom because, you know,
[00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:06.900]   we can't get caught up in this comparison or OFI only.
[00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:10.900]   And the truth is every chapter
[00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:12.540]   will be better than the one before.
[00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:14.860]   This is just the beginning
[00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:18.780]   and there will always be something to celebrate
[00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:22.220]   if you look closely enough.
[00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:26.180]   And, you know, thinking about our homeschooling is just,
[00:31:26.180 --> 00:31:28.180]   you know, this is just the warmup party
[00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:30.980]   for a great celebration in heaven.
[00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:33.900]   I kind of think about that on community days
[00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:36.260]   when we get together and we're all in the lunchroom
[00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:39.460]   and we're all talking together and, you know, fellowshipping.
[00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:42.020]   Like what a great warmup party
[00:31:42.020 --> 00:31:44.620]   for the celebration that is to come.
[00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:49.380]   And I think C.S. Lewis just captures that idea so well.
[00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:50.860]   And as a homeschool mom,
[00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:55.140]   I latch onto that so tightly as words of wisdom.
[00:31:55.140 --> 00:31:57.700]   This is just the cover and the title page.
[00:31:57.700 --> 00:32:02.420]   This is just the warmup party for what is to come.
[00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:04.180]   - Oh my gosh, it gave me chills
[00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:05.460]   when you were reading that quote.
[00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:08.540]   I thought, yes, yes, that is it.
[00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:11.780]   That is what we need to do because here's the thing.
[00:32:11.780 --> 00:32:15.100]   Some of you listening may be thinking,
[00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:17.500]   yes, we have some celebrations coming up,
[00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:19.020]   but they're sort of sad.
[00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:23.460]   You know, my last child is finishing foundations
[00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:27.660]   or, oh wow, I don't have a baby anymore
[00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:31.180]   or man, I'll never do Challenge Egg.
[00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:33.260]   I'll never do the science fair again.
[00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:35.540]   Okay, so I admit there's some sad
[00:32:35.540 --> 00:32:38.100]   and happy in that remembrance.
[00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:42.900]   But lots of us are looking at last times
[00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:45.660]   and feeling that it's a little bit bittersweet.
[00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:49.900]   And some days that bitter feels more than the sweet does.
[00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:53.540]   So that quote is awesome in reminding us
[00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:57.060]   that the best is yet to be that,
[00:32:57.060 --> 00:32:59.300]   and I love that, that it's a prelude
[00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:01.220]   for the party we'll have in heaven.
[00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:04.460]   That is going to take me through a lot of dark days, friend.
[00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:09.020]   So I appreciate that picture that you've put in my mind.
[00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:13.340]   But for all of us, it behooves us
[00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:19.620]   to remember that there are good things ahead.
[00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:23.140]   And as much as we have loved all of the seasons
[00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:26.180]   that our children have been in, we
[00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:30.700]   are going to love them as they grow also.
[00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:33.580]   And we are so blessed that the Lord lets
[00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:37.900]   us see so much of what there is to celebrate
[00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:39.900]   in their growth and their development
[00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:45.620]   as we spend all those hours with them homeschooling.
[00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:48.940]   All right, I want us to spend a few minutes thinking
[00:33:48.940 --> 00:33:53.820]   about some of the milestones that our families might
[00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:58.860]   be celebrating now and brainstorming some ways.
[00:33:58.860 --> 00:34:04.340]   I have to tell y'all, Kelly has inventing in her blood,
[00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:07.620]   and so she can come up with-- if you came up
[00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:11.460]   with a situation that needed to be celebrated,
[00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:13.140]   she could probably, inside of a minute,
[00:34:13.140 --> 00:34:15.700]   give you six really fun ideas.
[00:34:15.700 --> 00:34:19.540]   So Kelly, we are going to think about together
[00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:21.740]   some of the milestones that families might
[00:34:21.740 --> 00:34:25.860]   be getting ready to celebrate and then brainstorm some ways
[00:34:25.860 --> 00:34:29.140]   that maybe we could celebrate this spring.
[00:34:29.140 --> 00:34:30.460]   So what have you got, girl?
[00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:31.180]   Oh, so good.
[00:34:31.180 --> 00:34:32.420]   Well, there are so many things.
[00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:34.700]   There's always something to celebrate, right?
[00:34:34.700 --> 00:34:36.100]   I mean, if we look closely enough,
[00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:37.540]   we can always find something.
[00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:40.980]   Maybe you are a new CC family.
[00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:45.580]   Maybe this is your very first year or maybe
[00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:49.660]   your first semester in Classical Conversations.
[00:34:49.660 --> 00:34:56.300]   I would strongly encourage you to celebrate that as a family.
[00:34:56.300 --> 00:35:00.020]   It can be something as simple as taking out your foundations
[00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:03.980]   curriculum and having everyone sign a page inside
[00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:07.260]   and stating it and thinking about, OK,
[00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:08.860]   let's sit around the table.
[00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:11.420]   Let's order some pizza or have our favorite meal,
[00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:14.420]   and let's just talk about our memories from this year.
[00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:17.060]   What was the funniest thing that happened this year?
[00:35:17.060 --> 00:35:20.500]   What is the most unexpected thing
[00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:21.940]   that you learned about this year?
[00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:25.660]   Because there's a lot of unexpected in our curriculum
[00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:29.140]   and a lot of fun and discovery.
[00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:31.660]   So thinking about a celebration like that
[00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:35.900]   is wonderful for a new to CC family.
[00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:38.540]   And I think if you have little ones,
[00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:43.940]   celebrate the, quote unquote, "last day of homeschool"
[00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:46.740]   by getting outside, if the weather allows,
[00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:49.540]   and thinking of things that you can do together.
[00:35:49.540 --> 00:35:52.660]   Take your little ones and a big bucket of sidewalk chalk,
[00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:54.900]   go out and let them write their favorite piece
[00:35:54.900 --> 00:35:56.580]   or draw a picture of their favorite memory
[00:35:56.580 --> 00:35:58.980]   work from this year.
[00:35:58.980 --> 00:36:01.940]   We decorated the driveway so many times
[00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:03.780]   at the end of community years.
[00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:06.220]   And it was so much fun and cheap.
[00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:10.300]   And after, when we were done, I would have them come inside
[00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:11.740]   and we would eat freezer pops, and we
[00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:13.260]   would laugh and talk together.
[00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:16.180]   It was not-- celebrations do not have
[00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:20.220]   to come at great monetary expense to you
[00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:21.700]   and your family.
[00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:25.740]   Quite often, it is the spirit with which things are done
[00:36:25.740 --> 00:36:27.620]   that makes them celebratory.
[00:36:27.620 --> 00:36:28.700]   Oh, that is so true.
[00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:33.060]   I know that my kids, they, at church--
[00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:35.180]   we had a couple of homeschool families in our church,
[00:36:35.180 --> 00:36:38.860]   but most of my girls' friends at church
[00:36:38.860 --> 00:36:40.060]   were public school kids.
[00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:42.100]   And at the end of the year, you know what happens?
[00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:48.940]   They have award ceremonies, and they have field trips,
[00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:50.500]   but they have field day.
[00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:53.180]   And my girls were like, field day?
[00:36:53.180 --> 00:36:55.700]   What is field-- why do we not have field day?
[00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:58.380]   And so we had funny field day.
[00:36:58.380 --> 00:37:01.420]   And so we didn't do the shot put and the 50-yard dash
[00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:02.740]   because there was just two of them,
[00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:04.420]   and I didn't want to run around my house.
[00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:07.940]   But we did silly field days, like throw a ball,
[00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:11.740]   throw a football through this hula hoop suspended in the tree.
[00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:15.340]   And can you jump over this big pan of water
[00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:16.900]   without getting your feet wet?
[00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:18.140]   Those kind of things.
[00:37:18.140 --> 00:37:23.940]   So you can make up silly end-of-the-year rituals.
[00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:27.180]   Well, and I say rituals because you, as the parent,
[00:37:27.180 --> 00:37:29.940]   might intend that this was going to happen once.
[00:37:29.940 --> 00:37:32.020]   But if it's a success, your children
[00:37:32.020 --> 00:37:35.340]   are going to think they're going to take that as a tradition.
[00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:37.620]   And you will have committed to it for life
[00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:40.780]   or till they get too old to admit to liking it.
[00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:43.140]   Yes, for sure, for sure.
[00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:45.420]   Be aware of what you might be committing yourself to.
[00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:48.060]   Exactly, friend, exactly.
[00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:49.580]   Well, and I would say this, too.
[00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:51.060]   Thinking about our younger families,
[00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:55.700]   if you do have a student who has been heavily invested
[00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:58.420]   in preparing for Memory Master, whether or not
[00:37:58.420 --> 00:38:01.380]   your child is successful in that final proof
[00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:05.380]   or not, celebrate the accomplishment.
[00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:07.700]   You know your child better than anyone.
[00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:10.220]   So if ice cream is their love language,
[00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:13.900]   regardless of the outcome, take them for a scoop of ice cream
[00:38:13.900 --> 00:38:16.140]   or get a container of their favorite.
[00:38:16.140 --> 00:38:20.300]   Find their currency and their love language
[00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:24.220]   and love on them in a way that says, I'm proud of you.
[00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:25.700]   I see what you did.
[00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:28.980]   I appreciate your commitment and how you are growing.
[00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:31.620]   And that will mean the world to them.
[00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:34.340]   And thinking about our Challenge students,
[00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:37.100]   there are so many things to celebrate
[00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:40.420]   when your child is in Challenge.
[00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:43.260]   Jokingly, the Challenge 4 moms, who
[00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:46.340]   are my friends, who are also graduating children this year,
[00:38:46.340 --> 00:38:49.060]   we have called them the last of the first
[00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:52.220]   and the first of the last this year.
[00:38:52.220 --> 00:38:55.340]   And we are planning a celebration
[00:38:55.340 --> 00:38:59.340]   for the very last day of Challenge 4,
[00:38:59.340 --> 00:39:00.940]   which ironically will also happen
[00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:04.260]   to be their senior thesis defense day.
[00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:09.300]   But I mentioned earlier the senior thesis retreat
[00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:12.300]   that we took the class on at the beginning of the year.
[00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:14.420]   They had such a good time that one of the moms
[00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:17.100]   actually took it upon herself to organize a trip
[00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:21.860]   to bookend the end of the year for all of these Challenge 4
[00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:22.820]   students as well.
[00:39:22.820 --> 00:39:24.500]   So I'm grateful.
[00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:28.180]   Celebrating definitely should not be done always in isolation.
[00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:30.620]   Sometimes there are family celebrations.
[00:39:30.620 --> 00:39:33.900]   But it's also wonderful to celebrate with others around
[00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:35.980]   you in your community.
[00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:39.540]   So if you are involved in a CC community
[00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:42.180]   and you are looking for ways to celebrate,
[00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:45.820]   quite often if you just open your mouth and say,
[00:39:45.820 --> 00:39:47.980]   hey, I was thinking we should have--
[00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:51.420]   I guarantee you, you'll have a mom who will look at you who
[00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:54.260]   may also be a natural celebrator who will say,
[00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:55.620]   I have some ideas.
[00:39:55.620 --> 00:39:59.300]   So definitely harness that community brainpower
[00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:02.660]   so that at the end of the year, our students can look back
[00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:05.420]   and say, yeah, look what God did.
[00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:06.860]   I'm so grateful for Him.
[00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:10.540]   And I'm grateful for the people and for the experiences.
[00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:11.740]   Isn't He good?
[00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:14.140]   Because really, truly, when you boil down
[00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:16.380]   to the heart of celebration, that
[00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:19.020]   is what it's all about, recognizing God's goodness
[00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:20.060]   to us.
[00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:23.260]   And like I said before, it's all a big warm-up party
[00:40:23.260 --> 00:40:26.180]   for that celebration that we'll have in heaven together
[00:40:26.180 --> 00:40:30.620]   as one big community, which is also a beautiful thing
[00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:31.820]   to think about.
[00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:33.620]   But yeah, thinking about celebrations
[00:40:33.620 --> 00:40:38.300]   with your community and just brainstorming together also,
[00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:40.740]   like we mentioned before, builds that-- it
[00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:44.860]   weaves that relationship fabric not only with your family,
[00:40:44.860 --> 00:40:47.500]   but weaves your family's fabric together
[00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:49.700]   with others in your community.
[00:40:49.700 --> 00:40:52.460]   And I guarantee you, Lisa, like you warned us,
[00:40:52.460 --> 00:40:55.260]   it won't be the first time that you celebrate together.
[00:40:55.260 --> 00:40:56.220]   That's right.
[00:40:56.220 --> 00:40:57.260]   That happens.
[00:40:57.260 --> 00:40:58.540]   That's exactly right.
[00:40:58.540 --> 00:40:59.420]   I love that.
[00:40:59.420 --> 00:41:04.540]   There are so many ways to celebrate, both personally
[00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:08.500]   and in your family and in your community.
[00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:10.140]   But you've given us a lot of good things
[00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:14.420]   to think about, Kelly, a lot of good reasons to celebrate.
[00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:22.300]   It's not just a frivolous end to a serious endeavor.
[00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:27.540]   There are real reasons why we should celebrate.
[00:41:27.540 --> 00:41:30.940]   And how we can celebrate classically
[00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:31.980]   is a big part of that.
[00:41:31.980 --> 00:41:36.460]   I loved that you brought out the five core habits so naturally.
[00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:37.620]   And as we thought--
[00:41:37.620 --> 00:41:41.460]   I kept filtering everything you said after that.
[00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:42.420]   I filtered through.
[00:41:42.420 --> 00:41:44.780]   Well, that is how we would do that classically.
[00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:49.260]   We would name what it is we were celebrating
[00:41:49.260 --> 00:41:51.700]   so that we could all talk about it,
[00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:53.460]   so that it would resonate with all of us,
[00:41:53.460 --> 00:41:56.340]   so that we would all recognize this thing.
[00:41:56.340 --> 00:42:02.260]   And when we attend to the individual successes
[00:42:02.260 --> 00:42:05.580]   and individual victories, big or small,
[00:42:05.580 --> 00:42:12.140]   that our students have, I think what it builds is honor.
[00:42:12.140 --> 00:42:13.660]   We honor one another.
[00:42:13.660 --> 00:42:19.140]   Because child number one may not have any trouble reading,
[00:42:19.140 --> 00:42:22.700]   but child number two may have had a lot more struggle
[00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:24.700]   and effort to read well.
[00:42:24.700 --> 00:42:29.460]   So celebrating you read your first chapter book
[00:42:29.460 --> 00:42:31.940]   might mean nothing to child one.
[00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:34.940]   But to child two, because you attended
[00:42:34.940 --> 00:42:39.300]   to the effort that was needed, that was really important.
[00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:42.500]   And making those memories together,
[00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:45.620]   that is a classical way to celebrate.
[00:42:45.620 --> 00:42:48.220]   Both remembering what brought us here
[00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:50.500]   and making the memory that is going
[00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:54.380]   to cement that in all of our minds is really good.
[00:42:54.380 --> 00:43:00.500]   And of course, there are so many ways to express celebration.
[00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:06.340]   We are expressing joy and relief and pride when we celebrate,
[00:43:06.340 --> 00:43:10.140]   sometimes by singing or by decorating.
[00:43:10.140 --> 00:43:15.060]   There are lots of ways to express celebration.
[00:43:15.060 --> 00:43:21.860]   And then I especially loved that it was the story that God
[00:43:21.860 --> 00:43:24.900]   is telling through our lives.
[00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:31.060]   And our lives are the continuation of God's story.
[00:43:31.060 --> 00:43:35.700]   And we are just so blessed to be part of that.
[00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:39.780]   This makes me eager to go find something to celebrate today.
[00:43:39.780 --> 00:43:42.460]   Something little, something big, something
[00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:44.420]   I haven't even discovered yet.
[00:43:44.420 --> 00:43:47.900]   And maybe that is the key.
[00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:49.740]   Maybe we should look for something
[00:43:49.740 --> 00:43:53.140]   to celebrate every day.
[00:43:53.140 --> 00:43:54.180]   I love that.
[00:43:54.180 --> 00:43:55.500]   I love that, too.
[00:43:55.500 --> 00:43:58.100]   Maybe we will become everyday educators
[00:43:58.100 --> 00:44:00.340]   who celebrate every day.
[00:44:00.340 --> 00:44:02.180]   Oh, that's a nice little tagline.
[00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:02.900]   I like that.
[00:44:02.900 --> 00:44:03.500]   I like that.
[00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:04.100]   I like that.
[00:44:04.100 --> 00:44:04.900]   Thank you.
[00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:06.700]   Thank you for being with me today.
[00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:10.340]   Thank you for offering these great suggestions.
[00:44:10.340 --> 00:44:13.580]   Kelly, I really appreciate your spirit of celebration.
[00:44:13.580 --> 00:44:15.380]   I always feel like I've been to a party
[00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:18.380]   when I've been with you.
[00:44:18.380 --> 00:44:19.020]   I love that.
[00:44:19.020 --> 00:44:21.860]   And Lisa, today I celebrate my friendship with you
[00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:24.820]   because that is a great thing to celebrate.
[00:44:24.820 --> 00:44:26.940]   Thanks so much for letting me talk about these things
[00:44:26.940 --> 00:44:27.460]   with you.
[00:44:27.460 --> 00:44:29.500]   Thank you, Kelly.
[00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:32.260]   Listeners, I hope that you will find much
[00:44:32.260 --> 00:44:34.100]   to celebrate with your family.
[00:44:34.100 --> 00:44:38.380]   I have something that I think you might want to celebrate.
[00:44:38.380 --> 00:44:40.820]   Have you heard of the Copper Lodge Library?
[00:44:40.820 --> 00:44:46.060]   I know a lot of you may have one of our Echoes storybooks,
[00:44:46.060 --> 00:44:49.860]   Ancient World Echoes and Old World Echoes and New World
[00:44:49.860 --> 00:44:51.260]   Echoes, these stories.
[00:44:51.260 --> 00:44:54.900]   Well, the Copper Lodge Library has a lot more volumes
[00:44:54.900 --> 00:44:56.740]   than just those three.
[00:44:56.740 --> 00:44:59.980]   And one that I want to make you aware of,
[00:44:59.980 --> 00:45:03.260]   a brand new volume that we've just come out with,
[00:45:03.260 --> 00:45:06.500]   is the Copper Lodge Library edition
[00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:08.260]   of Pride and Prejudice.
[00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:11.660]   Now, you're probably not reading it to your eight-year-olds,
[00:45:11.660 --> 00:45:15.860]   but let me tell you this, it is a required resource
[00:45:15.860 --> 00:45:18.300]   for your challenge student.
[00:45:18.300 --> 00:45:25.340]   And so CCMM has produced this Copper Lodge Library edition
[00:45:25.340 --> 00:45:30.300]   to be a beautiful resource for you and your challenge student.
[00:45:30.300 --> 00:45:33.340]   It's a classic novel, but our edition
[00:45:33.340 --> 00:45:36.940]   includes footnotes that give you word definitions
[00:45:36.940 --> 00:45:41.660]   and pronunciations and some historical context that
[00:45:41.660 --> 00:45:43.700]   will really support your lifelong learning
[00:45:43.700 --> 00:45:47.260]   and the conversations that you can have with your student.
[00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:51.260]   It will also enable your student to get a little bit more out
[00:45:51.260 --> 00:45:53.740]   of the story when they don't constantly
[00:45:53.740 --> 00:45:57.860]   have to run to the dictionary to find out the meaning of a word
[00:45:57.860 --> 00:46:01.700]   or what in the world this means in the context of the times
[00:46:01.700 --> 00:46:05.940]   in which the story takes place.
[00:46:05.940 --> 00:46:07.780]   Your students are going to be discussing
[00:46:07.780 --> 00:46:11.260]   the themes of Pride and Prejudice
[00:46:11.260 --> 00:46:13.340]   together in community, and they're
[00:46:13.340 --> 00:46:16.220]   going to use it as a basis of a writing assignment.
[00:46:16.220 --> 00:46:18.140]   But hopefully, they're also going
[00:46:18.140 --> 00:46:21.420]   to find a deep love for this classic piece of literature.
[00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:24.220]   And I think you would be glad to have an edition that you
[00:46:24.220 --> 00:46:27.740]   can keep forever on your shelf as a family heirloom.
[00:46:27.740 --> 00:46:30.700]   So check it out, the Copper Lodge Library.
[00:46:30.700 --> 00:46:33.820]   If you want to find out about this Pride and Prejudice
[00:46:33.820 --> 00:46:37.980]   edition or any of the other Copper Lodge Library titles,
[00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:43.180]   you can learn more at copperlodgelibrary.com.
[00:46:43.180 --> 00:46:45.620]   All right, go find something to celebrate,
[00:46:45.620 --> 00:46:48.940]   whether that be a child, a book, or a frog somebody
[00:46:48.940 --> 00:46:50.340]   caught outside today.
[00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:51.980]   And I'll see you next time.
[00:46:51.980 --> 00:46:53.780]   Bye bye.
[00:46:54.140 --> 00:46:57.500]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:46:57.500 --> 00:46:59.560]   you
