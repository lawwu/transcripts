[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   Today on Radical Personal Finance, we talk student loans,
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.680]   and I introduce you to a brand new sponsor of the show.
[00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.440]   Today we're gonna talk with Mr. Jay Fleischman,
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.640]   past guest of Radical Personal Finance
[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.880]   and host of the Student Loan Show.
[00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.320]   If you've got student loans
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.900]   or if you know somebody who has student loans,
[00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.600]   get a pen and a paper
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.760]   because you're gonna need to take some notes.
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.340]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.760]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:42.020]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance podcast.
[00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.100]   My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host.
[00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.620]   Thank you for being with me today.
[00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.460]   I am excited to bring you today's interview.
[00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.380]   This is my dream of the type of sponsor
[00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:53.840]   that I wanna bring to you,
[00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.220]   where it's a value, value, value, value,
[00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:57.840]   win, win, win, win, win, win, win.
[00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.920]   Today, you're gonna win, Jay's gonna win,
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.180]   and I'm gonna win, and in a moment, I'll tell you how.
[00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.760]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:14.420]   As I've been systematically launching new sponsors
[00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.060]   on the podcast over the last few weeks,
[00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.720]   you should notice the theme.
[00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.680]   And the theme that I want you to notice
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.940]   is that these sponsors are actually relevant,
[00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:23.800]   relevant to you.
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.900]   I haven't just gone out and tried to see,
[00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.060]   well, who's gonna give me a check
[00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.140]   and tried to collect as big of a check as I could
[00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.980]   from anyone that I could.
[00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.620]   Rather, I have specifically chosen individual sponsors
[00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.860]   who I believe will serve you, the audience.
[00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.020]   And today's sponsor that I'm introducing, Jay Fleischman,
[00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.980]   is exactly that type of sponsor.
[00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.080]   And you'll hear the whole story in just a moment,
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.780]   but Jay's a past guest on the show
[00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.040]   and he's got some really great information
[00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.880]   to share with you today.
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.180]   His other episode was very popular on the show,
[00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.300]   downloaded at this point almost,
[00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.220]   I think about 7,000 times so far.
[00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.060]   And after this, now lots more people are gonna go back
[00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.980]   and listen to that show.
[00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.140]   It was filled with content and information,
[00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.160]   and today's show is no different.
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.420]   Jay's a really great guy.
[00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.500]   He, you'll hear in just a moment again,
[00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.380]   the full story of how this sponsorship came to be.
[00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:15.980]   And make sure you got a pen and paper
[00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.140]   because you're gonna wanna take some good notes
[00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.900]   on the content of today's show.
[00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.820]   And this is an episode that you're gonna wanna share
[00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:22.860]   with other people.
[00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.660]   So sit back, relax, and enjoy this interview
[00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.780]   with Mr. Jay Fleischman, host of The Student Loan Show.
[00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.300]   Jay, welcome back to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.740]   - Thanks for having me again, Joshua.
[00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.500]   - So our previous interview was one of those
[00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.340]   sleeper interviews that I didn't expect
[00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:40.580]   to be quite the hit.
[00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.060]   When you contacted me originally and said,
[00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.100]   "Hey, can I come on Radical Personal Finance?"
[00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.780]   I checked you out and I said, "Okay, fine,
[00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.260]   "I'll have you on, it sounds interesting."
[00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.140]   And then in the course of that episode,
[00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.260]   it was episode 214 if listeners haven't heard it,
[00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.820]   I learned more in the course of that interview
[00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.620]   about student loans than I have in a very long time.
[00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.020]   And I realized how I feel woefully ignorant now
[00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.780]   about all the things I didn't know about student loans.
[00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.420]   And I felt like that interview was just you
[00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.860]   kind of giving me, how would you say it colloquially,
[00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.220]   dropping knowledge bombs on me
[00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.860]   minute after minute after minute.
[00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.140]   (laughing)
[00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.900]   And it's been a very popular episode, very highly commented.
[00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.180]   And one of the most important things I've heard about it
[00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.540]   is that it was extremely useful.
[00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.340]   And so today we've got you back for your reprise appearance
[00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.660]   and we're gonna be doing two things.
[00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.620]   Number one, we're gonna be doing another bang up,
[00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.100]   really valuable interview, but we're also launching you
[00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.180]   as an official sponsor of Radical Personal Finance.
[00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.900]   I'm super excited about that.
[00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:37.740]   - Me too.
[00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.100]   - So for those who haven't heard episode 214,
[00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.620]   give us the quick two minute elevator pitch on you,
[00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.760]   what you do and your history and background
[00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.500]   as it pertains to student loans.
[00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.820]   - I am a consumer protection attorney
[00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.740]   and for the past, gosh, three and a half, four years,
[00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:57.300]   I have not only been helping student loan borrowers
[00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.540]   resolve their issues with respect
[00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.300]   to their higher education debt,
[00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.580]   but also teaching other lawyers how to do it as well.
[00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:09.300]   So I am partially responsible for training a growing army
[00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:10.980]   of student loan resolution attorneys.
[00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.140]   We help people with federal student loan issues,
[00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.100]   repayments, default resolution,
[00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.980]   administrative wage garnishments, tax refund offsets,
[00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:25.340]   all of that stuff, as well as private student loans,
[00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.900]   helping people resolve those issues,
[00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.480]   whether it's settlement or a lawsuit defense
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.140]   or dealing with debt collectors,
[00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:36.180]   really the full range of issues that you might have
[00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.340]   when you're up at two o'clock in the morning
[00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.380]   worrying about your student loans.
[00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.900]   - I'll tell you, I was just away as we record this on,
[00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.580]   we're actually recording on a Monday, November 9th.
[00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.420]   I just spent the weekend away visiting some friends
[00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.700]   up in Melbourne at their beach house.
[00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.100]   And these are friends of my wife and I
[00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:54.300]   who are similar in age.
[00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.540]   And we got into the topic of student loans.
[00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:59.180]   And what's incredible, on the way back in the car,
[00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:00.540]   I was asking my wife and I said,
[00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.940]   "Do you know anybody in our age bracket
[00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.600]   "who's really happy with their college,
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.440]   "I'll just say expenses?"
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:09.620]   And we were talking about it.
[00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.160]   And I know some people who are happy
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.580]   with their college experience.
[00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.380]   They had a good time, they partied a lot.
[00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.580]   I know some people who are happy with their college degree.
[00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.220]   It opened doors to them.
[00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:22.340]   But almost all of our friends whose college experience
[00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:23.860]   is still following them down the road
[00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.380]   in the form of their student loans,
[00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:30.380]   it's amazing how much they loathe and detest this debt.
[00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:34.180]   And so you got your work cut out for you
[00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.260]   in the population at large.
[00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.180]   - Yeah, it's really a great way to turn a party
[00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:41.500]   into a downer experience.
[00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:42.860]   You just mentioned student loans
[00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.660]   and then suddenly the music goes off
[00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.020]   and the lights go dim and everybody gets sad about it.
[00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:49.320]   But you're absolutely right.
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.100]   There's so much out there.
[00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.700]   It's well over a trillion dollars.
[00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:57.180]   The average student loan debt is,
[00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:02.180]   I believe now it's at $34,000 on average per graduate,
[00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.940]   which is just enormous.
[00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.800]   The amount of default is just off the charts.
[00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:13.980]   Overall, the number is one in three student loans
[00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:17.860]   are in default or past due.
[00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.260]   And that includes the ones that are not currently
[00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.600]   in repayment because so many people,
[00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.560]   what they do is they'll come out of school
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.200]   and they'll put themselves into a forbearance.
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:30.140]   Or I actually know a lot of people
[00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:32.860]   that have gone back to school, to a community college,
[00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:36.620]   to an online college, just to take enough credits
[00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:40.260]   so that they don't come out of their in-school deferment
[00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:41.300]   on their student loans.
[00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:44.060]   And so of course, they're racking up more debt
[00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:47.060]   while just because they don't want to,
[00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:50.300]   they don't have the ability to pay back the existing debt.
[00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:51.780]   So it's hamsters on wheels.
[00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:55.220]   - In theory, can you do that into perpetuity,
[00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:58.220]   defer the loans by just continually taking classes?
[00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:01.420]   - In theory, yes.
[00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:04.500]   And as I said, there are a large number of people
[00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:07.020]   who do it because when you are in school,
[00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:09.700]   your federal student loans go into an automatic
[00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:11.620]   in-school deferment.
[00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:14.900]   Your private student loans, a lot of them do have limits
[00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:16.860]   on how long you can defer.
[00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:21.860]   It's as if the banks are onto the game
[00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:24.380]   and so they want to cut that short.
[00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:28.300]   But even in those cases, you could roll this thing
[00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:30.440]   for a decade or better.
[00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:33.380]   - It's an interesting strategy.
[00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:36.620]   And the only problem with the plan
[00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:37.540]   of doing it into perpetuity,
[00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:39.020]   I think of myself as a lifelong learner.
[00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:41.860]   So I like the idea, oh, if I had $100,000
[00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:43.700]   of student loan debt, maybe I'll just continually
[00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:46.620]   take classes and study things that I care about.
[00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:48.860]   But the problem is you're subject to just a simple stroke
[00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:52.580]   of the pen and some rule changes and things could change.
[00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:54.780]   But at the moment, it's kind of an interesting angle.
[00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:57.140]   Well, I'm excited about the process
[00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:59.140]   of what we have planned in today's interview
[00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:00.940]   because basically what I want us to do
[00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:03.500]   is try to give away as much knowledge as you have
[00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:05.980]   as I can pump out of you.
[00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:07.900]   And we're doing this to launch your sponsorship.
[00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:09.820]   So there's always gonna be, we'll talk at the end
[00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:11.540]   about how people can work with you personally
[00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:12.700]   if that's right for them.
[00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:14.240]   But before that, I'm gonna try to get everything
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:16.740]   out of you possible.
[00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:18.660]   And the theme that I want us to focus on
[00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:22.460]   is the process of planning for what to do
[00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:23.860]   with student loans.
[00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:28.860]   So let's assume that here I am, I've graduated from college
[00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:31.260]   or it doesn't matter if I've graduated,
[00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:32.900]   I've got student loans.
[00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:34.620]   And I give you a call and I say,
[00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:37.580]   "Dear Jay, I know you're a real knowledgeable expert
[00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:39.980]   "in this area, I've got student loans.
[00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:42.560]   "What is the very first thing that I need to do
[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:45.140]   "and look at to figure out what on earth
[00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:47.780]   "I should be doing with these things?"
[00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:51.700]   - Okay, the process is, as I'm sure you can imagine,
[00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:53.980]   it's like a flight of stairs.
[00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:56.140]   There are a number of steps that are involved.
[00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:58.420]   And the first thing that you're going to do
[00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:02.740]   is you're going to pull your FSA information,
[00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:05.260]   that's Federal Student Aid, that is directly
[00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.380]   through the US Department of Education.
[00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:11.620]   You should have received a username and a PIN
[00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:14.500]   when you first applied for,
[00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:17.020]   when you first filled out your FAFSA.
[00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:20.100]   You get a student, you get a username and a PIN.
[00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:23.420]   And that's been transitioned to a username and password,
[00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:26.660]   I guess, because people are so much more used
[00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:28.660]   to having usernames and passwords online
[00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:30.420]   than just four-digit PINs.
[00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:32.540]   So what you want to do is you want to go
[00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:36.060]   to studentloans.gov, that is the US Department
[00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:37.820]   of Education's website.
[00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:41.460]   And if you don't have a username and password,
[00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:44.820]   it will walk you through the process of transitioning
[00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:47.060]   from the username and PIN system
[00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:48.540]   into the username and password.
[00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:52.100]   Once you've got that, you can log into the system.
[00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:57.100]   It is called the NSLDS system.
[00:09:57.100 --> 00:10:00.300]   And what that is is a repository
[00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:03.580]   of all of your federally guaranteed
[00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:06.060]   and federally issued student loans.
[00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:09.100]   And that's useful because what you want to do
[00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:12.660]   is you want to have a sense of which loans you have
[00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:15.780]   that are federal and which ones aren't.
[00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:18.020]   Now, all of your federal student loans
[00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:19.140]   are going to be there.
[00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:21.900]   Your federal Perkins loans, your Staffords,
[00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:25.140]   your field loans, all of that's going to be there.
[00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:28.260]   And it's going to give you a lot of information
[00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:33.100]   about the date of issuance, the original balance,
[00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:36.020]   the current balance principle, as well as interest,
[00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:37.340]   as well as the interest rate.
[00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:40.180]   And beyond that, it'll give you the information
[00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:42.740]   on who your current servicer is,
[00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:45.700]   which is important because the servicer
[00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:48.860]   is the entity that is sending you bills
[00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:53.340]   that you're sending money to or not if you're in default,
[00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:55.380]   the entity that you're sending money to,
[00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:58.420]   and the entity that you're going to deal with
[00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:01.620]   when it comes to restructuring the payments
[00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:03.660]   to the extent that you're able to do so.
[00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:06.180]   So those are your federal student loans.
[00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:11.180]   Now, this system came into effect in the '90s.
[00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:14.580]   So there are some really old loans,
[00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:19.500]   like if you've been a borrower since, say, the '70s,
[00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:22.420]   some of the really old loans may not be there
[00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:25.140]   because they were manually hand-coded.
[00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:28.180]   So if you've got a really old loan, you may be missing one,
[00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:29.460]   but for the most part,
[00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:31.380]   all the Fed loans are going to be there.
[00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:33.580]   So once you've got that access
[00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:35.340]   and once you've got that information
[00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:38.180]   that you can readily pull off of the system,
[00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:39.580]   you want to be able to take a look
[00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:42.180]   at your private student loans.
[00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:44.660]   Private student loans have nothing to do
[00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:46.580]   with the federal government.
[00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:48.540]   They're issued by private banks.
[00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:50.540]   There's a private promissory note.
[00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:55.140]   There are no federal programs involved,
[00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:57.780]   and they're treated exactly like
[00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:01.620]   any other private bank loan that you may get,
[00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:03.340]   with one notable exception,
[00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:05.500]   they were for an educational purpose.
[00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:08.580]   So in order to find out information about that,
[00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:10.420]   that gets a little bit trickier.
[00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:14.020]   You should take a look at your credit report.
[00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:15.900]   That's always going to give you
[00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:19.420]   the first step of information.
[00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:22.460]   And then if looking at that credit report
[00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:25.540]   doesn't look complete or doesn't look familiar
[00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:29.420]   or the names are off, because that will often happen,
[00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:31.780]   what you may want to do is you may want to go back
[00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:34.260]   to the school that you attended,
[00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.340]   go to the Bursar's office,
[00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:40.380]   and have them provide you with the information
[00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:43.780]   about who it is that you borrowed the money from originally,
[00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:45.700]   because they'll have the information
[00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:48.140]   because they're the ones that got the money.
[00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:53.100]   So that's going to be really your first step,
[00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:56.980]   figuring out what you've got on the table to deal with.
[00:12:56.980 --> 00:12:59.380]   What's federal, what's private.
[00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:01.300]   We got that so far?
[00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:02.140]   We good?
[00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:03.540]   - Why is this distinction between federal
[00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:05.380]   and private so important?
[00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:07.820]   - Okay, because federal student loans
[00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:11.020]   come with a number of repayment options,
[00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:14.540]   and they also come with a number of options
[00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:17.860]   with respect to getting yourself out of default.
[00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:20.820]   And when you've got those options,
[00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:23.260]   for example, repayment options,
[00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:28.260]   there are now nine, I think.
[00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.460]   Okay, I'm going to count them down
[00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:33.460]   because I know them better just by rattling them off.
[00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:35.380]   There is a standard repayment agreement,
[00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:38.060]   which is a 10-year repayment option,
[00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:40.980]   pay the exact same amount every month.
[00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:44.340]   You've got a graduated payment option,
[00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:46.820]   which is the payments start low,
[00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:49.060]   and then every two years they bump up,
[00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:51.300]   again, like another flight of stairs.
[00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:53.820]   There's an extended payment option
[00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:56.580]   that will take you out to, depending on your loan,
[00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:58.780]   either 25 or 30 years.
[00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:01.780]   Flat repayment, same payment every month.
[00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:05.820]   There is graduated extended, which is just like graduated,
[00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:07.900]   starts low, goes up every two years,
[00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:10.220]   but for the fact that it goes up every two years
[00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:12.940]   for the extended period of time.
[00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:15.980]   Then you've got your income-based options.
[00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:18.100]   You've got income-based repayment,
[00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:22.860]   which allows you to repay 15% of your disposable income
[00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:25.700]   every year for a period of 25 years.
[00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:26.540]   At the end of that,
[00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:30.300]   there is a discharge of the unpaid balance.
[00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:32.580]   There's income contingent repayment,
[00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:35.180]   which is kind of like income-based repayment,
[00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:38.060]   but it's for primarily, at this point,
[00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:39.020]   parent plus loans,
[00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:41.620]   which don't qualify for income-based repayment.
[00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:44.000]   There's pay as you earn,
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.820]   which caps payments at 10% of adjusted gross income
[00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:51.620]   for 20 years for new borrowers only.
[00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:53.860]   There's new income-based repayment.
[00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:55.060]   Does your head hurt yet?
[00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:56.780]   - I'm at nine.
[00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:58.060]   (laughing)
[00:14:58.060 --> 00:14:59.300]   Okay, keep going.
[00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:01.820]   - There's new income-based repayment,
[00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:04.320]   which is just like pay as you earn,
[00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:09.320]   but it is 10% for 20 years for only newer direct loans.
[00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:16.580]   And now, coming in December 2015,
[00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:18.340]   depending upon when you're listening to this,
[00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:19.860]   it may already be in effect,
[00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:22.740]   there is revised pay as you earn,
[00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:25.260]   which expands pay as you earn
[00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:29.140]   to every single direct loan borrower,
[00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:30.420]   which is great,
[00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:34.440]   caps it at 10% of your disposable income,
[00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:37.100]   which is great if you don't make a lot of money,
[00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:42.100]   because revised pay as you earn does not cap your payments.
[00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:46.560]   Under income-based repayment,
[00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:49.080]   under income contingent repayment,
[00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:52.160]   under the original pay as you earn,
[00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:56.060]   and under new income-based repayment, new IBR,
[00:15:56.060 --> 00:16:00.180]   your payments are capped at the amount that would be due
[00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:03.420]   under a 10-year standard repayment plan.
[00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:07.500]   Under revised pay as you earn, there is no cap.
[00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:11.740]   So if you make $2 million a year,
[00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:16.740]   your payment is 10% of $2 million a year.
[00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:20.360]   Whereas under income-based repayment,
[00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:23.460]   and under the old pay as you earn system,
[00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:27.900]   your payments are capped at whatever the payment would be
[00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:29.940]   for a 10-year repayment cycle.
[00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:30.780]   - Interesting.
[00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:32.340]   - There are some other nuances as well.
[00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:34.880]   For example, under income-based repayment,
[00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:38.440]   if you are married but file taxes separately,
[00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:43.320]   your payments are only based upon your disposable income
[00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:45.160]   and your family size.
[00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:48.820]   So let's say it's you and, Joshua,
[00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:50.120]   let's say it's you and your wife,
[00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:52.780]   and let's say you've got five kids.
[00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:55.140]   You and your wife file taxes separately.
[00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:56.400]   You don't make a lot of money.
[00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:57.940]   She makes a ton of money.
[00:16:57.940 --> 00:16:59.980]   You file taxes separately.
[00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:02.660]   Income-based repayment is going to,
[00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:06.820]   your monthly payment is going to be based upon your income,
[00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:08.780]   your disposable income only.
[00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:12.980]   However, it's going to be based upon a family size of seven,
[00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:15.140]   you, your wife, and your five kids.
[00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:18.380]   In spite of the fact that your wife is filing separately,
[00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:20.820]   and you may even be loading all five kids
[00:17:20.820 --> 00:17:25.380]   onto her tax return for the purposes of deductibility,
[00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:27.820]   under revised pay-as-you-earn,
[00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:29.940]   we look at yours and hers,
[00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:32.540]   whether you file together or not,
[00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:35.340]   and we use the family size of seven.
[00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:37.760]   So under revised pay-as-you-earn,
[00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:40.900]   you pay more money if you're married,
[00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:43.300]   if your spouse makes a lot of money,
[00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:46.300]   or if you get into revised pay-as-you-earn,
[00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:48.380]   and then you don't change your repayment,
[00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:50.620]   and then you start making a lot of money.
[00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:52.860]   So it's a lot more complicated.
[00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:53.900]   How many did we get?
[00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:54.940]   Did we get nine? - We got 10, 10.
[00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:55.780]   - We got 10. - Yeah.
[00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:56.600]   - All right, great.
[00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:59.140]   So there are 10 repayment options for federals.
[00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:05.580]   There is consolidation options for federals.
[00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:09.180]   You can consolidate your federal student loans
[00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:11.300]   under the U.S. Department of Education's
[00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:13.420]   Direct Loan Program.
[00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:15.180]   You can also refinance privately.
[00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:16.580]   That's absolutely fine.
[00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:18.480]   There are a number of great ways to do that.
[00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:23.160]   But if you consolidate under the Direct Loan Program,
[00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:26.240]   you retain the ability to utilize
[00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:27.960]   all of these repayment options.
[00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:30.540]   If you refinance through a private bank,
[00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:33.840]   even though it may be better rates, better terms,
[00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:35.760]   you're not going to have the availability
[00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:37.500]   of those repayment options.
[00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:39.520]   Also, if you go into default,
[00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:42.520]   there are ways to get out of default of your federal loans.
[00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:45.900]   There's rehabilitation, making nine monthly payments
[00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:47.840]   over a 10-month period of time
[00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:50.960]   based upon what's called a reasonable
[00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:54.440]   and affordable formula, which is the same as IBR,
[00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:57.240]   which is 15% of your disposable income.
[00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:59.920]   You can also rehabilitate.
[00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:02.800]   So you can rehabilitate your way out of default.
[00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:05.680]   You can also consolidate your way out of default.
[00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:08.280]   That's federal student loans only.
[00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:13.280]   None of those programs, and I do mean none of those programs,
[00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:18.600]   exist for private student loans, none of them.
[00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:19.800]   - Is there a way for a borrower
[00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:23.000]   who has private student loans outstanding
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.820]   to transition any of that debt over to federal student loans?
[00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:28.360]   - No, I wish that there were.
[00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:31.280]   There are a number of,
[00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:33.960]   there's always rumblings in Congress,
[00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:38.960]   but there are invariably bills getting put down
[00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:43.020]   in front of Congress to try to get that to happen.
[00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:46.720]   But I don't see that as being in the cards,
[00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:48.600]   'cause then what you're really talking about
[00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:52.400]   is you're talking about the federal government
[00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:55.200]   taking the burden off of the private banks.
[00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:59.000]   And that's, talk about a bailout, that would be enormous.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.600]   It would be a great win for borrowers,
[00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:03.840]   but I think that we would probably see
[00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:05.680]   a taxpayer revolt if that happened.
[00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:10.240]   - So you've printed off the reports,
[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:12.120]   you've gotten details on the loans.
[00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:15.240]   Back to our steps of the process of planning.
[00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:16.080]   Now what?
[00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:19.680]   - Now we're gonna focus solely on the private loans,
[00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:21.700]   just for a minute.
[00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:23.140]   The first thing that you wanna do
[00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:24.900]   with respect to the private loans,
[00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:27.400]   you wanna get copies of the promissory notes
[00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:29.720]   that you originally signed,
[00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:32.360]   because you wanna know what it is that you're up against.
[00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:37.260]   You wanna understand what the terms of those notes are.
[00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:39.840]   You want to determine whether or not
[00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:42.600]   you've got a guarantor on the loan.
[00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:44.440]   'Cause if you've got a guarantor on the loan
[00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:48.960]   and you fall behind, not only do you take a credit hit,
[00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:52.240]   and not only are you subject to collection activities,
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:53.880]   but so is the guarantor.
[00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:56.040]   Most people think that if they've got a guarantor
[00:20:56.040 --> 00:21:01.040]   or a cosigner on a loan, that's just a signature.
[00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:03.280]   But it's not.
[00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:06.360]   A guarantor or a cosigner on a loan
[00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:10.660]   means that you, as well as that other person,
[00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:15.660]   are both 100% legally liable for repayment of that debt.
[00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:21.680]   And if you go past due, you're gonna get phone calls,
[00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:23.120]   they're gonna get phone calls.
[00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:26.600]   If you get sued, you're going to have to defend the case,
[00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:28.440]   they're going to have to defend the case.
[00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:30.280]   You can have a judgment against you,
[00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:32.200]   they can have a judgment against them.
[00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:36.880]   And especially if that guarantor has assets,
[00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:41.040]   has a house, has a bank account, has investments,
[00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:44.600]   that may be subject to enforcement, to execution.
[00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:48.400]   They could take it, depending upon what your state law says
[00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:49.960]   about enforcement of judgments.
[00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:54.840]   So you want to be able to have a sense of who else,
[00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:56.540]   who else is gonna be impacted
[00:21:56.540 --> 00:21:59.320]   by whatever decision you come to.
[00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:01.480]   And you want to be able to have a conversation
[00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:04.200]   with that person to let them know.
[00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:08.640]   Because very often, a parent or a grandparent who's cosigned,
[00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:10.280]   they figure they're out of it.
[00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:11.120]   They signed.
[00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:13.980]   What a lot of people think is,
[00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:18.920]   I signed for the loan so that they would see
[00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:20.240]   that my credit was good.
[00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:25.240]   My credit got the loan, but that's where my involvement ends.
[00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:27.240]   And that's just not the case.
[00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:32.240]   So you want to know who else is gonna be involved here.
[00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:35.880]   So that's the first thing.
[00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:38.400]   The second thing is you want to be able to take a look
[00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:40.260]   at what the terms of the note are.
[00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:42.580]   Do you have a fixed rate?
[00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:44.660]   Do you have a variable rate?
[00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:46.440]   When does that rate adjust?
[00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:47.660]   How does it adjust?
[00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:49.160]   What's the mechanism?
[00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:53.240]   What sort of notification do they have to provide to you?
[00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:56.200]   That promissory note is also going to give you
[00:22:56.200 --> 00:23:01.200]   an indication of what you may be able to do
[00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:03.280]   if you've got a guarantor,
[00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:05.440]   what you may be able to do to get that guarantor
[00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:06.880]   off of the loan.
[00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:10.080]   A lot of promissory notes, what I've seen is
[00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:14.840]   there's an indication that you can get the guarantor off.
[00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:19.840]   But if you have been late at any time on that loan
[00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:23.600]   within the first 24 months of repayment,
[00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:27.080]   a lender will automatically not entertain
[00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:28.680]   a guarantor release.
[00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:30.200]   It doesn't matter what you do.
[00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:33.260]   It doesn't matter how long you've been good with them.
[00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:34.880]   It doesn't matter.
[00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:36.000]   Nothing matters.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.320]   If you were late within the first 24 months, you're out.
[00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:43.520]   And late does not just mean my payment was due
[00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:45.200]   and I didn't make the payment.
[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:49.640]   It means also to some lenders, my payment was due
[00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:52.380]   and I called them up and asked them to put me on
[00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:56.320]   an interest only plan or to give me another forbearance.
[00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:59.560]   So a lot of borrowers step into that
[00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:03.520]   without even realizing that they're stepping into it.
[00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:06.960]   Another big thing is if you've got a guarantor,
[00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:10.600]   especially a lot of these loans
[00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:15.080]   will go into automatic default
[00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:20.080]   if either you or the guarantor dies,
[00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:22.620]   files for bankruptcy.
[00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:24.180]   Those are the two big things.
[00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:28.060]   So if you're a borrower and you're making your payments
[00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:32.260]   on a regular basis and let's say your grandma
[00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:35.420]   co-signed for you, grandma dies,
[00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:37.940]   that loan goes into default automatically.
[00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:41.620]   - That seems a little bit, is that a loop?
[00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:43.680]   That doesn't make any sense.
[00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:47.440]   Is there a logical reason why that should be the case?
[00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:51.360]   - (sighs) Banks.
[00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:53.360]   (laughing)
[00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:55.080]   - One sigh can tell the whole story.
[00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:56.220]   Okay, moving on.
[00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:57.060]   (laughing)
[00:24:57.060 --> 00:24:57.900]   - Exactly.
[00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:01.920]   No, I think the real reason is
[00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:05.640]   in the case of one of the borrowers dying,
[00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:10.640]   the loan becomes a debt of the estate.
[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:13.400]   So if grandma dies--
[00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:14.880]   - They wanna make a claim on the estate.
[00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:16.720]   - Yeah, they have to make a claim on the estate.
[00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:18.000]   They don't know how much they're gonna get
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.320]   and that's the same thing in a bankruptcy context as well.
[00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:24.040]   So you wanna know what it is that
[00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:27.900]   you're potentially gonna be up against there.
[00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:30.800]   There are a number of other things
[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:32.200]   that you wanna take a look at.
[00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:35.680]   You wanna find out what sort of notice requirements
[00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:36.520]   there are.
[00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:40.320]   There's one really neat thing that I have found
[00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:43.500]   in a lot of private student loan promissory notes
[00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:46.500]   that I never hear spoken about.
[00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:51.540]   The student loan, and this goes to the ability
[00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:55.060]   of the private student loan company to sue you.
[00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:57.540]   There is something called a statute of limitations,
[00:25:57.540 --> 00:26:02.220]   a time period within which the lender
[00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:05.140]   has to file legal action against you.
[00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:07.900]   And that is always going to be state-based.
[00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:09.940]   So it depends upon where you are
[00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:11.580]   and what your state law is.
[00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:15.880]   But in most places, it begins to run
[00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:19.260]   from the date that you fail to make a payment.
[00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:22.820]   So the day that your payment goes past you.
[00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:25.820]   A lot of times, and I don't know if you know anybody
[00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:28.020]   who's got student loans who has tried to go
[00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:30.660]   into a forbearance with their lender.
[00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:32.420]   Most of the time, they'll call the lender
[00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:34.420]   and they'll say, "Hey, can you give me
[00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:35.300]   "a little bit of time?"
[00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:36.680]   Lender says, "Yeah, no problem.
[00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:38.160]   "We'll give you another three months
[00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:39.780]   "or six months or a year," or whatever it is.
[00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:42.500]   Or, "We're gonna change the terms."
[00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:44.820]   That's always done by phone.
[00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:48.440]   That's never done by writing.
[00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:50.400]   Maybe the lender will send you out a letter,
[00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:52.480]   but there's never anything in writing.
[00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:53.720]   You never sign anything.
[00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:57.400]   They don't co-sign it to change the terms of the agreement.
[00:26:57.400 --> 00:27:00.860]   In so many of these private student loan promissory notes,
[00:27:00.860 --> 00:27:02.900]   there is a clause that says,
[00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:07.380]   "If the loan terms change at all,
[00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:09.800]   "it's gotta be done in writing."
[00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:13.040]   And there are some state laws that require that as well.
[00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:17.840]   And that could make a big difference to somebody
[00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:20.400]   who went into deferment for a year
[00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:24.420]   and then didn't make payments for another five years,
[00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:27.360]   and there's a six-year statute of limitations.
[00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:30.660]   Then becomes, when did it start running?
[00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:32.140]   Well, there was never any alteration
[00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:35.220]   of the terms of the contract in writing,
[00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:38.860]   and therefore, it would start when the payment was missed,
[00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:40.940]   not when that new forbearance ended.
[00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:43.900]   And that's an argument that you just wanna be able to know
[00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:48.280]   because you want to know how long they have
[00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:52.640]   to file a lawsuit against you if it comes to that.
[00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:57.300]   So that's what you wanna look at on the private student loans.
[00:27:57.300 --> 00:27:59.220]   On the federal student loans,
[00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:02.820]   your second step is you wanna take a look
[00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:05.460]   at what your current income is
[00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:10.460]   because your income enables you to look at
[00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:14.740]   all of the repayment options that may be available to you.
[00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:19.420]   Your income is going to be what's going to qualify you
[00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:24.060]   for income-based repayment or the original pays you earn
[00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:29.180]   because in order to qualify to get into those programs,
[00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:32.680]   not to stay in those programs, to get into those programs,
[00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:37.680]   you must have an income that is insufficient
[00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:42.580]   to cover your 10-year repayment amount.
[00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:46.380]   So you've gotta be able to see what your income is
[00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:48.620]   to be able to determine whether or not
[00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:51.500]   you may have the ability to get into one
[00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:54.360]   of those federal student loan repayment programs.
[00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:56.100]   - Okay.
[00:28:56.100 --> 00:29:00.380]   - I think that's where we are.
[00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:06.420]   And what I'm talking about is not if you are in default.
[00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:09.300]   Not if you are in default.
[00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:13.460]   It's I'm in repayment and here's where I am.
[00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:17.180]   But jumping off on the income option,
[00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:21.640]   your next step is if you're married,
[00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:24.980]   you wanna sit down with your tax professional
[00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:28.860]   and you want to determine what the tax difference
[00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:32.180]   is going to be based upon a variety of factors.
[00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:35.020]   If we file jointly, how much do we get back
[00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:36.980]   or how much do we owe at the end of the year?
[00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:41.380]   If we file separately and let's say my spouse
[00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:46.100]   gets the kids' deductions, I get the mortgage deduction
[00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:48.620]   if we're homeowners or vice versa,
[00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:50.860]   or my spouse gets everything and I get nothing
[00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:54.560]   or vice versa, how does that impact the amount of money
[00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:56.580]   that we're gonna have to pay at the end of the year
[00:29:56.580 --> 00:29:58.220]   or the amount of money that we get back
[00:29:58.220 --> 00:29:59.060]   at the end of the year?
[00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:03.500]   Because then you get to look at what your federal
[00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:06.500]   student loan repayment options are going to be
[00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:11.060]   in relation to the difference in the tax hit.
[00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:14.540]   Because if you're saving 200 bucks a month
[00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:17.540]   on your federal student loan repayment,
[00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:21.360]   but you're going to have to pay another,
[00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:25.460]   on average of $400 a month to cover your tax nut
[00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:29.060]   at the end of the year, well, it doesn't make sense, right?
[00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:30.100]   - Right, right.
[00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:35.100]   - Right, and vice versa is true as well.
[00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:38.900]   So you want to be able to determine which way
[00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:42.700]   is going to be financially better for me
[00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:45.340]   depending upon what my repayment option's
[00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:46.980]   gonna be on the feds.
[00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:51.700]   From there, see, this is multiple steps.
[00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:57.140]   From there, what you want to do is look at
[00:30:57.140 --> 00:30:59.660]   what your employment options are.
[00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:04.660]   This is really important because depending upon
[00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:09.140]   your employment situation, you may have options
[00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:12.100]   for federal student loan forgiveness.
[00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:14.500]   The big one is public service loan forgiveness.
[00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:17.300]   That's the one that everybody talks about.
[00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:22.300]   If you are employed full-time by federal, state,
[00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:28.020]   municipal government, or 501(c)(3) not-for-profit
[00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:33.660]   organizations, and you are a direct loan borrower,
[00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:40.380]   and you are on an income-dependent repayment option,
[00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:43.820]   that's IBR, ICR, pay-as-you-earn,
[00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:46.900]   or now revised pay-as-you-earn,
[00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:51.900]   after having made 120 on-time monthly payments
[00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:55.200]   while full-time employed with one of those employers,
[00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:59.360]   the unpaid balance is not just discharged,
[00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:02.120]   but is forgiven, and there's a big difference there.
[00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:06.560]   Forgiveness does not come with a tax bill.
[00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:12.720]   Discharge comes with a 1099 forgiveness of debt statement
[00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:18.560]   at the end of the year and may subject you to income taxes.
[00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:22.080]   - Yeah, that is the one that angers people
[00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:25.360]   more than anything else.
[00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:29.540]   What was the word you said?
[00:32:29.540 --> 00:32:30.720]   Not forgiven, but discharged.
[00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:32.160]   When the debt is discharged,
[00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:33.880]   the amount of the debt that's discharged,
[00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:35.240]   let's say you've negotiated with the creditor
[00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:37.360]   and they've discharged $50,000 of debt,
[00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:40.440]   at the end of the year, you're gonna get a 1099
[00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:43.480]   for $50,000 of income, and that, my friends,
[00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:45.820]   is what we call the lovely phantom income,
[00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:47.840]   income on which you owe taxes,
[00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:49.440]   but you have not received any money,
[00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:52.040]   and that can really put a hurting on you at tax time.
[00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:54.280]   So the fact that it is forgiven,
[00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:56.360]   not discharged, is a big deal.
[00:32:56.360 --> 00:33:00.320]   - Exactly, and when it comes to IBR,
[00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:01.800]   when it comes to income-based repayment
[00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:03.520]   and the original pay as you earn,
[00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:07.800]   you could theoretically, and in most cases,
[00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:10.440]   you're negatively amortizing your loan.
[00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:13.880]   Your payment isn't covering your interest.
[00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:16.480]   And so what happens is,
[00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:19.560]   over the 20 or 25-year period of time,
[00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:24.560]   your loan, it's like a snowball, but a bad snowball.
[00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:26.240]   It's an avalanche.
[00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:29.960]   You go from your $80,000 student loan
[00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:32.560]   and you think you're in great shape
[00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:35.200]   because you're paying 20 bucks a month on them.
[00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:38.440]   Well, by the end of the 20 or 25 years,
[00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:42.640]   your 80 grand is gonna be like two and change more.
[00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:44.880]   You're gonna owe a lot of money,
[00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:47.800]   and all of that's gonna get forgiven,
[00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:50.840]   and then in the mail, you're gonna get that 1099.
[00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:53.160]   Now, revised pay as you earn
[00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:54.840]   is a little bit different than that
[00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:58.040]   because 50% of the interest that accrues
[00:33:58.040 --> 00:34:00.640]   is automatically taken off the table,
[00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:02.600]   so you're not gonna negatively amortize
[00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:05.680]   in quite the same fashion or to quite the same extent.
[00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:08.360]   But again, you've gotta play with those numbers.
[00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:12.400]   And a lot of people have said,
[00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:16.720]   well, that's a disincentive to getting married.
[00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:17.720]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:21.080]   - And I'm not sure that I disagree with that.
[00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:26.080]   I think that when it's IBR or it's the old pay as you earn,
[00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:30.280]   you say, well, we'll just file separately and that's fine,
[00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:32.360]   and what's mine is mine and what's yours is yours,
[00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:33.200]   and that doesn't matter
[00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:35.320]   whether it's a community property state
[00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:39.000]   or what's called an equitable distribution state.
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.560]   It's always what's yours is yours and what's mine is mine
[00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:43.880]   because you're filing taxes separately.
[00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:46.960]   If you're opting for revised pay as you earn,
[00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:48.400]   then you really have to,
[00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:50.080]   you've gotta think hard about this.
[00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:51.400]   - Right.
[00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:54.920]   - So that's your next step.
[00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:57.800]   There's public service loan forgiveness.
[00:34:57.800 --> 00:35:01.600]   There are certain federal agencies
[00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:03.440]   that have loan repayment options
[00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:05.320]   and loan forgiveness options.
[00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:09.080]   There's Veteran Affairs, there's Department of Defense,
[00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:12.400]   there's Department of Justice, there's Immigration.
[00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:16.280]   All of these agencies have certain loan repayment
[00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:19.200]   and loan forgiveness plans in place
[00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:23.080]   that you wanna look at your options
[00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:25.760]   because if you're well-educated,
[00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:29.880]   if you've got a diverse range of skills,
[00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:34.880]   you may elect to go into one of these employment situations
[00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:37.800]   that's going to get you out of the loan.
[00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:39.200]   And by the way,
[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:41.800]   with respect to public service loan forgiveness,
[00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:45.600]   it is employer-based, not job-based.
[00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:49.280]   So most hospitals, for example,
[00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:52.240]   are 501(c)(3) not-for-profits.
[00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:55.520]   So public service loan forgiveness
[00:35:55.520 --> 00:36:00.520]   would work for everybody from the overnight janitor
[00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:08.120]   all the way up to the chief of neurosurgery in the hospital.
[00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:14.680]   Everybody who's employed by that 501(c)(3)
[00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:17.720]   is going to be able to benefit potentially
[00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:19.840]   from public service loan forgiveness.
[00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:21.760]   - And if you don't work for a 501(c)(3),
[00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:23.160]   you can always sign up
[00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:25.360]   and start working at the Bunny Ranch, right?
[00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:28.080]   With your recent podcast interview.
[00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:29.600]   (laughing)
[00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:31.840]   I listened to your interview with the guy who,
[00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:35.520]   that was the name of his show,
[00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:38.240]   the guy who owns all the brothels in Nevada, Bunny Ranch,
[00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:42.040]   and now he does matching dollars for all of his employees,
[00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:43.840]   all the prostitutes who work for him,
[00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:45.160]   he does matching dollars for them
[00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:46.280]   towards their student loans.
[00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:48.800]   So there's always that as a backup plan, right?
[00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:50.800]   - Exactly, exactly.
[00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:53.240]   - Just trying to throw you off your game here.
[00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:54.760]   - That was a crazy show.
[00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:57.640]   And you listened to his show.
[00:36:57.640 --> 00:37:00.440]   He was hysterical. - He was.
[00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:04.680]   - But beyond that, he really understands this stuff.
[00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:09.800]   Agree or disagree with his business itself,
[00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:12.840]   he's got a really good understanding
[00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:15.520]   of what it is that people are up against
[00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:18.240]   and exactly how the system operates.
[00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:19.760]   And that was the part that blew my mind.
[00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:23.920]   I mean, look, I know that there are other reasons
[00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:26.480]   why an employer would want to do that.
[00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:32.720]   The press was amazing for him, but just beyond that,
[00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:35.200]   the guy really understood this stuff.
[00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:36.040]   It blew my mind.
[00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:37.240]   - Yeah.
[00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:38.320]   Sorry to throw you off your game.
[00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:39.160]   I couldn't resist, though,
[00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:42.160]   after listening to that interview that you did.
[00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:43.440]   It was a fascinating thing.
[00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:45.600]   You take one of the world's oldest professions,
[00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:48.880]   prostitutions, and you mix in some of the newest
[00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:52.440]   and weirdest laws and economic financial realities,
[00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:54.560]   and you have an interesting business
[00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:56.160]   that that man is running.
[00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:58.200]   - No kidding. - Interesting.
[00:37:58.200 --> 00:38:02.120]   On the 501(c)(3), I think to emphasize on a serious note,
[00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:03.680]   to emphasize what you just said,
[00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:08.200]   that it's employer-based, not job-based, that is huge.
[00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:11.920]   Because I think that many listeners could,
[00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:15.960]   if only that little bit of information were to be the case,
[00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:19.320]   that could make a world of difference.
[00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:22.440]   Because if you take a skill set that you have
[00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:24.400]   and a financial situation that you have,
[00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:25.920]   and you go out on the marketplace,
[00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:30.360]   the 501(c)(3) nonprofit organizations have to compete
[00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:36.520]   with for-profit corporations for employees.
[00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:40.320]   So many times, they might have competitive wages.
[00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:42.960]   They might have different perk benefits,
[00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:46.120]   things that in some ways are even better than for-profits.
[00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:48.320]   And if you have substantial student loan debt,
[00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:51.640]   and if you can get involved in one of these repayment plans
[00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:55.080]   that will serve you more than paying off the debt,
[00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:55.960]   that can be huge.
[00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:57.800]   And here'd be the example,
[00:38:57.800 --> 00:38:59.800]   two things that I'll give and let you comment on them.
[00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:02.720]   Number one, a number of years ago,
[00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:05.800]   I was involved in a philanthropy course
[00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:09.160]   for a designation called a CAP designation,
[00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:10.880]   Chartered Advisor in Philanthropy.
[00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:13.440]   And as I went through these courses,
[00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:14.840]   I did it in a local study group.
[00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:16.240]   And one of the things that blew my mind
[00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:20.240]   is I had been one in the past who would share these memes
[00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:24.520]   about, well, the CEO Goodwill makes $767,000 a year,
[00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:26.840]   so therefore you shouldn't take your money to Goodwill,
[00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:30.720]   or you shouldn't support the breast cancer organization
[00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:33.560]   because the CEO makes $2 million a year.
[00:39:33.560 --> 00:39:36.200]   And I still like some of those arguments.
[00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:38.360]   I don't wanna support some of those other organizations,
[00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:42.440]   but I no longer necessarily disqualify
[00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:46.960]   a non-profit organization simply because the CEO
[00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:49.160]   makes a million or $2 million a year.
[00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:51.960]   And I realized that if I were on the board of the directors,
[00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:55.560]   it's not a matter of a simple six-figure number.
[00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:58.600]   The question is, is this CEO effectively advancing
[00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:01.360]   the causes of our organization?
[00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:03.840]   And that's the point that an organization
[00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:06.740]   like the Susan G. Komen Foundation
[00:40:06.740 --> 00:40:08.480]   or the American Heart Association,
[00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:12.120]   this is a massive company, and so they need in some ways
[00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:16.640]   to attract a high-level, extremely skillful CEO.
[00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:19.480]   And money is going to be one part of that.
[00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:21.520]   And I realized that that can be filtered down
[00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:22.360]   at other levels.
[00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:25.680]   If you are, for example, a talented salesperson,
[00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:29.440]   you can put your talents to use in selling life insurance
[00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:30.880]   for a life insurance company.
[00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:32.520]   And you can also put your talents to use
[00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:35.760]   as a development officer at a local non-profit organization
[00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:36.720]   that you care for.
[00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:39.040]   And depending on how your compensation is structured,
[00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:41.440]   you can do quite well for yourself honing
[00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:45.260]   and developing those sales skills at either organization.
[00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:47.680]   And when you factor in the impact that you can make
[00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:52.680]   on your student loans, that idea alone can really serve,
[00:40:55.560 --> 00:40:58.240]   I would say, a good number of people in my audience.
[00:40:58.240 --> 00:40:59.880]   - Yeah, I agree completely.
[00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:04.880]   I think that when you understand that it is employer-based,
[00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:09.720]   it cracks open your universe in so many different ways
[00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:14.640]   because you're still looking at your financial reasons
[00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:17.080]   for taking a job, but your financial reasons
[00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:22.080]   become larger than just what your immediate paycheck is.
[00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:24.760]   And that's really what, that's what public service
[00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:26.080]   loan forgiveness is all about.
[00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:31.080]   It was designed to make it more attractive
[00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:34.560]   for somebody to do good, to do good work.
[00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:35.880]   I mean, look at it this way.
[00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:40.880]   And this actually happened to me, I don't know,
[00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:41.880]   two, three months ago.
[00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:46.640]   I was on the phone with somebody who is a neurosurgeon,
[00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:49.500]   and that's why I now say the chief of neurosurgery.
[00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:53.700]   Neurosurgeon coming out of residency
[00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:55.720]   at a county hospital.
[00:41:55.720 --> 00:41:58.360]   And they said to me, "Okay, well, I don't make
[00:41:58.360 --> 00:41:59.480]   "a lot of money now.
[00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:02.000]   "I've got all of these federal student loans,
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:05.600]   "but I don't think income-based repayment's gonna work
[00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:07.920]   "for me because next year I'm gonna be done
[00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:11.540]   "with my residency, and I'm gonna look
[00:42:11.540 --> 00:42:13.400]   "to go into private practice."
[00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:15.920]   I said, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
[00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:18.520]   "that's probably not your best idea."
[00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:22.440]   They said, "Well, but I'm gonna go from like $70,000
[00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:24.700]   "to 200 and some odd."
[00:42:24.700 --> 00:42:26.620]   It was some ridiculous amount of money
[00:42:26.620 --> 00:42:28.220]   that they were gonna jump.
[00:42:28.220 --> 00:42:33.220]   I said, "Well, wait a minute, you've been in this residency
[00:42:33.220 --> 00:42:35.240]   "for I think it was seven years."
[00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:39.000]   I said, "If you stay three more years,
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:41.660]   "you'll qualify for public service loan forgiveness.
[00:42:41.660 --> 00:42:43.600]   "You're not gonna make as much money
[00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:45.140]   "for the last three years of being there,
[00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:48.780]   "but you'll qualify for public service loan forgiveness."
[00:42:48.780 --> 00:42:52.880]   And I ended my part of the conversation at that point.
[00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:55.960]   And the woman said to me, "Really?
[00:42:55.960 --> 00:42:59.100]   "Well, that's great because I would love
[00:42:59.100 --> 00:43:02.860]   "to be able to stay here because there's a shortage
[00:43:02.860 --> 00:43:06.600]   "of good people outside of the teaching level
[00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:10.000]   "who are actually doing this on a day-to-day basis
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:12.600]   "for patients, and I could do a world of good."
[00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:14.760]   And the only reason why I was gonna leave
[00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:17.580]   in the first place was because of the student loans,
[00:43:17.580 --> 00:43:19.940]   but now that I know that I don't have to leave
[00:43:19.940 --> 00:43:22.100]   because of the student loans,
[00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:24.740]   I can do the things that I want to do,
[00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:27.420]   and I thought that was really telling.
[00:43:27.420 --> 00:43:30.300]   - It is, and this is the core of even just
[00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:32.700]   the whole approach of radical personal finance
[00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:36.580]   is use everything at your disposal
[00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:38.560]   to create the ideal lifestyle.
[00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:41.220]   And an extra $100,000 of income
[00:43:41.220 --> 00:43:44.740]   is not always a good thing if it impedes your lifestyle.
[00:43:44.740 --> 00:43:47.620]   Now, if you can create lifestyle in such a way
[00:43:47.620 --> 00:43:49.560]   that it's gonna be exactly what you're looking for
[00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:52.540]   and you can make an extra $100,000 of income, go for it.
[00:43:52.540 --> 00:43:53.740]   But when you start looking at this,
[00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:55.260]   you can put together a package,
[00:43:55.260 --> 00:43:57.820]   whether it's working in a lower-stress environment.
[00:43:57.820 --> 00:44:01.240]   I mean, face it, schools, non-profit environments,
[00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:04.300]   they are lower-stress, more fun,
[00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:06.740]   and easier, government organizations,
[00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:09.700]   easier places to work than for-profit enterprises.
[00:44:09.700 --> 00:44:11.560]   There is, in the aggregate,
[00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:12.780]   there are individual exceptions,
[00:44:12.780 --> 00:44:14.700]   but in the aggregate, they're easier places to work.
[00:44:14.700 --> 00:44:16.740]   There's not as much pressure to the bottom line.
[00:44:16.740 --> 00:44:18.700]   There's not as much pressure on the employees.
[00:44:18.700 --> 00:44:22.620]   And so for some people who aren't highly competitive,
[00:44:22.620 --> 00:44:25.000]   who wanna just simply kinda do what they need to do
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   to fulfill the requirements of their job and continue on,
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.140]   this is gonna create a much better lifestyle
[00:44:29.140 --> 00:44:32.240]   than going into a highly competitive market
[00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:34.460]   where you gotta work, work, work to earn the extra money,
[00:44:34.460 --> 00:44:36.820]   and now you turn around and send half of it to the taxman
[00:44:36.820 --> 00:44:38.580]   and half of it to the student loan company.
[00:44:38.580 --> 00:44:42.040]   So look at employment in terms of a comprehensive package
[00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:47.040]   and look at it in the context of all of the benefits
[00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:52.200]   across the board, and this is a big, big deal.
[00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:55.200]   Let's continue on with the checklist here
[00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:59.620]   that we're laying out for people,
[00:44:59.620 --> 00:45:01.820]   'cause I wanna wrap up this checklist
[00:45:01.820 --> 00:45:02.780]   in about five or 10 minutes,
[00:45:02.780 --> 00:45:06.280]   and then spend the last 10 or 15 minutes of the interview
[00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:09.040]   talking about services and approaches.
[00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:12.940]   After this, what's next if somebody
[00:45:12.940 --> 00:45:14.240]   wants to do it themselves?
[00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:17.960]   - Next thing that you wanna look to is,
[00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:20.120]   we're gonna go back to the private student loans,
[00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:22.560]   because the private student loans tend to be
[00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:25.400]   a lot more difficult for people to get a handle on.
[00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:28.880]   Your private student loans, if you can get your cosigner
[00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:30.400]   or guarantor off the note,
[00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:32.920]   then you wanna be able to set yourself up to do that.
[00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:36.260]   And in large measure, that's going to involve your credit,
[00:45:36.260 --> 00:45:38.820]   it's going to involve your income,
[00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:40.720]   and you wanna know what it is
[00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:41.580]   that you're gonna need to do.
[00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:44.380]   So you wanna talk to your servicer about that.
[00:45:44.380 --> 00:45:46.520]   You may wanna look at refinancing,
[00:45:46.520 --> 00:45:50.120]   depending upon what kind of terms that you can get.
[00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:52.320]   There are a number of companies out there that do it,
[00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:55.120]   so you may wanna look to see if there's a way
[00:45:55.120 --> 00:45:57.040]   to restructure your private student loans
[00:45:57.040 --> 00:46:00.040]   by refinancing through a private bank.
[00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:03.000]   Beyond that, if you are in default
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.480]   or in danger of going into default,
[00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:08.420]   call your servicer, ask them what they've got available.
[00:46:08.420 --> 00:46:10.920]   Sometimes they may have something,
[00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:12.080]   most of the times they don't.
[00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:16.960]   But you really wanna know what your options are.
[00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:19.720]   Once you go into default, and this is,
[00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:21.440]   I know you wanna wrap it up,
[00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:24.000]   but I gotta go on like a five minute rant here.
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:24.980]   - Go for it, go for it.
[00:46:24.980 --> 00:46:27.180]   - Okay, there are all of these companies
[00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:29.160]   that are coming out saying,
[00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:31.560]   "We can settle your private student loans
[00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:35.400]   "for 50 cents on the dollar, including our fees,
[00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:38.680]   "and all of the private student loans are fraudulent,
[00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:40.300]   "they're terrible, there's no way,
[00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:41.940]   "they can't prove the loan,"
[00:46:41.940 --> 00:46:43.900]   and they go on and on and on and on.
[00:46:43.900 --> 00:46:46.660]   First of all, these are all of the same companies
[00:46:46.660 --> 00:46:49.340]   that were doing credit counseling a decade ago,
[00:46:49.340 --> 00:46:52.380]   then they were doing debt settlement nine years ago,
[00:46:52.380 --> 00:46:54.380]   then they were doing mortgage modifications
[00:46:54.380 --> 00:46:55.740]   for the past couple of years,
[00:46:55.740 --> 00:46:57.960]   and now that the mortgage mod market has dried up
[00:46:57.960 --> 00:46:59.580]   or become highly regulated,
[00:46:59.580 --> 00:47:01.860]   now they're all going back into debt settlement
[00:47:01.860 --> 00:47:03.060]   and doing student loan work.
[00:47:03.060 --> 00:47:08.020]   A lot of them are doing, A, getting you into new loans
[00:47:08.020 --> 00:47:11.420]   with new lenders on even worse terms
[00:47:11.420 --> 00:47:12.900]   and getting their legal fees,
[00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:17.100]   which are an enormous percentage of that loan
[00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:18.660]   from that new lender.
[00:47:18.660 --> 00:47:21.820]   The way that they're doing the debt settlement
[00:47:21.820 --> 00:47:24.940]   is they're making you promises that they can't keep.
[00:47:24.940 --> 00:47:27.300]   Anytime anybody guarantees anything,
[00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:29.460]   you really need to be suspicious of it,
[00:47:29.460 --> 00:47:31.620]   'cause nobody can guarantee something
[00:47:31.620 --> 00:47:34.020]   that they don't have control over.
[00:47:34.020 --> 00:47:37.580]   That having been said, private student loans settle.
[00:47:37.580 --> 00:47:39.380]   They settle a lot.
[00:47:39.380 --> 00:47:41.680]   They settle at extreme discounts,
[00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:45.920]   depending upon the loan, who actually owns it,
[00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:47.340]   because they're all bundled together
[00:47:47.340 --> 00:47:48.840]   and turned into securities
[00:47:48.840 --> 00:47:52.920]   and very complex financial instruments.
[00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:56.520]   But it all depends upon how old the loan is,
[00:47:56.520 --> 00:48:00.220]   how badly the rest of their portfolio is doing,
[00:48:00.220 --> 00:48:01.740]   and when you hit them.
[00:48:01.740 --> 00:48:04.400]   If you are in default or know
[00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:06.440]   that you're gonna go into default,
[00:48:06.440 --> 00:48:10.780]   what your step is, you've gotta start bankrolling money.
[00:48:10.780 --> 00:48:15.020]   You've gotta start throwing, even if it's 50 bucks a month,
[00:48:15.020 --> 00:48:16.780]   you've gotta do something.
[00:48:16.780 --> 00:48:20.580]   Throw money on a regular basis into a savings account
[00:48:20.580 --> 00:48:22.340]   that is unattached to your checking account,
[00:48:22.340 --> 00:48:24.140]   because at some point,
[00:48:24.140 --> 00:48:28.100]   you are going to have an opportunity to resolve that loan
[00:48:28.100 --> 00:48:30.420]   for an amount of money that is less
[00:48:30.420 --> 00:48:32.900]   than what you currently owe,
[00:48:32.900 --> 00:48:36.100]   and you get a far better deal if there's cash at the door.
[00:48:36.100 --> 00:48:38.940]   If you can throw money on the table day one,
[00:48:38.940 --> 00:48:40.860]   you're gonna get a far better deal.
[00:48:40.860 --> 00:48:42.980]   Now, your deal's not gonna come right away.
[00:48:42.980 --> 00:48:45.140]   You've gotta be really far behind.
[00:48:45.140 --> 00:48:47.500]   I'm not talking about 30 or 60 or 90 days.
[00:48:47.500 --> 00:48:50.860]   I'm talking about a year, two years, three years.
[00:48:50.860 --> 00:48:52.400]   You've gotta be way behind.
[00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:55.980]   But if you can't make the payment
[00:48:55.980 --> 00:48:58.720]   and keep food on your plate and a roof over your head,
[00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:01.820]   you've gotta do what you've gotta do.
[00:49:01.820 --> 00:49:06.940]   And so, that's really gonna be your last step
[00:49:06.940 --> 00:49:08.860]   until you get to the litigation stage
[00:49:08.860 --> 00:49:10.780]   or whether bankruptcy's gonna be an option
[00:49:10.780 --> 00:49:11.780]   or any of those things.
[00:49:11.780 --> 00:49:15.300]   But you want to know that you've got some money
[00:49:15.300 --> 00:49:16.540]   sitting in your back pocket,
[00:49:16.540 --> 00:49:19.500]   so if somebody comes to you with a decent deal,
[00:49:19.500 --> 00:49:20.900]   you can afford to pay it.
[00:49:20.900 --> 00:49:22.780]   And last but not least,
[00:49:23.660 --> 00:49:26.140]   you don't need to hire anybody
[00:49:26.140 --> 00:49:27.860]   to do a debt settlement for you.
[00:49:27.860 --> 00:49:31.340]   There is nobody, nobody,
[00:49:31.340 --> 00:49:34.100]   who's got an in with the company
[00:49:34.100 --> 00:49:38.420]   or knows the right people or has the right relationships.
[00:49:38.420 --> 00:49:41.940]   That's sales and that's only gonna cost you money
[00:49:41.940 --> 00:49:44.060]   and it's not gonna save you anything
[00:49:44.060 --> 00:49:45.620]   in terms of your settlement.
[00:49:45.620 --> 00:49:46.980]   - Got it.
[00:49:46.980 --> 00:49:49.100]   I think that's really valuable to talk through
[00:49:49.100 --> 00:49:52.180]   and this is why, so I wanna transition here
[00:49:52.180 --> 00:49:53.600]   to just talking about your sponsorship.
[00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:56.900]   This is why I am so excited to have you on the show
[00:49:56.900 --> 00:49:59.900]   because, so the way that we got to talking
[00:49:59.900 --> 00:50:02.860]   about sponsorship was that I had you on the show,
[00:50:02.860 --> 00:50:03.940]   we did the interview,
[00:50:03.940 --> 00:50:05.900]   and then when I was up at FinCon,
[00:50:05.900 --> 00:50:08.300]   you mentioned to me that some of my listeners
[00:50:08.300 --> 00:50:10.500]   had called you and that you've been able
[00:50:10.500 --> 00:50:11.660]   to help some people and you've been able
[00:50:11.660 --> 00:50:13.480]   to make some money, serve some clients,
[00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:15.820]   and you said, "Hey, let's talk about sponsorship."
[00:50:15.820 --> 00:50:19.380]   And immediately I knew that this was exactly the fit
[00:50:19.380 --> 00:50:21.940]   that I've been looking for of how to bring sponsors on
[00:50:21.940 --> 00:50:24.400]   because you are a subject matter expert
[00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:27.440]   and what I believe, if I were still working
[00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:31.840]   as a face-to-face financial advisor,
[00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:35.140]   every single one of my clients who had student loans,
[00:50:35.140 --> 00:50:38.280]   I would send to you because this is the way
[00:50:38.280 --> 00:50:39.840]   that we should work with professionals
[00:50:39.840 --> 00:50:42.520]   where we should talk to professionals
[00:50:42.520 --> 00:50:46.280]   and find out exactly what the options are.
[00:50:46.280 --> 00:50:48.100]   And if you do a review for them
[00:50:48.100 --> 00:50:50.800]   or if it costs them 100 or 200 bucks,
[00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:52.060]   however much your initial,
[00:50:52.060 --> 00:50:53.700]   and we'll talk about that in a moment,
[00:50:53.700 --> 00:50:56.820]   but however much your initial packages run for people,
[00:50:56.820 --> 00:51:01.820]   then knowing just the idea of,
[00:51:01.820 --> 00:51:04.460]   hey, why don't you leave this $50,000 job
[00:51:04.460 --> 00:51:06.640]   at a for-profit company that you don't like,
[00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:10.400]   move into a $50,000 job at a not-for-profit company
[00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:13.460]   that you do like, learning a skill that you want to learn,
[00:51:13.460 --> 00:51:15.520]   this will allow you to help have your student loans
[00:51:15.520 --> 00:51:17.980]   paid down using a repayment plan
[00:51:17.980 --> 00:51:21.420]   while you enhance your expertise and credibility
[00:51:21.420 --> 00:51:24.060]   and serve this cause that you really care about,
[00:51:24.060 --> 00:51:28.340]   become a world-class employee in X skill,
[00:51:28.340 --> 00:51:31.300]   and then after the loans are taken care of,
[00:51:31.300 --> 00:51:33.700]   you'll be able to transition back to the for-profit world
[00:51:33.700 --> 00:51:37.960]   and you'll have spent that time building that skill set
[00:51:37.960 --> 00:51:40.980]   where you can now switch from 50,000 bucks of income
[00:51:40.980 --> 00:51:43.240]   to $250,000 of income
[00:51:43.240 --> 00:51:45.020]   and you've had a better experience along the way.
[00:51:45.020 --> 00:51:49.220]   One idea like that is incredible, has incredible options,
[00:51:49.220 --> 00:51:51.820]   and so, but it's really hard, you know, for me,
[00:51:51.820 --> 00:51:53.540]   I'm a generalist in most things
[00:51:53.540 --> 00:51:55.460]   and I have a little bit of general knowledge.
[00:51:55.460 --> 00:51:57.880]   I can't have, I'm so confused
[00:51:57.880 --> 00:52:00.980]   about the 10 repayment plans that you said.
[00:52:00.980 --> 00:52:02.540]   I wouldn't even know where to start.
[00:52:02.540 --> 00:52:05.100]   And so this, I believe, is gonna be,
[00:52:05.100 --> 00:52:07.820]   I'm hoping that our business relationship
[00:52:07.820 --> 00:52:10.140]   is gonna be a long-term scenario,
[00:52:10.140 --> 00:52:13.060]   and I believe it's really gonna serve listeners in my show
[00:52:13.060 --> 00:52:14.940]   who have student loans to go through
[00:52:14.940 --> 00:52:16.460]   and check, and even if they go through
[00:52:16.460 --> 00:52:20.940]   and they check on what, on their situation
[00:52:20.940 --> 00:52:24.840]   and they find out, oh, okay, there's no magic formula,
[00:52:24.840 --> 00:52:26.660]   I just need to pay this thing off,
[00:52:26.660 --> 00:52:28.700]   then still, at least you've got the confidence
[00:52:28.700 --> 00:52:31.000]   of knowing that that's the right path,
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:35.120]   and that is such a big thing for people to be aware of,
[00:52:35.120 --> 00:52:39.100]   and it's hard to get really good advice on this area
[00:52:39.100 --> 00:52:41.500]   because it's not mainstream.
[00:52:41.500 --> 00:52:43.380]   - Right, yeah, absolutely.
[00:52:43.380 --> 00:52:47.260]   - And that certainty is what allows you to sleep at night.
[00:52:47.260 --> 00:52:48.940]   At least you know where things are going, right?
[00:52:48.940 --> 00:52:51.100]   - Right, and I mean, Proverbs says,
[00:52:51.100 --> 00:52:53.340]   "In a multitude of counselors, there's wisdom."
[00:52:53.340 --> 00:52:55.980]   So I've always believed, get as much input as possible,
[00:52:55.980 --> 00:52:58.700]   and I, as an individual, I'm always able
[00:52:58.700 --> 00:53:00.660]   to be at the center of my situation
[00:53:00.660 --> 00:53:02.100]   and look at all the different options,
[00:53:02.100 --> 00:53:05.660]   but I should be getting as much info as possible.
[00:53:05.660 --> 00:53:08.860]   I learned, I'll tell you, one thing I learned in sales
[00:53:08.860 --> 00:53:11.180]   when I originally got in the life insurance business,
[00:53:11.180 --> 00:53:14.460]   I thought, when I started in the life insurance business,
[00:53:14.460 --> 00:53:16.540]   that the easy people to get in front of
[00:53:16.540 --> 00:53:19.340]   would be the broke people, and the difficult people
[00:53:19.340 --> 00:53:21.260]   to get in front of would be the rich people.
[00:53:21.260 --> 00:53:23.720]   And in general, in any aspect of financial services,
[00:53:23.720 --> 00:53:25.500]   you usually want to get in front of the rich people
[00:53:25.500 --> 00:53:27.140]   because the rich people can write bigger checks,
[00:53:27.140 --> 00:53:28.620]   and you're paid a commission that's based upon
[00:53:28.620 --> 00:53:30.180]   the size of the check they're writing,
[00:53:30.180 --> 00:53:32.180]   and so you want to get in front of rich people.
[00:53:32.180 --> 00:53:34.940]   Well, what I found was that the broke people,
[00:53:34.940 --> 00:53:38.160]   here I am, really just a knowledgeable, caring person
[00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:40.140]   wanting to help them with a debt snowball,
[00:53:40.140 --> 00:53:41.980]   and to get out of debt and pay off their credit cards.
[00:53:41.980 --> 00:53:44.420]   The broke people would not take my meetings.
[00:53:44.420 --> 00:53:46.040]   They would generally tell me no,
[00:53:46.040 --> 00:53:47.860]   and the rich people would say, yeah, come on by.
[00:53:47.860 --> 00:53:50.020]   I'll be in the office Monday afternoon, come on by.
[00:53:50.020 --> 00:53:53.040]   Now, the rich people were very careful with their time.
[00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:54.600]   I couldn't sit there for an hour and a half
[00:53:54.600 --> 00:53:57.620]   and drone on and on, but they always wanted to hear from me.
[00:53:57.620 --> 00:54:01.960]   And I learned, and I couldn't prove this with data,
[00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:04.620]   but I proved it with personal experience.
[00:54:04.620 --> 00:54:07.940]   I learned that I think one aspect of people who are rich
[00:54:07.940 --> 00:54:09.780]   is that they always are open for an idea.
[00:54:09.780 --> 00:54:11.460]   They're always looking for something.
[00:54:11.460 --> 00:54:14.940]   So, anytime, that's why I go to conferences,
[00:54:14.940 --> 00:54:16.620]   I listen to podcasts, I read books,
[00:54:16.620 --> 00:54:19.660]   'cause one idea, just one, one little idea
[00:54:19.660 --> 00:54:22.580]   that you find in the most interesting corner of the world
[00:54:22.580 --> 00:54:24.400]   that you were just looking, rooting around in
[00:54:24.400 --> 00:54:28.600]   for a few minutes can make a massive difference
[00:54:28.600 --> 00:54:30.580]   in your life, and so some of these aspects
[00:54:30.580 --> 00:54:32.800]   of student loans, I think, can be that.
[00:54:32.800 --> 00:54:35.300]   So, let's talk about your actual services,
[00:54:35.300 --> 00:54:37.220]   because you have some consulting,
[00:54:37.220 --> 00:54:40.020]   which is what we're primarily bringing you on for.
[00:54:40.020 --> 00:54:41.340]   Then you have the podcast, and I want us
[00:54:41.340 --> 00:54:42.620]   to talk about the podcast, 'cause that's where
[00:54:42.620 --> 00:54:44.020]   I want my listeners to go if they're interested
[00:54:44.020 --> 00:54:46.860]   in more details, is to also listen to your podcast,
[00:54:46.860 --> 00:54:48.660]   to reach out to you, and then you also have
[00:54:48.660 --> 00:54:50.900]   the attorney thing, but you're a little bit limited
[00:54:50.900 --> 00:54:52.300]   on who you can serve there.
[00:54:52.300 --> 00:54:54.060]   So, talk about your services, the offerings
[00:54:54.060 --> 00:54:56.580]   that you provide, the offerings that your firm has,
[00:54:56.580 --> 00:54:57.820]   the media outlets that you have.
[00:54:57.820 --> 00:54:59.900]   Walk us through everything that you have to offer
[00:54:59.900 --> 00:55:01.680]   for my listening audience.
[00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:06.680]   - Sure, so if somebody is in the state of New York,
[00:55:06.780 --> 00:55:09.220]   or in the state of California, we're licensed
[00:55:09.220 --> 00:55:12.060]   in both places, and can really give a full range
[00:55:12.060 --> 00:55:14.940]   of services in terms of legal representation.
[00:55:14.940 --> 00:55:19.540]   If you're being sued, we can help you defend that lawsuit.
[00:55:19.540 --> 00:55:21.900]   If bankruptcy is an option for you,
[00:55:21.900 --> 00:55:23.620]   we can help you file for bankruptcy,
[00:55:23.620 --> 00:55:26.740]   and that could be either to wipe out the student loans,
[00:55:26.740 --> 00:55:30.980]   which, no, it's not impossible, or it could be
[00:55:30.980 --> 00:55:32.860]   to restructure those student loans,
[00:55:32.860 --> 00:55:34.940]   which is what a lot of people do.
[00:55:34.940 --> 00:55:37.700]   So, in the states of California and in New York,
[00:55:37.700 --> 00:55:42.320]   we can do those things in addition to the things
[00:55:42.320 --> 00:55:44.020]   that we can do nationwide.
[00:55:44.020 --> 00:55:47.180]   Nationwide, I work with people with respect
[00:55:47.180 --> 00:55:49.620]   to their federal student loan issues,
[00:55:49.620 --> 00:55:53.120]   helping them determine which is their best repayment option,
[00:55:53.120 --> 00:55:55.840]   helping them determine whether or not consolidation
[00:55:55.840 --> 00:56:00.840]   is in their best interest, helping them with a rehabilitation
[00:56:00.920 --> 00:56:05.200]   either by working directly with the debt collector,
[00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:08.540]   or giving them the tools to do it on their own.
[00:56:08.540 --> 00:56:12.200]   All of those things, the full range of services
[00:56:12.200 --> 00:56:13.960]   with respect to the federal student loans,
[00:56:13.960 --> 00:56:16.240]   and a lot of people find that useful
[00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:19.960]   because the way that I structure my analysis
[00:56:19.960 --> 00:56:23.800]   is always because you're paying me for the analysis.
[00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:28.360]   So, I'm gonna give everything that there is to give.
[00:56:28.360 --> 00:56:31.920]   Not only here's what you need to do.
[00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:36.920]   For example, you're in a position where you may want
[00:56:36.920 --> 00:56:42.760]   to go with public service loan forgiveness.
[00:56:42.760 --> 00:56:45.060]   Well, in order to do that, you've gotta be
[00:56:45.060 --> 00:56:46.440]   in the direct loan program.
[00:56:46.440 --> 00:56:50.960]   So, you've got five loans, three of them are field loans.
[00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:53.960]   You're gonna need to consolidate them.
[00:56:53.960 --> 00:56:56.360]   Most people are gonna stop there and say,
[00:56:56.360 --> 00:56:58.160]   "Okay, great, consolidate the loan."
[00:56:58.160 --> 00:57:00.120]   And by the way, I can do that for you
[00:57:00.120 --> 00:57:02.960]   for X amount of dollars, not how I do it.
[00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:04.960]   As far as I'm concerned, it's a waste of money
[00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:09.040]   to hire anybody for consolidation because it's a form.
[00:57:09.040 --> 00:57:13.320]   It's a two-page form, and half of the form is check boxes.
[00:57:13.320 --> 00:57:16.000]   So, I'll give you a link to the form.
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:19.080]   It's a federal form, there's no magic involved.
[00:57:19.080 --> 00:57:21.200]   I'll tell you what form to use.
[00:57:21.200 --> 00:57:22.880]   I'll tell you what to do with it,
[00:57:22.880 --> 00:57:25.400]   and I'll tell you where to send it.
[00:57:25.400 --> 00:57:28.520]   I'm giving an entire roadmap,
[00:57:28.520 --> 00:57:30.680]   and I do that for a couple of reasons.
[00:57:30.680 --> 00:57:34.200]   First of all, I realize that there are too many people
[00:57:34.200 --> 00:57:37.400]   who are getting taken advantage of by these private companies
[00:57:37.400 --> 00:57:40.320]   and I would love nothing more than to put all of them
[00:57:40.320 --> 00:57:42.840]   out of business by doing what I do,
[00:57:42.840 --> 00:57:45.160]   by just giving reliable information.
[00:57:45.160 --> 00:57:49.880]   Second of all, the people who don't have the ability
[00:57:49.880 --> 00:57:51.740]   to, say, do their own consolidation
[00:57:51.740 --> 00:57:53.520]   or do their own rehabilitation,
[00:57:53.520 --> 00:57:56.000]   either they're afraid of the bureaucracy,
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:57.920]   they don't have the time, they're busy,
[00:57:57.920 --> 00:58:00.120]   they travel, they've got big families,
[00:58:00.120 --> 00:58:04.540]   maybe it's worth it for them to hire somebody else to do it.
[00:58:04.540 --> 00:58:05.820]   Sure, we'll do that, and yes,
[00:58:05.820 --> 00:58:07.040]   there's gonna be an additional fee,
[00:58:07.040 --> 00:58:10.440]   but it's not gonna be nearly what you're gonna pay
[00:58:10.440 --> 00:58:12.080]   for any of these private companies.
[00:58:12.080 --> 00:58:16.960]   And quite frankly, I would say maybe three or 4%
[00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:19.400]   of the people who call me up and talk to me
[00:58:19.400 --> 00:58:21.480]   about a federal student loan issue
[00:58:21.480 --> 00:58:25.240]   are going to need to hire me for anything else.
[00:58:25.240 --> 00:58:29.220]   It's just not something that happens all the time.
[00:58:29.220 --> 00:58:33.600]   So I give you the tools to do everything
[00:58:33.600 --> 00:58:35.640]   that you need to do for your federal student loans.
[00:58:35.640 --> 00:58:37.900]   With your private student loans,
[00:58:37.900 --> 00:58:40.340]   I am more in the nature of a coach.
[00:58:40.340 --> 00:58:45.120]   It is a discussion of what the collection process
[00:58:45.120 --> 00:58:47.960]   is going to entail if you do fall back,
[00:58:47.960 --> 00:58:50.480]   a review of your promissory note with you
[00:58:50.480 --> 00:58:52.880]   so that you can better understand
[00:58:52.880 --> 00:58:55.100]   what your rights and responsibilities are
[00:58:55.100 --> 00:58:56.720]   and how to structure that,
[00:58:56.720 --> 00:58:59.680]   a discussion of maybe there's a refinance option
[00:58:59.680 --> 00:59:01.480]   that you hadn't thought about,
[00:59:01.480 --> 00:59:02.760]   talk about that a little bit
[00:59:02.760 --> 00:59:05.120]   and talk about how that process works,
[00:59:05.120 --> 00:59:10.120]   talk about the impact on your co-signers, guarantors,
[00:59:10.120 --> 00:59:13.700]   tell you what the collection process looks like, as I said,
[00:59:13.700 --> 00:59:16.160]   but also talk to you about the ways
[00:59:16.160 --> 00:59:19.720]   that you can make that process easier,
[00:59:19.720 --> 00:59:23.840]   how to stop the phone calls, how to stop the letters,
[00:59:23.840 --> 00:59:28.840]   how to make sure that the negative impact
[00:59:28.840 --> 00:59:33.340]   on your credit score is not as bad as it could be
[00:59:33.340 --> 00:59:35.880]   because there are ways to actually minimize
[00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:37.760]   the hit that your credit score takes.
[00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:40.240]   Most people don't realize that.
[00:59:40.240 --> 00:59:42.940]   Reviews of your credit reports
[00:59:42.940 --> 00:59:46.320]   to ensure that what is there is accurate
[00:59:46.320 --> 00:59:49.640]   and to work with you to help you get rid
[00:59:49.640 --> 00:59:51.220]   of the inaccurate things.
[00:59:51.220 --> 00:59:53.880]   By law, you can't get rid of anything that's accurate.
[00:59:53.880 --> 00:59:55.840]   It's not the way that the law is working,
[00:59:55.840 --> 00:59:59.900]   but anything that is not accurate or is out of date,
[00:59:59.900 --> 01:00:01.620]   we can talk about ways for you
[01:00:01.620 --> 01:00:03.280]   to get that off of your report,
[01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:06.500]   and I will help you work through that process.
[01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:12.080]   So it really is the full range of the federal
[01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:14.240]   as well as the private student loan work.
[01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:16.840]   The only things that I can't do for people
[01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:20.240]   who are outside of the states of California or New York
[01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:24.960]   is I cannot help you file for bankruptcy.
[01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:28.800]   I can't really tell you very much about that
[01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:31.000]   because so much of that is local.
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.960]   Bankruptcy is federal law, but so much of it is local.
[01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:36.800]   What you get to keep, what you have to give up,
[01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:39.880]   qualification levels, a lot of that is gonna be local.
[01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:44.120]   - But you do teach, don't you teach at the consumer,
[01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:45.800]   like in the Bar Association,
[01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:47.840]   don't you teach a lot of lawyers around the country
[01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:50.920]   that you could refer people to?
[01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:52.120]   - Yes, absolutely.
[01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:55.460]   So, and that's really the last piece of the puzzle.
[01:00:55.460 --> 01:01:00.460]   To the extent that you're located someplace where I'm not,
[01:01:00.460 --> 01:01:04.360]   I've got people everywhere around the country.
[01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:06.880]   They're friends of mine, they're people that I've trained,
[01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:09.960]   they're people who understand the lay of the law
[01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:14.240]   exactly in the fashion that you need them to understand it.
[01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:17.300]   So let's say you're in Dallas, Texas.
[01:01:17.300 --> 01:01:20.160]   I can't represent you if you're being sued,
[01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:23.920]   but I know a couple of really great lawyers who can.
[01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:26.920]   And so the end of our conversation
[01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:28.760]   with respect to the private student loans
[01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:32.800]   is going to include, okay, well,
[01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:34.480]   why don't you call this person
[01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:37.300]   and they can take you that last mile
[01:01:37.300 --> 01:01:40.520]   if you want them to do so with respect to the private loans.
[01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:43.160]   Of course, with respect to the federal loans,
[01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:46.140]   if you're in Dallas, I can still help you there.
[01:01:46.140 --> 01:01:48.040]   - So what about,
[01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:53.000]   tell some of the people that,
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:56.700]   and obviously individual's information is private,
[01:01:56.700 --> 01:01:58.080]   but you had mentioned, you mentioned to me
[01:01:58.080 --> 01:01:59.360]   that some of the listeners of the show
[01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:01.880]   had reached out to you after the previous episode.
[01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:03.400]   What were the different types of ways
[01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:06.200]   that you were able to help some of those listeners,
[01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:08.280]   speaking in general terms?
[01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:10.660]   - Speaking in general terms,
[01:02:10.660 --> 01:02:13.620]   a lot of those listeners had questions about,
[01:02:13.620 --> 01:02:16.940]   I mean, look, you got confused about 10 repayment options.
[01:02:16.940 --> 01:02:17.780]   It's not--
[01:02:17.780 --> 01:02:20.700]   - How am I supposed to know what I'm talking about?
[01:02:20.700 --> 01:02:22.180]   By the way, I want to come,
[01:02:22.180 --> 01:02:23.860]   next time you do a bar association,
[01:02:23.860 --> 01:02:25.740]   like workshop or something, let me know.
[01:02:25.740 --> 01:02:28.140]   And I want to come, 'cause I just realized
[01:02:28.140 --> 01:02:29.540]   how much I don't know in this area.
[01:02:29.540 --> 01:02:32.260]   And I've been listening to your show to learn more,
[01:02:32.260 --> 01:02:33.820]   but your show is consumer-focused.
[01:02:33.820 --> 01:02:37.880]   So I want to come to one of your attorney education classes,
[01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:39.320]   or have you record it for me
[01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:41.440]   so I can listen to it after the fact.
[01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:42.520]   - That sounds great.
[01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:46.180]   We're actually going to be in Florida
[01:02:46.180 --> 01:02:48.120]   in either the end of January
[01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:51.680]   or right after Super Bowl Sunday, the next week after that.
[01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:53.280]   - All right, we'll see if we can make that happen.
[01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:55.440]   - Yeah, exactly, that'd be awesome.
[01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:58.560]   But so a lot of people called me up and said,
[01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:01.200]   hey, look, I've got all of these repayment options.
[01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:03.180]   I don't understand what's going to work for me.
[01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:06.360]   And I want to make sure that I'm getting into them
[01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:07.520]   in the right way.
[01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:10.560]   And one just hits me off top of the head.
[01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:14.640]   One person had a whole bunch of loans, all federal.
[01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:16.920]   One of them was a Parent PLUS loan,
[01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:19.400]   wanted to do a consolidation of all of their loans
[01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:21.240]   and get into income-based repayment.
[01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:24.360]   I said, well, that's a great idea,
[01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:26.120]   but for the Parent PLUS loan.
[01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:28.200]   If you have a Parent PLUS loan
[01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:32.060]   that is part of a federal consolidation loan,
[01:03:32.060 --> 01:03:36.640]   that federal consolidation loan does not qualify
[01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:39.440]   for income-based repayment, pay-as-you-earn,
[01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:41.880]   or revised pay-as-you-earn,
[01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:46.880]   and in fact will therefore cause you a lot of problems.
[01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:50.260]   So there was this one client
[01:03:50.260 --> 01:03:52.200]   that I counseled them specifically
[01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:55.200]   on consolidating these loans,
[01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:59.040]   not putting that Parent PLUS loan into the consolidation,
[01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:00.480]   handling that separately
[01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:03.620]   so that they can lower their overall payment.
[01:04:03.620 --> 01:04:08.620]   I had clients talk to me about the husband and wife,
[01:04:08.620 --> 01:04:11.660]   and one had loans, one didn't have loans.
[01:04:11.660 --> 01:04:12.760]   Should we file separately?
[01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:14.020]   Should we file jointly?
[01:04:14.020 --> 01:04:14.980]   Let's run the numbers.
[01:04:14.980 --> 01:04:16.620]   Let's see what it's gonna be.
[01:04:16.620 --> 01:04:19.820]   I had people who were in default,
[01:04:19.820 --> 01:04:22.180]   didn't know if they should rehabilitate
[01:04:22.180 --> 01:04:25.420]   or whether they should consolidate.
[01:04:25.420 --> 01:04:26.820]   The list goes on and on.
[01:04:26.820 --> 01:04:28.620]   On the private student loan issue,
[01:04:28.620 --> 01:04:30.600]   should I continue to make payments?
[01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:33.240]   Should I intentionally default?
[01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:34.520]   'Cause some people do that.
[01:04:34.520 --> 01:04:37.560]   Strategic default is a big deal in private student loans.
[01:04:37.560 --> 01:04:41.920]   Is there a way for me to get my cosigner off?
[01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:43.120]   What about refinance?
[01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:44.720]   We talked about all of those options.
[01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:47.680]   So those are just some of the things in general terms
[01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:49.120]   that I've talked to listeners
[01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:51.040]   of Radical Personal Finance about.
[01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:52.440]   - Yeah, that's perfect.
[01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:55.960]   And again, I'm excited about our getting this going
[01:04:55.960 --> 01:05:00.020]   because this is the perfect value-add sponsor
[01:05:00.020 --> 01:05:02.860]   where you add tremendous value to the audience.
[01:05:02.860 --> 01:05:04.500]   You add tremendous value to the message
[01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:06.360]   of Radical Personal Finance,
[01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:09.600]   and it really provides a resource
[01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:11.380]   that I'm really, really thrilled about.
[01:05:11.380 --> 01:05:13.760]   So we have a number of packages that you offer
[01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:16.020]   as far as student loan analysis,
[01:05:16.020 --> 01:05:18.420]   details of all of those things at,
[01:05:18.420 --> 01:05:21.180]   basically three things that we want people to do.
[01:05:21.180 --> 01:05:23.520]   Number one, sign up for Jay's podcast
[01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:25.020]   and listen to the show.
[01:05:25.020 --> 01:05:27.900]   So sign up on iTunes for the student loan show
[01:05:27.900 --> 01:05:29.540]   with Jay Fleischman, and I'll make sure
[01:05:29.540 --> 01:05:31.900]   that there's a link in today's show notes.
[01:05:31.900 --> 01:05:33.760]   Sign up for Jay's podcast
[01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:36.040]   so that you can get more specific information from him.
[01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:38.040]   That's free for everybody to listen to.
[01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:40.980]   And do you publish that on a schedule?
[01:05:40.980 --> 01:05:43.420]   How frequently do you publish new episodes of that show?
[01:05:43.420 --> 01:05:44.860]   - That's weekly on Tuesdays.
[01:05:44.860 --> 01:05:45.700]   - Okay, perfect.
[01:05:45.700 --> 01:05:46.660]   So every week you can listen to that.
[01:05:46.660 --> 01:05:47.820]   So I want people to do that.
[01:05:47.820 --> 01:05:48.660]   That's free.
[01:05:48.660 --> 01:05:51.000]   Number two, if you have student loans,
[01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.120]   go to the special link for the show.
[01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:56.100]   It's studentloanshow.com/radical.
[01:05:56.100 --> 01:05:58.860]   So studentloanshow.com/radical.
[01:05:58.860 --> 01:06:01.180]   And there you'll find some information
[01:06:01.180 --> 01:06:04.100]   on the different packages that Jay has to offer
[01:06:04.100 --> 01:06:06.880]   as far as consultations.
[01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:10.100]   And we're doing a special for listeners of the show
[01:06:10.100 --> 01:06:13.320]   on a student loan review by email.
[01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:15.120]   They get 25 bucks off that package.
[01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:18.420]   So instead of 75 bucks, it's 50 bucks for listeners
[01:06:18.420 --> 01:06:19.700]   of the show who use that link.
[01:06:19.700 --> 01:06:20.820]   Is that right, Jay?
[01:06:20.820 --> 01:06:21.660]   - That's correct.
[01:06:21.660 --> 01:06:22.480]   - Okay.
[01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:24.300]   So you've got, that's the silver package,
[01:06:24.300 --> 01:06:25.560]   that's the entry-level package
[01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:27.520]   that is a student loan review by email.
[01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:28.860]   Then you've got a gold package,
[01:06:28.860 --> 01:06:29.980]   which is, excuse me, that would be
[01:06:29.980 --> 01:06:31.340]   the federal student loan review.
[01:06:31.340 --> 01:06:32.520]   You've got a gold package,
[01:06:32.520 --> 01:06:35.260]   which is a federal and private student loan.
[01:06:35.260 --> 01:06:37.760]   And then you've got an ongoing monthly package as well.
[01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:41.020]   So people can, and you'll consult with them.
[01:06:41.020 --> 01:06:44.380]   And then listeners can start with the simplest package.
[01:06:44.380 --> 01:06:46.740]   And then if they move up to some of your fancier
[01:06:46.740 --> 01:06:50.100]   consulting deals, then you'll roll that price in for them.
[01:06:50.100 --> 01:06:52.320]   And then you also have, once they start
[01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:55.360]   to get connected with you, if they need help from you
[01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:57.800]   with any further work as a lawyer,
[01:06:57.800 --> 01:07:00.320]   then you can service them if they're in New York
[01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:02.320]   or California, or you can at least point them
[01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:03.160]   in the right direction.
[01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:05.320]   And one thing about the pointing in the right direction,
[01:07:05.320 --> 01:07:07.000]   it's my understanding that in the lawyer business,
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.740]   you guys don't, you don't get commissions
[01:07:09.740 --> 01:07:10.980]   for referring business.
[01:07:10.980 --> 01:07:13.600]   So in real estate, if I were a real estate agent
[01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:16.460]   and I were referring somebody across the country,
[01:07:16.460 --> 01:07:17.560]   I'd get a split of the deal.
[01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:18.720]   My understanding in the lawyer business,
[01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:19.560]   you don't do that.
[01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:20.560]   - Okay.
[01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:21.400]   - I don't do that.
[01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:22.220]   - Okay, good.
[01:07:22.220 --> 01:07:23.060]   - Yeah.
[01:07:23.060 --> 01:07:28.880]   Anybody that I ever refer anybody else to
[01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:32.340]   is always done without a financial motive.
[01:07:32.340 --> 01:07:35.400]   I think that it just makes the most sense for me
[01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:38.240]   that I'm sending you to the right person,
[01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:40.520]   not because the check's gonna be big enough.
[01:07:40.520 --> 01:07:42.000]   And you know, so yeah.
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000]   - And as long as the listeners,
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:45.900]   I mean, and the important thing is
[01:07:45.900 --> 01:07:47.400]   that they're paying you up front.
[01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:49.160]   And I think all service providers
[01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:50.800]   should always be paid up front.
[01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:52.600]   You can provide some level of information
[01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:54.020]   as kind of a getting to know you,
[01:07:54.020 --> 01:07:56.280]   but listeners who sign up for your consulting packages,
[01:07:56.280 --> 01:07:57.600]   they're paying you up front.
[01:07:57.600 --> 01:07:59.920]   And so as such, you have an incentive to go ahead
[01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:01.420]   and help them to the extent of you can
[01:08:01.420 --> 01:08:03.320]   with the consulting work.
[01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:06.040]   And then also, if you need to send them to somebody,
[01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:07.000]   then that can be helpful.
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.200]   And there's no kind of backdoor,
[01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:10.920]   behind the scenes stuff going on.
[01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:12.880]   It's straightforward and clear.
[01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:13.720]   - That's correct.
[01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:15.000]   - So those are the three things.
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:16.560]   Sign up for Jay's Student Loan Show.
[01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:17.400]   Listen to that.
[01:08:17.400 --> 01:08:19.240]   If you're interested in his podcast,
[01:08:19.240 --> 01:08:22.280]   check out studentloanshow.com/radical.
[01:08:22.280 --> 01:08:23.800]   And you'll find links to,
[01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:25.360]   with a special offer for listeners
[01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:27.200]   of the Radical Personal Finance podcast.
[01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:29.240]   And then listeners can consume your content.
[01:08:29.240 --> 01:08:30.080]   And if they need to go deeper,
[01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:32.600]   they can get in touch with your law firm through that.
[01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:33.420]   Anything else, Jay,
[01:08:33.420 --> 01:08:34.680]   that you'd like to make sure people know about
[01:08:34.680 --> 01:08:37.240]   as we kick this sponsorship off?
[01:08:37.240 --> 01:08:38.720]   - Tell your friends.
[01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:39.560]   - Exactly.
[01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:42.860]   - Student loans are not a death sentence.
[01:08:42.860 --> 01:08:44.440]   And if you face them head on,
[01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:46.240]   and you understand your options,
[01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:48.080]   you're gonna be able to sleep better at night.
[01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:51.840]   And you're not gonna look at it as this albatross
[01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:52.960]   that's gonna hang around your neck
[01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:53.800]   for the rest of your life.
[01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:55.640]   'Cause it's just not the way that it is.
[01:08:55.640 --> 01:08:56.920]   - And one idea that comes to mind,
[01:08:56.920 --> 01:08:58.480]   I didn't think of this as we launched this here
[01:08:58.480 --> 01:08:59.340]   before the holidays.
[01:08:59.340 --> 01:09:03.960]   But if you wanna give a gift of Jay's consultations,
[01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:05.000]   that might be a good gift.
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.420]   Many of you who listen to this show,
[01:09:07.420 --> 01:09:09.320]   you guys are nerds, financial nerds.
[01:09:09.320 --> 01:09:10.400]   I mean, you gotta be to listen to me
[01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:11.800]   rattle on for an hour a day.
[01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:14.320]   So you guys are not normal people.
[01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:16.680]   And I say that with a firmly compliment.
[01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:18.320]   I'm not normal either.
[01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:20.600]   But what that means is that you know a lot of people
[01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:22.000]   who are often struggling.
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.680]   And so some of the strategies and ideas here,
[01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:26.560]   many people have student loans.
[01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:28.360]   Maybe those people are not gonna go ahead
[01:09:28.360 --> 01:09:29.800]   and get on the financial independence
[01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:31.440]   in five years bandwagon.
[01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:34.240]   But, and also many times people who are struggling
[01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:37.200]   or have problems with debt and money,
[01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:38.840]   they're not gonna listen to you
[01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:40.100]   'cause you're just a friend.
[01:09:40.100 --> 01:09:42.160]   But it's possible that if you wanted to give them a gift,
[01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:44.600]   give them a gift of Jay's consulting services
[01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:47.720]   and let him see if there's something that they can do
[01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:49.240]   that's gonna make a big difference.
[01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:52.940]   And you might be able to give them a 50, 75, $150 gift.
[01:09:52.940 --> 01:09:55.280]   And that might make a difference
[01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:57.120]   in their life of thousands of dollars.
[01:09:57.120 --> 01:09:58.400]   So this might be a really great way
[01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:00.120]   for you to help some friends of yours.
[01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:02.020]   Even if you don't personally have student loans,
[01:10:02.020 --> 01:10:02.860]   it might be a good way for you
[01:10:02.860 --> 01:10:04.700]   to help some friends of yours who do
[01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:06.760]   so that they can save some money overall.
[01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:09.800]   'Cause I tell you, we do have an epidemic
[01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:11.200]   in this country of student loan debt.
[01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:12.320]   And I hate it.
[01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:14.840]   I despise student loan debt.
[01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:17.520]   And so if you got it, we got it.
[01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:19.280]   I borrowed money when I was in college.
[01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:20.640]   I was one of the fortunate few
[01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:22.060]   that paid it off before I graduated.
[01:10:22.060 --> 01:10:24.960]   Although in retrospect, maybe I sometimes wonder
[01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:25.800]   if that was a good idea.
[01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:27.480]   But at that point I was on the Dave Ramsey plan.
[01:10:27.480 --> 01:10:29.520]   I was getting out of debt no matter what.
[01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:30.480]   (laughing)
[01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:33.600]   So at any rate, it's done and done.
[01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:35.800]   But if we have the debt,
[01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:38.180]   we can work through it and get it squared away.
[01:10:38.180 --> 01:10:40.040]   So Jay, thanks so much for coming on.
[01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:41.680]   Thank you for sponsoring this show.
[01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:42.840]   I'm excited about this.
[01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:43.920]   - And so am I.
[01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:45.000]   - I look forward to a long
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.400]   and profitable business relationship with you
[01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:48.720]   on both of our ends. - And so do I.
[01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:50.240]   Yeah, it's gonna be great.
[01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:53.160]   Thanks for letting me be a sponsor.
[01:10:53.160 --> 01:10:55.080]   I know that you don't take everybody.
[01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:57.600]   And look, this is a great show
[01:10:57.600 --> 01:11:00.120]   and I am so pleased to be a part of it
[01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:01.340]   in any way that I can be.
[01:11:01.340 --> 01:11:02.680]   So thanks for that, Joshua.
[01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:06.480]   - Hope you enjoyed that and I hope you learned.
[01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:09.640]   And now I would just simply encourage you to take action.
[01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:11.200]   And remember, there's those three things
[01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:12.120]   that I'd like you to do.
[01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:16.080]   Number one, subscribe to the Student Loan Show podcast.
[01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:18.320]   Jay does a really good job with that podcast.
[01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:21.880]   It's very focused and he's an expert in that area.
[01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:23.800]   So if you have any interest at all in student loans
[01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:25.480]   or you wanna learn about strategies
[01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:28.280]   or you have student loan questions, go and do that.
[01:11:28.280 --> 01:11:31.300]   And I think you'll enjoy the content.
[01:11:31.300 --> 01:11:32.560]   You can find it in iTunes
[01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:34.880]   or probably in whatever podcatching program you use
[01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:36.860]   to listen to it or on his website.
[01:11:36.860 --> 01:11:38.080]   And check out episode 31.
[01:11:38.080 --> 01:11:40.520]   That was the episode that we referenced
[01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:44.400]   with the owner of the brothel, a man named Dennis Hoff
[01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:46.440]   who owns a number of brothels,
[01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:49.000]   including the Moonlight Bunny Ranch out in Nevada
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:52.800]   and how he's offering discounts to his employees,
[01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:54.320]   the girls that work for him.
[01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:55.840]   He's offering a matching program
[01:11:55.840 --> 01:11:57.760]   where he's paying for their student loans.
[01:11:57.760 --> 01:11:59.680]   Very interesting, very interesting perspectives.
[01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:02.040]   Number one, subscribe to the Student Loan Show.
[01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:04.640]   Number two, go to, if you have student loans
[01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:06.240]   or if you know somebody who has student loans,
[01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:09.400]   go to studentloanshow.com/radical
[01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:11.760]   and you'll find there that special discount link.
[01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:15.440]   If you use that code, he, knocking $25 off
[01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:19.800]   the review by email where it's normally 75 bucks
[01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:23.160]   and at this point in time, he's offering it for 50 bucks.
[01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:25.600]   So a $25 discount for listeners of the show.
[01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:28.440]   But use that link, studentloanshow.com/radical.
[01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:30.680]   And then you can see there the other options
[01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:32.900]   if you have further detailed needs.
[01:12:32.900 --> 01:12:35.760]   And he'll offer, he'll apply that money
[01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:38.120]   over towards those other packages as well.
[01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:40.600]   And then if you have need for attorney services
[01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:43.360]   and you have questions on bankruptcy or student loans,
[01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:44.400]   reach out to him with that.
[01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:47.000]   You can easily email him on the show
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.760]   or connect with him through the consultation
[01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:52.720]   and he would be a great resource for you with that.
[01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:55.700]   As I'm sure that you heard from the content,
[01:12:55.700 --> 01:12:57.420]   there's a lot of different options.
[01:12:57.420 --> 01:12:58.680]   And if you've got questions,
[01:12:58.680 --> 01:12:59.760]   if you're going through bankruptcy,
[01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:01.160]   if you're in a difficult place,
[01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:02.640]   especially as regards student loans,
[01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:04.000]   Jay would be a good guy to reach out to.
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:07.060]   Hey, he's the one who's teaching all the other attorneys.
[01:13:07.060 --> 01:13:08.040]   (laughs)
[01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:09.100]   Why not work with the person
[01:13:09.100 --> 01:13:11.920]   who's teaching all the other attorneys if you can?
[01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:14.000]   And if not, then you can work with some of the attorneys
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:15.080]   that he's taught.
[01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:16.280]   So check out that information.
[01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:17.920]   And Jay, thanks for sponsoring the show.
[01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:19.600]   I'm really proud of this sponsorship.
[01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:21.200]   I've gotten some questions from some of you guys
[01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:22.800]   about how am I doing the sponsors.
[01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:25.000]   What I've been working to do on Radical Personal Finance,
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.520]   when I do a sponsor, I don't want you,
[01:13:27.520 --> 01:13:30.080]   on a podcast, you can always skip commercials.
[01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:31.440]   That's what's cool about podcasting.
[01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:34.240]   So I don't see any point in playing
[01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:36.760]   irrelevant commercials for you.
[01:13:36.760 --> 01:13:39.040]   At some point, who knows, maybe I'll do it at some point,
[01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:40.920]   but I don't intend to.
[01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:44.320]   Rather, I want you to gain as much value from the sponsors
[01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:46.120]   and from the commercials as even you do
[01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:47.880]   from the normal content of the show.
[01:13:47.880 --> 01:13:48.960]   That's my goal.
[01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:51.660]   Now, whether or not I can execute and complete that goal,
[01:13:51.660 --> 01:13:52.880]   that remains to be seen.
[01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:53.840]   You're the judge.
[01:13:53.840 --> 01:13:54.740]   But that's what I'm working on.
[01:13:54.740 --> 01:13:56.280]   I don't want you to have to feel like
[01:13:56.280 --> 01:13:58.760]   you've got to skip every time when I talk about a sponsor.
[01:13:58.760 --> 01:14:01.040]   So Jay is a perfect example of somebody
[01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:04.920]   who can serve a subset of you in the listening audience.
[01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:09.760]   And I'm really thankful that he agreed to sponsor the show.
[01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:12.420]   And then there are other people similar to him,
[01:14:12.420 --> 01:14:14.320]   or I want to bring on other consultants
[01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:16.840]   and things like that who can use
[01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:18.440]   the Radical Personal Finance platform,
[01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:20.600]   and they can go and provide for you
[01:14:20.600 --> 01:14:23.200]   the individual services that you need.
[01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:25.320]   So if you've got student loans, connect with Jay.
[01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:27.320]   Thank you all so much for listening to today's show.
[01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:29.120]   I really, really appreciate each and every one of you.
[01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:30.840]   I appreciate your support.
[01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:33.640]   I'm working hard to make the show better for you.
[01:14:33.640 --> 01:14:35.080]   I hope you can see that.
[01:14:35.080 --> 01:14:37.200]   I had a comment from a listener the other day
[01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:38.640]   that just talked about how much better
[01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:40.360]   the show's gotten since episode one.
[01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:42.480]   They referenced some of my early interviews.
[01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:44.240]   They said, Joshua, you've gotten a lot better.
[01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:45.080]   Thank you.
[01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:46.880]   For those of you who've made nice comments like that,
[01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:48.160]   I've been working hard at it.
[01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:50.360]   And obviously got a long ways to go still,
[01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:51.760]   but I am working hard at it.
[01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:53.240]   And that was what I promised in the beginning
[01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:55.760]   was to improve and to do it publicly
[01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:58.880]   so you can see the journey that I'm going through.
[01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:00.440]   If you'd like to support the show directly,
[01:15:00.440 --> 01:15:02.640]   please do that as a patron of the show.
[01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:05.480]   Go to radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron.
[01:15:05.480 --> 01:15:08.600]   By the way, if you sign up there at minimum the $10 level,
[01:15:08.600 --> 01:15:11.840]   that gives you access to all of these conference calls
[01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:12.680]   that I've been doing here
[01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:14.400]   in the month of October and November.
[01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:16.880]   And for any of you who have wanted my personal opinion
[01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:18.900]   and feedback on any of your situation,
[01:15:18.900 --> 01:15:21.760]   that has been an absolute steal for you.
[01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:24.080]   We did a call last night on Monday,
[01:15:24.080 --> 01:15:25.680]   and there were a total of three participants
[01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:26.760]   who joined that call.
[01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:30.120]   So all of those three participants were able to get
[01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:32.940]   basically a long period of time with me.
[01:15:32.940 --> 01:15:34.600]   So that's been an absolute steal.
[01:15:34.600 --> 01:15:36.600]   So check that out here during the month of November.
[01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:39.480]   We're doing weekly calls for my role of serving you,
[01:15:39.480 --> 01:15:40.920]   the patrons of the show.
[01:15:40.920 --> 01:15:42.640]   You can find all those details on the Patreon page
[01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:44.960]   at radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron.
[01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:47.000]   I ran out of music, but I'm done.
