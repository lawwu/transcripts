[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.780]   All right, we got a question now moving on from Luke. Luke says, When is deep work not
[00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:24.540]   the most important personal metric? All right, he elaborates in the book decoding greatness.
[00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.540]   Ron Friedman talks about the importance of tracking your important metrics. He even quotes
[00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:34.140]   you. How do I know if hours of deep work is the highest leverage metric for me or something
[00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:41.740]   else? Well, it's a good question. I think a useful, a useful bit of terminology when
[00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:48.840]   thinking about professional metrics comes from the the book, the four disciplines of
[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:57.040]   execution for DX, which I talked about briefly in my book, deep work. And they make a useful
[00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.640]   distinction, which I've heard other people make as well between what they call lead indicators
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:09.660]   and lag indicators. When it comes to measuring what matters for your work to be more successful.
[00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:14.500]   Lag indicators are the things in the end you actually care about. Right? I mean, this is
[00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.360]   the thing in the end that you want to actually improve. And it's very specific to the type
[00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:25.040]   of work you do. The example in 40 x is a supermarket bakery counter or something like this. And
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.600]   the lag indicator was sale numbers. In the end, we want sales numbers to go up. If you
[00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.380]   run a podcast, the lag indicator might be downloads. Now, how many people are listening
[00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:43.000]   to the show or how many in writing, how many people buy my book or in, you know, how much
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   units do we sell of this product is the thing you actually care about in the end. Now, what
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.960]   they talk about, and maybe this is what Friedman's talking about, too, is just tracking lag indicators
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.440]   is not enough to actually help you in the moment do the things that matter because it
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:06.740]   lags. It's not like you can do something today and immediately see its impact on those indicators
[00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.720]   that matter. And so what they argue is you should have lead indicators, things you can
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:17.700]   track today, that can influence your behavior today, that if you hit good numbers on those,
[00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:25.460]   it will down the line, help the lag indicators grow. So in the bakery scenario, you want
[00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:30.700]   the sales to go up, but the lead indicator might be something like, how many customers
[00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:36.940]   did we help or how many different display cases or did we clean? I mean, I don't know
[00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.980]   about bakery, but stuff you can actually do. Deep work is a lead indicator. For a lot of
[00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:49.700]   jobs, keeping track of how much deep work am I doing is a useful lead indicator. Because
[00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.340]   if deep work is necessary for moving the needle in your job, you need to do it to actually
[00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.700]   move the needle in your job. So it is it is useful. I don't know if I would call it the
[00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:04.420]   most important metric, though. I mean, in this case, two other things matter. Hey, do
[00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.920]   you have your lag indicators? Right? And are you looking at them? If you're just doing
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.020]   deep work for the sake of doing deep work, meaningless. You got to know the needle you're
[00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:17.340]   trying to move in the end, you got to be watching that needle to see if it's moving. And that
[00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.560]   needle is not moving, even though you're doing a lot of deep work, then to you have to care
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:26.980]   about what deep work Am I doing? Like, what is the right type of deep work that's going
[00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.380]   to move the needle on this particular thing that I care about on this particular lag indicator.
[00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:37.340]   So don't get too obsessive about just here's my deep work tally. I got six hours this week.
[00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.980]   That's an important tally to do. But only if you know what you're doing during those
[00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.900]   deep work hours, and it's tied to a very specific longer term goal that you're keeping a very
[00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:46.700]   careful eye on.
[00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:53.260]   [MUSIC]
