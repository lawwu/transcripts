[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500]   - So Smart Summon and soon AutoPark
[00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.420]   takes on the full beautiful mess of parking lots
[00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:10.820]   and their human to human nonverbal communication.
[00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.280]   I think it has actually the potential
[00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.180]   to have a profound impact in changing
[00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.020]   how our civilization looks at AI and robotics
[00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.020]   because this is the first time human beings,
[00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.260]   people that don't own a Tesla,
[00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.060]   may have never seen a Tesla or heard about a Tesla,
[00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.740]   get to watch hundreds of thousands of cars without a driver.
[00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:30.580]   - Yeah.
[00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.360]   - Do you see it this way,
[00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.560]   almost like an education tool for the world about AI?
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.140]   Do you feel the burden of that, the excitement of that,
[00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.160]   or do you just think it's a smart parking feature?
[00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.460]   - I do think you are getting at something important,
[00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.660]   which is most people have never really seen a robot
[00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.180]   and what is the car that is autonomous?
[00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:51.500]   It's a four-wheeled robot.
[00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.340]   - Right.
[00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.780]   - Yeah, it communicates a certain sort of message
[00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.060]   with everything from safety to the possibility
[00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:59.620]   of what AI could bring.
[00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.740]   It's current limitations, it's current challenges,
[00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.180]   it's what's possible.
[00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.420]   Do you feel the burden of that,
[00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.460]   almost like a communicator, educator to the world about AI?
[00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.180]   - We're just really trying to make people's lives easier
[00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.580]   with autonomy, but now that you mention it,
[00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.380]   I think it will be an eye-opener to people about robotics
[00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.580]   because they've really never seen,
[00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.740]   most people have never seen a robot
[00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.580]   and there are hundreds of thousands of Teslas,
[00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.020]   won't be long before there's a million of them,
[00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.660]   that have autonomous capability
[00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.540]   and the drive without a person in it.
[00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.300]   And you can see the kind of evolution
[00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.800]   of the car's personality and thinking
[00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.060]   with each iteration of autopilot.
[00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.100]   You can see it's uncertain about this,
[00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.100]   or it gets, but now it's more certain.
[00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.020]   Now it's moving in a slightly different way.
[00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.180]   Like I can tell immediately if a car is on Tesla autopilot
[00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.500]   'cause it's got just little nuances of movement,
[00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.940]   it just moves in a slightly different way.
[00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.300]   It's, cars on Tesla autopilot, for example,
[00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.380]   on the highway are far more precise
[00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.300]   about being in the center of the lane than a person.
[00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.980]   If you drive down the highway and look at how,
[00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:14.300]   where cars are, the human driven cars are within their lane,
[00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.260]   they're like bumper cars,
[00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.860]   they're like moving all over the place.
[00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.620]   The car in autopilot, dead center.
[00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.380]   (wind whooshing)
[00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.960]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.540]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.120]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.700]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.280]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.860]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.640]   (Thanks for watching)
