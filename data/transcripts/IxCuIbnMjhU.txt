[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.520]   - Well, it's a question we get a lot on the podcast.
[00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:11.520]   Can we distinguish between making mistakes and sinning?
[00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.160]   I don't know if we've covered it, not in this way,
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.580]   but the question comes to us in an email
[00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.920]   from an anonymous female listener who writes in to say this.
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.560]   Hello, Pastor John, what is the difference, if any,
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.120]   between my foolishness and my sin?
[00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.920]   - Well, as it turns out,
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.500]   this is a very illuminating question, was for me.
[00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.000]   It helped me see something more clearly
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.880]   than I had seen it before.
[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:40.920]   Let me make the question more precise, though.
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.480]   Instead of what's the difference, if any,
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.400]   between foolishness and sin,
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.380]   let's ask what's the difference, if any,
[00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.960]   between foolishness and sin according to the Bible?
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.520]   - Right, yes.
[00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.420]   - Otherwise, I don't know whose definition
[00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.600]   she's asking about.
[00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.040]   This is always the problem when you start arguing
[00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.760]   over foolishness or sin and you say,
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.160]   whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute.
[00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.340]   Whose meaning do you want me to use?
[00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.880]   Yours, Joe Blow's, or the Bible?
[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.640]   So I'm gonna go with the Bible here
[00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.360]   'cause I assume that's really what she's asking.
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.360]   So let me read a sampling of biblical texts
[00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.360]   about the fool or folly and then draw out some inferences
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.960]   about its relationship to sin.
[00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.220]   Mark 7, 21.
[00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.040]   "From within, out of the heart of man,
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.480]   "come evil thoughts, sexual immorality,
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:45.040]   "theft, murder, adultery, coveting,
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.280]   "wickedness, deceit, sensuality,
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.200]   "envy, slander, pride, foolishness."
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.880]   And then he continues like this.
[00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.880]   "All these evil things come from within
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.520]   "and they defile a person."
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.520]   So Jesus lists foolishness with other sins
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.400]   like sensuality, deceit, wickedness, slander, et cetera,
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.240]   and calls them evil things.
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.780]   That's a pretty strong statement to me
[00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.880]   about the relationship between foolishness and sin.
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.980]   Here's another one, Psalm 107, verse 17.
[00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.980]   "Some were fools through their sinful ways
[00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.000]   "and because of their iniquities suffered affliction."
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.180]   So sin and foolishness are linked
[00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.880]   with sin being what leads to folly.
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.680]   Here's another one, 1 Chronicles 21, 8.
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.160]   "And David said to God,
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.360]   "I have sinned greatly in the thing I have done."
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.160]   He's talking about the census that he took.
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.680]   "But now please take away the iniquity of your servant
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.340]   "for I have acted very foolishly."
[00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.180]   So sinning and acting foolishly are the same act
[00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.800]   in 1 Chronicles 21, 8.
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:10.560]   Same thing with Aaron and Moses' sister in Numbers 12, 11.
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.860]   "And Aaron said to Moses,
[00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.260]   "Oh my Lord, do not punish us
[00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.260]   "because we have done foolishly and have sinned."
[00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.520]   And Jesus says that everyone who hears these words of mine
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:28.520]   and does not do them will be like a foolish man.
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:33.040]   So in other words, disobedience is folly.
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.720]   It's like a foolish man who built his house on sand.
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.720]   So not doing Jesus' commands is what makes a man foolish.
[00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.320]   And then he tells a parable about 10 virgins.
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.600]   Five of them were foolish, five were wise.
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.160]   And the foolish were excluded from the kingdom.
[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.160]   This was not an innocent mistake.
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.620]   And then you go to the book of Proverbs.
[00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.220]   "How long, O simple ones, will you love being simple?
[00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.860]   "How long will scoffers delight in their scoffing
[00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.760]   "and fools hate knowledge?"
[00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.020]   That's what fools do, they hate knowledge.
[00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.720]   Or Proverbs 14, 8, "The wisdom of the prudent
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.380]   "is to discern his way,
[00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:19.380]   "but the folly of fools is deceiving."
[00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.960]   Or Psalm 14, 1, "The fool says in his heart,
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.560]   "There is no God."
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.300]   Or Psalm 74, 22, "Arise, O God, defend your cause.
[00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:36.300]   "Remember how the foolish scoff at you all the day."
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.060]   Okay, so that's enough for me to get some inferences here.
[00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:46.060]   So here's my inference from all that biblical picture.
[00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:52.140]   Foolishness in the Bible is always sinful.
[00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:57.660]   To act foolishly is to sin.
[00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:02.660]   And I think we can say the other way around.
[00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:07.000]   To sin is to act foolishly.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.160]   So to act foolishly is sin,
[00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.200]   and to sin is to act foolishly.
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.700]   Sin is an attitude or a thought or an action
[00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:18.060]   that dishonors God, or is the fruit of a heart
[00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.640]   that does not treasure God above all things.
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:24.280]   So sin dishonors God like that,
[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:29.280]   and folly dishonors God like that.
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.760]   But, now here's the catch, gotta think carefully now,
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:37.760]   this does not mean sin and folly or foolishness
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:42.680]   are identical, or that calling someone a sinner
[00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.980]   and calling him a fool are saying the same thing
[00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:48.740]   about the person.
[00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:53.740]   The opposite of sin is holiness or goodness or righteousness.
[00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:58.960]   But the opposite of foolishness is wisdom.
[00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:04.480]   This shows, I think, that something different
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:08.180]   is being said when we call something sin
[00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.260]   and when we call it foolishness.
[00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:16.260]   Calling it sin puts the emphasis on God belittling badness.
[00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:20.780]   Calling it foolishness puts the emphasis
[00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:24.700]   on God belittling stupidity.
[00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:28.820]   In the Bible, the word foolishness exists
[00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:33.820]   mainly to bring to light how stupid sin is.
[00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:39.060]   The full-blown sinner is not just evil, he's an idiot.
[00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:40.980]   He's irrational.
[00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:44.100]   Or to put it positively, foolishness and wisdom,
[00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:49.100]   those words are in the Bible in application to people,
[00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:52.860]   not thinking about calling God wise here,
[00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:53.920]   in application to people.
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:56.420]   Foolishness and wisdom are words in the Bible
[00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:01.060]   as an application to people to show that goodness
[00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:05.420]   and holiness and righteousness are smart,
[00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:09.420]   rational, shrewd, wise.
[00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:13.100]   Or you might say calling something sin
[00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:18.100]   means it displeases God, and calling it foolish
[00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:22.260]   means it's gonna displease you in the end.
[00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:26.780]   Sin shoots God, folly shoots yourself.
[00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:32.700]   Sin opposes God, folly opposes yourself.
[00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:39.340]   And since opposing God is suicide, all sin is foolish.
[00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:42.620]   - Wow, that's a pointed way to put it.
[00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:43.940]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:46.100]   Well, we have run right up against the weekend,
[00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:48.020]   and that means it's time for me to tell you

[00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:08.860]   You have about 27 of them to date,
[00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:11.220]   and those biographies are very popular downloads
[00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:13.260]   at desiringgod.org.
[00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260]   And of course, they're published now in what,
[00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.260]   seven volumes in a series called
[00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.620]   The Swans Are Not Silent,
[00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:22.460]   which is a series of books published by Crossway.
[00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:23.780]   And on Monday, we have a question

[00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:28.180]   What was your process?
[00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:29.580]   What was your intended purpose?
[00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:30.740]   How did you deliver them?
[00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:32.620]   Questions like that.
[00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:35.660]   And we will pick up that conversation on Monday.
[00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:36.820]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:38.100]   Thanks for listening to the podcast.
[00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:39.340]   Have a wonderful weekend.
