[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.520]   There are things which are right there in front of us which we miss.
[00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:14.400]   And I'll quote my friend Eric Weinstein in saying, "Look, Einstein carried his luggage.
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.000]   Freud carried his luggage.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.280]   Marx carried his luggage.
[00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.760]   Martha Graham carried her luggage, etc.
[00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.080]   Edison carried his luggage.
[00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.960]   All these geniuses carried their luggage.
[00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:31.760]   Not once before relatively recently did it occur to anybody to put a wheel on luggage
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.360]   and pull it.
[00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.080]   And it was right there waiting to be invented for centuries."
[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.880]   So this is Eric Weinstein.
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.280]   What do the wheels represent?
[00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.200]   Are you basically saying that there's stuff right in front of our eyes that once it just
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.160]   clicks, we put the wheels in the luggage, a lot of things will fall into place?
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.160]   Yes.
[00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.520]   That's what I do.
[00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.200]   And every day I wake up and think, "Why can't I be that guy who was walking to the airport?"
[00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:08.080]   What do you think it takes to be that guy?
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:14.000]   Because like you said, a lot of really smart people carried their luggage.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.320]   What just psychologically speaking, so Eric Weinstein is a good example of a person who
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.320]   thinks outside the box.
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.960]   Who resists almost conventional thinking.
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:32.760]   You're an example of a person who by habit, by psychology, by upbringing, I don't know,
[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.640]   but resists conventional thinking as well, just by nature.
[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.640]   Thank you, that's a compliment.
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:37.640]   That's a compliment?
[00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:38.640]   Good.
[00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.000]   So what do you think it takes to do that?
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.560]   Is that something you were just born with?
[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.800]   I doubt it.
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:53.920]   From my studying some cases, because I'm curious about that, obviously.
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.200]   And just in a more concrete way, when I started out in physics, because I started a long way
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:07.100]   from physics, so it took me a long, not a long time, but a lot of work to get to study
[00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.100]   it and get into it.
[00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.280]   So I did wonder about that.
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:17.080]   And so I read the biographies, in fact I started with the autobiography of Weinstein and Newton
[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.640]   and Galileo and all those people.
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.680]   And I think there's a couple of things.
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.280]   Some of it is luck, being in the right place at the right time.
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.840]   Some of it is stubbornness and arrogance, which can easily go wrong.
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:42.600]   And I know all of these are doorways, if you go through them slightly at the wrong speed
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:48.840]   or in the wrong angle, they're ways to fail.
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:56.280]   But if you somehow have the right luck, the right confidence or arrogance, caring, I think
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:04.840]   Einstein cared to understand nature with a ferocity and a commitment that exceeded other
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.040]   people of his time.
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:13.640]   So he asked more stubborn questions, he asked deeper questions.
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:23.720]   I think, and there's a level of ability and whether ability is born in or can be developed
[00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:29.400]   to the extent to which it can be developed, like any of these things, like musical talent.
[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.320]   You mentioned ego, what's the role of ego in that process?
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:34.320]   Confidence.
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:39.520]   Confidence, but do you, in your own life, have you found yourself walking that nice
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:46.440]   edge of too much or too little, so being overconfident and therefore leading yourself astray or not
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:52.840]   sufficiently confident to throw away the conventional thinking of whatever the theory of the day,
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.120]   of theoretical physics?
[00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:00.960]   I don't know if I, I mean, I've contributed what I've contributed, whether if I had had
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:08.080]   more confidence in something, I would have gotten further, I don't know.
[00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:18.400]   Certainly I'm sitting here at this moment with very much my own approach to nearly everything,
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.640]   and I'm calm, I'm happy about that.
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:31.040]   But on the other hand, I know people whose self-confidence vastly exceeds mine, and sometimes
[00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.200]   I think it's justified and sometimes I think it's not justified.
