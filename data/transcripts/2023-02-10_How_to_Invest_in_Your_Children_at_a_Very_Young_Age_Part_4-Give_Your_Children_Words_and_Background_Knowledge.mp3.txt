[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.400]   in your children at a young age.
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.540]   By way of review in the first episode in this series,
[00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.900]   we talked about the importance
[00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.580]   of carefully choosing your mate,
[00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.180]   because at its core, both the genetic material
[00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.480]   as well as the environment that your mate
[00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.080]   is capable of creating will dramatically affect
[00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.620]   the outcomes for your children in the long term.
[00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.680]   In episode two, we talked about the importance
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.360]   of mothers and fathers being in excellent physical health
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.060]   prior to conception, and of the importance
[00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.760]   of supporting a mother's health during the gestation
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.700]   of her baby, as well as supporting her during childbirth.
[00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.300]   And infancy, as those physical factors
[00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:00.700]   will make a dramatic difference
[00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.940]   in the long term health of your baby.
[00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.800]   In episode three, we started to talk about the ways
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.300]   that you can invest into your children in childhood,
[00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.580]   and we began by talking about investing
[00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.380]   into your children's bodies,
[00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.520]   by gaining for them the highest quality nutrition
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.260]   that you have access to, making sure that they sleep,
[00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.820]   making sure that they move a lot,
[00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.340]   making sure they get sunshine, et cetera,
[00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.360]   and anything else, and keeping their environment
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.460]   clean, and making sure that they're not exposed
[00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.260]   to any of the toxic substances that you're using.
[00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.340]   And finally, we talked about investing

[00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:48.920]   into their brain, and we talked about investing
[00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:49.920]   into their brain, and we talked about investing
[00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:50.920]   into their brain, and we talked about investing
[00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:51.920]   into their brain, and we talked about investing
[00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:52.920]   into their brain, and we talked about investing
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:56.920]   You probably had an easier time grasping paragraph one,
[00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:59.920]   a newspaper account of a baseball game in 2011.
[00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:01.920]   The second paragraph came from a newspaper story
[00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:05.920]   on the World Cricket Championship in 1999.
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:07.920]   Any confusion was because the less you know
[00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:10.920]   about a subject or the vocabulary associated
[00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:13.920]   with that subject, the slower you must read,
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:15.920]   the more difficult comprehension becomes,
[00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:18.920]   and the less you understand.
[00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:20.920]   Sounding out the cricket paragraph phonetically
[00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:22.920]   wouldn't have helped much, would it?
[00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:24.920]   By the way, the author there is referring
[00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:26.920]   to the arguments for phonics as opposed
[00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:29.920]   or as contrasted with sight word reading,
[00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:31.920]   and again, I'm in favor of phonics instruction,
[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:32.920]   but that's not everything.
[00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:34.920]   You understood, certainly, all of the words
[00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:36.920]   that are read in paragraph two,
[00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:38.920]   but just because you understood the words,
[00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:41.920]   that doesn't necessarily mean you understood the meaning.
[00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:43.920]   Background knowledge is one reason children
[00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:45.920]   who read the most bring the largest amount
[00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:47.920]   of information to the learning table
[00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:50.920]   and thus understand more of what the teacher
[00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:52.920]   or the textbook is teaching.
[00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:55.920]   Children whose families take them to museums
[00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:58.920]   and zoos, who visit historic sites,
[00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:01.920]   who travel abroad, or who camp in remote areas,
[00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:04.920]   accumulate huge chunks of background knowledge
[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:06.920]   without even studying.
[00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:09.920]   For the impoverished child lacking the travel portfolio
[00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:12.920]   of affluence, the best way to accumulate
[00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:14.920]   background knowledge is by either reading
[00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:17.920]   or being read to.
[00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:19.920]   Yes, educational TV can help,
[00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:21.920]   but most at-risk children are not exposed
[00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:23.920]   to it often enough.
[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:25.920]   The background knowledge of at-risk students
[00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:27.920]   took a further hit with No Child Left Behind
[00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:29.920]   when 71% of school districts narrowed
[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:31.920]   their curriculum to math and reading,
[00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:34.920]   curtailing subjects like art, music, science,
[00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:36.920]   and languages.
[00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:38.920]   The lack of background knowledge surfaces
[00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:40.920]   very early in a child's school life.
[00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:42.920]   In the Longitudinal Kindergarten Study,
[00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:45.920]   researchers found that more than 50% of children
[00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:48.920]   coming from the lowest education and income levels
[00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:51.920]   finished in the bottom quartile in background knowledge.
[00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:54.920]   So, once again, poverty rears its ugly head
[00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:57.920]   as an obstacle to learning.
[00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:00.920]   Thus concludes this section on background knowledge.
[00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:03.920]   So, here's the first actionable item for you.
[00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:05.920]   One of your goals as a parent,
[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:08.920]   in order to invest into your child's brain,
[00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:11.920]   is to help your child to accumulate
[00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:15.920]   broad and diverse experiences in life.
[00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:20.920]   Those experiences can be acquired first-hand
[00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:23.920]   based upon first-hand actions, right?
[00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:26.920]   Taking your child to diverse places,
[00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:28.920]   as the author said, going to museums, zoos,
[00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:30.920]   camping in the backcountry,
[00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:32.920]   traveling abroad, etc.,
[00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:34.920]   knowing diverse people, etc.
[00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:36.920]   So, they can be acquired first-hand
[00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:38.920]   or they can be acquired second-hand
[00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:41.920]   by living vicariously through the actions of others.
[00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:45.920]   And that most efficiently is acquired through reading.
[00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:48.920]   With the background knowledge that your child has,
[00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:55.920]   the exposure to life in a variety of different ways
[00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:57.920]   is going to fundamentally affect
[00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:00.920]   his ability to understand the world around him
[00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:03.920]   and to see the opportunities that exist for him.
[00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:05.920]   So, one of my goals,
[00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:09.920]   one way that I personally seek to invest into my child
[00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:13.920]   is to enhance his background knowledge
[00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:18.920]   by exposing him to a very diverse set of life experiences.
[00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:21.920]   And that happens,
[00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:24.920]   I invest quite a lot of money in first-hand knowledge
[00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:28.920]   and experience as well as in second-hand.
[00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:30.920]   And I'll elaborate this more carefully
[00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:36.920]   in a moment when we talk about reading.
[00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:38.920]   Now, let's talk for a moment about the skills
[00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:40.920]   that a child needs for kindergarten.
[00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:42.920]   The first contact that your child is going to have
[00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:45.920]   with the school system, the academic system,
[00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:46.920]   is going to be kindergarten.
[00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:49.920]   So, what are the skills that your child needs for kindergarten?
[00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:51.920]   Reading from Trulise's book again.
[00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:53.920]   Let me make an analogy here.
[00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:55.920]   Inside a child's brain, there is a huge reservoir
[00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:58.920]   called the listening vocabulary.
[00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:01.920]   You could say it's the child's very own Lake Pontchartrain,
[00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:03.920]   the famous estuary outside New Orleans
[00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:06.920]   that overflowed because of all the water brought by Hurricane Katrina.
[00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:08.920]   That extra water breached the levees
[00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:11.920]   and tragically flooded New Orleans.
[00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:14.920]   We want the same thing to happen, but not in a tragic way.
[00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:18.920]   This time, the levees will be breached inside the child's brain.
[00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:21.920]   The first levee would be the speaking vocabulary.
[00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:25.920]   You pour enough words into the child's listening vocabulary
[00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:29.920]   that it will overflow and fill the speaking vocabulary pool.
[00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:32.920]   Thus, the child starts speaking the words he's heard.
[00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:35.920]   It's highly unlikely you'll ever say a word
[00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:37.920]   if you've never heard the word.
[00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:39.920]   More than a billion people speak Chinese,
[00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:41.920]   so why not the rest of us?
[00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:43.920]   Because we haven't heard enough Chinese words,
[00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:45.920]   especially in our childhoods.
[00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:48.920]   The next levee is the reading vocabulary.
[00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:51.920]   It's nearly impossible to understand a word in print
[00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:53.920]   if you've never said the word.
[00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:55.920]   Finally, there's the writing vocabulary.
[00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:58.920]   If you've never said the word or read the word,
[00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:00.920]   how in the world will you be able to write it?
[00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:04.920]   All the language arts flow from the listening vocabulary,
[00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:09.920]   and that has to be filled by someone besides the child.
[00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:11.920]   Simple.
[00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:15.920]   As you read to a child, you're pouring into the child's ears and brain
[00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:18.920]   all the sounds, syllables, endings, and blendings
[00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:22.920]   that will make up the words she will someday be asked to read and understand.
[00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:26.920]   And through stories, you are filling in the background knowledge
[00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:30.920]   necessary to understand things that aren't in her neighborhood,
[00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:34.920]   like war or whales or locomotives.
[00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:39.920]   The one pre-kindergarten skill that matters above all others,
[00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:46.920]   because it is the prime predictor of school success or failure,
[00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:53.920]   is the child's vocabulary upon entering school.
[00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:57.920]   I don't wish to be pedantic, but I do wish to emphasize this
[00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:01.920]   and burn this into your brain, so please allow me to repeat.
[00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:08.920]   The one pre-kindergarten skill that matters above all others,
[00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:14.920]   because it is the prime predictor of school success or failure,
[00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:20.920]   is the child's vocabulary upon entering school.
[00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:23.920]   Yes, the child goes to school to learn new words,
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:26.920]   but the words he already knows determine how much of what the teacher says
[00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:28.920]   will be understood.
[00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:33.920]   And since most instruction for the first four years of school is oral,
[00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:37.920]   the child who has the largest vocabulary will understand the most,
[00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:42.920]   while the child with the smallest vocabulary will grasp the least.
[00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:48.920]   Once reading begins, personal vocabulary feeds, or frustrates, comprehension,
[00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:53.920]   since school grows increasingly complicated with each grade.
[00:20:53.920 --> 00:21:00.920]   That's why school entry vocabulary tests predict so accurately.
[00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:03.920]   Now, back to the metrics.
[00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:06.920]   We want to expose our children to lots of background knowledge,
[00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:15.920]   and we want to make sure that our children's vocabulary is as expansive as possible,
[00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:19.920]   because this is the single most important metric
[00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:24.920]   that will drive our children's academic success.
[00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:28.920]   If we know that the metric that will drive our child's academic success is vocabulary,
[00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:31.920]   then the way that we can invest into our children,
[00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:34.920]   especially at a very young age, prior to school,
[00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:40.920]   is by increasing their vocabulary to the highest and greatest extent possible.
[00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:43.920]   We'll talk about how to do that in a moment.
[00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:47.920]   But I want to emphasize why this is.
[00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:51.920]   Allow me a short but meaningful divergence here.
[00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:53.920]   When we talk about educational models,
[00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:59.920]   there is a model called the classical model of education.
[00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:01.920]   That means different things to different people.
[00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:03.920]   It's actually quite difficult to define.
[00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:09.920]   But if we're going to agree on a definition of classical education in the modern age,
[00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:16.920]   most likely we're going to at least agree on the importance of what is called the trivium.
[00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:21.920]   Now, as I say that word, your vocabulary will immediately fill in.
[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:25.920]   If I say the trivium, and you know what that means, then you know where I'm going.
[00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:28.920]   But if you're not familiar with that word, you don't know what the trivium is.
[00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:33.920]   Allow me to explain, because I'm making a meta point and an actual point.
[00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:38.920]   The trivium was the classical model of education,
[00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:42.920]   where you began with grammar, that's part one of the trivium.
[00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:46.920]   Then you continued with logic, studying logic.
[00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:49.920]   And then the third thing was to study rhetoric.
[00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:51.920]   Grammar, logic, and rhetoric.
[00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:55.920]   And then later they followed up with the quadrivium, which were four other subjects.
[00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:58.920]   But to the extent that the classical model incorporated subjects,
[00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:02.920]   these were they, the trivium, grammar, logic, and rhetoric.
[00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:05.920]   Now, the way that classical educators apply this is to say that
[00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:08.920]   in order for you to understand a subject,
[00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:12.920]   you need to begin by understanding the basic concepts,
[00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:16.920]   even the very words of a subject, the grammar of the subject.
[00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:19.920]   And then after you understand the words of the subject,
[00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:22.920]   you can move on to the logic of the subject.
[00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:26.920]   And here, what we mean by this word logic is arguing the arguments,
[00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:31.920]   the hypotheses, the conjectures in a subject.
[00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:35.920]   And then we move on to rhetoric, where you may be qualified then
[00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:40.920]   to actually present new ideas or to effectively and persuasively argue
[00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:43.920]   for the positions that you believe are correct.
[00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:47.920]   Now, the reason that the trivium matters is because
[00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:50.920]   this is how all subjects are learned.
[00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:53.920]   If you're going to learn a subject, you need to begin with understanding
[00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:58.920]   the grammar of the subject, the simplest, most basic elements of that subject,
[00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:00.920]   the words that are involved, etc.
[00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:04.920]   So in finance, there is a basic grammar of finance,
[00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:07.920]   words like interest or compound interest.
[00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:10.920]   When I speak them to you, I assume that you know them,
[00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:13.920]   but your kindergartner can't define them.
[00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:15.920]   In order for you to be competent in the field of finance,
[00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:20.920]   you have to begin with understanding the basic grammar.
[00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:24.920]   Again, things like interest or dividends, compound interest.
[00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:26.920]   And then you move on to more specialized grammar,
[00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:29.920]   such as retirement accounts or tax-deferred accounts
[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:31.920]   or what we call qualified accounts, etc.
[00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:34.920]   Roth IRAs, 401(k)s, IRAs.
[00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:36.920]   All of these words have meanings.
[00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:38.920]   In order for you to be successful in understanding
[00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:40.920]   how to manage your financial affairs,
[00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:43.920]   you have to learn these words and their meanings.
[00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:48.920]   The higher you go in a subject, the more words matter.
[00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:52.920]   So a straightforward example is that when I use a term
[00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:57.920]   "qualified account" as a professional financial planner,
[00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:00.920]   I'm referring to something very specific.
[00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:04.920]   I'm specifically referring to the types of tax-deferred retirement accounts
[00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:09.920]   that were authorized under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:11.920]   of what was it? I forget the year of it.
[00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:15.920]   Now I'm getting old and losing my data.
[00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:16.920]   ERISA is what it's commonly called, right?
[00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:18.920]   The Employee Retirement Income Security Act.
[00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:23.920]   And a qualified account is different than a non-qualified account.
[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:27.920]   And for a financial planner, this is exceedingly important
[00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:31.920]   as a distinction because the rules for qualified accounts
[00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:33.920]   and the specific attributes of qualified accounts
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:36.920]   are very different than the rules of non-qualified accounts
[00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:39.920]   and the attributes of non-qualified accounts.
[00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:42.920]   So when I'm doing, say, asset protection planning,
[00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:45.920]   the distinction between an account that is a qualified account
[00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:48.920]   and a non-qualified account is the distinction between
[00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:50.920]   you're keeping your money when you go bankrupt
[00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:53.920]   versus not keeping your money when you go bankrupt.
[00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:56.920]   Similarly, the distinction between a qualified retirement program
[00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:59.920]   and a non-qualified retirement program is the difference
[00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:04.920]   between you being able to put $50,000 a year in,
[00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:06.920]   as long as you're matching your employees' contributions,
[00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:09.920]   and the difference between you being able to put $5 million a year in.
[00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:12.920]   They're meaningful differences.
[00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:15.920]   But these words, such as qualified and non-qualified,
[00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:19.920]   only have sense or meaning in a specific context.
[00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:22.920]   And as a financial planner, you begin the process
[00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:26.920]   of learning the vocabulary of financial planning.
[00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:30.920]   Then you proceed forward by understanding the deeper meanings,
[00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:32.920]   the logic and the grammar, etc.
[00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:35.920]   And then at your highest and best stage, you're arguing on the Internet
[00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:38.920]   about whether somebody should fund his Roth IRA
[00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:43.920]   or his Roth 401(k) or his traditional 401(k).
[00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:45.920]   And that's where you're engaging in rhetoric
[00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:48.920]   based upon the logical arguments, but you have to understand the grammar for.
[00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:52.920]   So this concept of the trivium is a very useful model for learning.
[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:56.920]   Let's go back to your elementary age or kindergarten student.
[00:26:56.920 --> 00:27:00.920]   If a kindergarten student comes in with a very large vocabulary
[00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:04.920]   and that kindergarten student is being exposed to a new subject,
[00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:10.920]   and he understands perhaps 90% of the words that the teacher is saying,
[00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:14.920]   then because he understands the words that the teacher is saying,
[00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:18.920]   he will have a much easier time grasping the new concepts
[00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:20.920]   that are being taught by the teacher.
[00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:23.920]   The important thing that he's going to be tested on is not the words,
[00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:26.920]   but the concepts, the meaning, the specific facts.
[00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:30.920]   But in order to understand those facts, he needs to understand the words.
[00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:34.920]   If the child understands only 60% of the words the teacher is saying,
[00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:39.920]   he's going to have a vastly more difficult time grasping the concepts
[00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:41.920]   on which he will be tested.
[00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:46.920]   And so vocabulary is the metric that we need to measure
[00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:53.920]   in order to know that our children have the highest possible chance
[00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:59.920]   of becoming excellent students as measured by academic ability.
[00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:00.920]   Moving on.
[00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:06.920]   How is it then that some kids get a head start on vocabulary?

[00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:42.920]   Conversation is the prime garden in which vocabulary grows,
[00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:45.920]   but conversations vary greatly from home to home.
[00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:50.920]   The eye-opening findings of Drs. Betty Hart and Todd Risley at the University of Kansas
[00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:55.920]   from their research on children's early lives demonstrate the impact of this fact.
[00:28:55.920 --> 00:29:00.920]   Published as "Meaningful Differences in the Everyday Experience of Young American Children,"
[00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:06.920]   the research began in response to what Hart and Risley saw among the 4-year-olds in the university lab school.
[00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:09.920]   With many children, the lines were already drawn.
[00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:13.920]   Some were far advanced and some far behind.
[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:19.920]   When the children in the study were tested at age 3 and then again at 9, the differences held.
[00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:22.920]   What caused the differences so early?
[00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:28.920]   The researchers began by identifying 42 normal families representing three socioeconomic groups
[00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:31.920]   – welfare, working class, and professional.
[00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:36.920]   Beginning when the children were 7 months old, researchers visited the homes for one hour a month
[00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:39.920]   and continued their visits for two and a half years.
[00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:44.920]   During each visit, the researcher tape-recorded and transcribed by hand
[00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:48.920]   any conversations and actions taking place in front of the child.
[00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:55.920]   Through 1,300 hours of visits, they accumulated 23 million bytes of information for the project database,
[00:29:55.920 --> 00:30:00.920]   categorizing every word (noun, verb, adjective, etc.) uttered in front of the child.
[00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:02.920]   The project held some surprises.
[00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:08.920]   Regardless of socioeconomic level, all 42 families said and did the same things with their children.
[00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:14.920]   In other words, the basic instincts of good parenting are there for most people, rich or poor.
[00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:20.920]   Then the researchers received the data printout and saw the "meaningful differences" among the 42 families.
[00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:26.920]   When the daily number of words for each group of children is projected across four years,
[00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:32.920]   the 4-year-old child from the professional family will have heard 45 million words,
[00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:38.920]   the working class child 26 million, and the welfare child only 13 million.
[00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:42.920]   All three children will show up for kindergarten on the same day,
[00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:47.920]   but one will have heard 32 million fewer words.
[00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:50.920]   If legislators expect the teacher to get this child caught up,
[00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:56.920]   she'll have to speak 10 words a second for 900 hours to reach the 32 million mark by year's end.
[00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:58.920]   Hope they have life support ready for her.
[00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:04.920]   Those 42 children would perform differently in class because their word totals created different brains.
[00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:07.920]   By the time the study group reached age 3,
[00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:14.920]   the professionals' children had 1,100 word vocabularies, to the welfare children's 525.
[00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:20.920]   Similarly, their IQs were 117 vs. 79 by the time the study finished.
[00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:24.920]   Brain differences have nothing to do with how much parents love their children.
[00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:26.920]   They all love their children and want the best for them,
[00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:32.920]   but some parents have a better idea of what needs to be said and done to reach that "best."
[00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:37.920]   They know the child needs to hear words repeatedly and meaningful sentences and questions,
[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:42.920]   and they know that plunking a 2-year-old down in front of a television set for 3 hours at a time
[00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:45.920]   is more harmful than meaningful.
[00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:52.920]   Sociologists George Farkas and Kurt Barron studied the research on 6,800 children from ages 3 to 12
[00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:55.920]   and found that children from the lower socioeconomic spectrum
[00:31:55.920 --> 00:32:02.920]   were far more likely to arrive at school with smaller vocabularies 12-14 months behind,
[00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:07.920]   and they seldom made up the loss as they grew older.
[00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:12.920]   The message in this kind of research is unambiguous.
[00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:16.920]   It's not the toys in the house that make the difference in the children's lives.
[00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:18.920]   It's the words in their heads.
[00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:24.920]   The least expensive thing we can give a child outside of a hug turns out to be the most valuable.
[00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:25.920]   Words.
[00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:31.920]   You don't need a job, a checking account, or even a high school diploma to talk with a child.
[00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:34.920]   If I could select any piece of research that all parents would be exposed to,
[00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:38.920]   meaningful differences would be the one, and that's feasible.
[00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:43.920]   The authors took their 268-page book and condensed it into a 6-page article for American Educator,
[00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:48.920]   the Journal of the American Federation of Teachers, which may be freely reproduced by schools.
[00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:53.920]   There is one inexpensive, common-sense move that parents could make
[00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:57.920]   that would impact their children's language skills, and maybe their emotional development as well.
[00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:01.920]   Yet it goes largely unpublicized here in the United States.
[00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:04.920]   First, consider how badly it would affect a conversation with someone
[00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:07.920]   if she wouldn't look at you while you were talking to her.
[00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:09.920]   Most conversations would slow to a crawl.
[00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:13.920]   Let's apply that principle of human behavior to children in strollers.
[00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:18.920]   Until the 1960s, nearly all strollers were engineered so the child was facing the parent.
[00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:22.920]   Now, it's either way, but far more often facing away.
[00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:23.920]   Does it make a difference?
[00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:29.920]   Researchers found it makes a huge difference in how much conversation takes place between parent and child.
[00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:32.920]   Twice as much when the child faces the parent.
[00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:36.920]   It was even more frequent when the child walked with or was carried by the parent.
[00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:40.920]   Of course, it's not going to help that much if the child is facing the parent
[00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:43.920]   and the parent is on the cell phone all the time.
[00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:48.920]   So, what can you invest in in order to help your children grow?
[00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:52.920]   Well, the first actionable thing is we want to invest in words.
[00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:58.920]   We want to make sure that our children are spoken to constantly and continually.
[00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:02.920]   Conversations filled with love, filled with appreciation, filled with context,
[00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:04.920]   because that's how we learn words.
[00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:06.920]   We learn words by context.
[00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:10.920]   And you want to make sure that your children, during practically all of their waking hours,
[00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:12.920]   are being spoken to.
[00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:16.920]   And you want to measure, to the extent possible, the number of words.
[00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:20.920]   So, I love this as a beginning place to start.
[00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:24.920]   If you have a baby and you have a stroller that causes your baby to look away from you,
[00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:27.920]   go buy a new stroller and get one where your baby is facing you.
[00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:30.920]   And then take your baby on a stroller and get used to talking to your baby.
[00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:33.920]   And just narrate all of the things that are going on.
[00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:37.920]   I find this difficult to do sometimes with a newborn, even though I try.
[00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:42.920]   But as soon as your child starts to get to that point where he starts to respond to you
[00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:46.920]   and you can tell he is listening--of course, newborns are hearing your voice,
[00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:48.920]   but they're not putting things together--
[00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:54.920]   then I try to apply this principle by talking to my children incessantly.
[00:34:54.920 --> 00:35:01.920]   And I use the best vocabulary that I can, and I repeat it consistently.
[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:05.920]   I'm not opposed to baby talk, but I don't use much of it myself.
[00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:10.920]   It's never felt natural for me, so I just use my words in all their contexts.
[00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:13.920]   But I make up ways to fill in vocabulary.
[00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:17.920]   So, for example, when I'm changing a baby's diaper and I'm touching his body parts,
[00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:20.920]   I say, "Look, here's your right foot. I touch the right foot.
[00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:22.920]   This is your left foot. This is your left foot."
[00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:28.920]   And then as you're putting his feet into his jammy legs--you say, "Right leg, left leg.
[00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:31.920]   Right knee, left knee. Touch him. This is your tummy."
[00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:34.920]   And you give him all his body part names, etc. as you go through everything.
[00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:37.920]   You explain what you're doing. So you give vocabulary.
[00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:39.920]   "I'm changing your diaper. I'm going to wipe your bottom.
[00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:42.920]   I'm going to take you out and I'm going to give you to mommy,
[00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:44.920]   or we're going to go for a walk, etc."
[00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:47.920]   As you're going down a walk, "Hey, look over there. There's a green house."
[00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:49.920]   Or whatever it is that you have. You get the point.
[00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:52.920]   The point is, engage with your children and talk to them.
[00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:54.920]   Now, the stroller, I think, is a great idea.
[00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:58.920]   But for most of us, it's not something that we need to go and buy.
[00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:01.920]   Rather, it's something that we need to avoid.
[00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:04.920]   And that is, of course, our phones.
[00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:11.920]   Our phones are the most destructive influence in our relationship with our children.
[00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:14.920]   And it is affecting all of us.
[00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:19.920]   If you go out in any of our modern society, and you go out to eat, etc.,
[00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:24.920]   you will see what I consider to be one of the greatest, most horrific sights ever,
[00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:28.920]   which is children with their faces glued to screens.
[00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:33.920]   A child with his face glued to a screen out at a restaurant
[00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:41.920]   is a child who is simultaneously not listening and not speaking to a parent.
[00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:48.920]   And that's a child who is losing prime opportunities to acquire background knowledge on the world around,
[00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:54.920]   to acquire understanding of how he's going to act as a parent.
[00:36:54.920 --> 00:37:00.920]   Instruction, both positive and negative, meaning hearing stories of inspiring virtuous characters
[00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:03.920]   and people who have failed, etc.
[00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:07.920]   And just being in context. And the child is losing opportunities to speak.
[00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:10.920]   The child is absorbed in a drug, is being drugged.
[00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:13.920]   And that extends also. And why does the child do that?
[00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:16.920]   Well, because that's the example that we set as parents.
[00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:20.920]   We have our eyes glued to the screen, and that's the example we set.
[00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:22.920]   And so our children are following our example.
[00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:24.920]   And it is utterly destructive.
[00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:30.920]   It is destroying children's capacities to learn because, as we'll talk about in a moment,
[00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:34.920]   they're cut off from the most important words.
[00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:38.920]   I don't care how educational the app is.
[00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:44.920]   An app is never going to give your child the necessary background knowledge to make words make sense.
[00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:47.920]   And it's not going to give your child adult words.
[00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:51.920]   So what if your child can spell "cat"?
[00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:57.920]   It's far more important that your child has the context for who cats are and what cats are
[00:37:57.920 --> 00:38:04.920]   in all of their different senses and meanings, rather than being able to simply spell "cat."
[00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:12.920]   Permit me another literary divergence to give you a story that I hope will burn this into your head.
[00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:21.920]   And here is the point. Your child does not need simple facts, which is what apps seek to give your child.
[00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:24.920]   Your child needs experience.
[00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:31.920]   I want to read an excerpt from a world-class book by Professor Anthony Esalen called
[00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:35.920]   "Ten Ways to Destroy the Imagination of Your Child."
[00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:42.920]   As I begin, I hope it's immediately evident by the title itself, but I just do want to emphasize that this is satire.
[00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:49.920]   So what you should understand is that this entire book is written in the voice of somebody who is saying
[00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:55.920]   the exact opposite of what you and I actually want. So just be clear on that.
[00:38:55.920 --> 00:39:03.920]   Reading from a chapter called "Why Truth is Your Enemy and the Benefits of the Vague," or "Gradgrind Without the Facts."
[00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:08.920]   Now, what I want is facts. Teach these boys and girls nothing but facts.
[00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:13.920]   Facts alone are wanted in life. Plant nothing else and root out everything else.
[00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:19.920]   You can only form the minds of reasoning animals upon facts. Nothing else will ever be of any service to them.
[00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:25.920]   This is the principle on which I bring up my own children, and this is the principle on which I bring up these children.
[00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:28.920]   Stick to facts, sir.
[00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:32.920]   The Opening of Hard Times by Charles Dickens.
[00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:39.920]   Those are the words of the schoolmaster Thomas Gradgrind, whose philosophy of education is meant to reflect
[00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:45.920]   the smog-ridden industrial desert of Coke Town, where his enlightened school is located.
[00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:54.920]   If what you want is industrial production, cheap and plentiful, and if human beings are to be cogs and gears in the industrial machine,
[00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:58.920]   then of course you will want to stick to flat, unimaginative facts.
[00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:07.920]   A cog should not go soft, musing about the clouds and the sky. A gear should never wonder what it would feel like to turn backwards.
[00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:11.920]   It's easy for us to laugh at the naivete of Mr. Gradgrind.
[00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:16.920]   We ingrates who have inherited all the benefits of the revolutionary system that he represents.
[00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:21.920]   We forget that what was called empiricism in education, sticking to facts, sir,
[00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:28.920]   and avoiding the training of the moral imagination in virtues that can't be isolated in a glass dish or oxidized in a Bunsen burner,
[00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:32.920]   was locked in a mighty struggle with the older tradition of the liberal arts,
[00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:36.920]   introducing students to the best that has been thought, done, and written in the world,
[00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:44.920]   and sometimes, quite by accident, indulging dangerous flights of fancy, with every book like Aladdin's carpet ready to whisk us away.
[00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:52.920]   The popular form of such an education was what young David Copperfield had, locked up in his room by his cold-hearted stepfather.
[00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:57.920]   My father had left a small collection of books in a little room upstairs to which I had access,
[00:40:57.920 --> 00:41:02.920]   for it adjoined my own, and which nobody else in our house ever troubled.
[00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:08.920]   From that blessed little room, Roderick Random, Peregrine Pickle, Humphrey Klinker, Tom Jones,
[00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:16.920]   the vicar of Wakefield, Don Quixote, Jill Bloss, and Robinson Crusoe came out, a glorious host to keep me company.
[00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:22.920]   They kept alive my fancy and my hope of something beyond that place and time.
[00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:31.920]   I pick up McGuffey's Fourth Eclectic Reader, 1837, and find to our shame that along with precise rules of grammar and elocution,
[00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:37.920]   students are expected to expand what was once quaintly called "their souls," contemplating, for example,
[00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:41.920]   the meaning of those places where their forefathers fought to secure their liberty.
[00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:48.920]   "No American," writes Daniel Webster, "can pass by the fields of Bunker Hill, Monmouth, or Camden,
[00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:51.920]   as if they were ordinary spots on the earth's surface.
[00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:56.920]   Whoever visits them feels the sentiment of love of country kindling anew,
[00:41:56.920 --> 00:42:01.920]   as if the spirit that belonged to the transactions which have rendered these places distinguished
[00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:08.920]   still hovered around, with power to move and excite all who in future time may approach them."
[00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:17.920]   The same short selection ushers on stage in a single sentence the beauties of Homer, Milton, Cicero, Raphael, and Michelangelo.
[00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:21.920]   It is, alas, no isolated lapse into imagination.
[00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:28.920]   Students elsewhere in the book are transported to the Himalayas, the ruins of Babylon, Westminster Abbey,
[00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:33.920]   the volcano of Etna, the gates of Hell, and more dreadful even than those,
[00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:39.920]   the whirlwind out of which God spoke to Job, commanding him to consider the glory of the creation about him.
[00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:44.920]   "Hast thou given the horse strength? Hast thou clothed his neck with thunder?"
[00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:48.920]   That one image would be sufficient to quicken a dying imagination.
[00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:52.920]   Undoing months of hard and programmatic labor.
[00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:58.920]   So we ought to be grateful to the old grad grinds, without whom the first stage of modern education,
[00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:05.920]   with its demotion of a sense of beauty to an irrational and private feeling, would have been impossible.
[00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:10.920]   In C.S. Lewis's Voyage of the Dawn Treader, a boy named Eustace Clarence Scrub,
[00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:16.920]   brought up in a modern gradgrindian school, bumbles into a cave with treasure in it
[00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:20.920]   and makes the terrible mistake of putting a golden bracelet on his arm.
[00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:25.920]   "He did this," says Lewis, "because in his school all the boys and girls ever read about
[00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:29.920]   were factories and electrical output and population density and such like."
[00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:32.920]   "Eustace didn't read the right sort of books," says Lewis,
[00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:37.920]   "so he never did know what to do in case of dragons and other sorts of eminently practical things like that."
[00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:42.920]   This, of course, is the same C.S. Lewis who, in The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe,
[00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:47.920]   has four children enter into another universe by stepping into a clothes dresser,
[00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:52.920]   when, as everybody should know, a wardrobe is for hanging clothes in, and that is that.
[00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:57.920]   So, if we want to kill the imagination, and we do want to do that,
[00:43:57.920 --> 00:44:02.920]   the gradgrind method of sticking to the facts is not a bad way to begin.
[00:44:02.920 --> 00:44:07.920]   Consider what it would be like to have row upon row of students seated at their geography lesson
[00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:12.920]   while the rain drips down the gutter from outside the windows, hear their voices in unison,
[00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:15.920]   droning on without inspiration or joy.
[00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:22.920]   The Arkansas River is 1,469 miles long. It is the sixth longest river in the United States.
[00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:26.920]   Its source is in Colorado. It empties into the Mississippi River.
[00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:31.920]   It flows through Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas. It is irrigated for farms.
[00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:38.920]   The Rio Grande River is 1,885 miles long. It is the third longest river, and so on,
[00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:41.920]   until death, or the bell, whichever comes first.
[00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:46.920]   But there are problems with the gradgrind method. Let's see what they are.

[00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:32.920]   Now, dear listener, please pay careful attention to this next section and think about educational apps and their benefits as I read this section.
[00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:35.920]   A horse is a horse, of course, of course.
[00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:44.920]   Early in the novel Hard Times, Mr. Gradgrind, in his arrogance, makes the mistake of taking into his school a girl named Sissy.
[00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:51.920]   Gradgrind insists upon calling her Cecilia, whose father wants her to get a better education than he can give her himself.
[00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:58.920]   The father works as a horse breaker for a traveling circus, and so Sissy has lived all her life among tightrope walkers,
[00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:05.920]   magicians, fire eaters, lady acrobats, elephants, midgets, and such like. Hardly a promising upbringing.
[00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:12.920]   For the trouble with Sissy, other than that she has a keenly developed sense of good and evil and a lively imagination,
[00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:19.920]   is that she actually does know some facts. And that proves to be a dangerous thing.
[00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:25.920]   "Give me," says Gradgrind for the benefit of Sissy and the whole class, "your definition of a horse."
[00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:28.920]   Sissy, alarmed, can say nothing.
[00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:35.920]   "Girl number 20, unable to define a horse," said Mr. Gradgrind for the general behoof of all the little pitchers.
[00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:40.920]   "Girl number 20, possessed of no facts in relation to one of the commonest of animals.
[00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:44.920]   Some boy's definition of a horse? Bitzer, yours!"
[00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:50.920]   Whereupon Bitzer, a pale and gloomy boy, with the habit of knuckling his forehead when he is not speaking,
[00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:57.920]   the pride of the Gradgrind system, replies, "Quadruped, greminivorous, 40 teeth, namely 24 grinders,
[00:46:57.920 --> 00:47:02.920]   four eye teeth and 12 incisors, sheds coat in the spring, in marshy countries sheds hoofs too.
[00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:09.920]   Hoofs hard but requiring to be shod with iron, age known by marks in mouth. Thus and much more, Bitzer."
[00:47:09.920 --> 00:47:16.920]   "Now, girl number 20," said Mr. Gradgrind, "you know what a horse is."
[00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:21.920]   The irony is that Sissy knows more about horses than anybody in the classroom,
[00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:28.920]   certainly more than Bitzer, who is merely repeating phrases poured into him like concrete into a form.
[00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:34.920]   She has ridden upon horses, seen them give birth, combed them and curried them,
[00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:38.920]   and watched as her father sabbed their sores or rubbed them with liniment.
[00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:42.920]   She knows them in a way that only life with them reveals.
[00:47:42.920 --> 00:47:48.920]   At the end of the novel, indeed, Mr. Gradgrind's spoiled son, Tom, will be spirited away from the clutches of the law,
[00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:53.920]   riding a horse provided for him by the circus people and disguised as a clown.
[00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:59.920]   Then there will be no patter about the horse being greminivorous and shedding its coat in the spring.
[00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:03.920]   And yet, Bitzer is in possession of some facts about horses.
[00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:06.920]   He knows that they have 12 incisors.
[00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:10.920]   What's an incisor? Why should a horse have those if he eats only grass?
[00:48:10.920 --> 00:48:16.920]   Will he eat anything besides grass? Anything that an incisor might help him bite and crush?
[00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:20.920]   For instance, how does a horse eat a carrot or an apple?
[00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:24.920]   Bitzer knows that horses shed their winter coats. How do they do that?
[00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:30.920]   Do the coats come off in patches? Do the horses rub up against rough trees or rocks to peel them away?
[00:48:30.920 --> 00:48:32.920]   What does the new coat look like?
[00:48:32.920 --> 00:48:36.920]   Bitzer knows that you can tell how old a horse is by looking in its mouth.
[00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:41.920]   What would you be looking for there? Do the teeth grow long? Do they change color?
[00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:46.920]   Do the gums turn dark? Can you learn the age of other animals in the same way?
[00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:49.920]   The judicious reader will see the problem.
[00:48:49.920 --> 00:48:55.920]   A fact, by itself, does not seem to rouse the imagination.
[00:48:55.920 --> 00:48:57.920]   It merely is.
[00:48:57.920 --> 00:49:02.920]   It sits there like a rock. Yet, its apparent impenetrability is a challenge to the mind.
[00:49:02.920 --> 00:49:06.920]   The Arkansas River is 1,469 miles long.
[00:49:06.920 --> 00:49:08.920]   How wide is it when it reaches the Mississippi?
[00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:10.920]   Can you sail a boat upriver?
[00:49:10.920 --> 00:49:15.920]   How far can you go? Is it a clear and fast river or sluggish and muddy?
[00:49:15.920 --> 00:49:20.920]   If water from the river is used for farming, does that mean that it has been dammed up here and there?
[00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:23.920]   If it has been, are there big man-made lakes along its course?
[00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:25.920]   Can you swim in those lakes?
[00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:29.920]   Now, of course, it is better that the student learn facts about the Arkansas River
[00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:34.920]   than wander about the streams of Mount Helicon, where the muses of Greek mythology danced and sang.
[00:49:34.920 --> 00:49:38.920]   It is better that they should learn that Mount McKinley is the highest peak in North America
[00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:42.920]   than that they should trudge along with Frodo to Mount Doom in the heart of Mordor.
[00:49:42.920 --> 00:49:46.920]   It is better that they should learn that there are twelve tones in the Western musical scale
[00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:49.920]   than that they should listen to a wood thrush singing from the thickets,
[00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:52.920]   trilling out his ethereal notes that have no name.
[00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:58.920]   But it would be better still if they had never heard of the Arkansas River or Mount McKinley or the twelve-tone scale.
[00:49:58.920 --> 00:50:02.920]   Such heights of ignorance could never be attained in Mr. Gradgrind's time,
[00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:05.920]   for the simple reason that in the middle of an industrial revolution,
[00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:08.920]   you actually have to know some things to get some jobs done,
[00:50:08.920 --> 00:50:12.920]   and those jobs were often complicated, requiring a great deal of ingenuity.
[00:50:12.920 --> 00:50:15.920]   Suppose for you a tree is nothing but a source for lumber.
[00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:17.920]   That's fine. You're well on your way.
[00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:21.920]   But in Gradgrind's day, you would then have to know about sawmills,
[00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:25.920]   and that would require, in turn, a pretty precise knowledge of water power
[00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:29.920]   and how to use wheels, belts, and gears to turn the rotary motion of a wheel
[00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:32.920]   into just the right back-and-forth motion of the saw,
[00:50:32.920 --> 00:50:36.920]   complete with couplers to disengage the mechanism from the source of power.
[00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:43.920]   In other words, a sawmill, while not the forest of Arden, is in its own right a fascinating place.
[00:50:43.920 --> 00:50:49.920]   A great deal of that fascination can be found in William Stout's "The Boy's Book of Mechanical Models" (1917),
[00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:53.920]   now available in reprint, and doubly dangerous to the young mind,
[00:50:53.920 --> 00:50:57.920]   in that it encourages both the direct experience of mechanical forces
[00:50:57.920 --> 00:51:00.920]   and the spirit of irresponsible play.
[00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:06.920]   Thus, Stout describes seeing a "wonderful electric writing telegraph" at the St. Louis World's Fair.
[00:51:06.920 --> 00:51:10.920]   Here, a man sat at a desk with a pencil and wrote and drew pictures,
[00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:13.920]   while above him, on another piece of paper in a separate machine,
[00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:17.920]   a pencil guided itself in the same manner and drew the same lines.
[00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:21.920]   It was very interesting, especially when one thought of writing from one city to another,
[00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:23.920]   as can be done with this machine.
[00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:28.920]   So Stout, while yet a boy (such was the state of unsupervised youth in his day),
[00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:31.920]   went home to devise a way to copy the machine in miniature.
[00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:34.920]   His scheme takes into account all kinds of facts.
[00:51:34.920 --> 00:51:38.920]   First, there is what I'd call the "grammar" of the teleautograph,
[00:51:38.920 --> 00:51:41.920]   the structure that directs its motions to the desired goal.
[00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:46.920]   Then, there are the parts themselves, and knowing by experience what sorts of work they can do.
[00:51:46.920 --> 00:51:50.920]   Then, there's the material for the parts, wood, rubber, and metal.
[00:51:50.920 --> 00:51:56.920]   Of course, Stout's machine is far too complicated an apparatus for our current schools, I'm proud to say,
[00:51:56.920 --> 00:52:00.920]   let alone for a boy rummaging about his basement with spare wood and a toolbox.
[00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:05.920]   But Stout assumes that his readers will grasp the principles involved without much trouble.
[00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:12.920]   "You can see from this how," he says, "if you swing the pencil sideways so as to move this lever about its pivot, S,
[00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:18.920]   that the pencil at the other end will slide sideways back and forth in exactly the same way as you move the first pencil.
[00:52:18.920 --> 00:52:22.920]   That's just one motion. A linked mechanism transmits the up and down motion,
[00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:26.920]   and the whole machine, therefore, will transmit any kind of motion of the pencil at all."
[00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:31.920]   "Well," says my reader, nervously looking over his shoulder as his son transforms a ruler,
[00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:34.920]   a spool, and an ice cube into Lord Winter's catapult,
[00:52:34.920 --> 00:52:37.920]   "that may be the case for mechanical or physical facts,
[00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:42.920]   but surely it is safe to drum young heads with historical trivia as dry as dust.
[00:52:42.920 --> 00:52:48.920]   If their minds are going to be as flat as Oklahoma, they should be as dry and dusty as Oklahoma too."
[00:52:48.920 --> 00:52:53.920]   True enough, and many an imagination has been flattened by such an approach.
[00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:57.920]   Yet beware, historical facts can be dangerous too.
[00:52:57.920 --> 00:53:00.920]   Webster could not have touched the imaginations of his audience, after all,
[00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:04.920]   if they had not known what Bunker Hill and Camden were.
[00:53:04.920 --> 00:53:07.920]   Let's take a few examples. What could be duller, you say,
[00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:10.920]   than to memorize the dates of the various presidents of the United States?
[00:53:10.920 --> 00:53:19.920]   Not much. So the student properly instructed may learn that Franklin Pierce was president from 1853 to 1857.
[00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:24.920]   If the facts stopped there, that would be fine. But they might not stop there.
[00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:29.920]   He might learn that Pierce was an unpopular president, another fact, and this one more mysterious.
[00:53:29.920 --> 00:53:34.920]   He might read somewhere that Pierce's son died just before his father took office.
[00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:38.920]   He might hear that a great author named Nathaniel Hawthorne was a close friend of Pierce.
[00:53:38.920 --> 00:53:42.920]   And all at once a picture of a tragic man emerges in the mist,
[00:53:42.920 --> 00:53:46.920]   one who might have done well had times been better.
[00:53:46.920 --> 00:53:50.920]   If the student then remembers that the Civil War began in 1861,
[00:53:50.920 --> 00:53:54.920]   and that Pierce was a Democrat while Lincoln was a Whig and then a Republican,
[00:53:54.920 --> 00:53:58.920]   the mystery deepens and questions begin to stir in the sleepy mind.
[00:53:58.920 --> 00:54:03.920]   What was it like to have been that man, watching the war that he did not prevent,
[00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:07.920]   with the Union armies commanded by his political enemy?
[00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:11.920]   Or consider this piece of apparently harmless trivia.
[00:54:11.920 --> 00:54:14.920]   The Normans conquered Sicily in the 11th century.
[00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:18.920]   Ah, who cares about that? Nobody.
[00:54:18.920 --> 00:54:24.920]   So long as you have not made the mistake of introducing your student to geographical facts to boot.
[00:54:24.920 --> 00:54:29.920]   For if he knows where Normandy and Sicily are on the globe, he may ask the obvious question.
[00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:34.920]   How did the Normans get down there? Did they go overland or did they sail?
[00:54:34.920 --> 00:54:38.920]   And that might lead him to investigate the construction of their boats,
[00:54:38.920 --> 00:54:41.920]   or who was in control of Sicily before they arrived.
[00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:46.920]   He might eventually find out that Viking raiders and traders had long been in contact with Constantinople,
[00:54:46.920 --> 00:54:53.920]   and that the Byzantine rulers there requested the help of the now Christian Normans in ousting their enemies,
[00:54:53.920 --> 00:54:55.920]   the Muslim Arabs from Sicily.
[00:54:55.920 --> 00:54:58.920]   How did Vikings end up in Byzantium?
[00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:01.920]   It appears they trekked overland to the River Don in Russia,
[00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:04.920]   and then sailed down it to the Black Sea in Constantinople.
[00:55:04.920 --> 00:55:09.920]   It would be better if the student could not tell Sicily from Saskatchewan,
[00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:15.920]   and knew only that Vikings were very bad people with funny hats who sailed a lot.
[00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:18.920]   Old history textbooks used to be full of battle plans.
[00:55:18.920 --> 00:55:26.920]   People had the quaint notion that the outcomes of battles like Salamis, Lepanto, and Waterloo changed the course of history.
[00:55:26.920 --> 00:55:29.920]   One argument for getting rid of those plans was that they were dull.
[00:55:29.920 --> 00:55:35.920]   Actually, they were dull to the teachers, many of whom didn't care a rap about the structure of battles,
[00:55:35.920 --> 00:55:37.920]   but they could be dynamite for the young.
[00:55:37.920 --> 00:55:40.920]   Once, when my family and I were visiting Gettysburg,
[00:55:40.920 --> 00:55:43.920]   I got into a conversation with a teenager at the top of an observation tower.
[00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:48.920]   He was a tourist, too, but he told me he came back to Gettysburg quite a lot,
[00:55:48.920 --> 00:55:51.920]   and showed me Little Round Top and described for me what happened there.
[00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:54.920]   He reminded me of a couple of homeschooled boys I knew,
[00:55:54.920 --> 00:55:59.920]   who also got their hands on battle plans, poured over them, committed them to memory,
[00:55:59.920 --> 00:56:02.920]   and turned the basement into a battlefield.
[00:56:02.920 --> 00:56:05.920]   They drew out the woods and hills and rivers in chalk,
[00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:07.920]   marked the battalions with counters,
[00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:11.920]   and then played a game of strategy with declared decisions and dice,
[00:56:11.920 --> 00:56:15.920]   reenacting the battle not as it actually happened, but as it might have happened.
[00:56:15.920 --> 00:56:19.920]   When they'd made a move or two on the sprawling "board" of the basement floor,
[00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:23.920]   they would then go outside to play it out with their arms and legs and voices.
[00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:27.920]   And all this was going on while the mother of one of the boys looked the other way.
[00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:30.920]   I relay this all to you in order to ask,
[00:56:30.920 --> 00:56:33.920]   "Of what use to us now are facts?
[00:56:33.920 --> 00:56:37.920]   Surely, in the case of the homeschooled boys, we have seen facts run amok.
[00:56:37.920 --> 00:56:43.920]   The grad grinds in the days of Dickens saw the black smoke belching out of the stacks in Leeds and Manchester,
[00:56:43.920 --> 00:56:45.920]   and it gladdened their hearts.
[00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:49.920]   The thought of molten pig iron fairly made them giddy.
[00:56:49.920 --> 00:56:52.920]   Had Father Christmas dumped their stockings full of coal,
[00:56:52.920 --> 00:56:54.920]   they would have treasured the lumps like diamonds.
[00:56:54.920 --> 00:56:56.920]   But we now have a service economy,
[00:56:56.920 --> 00:57:01.920]   which mainly entails the transfer of money from one person to another for nothing of any inherent use.
[00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:05.920]   We also have a welfare state, which is a perpetual motion machine,
[00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:08.920]   producing the dependency which it purports to alleviate.
[00:57:08.920 --> 00:57:12.920]   Now, a man with a wrench who knows facts about pipes and fittings simply won't do.
[00:57:12.920 --> 00:57:16.920]   We need a few such men, no doubt, but we don't want to encourage it.
[00:57:16.920 --> 00:57:21.920]   We want instead helplessness, narcissism, shallowness, and ignorance,
[00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:24.920]   and we want them in the guise of education.
[00:57:24.920 --> 00:57:27.920]   Drudgery will do, but drudgery to no practical end.
[00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:31.920]   We want grad grind without the facts."
[00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:36.920]   Hope you enjoyed that excerpt.
[00:57:36.920 --> 00:57:39.920]   Again, that is from Anthony Esalen's book called
[00:57:39.920 --> 00:57:43.920]   "Ten Ways to Destroy the Imagination of Your Child."
[00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:48.920]   Excellent reading if you're very interested in destroying the imagination of your child.
[00:57:48.920 --> 00:57:54.920]   He gives ten excellent ways to do that, and as you know, I believe in learning from the very best.
[00:57:59.920 --> 00:58:10.920]   Obviously, that passage could be thought of in connection with many different aspects of our modern society.
[00:58:10.920 --> 00:58:19.920]   But the reason I wanted to share it with you is it's important that you see how these things matter holistically,
[00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:36.920]   and that something as compelling as an educational app can't hope to do anything more than convey some simple, brute facts,
[00:58:36.920 --> 00:58:43.920]   which, while perhaps they could be a catalyst in encouraging someone to go farther,
[00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:55.920]   when compared to the life experience, the background experience of what could be being gained by your child,
[00:58:55.920 --> 00:59:01.920]   it's a dreadfully dull vision.
[00:59:01.920 --> 00:59:06.920]   Just consider Sissy and her knowledge of horses.
[00:59:06.920 --> 00:59:18.920]   She knew horses, and the facts that she could or could not articulate were completely irrelevant
[00:59:18.920 --> 00:59:23.920]   because they were swept away by her knowledge of horses.
[00:59:23.920 --> 00:59:31.920]   Now, come to the modern age, for months and months, AI, artificial intelligence, has been the topic du jour,
[00:59:31.920 --> 00:59:36.920]   where we talk every single day about how AI is going to sweep things away.
[00:59:36.920 --> 00:59:47.920]   Do you think that your child, having some mere facts brute-forced into their brain by an app,
[00:59:47.920 --> 00:59:56.920]   is in some way going to help your child succeed in a world of ubiquitous AI?
[00:59:56.920 --> 00:59:59.920]   There's no chance, friend.
[00:59:59.920 --> 01:00:03.920]   So, speak to your children.
[01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:10.920]   Help your children to acquire words by conversation and by engaging with them.
[01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:13.920]   Turn your baby around so you can talk to him.
[01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:16.920]   Put your phone away so you can talk to him.
[01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:22.920]   Get rid of his phone so you can talk to him and talk to him.
[01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:27.920]   Now, what's even better than conversation?

[01:00:58.920 --> 01:01:06.920]   How can we engage the mind and the imagination?
[01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:09.920]   Back to the Read Aloud Handbook by Jim Trulise.
[01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:16.920]   Most conversation is plain and simple, whether it's between two adults or with children.
[01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:22.920]   It consists of the 5,000 words we use all the time, called the basic lexicon.
[01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:30.920]   Indeed, 83% of the words in normal conversation with a child come from the most commonly used thousand words,
[01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:33.920]   and it doesn't change much as the child ages.
[01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:38.920]   Then there are another 5,000 words we use in conversation less often.
[01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:43.920]   Together, these 10,000 words are called the common lexicon.
[01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:51.920]   Beyond that 10,000 mark are the rare words, and these play a critical role in reading as we grow older.
[01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:58.920]   The eventual strength of our vocabulary is determined not by the 10,000 common words,
[01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:01.920]   but by how many rare words we understand.
[01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:06.920]   If we don't use these rare words very often in conversation, where do we find them?
[01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:12.920]   And here I want to orally describe to you a chart that is printed on the page.
[01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:17.920]   This chart is titled "Number of Rare Words Met Per Thousand."
[01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:19.920]   And remember the definition of a rare word, right?
[01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:25.920]   It's a word that's not in the basic lexicon of those 10,000 words that we commonly use.
[01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:27.920]   So first we have "listening."
[01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:33.920]   Adults speaking to child at six months, 9.3 rare words met per thousand.
[01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:39.920]   An adult speaking to a child at three years old, 9.0 rare words per thousand.
[01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:47.920]   An adult speaking to child at 10 years old, 11.7 rare words per thousand.
[01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:52.920]   An adult speaking to an adult, 7.3 rare words per thousand.
[01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:58.920]   Primetime TV programs, 22.7 rare words per thousand.
[01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:03.920]   Now here in the chart we pivot from listening activities to reading activities.
[01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:08.920]   Reading a children's book, 30.9 rare words met per thousand.
[01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:14.920]   Reading an adult book, 52.7 rare words met per thousand.
[01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:19.920]   Comic book, 53.5 number of rare words met per thousand.
[01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:22.920]   A popular magazine, 65.7.
[01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:25.920]   Newspaper, 68.3.
[01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:31.920]   And a scientific paper, 128 rare words met per thousand.
[01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:37.920]   The preceding chart shows the printed text contains the most rare words.
[01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:42.920]   Whereas an adult uses only 9 rare words per thousand when talking with a three-year-old,
[01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:48.920]   there are three times as many in a children's book and more than seven times as many in a newspaper.
[01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:52.920]   As you can see from the chart, oral communication, including a TV script,
[01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:57.920]   is decidedly inferior to print for building vocabulary.
[01:03:57.920 --> 01:04:02.920]   As shown by the data for printed material, the number of rare words increases significantly.
[01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:09.920]   This poses serious problems for at-risk children who hear fewer words and encounter print less often at home.
[01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:16.920]   Such children face a gigantic word gap that impedes reading progress throughout school.
[01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:26.920]   And that gap can't possibly be breached in 120 hours of summer school or through morphonics instruction.
[01:04:26.920 --> 01:04:28.920]   So let's review now where we're going.
[01:04:28.920 --> 01:04:35.920]   We want to build the minds of our children. We know that we need to give them words and background knowledge.
[01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:47.920]   Those words and that background knowledge need to come to them in the most concentrated form that we're capable of giving to them.
[01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:53.920]   Yes, we want to talk with them in conversation, but normally in day-to-day conversation we only use a basic subset of words.
[01:04:53.920 --> 01:05:04.920]   So we need to give them more words and those words are not abundant in anything except the printed written text.
[01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:12.920]   And so what that means is we need to read to our young children and then encourage our reading children to read,
[01:05:12.920 --> 01:05:15.920]   because that's where they're going to acquire those words.
[01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:20.920]   Now here is where your investments can pay off massively.
[01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:30.920]   If you will dedicate yourself to finding the world's best books with the best words,
[01:05:30.920 --> 01:05:34.920]   and then you dedicate yourself to reading those books to your children,
[01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:40.920]   and you dedicate yourself to encouraging them to read them to themselves or have them read,
[01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:42.920]   which we'll talk about in a moment, through audiobooks,
[01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:47.920]   you can give your children the background knowledge and words so intensely
[01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:55.920]   that their vocabulary going into school can be light years ahead of their peers.
[01:05:55.920 --> 01:05:58.920]   And I want to give you an actual example.
[01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:05.920]   I'm going to take a moment to read to you an example that I just noticed this week while I was reading to my children.
[01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:07.920]   I read to my children a lot.
[01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:11.920]   I personally aim for reading aloud to my family two hours a day.
[01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:12.920]   That's my goal.
[01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:16.920]   I reach it most days, sometimes more, sometimes days I don't get it done,
[01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:20.920]   but I aim for reading to my children two hours a day.
[01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:22.920]   And to be clear, it's not two hours at one time.
[01:06:22.920 --> 01:06:24.920]   It's sprinkled throughout the day.
[01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:27.920]   But I track it and I exceed that goal most days.
[01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:32.920]   And in addition, I try to read to my children the best books.
[01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:35.920]   And when you read really wonderful children's literature,
[01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:41.920]   and you see the vocabulary that's used and the mental pictures and whatnot that are made,
[01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:45.920]   and then you go and compare it to all of the other alternatives,
[01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:49.920]   you can't come away thinking that anything is superior.
[01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:53.920]   But I fear that most of us are not exposed to good quality children's literature because we don't go out and look at it.
[01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:59.920]   So I want to take a moment and I want to read about five pages from the book that I was reading to my children this week.
[01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:04.920]   The book is called Gone Away Lake by an author named Elizabeth Enright.
[01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:11.920]   It's this wonderful story about some young children who on their summer vacation discover an abandoned town
[01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:14.920]   and meet some people who are living in this ghost town.
[01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:22.040]   those people are introducing them to uh to the possibility of using one of these abandoned houses
[01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:26.360]   as a clubhouse that's the basic plot of the book and for children this concept is completely
[01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:31.320]   engaging so if you've not been exposed to high quality children's literature take just a few
[01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:37.400]   minutes and listen to me read this and see how this activates you and then pay attention to the
[01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:42.040]   words that are being used and then again for for context i'm reading this to a nine-year-old
[01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:45.800]   a seven-year-old a five-year-old and a three-year-old now the three-year-old is not super
[01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:51.880]   into it he listens but he's not super engaged it's a little bit past his ability but the rest of them
[01:07:51.880 --> 01:08:00.840]   love it. Belmir. Clouds had covered the sky during the course of Mr. Payton's story and now as they
[01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:06.280]   came out they saw that the color of the day had changed from green and yellow to a cool gray.
[01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:12.680]   The reeds tipping their tops had a velvety bluish look. "Won't rain yet," Mr. Payton said,
[01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:17.480]   glancing at the sky. "Will tonight though. 11, 12 o'clock. We'll get a good steady soaking.
[01:08:17.480 --> 01:08:21.960]   Good for the garden, good for the frogs." "My brother has a remarkable talent for foretelling
[01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:27.480]   weather," Mrs. Cheever said. "I've hardly ever known him wrong." "The swamp taught me," Mr.
[01:08:27.480 --> 01:08:33.160]   Payton conceded. "Live alone as we do, not bothered by the characters of people. And soon,
[01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:39.080]   if you're attentive, you begin to know the character of the weather. Or characters, it has
[01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:46.040]   many." They walked the path in single file. "Now that house," Mr. Payton pointed his cane. "That
[01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:50.520]   house, the Delaney's, might be a good one but there's a bull snake makes his home under the
[01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:54.600]   front steps and I believe there are rats in the basement." "No thank you," said Portia.
[01:08:54.600 --> 01:09:01.400]   "The castle castle has fallen to trash of course and the one beyond is unsound. Roof's gone. Same
[01:09:01.400 --> 01:09:08.280]   with the big house but the Tucker Towns. Now that one maybe? Let's go see." The grass in the
[01:09:08.280 --> 01:09:15.160]   dooryard of Belmere was high as their waists. The old house loomed above them shabby and fancy.
[01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:22.120]   "It doesn't look friendly," thought Portia. The front door glued by years of damp and disuse
[01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:28.440]   stuck fast in its frame. They got in by way of a window from which the lower sash was gone.
[01:09:28.440 --> 01:09:33.400]   The room they entered was large and dark. The floor was littered with fallen plaster and a
[01:09:33.400 --> 01:09:39.000]   crop of toadstools glimmered there. Portia gave a loud scream pointing at the wall before them
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:44.520]   but then she saw that what she had believed to be a group of approaching strangers, ghosts perhaps,
[01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:49.240]   was really only the reflection of themselves. A great mirror was set against the wall.
[01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:55.320]   "I thought it was people, not just us," she explained apologetically. "I mean they, we,
[01:09:56.040 --> 01:10:01.720]   look so shadowy and queer." "I was startled myself," confessed Mrs. Cheever, "and I knew
[01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:07.000]   that mirror was there. It's Mrs. Ravenel's old mirror. She was the mother-in-law. She contributed
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:11.800]   it to the furnishing of Belmere. The damp has damaged it now, of course. See how blotched it
[01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:18.440]   is and the frames turned black." Looking into the mirror was like looking into a pond mottled with
[01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:25.560]   duckweed. Portia liked the way her face appeared in it. Softened, dimmed, mysterious, she thought.
[01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:31.720]   "Now up there on the ceiling where you see the broken fixtures was a very fine gas chandelier,"
[01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:34.840]   said Mr. Peyton, waving his cane aloft. "Wonder what happened to that."
[01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:39.880]   "Plunderers, no doubt," said his sister. "Plunderers got a lot out of Tarago in their day."
[01:10:39.880 --> 01:10:46.920]   Growing used to the dim light, the children's eyes saw now where the paper had fallen from the walls.
[01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:52.040]   Names and dates were scribbled and scratched and initials were carved in the smooth mahogany of the
[01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:57.880]   stair rail. "That's what they used to do," said Mrs. Cheever with satisfaction. "They don't come
[01:10:57.880 --> 01:11:02.520]   here anymore now that my brother and I have settled in. Perhaps they fancy I'm a witch."
[01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:07.160]   She straightened her bell-shaped hat rather proudly. "It flatters many that folks should
[01:11:07.160 --> 01:11:12.760]   think her dangerous," said Mr. Peyton, laughing comfortably. "She's about as dangerous as a dove.
[01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:18.920]   Now these stairs, Portia, Julian, watch out for these. If you select this house, I advise you to
[01:11:18.920 --> 01:11:23.960]   mend the treads. Julian, I'll give you the tools. Hold on to the railing, Minnie." "I'm perfectly
[01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:29.160]   able, Pin," replied his sister without holding on to anything but her skirt to avoid tripping on it.
[01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:34.360]   "And I wish you wouldn't call me Minnie. Min is tolerable, but Minnie, that's the trouble with
[01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:40.760]   the name Minnehaha." "I know exactly how you feel," agreed Portia warmly. "Everybody calls me
[01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:47.640]   Porsche." "Well, I never shall." "No, indeed, I shall not," declared Mrs. Cheever. In the upstairs
[01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:53.160]   hall, Mr. Peyton, advising caution, walked ahead, every now and then stamping his booted foot on
[01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:58.440]   the floor. "Sound, seems perfectly sound," he observed. "Roof's still intact, but it's best
[01:11:58.440 --> 01:12:05.560]   to be careful. Haven't been up here since 1942." The rooms that opened off the hall were bleak
[01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:11.800]   and empty. Clay wasp's nests were stuck to the moldings. No furniture remained, but a broken
[01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:18.760]   washstand or two and an iron bedstead. Plaster had fallen everywhere. There was a solid smell of damp.
[01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:24.360]   "That was Tark's room," Mr. Peyton observed, glancing at a doorway. "By Jove, how well I
[01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:29.160]   remember it. Maps all over the wall. And on his ceiling, he'd painted the constellations in their
[01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:35.160]   summer order. You can still see some of the blue and gold. He had a time painting it. Lay on his
[01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:40.040]   back on a plank laid across two ladders. That's how Michelangelo painted the Sistine Chapel,"
[01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:45.960]   says he. "But the amount of paint he got on himself, in his hair, in his eyebrows. And I've
[01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:51.640]   swallowed plenty too," says he. "For I work with my mouth open when I'm concentrating." Lucky thing
[01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:57.160]   it didn't poison him, though no doubt he had an azure colored elementary tracked for a long time
[01:12:57.160 --> 01:13:02.920]   afterwards. "I remember those blue eyebrows," said Mrs. Cheever as they continued along the hall.
[01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:08.920]   "A terrible sight. Now this room at the very end was Baby Bell's," she tried to open the door. "Oh
[01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:13.800]   dear, the miserable thing is stuck. Pen see if you," Mr. Peyton and Julian shoved their shoulders
[01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:18.120]   against the door, which instantly burst open, hurling them inward. Mrs. Cheever and Portia
[01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:24.920]   followed. "This one's lovely," exclaimed Portia. And it was. A light, spacious room with three
[01:13:24.920 --> 01:13:30.280]   windows and a fireplace. Facing south and having been shut up for a long time, the room was drier
[01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:35.400]   than the others and no wasps had lodged there, though there were signs on the hearth that swifts
[01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:40.120]   had nested in the chimney. Without thinking, Portia walked to a closed closet door and turned
[01:13:40.120 --> 01:13:45.320]   the knob. That door, like the other, opened unwillingly, resisting strongly at first and
[01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:51.080]   then flying forward to bang her on the forehead. "Ouch!" said Portia. "And then why look what's
[01:13:51.080 --> 01:14:01.400]   up there on the shelf, Mrs. Cheever. Why look at those!" I'll stop, but I hope it drives the point
[01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:09.080]   home that if you will find and read world-class literature to your children, they will be
[01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:16.040]   utterly engrossed in the story, which gives them a tremendous amount of background knowledge on life,
[01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:25.480]   as well as an absolutely massive vocabulary. Think of all the words that I just read that
[01:14:25.480 --> 01:14:33.400]   are not in the common vocabulary, and we learn words by hearing them in meaningful context
[01:14:33.400 --> 01:14:40.040]   repeatedly. And so, if you will read to your children, you can put them so far ahead of
[01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:47.320]   their peers in terms of vocabulary, and that will fundamentally alter their academic career
[01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:55.560]   as well as, very possibly, their life career. An experience I had a number of years ago
[01:14:55.560 --> 01:15:02.840]   is so etched on my brain that I want to share it with you in this context,
[01:15:02.840 --> 01:15:10.360]   because it matters. A few years ago, I had a friend of mine that I grew up with, and this
[01:15:10.360 --> 01:15:21.400]   friend was not from my same kind of background and upbringing. He was adopted when he was a baby,
[01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:29.080]   adopted into a loving and wonderful home. His mother died of cancer when he was only a few
[01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:34.920]   years old, though, so he never knew his mother. So, he was raised by a single father. This father
[01:15:34.920 --> 01:15:43.720]   was a loving and devoted father, but he was a very simple man. The father worked as a – owned a
[01:15:43.720 --> 01:15:49.720]   landscaping – a lawn maintenance company, and he worked to give his children everything that he
[01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:57.560]   could. And he gave his son everything that he could. All of the necessary boxes for a successful
[01:15:57.560 --> 01:16:03.320]   childhood were checked. Now, he was raised by a single father. His father never – his widow or
[01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:08.200]   father never remarried. So, he was raised by a single father. He missed the influence of a mother
[01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:13.880]   in his life. But again, the father was loving and wonderful. He was close to – the boy's
[01:16:13.880 --> 01:16:20.680]   grandmother was involved in his life, etc. The boy went to private schools, went to various private
[01:16:20.680 --> 01:16:24.600]   schools. He wasn't great academically, but he was adequate, graduated from high school.
[01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:31.320]   All during his lifetime – sorry, during his teenage years, he worked in his father's company
[01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:36.920]   and in the lawn maintenance business. And he worked hard, earned money, etc. It was a good
[01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:43.400]   family business. Again, good productive relationship. And then after graduating from
[01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:47.160]   high school, he continued to work in his father's company. His father later sold the company,
[01:16:47.160 --> 01:16:50.840]   and he continued to work for the guy who had purchased the landscaping company.
[01:16:50.840 --> 01:17:00.840]   Then this young man – young man at that time, 23-ish years old – he got into an accident that
[01:17:00.840 --> 01:17:08.920]   was his fault. Car accident. He was fine, but he was sued by the lady who he got an accident with,
[01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:14.840]   and his license was affected because of the at-fault accident. And so, his boss's insurance
[01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:20.920]   rates were going to increase massively. And so, his boss at the company fired him because he
[01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:25.720]   wasn't willing to pay the higher insurance rates due to his now marred driving record.
[01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:32.600]   And this is where I came in. I had known the boy his entire lifetime. We had been closer at times,
[01:17:32.600 --> 01:17:37.880]   farther away at times, etc. But we came in, and I got involved, and I was doing a little bit of
[01:17:37.880 --> 01:17:42.760]   career coaching. Now, this young man had done a great job of saving money. At the time, he was in
[01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:48.200]   his early 20s. He had something like $30,000 saved, which was remarkable. And basically,
[01:17:48.200 --> 01:17:53.560]   he didn't do a lot with his life. He basically just saved money. He stayed at home. He played
[01:17:53.560 --> 01:17:59.080]   around on the computer, played computer games, etc. Went to work, came home, went and played
[01:17:59.080 --> 01:18:03.160]   basketball with some friends here and there, but didn't do a lot. So, here I was doing career
[01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:08.840]   coaching. And what was shocking to me was when I started probing about ideas he had for things he
[01:18:08.840 --> 01:18:16.760]   wanted to do, he had basically no ideas in his life. He couldn't come up with anything that was
[01:18:16.760 --> 01:18:25.160]   interesting to him. He had no idea what to do. The most creative idea that he had for his life
[01:18:25.160 --> 01:18:32.520]   and for his career was basically to go and get a job at a store working as a cash register.
[01:18:32.520 --> 01:18:39.320]   Now, he was a hardworking, perfectly competent guy, high school diploma, etc. And what was
[01:18:39.320 --> 01:18:46.040]   lacking in his life was imagination. He was lacking the understanding that things could be
[01:18:46.040 --> 01:18:55.320]   different. And as I sought to coach him a little bit, I quickly came to understand that he had no
[01:18:55.320 --> 01:19:02.120]   imagination about what he could do because he had no life experience that showed him what other
[01:19:02.120 --> 01:19:07.640]   options other people had gone on. And I came to realize that because he was not a reader,
[01:19:07.640 --> 01:19:14.120]   because he had not been exposed vicariously to the experiences of others, he didn't have a sense of
[01:19:14.120 --> 01:19:20.680]   the world and the realities of the world. By all accounts, he was a normal member of society,
[01:19:20.680 --> 01:19:27.720]   but his screen-oriented personal life and his limited personal experience confined him to a
[01:19:27.720 --> 01:19:34.280]   world that was extraordinarily small and rather dreary. And this influenced not only his
[01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:42.120]   choices, but his level of confidence in the world, his level of confidence in life.
[01:19:42.760 --> 01:19:49.880]   At 23 years old, he was a perfectly attractive guy. He went to the gym a lot. He had big muscles,
[01:19:49.880 --> 01:19:57.160]   was in great shape, etc. Very sociable, etc. He had no problem with social skills,
[01:19:57.160 --> 01:20:02.760]   perfectly normal guy. He had no ambition to marry, didn't really see the point, didn't know why he
[01:20:02.760 --> 01:20:08.200]   would want to marry. He didn't really have an ambition to go anywhere, do anything, just kind
[01:20:08.200 --> 01:20:14.280]   of live in life. And so I did my best to coach him and give him some ideas. I strongly urged him to
[01:20:14.280 --> 01:20:19.960]   go travel, and this is why I'm getting to. What was shocking to me was how little confidence he had
[01:20:19.960 --> 01:20:24.840]   in his ability to travel. I told him, I said, "Listen, you got 30 grand in the bank,
[01:20:24.840 --> 01:20:29.160]   you're 23 years old, you don't have a dime of debt, you got all the world in front of you.
[01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:32.360]   Buy yourself a pickup truck," or he already had an SUV. I was like, "Toss a mattress in the back of
[01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:37.480]   your pickup truck. Go hit the road, right? Just go drive, drive for a few weeks, go camp out,
[01:20:37.480 --> 01:20:42.520]   stay in some national parks, visit people, go to coffee shops, go to bars. If you see someone
[01:20:42.520 --> 01:20:47.560]   hiring a job, just work your way in a big square around the country, live cheap and pick up a job,
[01:20:47.560 --> 01:20:50.760]   work here for a few months, go there for a few months, basically get some life experience."
[01:20:50.760 --> 01:20:54.520]   I felt like that would be helpful for him. I wasn't going to turn him into a literary creature,
[01:20:54.520 --> 01:20:59.080]   nor would that even be advisable. Get some life experience and get access to some things that are
[01:20:59.080 --> 01:21:02.680]   available to you, right? Go and work on a shrimp boat in Louisiana, go and work on a
[01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:08.200]   logging crew in Maine, go do something interesting with your life.
[01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:16.680]   So as I'm talking with him, and over the course of weeks, I'm urging him to do it,
[01:21:16.680 --> 01:21:21.960]   he started moving in that direction. What he was scared of was the most insane things to me. He's
[01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:27.800]   like, "What happens if my car breaks down while I'm on my trip?" Newish car, very little chance
[01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:31.800]   of breaking down. I said, "You call a tow truck." "Well, what if a tow truck can't come?" "Then you
[01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:36.920]   put out your finger, like your thumb, you walk. You're 23 years old, you're in the prime of your
[01:21:36.920 --> 01:21:44.760]   physical youth, etc." But he couldn't do it. Now, my goal is not to be hard on my friend,
[01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:54.520]   we've all been in this experience, but I don't want my 23-year-old son to be in the situation
[01:21:54.520 --> 01:21:59.160]   that my friend was at 23 years old. And I don't want your son to be there either.
[01:22:00.120 --> 01:22:05.640]   The idea that you couldn't have any ideas about your future is unacceptable.
[01:22:05.640 --> 01:22:11.720]   Even if you choose, even if you say, not everyone needs to go and sail the world constantly. I'm
[01:22:11.720 --> 01:22:17.320]   not saying that we should all live unorthodox lifestyles, but you should have the imagination
[01:22:17.320 --> 01:22:21.560]   to know various lifestyles that you could enjoy, things that could be good for you.
[01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:25.960]   And it's perfectly reasonable for you to make a choice and say, "I'm working this fairly mundane
[01:22:25.960 --> 01:22:30.280]   job because it gives me these certain things that I want." Again, that's fine, I'm not arguing with
[01:22:30.280 --> 01:22:36.760]   that. But make that choice intentionally, knowing that there are other things that you could do and
[01:22:36.760 --> 01:22:41.320]   that you've chosen to do those things. But you don't want to be in a situation where you're 23
[01:22:41.320 --> 01:22:47.400]   years old, money, time, physical health, etc. And you don't have the courage and confidence to even
[01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:53.480]   go explore the world looking for something else that you could do. This young man had all the
[01:22:53.480 --> 01:23:00.440]   basics, high school diploma, could read, could do math, etc. Gone to a private school, good school,
[01:23:00.440 --> 01:23:13.880]   right? But he didn't have... I'm lacking the words. You need to give your children experience in life.
[01:23:13.880 --> 01:23:21.240]   It's better for your children to work six different jobs during their middle school and high school
[01:23:21.240 --> 01:23:25.960]   years than one job. It's interesting. As I reflected on this, I realized how different his
[01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:31.160]   life course was than my life course. I've actually, although I want my children to have the opportunity
[01:23:31.160 --> 01:23:37.160]   to work in our family businesses, I'm concerned about them exclusively being involved in the family
[01:23:37.160 --> 01:23:41.960]   businesses because it's bad for experience. Children need to go and they need to work for
[01:23:41.960 --> 01:23:45.160]   different employers, they need to be exposed to all kinds of different kinds of co-workers,
[01:23:45.160 --> 01:23:48.520]   they need to be exposed to different cultures, different backgrounds, different customs,
[01:23:48.520 --> 01:23:54.200]   and that experience needs to be both firsthand and through other resources. Secondhand through
[01:23:54.200 --> 01:24:00.440]   literature, through movies, through stories of other people, etc. We need to expose our children
[01:24:00.440 --> 01:24:06.680]   to these things. How can I give my kids word if I don't have them? This is a question I've heard
[01:24:06.680 --> 01:24:10.360]   from parents who have learning disabilities or for whom English is a second language.
[01:24:10.360 --> 01:24:16.520]   While there are few easy answers in parenting, this one is easier than most. There is a public
[01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:21.640]   agency that comes to the rescue in such instances. In fact, it's been doing this job for more than a
[01:24:21.640 --> 01:24:28.360]   century. What the agency does is take all the nouns, verbs, and adjectives a person would ever
[01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:35.400]   need and bundle them into little packages for anyone to borrow free. It asks only that you
[01:24:35.400 --> 01:24:40.520]   bring the packages back in a few weeks. I'm referring to the American Free Public Library,
[01:24:40.520 --> 01:24:45.640]   the people's university, and for those who can't read the words, they are now available on audio
[01:24:45.640 --> 01:24:51.240]   cassette and CD. Forty years ago you had to be blind to get a recorded book in America. Now anyone
[01:24:51.240 --> 01:24:58.280]   can. What do you do? How do you invest into your children? Expose your children to an immense
[01:24:58.280 --> 01:25:05.000]   amount of background knowledge and an immense amount of words. Do it based upon reading to them
[01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:11.480]   constantly and continually at every age, not just at young age, but all the ages. Do it by
[01:25:11.480 --> 01:25:18.680]   encouraging them to read constantly and continually at every age and to read a diet
[01:25:18.680 --> 01:25:28.360]   of great diversity of sources and do it by exposing them to audiobooks, really wonderful
[01:25:28.360 --> 01:25:34.680]   audiobooks. I use all of these things and I think that if you do them you'll see the amount of
[01:25:34.680 --> 01:25:41.160]   difference that can be made. Let's do a quick math calculation here. Do you remember the number that
[01:25:41.160 --> 01:25:45.480]   was used as far as from the Kansas University study of how many words the wealthy people would
[01:25:45.480 --> 01:25:51.960]   expose the total words a child would have heard by age four? The number in the highest group was
[01:25:51.960 --> 01:25:56.440]   45 million words. The four-year-old child from the professional family will have heard 45 million
[01:25:56.440 --> 01:26:05.320]   words prior to the age of four. When I read, I read at a rate of 8,000 words per hour. I read
[01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:11.480]   8,000 words per hour and I read two hours per day. Basically, every single day,
[01:26:11.480 --> 01:26:18.120]   365 days per year. That's an average. That means that every year I read to my children about 5,840,000
[01:26:18.120 --> 01:26:26.360]   words. Over the course of four years, that comes out to 23,360,000 words.
[01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:34.120]   So, I know that I myself am putting in, again, about 6 million words per year just from reading aloud.
[01:26:34.120 --> 01:26:40.280]   That's ignoring conversation, etc. Total for that four-year-old is 23.3 million words.
[01:26:40.280 --> 01:26:46.600]   In addition to that, we do as a family a huge amount of audiobook listening. I would estimate
[01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:52.360]   it varies on the child, but somewhere between one to three hours a day of audiobook listening.
[01:26:52.360 --> 01:26:56.760]   When I go through our daily schedule, I'll explain how I do that. Let's just call it two hours a day.
[01:26:56.760 --> 01:27:04.840]   Two hours a day, again, over four years, I know for sure that I'm getting another 23.3 million words
[01:27:04.840 --> 01:27:12.920]   into my child. So, right there, I'm at 46 million words with stuff that I track. My wife also reads
[01:27:12.920 --> 01:27:16.680]   to the children quite a lot. I don't track the amount of time that she reads to them, but she
[01:27:16.680 --> 01:27:23.720]   also reads to them quite a lot. And, of course, we converse constantly, non-stop, etc. And so,
[01:27:23.720 --> 01:27:31.480]   if the average professional child gets 45 million words prior to entering kindergarten,
[01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:39.160]   I think that pretty reliably that I can get 60 million words into my children prior to the age
[01:27:39.160 --> 01:27:45.560]   at which they enter into kindergarten. And then, because of the resources that we consume,
[01:27:46.120 --> 01:27:54.440]   those words that we present are much…there are many more of the less common words than the most
[01:27:54.440 --> 01:27:59.480]   common words. I have a lot more to say on this subject, but I can hear that my children have
[01:27:59.480 --> 01:28:05.400]   awakened from their naps in the other room, and I am needed for my fatherly duties. So,
[01:28:05.400 --> 01:28:12.680]   I'm going to close this podcast episode here and come back with you with more. I want to talk
[01:28:12.680 --> 01:28:19.160]   about…certainly about reading. I want to talk about fiction versus non-fiction and the dreadful
[01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:25.560]   importance of lots and lots of fiction. I want to talk about multilingualism and reading in
[01:28:25.560 --> 01:28:31.160]   different languages, because that is another thing. Now, I'll explain in detail the impact
[01:28:31.160 --> 01:28:35.880]   that I think multilingualism can have on your children's brains, and I'll do it from the
[01:28:35.880 --> 01:28:41.560]   perspective…remember, three years ago, we as a family were a monolingual family. At this point
[01:28:41.560 --> 01:28:48.760]   in time, we are now reading and homeschooling in six languages. I'll explain that process to you,
[01:28:48.760 --> 01:28:55.640]   because I believe it is tremendously important, and it's very important even what those languages
[01:28:55.640 --> 01:29:00.520]   are and how they impact your skill and knowledge in the English language, etc.
[01:29:00.520 --> 01:29:05.880]   And then, we'll move on to numeracy, we'll talk about music and musicality, etc.
[01:29:05.880 --> 01:29:13.160]   When it comes to investing into your child's mind and brain and enhancing the cognitive ability of
[01:29:13.160 --> 01:29:20.680]   your child, there are many things you can do. Most of them are very simple and very inexpensive.
[01:29:20.680 --> 01:29:28.280]   And if you want to make the one investment into your child's cognitive ability that will pay off
[01:29:28.280 --> 01:29:38.680]   in spades, just read to your children and surround them with books that they can read to themselves.
[01:29:38.680 --> 01:29:43.720]   Read to them, surround them with books that they can read, surround them with audiobooks of them
[01:29:43.720 --> 01:29:52.040]   being read to. And that, more than any other metric or piece of advice that I can find,
[01:29:52.680 --> 01:30:01.480]   will secure their academic future in an incredible way. And by the way, you don't need to do this for
[01:30:01.480 --> 01:30:07.000]   12 years. You should, but you don't need to. You need basically four years of this.
[01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:12.440]   If you can send your kindergartner, if you have a young child and you send your kindergartner off
[01:30:12.440 --> 01:30:19.240]   into the local government school for kindergarten, but you send your child in, being exposed to,
[01:30:19.240 --> 01:30:26.120]   having been exposed to 60 or 70 or 80 million words by being with mom, with dad constantly
[01:30:26.120 --> 01:30:33.160]   conversing, talking, etc., reading hours and hours of books, reading audiobooks, having diverse
[01:30:33.160 --> 01:30:38.280]   experiences, etc., academically, as far as I'm concerned, you can pretty well dust your hands
[01:30:38.280 --> 01:30:44.440]   and be done. And your child will never be in the struggling component of the class ever again.
[01:30:45.240 --> 01:30:51.720]   But if you don't do that, if you don't get those first four, five, six years right by
[01:30:51.720 --> 01:30:59.240]   filling your child's mind with words and stories and etc., then you may spend
[01:30:59.240 --> 01:31:07.240]   tens of thousands of dollars on tutors and never make up the results, because you're just running
[01:31:07.240 --> 01:31:11.640]   behind the whole time. So, I think this is an adequate place for me to close today's podcast.
[01:31:11.640 --> 01:31:15.960]   I have more to say on the subject, but I'll be back with you very soon. Thank you for listening.
