[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400]   I used to in San Francisco have entrepreneurs come over for scotch at my office and they
[00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.840]   would just ask me all these questions and someone say, how do you get people to give
[00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:08.840]   you their numbers?
[00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.920]   And I said, well, what I do is I give them a dramatic low ball.
[00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.360]   I said, what do you mean dramatic low ball?
[00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.640]   I said, I had this woman on, she wouldn't give me her revenue number.
[00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.460]   And I knew that it was at least 10 million.
[00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:20.280]   I said to her.
