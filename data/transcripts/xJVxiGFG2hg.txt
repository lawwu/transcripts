[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.880]   - Welcome back to the podcast on this fine Monday.
[00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.760]   We start the week with a question that reached us
[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.080]   from 10,000 miles away, from Port Elizabeth, South Africa,
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.920]   and from a listener named Kyle.
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.080]   Hello, Pastor John, I've enjoyed listening to APJ
[00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.980]   for a few months now.
[00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.020]   My question is this.
[00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.360]   What did Jesus actually accomplish?
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.200]   Every time I ask this question, fellow believers,
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.860]   the answer is always an enthusiastic everything.
[00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.260]   And while that answer is nice,
[00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.740]   it always felt like the equivalent of asking a chef
[00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.960]   after having eaten an exquisite dish,
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.480]   what the ingredients are,
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.800]   and his emphatic response being everything.
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.840]   And are there a core group of Christ's accomplishments
[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.840]   that we should focus on more than others?
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.080]   On the flip side, is there anything
[00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.620]   that Christ didn't accomplish
[00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.120]   that we have somehow tricked ourselves
[00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.400]   into believing he did?
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.080]   I'm thinking of wealth, comfort, and the good life today.
[00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.420]   Can we go too far by promising things
[00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.220]   Christ did not accomplish for us today?
[00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.580]   - As with many questions we are asked,
[00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:12.460]   the first task is to clarify terms.
[00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:13.580]   - Yeah, right.
[00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:14.620]   - So crucial.
[00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.860]   In fact, most questions answer themselves
[00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.660]   once you understand the terms.
[00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.240]   Until we do this, we can't even know what is being asked.
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.780]   And this question in particular
[00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.980]   is fraught with ambiguities.
[00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.700]   First, the ambiguity of definition.
[00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.260]   What does the word accomplish mean?
[00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:39.180]   And then the ambiguity of timing, accomplished by when?
[00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.520]   And then the ambiguity of beneficiaries,
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.260]   accomplished for whom?
[00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.440]   And then the ambiguity of act,
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.900]   like which act of Jesus are you asking about?
[00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.060]   Accomplished by his miracles,
[00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.300]   accomplished by his sinless obedience,
[00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:55.380]   accomplished by his death,
[00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.580]   accomplished by his resurrection,
[00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.900]   accomplished by his intercession, oh my.
[00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.300]   So we've got lots of work to do.
[00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.300]   So let me suggest four clarifications.
[00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.260]   And I think in the very clarifying,
[00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.060]   we'll address every one of Kyle's questions.
[00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.900]   So number one, I'm going to assume
[00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.320]   that the act of Jesus that Kyle has in mind
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.340]   when he asks this is his death and resurrection.
[00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.660]   That is, what did Jesus accomplish
[00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.260]   in dying for us and rising again?
[00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.620]   That's my assumption as I answer this question.
[00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.460]   Number two, when I use the word accomplish
[00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.660]   in relation to Jesus' saving work on the cross
[00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.260]   and in the resurrection,
[00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.640]   the meaning I give to the word is this.
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.640]   Accomplish something means cause it to happen
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:03.800]   in that very hour or make certain
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.000]   that it will happen at some time in the future.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.640]   That's what I mean by accomplished.
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.800]   And I get that meaning from Isaiah 46.10.
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.800]   Here's what God says there.
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.400]   I am God and there is no other.
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.380]   I am God and there is none like me.
[00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.920]   My counsel shall stand
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.920]   and I will accomplish all my purpose.
[00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:36.460]   Now, the point of the word accomplish in that verse,
[00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:41.460]   Isaiah 46.10, is to emphasize that it cannot fail.
[00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.640]   I am God and this is what it means to be God.
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.980]   I speak and I accomplish what I speak.
[00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.140]   Accomplish means do whatever it takes
[00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.880]   to make something certain, start to finish.
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.540]   Now, that's important to emphasize
[00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:04.660]   because there are a lot of people
[00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.660]   who emphatically disagree with this meaning of accomplish
[00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.660]   when it comes to what Jesus did on the cross
[00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.740]   and in the resurrection.
[00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:22.740]   For them, the death of Jesus did not accomplish in this way.
[00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.160]   It did not bring about certainties.
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.080]   It brought about possibilities.
[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.660]   So in my definition, Jesus, they would say,
[00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.340]   didn't accomplish any salvation.
[00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:41.340]   He didn't make it certain for anybody in particular.
[00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.220]   They would say that what Jesus accomplished
[00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:50.220]   was to make salvation possible for all people to obtain.
[00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.440]   That's it, that's what he accomplished, a possibility.
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:59.100]   But he did not accomplish their salvation
[00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:03.300]   in the sense of making it certain, start to finish.
[00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.700]   But that's what I think he did.
[00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.540]   So if you ask me, what did Jesus accomplish?
[00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:11.580]   I would say by his death and resurrection,
[00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:16.580]   Christ accomplished the full salvation
[00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.720]   for his elect, the people he chose
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.360]   before the foundation of the world.
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:26.380]   Jesus said that his blood was the blood
[00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:29.860]   of the new covenant, Luke 22 20,
[00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:34.860]   which means that his blood secured,
[00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:39.900]   guaranteed, purchased, obtained the new covenant.
[00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:43.300]   And what the new covenant promised
[00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:47.100]   is that God would take out the heart of stone,
[00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.580]   put in the heart of flesh,
[00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:53.180]   cause his people to walk in his ways.
[00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:56.620]   In other words, the new covenant was not just
[00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:01.000]   that God would make faith and forgiveness possible,
[00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:05.620]   but that he would make it certain for his people.
[00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:09.380]   In fact, that's what makes the new covenant,
[00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:11.820]   the new covenant, that's what makes it new
[00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.680]   and different from the old covenant.
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:19.680]   It cannot fail because God accomplishes it,
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:24.060]   makes it certain, start to finish.
[00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:27.580]   So by his death and resurrection,
[00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.700]   Christ secured, he accomplished,
[00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:35.700]   he made certain that all God's wrath
[00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:39.060]   would be turned away from all God's elect,
[00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.780]   that they would all be redeemed,
[00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:44.260]   that they would all come to faith,
[00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.000]   that they would all be justified, forgiven,
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.020]   receive the Holy Spirit, be sanctified,
[00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:51.160]   be raised from the dead, be glorified
[00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.080]   in God's presence with eternal joy forever.
[00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:58.060]   That is the accomplishment of the cross.
[00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:01.620]   And it is certain, he purchased it, he bought it,
[00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:05.300]   he guaranteed it by his blood and resurrection,
[00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:10.260]   a total great salvation for all God's elect,
[00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:15.260]   start to finish, this is what we offer to the world.
[00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.340]   We don't say to the world in our evangelism,
[00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:20.980]   in our world missions, we don't say,
[00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:24.780]   Christ did not accomplish anything but a possibility.
[00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:28.500]   We say Christ accomplished a great,
[00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:33.500]   certain, complete salvation and anyone,
[00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:38.740]   absolutely anyone who has Christ has all of it.
[00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:42.260]   Receive him, oh, receive him.
[00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.700]   I can picture my dad, Tony, just,
[00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:47.980]   he was a great evangelist and I sat as a little boy
[00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:51.580]   watching him plead with sinners at the front of the church
[00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:52.940]   after he preached his heart out
[00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:55.180]   for a week of evangelistic meetings.
[00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:57.700]   Oh, come, come, believe in him
[00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:59.940]   with tears running down his face.
[00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:03.060]   Embrace him as your savior, your Lord,
[00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:05.540]   your greatest treasure in the universe
[00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:08.940]   and everything, everything, absolutely everything
[00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:12.100]   he accomplished is yours.
[00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:16.760]   That's my understanding of what he accomplished.
[00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:21.760]   Number two, number three, clarification number three, timing.
[00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:26.340]   When we say that Christ accomplished something,
[00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:30.180]   we don't necessarily mean it happened already
[00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:34.420]   or that it will happen in our lifetime on earth.
[00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:37.220]   So for example, Christ accomplished the satisfaction
[00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:39.660]   of God's wrath against our sin.
[00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:42.940]   Well, that's over, that's past, done, once for all,
[00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:47.940]   never repeated, he accomplished our justification.
[00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:50.580]   Now that happened at the moment,
[00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:54.060]   the propitiation, the satisfaction of God's wrath,
[00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:59.060]   that happened 33 AD and it will never be repeated.
[00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:00.980]   Once for all, when he died,
[00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:04.620]   he bore our judgment and God's wrath.
[00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:09.620]   Justification happened at the instant that we believed
[00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:13.840]   and he accomplished our perfection,
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:17.340]   but that will be experienced only in the future
[00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:20.740]   at the resurrection of the body.
[00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:23.660]   This is important because some people say,
[00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:26.540]   and I think this is what was being asked,
[00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:28.700]   healing is in the atonement.
[00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:32.660]   And since Christ accomplished healing and prosperity
[00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:35.140]   and wealth for his people,
[00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:37.860]   Christians will be healed and prosperous,
[00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:40.900]   healed of all our diseases now in this life
[00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:42.520]   if we just have enough faith.
[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:47.520]   Well, it's true that Jesus applied Isaiah 53, 4
[00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:50.640]   to his healing ministry.
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:52.920]   This was to fulfill that which was spoken
[00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:54.080]   by the prophet Isaiah.
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:58.960]   He took our illnesses and bore our diseases, Matthew 8, 17.
[00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:01.240]   And Peter says by his wounds,
[00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:03.080]   you have been healed in referring
[00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:05.080]   to the forgiveness of sins.
[00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:10.080]   But neither of those passages say that the fullness
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:15.720]   of healing will happen in this life.
[00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:20.320]   In fact, Paul makes it plain that we will be groaning
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:24.720]   in this fallen world until all things are made new
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.120]   in Romans 8.
[00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:30.700]   So yes, Jesus accomplished perfect healing
[00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:32.840]   by his death and resurrection.
[00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:37.840]   Perfect health was made certain by the death of Jesus
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   for all his people, but not all of it in this life.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.420]   One last clarification.
[00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:49.040]   There is one amazing promise that connects the death
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:54.040]   of Jesus to the certainty of everything good
[00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:59.520]   that saved sinners ever experience now and forever.
[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:01.720]   And that's Romans 8, 32.
[00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:04.700]   He who did not spare his own son,
[00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:06.840]   but gave him up for us all.
[00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:08.760]   Now you could ask, as soon as he says that,
[00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:10.080]   what's he going to say now?
[00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:12.680]   What did that accomplish?
[00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:16.200]   What did not sparing his own son accomplish for us?
[00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:17.800]   He answers like this.
[00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:22.800]   How will he not also with him graciously give us all things?
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:30.300]   So the logic is staggeringly strong, staggeringly vast,
[00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:35.800]   because God did not spare his Christ, his son.
[00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:40.800]   It is absolutely certain that all of his elect
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:45.000]   will be given, quote, all things,
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.080]   which means in the context where we can be killed,
[00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:54.080]   verse 35 of Romans 8, which means everything we need
[00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:58.640]   in order to do God's will and to glorify his name
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:01.040]   and to be happy in him for all eternity,
[00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:04.920]   everything we need will be given
[00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:07.280]   because he accomplished that.
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:10.800]   So if I were to say, going back to the question now,
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:15.240]   Jesus accomplished everything, like the chef,
[00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:17.960]   I put everything, I put everything in the meal.
[00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:19.560]   Well, here's what I would mean by that.
[00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:22.520]   By his death and resurrection,
[00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:26.720]   he made certain that all his people
[00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:31.480]   would have absolutely everything we need
[00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:36.040]   to glorify God by being eternally happy in him.
[00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:36.880]   - Yeah, amen.
[00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:37.760]   That's what it's all about,
[00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:41.160]   glorifying God by enjoying him forever.
[00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:44.680]   A spiritual feast for us made possible in Christ.
[00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:46.560]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for listening today.
[00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:48.040]   You can ask a question of your own,
[00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:51.200]   search through or browse all 1,600 of our past episodes,
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:52.400]   or subscribe to the podcast.
[00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:55.400]   You can do all that at desiringgod.org/askpastor.
[00:12:56.280 --> 00:13:00.400]   Well, the world says we need self-confidence
[00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:02.800]   more than anything else.
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:04.800]   Well, no, there are things more important
[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:07.000]   to our lives than self-confidence.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.560]   So what are those things?
[00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:11.120]   Pastor John will explain next time on Wednesday.
[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:14.200]   I am your host, Tony Renke, and we'll see you then.
[00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:16.780]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:19.360]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:29.360]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
