[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620]   Let's see if we can talk about communication.
[00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.440]   Before we do, pop quiz.
[00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.020]   Gentlemen, there's three things you've got to
[00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:09.820]   remember in order to be a godly husband.
[00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.100]   Now, let's impress these ladies really well.
[00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:14.900]   Say it right out loud.
[00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.460]   Number one, I've got to be a.
[00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:17.580]   >> Wife.
[00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:18.340]   >> Uh-huh.
[00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:19.020]   >> Husband.
[00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:19.740]   >> Uh-huh.
[00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:20.380]   >> Teacher.
[00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.140]   >> Good. Ladies, put a smile on your husband's face.
[00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.180]   There are three things that you've got to
[00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.100]   remember in order to be a godly wife.
[00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.260]   Say them right out loud. Ready?
[00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:30.940]   >> Submission.
[00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:31.580]   >> Uh-huh.
[00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.140]   >> Suitable helper.
[00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.620]   >> Selflessly reverent.
[00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.260]   >> There you go. Submission, suitable helper,
[00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.700]   selflessly reverent. Those are three things.
[00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:46.380]   Now, we're all going to learn four rules of communication.
[00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.980]   We're all going to learn four rules of communication in the home,
[00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.500]   and from this particular point on,
[00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.740]   God is going to change the climate of your home.
[00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.180]   From this point on,
[00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.580]   God is going to change the climate of your home.
[00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.420]   What is the communication like in your home?
[00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.380]   Between you and your spouse,
[00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.900]   between you and your children, what is it like?
[00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.580]   Well, I want you to know that good communication in
[00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.640]   the Christian marriage does not happen automatically.
[00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.300]   It doesn't happen automatically.
[00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:25.100]   Neither is the Christian marriage immune from problems.
[00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.940]   Now, there are some people who think
[00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.340]   that just because both of us are Christian,
[00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.260]   you see a lot of young people who both love the Lord,
[00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:33.180]   and they're going to get married,
[00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.580]   they think that they're going to be immune from
[00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.980]   problems because we're both Christians.
[00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.540]   Well, that's not the case.
[00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.180]   In fact, this is one of
[00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.540]   the big problems that I have with these dating websites.
[00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:51.500]   They push on people the myth of compatibility, and it is a myth.
[00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.980]   As long as you take this extended test and answer all these questions,
[00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.300]   we'll find somebody in our data bank who answer
[00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.300]   questions in a similar way and we'll match you up with that person,
[00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:09.580]   and you're going to be the perfect couple because you think so like together.
[00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.660]   When they finally get married and get into marriage,
[00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.980]   and they find out they have differences,
[00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.380]   and they find out that both of them are sinners,
[00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:22.460]   all of a sudden, reality pops that myth of compatibility.
[00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.380]   Now, they say, "What is wrong?
[00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.220]   I thought we were so perfect for one another,
[00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.380]   and a computer put us together."
[00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.700]   What's going on?
[00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:40.380]   Reality, every marriage is dysfunctional.
[00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:49.900]   To voluntarily adopt a family systems therapy term, dysfunctional.
[00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:55.740]   Every marriage is dysfunctional because two rebellious,
[00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:02.420]   ungodly sinners who happen to be saved by grace are making a vow to each other.
[00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.140]   Two rebels are making a vow to each other,
[00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.660]   and that's going to be hard,
[00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.540]   and that's especially going to be hard in communication.
[00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.340]   Because you and your spouse are sinners,
[00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.540]   that's going to complicate the communication.
[00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.100]   Because you and your spouse are finite with sinful hearts, you're not infinite.
[00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.300]   You can't see what's coming around the next corner, only God can.
[00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.540]   You don't know what's going to happen in the next week.
[00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.420]   In a small home situation,
[00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.900]   you're eventually going to bump into each other,
[00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.220]   and that's going to cause problems.
[00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:44.940]   Because your heart has various cravings and desires that conflict,
[00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.500]   that's a problem.
[00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.460]   In fact, I do a whole series on biblical reconciliation.
[00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:55.580]   The world talks about peacemaking and conflict resolution.
[00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:00.500]   The Bible goes way beyond peacemaking and conflict resolution.
[00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:05.620]   It goes completely to full and complete reconciliation,
[00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.860]   sweet harmony within relationships better than ever before.
[00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.380]   That's way different than just peacemaking.
[00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:21.860]   It's way different than just finding some kind of conflict resolution.
[00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:23.700]   It goes way beyond that.
[00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.260]   Grab your Bible just for a moment.
[00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.180]   I want you to go over to James Chapter 1.
[00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:37.780]   Excuse me, James Chapter 4 and verse 1.
[00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.140]   James asks the question,
[00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:44.580]   "What causes quarrels and what causes fights among you?"
[00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.380]   That's a great question.
[00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.460]   "What causes quarrels and what causes fights among you?"
[00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.620]   Now, the typical everyday Christian in America today would
[00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.100]   probably answer that question by saying, "Well,
[00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:02.860]   I'm a sanguine and I'm married to a caloric,
[00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:08.260]   and men are from Mars and women are from Venus."
[00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.380]   Well, you know.
[00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:14.660]   That's the reason why there's so many conflicts.
[00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:18.380]   Well, the Bible has a word for that, baloney.
[00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:21.940]   That's not true. That's not what causes conflicts.
[00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.820]   It's not the differences in personality, not at all.
[00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:29.180]   Personality has nothing to do with conflict.
[00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.060]   There is no such thing as
[00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:36.700]   specific people having adversarial personalities.
[00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:39.340]   No such thing. Nowhere in the Bible does it ever say that.
[00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:45.100]   In fact, the Bible really defines all of us as having an adversarial personality.
[00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:47.180]   Every single one of us.
[00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:51.820]   It's not as if some people are worse at it than other people.
[00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:54.020]   We all have the problem.
[00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.820]   What is it that really causes fights and quarrels among you?
[00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:59.100]   Notice what he says.
[00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:04.900]   He says, "Is it not that your passions are at war within you?"
[00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:06.780]   The you there is plural,
[00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:07.940]   not just within you,
[00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:11.980]   but the passion in you singular is at war with
[00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:18.060]   the passions of other people in their heart and those passions conflict.
[00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:23.780]   See, I want something and my wife wants something different,
[00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:26.020]   and those collide.
[00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:31.260]   Those desires and those wants collide.
[00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:38.460]   They rise to idolatrous level loss in my heart.
[00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:43.640]   I'm willing to go to war for what I want,
[00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:49.620]   and that's when it's risen to an idolatrous level of lust in my life.
[00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:52.060]   What is it that causes fights and quarrels among us?
[00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:58.540]   Isn't it those desires that do battle that start in our heart?
[00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:03.580]   Verse 2 says, "You desire and you do not have, so you murder."
[00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:05.780]   Now, I don't think James was saying that the Christians
[00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:08.820]   were literally going around murdering each other.
[00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:12.700]   I don't think he's using murder in the same sense that Jesus used murder in
[00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:15.340]   Matthew chapter 5 where he says,
[00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:18.380]   "If you hate in your heart,
[00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:22.300]   the heart of a hater and the heart of a murderer is the same heart.
[00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:25.180]   It's just that one has acted it out and the other one hasn't."
[00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:27.540]   The heart of a hater, the heart of a murderer,
[00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:31.580]   same heart, it's just that one has acted it out and the other one hasn't.
[00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:33.940]   There's the problem.
[00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:38.700]   Well, you come to LA,
[00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:40.780]   you drive down the 405 in LA.
[00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:41.820]   If you've ever been there before,
[00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:45.220]   it's the busiest road in the entire United States.
[00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:48.940]   They call it a freeway,
[00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:51.340]   but it's not a freeway, it's a parking lot.
[00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:54.700]   It's just endless cars forever and ever,
[00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:58.900]   and they sell there in LA these little things in these auto shops.
[00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:03.180]   You can buy them, you can mount them on your dashboard for heavy traffic.
[00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:04.740]   You get in heavy traffic,
[00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:07.860]   you're stopped there and you mount this thing on your dashboard,
[00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:09.660]   and it has little buttons on it,
[00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:11.740]   and one button says missile,
[00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:13.380]   the other one says machine gun,
[00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:17.580]   the other one says grenade launcher.
[00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:25.660]   You can sit there in traffic and blow up the cars in front of you figuratively.
[00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:34.300]   It's supposed to make the driver feel better in doing that.
[00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:39.940]   This is ritualistic murder is what it is.
[00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:47.180]   This is what the heart of a hater and the heart of a murderer is the same heart.
[00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:49.740]   It's just that one has acted it out and the other one hasn't.
[00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:50.980]   You're in my way,
[00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:56.460]   so I want to remove you out of my way even if it means blowing you up.
[00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:59.700]   I'm going to move you out of my way.
[00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:01.740]   This is the problem,
[00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:06.620]   and this is what happens in a Christian home,
[00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:11.820]   where these desires and passions rise to idolatrous level.
[00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:13.060]   I mean, I'll have guys,
[00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:14.500]   they'll say to me, "Listen,
[00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:18.380]   all I want is for my wife to respect me.
[00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:19.660]   Is that so bad?"
[00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:22.020]   No, on one level, it's not bad at all.
[00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:23.540]   Can it become bad?
[00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:25.580]   Yes, absolutely, it could become bad.
[00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:29.900]   Why? Because that desire that starts off very legitimately,
[00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:32.540]   now I just want my wife to respect me,
[00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:36.260]   now has become an idolatrous desire in his heart,
[00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:40.060]   so that when he doesn't receive the respect that he really deserves,
[00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:44.140]   this is more important than being God's kind of man and God's kind of husband.
[00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:46.100]   I want her to respect me.
[00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:47.820]   That's the more important thing.
[00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:51.740]   That's the thing I bow down to every day as an idol in my heart.
[00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:53.980]   When I don't receive it, then I become hateful,
[00:09:53.980 --> 00:10:00.060]   angry, disrespectful, or I withdraw and become sullen,
[00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:02.460]   and depressed, and moody.
[00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:08.780]   All of those are sinful responses because that desire to have her respect me,
[00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:12.540]   has risen to an idolatrous desire in my heart.
[00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:14.580]   Now, I act out,
[00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:18.900]   and now I am going to make her life miserable,
[00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:21.340]   because I'm not getting what I want.
[00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:23.300]   My desires are ruling me.
[00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:26.180]   Or I've had so many women say to me,
[00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:29.860]   "Listen, Dr. Street, all I want is for my husband to love me.
[00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:30.940]   Is that wrong?"
[00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:33.060]   No, it's not wrong.
[00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:35.460]   Can it become wrong?
[00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:38.180]   Yes, it can become an idolatrous desire in your life.
[00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:40.460]   It starts off as a very legitimate desire,
[00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:42.340]   but it soon becomes idolatrous.
[00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:44.540]   It becomes more important than being God's kind of woman,
[00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:46.900]   and God's kind of wife in her life.
[00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:49.540]   That idolatrous desire rules her,
[00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:53.340]   so much so that it's the first thing she thinks about when she gets up in the morning.
[00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:56.120]   It's the last thing she thinks about before she goes to bed at night.
[00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:57.820]   "My husband doesn't love me.
[00:10:57.820 --> 00:10:58.780]   She doesn't love me.
[00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:00.580]   He doesn't love me. He doesn't love me."
[00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:08.340]   And as a result of that, then she becomes hateful, angry, mean.
[00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:11.500]   She becomes caustic in her words.
[00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:17.220]   Or she withdraws, becomes sullen, depressed,
[00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:21.980]   because she's not receiving the love that she thinks that she deserves in that marriage.
[00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:24.260]   That's when that desire has become.
[00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:27.420]   It starts off as a very legitimate desire,
[00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:31.520]   and then it becomes a ruling, dominating desire in her life.
[00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:36.660]   It becomes more important in her life than being God's kind of woman.
[00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:38.360]   And it rules her.
[00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:42.140]   It dominates her thinking.
[00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:44.460]   This is what James is talking about.
[00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:47.340]   What is it that causes fights and quarrels among you?
[00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:52.900]   Isn't it these passions that do battle deep inside?
[00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:57.860]   Things that I want that may actually start off as very legitimate desires,
[00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:01.140]   but then they become ungodly desires?
[00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:03.540]   I've seen parents, Christian parents, do that.
[00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:07.540]   "Oh, I so want my children to come to Christ."
[00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:09.020]   Is that a good desire?
[00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:10.020]   Absolutely.
[00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:13.540]   Can it become an idolatrous, ungodly, sinful desire?
[00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:14.540]   Absolutely.
[00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:19.100]   When it becomes more important than being God's kind of mom or dad.
[00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:24.860]   And when I don't see my kids kneeling their knee to Christ,
[00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:29.420]   when I don't see them surrendering their life to Jesus as Lord and Savior,
[00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:33.700]   then I become angry, hateful, mean, vindictive,
[00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:37.140]   or I withdraw and become depressed and sullen,
[00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:40.420]   and I refuse to communicate any longer.
[00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:44.700]   Then I know that that desire that starts off as a very legitimate desire
[00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:47.740]   now has risen to an idolatrous desire.
[00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:52.140]   It's something that I bow down to every day as my idol,
[00:12:52.140 --> 00:13:00.300]   and I refuse to be a godly mother or a godly father if I don't get what I want.
[00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:01.660]   Wow.
[00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:02.780]   Wow.
[00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:06.100]   What is it that causes fights and quarrels among you?
[00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:11.260]   Isn't it these desires and passions that do battle inside
[00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:15.460]   that wreck your life and wreck your relationships?
[00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:19.260]   You're willing to go to war for those things?
[00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:26.180]   Oh, God never intended the Christian home to be that way, never.
[00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:30.180]   But sin has turned it into that.
[00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:32.620]   Communication in the home is critical here.
[00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:35.980]   Good marriages and loving relationships can be built by couples
[00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:39.540]   who are committed to being God's kind of husband and wife.
[00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:43.020]   So if you take to heart biblical principles, communication,
[00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:48.100]   your marriage can begin improving today, but you've got to be sincere
[00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:50.260]   in your desire to do things God's way.
[00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:55.500]   That means He defines what is best for your marriage, not you.
[00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:56.500]   Take your Bible.
[00:13:56.500 --> 00:14:01.420]   Let's go over to Ephesians chapter 4.
[00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:07.060]   Ephesians chapter 4, and we're especially going to be interested in verses 25-34.
[00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:12.260]   We have four rules of communication we want to highlight for you.
[00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:17.700]   And oftentimes, when I'm using these in counseling, I'll say to the husbands,
[00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:22.460]   "Guys, I want you to take copious notes about what we're going to learn here
[00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:25.700]   because you're going to go home and you're going to teach everybody in the family
[00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:27.540]   these four rules of communication.
[00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:32.220]   So you've got to be able to know them well enough to be able to teach them."
[00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:36.140]   And I'll tell the gals, "Listen, I want you to listen to these.
[00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:39.620]   Write down the four rules of communication, and I want you to figure out a way
[00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:43.020]   to display these four rules of communication in your home."
[00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:47.260]   Some women are incredibly creative doing this, all right?
[00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:53.140]   They'll cross-stitch the four rules of communication and put them in nice frames,
[00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:58.420]   and others will run them off on a computer and tape them all over the place.
[00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:04.460]   But the key is these four rules of communication are really key to communicating
[00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:10.580]   in a godly way within your home from Ephesians chapter 4, verses 25 through 32.
[00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:17.740]   Now, before we get there, let me take a look real quickly at the preceding context
[00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:22.020]   because we know that a text without a context is a pretext for a proof text, right?
[00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:29.300]   The preceding context of Ephesians 4 says this in verse 22, "To put off the old self,
[00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:34.420]   which belongs to your former manner of life and is corrupt through deceitful desires,
[00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:38.620]   and to be renewed in the spirit of your minds, and to put on the new self created
[00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:42.700]   after the likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness."
[00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:49.060]   In other words, here, before he talks about these four rules of communication,
[00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:55.380]   before he talks about how we should communicate in the Christian life,
[00:15:55.380 --> 00:16:01.740]   he says real change in the Christian life is always two-factored.
[00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:12.580]   It has to do with putting off bad things, putting on good things, and then to be renewed,
[00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:15.740]   this is what we call a present passive, that's what God does.
[00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:22.100]   God gives us a renewed mind, verse 23, a renewed attitude towards these things,
[00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:28.780]   but we have to put off the old self, the old sinful practices of communication,
[00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:33.260]   and put on the new godly practices of communication.
[00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:37.060]   This is a very deliberate effort you have to make.
[00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:39.900]   This is not going to happen automatically.
[00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:44.020]   And you may think you're already doing this, and in some cases you may be,
[00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:48.500]   but in most cases you're probably not.
[00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:56.780]   So it's going to take deliberate willful action on your part to change.
[00:16:56.780 --> 00:17:01.940]   I like to teach this in counseling by saying, you remember that old joke kids used to say,
[00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:05.100]   "When is a door no longer a door?"
[00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:07.060]   When it's a jar, all right?
[00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:09.500]   Well, you use that as a paradigm.
[00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:14.380]   When is a liar no longer a liar?
[00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:18.740]   Or when is a thief no longer a thief?
[00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:24.500]   Or when is a sexually immoral person no longer a sexually immoral person?
[00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:28.260]   Most people in the world says, "Well, a liar is no longer a liar when he stops lying."
[00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:31.940]   Or a thief is no longer a thief when he stops stealing.
[00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:37.780]   No, that's not true, that's just a thief between jobs, all right?
[00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:38.860]   No.
[00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:42.980]   Or a sexually immoral person is no longer sexually immoral when he stops being sexually
[00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:43.980]   immoral.
[00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:47.780]   No, that's not true either.
[00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:49.980]   When is a liar no longer a liar?
[00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:55.380]   When he begins to habitually tell the truth.
[00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:57.180]   When is a thief no longer a thief?
[00:17:57.180 --> 00:17:59.060]   Well, look at verse 28.
[00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:05.100]   He answers this question, "Let the thief no longer steal, but rather let him labor doing
[00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:09.260]   honest work with his own hands so that he may have something to share with anyone who
[00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:10.340]   has need."
[00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:15.820]   So a thief is still a thief until he's working enough to supply for himself and he has enough
[00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:19.060]   left over to give away to people who have need.
[00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:21.580]   That's when a thief has stopped being a thief.
[00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:25.120]   Just because a person's not stealing doesn't mean that they're not a thief.
[00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:29.260]   Just because a person's not telling a lie at that point doesn't mean that they're not
[00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:30.420]   a liar.
[00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:35.580]   When that liar begins to habitually put on the truth, when the thief begins to habitually
[00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:41.700]   work hard to supply for himself as well as for other people, then he has stopped being
[00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:43.500]   a thief.
[00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:49.500]   So permanent change in the Christian life is not getting rid of sin, it is getting rid
[00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:57.540]   of sin and replacing it consciously, actively with practiced righteousness.
[00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:05.700]   So if you're going to practice new rules of communication in your home, you have to practice
[00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:07.900]   righteousness.
[00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:10.860]   You have to deliberately, willfully do it.
[00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:17.500]   Stop the sinful, ungodly things you're doing and saying and replace it with godly things.
[00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:19.660]   Sometimes it's like riding a bike for the first time.
[00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:23.940]   You probably remember when you first learned how to ride a bike and you were shaky and
[00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:33.140]   you fell off, but then eventually as you practice new habits in your life, then they become
[00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:35.220]   more natural as time goes on.
[00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:37.720]   It's going to seem awkward.
[00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:43.780]   It's going to seem really awkward at first, but it doesn't have to be, because in the
[00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:47.460]   long run there's going to be sweetness down the line.
[00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:55.140]   When you practice God's rules of communication, there is always going to be sweetness there.
[00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:59.820]   So let's look at this, Ephesians 4 verse 25.
[00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:05.860]   This is rule number one, "Therefore, having put away falsehood, let each one of you speak
[00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:10.660]   the truth with his neighbor, for we are members of one another."
[00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:12.780]   Now let's look at this very carefully.
[00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:17.340]   Rule number one is this, "Be honest."
[00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:20.900]   That's rule number one, be honest.
[00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:25.260]   Now let me explain to you what I mean by that, and you've got to look at this verse carefully
[00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:27.420]   to understand this.
[00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:31.420]   He says, "You've got to speak."
[00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:36.000]   That's an important word because it means you speak up.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.140]   You must speak up with the truth.
[00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:40.260]   Why?
[00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:44.140]   People cannot read your mind.
[00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:49.620]   So that tells me that clamming up is out for the Christian.
[00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:53.940]   But that's the first thing that we do when we get into an argument, we'll clam up.
[00:20:53.940 --> 00:21:00.140]   "Okay, I'm not going to give her the privilege of my keen insight."
[00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:01.140]   We just clam up.
[00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:04.800]   We don't say anything anymore.
[00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:06.380]   That's not an option.
[00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:12.500]   For Christians in communication, there's no option to clam up, no option to give them
[00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:15.100]   the silent treatment.
[00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:16.600]   That's not our purpose.
[00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:20.020]   We have to speak, verse 25 says.
[00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:24.940]   "Having put away falsehood, let each one of you speak," he says.
[00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:29.180]   And then he says, "We've got to speak the truth."
[00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:30.840]   We have to speak the truth.
[00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:32.500]   This is really key.
[00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:35.940]   Speaking the truth here is a verb that involves continuous action.
[00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:41.260]   It's in the present tense, so it's something that should be regularly going on all of the
[00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:42.260]   time.
[00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:47.700]   We must continually speak the truth, not any falsehood at all.
[00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:50.820]   It's to be the new lifestyle in your marriage.
[00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:55.700]   David said you must speak the truth from a heart of integrity, Psalm 15.2, not deceptively
[00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:59.660]   or with disguised, hidden, or double meanings.
[00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:02.780]   We have to speak the truth.
[00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:04.660]   This is really important.
[00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:06.980]   Now why is this so important?
[00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:12.900]   Because we have so many deceitful ways to get around the truth.
[00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:21.460]   The human heart is almost limitless in its ability to be able to conjure up ways of getting
[00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:24.420]   around the truth.
[00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:30.140]   You ever watch court sessions on TV, and the way that people try to get around when they're
[00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:35.300]   confronted with the truth, oh, they're elaborate.
[00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:39.980]   They think up all kinds of elaborate schemes and all kinds of elaborate exceptions, and
[00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:43.260]   your heart is no different.
[00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:45.580]   We as Christians have got to be different.
[00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:48.040]   We've got to be different from everybody in the world.
[00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:50.020]   In our homes, we've got to be different.
[00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:51.420]   We have to speak the truth.
[00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:57.060]   Let me give you some examples of the way that you may be dishonest in your speech.
[00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:01.940]   There's outright dishonesty, which is a deliberate lie, falsification, or denial of truth.
[00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:09.100]   That's obviously, then you're in sin, and you're not being truthful in what you're saying.
[00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:11.260]   When that's the case, God understands that.
[00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:12.420]   He sees it.
[00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:17.420]   Even though your husband or your wife may not know that you're being deceitful, God
[00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:18.420]   knows.
[00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:21.660]   He always knows every time that you do that.
[00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:23.880]   But there's even more sophisticated ways.
[00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:27.860]   For example, there's incongruities, where your speech is inconsistent with your halo
[00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:30.100]   data or your nonverbal communication.
[00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:32.460]   Now, what do I mean by that?
[00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:41.960]   Well, sometimes we can say such nice things in such wicked ways, right?
[00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:47.720]   It's like the husband who says to his wife, "Oh, I love you."
[00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:52.480]   Now if you send her a text message of the exact words he said, she'd probably look at
[00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:53.480]   it and say, "Oh, isn't that sweet?
[00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:54.480]   He said he loves me."
[00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:57.640]   But that's not the message that he really got.
[00:23:57.640 --> 00:23:59.340]   He was acting disgusted.
[00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:04.440]   All of his halo data, his nonverbal communication says the opposite.
[00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:11.040]   In fact, communicologists tell us that 93% of all of our meaning come from the nonverbals,
[00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:13.880]   not from the word sources we use.
[00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:20.240]   That means our eyes, our facial expressions, the tone of our voice, the way we are looking
[00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:26.960]   at someone communicates more meaning than what we're really saying.
[00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:29.040]   "I love you."
[00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:31.120]   All right, really?
[00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:32.120]   Really?
[00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:33.800]   No, he doesn't.
[00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:36.760]   He's being disgusted by it.
[00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:44.080]   This is what the sinful human heart does, where your speech is inconsistent with your
[00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:46.160]   halo data.
[00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:50.580]   Everything in your nonverbal says just the opposite.
[00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:52.400]   That's not the way it should be.
[00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:53.760]   What about this?
[00:24:53.760 --> 00:25:02.160]   There's disguised communication like innuendos, insinuations, or implied accusations.
[00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:03.240]   That's disguised.
[00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:09.320]   We imply certain things, but we always leave a back door that we can slip out of in case
[00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:11.040]   somebody really confronts us.
[00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:14.460]   So we imply somebody has done something wrong.
[00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:18.280]   Our husband has done something wrong, or our wife has done something wrong.
[00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:23.800]   And then when they confront us with it, they say, "Oh, is that the way that you took it?
[00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:24.880]   Oh, no.
[00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:26.400]   Are you kidding me?
[00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:27.880]   No, no, no.
[00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:31.900]   Yeah, but that's exactly what you meant.
[00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:32.900]   That's that incoherent.
[00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:40.560]   You insinuated this was true, and you said it specifically that way to insinuate it to
[00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:46.840]   get the message across, and now you deny ever having said it that way.
[00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:47.840]   That's the way.
[00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:48.960]   That's falsification.
[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:56.460]   That's just as bad as lying when you use innuendos, insinuation, or implied accusations.
[00:25:56.460 --> 00:26:02.800]   So we're seeing here that honesty is more than just not lying.
[00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:06.240]   It's being open and honest with the truth.
[00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:10.880]   If you're really going to be honest, you've got to be open and honest with the truth.
[00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:13.420]   That's really key.
[00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:18.320]   It's an attitude of the heart that you've got to have, being honest.
[00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:22.640]   Colossians 3.9 says, "Do not lie to one another since you laid aside the old self with its
[00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:23.640]   evil practices."
[00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:31.520]   Well, now, I've had some guys say to me in counseling, "Well, you know what, Dr. Street?
[00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:33.040]   I was honest with her.
[00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:35.320]   I gave her a piece of my mind."
[00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:40.120]   He didn't realize how small I viewed his mind to be, and it felt like saying, "Don't give
[00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:41.120]   her any more pieces.
[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:46.960]   You won't have anything left."
[00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:54.160]   And so we know that he spoke, and he spoke the truth, but earlier in this chapter, Paul
[00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:59.560]   has already said that we're supposed to speak the truth in love.
[00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:02.560]   In love in verse 15.
[00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:03.840]   What do we mean by that?
[00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:08.000]   Well, some people sometimes can be brutal with the truth.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:13.600]   Sure they spoke the truth, but they beat the other person into the ground with the truth.
[00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:14.800]   You can do that with your wife.
[00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:16.480]   You can do that with your husband.
[00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:21.560]   You can tell the truth, but you beat them into the ground with the truth.
[00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:23.320]   That's not loving at all.
[00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:26.660]   We're supposed to speak the truth in love.
[00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:32.000]   If you speak the truth in spite and anger, then you're not being loving.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:37.440]   If you speak without forethought concerning the person that you're speaking to or about,
[00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:39.520]   that's not godly either.
[00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:44.080]   Christians are to speak the truth of the other person's best interest in mind.
[00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:47.640]   In other words, what is my wife's best interest?
[00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:50.480]   How can I speak the truth with her best interest in mind?
[00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:52.940]   What is my husband's best interest?
[00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:56.280]   How can I speak the truth with his best interest in mind?
[00:27:56.280 --> 00:28:02.120]   It's not about me getting this off my chest, it is about them.
[00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:05.640]   It's about how I can speak this for their benefit.
[00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:09.560]   Now, that doesn't mean they're automatically going to receive it, but I've got to do my
[00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:14.120]   best to say it in as loving way as I can.
[00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:15.520]   This is key.
[00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:21.400]   I love Colossians 4:6, "Let your speech," it says here, "always be with grace, seasoned
[00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:26.400]   as it were with salt, so that you may know how you should respond to each other."
[00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:27.520]   Why is that so key?
[00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:32.880]   He compares gracious speech to salt.
[00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:36.800]   Now, why is there a comparison between gracious speech and salt?
[00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:41.760]   Well, back in ancient times, they knew that salt preserves food, but they also knew something
[00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:46.880]   that we know in our day and age, that salty foods create what?
[00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:48.840]   Thirst, right?
[00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:52.340]   Yeah, gracious words do the same thing.
[00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:56.280]   Gracious words create thirst.
[00:28:56.280 --> 00:29:03.880]   When you say things graciously, people will want to hear more.
[00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:04.880]   That's the key.
[00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:11.040]   You heard what the young farmer said to the old farmer, "Well, you know, you can lead
[00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:14.120]   a horse to water, but you can't make him drink."
[00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:23.500]   And the old farmer said, "Well, that's true, but you can sure salt his oats.
[00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:26.160]   You can make him want to drink."
[00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:31.880]   Well, that's what you do when you use gracious speech.
[00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:40.760]   You salt your words with gracious speech that even though your spouse disagrees with you,
[00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:44.680]   they want to hear more, all right?
[00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:53.800]   You said it so lovingly that they say, "Oh, you know, I don't agree with that, but I want
[00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:56.760]   to hear more.
[00:29:56.760 --> 00:30:02.040]   I want to hear more, bring it on, come on.
[00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:09.280]   You said it so nice, you were so sweet, and the way that you said that, I don't agree,
[00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:14.360]   but it was so good," when the opposite's the case, right?
[00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:18.440]   We say it, we speak the truth, but we speak the truth in anger.
[00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:20.440]   We speak the truth in bitterness.
[00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:25.840]   We speak the truth because we want them to hurt the way we think we have been hurt, and
[00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:28.120]   that just destroys everything in a Christian home.
[00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:31.520]   Then we act no different than people in the world.
[00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:35.360]   We're supposed to speak the truth, but we're supposed to speak the truth in love.
[00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:36.360]   That's really key.
[00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:40.520]   The first rule of communication is be honest.
[00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:42.200]   Be honest.
[00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:43.880]   That's really key.
[00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:45.360]   There's a second rule.
[00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:52.280]   Look at verse 26 and 27, "Be angry and do not sin.
[00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:58.720]   Do not let the sun go down on your anger, and give no opportunity to the devil."
[00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:00.200]   So rule number one, be honest.
[00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:03.560]   Rule number two, keep current.
[00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:04.840]   Keep current.
[00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:06.040]   This is really important.
[00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:07.040]   Why?
[00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:12.680]   Well, sometimes it's possible to be righteously angry.
[00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:13.880]   God gets angry.
[00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:17.120]   The psalmist says God is angry every day.
[00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:19.320]   Jesus became angry.
[00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:20.480]   Not all anger is sin.
[00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:24.040]   He overturned the tables and the money changers in the temple.
[00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:25.080]   Jesus became angry.
[00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:27.880]   That was righteous anger.
[00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:32.920]   But you can be righteously angry, and I know you think all of your anger is righteous when
[00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:45.480]   probably only 1.0000001% of it is, but I know you think all the rest of it is righteous.
[00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:46.480]   We're not like Jesus.
[00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:48.120]   We're not perfect in our anger.
[00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:55.400]   And so as a result of that, even our righteous anger can become quickly sinful anger if we
[00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:59.600]   let the sun go down on our anger.
[00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:01.080]   Let the sun go down on our anger.
[00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:05.600]   I'll never forget working with a couple one day, and we were talking about this, and the
[00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:10.080]   husband just kind of looked at me and says, "Well, then we're going to move to Alaska."
[00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:14.840]   Went right over my head.
[00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:16.320]   Alaska?
[00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:17.800]   She caught on before I did.
[00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:24.080]   "Well, you know how the sun in the summer shines 23 out of 24 hours, and he wants to
[00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:26.520]   hold on to his anger against me?"
[00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:29.800]   Now I gave him points for creativity.
[00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:32.200]   But I said, "That's not what this means.
[00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:35.560]   It means deal with your anger ASAP."
[00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:44.000]   This is a Semitic colloquialism, which means deal with your anger as soon as possible.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:49.880]   Don't let a day go by without dealing with that day's anger is the idea.
[00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:57.280]   All anger is not sin, self-centered anger is sin, and it's always sin.
[00:32:57.280 --> 00:33:03.440]   And a failure to deal with that day's anger that day means at least four things.
[00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:05.160]   Number one, it means you're guilty of sin.
[00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:06.160]   That's pretty obvious.
[00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:12.200]   And remember, one of the reasons we're here at this marriage retreat is to learn how to
[00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:16.720]   turn all of our negative emotions and hate upon those sins.
[00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:17.720]   That's why we're here.
[00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:21.960]   So we're guilty of sin if we're holding on to something and we're not dealing with it
[00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:23.080]   every day.
[00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:29.480]   Secondly, you open the way to resentment and bitterness, because now you begin to view
[00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:33.240]   your spouse through colored glasses.
[00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:40.080]   It's colored by the anger and the resentment that you have towards them that has not been
[00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:41.080]   dealt with.
[00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:46.760]   And so now everything in their life, by looking through those glasses, everything in their
[00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:50.560]   life looks distorted and wrong to you.
[00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:55.240]   And you're picking out little things now, because this is unresolved in your own heart
[00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:58.580]   and you're looking at them through colored glasses.
[00:33:58.580 --> 00:34:02.880]   In addition to that, you distort subsequent problems.
[00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:05.400]   This is what I call spiritual gunny-sacking.
[00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:08.040]   You know what gunny-sacks are?
[00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:09.920]   It's an old hunting term.
[00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:15.040]   They used to have big burlap bags when they'd go hunting, and they'd shoot a bird or a rabbit
[00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:19.240]   for food, and they'd throw it in the burlap bag, and they'd go hunting the rest of the
[00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:21.000]   day and shoot a few more and throw it in the bag.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:25.040]   At the end of the day, they'd empty their bag out, they'd process all of that and cut
[00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:29.840]   it into meat and cook it or salt it or whatever the case may be back in old times.
[00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:34.000]   That's exactly what people do with wrongs and offenses that have been done against them.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.160]   They gunny-sack them.
[00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:36.480]   You can't see it, but they're there.
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:40.480]   All right, here's an offense my husband did against me, and I threw it in a gunny-sack.
[00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:42.280]   There's another offense, and I throw that in a gunny-sack.
[00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:43.280]   I don't deal with it.
[00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:45.400]   Another one, I throw that in a gunny-sack, another one.
[00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:49.400]   This gunny-sack's getting bigger and bigger and bigger, and we carry it around all the
[00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:50.880]   time on our back.
[00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:56.560]   And then our husband finally does something relatively small, not a big thing, but you
[00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:58.160]   don't like it.
[00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:02.020]   And you choose that particular time to empty your gunny-sack.
[00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:06.640]   And so you pull your gunny-sack out, and you empty all of it out, and they're going, "Whoa,
[00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:08.720]   whoa, what is the problem?
[00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:09.760]   What is going on?"
[00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:11.840]   And you say, "It's not what you've done.
[00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:15.280]   It's who you are that's the problem."
[00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:17.320]   And he's going, "Whoa."
[00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:22.080]   And now you don't remember any of the specifics of all those things that have gone wrong anymore
[00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:24.000]   because they happened so far in the past.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.960]   All you know is that you have good reason to be angry.
[00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:29.560]   That's all you know.
[00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:31.520]   And now you can't solve anything.
[00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:35.180]   Now it's even worse than ever before.
[00:35:35.180 --> 00:35:38.880]   God never intended us to live that way.
[00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:39.880]   We distort.
[00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:44.120]   We're guilty of spiritual gunny-sacking.
[00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:48.600]   Don't let the sun go down on your anger.
[00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:51.400]   You have to keep current.
[00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:54.440]   It will affect you in so many negative ways.
[00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:58.680]   The fourth thing here is that it will endanger your physical relationship.
[00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:01.320]   Do you know why?
[00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:06.160]   Because nobody wants to go to bed and have sex with their problem.
[00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:08.200]   Nobody wants to do that.
[00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:13.080]   And you have become my problem, all right?
[00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:19.080]   That's because we have held all of this anger and bitterness for such a long period of time.
[00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:21.000]   We've not resolved it.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:25.520]   That person is a problem with two legs.
[00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:30.080]   They're just one big problem.
[00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:35.280]   And it's our fault because we're not dealing with these problems.
[00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:36.840]   We're choosing to ignore them.
[00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:40.160]   We're sweeping them under the rug.
[00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:46.000]   No, God says that should never be the case.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.280]   Number one, be honest.
[00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:51.180]   Number two, keep current.
[00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:58.960]   Number three, I want you to pick up in verse 29, "Let no corrupting talk come out of your
[00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:06.680]   mouths but only such as is good for building up as it fits the occasion that it may give
[00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:12.440]   grace to those who hear and do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God by whom you were sealed
[00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:14.280]   for the day of redemption."
[00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:17.080]   So be honest, keep current.
[00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:22.640]   Number three, attack the problem, not the person.
[00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:26.640]   Attack the problem, not the person.
[00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:28.540]   This is really important.
[00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:30.760]   Now take a look at this real carefully.
[00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:37.760]   When he says he refers to corrupt talk, it's really interesting.
[00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:42.100]   We have a very narrow view of corrupt talk.
[00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:50.360]   We think cursing, taking God's name in vain, swearing is corrupt talk, and it is, but it's
[00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:52.560]   a very, very narrow view.
[00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:54.600]   It's just a very narrow view.
[00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:57.360]   It's not very big at all.
[00:37:57.360 --> 00:38:02.880]   God's view of corrupt talk is huge.
[00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:09.440]   There's all kinds of corrupt talk that we do that goes way beyond swearing, cursing,
[00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:12.400]   or taking God's name in vain.
[00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:17.080]   Incidentally, that Greek word for corrupt is the word that means rotten.
[00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:21.880]   It was something in the first century Greek that they used to describe rotten fish.
[00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:28.080]   Something stinks more than rotten fish, but that's corrupt talk, and we have a tendency
[00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:34.840]   to think that only a small few things are really corrupt.
[00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:37.640]   What are these unwholesome, corrupt words?
[00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:41.560]   Well, they zero in on the person and their character.
[00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:43.460]   It's those kind of words.
[00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:48.100]   They tear down and demolish the other person.
[00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:54.200]   It's words like you always, you never, you turkey, you idiot, you dummy, you stupid,
[00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:55.200]   you dumbbell.
[00:38:55.200 --> 00:39:00.640]   We never let our kids use any of those terms and more, even though they're not technically
[00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:04.800]   swear words, they're not curse words, they're not taking God's name in vain, but what are
[00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:05.800]   they doing?
[00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:09.920]   They're attacking their brother or sister's character.
[00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:10.920]   That's what they're doing.
[00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:16.080]   When you use words like that, you're tearing people down.
[00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:17.860]   You're tearing your spouse down.
[00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:21.200]   You're not building them up at all.
[00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:24.000]   That's not what we should be doing.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:31.840]   We tend to label only curse words as unwholesome words, and that's a very narrow definition.
[00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:36.660]   God's definition is much broader than that.
[00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:39.840]   Those are the kind of things we have to get rid of.
[00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:47.000]   Those are the kind of things that we have to stop doing in our communication.
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:53.840]   Anything that zeros in on their person and zeros in on their character, I've got to stop
[00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:55.240]   talking.
[00:39:55.240 --> 00:40:01.640]   For some of us, we don't know how to talk except that way.
[00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:09.960]   For a while, we're going to be ... because I have to learn new ways to say things because
[00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:15.560]   almost every time I speak, I'm attacking somebody's character.
[00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:19.720]   Sometimes I think some people in counseling are going to explode.
[00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:20.720]   It's kind of building up.
[00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:21.720]   All right.
[00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:22.720]   End of thing.
[00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:23.720]   No, no.
[00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:28.200]   You've got to channel all that energy towards learning new ways to respond.
[00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:29.200]   What kind of words?
[00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:33.860]   He says here in this verse in verse 29 exactly what kind of words they need to be.
[00:40:33.860 --> 00:40:35.960]   These need to be edifying words.
[00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:42.040]   They are the type of words that build the other person up, that build the other person
[00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:43.240]   up.
[00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:47.140]   These are words that focus on the problem, not the person.
[00:40:47.140 --> 00:40:51.280]   They're selected in order to make it easy for two people to find a solution.
[00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:56.440]   They're solution-oriented words full of graciousness.
[00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:58.560]   That's what we're talking about.
[00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:07.480]   Like for instance, they always have a partner's welfare first and foremost in mind.
[00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:13.520]   So when you're thinking about your partner rather than thinking about you and their welfare
[00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:20.760]   first before your wants and your welfare, then it's going to be easier.
[00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:29.600]   For example, I disagree with what you've done, but I'm open to hear your side of the story.
[00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:31.920]   Now that's a creative way.
[00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:33.160]   That is a good way.
[00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:35.840]   I disagree.
[00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:41.200]   Now if you were to say that in your marriage, your spouse is liable to have a heart attack,
[00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:46.040]   who are you and what did you do with my husband or wife?
[00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:50.540]   But I'm interested in hearing your side of the story or words like this, "I want to find
[00:41:50.540 --> 00:41:56.240]   a solution to our problem that will be best for you and our home."
[00:41:56.240 --> 00:41:58.040]   Those are edifying words.
[00:41:58.040 --> 00:42:00.200]   They're intended to build up.
[00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:05.600]   They're not intended to tear another person down.
[00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:13.640]   I want to work through this with you so that Jesus Christ is honored in our marriage.
[00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:21.480]   I want to work with you so that Jesus Christ is honored in everything that we do.
[00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:24.640]   Can you imagine that in the midst?
[00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:26.720]   Think about your most heated conflict.
[00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:28.820]   Think about that for a moment.
[00:42:28.820 --> 00:42:34.880]   In saying these things in the midst of that, "You know, I don't fully agree with you, but
[00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:40.240]   I love you and I want to do our best to work on this for God's honor and glory.
[00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:42.240]   I want to do that with you."
[00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:47.400]   Oh my goodness, you're going to make it really hard for your spouse to hate you.
[00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:55.440]   You're going to make it really hard, and that's okay because that's the kind of words.
[00:42:55.440 --> 00:43:02.360]   Be honest, keep current, attack the problem, not the person.
[00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:05.400]   Attack the problem, not the person.
[00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:12.840]   Number four, the last one, I want you to look at this in verses 31 and 32.
[00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:17.600]   Verse 31 says, "Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away
[00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:23.400]   from you, along with all malice, be kind to one another and tenderhearted, forgiving one
[00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:29.120]   another as God in Christ forgave you."
[00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:36.120]   Be honest, keep current, attack the problem, not the person, and then fourth, act, don't
[00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:37.120]   react.
[00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:40.280]   Act, don't react.
[00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:44.280]   All the reactions are in verse 31.
[00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:46.100]   What are they?
[00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:50.560]   Reactions to problems are bitterness, are perpetual animosity that leads to harsh and
[00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:52.960]   unloving opinions about other people.
[00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:59.360]   Wrath, which the term there is outbursts of passionate rage, anger, which has to do with
[00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:06.520]   a subtle, deep-flowing anger, clamor, which is outcry and shouting, slander, speaking
[00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:10.320]   evil in other person that comes from some kind of settled indignation.
[00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:14.960]   You may say, "Okay, well, I understand that, but you know I'm not really bitter or wrathful
[00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:17.880]   or angry or clamorous or slanderous.
[00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:19.440]   That's just not me."
[00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:24.160]   Well, Paul understands what you're thinking at this point, and then he grabs a term, which
[00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:31.480]   is a big blanket that throws over a lot of things, along, he says in verse 31, "With
[00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:33.800]   all malice."
[00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:35.560]   What is malice?
[00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:43.400]   Malice is a general wishing of ill will towards someone else, a general wishing of ill will
[00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:44.800]   towards someone else.
[00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:51.560]   I've got to get rid of that as quickly as possible, a general wishing of ill will towards
[00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:53.880]   other people.
[00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:59.280]   That is maliceness that is in the heart.
[00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:04.080]   You know, it's like early in the morning, husband and wife get up for breakfast, and
[00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:13.280]   they have an argument, and they get into a conflict, and he runs out the door, slams
[00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:19.240]   the door, jumps in the car, spins out of the driveway, throwing real estate all over the
[00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:25.400]   place, goes screaming down the road, drives into traffic, goes weaving in and out of traffic,
[00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:31.560]   and all along he's thinking to himself, "I hope the children make her life miserable
[00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:33.200]   today."
[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:34.960]   That's malice.
[00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:40.080]   She's standing there doing the breakfast dishes, and she's thinking to herself, "I hope he
[00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:43.440]   has a horrible day at work."
[00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:50.680]   That's malice, a general wishing of ill will towards anyone else.
[00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:59.040]   That should never be a part of the Christian home or Christians in a marital relationship
[00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:02.920]   that's supposed to be a Christlike and loving relationship.
[00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:08.440]   All of those things have to be put off, but it's not enough to just merely put off those
[00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:13.080]   things, in addition, they have to put on three key things.
[00:46:13.080 --> 00:46:15.160]   Notice these things in verse 32.
[00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:17.200]   Number one, you've got to be kind.
[00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:23.800]   What's the most kind thing you can say or think or do for that person in the midst of
[00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:25.160]   that conflict?
[00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:29.000]   That means being useful, worthy, good, benevolent towards your spouse.
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:34.000]   What's the kindest thing I can say or think or do for them?
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:35.000]   Or tenderhearted.
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:37.540]   Literally, it means having healthy bowels.
[00:46:37.540 --> 00:46:40.340]   That has to do with emotions in the Bible.
[00:46:40.340 --> 00:46:44.680]   They're the seat of emotions and attention, therefore, it means being compassionate.
[00:46:44.680 --> 00:46:51.880]   What's the most compassionate thing I can say or think or do in the midst of this conflict?
[00:46:51.880 --> 00:46:53.800]   What's the most compassionate thing?
[00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:55.960]   And then last of all, forgiving.
[00:46:55.960 --> 00:46:59.520]   That is to exercise grace and releasing the offense of your spouse.
[00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:04.440]   This includes the willingness from the heart, Mark 11:25, the verbal granting of forgiveness
[00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:09.360]   when repentance has taken place, which is often we refer to as transactional forgiveness
[00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:12.240]   in Luke 17, verses 3 and 4.
[00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:13.560]   There has to be that.
[00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:20.360]   What's the most forgiving thing I can say or think or do for my spouse?
[00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:27.200]   When that becomes automatic in your relationships, then you know that you've changed.
[00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:34.280]   When you've created brand new habit of righteousness, when you've created that, then you know that
[00:47:34.280 --> 00:47:35.280]   you've changed.
[00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:36.280]   What is a habit?
[00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:38.480]   There's three characteristics of a habit.
[00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:42.360]   It's comfortable, it's automatic, and it's unconscious.
[00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:45.700]   It's comfortable, it's automatic, and it's unconscious.
[00:47:45.700 --> 00:47:52.400]   So you have sinful habits that you have to break, and you have to replace them with righteous
[00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:57.680]   habits of speaking, of talking, of interacting.
[00:47:57.680 --> 00:48:01.360]   And those have to be...
[00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:02.360]   You really haven't changed.
[00:48:02.360 --> 00:48:06.940]   You haven't really created a brand new habit until it's comfortable, it's automatic, and
[00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:08.880]   it's unconscious in your life.
[00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:15.360]   When you are comfortable being kind, tenderhearted, and forgiving, when you are unconsciously
[00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:25.720]   are kind, tenderhearted, and forgiving, when it's automatic and unconscious when you're
[00:48:25.720 --> 00:48:28.600]   kind, tenderhearted, and forgiving, then you've really changed.
[00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:30.540]   Then you have new habits.
[00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:36.560]   But until you are doing that in an automatic way, you haven't changed.
[00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:38.960]   So there's four rules of communication, right?
[00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:42.320]   Four rules in Ephesians 4, 25 through 32.
[00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:49.600]   Be honest, keep current, attack the problem, not the person, act, don't react, all right?
[00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:51.360]   Ready for a quiz?
[00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:52.360]   Ready for a quiz?
[00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:53.360]   Look at me, not at your notes.
[00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:54.360]   Look at me.
[00:48:54.360 --> 00:48:55.360]   Here we go.
[00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:56.800]   I'll prompt you a little bit here.
[00:48:56.800 --> 00:48:57.960]   Four rules of communication.
[00:48:57.960 --> 00:49:01.520]   We're going to go home and start practicing these today.
[00:49:01.520 --> 00:49:03.540]   We're going to begin changes now.
[00:49:03.540 --> 00:49:10.600]   Number one, be honest, keep current, attack the problem, not the person.
[00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:12.920]   Don't get those mixed up.
[00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:15.800]   Act, don't react, all right?
[00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:25.320]   One more time, be honest, keep current, attack the problem, not the person, act, don't react,
[00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:29.120]   not the person, pastor, they're good learners, all right?
[00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:30.120]   They're good learners.
[00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:34.920]   Let's bow for prayer and then we have lunch and you look like you're hungry.
[00:49:34.920 --> 00:49:38.920]   I'm being honest.
[00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:41.240]   Dear Father, we thank you so much for your word.
[00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:43.920]   We thank you for the clarity of your word.
[00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:49.280]   If this is what is practiced in the home, there will be radical changes that occur in
[00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:53.400]   our homes for the good, for your honor and glory.
[00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:58.160]   May the homes that are represented here today uplift the testimony of Jesus Christ in a
[00:49:58.160 --> 00:50:03.080]   supreme way throughout this town, throughout this community, throughout this state, throughout
[00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:04.380]   our country.
[00:50:04.380 --> 00:50:06.840]   This we pray in Christ's name, amen.
