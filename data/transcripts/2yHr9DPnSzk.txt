[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.840]   What's your opinion on my bird here, Mr. Parrot?
[00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:07.720]   - It's a macaw, Scarlet macaw.
[00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:08.560]   - What?
[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.280]   - It is a Scarlet macaw.
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:11.560]   - Oh, you know birds?
[00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:15.880]   - Yeah, and that's actually not life-sized.
[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.680]   - Are you saying he's not real?
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.360]   - I'm saying it's not to scale.
[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.440]   - Okay, but he's real.
[00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.360]   - Are we doing that Monty Python sketch?
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.080]   (both laughing)
[00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.560]   - Everything is a Monty Python sketch.
[00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.200]   - I don't think Monty Python's funny.
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.760]   - You don't? - At all.
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.040]   - That explains so much.
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.880]   - Does it?
[00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:32.720]   What does it explain?
[00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:33.560]   - What do you think is funny?
[00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.320]   (both laughing)
[00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.840]   - You're not answering that question, it's pretty funny.
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.960]   - Well, yeah, what do you think is funny?
[00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.600]   Having a mantis shrimp?
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.560]   - No.
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.200]   - You think Big Lebowski's funny?
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.080]   - Oh God, no.
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.200]   - This is getting worse and worse.
[00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.560]   The following is a conversation with Michael Malice,
[00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.440]   anarchist and author of "Dear Reader,"
[00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.000]   "The New Right," "The Anarchist Handbook,"
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.520]   "The White Pill," and he is the host of the podcast,
[00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:04.480]   You're Welcome.
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.960]   This is a Thanksgiving special of the pirate
[00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.840]   and ocean-going variety.
[00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.000]   So once again, let me say thank you for listening today
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.600]   and for being part of this wild journey with me.
[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.560]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.560]   To support it, please check out our sponsors
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.840]   in the description.
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.480]   And now, dear friends, here's Michael Malice.
[00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.640]   (silence)
[00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.040]   - The box?
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.880]   - Yeah.
[00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:36.800]   - The mystery box? - I'm wondering what's in it.
[00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.200]   - There's something in that box of exquisite beauty,
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.120]   both literally and in what it symbolizes
[00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.760]   and why it is here.
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.800]   - Given the kind of human being you are,
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.640]   I'm terrified at what you find beautiful.
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.680]   - That's a good point.
[00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.320]   You kind of hit me with the curve ball.
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.160]   - Yeah?
[00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.240]   - Like for me, the most beautiful wildlife
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.440]   are what I call God's mistakes.
[00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.280]   - Yeah.
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.640]   - Because my friend came up with that term
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.280]   where she's like, "God made these disgusting animals
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.440]   "just threw in the bottom of the ocean."
[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.000]   He's like, "No one's ever gonna see this."
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.600]   - Yeah, you commented on Twitter about some creature,
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.520]   like a rainbow-type creature.
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.760]   - The peacock mantis shrimp.
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.280]   - Yeah, it's beautiful.
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.520]   - It's horrific, though.
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.440]   So it has, I think, eight legs, six arms,
[00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.160]   two punching claws or spearing claws,
[00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.040]   depending on the genus, two eyes, two antennae,
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.600]   two ear flaps, I don't know what they do,
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.640]   and its punch can be as strong as a bullet.
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.320]   And the other type with the spears,
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.720]   divers call them thumb splitters
[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.320]   because if you stick your finger near it,
[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.240]   it'll cut your thumb down to the bone.
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.680]   So I had one as a pet.
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.000]   All night, I would hear it banging on the PVC pipe,
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.800]   and I gotta tell you, they have the best eyesight
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.040]   of any animal 'cause they see in like seven different ways.
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.000]   And when you make eye contact with this thing,
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.520]   it's just absolutely terrifying.
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.440]   But you can eat them as sushi.
[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:01.640]   They call them sea centipedes.
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.120]   - But they're colorful and beautiful.
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.560]   - That species is, yeah.
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.560]   - What was it like having one as a pet?
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.560]   And why did you do it?
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.600]   - Well, when you have a species that's that unique
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.080]   and that much of an outlier,
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.800]   growing up reading these books, watching these shows,
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.440]   I found this stuff so much more fascinating than space,
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.640]   which is dead.
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.480]   So to be able to have this specimen in your house
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.480]   and just observe its behavior is just an amazing thing.
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:33.960]   - Why'd you get rid of it?
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.680]   - I didn't have, I guess, the right minerals in the mix.
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:37.760]   - It died. - It had a problem
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:38.960]   molting once, yeah.
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.400]   It couldn't molt correctly.
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.440]   - Wow.
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:42.280]   You miss it?
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.280]   Think about it still?
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.920]   - I do think about it, to be honest.
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.840]   I still have a pair of its punching appendages
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.200]   from when it molted.
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.960]   - What pet animal in your life do you miss the most
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.880]   that has been in your life that you think about?
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.560]   - I've never had cats or dogs growing up
[00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.800]   or anything like that, which, you know, I, oh God.
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.400]   My problem is-- - Here we go.
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.320]   - If I like, oh, I can't do it,
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.080]   'cause then once I get those five, it's gonna be 100,
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.360]   and I'm already too old to be the tattoo guy.
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.760]   - What would be the first tattoo?
[00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:19.600]   - My face.
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.480]   (laughing)
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:23.720]   - Would it go on your ass cheeks,
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.200]   or where would you put them?
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.680]   If it was my face.
[00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.920]   - If I got your face, it would definitely be
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.040]   on my arm right here.
[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.640]   - If you had multiple faces, would you put like--
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:33.520]   - I think delts, right?
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.160]   Shoulders, different faces on different shoulders.
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.760]   - And then when you flex-- - Like, want some symmetry?
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:37.600]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.440]   Would you get a dictator?
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.320]   If you had to get a dictator, who would you get?
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:42.920]   - We have the Kim Jong-il, right?
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:43.760]   - Hmm.
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.280]   - 'Cause I wrote the book on him.
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.760]   - Oh, it's like plugging your book in a tattoo.
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.400]   - I don't think plugging, it's just like,
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.080]   I have a personal connection to this stuff.
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.080]   - Good opener to the conversation.
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.560]   People would be asking, "Why him?"
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.600]   And you'd be like, "Well, I wrote a book about it."
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.480]   - Well, I don't-- - And I'd be like, "Oh, okay."
[00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:58.760]   - Okay, here's why-- - Let me check it out.
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.760]   - That would be a bad, no, that's not what happens.
[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:01.840]   - Okay.
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:02.680]   - Here's the thing.
[00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:03.500]   - What happens?
[00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.520]   - When you write a book about North,
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.160]   hey, nice to meet you, what is it you do?
[00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.400]   I'm an author, what kind of books do you write?
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.120]   Well, my last book was on North Korea.
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.780]   90% of the time, 90, they will then start telling me
[00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.520]   everything they know about North Korea.
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.600]   And it's like, I don't need, this isn't a quiz,
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.800]   and it's a very poorly understood country.
[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.480]   I don't expect you to know anything.
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.880]   You're not on the spot.
[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.160]   And half what you're saying is not accurate either.
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.000]   It's fine.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.320]   - How often do they bring up Dennis Rodman?
[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:30.800]   - 100%. - 100% of the time.
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.400]   - Oh, so you know Dennis Rodman?
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.360]   - Yeah. - But I don't understand,
[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.600]   I guess people feel the need to like,
[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.440]   all right, now we're talking about this subject,
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.120]   I just gotta drop whatever I can talk about.
[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.600]   It's usually a small amount.
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.880]   And there's this thing in the culture, which I hate,
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.880]   that everyone have to have an opinion on everything.
[00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.120]   And it's like, it's okay to be like,
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.840]   yeah, I don't know anything about that, tell me more.
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.200]   There's lots of things I don't know anything about.
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:58.040]   - What's your opinion on my bird here, Mr. Parrot?
[00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.920]   - It's a macaw, Scarlet macaw.
[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.480]   - What? - It is a Scarlet macaw.
[00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.800]   - Oh, you know birds? - Yeah.
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:09.080]   And that's actually not life-sized.
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.880]   - Are you saying he's not real?
[00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.600]   - I'm saying it's not to scale.
[00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.640]   - Okay, but he's real.
[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.640]   - Are we doing that Monty Python sketch?
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.280]   (both laughing)
[00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:19.760]   - Everything is a Monty Python sketch.
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.400]   - I don't think Monty Python's funny.
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:22.960]   - You don't? - At all.
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:24.200]   - That explains so much.
[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.040]   - Does it?
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:25.880]   What does it explain?
[00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:26.720]   - What do you think is funny?
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.480]   (both laughing)
[00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:31.000]   - You're not answering that question, it's pretty funny.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.120]   - Well, yeah, what do you think is funny?
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.760]   Having a manta shrimp?
[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:35.720]   - No.
[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.360]   - You think Big Lebowski's funny?
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.040]   - Oh God, no.
[00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:40.200]   Although-- - This is getting
[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.000]   worse and worse. - To be fair,
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:46.040]   I only tried to watch Big Lebowski
[00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:48.800]   after it's been part of the culture for many years
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.320]   to the point where every single line
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:53.680]   has been quoted incessantly
[00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.760]   by the most annoying frat bros ever.
[00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:59.480]   So I kind of have been poisoned
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.120]   to be able to appreciate it.
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.160]   So maybe if I'd seen it when it came out
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.760]   before it became a thing, I would have enjoyed it.
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:06.760]   I couldn't get through it.
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.360]   Like I couldn't get through 20 minutes.
[00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.600]   - Is that how you feel about Schindler's List?
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:12.840]   - Well-- - It's so much easier
[00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:14.760]   for me to stare at you when you have sunglasses on.
[00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:15.740]   - I didn't think you'd be the one
[00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:17.800]   making Holocaust jokes today.
[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.160]   And yet here we are.
[00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.000]   - And cut scene.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.520]   I actually have no trouble making eye contact with you
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:25.760]   when you're wearing shades.
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:27.920]   - Yes, 'cause you're a robot.
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.000]   - Two copies of myself.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.280]   - Yeah, oh, you're seeing yourself in them?
[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:31.120]   - Mm-hmm. - Okay, cool.
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.680]   - Yeah, I'm having a conversation with myself.
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.440]   It's not your fault, Lex.
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:36.640]   (both laughing)
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:38.320]   - They made you like this.
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:41.400]   You were just a good little robot in St. Petersburg.
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:44.840]   - I could see Mr. Parrot a little bit too.
[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:45.840]   - Well, what do you find funny?
[00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:48.040]   Come on, this is an interesting subject.
[00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:51.040]   - Well, I find Mighty Python, I find absurdity funny.
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:52.680]   - Yes, I find absurdity funny.
[00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:53.640]   I think that's the thing.
[00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:56.120]   When people come at me,
[00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:58.920]   and maybe this is an Eastern European thing.
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:00.260]   When they're like, how can you find
[00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.720]   this very dark subject funny?
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:04.480]   It's like, well, the humor, first of all,
[00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:07.480]   the humor is that you're making fun
[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:08.520]   of something that's dark.
[00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:09.760]   So already it's absurd.
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:11.360]   It's completely inappropriate.
[00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:14.040]   Second, just psychologically,
[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:16.640]   Joan Rivers said that Winston Churchill said,
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:17.800]   I don't know if it's true,
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:18.760]   that when you make people laugh,
[00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:20.640]   you're giving them a little vacation.
[00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:22.480]   And I was just thinking about this the other day,
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:27.480]   how when I die, if, I want my funeral to be a roast.
[00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.400]   - Yeah. - It doesn't help me
[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:30.920]   that everyone's sad.
[00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:34.520]   If I brought people happiness or joy in life, whatever,
[00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:35.680]   I wanna keep doing that in death.
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:37.560]   Your sadness doesn't help me.
[00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:38.720]   I know you can't help it.
[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:41.440]   But tell stories how it made you laugh,
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:43.720]   make fun of me, make me the punching bag,
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:45.280]   even literally take me out of that coffin
[00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:48.280]   and make me a pinata, I don't care.
[00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:51.520]   So I think, and I don't understand,
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:55.280]   well, I do understand, but it's sad for me
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:59.360]   when people are like, this isn't funny, that isn't funny.
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:01.400]   The way I look at humor is the way,
[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:02.760]   it's like a chef, right?
[00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:05.400]   It's pretty easy to make bacon taste good,
[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:07.600]   but some of these really obscure ingredients,
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:10.280]   to make it palatable, that takes skill.
[00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:11.760]   So if you're dealing with a subject
[00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:14.080]   that is very emotional or intense,
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:15.720]   and you can make people laugh,
[00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:20.320]   then that takes skill, and that's the relief for them.
[00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:21.160]   - Yeah.
[00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:23.800]   It's all about timing.
[00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:25.280]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:32.080]   - What's the difference, you wanna hear one of my jokes?
[00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:33.240]   - Is it a pirate joke?
[00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:35.880]   'Cause that's the only kind I accept today.
[00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:38.000]   But go ahead, it doesn't have to be a pirate joke.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:38.840]   It's one time.
[00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:40.720]   - Do you know who Leo Thomas is?
[00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:41.600]   - Yeah.
[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:43.920]   - What's the difference between Leo Thomas and Hitler?
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:45.000]   - What?
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   - Leo Thomas knows how to finish a race.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.400]   - Very nice, very nice.
[00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:51.320]   - Did I just get the gold medal?
[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:52.160]   - Good job.
[00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:58.000]   Why does it take pirates forever to get through the alphabet?
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.600]   - Why?
[00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:03.920]   - 'Cause they spent years at sea.
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:06.480]   - Oh, I thought it was gonna be an arr joke.
[00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:08.560]   That's a good one, I like that.
[00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:10.560]   When I was in North Korea, one.
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:11.400]   (laughing)
[00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:13.440]   - Oh, you know Dennis Rodman?
[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:14.280]   It's a callback.
[00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.880]   - By the way, the thing that is very heartbreaking
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:18.120]   about the North Korean situation
[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:20.600]   is that they have a great sense of humor.
[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:25.600]   It would be a lot easier if these were robots or drones.
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:29.280]   They have big personalities, big sense of humor,
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:32.560]   and that made it much harder to leave
[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:33.840]   and interact with these people
[00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:36.320]   'cause there's nothing more human and universal
[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:38.240]   than laughter and laughter's free.
[00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:40.440]   - You're saying there's humor even amongst the people
[00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:42.520]   that have most of their freedoms taken away?
[00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:45.360]   - Especially, again, we're from the Soviet Union.
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:49.040]   There's an anecdote, Russian humor is a thing
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:52.760]   because if you can't have food or nice things,
[00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:55.320]   at least you can have joy and make each other laugh.
[00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:56.280]   I think about it all the time
[00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:57.400]   and I think about my guide all the time.
[00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:00.240]   It's been, what, 2012, so it's been 11 years
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:01.480]   since I've been there and she's still there
[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:02.840]   and everyone I've seen is still there.
[00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:05.960]   They just recently electrified the border
[00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:07.960]   so you can't even, even the few people who are escaping
[00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:08.960]   can't do it anymore.
[00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:10.760]   - Well, that's interesting
[00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:12.000]   that they still have a sense of humor.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.180]   I attribute the Soviet Union for having that
[00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:17.840]   because of the really deep education system.
[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:20.760]   You got to read a lot of literature
[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:25.760]   and because of that, you get to learn about the cruelty,
[00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:30.720]   the injustices, the absurdity of the world,
[00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:33.680]   as long as the writing is not about the current regime.
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:36.400]   - Yeah, but I think if you look at African Americans,
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:38.160]   Jewish Americans, gay Americans,
[00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:39.720]   they are all disproportionate
[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:42.000]   in terms of attributing to comedy.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.440]   It's not 'cause these groups have some kind of magic to them
[00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:48.880]   it's that when you are on the outside looking in,
[00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:50.200]   A, you're gonna have different perspective
[00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:52.360]   than the people who are in the middle of the bell curve,
[00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:55.200]   but also when you don't have anything to lose,
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:57.280]   at the very least, you can make each other laugh
[00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:59.440]   and find happiness that way.
[00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:01.920]   So, that is something that I think
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:04.960]   is an important thing to recognize.
[00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:07.240]   - So what do you find funny?
[00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:12.240]   What makes you giggle in the most joyful of ways?
[00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:14.520]   The suffering of others?
[00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:19.360]   - I mean, there are YouTube videos
[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:24.360]   of fat people falling down and they're really funny.
[00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:29.080]   - There's two kinds of people in this world.
[00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:32.760]   Those that laugh at those videos and those that don't.
[00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:34.400]   - No, and those that are in them.
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:39.760]   My friend Jesse just told me a great Norm Macdonald joke
[00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:41.920]   and this is a good litmus test joke
[00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:45.680]   'cause he says a certain group of people lose their minds
[00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:47.760]   and a certain group of people just stare at you.
[00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:48.880]   And he goes this kind of,
[00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:51.480]   so I'll tell you the joke, this is Norm Macdonald.
[00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:55.240]   Guy walks into a bar and he sees someone at the bar
[00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:57.800]   who has a big pumpkin for a head.
[00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:59.280]   And the guy's like, dude, what happened to you?
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:01.320]   He goes, ugh, you'll never believe this.
[00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:03.320]   I got one of those genie lamps.
[00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:05.160]   And this genie, he's like, what happened?
[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.160]   He goes, well, the first wish,
[00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:08.960]   I wished for $100 million.
[00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:09.800]   He's like, yeah, did you get it?
[00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:10.620]   He goes, yeah.
[00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:11.460]   He goes, it was in my bank account.
[00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:12.300]   It was fine.
[00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:13.200]   He goes, all right.
[00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:15.080]   Well, the second wish, I wished to have sex
[00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:16.360]   with as many beautiful women as I wanted.
[00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:17.360]   He goes, did that happen?
[00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:18.680]   He goes, yeah, it was amazing.
[00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:19.680]   He goes, then what?
[00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:21.680]   Well, I wished for a giant pumpkin head.
[00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:23.920]   (laughing)
[00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:27.480]   So there's a certain mindset
[00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:30.080]   that will just be staring at the screen.
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:32.440]   And that is, I mean, there's so many levels
[00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:33.960]   why that's funny, at least to me.
[00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:35.760]   And I just love that kind of--
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:37.280]   - Well, Norm Macdonald's like,
[00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:39.840]   just, I watch his videos all the time.
[00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:42.520]   He's a guy that definitely makes me giggle.
[00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:46.320]   And he's one of the people that makes me giggle
[00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:48.560]   for reasons I don't quite understand.
[00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:52.320]   - Did you ever see him with Carrot Top on Conan O'Brien?
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:53.160]   - No.
[00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:54.360]   - Making fun of Carrot Top?
[00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:55.240]   - No.
[00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:59.240]   He, this is probably the best talk show clip of all time.
[00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:00.720]   He's on with Courtney Thorne-Smith.
[00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:02.080]   She was on Melrose Place.
[00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:03.720]   And Conan O'Brien's the host.
[00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:05.960]   And Courtney's talking about how
[00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:10.160]   she's gonna be an upcoming movie with Carrot Top.
[00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:12.640]   And Conan's like, oh, what's it gonna be called?
[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:14.840]   And she's like, doesn't have a title yet.
[00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:16.680]   And Norman goes, oh, I know what it should be called,
[00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:18.720]   Box Office Poison.
[00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:19.840]   And they're all laughing.
[00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:20.800]   And she's like, no, no, no.
[00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:23.440]   Like, the working title is Chairman of the Board.
[00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:25.240]   And Conan goes, do something with that smart ass.
[00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:27.920]   And Norman goes, yeah, board is spelled B-O-R-E-D.
[00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:30.160]   And they all just completely lost it.
[00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:33.120]   - There's something about him with words spoken
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:35.360]   out of his mouth, with the way he like turns his head
[00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:36.840]   and looks at the camera.
[00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:41.320]   - I think he is one of those rare comedians
[00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:44.240]   who you really feel like he's talking to you directly.
[00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:47.560]   He feels like he's winking at you in the audience.
[00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:49.480]   And he's like, can you believe I'm doing this?
[00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:52.560]   Like, it's like he almost, he feels like he's,
[00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:53.520]   I don't wanna say imposter,
[00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:55.360]   but like he's more a member of the audience
[00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:57.200]   than he is a member of the people on the stage.
[00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:59.920]   - Yeah, it feels like he's on our side,
[00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:01.440]   whatever the hell our means.
[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:03.960]   - You know, Roseanne got him his first job.
[00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:07.480]   - Roseanne, you and her have been hanging out.
[00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:09.080]   - I got it, oh my God.
[00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:10.240]   Talk about Thanksgiving.
[00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:14.200]   When you are talking to Roseanne Barr
[00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:16.840]   and making eye contact with this person,
[00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:19.040]   it is, I can't even describe it.
[00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:21.240]   It's just like, holy crap, Roseanne Barr is talking to me.
[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:26.240]   She is, I've said this to her face, pathologically funny.
[00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:28.600]   Like it does not turn off.
[00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:30.840]   And you're sitting there and you're like, holy crap.
[00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:32.520]   And when you make her laugh,
[00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:35.480]   which is that laugh that's in the theme song of her show,
[00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:37.320]   you feel like, okay, I did a mitzvah.
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:38.920]   I did something good and right in the world
[00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:40.520]   that I made Roseanne Barr laugh.
[00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:43.400]   And it's also really funny because,
[00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:45.000]   and she's gonna hate this,
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   'cause I tell her she's adorable, she isn't like that.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.680]   She's little.
[00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:51.120]   You think of Roseanne Barr as this like force of nature,
[00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:52.080]   like a tsunami.
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:55.280]   She's like five, three, I'd say like maybe 130.
[00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:57.000]   And she puts on the sunglasses.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.320]   You think this little Jewish lady, you'd never know.
[00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:02.360]   This is one of the most epic performers of all time.
[00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:03.720]   She lives near here now.
[00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:07.160]   So it's just so much fun talking to her.
[00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:09.360]   There was an old satirical magazine in the,
[00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:14.360]   I think in like early 2000s called "Heb" written by Jews.
[00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:18.480]   And she dressed up as Hitler for one of the photo shoots
[00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:21.440]   and she was baking little men in the oven.
[00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:24.800]   I found on eBay, I want her to sign it to Michael.
[00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:26.400]   It should have been you.
[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:29.480]   But she signed it to Michael, you're one smart cookie.
[00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:32.360]   And now it hangs, love mom, Roseanne Barr.
[00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:35.360]   And I call her mom and it hangs over my desk
[00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:37.640]   'cause I have her like good domestic goddess energy
[00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:38.480]   flowing at me.
[00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:41.920]   What?
[00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:43.600]   - What do you find?
[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:44.420]   What else?
[00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:45.260]   So Norm Macdonald.
[00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:46.100]   - Norm Macdonald. - I guess we plan on that.
[00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:47.160]   - My favorite comedian is--
[00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:48.120]   - We agree on something.
[00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:52.800]   - My favorite comedian of all time is Neil Hamburger.
[00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:55.760]   So Neil Hamburger, I don't know if I'm ruining the bit.
[00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:58.600]   He's a character performed by this guy
[00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:00.120]   named Greg Turkington.
[00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:05.000]   So he comes out in a tuxedo, big eyeglasses,
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.020]   holding three glasses of water,
[00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:10.600]   coughing into the mic.
[00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:15.800]   And I remember I saw him once in LA
[00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:17.720]   and the girl ahead of me, at the table ahead of me
[00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:20.840]   was with her boyfriend, this basic chick, Pumpkin Spice.
[00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:23.320]   She turns to him and she goes, "What is this?"
[00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:26.080]   And I remember the first time he was on Jimmy Kimmel
[00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:30.200]   and he tells one of his jokes and it was like,
[00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:33.720]   "Why does E.T. like Reese's Pieces so much?"
[00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:36.440]   Well, that's what sperm tastes like on his home planet.
[00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:38.400]   And like no one laughs and he goes,
[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:40.280]   "Oh, come on guys, I have cancer."
[00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:42.040]   (both laughing)
[00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:43.920]   And it just cuts to this marine in the audience
[00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:45.000]   with his arms crossed.
[00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:48.160]   So if you know what he's doing,
[00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:49.280]   it's just absolutely amazing.
[00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:53.760]   He opened for Tenacious D once in somewhere,
[00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:56.240]   I think in Ireland or the UK, one of those.
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:57.720]   And they're booing him
[00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:59.720]   'cause his jokes are often not funny.
[00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:04.720]   He's like, "Hey, where did my whore ex-wife run off to
[00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:07.120]   with that dentist she's shacking up with?
[00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:09.320]   I don't know, but when I see her in court next month,
[00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:11.040]   Alaska."
[00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:12.720]   So they're booing and he goes, "All right,
[00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:15.220]   do you guys want me to bring out Tenacious D?"
[00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:17.040]   They're like, "Yeah, do you want to see your heroes
[00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:17.880]   of mine Tenacious D?"
[00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:18.720]   "Yeah."
[00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:19.540]   "Come on, let me hear it.
[00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:20.380]   Do you want to see Tenacious D?"
[00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:21.220]   "Yeah."
[00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:25.040]   He goes, "All right, if I tell this next joke
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:28.800]   and you don't boo me, I'll bring out Tenacious D."
[00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:33.160]   And it's like, I'm trying to think of one that's not too-
[00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:36.120]   - Self-censorship is never good.
[00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:40.440]   - Okay, he goes, "Can we agree that George Bush
[00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:42.960]   is the worst president America's ever had?"
[00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:43.800]   Everyone claps.
[00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:46.020]   Which makes it all the stranger that his son,
[00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:48.700]   George W. Bush, was in fact the best.
[00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:50.500]   - I take it back, I'm a self-censorship.
[00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:55.220]   - So two people laugh and he goes, "Oh, that's amazing.
[00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:56.460]   I guess I'll do an encore."
[00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:57.700]   And he did 10 more minutes.
[00:18:57.700 --> 00:19:00.180]   It was just like, I love him so much.
[00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:02.820]   - It's interesting that he opened for Tenacious D.
[00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:06.540]   Jack Black, that's a comedic genius of a different kind.
[00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:08.700]   - Oh yeah, and he was in one of my favorite movies,
[00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:11.300]   Jesus' Son, it's this little indie movie.
[00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:12.300]   He did a great turn in that.
[00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:13.920]   He's really underrated as an actor.
[00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:15.040]   He's got a lot of range.
[00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:16.920]   I know they kind of get typescast
[00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:19.160]   as this one specific type,
[00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:21.160]   but he's really, really talented.
[00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:23.040]   - But also just the pure joy.
[00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:24.880]   - Yes, he's clearly having fun.
[00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:28.200]   - Okay, it is Thanksgiving.
[00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:33.120]   So in the tradition, following tradition,
[00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:35.880]   what are you thankful for, Michael, in this world?
[00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:37.160]   - Do you have a list too?
[00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:38.320]   - No, not really.
[00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:39.140]   - Really?
[00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:39.980]   - It's up in here.
[00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:41.720]   - Oh, I mean, but you have several things
[00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:42.560]   you're thankful for.
[00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:43.560]   - Yes, yes.
[00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:44.480]   - One of the things I'm--
[00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:45.560]   - My list comes from the heart.
[00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:47.000]   I don't have to write anything down.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.040]   - Well, I don't have it written down.
[00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:48.880]   - Okay.
[00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:50.600]   - One of the things that I'm most thankful for,
[00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:54.000]   this is a common answer, but I can back it up,
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   is my family, because my nephew Lucas is now six years old,
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:03.640]   and when kids have a sense of humor,
[00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:05.980]   it's like just miraculous.
[00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:10.560]   So he stole my sister's phone, his mom,
[00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:14.120]   he figured out that grandma is listed as mom in the phone,
[00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:16.040]   and he calls her up, and he's like,
[00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:17.720]   "Michael's in the hospital, he's really sick,
[00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:19.680]   "he didn't wanna tell you," and she's freaking out,
[00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:21.120]   he goes, "Prank!"
[00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:24.880]   So I took him, Dinesh D'Souza just released a movie
[00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:26.920]   called "Police State," which is actually really good,
[00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:29.720]   highly recommend it, I was surprised how much I liked it,
[00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:31.840]   'cause he wasn't going Republicans, good, Democrats bad,
[00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:33.600]   it was just about authoritarianism.
[00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:37.720]   And he had a movie premiere, "Mar-a-Lago,"
[00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:40.880]   so I'm like, I gotta bring Lucas to "Mar-a-Lago."
[00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:43.320]   So Lucas is, I'm like, "We're going to the president's house,"
[00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:44.760]   he's like, "Oh, the White House?"
[00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:46.400]   And I'm like, "No, no, a former president,"
[00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:47.600]   he goes, "Oh, Abe Lincoln?"
[00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:48.640]   And I'm like, "Okay, kid logic,
[00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:51.280]   "he's giving logical answers, this is kind of like AI,
[00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:55.160]   "you have to program it, it's using logic correctly."
[00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:57.600]   - You should have told him, as a president,
[00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:01.200]   that's second to only Abe Lincoln,
[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:03.600]   in terms of greatness. - Accomplishments, yeah.
[00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:09.480]   He went up to all the women in their ball gown,
[00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:13.240]   evening gowns, and he goes, "You're so beautiful,
[00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:15.080]   "were you born as a girl?"
[00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:17.840]   So when you have this six-year-old asking you this,
[00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:19.760]   it was really, really fun.
[00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:23.200]   So that is a great joy, to have a nephew,
[00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:26.160]   and I have another one, Zach, who's coming up in age,
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:27.920]   and he's starting to talk now,
[00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:29.880]   that is really, really fun for me.
[00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:33.200]   - Getting to watch them find out
[00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:34.320]   about the world for the first time.
[00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:35.560]   - And also training them,
[00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:39.680]   like that he loves being funny and having fun.
[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:42.320]   - You're his audience, in a sense.
[00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:44.400]   - Yeah, but-- - 'Cause you giggle and--
[00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:47.560]   - I give him, we're prank bros, he gives me a high five.
[00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:51.240]   My family, and this is, you talk about what I find funny,
[00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:53.520]   this is the things that actually enrage me.
[00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:55.720]   When people, and this is such a WASP thing,
[00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:57.320]   don't just go with the joke,
[00:21:57.320 --> 00:21:58.400]   or they're like, "I don't get it,"
[00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:00.800]   or they don't understand, to just go with it.
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:05.440]   I was in the car with my sister when she was like 10, 12,
[00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:06.520]   whatever, she's much younger than me,
[00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:08.120]   she's like 12 years younger,
[00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:11.760]   and there's this species of squid, by the way,
[00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:13.520]   which is asymmetric, one of its eyes
[00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:15.160]   is very much bigger than the other,
[00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:16.360]   'cause it swims horizontally,
[00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:18.200]   and so one's looking up, one's looking down,
[00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:19.680]   where there's more light.
[00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:21.360]   Shout out, if you wanna learn more about squids,
[00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:22.600]   go to octonation.com.
[00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:25.240]   - Octonation, shout out. - Shout out to Warren.
[00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:26.320]   - There's a lot of fascinating stuff.
[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:28.120]   Octonation on Instagram. - Yes.
[00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:30.400]   I was in the car with my sister,
[00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:32.320]   she was like 10 or 12. - Me as a pirate,
[00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:33.840]   I'm sorry for the rude interruptions,
[00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:35.920]   I appreciate that, I count especially.
[00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:37.240]   - Yeah, it's a great, yeah.
[00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:40.080]   - These jokes and thoughts are coming to me
[00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:42.320]   at a 10-second delay, so I apologize.
[00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:43.760]   Anyway, you were telling about the asymmetrical--
[00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:46.400]   - I know where I left the story, I got it.
[00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:47.680]   So I told my-- - Sometimes you need help.
[00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:49.480]   - No. - The age is getting to you.
[00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:51.320]   (laughing)
[00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:53.800]   - I was-- - Your skin is showing it.
[00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:56.520]   It's getting dark.
[00:22:56.520 --> 00:23:00.280]   - I told my sister, I go, "When you were born,
[00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:01.840]   "one of your eyes was bigger than the other
[00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:04.000]   "and you had to have surgery to fix it."
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.240]   So she turns, she's like, "Mom,"
[00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:09.800]   and my mom goes, "Honey, the important thing
[00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:11.360]   "is that you're beautiful now."
[00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:12.680]   That's all, it's like, "What's the big deal?
[00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:13.720]   "It was just a little surgery."
[00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:16.600]   And my sister's like, "All right, call grandma."
[00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:20.040]   And grandma goes, she goes, "Michael said that
[00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:21.040]   "when I was born, one of the eyes,"
[00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:22.760]   she goes, "Why is he telling you this now?
[00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:24.280]   "It's not a big deal."
[00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:26.800]   The fact that everyone went with this,
[00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:27.920]   I was so impressed.
[00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:30.160]   I was like, this is a quality family
[00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:32.040]   in this very specific regard.
[00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:34.040]   Does your family have a sense of humor?
[00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:36.000]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:36.840]   - Yeah.
[00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:40.400]   - Soviet culture, there's a dark sense of humor.
[00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:42.520]   - Very much so. - There's wit, there's--
[00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:44.120]   - Wordplay. - Wordplay.
[00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:47.560]   Yeah, yeah, and especially the Russian language
[00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:51.040]   allows for some hilarity to it.
[00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:53.440]   There's also a culture of poetry.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   My dad, my mom too, but they remember a lot of lines
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.800]   from books and poems.
[00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:05.520]   So there's just, you can do a lot of fascinating references
[00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:08.280]   that add to the humor and the richness of the conversation.
[00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:10.520]   - I feel like that's a very Russian thing.
[00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:12.200]   Like at a party or maybe at a bar or something,
[00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:13.720]   I don't know where you'd meet people,
[00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:15.760]   these are such great-- - And they go out.
[00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:17.520]   - I meant in Russia.
[00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:20.120]   I meant these would be such good icebreakers.
[00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:20.960]   Right, you go up to someone and goes,
[00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:23.160]   "Hey, did you hear this one, Novaya Anekdot?"
[00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:25.080]   And you just tell him some little story.
[00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:27.720]   - Did you say icebreakers 'cause it's cold in Russia?
[00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:32.440]   I'm here all night.
[00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:33.280]   - That's true, you never leave the house.
[00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:34.480]   - Literally. - So.
[00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:37.640]   I feel like that's a thing.
[00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:39.120]   - Yeah. - And that's not a thing
[00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:39.960]   in America.
[00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:43.440]   - You mean like witty banter?
[00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:45.000]   - No, meaning you go up to a stranger
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.680]   and that's your icebreaker, you tell him this little joke.
[00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:49.680]   And since everyone kinda has the same sensibilities,
[00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:51.040]   right away you guys are chatting.
[00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:52.480]   I don't think that's a thing here.
[00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:54.200]   - Yeah. - Here it's more small talk,
[00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:55.520]   which drives me crazy.
[00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:57.280]   - So what else are you thankful for?
[00:24:57.280 --> 00:24:59.680]   - Well, what's something you're thankful for?
[00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:00.960]   - Well, you went with family.
[00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:02.640]   I'm definitely thankful for family.
[00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:04.160]   - Okay. - Yeah.
[00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:07.320]   - How, if I may ask, how do they react to you?
[00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:08.560]   Like you're sitting down with Elon,
[00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:10.160]   you're sitting down with Netanyahu,
[00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:11.760]   you're sitting down with all these big,
[00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:14.520]   with Kanye, all these big names.
[00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:17.440]   Are they expressing that they're proud of you
[00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:19.880]   or is it more like, why haven't you talked to this person?
[00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:22.800]   - (laughs) Yeah, more Michael Malice, please.
[00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:25.280]   (both laugh)
[00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:26.680]   - People's choice.
[00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:28.320]   - Yeah, yeah, they're very proud.
[00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:30.080]   They've been very, they're very,
[00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:31.400]   I mean, but they get argumentative
[00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:34.880]   and they're just like a regular human being
[00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:36.960]   with whom I'm close and we just argue about stuff.
[00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:40.840]   They're not, maybe not enough, show the being proud of,
[00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:45.360]   but that part is just the nature of our relationship.
[00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:46.760]   It's also Soviet parents.
[00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:48.640]   - Yeah, I don't talk to my dad, that's one of the reasons,
[00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:52.480]   'cause there's never, ever any good job.
[00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:56.560]   And at a certain point, it's like,
[00:25:56.560 --> 00:26:00.920]   why am I trying to search for approval
[00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:02.480]   from someone I'm never getting it for
[00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:03.720]   and from whom it wouldn't mean anything
[00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:04.800]   at this point anyway?
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:05.640]   - Well, that's interesting.
[00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:07.440]   I mean, there's a journey like that
[00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:10.600]   for a lot of people with their father or with their mother.
[00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:12.760]   Like, they're always trying to find approval.
[00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:13.960]   - Right.
[00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:15.840]   - That's life for a lot of people.
[00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:17.240]   - Yeah.
[00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:20.440]   - That's a really big part of the human condition
[00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:21.800]   is that relationship you have
[00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:23.000]   with your father, with your mother.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.120]   I don't know, it's a beautiful thing.
[00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:26.880]   So it's, whether it's been a rough childhood
[00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:29.360]   or a beautiful one, all of it, that's who you are.
[00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:33.000]   Like, that, the relationship,
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.240]   especially early on in your life with your father,
[00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:38.520]   with your mother, is like extremely formative.
[00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:41.920]   - Yeah, my dad taught me a lot of things at a young age
[00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:44.120]   that I'm very, very grateful for.
[00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:49.520]   He's extremely intelligent, very flawed, and that's fine.
[00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:51.440]   We all are, except for me.
[00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:55.160]   And it's the kind of things that when you learn things
[00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:57.040]   that are right, and this is one of the things I like
[00:26:57.040 --> 00:26:59.280]   about being older, is that when I'm friends with people--
[00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:00.120]   - Much older.
[00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:00.960]   - Much older.
[00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:01.780]   (laughs)
[00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:02.620]   But much, much older.
[00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:04.720]   When I have friends who are younger,
[00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:07.160]   it's very easy for me to keep them
[00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:08.720]   from making the mistakes I did.
[00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:10.800]   So at least this is something I'm getting out of it,
[00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:12.680]   is that, okay, I can't fix these mistakes,
[00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:15.120]   but it just takes me 30 seconds
[00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:17.600]   and I can pull you back from making the mistake.
[00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:19.640]   So he taught me a lot as a kid.
[00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:22.360]   He really encouraged me very much to,
[00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:23.600]   he's a very good sense of humor
[00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:26.120]   and also very bad in some ways, dad jokes,
[00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:28.380]   but also really funny jokes.
[00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:33.040]   But also this love of learning, I got that from him.
[00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:36.200]   And I mean, I have got literally right now
[00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:37.880]   98 books on my shelf to read.
[00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:40.200]   It's just a life, that makes me,
[00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:42.900]   I remember I had a friend and she ran into someone
[00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:43.960]   she went to high school with
[00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:45.520]   and he stopped you on the train
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:46.840]   and he's like, "Yo, you're not in college.
[00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:48.000]   "You don't need to read books anymore."
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.680]   And I was just horrified to hear this.
[00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:53.040]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:54.200]   Boy, don't I know it.
[00:27:54.200 --> 00:28:00.040]   - I mean, you do laugh, but when you got,
[00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:03.160]   there's a lot of things I don't understand.
[00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:07.880]   When you got heat for, I wanna read the Western classics,
[00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:10.680]   to me, that might've been the internet's absolute worst.
[00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:14.480]   - I think there's just a cynical perspective
[00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:15.960]   you can take that there,
[00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:19.220]   this is such a simple celebration of a thing,
[00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:21.320]   that there must be something behind it.
[00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:25.500]   I think the internet for good and bad is just skeptical.
[00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:26.800]   Like what's behind this?
[00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:29.960]   - My hero, Albert Camus, and if there's one thing
[00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:32.400]   I would wanna fight, it's cynicism.
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:36.960]   Because it's such a giving up, it's such everything sucks.
[00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:38.640]   This sucks, that sucks, this sucks.
[00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:41.200]   Most things suck, most standard comedians suck,
[00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:43.340]   most movies suck, all podcasts suck.
[00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:46.080]   But it doesn't matter. - Especially yours.
[00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:48.400]   - Especially mine, it's unwatchable.
[00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:50.640]   - You're welcome, you can't even spell it correctly.
[00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:53.300]   (both laughing)
[00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:57.060]   - But the stuff that's good is what matters.
[00:28:57.060 --> 00:29:01.080]   Who cares if 90% of movies are terrible?
[00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:03.160]   They're the ones that change your life.
[00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:05.920]   The books, the people, the comedians,
[00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:07.380]   the shows, the music.
[00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:11.680]   And even the terrible things have good moments,
[00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:14.200]   beautiful moments. - Some, not all.
[00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:17.840]   - Your podcast being an example of not all.
[00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:21.480]   I've literally just, I keep listening for something good.
[00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:22.920]   Something good. - In all fairness,
[00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:25.520]   none of my guests have anything to offer.
[00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:26.560]   (Lex laughing)
[00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:28.480]   It's not on me, I try. - Yeah, yeah.
[00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:31.720]   Well, I wish you'd talk a little less in your podcast.
[00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:33.660]   It's a little excessive.
[00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:36.520]   I only listen for the underwear commercials.
[00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:38.840]   Sheathunderwear.com, probably called Malice.
[00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:42.680]   - I think you did this, I haven't seen you do it in a while,
[00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:46.400]   but this kind of commentary on a debate,
[00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:49.240]   or I think it was with Rand,
[00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:50.440]   like an Ayn Rand debate or something like this.
[00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:51.800]   - Oh yeah, Malice at the Movies.
[00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:53.880]   I watched the video and I broke it down.
[00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:56.120]   - That was really great, I wish you did that more.
[00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:58.480]   - I haven't done live streaming in a long time.
[00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:01.640]   It was something I was doing a lot in New York,
[00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:03.280]   especially during COVID.
[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:07.720]   I feel that, I don't know, I'm having,
[00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:09.720]   I've got so many projects on the plate.
[00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:13.760]   Oh, this is something else I'm thankful for.
[00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:15.680]   This is something I'm very, very thankful for,
[00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:17.160]   and I'm gonna announce it here.
[00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:19.460]   - Coming out of the closet, finally, go ahead.
[00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:23.560]   - Who's the lucky guy?
[00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:26.140]   (Lex laughing)
[00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:29.600]   You're the one in drag.
[00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:32.180]   (Lex laughing)
[00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:34.400]   - Guns out, guns out.
[00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:37.200]   - He makes me call him Sex Friedman.
[00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:40.360]   - You like it.
[00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:41.960]   - So, I didn't say it.
[00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:44.960]   Didn't even imply that.
[00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:48.480]   When I, as you probably know,
[00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:51.600]   as you know, but as many people watching this also know,
[00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:54.640]   Harvey P. Carr, who had the comic book series
[00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:57.000]   American Splendor, was the subject of movie
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.440]   American Splendor, he wrote a graphic novel about me
[00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:01.400]   in 2006 called Ego and Hubris,
[00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:03.840]   which goes for like $150 on eBay.
[00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:06.080]   It's not worth it, just download it.
[00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:11.080]   And I met Harvey because I wrote this screenplay
[00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:14.240]   about this band from the '80s called Rubber Rodeo.
[00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:15.400]   It's a real band.
[00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:17.700]   And the keyboardist, Gary Lieb, who passed away,
[00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:20.640]   rest in peace, Gary, introduced me to Harvey
[00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:22.920]   'cause he did the animation for the movie.
[00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:27.160]   And this script's been in my desk for over 20 years.
[00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:29.680]   And I realized, thanks to my buddy Eric July,
[00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:31.920]   who has some huge success with his comics,
[00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:34.200]   I could just produce this as a graphic novel.
[00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:36.880]   So I've got an artist, we're getting it together,
[00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:38.560]   so I'm gonna make it happen finally.
[00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:40.480]   And it's some of the best writing I've ever done,
[00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:42.480]   I'm really proud of the story.
[00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:44.300]   It's kind of ironic reading it now
[00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:47.240]   because when you're a writer, obviously,
[00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:49.080]   different books, you put different aspects
[00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:50.940]   of yourself into them, right?
[00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:53.160]   And this story's very, very dark
[00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:56.320]   because basically they did all the right things
[00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:58.400]   and they went nowhere, right?
[00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:01.040]   And what I realized was, reading it now,
[00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:04.520]   that all these fears I had over 20 years ago
[00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:06.160]   about what if I'm not gonna make it,
[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:07.800]   what if I'm doing all the hard work
[00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:09.760]   and it's still not enough,
[00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:12.920]   now it's been disproven 'cause I can at least pay my rent.
[00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:14.520]   - You feel like you've made it?
[00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:17.120]   'Cause you said you could pay your rent.
[00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:21.680]   - I feel that to make it is,
[00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:23.900]   if you don't have to have a boss,
[00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:27.600]   and you know how I really felt like I made it?
[00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:29.880]   This is gonna sound like a joke and it's not.
[00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:31.500]   This is being an immigrant.
[00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:35.440]   I own, as you know, Margaret Thatcher's bookcases.
[00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:36.280]   - Yes.
[00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:37.800]   - So to me, as an immigrant,
[00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:42.200]   to have her bookcases in my house, I've made it.
[00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:44.360]   - You're right, it's not a joke.
[00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:45.480]   There's nothing funny about it at all.
[00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:46.320]   - No way.
[00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:47.680]   (laughing)
[00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:48.800]   - Time to get serious.
[00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:51.240]   - Oh, nice.
[00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:52.480]   Oh, now I'm more nervous.
[00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:54.120]   (laughing)
[00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:55.020]   And aroused.
[00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:57.180]   So what else are you thankful for?
[00:32:57.180 --> 00:32:58.880]   So we're both thankful for family.
[00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:02.320]   - The fact that I can--
[00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:03.160]   - They'll get it up.
[00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:04.000]   - What's that?
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.120]   - Nothing, go ahead.
[00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:08.160]   - I think as an author,
[00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:11.360]   to be able to write what you want
[00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:15.620]   and have enough of an audience that it covers your living,
[00:33:15.620 --> 00:33:18.780]   that's as good as it gets as an author almost.
[00:33:18.780 --> 00:33:22.360]   You don't need to be Stephen King or some legend.
[00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:23.880]   It's like, there's lots of stand-ups
[00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:24.920]   who aren't world famous,
[00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:28.180]   but they have perfectly good living,
[00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:30.440]   they do their gig, they do what they love.
[00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:31.820]   I feel very, very blessed.
[00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:33.980]   You must be thankful for your career.
[00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:35.380]   - Yeah, career-wise.
[00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:38.620]   But I think the best part about it
[00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:42.700]   is just meeting, making friends with people I admire.
[00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:45.860]   Quite honestly, just friends.
[00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:47.620]   The people that have gotten to know me,
[00:33:47.620 --> 00:33:50.980]   I hide from the world sometimes, I hit some low points,
[00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:52.900]   especially with all the new experiences.
[00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:55.120]   And just the people that have been there for me
[00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:56.600]   and haven't given up on me.
[00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:59.200]   - You know, there's days, and I'm sure you've had this also,
[00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:01.780]   where I literally don't speak to someone the whole day.
[00:34:01.780 --> 00:34:03.200]   And in certain times of my life,
[00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:05.580]   I remember very vividly.
[00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:11.320]   I was in DC in '97, I was an intern.
[00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:16.160]   And that summer, DC closes down on the weekends.
[00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:17.480]   And I remember those weekends
[00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:21.260]   when I got off the phone with the third person,
[00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:24.920]   I knew there was no possibility anyone was gonna call.
[00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:26.400]   And what that felt like.
[00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:28.580]   And it was dark, and it was bad.
[00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:33.540]   So I remember those feelings of loneliness a lot.
[00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:37.840]   - I still feel alone like that sometimes.
[00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:40.020]   You don't feel alone?
[00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:42.560]   - Not anymore.
[00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:45.640]   - What's the reason, you think?
[00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:50.340]   - Because I have a lot of people
[00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:52.340]   who I care about and who care about me.
[00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:56.520]   I mean, the thing about moving to Austin
[00:34:56.520 --> 00:34:58.720]   is I forgot how lonely New York got,
[00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:02.480]   because it was like one after another, I lost everybody.
[00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:04.800]   And then you start losing the places you go to.
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:07.400]   And then it was just like, holy crap, I'm very isolated.
[00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:09.280]   And here in Austin, there's not as much to do,
[00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:10.900]   obviously, as in New York.
[00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:12.440]   But there's a lot of people here,
[00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:14.940]   more people are coming all the time.
[00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:18.240]   So if I ever want to hang out with someone,
[00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:19.400]   I've got a long list.
[00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:22.440]   And these are people who I've known for a very long time,
[00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:26.040]   people who know me quite well, so I could be myself,
[00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:29.400]   my awful, awful, awful, awful, awful self.
[00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:32.760]   And that is something I don't take lightly.
[00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:34.880]   - Now you moved to Texas, it's gonna succeed.
[00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:35.720]   - Yeah.
[00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:36.560]   - It's just a very--
[00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:37.840]   - Do you know what happened with that?
[00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:39.400]   - No.
[00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:42.040]   - I forget the guy's name, and it's probably for the best.
[00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:46.680]   Monday, on Monday, a guy in the Texas legislature
[00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:49.760]   introduces a bill to have it on the referendum,
[00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:53.320]   to have a referendum for Texas to declare its independence.
[00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:57.920]   Tuesday, I'm on Rogan, me and him discuss it,
[00:35:57.920 --> 00:35:59.520]   I give it national attention.
[00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:01.200]   It was also really funny because a lot of people are like,
[00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:04.120]   these people have been in Texas five minutes, blah, blah.
[00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:08.600]   I go to the Texas legislature, meet with the guy,
[00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:10.680]   have a nice conversation.
[00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:14.600]   Month or two later, unanimous, I think,
[00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:16.600]   he gets voted, kicked out of Congress
[00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:18.480]   because he got an intern drunk
[00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:20.360]   and was inappropriate with her.
[00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:22.600]   At least it was the girl in this case.
[00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:23.800]   But yeah, so it's like,
[00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:27.320]   that was my little Texas independence moment.
[00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:28.560]   - Oh, it didn't go anywhere.
[00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:29.680]   - It did not go anywhere.
[00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:30.520]   - Wow.
[00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:33.400]   - But it's still part of the platform,
[00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:35.440]   the Texas Republican Party.
[00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:38.120]   - Yeah, it's fascinating that history is probably laden
[00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:41.400]   with stories like this of failed revolutionaries.
[00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:44.160]   We celebrate the heroes, but then there's the losers.
[00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:46.720]   - Myself.
[00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:47.560]   - Yeah.
[00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:52.760]   And we're gonna mark that one as a failure and edit it out.
[00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:55.240]   And moving on.
[00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:57.800]   So thankful, yeah, friendships, right?
[00:36:57.800 --> 00:37:00.320]   But by the way, I wanna say just to you,
[00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:03.280]   I'm thankful in this lonely moments
[00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:05.680]   for people who write books.
[00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:08.960]   I've been listening to audio books a lot and reading a lot.
[00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:11.560]   I really like audio books actually.
[00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:14.120]   And just like, I don't know,
[00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:16.480]   I can just name random person,
[00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:19.280]   Serhii Plokhi is a historian I'm reading on the--
[00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:20.800]   - Wait, I read him.
[00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:23.440]   - I just see he written a book most recently
[00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:25.720]   about the Russia-Ukraine war.
[00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:26.920]   - He wrote another one that I read.
[00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:28.360]   Didn't he write-- - "Empires," I think.
[00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:30.040]   - "The Fall of the Soviet Union," something like that.
[00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:30.880]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:32.240]   - Yeah, it was very, very good.
[00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:33.080]   - He's great.
[00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:34.520]   - I'd use him as a resource for the White Pill.
[00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:37.640]   - He's objective while still having emotion
[00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:38.480]   and feeling to it.
[00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:39.800]   Like he has a bias.
[00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:40.640]   - That's fine.
[00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:45.040]   - But without, a lot of times when you write a story
[00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:48.960]   that involves Putin, people are really ideological.
[00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:53.720]   They don't really like, they don't write with a calmness
[00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:56.880]   and the clarity and the rigor of history.
[00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:58.000]   There's emotion in it.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.560]   Like there's almost a virtue signaling.
[00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:03.200]   And he doesn't have that even though he is Ukrainian
[00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:06.080]   and has very strong opinions on the matter.
[00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:07.280]   Anyway, there's people like that
[00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:10.480]   and he does an incredible job researching
[00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:12.000]   a recent event.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:16.440]   Like he says, "I was looking at everything
[00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:18.880]   "that's been written about the war in Ukraine
[00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:22.200]   "and realizing," you know, the old Churchill line
[00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:25.380]   that historians are the worst ones to write
[00:38:25.380 --> 00:38:27.800]   about current events except everybody else.
[00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:29.740]   And so he's like, "I might as well just write
[00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:30.580]   "about this war."
[00:38:30.580 --> 00:38:33.240]   And he does an exceptional job summarizing day by day
[00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:35.320]   the details of this war.
[00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:37.920]   Anyway, so I'm just grateful for a guy like that
[00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:43.560]   and for me, I'll name some historians I love.
[00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:47.420]   Arthur Herman, Victor Sebastian is probably my favorite.
[00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:51.800]   David Petruccia, P-I-E-T-R-U-S-Z-A.
[00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:55.560]   When you are a historian, and I tried to do this
[00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:58.000]   to some degree in The White Pill as much as I could.
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:01.040]   But yeah, when you take data
[00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:04.800]   and you make it read like a novel,
[00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:08.920]   so you're learning about who we are as people,
[00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:12.360]   what had happened, but also it's entertaining and readable.
[00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:14.640]   That to me is like the acme of writing.
[00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:16.200]   And I have so much admiration.
[00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:17.440]   - What does acme mean?
[00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:19.000]   - Top. - Okay.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.040]   - Zenith. - Zenith, okay.
[00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:21.920]   Is this what writers do?
[00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:24.720]   They just come up with these incredibly sophisticated words?
[00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:25.560]   I'm impressed.
[00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:28.440]   'Cause you could have just said the best of writing.
[00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:30.720]   - Acme is also the company in like Bugs Bunny
[00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:33.820]   and Wile E. Coyote, so it's acme, you know, acme.
[00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:35.520]   - Yeah. - Yeah, like acme bombs.
[00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:40.200]   - Mm-hmm. - When they are that good,
[00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:43.000]   it's just, it leaves me in awe.
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.060]   - It's just the acme. - Ron Chernow's another one.
[00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:47.800]   - Who? - He wrote the Hamilton biography.
[00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:48.960]   - Oh, nice.
[00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:52.040]   Oh, I have a lot of favorite historians
[00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:56.000]   about the whole time period of World War II.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.760]   William Shire, people that lived during it especially.
[00:39:58.760 --> 00:40:00.560]   I really like those accounts.
[00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:04.320]   Obviously, Solzhenitsyn is, he's not a historian,
[00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:08.080]   but his accounts are fascinating.
[00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:10.960]   You actually, how much do you talk about Solzhenitsyn?
[00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:13.720]   - Never. - Not much, right?
[00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:15.120]   Why not?
[00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:17.040]   - I feel like I wanted to,
[00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:20.800]   there's nothing I could add to him.
[00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:23.700]   - Oh, he's the Michael Malice of the previous century.
[00:40:23.700 --> 00:40:28.380]   - No, he's talented, charismatic, and skilled,
[00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:30.400]   so he's not the Michael Malice.
[00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:31.720]   Yeah, I did not,
[00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:36.320]   I feel like I didn't read Gulag Archipelago
[00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:37.560]   for the white pill.
[00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:39.480]   - You didn't? - I didn't, no.
[00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:41.800]   I feel I got a lot of it from Ann Applebaum,
[00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:43.600]   who's a very controversial figure.
[00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:47.560]   Her history books on the Soviet Union I think are superb,
[00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:50.920]   but she's also accused of being very much like a neocon
[00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:52.760]   and being a warmonger in contemporary times.
[00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:54.560]   - Oh, I see. - And I think comparisons
[00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:58.560]   between Putin and Stalin, although there is a Venn diagram,
[00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:00.680]   I think are a bit much
[00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:03.120]   because I think it's very hard to claim
[00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:05.520]   that if Putin conquered Ukraine,
[00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:07.280]   that there'd be a genocide.
[00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:10.040]   I don't think, I think that's a very hard argument to make.
[00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:11.720]   - In these tense times,
[00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:15.040]   even the comparisons of what's going on in Israel
[00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:17.640]   on either side, comparisons to the Holocaust,
[00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:19.000]   are also troubling in this way.
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:22.080]   - Yes, and I also don't like how that,
[00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:25.040]   I got in trouble, there was some literal demon
[00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:27.040]   who works at the Atlantic.
[00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:29.000]   - As opposed to a regular demon?
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:30.440]   - As opposed to a figurative demon.
[00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:32.240]   - I didn't know they employed demons.
[00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:34.960]   - They exclusively employ demons at the Atlantic.
[00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:39.200]   And he was giving me crap just a couple years ago on Twitter
[00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:43.080]   because I didn't think it's appropriate
[00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:46.460]   to refer to George Soros as a Holocaust survivor.
[00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:48.940]   And I'm like, listen, if you wanna put him
[00:41:48.940 --> 00:41:52.960]   in the same context as Anne Frank, knock yourself out.
[00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:56.080]   But I think that's so completely disingenuous
[00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:59.520]   and frankly repulsive to me morally
[00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:02.520]   to equivocate between figures like that.
[00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:06.160]   And also to claim that anyone who is a billionaire,
[00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:10.540]   who is, including Elon, including Sheldon Adelson,
[00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:12.200]   there's no shortage of these people,
[00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:14.200]   if you wanna use your extreme wealth,
[00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:16.200]   use it to influence politics,
[00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:18.160]   you have to be up for criticism.
[00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:20.840]   And to protect people, Bill Gates,
[00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:22.820]   to protect any of these people from criticism
[00:42:22.820 --> 00:42:26.000]   just on the basis of their identity is deranged to me.
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:30.400]   But also the Holocaust as a historical event
[00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:36.040]   and the atrocities within it are just singular in history.
[00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:38.360]   And so comparing them--
[00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:39.720]   - What's the utility, right?
[00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:42.240]   You're just basically trying to take this brand,
[00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:44.500]   I'm using that term in a very specific way,
[00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:47.840]   and latch, like when they say climate denial,
[00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:49.560]   no one's denying climate exists.
[00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:51.440]   So you're just trying to go off of Holocaust denial.
[00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:53.040]   I think it's shameless.
[00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:55.080]   And I think it's gross.
[00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:56.280]   - And it cheapens everything.
[00:42:56.280 --> 00:42:57.120]   - Yeah.
[00:42:57.120 --> 00:42:58.240]   - 'Cause there's deep, important lessons
[00:42:58.240 --> 00:42:59.840]   about the Holocaust.
[00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:01.160]   - Yes.
[00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:06.160]   - To me, the lessons are about how extreme it can get.
[00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:07.560]   - And how fast.
[00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:09.600]   - Yeah, and how fast. - That's the one.
[00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:13.640]   So people ask, oh, are humans basically good?
[00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:15.320]   Are they basically evil?
[00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:17.840]   I always say they're basically animals.
[00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:20.400]   And I think people are,
[00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:23.980]   most people are almost fundamentally deranged.
[00:43:23.980 --> 00:43:25.960]   And that there's basically this veneer
[00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:28.320]   of civilization and decency.
[00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:29.800]   And when shit hits the fan,
[00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:31.500]   and we see this over and over,
[00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:34.320]   they do things that would have been completely unthinkable,
[00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:36.020]   even to themselves five years ago.
[00:43:36.020 --> 00:43:39.120]   - Most people are fundamentally deranged,
[00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:40.560]   with a veneer of civility.
[00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:42.520]   - There's a show called--
[00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:43.840]   - I think I disagree with that.
[00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:45.140]   - Well, what's the show called?
[00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:47.320]   I'm having Alzheimer's 'cause of the advanced age.
[00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:48.520]   - The age.
[00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:49.560]   The skincare. - I think you should,
[00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:52.360]   there's a show called I Think You Should Leave.
[00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:53.640]   It's a sketch comedy show. - I Think You Should Leave.
[00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:54.620]   Okay, sorry.
[00:43:54.620 --> 00:43:56.560]   - It's a sketch comedy show.
[00:43:56.560 --> 00:43:59.960]   And he captures these great,
[00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:01.120]   how's your hair, princess?
[00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:04.260]   He captures these great moments
[00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:09.260]   of just the very thin veneer of normalcy
[00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:10.480]   and just the craziness
[00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:12.800]   that's so frequently lurking underneath.
[00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:14.040]   Another great example of this,
[00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:16.360]   when this is dealing with people who are literally crazy,
[00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:17.680]   have you ever seen the show Hoarders?
[00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:19.400]   So every episode of Hoarders,
[00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:21.340]   there's usually two people in every episode,
[00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:23.880]   but every episode has the same plot line.
[00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:27.040]   Veneer of normalcy, veneer of normalcy,
[00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:28.440]   veneer of normalcy,
[00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:30.440]   slight expression of concern,
[00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:31.840]   but blunt arrangement.
[00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:33.920]   And it always follows that exact pattern.
[00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:36.280]   - Yeah, I don't know.
[00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:41.280]   I think the deep ocean of the human mind is good.
[00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:46.720]   Like there's a longing to be good to others.
[00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:49.200]   - I have seen literally no evidence of this.
[00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:50.940]   And I know everything's a deep ocean with you people,
[00:44:50.940 --> 00:44:52.120]   but like--
[00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:53.280]   - What do you mean you people?
[00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:54.400]   - Pirates.
[00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:55.480]   - Oh.
[00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:56.520]   - I don't see it.
[00:44:56.520 --> 00:44:58.320]   You--
[00:44:58.320 --> 00:44:59.840]   - What's that, Mr. Parrot?
[00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:01.280]   You an anti-Semite?
[00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:04.720]   No, that's not nice to say
[00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:07.080]   in front of such a large audience.
[00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:08.820]   You're embarrassing me, Mr. Parrot.
[00:45:08.820 --> 00:45:10.320]   - Lex, you have--
[00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:11.160]   - What's that, Mr. Parrot?
[00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:12.040]   - You have--
[00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:14.480]   - He's a run-of-the-mill troll
[00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:15.960]   and barely an intellectual?
[00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:17.460]   That's not nice to say.
[00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:18.420]   That's not true.
[00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:20.320]   We talked about this.
[00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:21.840]   You have to see the good in people.
[00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:26.840]   - You have seen personally how quickly and easily it is
[00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:30.760]   for human beings to form outgroups.
[00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:31.600]   - Yeah.
[00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:34.280]   - And to just read others just,
[00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:36.280]   as I just did a minute ago with the Atlantic,
[00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:38.280]   completely out of the human race.
[00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:42.360]   And that happens constantly and very easily.
[00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:44.660]   Humans are tribal beings.
[00:45:44.660 --> 00:45:45.920]   So that does not,
[00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:47.040]   I don't see how that's compatible
[00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:49.300]   with this essential desire to do good.
[00:45:49.300 --> 00:45:51.840]   - No, I think it's like in 1984,
[00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:53.760]   the two minutes of hate.
[00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:57.800]   There is a part of humans that wants to be tribal
[00:45:57.800 --> 00:46:01.560]   and wants to direct, get angry and hateful.
[00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:03.760]   And then that hate is easy to direct.
[00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:04.600]   - Yes.
[00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:08.240]   - By especially people as you, as an anarchist,
[00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:09.780]   talk about little people in power
[00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:11.360]   that can direct that anger.
[00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:15.040]   But I think if you just look at recent human history,
[00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:18.400]   the desire for good, the communal desire for good
[00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:20.180]   outweighs that, I think.
[00:46:20.180 --> 00:46:22.460]   Like most of life on earth right now,
[00:46:22.460 --> 00:46:24.380]   people are being good to each other
[00:46:24.380 --> 00:46:28.300]   in the most fundamental sense
[00:46:28.300 --> 00:46:30.900]   relative to how nature usually works.
[00:46:30.900 --> 00:46:32.380]   - Okay, I think you're both wrong
[00:46:32.380 --> 00:46:34.500]   about people and about nature.
[00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:39.500]   So nature is not inherently violent in the sense like,
[00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:41.900]   for example, if anyone has an aquarium,
[00:46:41.900 --> 00:46:43.820]   or if you look at wildlife,
[00:46:43.820 --> 00:46:45.780]   yeah, you're gonna have predator prey,
[00:46:45.780 --> 00:46:47.340]   but these animals are gonna be coexisting
[00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:48.340]   and they're gonna be ignoring each other
[00:46:48.340 --> 00:46:50.060]   for the most part, right?
[00:46:50.060 --> 00:46:54.080]   And as for humans being essentially good,
[00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:56.080]   I think humans are essentially,
[00:46:56.080 --> 00:46:57.240]   to each other, you said,
[00:46:57.240 --> 00:47:00.680]   I think they're essentially civil and amiable,
[00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:02.760]   but that's not really being good.
[00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:05.160]   - Good, I think, is a thing that gets illustrated
[00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:07.520]   when you're challenged, when there's difficult situations.
[00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:08.360]   - Yes, exactly, yes.
[00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:10.840]   - I mean, civility is a good starting point.
[00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:14.520]   And then when there's a big challenge that comes,
[00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:16.520]   people step up on average.
[00:47:16.980 --> 00:47:18.260]   - I completely agree with you
[00:47:18.260 --> 00:47:21.600]   that human beings are capable of such profound goodness
[00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:25.920]   that it kind of makes you extremely emotional.
[00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:28.660]   And I certainly think that that's true.
[00:47:28.660 --> 00:47:32.460]   But I think that that's more unusual than is the norm.
[00:47:32.460 --> 00:47:34.140]   - I see beauty everywhere.
[00:47:34.140 --> 00:47:36.940]   - So do I, but that doesn't mean it's in every person.
[00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:39.180]   - Not in every person, but in most people.
[00:47:39.180 --> 00:47:41.940]   I think, I mean, I wish there was a really good way
[00:47:41.940 --> 00:47:43.100]   to measure this.
[00:47:43.100 --> 00:47:45.340]   My general sense of the world is just,
[00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:49.420]   there's so much incredible, both in terms of economics,
[00:47:49.420 --> 00:47:53.260]   in terms of art, in terms of just creation as a whole
[00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:55.220]   that's happened over the past century,
[00:47:55.220 --> 00:47:59.980]   that it feels like the good is outpowering the bad.
[00:47:59.980 --> 00:48:04.980]   - You just did the perfect segue to the box.
[00:48:04.980 --> 00:48:08.340]   - What's in the box?
[00:48:08.340 --> 00:48:09.220]   - So--
[00:48:09.220 --> 00:48:10.580]   - Is it your fragile ego?
[00:48:10.580 --> 00:48:15.060]   - You stole my joke, you stole my joke.
[00:48:15.060 --> 00:48:17.740]   That was the joke I made at you before we were recorded.
[00:48:17.740 --> 00:48:18.660]   You stole my joke.
[00:48:18.660 --> 00:48:19.540]   - No, I didn't.
[00:48:19.540 --> 00:48:22.380]   I write all your material, you hack.
[00:48:22.380 --> 00:48:28.580]   - So as you know, I have a lot of beautiful stuff
[00:48:28.580 --> 00:48:31.140]   in my house, 'cause I think it's something very important,
[00:48:31.140 --> 00:48:34.740]   everyone listening, if you accomplish something
[00:48:34.740 --> 00:48:37.260]   that is great, some achievement,
[00:48:37.260 --> 00:48:40.460]   what I like to do is buy myself something
[00:48:40.460 --> 00:48:41.860]   to remember that moment.
[00:48:41.860 --> 00:48:45.620]   'Cause sometimes when it's hard, you forget
[00:48:45.620 --> 00:48:47.060]   you've done great things in your life,
[00:48:47.060 --> 00:48:48.180]   you've had accomplishments.
[00:48:48.180 --> 00:48:50.420]   Doesn't have to be some amazing factory,
[00:48:50.420 --> 00:48:52.260]   it could just be like my first job,
[00:48:52.260 --> 00:48:57.020]   or I got a raise, or you know what, anything.
[00:48:57.020 --> 00:49:03.100]   So there's this amazing sculptor named Jake Michael Singer,
[00:49:03.100 --> 00:49:08.940]   a singer who's a sculptor, and I saw a piece of his--
[00:49:08.940 --> 00:49:10.240]   - How's his singing voice?
[00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:13.280]   This is a joke song.
[00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:15.640]   - Hold on, I can go somewhere with this.
[00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:16.880]   How's his singing voice?
[00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:18.200]   - Do you want me to write your joke for you?
[00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:19.640]   - Yeah, what's the punchline?
[00:49:19.640 --> 00:49:22.240]   Hard!
[00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:24.400]   There it is, that's the one.
[00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:25.360]   - That's what she said.
[00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:30.360]   - So I followed him on Instagram, he followed me back,
[00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:35.520]   and he's like, if I made, he says,
[00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:38.640]   "What's the point of being an artist
[00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:43.320]   "if the work I create isn't in the spaces
[00:49:43.320 --> 00:49:45.680]   "of people I like and admire?"
[00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:48.280]   He's a big fan of yours, you've given him,
[00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:50.200]   and our episodes together give him joy.
[00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:53.600]   So he said, "If I make Lex a sculpture,
[00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:56.320]   "will he put it on the shelf behind him?"
[00:49:56.320 --> 00:50:00.660]   And what that reminded me of is when I was a kid,
[00:50:00.660 --> 00:50:04.240]   you read Batman comics, and there's the Batcave,
[00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:06.200]   and the Batcave has all this cool stuff in it.
[00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:07.960]   I didn't realize until much later
[00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:11.680]   that all of those things in the Batcave had an origin story.
[00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:13.960]   So the giant penny, the dinosaur,
[00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:15.480]   there was actually a story where that came from.
[00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:17.680]   So if you're a fan of a show, you can spot,
[00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:19.060]   "Oh, this is when this appeared,
[00:50:19.060 --> 00:50:20.820]   "this is when that appeared, this is when that appeared."
[00:50:20.820 --> 00:50:25.120]   So he made you this sculpture, he lives in Turkey,
[00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:28.560]   and it's called Chance Murmur,
[00:50:28.560 --> 00:50:30.820]   and it is, I haven't even seen it yet,
[00:50:30.820 --> 00:50:32.880]   it is absolutely beautiful.
[00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:34.920]   - So you wanna do a little unboxing?
[00:50:34.920 --> 00:50:35.760]   - Yes.
[00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:36.580]   - Okay.
[00:50:36.700 --> 00:50:37.540]   - Okay.
[00:50:37.540 --> 00:50:39.220]   Axe or?
[00:50:39.220 --> 00:50:41.460]   - Body spray?
[00:50:41.460 --> 00:50:43.700]   (laughing)
[00:50:43.700 --> 00:50:45.460]   - All right.
[00:50:45.460 --> 00:50:47.220]   - Let's do it. - Let's unbox.
[00:50:47.220 --> 00:50:48.060]   - I'm so excited.
[00:50:48.060 --> 00:50:51.340]   He likes what's out of the box.
[00:50:51.340 --> 00:50:53.420]   (laughing)
[00:50:53.420 --> 00:50:55.700]   - You know that Steven Seagal movie
[00:50:55.700 --> 00:50:58.300]   where there's a stripper that comes out of the box?
[00:50:58.300 --> 00:50:59.140]   - Is there?
[00:50:59.140 --> 00:50:59.960]   - Under siege.
[00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:01.160]   - Okay. - He's on a boat.
[00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:04.660]   - You're not an action film guy.
[00:51:04.660 --> 00:51:05.500]   - No.
[00:51:05.580 --> 00:51:07.820]   (scraping)
[00:51:07.820 --> 00:51:10.740]   - One.
[00:51:10.740 --> 00:51:14.000]   What does the pirate say when he turns 80?
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:16.060]   - What?
[00:51:16.060 --> 00:51:17.060]   - I'm 80.
[00:51:17.060 --> 00:51:21.000]   - I'm 80, oh.
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:22.420]   (laughing)
[00:51:22.420 --> 00:51:23.580]   - Oh.
[00:51:23.580 --> 00:51:26.060]   - See that's how I know you don't like humor.
[00:51:26.060 --> 00:51:27.940]   - I just don't like pirates.
[00:51:27.940 --> 00:51:29.540]   - Well your mom does.
[00:51:29.540 --> 00:51:31.220]   Do you play any musical instruments?
[00:51:31.220 --> 00:51:32.060]   - No.
[00:51:32.060 --> 00:51:35.140]   Neither do you, I've seen your guitar videos.
[00:51:35.140 --> 00:51:35.980]   - Yeah.
[00:51:35.980 --> 00:51:37.900]   - Okay.
[00:51:37.900 --> 00:51:40.980]   Here's a big piece of wood for you.
[00:51:40.980 --> 00:51:43.900]   That's what it feels like just so you know.
[00:51:43.900 --> 00:51:44.740]   - Oh wow.
[00:51:44.740 --> 00:51:49.720]   - Oh my God.
[00:51:49.720 --> 00:51:52.700]   - This traveled across the world.
[00:51:52.700 --> 00:52:00.220]   - So here's why his work speaks so much to me.
[00:52:00.220 --> 00:52:04.020]   So first of all, he's combining
[00:52:04.020 --> 00:52:06.340]   so many different references.
[00:52:06.340 --> 00:52:10.380]   It's Nike, the goddess of victory, right?
[00:52:10.380 --> 00:52:13.300]   It's that, it looks like an angel as well.
[00:52:13.300 --> 00:52:16.660]   The Italian futurists, which is my favorite art movement
[00:52:16.660 --> 00:52:17.940]   from the early 20th century,
[00:52:17.940 --> 00:52:22.260]   they tried to capture motion in 2D or 3D form.
[00:52:22.260 --> 00:52:23.880]   - Well Jake, thank you.
[00:52:23.880 --> 00:52:26.420]   Thank you.
[00:52:26.420 --> 00:52:27.260]   Thank you.
[00:52:27.260 --> 00:52:28.820]   Thank you for creating beautiful things.
[00:52:28.820 --> 00:52:29.900]   - And I-- - Thank you for caring
[00:52:29.900 --> 00:52:32.580]   about somebody like me and somebody like Michael.
[00:52:32.580 --> 00:52:34.220]   I really feel the love.
[00:52:34.220 --> 00:52:35.580]   - That's the other thing. - Thank you.
[00:52:35.580 --> 00:52:40.000]   - When you have something that matters to you in your house
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:42.940]   and you're having a bad day, you can look at it
[00:52:42.940 --> 00:52:46.620]   and remember, you know what I mean, that spirit of joy.
[00:52:46.620 --> 00:52:48.380]   And I actually have a list here.
[00:52:48.380 --> 00:52:49.860]   Okay, I got a little rant ready.
[00:52:49.860 --> 00:52:50.700]   You wanna hear my rant?
[00:52:50.700 --> 00:52:51.540]   - Yeah, let's go.
[00:52:51.540 --> 00:52:54.940]   - One of the things that drives me crazy
[00:52:54.940 --> 00:52:59.020]   is when people, especially conservatives,
[00:52:59.020 --> 00:53:02.740]   think that all contemporary art is ugly or abstract
[00:53:02.740 --> 00:53:04.540]   or like literally garbage.
[00:53:04.540 --> 00:53:06.260]   And there's a lot of that,
[00:53:06.260 --> 00:53:09.220]   but so much of the stuff out there in galleries
[00:53:09.220 --> 00:53:11.940]   is not only not crazy expensive,
[00:53:11.940 --> 00:53:14.580]   but they're trying to sell things for people in their house.
[00:53:14.580 --> 00:53:16.120]   And these are young artists, you know,
[00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:17.800]   they're trying to add beauty.
[00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:19.360]   I have a list.
[00:53:19.360 --> 00:53:20.320]   So if you don't believe me
[00:53:20.320 --> 00:53:22.900]   and you think all contemporary art is garbage or terrible,
[00:53:22.900 --> 00:53:24.620]   go to the website or any of these places
[00:53:24.620 --> 00:53:26.660]   that I'm gonna rattle off, look through them,
[00:53:26.660 --> 00:53:29.540]   and you're telling me that it's not about creating beauty
[00:53:29.540 --> 00:53:30.820]   and joy and things in people's lives.
[00:53:30.820 --> 00:53:33.180]   So I don't have any relationship with any of these people.
[00:53:33.180 --> 00:53:36.340]   These are just some galleries I follow on Instagram.
[00:53:36.340 --> 00:53:40.300]   Outre Gallery, Antler Gallery, Giant Robot 2,
[00:53:40.300 --> 00:53:41.900]   Beinart, I don't know how to pronounce it, I'm sorry,
[00:53:41.900 --> 00:53:45.140]   B-E-I-N-A-R-T, Spoke Art Gallery,
[00:53:45.140 --> 00:53:47.220]   VAR Gallery in Milwaukee, I was there.
[00:53:47.220 --> 00:53:49.020]   The pieces were not expensive at all.
[00:53:49.020 --> 00:53:50.120]   - What kind of art are we talking about?
[00:53:50.120 --> 00:53:51.860]   Everything, paintings? - Mostly paintings.
[00:53:51.860 --> 00:53:52.700]   Mostly paintings.
[00:53:52.700 --> 00:53:54.340]   Some sculptures too, like this.
[00:53:54.340 --> 00:53:56.620]   Corey Halford is my favorite one in LA.
[00:53:56.620 --> 00:53:58.820]   Knight Gallery, Vertical Gallery, Avant Gallery,
[00:53:58.820 --> 00:54:02.300]   Hive Gallery, Haven Gallery, and Curio Art Gallery.
[00:54:02.300 --> 00:54:05.900]   I'm telling you, it's not exorbitant.
[00:54:05.900 --> 00:54:09.060]   This is not the kind of thing where you have to go to a museum
[00:54:09.060 --> 00:54:11.300]   and be like, "This doesn't make sense to me."
[00:54:11.300 --> 00:54:12.260]   You look at it right away, you're like,
[00:54:12.260 --> 00:54:15.440]   "Okay, I know what this is and it's beautiful, it's awesome."
[00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:18.940]   And you're supporting someone who's young and creative
[00:54:18.940 --> 00:54:21.620]   trying to do something and make the world a better place.
[00:54:21.620 --> 00:54:24.180]   So I'm a big fan of the contemporary art scene.
[00:54:24.180 --> 00:54:26.740]   A lot of it is not great,
[00:54:26.740 --> 00:54:28.300]   but even the stuff that's not great
[00:54:28.300 --> 00:54:31.700]   is very rarely disgusting or gross.
[00:54:31.700 --> 00:54:33.500]   It's just like, "Okay, I've seen this before,"
[00:54:33.500 --> 00:54:34.340]   or something like that.
[00:54:34.340 --> 00:54:35.180]   - Okay.
[00:54:35.180 --> 00:54:39.140]   - There's a standup where I'll pay money for the ticket
[00:54:39.140 --> 00:54:40.420]   and someone's like, "Who's an opener?"
[00:54:40.420 --> 00:54:42.220]   It's like, I wouldn't pay to see him perform,
[00:54:42.220 --> 00:54:43.820]   but he seriously still made me laugh.
[00:54:43.820 --> 00:54:47.760]   That person is still by far more good than bad.
[00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:50.080]   So a lot of this art isn't stuff I would own,
[00:54:50.080 --> 00:54:52.340]   but it's like, "Okay, I get it, I like it."
[00:54:52.340 --> 00:54:53.860]   - Well, as the analogy goes,
[00:54:53.860 --> 00:54:56.020]   I really like going to open mics actually,
[00:54:56.020 --> 00:54:59.480]   because, it sounds absurd to say,
[00:54:59.480 --> 00:55:01.280]   but funny isn't the only thing
[00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:04.020]   that's beautiful about standup comedy.
[00:55:04.020 --> 00:55:04.860]   It's the--
[00:55:04.860 --> 00:55:05.680]   (laughs)
[00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:06.520]   - The agony.
[00:55:06.520 --> 00:55:07.860]   (laughs)
[00:55:07.860 --> 00:55:10.020]   - It's going for it.
[00:55:10.020 --> 00:55:11.480]   It's trying to be funny.
[00:55:11.480 --> 00:55:14.420]   It's taking the leap, trying the joke.
[00:55:14.420 --> 00:55:17.100]   And some of the best stuff is actually funny,
[00:55:17.100 --> 00:55:19.060]   but the audience is like three people,
[00:55:19.060 --> 00:55:21.140]   two of whom are drunk and bored,
[00:55:21.140 --> 00:55:22.860]   and you're still going for it.
[00:55:22.860 --> 00:55:25.580]   And that's the human spirit right there.
[00:55:25.580 --> 00:55:29.900]   - Roseanne was telling me how Gilbert Godfrey would go on,
[00:55:29.900 --> 00:55:31.760]   it was like three in the morning,
[00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:34.660]   and it was like her and three other comics in the audience,
[00:55:34.660 --> 00:55:36.940]   and they all were just dying.
[00:55:36.940 --> 00:55:39.180]   He was just killing them.
[00:55:39.180 --> 00:55:40.620]   Who's your favorite comedian?
[00:55:40.620 --> 00:55:44.700]   - Dave Smith.
[00:55:44.700 --> 00:55:45.540]   - Who?
[00:55:45.540 --> 00:55:48.940]   - And cut scene.
[00:55:48.940 --> 00:55:49.780]   Favorite comedian.
[00:55:49.780 --> 00:55:51.340]   - First on Norman McDonald,
[00:55:51.340 --> 00:55:52.780]   if you put a gun to my head
[00:55:52.780 --> 00:55:55.180]   and I had to answer really quickly, that would be him.
[00:55:55.180 --> 00:55:56.020]   - Okay.
[00:55:56.020 --> 00:56:00.100]   - I would also say Louis C.K.
[00:56:00.100 --> 00:56:01.900]   - Oh wow, yeah.
[00:56:01.900 --> 00:56:02.740]   Oh my God, yes.
[00:56:02.740 --> 00:56:04.380]   - But that's almost like a vanilla answer
[00:56:04.380 --> 00:56:07.140]   at this moment in history, because it's like--
[00:56:07.140 --> 00:56:08.980]   - Louis C.K.'s pretty radioactive.
[00:56:08.980 --> 00:56:10.940]   - He is, well, yeah, he does it,
[00:56:10.940 --> 00:56:14.180]   the tough topics, the best.
[00:56:14.180 --> 00:56:19.140]   Mitch Hedberg, the wit of a good one-liner is great.
[00:56:19.140 --> 00:56:22.340]   I guess that's what Norman McDonald's genius at.
[00:56:22.340 --> 00:56:23.820]   What about you?
[00:56:23.820 --> 00:56:27.540]   - I mean, we're so fortunate to be here in Austin
[00:56:27.540 --> 00:56:29.380]   because that comedy "Mothership,"
[00:56:29.380 --> 00:56:31.580]   you go there and people are just killing it.
[00:56:31.580 --> 00:56:33.380]   David Lucas is amazing.
[00:56:33.380 --> 00:56:36.820]   Ty Rivera probably did the best set I've seen
[00:56:36.820 --> 00:56:38.060]   since I've been here in Austin,
[00:56:38.060 --> 00:56:40.460]   and I watched him, and I'm like,
[00:56:40.460 --> 00:56:42.740]   this guy's even bitchier than I am,
[00:56:42.740 --> 00:56:46.100]   so I reached out to him, so he's just terrific.
[00:56:46.100 --> 00:56:48.180]   David Lucas is another one, a buddy of mine.
[00:56:48.180 --> 00:56:50.660]   - You just said it twice, I think.
[00:56:50.660 --> 00:56:53.460]   - I'm thinking Dave Landau, excuse me, Dave Landau.
[00:56:53.460 --> 00:56:55.060]   Joe Mackey. - Old age catching up.
[00:56:55.060 --> 00:56:56.380]   - It's true, though.
[00:56:56.380 --> 00:56:58.100]   - It's true. - It's true.
[00:56:58.100 --> 00:56:59.780]   - It's true. - Dave Lucas.
[00:56:59.780 --> 00:57:02.220]   - You ever been to the comedy "Mothership?"
[00:57:02.220 --> 00:57:03.940]   It's a great spot.
[00:57:03.940 --> 00:57:06.020]   - Where is that, is that in Austin?
[00:57:06.020 --> 00:57:08.780]   - Austin, is that where Willie Nelson's from?
[00:57:08.780 --> 00:57:10.060]   I haven't really, go ahead.
[00:57:10.060 --> 00:57:12.660]   - Oh, I heard a joke about that the other week.
[00:57:12.660 --> 00:57:15.780]   - Tell the joke again.
[00:57:15.780 --> 00:57:18.660]   - What's the only thing worse
[00:57:18.660 --> 00:57:20.820]   than giving head to Willie Nelson?
[00:57:20.820 --> 00:57:23.060]   - What?
[00:57:23.060 --> 00:57:24.940]   - If he says, "I'm not Willie Nelson."
[00:57:24.940 --> 00:57:28.380]   - What's that, Mr. Parrot?
[00:57:28.380 --> 00:57:30.260]   I know he's not funny.
[00:57:30.260 --> 00:57:33.340]   He's better, he thinks he's better on Twitter.
[00:57:33.340 --> 00:57:35.840]   That's not nice to say right in front of his face.
[00:57:35.840 --> 00:57:38.940]   Just think how he feels.
[00:57:38.940 --> 00:57:42.460]   - The statue's Chance Murmur is judging you.
[00:57:42.460 --> 00:57:45.060]   - Chance. - It's called Chance Murmur.
[00:57:45.060 --> 00:57:46.180]   - Chance Murmur.
[00:57:46.180 --> 00:57:47.420]   - God, that's so beautiful.
[00:57:47.420 --> 00:57:48.340]   - That is gorgeous.
[00:57:48.340 --> 00:57:50.300]   - This is another reason I hate cynicism,
[00:57:50.300 --> 00:57:52.460]   and I talk about this a lot.
[00:57:52.460 --> 00:57:56.460]   Even just on Etsy, there's so many small,
[00:57:56.460 --> 00:57:59.060]   not huge companies, like individual artisans
[00:57:59.060 --> 00:58:03.780]   who are creating great stuff and just making it happen,
[00:58:03.780 --> 00:58:06.620]   and it's really sad for me where people can't see that.
[00:58:06.620 --> 00:58:08.460]   Or if they're like, "Well, how could I be excited
[00:58:08.460 --> 00:58:11.340]   "about a sculpture when blah, blah, blah, the Middle East?"
[00:58:11.340 --> 00:58:13.620]   And it's just like, you can always look for an excuse
[00:58:13.620 --> 00:58:15.940]   not to look for joy, or you can look for an excuse
[00:58:15.940 --> 00:58:16.780]   to look for joy.
[00:58:16.780 --> 00:58:18.060]   - Yeah, Etsy's incredible.
[00:58:18.060 --> 00:58:21.220]   I feel the same way about OnlyFans.
[00:58:21.220 --> 00:58:23.180]   I can't even get that out of my mouth
[00:58:23.180 --> 00:58:25.300]   before laughing at my own failed joke.
[00:58:25.300 --> 00:58:26.420]   - That's what she said.
[00:58:26.420 --> 00:58:31.700]   - All right, that might be one of the first
[00:58:31.700 --> 00:58:33.780]   that's what she said from Michael Malice.
[00:58:33.780 --> 00:58:35.420]   - Yeah. - I'm gonna count that.
[00:58:35.420 --> 00:58:39.700]   - I don't know what I'm gonna do with mine,
[00:58:39.700 --> 00:58:40.820]   'cause I got my own.
[00:58:40.820 --> 00:58:42.500]   Mine's three feet tall, just like me.
[00:58:42.500 --> 00:58:43.780]   - Your box was much bigger.
[00:58:43.780 --> 00:58:44.620]   - Yeah.
[00:58:44.620 --> 00:58:47.300]   - And it was giving me an inferiority complex.
[00:58:47.300 --> 00:58:49.460]   I think I'm gonna invade Russia.
[00:58:49.460 --> 00:58:53.900]   That's a Napoleon reference.
[00:58:53.900 --> 00:58:58.060]   For those in the audience.
[00:58:58.060 --> 00:59:00.380]   - I don't know if I'm gonna,
[00:59:00.380 --> 00:59:01.220]   I think I'm gonna put it in my bedroom,
[00:59:01.220 --> 00:59:03.540]   'cause it's the first thing I see when I wake up.
[00:59:03.540 --> 00:59:05.140]   - Put it in the bedroom? - Yeah.
[00:59:05.140 --> 00:59:09.500]   - Do we get through everything we're thankful for?
[00:59:09.500 --> 00:59:11.140]   - No, I've got lots of things I'm thankful for.
[00:59:11.140 --> 00:59:16.140]   - What else, friends, family, we said books.
[00:59:16.140 --> 00:59:19.460]   - I'm thankful for career, I'm thankful for,
[00:59:19.460 --> 00:59:23.940]   I am thankful for, and I know people
[00:59:23.940 --> 00:59:25.500]   are gonna lose their minds,
[00:59:25.500 --> 00:59:28.220]   and I can hear them flipping out already.
[00:59:28.220 --> 00:59:30.100]   I am thankful for social media.
[00:59:30.100 --> 00:59:31.940]   - Yeah.
[00:59:31.940 --> 00:59:32.900]   - I'm thankful for several reasons.
[00:59:32.900 --> 00:59:36.020]   First, it is a way for people to make connections
[00:59:36.020 --> 00:59:38.500]   that they couldn't have made in years past,
[00:59:38.500 --> 00:59:39.860]   that if you got some weird hobby,
[00:59:39.860 --> 00:59:41.940]   you can find that other person's weird hobby,
[00:59:41.940 --> 00:59:43.220]   and you make that connection.
[00:59:43.220 --> 00:59:46.100]   It's a great way to stay in touch permanently for people,
[00:59:46.100 --> 00:59:49.060]   otherwise you'd lose touch with, you know, whatever venue.
[00:59:49.060 --> 00:59:54.060]   And it's also a great way to expose corporate depravity.
[00:59:54.060 --> 00:59:56.940]   When you have these organizations that are dishonest,
[00:59:56.940 --> 00:59:58.700]   I think the community notes thing on Twitter
[00:59:58.700 --> 00:59:59.780]   is the greatest thing ever.
[00:59:59.780 --> 01:00:00.620]   - Yeah, it's incredible.
[01:00:00.620 --> 01:00:02.460]   I wish they would pay attention
[01:00:02.460 --> 01:00:04.500]   to the Michael Malice account more often.
[01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:06.780]   - You shouldn't be encouraging anyone
[01:00:06.780 --> 01:00:08.700]   to pay attention to my Twitter account.
[01:00:08.700 --> 01:00:09.540]   - Yeah.
[01:00:09.540 --> 01:00:10.380]   - It's a fire.
[01:00:10.380 --> 01:00:12.900]   And I don't mean Bridget, I mean like literal,
[01:00:12.900 --> 01:00:13.740]   Bridget Phetasy.
[01:00:13.740 --> 01:00:14.780]   - Oh, Bridget, by the way, is amazing.
[01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:18.060]   But your Twitter account makes, yes, not here.
[01:00:18.060 --> 01:00:19.820]   I wish she did.
[01:00:19.820 --> 01:00:20.780]   - She's in Georgetown.
[01:00:20.780 --> 01:00:23.140]   - No, I mean in this, where we're sitting.
[01:00:23.140 --> 01:00:24.060]   It's a joke, Michael.
[01:00:24.060 --> 01:00:24.900]   - Is it?
[01:00:24.900 --> 01:00:25.740]   - Yeah.
[01:00:25.740 --> 01:00:27.340]   - But I'm just really glad about,
[01:00:27.340 --> 01:00:30.100]   it's another way for people who before
[01:00:30.100 --> 01:00:31.140]   would have felt very alone.
[01:00:31.140 --> 01:00:33.020]   I know it makes some people do feel alone,
[01:00:33.020 --> 01:00:35.380]   but for other people, it makes them feel connected.
[01:00:36.540 --> 01:00:40.020]   - There's been a lot of talk about anti-Semitism recently.
[01:00:40.020 --> 01:00:40.860]   - Yeah.
[01:00:40.860 --> 01:00:42.460]   - What's your sense about this?
[01:00:42.460 --> 01:00:47.100]   Is there, is anti-Semitism like any other brand of hate?
[01:00:47.100 --> 01:00:48.260]   There's a lot of hate out there.
[01:00:48.260 --> 01:00:50.660]   - No, I don't think it's like any other brand of hate.
[01:00:50.660 --> 01:00:55.660]   Because I don't think racists or transphobes
[01:00:55.660 --> 01:01:00.500]   or homophobes or misogynists or xenophobes
[01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:04.900]   argue openly or even not so openly
[01:01:04.900 --> 01:01:07.940]   for the killing of black Americans,
[01:01:07.940 --> 01:01:12.380]   transgender people, gay people, women, or immigrants.
[01:01:12.380 --> 01:01:14.740]   And it's not only something that's talked about,
[01:01:14.740 --> 01:01:16.540]   it's something that has actually happened.
[01:01:16.540 --> 01:01:18.080]   And not just the Holocaust,
[01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:20.720]   but just centuries of pogroms, right?
[01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:24.140]   There's this great book that I read many years ago
[01:01:24.140 --> 01:01:26.300]   called "The Satanization of the Jews."
[01:01:26.300 --> 01:01:28.820]   Camille Paglia recommended it and I read it.
[01:01:28.820 --> 01:01:31.380]   And they live in this certain specific
[01:01:31.380 --> 01:01:32.380]   kind of anti-Semitism.
[01:01:32.380 --> 01:01:34.500]   And again, I'm not talking about people
[01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:35.340]   who are against Israel,
[01:01:35.340 --> 01:01:37.860]   I'm talking specifically about Jew hatred.
[01:01:37.860 --> 01:01:40.260]   They have this moral calculus
[01:01:40.260 --> 01:01:42.140]   that Jews are the only people
[01:01:42.140 --> 01:01:43.920]   who are capable of good or evil,
[01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:46.300]   and Jews are exclusively capable of evil.
[01:01:46.300 --> 01:01:48.500]   And for example, if you look at
[01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:51.240]   the George W. Bush White House,
[01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:53.940]   you had W., you had Cheney, Condoleezza Rice,
[01:01:53.940 --> 01:01:55.840]   Colin Powell, Donald Rumsfeld,
[01:01:55.840 --> 01:01:57.860]   a lot of these neocon advisors.
[01:01:57.860 --> 01:02:00.660]   So if there's 10 people in a room
[01:02:00.660 --> 01:02:03.100]   and there's one Jewish person,
[01:02:03.100 --> 01:02:06.160]   it's his fault and the rest are Jew-controlled.
[01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:12.300]   So again, they only exist as a puppet of Jews
[01:02:12.300 --> 01:02:14.580]   in this kind of worldview.
[01:02:14.580 --> 01:02:16.260]   And it's like that, to me,
[01:02:16.260 --> 01:02:18.520]   if there were no Jews on earth,
[01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:22.180]   it is crazy to say that John Bolton
[01:02:22.180 --> 01:02:24.700]   and Liz Cheney and Lindsey Graham
[01:02:24.700 --> 01:02:26.140]   wouldn't be pushing for more war.
[01:02:26.140 --> 01:02:28.120]   That makes no sense to me.
[01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:30.460]   It's like you blame the Jews
[01:02:30.460 --> 01:02:32.380]   when bad things happen,
[01:02:32.380 --> 01:02:35.140]   but when a Jewish person does something good,
[01:02:35.140 --> 01:02:36.660]   it doesn't really matter.
[01:02:36.660 --> 01:02:39.820]   Or just wait, he's gonna do something bad.
[01:02:39.820 --> 01:02:41.020]   Well, yeah, that's true.
[01:02:41.020 --> 01:02:42.380]   Human beings do good things
[01:02:42.380 --> 01:02:43.980]   and then they do bad things sometimes.
[01:02:43.980 --> 01:02:46.660]   But it only counts when that Jewish person
[01:02:46.660 --> 01:02:47.620]   does the bad thing.
[01:02:47.620 --> 01:02:51.860]   - I wonder what's a way to fight antisemitism
[01:02:51.860 --> 01:02:53.260]   and fight hate in general.
[01:02:53.260 --> 01:02:56.100]   - I think the only, or the best way,
[01:02:56.100 --> 01:02:58.460]   'cause I thought a lot about this,
[01:02:58.460 --> 01:03:02.220]   about how did gay Americans
[01:03:02.220 --> 01:03:06.060]   go from being universally hated and despised
[01:03:06.060 --> 01:03:07.860]   to the point that many people in the '80s
[01:03:07.860 --> 01:03:09.180]   went to their graves,
[01:03:09.180 --> 01:03:11.460]   those who had AIDS, without even telling their parents
[01:03:11.460 --> 01:03:12.780]   'cause they were so scared,
[01:03:12.780 --> 01:03:17.100]   to now Times Square is just covered in pride flags.
[01:03:17.100 --> 01:03:21.020]   And I think, and this also works for Islamophobia
[01:03:21.020 --> 01:03:23.340]   and some of these other bigotry,
[01:03:23.340 --> 01:03:26.480]   is what I call the ambassador program.
[01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:29.220]   Because as soon as you know someone
[01:03:29.220 --> 01:03:31.860]   who is a member of a certain group,
[01:03:31.860 --> 01:03:35.780]   it is a lot harder to be bigoted against them.
[01:03:35.780 --> 01:03:37.820]   Because instead of this being this out group
[01:03:37.820 --> 01:03:39.900]   that's somewhere out there, it's like, wait a minute,
[01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:42.520]   I work with this guy, yeah, he's kind of a jerk.
[01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:45.500]   Maybe he sees things a little differently than me,
[01:03:45.500 --> 01:03:48.380]   but this guy is not a horrible human being.
[01:03:48.380 --> 01:03:52.320]   So I think the only way to fight any form of bigotry
[01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:56.400]   is to be a good example of the counter
[01:03:56.400 --> 01:04:01.400]   to these whatever archetype or stereotype is in the culture.
[01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:06.700]   - Karl Marx wrote that religion is the sigh
[01:04:06.700 --> 01:04:09.340]   of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world
[01:04:09.340 --> 01:04:11.860]   and the soul of a soulless condition.
[01:04:11.860 --> 01:04:15.140]   It is the opium of the people, as the famous phrase goes.
[01:04:15.140 --> 01:04:16.600]   Do you think he has a point?
[01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:18.100]   - No, I hate that quote.
[01:04:18.100 --> 01:04:19.920]   I absolutely hate it.
[01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:24.920]   I despise this sort of Reddit, internet, atheist activism
[01:04:26.300 --> 01:04:30.560]   for the simple reason that I know many people
[01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:34.480]   who in finding faith have become
[01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:37.020]   objectively better human beings.
[01:04:37.020 --> 01:04:39.280]   They start living consciously,
[01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:41.440]   they take morality seriously,
[01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:45.660]   they try, we all fail, to be moral good people.
[01:04:45.660 --> 01:04:48.920]   So this sneering that these midwits,
[01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:50.700]   these marginally intelligent people have
[01:04:50.700 --> 01:04:52.220]   towards religious people.
[01:04:52.220 --> 01:04:55.560]   Now, lots of religious people use religion
[01:04:55.560 --> 01:04:59.400]   to rationalize their bad behavior
[01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:02.660]   or sinful or big ego, so on and so forth.
[01:05:02.660 --> 01:05:04.340]   That exists, that's true.
[01:05:04.340 --> 01:05:07.700]   But to say that it never helps anyone
[01:05:07.700 --> 01:05:12.200]   and it's universally, see Marx was talking about a period,
[01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:16.400]   I'll defend his quote, when his argument was,
[01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:20.840]   the masses are being starved and oppressed
[01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:22.920]   but they're promised, don't worry,
[01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:24.280]   you'll have riches in heaven.
[01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:27.880]   So you should let yourself be pushed around now
[01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:31.480]   and this is this BS bargain that people are being given.
[01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:33.980]   So that was, I think, the point he was making.
[01:05:33.980 --> 01:05:37.020]   It certainly doesn't apply nowadays.
[01:05:37.020 --> 01:05:41.200]   I have a close to the family in the Midwest,
[01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:42.680]   they're good Christian people.
[01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:44.740]   I remember very specifically this guy,
[01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:47.200]   shout out to him, Sean Sherrod,
[01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:49.780]   I went to college with him, David Lucas.
[01:05:49.780 --> 01:05:53.280]   - Have you checked out the Comedy Mothership?
[01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:55.840]   Great, great club. - Where is it, Austin?
[01:05:55.840 --> 01:05:56.680]   - Willie Nelson.
[01:05:56.680 --> 01:06:00.640]   - And I was 17, 18, freshman year
[01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:02.840]   and I was reading all this criticism of the Bible
[01:06:02.840 --> 01:06:03.880]   and I was like, look, this is in there,
[01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:05.880]   look at this in there, and he put his hand on my shoulder
[01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:09.400]   and he says, Michael, there's nothing you're gonna tell me
[01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:11.640]   that's going to make me lose my faith.
[01:06:11.640 --> 01:06:16.240]   And that was a very self-aware and profound thing to say.
[01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:19.360]   As I've gotten older and I know lots of religious people,
[01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:23.960]   there's no part of me that thinks they're wrong
[01:06:23.960 --> 01:06:25.280]   or they should be mocked.
[01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:29.480]   It also reminds me of when people sneer
[01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:31.880]   at addicts in recovery.
[01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:34.000]   They're like, alcoholism is a disease, it's a choice.
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.640]   It's like, wait a minute, you don't know what it's like
[01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:39.520]   to have your entire life ruined by drugs or alcohol.
[01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:41.160]   And if you have to tell yourself,
[01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:43.240]   I have this disease and blah, blah, blah,
[01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:44.800]   and that keeps you from drinking
[01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:49.000]   and now you're a moral, upstanding person who's reliable
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.040]   and takes responsibility for their actions,
[01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:52.960]   I don't see the harm at all.
[01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:57.960]   So I think this kind of activist atheism is cheap.
[01:06:57.960 --> 01:07:00.120]   I don't agree with it whatsoever,
[01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:02.120]   and I do not like that quote at all.
[01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:05.120]   - But otherwise, big fan of Marx.
[01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:09.120]   - I mean, I think there's a fan of mine,
[01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:10.480]   I forget who it was, apologies.
[01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:13.680]   He had this great quote, he goes, and this is me talking,
[01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:18.240]   he goes, "The games people play to feel smarter than others
[01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:20.520]   is depressing and annoying."
[01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:23.560]   And I think this kind of fedora internet atheism
[01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:25.800]   is a good example, 'cause here's the other thing.
[01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:28.320]   If you've proven that someone else is stupid,
[01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:29.320]   that doesn't mean you're smart.
[01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:31.000]   You could both be stupid.
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.680]   So congrats, you proved someone else is stupid, who cares?
[01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:35.680]   - Yeah, and sneering in evolved forms
[01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:39.160]   in general is just not great.
[01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:41.240]   - That's one of the things I block out people
[01:07:41.240 --> 01:07:42.400]   on social media instantly.
[01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:44.680]   You're not gonna sneer at me in my space.
[01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:46.160]   You could sneer at me all you want in your space,
[01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:48.320]   but I'm not putting up with your crap, I don't know you.
[01:07:48.320 --> 01:07:49.960]   - My space, great social network.
[01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:53.500]   - Is that on Sixth Street?
[01:07:53.500 --> 01:07:55.720]   - AOL.com.
[01:07:55.720 --> 01:07:59.560]   (imitates music)
[01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:00.660]   - That's how Lex comes.
[01:08:00.660 --> 01:08:05.680]   - Like Pavlov's dog, that was the sound
[01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:08.700]   before you get to see, spend 10 minutes waiting
[01:08:08.700 --> 01:08:12.400]   for an image of a lady load.
[01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:15.000]   One line at a time.
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.760]   (imitates music)
[01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:23.380]   I recently talked to John Mearshamer.
[01:08:23.380 --> 01:08:25.120]   I don't know if you know him at all.
[01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:31.520]   So he has this idea about offensive realism.
[01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:34.040]   It's a way to analyze the world, international relations.
[01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:37.800]   And the basic idea, and I'll run it by you
[01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:42.800]   and see what you think, is that states,
[01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:48.800]   nations want to survive and they try to do so
[01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:51.100]   by maximizing power, military power.
[01:08:51.100 --> 01:08:53.960]   And he talks about anarchy quite a bit
[01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:57.120]   in that one of these underlying assumptions
[01:08:57.120 --> 01:08:58.760]   of this way of viewing the world
[01:08:58.760 --> 01:09:00.720]   is that states are anarchic towards each other.
[01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:02.200]   - Yes, that's true.
[01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:04.960]   - And they operate under a lot of uncertainty.
[01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:07.160]   States cannot be sure that other states
[01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:09.360]   will not use military capabilities against them.
[01:09:09.360 --> 01:09:10.240]   - Right.
[01:09:10.280 --> 01:09:14.200]   - They want to survive and they want to use military power
[01:09:14.200 --> 01:09:19.880]   to control the uncertainty, to protect themselves.
[01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:22.400]   - So I disagree in that regard.
[01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:26.280]   And I see on your bookshelf, I think the world
[01:09:26.280 --> 01:09:30.500]   is a lot closer to Brave New World than it is to 1984.
[01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:33.080]   And I think it is, if you look at,
[01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:36.280]   let's suppose China's influence in America, right?
[01:09:36.280 --> 01:09:40.440]   The influence is far more through soft power
[01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:42.360]   than military power.
[01:09:42.360 --> 01:09:44.680]   China doesn't threaten America through,
[01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:46.120]   you know, we're gonna kill you.
[01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:48.960]   It's more like their infiltration of universities,
[01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:50.960]   TikTok, things of that nature.
[01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:53.860]   Maybe this would have worked before the pop culture era,
[01:09:53.860 --> 01:09:56.800]   but I think one of the reasons we have
[01:09:56.800 --> 01:10:00.560]   this kind of American hegemony isn't just a function
[01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:03.680]   of American military, I think it's much more a function
[01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:05.260]   of American popular culture.
[01:10:05.260 --> 01:10:08.440]   When you're exporting ideas and culture,
[01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:12.200]   it makes other people in other countries feel closer to you
[01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:14.380]   and also feel, regard you as a friend
[01:10:14.380 --> 01:10:15.640]   and also to adopt your value.
[01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:17.740]   It's a great way to spread propaganda.
[01:10:17.740 --> 01:10:20.760]   - It seems to correlate though, right?
[01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:21.600]   It's interesting.
[01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:24.280]   It's an interesting idea, what has more power,
[01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:29.280]   the viral spread of ideas or the power of the military?
[01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:34.200]   It seems that the United States is at the top
[01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:35.340]   of the world on both.
[01:10:35.340 --> 01:10:36.180]   - That's true.
[01:10:36.180 --> 01:10:38.740]   - And so it's hard to disentangle the two.
[01:10:38.740 --> 01:10:39.880]   - Let's look at Europe.
[01:10:39.880 --> 01:10:45.620]   American culture is very popular in Europe in many ways.
[01:10:45.620 --> 01:10:49.020]   Like the best music comes out of Sweden, Swedish indie pop.
[01:10:49.020 --> 01:10:50.340]   They're singing in English, you know,
[01:10:50.340 --> 01:10:52.340]   even though so on and so forth.
[01:10:52.340 --> 01:10:54.500]   None of this is a function, maybe it's a function
[01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:56.440]   of post-World War II to some extent,
[01:10:56.440 --> 01:10:58.900]   but I don't think it's a function of American bases there.
[01:10:58.900 --> 01:11:02.220]   I think it's a function of we're exporting our music,
[01:11:02.220 --> 01:11:04.440]   our TV shows and our movies.
[01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:06.760]   - Yeah, it's interesting if the battleground
[01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:08.680]   will be Brave New World, the battle of ideas.
[01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:10.720]   - I think it's clearly Brave New World.
[01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:12.780]   It's so much cheaper.
[01:11:12.780 --> 01:11:15.800]   And again, this is one of the dark sides of social media
[01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:19.140]   to use influence than it is to use threats.
[01:11:19.140 --> 01:11:21.600]   I don't think, I think COVID is a good example of this.
[01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:23.800]   Like so much of the pressure,
[01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:25.120]   yes, there was authoritarianism,
[01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:27.360]   but it was the fact that everyone bought into it,
[01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:31.240]   rightly or wrongly, but the vast majority of the population
[01:11:31.240 --> 01:11:33.520]   was behind all of these things.
[01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:35.480]   And that was through persuasion,
[01:11:35.480 --> 01:11:36.640]   and 'cause people are begging for it
[01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:38.280]   to come back in many cases.
[01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:39.600]   - So who's funding you?
[01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:40.920]   Which intelligence agency?
[01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:41.920]   - Mossad.
[01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:43.120]   - Mossad.
[01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:43.960]   Mossad.
[01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:47.160]   This is how you do great interviewing.
[01:11:47.160 --> 01:11:48.980]   See, he didn't even expect that.
[01:11:48.980 --> 01:11:52.040]   Okay.
[01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:53.400]   - What's that, Mr. Parrot?
[01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:55.720]   - What's that, Mr. Parrot?
[01:11:55.720 --> 01:11:59.600]   You knew it, but you didn't have
[01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:00.840]   any documentation, did you?
[01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:04.120]   - I think Mr. Parrot is threatened by better wings.
[01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:06.400]   I chance murmur.
[01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:07.880]   - He gets like that when he's turned on.
[01:12:07.880 --> 01:12:09.440]   He's not threatened.
[01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:10.960]   You can't wait until he's,
[01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:13.560]   all three of us alone together.
[01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:15.560]   It's gonna be one hell of a party.
[01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:17.480]   - Beaks and feathers everywhere.
[01:12:17.480 --> 01:12:18.320]   - And metal.
[01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:23.240]   Yeah, this thing's beautiful.
[01:12:23.240 --> 01:12:24.560]   - It's ridiculous.
[01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:27.120]   - You have actually a lot of really cool stuff
[01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:28.240]   at your place.
[01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:29.080]   - It's so fun.
[01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:33.280]   - What's a cool thing that stands out to you?
[01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:34.960]   Maybe a recent addition.
[01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:39.960]   - So I went to the Dallas Museum of Art last year
[01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:44.160]   for my birthday, and there was a painting I liked.
[01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:46.360]   And I Googled it, and I saw the auction
[01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:48.400]   for that exact painting, and it was like,
[01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:50.880]   I think, three grand, which is not cheap,
[01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:52.200]   but not something you'd think.
[01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:54.000]   You think in a museum, I can never afford
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:55.640]   something like this, right?
[01:12:55.640 --> 01:13:00.640]   So when I was in, I went to Houston with some friends,
[01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:05.520]   the side surfs, Natalie, who made the cake of you.
[01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:07.640]   - Cake terrified my mom.
[01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:08.680]   - It did?
[01:13:08.680 --> 01:13:09.520]   - Yeah.
[01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:10.340]   - Aw.
[01:13:10.340 --> 01:13:11.920]   - No, it's not the cake that terrified my mom.
[01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:15.360]   It's you, Michael Malice, cutting it off,
[01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:20.060]   cutting the face off, and laughing maniacally.
[01:13:20.060 --> 01:13:22.440]   - Well, Natalie's pregnant.
[01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:24.220]   She's gonna have a daughter named Daisy.
[01:13:24.220 --> 01:13:25.880]   So congrats to Natalie.
[01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:27.960]   But I was in the museum with them,
[01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:32.120]   and there was a statue of Thoth,
[01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:34.960]   who's the Egyptian god whose head is an ibis.
[01:13:34.960 --> 01:13:36.520]   It's a bird with a long beak.
[01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:39.200]   And Thoth is the god of the moon, god of knowledge,
[01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:41.560]   and supposedly he invented writing.
[01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:42.560]   So I thought, you know what?
[01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:44.600]   I've always loved ancient Egypt.
[01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:47.040]   I know a lot about it, and especially the mythology.
[01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:50.280]   It'd be really cool as an aspiring author
[01:13:50.280 --> 01:13:54.820]   to have an ancient Egyptian Thoth statue in my house.
[01:13:54.820 --> 01:13:59.260]   Well, it turned out that the Egyptians
[01:13:59.260 --> 01:14:01.560]   also killed and mummified ibises
[01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:03.500]   and buried them with scribes.
[01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:06.340]   And a week after I went to the museum,
[01:14:06.340 --> 01:14:09.340]   there was an auction for an ibis mummy,
[01:14:09.340 --> 01:14:13.340]   and I have it now in my house, still in its bandages,
[01:14:13.340 --> 01:14:16.020]   overlooking my desk, and we all know
[01:14:16.020 --> 01:14:18.220]   it's gonna come to life and peck out my eyes
[01:14:18.220 --> 01:14:19.360]   and write with my blood,
[01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:21.720]   but that is one of the recent cool additions.
[01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:23.360]   Another thing I have, which is like,
[01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:25.240]   in terms of, holy crap, I've made it,
[01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:27.840]   I have an original Patrick Nagle painting.
[01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:29.400]   And if people don't know the name,
[01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:31.160]   he's like the '80s artist.
[01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:33.120]   He did the Duran Duran cover.
[01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:34.520]   We never see him in nail salons.
[01:14:34.520 --> 01:14:37.640]   I have a male, which were very rare for him to do.
[01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:40.080]   So that's two of my kind of favorite pieces.
[01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:41.800]   He only drew women predominantly.
[01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:43.120]   I have one where he drew a male,
[01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:45.680]   like it's a guy in a, like a jeanette or something.
[01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:48.100]   And now I'm looking forward to,
[01:14:48.100 --> 01:14:50.940]   so Jake made me a three-foot-tall sculpture
[01:14:50.940 --> 01:14:55.940]   called "Future Murmur," which I am ecstatic to get.
[01:14:55.940 --> 01:15:02.220]   - Just reminds yourself of how many fascinating,
[01:15:02.220 --> 01:15:04.060]   beautiful people that are out there.
[01:15:04.060 --> 01:15:08.100]   - And just the victory and holiness
[01:15:08.100 --> 01:15:09.940]   and technology and speed,
[01:15:09.940 --> 01:15:14.180]   and how many people have fought
[01:15:14.180 --> 01:15:15.580]   so that I could do what I do.
[01:15:16.540 --> 01:15:18.880]   - Yeah, that's another thing I'm grateful for.
[01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:23.320]   Just like the 100 billion or so people that came before us.
[01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:24.900]   - Yeah.
[01:15:24.900 --> 01:15:27.440]   - And also the trillions of life forms
[01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:28.600]   that came before that.
[01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:33.560]   - Oh God, I've gone down this trilobite rabbit hole,
[01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:35.200]   buying fossils, 'cause as a kid,
[01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:36.520]   I thought trilobites were the coolest thing,
[01:15:36.520 --> 01:15:38.400]   and now I've got like 15.
[01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:41.320]   And what's interesting is when you buy trilobite fossils
[01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:43.080]   on eBay, they're listed as used.
[01:15:45.060 --> 01:15:46.300]   'Cause it's gotta be new or used
[01:15:46.300 --> 01:15:48.780]   and according to the programming, so it's used, yeah.
[01:15:48.780 --> 01:15:53.460]   - Yeah, but just thinking about all that history,
[01:15:53.460 --> 01:15:56.340]   just all the life forms that came before,
[01:15:56.340 --> 01:15:59.660]   it seems like a really special thing
[01:15:59.660 --> 01:16:01.340]   we have going on on Earth here.
[01:16:01.340 --> 01:16:04.580]   - Oh, yeah, I think that's very fair to say.
[01:16:04.580 --> 01:16:08.820]   But I also think this kind of is like
[01:16:08.820 --> 01:16:10.420]   live life to the fullest.
[01:16:10.420 --> 01:16:13.700]   You know, Camus talked about living to the point of tears,
[01:16:13.700 --> 01:16:14.820]   especially on behalf of people
[01:16:14.820 --> 01:16:16.420]   who didn't have that privilege.
[01:16:16.420 --> 01:16:18.960]   So, you know, I dedicated the white pill
[01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:21.060]   to my parents who got me out of the Soviet Union
[01:16:21.060 --> 01:16:22.980]   and all the kids who never could.
[01:16:22.980 --> 01:16:26.280]   And it's like, when I die, I want everyone else to,
[01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:27.920]   not only, they're obviously gonna be happy,
[01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:29.840]   but yeah, like I'm not here.
[01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:31.880]   Enjoy what you, live for me,
[01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:33.980]   'cause I can't have that privilege anymore.
[01:16:33.980 --> 01:16:38.000]   - What do you think about Camus as a writer?
[01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:39.720]   - I don't like his novels at all.
[01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:41.080]   - Oh, you don't? - At all.
[01:16:41.080 --> 01:16:42.960]   - Yeah, you've talked shit about the plague to me.
[01:16:42.960 --> 01:16:46.280]   - Yeah, I think the book is pointless.
[01:16:46.280 --> 01:16:47.120]   - It's fascinating.
[01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:48.720]   - 'Cause all you need to do is read the synopsis
[01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:49.560]   and then you get it.
[01:16:49.560 --> 01:16:50.400]   Like, I don't think his book--
[01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:51.920]   - It's not true for most books.
[01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:53.200]   - No.
[01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:55.200]   - I mean, like, you could take, I don't know,
[01:16:55.200 --> 01:16:56.760]   I just don't agree at all.
[01:16:56.760 --> 01:16:59.180]   I mean, it's a catcher in the rye.
[01:16:59.180 --> 01:17:02.040]   There's a lot of books that seem trivial.
[01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:03.640]   - I don't think it seems trivial, but I think--
[01:17:03.640 --> 01:17:04.560]   - Animal Farm.
[01:17:04.560 --> 01:17:09.500]   - Animal Farm is a methodical step-by-step examination
[01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:11.760]   of a transformation from one thing to another.
[01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:13.920]   The plague is not that.
[01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:17.600]   - It's a methodical examination
[01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:21.960]   of what a society is like under the plague,
[01:17:21.960 --> 01:17:23.460]   which could symbolize a lot of things,
[01:17:23.460 --> 01:17:24.800]   including the plague directly,
[01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:29.080]   or Nazi Germany, or ideological movements.
[01:17:29.080 --> 01:17:32.160]   It's similar to Animal Farm, maybe not as effective
[01:17:32.160 --> 01:17:34.760]   in terms of using this kind of symbology.
[01:17:34.760 --> 01:17:37.080]   - I think Animal Farm has a narrative,
[01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:40.480]   and I'm gonna spoil the whole plague, the book The Plague.
[01:17:40.480 --> 01:17:41.400]   - Okay.
[01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:44.240]   - There's a town, I believe, in Oman.
[01:17:44.240 --> 01:17:48.720]   A plague descends, people struggle to deal with it,
[01:17:48.720 --> 01:17:51.440]   and the plague vanishes as quickly as it came, the end.
[01:17:51.440 --> 01:17:53.600]   - Yeah, but there's the victims,
[01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:55.480]   the people that take advantage of it,
[01:17:55.480 --> 01:17:57.880]   there's the doctor that, amidst the absurdity
[01:17:57.880 --> 01:18:01.600]   and the evil of the plague, is fighting to do good.
[01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:03.320]   - Nothing for me, there's nothing for me.
[01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:05.600]   - Okay, well, I could spoil Animal Farm.
[01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:10.180]   There's pigs, there's animals at a farm.
[01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:14.560]   And the humans are abusing them,
[01:18:14.560 --> 01:18:17.680]   and then the animals overthrow the humans.
[01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:22.680]   But then, the pigs become just like the humans.
[01:18:22.680 --> 01:18:27.960]   The lesson, kids, is that power corrupts
[01:18:27.960 --> 01:18:31.080]   no matter whether you walk on four or on two.
[01:18:31.080 --> 01:18:33.000]   - I thought the lesson was that pigs
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.880]   are the most human-like animals on the farm.
[01:18:35.880 --> 01:18:38.560]   - I thought the lesson was that
[01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:40.260]   there's no sugarcane mountain.
[01:18:41.160 --> 01:18:43.520]   - That's right, yeah.
[01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:44.960]   You've interviewed a lot of people.
[01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:45.800]   - Yeah.
[01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:49.040]   - What have you learned about getting
[01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:52.440]   to the soul of a person, the soul of an idea,
[01:18:52.440 --> 01:18:53.840]   from interviewing?
[01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:55.240]   Just how to do a good interview.
[01:18:55.240 --> 01:18:57.000]   - First off, I'm not interviewing just random people.
[01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:58.880]   I'm interviewing people who are accomplished.
[01:18:58.880 --> 01:18:59.880]   It's not a random group.
[01:18:59.880 --> 01:19:02.160]   That's self-selecting for something different.
[01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:06.600]   But I think that people love to,
[01:19:06.600 --> 01:19:09.340]   and this is very understandable, love to feel seen.
[01:19:10.420 --> 01:19:12.360]   So if you're someone who's done something,
[01:19:12.360 --> 01:19:15.680]   even if you're the best guinea pig breeder in America,
[01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:17.640]   to have someone interested in your work
[01:19:17.640 --> 01:19:20.120]   and listen to what you're saying.
[01:19:20.120 --> 01:19:22.920]   'Cause I remember every book I've written,
[01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:25.160]   I have friends and I wouldn't stop talking about
[01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:28.960]   the person I'm writing with or the North Korea.
[01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:30.440]   At a certain point, I'm sure they're like,
[01:19:30.440 --> 01:19:31.720]   all right, I don't care about this anymore.
[01:19:31.720 --> 01:19:33.600]   But it takes over your brain, you know what I mean?
[01:19:33.600 --> 01:19:37.040]   So if you are someone who has an interest or a hobby,
[01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:39.320]   I'm sure to some extent, maybe your friends or family
[01:19:39.320 --> 01:19:40.300]   are sick of talking about it,
[01:19:40.300 --> 01:19:41.980]   or you don't wanna talk about it with them.
[01:19:41.980 --> 01:19:44.340]   That's the private life where you could just be yourself.
[01:19:44.340 --> 01:19:49.340]   So I try to, and this comes from my co-authoring background,
[01:19:49.340 --> 01:19:51.940]   when I'm talking to people to ask the questions
[01:19:51.940 --> 01:19:53.820]   that they haven't heard before.
[01:19:53.820 --> 01:19:58.820]   There's a possibility that this actor I'm a huge fan of
[01:19:58.820 --> 01:20:02.580]   is gonna be on my show.
[01:20:02.580 --> 01:20:04.380]   I don't wanna spoil everything.
[01:20:04.380 --> 01:20:07.380]   And he's got a very specific role that he's known for.
[01:20:07.380 --> 01:20:09.880]   And I know I'm gonna, I'm like, okay,
[01:20:09.880 --> 01:20:10.960]   I know it's gonna be annoying for you
[01:20:10.960 --> 01:20:12.360]   talking about this one role,
[01:20:12.360 --> 01:20:15.560]   but my goal is to ask questions that you aren't sick
[01:20:15.560 --> 01:20:18.660]   of asking, having been asked.
[01:20:18.660 --> 01:20:19.620]   - Porn star or?
[01:20:19.620 --> 01:20:21.960]   - Not a porn star.
[01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:26.040]   - That joke failed also, edit out.
[01:20:26.040 --> 01:20:30.000]   What do you know about breeding guinea pigs?
[01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:31.060]   You mentioned it.
[01:20:31.060 --> 01:20:32.040]   I'd love to hear.
[01:20:32.040 --> 01:20:32.880]   - I don't know anything.
[01:20:32.880 --> 01:20:35.080]   - I'd love to hear more about it.
[01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:36.440]   - I always use this as an example.
[01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:38.500]   So there's, you meet someone at a party
[01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:39.700]   who breeds guinea pigs, right?
[01:20:39.700 --> 01:20:41.740]   There's two approaches.
[01:20:41.740 --> 01:20:44.720]   Either you're weird, get it okay,
[01:20:44.720 --> 01:20:46.580]   or sit down and tell me everything.
[01:20:46.580 --> 01:20:49.640]   And I'm very much, and all the people I like
[01:20:49.640 --> 01:20:51.420]   are the second group.
[01:20:51.420 --> 01:20:53.440]   When you meet someone who's doing something unusual
[01:20:53.440 --> 01:20:57.080]   and are passionate about it and are good at it,
[01:20:57.080 --> 01:21:00.080]   like that to me is the motherlode.
[01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:03.920]   - Yeah, that to me also is the thing I enjoy the most.
[01:21:03.920 --> 01:21:05.620]   It's like people that are passionate.
[01:21:05.620 --> 01:21:06.960]   - People that are passionate about a thing.
[01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:07.800]   - Who do you guys hate?
[01:21:07.800 --> 01:21:09.240]   Do you guys hate the hamster people?
[01:21:09.240 --> 01:21:10.360]   Do you hate the rabbit people?
[01:21:10.360 --> 01:21:13.000]   There's gotta be someone that you guys look down on.
[01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:14.360]   'Cause like the marine aquarium people
[01:21:14.360 --> 01:21:15.920]   look down on the freshwater aquarium people.
[01:21:15.920 --> 01:21:17.340]   - Yeah, it's a hierarchy.
[01:21:17.340 --> 01:21:18.960]   - Yes, there's always gonna be a hierarchy.
[01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:21.040]   This is where the left anarchists and I disagree
[01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:23.120]   'cause they think you could have egalitarianism.
[01:21:23.120 --> 01:21:24.240]   There's gonna be a hierarchy.
[01:21:24.240 --> 01:21:25.320]   - Hierarchies emerge.
[01:21:25.320 --> 01:21:26.260]   - Yes.
[01:21:26.260 --> 01:21:28.680]   - There's no anarchy in the guinea pig world.
[01:21:28.680 --> 01:21:31.960]   - No, it's just a different kind of anarchy.
[01:21:31.960 --> 01:21:34.240]   - Somebody's always breeding somebody else.
[01:21:34.240 --> 01:21:35.240]   - Yes.
[01:21:35.240 --> 01:21:37.840]   - And looking down on the others.
[01:21:37.840 --> 01:21:39.220]   - If someone's the other.
[01:21:39.220 --> 01:21:40.060]   - Yeah.
[01:21:40.060 --> 01:21:41.320]   - Whether it's the hamster people, the rat people.
[01:21:41.320 --> 01:21:42.560]   - And everybody's breeding.
[01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:43.400]   - Yeah.
[01:21:43.400 --> 01:21:47.280]   - By the way, are you an anarcho-capitalist?
[01:21:47.280 --> 01:21:49.760]   What kind of, what flavor of anarchist are you?
[01:21:49.760 --> 01:21:51.640]   - I'm an anarchist without adjectives.
[01:21:51.640 --> 01:21:52.960]   I like them all.
[01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:54.440]   The black flag comes in many colors.
[01:21:54.440 --> 01:21:56.400]   - All right, all right, you're quoting your own.
[01:21:56.400 --> 01:21:57.240]   No, I understand.
[01:21:57.240 --> 01:21:59.480]   It's a beautiful line in the book.
[01:21:59.480 --> 01:22:00.740]   - Thank you.
[01:22:00.740 --> 01:22:03.160]   I think the anarcho-capitalists don't give
[01:22:03.160 --> 01:22:05.360]   the left anarchists enough credit,
[01:22:05.360 --> 01:22:07.640]   especially for their courage.
[01:22:07.640 --> 01:22:10.760]   And I do whatever I can in my power
[01:22:10.760 --> 01:22:13.620]   to talk about people like Emma Goldman whenever possible.
[01:22:13.620 --> 01:22:18.480]   - Do you still think that are some people better than others
[01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:20.120]   is a good litmus test?
[01:22:20.120 --> 01:22:22.300]   - Yes, it's worked 100% of the time.
[01:22:22.300 --> 01:22:25.520]   - And for you, the answer is yes.
[01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:26.520]   - I never answered.
[01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:30.720]   - There's two of them.
[01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:32.960]   (laughing)
[01:22:32.960 --> 01:22:37.080]   What are you getting, a little Hitchcock up in here?
[01:22:37.080 --> 01:22:38.520]   - Oh, hey, careful.
[01:22:38.520 --> 01:22:42.340]   I always got your back.
[01:22:42.340 --> 01:22:47.840]   What little habits in your life make you happy?
[01:22:47.840 --> 01:22:49.880]   Now that you're in Austin.
[01:22:49.880 --> 01:22:50.760]   - Oh my God.
[01:22:50.760 --> 01:22:57.040]   I was prepping for this interview
[01:22:57.040 --> 01:22:59.680]   and I imagined this coming up.
[01:23:00.680 --> 01:23:04.260]   And I knew that as I explained this,
[01:23:04.260 --> 01:23:10.040]   you know how sometimes when someone tells a story,
[01:23:10.040 --> 01:23:12.120]   like at first it's amusing,
[01:23:12.120 --> 01:23:14.240]   then it's amusing and concerned,
[01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:16.160]   and then you're like, holy shit,
[01:23:16.160 --> 01:23:17.920]   like where's the exit?
[01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:20.440]   - Yeah, I'm getting nervous already.
[01:23:20.440 --> 01:23:21.280]   - You should.
[01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:23.780]   So I'm going to tell you something
[01:23:23.780 --> 01:23:25.480]   I've told only a couple of people.
[01:23:27.680 --> 01:23:32.040]   This is my absolutely off the charts
[01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:36.140]   autistic approach to shaving.
[01:23:36.140 --> 01:23:42.840]   So I have this insane system.
[01:23:42.840 --> 01:23:44.360]   You asked about habits that give me joy.
[01:23:44.360 --> 01:23:45.400]   I used to hate shaving.
[01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:46.600]   I used to hate it.
[01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:49.400]   There's something called wet shaving.
[01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:53.240]   So wet shaving is you get the brush,
[01:23:53.240 --> 01:23:55.240]   you get the soap that's in a canister,
[01:23:55.240 --> 01:23:57.040]   you stir it up, you paint your face,
[01:23:57.040 --> 01:23:58.240]   and then you shave.
[01:23:58.240 --> 01:24:03.240]   The thing is there are dozens
[01:24:03.240 --> 01:24:06.000]   of these shaving soap companies.
[01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:07.040]   Okay?
[01:24:07.040 --> 01:24:11.200]   So I tried a couple of hundred of these soaps
[01:24:11.200 --> 01:24:13.860]   'cause you're testing for scent,
[01:24:13.860 --> 01:24:17.320]   you're testing for what the lather thickness,
[01:24:17.320 --> 01:24:19.660]   and also how smooth of a shave it gives you.
[01:24:19.660 --> 01:24:22.800]   I have it down.
[01:24:24.440 --> 01:24:25.280]   I'm not making this up.
[01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:26.640]   I'm not this creative.
[01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:29.600]   I have it down to a cycle of 67 soaps.
[01:24:29.600 --> 01:24:30.440]   - Yeah.
[01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:31.260]   - Okay?
[01:24:31.260 --> 01:24:32.100]   - A cycle.
[01:24:32.100 --> 01:24:32.940]   - A cycle.
[01:24:32.940 --> 01:24:33.760]   So 67.
[01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:34.600]   - Yeah.
[01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:37.800]   - When I use up one soap,
[01:24:37.800 --> 01:24:42.800]   that is a slot that I will have to try new ones.
[01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:45.640]   And I will try new ones in that slot
[01:24:45.640 --> 01:24:47.260]   until I get one that I like,
[01:24:47.260 --> 01:24:48.720]   and then that slot is filled.
[01:24:48.720 --> 01:24:51.940]   So right now I have 67 that I use,
[01:24:51.940 --> 01:24:55.280]   and I have 86 that I--
[01:24:55.280 --> 01:24:56.120]   - Candidates.
[01:24:56.120 --> 01:24:56.940]   - Candidates.
[01:24:56.940 --> 01:24:57.780]   - Yeah.
[01:24:57.780 --> 01:24:58.620]   - In the queue.
[01:24:58.620 --> 01:24:59.440]   - Do you label them?
[01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:00.280]   Do you remember which one is which?
[01:25:00.280 --> 01:25:01.960]   - Well, they all have beautiful labels.
[01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:02.800]   I mean, these are artisans
[01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:04.880]   who are creating these amazing things.
[01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:08.520]   So I would encourage everyone to try this hobby.
[01:25:08.520 --> 01:25:09.360]   Who's a guy?
[01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:10.560]   It's so much fun.
[01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:12.640]   I will give a shout out to the companies
[01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:14.560]   that are the best.
[01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:17.380]   So the best company, in my opinion,
[01:25:17.380 --> 01:25:20.480]   is a company called, they just changed the name
[01:25:21.340 --> 01:25:23.280]   because you know what they were originally called?
[01:25:23.280 --> 01:25:24.560]   I'm not joking.
[01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:25.700]   Grooming department.
[01:25:25.700 --> 01:25:28.320]   And now it's like--
[01:25:28.320 --> 01:25:29.320]   - It's not a bad name.
[01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:30.980]   - Yeah, but it has certain connotations
[01:25:30.980 --> 01:25:31.920]   in contemporary discourse.
[01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:32.760]   So now he changed--
[01:25:32.760 --> 01:25:33.580]   - Contemporary discourse, yes.
[01:25:33.580 --> 01:25:36.400]   - He changed his name to Ion Skin Care, A-I-O-N.
[01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:39.080]   That's the sense of the most sophisticated,
[01:25:39.080 --> 01:25:42.880]   the most diverse, and the soap is just really high quality.
[01:25:42.880 --> 01:25:47.980]   Another amazing company is Barrister and Man.
[01:25:47.980 --> 01:25:51.280]   And if I'm gonna tell you to try one, it's called Cheshire.
[01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:54.240]   He comes out with new ones every month or so.
[01:25:54.240 --> 01:25:56.400]   A lot of it's miss, a lot of it's hit.
[01:25:56.400 --> 01:25:58.920]   Just great, great quality stuff.
[01:25:58.920 --> 01:26:01.320]   Another great company is Chiseled Face.
[01:26:01.320 --> 01:26:02.800]   They make something called Midnight Stag,
[01:26:02.800 --> 01:26:04.320]   which basically smells like a garage.
[01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:06.640]   It's one of my favorite soaps of all time.
[01:26:06.640 --> 01:26:09.980]   - Yeah, what makes for a good smell for Michael Miles?
[01:26:09.980 --> 01:26:11.920]   - I have 67 answers.
[01:26:11.920 --> 01:26:12.760]   So some of them smell--
[01:26:12.760 --> 01:26:14.320]   - So you can't put it into--
[01:26:14.320 --> 01:26:17.640]   - Some are citrusy, some are industrial, some--
[01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:19.040]   - So garage is more industrial.
[01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:20.240]   - It smells like a garage, yeah.
[01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:21.880]   Midnight Stag, it smells like a garage.
[01:26:21.880 --> 01:26:24.140]   Some are fun 'cause there's smells
[01:26:24.140 --> 01:26:25.200]   that smell like other things.
[01:26:25.200 --> 01:26:27.380]   For example, there's a scent in my queue
[01:26:27.380 --> 01:26:30.040]   called Finding Scotty, it smells like Swedish fish.
[01:26:30.040 --> 01:26:34.180]   Another great company is Phoenix Shaving.
[01:26:34.180 --> 01:26:37.240]   And they have one called Aloha Smackdown,
[01:26:37.240 --> 01:26:38.660]   smells like Hawaiian Punch.
[01:26:38.660 --> 01:26:40.520]   They had one called Yule Ham
[01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:42.620]   that they made for me special, smells like a ham.
[01:26:42.620 --> 01:26:45.480]   They had a ramen one, Rockin' Ramen,
[01:26:45.480 --> 01:26:47.200]   smells like cup of noodles.
[01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:48.840]   So they're a great, and every year they do
[01:26:48.840 --> 01:26:51.280]   an advent calendar where for 12 days
[01:26:51.280 --> 01:26:53.120]   you have a little sample of a soap
[01:26:53.120 --> 01:26:54.640]   and a sample of the aftershave.
[01:26:54.640 --> 01:26:55.800]   - Nice.
[01:26:55.800 --> 01:26:58.480]   - So those are, I'm forgetting someone
[01:26:58.480 --> 01:27:00.920]   and I'm feeling angry that I'm doing it,
[01:27:00.920 --> 01:27:05.300]   but those are some of the, oh, and Katie's Bubbles is great.
[01:27:05.300 --> 01:27:08.120]   They're vegan out of New Jersey.
[01:27:08.120 --> 01:27:10.240]   They've got one called Knee High to a Grape,
[01:27:10.240 --> 01:27:11.400]   smells like grape soda.
[01:27:11.400 --> 01:27:16.440]   I think those are the biggest names off the top of my head.
[01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:19.840]   - Will that list converge down to a small set eventually
[01:27:19.840 --> 01:27:22.080]   or no, 67 down to?
[01:27:22.080 --> 01:27:23.920]   - Well, no, it's down to, it's 67.
[01:27:23.920 --> 01:27:25.800]   - Oh, so it always keeps--
[01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:28.040]   - Right, so if there's a slot, then, you know what I mean?
[01:27:28.040 --> 01:27:29.520]   Like I'll fill that, you know what I'm saying?
[01:27:29.520 --> 01:27:31.920]   - Oh, so you will forever have the variety of 67.
[01:27:31.920 --> 01:27:32.740]   - Yes.
[01:27:32.740 --> 01:27:34.480]   - Huh.
[01:27:34.480 --> 01:27:36.640]   You know what?
[01:27:36.640 --> 01:27:38.680]   You know how sad my brain is?
[01:27:38.680 --> 01:27:41.560]   When you were telling me this, I was like,
[01:27:41.560 --> 01:27:46.560]   I wonder how many soaps are left in Michael Malice's life.
[01:27:46.560 --> 01:27:49.920]   Like you can count your life by days, by months,
[01:27:49.920 --> 01:27:51.680]   by years, or by soaps.
[01:27:51.680 --> 01:27:53.760]   - That is depressing, that is very dark.
[01:27:53.760 --> 01:27:56.840]   - 'Cause each experience of shaving
[01:27:56.840 --> 01:27:58.320]   is a little beautiful experience.
[01:27:58.320 --> 01:27:59.160]   - Yes, it is.
[01:27:59.160 --> 01:28:01.320]   - And how many do you have left in your life, right?
[01:28:01.320 --> 01:28:02.280]   - That's true.
[01:28:02.280 --> 01:28:03.120]   - Yeah.
[01:28:03.120 --> 01:28:04.260]   - I gotta tell you, there's something else.
[01:28:04.260 --> 01:28:06.480]   There's a term called, my friend Jackie
[01:28:06.480 --> 01:28:07.860]   taught me called touching pan.
[01:28:07.860 --> 01:28:09.240]   It's a makeup term.
[01:28:09.240 --> 01:28:12.520]   So basically when you use it and you can see the bottom,
[01:28:12.520 --> 01:28:14.400]   that's like a big moment.
[01:28:14.400 --> 01:28:15.360]   - Oh, it's a great thing.
[01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:17.040]   - Yeah, it's like, well, it's kind of fun.
[01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:19.240]   I'm telling you, like people can scoff.
[01:28:19.240 --> 01:28:22.440]   It is such a fun, and there's a lot of us online
[01:28:22.440 --> 01:28:23.640]   who are into this whole space.
[01:28:23.640 --> 01:28:24.800]   It's really, really fun.
[01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:26.720]   - When did you first discover this?
[01:28:26.720 --> 01:28:27.840]   - Can I curse?
[01:28:27.840 --> 01:28:29.280]   - Yeah.
[01:28:29.280 --> 01:28:32.080]   - Fuck you, Cole Striker.
[01:28:32.080 --> 01:28:35.360]   'Cause I was staying at my friend Cole's house in LA.
[01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:36.200]   Fuck you, Cole.
[01:28:36.200 --> 01:28:37.040]   - Fuck you, Cole.
[01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:39.320]   - Cole is like one of the biggest hipsters I know.
[01:28:39.320 --> 01:28:42.480]   He's got the shirts with the pearl snaps and everything.
[01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:44.720]   And I'm staying at his house 'cause I was doing Rogan.
[01:28:44.720 --> 01:28:47.520]   And he goes, "Oh, have you heard of this wet shaving thing?"
[01:28:47.520 --> 01:28:49.320]   And he goes, "Look, this one's Pro Rezo."
[01:28:49.320 --> 01:28:51.000]   That's like the Italian grandpa soap,
[01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:52.340]   which is also a great one.
[01:28:52.340 --> 01:28:55.880]   And I went down this rabbit hole and I'm like,
[01:28:55.880 --> 01:28:57.840]   I don't even know how much money I spent on this.
[01:28:57.840 --> 01:28:59.440]   And it's all 'cause of him.
[01:28:59.440 --> 01:29:01.160]   - Oh, but it's like a happy fuck you.
[01:29:01.160 --> 01:29:02.720]   Like, fuck you, Cole.
[01:29:02.720 --> 01:29:03.560]   I love you, Cole.
[01:29:03.560 --> 01:29:05.000]   Fuck you.
[01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:05.840]   Thank you.
[01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:07.080]   - Yes.
[01:29:07.080 --> 01:29:08.400]   - That's a good idea for a tattoo.
[01:29:08.400 --> 01:29:09.320]   Fuck you, Cole.
[01:29:09.320 --> 01:29:12.000]   (laughing)
[01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.140]   Do you have advice on how to be happy?
[01:29:14.140 --> 01:29:17.160]   - Yes.
[01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:20.300]   - There's a lot of loneliness and sadness in the world.
[01:29:20.300 --> 01:29:24.800]   - Here, I can give a very easy piece of advice
[01:29:24.800 --> 01:29:26.160]   that worked a lot for me.
[01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:30.320]   Instead of telling yourself
[01:29:30.320 --> 01:29:35.000]   that you have these ridiculous standards,
[01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:38.240]   tell yourself, "I can be better."
[01:29:38.240 --> 01:29:40.480]   Right?
[01:29:40.480 --> 01:29:43.440]   I don't have to be a great writer.
[01:29:43.440 --> 01:29:45.160]   I can be a better writer.
[01:29:45.160 --> 01:29:46.740]   I don't have to be a great podcaster.
[01:29:46.740 --> 01:29:47.600]   That will never happen.
[01:29:47.600 --> 01:29:49.240]   I can be a better podcaster.
[01:29:49.240 --> 01:29:50.800]   I can be a better person.
[01:29:50.800 --> 01:29:53.380]   I can be better at the gym.
[01:29:53.380 --> 01:29:56.000]   I can be better with my time.
[01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:57.720]   And when you regard things in those,
[01:29:57.720 --> 01:30:00.480]   and especially if you have metrics that you can go by,
[01:30:00.480 --> 01:30:03.640]   you know, for example, I'll run this many miles a day,
[01:30:03.640 --> 01:30:05.360]   things you have control over,
[01:30:05.360 --> 01:30:07.120]   especially as males, when you have this chart
[01:30:07.120 --> 01:30:09.560]   and the data's telling you you're improving,
[01:30:09.560 --> 01:30:12.160]   right away, it's like you have this sense of accomplishment.
[01:30:12.160 --> 01:30:15.480]   So I think that is a really great way to find,
[01:30:15.480 --> 01:30:17.440]   and if something is not working in your life,
[01:30:17.440 --> 01:30:20.100]   let's suppose you don't have friends, right?
[01:30:20.100 --> 01:30:21.400]   There's the internet.
[01:30:21.400 --> 01:30:23.000]   How do people make friends?
[01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:23.840]   Try things out.
[01:30:23.840 --> 01:30:24.920]   What's the worst that's gonna happen?
[01:30:24.920 --> 01:30:26.320]   You're gonna, things are gonna blow up in your face?
[01:30:26.320 --> 01:30:28.920]   Well, you'll learn something at least.
[01:30:28.920 --> 01:30:31.240]   Don't be afraid of making mistakes.
[01:30:31.240 --> 01:30:34.880]   When I was a kid, I was so scared
[01:30:34.880 --> 01:30:37.560]   of having things under control,
[01:30:37.560 --> 01:30:39.280]   so like I would never have to get hit in the face,
[01:30:39.280 --> 01:30:41.380]   metaphorically, and then I realized,
[01:30:41.380 --> 01:30:43.580]   and you've realized this as well,
[01:30:43.580 --> 01:30:45.480]   everyone who's important gets hit in the face.
[01:30:45.480 --> 01:30:47.460]   Look at the president, whoever the president is.
[01:30:47.460 --> 01:30:48.920]   It becomes a matter of being strong enough
[01:30:48.920 --> 01:30:51.140]   that you could take getting hit in the face.
[01:30:51.140 --> 01:30:55.640]   So that is a big, important switch in your thinking.
[01:30:55.640 --> 01:30:58.220]   - Yeah, there's a Bukowski quote I wrote down.
[01:30:59.400 --> 01:31:01.320]   Sometimes you climb out of bed in the morning
[01:31:01.320 --> 01:31:03.600]   and you think, I'm not gonna make it,
[01:31:03.600 --> 01:31:05.200]   but you laugh inside remembering
[01:31:05.200 --> 01:31:06.840]   all the times you felt that way.
[01:31:06.840 --> 01:31:07.840]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:31:07.840 --> 01:31:09.920]   - There's a part of me that's like that.
[01:31:09.920 --> 01:31:11.360]   There's some days where I feel like
[01:31:11.360 --> 01:31:13.280]   this is the worst day of my life,
[01:31:13.280 --> 01:31:17.000]   and then shortly after, I think, chuckle at that.
[01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:18.360]   - Yes. - It's just knowing
[01:31:18.360 --> 01:31:20.560]   the ups and downs of the brain and the mind
[01:31:20.560 --> 01:31:22.120]   and life and all that.
[01:31:22.120 --> 01:31:23.360]   You ever been depressed?
[01:31:23.360 --> 01:31:24.200]   - Yeah, of course.
[01:31:24.200 --> 01:31:25.240]   I'm more anxious than depressed.
[01:31:25.240 --> 01:31:26.640]   I don't really get depressed.
[01:31:26.640 --> 01:31:28.800]   Yeah, but I've been depressed.
[01:31:28.800 --> 01:31:30.240]   - Like low points?
[01:31:30.240 --> 01:31:33.160]   - Yeah, but I think I distinguish depression
[01:31:33.160 --> 01:31:34.240]   between low points, right?
[01:31:34.240 --> 01:31:36.480]   Like if things are going bad and you feel bad,
[01:31:36.480 --> 01:31:38.600]   that makes sense, but when I think of depression,
[01:31:38.600 --> 01:31:41.680]   I think of someone who feels bad when things aren't bad.
[01:31:41.680 --> 01:31:45.920]   Like I said, to me, it's almost by definition irrational.
[01:31:45.920 --> 01:31:48.080]   - Well, yeah, and there's different kinds of,
[01:31:48.080 --> 01:31:51.200]   I like, there's a exhausted kind of depression
[01:31:51.200 --> 01:31:53.880]   where you're not, it's not so much sad
[01:31:53.880 --> 01:31:56.880]   as you're not, don't wanna do anything.
[01:31:56.880 --> 01:31:59.960]   You don't want to live, you don't want to.
[01:31:59.960 --> 01:32:01.520]   - What's the, yeah. - Yeah, what's the point?
[01:32:01.520 --> 01:32:04.000]   What's the point? - It's a wrap, yeah.
[01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.440]   - And like an extreme self-critical negativity,
[01:32:06.440 --> 01:32:08.080]   which I'm also scared of 'cause my brain
[01:32:08.080 --> 01:32:09.800]   is generally very self-critical.
[01:32:09.800 --> 01:32:11.760]   - 'Cause you're not taking enough magnesium.
[01:32:11.760 --> 01:32:13.920]   - Do you take erectile or in the mouth?
[01:32:13.920 --> 01:32:15.840]   - You take erectile. - Okay.
[01:32:15.840 --> 01:32:18.680]   - But as for the magnesium, you should take it as a pill.
[01:32:18.680 --> 01:32:20.880]   - Okay, well, the way your mom explained it then
[01:32:20.880 --> 01:32:22.320]   is way different.
[01:32:25.600 --> 01:32:27.040]   What are you most afraid of?
[01:32:27.040 --> 01:32:40.680]   - Holy crap, that's, I'm trying to think
[01:32:40.680 --> 01:32:42.560]   of anything I'm afraid of.
[01:32:42.560 --> 01:32:44.240]   - You know, in 1984?
[01:32:44.240 --> 01:32:46.920]   - With the, I thought, like even just--
[01:32:46.920 --> 01:32:49.640]   - Like if I wanted to torture you, hypothetically.
[01:32:49.640 --> 01:32:52.000]   - Well, you're, well, mission accomplished.
[01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:53.040]   (laughing)
[01:32:53.040 --> 01:32:55.080]   You know what, I mean, in terms of,
[01:32:55.080 --> 01:32:57.280]   I'm scared of increasing authoritarianism,
[01:32:57.280 --> 01:32:58.720]   but that's not personal.
[01:32:58.720 --> 01:33:01.400]   And that's not, that's something that I don't think
[01:33:01.400 --> 01:33:04.560]   is as much of an imminent concern as like,
[01:33:04.560 --> 01:33:06.320]   let's say, in Canada.
[01:33:06.320 --> 01:33:07.560]   - Are you scared of death?
[01:33:07.560 --> 01:33:08.400]   - No.
[01:33:08.400 --> 01:33:10.920]   - You think Camus was scared of death?
[01:33:10.920 --> 01:33:11.760]   - No.
[01:33:11.760 --> 01:33:14.760]   - He just accepted it as--
[01:33:14.760 --> 01:33:19.760]   - Look, I honestly feel like if I died tomorrow,
[01:33:19.760 --> 01:33:22.600]   I did pretty good with what I had.
[01:33:22.600 --> 01:33:25.400]   Like I think I did things that matter to me.
[01:33:25.400 --> 01:33:28.560]   I think I moved the needle on things that matter to me.
[01:33:28.560 --> 01:33:33.560]   I think I've been a good friend to the people I care about.
[01:33:33.560 --> 01:33:39.000]   I've saved a couple of lives.
[01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:44.000]   So I can, I think it's a very low bar
[01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:48.200]   for someone to be able to go to their grave and say,
[01:33:48.200 --> 01:33:50.280]   you know, I left the world a better place than I found it.
[01:33:50.280 --> 01:33:52.160]   I don't think it's that hard.
[01:33:52.160 --> 01:33:53.480]   - You ever been betrayed?
[01:33:53.480 --> 01:33:54.600]   - Oh God, yes, of course.
[01:33:54.600 --> 01:33:55.440]   Haven't you?
[01:33:55.440 --> 01:33:59.840]   - Not as often as I would have predicted.
[01:33:59.840 --> 01:34:01.280]   - Yeah, the Russian upbringing,
[01:34:01.280 --> 01:34:03.120]   it's like expects everyone to be like,
[01:34:03.120 --> 01:34:04.840]   just it's a time bomb before they betray you.
[01:34:04.840 --> 01:34:06.400]   I've been betrayed, of course, yeah.
[01:34:06.400 --> 01:34:07.240]   - Yeah.
[01:34:07.240 --> 01:34:10.440]   You value loyalty?
[01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:11.280]   - I do.
[01:34:11.280 --> 01:34:14.680]   And I also made it a point to not let that betrayal
[01:34:14.680 --> 01:34:18.440]   color my future interactions and regard that
[01:34:18.440 --> 01:34:20.160]   as the universal or the norm.
[01:34:20.160 --> 01:34:21.000]   - Yeah.
[01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:22.640]   - I think that's very important.
[01:34:22.640 --> 01:34:23.480]   - Me too.
[01:34:23.480 --> 01:34:25.920]   - And also I feel bad.
[01:34:25.920 --> 01:34:29.920]   I've gotten lex enough that I feel bad
[01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:32.080]   for the person who betrayed me
[01:34:32.080 --> 01:34:35.400]   because it's just like, they didn't need to do this.
[01:34:35.400 --> 01:34:39.800]   And at some point, if you betray someone, you know,
[01:34:39.800 --> 01:34:41.200]   and you know you're not a good person.
[01:34:41.200 --> 01:34:42.480]   I believe that.
[01:34:42.480 --> 01:34:43.960]   - Yeah.
[01:34:43.960 --> 01:34:45.600]   - Like even if you tell yourself this is something
[01:34:45.600 --> 01:34:49.240]   I had to do, you still know you had to do a bad thing
[01:34:49.240 --> 01:34:50.480]   to someone who didn't deserve it.
[01:34:50.480 --> 01:34:53.200]   And that's a really hard pill to swallow.
[01:34:53.200 --> 01:34:56.520]   - In my situation, I still think good thoughts
[01:34:56.520 --> 01:35:01.440]   and empathize with the people that have done me wrong.
[01:35:01.440 --> 01:35:04.160]   - I don't empathize with them, but I sympathize with them.
[01:35:04.160 --> 01:35:07.000]   - My English is not good enough to know the difference.
[01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.160]   - Empathizing means you're putting yourself in their shoes.
[01:35:09.160 --> 01:35:11.720]   Sympathizing means you feel bad for them
[01:35:11.720 --> 01:35:12.880]   and wish them well.
[01:35:12.880 --> 01:35:17.640]   - Yeah, I wish them well.
[01:35:17.640 --> 01:35:19.120]   - Yeah, but I don't put myself,
[01:35:19.120 --> 01:35:21.040]   it's very hard for me to empathize with someone
[01:35:21.040 --> 01:35:23.680]   who betrays someone that they care about.
[01:35:23.680 --> 01:35:26.080]   'Cause that is something, it's not that just I think
[01:35:26.080 --> 01:35:28.400]   I'm such a great person, it's that I feel guilt
[01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:29.520]   very strongly.
[01:35:29.520 --> 01:35:32.080]   So if I did that to someone who trusted me,
[01:35:32.080 --> 01:35:35.120]   I would really, it would fuck up my head for a long time.
[01:35:35.120 --> 01:35:38.400]   - Yeah, but maybe they were in pain.
[01:35:38.400 --> 01:35:41.120]   Maybe they were desperate.
[01:35:41.120 --> 01:35:43.400]   Maybe they were back to the wall.
[01:35:43.400 --> 01:35:44.240]   - Sure, sure.
[01:35:44.240 --> 01:35:45.080]   - They felt that way.
[01:35:45.080 --> 01:35:46.040]   - Sure, well, that's the sympathy thing,
[01:35:46.040 --> 01:35:47.320]   not really an empathy thing.
[01:35:47.320 --> 01:35:49.200]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:35:49.200 --> 01:35:51.840]   Loyalty is a fascinating thing.
[01:35:51.840 --> 01:35:55.000]   - Yes.
[01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:56.400]   - I value trust a lot.
[01:35:56.400 --> 01:35:57.240]   - I know you do.
[01:35:57.240 --> 01:35:59.320]   Especially 'cause you're in such a public,
[01:35:59.320 --> 01:36:01.840]   both of us, we're in very public positions.
[01:36:01.840 --> 01:36:03.960]   You have to be very careful who you surround yourself with.
[01:36:03.960 --> 01:36:05.120]   - It sucks.
[01:36:05.120 --> 01:36:06.480]   - Does it?
[01:36:06.480 --> 01:36:07.320]   Well, it--
[01:36:07.320 --> 01:36:08.920]   - It sucks because it's hard to,
[01:36:08.920 --> 01:36:15.880]   I usually just trust everybody.
[01:36:15.880 --> 01:36:17.280]   That's, okay, that's crazy.
[01:36:17.280 --> 01:36:20.680]   - But what's the alternative?
[01:36:20.680 --> 01:36:23.600]   - To be, have a filter?
[01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:26.120]   - Well, I have a filter in terms of who I interact with.
[01:36:26.120 --> 01:36:26.960]   - Okay.
[01:36:26.960 --> 01:36:29.840]   - But within the, you know, I see the good in people,
[01:36:29.840 --> 01:36:34.840]   but then you, in the very rare instances, that might turn.
[01:36:34.840 --> 01:36:36.200]   - Okay.
[01:36:36.200 --> 01:36:38.160]   - And yeah, it just sucks.
[01:36:38.160 --> 01:36:39.360]   It breaks my heart.
[01:36:39.360 --> 01:36:40.640]   - Yeah, I hear you.
[01:36:40.640 --> 01:36:41.680]   I completely agree.
[01:36:41.680 --> 01:36:44.640]   - Has your heart ever been broken?
[01:36:44.640 --> 01:36:45.480]   - Yes.
[01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:47.280]   - Love?
[01:36:47.280 --> 01:36:48.120]   - Yes.
[01:36:48.120 --> 01:36:53.520]   - I'm just so relaxed right now.
[01:36:53.520 --> 01:36:55.080]   - Good. - And happy.
[01:36:55.080 --> 01:36:56.040]   Relaxed and happy.
[01:36:56.040 --> 01:36:56.880]   - Good.
[01:36:56.880 --> 01:36:58.280]   - This is making me really happy.
[01:36:58.280 --> 01:37:00.560]   - It's so, again, it's beautiful
[01:37:00.560 --> 01:37:02.240]   on like eight different levels.
[01:37:02.240 --> 01:37:05.520]   - I think that's the deepest thing I'm thankful for,
[01:37:05.520 --> 01:37:08.120]   is just how beautiful people are,
[01:37:08.120 --> 01:37:09.880]   how beautiful the world is.
[01:37:09.880 --> 01:37:14.000]   - I really, and people are gonna laugh,
[01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.720]   and I welcome it, that's fine.
[01:37:16.720 --> 01:37:21.680]   I really sometimes feel like the guy in "American Beauty"
[01:37:21.680 --> 01:37:24.560]   looking at the plastic bag, dancing in the wind,
[01:37:24.560 --> 01:37:25.560]   and he's brought to tears
[01:37:25.560 --> 01:37:27.760]   'cause of how much beautiful life is.
[01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:30.840]   And a lot of people feel the need to sneer at that scene,
[01:37:30.840 --> 01:37:33.640]   and Ricky Pitts, whatever,
[01:37:33.640 --> 01:37:35.520]   and I think he's got it exactly right.
[01:37:35.520 --> 01:37:37.600]   - I think he does too.
[01:37:37.600 --> 01:37:43.320]   Well, in the end, you and I will be both laughing.
[01:37:43.320 --> 01:37:46.040]   - That's exactly, and right, and also seeing beauty
[01:37:46.040 --> 01:37:47.880]   where other people see garbage.
[01:37:47.880 --> 01:37:49.720]   And I'd rather be the person who sees beauty
[01:37:49.720 --> 01:37:51.360]   than the person who sees garbage.
[01:37:51.360 --> 01:37:54.040]   - Yep.
[01:37:54.040 --> 01:37:58.040]   Well, when I look at you, I see beauty,
[01:37:58.040 --> 01:38:01.200]   when most people see garbage.
[01:38:01.200 --> 01:38:04.280]   And it's really unfair, Mr. Parrot,
[01:38:04.280 --> 01:38:05.600]   that you keep saying that.
[01:38:05.600 --> 01:38:07.640]   - What?
[01:38:07.640 --> 01:38:08.880]   - All jokes aside, man,
[01:38:08.880 --> 01:38:10.720]   I'm really grateful for your friendship,
[01:38:10.720 --> 01:38:13.320]   and I'm really grateful for you as a person.
[01:38:13.320 --> 01:38:14.800]   Thank you so much for talking today.
[01:38:14.800 --> 01:38:16.120]   Thank you so much for talking to me
[01:38:16.120 --> 01:38:17.640]   throughout all these years.
[01:38:17.640 --> 01:38:19.240]   Thank you for being who you are.
[01:38:19.240 --> 01:38:20.760]   - You are welcome.
[01:38:20.760 --> 01:38:23.320]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[01:38:23.320 --> 01:38:24.520]   with Michael Malice.
[01:38:24.520 --> 01:38:25.720]   To support this podcast,
[01:38:25.720 --> 01:38:28.200]   please check out our sponsors in the description.
[01:38:28.200 --> 01:38:31.440]   And now let me leave you with some words from Andre Geid.
[01:38:31.440 --> 01:38:35.320]   Man cannot discover new oceans
[01:38:35.320 --> 01:38:38.760]   unless he has the courage to lose sight of the shore.
[01:38:40.680 --> 01:38:41.920]   Thank you for listening,
[01:38:41.920 --> 01:38:43.960]   and hope to see you next time.
[01:38:43.960 --> 01:38:46.560]   (upbeat music)
[01:38:46.560 --> 01:38:49.160]   (upbeat music)
