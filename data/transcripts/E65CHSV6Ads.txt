[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360]   Napoleon is not necessarily the child of revolution.
[00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.020]   Now, he's a product of the revolutionary circumstances,
[00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:08.960]   but he does not necessarily represent revolution as such.
[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.560]   To me, he's the last of the enlightened despots.
[00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:15.160]   Napoleon did not support the radicalism of revolution.
[00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.320]   And we see that throughout his life.
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.160]   The sheer nature of the war is that it makes things possible
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.360]   that in peacetime would be unthinkable.
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.600]   Without the war, the revolution would not have radicalized
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.800]   as rapidly or to the extent that it did.
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.000]   - I wonder what you think of this.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   If Napoleon was alive today, he'd be a startup founder.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.120]   You know, as you mentioned.
[00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.040]   What do you think about this?
[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.600]   Would Napoleon, I don't know,
[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.500]   become the CEO of a company like Tesla today?
[00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.080]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:50.160]   All right, today I have the pleasure
[00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.000]   of interviewing Professor Alexander Mika Britsa,
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.800]   who is a professor of history
[00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.520]   and the Ruth Haring Noel Endowed Chair
[00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.320]   at Louisiana State University.
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.120]   And he's the author of "The Napoleonic Wars,
[00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.340]   A Global History."
[00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.560]   This is absolutely fascinating book.
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.160]   It was unlike any other history book I've read
[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.280]   in the sense that it was just global in a scope
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.320]   and you're covering such an interesting period in history.
[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.200]   So first of all, can you give my audience
[00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.360]   a little bit of background on yourself
[00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.120]   and on the Napoleonic Wars?
[00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.000]   - Yes, thank you so much for having me.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.480]   It's a delight to be here.
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:30.120]   I'm originally from a country of Georgia
[00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.400]   and they usually tell people that,
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.400]   no, it's not the state of Georgia, right?
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.760]   It's the country of Georgia in Eastern Europe.
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.360]   A small state sandwiched between Russia and Turkey
[00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.360]   with a rather complex and diverse and turbulent history.
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.960]   But as most small nations,
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.960]   it is oftentimes kind of lost on the pages of history.
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.200]   And of course, when I embarked on this career
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.880]   to become a professional historian,
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.360]   I've always wanted to see where my people
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.560]   kind of fit in the largest scheme of things.
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.400]   And I was oftentimes frustrated,
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.480]   especially working on the revolutionary Napoleonic era
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.520]   that the huge transformations
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.600]   that this period witnessed in Caucasus
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.320]   were not properly addressed.
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.720]   And so the immediate cause and kind of spark
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.680]   to write this book was desire to kind of wrong,
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.360]   to correct the wrong.
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.200]   But it also kind of then grew from there
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.320]   to get a better understanding of the field
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.960]   because Napoleonic era is one of the most written
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.280]   historical periods.
[00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.440]   There are thousands and thousands of volumes.
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.480]   In fact, Napoleon is probably the most written
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.160]   about historical figure period.
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.520]   The last estimate was that at least three,
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.540]   maybe 400,000 volumes have been written just about him.
[00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.500]   So there has to be a really good reason
[00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.540]   to write another book about this topic.
[00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.920]   And gradually my realization was that
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.440]   almost everything that has been written about this period
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.760]   is written from the French and British points of view
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.120]   and focused on the great transformations
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.720]   taking place inside Europe.
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.400]   And that is perfectly worthwhile enterprise,
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.120]   but I thought that it offers a very narrow snapshot
[00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.440]   of the period because Napoleonic,
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.760]   revolutionary Napoleonic period
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.680]   is the moment when we see the modernity setting
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:42.960]   in not just in Europe,
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.760]   but gradually extending to various parts of the world.
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.600]   It changes the trajectory
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.560]   that many of these world regions followed.
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.560]   And I thought in fresher study was needed to flesh that out.
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.700]   - And what I appreciated as like American of Indian origin
[00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.280]   is that you had almost a chapter in the book
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.360]   that was just dedicated to how the Napoleonic Wars
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.200]   impacted the expansion of British rule in India.
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.720]   And also about obviously the impact on the Americas
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.000]   from the Louisiana Purchase onwards.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.840]   I'm curious, by the way,
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.960]   how it's possible that so many volumes
[00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:21.960]   about Napoleon have been written.
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.680]   I think Andrew Roberts said that there's been one,
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.080]   on average, one new book about Napoleon a day since he died.
[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.920]   - Yeah.
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:29.760]   (laughs)
[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:30.580]   Oh yeah.
[00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.900]   - How are there possibly that many Napoleonic scholars?
[00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:39.920]   - Well, it's a very enticing field.
[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.200]   I compare Napoleon and you told me
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.760]   that the video will be recorded, right?
[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.760]   So you see the wall behind me,
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.020]   which has parts of the British propaganda,
[00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.720]   part of the French propaganda,
[00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.200]   and of course the gift from my students,
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.680]   Napoleon's cutout.
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.760]   But oftentimes compare Napoleon to a siren.
[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:04.560]   And because for those who first approach
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.960]   the shores of Napoleonic history,
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.720]   they are drawn by the lure of that sweet song
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.200]   of Napoleonic legend, right?
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.600]   That the vision of a romantic kind of Titan,
[00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:18.740]   the Prometheus who's thought to bring about change
[00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:22.200]   and was ultimately defeated and exiled to Iraq
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.200]   in the middle of nowhere.
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.640]   And I think Napoleonic legend exercises such a lure
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:32.340]   that there isn't always enough people interested in it
[00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:33.920]   to write about it.
[00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:37.080]   But it has a downfall or kind of side effect.
[00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:42.080]   And that is most of what is written is written on Europe
[00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:47.840]   for linguistic reasons.
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.520]   For example, to write the books of global nature,
[00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.000]   global historical narrative,
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.680]   you need to have diversity of language skills
[00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.680]   that includes not just the French and British,
[00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.000]   which by now is taken for granted,
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.040]   but Spanish and German and Russian.
[00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:07.360]   And if you expand your narrative even further to the East,
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.000]   then you have to involve the Ottoman
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.120]   and Iranian historical traditions as well, right?
[00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.060]   And of course, that is a colossal challenge.
[00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:19.380]   And I think that is oftentimes pushes people away
[00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:21.120]   from such a narrative.
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:26.800]   Then also that the events in Europe itself in the period
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.180]   are such colossal scale, right?
[00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:31.800]   So we talk about the battles that evolve.
[00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.040]   For example, at Borodino,
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:37.640]   there are a quarter million troops at Leipzig.
[00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:40.040]   There are well over half a million troops fighting
[00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.440]   for the future of Europe.
[00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:46.400]   That by comparison, let's say dealing with events
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.280]   in Russo-Iranian war,
[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:52.960]   where you have on average 10 to 15,000 men engaged,
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.240]   it kind of not sexy now, right?
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:56.080]   Not big enough.
[00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.880]   (laughs)
[00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:01.020]   So I think that also plays a role.
[00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:05.140]   And the charisma of these great personalities
[00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:08.520]   that were engaged also kind of skews it
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.640]   towards Eurocentric narrative.
[00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:12.080]   And that's exactly the point
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:13.760]   that I was trying to make in the book
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:16.280]   is that that should not be the reason
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:20.520]   to avoid our discussion in elsewhere.
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.640]   And as you pointed out,
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:28.240]   for India, this is the moment of tremendous importance
[00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:32.480]   and not to include the developments in India
[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:35.600]   under the leadership of British East India Company
[00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:39.960]   led by Richard Wellesley from 1798 to 1805, right?
[00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:42.680]   These seven years of crucial importance
[00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:44.660]   because in many respect,
[00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:48.380]   the foundation for what will be the Raj, right?
[00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:50.660]   Is late exactly at this time.
[00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:53.080]   And same applies to, let's say,
[00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:56.120]   extending our narrative to North America, South America,
[00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:59.360]   where these periods saw the collapse
[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:01.040]   of the Spanish imperial rule
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:04.180]   and the emergence of a new political reality
[00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:06.640]   that will continue to reverberate
[00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:10.400]   and kind of affect us to the present day, right?
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:12.860]   The fact that we have such a political,
[00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:18.160]   kind of political reality of independent nation states
[00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:20.480]   from Mexico down to Argentina,
[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:25.480]   all are the part of the legacy of the Napoleonic period.
[00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:28.760]   - Can you talk more about the impact
[00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:31.940]   of the Napoleonic Wars on India?
[00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:34.360]   Why was this so crucial
[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:36.120]   for the British East India Company?
[00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:41.120]   - Now, of course, the English presence in India
[00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:43.280]   predates revolutionary period
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:46.080]   and by the start of revolutionary wars.
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:47.200]   And I remind the listeners,
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:50.680]   the French Revolutionary War started in April of 1792
[00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:53.920]   and Britain joined the war in 1793.
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:57.840]   So by then, British East India Company
[00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:01.640]   had already established presence in India,
[00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:04.860]   especially in the Northeastern part of it in Bengal.
[00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:08.080]   And of course, India,
[00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:11.840]   oftentimes people forget just how huge and how diverse
[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:16.160]   and how populous this subcontinent is.
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:19.480]   And notice that I use the term subcontinent, not region,
[00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:23.800]   because again, it's enormous in scale.
[00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:28.200]   In fact, the estimates usually point
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.200]   that India at this time has a population
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:34.200]   of well over 120 million people.
[00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:38.600]   So, and this would have been a huge area for,
[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:42.060]   or huge area for the British as market for their goods,
[00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:45.720]   but also as a source of the goods for their own commerce.
[00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:49.720]   And we know that in, before revolutionary wars,
[00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:52.600]   there was a vibrant trade going on
[00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:55.640]   that in many respects,
[00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:58.240]   sustained the industrial,
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:01.360]   the nascent industrial revolution in Britain.
[00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:03.040]   So from the British point of view,
[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:04.880]   India is a crucial asset,
[00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:07.600]   or at least the presence in India is a crucial asset.
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:09.800]   But it is an asset that from the British point of view
[00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:14.800]   is constantly under threat from other powers,
[00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:18.840]   both local, such as, for example, Mughal Empire,
[00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:22.200]   until it experienced the decline in the mid 18th century,
[00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:24.820]   and then the Maratha confederation,
[00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:27.920]   and external threats,
[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:30.480]   most notably the French,
[00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:33.520]   who've been kind of nibbling at their heels
[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:35.720]   all through the 18th century.
[00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:40.720]   And so, to me, the interesting aspect of this
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:44.520]   is not necessarily the actual threat
[00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:46.760]   that existed,
[00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:50.800]   but it's the perceptions of threat that Britain saw,
[00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:52.240]   the British officials saw.
[00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:53.080]   Not all of them.
[00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:57.480]   For example, when we look at 1798, 1799 period,
[00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:00.760]   you have some British officials,
[00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:03.000]   such as Granville, who was a foreign secretary,
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.640]   arguing that the threat,
[00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:08.240]   direct threat to British presence in India
[00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:12.120]   is exaggerated and kind of embellished,
[00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:15.320]   and that Britain should focus its efforts
[00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:17.560]   on confronting France in Europe.
[00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:19.960]   And then you have colonial officials,
[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:24.960]   of course, the British East India Company officials,
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:28.560]   steadfastly arguing that the threat is real,
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:30.000]   that French are coming.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.120]   And in fact, if you read the letters of Richard Wellesley,
[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:36.400]   who was appointed as the Governor General
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:39.160]   of British East India Company in 1798,
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:43.760]   he speaks constantly of this French threat
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:47.560]   as if it is real, as if it is imminent,
[00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:51.120]   even though we know that France was not
[00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:55.800]   in a position to directly threaten the positions,
[00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:58.000]   the British positions in India at this time.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.520]   The French hands are tied in Europe.
[00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:03.320]   But nonetheless, the perception is important
[00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:06.600]   because it is under this pretense
[00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:08.840]   of confronting the French threat
[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:12.800]   that Wellesley then embarks on empire building.
[00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:14.560]   And in the book, I refer to Wellesley
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:16.160]   as probably the most Napoleonic
[00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:17.880]   of this British statesmen of this period,
[00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:22.880]   because his vision is that of an empire in India,
[00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:27.280]   which can be built within the context
[00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:30.720]   of confronting this alleged French threat.
[00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:35.040]   And so we see the wars, the campaigns
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:40.040]   that Wellesley waged against the local Indian states
[00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:42.840]   that refused to trod the British lines.
[00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:46.360]   So I remind you of the war between Anglo,
[00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:48.600]   the British and the Mysore, right?
[00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:52.080]   The infamous storming of Seringapatam
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:55.640]   and the killing of the ruler of Tipu Sultan,
[00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:59.720]   or the subjugation of Nizam of Hyderabad,
[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:03.440]   who is forced to accept this subsidiary relationship
[00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:06.040]   with the British, or the confrontation ultimately
[00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:07.360]   between the British forces
[00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:09.920]   and the Maratha Confederation,
[00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:12.040]   during which in 1803, for example,
[00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:14.240]   you have that famous Battle of Assay,
[00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:18.160]   where Arthur Wellesley, the Richards' younger brother
[00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:23.160]   and future greatest British military commander of the age,
[00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:26.720]   Duke Wellington, distinguished himself.
[00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:31.720]   And so these policies of using the French scare
[00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:37.560]   to impose the British kind of interest
[00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:41.480]   on the local states are extremely successful
[00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:45.360]   in that by 1805, much of Southern
[00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:50.360]   and Eastern Indian subcontinent is under British rule.
[00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:54.160]   Now, different shades of it, direct or indirect rule,
[00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:56.680]   but nonetheless, it's under the British influence.
[00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:58.520]   And that process will only continue
[00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:01.520]   in the subsequent years, so that by 1819,
[00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:05.680]   you see the extension of the British authority
[00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:07.680]   in the North to areas like Ud,
[00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:11.600]   in Northern parts of the subcontinent,
[00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:15.720]   and of course, the encroachment on the Maratha territory,
[00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:20.720]   which will be ultimately consumed by 1918 and early '20s.
[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:23.440]   And hence, we see the establishment
[00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:26.560]   of the British rule in India.
[00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:31.560]   - Is having a global empire, a bunch of colonies,
[00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:33.280]   is that helpful when you're engaged
[00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:34.560]   in a war with another power?
[00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:36.440]   I mean, in some sense, maybe you're like,
[00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:37.520]   I don't know, more diversified,
[00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:39.880]   but in another, as you just said,
[00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:42.000]   the British had to devote resources and attention
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.520]   to defending their stakeholder in India.
[00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:48.360]   And even in World War II, Churchill has to worry
[00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:51.640]   about that Singapore is taken over by the Japanese.
[00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:53.720]   So when you're fighting a war,
[00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:55.160]   is it good to have a lot of colonies,
[00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:56.560]   or is it bad for you?
[00:14:56.560 --> 00:15:00.120]   - No, of course, having colonies means
[00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:01.920]   having access to resources,
[00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:04.280]   resources both in terms of manpower,
[00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:07.240]   but also resources in terms of commodities,
[00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:11.480]   natural resources that sustain your economy,
[00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:12.840]   your war effort.
[00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:16.040]   I mean, to kind of deviate from maybe Napoleonic era,
[00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:20.320]   when we talk about that other great war,
[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:22.520]   because Napoleonic wars for much of the 19th century
[00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:25.200]   was the great war only to be superseded by World War I.
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:28.040]   But think about the British imperial involvement
[00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:29.200]   in World War I.
[00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:31.880]   When we talk about Britain at war,
[00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:34.480]   we really mean the empire.
[00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:36.520]   And it needs to be pointed out
[00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:40.160]   that more Indian troops served in that war
[00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:41.760]   than the actual British troops.
[00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:45.640]   And certainly, the expeditions to, for example, Iraq,
[00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:48.920]   involved thousands of Indian forces.
[00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:53.920]   So having an empire certainly helps in conducting the war.
[00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:59.440]   And that is true in Napoleonic period,
[00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:02.680]   because the trade that Britain conducted
[00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:07.680]   both with India and with China was extremely lucrative.
[00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:12.480]   And there are excellent studies done
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:14.040]   on the extent of this trade
[00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:19.080]   and on the volume and value of the commerce
[00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:24.480]   that was conducted with Asia,
[00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:28.400]   which is one of the crucial parts
[00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:33.400]   of the British economic endurance, kind of resilience.
[00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:38.800]   Because once Napoleon consolidates
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:40.280]   his control of the continent,
[00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:44.280]   we know that in 1806 he embarks on the system
[00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:47.440]   that we refer to as continental blockade,
[00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:50.320]   which was designed to isolate the British
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:54.520]   or cut them off from the continent
[00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:57.600]   in terms of their ability to sell goods.
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:01.160]   One of the reasons why Britain
[00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:05.240]   was able to survive this economic war
[00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:08.280]   was precisely because it could rely
[00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:12.800]   on its colonial presence, rely on markets elsewhere.
[00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:15.880]   And of course, have the ability,
[00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:20.880]   the naval capacity to ensure that its commercial roots,
[00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:26.440]   its lifelines continue to sustain its war effort.
[00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:31.320]   And the reverse is true for France.
[00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:35.080]   And that is one of the crucial stories
[00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:37.080]   of the revolutionary Napoleon era
[00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:41.120]   is the collapse of what we call First French Empire.
[00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:44.320]   France loses virtually every possession
[00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:47.800]   it has outside Europe, that is in India,
[00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:50.920]   that is broadly in Indian Ocean,
[00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:53.240]   certainly the Caribbean, and of course,
[00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:58.240]   you refer to the loss of Louisiana in 1803, 1804, right?
[00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:03.600]   So that means that by comparison,
[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:06.200]   France finds itself in a much weaker position
[00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:08.160]   in the years to come.
[00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:11.840]   And that later on will kind of sustain this narrative
[00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:15.960]   of restoration of the national grandeur,
[00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:18.200]   which will justify, for example,
[00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:21.080]   colonial enterprise or colonial projects
[00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:25.440]   that France will unleash in Algiers in 1830,
[00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:28.680]   and then Sub-Saharan Africa in later periods, right?
[00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:29.520]   As a part of that,
[00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:33.560]   the reconstruction of the imperial construct.
[00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:35.240]   - Did the continental system contribute
[00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:38.720]   to Britain having the Industrial Revolution first?
[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:43.160]   There's a book by this developmental economist,
[00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:44.680]   Joseph Studwell, called "How Asia Works,"
[00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:49.320]   and he makes the case that these Asian tigers
[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:50.600]   in the late 20th century,
[00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:53.640]   they imposed a bunch of tariffs
[00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:56.160]   whose main purpose was to enforce export discipline
[00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:59.640]   so that it would help their nascent industries,
[00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:02.560]   I guess, car making in Korea, for example.
[00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:03.720]   It would give them a leg up
[00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:05.800]   so that they could build know-how within the country
[00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:07.040]   to manufacture these things,
[00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:09.120]   and then they could get rid of the tariffs.
[00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:10.720]   Did this kind of just artificially happen
[00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:11.920]   with the continental system?
[00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:13.680]   I mean, to what extent are the Napoleonic Wars
[00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:16.800]   and the Industrial Revolution linked?
[00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:20.200]   - So in the book, I devote an entire chapter
[00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:23.160]   to what I call war through other means,
[00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:25.720]   and that is the economic side of the war.
[00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:29.640]   In fact, I wish I had more space to devote to.
[00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:33.560]   In fact, that's one of the topics I'm working on today,
[00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:37.000]   or nowadays, and that is to explore
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.240]   the economic dimensions of the war,
[00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:40.440]   which usually is ignored,
[00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:43.880]   even though it's absolutely instrumental to it.
[00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:47.560]   And there are a couple of things
[00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:49.040]   to kind of address right away,
[00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:53.560]   and one is that industrialization began in Britain
[00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:54.640]   before the war.
[00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:59.440]   We know that the elements of the industrial development
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:03.600]   already present in Britain in 1760s, '70s, '70s,
[00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:06.000]   certainly by 1780s,
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.880]   Britain is far more industrialized
[00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:10.920]   than the continental powers.
[00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:14.640]   The second point is that France
[00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:18.120]   had prerequisites for industrialization,
[00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:20.000]   and there is a fascinating new study
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.200]   on why the Industrial Revolution
[00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:27.200]   didn't take place in France in 1760s, '70s, and '80s,
[00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:28.360]   like it did in Britain,
[00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:31.360]   but that's a separate kind of topic.
[00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:36.360]   However, once the Industrial Revolution took off in Britain,
[00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:40.200]   it gave the British an enormous advantage
[00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:43.320]   in terms of their economic parity,
[00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:48.240]   in terms of their economic or financial relations
[00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:49.440]   with the continent,
[00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:53.320]   and it left, therefore, the continental powers
[00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:56.280]   in this position where the only way
[00:20:56.280 --> 00:21:00.320]   they really can respond to the British threat,
[00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:01.480]   or economic threat,
[00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:06.480]   is by, as you pointed out, creating barriers, tariffs.
[00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:11.480]   Napoleon understood that opening up market,
[00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:13.640]   that letting the British goods flow
[00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:16.320]   will be absolutely catastrophic to French interests,
[00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:18.160]   not to mention to the industrial,
[00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:22.400]   the nascent industries in the territories
[00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:23.560]   that he controlled,
[00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:28.320]   which is why he comes up with this continental system.
[00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:31.400]   And I want to, and it's what kind of my pet peeve,
[00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:35.160]   in that I am very adamant about distinguishing
[00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:36.840]   between continental blockade,
[00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:41.840]   which was a policy designed to deal with the British commerce
[00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:44.000]   and a continental system,
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.600]   which was a far more encompassing policy
[00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:51.360]   that Napoleon pursued towards creating
[00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:57.320]   a new reality, political economic reality in Europe.
[00:21:57.320 --> 00:21:59.840]   Later on, on St. Helena Island, when he's exiled,
[00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:02.080]   he does talk about his desire
[00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:04.960]   to create a United States of Europe,
[00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:08.320]   effectively an early version of the European Union.
[00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:10.920]   But we have to bear in mind
[00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:14.280]   that Napoleon's vision of European Union
[00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:18.120]   was an imperial construct where France was supreme.
[00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:22.040]   But within that European Union, so to speak,
[00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:24.400]   Napoleon did want to use the terrorist,
[00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:26.480]   the protective barriers,
[00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:29.200]   as a way of promoting industrial growth.
[00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:32.280]   And that's where Napoleonic Wars is interesting
[00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:34.640]   because on one hand,
[00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:38.880]   the fighting, the military devastation that takes place
[00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:41.680]   in places like Spain, like Germany, like Russia,
[00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:44.320]   does affect the local manufacturing,
[00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:46.840]   does affect local industries.
[00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:48.520]   But on the other hand, Napoleon,
[00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:51.240]   by creating this kind of vacuum or the bubble,
[00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:56.240]   not vacuum, but bubble around certain areas of Europe,
[00:22:56.240 --> 00:23:00.320]   tried to promote industries within the safety
[00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:03.520]   so that the British couldn't compete with them directly.
[00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:07.640]   And we see the kind of haphazard impact of his policies.
[00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:10.080]   There are some areas where it worked
[00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:12.840]   and in the post-war period,
[00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:15.320]   places like Belgium, Netherlands, Southern Germany,
[00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:17.480]   Northern France, Northern Italy,
[00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:20.440]   the industrial development took off.
[00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:22.400]   But also, but on the other hand,
[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:26.920]   there are areas where the war had a far greater impact
[00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:29.680]   and the continental system with its restrictions
[00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:31.840]   actually delayed the industrial development
[00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:33.040]   rather than promote it.
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:34.760]   - I was just looking at this paper
[00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:36.760]   from the economist, Aaron Asimoglu.
[00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:39.280]   I think it's called "The Consequences of Radical Reform."
[00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:41.200]   And in it, he was making the case that
[00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:45.400]   if you look at the places that Napoleon conquered
[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:47.680]   and reformed within the Napoleonic codes,
[00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:51.480]   his claim is that after 1850, all of them,
[00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:53.360]   they all experienced more economic growth
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:54.960]   in the places that he didn't conquer.
[00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:56.800]   And I think he says in the paper
[00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:58.760]   that there were no cases where there was,
[00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:03.520]   that he couldn't identify any negative effects from this.
[00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:08.520]   I wonder if you agree or was this just an annoyed good?
[00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:14.880]   - I think it's too generalized kind of statement.
[00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:19.120]   And if you dig deeper,
[00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:22.520]   I think you'll see a more complex reality.
[00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:27.120]   One thing is that many of the areas
[00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:29.320]   that the author was referring to
[00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:31.720]   as having the economic growth and all,
[00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:37.600]   they had the preconditions for economic prosperity,
[00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:41.120]   for industrialization before Napoleon showed up.
[00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:46.120]   So usually the case studies for that are low countries,
[00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:51.600]   Belgium, Dutch Republic, the Rhineland,
[00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:55.520]   the Northern Italy areas around Turin and Milan.
[00:24:55.520 --> 00:25:00.520]   But those were already urbanized, developed regions
[00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:05.880]   that were on the way to industrialization.
[00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:07.960]   In fact, in those areas, you can argue,
[00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:11.520]   and many of my colleagues have done,
[00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:13.480]   the Napoleonic Wars actually hampered
[00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:18.480]   the industrial growth because of the direct effect
[00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:20.600]   of the war, the fighting and the destruction,
[00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:24.880]   but also because of the taxes, requisitioning,
[00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:28.520]   occupational costs that the war brought on these regions.
[00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:32.120]   However, if you look beyond this kind of,
[00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:33.800]   and that's where in the book,
[00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:37.120]   what I'm arguing is that the impact of Napoleon
[00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:41.040]   needs to be qualified.
[00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:44.800]   You have to approach it very carefully
[00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:48.120]   because it depends on particular region
[00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:49.920]   and on the duration of the French presence.
[00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:52.440]   So the areas that I just mentioned
[00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:54.880]   stayed under French control for much longer.
[00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:57.280]   For example, in Belgium case,
[00:25:57.280 --> 00:26:01.080]   we talk about from 1794 until 1814, right?
[00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:03.280]   There's a much longer duration in time.
[00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:07.520]   Compare that, for example, to Calabria in Southern Italy,
[00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:11.040]   where the French arrived in 1806,
[00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:14.920]   they face vociferous resistance from the local population,
[00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:19.920]   and they really can't overcome it until 1810.
[00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:22.240]   And then in 1814, they are gone.
[00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:24.440]   So how much can you accomplish in four years?
[00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:26.960]   Or think about Poland, let's say.
[00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:28.160]   Or in Spain, right?
[00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:32.040]   So there is far shorter duration of the Napoleonic impact,
[00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:33.720]   and there is only so much you can accomplish
[00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:35.280]   in that few years.
[00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:38.960]   And so that's where I would argue is that,
[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:42.840]   yes, the introduction of Napoleonic reforms
[00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:49.360]   in many cases were helpful in changing the system.
[00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:54.120]   Now, what I mean by Napoleonic reforms,
[00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:56.680]   this is usually centralization of authority.
[00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:59.120]   This is professionalization of administration.
[00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:04.120]   This is enforcement of new administrative institutions.
[00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:08.920]   And of course, as you mentioned, the new legal framework.
[00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:12.880]   Napoleonic code was this transformation,
[00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:17.880]   this revolutionary change through a legal code.
[00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:20.960]   But how long did they stay?
[00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:22.600]   That's the question, right?
[00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:24.720]   What's the actual impact on the ground?
[00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:27.600]   And that's where you see, once you scratch the surface,
[00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:30.360]   that the impact is not as uniform,
[00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:35.120]   and much dependent on the willingness
[00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:38.640]   of the local population to accept this change.
[00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:41.680]   - And then, in a previous life, you were a lawyer.
[00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:44.040]   I'm wondering how that experience,
[00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:46.800]   or how that background has shaped your understanding
[00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:50.360]   of the impact of these reforms and these codes.
[00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:53.080]   And I have a more, especially to the question of,
[00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:56.600]   there's a perennial debate about whether institutions
[00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:58.760]   and laws that have been shaped kind of naturally
[00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:00.520]   through tradition and through history are better,
[00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:03.840]   or ones that are more technocratic,
[00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:06.440]   based on more rational principles,
[00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:08.000]   whether that's preferable.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.600]   I wonder what kinds of lessons you draw
[00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:12.240]   on questions like that.
[00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:15.920]   - So, it's a complex question,
[00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:17.680]   but it's an interesting question to ponder.
[00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:20.320]   And in my own courses, when I teach students,
[00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:25.320]   I usually ask to look at what Napoleon tried to implement.
[00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:28.440]   On the legal side of it, with Napoleonic code,
[00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:30.400]   go through the provisions of Napoleonic code.
[00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:34.840]   And there is a lot that can be qualified
[00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:37.840]   as progressive for this period.
[00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:41.280]   If we set aside important issues
[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:46.280]   on which Napoleon was not as progressive,
[00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:49.760]   for example, in the issue of the equality of the women,
[00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:53.000]   or the issue of the property rights
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   of certain children born out of wedlock and all that.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.840]   But if we look at some of the core elements
[00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:06.840]   of the Napoleonic reforms, they are quite progressive.
[00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:12.840]   However, is progress always a good thing?
[00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:16.240]   That's, I usually kind of pose the question to students.
[00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:18.840]   And usually the answer is, oh yeah, of course,
[00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:20.360]   progress is a good thing.
[00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:23.360]   But what if the progress comes in an intrusive manner,
[00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:27.320]   and it changes the way of life that you are used to,
[00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:28.680]   you're comfortable with?
[00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:31.920]   Then the question becomes whether the progress
[00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:34.760]   is actually a good thing.
[00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:38.600]   And what I mean by this is that in places like Spain
[00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:42.560]   or Italy or in Poland, Napoleonic reforms,
[00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:45.560]   as progressives might argue, right, they were,
[00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:51.240]   they threatened to bring about more centralized,
[00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:55.000]   therefore more intrusive power of the state.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.440]   It threatened to bring about more effective tax collection,
[00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:00.640]   more effective administration.
[00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:06.440]   It effectively threatened to create a system
[00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:08.640]   that held citizens more accountable.
[00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:13.160]   Now, today, we all like to complain about taxes
[00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:15.360]   and about the government overreach, right?
[00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:18.000]   So why are we kind of surprised that people
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:21.520]   in early 1800s would have been complaining about this?
[00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:25.760]   In some way, some of it might strike as quite unusual,
[00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:30.440]   but in a weird way is that, for example,
[00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:32.000]   one of the great legacies of Napoleon
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:35.080]   is the vaccination program.
[00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:36.640]   I think that is especially relevant
[00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:38.320]   in the last two years, right?
[00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:40.760]   The government's efforts to vaccinate,
[00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:43.360]   to boost and all this, and even today,
[00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:45.360]   we know that people were resisting it, right?
[00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:49.480]   Now, Napoleon promoted a great vaccination program
[00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:53.040]   for smallpox, and he started with his own child.
[00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:58.040]   He vaccinated his troops, and then kind of rolled
[00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:02.240]   this program to the territories that he occupied.
[00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:05.600]   But in many areas, people resisted vaccination
[00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:07.680]   because it represented government overreach,
[00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:10.120]   because it represented government kind of telling people,
[00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:11.840]   you gotta vaccinate.
[00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:16.520]   And there were parts of Europe where people suspected
[00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:19.600]   that vaccination was part of the government's
[00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:21.560]   kind of secret plan to control them,
[00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:26.560]   which will strike us as a very modern thing, right?
[00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:27.800]   (laughs)
[00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:32.800]   Conspiracy theories today are not that original.
[00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:35.000]   - Today, there's like a big discrepancy
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.640]   between how Americans and Europeans
[00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:37.880]   see the role of the state.
[00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:40.080]   You know, Europeans are much more comfortable with it.
[00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:42.440]   Is the origin of that, that they did have a figure
[00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:45.840]   like Napoleon centuries ago who instilled
[00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:49.320]   a more centralized and, I guess,
[00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:52.240]   more administrative form of government?
[00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:53.480]   - Partly.
[00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:56.200]   Of course, we have to bear in mind
[00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:58.080]   that unlike the United States, let's say,
[00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:01.200]   or to a great degree, Britain,
[00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:05.360]   continental European history centers around
[00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:08.280]   strong authoritarian monarchical rule.
[00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:12.120]   Here we see kind of dichotomy, for example,
[00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:16.240]   of the French absolutism with the British parliamentarian,
[00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:20.720]   you know, limited monarchical development.
[00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:22.400]   Or further east we go, right?
[00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:25.680]   In Prussia, for example, we see the development
[00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:28.640]   of, again, absolutist tendencies in the Cameralist system,
[00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:31.880]   or further to the east in Russia, of course,
[00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:35.800]   the autocratic monarchical government
[00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:38.760]   that predates, of course, Napoleon.
[00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:43.120]   So there is a long history of a strong
[00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:45.200]   statist approach to it.
[00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:46.880]   Now, what Napoleon tried to do
[00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:50.080]   is he tried to make the state efficient.
[00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:53.840]   And in that he was, I mean,
[00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:56.360]   that's actually one of the most fascinating things
[00:32:56.360 --> 00:33:00.360]   about him is kind of increasing the centralization,
[00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:04.880]   the efficiency, the enforcement of the state.
[00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:06.320]   In France, we, for example,
[00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:10.280]   see that after the turbulent years of revolution,
[00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:14.560]   Napoleonic centralization and the enforcement
[00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:16.560]   completely changed the relationship
[00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:18.640]   between the people and the state.
[00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:21.160]   And that includes, for example,
[00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:24.560]   in areas like tax payments, right?
[00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:27.560]   Tax collection, which increased exponentially
[00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:30.280]   as Napoleon actually set up the system
[00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:32.920]   that held people accountable for it.
[00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:38.800]   And that made, I think, the continental power,
[00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:42.120]   so the continental societies,
[00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:44.520]   far more willing to accept the role of the state.
[00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:48.560]   Now, there is another kind of fold to this in this.
[00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:51.720]   And that goes that after Napoleonic period, right?
[00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:55.080]   Once the war is over and now we are at the period of peace
[00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:59.080]   and will last several decades until 1850s
[00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:00.000]   with the Crimean War,
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:03.640]   and then with the bigger conflicts of '60s and '70s.
[00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:07.280]   But nonetheless, we have about four decades of peace.
[00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:10.840]   Well, we have to deal with this kind of gorilla,
[00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:12.480]   800 pound gorilla in the room,
[00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:15.080]   and that is the British industrial might.
[00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:17.640]   And one of the ways we can deal with that
[00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:22.640]   is by maintaining the protective barriers of terrorists
[00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:26.600]   and by increasing the role of the state
[00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:28.040]   in the economic development.
[00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:31.240]   And here, your listeners can read up on,
[00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:33.320]   for example, the economic theories
[00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:36.880]   that Friedrich List was the great proponent of,
[00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:39.600]   which indeed championed the role of the state
[00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:41.560]   in promoting economic prosperity
[00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:43.280]   and promoting industrialization.
[00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:46.440]   And many European states followed exactly that model.
[00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:49.840]   Another theory about how the economics here proceeded
[00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:51.880]   is maybe the public choice theory model
[00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:53.000]   from like Manfred Olsen,
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.880]   where he observed that, for example,
[00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:56.920]   after World War II,
[00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:59.600]   economic growth rates in Germany and Japan
[00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:01.440]   were increased by a lot.
[00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:02.760]   And his theory is just that you got rid
[00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:06.440]   of these old institutions and old institutions
[00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:11.000]   and these built-in incentives that the old system had.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.600]   And then maybe similarly in continental Europe,
[00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:16.840]   Napoleon gets rid of these guilds,
[00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:19.680]   he gets rid of these titles of nobility
[00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:22.400]   and these arcane systems.
[00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:24.240]   To what extent is public choice theory
[00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:27.520]   also a good model of what was happening at the time?
[00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:29.960]   - Yes, and that's, I think, yeah,
[00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:33.320]   I would agree with that to a great deal
[00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:38.320]   in that ultimately, usually I end my lectures
[00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:40.400]   in my Napoleonic history courses
[00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:44.200]   by saying that ultimately Napoleon is a loser
[00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:48.160]   in that he lost the war, he lost the empire,
[00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:53.160]   he ended the life on that godforsaken place in Atlantic.
[00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:59.000]   But the impact that he left stays with that
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:03.520]   in that in the post-Napoleonic period,
[00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:06.920]   the European powers have to grapple with his legacy.
[00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:11.160]   Even though his changes, for example,
[00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:16.160]   are reversed in Italy,
[00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:20.200]   where his United Kingdom of Italy is abolished
[00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:24.440]   and pre-Napoleonic arrangements are restored.
[00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:27.000]   Even though we see restoration of the ruling dynasties
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:30.800]   that he overthrew, we cannot reverse the clock.
[00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:34.240]   We cannot simply go back to pre-Napoleonic era
[00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:36.320]   and pretend that it didn't happen.
[00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:41.320]   So you have to accept the changes that he introduced.
[00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:44.560]   Now, the question is to what degree you will accept.
[00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:47.480]   And here again, we can look at the kind of gradation
[00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:51.040]   and there are some areas like in Southern
[00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:53.280]   and Western Germany where Napoleon,
[00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:55.160]   and certainly in Netherlands and in Belgium
[00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:57.560]   and in Northern Italy where the impact
[00:36:57.560 --> 00:37:00.440]   was so pronounced that it stays,
[00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:04.720]   that it will be simply impossible to turn the clock back.
[00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:08.960]   But in other areas, it was easier to accept some changes
[00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:11.080]   and then reverse many others.
[00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:15.600]   So for example, we know that in places like in Poland
[00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:19.640]   or in Southern Italy or in Spain,
[00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:24.640]   the Napoleonic impact in terms of the changes
[00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:29.680]   of the old regime was far less pronounced
[00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:33.640]   than in the core areas of Europe.
[00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:36.760]   And so, but overall, I think you're right
[00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:41.720]   in that Napoleon represented such a major blow
[00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:45.040]   to the old regime that it simply couldn't stay
[00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:45.920]   the way it was.
[00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:49.000]   It had to reinvent itself and reinvent it did, right?
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.720]   And in this post-Napoleonic era.
[00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:55.240]   And here, I do want to point out that oftentimes
[00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:58.600]   we think about this post-Napoleonic reconstruction
[00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:01.640]   as this conservative, you know, reaction,
[00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:05.760]   this arch conservatives and, you know, the reactionaries.
[00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:08.840]   But we have to bear in mind that majority
[00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:12.280]   of these conservatives were not against the change.
[00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:14.200]   Even Metternich, who is usually perceived
[00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:18.800]   as this arch conservative, you know, villain,
[00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:21.920]   he is not averse to change.
[00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:25.760]   He's averse to revolutionary pace of the change.
[00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:28.840]   And so here in the post-Napoleonic era,
[00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:31.920]   but these great powers were willing to accept reforms
[00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:36.680]   and changes that came gradually in a controlled environment.
[00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:40.320]   And that's essentially what we see taking place
[00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:42.160]   in the decades after Napoleon is gone.
[00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:44.280]   - That's very interesting because, you know,
[00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:46.960]   Robert Conquest has these set of laws.
[00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:48.800]   And his second law is that any institution
[00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:50.960]   that is not explicitly right-wing
[00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:53.240]   will eventually become left-wing.
[00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:55.680]   And I don't know, it seems like the course of Europe
[00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:59.160]   after Napoleon, like you have a bloody revolution,
[00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:01.480]   you have this person who causes a massive amount
[00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:03.200]   of death and war.
[00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:05.440]   And then, at least if you're trying
[00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:06.880]   to make the monarchical case, right?
[00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:09.640]   You'd say, oh, this is a result of these revolutionary ideals.
[00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:10.880]   Obviously, monarchy is better.
[00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:12.680]   We should go back to the old ways.
[00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:13.920]   Like maybe intellectually, you would think
[00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:17.400]   that that view would get vindicated, at least at the time.
[00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:21.720]   But it seems like, no, even given the immediate consequences
[00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:24.600]   of the French Revolution and Napoleon,
[00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:29.600]   eventually kind of the system he and the revolution created
[00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:32.200]   endured and caught on the rest of Europe.
[00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:35.000]   Do you have any comments on like this move in history
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.400]   where things, maybe left-wing is not the right word,
[00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:40.480]   but, and in modern is almost a tautology,
[00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:42.640]   but maybe you see what I mean.
[00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:46.080]   - Yes, I think the way I look at it is,
[00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:49.160]   and the way I kind of discuss it with my students
[00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:52.360]   is that I look at what the revolution promised
[00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:55.280]   and at its simplest, right?
[00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:59.480]   The revolution was about quest for equality.
[00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:04.480]   And that quest can be then interpreted in variety of ways.
[00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:06.920]   It can be a political equality
[00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:08.640]   with the suffrage voting and all.
[00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:11.840]   It can be economic equality, social equality,
[00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:13.960]   gender equality, all this, right?
[00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:17.000]   And so to me, the revolution and Napoleon,
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.960]   and then of course the post-Napoleonic period
[00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:22.800]   is not necessarily this left-wing, right-wing
[00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:24.280]   or liberal conservative.
[00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:26.640]   We can use whatever terminology you would like to,
[00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:28.920]   but to me, it's the quest
[00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:32.680]   for these evolving notions of equality.
[00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:36.920]   So for example, when we talk about the politics, right?
[00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:38.480]   The political side of this equality,
[00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:42.600]   we know that revolution produces remarkable documents
[00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:45.800]   in August of 1789 with declaration of rights
[00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:49.960]   of men and a citizen proclaiming in his very first article
[00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:53.800]   that men are born and remain free and equal in their rights.
[00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:55.120]   That's a very aspirational,
[00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:57.440]   very idealistic kind of statement,
[00:40:57.440 --> 00:41:00.560]   but it's also a problematic statement because it's so vague.
[00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:02.840]   What does it mean, equal in their rights?
[00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:04.560]   And what does it mean to be men, right?
[00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:07.400]   And now in French, the term is homme,
[00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:10.680]   but homme, even though it was used in its context of men
[00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:13.040]   can be interpreted as being as human beings.
[00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:17.240]   And so here then the story of revolution in Napoleon
[00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:20.080]   is the story of the struggle of various groups
[00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:21.640]   for the political equality,
[00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:25.400]   because the revolution after the declaration of rights
[00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:28.440]   of men interpreted this provision as saying,
[00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:32.800]   well, it's equality of those men who are self-reliant,
[00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:35.280]   who are well off that cannot be influenced.
[00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:38.320]   So therefore we're gonna institute property qualification
[00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:41.160]   and let only affluent vote.
[00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:44.080]   Well, what about those who are below the threshold, right?
[00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:46.200]   And so you see then that struggle
[00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:50.160]   during revolution Napoleonic era leading to, for example,
[00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:53.320]   Napoleon proclaiming universal male suffrage.
[00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:55.720]   After Napoleon is overthrown,
[00:41:55.720 --> 00:41:57.080]   that system is reversed
[00:41:57.080 --> 00:42:00.960]   to a much stricter property qualification.
[00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:03.400]   And then you will see again,
[00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:06.000]   universal male suffrage coming back in 1848
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.880]   and staying part of French political narrative.
[00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:13.080]   And the same kind of quest for political equality
[00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:17.240]   can be then traced in many of these other European powers
[00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:21.240]   that were affected by Napoleon, or even in Britain.
[00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:26.200]   I mean, think about the British electoral reforms of 1832,
[00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:29.600]   the great reform bill or 1860s and 1880s.
[00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:34.160]   It is also part of that quest for greater political equality.
[00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:37.200]   Same then, if we're gonna expand our view,
[00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:40.880]   what about then social economic equality, right?
[00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:45.360]   What about the treating our fellow citizens
[00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:48.120]   in more equitably when it comes to wages,
[00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:49.520]   when it comes to working conditions,
[00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:53.680]   when it comes to what we now call the welfare,
[00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:55.680]   kind of social welfare system.
[00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:57.720]   Because these are the ideas
[00:42:57.720 --> 00:42:59.480]   the revolutionaries were grappling with,
[00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:00.840]   Napoleon was grappling with,
[00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:03.080]   and of course in post-Napoleonic period,
[00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:05.600]   they all were trying to find a way
[00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:07.720]   to answer these challenges.
[00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:11.120]   So in 1848, for example, French socialists
[00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:15.840]   try to find a solution to the existing problem
[00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:17.560]   of the socio-economic inequality
[00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:21.800]   by setting up what they refer to as national workshops,
[00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:24.600]   effectively a state subsidized system
[00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:26.000]   where people could register
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.920]   and drew sustenance from the state.
[00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:30.840]   And it is this time when we see
[00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:34.400]   the kind of the concept of right to work
[00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:39.400]   come into the public discussion.
[00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:42.560]   So that's how I look at it.
[00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:45.040]   And then again, we can look at the gender equality,
[00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:47.160]   we can look at the issues, for example,
[00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:51.360]   of slavery that is at its simplest
[00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:53.440]   about the quality of human beings.
[00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:57.280]   - And how did growing up in the former Soviet Union,
[00:43:57.280 --> 00:44:02.280]   how has that shaped your views about sort of idealistic,
[00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:06.200]   revolution for equality,
[00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:09.640]   and then deferring to a sort of enlightened despot?
[00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:12.800]   How has that shaped your views here?
[00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:17.000]   - Well, my kids, I have two kids, I have two boys,
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:19.640]   and the oldest one is already reaching that age
[00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:21.840]   when he's studying this modern history.
[00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:24.160]   And one of the other day,
[00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:27.400]   he kind of came to realization
[00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:29.600]   that I was born and raised in the evil empire.
[00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:34.040]   So he was quizzing me about what it was like, father,
[00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:36.000]   to be on the other side.
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.320]   I'm like, "Well, thank you, son."
[00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:40.520]   I think, of course, it has a direct impact
[00:44:40.520 --> 00:44:43.000]   because I was born and raised in Soviet Union.
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:46.680]   And my father was a critic of the Soviet system.
[00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:50.840]   And I remember him as a young man
[00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:54.360]   back in the early '80s,
[00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:57.160]   listening to, secretly listening to the broadcasts
[00:44:57.160 --> 00:45:01.720]   of Voice of America or BBC, which were kind of muffed,
[00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:03.600]   but he would still listen.
[00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:06.800]   And these are some of my early memories as a child
[00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:08.120]   when my father would sneak out
[00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:12.440]   and kind of secretly listen to a radio receiver
[00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:14.840]   that he fashioned.
[00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:18.040]   And I think that kind of imperial,
[00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:21.240]   that experience within imperial entity,
[00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:24.320]   it does, it did have an impact on me.
[00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:30.520]   And certainly shaped me because Soviet Union collapsed
[00:45:30.520 --> 00:45:33.440]   when I was becoming, my character,
[00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:38.440]   my personality was being forged in '90s.
[00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:44.480]   And I lived through the debris of the post-Soviet era
[00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:47.040]   with this economic devastation,
[00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:51.360]   with its civil strife, with its economic collapse.
[00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:54.320]   So in that sense, I, in many respects,
[00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:57.720]   I can relate to that generation
[00:45:57.720 --> 00:45:59.440]   that lived through Napoleonic era,
[00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:01.240]   saw the collapse of the empires
[00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:04.200]   and then lived through the post-imperial,
[00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:06.080]   kind of post-Napoleonic era,
[00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:08.880]   which was a period of economic turbulence,
[00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:12.480]   economic stagnation in many parts of Europe,
[00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:16.480]   not to mention the civil strife
[00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:19.520]   that revolution Napoleon unleashed in many parts of Europe.
[00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:23.680]   So I think, for example, just if nothing else,
[00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:26.280]   I would now oftentimes tell students
[00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:30.440]   that living through the '90s in Georgia
[00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:33.720]   was grappling with basic necessities,
[00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:37.480]   such as standing in line for bread for two or three days,
[00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:41.000]   kind of waiting for a loaf, a piece of, a loaf of bread.
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:44.600]   And when I talk about the French experiencing,
[00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:46.440]   for example, during revolution,
[00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:51.440]   this hardship and trying to really find the sustenance
[00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:56.720]   and seek out, like me, pieces of bread in various bakeries,
[00:46:56.720 --> 00:47:02.880]   I could, on some level, could relate to their misery, right?
[00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:04.880]   Could relate to their frustration.
[00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:08.920]   - I guess another aspect of this conflict is,
[00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:13.200]   so I know very little about history,
[00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:15.680]   which is why it was very fun to read this book
[00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:19.360]   and to, I guess, venture forth and learn more
[00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:20.880]   about Europe history through the podcast.
[00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:23.560]   But one of the things that's interesting to me
[00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:26.400]   is that it seems that there's like
[00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:30.200]   these punctuated equilibrium in international relations,
[00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:35.200]   and you have these long periods of peace,
[00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:39.240]   and then you have these periods where there's massive wars,
[00:47:39.240 --> 00:47:41.960]   massive death, borders get reshuffled.
[00:47:41.960 --> 00:47:45.000]   I guess from the Seven Years' War to the Napoleonic Wars,
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.360]   and then from there to World War I.
[00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:51.520]   And then, maybe we can draw that line to today,
[00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:54.520]   where since World War II, we've had peace in Europe,
[00:47:54.520 --> 00:47:57.720]   and then now we have the conflict in Ukraine.
[00:47:57.720 --> 00:48:00.480]   Well, is this a pattern you see?
[00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:02.840]   And if you do, what is the explanation?
[00:48:02.840 --> 00:48:06.200]   - Well, I mean, if we look at the conflict in Ukraine,
[00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:10.640]   and that's the conflict that has a direct relevance to me,
[00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:11.960]   because it's part and parcel
[00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:15.920]   of the Russian Imperial Project.
[00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:20.040]   In many respects, this conflict doesn't start
[00:48:20.040 --> 00:48:24.320]   in February of 2022, or in 2014,
[00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:26.160]   when Russia took over Crimea
[00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:27.640]   and the Eastern provinces of Ukraine.
[00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:29.600]   But to me, it starts in 2008,
[00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:32.800]   when we had a war between Russia and Georgia,
[00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:35.080]   for that very reason, right?
[00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:39.040]   Of the countries, of the group of people
[00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:43.040]   seeking a course of development that is different
[00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:46.880]   from the one that the Russian government
[00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:48.120]   has envisioned for them.
[00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:52.200]   So that's where I see,
[00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:57.200]   and if you look at the rhetoric that comes from Moscow,
[00:48:57.200 --> 00:49:02.400]   and the statements by President Putin or his ministers,
[00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:04.840]   they all have the echoes
[00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:07.640]   of the 19th century great power politics,
[00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:09.560]   which, as far as I'm concerned,
[00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:13.640]   should stay part of history rather than the reality.
[00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:15.960]   As you pointed out, in the post-World War II period,
[00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:20.960]   we went to great length to fashion an international system
[00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:24.880]   to prevent the very imperial,
[00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:27.720]   so the very kind of great power politics
[00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:32.160]   that dominated the global development
[00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:36.400]   in the later half of the 19th century.
[00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:38.520]   Because look at, effectively,
[00:49:38.520 --> 00:49:42.360]   what Putin's kind of grand strategy is,
[00:49:42.360 --> 00:49:44.400]   is to carve out spheres of influence,
[00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:48.240]   which would be not unlike what Catherine the Great,
[00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:50.800]   for example, did in the late 18th century,
[00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:53.720]   when under her leadership,
[00:49:53.720 --> 00:49:57.240]   Russia partitioned Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth,
[00:49:57.240 --> 00:49:58.760]   coincidentally, the very territory
[00:49:58.760 --> 00:50:03.200]   that involves the war today, right?
[00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:05.400]   Ukraine, the Baltic states.
[00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:09.720]   So that's where I see the kind of connections.
[00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:12.720]   And to me, it is absolutely paramount
[00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:16.240]   to contain these imperial impulses
[00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:21.240]   and to ensure that the people have agency,
[00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:24.080]   that people have the ability to self-determine their fate.
[00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:27.520]   I mean, that's kind of to go back to your earlier question
[00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:29.160]   about my own experiences.
[00:50:29.160 --> 00:50:30.320]   I lived through the '90s.
[00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:32.880]   I lived through the National Liberation Movement.
[00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:34.360]   I lived through the Civil War.
[00:50:34.360 --> 00:50:36.680]   I lived through this, our own Georgian efforts
[00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:40.680]   to figure out who we are and what we wanna be.
[00:50:40.680 --> 00:50:44.240]   But that's exactly the issue,
[00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:48.800]   and it should be our decision, as a group of people,
[00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:53.800]   to figure out whether we wanna be a Western nation,
[00:50:53.800 --> 00:50:56.760]   whether our ideals are more attuned to European,
[00:50:56.760 --> 00:50:58.480]   or whether we would like to seek
[00:50:58.480 --> 00:51:00.880]   closer relationship with Russia.
[00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:04.280]   We should not be punished by an outside power
[00:51:04.280 --> 00:51:09.120]   for seeking a course that disagrees with its vision.
[00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:11.880]   And same applies for Ukraine, right?
[00:51:11.880 --> 00:51:13.680]   To me, the war in Ukraine
[00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:17.080]   is about the agency of the Ukrainian people.
[00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:19.840]   - What changed between before World War II and afterwards
[00:51:19.840 --> 00:51:22.080]   that didn't change after the Napoleonic Wars?
[00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:23.480]   Do you think that after the Napoleonic Wars
[00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:25.200]   that if the international norms could change,
[00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:26.240]   they would have changed at that time
[00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:28.680]   to be like, okay, no more great conquest,
[00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:30.640]   but maybe it took till World War II?
[00:51:30.640 --> 00:51:34.320]   And then what has caused this idea
[00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:37.600]   that you can have these kinds of,
[00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:39.840]   you can expand into what you perceive
[00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:41.280]   to be your zone of influence?
[00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:44.720]   So how do you explain these two different changes of norms?
[00:51:44.720 --> 00:51:46.920]   - Actually, the interesting thing is
[00:51:46.920 --> 00:51:48.960]   the immediate post-Napoleonic era
[00:51:48.960 --> 00:51:52.320]   saw the creation of a new international security system,
[00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:53.720]   absolutely remarkable.
[00:51:53.720 --> 00:51:56.120]   And there are my dear colleagues,
[00:51:56.120 --> 00:51:58.160]   like Professor Beatrice de Graaf
[00:51:58.160 --> 00:52:00.080]   from the University of Utrecht,
[00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:01.720]   has written fascinating studies.
[00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:04.960]   And we talk about just last two years or so,
[00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:10.120]   exploring the impact of Napoleonic Wars
[00:52:10.120 --> 00:52:12.840]   on crafting this new international system.
[00:52:12.840 --> 00:52:14.640]   And the hallmarks of this system
[00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:19.640]   was indeed the balance of power,
[00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:24.320]   where these great powers sought to maintain certain parity.
[00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:27.840]   The goal of this was international cooperation
[00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:31.480]   to prevent political instability in Europe.
[00:52:31.480 --> 00:52:35.160]   So hence we see, for example, the great power cooperation,
[00:52:35.160 --> 00:52:39.040]   the issues of suppression of revolutionary cycles
[00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:41.320]   in 1820s and 1830s.
[00:52:41.320 --> 00:52:46.200]   And kind of to draw parallel to World War I or World War II,
[00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:47.880]   one of the things that we oftentimes forget
[00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:50.760]   that it is Napoleonic Wars that pioneered
[00:52:50.760 --> 00:52:54.560]   new mechanism of dealing with the defeated power.
[00:52:54.560 --> 00:52:56.880]   And that includes occupational regimes,
[00:52:56.880 --> 00:53:01.880]   that includes development schedules of reparation payments.
[00:53:01.880 --> 00:53:05.720]   Yes, defeated powers before, right,
[00:53:05.720 --> 00:53:07.240]   had to pay war indemnities.
[00:53:07.240 --> 00:53:11.920]   But post-Napoleonic era saw a very different mechanism
[00:53:11.920 --> 00:53:13.160]   that involved occupation,
[00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:15.200]   that involved extraction of resources,
[00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:17.120]   that is formalized,
[00:53:17.120 --> 00:53:19.720]   and that is a kind of part of the coalition,
[00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:22.680]   which is very similar to what, for example,
[00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:25.400]   was done in post-World War II period.
[00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:28.240]   In 1815, for example,
[00:53:28.240 --> 00:53:30.400]   France is dividing the zones of occupation
[00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:33.720]   and European powers have occupational troops
[00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:35.720]   that are occupying specific regions
[00:53:35.720 --> 00:53:40.720]   as a way of de-bonapartize France,
[00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:43.680]   just like in the post-World War II.
[00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:46.600]   We have Germany dividing the zones of occupation
[00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:48.920]   with the policy of denazification.
[00:53:48.920 --> 00:53:51.160]   - Why was this not implemented after World War I,
[00:53:51.160 --> 00:53:53.040]   the occupational policy?
[00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:54.760]   Was that just a massive oversight?
[00:53:54.760 --> 00:53:58.280]   - No, well, partly because I think we have to bear in mind
[00:53:58.280 --> 00:54:00.320]   that unlike World War II,
[00:54:00.320 --> 00:54:05.160]   the war didn't directly reach Germany, right?
[00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:10.160]   It was mostly fought in Northern France and in Belgium
[00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:13.440]   and kind of the Rhineland area,
[00:54:13.440 --> 00:54:17.440]   but Germany itself remained intact for much of it.
[00:54:17.440 --> 00:54:20.160]   And certainly by the end of the war,
[00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:23.400]   the sheer exhaustion of France and Britain
[00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:25.080]   and the collapse of Russia,
[00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:26.920]   the collapse of Austria and other powers
[00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:28.360]   certainly create the reality
[00:54:28.360 --> 00:54:31.840]   that was very different from 1945,
[00:54:31.840 --> 00:54:34.280]   when you have a grand alliance
[00:54:34.280 --> 00:54:36.040]   and that grand alliance is determined
[00:54:36.040 --> 00:54:39.160]   to carve out the zones of occupation, right?
[00:54:39.160 --> 00:54:43.960]   I mean, think about kind of United States in 1919
[00:54:43.960 --> 00:54:46.680]   with its self-imposed isolation
[00:54:46.680 --> 00:54:51.200]   is a very different entity from the 1945 United States
[00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:56.200]   that is keen on keeping its presence in Europe.
[00:54:56.200 --> 00:55:01.920]   Same applies for Russia in 1919 is imploding,
[00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:06.760]   while in 1945, it is quite strong,
[00:55:06.760 --> 00:55:09.320]   or at least it will be on its way
[00:55:09.320 --> 00:55:11.440]   to recovering from the war.
[00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:13.280]   And it certainly has the military capacity
[00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:17.000]   to carve out a zone of occupation in Eastern Germany.
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:19.680]   - So another question I have about the Napoleonic Wars
[00:55:19.680 --> 00:55:24.680]   is it seems that, so in the Seven Years' War in 1756,
[00:55:24.680 --> 00:55:27.520]   France loses.
[00:55:27.520 --> 00:55:30.880]   It's not that long before the Napoleonic Wars happen.
[00:55:30.880 --> 00:55:34.520]   And when France is fighting the Napoleonic Wars,
[00:55:34.520 --> 00:55:36.040]   it's like gone through a bloody revolution.
[00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:37.640]   It's a completely new regime.
[00:55:37.640 --> 00:55:40.920]   So in many ways, it should be in a weaker position,
[00:55:40.920 --> 00:55:43.080]   it seems, just from the politics
[00:55:43.080 --> 00:55:44.720]   of what's happening in France.
[00:55:44.720 --> 00:55:47.960]   And obviously, France absolutely dominates
[00:55:47.960 --> 00:55:50.160]   for like a decade afterwards.
[00:55:50.160 --> 00:55:53.160]   So, you know, like, I mean, maybe in like financial terms,
[00:55:53.160 --> 00:55:54.280]   you can think of like in business,
[00:55:54.280 --> 00:55:55.240]   there's like private equity,
[00:55:55.240 --> 00:55:58.000]   where if a firm has good potential,
[00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:00.600]   but it has like a lot of assets under management,
[00:56:00.600 --> 00:56:02.680]   but I don't know, it just has bad leadership.
[00:56:02.680 --> 00:56:04.600]   You can have another one that like buys it out
[00:56:04.600 --> 00:56:06.320]   and then runs it better.
[00:56:06.320 --> 00:56:08.280]   So is that the story here?
[00:56:08.280 --> 00:56:11.720]   Like why did the French military and government
[00:56:11.720 --> 00:56:14.280]   just seem to get so much more effective
[00:56:14.280 --> 00:56:15.480]   between these two wars?
[00:56:15.480 --> 00:56:20.120]   - Yes, I think, again, there are multiple threats
[00:56:20.120 --> 00:56:23.720]   that come together in this period.
[00:56:23.720 --> 00:56:25.520]   So one of them, for example,
[00:56:25.520 --> 00:56:30.520]   is the France's ability to mass mobilize.
[00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:37.040]   And that is particularly is clear in 1793, '95 period,
[00:56:37.040 --> 00:56:39.760]   when in response to being confronted
[00:56:39.760 --> 00:56:41.560]   by the European coalition,
[00:56:41.560 --> 00:56:44.240]   France begins a system that we, you know,
[00:56:44.240 --> 00:56:46.560]   that we refer to as levée en masse,
[00:56:46.560 --> 00:56:50.240]   which involves mass mobilization of manpower,
[00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:52.200]   that involves development of a home front
[00:56:52.200 --> 00:56:53.560]   to support war effort.
[00:56:53.560 --> 00:56:56.160]   You know, in the military history,
[00:56:56.160 --> 00:56:58.360]   we oftentimes grapple with this kind of concept
[00:56:58.360 --> 00:57:00.160]   of limited war.
[00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:03.080]   And I think limited in the sense that
[00:57:03.080 --> 00:57:05.360]   conflict before the French Revolution,
[00:57:05.360 --> 00:57:07.880]   well, we're, you know, kind of isolated affairs
[00:57:07.880 --> 00:57:11.600]   that didn't affect the society as a whole, right?
[00:57:11.600 --> 00:57:13.840]   So you have much smaller forces,
[00:57:13.840 --> 00:57:18.360]   you know, the conflicts for the kind of obvious,
[00:57:18.360 --> 00:57:22.480]   clear, dynastic or political goals.
[00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:24.960]   Now, the French Revolution is different in this,
[00:57:24.960 --> 00:57:28.320]   in that it mobilized far greater percentage
[00:57:28.320 --> 00:57:29.680]   of the population.
[00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:31.840]   And, you know, if you read the text
[00:57:31.840 --> 00:57:33.080]   of the levée en masse decree,
[00:57:33.080 --> 00:57:36.400]   it talks about young men registering and serving,
[00:57:36.400 --> 00:57:40.600]   children being, you know, participating in helping,
[00:57:40.600 --> 00:57:45.600]   you know, in production and manufacturing,
[00:57:45.600 --> 00:57:50.720]   women kind of supporting the home front
[00:57:50.720 --> 00:57:55.720]   and even the elderly kind of providing that moral boost
[00:57:55.720 --> 00:57:59.920]   and kind of inspiration and leadership for the population.
[00:57:59.920 --> 00:58:04.920]   So it's a more encompassing vision of nation at war.
[00:58:04.920 --> 00:58:10.000]   And this is very difficult to defeat an entity like this.
[00:58:10.680 --> 00:58:14.600]   And France shows that, you know,
[00:58:14.600 --> 00:58:17.800]   with this, that they are as a nation
[00:58:17.800 --> 00:58:20.600]   that can mobilize greater manpower,
[00:58:20.600 --> 00:58:24.600]   that can put greater government controls on the economy
[00:58:24.600 --> 00:58:29.880]   and armed with an ideology that it can overrun
[00:58:29.880 --> 00:58:35.360]   what we will, you know, can call the old regime forces.
[00:58:35.360 --> 00:58:38.400]   It doesn't mean that the old regime armies
[00:58:38.400 --> 00:58:39.880]   were inherently weaker
[00:58:39.880 --> 00:58:42.480]   or inherently kind of destined to lose.
[00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:43.320]   Not at all.
[00:58:43.320 --> 00:58:45.680]   The fact that it took a decade
[00:58:45.680 --> 00:58:50.280]   for the revolution to prevail over the old regime, right,
[00:58:50.280 --> 00:58:55.160]   until 1802, when the revolutionary wars are formally over,
[00:58:55.160 --> 00:58:58.160]   testifies to the resilience of the old regime.
[00:58:58.160 --> 00:59:02.160]   But it is also a conflict
[00:59:02.160 --> 00:59:05.160]   in which the old regime has to respond,
[00:59:05.160 --> 00:59:08.360]   has to kind of tweak itself.
[00:59:08.360 --> 00:59:10.440]   Napoleon, then, as a kind of,
[00:59:10.440 --> 00:59:12.040]   to move away from structural issues
[00:59:12.040 --> 00:59:13.080]   to more individual issues,
[00:59:13.080 --> 00:59:16.120]   Napoleon, whether you like him or not,
[00:59:16.120 --> 00:59:18.160]   you know, even his greatest critics admit
[00:59:18.160 --> 00:59:22.640]   that he was a brilliant, brilliant individual,
[00:59:22.640 --> 00:59:26.600]   very capable, workaholic,
[00:59:26.600 --> 00:59:29.640]   an individual who could multitask like,
[00:59:29.640 --> 00:59:32.920]   unlike anyone you really can, you know,
[00:59:32.920 --> 00:59:35.200]   encounter in pages of history books.
[00:59:35.200 --> 00:59:37.760]   You know, his ability to control
[00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:39.800]   at the height of the empire,
[00:59:39.800 --> 00:59:42.400]   virtual continent, an entire continent
[00:59:42.400 --> 00:59:45.000]   before the time of phones and internet
[00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:48.240]   and instant communication is just staggering.
[00:59:48.240 --> 00:59:51.560]   And Napoleon does play an important role
[00:59:51.560 --> 00:59:54.760]   because of his sheer brilliance on the battlefield.
[00:59:54.760 --> 00:59:58.640]   I mean, it's hard to imagine, you know,
[00:59:58.640 --> 01:00:01.480]   kind of France going on a rampage
[01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:04.240]   as it did in 1805 to 1809 period
[01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:09.840]   without Napoleon because he brings so much to the table.
[01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:12.480]   Wellington, I think, has that famous statement
[01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:16.640]   that Napoleon was equal to 40,000 men on the battlefield,
[01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:19.280]   right, that he brought so much to the table.
[01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:25.280]   And the interesting thing is that Napoleon
[01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:28.760]   is not necessarily the only one that France had.
[01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:32.720]   In fact, that revolutionary decade produced
[01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:36.560]   a number of brilliant military commanders.
[01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:41.440]   It produced a number of talented men
[01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:43.360]   in bureaucracy and finance.
[01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:46.080]   In fact, one of the books that I want to write
[01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:48.520]   and that's part of that kind of economic side
[01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:53.080]   of the history is a brilliant financial wizard
[01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:56.320]   that, as far as I'm concerned,
[01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:59.320]   essentially bankrolled Napoleon for much of his reign
[01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:03.760]   and, most crucially, ensured rapid French Reconstruction
[01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:05.160]   in the post-Napoleonic era.
[01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:09.720]   So it's dealing with this individual agency
[01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:11.600]   that also makes this period fascinating
[01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:16.600]   because you find the characters that are simply amazing.
[01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:18.000]   - I wonder what you think of this,
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.560]   but it seems to me, you know, I'm in tech circles
[01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:23.160]   and it seems to me that if Napoleon was alive today,
[01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:25.600]   he'd be a star founder, you know, as you mentioned.
[01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:27.440]   (laughing)
[01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:28.280]   - I love that.
[01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:32.280]   I love the long hours, the ability to micromanage
[01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:36.120]   and to multitask, obviously the leadership
[01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:38.320]   and the ability to inspire.
[01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:40.720]   And then also, most importantly maybe,
[01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:45.720]   the sort of the risk taking there, right?
[01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:48.640]   If you see something, well, I mean,
[01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:50.760]   a startup founder has to, they're probably gonna fail,
[01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:53.320]   so they're just trying to maximize the expected value,
[01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:56.120]   like increase the odds that you have a trillion dollar
[01:01:56.120 --> 01:01:59.120]   company, not necessarily that you have make any money,
[01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:01.600]   not necessarily increase the odds you make some money.
[01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:04.960]   So yeah, just the risk taking, especially,
[01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:07.000]   it seems to me that, what do you think about this?
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.480]   Would Napoleon, I don't know, become the CEO
[01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:10.520]   of a company like Tesla?
[01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:13.080]   - I love this vision of Napoleon as Elon Musk, right?
[01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:15.240]   (laughing)
[01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:18.560]   There is a fascinating movie.
[01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:22.400]   It's a kind of light comedy called "Emperor's New Clothes"
[01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:23.920]   that envisions Napoleon escaping
[01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:28.360]   from San Helena Island in disguise, leaving a double.
[01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:30.680]   And then before he can return to France,
[01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:33.920]   his double dies and he's buried with all the honors
[01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:35.880]   and then real Napoleon finds himself caught
[01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:38.520]   in this kind of conundrum of trying to prove himself.
[01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:41.360]   And what he does, he starts a business in Paris
[01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:46.360]   of selling bread and using his military genius strategy,
[01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:51.360]   he comes to dominate the baking industry,
[01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:53.440]   baking business in Paris.
[01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:56.280]   So Napoleon, yes, somebody already envisioned him
[01:02:56.280 --> 01:02:57.880]   as a startup guy.
[01:02:57.880 --> 01:02:59.680]   (laughing)
[01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:00.520]   - Oh, wait, what was his name again?
[01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:01.840]   - "Emperor's New Clothes."
[01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:07.400]   He had a wonderful Yan home reprising the role of Napoleon
[01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:09.040]   and he's quite good at it.
[01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:13.400]   And so he does have a mindset for that.
[01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:18.160]   Napoleon has ability, well, first of all, let me put it,
[01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:20.920]   by nature, he was a very gifted man
[01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:23.100]   with the almost photographic memory.
[01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:25.440]   So he retained minutiae of detail
[01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:28.960]   and I've spent better part of quarter century
[01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:32.120]   examining his documents and going through the archives
[01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:34.840]   and dealing with the paperwork that he left behind
[01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:37.320]   and it's prodigious.
[01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:41.880]   We just finished a collective effort of publishing
[01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:45.200]   kind of compilation of his personal letters
[01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:49.160]   and we had to stop at 44,000.
[01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:51.360]   And that doesn't account for the government decision,
[01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:55.360]   the government paperwork that he reviewed and then signed on
[01:03:55.360 --> 01:04:00.360]   and in my books on 1812, you kind of see him deep in Russia.
[01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:07.000]   He's governing empire that stretches from Spain to Poland
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:10.380]   and from Denmark to Croatia, right?
[01:04:10.380 --> 01:04:12.580]   And he deals with minutiae of the details.
[01:04:12.580 --> 01:04:16.900]   So he would have been in that sense, a micromanaging CEO.
[01:04:16.900 --> 01:04:19.460]   Again, I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing
[01:04:19.460 --> 01:04:24.180]   because it has its pros and cons, but he was a micromanager.
[01:04:24.180 --> 01:04:25.020]   - Have you seen the videos?
[01:04:25.020 --> 01:04:25.860]   - Yeah.
[01:04:25.860 --> 01:04:28.020]   - Have you seen the videos of Elon Musk
[01:04:28.020 --> 01:04:29.860]   going through the minutiae of these--
[01:04:29.860 --> 01:04:30.680]   - That's what I'm saying.
[01:04:30.680 --> 01:04:32.860]   - The Tesla plant and then also like the Raptor--
[01:04:32.860 --> 01:04:34.380]   - Yeah, yeah, that's exactly what I'm saying.
[01:04:34.380 --> 01:04:35.820]   Napoleon would have been that.
[01:04:35.820 --> 01:04:37.180]   And the worst thing is that,
[01:04:37.180 --> 01:04:40.700]   I don't know how good Elon's memory is,
[01:04:40.700 --> 01:04:43.460]   Napoleon's is brilliant and he would be kind of
[01:04:43.460 --> 01:04:47.380]   on a page, there's Skoll, you know, footnote that.
[01:04:47.380 --> 01:04:49.340]   You found, you found, yeah.
[01:04:49.340 --> 01:04:52.800]   - There is a fascinating moment when he's in Moscow,
[01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:56.500]   he actually noticed that a small battalion
[01:04:56.500 --> 01:04:59.580]   was sent on the wrong road in the countryside
[01:04:59.580 --> 01:05:01.480]   in Central Italy.
[01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:04.500]   Who does that kind of thing, right?
[01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:09.500]   They're kind of keeping that level of detail.
[01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:14.380]   Or as an emperor, he actually supervised
[01:05:14.380 --> 01:05:17.380]   what we can say, I think, a modern police state.
[01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:20.140]   The extent of the police surveillance
[01:05:20.140 --> 01:05:22.380]   of the French population is stunning.
[01:05:22.380 --> 01:05:24.380]   And as part of it, what is interesting is that
[01:05:24.380 --> 01:05:29.020]   he required weekly reports on what people,
[01:05:29.020 --> 01:05:30.700]   average people, kind of common people,
[01:05:30.700 --> 01:05:32.020]   would say in the streets.
[01:05:32.020 --> 01:05:35.400]   And police agents would compile these reports
[01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:38.580]   from all across France and he would receive digests.
[01:05:38.580 --> 01:05:40.980]   So on top of everything else that he would be doing,
[01:05:40.980 --> 01:05:43.380]   he would sit down and kind of going through
[01:05:43.380 --> 01:05:47.340]   and learning what Alex said on Thursday
[01:05:47.340 --> 01:05:49.620]   and what Varkesh said on Friday, right?
[01:05:49.620 --> 01:05:53.780]   And it is expression of public sentiment.
[01:05:53.780 --> 01:05:58.500]   So no, he had all the preconditions for it.
[01:05:58.500 --> 01:06:03.500]   And kind of at the last point, he loved technology.
[01:06:03.500 --> 01:06:06.500]   And he supported technology.
[01:06:06.500 --> 01:06:08.260]   He'd support, for example, he was the one
[01:06:08.260 --> 01:06:11.820]   who set up prizes for technological improvements
[01:06:11.820 --> 01:06:14.940]   that benefited the French military.
[01:06:14.940 --> 01:06:19.940]   It's a famous story of him setting a ward
[01:06:19.940 --> 01:06:23.380]   for developing new ways of preserving food,
[01:06:23.380 --> 01:06:24.980]   which led to conservation.
[01:06:24.980 --> 01:06:29.060]   The kind of jars that we are now consuming
[01:06:29.060 --> 01:06:31.420]   actually come from Napoleon era.
[01:06:31.420 --> 01:06:33.220]   Or it is Napoleon who, for example,
[01:06:33.220 --> 01:06:35.300]   conducted or supported experiments
[01:06:35.300 --> 01:06:37.420]   on developing submarine technology.
[01:06:37.420 --> 01:06:39.460]   In fact, in the middle of Paris on the Seine River,
[01:06:39.460 --> 01:06:42.180]   they tested submarines and it didn't work out
[01:06:42.180 --> 01:06:45.500]   and the submarines were leaking, so he didn't adopt it.
[01:06:45.500 --> 01:06:49.100]   But nonetheless, it shows his willingness to embrace it,
[01:06:49.100 --> 01:06:51.340]   this technological development.
[01:06:51.340 --> 01:06:53.540]   He tried to stay abreast of it also.
[01:06:53.540 --> 01:06:55.340]   - Yeah, it's similar with, I think,
[01:06:55.340 --> 01:06:57.020]   many other important leaders in history.
[01:06:57.020 --> 01:07:01.260]   I think Churchill was a big, he was a big aviator.
[01:07:01.260 --> 01:07:05.620]   And I think he crashed at least once.
[01:07:05.620 --> 01:07:08.860]   And also he saw the importance of tanks early on,
[01:07:08.860 --> 01:07:11.220]   I think, while he was in India or something.
[01:07:11.220 --> 01:07:13.020]   So, yeah, that's very interesting.
[01:07:13.020 --> 01:07:17.380]   Now, you mentioned earlier that this era in history
[01:07:17.380 --> 01:07:20.060]   in France brought forth a lot of young,
[01:07:20.060 --> 01:07:23.220]   great young leaders and a lot of young talent.
[01:07:23.220 --> 01:07:24.700]   Was it just that the old people got killed
[01:07:24.700 --> 01:07:29.060]   during the revolution or was there something else going on?
[01:07:29.060 --> 01:07:30.500]   - No, not necessarily.
[01:07:30.500 --> 01:07:32.660]   Revolution was bloody, but not that bloody.
[01:07:32.660 --> 01:07:33.900]   No, there is...
[01:07:37.340 --> 01:07:42.340]   The revolution was about opening careers to talent.
[01:07:42.340 --> 01:07:44.820]   And I think that's one of the great legacies
[01:07:44.820 --> 01:07:47.300]   of revolution and Napoleon,
[01:07:47.300 --> 01:07:50.460]   in that they created a system that valued merit.
[01:07:50.460 --> 01:07:54.540]   Yes, connections still play the role.
[01:07:54.540 --> 01:07:57.700]   I mean, if there is one constant
[01:07:57.700 --> 01:07:59.660]   in the inconstancy of human nature,
[01:07:59.660 --> 01:08:04.100]   and that is that the nepotism and corruption stays with us.
[01:08:04.100 --> 01:08:05.900]   But to a far greater degree,
[01:08:07.060 --> 01:08:08.900]   merit played a role.
[01:08:08.900 --> 01:08:13.380]   And so you see that in the people Napoleon promoted
[01:08:13.380 --> 01:08:16.860]   and surrounding himself with were, again,
[01:08:16.860 --> 01:08:21.100]   his cabinet is quite capable,
[01:08:21.100 --> 01:08:23.180]   and it stays so throughout the empire.
[01:08:23.180 --> 01:08:24.740]   And not just in military, as I said,
[01:08:24.740 --> 01:08:28.540]   but it's in finance, in administration, in science.
[01:08:28.540 --> 01:08:32.940]   It's the ability for a person from a humble background
[01:08:32.940 --> 01:08:36.100]   to go to a school, to distinguish himself
[01:08:36.100 --> 01:08:40.460]   through his, and at this time, it's largely his, right?
[01:08:40.460 --> 01:08:43.300]   That the women were not given the equality
[01:08:43.300 --> 01:08:46.940]   through his talent and merit and rise to the top.
[01:08:46.940 --> 01:08:47.860]   That's what matters.
[01:08:47.860 --> 01:08:50.460]   And that's what is missing, I think,
[01:08:50.460 --> 01:08:52.740]   in many other areas of Europe at this time,
[01:08:52.740 --> 01:08:56.340]   in parts like in Spain, in Southern Italy,
[01:08:56.340 --> 01:08:58.620]   in Austria, in Russia.
[01:08:58.620 --> 01:09:00.100]   There is a far less opportunity
[01:09:00.100 --> 01:09:02.780]   for a commoner to rise to the top.
[01:09:03.940 --> 01:09:07.940]   But Napoleon makes sure that by the time he's gone,
[01:09:07.940 --> 01:09:10.500]   that the system is already entrenched.
[01:09:10.500 --> 01:09:13.060]   That yes, monarchy will be restored,
[01:09:13.060 --> 01:09:14.580]   Bourbons will be back,
[01:09:14.580 --> 01:09:17.900]   but even Bourbons will have to accept the charter,
[01:09:17.900 --> 01:09:19.500]   this constitutional arrangement,
[01:09:19.500 --> 01:09:22.780]   one of the principles of which will be equality
[01:09:22.780 --> 01:09:25.060]   before the law will be this acceptance
[01:09:25.060 --> 01:09:27.260]   of career solving to merit.
[01:09:27.260 --> 01:09:29.860]   - What happened to this model
[01:09:29.860 --> 01:09:31.740]   of the sort of enlightened despot?
[01:09:31.740 --> 01:09:33.420]   It seems that that's less common today,
[01:09:33.420 --> 01:09:34.980]   maybe the most recent one would have been somebody
[01:09:34.980 --> 01:09:38.900]   like Lee Kuan Yew, who is a similar model to Napoleon.
[01:09:38.900 --> 01:09:43.620]   But what happened to figures like this in our government?
[01:09:43.620 --> 01:09:46.540]   - So in my own research, and certainly in this book,
[01:09:46.540 --> 01:09:49.580]   I'm making an argument,
[01:09:49.580 --> 01:09:50.940]   not necessarily an original argument,
[01:09:50.940 --> 01:09:52.820]   but I certainly am a big proponent of it,
[01:09:52.820 --> 01:09:57.220]   that Napoleon is not necessarily the child of revolution.
[01:09:57.220 --> 01:09:59.900]   Now, he's a product of the revolutionary circumstances,
[01:09:59.900 --> 01:10:03.460]   but he does not necessarily represent revolution as such.
[01:10:03.460 --> 01:10:05.820]   To me, as I mentioned in the book,
[01:10:05.820 --> 01:10:08.380]   he's the last of the enlightened despots,
[01:10:08.380 --> 01:10:12.220]   because much of what he tried to establish,
[01:10:12.220 --> 01:10:15.420]   much what he tried to introduce in equality,
[01:10:15.420 --> 01:10:18.020]   but also order and efficiency,
[01:10:18.020 --> 01:10:20.980]   these are not necessarily the revolutionary ideal,
[01:10:20.980 --> 01:10:24.620]   but these are ideas that other enlightened despots,
[01:10:24.620 --> 01:10:27.060]   including Frederick the Great,
[01:10:27.060 --> 01:10:29.260]   including Joseph II of Austria,
[01:10:29.260 --> 01:10:31.780]   tried also to various degree of success
[01:10:31.780 --> 01:10:34.180]   implementing in their countries.
[01:10:34.180 --> 01:10:36.900]   But Napoleon, I think, is the last of them,
[01:10:36.900 --> 01:10:40.940]   and probably the most successful in that his system survived.
[01:10:40.940 --> 01:10:44.340]   And the reason why he's most successful than Frederick
[01:10:44.340 --> 01:10:48.660]   or Joseph is because of revolution.
[01:10:48.660 --> 01:10:53.540]   Now, Napoleon did not support the radicalism of revolution.
[01:10:53.540 --> 01:10:56.820]   And we see that throughout his life,
[01:10:56.820 --> 01:10:58.020]   even as a young man,
[01:10:58.020 --> 01:11:01.980]   when he witnessed the revolutionary events in Paris,
[01:11:01.980 --> 01:11:06.980]   that he consistently came out against or expressed opinion
[01:11:06.980 --> 01:11:09.540]   against the radicalism of the crowd.
[01:11:09.540 --> 01:11:17.340]   And that, to me, is an element in his mindset
[01:11:17.340 --> 01:11:24.820]   that tells that he's not a revolution on horseback as such,
[01:11:24.820 --> 01:11:27.260]   but enlightened despotism.
[01:11:28.140 --> 01:11:30.060]   Once he passed away, right?
[01:11:30.060 --> 01:11:33.740]   Once he's off the historical stage,
[01:11:33.740 --> 01:11:36.220]   even though we are not talking about
[01:11:36.220 --> 01:11:37.900]   the enlightened despotism as such,
[01:11:37.900 --> 01:11:39.860]   but the core of it still is there.
[01:11:39.860 --> 01:11:43.820]   It's the government trying to bring about changes,
[01:11:43.820 --> 01:11:46.420]   government bring about standardization,
[01:11:46.420 --> 01:11:48.540]   bring about efficiency.
[01:11:48.540 --> 01:11:53.540]   Now, it is not done as overtly or as acutely
[01:11:53.540 --> 01:11:55.700]   as Napoleon did it.
[01:11:55.700 --> 01:11:57.420]   But that's because circumstances
[01:11:57.420 --> 01:11:59.660]   have kind of changed and evolved.
[01:11:59.660 --> 01:12:01.380]   But we still see, for example,
[01:12:01.380 --> 01:12:04.220]   Prussian development in 1820s and '30s
[01:12:04.220 --> 01:12:05.500]   that are part of that,
[01:12:05.500 --> 01:12:09.180]   what I would say is part of
[01:12:09.180 --> 01:12:12.660]   that enlightened rational reform movement.
[01:12:12.660 --> 01:12:17.660]   And even later on in post-Crimean period,
[01:12:17.660 --> 01:12:21.820]   Alexander II, the Russian emperor's great reforms
[01:12:21.820 --> 01:12:24.300]   can be perceived to be as part of that
[01:12:24.300 --> 01:12:27.300]   steady, gradual introduction of change
[01:12:27.300 --> 01:12:29.900]   that will modernize the state.
[01:12:29.900 --> 01:12:32.900]   So, I think you can make an argument
[01:12:32.900 --> 01:12:34.620]   connecting those dots.
[01:12:34.620 --> 01:12:37.940]   - And then what happened to that form of government?
[01:12:37.940 --> 01:12:39.900]   It seems that other than, yeah,
[01:12:39.900 --> 01:12:43.460]   other than Singapore, it's kind of a lost-
[01:12:43.460 --> 01:12:45.420]   - Well, I mean, I wouldn't say,
[01:12:45.420 --> 01:12:47.020]   would you consider, for example,
[01:12:47.020 --> 01:12:49.220]   Soviet state as that?
[01:12:49.220 --> 01:12:51.940]   Because it is a statist approach
[01:12:52.220 --> 01:12:55.700]   that is ushering in rapid transformation of society.
[01:12:55.700 --> 01:13:00.380]   I think it evolved, it's changed its nature.
[01:13:00.380 --> 01:13:02.620]   Singapore is a unique case
[01:13:02.620 --> 01:13:07.620]   in that it was both kind of liberal,
[01:13:07.620 --> 01:13:11.820]   but authoritarian in that sense, right?
[01:13:11.820 --> 01:13:15.020]   It kind of controlled liberal environment.
[01:13:15.020 --> 01:13:18.700]   But Soviet system was authoritarian,
[01:13:18.700 --> 01:13:22.780]   but more radical in its transformations.
[01:13:22.780 --> 01:13:25.900]   So, I think it's a part of evolutionary process
[01:13:25.900 --> 01:13:28.220]   of what's happening.
[01:13:28.220 --> 01:13:30.660]   So, not necessarily that it's withered away
[01:13:30.660 --> 01:13:32.660]   and disappeared.
[01:13:32.660 --> 01:13:33.980]   You certainly can, for example,
[01:13:33.980 --> 01:13:38.980]   make a case for some of the Latin American examples
[01:13:38.980 --> 01:13:43.620]   where this kind of enlightened reform movements
[01:13:43.620 --> 01:13:46.220]   led, spearheaded by an individual
[01:13:46.220 --> 01:13:49.620]   might be still relevant.
[01:13:49.620 --> 01:13:51.020]   - And then, this is the question
[01:13:51.020 --> 01:13:52.580]   I meant to ask you earlier,
[01:13:52.580 --> 01:13:53.780]   which is when we were talking about
[01:13:53.780 --> 01:13:55.140]   how this was a unique time
[01:13:55.140 --> 01:13:57.460]   in terms of giving these talented young people
[01:13:57.460 --> 01:14:00.900]   access to positions based on their merit.
[01:14:00.900 --> 01:14:03.740]   Is that possibly one of the advantages of war,
[01:14:03.740 --> 01:14:05.300]   which is that you have to,
[01:14:05.300 --> 01:14:07.900]   if the weak perish,
[01:14:07.900 --> 01:14:11.700]   then the nations have a very strong incentive
[01:14:11.700 --> 01:14:14.740]   to make sure their systems and their government
[01:14:14.740 --> 01:14:16.580]   are as efficient as possible.
[01:14:16.580 --> 01:14:20.540]   If you look at, let's say, the US,
[01:14:20.540 --> 01:14:21.700]   it's still a meritocracy,
[01:14:21.700 --> 01:14:25.740]   maybe in like private markets,
[01:14:25.740 --> 01:14:30.740]   but the average age of congressman and president
[01:14:30.740 --> 01:14:33.620]   seems to keep increasing.
[01:14:33.620 --> 01:14:35.860]   And maybe that has something to do with,
[01:14:35.860 --> 01:14:37.460]   it's not like titles and nobility anymore,
[01:14:37.460 --> 01:14:40.340]   but it is at greater levels of accreditation.
[01:14:40.340 --> 01:14:42.980]   Is this one of the defenses of war,
[01:14:42.980 --> 01:14:44.900]   which is that it forces countries
[01:14:44.900 --> 01:14:45.980]   to become more efficient?
[01:14:45.980 --> 01:14:50.980]   - No, I think that's a challenging question to deal with
[01:14:50.980 --> 01:14:56.660]   in a sense because in the late 19th century,
[01:14:56.660 --> 01:14:58.180]   social Darwinists, for example,
[01:14:58.180 --> 01:15:01.740]   argued that war was a great perjure of societies
[01:15:01.740 --> 01:15:02.700]   that rejuvenates it.
[01:15:02.700 --> 01:15:04.900]   So, and I'm not sure that we want to
[01:15:04.900 --> 01:15:07.540]   kind of go back to that argument.
[01:15:10.500 --> 01:15:13.140]   The war, I mean, the sheer nature of the war
[01:15:13.140 --> 01:15:16.420]   is that it makes things possible
[01:15:16.420 --> 01:15:19.140]   that in peacetime would be unthinkable.
[01:15:19.140 --> 01:15:23.540]   It is a great, it has a great homogenizing effects.
[01:15:23.540 --> 01:15:26.860]   It suppresses some of the sharper edges
[01:15:26.860 --> 01:15:29.660]   or in some areas, it actually makes those sharper edges
[01:15:29.660 --> 01:15:30.540]   even more pronounced.
[01:15:30.540 --> 01:15:32.100]   And certainly when we talk about it
[01:15:32.100 --> 01:15:34.180]   with French Revolution, for example,
[01:15:34.180 --> 01:15:37.580]   without the war, the revolution would not have radicalized
[01:15:37.580 --> 01:15:40.820]   as rapidly or to the extent that it did, right?
[01:15:40.820 --> 01:15:43.620]   Without the conflict and that started in 1792,
[01:15:43.620 --> 01:15:46.340]   France would have, it's my argument,
[01:15:46.340 --> 01:15:47.700]   would have continued on the path
[01:15:47.700 --> 01:15:50.260]   of a gradual reform movement
[01:15:50.260 --> 01:15:52.260]   towards the constitutional limited monarchy
[01:15:52.260 --> 01:15:56.700]   rather than rush towards a radical republicanism,
[01:15:56.700 --> 01:16:00.300]   terror and violence, which then begat more violence,
[01:16:00.300 --> 01:16:03.900]   more cycles of political instability
[01:16:03.900 --> 01:16:07.020]   and ultimately led to military dictatorship, right?
[01:16:07.020 --> 01:16:08.820]   That's where the war is crucial.
[01:16:08.820 --> 01:16:11.700]   And certainly within that context, right?
[01:16:11.700 --> 01:16:14.140]   In the context of war, there are a lot of things
[01:16:14.140 --> 01:16:18.620]   that revolutionaries thought were justifiable.
[01:16:18.620 --> 01:16:20.660]   For example, suspension of habeas corpus,
[01:16:20.660 --> 01:16:22.860]   for example, arrest and persecution
[01:16:22.860 --> 01:16:25.740]   of their political opponents,
[01:16:25.740 --> 01:16:29.620]   but also instituting great government controls.
[01:16:29.620 --> 01:16:30.980]   Think about law of maximums,
[01:16:30.980 --> 01:16:34.940]   for example, that Jacobins introduced during the terror.
[01:16:34.940 --> 01:16:38.340]   All that is in the context of that fear,
[01:16:38.340 --> 01:16:40.860]   of that anxiety, of that emergent situation
[01:16:40.860 --> 01:16:42.420]   that the war cultivates.
[01:16:42.420 --> 01:16:45.780]   That's where I see the impact of it.
[01:16:45.780 --> 01:16:49.060]   And of course, the war also creates conditions
[01:16:49.060 --> 01:16:52.300]   where bright, talented, however you wanna,
[01:16:52.300 --> 01:16:53.580]   whatever adjective you wanna put it,
[01:16:53.580 --> 01:16:56.420]   individuals have an opportunity to distinguish.
[01:16:56.420 --> 01:17:00.180]   Now, for example, to go back to what you said
[01:17:00.180 --> 01:17:04.660]   about the war being this kind of great perjure,
[01:17:04.660 --> 01:17:08.500]   it certainly had a role in weeding out
[01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:11.700]   many officers in the French Corps.
[01:17:11.700 --> 01:17:15.820]   Some, many of them immigrated, left the army.
[01:17:15.820 --> 01:17:18.940]   Some of them failed in the tasks
[01:17:18.940 --> 01:17:22.180]   that revolutionary government set for them
[01:17:22.180 --> 01:17:25.620]   and were punished dearly so for it.
[01:17:25.620 --> 01:17:29.300]   We have several cases like General Cousteau
[01:17:29.300 --> 01:17:32.900]   or General Bournet and others who failed
[01:17:32.900 --> 01:17:35.260]   to achieve the mission that the government set for them
[01:17:35.260 --> 01:17:39.500]   and they were recalled and condemned and executed for it.
[01:17:39.500 --> 01:17:42.860]   And so it certainly creates this environment
[01:17:42.860 --> 01:17:47.260]   in which you have to deliver, you have to be at your best,
[01:17:47.260 --> 01:17:51.580]   or an environment in which people who are willing
[01:17:51.580 --> 01:17:54.660]   to take the risk are pushed forward.
[01:17:54.660 --> 01:17:56.220]   And that's, in many respects,
[01:17:56.220 --> 01:17:58.620]   how Napoleon got his start, right?
[01:17:58.620 --> 01:18:02.980]   In 1793, he's a lowly nobody in the French army
[01:18:02.980 --> 01:18:07.500]   and yet he's the one who is willing to take charge
[01:18:07.500 --> 01:18:10.620]   of artillery command in the town of Toulon,
[01:18:10.620 --> 01:18:12.020]   which is besieged by the army.
[01:18:12.020 --> 01:18:15.260]   He comes out with a plan that brings the city
[01:18:15.260 --> 01:18:20.220]   to its knees and the rest is history, right?
[01:18:20.220 --> 01:18:24.180]   And all is done within this war environment.
[01:18:24.180 --> 01:18:27.180]   Who knows how things would have turned
[01:18:27.180 --> 01:18:29.700]   if there was no war and whether Napoleon
[01:18:29.700 --> 01:18:31.940]   would have been able to distinguish himself
[01:18:31.940 --> 01:18:36.940]   or the other generals that went on to make great careers.
[01:18:36.940 --> 01:18:38.180]   - It seems that one of the reasons
[01:18:38.180 --> 01:18:42.980]   that the revolutionary and Napoleonic idea spread a lot
[01:18:42.980 --> 01:18:45.860]   was that also at the time that France was the seat
[01:18:45.860 --> 01:18:51.980]   of intellectual discourse at the time.
[01:18:51.980 --> 01:18:54.140]   Why was that?
[01:18:54.380 --> 01:18:57.820]   Maybe today, America has that sort of cultural influence
[01:18:57.820 --> 01:18:59.820]   that France had at the time.
[01:18:59.820 --> 01:19:01.660]   When you read like "War and Peace,"
[01:19:01.660 --> 01:19:04.100]   all the elites in Russia are talking in French.
[01:19:04.100 --> 01:19:08.260]   What gave France its cultural dominance at the time?
[01:19:08.260 --> 01:19:12.580]   - That's a longer kind of structural historical process.
[01:19:12.580 --> 01:19:17.580]   We can go back to 17th century and see the rise of dominant,
[01:19:17.580 --> 01:19:21.340]   France as a dominant, both political entity
[01:19:21.340 --> 01:19:23.540]   in Western Europe and the cultural kind of entity
[01:19:23.540 --> 01:19:24.940]   in Europe as a whole.
[01:19:24.940 --> 01:19:27.980]   I think it's a creation of Louis XIV's era,
[01:19:27.980 --> 01:19:30.700]   the grandeur of the French monarchy,
[01:19:30.700 --> 01:19:33.180]   the opulence, the luxury of it,
[01:19:33.180 --> 01:19:38.180]   the diversity and the richness of French offerings.
[01:19:38.180 --> 01:19:41.580]   And of course, this is where I think it gets
[01:19:41.580 --> 01:19:44.100]   really interesting in the sense that France
[01:19:44.100 --> 01:19:48.180]   is oftentimes envisioned as an absolutist monarchy
[01:19:48.180 --> 01:19:50.580]   with kind of tight controls and everything.
[01:19:50.580 --> 01:19:53.460]   But on the other hand, in the 18th century,
[01:19:53.460 --> 01:19:58.260]   we see a diverse range of opinions expressed within France
[01:19:58.260 --> 01:19:59.820]   by the French writers.
[01:19:59.820 --> 01:20:04.820]   On one hand, you can find anti-enlightenment writers,
[01:20:04.820 --> 01:20:08.460]   but alongside you will see Voltaire, you'll see Rousseau,
[01:20:08.460 --> 01:20:13.220]   or the less known ones like Holbach, who was an atheist,
[01:20:13.220 --> 01:20:16.460]   who was writing critical works against the organized
[01:20:16.460 --> 01:20:20.380]   religion and envisioning this technocratic utopias.
[01:20:20.380 --> 01:20:24.740]   So that is a unique circumstances that France
[01:20:24.740 --> 01:20:29.460]   was able to craft and cultivate that other countries
[01:20:29.460 --> 01:20:32.620]   were unable to replicate or were able to replicate
[01:20:32.620 --> 01:20:34.340]   to a lesser degree.
[01:20:34.340 --> 01:20:36.740]   I think the other country that was successful in doing it,
[01:20:36.740 --> 01:20:41.180]   of course, Britain, which had a very vibrant
[01:20:41.180 --> 01:20:44.420]   and rich intellectual life at this time.
[01:20:44.420 --> 01:20:46.620]   - I wanna respect for your time.
[01:20:46.620 --> 01:20:51.620]   So the book is "The Napoleonic Wars of Global History."
[01:20:51.620 --> 01:20:56.340]   And yeah, if you wanna mention your Twitter handle.
[01:20:56.340 --> 01:20:59.940]   - It's just, yeah, my first name and last name.
[01:20:59.940 --> 01:21:01.220]   So it's pretty straightforward.
[01:21:01.220 --> 01:21:05.460]   If you can spell my last name, you'll find me.
[01:21:05.460 --> 01:21:08.860]   - You know, when I was doing research for the book,
[01:21:08.860 --> 01:21:11.500]   there were many times when I had to like look up your,
[01:21:11.500 --> 01:21:13.420]   I was like, maybe trying to look up older interviews
[01:21:13.420 --> 01:21:15.500]   or something, and every time I had to go to Amazon
[01:21:15.500 --> 01:21:17.580]   and like make sure I copied the name right.
[01:21:17.580 --> 01:21:21.820]   - My students call me Dr. M, which made me a kind of
[01:21:21.820 --> 01:21:23.500]   character from the James Bond movie,
[01:21:23.500 --> 01:21:26.820]   but it's easier for them to recall, to remember it.
[01:21:26.820 --> 01:21:27.660]   - Sure.
[01:21:27.660 --> 01:21:31.660]   Yeah, and then, yeah, any other, I don't know if there's
[01:21:31.660 --> 01:21:34.340]   like some final note or some final point
[01:21:34.340 --> 01:21:37.780]   that you wanna close on, something that stuck out
[01:21:37.780 --> 01:21:38.620]   from the conversation or from the book.
[01:21:38.620 --> 01:21:42.340]   - No, I think, you know, this book represents
[01:21:42.340 --> 01:21:47.100]   kind of as a humble effort to showcase what history
[01:21:47.100 --> 01:21:49.660]   can do in modern context.
[01:21:49.660 --> 01:21:53.380]   And that is to move away from traditional boundaries,
[01:21:53.380 --> 01:21:57.900]   to adopt a more wider lens at looking events,
[01:21:57.900 --> 01:22:00.460]   more transnational, more comparative,
[01:22:00.460 --> 01:22:04.980]   that it's perfectly fine to do a national histories
[01:22:04.980 --> 01:22:07.820]   and to kind of look at the historical developments
[01:22:07.820 --> 01:22:09.740]   of particular country.
[01:22:09.740 --> 01:22:14.580]   But to me, it is far more rewarding to see how countries
[01:22:14.580 --> 01:22:16.340]   developed in relationship with each other,
[01:22:16.340 --> 01:22:20.820]   how events in one part of the world reverberates in another.
[01:22:20.820 --> 01:22:25.820]   Because the more, you know, in our day, nowadays,
[01:22:25.820 --> 01:22:29.540]   we live in such an interconnected world
[01:22:29.540 --> 01:22:32.180]   that that transnational and comparative approach
[01:22:32.180 --> 01:22:35.820]   is absolutely essential to your success in really
[01:22:35.820 --> 01:22:38.820]   in any field of career that you pursue.
[01:22:38.820 --> 01:22:43.740]   And certainly in politics, in business, in law.
[01:22:43.740 --> 01:22:48.740]   And so I encourage your listeners to pick up books
[01:22:48.740 --> 01:22:53.060]   like that, I think books written with the global history
[01:22:53.060 --> 01:22:58.060]   in mind and broaden their horizons.
[01:22:58.060 --> 01:22:59.620]   - From the little history I have read,
[01:22:59.620 --> 01:23:01.460]   usually it's like a biography or something.
[01:23:01.460 --> 01:23:04.580]   And you really do miss the global implications
[01:23:04.580 --> 01:23:06.540]   of the decisions that are being made
[01:23:06.540 --> 01:23:08.500]   and the changes that are happening.
[01:23:08.500 --> 01:23:13.500]   So it was super interesting to get that total perspective.
[01:23:13.500 --> 01:23:15.060]   - Thank you.
[01:23:15.060 --> 01:23:16.780]   - So yeah, it's a super fascinating book
[01:23:16.780 --> 01:23:18.140]   and this is a super fun conversation.

[01:23:19.660 --> 01:23:21.300]   - Thank you, I appreciate that.
