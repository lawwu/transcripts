[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.640]   - Kelly, a mom, writes in to ask this,
[00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.980]   "Pastor John, I'm wondering if you would speak
[00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.980]   "on the subject of dealing with rebellious children.
[00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.260]   "How do you keep trusting God when you see no evidence
[00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.520]   "of His working in a child's life?"
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.460]   - Well, this is exactly the right question to ask.
[00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.200]   How do we keep on trusting God?
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:30.200]   The crucial need for every parent is to trust God,
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:35.640]   to trust God that He has worked for us in Jesus
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.140]   to save us from our sins,
[00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.140]   to trust God that He will fulfill all of His promises
[00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.140]   to His children, to trust God that He will uphold us.
[00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.080]   Fear not, for I am with you.
[00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.620]   Be not dismayed, for I am your God.
[00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.360]   I will strengthen you, I'll help you, I'll uphold you,
[00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.500]   that He'll keep that promise.
[00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.060]   To trust God that He will withhold no good thing
[00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.900]   from those who walk uprightly,
[00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.800]   to trust God that He will give us only what is good for us
[00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.680]   and that all His ways are just and wise.
[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.680]   What our children need from us most is to see joyful,
[00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:22.020]   hopeful, peaceful, obedient, trusting God
[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.660]   and to keep trusting God in God.
[00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.620]   And the biblical answer to the question,
[00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.600]   how do we keep trusting God in this and every situation
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.600]   is surely given clearly, probably most clearly
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.140]   in Romans 10, 17.
[00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.540]   So faith comes from hearing
[00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.680]   and hearing through the word of Christ.
[00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.680]   And I think that means not just you get converted
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.920]   and get faith the first time by hearing Christ,
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.920]   but you get faith strengthened every day by hearing.
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.860]   Faith comes daily by hearing.
[00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.900]   Right now in this podcast,
[00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.240]   faith doesn't come from John Piper.
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.700]   Faith comes from John Piper's reading the Bible
[00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.980]   and applying the Bible, or it doesn't come at all.
[00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.980]   So let me give a few texts that would, I hope,
[00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.460]   strengthen our faith in respect to our children.
[00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:31.460]   Number one, it helps parents, I think,
[00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.820]   to realize, strange as it may sound,
[00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.660]   that God's own children rebel against Him.
[00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.340]   Isaiah 1, verse 2,
[00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.740]   "Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth,
[00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.240]   for the Lord has spoken, 'Children I have reared
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:52.240]   and brought up, but they have rebelled against me.'"
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.520]   God said that.
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.120]   "The ox knows its owner and the donkey its master's crib,
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.620]   but Israel does not know, my people do not understand."
[00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.760]   No parent on earth has ever been a sinless parent
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.060]   or a completely wise parent or a completely loving parent
[00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.440]   or a completely patient parent.
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.900]   The sins that we have committed as parents
[00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.380]   in the presence of our children
[00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.900]   and against our children are countless,
[00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.140]   and we must constantly repent and seek forgiveness,
[00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:27.140]   God and them, but even the very best parent,
[00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.100]   God Himself, has rebellious children.
[00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.820]   So don't let Satan load you down
[00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:40.440]   with faith-destroying guilt greater than you can bear
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.100]   or should bear, that's number one.
[00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.580]   Number two, remember that the apostle Paul
[00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:52.580]   gave himself as an example of the worst sinner,
[00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:57.240]   and that means not only that he did the worst things,
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.420]   but that he sinned against the greatest light.
[00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.620]   Goodness gracious, he grew up at the feet of Gamaliel,
[00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.620]   the best teacher of the Old Testament there was
[00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.140]   in those days, and he gave us this illustration
[00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.300]   to encourage us that none of us and none of our children
[00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.180]   is beyond conversion.
[00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.340]   So he wrote in 1 Timothy 1, 12,
[00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.740]   "I thank Him who has given me strength,
[00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:23.100]   Christ Jesus our Lord, because He judged me faithful,
[00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.220]   appointing me to His service, though formerly
[00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.740]   I was a blasphemer, persecutor, innocent,"
[00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.020]   I mean, insolent, not innocent, "insolent opponent,
[00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.560]   but I received mercy because I had acted
[00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.340]   ignorantly in unbelief, and the mercy of our Lord
[00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.220]   overflowed for me with faith and love
[00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:46.780]   that are in Christ Jesus.
[00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.620]   The saying is trustworthy, deserving of full acceptance
[00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.120]   that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners,
[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:57.120]   of whom I am the foremost, but I received mercy
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:02.640]   for this reason," and that's this podcast.
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:07.140]   "I received mercy for this reason, so that in me,
[00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:11.540]   as the foremost, Jesus Christ might display,
[00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:14.220]   through the lips of John Piper speaking right now,
[00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:18.420]   His perfect patience as an example to those
[00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:22.080]   who were to believe in Him for eternal life."
[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.960]   That means that all the people listening to me
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.060]   who know somebody, who are somebody,
[00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:30.260]   that have sinned so grievously, so long,
[00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:31.840]   grew up in such a wonderful home,
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.400]   and threw it away so often, are not beyond
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.960]   the power of the patience of Jesus to reach them.
[00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.480]   So we preach that to ourselves,
[00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:45.280]   and we strengthen our faith with that amazing statement
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.280]   of the Apostle Paul, and here's the third thing.
[00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:52.280]   "Meditate often on the truth that God is sovereign
[00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:55.600]   over the human heart, and therefore is able
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.960]   to put a camel through the eye of a needle,
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.760]   which is impossible," and I say that
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:05.020]   because when the rich man turned away from Jesus,
[00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:06.360]   because he was in love with the world,
[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.480]   and you may think that's who your kids are,
[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:11.760]   that's what they've done, they've turned away,
[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.720]   and they're in love with the world now.
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:18.300]   Well, Jesus says about him how difficult it is
[00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:21.100]   for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God,
[00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:23.360]   and the disciples were amazed, and they said,
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.160]   "Well, who then can be saved?"
[00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:31.660]   They were astonished, and Jesus responded in Mark 10, 27,
[00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:35.680]   "With man it is impossible,"
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.420]   and that's the way a lot of parents feel,
[00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:38.520]   and they shouldn't dwell on that,
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.460]   they should dwell on the next half.
[00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:44.180]   "With man it is impossible, but not with God,
[00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:47.540]   for all things are possible with God."
[00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:50.780]   So parents should preach, we should preach to ourselves
[00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:53.880]   over and over again, "With man it is impossible,
[00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:55.980]   but not with God, not with God.
[00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:58.220]   All things are possible with God,
[00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:00.740]   all things are possible with God,"
[00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:03.760]   and he's talking about getting a person
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:07.120]   who's in love with his riches or his worldliness
[00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:11.000]   into the kingdom of God, and he says, "I can do that,
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   I can do that, he can't, you can't, but I can, so trust me."
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.160]   And the fourth thing I would say is focus your attention
[00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:22.400]   on delighting yourself in the Lord,
[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:25.120]   not on delighting in the conversion of your children.
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:30.720]   Now, don't take this in the wrong way,
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:33.660]   it is right to delight in the conversion of your children,
[00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:35.540]   if you don't, something's deeply wrong,
[00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:37.280]   but I'm simply talking about
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:40.320]   what gets the focus in your life.
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.960]   I'm thinking, of course, of Psalm 37, four,
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:44.780]   "Delight yourself in the Lord,
[00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:47.780]   and he will give you the desires of your heart."
[00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:52.780]   Focus your spiritual energies on cultivating a robust,
[00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:58.040]   deep, unshakable, satisfying delight in God as God,
[00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:01.960]   and only then will we be in a position
[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:03.900]   to receive the rest of this verse.
[00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:06.660]   He'll give you the desires of your heart.
[00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:11.660]   And the last thing is let the longing, the aching,
[00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:15.600]   the praying, the weeping for your children,
[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:20.600]   let the longing that you feel for the conversion
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:23.540]   and the obedience of your children
[00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:28.540]   become the measure of your longing for other lost people.
[00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:31.400]   This has been a great lesson to me
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:35.820]   as I've raised children and how deeply I long for them
[00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:38.480]   to follow Christ, and then I wake up to realize
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:42.280]   I'm not longing for others quite that way,
[00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:44.240]   or even close to quite that way.
[00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:48.840]   So I've tried, and this is a convicting thing,
[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:53.840]   let God's good work of producing desire in your heart
[00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:56.240]   for the conversion of your children,
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:58.920]   let it produce a desire for the conversion
[00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:02.720]   of other lost people in your life as well.
[00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:06.360]   And then the last thing really is pray, pray, pray,
[00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:09.300]   because Jesus said, "Keep on knocking."
[00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:10.800]   He loves it when you knock.
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.420]   He will never grow weary of the prayers
[00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:17.200]   that you launch His way for your children.
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:20.080]   - That's very convicting as a dad, and beautiful.
[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:21.760]   Wonderful counsel, Pastor John, thank you.
[00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:24.120]   And Kelly, thank you for emailing us your question.
