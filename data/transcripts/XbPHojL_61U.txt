[00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:21.860]   Exactly. It goes back to that 11.5 quintillion times the bandwidth that humans have now arrived at and giving that to nature and seeing what happens there. Can animals actually use this interface
[00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:21.860]   and seeing what happens there?

[00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:22.040]   What happens is that, at some point,
[00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:26.240]   the templating strategies, and as you said correctly,
[00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:28.960]   there were geometrical templating, material templating,
[00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:31.140]   environmental templating, chemical templating,
[00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:34.840]   if you're using pheromones to guide the movement of bees,
[00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:37.720]   in the absence of a queen, where you have a robotic queen.
[00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:38.540]   - Uh-huh.
[00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:39.580]   - Robotic queen.
[00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:42.380]   - But whenever you have these templating strategies,
[00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:45.440]   you have sort of control over nature, right?
[00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:45.440]   But the question is, is there a way for nature
[00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:45.440]   to be able to control nature, right?
[00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:45.440]   But the question is, is there a way for nature

[00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:15.880]   Is there a world in which we can move from templating,
[00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:15.880]   from providing these computational material and immaterial physical and molecular platforms that guide nature, almost guiding a product almost like a gardener to a problem or an opportunity of emergence where that biological organism assumes agency by virtue of accessing the robotic code and saying, now I own the code, I get to do what I want with this code.

[00:31:50.300 --> 00:32:19.280]   gera crea this space of mutualism space of sort of shared connection between you and the organism. And with bees, it started as a synthetic apiary. And we have proven that that curated environment where we designed the space with high levels of control of temperature, humidity and light, and we've proven that they were reproductive and alive and realized, wow, this environment that we created can help
[00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:48.280]   We've proven that they were reproductive and alive and realized, wow, this environment can help
[00:32:48.300 --> 00:33:17.280]  obediently, we've proven that they were reproductive and alive and realized, wow, this environment can help with our tools and machines and we made it happen. And the neighbors were very happy and they got to get a ton of honey at the end of the winter. And those bees, of course, were released into the wild at the end of the winter alive and kicking. So then in order to actually experiment with the robotic queen and idea or concept, we had to prove obviously that we can create this space for bees. And then after that, we had this amazing opportunity to send the bees to space.
[00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:47.280]  , and we of course said yes, we'll take a slot. We said, okay, can we outdo NASA. So NASA in 1982 had an experiment where they sent bees to outer space. The bees returned, they were not reproductive. And some of them died and we thought, well, is there a way in which we can create a life support system, almost like a small mini bio lab of a queen and her mother and her baby.

[00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:04.000]   These incredible life forms are communicating using a different language than ours. We use language models, they use molecular models. It's a moment where we can parse, we can decode these molecular moments is when we can start having a conversation with plants. Now, of course, there is a lot of work around a plant neurobiology. It's a real thing. Plants do not have
[00:57:04.020 --> 00:57:34.020]   But they have something akin to a nervous system. It has a kind of a ecological intelligence that is focused on a particular time scale and the time scale is very, very slow, slow, slow, slow, slow time scale. So it is when we can melt these time scales and connect with these plants in terms of the content of the language, in this case, molecules, the duration of the language and we can start having a conversation with them.

[01:25:21.540 --> 01:25:44.820]  programmer: What role does imperfection play in our conception of beauty? What role does imperfection play in nature? There's a Japanese aesthetics concept of wabi-sabi which basically embraces imperfection. Nothing lasts, nothing is finished, and nothing is perfect. What do you think of that?
[01:25:44.820 --> 01:25:50.400]   I totally agree that change is the only permanence, that
[01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:51.100]   -
[01:25:51.100 --> 01:25:51.100]   - - -

[01:26:21.140 --> 01:26:51.140]  ,
[01:26:51.280 --> 01:27:21.160]   and to imperfection. So I think it is necessary for something beautiful to be imperfect and it is a sign of nature because nothing in nature is perfect.
[01:27:21.160 --> 01:27:21.160]   What about human relations? You mentioned finding love. Are the flaws in humans, imperfection in humans a component of love? Like what role do you think the flaws play?
[01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:21.200]  , - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - . the flaws are a sign of vulnerability, but the flaws are signs of the same. The
[01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:21.200]   is a sign of the same. The
[01:27:49.880 --> 01:27:49.900]   is a sign of the same. The
[01:27:49.900 --> 01:27:54.900]   of those vulnerabilities.
[01:27:54.900 --> 01:27:54.980]   of those vulnerabilities.
[01:27:54.980 --> 01:27:57.900]   of those vulnerabilities. And I think love is very,
[01:27:57.900 --> 01:27:57.960]   And I think love is very,
[01:27:57.960 --> 01:27:59.900]   And I think love is very, very gentle, right?
[01:27:59.900 --> 01:27:59.960]   very gentle, right?
[01:27:59.960 --> 01:28:01.900]   very gentle, right? Love, with Bill we often talk
[01:28:01.900 --> 01:28:01.960]   Love, with Bill we often talk
[01:28:01.960 --> 01:28:03.900]   Love, with Bill we often talk about between the two of us
[01:28:03.900 --> 01:28:03.960]   about between the two of us
[01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:05.900]   about between the two of us about what drives all human
[01:28:05.900 --> 01:28:05.960]   about what drives all human
[01:28:05.960 --> 01:28:06.900]   about what drives all human behavior.
[01:28:06.900 --> 01:28:06.960]   behavior.
[01:28:06.960 --> 01:28:08.900]   behavior. And for him it's incentive,
[01:28:08.900 --> 01:28:08.900]   And for him it's incentive,
[01:28:08.900 --> 01:28:10.900]   And for him it's incentive, as you might expect.
[01:28:10.900 --> 01:28:10.960]   as you might expect.
[01:28:10.960 --> 01:28:11.900]   as you might expect. And he will repeat this
[01:28:11.900 --> 01:28:11.960]   And he will repeat this
[01:28:11.960 --> 01:28:12.900]   And he will repeat this sentence to me, incentive drives
[01:28:13.700 --> 01:28:37.940]   sentence to me, incentive drives drives drives
[01:28:37.940 --> 01:28:38.940]   sentence to me, incentive drives drives all human behavior.
[01:28:38.940 --> 01:28:39.000]   all human behavior.
[01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:40.940]   all human behavior. But I would say to me it's
[01:28:40.940 --> 01:28:41.000]   But I would say to me it's
[01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:41.940]   But I would say to me it's love, very much so.
[01:28:41.940 --> 01:28:42.000]   love, very much so.
[01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:42.940]   love, very much so. And I think flaws are part of
[01:28:42.940 --> 01:28:42.940]   And I think flaws are part of that.
[01:28:42.940 --> 01:28:42.940]   And I think flaws are part of that. Because flaws are a sign of that vulnerability.
[01:28:42.940 --> 01:28:42.940]   Because flaws are a sign of that vulnerability.
[01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:46.980]   And vulnerability enables connection.
[01:28:46.980 --> 01:28:47.980]   And vulnerability enables connection. The connection is the glue.
[01:28:47.980 --> 01:28:47.980]   The connection is the glue.
[01:28:47.980 --> 01:28:49.980]   The connection is the glue. And that connection enables
[01:28:49.980 --> 01:28:49.980]   And that connection enables
[01:28:49.980 --> 01:28:51.980]   And that connection enables accessing a higher ground as a
[01:28:51.980 --> 01:28:52.020]   accessing a higher ground as a
[01:28:52.020 --> 01:28:53.980]   accessing a higher ground as a community as opposed to an
[01:28:53.980 --> 01:28:54.020]   community as opposed to an
[01:28:54.020 --> 01:28:54.980]   community as opposed to an individual.
[01:28:54.980 --> 01:28:55.040]   individual.
[01:28:55.040 --> 01:28:56.980]   individual. So if there is a society of the
[01:28:56.980 --> 01:28:57.020]   So if there is a society of the
[01:28:57.020 --> 01:28:58.980]   So if there is a society of the mind or if there are higher levels
[01:28:58.980 --> 01:28:59.040]   mind or if there are higher levels
[01:28:59.040 --> 01:29:01.980]   mind or if there are higher levels of awareness that can be accessed
[01:29:01.980 --> 01:29:02.020]   of awareness that can be accessed
[01:29:02.020 --> 01:29:04.980]   of awareness that can be accessed in community as opposed to,
[01:29:04.980 --> 01:29:05.020]   in community as opposed to,

[01:29:07.780 --> 01:29:32.020]  , again going to the silkworm,
[01:29:32.020 --> 01:29:33.020]   again going to the silkworm, and that is the way that we
[01:29:33.020 --> 01:29:33.080]   and that is the way that we
[01:29:33.080 --> 01:29:34.020]   and that is the way that we can connect with each other.
[01:29:34.020 --> 01:29:34.020]   can connect with each other.
[01:29:34.020 --> 01:29:35.020]   can connect with each other. And that is the way that we
[01:29:35.020 --> 01:29:35.020]   And that is the way that we
[01:29:35.020 --> 01:29:36.020]   And that is the way that we can connect with each other.
[01:29:36.020 --> 01:29:36.020]   can connect with each other.
[01:29:36.020 --> 01:29:37.020]   can connect with each other. And that is the way that we

[01:29:37.020 --> 01:29:37.020]   And that is the way that we can connect with each other. And that is the way that we can connect with each other.
[01:29:37.040 --> 01:29:46.060]   Maybe love is the leap into that vulnerability.
[01:29:46.060 --> 01:29:47.060]   Maybe love is the leap into that vulnerability.
[01:29:47.060 --> 01:29:48.060]   Maybe love is the leap into that vulnerability. And I think yes.
[01:29:48.060 --> 01:29:48.060]   And I think yes.
[01:29:48.060 --> 01:29:49.060]   And I think yes. I think a flaw, think about it,
[01:29:49.060 --> 01:29:49.100]   I think a flaw, think about it,
[01:29:49.100 --> 01:29:51.060]   I think a flaw, think about it, like physically, I'm thinking about
[01:29:51.060 --> 01:29:51.100]   like physically, I'm thinking about
[01:29:51.100 --> 01:29:52.060]   like physically, I'm thinking about a brick that's flawed.
[01:29:52.060 --> 01:29:52.060]   a brick that's flawed.
[01:29:52.060 --> 01:29:55.060]   a brick that's flawed. But in a way the, the,
[01:29:55.060 --> 01:29:56.060]   But in a way the, the, the, the, the, the, I think of a flaw is an
[01:29:56.060 --> 01:29:57.060]   I think of a flaw is an increased surface area.
[01:29:57.060 --> 01:29:57.060]   I think of a flaw is an increased surface area.
[01:29:57.060 --> 01:29:58.060]   I think of a flaw is an increased surface area.
[01:29:58.060 --> 01:30:01.060]   God, that's a good line.
[01:30:01.100 --> 01:30:26.100]   God, that's a good line.
[01:30:26.100 --> 01:30:27.100]   God, that's a good line.
[01:30:27.100 --> 01:30:28.100]   Right, a surface area that's
[01:30:28.100 --> 01:30:29.100]   Right, a surface area that's
[01:30:29.100 --> 01:30:30.100]   Right, a surface area that's physically or emotionally,
[01:30:30.100 --> 01:30:30.100]   physically or emotionally,
[01:30:30.100 --> 01:30:31.100]   Right, a surface area that's physically or emotionally, right?
[01:30:31.100 --> 01:30:31.100]   Right, a surface area that's physically or emotionally, right?
[01:30:31.100 --> 01:30:31.100]   Right, a surface area that's physically or emotionally, right?
[01:30:31.100 --> 01:30:31.100]   Right, a surface area that's physically or emotionally, right?
[01:30:31.100 --> 01:30:31.100]   I think of it as accessing this additional dimension of surface area that could be used for good or bad, right? To connect, to communicate, to collaborate, to collaborate.
[01:30:31.120 --> 01:30:37.140]   It makes me think of that quote from this incredible movie I've watched years ago.
