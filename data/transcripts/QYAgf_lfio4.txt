[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.660]   where we discuss science
[00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:05.900]   and science-based tools for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.280]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.380]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.440]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.780]   My guest today is Dr. Ellen Langer.
[00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.080]   Dr. Ellen Langer is a professor of psychology
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.400]   at Harvard University,
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.320]   and one of the world's leading pioneers
[00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.200]   in the mind-body connection.
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.560]   More specifically, how our thoughts impact our health.
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.000]   Dr. Ellen Langer was one of the first people
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.560]   to systematically explore the mind-body connection
[00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:34.840]   with scientific rigor.
[00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.480]   Her laboratories made a large number
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.000]   of truly fascinating findings.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.060]   For instance, today you'll learn about a study
[00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:42.480]   that Dr. Langer did,
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.640]   in which she brought quite old people into her laboratory,
[00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.720]   or rather she designed a laboratory
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.760]   such that people lived in this laboratory,
[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.200]   but the laboratory itself was designed
[00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.920]   to resemble the environment,
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.880]   everything from the types of furniture,
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.660]   the types of dishes, the types of music, et cetera,
[00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.760]   that those people had lived in 20 years prior.
[00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.520]   When those subjects lived in that laboratory
[00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:06.300]   for less than one week,
[00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.640]   the change in the environment
[00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.920]   and their interaction with that environment
[00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.760]   led them to have far more mobility,
[00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.280]   better cognitive function,
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.360]   and a large number of other markers
[00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.360]   of biological aging reversed,
[00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.040]   which is absolutely remarkable
[00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.920]   and speaks to the incredible power
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.440]   that the mind has over our biology.
[00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.460]   That's just one example of the sorts of experiments
[00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.040]   that Dr. Langer has done, again,
[00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.140]   with a tremendous amount of scientific rigor.
[00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.920]   So today Dr. Langer and I talk about
[00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.760]   how the acquisition of knowledge,
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.680]   just simply learning about certain biological mechanisms,
[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.280]   as well as your mindset about various aspects
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.880]   of your health and wellbeing,
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.180]   can powerfully dictate your health and wellbeing.
[00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.680]   We talk about longevity,
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.880]   we talk about exercise and weight loss,
[00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.540]   we talk about infectious disease.
[00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.960]   In fact, we also talk about how mindset
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.000]   can impact cancer outcomes,
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.160]   or rather overcoming cancer.
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.380]   We discuss examples, mechanisms,
[00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.580]   and practical application of those mechanisms.
[00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.440]   By the end of today's episode,
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.480]   I assure you that Dr. Ellen Langer
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.040]   will change the way that you think
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.460]   about the mind-body connection,
[00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.280]   the way you think about your health,
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.740]   and I assure you it's not all just about positive thinking.
[00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.160]   In fact, Dr. Ellen Langer gets us to think differently
[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.760]   about scientific questions, our health,
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.280]   and just about everything else in the world.
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.840]   You'll soon see she has a quite unique way of thinking,
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.600]   not just about science and health,
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.680]   but also about life in general,
[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.920]   and what makes for a truly good life.
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.240]   Dr. Ellen Langer is a true luminary and pioneer
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.240]   in this area of mind-body health,
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.500]   and she's a fabulous teacher as well.
[00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.340]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.000]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.120]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.140]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.880]   about science and science-related tools
[00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.240]   to the general public.
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.520]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.880]   this episode does include sponsors.
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.040]   And now for my discussion with Dr. Ellen Langer.
[00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.200]   Dr. Ellen Langer, welcome.
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.360]   - Thank you, Andrew.
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.480]   - So great to have you here.
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.440]   There's so many topics that you've worked on
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.700]   and shed light on that impact our daily lives
[00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.440]   and our internal world and our external world
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.680]   and how they interact.
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.940]   I want to know your definition of mindfulness,
[00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.360]   and it could take on practical forms, theoretical forms.
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.240]   - I'll make it very simple.
[00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.160]   When most people hear the word mindful,
[00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.400]   sadly, they think of meditation.
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.720]   Meditation is great, but it's not mindful.
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.400]   You meditate in order to result
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.600]   in post-meditative mindfulness, okay?
[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:36.960]   So it's a practice.
[00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.560]   Mindfulness, as I study it, is a way of being.
[00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.000]   It's not a practice.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.680]   It's the simple process of noticing.
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.440]   Now, you can get there in one of two ways.
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.680]   Bottom up, actively notice three new things
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.880]   about the person you live with.
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.240]   Walk outside, notice three new things.
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.680]   Each time you do this, you see that you didn't know
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:58.840]   the thing you thought you knew
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.760]   as well as you thought you knew it.
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.440]   But you can also do it top down.
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.440]   Top down is recognize that everything is always changing.
[00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.400]   Everything looks different from different perspectives.
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.040]   Uncertainty is the rule.
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.760]   It's not the exception.
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.280]   So when you know you don't know, then you naturally tune in.
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.560]   So one of the things, I've said this so many times,
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.800]   maybe this will be the last,
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.640]   one of the things we think we know best
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.600]   is how much is one plus one, Andrew?
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.080]   - I'm gonna assume it's still two.
[00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.920]   - Two.
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.080]   Not always.
[00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.960]   If you add one watt of chewing gum
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.480]   to one watt of chewing gum, one plus one is one.
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.600]   You add one cloud to one cloud, one plus one is one.
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.000]   This is interesting.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.720]   Somebody sent this to me the other day.
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.960]   You take one pizza and you add one pizza,
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.400]   one plus one is two.
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.840]   You take one lasagna and you add one lasagna,
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:50.960]   one plus one is one.
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.320]   It's just a bigger lasagna, right?
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.360]   You take one puddle and you add,
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.920]   let's say I have two puddles there,
[00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.080]   and you add some water in between.
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.760]   Now you have one plus one plus one is one.
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.920]   Okay, so the point of it is that in the real world,
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.560]   one plus one probably doesn't equal two
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.040]   as I'm more often as it does.
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.800]   And since you're an educated individual,
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.080]   you might know that one plus one equals two
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.560]   if you're using a base 10 number system.
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.400]   If you're using a base two number system,
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.960]   one plus one is written as 10.
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.200]   Oh my goodness.
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.760]   Somebody asks you how much is one plus one?
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.560]   Should you say one, two, 10?
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:35.320]   And the point is that when you know you don't know,
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:36.800]   then you pay attention.
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.640]   In this context, let me see.
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.020]   I'll be a smart ass and I'll say one.
[00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.960]   Or in this context, I know the person wants me
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:48.840]   to be obedient and I'll say two, so on and so forth.
[00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.360]   So when you don't know, you pay attention.
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.520]   When you pay attention, you have choices
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.560]   that otherwise you're blind to.
[00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:58.920]   It makes a very big difference.
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.560]   So when you're mindful, you don't know,
[00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.280]   you actively notice.
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.960]   As you're noticing, the neurons are firing,
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.160]   and 50 years of research has shown
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.560]   that it's literally and figuratively enlightening.
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.540]   And if you're gonna do something, show up for it.
[00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:17.600]   Now the problem is that most people are mindless
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:21.000]   almost all the time and they're totally oblivious to it.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.760]   When you're not there, you're not there
[00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.600]   to know you're not there.
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.780]   And most people are just not there.
[00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:29.240]   Now you wanna ask me how does that happen?
[00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.280]   Well, we're taught that.
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.880]   Schools, I think, are the biggest culprits.
[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:36.360]   Schools are teaching us absolute answers.
[00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.120]   One plus one is two.
[00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.480]   Virtually everything that we're taught
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:44.920]   is as if the world is constant and going to stay that way.
[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.480]   And the answer today is going to be
[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.320]   the same answer as tomorrow.
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:53.220]   And so that certainty leads us not to notice.
[00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:55.880]   How did you come to realize this thing
[00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:58.040]   that we call mindfulness?
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:01.600]   I mean, certainly in the last 20 years,
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.000]   the notion of meditation as a valuable practice
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.800]   has become pretty common.
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.200]   Sure.
[00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:11.200]   And prior to that, it was considered a little bit
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.560]   alternative hippie-dibbie.
[00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:14.400]   Let me answer it.
[00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.800]   Okay, so it's very funny.
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:20.120]   I'm glad in some ways I don't remember who this person was,
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:23.040]   but I started studying mindlessness
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:25.920]   and I found myself, I'd walk into a mannequin,
[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:28.800]   I'd apologize, you know, all sorts of things like that.
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.480]   And I'd say, well, this is kind of interesting to me.
[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:33.320]   I'm speaking to somebody,
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.380]   we don't know who it was anymore,
[00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:37.760]   who said to me, you know, you are what you study.
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:38.600]   I said, okay.
[00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:39.440]   So then I switched it around
[00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.560]   from being mindless to being mindful.
[00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:46.120]   At that point, then I found out about meditation
[00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:48.160]   and Buddhism and all of this
[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:51.380]   and started to learn about another way of being.
[00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:54.280]   What was exciting to me was that
[00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:57.800]   I had gotten through this Western scientific mold,
[00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:02.400]   so to speak, to many of the same consequences
[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:05.860]   as the Buddhists had talked about for thousands of years.
[00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:11.500]   - It's interesting how now in Western society,
[00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:13.640]   we embrace this idea of presence,
[00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:17.820]   but it gets merged with these kind of more rigid terms
[00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:19.860]   like focus and attention.
[00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:23.780]   - Yeah, and a focus is actually mindless, you know.
[00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:26.840]   So it's interesting, focus on your finger.
[00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:30.500]   Now, if you're concentrating, focusing,
[00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:34.340]   what you're gonna notice is that your fingers,
[00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:37.860]   the image is moving around, right?
[00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:41.540]   And so when we try to hold something still,
[00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:42.380]   that's the wrong thing.
[00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:43.720]   You shouldn't tell people to focus.
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:47.300]   Now, instead of focus, look at your finger mindfully.
[00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:48.740]   That means you're gonna notice new things.
[00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:50.220]   That's an ugly little finger,
[00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:51.900]   and what is that line there?
[00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:53.360]   Why is this red?
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:54.420]   And when you're doing that,
[00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:59.100]   when you're actively noticing, the image stays still.
[00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:04.020]   So when we give people instructions in school in focus,
[00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:06.460]   they think as a camera, hold it still.
[00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:08.380]   And whenever we're trying to hold ourselves,
[00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:10.300]   the image, anything still,
[00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:13.020]   we're going to be performing sub-optimally.
[00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:15.620]   Need to let things vary.
[00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:17.420]   Things are always changing.
[00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:21.940]   So what happens is we confuse the stability of our mindsets,
[00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:24.140]   we're holding something still in our heads,
[00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:27.260]   with the stability of the underlying phenomena.
[00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.260]   - So mindfulness as a practice of exploration,
[00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:31.740]   presence and exploration,
[00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:34.860]   is perhaps a slightly better, perhaps,
[00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:35.700]   way to think about it?
[00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:36.540]   - Yeah, but it's not a practice.
[00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:41.060]   You see, once you accept that everything is uncertain,
[00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:43.340]   then you just tune in.
[00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:46.020]   You only don't tune in when you think you know.
[00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:50.300]   So if you were gonna come visit me in Cambridge,
[00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:51.640]   you've never been to my house,
[00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:52.860]   you don't have to practice anything.
[00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:55.060]   You walk in, you'll notice things.
[00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:55.980]   Did she do that painting?
[00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:57.780]   What is that?
[00:09:57.780 --> 00:09:59.140]   Oh, look what she's reading.
[00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:00.340]   - There's two dogs here.
[00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:01.940]   - Exactly, exactly.
[00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:05.100]   You'll notice without having to do any work.
[00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:06.380]   And that's the important thing,
[00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:08.740]   because in the way I keep differentiating
[00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:12.280]   mindfulness as I study it with meditation,
[00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:14.100]   meditation is a practice.
[00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:18.140]   For some people to sit still 20 minutes twice a day is work.
[00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:20.100]   Mindfulness, as I study it,
[00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:22.220]   is what you're doing when you're having fun.
[00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:25.860]   You can't have fun unless you're actively noticing.
[00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:30.180]   So in fact, this act of noticing
[00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:34.020]   is energy begetting, not consuming.
[00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:35.860]   So it feels good.
[00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:37.340]   It's the essence of what you're doing
[00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:39.060]   when you're having the most fun.
[00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:41.980]   It's good for you, and it's so easy
[00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:46.980]   that I can't see any reason why anybody wouldn't embrace it.
[00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:52.460]   That it's good for you.
[00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:53.620]   When you're mindful,
[00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:56.620]   people find you more appealing, charismatic.
[00:10:56.620 --> 00:11:00.440]   When you're mindful, the products you produce are enhanced,
[00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:03.620]   and it's healthier.
[00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:04.820]   I'd like to take a quick break
[00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:07.180]   and acknowledge our sponsor, BetterHelp.
[00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:08.940]   BetterHelp offers professional therapy
[00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:12.620]   with a licensed therapist carried out entirely online.
[00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:14.460]   Now, I personally have been doing therapy weekly
[00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:16.060]   for well over 30 years.
[00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:17.340]   Initially, I didn't have a choice.
[00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:19.700]   It was a condition of being allowed to stay in school,
[00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:20.740]   but pretty soon I realized
[00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:22.960]   that therapy is an extremely important component
[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:24.460]   to one's overall health.
[00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:26.300]   In fact, I consider doing regular therapy
[00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:28.700]   just as important as getting regular exercise,
[00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:30.780]   which of course I also do every week.
[00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:31.980]   There are essentially three things
[00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:33.140]   that great therapy provides.
[00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:35.780]   First of all, it provides a good rapport with somebody
[00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:37.340]   that you can trust and talk to
[00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:39.020]   about pretty much any issue with.
[00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:41.060]   Second of all, it can provide support
[00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:44.100]   in the form of emotional support and directed guidance.
[00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:47.380]   And third, expert therapy can provide useful insights,
[00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:48.900]   insights that allow you to better
[00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:51.500]   not just your emotional life and your relationship life,
[00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:53.820]   but of course, also the relationship to yourself
[00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:56.620]   and your professional life and to all sorts of goals.
[00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:59.180]   BetterHelp makes it very easy to find an expert therapist
[00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:00.380]   with whom you resonate with,
[00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:02.380]   and that can provide you those three benefits
[00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:03.980]   that come from effective therapy.
[00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:05.860]   Also, because BetterHelp allows for therapy
[00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:07.740]   to be done entirely online,
[00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:08.900]   it's super time-efficient
[00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:10.980]   and easy to fit into a busy schedule.
[00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:12.300]   If you'd like to try BetterHelp,
[00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:15.300]   you can go to betterhelp.com/huberman
[00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:17.180]   to get 10% off your first month.
[00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:20.380]   Again, that's betterhelp.com/huberman.
[00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:23.300]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep.
[00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:25.040]   Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:27.700]   that are customized to your unique sleep needs.
[00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:29.140]   Now, I've spoken many times before
[00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:31.620]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast and elsewhere
[00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:33.460]   about the fact that getting a great night's sleep
[00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:35.020]   is the foundation of mental health,
[00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:36.560]   physical health, and performance.
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:39.180]   Now, the mattress you sleep on makes a huge difference
[00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:41.500]   in terms of the quality of sleep that you get each night,
[00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:43.980]   how soft it is, how firm it is, how breathable it is,
[00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:46.220]   the temperature, all play into your comfort
[00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:49.020]   and needs to be tailored to your unique sleep needs.
[00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:50.500]   If you go to the Helix website,
[00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:51.780]   you'll take a brief two-minute quiz
[00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:53.620]   and it will ask you questions such as,
[00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:55.780]   do you tend to sleep on your back, your side of your stomach?
[00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:57.500]   It will also ask you, do you tend to run hot
[00:12:57.500 --> 00:12:58.380]   or cold during the night
[00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:00.380]   or the early part of the night, et cetera,
[00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:01.820]   things of that sort.
[00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:03.540]   Maybe you know the answers to those questions,
[00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:05.220]   maybe you don't, but either way,
[00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:08.120]   Helix will match you to the ideal mattress for you.
[00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:10.980]   For me, that turned out to be the Dusk mattress, D-U-S-K.
[00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:12.660]   I started sleeping on the Dusk mattress
[00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:14.060]   about three and a half years ago,
[00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:17.200]   and it's been far and away the best sleep that I've ever had.
[00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:19.140]   It's absolutely clear to me that having a mattress
[00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:22.160]   that's right for you does improve one's sleep.
[00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:23.380]   If you'd like to try Helix,
[00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:26.260]   you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman,
[00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:27.780]   take that two-minute sleep quiz,
[00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:29.460]   and Helix will match you to a mattress
[00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:32.060]   that is customized for your unique sleep needs.
[00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:35.940]   Right now, Helix is giving up to 25% off all mattress orders.
[00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:40.940]   Again, that's helixsleep.com/huberman to get up to 25% off.
[00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:43.100]   I think for a lot of people,
[00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:48.100]   a practice of meditation feels like the best
[00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:52.340]   or most obvious gateway
[00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:54.500]   into this thing that we're calling mindfulness.
[00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:56.620]   It's one way, and I'm not demeaning,
[00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:59.620]   I did some research in the '80s on meditation.
[00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:02.380]   It's wonderful, it's just different.
[00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:05.620]   And they're not mutually exclusive, you can do both.
[00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:09.940]   And part of the advantage of meditating
[00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:13.100]   possibly has nothing to do with the meditation.
[00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:14.260]   Why are you gonna meditate?
[00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.740]   You say you wanna be a kinder, nicer person.
[00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:18.460]   You can just be kinder or nicer,
[00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:20.460]   but now if you're gonna go to this trouble,
[00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:24.100]   20 minutes twice a day, you're gonna sit up and take notice
[00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:26.100]   and be a kinder, nicer person.
[00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:27.820]   So maybe it's the time investment
[00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:30.220]   as opposed to something specific
[00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:32.060]   about the meditation practice.
[00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:36.420]   That's a heretical idea in the world of wellness.
[00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:37.260]   But of course-
[00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.380]   But they're not mutually exclusive.
[00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:43.940]   So I'm not denying some of the more inherent properties,
[00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:47.500]   let's say, but there's this other piece to it.
[00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:49.060]   I love the way that you look at things
[00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:51.940]   that we take for granted as operating one way
[00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:54.260]   through this different perspective.
[00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.860]   Our mutual friend, Allie Crump, told me the story
[00:14:56.860 --> 00:15:00.740]   that at one point she was in a conversation with you
[00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:02.500]   and you said, well, maybe exercise
[00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:05.820]   and all its effects on our health is just an epiphenomenon.
[00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:07.340]   Could you talk a little bit more about that?
[00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:09.180]   I think, first of all, I don't think most people
[00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:11.780]   are familiar with what epiphenomena are,
[00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:13.660]   but this idea of looking at things
[00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:16.660]   through a different portal seems so valuable
[00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:19.140]   regardless of what the experimental outcome turned out to be.
[00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:21.420]   And perhaps we should touch on that experimental outcome
[00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:25.540]   about labor versus non-labor.
[00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:27.700]   - There's so much there.
[00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:29.660]   I don't know where to go.
[00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:32.420]   I mean, we wanna talk about that, the research.
[00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:33.500]   - Let's talk about the study.
[00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:35.300]   - But before we go to the study,
[00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:38.940]   let's go to the reason for the study, way back when.
[00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:43.940]   All right, so there's so many paths I can take here.
[00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:44.980]   - Let's take them all.
[00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:46.340]   - Okay, we'll start with one.
[00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:49.460]   So I did some research back in the '70s
[00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:51.900]   with people in nursing homes.
[00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:53.220]   And why did I do that?
[00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:55.820]   Because I had somebody in the family
[00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:56.860]   who was in a nursing home.
[00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:59.140]   It was very distressing to see people
[00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:04.140]   just sitting there doing nothing and barely existing.
[00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:08.460]   And so we had the idea that if we gave people choices
[00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:12.780]   that might get them more engaged in their living.
[00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:13.740]   And so we did that.
[00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:18.700]   We gave people encouragement to decide where to see people,
[00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:21.180]   whether to visit them in your room, in the lounge.
[00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:22.180]   You have to remember,
[00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:25.260]   you can't go into an establishment, a business,
[00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:27.340]   and turn the whole power structure around.
[00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:29.700]   But so within reason,
[00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:32.060]   we came up with choices people could make.
[00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:34.620]   We gave them an opportunity to see a movie.
[00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:36.820]   You could see it on Tuesday or Thursday.
[00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:39.380]   We gave them a plant to take care of.
[00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:41.140]   All right, so comparison group,
[00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:43.500]   the tender, loving care group,
[00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:46.100]   we told them people will be visiting you
[00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:50.900]   and we'll set it up so you'll be visiting in the lounge.
[00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:52.300]   Everything was controlled in that way.
[00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:55.300]   You can see a movie and we'll let you know
[00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:57.580]   if you're gonna see it on Tuesday or Thursday.
[00:16:57.580 --> 00:17:02.180]   Here's a plant and the nurses will care for it for you.
[00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:04.820]   All right, so we do this.
[00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:09.100]   We come back, I think it was three weeks.
[00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:10.100]   Actually, I don't remember.
[00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:11.900]   It's been so long.
[00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:14.780]   18 months later, first we took initial measures.
[00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:16.540]   Come back 18 months later,
[00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:21.540]   those people who were given these choices live longer.
[00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:29.500]   And that was the beginning of all of my work
[00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:31.340]   on health in some sense.
[00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:35.260]   How could it be that making choices
[00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:38.180]   results in a longer life?
[00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:40.580]   All right, so what is there about choice-making?
[00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:44.220]   And then the choices were Mickey Mouse choices.
[00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:48.140]   You can, you always have choice available too.
[00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:49.580]   You can turn on a light switch.
[00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:51.700]   You can do it with your right hand,
[00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:53.460]   your right hand, your left hand,
[00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:56.340]   one finger, three fingers, lift your foot.
[00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:59.420]   So many choices that you can bring to the table.
[00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:01.220]   If choice-making is good for you,
[00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:03.260]   why don't people do this?
[00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:07.460]   And that got me more into the mindlessness
[00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:08.940]   and mindfulness work now.
[00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:11.980]   Okay, so we have people living longer.
[00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:15.540]   How can it be that you're making choices,
[00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:20.540]   your mind is active and your body complies?
[00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:24.500]   And so then I thought about it, not in one fell swoop,
[00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:30.020]   but realized that this whole notion of mind and body,
[00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:31.620]   these are just words.
[00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:35.140]   We come together, here I am, all of me,
[00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:40.140]   my fingers, my shoulders, my thoughts as one thing.
[00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:44.100]   And if we put the mind and body back together,
[00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:48.420]   then the amount of control we have is enormous, right?
[00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:52.300]   Wherever I put my mind, I'm also putting my body.
[00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:56.860]   So in the "Mindful Body," which started off as a memoir,
[00:18:56.860 --> 00:19:01.380]   I have lots of stories that show leading up to this idea.
[00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:03.780]   Let me just tell you two very quickly.
[00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:05.420]   One was I got married.
[00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:06.420]   Andrew, you won't believe it.
[00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:08.740]   I was obscenely young.
[00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:10.580]   And you'll find that if you read the book,
[00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:13.140]   I was even younger then, admitted,
[00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:15.740]   'cause I was secretly married years before that.
[00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:18.100]   Okay, so I go, I'm 19 years old, I think.
[00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:21.060]   I go to Paris on my honeymoon.
[00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:24.300]   We go into this restaurant, I order a mixed grill.
[00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:27.100]   One of the foods there was a pancreas.
[00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:29.820]   My then husband, who was more sophisticated than I,
[00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:32.300]   more worldly, I said, "Which of these is the pancreas?"
[00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:33.340]   He says, "That."
[00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:35.980]   I said, "So I eat everything, I'm a big eater."
[00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:38.340]   Now comes the moment of truth.
[00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:40.300]   Can I eat the pancreas?
[00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:42.980]   Why I thought that being married meant
[00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:45.860]   I had to eat the pancreas, I still haven't figured out.
[00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:50.060]   But anyway, I start eating it, and he starts laughing.
[00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:51.860]   Not good for newlyweds.
[00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:53.940]   And I ask him, "Why are you laughing?"
[00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:55.620]   He said, "'Cause that's chicken.
[00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:58.260]   "You ate the pancreas a long time ago."
[00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:01.940]   So I made myself sick, okay.
[00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:05.340]   The other side of that, my mother had breast cancer
[00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:08.620]   that had metastasized to her pancreas.
[00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:11.460]   And then magically, it was gone.
[00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:14.940]   Somehow, she had made herself well.
[00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:17.220]   So I had many of these sorts of experiences.
[00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:21.420]   And talk about mind, I've been talking about this since,
[00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:25.820]   gosh, when did we first, since '79.
[00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:28.900]   So now people are talking about mind-body connection.
[00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:30.900]   It's not a connection.
[00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:33.780]   If you're talking about a connection between two things
[00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:36.740]   that says they're separate, and you still have to deal with
[00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:39.500]   what's connecting them, and you've put them back together,
[00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:44.500]   it's one thing, you don't have to deal with that mediator.
[00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:48.340]   And so the study you're asking me about,
[00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:50.940]   which I'm surprised, I'm having a junior moment,
[00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:53.660]   but I actually remembered the question you asked,
[00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:55.300]   rather than a senior moment,
[00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:59.660]   that before I tell you about the study with Allie,
[00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:03.420]   the first study we did testing this mind-body unity
[00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:05.500]   was a counterclockwise study.
[00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:07.940]   So here what we did was we took elderly men,
[00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:10.100]   we were going to have them live in a retreat
[00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:12.940]   that had been retrofitted to 20 years earlier,
[00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:15.940]   and had them live there as if they were their younger selves.
[00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:17.900]   So they talked about things from the past
[00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:20.020]   as if they were just unfolding.
[00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:21.980]   The results were incredible.
[00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:24.660]   Their vision improved, their hearing improved,
[00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:26.060]   their memory, their strength,
[00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:28.260]   and they looked noticeably younger.
[00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:30.660]   So that was very exciting,
[00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:33.980]   and began all this mind-body unity work.
[00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:37.000]   Now comes the study that you're talking about with Allie,
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:42.660]   where in the conversation that she and I had,
[00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:44.000]   she was my student,
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.860]   and she made proclamations about exercise,
[00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:49.580]   and any proclamation,
[00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:51.660]   this is the short answer to your question,
[00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:54.340]   anybody proclaims anything, my mind immediately goes,
[00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:56.180]   so when might not that be true?
[00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:57.780]   I'm starting to pick up on that.
[00:21:57.780 --> 00:22:00.300]   It's a gimmick, I guess.
[00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:02.980]   It's a gift, is what it is, yeah.
[00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:07.980]   And so the question was that how important
[00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:11.940]   was the understanding of exercise
[00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:13.920]   to the effects of exercise?
[00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:15.660]   So we take chambermaids,
[00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:18.340]   and interestingly, the first question we ask
[00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:20.340]   is how much exercise do you get?
[00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:22.740]   And they say they don't get very much exercise
[00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:26.660]   because to them, exercise is what you do after work,
[00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:28.020]   'cause that's what the Surgeon General
[00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:30.020]   who sits behind a desk all day says.
[00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:33.900]   So you would imagine whether they realized
[00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:35.740]   they were getting exercise or not,
[00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:38.340]   since they're getting so much exercise,
[00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:40.740]   that they're going to be healthier than other people
[00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:42.860]   who are not getting them, and they weren't.
[00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:43.700]   That's interesting.
[00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:47.380]   So now we divide them into two groups, very simple study.
[00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:49.140]   Randomly divide them into two groups.
[00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:52.740]   In one group, we simply teach them their work is exercise.
[00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:56.720]   Making a bed is like working in this machine at the gym,
[00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:58.940]   doing the windows, whatever.
[00:22:58.940 --> 00:22:59.760]   So you have two groups,
[00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:02.080]   one who thinks their work is exercise,
[00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:03.720]   one who doesn't realize.
[00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:07.540]   We take many, many measures,
[00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:09.980]   and they're not eating any differently,
[00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:11.460]   one group from the other.
[00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:13.580]   They're not working any harder.
[00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:16.740]   Nevertheless, the group that changed their mind
[00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:20.060]   and now saw their work as exercise lost weight,
[00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:22.300]   there was a change in waist to hip ratio,
[00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:25.580]   body mass index, and their blood pressure came down.
[00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:26.420]   Remarkable.
[00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:27.460]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:30.460]   And what I don't usually talk about
[00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:31.940]   when I start talking about this
[00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:35.380]   is that this was a test of the nocebo effect.
[00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:37.420]   Most people know what a placebo is.
[00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:39.340]   You take something that's nothing,
[00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:41.380]   and it has the effect as if it's something.
[00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:44.820]   You take a sugar pill thinking it's strong medication,
[00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:47.700]   and it plays out as if it was.
[00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:49.140]   A nocebo is the reverse.
[00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:50.900]   You're taking something,
[00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:52.860]   so here you're doing the exercise,
[00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:54.500]   but you don't realize it,
[00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:56.700]   and it gets rid of the effect.
[00:23:56.700 --> 00:23:59.420]   An early study on this was,
[00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:00.260]   I don't remember who did it,
[00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:02.660]   and that was a senior moment,
[00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:04.620]   people were given Ipecac,
[00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:06.740]   and Ipecac is supposed to make you vomit.
[00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:09.820]   So if you accidentally had poison or whatever,
[00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:11.620]   you'd take Ipecac and vomit.
[00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:13.540]   So people are given Ipecac.
[00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:15.900]   People have a problem vomiting,
[00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:19.300]   and they're told the Ipecac will stop their vomiting,
[00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:21.660]   and it stops their vomiting.
[00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:25.500]   So many placebo studies where you take people,
[00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:29.460]   they're rubbed with a leaf that they think is poison ivy.
[00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:33.180]   So it either is poison ivy or it's not poison ivy.
[00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:34.780]   You think it's poison ivy,
[00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:36.820]   or you don't think it's poison ivy,
[00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:39.740]   and your body reacts to your thoughts.
[00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:42.260]   If you think it's not poison ivy,
[00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:43.420]   you don't get the rash.
[00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:46.140]   If you think it is poison ivy, you do.
[00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:46.980]   - Spectacular.
[00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:50.140]   - Yeah, and so we've been studying this for forever.
[00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:52.980]   I think that placebos are probably
[00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:55.020]   our very strongest medicine,
[00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:58.020]   although it's interesting that
[00:24:58.020 --> 00:25:02.780]   when people think that they were given a placebo,
[00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:04.780]   they get very upset.
[00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:07.060]   You know, they should be excited
[00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:09.740]   because if the placebo didn't cure you,
[00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:10.580]   who cured you?
[00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:12.460]   You did it yourself.
[00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:15.580]   But placebos have gotten a bad rap,
[00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:19.460]   I think primarily because of the pharmaceutical companies.
[00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:21.740]   You want to bring a drug to market.
[00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:26.140]   The way you do that is you have to run an experiment
[00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:29.860]   where the drug outperforms the placebo,
[00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:31.020]   and when it doesn't,
[00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:33.940]   damn it, I can't make all those billions of dollars
[00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:38.940]   without saying, wow, this sugar pill is mighty, mighty strong.
[00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:42.620]   - I want to talk about three themes that you raised.
[00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:45.060]   The first one is this mind-body notion,
[00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:47.540]   and now, even as I say it, mind-body,
[00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:49.340]   I feel like a hint of guilt
[00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:51.900]   because I completely agree
[00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:54.300]   that the division of mind and body
[00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:59.020]   is one of the greatest mistakes of thinking in psychology
[00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:01.340]   and Western medicine that ever existed.
[00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:05.420]   In fact, a lot of my secret mission in this podcast
[00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:08.940]   is to remind people every single episode, it seems,
[00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:12.380]   that the brain and body are connected bidirectionally
[00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:14.300]   through the nervous system, but other systems too.
[00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:16.860]   Like, there's no single system,
[00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:19.180]   hormone system, nervous system, immune system-
[00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:20.540]   - Right, it's all one, right.
[00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:23.460]   - That doesn't cross the blood-brain barrier
[00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:24.300]   and go back and forth.
[00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:25.340]   - It's all because of Descartes.
[00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:27.580]   You know, Descartes was out to dinner,
[00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:30.740]   and the waitress asked him if he wanted a salad,
[00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:33.080]   and he said, "I think not," and he disappeared.
[00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:36.420]   I think I am, therefore I am.
[00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:38.500]   - I was about to ask, I was like, "How was it that you-
[00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:40.900]   - And after that, Andrew, I say this is not my day job,
[00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:42.220]   so I don't have to be funny.
[00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:43.640]   - I love it, I love it.
[00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:46.580]   I've spent a lot of time
[00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:48.180]   trying to learn the history of medicine
[00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:50.260]   and the merge of philosophy and medicine.
[00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:51.100]   There's a wonderful book
[00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:53.260]   that if anyone is suffering from insomnia,
[00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:54.100]   they should check out
[00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:55.580]   because it's extremely detailed
[00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:57.420]   and difficult to listen to or read,
[00:26:57.420 --> 00:26:58.620]   but it's called "The Prince of Medicine,"
[00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:00.900]   which basically details all the reasons
[00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:02.060]   why we are so confused
[00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:04.220]   about how medicine is done and should be done.
[00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:05.900]   And it has to do with rules and restrictions
[00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:07.020]   and cultural conventions,
[00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:10.500]   and it's a whole barbed wire mess, basically,
[00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:13.900]   but it includes this mess that was created for us,
[00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:16.420]   which is this idea that somehow,
[00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:20.940]   because the brain is perhaps the seat of our consciousness,
[00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:23.260]   to many people, they believe that,
[00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:25.980]   but certainly, you know, like if I were to lose
[00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:27.860]   a few fingers on my left hand,
[00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:31.680]   I'm not sure I would fundamentally be a different person,
[00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:33.820]   but if I lost a few millimeters,
[00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:36.940]   or the equivalent amount of real estate in my brain,
[00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:38.740]   my personality could very well change,
[00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:42.180]   perhaps for the better, some would say,
[00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:44.540]   and I'm probably not hoping for that event.
[00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:47.060]   But all kidding aside, you know,
[00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:50.500]   I think the mind-body distinction has really poisoned
[00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:52.780]   our thinking about what's possible,
[00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:55.460]   and the other experiments that you described,
[00:27:55.460 --> 00:27:56.980]   you know, point to what's possible,
[00:27:56.980 --> 00:27:58.140]   and I wanna talk about those,
[00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:00.100]   but maybe if we could just hover on this notion
[00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:03.460]   of mind and body as a single thing,
[00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:04.500]   that there's an us,
[00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:06.020]   I don't wanna get too philosophical here,
[00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:07.140]   but that there's an us,
[00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:11.460]   and our body carries us forward in motor behavior,
[00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:14.140]   but like, how should we conceptualize the self
[00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:16.660]   if we don't have a mind-body distinction?
[00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:19.420]   - I don't know why that's a problem.
[00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:21.460]   - Well, I think- - Why, you know,
[00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:25.740]   I am who I am, period, right?
[00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:27.940]   How does that change whether we wanna see me
[00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:30.220]   as having a mind-body and elbows?
[00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:35.100]   So explain to me, and then I will explain to you.
[00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:36.980]   - Yeah, well, what I love is,
[00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:38.780]   I'm gonna first reflect,
[00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:40.940]   what I love is the flexibility
[00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:42.340]   of your thinking around these things.
[00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:44.020]   Again, it's like maybe exercise,
[00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:46.020]   the effects of exercise are epiphenomena,
[00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:49.700]   or, you know, so in thinking about mind-body,
[00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:52.540]   I can't get my, no pun intended,
[00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:55.420]   my head around this distinction
[00:28:55.420 --> 00:28:57.500]   that if I lose a certain piece of my body,
[00:28:57.500 --> 00:28:59.420]   I'm not fundamentally changed,
[00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:01.620]   but if I lose a piece of neural real estate,
[00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:03.100]   I'm fundamentally different.
[00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:04.340]   That's the only thing that anchors me
[00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:05.180]   to the idea that they're separate.
[00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:06.500]   - Yeah, but that's not, why is that true?
[00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:10.100]   I mean, if, you know, let's say you're an athlete,
[00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:12.580]   and you lose two of your fingers,
[00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:14.860]   you're not going to be performing in the same way
[00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:16.220]   that you performed in the past,
[00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:18.140]   and surely you'd end up different.
[00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:20.460]   - Yeah, that's it, I'll buy that explanation.
[00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:22.460]   Yeah, I mean, I'm just trying to probe this
[00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:25.260]   because I think nowadays people think,
[00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:27.420]   oh, you know, if I breathe in a certain way,
[00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:30.340]   I'll change my state of mind, which is true.
[00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:33.620]   If I think differently, get stressed or relaxed,
[00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:34.900]   I'll change the way that I breathe.
[00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:36.500]   I mean, I think that we're starting to understand
[00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:38.380]   the bi-directionality of these things.
[00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:42.140]   - I think some of the, even the work with the brain,
[00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:47.140]   where to assess this neuroscience now is crazy with FMRIs.
[00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:50.460]   And we want, no matter what happens,
[00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:52.660]   you want to see what's going on in the brain.
[00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:57.660]   And I think that implicitly, in a backwards way,
[00:29:57.660 --> 00:30:01.020]   that leads people away from realizing
[00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:02.900]   that whatever you're looking for
[00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:05.660]   is probably manifested every place.
[00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:08.180]   You know, I had this experience.
[00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:14.020]   I like doing strange things, and I was out in Kansas City.
[00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:17.060]   And so somebody said there's an iridologist.
[00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:18.260]   What is an iridologist?
[00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:21.100]   Sure, for fun, we'll go to the iridologist.
[00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:24.340]   So this person is looking in my eye, my iris.
[00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:26.700]   That's the iridologist part.
[00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:31.060]   And she said, "You have a problem with your gallbladder."
[00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:36.980]   I thought, okay, that's great, we leave and have my time.
[00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:41.980]   I go back home and I had a problem with my gallbladder.
[00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:42.900]   - Really?
[00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:44.300]   - Everything is everywhere.
[00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:48.460]   The problem is, we don't have the technology to notice it.
[00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:50.620]   You know, so when you're happy,
[00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:53.900]   your skin is different from when you're not happy.
[00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:56.780]   But who can see such small distinctions?
[00:30:56.780 --> 00:30:57.980]   But it's there.
[00:30:57.980 --> 00:31:01.460]   All we do is look to see where the brain is different.
[00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:02.540]   It's all one.
[00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:07.060]   Anything, I believe, anything that's happening on any level
[00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:10.580]   is simultaneously, simultaneously, not sequentially,
[00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:13.100]   more or less happening on every level.
[00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:17.580]   So a teardrop of sadness, biochemically,
[00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:20.540]   is different from a teardrop of joy.
[00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:23.460]   And so it's all there.
[00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:24.980]   We just have to notice.
[00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:28.260]   I have no memory now of what it was you said
[00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:31.860]   that led to that on my part, but I'm glad I said it anyway.
[00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:33.220]   - Well, we're probing mind, body,
[00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:34.700]   and their interconnectedness.
[00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:38.820]   And so this iridologist, I've never heard that term before,
[00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:41.820]   this iridologist, it could be,
[00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:44.540]   based on what we were discussing a few moments ago,
[00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:46.460]   it could be that the suggestion
[00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:48.060]   that there was a problem with your gallbladder
[00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:50.060]   led to a problem with your gallbladder,
[00:31:50.060 --> 00:31:52.340]   or do you think that she had some,
[00:31:52.340 --> 00:31:56.580]   or he had some diagnostic knowledge?
[00:31:56.580 --> 00:31:58.540]   - I hadn't even considered the former,
[00:31:58.540 --> 00:31:59.860]   which is strange to me.
[00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:04.900]   No, I just assumed that she was seeing something.
[00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:07.660]   And I don't know, but your idea,
[00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:10.460]   but either way is fascinating, right?
[00:32:10.460 --> 00:32:12.380]   Somehow, you know, by somebody suggesting
[00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:13.700]   you have a gallbladder problem
[00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:16.540]   to have a gallbladder problem, yeah.
[00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:18.580]   - What are your thoughts on things like acupuncture
[00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:21.060]   and like, and when I think about acupuncture,
[00:32:21.060 --> 00:32:22.580]   I'm not just thinking about the needles,
[00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:25.180]   the few times I've been to an acupuncturist,
[00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:26.460]   the first thing they do is they ask you
[00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:27.300]   to stick out your tongue.
[00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:30.820]   They are able to diagnose tongue texture and color,
[00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:31.940]   and maybe they're-
[00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:34.060]   - I think everything is everywhere,
[00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:35.340]   although there's, you know,
[00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:38.140]   I teach health psych at Harvard,
[00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:41.860]   and there's some data on it being mostly placebo.
[00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:44.260]   But, you know, and that sounds like a downer,
[00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:47.380]   but most of everything is placebo.
[00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:48.340]   What does that mean?
[00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:51.700]   That virtually everything is controlled by our thoughts,
[00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:54.660]   and we need to embrace that
[00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:58.580]   to make the changes that most of us desire.
[00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:02.460]   So in other words, so going to an acupuncturist
[00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:06.580]   itself means I want to find the answers
[00:33:06.580 --> 00:33:09.900]   and seek and you are more likely to find,
[00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:14.620]   and then you're in a position to improve.
[00:33:14.620 --> 00:33:18.860]   - Might I ask what happened with your mom's mindset
[00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:21.740]   or life or psychological life that you think led to the-
[00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:24.980]   - No, there's, you know, it's an N of one,
[00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:27.260]   you know, it's very hard to know.
[00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:30.420]   I knew that when she got sick,
[00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:35.420]   I believed at that point that being anything negative
[00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:41.060]   was going to work in the opposite direction.
[00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:44.180]   And so I wouldn't let anybody in to see her.
[00:33:44.180 --> 00:33:47.580]   It wasn't uplifting, you know, that was,
[00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:49.220]   I don't, there's no way of knowing
[00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:51.020]   if any of that mattered or not.
[00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:54.980]   I went and got her a very expensive set of golf clubs.
[00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:58.060]   She wasn't a big golfer, but, you know,
[00:33:58.060 --> 00:34:00.380]   my reasoning was that, you know,
[00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:02.580]   I must believe she's going to be better
[00:34:02.580 --> 00:34:04.900]   or why would I have spent the money?
[00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:08.940]   Her reasoning was my reasoning must be that if I get these,
[00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:12.380]   she'll think that, you know, so it didn't work.
[00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:14.620]   We had these golf clubs that were never used.
[00:34:14.620 --> 00:34:16.980]   You know, I don't know.
[00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:23.180]   I believe that we have more control.
[00:34:23.180 --> 00:34:28.060]   At that point, I hadn't done all of these experiments
[00:34:28.060 --> 00:34:30.780]   that might've led me to push even harder.
[00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:32.060]   It was kind of funny though,
[00:34:32.060 --> 00:34:35.340]   because the way I had cognized everything back then
[00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:38.220]   was the importance of perceived control.
[00:34:38.220 --> 00:34:41.620]   And so I had these data people living longer and so on.
[00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:44.420]   And yet mindlessly, I, you know,
[00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:46.780]   virtually took over her life, you know,
[00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:48.900]   deciding who can see or what she can do.
[00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:52.540]   But I don't know.
[00:34:52.540 --> 00:34:54.660]   And I don't think there would have been
[00:34:54.660 --> 00:34:57.540]   with just one person, any way of knowing
[00:34:57.540 --> 00:35:01.700]   what led to the disease going away.
[00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:04.500]   But the fact that it went away was crucial to me.
[00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:09.500]   You know, I think that we have to talk
[00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:13.220]   about the myths in medicine.
[00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:15.500]   That what people need to understand
[00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:18.820]   is that all science are probabilities.
[00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:21.980]   An experiment doesn't give you absolute facts.
[00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:26.660]   And we teach these probabilities as if they're absolute
[00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:31.100]   and give up a great deal of control by doing so.
[00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:34.260]   Now, you asked me before
[00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:36.020]   about how I came to certain things.
[00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:40.500]   Let me go back to an answer I should have given you.
[00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:44.580]   Many years ago, I was at a horse event
[00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:47.100]   and this man asked me would I watch his horse for him
[00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:49.500]   because he wants to get his horse a hot dog.
[00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:51.260]   Hot dog, I'm a straight A student.
[00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:52.460]   What is it, crazy?
[00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:54.300]   Horses don't eat meat.
[00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:55.900]   Sure, I'll watch your horse.
[00:35:55.900 --> 00:35:58.820]   He comes back with the hot dog and the horse ate it.
[00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:01.500]   And that's when I realized
[00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:04.340]   everything I thought I knew could be wrong.
[00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:06.500]   And I thought, what does it mean horses don't eat meat?
[00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:08.340]   How many horses were tested?
[00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:10.020]   And what were they tested with?
[00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:12.140]   How much meat mixed with how much grain
[00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:13.620]   and what kind of grain?
[00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:15.180]   And how big are these horses?
[00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:16.740]   And when was the last, you know, and so on.
[00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:18.380]   And it all opened up and I said,
[00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:21.380]   how could we make such a statement, horses don't eat meat?
[00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:23.740]   But when you think about science,
[00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:26.260]   that imagine if you did the experiment
[00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:28.380]   and you're trying to teach somebody what you found,
[00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:31.060]   you say, these particular horses
[00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:35.340]   who hadn't eaten for three days were given this grain.
[00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:37.100]   And under those circumstances,
[00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:39.020]   80% of them didn't eat meat.
[00:36:39.020 --> 00:36:40.780]   That's a mouthful, right?
[00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:44.020]   You can't communicate that way.
[00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:47.220]   So you abbreviate it, horses don't eat meat.
[00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:49.660]   So it's not in the telling that's the problem.
[00:36:49.660 --> 00:36:52.300]   It's in the receiving of the information.
[00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:55.740]   We have to know that these things are, you know,
[00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:58.020]   are just not true to the one.
[00:36:58.020 --> 00:37:00.020]   But it's very important because
[00:37:00.020 --> 00:37:03.060]   every time you're given a diagnosis,
[00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:05.140]   you take the diagnosis as real.
[00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:08.340]   Well, it's not the case that they can be sure
[00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:12.180]   that all of these symptoms mean you have this disease.
[00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:14.740]   And if you have, quote, this disease,
[00:37:14.740 --> 00:37:17.220]   we don't know that all of the people who have it
[00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:18.060]   are going to follow.
[00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:20.540]   And it becomes very unlikely
[00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:23.660]   when you turn it all inside out that way.
[00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:28.780]   And so another part of this that we can get into or not
[00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:33.380]   is people's understanding probabilities in general,
[00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:36.220]   and that you can't predict.
[00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:39.780]   Now, people ask for answers all the time.
[00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:41.980]   You know, even the how much is one in one.
[00:37:41.980 --> 00:37:45.500]   You know, should I have the surgery?
[00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:48.020]   What is the disease that I have?
[00:37:48.020 --> 00:37:52.700]   And by recognizing that all information
[00:37:52.700 --> 00:37:57.380]   that's given is for the group, not for the individual.
[00:37:57.380 --> 00:38:01.300]   A few examples of this is kind of funny.
[00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:04.740]   I say, so Michael Jordan and I
[00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:06.580]   are gonna have a foul shooting contest.
[00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:08.420]   We each get to shoot one basket.
[00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:10.220]   Who's gonna win?
[00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:14.420]   Well, most people are just gonna quickly say Michael Jordan.
[00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:16.780]   How much money are you willing to bet on this?
[00:38:16.780 --> 00:38:18.900]   One shot each.
[00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:19.820]   Million dollars.
[00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:23.660]   I'll give you a million dollars if Ellen Langer wins.
[00:38:23.660 --> 00:38:26.940]   You give me, or I'll give you a million dollars
[00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:28.100]   if Michael Jordan wins.
[00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:32.140]   You give me half a million dollars if Ellen Langer wins.
[00:38:32.140 --> 00:38:33.540]   First, you think he'll take the bet.
[00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:36.220]   But when you think about it, no, he sometimes misses.
[00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:38.340]   She sometimes makes the basket.
[00:38:38.340 --> 00:38:41.740]   Maybe had a fight with his wife.
[00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:43.620]   Didn't sleep well.
[00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:45.580]   You know, maybe she is in top form
[00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:48.580]   and this is now the moment she's going to make that basket.
[00:38:48.580 --> 00:38:50.380]   Or make it simple.
[00:38:50.380 --> 00:38:52.980]   He said to himself, let the older woman win.
[00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:54.300]   Why not?
[00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:55.460]   Really?
[00:38:55.460 --> 00:38:57.140]   And when you think of all the reasons
[00:38:57.140 --> 00:38:59.660]   why it could be the case that I could win,
[00:38:59.660 --> 00:39:02.380]   all of a sudden you become less certain.
[00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:06.820]   Now, certainly if we were shooting 100 baskets,
[00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:07.900]   he would win.
[00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:10.380]   Let me give you another example I use too often
[00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:13.400]   'cause I don't know which of these will feel right.
[00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:18.100]   You go to a Mercedes parking lot.
[00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:19.940]   Now, pick your favorite car.
[00:39:19.940 --> 00:39:21.980]   And I'm gonna say there are 100 cars there.
[00:39:21.980 --> 00:39:23.780]   You choose one.
[00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:27.680]   And if it starts, I will give you a million dollars.
[00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:33.340]   If it doesn't start, you give me your full life savings,
[00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:35.040]   assuming it's under a million.
[00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:38.460]   Capped at a million, all right?
[00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:40.860]   Now, Mercedes are wonderful cars.
[00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:43.300]   Nobody is gonna take that bet.
[00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:46.340]   Everybody knows, you know, sometimes it doesn't work.
[00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:49.060]   You know, sometimes the genius gets something wrong.
[00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:52.260]   Sometimes a car is a lemon and so on.
[00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:54.700]   So what we mean when we say,
[00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:56.980]   you know, if you were gonna start 100 cars,
[00:39:56.980 --> 00:39:59.300]   most of them are going to start.
[00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:02.140]   But you can't predict which one isn't going to.
[00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:05.420]   Well, in life, I'm happy if an operation
[00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:07.220]   is good for most people.
[00:40:07.220 --> 00:40:09.820]   I wanna know, is it going to work for me?
[00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:12.160]   And there's no way to know that.
[00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:14.800]   You can never predict the individual case.
[00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:18.460]   But, Andrew, we don't have to worry about that
[00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:22.660]   because you can always predict or control your reaction
[00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:24.180]   to whatever is happening.
[00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:28.180]   So it doesn't matter as much.
[00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:30.300]   You see, if I can be happy,
[00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:33.780]   whether this occurs or the opposite occurs,
[00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:37.400]   I care less about which way it turns out.
[00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:39.740]   But right now, we're all brought up in a world
[00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:42.500]   where we have these good things, we have these bad things.
[00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:44.540]   You've gotta kill yourself to get the good things.
[00:40:44.540 --> 00:40:47.440]   Step over whoever you can to avoid the bad things.
[00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:50.920]   Once you recognize that's all in your head,
[00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:52.880]   then just be still.
[00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:56.200]   My favorite example, this is so, for me, was so funny.
[00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:59.240]   I'm doing one of these podcasts over Zoom,
[00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:04.240]   and I'm trying to explain that evaluation is in your head,
[00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:07.680]   not in the things you're evaluating.
[00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:09.200]   I say, as an example,
[00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:12.440]   so if the internet went out right now,
[00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:15.060]   wouldn't be terrible, I'd go have lunch.
[00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:17.780]   The internet went out just at that moment,
[00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:18.900]   and I did have lunch
[00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:22.260]   because I had put the suggestion in my mind.
[00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:24.380]   Most things don't matter.
[00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:26.560]   We don't recognize that, and I think,
[00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:30.400]   I have a few one-liners that if people understand
[00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:32.520]   or care about nothing else that I've said,
[00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:36.200]   take this to heart, that next time you're stressed,
[00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:40.160]   ask yourself, is it a tragedy or an inconvenience?
[00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:42.540]   It's almost never a tragedy,
[00:41:42.540 --> 00:41:46.740]   and so then you breathe, I failed the test.
[00:41:46.740 --> 00:41:48.900]   I got dented the car.
[00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:49.980]   I missed the bus.
[00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:51.960]   Whatever it is, so what?
[00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:57.360]   And so you take a deep breath and come back to yourself
[00:41:57.360 --> 00:42:00.340]   and realize that most of the things
[00:42:00.340 --> 00:42:04.380]   that make us crazed are unnecessary.
[00:42:04.380 --> 00:42:06.360]   You get a lot of this as you get older,
[00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:09.780]   but I teach my students this early on.
[00:42:09.780 --> 00:42:11.180]   Why wait?
[00:42:11.180 --> 00:42:14.600]   You know, why wait to recognize that you're the one
[00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:17.520]   who's almost always your worst enemy?
[00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:20.220]   - I'd like to take a quick break
[00:42:20.220 --> 00:42:22.420]   and thank our sponsor, AG1.
[00:42:22.420 --> 00:42:25.780]   AG1 is an all-in-one vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:42:25.780 --> 00:42:27.200]   with adaptogens.
[00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:30.080]   I've been taking AG1 daily since 2012,
[00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:32.580]   so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring this podcast.
[00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:34.300]   The reason I started taking AG1
[00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:36.020]   and the reason I still take AG1
[00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:37.520]   is because it is the highest quality
[00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:40.420]   and most complete foundational nutritional supplement.
[00:42:40.420 --> 00:42:42.420]   What that means is that AG1 ensures
[00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:44.660]   that you're getting all the necessary vitamins,
[00:42:44.660 --> 00:42:46.500]   minerals, and other micronutrients
[00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:49.220]   to form a strong foundation for your daily health.
[00:42:49.220 --> 00:42:51.860]   AG1 also has probiotics and prebiotics
[00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:53.780]   that support a healthy gut microbiome.
[00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:55.660]   Your gut microbiome consists of trillions
[00:42:55.660 --> 00:42:58.500]   of microorganisms that line your digestive tract
[00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:01.020]   and impact things such as your immune system status,
[00:43:01.020 --> 00:43:03.980]   your metabolic health, your hormone health, and much more.
[00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:07.000]   So I've consistently found that when I take AG1 daily,
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:10.180]   my digestion is improved, my immune system is more robust,
[00:43:10.180 --> 00:43:12.780]   and my mood and mental focus are at their best.
[00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:14.980]   In fact, if I could take just one supplement,
[00:43:14.980 --> 00:43:17.180]   that supplement would be AG1.
[00:43:17.180 --> 00:43:18.580]   If you'd like to try AG1,
[00:43:18.580 --> 00:43:21.820]   you can go to drinkag1.com/huberman

[00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:29.260]   with your order of AG1.
[00:43:29.260 --> 00:43:32.580]   Again, go to drinkag1.com/huberman

[00:43:34.420 --> 00:43:37.540]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Juve.
[00:43:37.540 --> 00:43:40.840]   Juve makes medical grade red light therapy devices.
[00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:41.680]   Now, if there's one thing
[00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:44.220]   that I have consistently emphasized on this podcast,
[00:43:44.220 --> 00:43:45.680]   it is the incredible impact
[00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:47.720]   that light can have on our biology.
[00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:48.960]   Now, in addition to sunlight,
[00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:51.280]   red light and near infrared light sources
[00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:53.120]   have been shown to have positive effects
[00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:55.880]   on improving numerous aspects of cellar and organ health,
[00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:57.760]   including faster muscle recovery,
[00:43:57.760 --> 00:43:59.920]   improved skin health and wound healing,
[00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:03.120]   improvements in acne, reduced pain and inflammation,
[00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:06.380]   even mitochondrial function and improving vision itself.
[00:44:06.380 --> 00:44:07.700]   What sets Juve lights apart
[00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:10.280]   and why they're my preferred red light therapy device
[00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:12.320]   is that they use clinically proven wavelengths,
[00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:14.560]   meaning specific wavelengths of red light
[00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:16.780]   and near infrared light in combination
[00:44:16.780 --> 00:44:19.560]   to trigger the optimal cellar adaptations.
[00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:21.720]   Personally, I use the Juve whole body panel
[00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:23.280]   about three to four times a week,
[00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:25.140]   and I use the Juve handheld light
[00:44:25.140 --> 00:44:27.320]   both at home and when I travel.
[00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:28.400]   If you'd like to try Juve,
[00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:33.240]   you can go to juve spelled J-O-O-V-V.com/huberman.
[00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:35.120]   Juve is offering an exclusive discount
[00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:36.780]   to all Huberman Lab listeners
[00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:39.380]   with up to $400 off Juve products.
[00:44:39.380 --> 00:44:43.880]   Again, that's Juve spelled J-O-O-V-V.com/huberman
[00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:46.240]   to get up to $400 off.
[00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:48.280]   So much of our developmental wiring
[00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:51.000]   is based on learning how to predict
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.200]   what's going to happen next.
[00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:54.560]   I mean, you think about object constancy
[00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:56.000]   that kids of a certain age,
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:57.400]   you put a ball behind your back,
[00:44:57.400 --> 00:44:58.360]   they think it disappeared.
[00:44:58.360 --> 00:45:00.760]   Eventually they realize just because you moved your arm
[00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:01.640]   and the ball behind your back
[00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:04.960]   doesn't mean that the ball is gone, this kind of thing.
[00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:09.960]   - Sadly though, then they believe the ball is still there
[00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:12.760]   when in fact the ball may be gone.
[00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:14.120]   - True, right.
[00:45:14.120 --> 00:45:17.920]   There's always a portal to a different outcome.
[00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:19.680]   And I'm catching on to your mode of thinking here.
[00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:22.140]   This is actually what I'm trying to do
[00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:25.760]   because I think the brain is a prediction making machine
[00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:27.040]   in addition to doing other things.
[00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:29.440]   It regulates heartbeat, all the autonomic stuff, right?
[00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:31.180]   Heartbeat, digestion, et cetera.
[00:45:31.180 --> 00:45:34.300]   It remembers things and it's a prediction making machine.
[00:45:34.300 --> 00:45:36.360]   At least those three things.
[00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:38.800]   I feel like the prediction making aspect
[00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:43.240]   of our neural circuitry is what leads us to this notion
[00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:46.920]   of having control or wanting control.
[00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:48.720]   Because I think a lot of what's happening
[00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:52.040]   in our conversation in the backdrop of these experiments
[00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:56.820]   is to what extent do we have control over outcomes?
[00:45:56.820 --> 00:46:00.800]   - Well, it's interesting because our mindlessness,
[00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:05.000]   which results I think in part to hold onto things,
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:07.280]   to have control, is the very thing
[00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:09.480]   that deprives us of control.
[00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:11.160]   Because again, things are changing.
[00:46:11.160 --> 00:46:13.680]   You're holding it still in your mind.
[00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:17.600]   And so you're living with somebody or you meet somebody
[00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:22.600]   and right away you decide what size that person up.
[00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:26.140]   So now you can control your interactions with them.
[00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:29.880]   But what you're doing is ignoring all the times
[00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:34.480]   the person is not like that and all the ways
[00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:38.740]   that the relationship could have otherwise grown.
[00:46:38.740 --> 00:46:43.000]   In general, and this is, you know,
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:47.000]   I have a psychological treatment for chronic illness.
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:50.220]   It's all based on the same idea of change.
[00:46:50.220 --> 00:46:53.560]   Things are changing, we're always holding it still.
[00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:58.360]   And so you have the illusion that you're controlling things.
[00:46:58.360 --> 00:47:04.080]   But in fact, you're giving up control
[00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:07.960]   by not recognizing for yourself or somebody else.
[00:47:07.960 --> 00:47:11.080]   You know, all of our statements of we can't do
[00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:13.620]   or we can do, you can't know whether you can or you can't.
[00:47:13.620 --> 00:47:15.360]   The fact that you did it doesn't mean
[00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:16.440]   that you can do it again.
[00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:17.520]   The fact that you couldn't do it
[00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:20.000]   doesn't mean you couldn't do it in the future.
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:21.840]   - I feel like close to the end of each year,
[00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:24.080]   which we just, you know, passed recently,
[00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:26.120]   these lists come out.
[00:47:26.120 --> 00:47:29.000]   - Oh, these resolutions are so mindless.
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:32.700]   And, but they're more than just mindless.
[00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:37.480]   They deny that what we did made sense
[00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:38.920]   or else we wouldn't have done it.
[00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:42.120]   That one thing that I told you is more important to me
[00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:44.080]   than anything else that I came to
[00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:45.940]   over all these years of study.
[00:47:45.940 --> 00:47:49.040]   You know, so you're going to resolve
[00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:51.920]   that you're going to, I don't know, stop drinking.
[00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:53.920]   You're gonna go to the gym,
[00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:57.000]   whatever these new year's resolutions are,
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:00.080]   suggests that what you were doing
[00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:03.040]   instead of that thing you think you should be doing
[00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:06.040]   was not something you should have been doing.
[00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:09.800]   And I think that's never the case.
[00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:11.360]   - I woke up early this morning
[00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:13.160]   and my first thoughts of the day,
[00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:17.480]   I like to think have some importance for something.
[00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:18.960]   Who knows, it's when my mind,
[00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:21.160]   it seems clearest for at least a nanosecond.
[00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:25.120]   And my first thought was that the pattern
[00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:26.800]   that I seem to be perpetually in
[00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:28.400]   is one of whatever I'm doing,
[00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:32.340]   unless I'm podcasting or reading a research paper,
[00:48:32.340 --> 00:48:36.280]   that my mind is constantly flitting to the other things
[00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:37.840]   that I think I should be doing.
[00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:38.680]   - Yeah, that's sad.
[00:48:38.680 --> 00:48:41.360]   - It's sad and it's something I've been working on
[00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:42.520]   for a very long time.
[00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:45.020]   And I'm able to hold my, for lack of a better word,
[00:48:45.020 --> 00:48:47.340]   attention on things to accomplish tasks
[00:48:47.340 --> 00:48:50.900]   and in my life and to be present with people as it were.
[00:48:50.900 --> 00:48:52.440]   But I thought--
[00:48:52.440 --> 00:48:54.160]   - No, no, no, let's go back a step
[00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:55.440]   'cause we both said it was sad.
[00:48:55.440 --> 00:48:56.440]   Why is it sad?
[00:48:56.440 --> 00:49:00.320]   I'm reconsidering that too,
[00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:02.640]   to be able to think of five different things
[00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:06.200]   instead of one could be an asset.
[00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:07.180]   - Right, it could be an asset.
[00:49:07.180 --> 00:49:10.040]   I think that for me, what I realize is
[00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:12.880]   most of the shoulds are just total lies.
[00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:15.800]   They don't, and also they don't, they're just lies.
[00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:18.120]   They're not actually coming from a script.
[00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:20.760]   I'm not hearing other people's voices in my head.
[00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:21.800]   Yeah, you should do this.
[00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:24.560]   It's not parental narrative or anything.
[00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:29.560]   It's just contamination of a useless type.
[00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:33.480]   It's not like listening to the radio.
[00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:34.400]   I used to listen to the radio
[00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:35.720]   while I'd like make dinner or something.
[00:49:35.720 --> 00:49:37.040]   And it was so pleasant, right?
[00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:39.480]   I'd hear an evening discussion about the news
[00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:43.360]   or talk show or whatever on the radio while cooking.
[00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:46.880]   And so that kind of "distraction" felt really meaningful.
[00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:48.680]   I felt like when I lived alone
[00:49:48.680 --> 00:49:50.220]   that I had other people in the room with me.
[00:49:50.220 --> 00:49:51.460]   This is different.
[00:49:51.460 --> 00:49:53.840]   This is, it feels as if it detracts
[00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:57.180]   from some essence of the behavior that I'm in,
[00:49:57.180 --> 00:49:59.320]   even if the behavior is just getting out of bed
[00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:00.160]   in the morning.
[00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:02.020]   - Wait, so let me be clear.
[00:50:02.020 --> 00:50:04.520]   You get out of bed or start to get out of bed
[00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:05.920]   and you have several thoughts.
[00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:06.760]   - Yep.
[00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:08.400]   - And those thoughts bother you?
[00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:12.920]   Do they prevent you from getting out of bed?
[00:50:12.920 --> 00:50:15.120]   - No, but they feel intrusive.
[00:50:15.120 --> 00:50:17.060]   They don't feel welcome.
[00:50:17.060 --> 00:50:20.440]   Because I know what I'm gonna do each day.
[00:50:20.440 --> 00:50:24.720]   I have a policy for myself of doing one work thing each day,
[00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:25.900]   maybe in one or two blocks.
[00:50:25.900 --> 00:50:28.520]   And I try and really put everything I have into those.
[00:50:28.520 --> 00:50:30.120]   It's kind of a recent evolution
[00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:32.320]   of not trying to do three things in a day.
[00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:34.780]   Maybe it's a function of getting older,
[00:50:34.780 --> 00:50:36.880]   but I get so much more satisfaction
[00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:38.880]   and get truly so much more done
[00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:40.880]   from just doing one thing in my work life each day.
[00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:43.800]   - I don't even understand the one thing idea,
[00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:47.200]   that people talk about multitasking,
[00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:48.120]   which is what you're saying.
[00:50:48.120 --> 00:50:50.240]   And you're better not to multitask,
[00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:52.720]   but you're always multitasking, right?
[00:50:52.720 --> 00:50:55.520]   I mean, I'm moving my hands while I'm talking to you
[00:50:55.520 --> 00:50:59.640]   and I'm sort of thinking and fixing my back.
[00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:02.900]   There are always lots of things going on.
[00:51:02.900 --> 00:51:07.880]   And I think that also tasks.
[00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:09.440]   So let's say you're a kid
[00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:12.280]   and you're doing your social studies homework.
[00:51:12.280 --> 00:51:15.960]   And then you're doing your math homework.
[00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:18.260]   And you go back and forth.
[00:51:18.260 --> 00:51:20.200]   So are you multitasking?
[00:51:20.200 --> 00:51:21.040]   It depends.
[00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:23.120]   If you see yourself as multitasking,
[00:51:23.120 --> 00:51:24.680]   then you're drawing boundaries
[00:51:24.680 --> 00:51:27.840]   between your math and your social studies.
[00:51:27.840 --> 00:51:30.380]   If you see yourself as doing homework,
[00:51:30.380 --> 00:51:33.020]   it's all part of the same thing.
[00:51:33.020 --> 00:51:37.660]   And so there's always a way that the task can be grouped
[00:51:37.660 --> 00:51:41.640]   as a single unit, or you can see anything as multitasking.
[00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:43.420]   When you see it as multitasking,
[00:51:43.420 --> 00:51:45.240]   you're suggesting to yourself
[00:51:45.240 --> 00:51:47.880]   that there's going to be some conflict.
[00:51:47.880 --> 00:51:50.700]   There's some reason I'm leaving this to go to this.
[00:51:50.700 --> 00:51:54.960]   - Well, maybe I'm running the script backwards.
[00:51:54.960 --> 00:51:57.280]   Let me put it differently.
[00:51:57.280 --> 00:52:02.200]   The level of satisfaction that I feel
[00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:05.200]   from having, say, worked on a chapter of my book
[00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:08.040]   for a couple of hours, or even 45 minutes,
[00:52:08.040 --> 00:52:11.580]   or from going for a run without my phone
[00:52:11.580 --> 00:52:13.140]   and just enjoying the run,
[00:52:13.140 --> 00:52:19.220]   it still blows me away how much I enjoy things
[00:52:19.220 --> 00:52:24.000]   that would fall under the category of simple things,
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:27.260]   or things that I experience in isolation,
[00:52:27.260 --> 00:52:31.180]   as compared to how little I enjoy,
[00:52:31.180 --> 00:52:34.600]   and sometimes reflect on how punishing
[00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:37.700]   quote, unquote, multitasking is,
[00:52:37.700 --> 00:52:40.220]   like being in a text conversation
[00:52:40.220 --> 00:52:41.560]   while I'm walking on the beach.
[00:52:41.560 --> 00:52:44.260]   - No, no, but when you're texting while you're on the beach,
[00:52:44.260 --> 00:52:48.660]   probably it's some kind of work text, right?
[00:52:48.660 --> 00:52:51.180]   There's something about it,
[00:52:51.180 --> 00:52:53.860]   and why are you doing it when you're on the beach?
[00:52:53.860 --> 00:52:55.660]   Because I can easily imagine,
[00:52:55.660 --> 00:52:57.780]   oh, I'm on the beach, it's wonderful.
[00:52:57.780 --> 00:52:59.780]   Let me text Andrew and say,
[00:52:59.780 --> 00:53:02.980]   "Andrew, you're right, this time on the beach is wonderful,"
[00:53:02.980 --> 00:53:05.540]   and texting wouldn't take away from it.
[00:53:05.540 --> 00:53:09.060]   My life is much simpler.
[00:53:09.060 --> 00:53:12.540]   To me, all you have are moments, that's it,
[00:53:12.540 --> 00:53:15.420]   and if you make the moment matter, then the moment matters,
[00:53:15.420 --> 00:53:17.380]   and you can't make it matter more.
[00:53:17.380 --> 00:53:19.740]   It matters or it doesn't matter,
[00:53:19.740 --> 00:53:23.380]   and so the question, when you're lost doing,
[00:53:23.380 --> 00:53:26.420]   or found, really, I don't wanna say lost when we're writing.
[00:53:26.420 --> 00:53:28.480]   I find myself while I'm writing,
[00:53:28.480 --> 00:53:31.600]   but when you're engaged in an activity,
[00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:35.820]   you're making each of those moments matter,
[00:53:35.820 --> 00:53:39.900]   but they should matter as much.
[00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:43.740]   I had this thought that I would help people who were stressed
[00:53:43.740 --> 00:53:44.780]   and I would say to them,
[00:53:44.780 --> 00:53:49.340]   okay, so assuming that their vision is reasonable,
[00:53:49.340 --> 00:53:53.700]   just thread a needle, threading the needle,
[00:53:53.700 --> 00:53:56.020]   and then I'd ask them how they felt,
[00:53:56.020 --> 00:53:57.620]   and everybody's gonna feel fine.
[00:53:58.520 --> 00:54:02.200]   Because you're actively engaged and doing something.
[00:54:02.200 --> 00:54:05.300]   You're not engaged in what people call monkey brain
[00:54:05.300 --> 00:54:07.640]   or whatever, worrying about tomorrow,
[00:54:07.640 --> 00:54:10.260]   worrying about so on.
[00:54:10.260 --> 00:54:14.860]   So to go back to your three things,
[00:54:14.860 --> 00:54:21.200]   it's like the text on the beach is not an I love you text,
[00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:24.960]   'cause I don't see why that would distract you.
[00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:28.160]   I could imagine being anywhere doing multiple things
[00:54:28.160 --> 00:54:30.200]   where I'm sharing what I'm doing,
[00:54:30.200 --> 00:54:31.700]   but I'm not seeing them.
[00:54:31.700 --> 00:54:34.580]   Oh, I have to do this work thing.
[00:54:34.580 --> 00:54:39.040]   And then the question is, why see the work thing that way,
[00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:41.160]   and especially someone like you
[00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:44.100]   where you don't need any of this anymore anyway.
[00:54:44.100 --> 00:54:47.240]   - Yeah, that's a discussion unto itself.
[00:54:47.240 --> 00:54:50.000]   - But no, but it's important.
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:53.560]   And so that if it's all fun, it doesn't matter.
[00:54:53.560 --> 00:54:56.120]   I was on this panel in Australia.
[00:54:56.120 --> 00:54:58.960]   Well, first, each of us gave a talk, some big shots.
[00:54:58.960 --> 00:55:02.240]   And then unbeknownst to us, they brought us all out.
[00:55:02.240 --> 00:55:03.820]   And so we're sitting there,
[00:55:03.820 --> 00:55:06.360]   and I'm the last one to be asked.
[00:55:06.360 --> 00:55:09.840]   And the question was, what's on your bucket list?
[00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:13.280]   And so the first person answers what's on the next person,
[00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:14.320]   and we get five.
[00:55:14.320 --> 00:55:15.520]   Now it's my turn.
[00:55:15.520 --> 00:55:17.560]   So I've had some time to think about this.
[00:55:17.560 --> 00:55:21.280]   My first thought, I don't have a bucket list.
[00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:22.900]   But of course, you know that I'm gonna say,
[00:55:22.900 --> 00:55:24.560]   well, it's good not to have a bucket list,
[00:55:24.560 --> 00:55:26.240]   or else I'd have a bucket list.
[00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:30.280]   So then I'm able to say why I don't have a bucket list.
[00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:33.440]   If you imagine you're like a glass,
[00:55:33.440 --> 00:55:37.720]   and the water is full, or whatever,
[00:55:37.720 --> 00:55:41.000]   vodka in this case, that it's full, it's full.
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:43.080]   You can't do more than that.
[00:55:43.080 --> 00:55:46.220]   And so if the moment is meaningful,
[00:55:46.220 --> 00:55:48.640]   you don't have to be writing that book,
[00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:52.780]   being in love, on a vacation in Paris.
[00:55:52.780 --> 00:55:59.560]   And so I think we have all these crazy notions,
[00:55:59.560 --> 00:56:02.540]   even the idea of, and I've talked about this before,
[00:56:02.540 --> 00:56:04.220]   work-life balance.
[00:56:04.220 --> 00:56:06.400]   Ooh, that's scary to me.
[00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:11.400]   What that says, what life really means is some joy, right?
[00:56:11.400 --> 00:56:15.940]   Other than just doing work 24/7,
[00:56:15.940 --> 00:56:18.740]   or however long people work, not 24/7.
[00:56:18.740 --> 00:56:21.820]   What is it, three and a half hours?
[00:56:21.820 --> 00:56:26.820]   Anyway, that it suggests that we,
[00:56:26.820 --> 00:56:31.300]   the work that we're doing has to be aversive.
[00:56:31.300 --> 00:56:35.500]   And because it's aversive, the only way to have a good life
[00:56:35.500 --> 00:56:38.360]   is to add this fun time.
[00:56:38.360 --> 00:56:40.140]   And I think that's sad.
[00:56:40.140 --> 00:56:44.120]   I think it's sad that people think life has to be stressful,
[00:56:44.120 --> 00:56:46.320]   that work has to be unpleasant,
[00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:50.920]   that no matter what you're doing,
[00:56:50.920 --> 00:56:54.880]   I believe there's a way of doing it so that it's fun.
[00:56:54.880 --> 00:56:56.200]   - Well, I love that notion.
[00:56:56.200 --> 00:57:00.360]   I mean, I will routinely find these articles
[00:57:00.360 --> 00:57:03.760]   just get served up to me in my Google feed or something.
[00:57:03.760 --> 00:57:05.960]   Like the five things that people regret most
[00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:07.060]   on their deathbed.
[00:57:07.060 --> 00:57:08.320]   I think these lists are terrible.
[00:57:08.320 --> 00:57:09.160]   - I do too.
[00:57:09.160 --> 00:57:12.160]   - I think they're terrible because without fail,
[00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:14.560]   the number one, two, or three is always,
[00:57:14.560 --> 00:57:16.600]   I wish I hadn't worked as much.
[00:57:16.600 --> 00:57:19.760]   I've derived tremendous pleasure from my work,
[00:57:19.760 --> 00:57:21.720]   but also tremendous relationships,
[00:57:21.720 --> 00:57:24.760]   tremendous levels of insight
[00:57:24.760 --> 00:57:27.080]   into what I think are insights anyway.
[00:57:27.080 --> 00:57:29.760]   - Well, Claire, you wouldn't be having the experience now.
[00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:31.440]   - Yeah, exactly, exactly.
[00:57:31.440 --> 00:57:34.880]   I mean, I'm constantly in pinch me moments.
[00:57:34.880 --> 00:57:36.520]   With the podcast, that was also true
[00:57:36.520 --> 00:57:38.000]   when I was running my lab,
[00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:39.800]   and then I decided to transition more to this
[00:57:39.800 --> 00:57:40.640]   and other things.
[00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:45.360]   But I mean, this notion that one wishes they'd worked less,
[00:57:45.360 --> 00:57:48.840]   it's such a sad thing to even think about,
[00:57:48.840 --> 00:57:52.760]   but it also implies that somebody who enjoys their work
[00:57:52.760 --> 00:57:54.880]   doesn't enjoy their family or their relationships.
[00:57:54.880 --> 00:57:56.920]   And that certainly isn't true either.
[00:57:56.920 --> 00:57:58.560]   So there are all these assumptions
[00:57:58.560 --> 00:57:59.660]   that are written into these lists.
[00:57:59.660 --> 00:58:03.640]   I'm actually quite opposed to lists of that sort
[00:58:03.640 --> 00:58:05.800]   in a short media article form,
[00:58:05.800 --> 00:58:09.720]   because I think A, it clearly doesn't change behavior.
[00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:12.000]   I mean, people have been talking about drink lists.
[00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:14.960]   Well, smoking was eradicated mostly from this country
[00:58:14.960 --> 00:58:16.000]   through different mechanisms,
[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:20.320]   but sleep more, stress less.
[00:58:20.320 --> 00:58:22.440]   I mean, these lists come out
[00:58:22.440 --> 00:58:24.280]   and they don't change behavior at all.
[00:58:24.280 --> 00:58:26.680]   - Not only that, but even a discussion about,
[00:58:26.680 --> 00:58:28.840]   let's say something like sleep,
[00:58:28.840 --> 00:58:30.980]   I find it outrageous.
[00:58:30.980 --> 00:58:34.520]   We might even disagree on this here,
[00:58:34.520 --> 00:58:38.480]   but when people say how much sleep you need.
[00:58:38.480 --> 00:58:41.800]   Now, to me, if I just ran a marathon,
[00:58:41.800 --> 00:58:46.320]   that night, I probably need a different amount of sleep
[00:58:46.320 --> 00:58:48.800]   than if I stayed in bed, eating candy,
[00:58:48.800 --> 00:58:50.280]   watching movies all day.
[00:58:50.280 --> 00:58:56.760]   And my age, everything should play a part in this.
[00:58:56.760 --> 00:59:00.000]   - If I relax in the two or three hours
[00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:03.320]   before going to sleep, especially if I dim the lights,
[00:59:03.320 --> 00:59:07.000]   I actually require a full two to three hours less of sleep
[00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:08.680]   to wake up feeling refreshed.
[00:59:08.680 --> 00:59:10.440]   My criteria is what does it take
[00:59:10.440 --> 00:59:12.800]   to wake up feeling reasonably refreshed?
[00:59:12.800 --> 00:59:15.340]   - So to go back to the mind-body unity studies,
[00:59:15.340 --> 00:59:18.320]   we have a study where we have people in a sleep lab,
[00:59:18.320 --> 00:59:21.160]   they wake up and the clock tells them
[00:59:21.160 --> 00:59:24.120]   they got two hours more sleep than they actually got,
[00:59:24.120 --> 00:59:27.280]   two hours fewer, or the amount of sleep they got.
[00:59:27.280 --> 00:59:30.080]   Biological and cognitive functioning
[00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:31.960]   follow perceived amount of sleep.
[00:59:31.960 --> 00:59:33.320]   - Yeah, this is such an important study.
[00:59:33.320 --> 00:59:34.320]   I was gonna bring it up later,
[00:59:34.320 --> 00:59:36.320]   but I'm so glad you brought it up now.
[00:59:36.320 --> 00:59:38.200]   These days, a tremendous number of people
[00:59:38.200 --> 00:59:39.440]   are tracking their sleep.
[00:59:39.440 --> 00:59:41.720]   I do it through my sleep mattress cover.
[00:59:41.720 --> 00:59:43.280]   I love getting my sleep score.
[00:59:43.280 --> 00:59:44.840]   I like to see what I got.
[00:59:44.840 --> 00:59:47.880]   People do with the Oura Ring or the Woot Band
[00:59:47.880 --> 00:59:50.200]   or pick your favorite technology nowadays
[00:59:50.200 --> 00:59:51.520]   or Apple Watch, whatever.
[00:59:51.520 --> 00:59:54.680]   If I understand this study correctly,
[00:59:54.680 --> 00:59:58.760]   the perception of how much sleep people got
[00:59:58.760 --> 01:00:02.440]   based on their knowledge of a number, a score, et cetera,
[01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:04.720]   dictates their cognitive performance
[01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:06.280]   and their physical wellbeing.
[01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:08.360]   I mean, this runs counter-current
[01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:12.400]   to everything in the wellness biohacking movement.
[01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:15.560]   It jibes, however, with the data that I'm aware of.
[01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:19.680]   I think it was a sleep lab at Stanford that, for instance,
[01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:22.560]   positive anticipation of next day events
[01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:24.520]   reduces your sleep need
[01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:26.560]   and improves the quality of your sleep.
[01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:28.600]   Just being excited for the next day
[01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:31.200]   can make it such that the five hours you got is sufficient.
[01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:34.560]   - The funniest thing is that if you have to wake up
[01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:36.720]   early in the morning to make a flight,
[01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:39.080]   okay, so you have to get up at 4.30 in the morning
[01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:40.120]   to make a flight,
[01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:43.440]   what most people will do is go to sleep early
[01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:47.480]   the night before so they can wake up early,
[01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:49.200]   but they're not gonna be able to fall asleep
[01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:50.880]   because the amount of sleep they need
[01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:54.320]   is dictated by the day before, not the day to come.
[01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:57.080]   - Well, I do think that there was a
[01:00:57.080 --> 01:00:58.600]   I'll sleep when I'm dead mindset
[01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:01.000]   that was diminishing people's health for a while.
[01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:04.560]   I do think it's great that books like Matt Walker's,
[01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:06.760]   you know, "Why We Sleep," et cetera, came out.
[01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:09.640]   Although that book focused more on the bad things
[01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:11.360]   that happen if you don't sleep enough.
[01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:13.880]   And I think Matt, who's done a series on here about sleep,
[01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:15.120]   would now say, you know,
[01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:17.840]   it's great that we're now focused largely on the things
[01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:20.360]   that one can do to get agency over one's sleep.
[01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:21.960]   But I think that there's such a thing
[01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:25.360]   as creating a sleep need anxiety,
[01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:27.080]   and then people, you know-
[01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:27.920]   - Can't sleep.
[01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:29.040]   - Yeah, we're not gonna dissolve into a puddle
[01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:30.760]   of our own tears on one poor night's sleep.
[01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:34.920]   - Yeah, no, but it's also that if you can't,
[01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:38.480]   if you're not sleeping, what is the reason for that?
[01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:40.800]   And if you're stressed, you know,
[01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:43.360]   obviously it's the stress that's the problem,
[01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:45.480]   not the number of hours sleep you're getting.
[01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:47.480]   - Well, I always say, if you're gonna get less
[01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:50.600]   than your typical or required night's sleep,
[01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:51.800]   hopefully it's for good reasons.
[01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:52.960]   Hopefully you're having a good time.
[01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:55.800]   It's when you get a fire alarm in the middle of the night
[01:01:55.800 --> 01:01:58.640]   that it becomes, as you said, stressful.
[01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:00.760]   I'd like to just briefly go back
[01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:03.440]   to the counter-clockwise study.
[01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:04.680]   Could you describe a little bit more
[01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:08.160]   about the practical aspects of that study?
[01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:11.000]   So these were people who, let's say,
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:12.600]   were on average, how old?
[01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:14.440]   Was it somewhere between like 30 and 50?
[01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:15.920]   - No, no, no, no, no.
[01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:19.000]   Counter-clockwise, no, these were people who were 80.
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:20.720]   - Oh, 80, okay, excuse me.
[01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:25.720]   - But also that was when 80 was 80, not the new 60.
[01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:26.880]   They were old.
[01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:29.480]   In fact, I remember when we were interviewing,
[01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:30.640]   I was interviewing people
[01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:31.960]   to see if they could be in the study.
[01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:35.280]   So they're down the hall, I'm in my office,
[01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:39.560]   and I see them, and they look like
[01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:42.080]   they're not gonna make it down the hall to the office.
[01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:45.280]   And I'm saying to myself, why am I doing this?
[01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:47.160]   That I'm taking on too much.
[01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:50.840]   I, in fact, had I realized all the responsibility
[01:02:50.840 --> 01:02:53.720]   at that point that I was actually assuming,
[01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:54.800]   I probably wouldn't have done it.
[01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:57.040]   I mean, I was in charge of these people's lives,
[01:02:57.040 --> 01:03:00.360]   everything about them for this five days
[01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:01.600]   without knowing these people,
[01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:04.840]   without a full medical support system or whatever.
[01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:06.000]   - Yeah, if one or two of them had died,
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:07.440]   you could end up in a mess.
[01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:10.600]   - Yeah, so I was fortunate that none of that happened.
[01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:12.320]   But no, so they were old.
[01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:16.840]   And it was interesting because they show up
[01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:21.840]   and they look really, now it'd probably be somebody 105.
[01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:23.960]   - Wow. - That's the way
[01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:25.400]   they present it.
[01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:28.400]   And you'd have, you'd speak to the person
[01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:31.640]   and usually the adult daughter would do the answering
[01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:34.600]   rather than, so they were coddled,
[01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:39.600]   they were presumed to have all sorts of problems and so on.
[01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:45.280]   Almost instantly when they got there, they changed.
[01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:47.640]   The feeling was almost palpable.
[01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:50.360]   Now I did this thing, it wasn't good science,
[01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:54.520]   but so the first group that we took there
[01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:56.520]   was the reminiscent group.
[01:03:56.520 --> 01:03:58.920]   This was a group where they were going
[01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:01.400]   to reminisce for that week.
[01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:05.280]   So they always knew now was now and then was then, right?
[01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:07.560]   That was a control group.
[01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:11.120]   We get to the retreat and I'm in this van.
[01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:13.520]   Oh, people need to understand,
[01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:17.280]   the study was back before Google,
[01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:19.560]   before we had the internet.
[01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:24.560]   So when I am playing music in the van going to the event,
[01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:28.240]   music from the past, this was a major thing to find this.
[01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:31.960]   Now it takes two minutes, you ask Chad lately.
[01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:35.480]   Give me the 10 best songs back 20 years ago.
[01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:40.480]   At any rate, so I'm on the bus with them,
[01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:43.160]   music playing from the past playing.
[01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:44.960]   We get very close to the retreat
[01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:49.320]   and all of a sudden I realize that I was sexist at the time,
[01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:54.320]   oblivious, that none of my male graduate students
[01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:56.000]   were with me.
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.520]   That meant I had seven old men
[01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:00.880]   and at least seven heavy suitcases.
[01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:04.440]   There was no way I was going to carry
[01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:06.400]   their suitcases upstairs.
[01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:11.400]   So unplanned for, we get off the bus and I say,
[01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:13.600]   you're in charge of your own suitcase.
[01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:16.600]   I don't care if you move it an inch at a time
[01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:19.480]   to get it to your room or you unpack it here
[01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:22.120]   a shirt at a time, however you want to do it.
[01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:25.240]   Now imagine nothing else, the difference
[01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:27.360]   between somebody who's cuddled,
[01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:30.880]   who is not even thought to be able to respond to a question
[01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:34.960]   where the daughter or son would answer for them
[01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:38.800]   to now they're in charge of their whole lives.
[01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:43.360]   And that meant that even the comparison group
[01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:45.800]   was going to do well, which they did,
[01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:48.240]   just not quite as well as the other group.
[01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:51.400]   And for me, that was fine because as you mentioned before,
[01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:53.520]   my work is all about possibility.
[01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:56.320]   I'm not interested in describing what is.
[01:05:56.320 --> 01:06:00.240]   I'm interested in seeing what may be.
[01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:05.240]   So if I got one monkey to say,
[01:06:05.240 --> 01:06:07.880]   "Hey, Ellen, that's nonsense."
[01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:11.640]   That would be fine if we couldn't train the rest of them.
[01:06:11.640 --> 01:06:15.040]   But it would lead us to different views of language.
[01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:18.520]   - I love this approach to science of seeing what may be.
[01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:20.480]   I have to say, there's this little script running
[01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:23.240]   in the back of my mind and now I'm not gonna judge it.
[01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:27.200]   The sorts of experiments and the general line of inquiry
[01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:30.640]   that you've been involved in for some time now
[01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:36.280]   to me runs countercurrent to my perception of,
[01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:38.560]   I'm just gonna be honest 'cause I'm a West Coast guy,
[01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:41.880]   the Harvard campus and the idea
[01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:44.080]   that science is done in a particular way.
[01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:48.920]   A very brief anecdote, the folks that founded
[01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:51.760]   at the Esalen Institute in Big Sur
[01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:54.320]   were at Stanford at one point, they weren't professors,
[01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:56.800]   but there's a story and I believe the story
[01:06:56.800 --> 01:06:59.160]   that they had proposed at that time,
[01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:01.760]   a class on mindfulness and breathing
[01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:05.000]   to bring Stan Graf through and some other people.
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:08.360]   And this was probably the late '70s, early '80s.
[01:07:08.360 --> 01:07:11.680]   And whatever the cultural norms were
[01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:13.480]   at Stanford at that time,
[01:07:13.480 --> 01:07:15.680]   they claim they were basically run off campus,
[01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:16.920]   went and started Esalen.
[01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:18.000]   I don't know if it's a true story,
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:19.400]   but I like the story anyway.
[01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:24.000]   My lab at Stanford ran a study on particular patterns
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:25.520]   of breathing along with David Spiegel
[01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:29.640]   and how it can be used to self adjust stress levels
[01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:30.520]   and reduce stress levels.
[01:07:30.520 --> 01:07:32.680]   Okay, and nowadays there's grants given
[01:07:32.680 --> 01:07:34.600]   for this kind of stuff and meditation.
[01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:36.080]   So there's been a huge shift
[01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:39.000]   in the academic cultural milieu.
[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:43.080]   But given that you've been running these sorts of,
[01:07:43.080 --> 01:07:46.040]   seeing what may be types of studies for a number of years
[01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:49.280]   at a campus that I consider is more kind of like
[01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:52.680]   East Coast dyed in the wool notions of how science is done.
[01:07:52.680 --> 01:07:57.320]   I wanna know, A, how was it received early on?
[01:07:57.320 --> 01:07:59.400]   B, did you care?
[01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:02.680]   C, is it in your nature and has it always been
[01:08:02.680 --> 01:08:05.600]   in your nature to kind of test the elements?
[01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:07.840]   Because I sense, but I could be completely wrong
[01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:09.600]   because I'm not a psychologist,
[01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:14.440]   that you delight in kind of not poking the bear,
[01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:18.240]   but playing with ideas that are kind of heretical.
[01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:21.720]   Well, I would use the methods of the field.
[01:08:21.720 --> 01:08:23.800]   It was just the questions that were different.
[01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:27.600]   So they weren't seen to be quite as different
[01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:29.560]   as you're suggesting.
[01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:31.480]   Did any of your colleagues think like-
[01:08:31.480 --> 01:08:32.400]   No.
[01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:33.240]   Great, okay.
[01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:34.080]   No.
[01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:35.920]   I love hearing that 'cause it shatters my notions
[01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:38.360]   of kind of East Coast Ivy League academia.
[01:08:38.360 --> 01:08:40.600]   To me, I mean, perhaps behind my back, but-
[01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:41.840]   Well, clearly it's worked out.
[01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:44.280]   And nowadays, there are multiple labs at Harvard
[01:08:44.280 --> 01:08:47.080]   working on happiness, working on mindfulness.
[01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:50.160]   And I mean, you've pioneered an entire field in a way.
[01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:53.160]   But I'm more interested in the way of thinking
[01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:54.200]   that was it-
[01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:56.040]   Well, so it's interesting.
[01:08:56.040 --> 01:08:57.880]   Eight year old Ellen Langer, like,
[01:08:57.880 --> 01:09:01.360]   well, maybe cookies are the nutritious stuff.
[01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:02.320]   No, I understand.
[01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:05.680]   So I seem to be, you know,
[01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:07.240]   come hell or high water, I'm gonna do it.
[01:09:07.240 --> 01:09:08.640]   I'm not like that at all.
[01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:09.480]   Interesting.
[01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:10.840]   More now that I'm older.
[01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:12.840]   But I tell a story.
[01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:14.360]   I don't remember what the point of it,
[01:09:14.360 --> 01:09:17.760]   the exact point was in the mindful body
[01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:19.520]   where I'm at the dentist.
[01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:20.360]   I'm a little kid.
[01:09:20.360 --> 01:09:21.640]   I don't remember how old.
[01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:23.720]   And I remember my mother came in
[01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:27.000]   and the dentist told my mother what a good patient I was.
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.120]   And all I remember was my saying,
[01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:31.520]   "What were the other kids doing?"
[01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:34.480]   You know, so it wasn't as if I made a choice.
[01:09:34.480 --> 01:09:36.120]   I could do this or I could do, you know,
[01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:37.840]   it never occurred to me.
[01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:41.200]   And so lots of these ideas, you know,
[01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:43.960]   are not against or what, you know,
[01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:45.200]   I don't know where they come from.
[01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:47.120]   I know Lee Ross when, you know,
[01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:49.680]   so Lee was a professor at Stanford.
[01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:52.040]   And I remember having a conversation where he said,
[01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:54.760]   "Ellen, you know, you're from Mars."
[01:09:54.760 --> 01:09:56.920]   And I said, "I'm not so different."
[01:09:56.920 --> 01:09:59.160]   He says, "Okay, so you're a normal,
[01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:02.400]   not an exceptional Martian, but you're still a Martian."
[01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:07.320]   And then a colleague had a conversation with,
[01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:08.700]   and I was flattered by this,
[01:10:08.700 --> 01:10:11.200]   but I think it wasn't meant to be flattering
[01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:13.360]   'cause they were worried what my reaction was,
[01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:17.000]   was that, you know, I'm from a different time.
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:22.920]   And, you know, so that plays differently if you're aware.
[01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:25.920]   You know, so like when I started painting,
[01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:30.920]   you know, I was breaking the rules to some people's minds,
[01:10:30.920 --> 01:10:33.480]   but no, I didn't know the rule.
[01:10:33.480 --> 01:10:36.640]   And so I was just doing what felt natural.
[01:10:36.640 --> 01:10:39.600]   - Well, I have to introduce you to my good friend,
[01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:41.960]   Rick Rubin, who's been on this podcast a few times
[01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:43.840]   because he wrote "The Creative Act."
[01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:46.600]   He's basically, his life has been spent, you know,
[01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:49.440]   trying to pull out the best creative works from musicians
[01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:50.960]   and he's been involved in other things too.
[01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:52.560]   And he's just as a, you know,
[01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:55.240]   a kind of supernatural level of ability to do this.
[01:10:55.240 --> 01:10:58.320]   And he keeps coming back to this thing in our discussions,
[01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:00.720]   but also in his book and elsewhere
[01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:05.720]   about how the greatest impediment to the creative process
[01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:10.660]   is to think about the publicity or cultural milieu
[01:11:10.660 --> 01:11:11.780]   that it's going to exist in,
[01:11:11.780 --> 01:11:14.920]   that he really believes that these things are offerings
[01:11:14.920 --> 01:11:19.160]   to God, to the universe, to whatever that come through us.
[01:11:19.160 --> 01:11:22.780]   And that the barrier is the,
[01:11:22.780 --> 01:11:25.160]   it's almost like the self-awareness is the barrier.
[01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:28.600]   - So one of the earlier titles of "The Mindful Body"
[01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:30.440]   was "Who Says So?"
[01:11:30.440 --> 01:11:31.280]   - Love it.
[01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:34.080]   - And, you know, realizing that everything that is
[01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:37.140]   was at one point a decision made by people
[01:11:37.140 --> 01:11:39.240]   with different motives, different histories,
[01:11:39.240 --> 01:11:41.200]   different needs.
[01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:45.480]   And when you put people, as I say, back in the equation,
[01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:48.600]   everything becomes mutable, everything.
[01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:50.840]   You know, so, and so there are things,
[01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:54.000]   here's where I am different from many other people,
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.840]   for better or worse, I think in this case for better,
[01:11:56.840 --> 01:12:00.000]   you know, that I, everything can be changed.
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:01.840]   You know, you tell me you meet this, you know,
[01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:04.240]   this woman and she's too heavyweight can be lost,
[01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:07.280]   hair can be grown, everything can be changed.
[01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:10.440]   So I give a talk when I was very young
[01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:14.360]   and I'm here on the stage and, you know,
[01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:16.520]   the audience is all the way back here.
[01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:19.040]   And I knew that was gonna make me nervous.
[01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:23.700]   So what I did was move all the chairs to be closer to me.
[01:12:23.700 --> 01:12:27.160]   Now, if you said to anybody, can you move the chairs?
[01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:29.120]   Everybody would say, of course,
[01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:31.960]   but mindlessly it doesn't occur to you.
[01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:35.160]   It doesn't occur to you that what is
[01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:37.740]   doesn't have to be as it is.
[01:12:37.740 --> 01:12:40.200]   And it, you know, the older I get,
[01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:44.400]   the more malleable everything seems to be.
[01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:46.600]   Even a thing, you know, to go back,
[01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:49.680]   I don't know why this comes to mind, but it does.
[01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:53.060]   If an insurance company is making a decision
[01:12:53.060 --> 01:12:55.520]   about what drugs to insure.
[01:12:55.520 --> 01:12:58.440]   Now, who said that this disorder is better
[01:12:58.440 --> 01:12:59.920]   or more worthy than that disorder?
[01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:02.700]   I say, so these are people making this decision.
[01:13:02.700 --> 01:13:06.840]   So imagine that you have a group of nuns,
[01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:08.900]   they're the committee making the decision,
[01:13:08.900 --> 01:13:12.240]   versus a group of lusty 50-year-old men.
[01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:14.880]   And they're deciding whether people should be reimbursed
[01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:18.680]   for Viagra, for example.
[01:13:18.680 --> 01:13:20.760]   And that's what it's all about, you know,
[01:13:20.760 --> 01:13:23.220]   that when you recognize that whatever is
[01:13:23.220 --> 01:13:25.020]   could be different as meetings.
[01:13:25.020 --> 01:13:28.400]   And I deal with this when I give lectures.
[01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:30.900]   You know, at some point I might say,
[01:13:30.900 --> 01:13:34.200]   look in the audience and see if there's usually a man.
[01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:35.280]   Is there a man here?
[01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:37.040]   It's about 6'5".
[01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:39.040]   Somebody always there, I don't know why.
[01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:43.160]   6'5" men find me attractive, I don't know what.
[01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:44.720]   Anyway, I invite him to the stage
[01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:46.240]   and then we look ridiculous.
[01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:48.780]   I'm 5'3", he's 6'5".
[01:13:48.780 --> 01:13:51.680]   And I ask him to put his hand, I put his hand up.
[01:13:51.680 --> 01:13:53.560]   His hand is three inches larger than mine.
[01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:55.080]   And then I just raise the question,
[01:13:55.080 --> 01:13:58.540]   should we do anything physical the same?
[01:13:58.540 --> 01:14:00.560]   And it's ridiculous, you know.
[01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:03.660]   But one of us is teaching how to do it.
[01:14:03.660 --> 01:14:06.680]   You know, so the more different you are
[01:14:06.680 --> 01:14:08.860]   from the person who wrote the rule,
[01:14:08.860 --> 01:14:11.140]   the more important it is for you
[01:14:11.140 --> 01:14:14.260]   not to mindlessly follow the rule.
[01:14:14.260 --> 01:14:17.840]   So you don't hold the tennis racket like this
[01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:21.000]   if your hand is half the size of the person who,
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.960]   or twice the size, or anything else.
[01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:26.400]   And people don't realize it.
[01:14:26.400 --> 01:14:29.440]   That everything that is was a decision.
[01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:33.040]   For something to be a decision means there was uncertainty.
[01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:34.640]   As soon as the decision is made,
[01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:36.320]   we forget all that uncertainty
[01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:39.360]   and act as if this is the way it's supposed to be.
[01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:42.120]   An example I often use, you know, tennis.
[01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:45.280]   So you have, and everybody, when you think about this,
[01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:47.840]   and nobody's gonna argue, that, of course,
[01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:50.880]   the rules to tennis weren't handed down from the heavens.
[01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:54.420]   Somebody decided it should be two serves, and that's fine.
[01:14:54.420 --> 01:14:57.320]   But for me, three serves would be better.
[01:14:57.320 --> 01:14:59.920]   The first time, I kill it, doesn't go in.
[01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:02.000]   Now I'm afraid to try to kill it again
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.700]   and learn from that, 'cause I don't wanna double fold.
[01:15:04.700 --> 01:15:07.160]   So I have a little wuss second serve.
[01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:09.720]   By three serves, I kill it, it doesn't go in.
[01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:11.180]   Now I learn from that, I kill it again,
[01:15:11.180 --> 01:15:12.360]   but I'm getting a little better.
[01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:15.080]   And I still have my backup third serve.
[01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:17.000]   All right, so what is the point of that?
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:20.400]   That if I wrote the rules to the game,
[01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:23.280]   I would be a better tennis player.
[01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:26.880]   You would be better at whatever you're writing the rules to.
[01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:28.960]   So you think differently about yourself.
[01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:30.600]   You don't feel bad about it.
[01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:32.880]   In fact, you know, when people play tennis with me,
[01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:34.360]   we often play three serves.
[01:15:34.360 --> 01:15:35.200]   Why not?
[01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:39.040]   Everything about it is up for grabs.
[01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:42.320]   And, you know, so what happens is,
[01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:44.600]   the lower down you are on the totem pole,
[01:15:44.600 --> 01:15:48.700]   the fewer of these things, games, ways of being
[01:15:48.700 --> 01:15:51.360]   that you yourself have created,
[01:15:51.360 --> 01:15:55.240]   the more you're trying to fit yourself into some form
[01:15:55.240 --> 01:15:58.120]   that isn't so comfortable.
[01:15:58.120 --> 01:16:03.120]   So we need to appreciate that rules, laws, everything,
[01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:07.320]   is just somebody's decision about how things should be.
[01:16:07.320 --> 01:16:10.560]   And, you know, don't violate them purposely,
[01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:13.240]   but if they don't fit, you know,
[01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:17.320]   legality is not the same thing as morality, you know.
[01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:21.560]   By law, one was not allowed interracial marriage.
[01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:24.560]   By law, one was not allowed to be gay.
[01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:27.040]   By law, you know, so on and so forth.
[01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:30.400]   One wasn't allowed to drink at one point, and so on.
[01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:31.720]   These are not moral issues.
[01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:34.600]   These are a group of people who are making a decision
[01:16:34.600 --> 01:16:36.680]   for the rest of us.
[01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:38.800]   If it doesn't hurt, fine.
[01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:43.800]   But, you know, if it does, fight it, deviate,
[01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:45.920]   at least live the life you want to live.
[01:16:45.920 --> 01:16:49.200]   - I'd like to take a quick break
[01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:51.960]   and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Function.
[01:16:51.960 --> 01:16:53.560]   Last year, I became a Function member
[01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:55.860]   after searching for the most comprehensive approach
[01:16:55.860 --> 01:16:57.320]   to lab testing.
[01:16:57.320 --> 01:17:00.280]   Function provides over 100 advanced lab tests
[01:17:00.280 --> 01:17:03.720]   that give you a key snapshot of your entire bodily health.
[01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:05.360]   This snapshot offers you with insights
[01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:07.160]   on your heart health, hormone health,
[01:17:07.160 --> 01:17:10.360]   immune functioning, nutrient levels, and much more.
[01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:12.400]   They've also recently added tests for toxins,
[01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:15.000]   such as BPA exposure from harmful plastics,
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.960]   and tests for PFASs, or forever chemicals.
[01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:19.520]   Function not only provides testing
[01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:21.720]   of over 100 biomarkers key to your physical
[01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:24.640]   and mental health, but it also analyzes these results
[01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:26.800]   and provides insights from top doctors
[01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:28.880]   who are expert in the relevant areas.
[01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:31.560]   For example, in one of my first tests with Function,
[01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:33.080]   I learned that I had elevated levels
[01:17:33.080 --> 01:17:34.680]   of mercury in my blood.
[01:17:34.680 --> 01:17:36.640]   Function not only helped me detect that,
[01:17:36.640 --> 01:17:38.160]   but offered insights into how best
[01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:39.720]   to reduce my mercury levels,
[01:17:39.720 --> 01:17:42.080]   which included limiting my tuna consumption,
[01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:43.520]   I'd been eating a lot of tuna,
[01:17:43.520 --> 01:17:45.720]   while also making an effort to eat more leafy greens
[01:17:45.720 --> 01:17:48.080]   and supplementing with NAC and acetylcysteine,
[01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:50.120]   both of which can support glutathione production
[01:17:50.120 --> 01:17:51.560]   and detoxification.
[01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:54.080]   And I should say, by taking a second Function test,
[01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:55.080]   that approach worked.
[01:17:55.080 --> 01:17:57.600]   Comprehensive blood testing is vitally important.
[01:17:57.600 --> 01:17:59.480]   There's so many things related to your mental
[01:17:59.480 --> 01:18:02.000]   and physical health that can only be detected
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:03.120]   in a blood test.
[01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:05.520]   The problem is blood testing has always been very expensive
[01:18:05.520 --> 01:18:06.560]   and complicated.
[01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:08.320]   In contrast, I've been super impressed
[01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:11.520]   by Function's simplicity and at the level of cost.
[01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:12.800]   It is very affordable.
[01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:13.640]   As a consequence,
[01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:15.960]   I decided to join their scientific advisory board
[01:18:15.960 --> 01:18:18.640]   and I'm thrilled that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:19.960]   If you'd like to try Function,
[01:18:19.960 --> 01:18:22.920]   you can go to functionhealth.com/huberman.
[01:18:22.920 --> 01:18:26.040]   Function currently has a wait list of over 250,000 people,
[01:18:26.040 --> 01:18:28.160]   but they're offering early access
[01:18:28.160 --> 01:18:29.860]   to Huberman podcast listeners.
[01:18:29.860 --> 01:18:33.120]   Again, that's functionhealth.com/huberman
[01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:35.760]   to get early access to Function.
[01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:38.160]   - I feel like one of the major detriments
[01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:41.880]   to living the way that you're describing,
[01:18:41.880 --> 01:18:46.380]   which by the way has tremendous gravitational pull
[01:18:46.380 --> 01:18:47.220]   in my mind.
[01:18:47.220 --> 01:18:50.440]   Like it's such a better way to go through life, right?
[01:18:50.440 --> 01:18:53.760]   And I subscribe also to this notion
[01:18:53.760 --> 01:18:56.120]   that pretty much everything was made up
[01:18:56.120 --> 01:18:58.240]   besides the laws of nature, right?
[01:18:58.240 --> 01:19:02.840]   I mean, to me, physics is real and chemistry is real.
[01:19:02.840 --> 01:19:04.760]   Biology gets, biology is real.
[01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:06.600]   It gets tricky because-
[01:19:06.600 --> 01:19:07.840]   - They're all real,
[01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:11.840]   but it's our understanding of them that varies.
[01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:15.160]   So we haven't worked out all of physics yet.
[01:19:15.160 --> 01:19:16.120]   - Sure.
[01:19:16.120 --> 01:19:18.280]   - Or biology or any of these other things.
[01:19:18.280 --> 01:19:21.080]   So I don't think that we should set these aside
[01:19:21.080 --> 01:19:25.560]   and say those rules we should follow come hell or high water.
[01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:28.160]   - Right, I mean, seeing what may be,
[01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:29.940]   like, I mean, I could say, listen,
[01:19:29.940 --> 01:19:33.100]   because of the laws of gravity, objects fall down, not up.
[01:19:33.100 --> 01:19:36.800]   But of course, we could create exceptions to that,
[01:19:36.800 --> 01:19:41.400]   but that humans make up all sorts of rules.
[01:19:41.400 --> 01:19:44.640]   Culture dictates, group think dictates.
[01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:46.920]   And it seems that one of the major detriments
[01:19:46.920 --> 01:19:49.000]   to living in this freer way,
[01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:52.200]   this more exploratory way that we're talking about today
[01:19:52.200 --> 01:19:54.480]   is this whole thing of theory of mind,
[01:19:54.480 --> 01:19:58.520]   that we are able for better or worse
[01:19:58.520 --> 01:20:00.240]   to get into the minds of others.
[01:20:00.240 --> 01:20:03.700]   And in some cases, create ideas, true or not,
[01:20:03.700 --> 01:20:07.420]   about how you will be judged if we do A, B, or C.
[01:20:07.420 --> 01:20:11.040]   And in doing so, we give up some real estate.
[01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:12.560]   We give up some--
[01:20:12.560 --> 01:20:15.500]   - See, that's, okay, so that's perfect, Andrew,
[01:20:15.500 --> 01:20:18.180]   because we think we know,
[01:20:18.180 --> 01:20:21.140]   but are oblivious to the fact that everything,
[01:20:21.140 --> 01:20:23.100]   everything, it's a big statement,
[01:20:23.100 --> 01:20:26.960]   behavior can be understood in equal dimensions,
[01:20:26.960 --> 01:20:30.260]   equal potency as good or bad.
[01:20:30.260 --> 01:20:33.260]   Now, so that I can control what you're thinking.
[01:20:33.260 --> 01:20:35.500]   So you think that I'm gullible.
[01:20:35.500 --> 01:20:37.820]   You could persuade me that I'm gullible.
[01:20:37.820 --> 01:20:41.160]   I can try my hardest not to be gullible,
[01:20:41.160 --> 01:20:43.660]   but I'm going to eventually be gullible.
[01:20:43.660 --> 01:20:47.020]   And the reason for that is that I value being trusting.
[01:20:47.020 --> 01:20:50.100]   And as long as I value being trusting,
[01:20:50.100 --> 01:20:52.180]   I'm going to be seen as gullible.
[01:20:52.180 --> 01:20:54.660]   As long as you value being flexible,
[01:20:54.660 --> 01:20:56.580]   you're going to be inconsistent.
[01:20:56.580 --> 01:20:58.960]   As long as you value being stable,
[01:20:58.960 --> 01:21:02.040]   you're going to be seen as boring, and so on.
[01:21:02.040 --> 01:21:04.680]   And so this is what I said to you before
[01:21:04.680 --> 01:21:09.200]   in different terms, that with all that I've studied,
[01:21:09.200 --> 01:21:13.400]   found, found interesting over all these decades,
[01:21:13.400 --> 01:21:16.780]   the thing that meant the most to me was the realization
[01:21:16.780 --> 01:21:20.120]   that behavior makes sense from the actor's perspective,
[01:21:20.120 --> 01:21:22.140]   or the actor wouldn't do it.
[01:21:22.140 --> 01:21:23.560]   Now, if you think about that,
[01:21:23.560 --> 01:21:27.200]   that means every single time you're demeaning somebody,
[01:21:27.200 --> 01:21:30.160]   or yourself, or you're coming up
[01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:32.300]   with a New Year's resolution,
[01:21:32.300 --> 01:21:35.000]   what you're doing is denying the sense
[01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.280]   of what you were doing and saying,
[01:21:37.280 --> 01:21:39.800]   "Oh, you should have done something different."
[01:21:39.800 --> 01:21:41.640]   Okay.
[01:21:41.640 --> 01:21:47.120]   Once you realize that your behavior makes sense,
[01:21:47.120 --> 01:21:49.400]   you like yourself more,
[01:21:49.400 --> 01:21:53.400]   when you're realizing that in any relationship,
[01:21:53.400 --> 01:21:56.040]   anything that's difficult is difficult
[01:21:56.040 --> 01:21:58.400]   because one of you thinks there's a right way
[01:21:58.400 --> 01:22:00.920]   and is denying the other person's perspective.
[01:22:00.920 --> 01:22:03.060]   We did this thing so many years ago.
[01:22:03.060 --> 01:22:06.280]   I gave people a list of,
[01:22:06.280 --> 01:22:09.840]   I don't remember, it was 200 or 300 behavior descriptions.
[01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:12.760]   It said, "Circle those things about yourself
[01:22:12.760 --> 01:22:15.800]   "that you keep trying to change, but you keep failing at."
[01:22:15.800 --> 01:22:20.320]   So for me, I'd circle impulsive, gullible,
[01:22:20.320 --> 01:22:21.800]   but I won't tell you the rest.
[01:22:21.800 --> 01:22:24.040]   Okay, then you turn the page over
[01:22:24.040 --> 01:22:26.720]   and in a mixed up random order
[01:22:26.720 --> 01:22:29.480]   are the positive versions of each of these.
[01:22:29.480 --> 01:22:30.840]   Now people are asked,
[01:22:30.840 --> 01:22:33.760]   "Circle those things you really value about yourself,
[01:22:33.760 --> 01:22:37.880]   "my spontaneity and my being trusting.
[01:22:37.880 --> 01:22:40.980]   "And as long as I value being spontaneous,
[01:22:40.980 --> 01:22:45.500]   "I'm going to appear impulsive," and so on.
[01:22:45.500 --> 01:22:48.560]   And so now that I have more respect for myself
[01:22:48.560 --> 01:22:50.400]   because what I did made sense,
[01:22:50.400 --> 01:22:53.200]   I carry myself differently.
[01:22:53.200 --> 01:22:56.880]   I'm not doing what you were just suggesting before
[01:22:56.880 --> 01:22:59.880]   where I'm tormenting myself and so on.
[01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:03.400]   And the people I'm with,
[01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:07.960]   there's a lot in the mindful body that deals with language
[01:23:07.960 --> 01:23:12.960]   and only a fraction of the sensitivity I seem to have
[01:23:12.960 --> 01:23:15.280]   to language in a different way
[01:23:15.280 --> 01:23:17.240]   from the way linguists would study it.
[01:23:18.500 --> 01:23:20.180]   But you have things,
[01:23:20.180 --> 01:23:22.840]   let's say forgiveness.
[01:23:22.840 --> 01:23:25.640]   We have all these terms that seem good.
[01:23:25.640 --> 01:23:28.480]   And you know, because you figured me out now
[01:23:28.480 --> 01:23:30.760]   that if you say it's good, I'm gonna find a way it's bad.
[01:23:30.760 --> 01:23:32.320]   If you say it's bad, I'm gonna, good.
[01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:35.080]   Okay, so this is one of those.
[01:23:35.080 --> 01:23:37.600]   I don't want anybody,
[01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:41.980]   certainly not the person closest to me to ever forgive me.
[01:23:41.980 --> 01:23:45.840]   I want to be understood.
[01:23:45.840 --> 01:23:49.100]   And if you understand, there's no reason to forgive me
[01:23:49.100 --> 01:23:50.900]   because my behavior will make sense
[01:23:50.900 --> 01:23:52.880]   or else I wouldn't do it.
[01:23:52.880 --> 01:23:55.700]   Okay, so how did this come about?
[01:23:55.700 --> 01:23:57.840]   I was asked to give a sermon.
[01:23:57.840 --> 01:24:01.100]   Sermon, I'm Jewish, I have to go to this church
[01:24:01.100 --> 01:24:02.660]   'cause I say yes to everything
[01:24:02.660 --> 01:24:04.500]   and I'm gonna give a sermon.
[01:24:04.500 --> 01:24:05.580]   What am I gonna talk about?
[01:24:05.580 --> 01:24:07.100]   I know nothing about religion.
[01:24:07.100 --> 01:24:11.940]   Forgiveness, it's not religion, but it sounds religiousy.
[01:24:11.940 --> 01:24:13.380]   All right, I'll think about forgiveness.
[01:24:13.380 --> 01:24:16.180]   I think about forgiveness and what I came up with
[01:24:16.180 --> 01:24:19.320]   was sacrilegious, some would think.
[01:24:19.320 --> 01:24:22.680]   If you ask 10 people, is forgiveness good or bad,
[01:24:22.680 --> 01:24:23.680]   what are they gonna tell you?
[01:24:23.680 --> 01:24:24.520]   - They're gonna tell you it's good.
[01:24:24.520 --> 01:24:25.340]   - It's good.
[01:24:25.340 --> 01:24:28.240]   If you ask 10 people, is blame good or bad,
[01:24:28.240 --> 01:24:29.480]   what are they gonna say?
[01:24:29.480 --> 01:24:30.320]   It's bad.
[01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:33.880]   But you know, you can't forgive unless you first blame.
[01:24:33.880 --> 01:24:36.020]   So our forgivers are our blamers.
[01:24:36.020 --> 01:24:37.380]   That's interesting.
[01:24:37.380 --> 01:24:40.720]   Now, do you blame people for good things or bad things?
[01:24:40.720 --> 01:24:42.660]   You blame people for bad things,
[01:24:42.660 --> 01:24:45.440]   but things in and of themselves aren't good or bad.
[01:24:45.440 --> 01:24:48.720]   So what happens is the people who see the world negatively,
[01:24:48.720 --> 01:24:52.980]   who blame, then forgive, hardly divine.
[01:24:52.980 --> 01:24:57.280]   Now, if you blame, it's better to forgive than not forgive.
[01:24:57.280 --> 01:25:00.380]   But if you understand why the person did what they did,
[01:25:00.380 --> 01:25:03.160]   it obviates the necessity for blame,
[01:25:03.160 --> 01:25:07.080]   which then obviates the necessity for forgiveness.
[01:25:07.080 --> 01:25:09.060]   - I'd love to bypass blame.
[01:25:09.060 --> 01:25:10.480]   - Yeah, well, that's, you know,
[01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:13.920]   I think that's the way to do it is to recognize
[01:25:13.920 --> 01:25:18.920]   in a more open-minded way the motivations
[01:25:18.920 --> 01:25:23.000]   that people have vary, the consequences.
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.200]   You know, no matter what you do,
[01:25:25.200 --> 01:25:28.040]   whatever negative thing it seems,
[01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:31.400]   they're, you know, positive things will follow
[01:25:31.400 --> 01:25:35.080]   if you allow them and you look at it that way.
[01:25:35.080 --> 01:25:35.920]   - Can I ask you to--
[01:25:35.920 --> 01:25:36.980]   - No.
[01:25:36.980 --> 01:25:38.280]   Oh, that's right, it's your podcast.
[01:25:38.280 --> 01:25:39.120]   Yes, you can.
[01:25:39.120 --> 01:25:40.200]   - It's definitely not my podcast.
[01:25:40.200 --> 01:25:41.220]   We're here together.
[01:25:41.220 --> 01:25:45.360]   Could I ask you for any reflections
[01:25:45.360 --> 01:25:49.160]   that come up around this recent thought train I was on?
[01:25:49.160 --> 01:25:55.520]   I was laughing at the fact that our species,
[01:25:55.520 --> 01:25:58.480]   for whatever reason,
[01:25:58.480 --> 01:26:02.200]   seems to keep wanting to build technologies,
[01:26:02.200 --> 01:26:04.760]   and that much of our effort these days
[01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:07.360]   is focused on trying to undo some of the ills
[01:26:07.360 --> 01:26:09.160]   of the technologies that we've developed.
[01:26:09.160 --> 01:26:11.420]   So I use smartphones and I love them,
[01:26:11.420 --> 01:26:12.480]   and I use social media,
[01:26:12.480 --> 01:26:13.960]   and I think it's terrific for certain things.
[01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:15.480]   But of course, these things have issues,
[01:26:15.480 --> 01:26:17.420]   just like the automobile created issues,
[01:26:17.420 --> 01:26:19.680]   the television created issues, and on and on.
[01:26:19.680 --> 01:26:23.280]   Okay, fossil fuels and all of this.
[01:26:23.280 --> 01:26:25.040]   People will debate fossil fuels, but anyway,
[01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:25.880]   you get the point.
[01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:28.780]   Every technology brings with it some convenience
[01:26:28.780 --> 01:26:31.420]   or some way that humans have been able
[01:26:31.420 --> 01:26:35.240]   to overcome nature in some way or work with nature, right?
[01:26:35.240 --> 01:26:37.880]   You know, we can't fly, so we build planes.
[01:26:37.880 --> 01:26:39.600]   Okay.
[01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:42.000]   And I just decided to look at this through a different lens.
[01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:45.160]   Like, this is amazing.
[01:26:45.160 --> 01:26:46.720]   We're sending rockets into space.
[01:26:46.720 --> 01:26:49.000]   We'll probably colonize Mars not too long from now
[01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:50.400]   if Elon figures it out.
[01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:51.760]   I get the sense he probably will.
[01:26:51.760 --> 01:26:53.780]   We've got AI just this last week.
[01:26:53.780 --> 01:26:55.680]   There's this whole AI thing.
[01:26:55.680 --> 01:26:57.280]   And so then I started thinking like,
[01:26:57.280 --> 01:27:00.320]   you know, at what point do we just kind of stop?
[01:27:00.320 --> 01:27:01.560]   And the answer is pretty clear.
[01:27:01.560 --> 01:27:03.480]   It's unlikely that humans are ever going to stop
[01:27:03.480 --> 01:27:07.080]   this kind of itch to develop technology.
[01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:09.440]   And I thought, wow, you know,
[01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:12.240]   like we're the only species that does this.
[01:27:12.240 --> 01:27:13.880]   Like, you know, if the raccoons get together
[01:27:13.880 --> 01:27:16.080]   and they think, okay, like, let's figure out
[01:27:16.080 --> 01:27:18.760]   how to pick locks, like actually how to pick locks,
[01:27:18.760 --> 01:27:20.760]   as opposed to just go in through crawl spaces.
[01:27:20.760 --> 01:27:21.720]   If they've been working on that,
[01:27:21.720 --> 01:27:24.120]   they're still failing miserably, right?
[01:27:24.120 --> 01:27:25.600]   As far as I know.
[01:27:25.600 --> 01:27:28.560]   So it's something so unique to our species
[01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:31.040]   among the old world primates to develop technologies.
[01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:32.440]   Other animals do it.
[01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:33.320]   Crows do it.
[01:27:33.320 --> 01:27:34.300]   Other primates do it.
[01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:39.320]   But we, I mean, we are really the utmost example of this.
[01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:42.880]   And I just wondered, like,
[01:27:42.880 --> 01:27:44.720]   what do you think the human compulsion is
[01:27:44.720 --> 01:27:46.120]   to develop technologies?
[01:27:46.120 --> 01:27:47.560]   - I don't think there is a compulsion
[01:27:47.560 --> 01:27:49.720]   to develop anything in particular.
[01:27:49.720 --> 01:27:51.720]   I think there's a compulsion to develop.
[01:27:51.720 --> 01:27:53.440]   There's a compulsion.
[01:27:53.440 --> 01:27:57.120]   I wouldn't call it compulsion because that sounds negative.
[01:27:57.120 --> 01:27:58.560]   But I think that-
[01:27:58.560 --> 01:27:59.400]   - A drive.
[01:27:59.400 --> 01:28:00.240]   - Yeah.
[01:28:00.240 --> 01:28:03.800]   I mean, all mindfulness is is noticing new things,
[01:28:03.800 --> 01:28:06.020]   creating new things.
[01:28:06.020 --> 01:28:09.420]   With that creation, we're maximally alive.
[01:28:09.420 --> 01:28:12.940]   And so if we happen to be on the technology train,
[01:28:12.940 --> 01:28:17.160]   then it's technology that's going to get our attention.
[01:28:17.160 --> 01:28:21.440]   The people who are in other areas,
[01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:23.220]   whether it's creating music,
[01:28:23.220 --> 01:28:26.020]   doing what you and I do,
[01:28:26.020 --> 01:28:28.740]   it doesn't seem to me any different in principle.
[01:28:28.740 --> 01:28:29.820]   - What do you think that's about?
[01:28:29.820 --> 01:28:32.220]   I'm not asking us to go into evolutionary psychology,
[01:28:32.220 --> 01:28:34.180]   but what do you think it is that humans
[01:28:34.180 --> 01:28:38.540]   have this generative spirit in their mind-body,
[01:28:38.540 --> 01:28:39.380]   the same thing,
[01:28:39.380 --> 01:28:43.140]   to express and to create things
[01:28:43.140 --> 01:28:44.740]   that have some durability in time
[01:28:44.740 --> 01:28:47.500]   or that are just an expression of where we are?
[01:28:47.500 --> 01:28:48.980]   I mean, it's so unusual.
[01:28:48.980 --> 01:28:53.980]   - But I don't think that it's durability is what matters.
[01:28:53.980 --> 01:28:56.580]   I think then that becomes a social construction.
[01:28:56.580 --> 01:29:01.380]   What is the group, the Asians,
[01:29:01.380 --> 01:29:04.300]   the monks who are going to create art.
[01:29:04.300 --> 01:29:06.020]   And as soon as it's finished,
[01:29:06.020 --> 01:29:07.540]   then you bring it down to the water
[01:29:07.540 --> 01:29:11.100]   and to show that nothing lasts.
[01:29:11.100 --> 01:29:14.140]   - Yeah, sandcastle no selfie, I call it.
[01:29:14.140 --> 01:29:15.660]   Sandcastle no selfie.
[01:29:15.660 --> 01:29:16.860]   You're just doing it to do it.
[01:29:16.860 --> 01:29:19.100]   I actually do a lot of writing these days,
[01:29:19.100 --> 01:29:21.460]   like in my brain, I've always called sandcastle no selfie.
[01:29:21.460 --> 01:29:23.420]   Like it's getting washed away.
[01:29:23.420 --> 01:29:24.860]   And then someone says, well, you could take a photo of it.
[01:29:24.860 --> 01:29:27.860]   It's like, nope, actually, I just do it just to see.
[01:29:27.860 --> 01:29:30.140]   It's just a practice of getting out
[01:29:30.140 --> 01:29:31.980]   what I feel I need to get out.
[01:29:31.980 --> 01:29:34.300]   - Well, so for my mindfulness book,
[01:29:34.300 --> 01:29:36.500]   which I wrote way back when,
[01:29:36.500 --> 01:29:40.020]   the secretary I had then was a wonderful guy,
[01:29:40.020 --> 01:29:43.740]   but didn't know anything about computers and I knew less.
[01:29:43.740 --> 01:29:46.300]   And so I would give him something and I'd say,
[01:29:46.300 --> 01:29:49.460]   insert this page 20, whatever.
[01:29:49.460 --> 01:29:52.420]   And he would just sort of randomly,
[01:29:52.420 --> 01:29:54.740]   'cause he didn't know what he was doing either.
[01:29:54.740 --> 01:29:59.740]   And then at some point he lost an entire draft of the book.
[01:30:00.580 --> 01:30:02.700]   I sort of imagine, you know,
[01:30:02.700 --> 01:30:07.260]   and my first thought was probably more typical
[01:30:07.260 --> 01:30:08.900]   than my second thought, which is to go crazy.
[01:30:08.900 --> 01:30:10.460]   Oh my God, you know?
[01:30:10.460 --> 01:30:11.660]   And then I said to myself,
[01:30:11.660 --> 01:30:14.500]   what makes me think that that draft was better
[01:30:14.500 --> 01:30:17.580]   than the next draft that I can come up with?
[01:30:17.580 --> 01:30:20.740]   You know, in some sense, a version of your, who cares?
[01:30:20.740 --> 01:30:23.700]   And then I just started working on it again.
[01:30:23.700 --> 01:30:26.020]   You know, at some point
[01:30:26.020 --> 01:30:27.900]   when you're writing these research papers,
[01:30:27.900 --> 01:30:30.940]   I think most people come to the point where,
[01:30:30.940 --> 01:30:32.740]   first numbers count, right?
[01:30:32.740 --> 01:30:34.060]   How many publications?
[01:30:34.060 --> 01:30:36.860]   Then at some point the game changes
[01:30:36.860 --> 01:30:40.900]   and you don't care about the number and that's freeing.
[01:30:40.900 --> 01:30:44.660]   And so it seems a little similar.
[01:30:44.660 --> 01:30:47.540]   I think that for people to recognize
[01:30:47.540 --> 01:30:50.340]   that that excitement can be gotten,
[01:30:50.340 --> 01:30:52.940]   the threading of the needle, as I said before,
[01:30:52.940 --> 01:30:57.380]   would make much of life feel different.
[01:30:57.380 --> 01:30:59.660]   You know, so we did,
[01:30:59.660 --> 01:31:03.100]   this is gonna seem strange kind of answer here,
[01:31:03.100 --> 01:31:07.620]   but we took people who didn't like rap music,
[01:31:07.620 --> 01:31:09.940]   people who didn't like football,
[01:31:09.940 --> 01:31:11.500]   people who didn't like art.
[01:31:11.500 --> 01:31:13.660]   Okay, so a lot of haters.
[01:31:13.660 --> 01:31:15.340]   People don't like anything.
[01:31:15.340 --> 01:31:18.140]   One group is just given the activity.
[01:31:18.140 --> 01:31:21.820]   The next group is asked to notice one new thing about it.
[01:31:21.820 --> 01:31:24.100]   The next group, three new things about it.
[01:31:24.100 --> 01:31:25.660]   - They're doing it or observing it?
[01:31:25.660 --> 01:31:27.540]   - Well, if it's football, they're observing.
[01:31:27.540 --> 01:31:29.980]   It doesn't matter if you're observing the rear ends
[01:31:29.980 --> 01:31:33.260]   of the football players, just noticing new things.
[01:31:33.260 --> 01:31:34.660]   And the more you notice,
[01:31:34.660 --> 01:31:36.980]   the more you like what you're noticing.
[01:31:36.980 --> 01:31:39.820]   And to recognize that that's how simple it is.
[01:31:39.820 --> 01:31:42.460]   Now, most people, especially when you're younger,
[01:31:42.460 --> 01:31:44.940]   you're waiting for something to pull you,
[01:31:44.940 --> 01:31:47.900]   something to grab me and get me all excited.
[01:31:47.900 --> 01:31:50.580]   And how freeing if people were taught
[01:31:50.580 --> 01:31:54.420]   that you could grab it, whatever the it is,
[01:31:54.420 --> 01:31:56.020]   just by noticing.
[01:31:56.020 --> 01:32:00.340]   You don't have to hold on to the thing you're holding on to
[01:32:00.340 --> 01:32:01.980]   when you're recognizing
[01:32:01.980 --> 01:32:03.660]   that you could hold on to the next thing.
[01:32:03.660 --> 01:32:06.900]   I saw this Seinfeld, this was so funny, I thought,
[01:32:06.900 --> 01:32:08.340]   must've been old Seinfeld.
[01:32:08.340 --> 01:32:12.060]   He, after the show, he does a five minute standup.
[01:32:12.060 --> 01:32:16.660]   And I'm gonna not do it as well as he, but nor should I.
[01:32:16.660 --> 01:32:19.180]   He says, "What is this thing with appetites?"
[01:32:19.180 --> 01:32:21.260]   You know, you go out to dinner and people say,
[01:32:21.260 --> 01:32:23.540]   "Don't eat the bread, you're gonna spoil your appetite."
[01:32:23.540 --> 01:32:25.140]   There's so many appetites.
[01:32:25.140 --> 01:32:27.900]   You spoil this one, there's another one right behind it.
[01:32:27.900 --> 01:32:31.180]   You know, and if you realize that that high,
[01:32:31.180 --> 01:32:34.780]   that total engagement, the passion you were feeling
[01:32:34.780 --> 01:32:39.780]   was not a result of anything particular about the person,
[01:32:39.780 --> 01:32:44.380]   the context, the context, how freeing it would be.
[01:32:44.380 --> 01:32:46.580]   It'd be easy to let things go
[01:32:46.580 --> 01:32:51.180]   knowing that you can have that, you know, a moment later.
[01:32:51.180 --> 01:32:52.900]   - This is why at some point in my life,
[01:32:52.900 --> 01:32:57.460]   I'm going to tell my team six months and I'm done,
[01:32:57.460 --> 01:32:59.760]   and I'm gonna go do art.
[01:32:59.760 --> 01:33:03.260]   And I just don't wanna scare anybody.
[01:33:03.260 --> 01:33:07.380]   But I just, I love the idea of being able to switch venue
[01:33:07.380 --> 01:33:12.220]   and possibly to even change identity,
[01:33:12.220 --> 01:33:14.900]   which is something I'd like to talk to you about.
[01:33:14.900 --> 01:33:17.140]   - Well, the art is kind of interesting, you know,
[01:33:17.140 --> 01:33:19.980]   that I started painting when I was about 50.
[01:33:19.980 --> 01:33:23.060]   And I was one of those kids who couldn't draw.
[01:33:23.060 --> 01:33:25.940]   And I'm gonna have someone think of education.
[01:33:25.940 --> 01:33:28.380]   What mark might I have made on a page
[01:33:28.380 --> 01:33:31.500]   that would have led an elementary school teacher
[01:33:31.500 --> 01:33:36.500]   to lead me to believe that I had no artistic ability?
[01:33:36.500 --> 01:33:39.180]   When you think of a difference between a Mondrian
[01:33:39.180 --> 01:33:43.020]   or Rembrandt, you know, I mean, people so different
[01:33:43.020 --> 01:33:46.300]   that it's sinful for people to think
[01:33:46.300 --> 01:33:48.060]   they know how things should be
[01:33:48.100 --> 01:33:50.980]   so they know who can do it and who can't,
[01:33:50.980 --> 01:33:53.980]   as if there's only one way to do whatever it is.
[01:33:53.980 --> 01:33:58.380]   And I had this experience, and it was very clear in my mind.
[01:33:58.380 --> 01:34:00.140]   So I have this painting,
[01:34:00.140 --> 01:34:05.140]   and I have this friend who is an art collector.
[01:34:05.140 --> 01:34:06.900]   She drinks a little too much.
[01:34:06.900 --> 01:34:10.060]   She came over for a visit, and she saw the painting,
[01:34:10.060 --> 01:34:12.020]   a very early painting of mine.
[01:34:12.020 --> 01:34:14.100]   And she looks at it and just,
[01:34:14.100 --> 01:34:17.140]   "Ellen, there's something there."
[01:34:17.140 --> 01:34:18.540]   This is the important part, just,
[01:34:18.540 --> 01:34:21.580]   "Now, don't go thinking you're Rembrandt,"
[01:34:21.580 --> 01:34:24.020]   which wasn't nice, but she had a little too much,
[01:34:24.020 --> 01:34:25.140]   but it didn't matter.
[01:34:25.140 --> 01:34:28.180]   But my response was so important to me,
[01:34:28.180 --> 01:34:30.700]   I didn't say it 'cause I didn't think it would go over well,
[01:34:30.700 --> 01:34:33.860]   but I said, "And Rembrandt isn't me."
[01:34:33.860 --> 01:34:38.860]   Now, I would rather be the very best Ellen Langer
[01:34:38.860 --> 01:34:44.300]   than the 500,000th, 5 millionth, whatever, Rembrandt.
[01:34:44.300 --> 01:34:48.780]   And when you recognize that quality
[01:34:48.780 --> 01:34:50.860]   is a decision people are making,
[01:34:50.860 --> 01:34:53.220]   there is no absolute standard.
[01:34:53.220 --> 01:34:55.060]   You know, if you know anything about art,
[01:34:55.060 --> 01:34:57.740]   I mean, you know, let's take even the Impressionists,
[01:34:57.740 --> 01:34:59.900]   where people would pay so much money today,
[01:34:59.900 --> 01:35:02.140]   they were all rejected in their day.
[01:35:02.140 --> 01:35:07.260]   You know, when you realize that in some ways,
[01:35:07.260 --> 01:35:09.740]   and my work has suggested this to me,
[01:35:09.740 --> 01:35:12.740]   that if you're present when you're doing it,
[01:35:12.740 --> 01:35:14.340]   you're mindful when you're doing it,
[01:35:14.340 --> 01:35:19.340]   somehow that reveals itself in what you're doing.
[01:35:19.340 --> 01:35:22.780]   And whether or not it does,
[01:35:22.780 --> 01:35:25.180]   if you're putting yourself on that canvas,
[01:35:25.180 --> 01:35:28.940]   then it's great fun, it's exhilarating.
[01:35:28.940 --> 01:35:33.160]   And, you know, when somebody, you know,
[01:35:33.160 --> 01:35:38.960]   belittles it, it's strange to me.
[01:35:40.620 --> 01:35:43.740]   Where are those criteria coming from?
[01:35:43.740 --> 01:35:45.820]   No different from in schools.
[01:35:45.820 --> 01:35:48.820]   You know, I'm very much in favor
[01:35:48.820 --> 01:35:52.420]   of trying to create mindful education
[01:35:52.420 --> 01:35:54.340]   because, as I said before,
[01:35:54.340 --> 01:35:57.100]   I think that it's our system of education
[01:35:57.100 --> 01:35:59.300]   that has caused most of the mindlessness.
[01:35:59.300 --> 01:36:02.820]   And, you know, a slide that I put on
[01:36:02.820 --> 01:36:06.620]   when I give some of these talks, in my view,
[01:36:06.620 --> 01:36:10.100]   that virtually, I don't really mean virtually,
[01:36:10.100 --> 01:36:12.580]   I have to say it 'cause I'm an academic, right?
[01:36:12.580 --> 01:36:17.580]   All, I believe all of our ills, all of them, Andrew,
[01:36:17.580 --> 01:36:22.020]   personal, interpersonal, professional, global,
[01:36:22.020 --> 01:36:25.720]   are the indirect or direct effect of our mindlessness.
[01:36:25.720 --> 01:36:29.500]   So here we have schools all over the country
[01:36:29.500 --> 01:36:31.240]   teaching these absolutes,
[01:36:31.240 --> 01:36:36.600]   propagated in magazines, newspapers, you know,
[01:36:36.600 --> 01:36:40.220]   taught by our parents, taught to each other,
[01:36:40.220 --> 01:36:42.180]   all that are limiting us
[01:36:42.180 --> 01:36:46.980]   and causing the problems that we keep trying to solve.
[01:36:46.980 --> 01:36:51.300]   And how easy it would be if we just acknowledge
[01:36:51.300 --> 01:36:53.260]   everybody doesn't know something,
[01:36:53.260 --> 01:36:54.980]   everybody knows something else,
[01:36:54.980 --> 01:36:56.940]   everybody can't do something,
[01:36:56.940 --> 01:36:58.780]   everyone can do something else.
[01:36:58.780 --> 01:37:01.060]   So when you're grading that paper
[01:37:01.060 --> 01:37:03.940]   and you're so sure that this paper, you know,
[01:37:03.940 --> 01:37:05.720]   just doesn't make it,
[01:37:05.720 --> 01:37:11.480]   to presume that every smart person in the world
[01:37:11.480 --> 01:37:15.340]   would evaluate that the same way, I find this tasteful.
[01:37:15.340 --> 01:37:19.640]   So constantly, you know, you give tests in school
[01:37:19.640 --> 01:37:22.060]   to find out what people don't know,
[01:37:22.060 --> 01:37:24.360]   give tests to find out what they do know.
[01:37:24.360 --> 01:37:26.400]   - Turns out it's the best way to learn.
[01:37:26.400 --> 01:37:28.640]   I'd researched an episode of us,
[01:37:28.640 --> 01:37:30.920]   a solo episode of this podcast I did
[01:37:30.920 --> 01:37:33.440]   and to figure out what are the best ways to study and learn.
[01:37:33.440 --> 01:37:34.380]   It was based on a course
[01:37:34.380 --> 01:37:36.440]   that I had guest lectured in at Stanford.
[01:37:36.440 --> 01:37:39.280]   It turns out we have to be careful now.
[01:37:39.280 --> 01:37:41.160]   I have to be careful with saying things like the best.
[01:37:41.160 --> 01:37:44.440]   One of the most effective ways to learn
[01:37:44.440 --> 01:37:47.020]   is to self-test for what one knows and doesn't know,
[01:37:47.020 --> 01:37:48.880]   but not for sake of evaluation,
[01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:51.200]   but for sake of enhancing recall
[01:37:51.200 --> 01:37:53.520]   and depth of consolidation.
[01:37:53.520 --> 01:37:56.320]   And I think all of us in, at least in this country--
[01:37:56.320 --> 01:37:57.920]   - Well, but I'm saying something a little different,
[01:37:57.920 --> 01:38:00.400]   you know, is you're saying how to remember,
[01:38:00.400 --> 01:38:02.360]   which I agree with that completely,
[01:38:02.360 --> 01:38:05.720]   but I'm saying that when we're testing people,
[01:38:05.720 --> 01:38:08.640]   we, whoever the we is,
[01:38:08.640 --> 01:38:11.280]   decided what is important to know
[01:38:11.280 --> 01:38:14.080]   to see does that student know that,
[01:38:14.080 --> 01:38:17.800]   ignoring all the other things that student must know.
[01:38:17.800 --> 01:38:23.160]   I said this before that when I was lecturing in South Africa
[01:38:23.160 --> 01:38:25.760]   and they put me up in this very fancy hotel
[01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:29.400]   and I had taken a few hours off and I was down by the pool.
[01:38:29.400 --> 01:38:33.040]   And I, you know, there was this enormous amount
[01:38:33.040 --> 01:38:36.400]   of the hotel space, the real estate,
[01:38:36.400 --> 01:38:38.760]   that was totally unused.
[01:38:38.760 --> 01:38:42.700]   The only person who knew that was the lowly cabana boy,
[01:38:42.700 --> 01:38:46.980]   who nobody is going to ask what his opinion is.
[01:38:46.980 --> 01:38:51.440]   You know, everybody has a perspective that can add to the,
[01:38:51.440 --> 01:38:53.560]   you know, the larger piece.
[01:38:53.560 --> 01:38:56.840]   And by having this idea of there are those of us on top,
[01:38:56.840 --> 01:38:59.160]   we really know, you know, people expect,
[01:38:59.160 --> 01:39:01.840]   and I was given this genius award and, you know,
[01:39:01.840 --> 01:39:03.400]   shortly afterwards, every time I say,
[01:39:03.400 --> 01:39:05.920]   and you're supposed to be a genius, I never claimed.
[01:39:05.920 --> 01:39:08.280]   - The danger of awards that carry things,
[01:39:08.280 --> 01:39:12.080]   titles like genius or even Nobel, you know,
[01:39:12.080 --> 01:39:13.960]   I'm not gonna poke at my few friends
[01:39:13.960 --> 01:39:15.040]   that happen to have Nobels
[01:39:15.040 --> 01:39:16.340]   'cause they've done beautiful work,
[01:39:16.340 --> 01:39:20.600]   but it's rare that people who get Nobels do much after that.
[01:39:20.600 --> 01:39:23.680]   They become great sources of fundraising for universities.
[01:39:23.680 --> 01:39:25.280]   So you get leveraged for that.
[01:39:26.160 --> 01:39:28.640]   But, and I don't think anyone's gonna shed a tear
[01:39:28.640 --> 01:39:29.920]   for a Nobel Prize winner here,
[01:39:29.920 --> 01:39:33.080]   but this brings me to this notion of labels,
[01:39:33.080 --> 01:39:35.960]   not just rankings and performance, but labels.
[01:39:35.960 --> 01:39:36.960]   - Sure. - I mean, we-
[01:39:36.960 --> 01:39:39.680]   - Labels hide all the ambiguity.
[01:39:39.680 --> 01:39:42.800]   So if I, you know, we can use grades.
[01:39:42.800 --> 01:39:46.960]   When I give a student an A versus a B,
[01:39:46.960 --> 01:39:49.200]   it sounds like they're very different.
[01:39:49.200 --> 01:39:54.200]   But imagine, and I've studied this with respect to health,
[01:39:55.520 --> 01:39:59.560]   that the person who gets an 89,
[01:39:59.560 --> 01:40:03.920]   so you go from an 80 to an 89, you get a B,
[01:40:03.920 --> 01:40:07.040]   a 90 to a 100, you get an A,
[01:40:07.040 --> 01:40:09.480]   nobody in their right mind would think
[01:40:09.480 --> 01:40:11.520]   there's a real difference between the person
[01:40:11.520 --> 01:40:14.780]   who's gotten the 89 and the person who's gotten the 90.
[01:40:14.780 --> 01:40:19.000]   But their worlds become very different.
[01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.760]   You know, all the ambiguity is hidden.
[01:40:21.760 --> 01:40:24.800]   We studied this, it's the borderline effect,
[01:40:24.800 --> 01:40:27.720]   as we call it, where, so imagine,
[01:40:27.720 --> 01:40:30.360]   let's say you and I take an IQ test,
[01:40:30.360 --> 01:40:33.960]   and for argument's sake, that you get a 70,
[01:40:33.960 --> 01:40:38.960]   so you're normal, I get a 69, so I'm cognitively deprived.
[01:40:38.960 --> 01:40:42.680]   I could have sneezed and read the question wrong.
[01:40:42.680 --> 01:40:45.720]   I could have come up with multiple answers
[01:40:45.720 --> 01:40:47.120]   that could have been better than the one
[01:40:47.120 --> 01:40:48.720]   that got the question and the person
[01:40:48.720 --> 01:40:50.720]   who wrote the question, and so on.
[01:40:50.720 --> 01:40:54.240]   But now, we're put into two different categories.
[01:40:54.240 --> 01:40:56.880]   And because I'm cognitively deficient,
[01:40:56.880 --> 01:40:59.840]   I'm not given the training that I should be given,
[01:40:59.840 --> 01:41:03.320]   I no longer think well of myself,
[01:41:03.320 --> 01:41:05.880]   and so if you asked me to read certain things,
[01:41:05.880 --> 01:41:07.600]   I'd probably opt out, and so on.
[01:41:07.600 --> 01:41:09.800]   And in a very short time,
[01:41:09.800 --> 01:41:13.200]   the difference between us becomes very real.
[01:41:13.200 --> 01:41:17.000]   Well, it's the same thing with a medical diagnosis.
[01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:21.840]   There is always somebody who's right below the border
[01:41:21.840 --> 01:41:24.440]   who has it, or we'll say who doesn't have it,
[01:41:24.440 --> 01:41:25.640]   I don't know about below,
[01:41:25.640 --> 01:41:29.720]   and the person right above or at that has it,
[01:41:29.720 --> 01:41:33.560]   where the two scores are not meaningfully different,
[01:41:33.560 --> 01:41:36.400]   but where one then is told they have the disease
[01:41:36.400 --> 01:41:40.840]   and the other not, and the difference becomes real over time.
[01:41:40.840 --> 01:41:43.600]   And so we have data supporting that,
[01:41:43.600 --> 01:41:45.920]   and it's almost just a gedanken experiment,
[01:41:45.920 --> 01:41:48.240]   a thought experiment, you know.
[01:41:50.160 --> 01:41:54.200]   At some point, you have to put a limit,
[01:41:54.200 --> 01:42:00.400]   but you need to always know that it's made up.
[01:42:00.400 --> 01:42:05.400]   So what is the expiration date for this can of food?
[01:42:05.400 --> 01:42:07.440]   Well, I mean, there are people
[01:42:07.440 --> 01:42:09.040]   who actually go through their shelves
[01:42:09.040 --> 01:42:13.320]   and throw these things out because it's two weeks old,
[01:42:13.320 --> 01:42:16.200]   not realizing how did they come up with that date
[01:42:16.200 --> 01:42:17.480]   in the first place?
[01:42:19.120 --> 01:42:23.000]   Anyway, so to go back to what you were saying,
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:26.240]   let me remind you now, 'cause I'm having the junior moment,
[01:42:26.240 --> 01:42:30.880]   that labels, names of things, these categories,
[01:42:30.880 --> 01:42:33.840]   help us organize things, but more often,
[01:42:33.840 --> 01:42:38.840]   or as often, hold things still and cause problems.
[01:42:38.840 --> 01:42:44.560]   I did that first study way back when
[01:42:44.560 --> 01:42:47.160]   called a patient by any other name,
[01:42:47.160 --> 01:42:52.160]   and we made a videotape of a person being interviewed
[01:42:52.160 --> 01:42:57.280]   and showed it to therapists
[01:42:57.280 --> 01:43:01.240]   who were either behavior therapists or Freudian types,
[01:43:01.240 --> 01:43:03.800]   and the person on the tape was called
[01:43:03.800 --> 01:43:06.240]   either a patient or a job applicant.
[01:43:06.240 --> 01:43:08.400]   So the exact same tape.
[01:43:08.400 --> 01:43:10.920]   When we called the person a patient,
[01:43:10.920 --> 01:43:12.960]   they were seen as having hidden this
[01:43:12.960 --> 01:43:15.160]   and problems in that and so on.
[01:43:15.160 --> 01:43:17.120]   When the person was called a job applicant,
[01:43:17.120 --> 01:43:19.360]   they were seen as well-adjusted.
[01:43:19.360 --> 01:43:24.320]   - I have a friend who was in elite, elite special operations
[01:43:24.320 --> 01:43:27.840]   for a number of years, very smart guy, very philosophical,
[01:43:27.840 --> 01:43:31.400]   and he once said to me for reasons that I don't recall,
[01:43:31.400 --> 01:43:33.880]   he said, you know, the two most powerful
[01:43:33.880 --> 01:43:38.320]   but also dangerous words in the English language are I am,
[01:43:38.320 --> 01:43:41.760]   because anything that follows the words I am
[01:43:41.760 --> 01:43:43.760]   will completely constrain your notions
[01:43:43.760 --> 01:43:45.800]   of what's possible and what's not possible.
[01:43:45.800 --> 01:43:48.840]   And I said, you know, why are you telling me this, right?
[01:43:48.840 --> 01:43:51.520]   Because I pointed out that he was from special operations.
[01:43:51.520 --> 01:43:54.680]   He said, you know, that he and his teammates
[01:43:54.680 --> 01:43:58.520]   had a mode of refreshing their mindset
[01:43:58.520 --> 01:44:00.480]   around particular operations that were,
[01:44:00.480 --> 01:44:02.760]   because of the division of the military he was in, et cetera,
[01:44:02.760 --> 01:44:03.600]   it was quite varied.
[01:44:03.600 --> 01:44:05.440]   It wasn't like they were just sort of
[01:44:05.440 --> 01:44:06.480]   doing one type of thing.
[01:44:06.480 --> 01:44:08.000]   They had to be very adaptive.
[01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:11.880]   And he said that they had to completely wipe away
[01:44:11.880 --> 01:44:15.280]   this I am component of their vocabulary,
[01:44:15.280 --> 01:44:18.640]   except as it related to the word adaptive.
[01:44:18.640 --> 01:44:19.960]   It was like, I am adaptive.
[01:44:19.960 --> 01:44:23.840]   So, but there was never a title to who they were,
[01:44:23.840 --> 01:44:26.240]   what they were, once they entered the context
[01:44:26.240 --> 01:44:29.080]   of a planning execution of one of these operations.
[01:44:29.080 --> 01:44:32.040]   Very interesting way of thinking about identity,
[01:44:32.040 --> 01:44:35.560]   how it shapes mindset, how it constrains it and opens doors
[01:44:35.560 --> 01:44:41.520]   and converts things into action or failure to execute.
[01:44:41.520 --> 01:44:44.560]   - Yeah.
[01:44:44.560 --> 01:44:46.080]   I found it very intriguing, you know,
[01:44:46.080 --> 01:44:47.760]   'cause here's a guy that wouldn't normally think,
[01:44:47.760 --> 01:44:49.640]   like think of this stuff, but it turned out,
[01:44:49.640 --> 01:44:52.400]   he said that was a very potent tool for them.
[01:44:52.400 --> 01:44:53.240]   Yeah.
[01:44:53.240 --> 01:44:57.080]   - Well, I think that as soon as you're learning something
[01:44:57.080 --> 01:44:59.080]   and if you have your sense of,
[01:44:59.080 --> 01:45:03.760]   as if you're going to be the same person
[01:45:03.760 --> 01:45:06.880]   over the next 70 years, for example,
[01:45:06.880 --> 01:45:08.960]   we don't actually cognize that,
[01:45:08.960 --> 01:45:11.280]   but without literally realizing
[01:45:11.280 --> 01:45:13.040]   that you're not gonna be the same person
[01:45:13.040 --> 01:45:16.320]   and you take in whatever you've just learned
[01:45:16.320 --> 01:45:20.280]   and continue doing it the exact same way.
[01:45:20.280 --> 01:45:21.960]   You know, we go back to tennis.
[01:45:21.960 --> 01:45:24.400]   You learn the game of tennis when you're 15
[01:45:24.400 --> 01:45:27.640]   and now you're 40.
[01:45:27.640 --> 01:45:30.000]   You shouldn't be doing any of it the same way.
[01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:30.840]   - Why do you think we get--
[01:45:30.840 --> 01:45:33.240]   - And now you're 80 again.
[01:45:33.240 --> 01:45:36.120]   And so what happens is your performance
[01:45:36.120 --> 01:45:38.800]   is not going to be as good as it could be
[01:45:38.800 --> 01:45:41.480]   because the 80 year old body's trying to do it
[01:45:41.480 --> 01:45:43.480]   as if it's a 15 year old
[01:45:43.480 --> 01:45:45.800]   rather than taking advantage of,
[01:45:45.800 --> 01:45:48.240]   there are positive things that happen as you get older.
[01:45:48.240 --> 01:45:49.800]   They're not all negative.
[01:45:49.800 --> 01:45:52.320]   You know, that, I mean, if I'm playing tennis
[01:45:52.320 --> 01:45:56.720]   with, I don't know, a 15 year old kid,
[01:45:56.720 --> 01:46:00.880]   I'm gonna win without having to move very much
[01:46:00.880 --> 01:46:03.080]   'cause they don't know what they're doing, you know?
[01:46:03.080 --> 01:46:06.520]   So that you don't need the same skills
[01:46:06.520 --> 01:46:10.800]   the more experience you have with the task,
[01:46:10.800 --> 01:46:12.680]   necessarily at least.
[01:46:12.680 --> 01:46:15.360]   You see what I'm saying is that we freeze,
[01:46:15.360 --> 01:46:17.120]   we freeze our own behavior.
[01:46:17.120 --> 01:46:19.760]   Every time you learn, the way we learn everything,
[01:46:19.760 --> 01:46:22.680]   it just, it ogles the mind.
[01:46:22.680 --> 01:46:24.760]   You learn how to drive
[01:46:24.760 --> 01:46:27.880]   and then you freeze the way you're learning how to drive
[01:46:27.880 --> 01:46:31.640]   when you know the least about how to drive, you know?
[01:46:31.640 --> 01:46:33.480]   And that's the way you're going to do it
[01:46:33.480 --> 01:46:35.480]   for the rest of your life.
[01:46:35.480 --> 01:46:37.400]   A driving thing, just as,
[01:46:37.400 --> 01:46:42.480]   not really apropos of anything except in the car,
[01:46:42.480 --> 01:46:45.760]   that if you're driving on ice, what do you do?
[01:46:45.760 --> 01:46:49.040]   The car starts to skid, you're driving on ice.
[01:46:49.040 --> 01:46:50.680]   I know in California, you don't pay.
[01:46:50.680 --> 01:46:52.080]   I know what you don't do.
[01:46:52.080 --> 01:46:53.360]   You don't slam on the brakes.
[01:46:53.360 --> 01:46:55.920]   You come off, you slowly come off the gas.
[01:46:55.920 --> 01:46:57.320]   I've driven on the East Coast a little bit.
[01:46:57.320 --> 01:46:59.280]   That's exactly wrong, Andrew.
[01:46:59.280 --> 01:47:01.000]   That used to be the case.
[01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:02.200]   You see, so you've heard,
[01:47:02.200 --> 01:47:04.680]   this is the way we learn everything.
[01:47:04.680 --> 01:47:07.800]   You start on the way things are right now,
[01:47:07.800 --> 01:47:10.760]   that when you skid, we were told
[01:47:10.760 --> 01:47:14.560]   that what you're supposed to do is gently hit the brake
[01:47:14.560 --> 01:47:16.440]   and turn into the car.
[01:47:16.440 --> 01:47:19.000]   Now that there are anti-lock brakes,
[01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.880]   the only way, the safest way to stop that car
[01:47:21.880 --> 01:47:24.200]   is to jam on those brakes.
[01:47:24.200 --> 01:47:25.400]   So we just think about it
[01:47:25.400 --> 01:47:26.960]   because this is the way we learn everything.
[01:47:26.960 --> 01:47:28.520]   You learn, in this case,
[01:47:28.520 --> 01:47:31.560]   you're learning how to drive for safety sake.
[01:47:31.560 --> 01:47:35.240]   And then you mindlessly continue that
[01:47:35.240 --> 01:47:37.880]   and it becomes very unsafe.
[01:47:37.880 --> 01:47:39.960]   - I didn't get the memo.
[01:47:39.960 --> 01:47:41.360]   - No, okay, no, most people don't.
[01:47:41.360 --> 01:47:43.360]   That's why I brought it up now,
[01:47:43.360 --> 01:47:45.520]   seeming apropos of almost nothing.
[01:47:45.520 --> 01:47:50.200]   But we need to understand that things are changing
[01:47:50.200 --> 01:47:53.000]   and pay attention to the way that they're changing
[01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:54.640]   and change with it.
[01:47:54.640 --> 01:47:56.840]   And the more you hold yourself,
[01:47:56.840 --> 01:47:58.440]   you're talking about identity,
[01:47:58.480 --> 01:48:01.560]   the more you hold yourself still,
[01:48:01.560 --> 01:48:03.520]   the harder that's going to be.
[01:48:03.520 --> 01:48:09.960]   I'm much older, as most people are, than I used to be,
[01:48:09.960 --> 01:48:13.040]   but I don't have any sense of age.
[01:48:13.040 --> 01:48:14.120]   I really don't.
[01:48:14.120 --> 01:48:15.440]   In fact, the other day,
[01:48:15.440 --> 01:48:17.320]   and the other day now means years ago,
[01:48:17.320 --> 01:48:21.800]   I was helping this woman with something
[01:48:21.800 --> 01:48:24.360]   and somebody dear to me said,
[01:48:24.360 --> 01:48:27.360]   "You're probably 20 years older than she is."
[01:48:27.360 --> 01:48:28.200]   I had no sense.
[01:48:28.200 --> 01:48:31.120]   I thought I was helping this old person.
[01:48:31.120 --> 01:48:34.160]   Age is just not a relevant factor for me.
[01:48:34.160 --> 01:48:37.160]   Sometimes you want to be aware of age.
[01:48:37.160 --> 01:48:41.840]   We did some research where we have people who,
[01:48:41.840 --> 01:48:44.320]   you know, they're accused in the environment
[01:48:44.320 --> 01:48:47.600]   that often tell us how old we are
[01:48:47.600 --> 01:48:50.720]   and those are not always so good.
[01:48:50.720 --> 01:48:54.320]   So for example, if I, at my age,
[01:48:54.320 --> 01:48:58.160]   I'm in a fancy store and I go to buy,
[01:48:58.160 --> 01:49:00.800]   let's say a dress, a skirt, okay,
[01:49:00.800 --> 01:49:05.720]   it would be inappropriate for me to buy a miniskirt.
[01:49:05.720 --> 01:49:09.560]   I'm too old to be wearing almost nothing there, right?
[01:49:09.560 --> 01:49:15.480]   So clothing tells you how old the person is.
[01:49:15.480 --> 01:49:19.440]   Now, we did research, just archival research,
[01:49:19.440 --> 01:49:23.040]   with people who wore uniforms.
[01:49:23.040 --> 01:49:24.720]   Now, if you're wearing a uniform
[01:49:24.720 --> 01:49:27.320]   from the first day you start working,
[01:49:27.320 --> 01:49:31.600]   you're there 30 years, there's no difference, okay?
[01:49:31.600 --> 01:49:34.040]   There's no age-relevant cue.
[01:49:34.040 --> 01:49:39.000]   And in those situations are healthier.
[01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:39.840]   Really?
[01:49:39.840 --> 01:49:42.800]   Yeah, because they're not getting the cue that they're old.
[01:49:42.800 --> 01:49:45.640]   I'd like to take a quick break
[01:49:45.640 --> 01:49:48.400]   and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Our Place.
[01:49:48.400 --> 01:49:51.560]   Our Place makes my favorite pots, pans, and other cookware.
[01:49:51.560 --> 01:49:53.720]   Now, I've discussed on this podcast before
[01:49:53.720 --> 01:49:56.720]   that the PFASs or forever chemicals like Teflon
[01:49:56.720 --> 01:49:58.160]   have been linked to major health issues
[01:49:58.160 --> 01:49:59.840]   such as endocrine disruption,
[01:49:59.840 --> 01:50:01.360]   that means hormone disruption,
[01:50:01.360 --> 01:50:03.560]   gut microbiome disruption, fertility issues,
[01:50:03.560 --> 01:50:05.160]   and many other health problems.
[01:50:05.160 --> 01:50:06.960]   So it's really important to avoid them.
[01:50:06.960 --> 01:50:08.440]   This is why I recently fell in love
[01:50:08.440 --> 01:50:09.840]   with Our Place products,
[01:50:09.840 --> 01:50:11.400]   especially one of their cooking pans,
[01:50:11.400 --> 01:50:13.800]   the Titanium Always Pan Pro.
[01:50:13.800 --> 01:50:14.960]   Our Place products are made
[01:50:14.960 --> 01:50:16.380]   with the highest quality materials
[01:50:16.380 --> 01:50:19.040]   and are all PFAS and toxin-free.
[01:50:19.040 --> 01:50:21.800]   They're beautifully designed and function extremely well
[01:50:21.800 --> 01:50:23.200]   for all your cooking needs.
[01:50:23.200 --> 01:50:24.680]   Most mornings, I cook eggs in it,
[01:50:24.680 --> 01:50:26.600]   I cook ground beef in it, ground venison,
[01:50:26.600 --> 01:50:29.340]   and the titanium pan is also designed in a way
[01:50:29.340 --> 01:50:31.600]   that allows eggs and meat to cook perfectly
[01:50:31.600 --> 01:50:33.000]   without sticking to the pan.
[01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:34.600]   It's extremely easy to clean,
[01:50:34.600 --> 01:50:36.500]   and like all Our Place products,
[01:50:36.500 --> 01:50:38.480]   it's nice to look at when sitting on the counter
[01:50:38.480 --> 01:50:39.600]   or on the stove.
[01:50:39.600 --> 01:50:40.520]   For a limited time,
[01:50:40.520 --> 01:50:43.660]   Our Place is offering an exclusive 20% discount

[01:50:56.220 --> 01:50:58.580]   - So if one has parents, let's say,
[01:50:58.580 --> 01:51:01.200]   who are quote-unquote slowing down a bit,
[01:51:01.200 --> 01:51:03.220]   and they're talking a little bit about some aches
[01:51:03.220 --> 01:51:06.340]   and pains and there's a stairwell in the house,
[01:51:06.340 --> 01:51:10.060]   for instance, and they're starting to say things like,
[01:51:10.060 --> 01:51:11.040]   you know, at some point,
[01:51:11.040 --> 01:51:12.720]   we're either gonna have to move into a place
[01:51:12.720 --> 01:51:14.040]   that doesn't have a stairwell
[01:51:14.040 --> 01:51:16.540]   or put one of those chair lifts things,
[01:51:16.540 --> 01:51:20.820]   or maybe just move into the downstairs.
[01:51:20.820 --> 01:51:23.620]   Do you think that in just thinking about that,
[01:51:23.620 --> 01:51:24.820]   they're going to accelerate
[01:51:24.820 --> 01:51:28.220]   the demise of their locomotor ability?
[01:51:28.220 --> 01:51:30.280]   - I do, actually.
[01:51:30.280 --> 01:51:33.660]   I think that when we start entertaining
[01:51:33.660 --> 01:51:36.300]   these negative thoughts and evaluating ourselves,
[01:51:36.300 --> 01:51:38.460]   we're always gonna find evidence.
[01:51:38.460 --> 01:51:39.780]   You know, as you get older, you start,
[01:51:39.780 --> 01:51:41.140]   oh my God, am I forgetful?
[01:51:41.140 --> 01:51:44.540]   So you pay attention each time you forget,
[01:51:44.540 --> 01:51:46.760]   and that makes it even worse.
[01:51:46.760 --> 01:51:50.860]   When I said to my students in this health class,
[01:51:50.860 --> 01:51:54.720]   smart kids at Harvard, this is on Thursday,
[01:51:54.720 --> 01:51:56.200]   I teach Tuesday and Thursday,
[01:51:56.200 --> 01:52:00.180]   I said, what was the last thing I said in class on Tuesday?
[01:52:00.180 --> 01:52:01.280]   Nobody remembers.
[01:52:01.280 --> 01:52:03.280]   I said, you must be getting dementia.
[01:52:03.280 --> 01:52:04.120]   You know?
[01:52:04.120 --> 01:52:07.120]   All right, so that when a young person forgets,
[01:52:07.120 --> 01:52:09.760]   it's okay, they don't pay any attention to the forgetting.
[01:52:09.760 --> 01:52:11.760]   As you get older and you forget,
[01:52:11.760 --> 01:52:14.880]   you get less involved in what you're doing.
[01:52:14.880 --> 01:52:16.460]   If you're trying to learn something,
[01:52:16.460 --> 01:52:19.540]   you have the competing part of you saying,
[01:52:19.540 --> 01:52:22.640]   you know, that you're not gonna remember this, and so on.
[01:52:22.640 --> 01:52:25.320]   And independent of all of this,
[01:52:25.320 --> 01:52:28.460]   I think a lot of the loss in memory
[01:52:28.460 --> 01:52:30.780]   has nothing to do with memory.
[01:52:30.780 --> 01:52:34.580]   You know, there, when I was young,
[01:52:34.580 --> 01:52:37.120]   and you're introducing me to people,
[01:52:37.120 --> 01:52:40.560]   I thought it was important for me to remember their names.
[01:52:40.560 --> 01:52:42.400]   Andrew, I know, doesn't speak well of me.
[01:52:42.400 --> 01:52:43.920]   I don't really care.
[01:52:43.920 --> 01:52:45.520]   You're gonna introduce me to five of your,
[01:52:45.520 --> 01:52:46.760]   why do I care?
[01:52:46.760 --> 01:52:48.640]   If I'm gonna need their names,
[01:52:48.640 --> 01:52:51.540]   chances are I will meet them again, right?
[01:52:51.540 --> 01:52:53.720]   So afterwards, if you say to me,
[01:52:53.720 --> 01:52:57.240]   remember Jim, and I say to you, which one was Jim?
[01:52:57.240 --> 01:52:59.120]   It wasn't that I forgot.
[01:52:59.120 --> 01:53:02.960]   To forget means I had to have learned it in the first place.
[01:53:02.960 --> 01:53:05.320]   And so if you don't learn it in the first place
[01:53:05.320 --> 01:53:10.320]   'cause you don't care, 'cause your values
[01:53:10.320 --> 01:53:12.220]   change as you get older,
[01:53:12.220 --> 01:53:13.880]   then it's not a matter of forgetting
[01:53:13.880 --> 01:53:16.680]   when you don't know it in the second place.
[01:53:16.680 --> 01:53:19.880]   And I think that, you know, if we turn it around,
[01:53:19.880 --> 01:53:20.840]   'cause now I'm doing this,
[01:53:20.840 --> 01:53:22.900]   'cause I know you expect it of me,
[01:53:22.900 --> 01:53:25.760]   and we say, what if you remembered everything?
[01:53:25.760 --> 01:53:26.600]   Everything.
[01:53:26.600 --> 01:53:27.440]   - That would be terrible.
[01:53:27.440 --> 01:53:28.900]   - How would you get through, you know,
[01:53:28.900 --> 01:53:32.360]   you wouldn't get to experience anything new.
[01:53:32.360 --> 01:53:36.560]   So forgetting, you know, serves a purpose.
[01:53:36.560 --> 01:53:40.600]   And I used to think, I never tested this,
[01:53:40.600 --> 01:53:43.140]   and now we came up with this years ago,
[01:53:43.140 --> 01:53:46.120]   and I think it's probably wrong, but it's kind of fun,
[01:53:46.120 --> 01:53:49.940]   that people, as they get older, they become hard of hearing.
[01:53:49.940 --> 01:53:54.040]   But it also happens that the older you get,
[01:53:54.040 --> 01:53:57.160]   the more you realize nobody's really saying anything.
[01:53:57.160 --> 01:54:00.040]   And so being hard of hearing protects you
[01:54:00.040 --> 01:54:03.160]   from a lot of that, you know, noise.
[01:54:03.160 --> 01:54:05.560]   - Yeah, my grandfather used to turn off his hearing aid.
[01:54:05.560 --> 01:54:06.400]   You know, I started wearing,
[01:54:06.400 --> 01:54:09.560]   I've always had glasses for reading at night
[01:54:09.560 --> 01:54:11.640]   when my eyes would get fatigued or something.
[01:54:11.640 --> 01:54:15.120]   But recently I came to my awareness
[01:54:15.120 --> 01:54:17.680]   that my vision at a distance is very, very sharp.
[01:54:17.680 --> 01:54:19.040]   I'm like an eagle, I can, you know,
[01:54:19.040 --> 01:54:22.040]   read numbers for, you know, very far away.
[01:54:22.040 --> 01:54:26.240]   But my vision up close has been diminishing.
[01:54:26.240 --> 01:54:28.160]   I find myself straining a bit more even than this.
[01:54:28.160 --> 01:54:30.280]   So I started wearing, you know, eyeglasses.
[01:54:30.280 --> 01:54:31.880]   - Or you should have the book further away.
[01:54:31.880 --> 01:54:33.120]   - Or you should have the book further away,
[01:54:33.120 --> 01:54:35.480]   but, you know, I've just, I've defaulted to eyeglasses.
[01:54:35.480 --> 01:54:37.280]   And then, but I realized that
[01:54:37.280 --> 01:54:40.040]   because I understand the neuroplasticity
[01:54:40.040 --> 01:54:42.840]   of the visual system, that I'm certainly accelerating
[01:54:42.840 --> 01:54:46.440]   the demise of my near vision by wearing glasses.
[01:54:46.440 --> 01:54:48.360]   And so I'm trying to, you know, balance the two.
[01:54:48.360 --> 01:54:50.280]   - Well, do you know our vision study?
[01:54:50.280 --> 01:54:51.600]   This is kind of fun.
[01:54:51.600 --> 01:54:54.880]   So I'm in the doctor's office, and like everybody else,
[01:54:54.880 --> 01:54:56.960]   I'm given the snelly night chart.
[01:54:57.920 --> 01:55:00.640]   - The letters, the snellen is the letters and numbers.
[01:55:00.640 --> 01:55:01.480]   - Yeah, okay.
[01:55:01.480 --> 01:55:04.960]   And, you know, but I'm different from most people.
[01:55:04.960 --> 01:55:09.720]   And I resent that the letters are getting smaller
[01:55:09.720 --> 01:55:13.280]   and smaller because it's creating an expectation
[01:55:13.280 --> 01:55:16.040]   that soon I won't be able to see.
[01:55:16.040 --> 01:55:18.200]   So I ask what would happen
[01:55:18.200 --> 01:55:20.800]   if the letters got larger and larger,
[01:55:20.800 --> 01:55:23.080]   which would be to change the expectation
[01:55:23.080 --> 01:55:25.200]   that soon I will be able to see.
[01:55:25.200 --> 01:55:28.120]   So when we do that, people are able to see
[01:55:28.120 --> 01:55:30.480]   what they weren't able to see before.
[01:55:30.480 --> 01:55:33.000]   Now, most of us have trouble
[01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:35.760]   around 2/3 of the way down the chart.
[01:55:35.760 --> 01:55:40.760]   So what we did was start the chart 1/3 of the way down.
[01:55:40.760 --> 01:55:43.080]   So the letters are smaller than on top.
[01:55:43.080 --> 01:55:48.040]   So now 2/3 of the way down, that starting point,
[01:55:48.040 --> 01:55:50.240]   the letters are really small.
[01:55:50.240 --> 01:55:52.320]   And what happens is, again, people can see
[01:55:52.320 --> 01:55:54.040]   what they couldn't see before.
[01:55:54.040 --> 01:55:55.520]   - Awesome, yeah.
[01:55:55.520 --> 01:55:58.520]   So the idea that your vision has to get worse,
[01:55:58.520 --> 01:56:04.080]   I don't, I think there are many, many instances
[01:56:04.080 --> 01:56:05.200]   where that's not the case,
[01:56:05.200 --> 01:56:08.680]   but also the whole test of vision is bizarre.
[01:56:08.680 --> 01:56:11.920]   How often in your life are you looking at letters
[01:56:11.920 --> 01:56:13.800]   that make no sense?
[01:56:13.800 --> 01:56:16.320]   You know, if I don't wanna see you,
[01:56:16.320 --> 01:56:19.240]   I'm gonna see you a lot sooner be able to run away from you.
[01:56:19.240 --> 01:56:22.120]   If I'm hungry, I can see the restaurant sign
[01:56:23.040 --> 01:56:25.080]   much quicker than if I'm not hungry.
[01:56:25.080 --> 01:56:27.200]   I see things in color that are different
[01:56:27.200 --> 01:56:30.080]   in black and white, you know, so on and so forth.
[01:56:30.080 --> 01:56:34.800]   And to lose all of that with a two-dimensional eye test
[01:56:34.800 --> 01:56:36.880]   seems to me, you know.
[01:56:36.880 --> 01:56:39.240]   And again, you know, we haven't touched on this,
[01:56:39.240 --> 01:56:42.000]   but it's probably important with respect to vision.
[01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:43.800]   It's true with everything.
[01:56:43.800 --> 01:56:47.720]   You know, in fact, I tell people, you're wearing glasses.
[01:56:47.720 --> 01:56:49.520]   Try it without glasses.
[01:56:49.520 --> 01:56:54.240]   You want to see when you can see and when you can't see.
[01:56:54.240 --> 01:56:58.800]   With almost everything, we, again,
[01:56:58.800 --> 01:57:04.320]   hold things still when they're varying.
[01:57:04.320 --> 01:57:08.280]   Now, what I mean by this is that, let's say with vision,
[01:57:08.280 --> 01:57:13.280]   my guess is that 11 o'clock in the morning,
[01:57:13.280 --> 01:57:18.080]   my vision is better than at seven o'clock at night.
[01:57:18.080 --> 01:57:19.880]   - The data, yes. - Okay.
[01:57:19.880 --> 01:57:21.120]   I mean, it'd be hard for at night.
[01:57:21.120 --> 01:57:22.320]   So what does this say?
[01:57:22.320 --> 01:57:26.640]   This says maybe I should either have a nap.
[01:57:26.640 --> 01:57:28.480]   I don't nap, so I should have an energy bar.
[01:57:28.480 --> 01:57:29.960]   And even an energy bar is cute.
[01:57:29.960 --> 01:57:32.120]   It's just a candy bar, but you call it an energy bar,
[01:57:32.120 --> 01:57:33.400]   you're allowed to eat it.
[01:57:33.400 --> 01:57:36.080]   It's like you take a piece of cake, put it in a muffin tin.
[01:57:36.080 --> 01:57:36.920]   It's called a muffin.
[01:57:36.920 --> 01:57:39.640]   It's healthier than the piece of cake.
[01:57:39.640 --> 01:57:42.780]   Anyway, I'll leave that as it may.
[01:57:44.160 --> 01:57:49.160]   That control, a great amount of control
[01:57:49.160 --> 01:57:52.120]   over our physical well-being
[01:57:52.120 --> 01:57:55.080]   comes about by attention to variability,
[01:57:55.080 --> 01:57:57.680]   which is just a fancy way of talking about mindfulness.
[01:57:57.680 --> 01:57:59.640]   Mindfulness is noticing change.
[01:57:59.640 --> 01:58:01.560]   That's what it means to be variable.
[01:58:01.560 --> 01:58:04.620]   All right, so if you took your glasses off
[01:58:04.620 --> 01:58:07.620]   and you saw for yourself, what are the times,
[01:58:07.620 --> 01:58:09.580]   what are the moments that you're having?
[01:58:09.580 --> 01:58:12.920]   I'm not talking about people who are almost blind,
[01:58:12.920 --> 01:58:15.120]   where I can't see and when I can see.
[01:58:15.120 --> 01:58:17.240]   And then you ask yourself why.
[01:58:17.240 --> 01:58:21.720]   And then it may be the case that it's a particular font
[01:58:21.720 --> 01:58:23.840]   or more likely that you're tired
[01:58:23.840 --> 01:58:25.760]   and then you have other options.
[01:58:25.760 --> 01:58:27.280]   But once you start wearing them,
[01:58:27.280 --> 01:58:30.160]   it's like taking a laxative.
[01:58:30.160 --> 01:58:31.860]   Take a laxative once, it's fine.
[01:58:31.860 --> 01:58:34.140]   If you're taking a laxative all the time,
[01:58:34.140 --> 01:58:37.520]   you're teaching your body to depend on the laxative.
[01:58:37.520 --> 01:58:40.480]   You can teach ourselves by some of these
[01:58:42.400 --> 01:58:44.480]   things that are supposed to be helpful
[01:58:44.480 --> 01:58:47.040]   that we teach ourselves to need them
[01:58:47.040 --> 01:58:48.840]   in ways we otherwise wouldn't.
[01:58:48.840 --> 01:58:52.080]   And so he did this attention to symptom variability
[01:58:52.080 --> 01:58:53.640]   with big diseases.
[01:58:53.640 --> 01:58:55.880]   So when you have a chronic illness,
[01:58:55.880 --> 01:58:59.880]   the way most people understand chronic illness
[01:58:59.880 --> 01:59:02.920]   is that there's nothing that can be done about it.
[01:59:02.920 --> 01:59:04.200]   Yeah, the word chronic implies that.
[01:59:04.200 --> 01:59:05.040]   Exactly.
[01:59:05.040 --> 01:59:08.400]   But all it means is the medical world doesn't have a fix.
[01:59:08.400 --> 01:59:10.480]   It doesn't mean there's nothing can be done.
[01:59:10.480 --> 01:59:13.520]   Now, you have your symptoms of the chronic illness.
[01:59:13.520 --> 01:59:16.640]   The presumption most of the time, I would think,
[01:59:16.640 --> 01:59:20.440]   is that the symptoms are going to stay the same or get worse.
[01:59:20.440 --> 01:59:24.680]   Nothing only moves in one direction.
[01:59:24.680 --> 01:59:26.120]   Sometimes it's a little better,
[01:59:26.120 --> 01:59:28.040]   sometimes a little, the stock market.
[01:59:28.040 --> 01:59:30.280]   If it's going up, it doesn't go up in a straight line,
[01:59:30.280 --> 01:59:32.760]   goes up, down a little, you know, and so on.
[01:59:32.760 --> 01:59:33.600]   All right.
[01:59:33.600 --> 01:59:36.800]   So when it's better, why is it better?
[01:59:36.800 --> 01:59:41.400]   So we do this, we call people periodically,
[01:59:41.400 --> 01:59:45.240]   and we simply ask them, how is the symptom now?
[01:59:45.240 --> 01:59:48.160]   Is it better or worse than the last time we called?
[01:59:48.160 --> 01:59:49.000]   And why?
[01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:50.480]   Several things happen.
[01:59:50.480 --> 01:59:53.440]   The first, by engaging in the whole process,
[01:59:53.440 --> 01:59:55.240]   people feel less helpless,
[01:59:55.240 --> 01:59:57.600]   and that turns out to be good for your health.
[01:59:57.600 --> 02:00:00.440]   Second, once you start noticing
[02:00:00.440 --> 02:00:02.560]   that now it's a little better,
[02:00:02.560 --> 02:00:03.920]   or it can even be a little worse,
[02:00:03.920 --> 02:00:05.760]   you feel better 'cause you thought that it was,
[02:00:05.760 --> 02:00:08.120]   you know, always maximally, I'm always in pain,
[02:00:08.120 --> 02:00:10.040]   I'm always stressed, whatever it is.
[02:00:10.040 --> 02:00:12.480]   Third, or whatever I'm up to,
[02:00:12.480 --> 02:00:14.600]   by asking the question,
[02:00:14.600 --> 02:00:17.240]   why now is it better or worse than before,
[02:00:17.240 --> 02:00:19.720]   you engage in a mindful search.
[02:00:19.720 --> 02:00:24.600]   And I have decades of evidence that that mindfulness itself,
[02:00:24.600 --> 02:00:27.840]   the neurons are firing, that itself is good for your health.
[02:00:27.840 --> 02:00:30.480]   And then finally, I believe you're more likely
[02:00:30.480 --> 02:00:33.360]   to find a solution if you're looking for one.
[02:00:33.360 --> 02:00:36.080]   So we've done this with multiple sclerosis,
[02:00:36.080 --> 02:00:40.520]   chronic pain, Parkinson's, stroke, biggies,
[02:00:40.520 --> 02:00:43.760]   and in each case have very positive results.
[02:00:43.760 --> 02:00:46.240]   And the good thing about these sorts of things
[02:00:46.240 --> 02:00:48.880]   is that there are no negative side effects.
[02:00:48.880 --> 02:00:52.160]   And it doesn't mean that you have to stop doing
[02:00:52.160 --> 02:00:55.440]   any medical procedures you may be doing.
[02:00:55.440 --> 02:00:56.840]   But you know, you're asking,
[02:00:56.840 --> 02:00:59.640]   you're back in charge of your own healthcare.
[02:00:59.640 --> 02:01:01.800]   Why does this hurt now?
[02:01:01.800 --> 02:01:04.320]   You know, stress, there are some people
[02:01:04.320 --> 02:01:05.680]   who think they're stressed all the time.
[02:01:05.680 --> 02:01:08.240]   Nobody is anything all the time.
[02:01:08.240 --> 02:01:11.000]   So I call you, Andrew, and I say,
[02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:13.360]   how stressed are you now, and why?
[02:01:13.360 --> 02:01:15.320]   And we go through this over time.
[02:01:15.320 --> 02:01:17.080]   And then you find out, you know,
[02:01:17.080 --> 02:01:19.520]   you're stressed when you're talking to Ellen Langer.
[02:01:19.520 --> 02:01:22.560]   Well, then the solution is easy, don't talk to me.
[02:01:22.560 --> 02:01:26.600]   - I've been thinking about deadlines a lot lately.
[02:01:26.600 --> 02:01:29.960]   And we hear stories of, you know,
[02:01:29.960 --> 02:01:32.960]   people being told I need this done in 15 days.
[02:01:32.960 --> 02:01:35.720]   And if people are forced to do it in 15 days,
[02:01:35.720 --> 02:01:38.960]   somehow they're able to get it done in 15 days.
[02:01:38.960 --> 02:01:40.740]   Or, and certainly there are limits to this.
[02:01:40.740 --> 02:01:43.240]   If you told me I need to write 1,000 pages in five minutes,
[02:01:43.240 --> 02:01:46.600]   I would, there would be very little on each page.
[02:01:46.600 --> 02:01:48.680]   But staying within the bounds of reason
[02:01:48.680 --> 02:01:49.880]   of what we're talking about
[02:01:49.880 --> 02:01:53.120]   when we say there's a deadline in X number of days,
[02:01:53.120 --> 02:01:55.320]   why do you think it is that our perception
[02:01:55.320 --> 02:01:58.000]   of what's possible tends to scale with,
[02:01:58.000 --> 02:01:59.760]   A, what's been done before?
[02:01:59.760 --> 02:02:01.360]   So precedent or no precedent,
[02:02:01.360 --> 02:02:03.120]   the four minute mile, for instance,
[02:02:03.120 --> 02:02:06.800]   until Bannister broke it, you know, no one else broke it.
[02:02:06.800 --> 02:02:09.680]   He broke it, lots of people have broken it since
[02:02:09.680 --> 02:02:11.200]   and did immediately afterwards.
[02:02:11.200 --> 02:02:14.860]   So what do you think about this notion of what's possible
[02:02:14.860 --> 02:02:19.860]   in terms of preordained human decision constraints?
[02:02:19.860 --> 02:02:22.640]   Like no one can break the four minute mile.
[02:02:22.640 --> 02:02:23.600]   Someone breaks the four minute mile,
[02:02:23.600 --> 02:02:27.520]   now we reset to a new reality in time
[02:02:27.520 --> 02:02:29.200]   and in sort of capability.
[02:02:29.200 --> 02:02:32.720]   Because I feel like much of what we believe about ourselves
[02:02:32.720 --> 02:02:36.920]   is also constrained by our beliefs about the outside world.
[02:02:36.920 --> 02:02:39.000]   And as you pointed out earlier,
[02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:40.760]   all of that's just a human script
[02:02:40.760 --> 02:02:43.560]   that is the play we're all in.
[02:02:43.560 --> 02:02:44.400]   - Yeah.
[02:02:44.400 --> 02:02:50.400]   I think that the first part is what guides most of us
[02:02:50.400 --> 02:02:52.400]   is what's been done before.
[02:02:52.400 --> 02:02:55.400]   And the fact that nobody has done it to me
[02:02:55.400 --> 02:02:58.680]   means nothing but to a lot of people.
[02:02:58.680 --> 02:03:01.680]   People create theories working backwards,
[02:03:01.680 --> 02:03:04.760]   you know, which is they often take what is
[02:03:04.760 --> 02:03:07.320]   and then derive rules to explain
[02:03:07.320 --> 02:03:09.080]   why it has to be like that.
[02:03:09.080 --> 02:03:11.480]   Once you believe it has to be like that,
[02:03:11.480 --> 02:03:15.820]   then it doesn't occur to you to do anything other than that.
[02:03:15.820 --> 02:03:19.920]   But if we start off with the notions of science
[02:03:19.920 --> 02:03:21.240]   that I was talking about before,
[02:03:21.240 --> 02:03:25.360]   that it's all just probability, no absolutes,
[02:03:25.360 --> 02:03:27.000]   then it wouldn't occur to you
[02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:31.540]   to stay within the rigid boundaries.
[02:03:31.540 --> 02:03:35.480]   Not the best answer, but the only one that came to mind.
[02:03:35.480 --> 02:03:37.000]   - No, it's a great answer.
[02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:40.600]   I'm trying to think about the use of the scientific method,
[02:03:40.600 --> 02:03:44.300]   which is what you use in your lab and in your research.
[02:03:44.300 --> 02:03:50.400]   And why it is that you haven't, it seems,
[02:03:50.400 --> 02:03:52.680]   challenged the scientific method itself,
[02:03:52.680 --> 02:03:54.880]   except at the level of like what hypothesis
[02:03:54.880 --> 02:03:55.940]   you're gonna test.
[02:03:55.940 --> 02:03:57.700]   I mean, in order to do great science,
[02:03:57.700 --> 02:04:01.140]   I mean, at some point you need statistics,
[02:04:01.140 --> 02:04:03.440]   you need sample size to be sufficient.
[02:04:03.440 --> 02:04:07.040]   You know, the rigor of your studies is as important
[02:04:07.040 --> 02:04:10.760]   as the originality of the questions you're asking.
[02:04:10.760 --> 02:04:12.560]   And so it seems that you've embraced
[02:04:12.560 --> 02:04:15.560]   the scientific method as at least useful.
[02:04:15.560 --> 02:04:17.500]   - Yeah, that's the key.
[02:04:17.500 --> 02:04:21.800]   That, to me, it's a means of speaking to certain people.
[02:04:21.800 --> 02:04:24.480]   And it carries with it a certain gravitas.
[02:04:24.480 --> 02:04:28.840]   But I, by no means, feel that it's giving answers
[02:04:28.840 --> 02:04:31.880]   that are any more absolute.
[02:04:31.880 --> 02:04:32.960]   Well, as I said before,
[02:04:32.960 --> 02:04:35.880]   that all of the answers are probabilities.
[02:04:35.880 --> 02:04:38.560]   So it's just a language to use.
[02:04:38.560 --> 02:04:43.560]   You know, the counterclockwise study was criticized
[02:04:43.560 --> 02:04:47.320]   because I didn't publish it in a standard journal
[02:04:47.320 --> 02:04:51.120]   because my assumption of the, you know,
[02:04:51.120 --> 02:04:55.160]   it's very hard if you're doing something over a week's time
[02:04:55.160 --> 02:04:57.880]   to control every possibility.
[02:04:57.880 --> 02:05:01.320]   And what I was trying to do in that study
[02:05:01.320 --> 02:05:06.320]   was to show that vision, for example, can be improved,
[02:05:06.320 --> 02:05:13.120]   that lots of the things that people presume are wired in
[02:05:13.120 --> 02:05:15.520]   as you get older, it gets worse and worse,
[02:05:15.520 --> 02:05:19.140]   that just doesn't have to be that way.
[02:05:19.140 --> 02:05:22.640]   But I'm having trouble remembering now
[02:05:22.640 --> 02:05:26.400]   because I know that I was going to write a paper
[02:05:26.400 --> 02:05:31.400]   taking the whole science of science apart and never did.
[02:05:31.400 --> 02:05:34.720]   And if I had written the paper,
[02:05:34.720 --> 02:05:36.920]   I'd probably remember what I was going to say
[02:05:36.920 --> 02:05:38.520]   and answer your question.
[02:05:38.520 --> 02:05:39.880]   Well, it's a good one,
[02:05:39.880 --> 02:05:44.080]   but I don't think that there's anything
[02:05:44.080 --> 02:05:49.080]   that is described as absolute that's going to be right.
[02:05:49.380 --> 02:05:52.300]   Whether it's physics, even physics,
[02:05:52.300 --> 02:05:55.660]   biology, psychology, anything, you know,
[02:05:55.660 --> 02:05:58.940]   that our methods can only take us so far.
[02:05:58.940 --> 02:06:02.700]   And the people who get beyond that
[02:06:02.700 --> 02:06:06.260]   are the people who don't presume
[02:06:06.260 --> 02:06:08.220]   that that's as far as you can go.
[02:06:08.220 --> 02:06:10.740]   You know, if you can go this way, you can go a little further.
[02:06:10.740 --> 02:06:14.340]   I was a chemistry major when I was an undergraduate.
[02:06:14.340 --> 02:06:17.060]   And the problem was I practiced Jewish chemistry,
[02:06:17.060 --> 02:06:20.300]   which was a little as good, a little more is better,
[02:06:20.300 --> 02:06:22.760]   which is not the way to do chemistry.
[02:06:22.760 --> 02:06:25.700]   But I don't know what it is
[02:06:25.700 --> 02:06:30.060]   that leads some people to be rigid
[02:06:30.060 --> 02:06:33.240]   and to take everything that is told to them
[02:06:33.240 --> 02:06:35.100]   as if it must be.
[02:06:35.100 --> 02:06:40.100]   And what it is that led me to a different way of being
[02:06:40.100 --> 02:06:45.060]   and testing it or just thinking that some of the things
[02:06:45.060 --> 02:06:47.920]   that people say just made no sense to me.
[02:06:47.920 --> 02:06:49.540]   - Not long ago, we went through
[02:06:49.540 --> 02:06:51.820]   one of the biggest public health crises
[02:06:51.820 --> 02:06:54.180]   of at least my lifetime.
[02:06:54.180 --> 02:06:59.180]   And at least two major controversies arose.
[02:06:59.180 --> 02:07:03.340]   One was the extent to which masks should or shouldn't be worn
[02:07:03.340 --> 02:07:04.840]   and are useful or no.
[02:07:04.840 --> 02:07:08.400]   The other is about the so-called vaccines.
[02:07:08.400 --> 02:07:09.500]   And this is-
[02:07:09.500 --> 02:07:12.300]   - Yeah, and I think those are beautiful examples
[02:07:12.300 --> 02:07:15.780]   because one can make an argument
[02:07:15.780 --> 02:07:17.980]   that you should wear masks,
[02:07:17.980 --> 02:07:20.460]   but the other side also makes sense.
[02:07:20.460 --> 02:07:22.980]   The way masks were preventing
[02:07:22.980 --> 02:07:25.940]   even nonverbal communication, which is very important
[02:07:25.940 --> 02:07:27.580]   and important to people's health, right?
[02:07:27.580 --> 02:07:31.220]   Your relationships are not an inconsequential part
[02:07:31.220 --> 02:07:33.400]   of your wellbeing.
[02:07:33.400 --> 02:07:38.400]   And vaccines, there is no treatment
[02:07:38.400 --> 02:07:41.320]   that's going to be good for everybody.
[02:07:41.320 --> 02:07:43.620]   Somebody very close to me,
[02:07:43.620 --> 02:07:46.860]   if given dexedrine, puts her to sleep.
[02:07:46.860 --> 02:07:48.380]   - Dexedrine is basically speed.
[02:07:48.380 --> 02:07:50.420]   - Exactly, puts her to, you know.
[02:07:50.420 --> 02:07:54.580]   And so when we recognize the uncertainty
[02:07:54.580 --> 02:07:56.420]   inherent in all of these things,
[02:07:56.420 --> 02:08:00.380]   I think we don't mandate things in quite the same way.
[02:08:00.380 --> 02:08:03.840]   Now, you can mandate that people wear masks,
[02:08:03.840 --> 02:08:06.260]   but it shouldn't be that people wear masks
[02:08:06.260 --> 02:08:10.180]   because we're absolutely certain that masks should be worn.
[02:08:10.180 --> 02:08:12.860]   There are other arguments to be made
[02:08:12.860 --> 02:08:15.420]   why people should wear masks.
[02:08:15.420 --> 02:08:16.260]   - Or not wear masks.
[02:08:16.260 --> 02:08:19.240]   - Or not wear masks, whatever the case is going to be.
[02:08:19.240 --> 02:08:25.060]   And I think it's important that in the medical world,
[02:08:25.060 --> 02:08:30.620]   that I think, I gave this talk at one point
[02:08:30.620 --> 02:08:34.340]   and I thought I was talking to 5,000 women
[02:08:34.340 --> 02:08:36.100]   with breast cancer.
[02:08:36.100 --> 02:08:39.300]   And it turned out there were lots and lots
[02:08:39.300 --> 02:08:41.080]   of physicians there.
[02:08:41.080 --> 02:08:42.560]   If I had known that,
[02:08:42.560 --> 02:08:45.100]   I might have spoken a little differently.
[02:08:45.100 --> 02:08:47.660]   And I'm scared afterwards.
[02:08:47.660 --> 02:08:48.740]   I said, you know, oh my goodness,
[02:08:48.740 --> 02:08:50.580]   because I was not flattering.
[02:08:50.580 --> 02:08:54.520]   You know, I had great respect for most of these people.
[02:08:54.520 --> 02:08:58.600]   But then I found out afterwards that they were thrilled
[02:08:58.600 --> 02:09:01.340]   because they know they don't know.
[02:09:01.340 --> 02:09:03.580]   And, you know, operating on the world
[02:09:03.580 --> 02:09:07.300]   with an awareness that you can't be sure
[02:09:07.300 --> 02:09:09.180]   leads to a different humility,
[02:09:09.180 --> 02:09:12.460]   a different way of appreciating other people
[02:09:12.460 --> 02:09:15.620]   when they disagree with you and so on.
[02:09:15.620 --> 02:09:19.380]   And I don't know how you do that at the higher level,
[02:09:19.380 --> 02:09:21.700]   you know, government and so on.
[02:09:21.700 --> 02:09:27.180]   But, you know, this is maybe a silly example,
[02:09:27.180 --> 02:09:28.500]   but meaningful to me.
[02:09:28.500 --> 02:09:31.260]   So I spent a lot of time in Mexico
[02:09:31.300 --> 02:09:35.660]   and there's this very busy intersection.
[02:09:35.660 --> 02:09:38.180]   And there are no stop signs,
[02:09:38.180 --> 02:09:39.980]   there are no traffic lights,
[02:09:39.980 --> 02:09:42.220]   and there are no accidents.
[02:09:42.220 --> 02:09:45.580]   Because everybody knows there's no traffic light,
[02:09:45.580 --> 02:09:47.180]   there's no stop sign.
[02:09:47.180 --> 02:09:49.820]   You have to pay attention to what's going on.
[02:09:49.820 --> 02:09:54.240]   You know, so lots of these rules and laws
[02:09:54.240 --> 02:09:55.980]   divert attention to,
[02:09:55.980 --> 02:09:58.740]   as if there's only one thing that matters.
[02:09:58.740 --> 02:10:02.100]   You know, so when you're told to drive 60 miles an hour,
[02:10:02.100 --> 02:10:04.020]   what does that mean?
[02:10:04.020 --> 02:10:08.220]   You know, and, you know, that if you drive 70,
[02:10:08.220 --> 02:10:09.380]   you're going to get a ticket.
[02:10:09.380 --> 02:10:11.800]   Okay, so if you're not afraid of getting the ticket,
[02:10:11.800 --> 02:10:13.860]   but there were other considerations
[02:10:13.860 --> 02:10:15.740]   to how fast you might go.
[02:10:15.740 --> 02:10:17.860]   You know, the quality of your car,
[02:10:17.860 --> 02:10:19.380]   the quality of the roads,
[02:10:19.380 --> 02:10:21.700]   is it raining at the moment,
[02:10:21.700 --> 02:10:25.160]   how uncomfortable or comfortable the passengers are.
[02:10:25.160 --> 02:10:27.800]   And all of this gets, and much more,
[02:10:27.800 --> 02:10:31.520]   gets lost by having the rule, 60,
[02:10:31.520 --> 02:10:36.520]   as if that, you know, somehow is an absolute truth.
[02:10:36.520 --> 02:10:38.860]   - Yeah, and experience matters,
[02:10:38.860 --> 02:10:41.600]   at least in my view, because,
[02:10:41.600 --> 02:10:43.720]   so for instance, going back to vaccines, right?
[02:10:43.720 --> 02:10:46.120]   I'm not trying to create unnecessary controversy here,
[02:10:46.120 --> 02:10:48.720]   but it's absolutely clear to me
[02:10:48.720 --> 02:10:50.800]   that there are people who believe that,
[02:10:50.800 --> 02:10:53.720]   for instance, the COVID vaccines were immensely valuable.
[02:10:53.720 --> 02:10:55.480]   On the whole, it saved lives, et cetera.
[02:10:55.480 --> 02:10:58.620]   And there are other people who are absolutely convinced
[02:10:58.620 --> 02:11:01.320]   that the vaccines caused injury,
[02:11:01.320 --> 02:11:03.160]   perhaps to them or to people that they know.
[02:11:03.160 --> 02:11:05.920]   And both sides, as it were,
[02:11:05.920 --> 02:11:09.760]   seem to know a lot about their side.
[02:11:09.760 --> 02:11:13.080]   And so the discussions aren't really discussions,
[02:11:13.080 --> 02:11:16.320]   because the people that felt that they had a vaccine injury
[02:11:16.320 --> 02:11:19.480]   know an immense amount about that injury,
[02:11:19.480 --> 02:11:21.780]   the context, and others who had it.
[02:11:22.720 --> 02:11:26.240]   The people who had a different experience of the vaccines
[02:11:26.240 --> 02:11:28.880]   or have a different stance of the COVID vaccine
[02:11:28.880 --> 02:11:31.520]   know a tremendous amount about the statistics and mass
[02:11:31.520 --> 02:11:34.200]   of what the general outcomes were as a consequence.
[02:11:34.200 --> 02:11:36.360]   Okay, so it's futile, right?
[02:11:36.360 --> 02:11:39.500]   Like, it's not a meaningful discussion.
[02:11:39.500 --> 02:11:40.340]   And then what ends up happening-
[02:11:40.340 --> 02:11:41.960]   - But it didn't have to be that way.
[02:11:41.960 --> 02:11:43.880]   You know, we go back to the beginning,
[02:11:43.880 --> 02:11:46.600]   and in school, you're asked a question
[02:11:46.600 --> 02:11:49.960]   and expected to give a single answer.
[02:11:49.960 --> 02:11:53.480]   Life would be so different for us as we grow up
[02:11:53.480 --> 02:11:56.480]   if you gave multiple answers to whatever the question was.
[02:11:56.480 --> 02:11:58.400]   That immediately would make clear
[02:11:58.400 --> 02:12:00.740]   that there are alternative perspectives.
[02:12:00.740 --> 02:12:05.920]   Just a very simple change in schools.
[02:12:05.920 --> 02:12:07.960]   - Well, then I'd like to challenge an idea,
[02:12:07.960 --> 02:12:09.920]   since that seems to be a challenging assumption.
[02:12:09.920 --> 02:12:11.360]   - One of my ideas, no.
[02:12:11.360 --> 02:12:12.700]   - No, not one of your ideas.
[02:12:12.700 --> 02:12:14.120]   I'd like to challenge the assumption
[02:12:14.120 --> 02:12:17.260]   that as people get older, they become more set in their ways.
[02:12:17.260 --> 02:12:21.760]   Because many times today, I'm hearing that as one,
[02:12:21.760 --> 02:12:23.220]   and I'm getting older, I'm now can say,
[02:12:23.220 --> 02:12:25.420]   I'm so happy I can say I'm almost 50.
[02:12:25.420 --> 02:12:26.660]   I actually love getting older.
[02:12:26.660 --> 02:12:28.580]   I feel better now. - Me too, me too.
[02:12:28.580 --> 02:12:32.020]   - I feel better now at almost 50 than I did in my 20s,
[02:12:32.020 --> 02:12:34.460]   and psychologically and physically.
[02:12:34.460 --> 02:12:35.860]   And I felt great then.
[02:12:35.860 --> 02:12:40.020]   So I challenge the assumption that we get worse with age.
[02:12:40.020 --> 02:12:43.540]   - Yeah, no, I'm with you, and I'm much older than you are.
[02:12:43.540 --> 02:12:45.060]   - So do we get set in our ways,
[02:12:45.060 --> 02:12:47.580]   or maybe we're more flexible in our thinking?
[02:12:47.580 --> 02:12:52.300]   - I think that the older you are,
[02:12:52.300 --> 02:12:55.620]   let's say you've tried different ways of doing something,
[02:12:55.620 --> 02:12:59.620]   and there's a particular way that works for you.
[02:12:59.620 --> 02:13:02.940]   And it doesn't matter if the other way is faster,
[02:13:02.940 --> 02:13:05.580]   is prettier, is whatever, this works.
[02:13:05.580 --> 02:13:09.060]   And so you can be seen as set in your way,
[02:13:09.060 --> 02:13:11.220]   because you know it doesn't really matter.
[02:13:11.220 --> 02:13:12.940]   I could do it that way, that way, or this way.
[02:13:12.940 --> 02:13:15.180]   I'm gonna continue to do it this way.
[02:13:15.180 --> 02:13:17.300]   I think as you get older,
[02:13:17.300 --> 02:13:21.260]   presumably you've had more mindful experience,
[02:13:21.260 --> 02:13:23.980]   'cause if you're a robot,
[02:13:23.980 --> 02:13:27.540]   you're not going to be learning anything,
[02:13:27.540 --> 02:13:30.980]   and getting more set or less set is an irrelevant question.
[02:13:30.980 --> 02:13:35.980]   But I remember, this goes back to the pancreas.
[02:13:35.980 --> 02:13:40.340]   Am I not eating the pancreas?
[02:13:40.340 --> 02:13:43.140]   I really believed I had to eat that pancreas
[02:13:43.140 --> 02:13:45.180]   to show that I was all grown up.
[02:13:45.180 --> 02:13:48.060]   So you get a little older, and you realize,
[02:13:48.060 --> 02:13:51.340]   I wrote this blog once, a long time ago,
[02:13:51.340 --> 02:13:53.940]   where you're two years old, and you fall,
[02:13:53.940 --> 02:13:55.460]   and you're screaming bloody murder,
[02:13:55.460 --> 02:13:57.300]   'cause you scraped your leg.
[02:13:57.300 --> 02:13:59.260]   And then you're seven years old,
[02:13:59.260 --> 02:14:01.940]   and Johnny or Janie didn't send you a Valentine,
[02:14:01.940 --> 02:14:03.940]   and you're distraught.
[02:14:03.940 --> 02:14:05.620]   And then you're 13 years old,
[02:14:05.620 --> 02:14:07.900]   and you have a pimple, and oh my God,
[02:14:07.900 --> 02:14:09.660]   no one's ever gonna find me attractive.
[02:14:09.660 --> 02:14:10.940]   And it goes on and on.
[02:14:10.940 --> 02:14:14.620]   And at some point, this was all kind of silly.
[02:14:14.620 --> 02:14:19.060]   And with that, you become easier.
[02:14:19.060 --> 02:14:22.660]   But sometimes that easier can be misunderstood by others.
[02:14:22.660 --> 02:14:23.900]   So let me give you an example.
[02:14:23.900 --> 02:14:25.820]   And I talk about this in the book
[02:14:25.820 --> 02:14:27.580]   when I talk about three levels.
[02:14:27.580 --> 02:14:32.660]   That, in the example I use,
[02:14:32.660 --> 02:14:37.060]   The New Yorker is a wonderful magazine.
[02:14:37.060 --> 02:14:38.460]   But let's say we have three levels.
[02:14:38.460 --> 02:14:41.580]   Level one, people who don't read The New Yorker.
[02:14:41.580 --> 02:14:44.860]   Level two, people who read The New Yorker.
[02:14:44.860 --> 02:14:48.260]   Level three, people who don't read The New Yorker anymore.
[02:14:48.260 --> 02:14:49.500]   We could have them read it again,
[02:14:49.500 --> 02:14:51.540]   but let's just skip it first, okay?
[02:14:51.540 --> 02:14:53.220]   Level one, not reading,
[02:14:53.220 --> 02:14:58.220]   and those not reading it anymore are very different.
[02:14:58.220 --> 02:15:01.620]   But they're seen as the same by the level twos.
[02:15:01.620 --> 02:15:04.820]   Level two people are the bane of my existence.
[02:15:04.820 --> 02:15:06.940]   All right, so let's say you have,
[02:15:06.940 --> 02:15:10.540]   you're young, you're uninhibited, level one.
[02:15:10.540 --> 02:15:14.580]   Then you're like most people, you become very inhibited.
[02:15:14.580 --> 02:15:17.660]   Then, hopefully, you get to a certain point in life,
[02:15:17.660 --> 02:15:19.460]   you say, "Who cares?"
[02:15:19.460 --> 02:15:23.660]   And you become disinhibited, not uninhibited,
[02:15:23.660 --> 02:15:25.340]   'cause you know the rule,
[02:15:25.340 --> 02:15:27.540]   you're just choosing not to follow it.
[02:15:27.540 --> 02:15:30.980]   But those at the level two will see the level three
[02:15:30.980 --> 02:15:32.620]   and think they're level ones,
[02:15:32.620 --> 02:15:35.500]   'cause you can't see beyond your own level of development.
[02:15:35.500 --> 02:15:37.220]   When I was young,
[02:15:37.220 --> 02:15:40.900]   especially if I'm on an important show like yours, Andrew,
[02:15:40.900 --> 02:15:43.260]   and we just took a break for a minute,
[02:15:43.260 --> 02:15:44.820]   and if I had eaten something
[02:15:44.820 --> 02:15:49.820]   and I got a spot on my sweater, I'd sit like this.
[02:15:49.820 --> 02:15:53.380]   Not even realizing how stupid does this look, right?
[02:15:53.380 --> 02:15:56.380]   But that no one should see that I got, you know.
[02:15:56.380 --> 02:15:57.740]   - Yeah, God forbid you're human,
[02:15:57.740 --> 02:15:58.980]   you spilled a piece of food. - Yes, you get to a certain,
[02:15:58.980 --> 02:16:00.820]   who cares?
[02:16:00.820 --> 02:16:03.540]   So I do this thing with my students,
[02:16:03.540 --> 02:16:05.740]   and it's very simple,
[02:16:05.740 --> 02:16:08.500]   but it has a very big effect on them,
[02:16:08.500 --> 02:16:11.980]   where I tell them you can't come to class next week
[02:16:11.980 --> 02:16:14.300]   unless you're wearing two different shoes.
[02:16:14.300 --> 02:16:18.740]   It's very hard, some won't come to class, most come.
[02:16:18.740 --> 02:16:21.740]   Then a large majority wear two different shoes
[02:16:21.740 --> 02:16:23.300]   that look the same, you know,
[02:16:23.300 --> 02:16:25.580]   two different black sneakers that are, you know.
[02:16:25.580 --> 02:16:27.860]   And then you have the bold where you're a red
[02:16:27.860 --> 02:16:30.140]   and a black sneaker, that's cool.
[02:16:30.140 --> 02:16:33.340]   And we talk about these, nobody even noticed.
[02:16:33.340 --> 02:16:35.580]   And if they notice, what are they noticing?
[02:16:35.580 --> 02:16:39.340]   Somebody who knows you is not gonna judge you differently
[02:16:39.340 --> 02:16:40.180]   'cause you're wearing two different,
[02:16:40.180 --> 02:16:41.860]   they're gonna assume there's some reason for it.
[02:16:41.860 --> 02:16:43.700]   And those who don't know you, don't know you,
[02:16:43.700 --> 02:16:44.860]   so what do you care?
[02:16:44.860 --> 02:16:47.660]   So this wonderful young woman,
[02:16:47.660 --> 02:16:49.180]   I did this in my seminars as well,
[02:16:49.180 --> 02:16:51.220]   that was in the lecture class.
[02:16:51.220 --> 02:16:52.860]   She comes in, just, "Professor Langer,
[02:16:52.860 --> 02:16:53.900]   "you won't believe what happened."
[02:16:53.900 --> 02:16:55.180]   I said, "What happened?"
[02:16:55.180 --> 02:16:57.460]   She said, "I'm in the elevator, there's this guy,
[02:16:57.460 --> 02:17:00.780]   "he looks at my feet, he looks at my face,
[02:17:00.780 --> 02:17:03.780]   "he looks at my feet, he looks at my face,
[02:17:03.780 --> 02:17:05.100]   "he looks at my feet."
[02:17:05.100 --> 02:17:08.260]   And he points and he says, "Was that intentional?"
[02:17:08.260 --> 02:17:09.100]   You know what I did?
[02:17:09.100 --> 02:17:10.340]   I said, "No, what did you do?"
[02:17:10.340 --> 02:17:13.700]   She said, "I looked at his feet, I looked at his face,
[02:17:13.700 --> 02:17:17.020]   "I looked at his feet, I looked, I pointed to his feet
[02:17:17.020 --> 02:17:19.380]   "and said to him, 'Was that?'"
[02:17:19.380 --> 02:17:20.220]   You know?
[02:17:20.220 --> 02:17:21.140]   - So good.
[02:17:21.140 --> 02:17:24.940]   - And when people recognize that everything
[02:17:24.940 --> 02:17:27.520]   is sort of in some sense up for grabs,
[02:17:27.520 --> 02:17:30.840]   you know, that none of it really matters,
[02:17:30.840 --> 02:17:32.480]   it's so freeing.
[02:17:32.480 --> 02:17:35.400]   And there's so many ways that we constrict ourselves.
[02:17:35.400 --> 02:17:38.000]   And to make that an answer to your question,
[02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:42.920]   hopefully you get older and you realize that most of this,
[02:17:42.920 --> 02:17:44.640]   it just doesn't matter.
[02:17:44.640 --> 02:17:48.360]   Now you can learn that when you're younger.
[02:17:48.360 --> 02:17:52.040]   All you need to do is recognize that those people
[02:17:52.040 --> 02:17:55.080]   who you think are thinking you're X are,
[02:17:55.080 --> 02:17:56.720]   there are other people who are going to go,
[02:17:56.720 --> 02:17:58.400]   "Yay, you're X."
[02:17:58.400 --> 02:18:02.760]   You know, that you may love me because I'm trusting,
[02:18:02.760 --> 02:18:05.540]   you may dislike me because I'm gullible.
[02:18:05.540 --> 02:18:09.000]   So you can't please everybody,
[02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:11.320]   not because your behavior is unpleasant,
[02:18:11.320 --> 02:18:15.080]   but because all of it is up for their own definition
[02:18:15.080 --> 02:18:17.920]   and you can't control the way they're going to see it.
[02:18:17.920 --> 02:18:19.720]   - It's like our sense of justice
[02:18:19.720 --> 02:18:21.700]   kind of gets in the way sometimes.
[02:18:21.700 --> 02:18:24.800]   I mean, sense of justice can be very important in society.
[02:18:24.800 --> 02:18:25.640]   So don't get me wrong.
[02:18:25.640 --> 02:18:28.520]   But for instance, recently I had the experience
[02:18:28.520 --> 02:18:30.040]   where a news story came out.
[02:18:30.040 --> 02:18:33.920]   It wasn't about me, but-
[02:18:33.920 --> 02:18:35.680]   - And those are the only ones you read, right?
[02:18:35.680 --> 02:18:36.520]   - Yeah.
[02:18:36.520 --> 02:18:40.320]   It came out and the headline was,
[02:18:40.320 --> 02:18:41.680]   well, I'm just going to say what it was,
[02:18:41.680 --> 02:18:44.900]   that so-and-so's home, this famous person's home,
[02:18:44.900 --> 02:18:48.440]   was destroyed in the LA fires.
[02:18:48.440 --> 02:18:52.040]   Had a description of what had happened.
[02:18:52.040 --> 02:18:54.640]   It had a photograph of the home before and after.
[02:18:54.640 --> 02:18:56.440]   The devastation.
[02:18:56.440 --> 02:19:00.840]   And I immediately got upset because that was not their home.
[02:19:00.840 --> 02:19:02.320]   That was my home.
[02:19:02.320 --> 02:19:03.160]   - Oh my goodness.
[02:19:03.160 --> 02:19:05.560]   - Okay, now I hadn't lived in that home in a while.
[02:19:05.560 --> 02:19:08.760]   So there was no reason for them to say that it was my home.
[02:19:08.760 --> 02:19:10.880]   I wasn't upset that they didn't say it was my home.
[02:19:10.880 --> 02:19:15.360]   But there was my Toyota 4Runner parked in the driveway.
[02:19:15.360 --> 02:19:16.280]   - Oh, wow.
[02:19:16.280 --> 02:19:18.840]   - Like basically the whole thing was made up.
[02:19:18.840 --> 02:19:20.600]   And I actually know the reporter
[02:19:20.600 --> 02:19:22.640]   because they had tried to contact me once before.
[02:19:22.640 --> 02:19:25.120]   They had somehow got ahold of my phone number,
[02:19:25.120 --> 02:19:27.440]   which frustrates me in addition to that.
[02:19:27.440 --> 02:19:28.280]   And I realized-
[02:19:28.280 --> 02:19:30.000]   - That was my fault.
[02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:33.160]   - And I realized they're just making up lies.
[02:19:33.160 --> 02:19:34.880]   They're not even attempting to fact check.
[02:19:34.880 --> 02:19:37.960]   Now this was a minor thing whose home it was perhaps,
[02:19:37.960 --> 02:19:39.520]   but they made a bunch of issues around this.
[02:19:39.520 --> 02:19:41.680]   And then another article came out about this person
[02:19:41.680 --> 02:19:42.520]   and another one.
[02:19:42.520 --> 02:19:47.160]   And I basically, I don't believe anything that I read,
[02:19:47.160 --> 02:19:50.600]   certainly from that particular venue.
[02:19:50.600 --> 02:19:55.120]   And then I started to realize that probably half or more
[02:19:55.120 --> 02:19:58.320]   of what we read in traditional popular press
[02:19:58.320 --> 02:20:00.160]   is just made up.
[02:20:00.160 --> 02:20:01.560]   And no one's fact checking this stuff
[02:20:01.560 --> 02:20:03.120]   'cause how could they, like how could they know?
[02:20:03.120 --> 02:20:04.400]   And of course I'm not gonna pursue this
[02:20:04.400 --> 02:20:05.320]   in any kind of legal way.
[02:20:05.320 --> 02:20:07.000]   I don't really care.
[02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:10.040]   But my sense of justice is what frustrated me.
[02:20:10.040 --> 02:20:12.120]   And as soon as I went-
[02:20:12.120 --> 02:20:13.560]   - But what difference does it make?
[02:20:13.560 --> 02:20:14.400]   - That's kind of funny.
[02:20:14.400 --> 02:20:18.040]   Like this reporter so desperate for a story
[02:20:18.040 --> 02:20:20.880]   and to capitalize on the horrible events,
[02:20:20.880 --> 02:20:22.760]   like felt that they needed to do.
[02:20:22.760 --> 02:20:25.640]   And I thought this is like ridiculous
[02:20:25.640 --> 02:20:27.620]   and our species is just so weird.
[02:20:27.620 --> 02:20:29.420]   This is what I always default to in the end,
[02:20:29.420 --> 02:20:31.920]   whether or not it's about technology, about something else.
[02:20:31.920 --> 02:20:34.280]   I mean, real tragedies are real tragedies.
[02:20:34.280 --> 02:20:37.600]   And when those happen as the fires were, it upsets me.
[02:20:37.600 --> 02:20:40.720]   But so much of like what grabs our attention
[02:20:40.720 --> 02:20:45.220]   and the drama of things is just humans being ridiculous,
[02:20:45.220 --> 02:20:48.400]   sometimes lying, sometimes in service to one thing
[02:20:48.400 --> 02:20:50.180]   or pretending it's in service to justice
[02:20:50.180 --> 02:20:52.760]   when in fact it's in service to themselves
[02:20:52.760 --> 02:20:54.700]   or a combination of things.
[02:20:54.700 --> 02:20:57.340]   And I think as I've hit this,
[02:20:57.340 --> 02:21:00.180]   like what I hope is a new vista in my life,
[02:21:00.180 --> 02:21:05.180]   I'm thinking to myself like, wow, we're really obvious.
[02:21:05.180 --> 02:21:08.080]   Like we're so obviously silly.
[02:21:08.080 --> 02:21:11.060]   Like the game, I bring up Rick Rubin again.
[02:21:11.060 --> 02:21:13.620]   He has this saying that he repeats over and over to me.
[02:21:13.620 --> 02:21:15.720]   He said, like, there are only two truths,
[02:21:15.720 --> 02:21:17.700]   nature and professional wrestling.
[02:21:17.700 --> 02:21:19.380]   He loves professional wrestling.
[02:21:19.380 --> 02:21:21.940]   He watches hours and hours of professional wrestling.
[02:21:21.940 --> 02:21:23.480]   And I said, why do you do that?
[02:21:23.480 --> 02:21:24.320]   Isn't that?
[02:21:24.320 --> 02:21:28.580]   He said, it's made up and everyone knows it's made up.
[02:21:28.580 --> 02:21:29.420]   But it doesn't matter.
[02:21:29.420 --> 02:21:32.060]   Which is why it actually is one of the few things
[02:21:32.060 --> 02:21:34.580]   that's real because we all know it's made up.
[02:21:34.580 --> 02:21:36.220]   So whether or not they become allies
[02:21:36.220 --> 02:21:37.940]   or they become enemies in a given match
[02:21:37.940 --> 02:21:39.800]   or whether or not somebody breaks the rules
[02:21:39.800 --> 02:21:42.980]   and the ref pretends they don't see, it's theater.
[02:21:42.980 --> 02:21:44.940]   And it's designed to show you the theater
[02:21:44.940 --> 02:21:46.820]   that is human nature.
[02:21:46.820 --> 02:21:49.340]   I never had any appreciation for professional wrestling.
[02:21:49.340 --> 02:21:51.380]   I thought, but he's right, it's just.
[02:21:51.380 --> 02:21:53.740]   And so once you start looking, it's all made up.
[02:21:53.740 --> 02:21:56.340]   - Well, it doesn't have to be made up or not.
[02:21:56.340 --> 02:21:59.500]   If you ask yourself, what difference does it make?
[02:21:59.500 --> 02:22:00.340]   - The wrestling?
[02:22:00.340 --> 02:22:01.660]   - No, any of it.
[02:22:01.660 --> 02:22:03.980]   So it's your house, it's somebody else's house.
[02:22:03.980 --> 02:22:06.780]   - Exactly, I realized I was the one being ridiculous.
[02:22:06.780 --> 02:22:09.500]   I'm upset because there's some injustice because what?
[02:22:09.500 --> 02:22:12.020]   Because I don't want my forerunner in a news article
[02:22:12.020 --> 02:22:13.420]   about someone else's home.
[02:22:13.420 --> 02:22:15.620]   Maybe that person had a home that looked very similar,
[02:22:15.620 --> 02:22:19.200]   but I guess it was the break with my assumption
[02:22:19.200 --> 02:22:22.820]   that the traditional media tries to get things right,
[02:22:22.820 --> 02:22:23.940]   that they at least try.
[02:22:23.940 --> 02:22:26.260]   And in this case, the person clearly didn't even try.
[02:22:26.260 --> 02:22:28.220]   They had access to the real information.
[02:22:28.220 --> 02:22:29.060]   They chose to lie.
[02:22:29.060 --> 02:22:31.940]   - If you say there's something to be learned
[02:22:31.940 --> 02:22:34.740]   regardless of whether it's true or not.
[02:22:34.740 --> 02:22:38.020]   I thought you were going someplace else with this.
[02:22:38.020 --> 02:22:41.420]   My mind wanted to, I thought you were talking
[02:22:41.420 --> 02:22:43.460]   about the tragedy of the fire,
[02:22:43.460 --> 02:22:47.140]   which as an example, I use in "The Mindful Body"
[02:22:47.140 --> 02:22:52.140]   to show that events are not good, bad.
[02:22:52.140 --> 02:22:56.340]   Rather, our view of the event is what makes it good or bad.
[02:22:56.340 --> 02:22:59.100]   And so I had this experience.
[02:22:59.100 --> 02:23:00.900]   I was at a friend's house for dinner.
[02:23:00.900 --> 02:23:03.460]   I come back late, which never happens.
[02:23:03.460 --> 02:23:07.860]   And all of my neighbors were outside
[02:23:07.860 --> 02:23:10.300]   because my house had burned down.
[02:23:10.300 --> 02:23:12.740]   And, you know, just pretty scary.
[02:23:12.740 --> 02:23:16.260]   Okay, a couple of funny things happen.
[02:23:16.260 --> 02:23:18.860]   They said they were able to save my dogs,
[02:23:18.860 --> 02:23:21.000]   which that wasn't funny, that was wonderful,
[02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:22.740]   but they couldn't save the parrot.
[02:23:22.740 --> 02:23:24.740]   I said, "Parrot, I didn't have a parrot."
[02:23:24.740 --> 02:23:26.300]   Well, Roger Brown, when he was alive,
[02:23:26.300 --> 02:23:29.460]   gave me this stuffed parrot that was in a cage.
[02:23:29.460 --> 02:23:32.120]   - Oh my, okay, as a kid who owned parrots,
[02:23:32.120 --> 02:23:34.000]   I was like frightened for a moment.
[02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:37.340]   - Okay, so now I stay at a friend's house
[02:23:37.340 --> 02:23:41.620]   and the next day I call the insurance company
[02:23:41.620 --> 02:23:46.300]   and the person comes over and he said
[02:23:46.300 --> 02:23:49.840]   this was the first time in his 20-year career
[02:23:49.840 --> 02:23:53.020]   that the damage was worse than the call.
[02:23:53.020 --> 02:23:56.140]   Most people, "Oh my God, oh my God, it's not so bad."
[02:23:56.140 --> 02:23:58.780]   Here, I had already lost everything,
[02:23:58.780 --> 02:24:02.120]   so it didn't make sense to throw my sanity away after it.
[02:24:02.120 --> 02:24:04.260]   Okay, so that was the first thing.
[02:24:04.260 --> 02:24:07.060]   I move into the Charles Hotel
[02:24:07.060 --> 02:24:09.720]   and I'm a sight to be seen with my two little dogs.
[02:24:09.720 --> 02:24:15.060]   And it's Christmas, then all the presents coming in,
[02:24:15.060 --> 02:24:18.300]   you know, were burned, all the ones going out, you know.
[02:24:18.300 --> 02:24:23.220]   It's now Christmas Eve and I go out for dinner
[02:24:23.220 --> 02:24:26.980]   and I come back to the hotel room and it's full of gifts,
[02:24:26.980 --> 02:24:31.900]   not from the owner of the hotel, not from the management,
[02:24:31.900 --> 02:24:35.500]   but from the so-called little people, the chambermaids,
[02:24:35.500 --> 02:24:39.160]   the people who parked my car, the waiters and waitresses.
[02:24:39.160 --> 02:24:42.620]   Andrew, I tell you, I could not tell that story
[02:24:42.620 --> 02:24:44.540]   for months, maybe years,
[02:24:44.540 --> 02:24:46.660]   without it bringing tears to my eyes.
[02:24:46.660 --> 02:24:48.580]   It was beautiful.
[02:24:48.580 --> 02:24:51.780]   Every Christmas I'm reminded about what feels to me
[02:24:51.780 --> 02:24:53.740]   the basic goodness of people.
[02:24:53.740 --> 02:24:56.140]   And I couldn't tell you except for one thing,
[02:24:56.140 --> 02:24:58.100]   what I lost in that fire.
[02:24:58.100 --> 02:24:59.460]   So, you know.
[02:24:59.460 --> 02:25:01.940]   One stuffed parrot.
[02:25:01.940 --> 02:25:05.380]   No, no, that, I don't remember that until right now.
[02:25:05.380 --> 02:25:06.800]   No, it was kind of fun.
[02:25:06.800 --> 02:25:10.020]   I was teaching, going to be teaching,
[02:25:10.020 --> 02:25:12.220]   you know, as soon as school began again,
[02:25:12.220 --> 02:25:15.020]   a large lecture class and all my notes were burned.
[02:25:15.020 --> 02:25:18.420]   So, oh my God, what am I going to do?
[02:25:18.420 --> 02:25:22.180]   And so what I did was I called a student
[02:25:22.180 --> 02:25:25.620]   who got an A in the course the year before,
[02:25:25.620 --> 02:25:30.620]   borrowed her notes and omitted those and taught the course.
[02:25:30.620 --> 02:25:33.320]   But, and it was the best course I ever taught
[02:25:33.320 --> 02:25:38.260]   because I was not relying on anything
[02:25:38.260 --> 02:25:41.100]   that I would then repeat in, you know, in any absolute,
[02:25:41.100 --> 02:25:44.140]   I was totally there for each lecture.
[02:25:44.140 --> 02:25:49.180]   What do you think it is about hard events
[02:25:49.180 --> 02:25:54.180]   that are life-changing that anchor our mindfulness?
[02:25:54.180 --> 02:25:57.600]   No, no, I don't think that they necessarily are.
[02:25:57.600 --> 02:26:02.060]   I think that, you know, if something happens,
[02:26:02.060 --> 02:26:05.860]   you know, you should take advantage of it
[02:26:05.860 --> 02:26:07.860]   and learn something from it.
[02:26:07.860 --> 02:26:11.880]   And, you know, so there's data, not from my lab or yours,
[02:26:11.880 --> 02:26:15.260]   but that people who have heart attacks
[02:26:15.260 --> 02:26:17.620]   and you live through a heart attack or a stroke,
[02:26:17.620 --> 02:26:19.580]   all of a sudden you realize, gee,
[02:26:19.580 --> 02:26:21.820]   this is not going to go on forever.
[02:26:21.820 --> 02:26:24.580]   I've got to start living.
[02:26:24.580 --> 02:26:26.220]   And it's a shame.
[02:26:26.220 --> 02:26:29.820]   I mean, I think most people are sealed in unlived lives
[02:26:29.820 --> 02:26:34.820]   and, you know, that you need a heart attack to wake you up
[02:26:34.820 --> 02:26:37.640]   or somebody else's death, you know.
[02:26:37.640 --> 02:26:42.620]   My postdoc advisor, well, all three of my advisors died,
[02:26:42.620 --> 02:26:44.900]   suicide, cancer, cancer.
[02:26:44.900 --> 02:26:47.060]   So the joke is you don't want me to work for you,
[02:26:47.060 --> 02:26:50.340]   but in all seriousness, and I was very, very close
[02:26:50.340 --> 02:26:53.580]   with the middle one, but the last one as well.
[02:26:53.580 --> 02:26:57.740]   And he died of pancreatic cancer, as it were.
[02:26:57.740 --> 02:27:01.460]   And we did multiple feshthrifts for him,
[02:27:01.460 --> 02:27:02.740]   celebrations of life, right?
[02:27:02.740 --> 02:27:03.820]   You know, there's like in academia,
[02:27:03.820 --> 02:27:06.180]   they can't get enough feshthrifts and this, you know.
[02:27:06.180 --> 02:27:08.220]   And I'll never forget Ben getting up
[02:27:08.220 --> 02:27:10.900]   the celebration of life
[02:27:10.900 --> 02:27:12.980]   in front of all the big ups at Stanford
[02:27:12.980 --> 02:27:14.860]   and all these people and editors flew in.
[02:27:14.860 --> 02:27:16.620]   I mean, they were like over 200 people there,
[02:27:16.620 --> 02:27:18.220]   president of Stanford was there.
[02:27:18.220 --> 02:27:19.060]   And he said, you know,
[02:27:19.060 --> 02:27:23.340]   if I had known that I was going to be so celebrated
[02:27:23.340 --> 02:27:24.900]   and that people were going to be so kind to me,
[02:27:24.900 --> 02:27:27.320]   I would have died a lot earlier, you know.
[02:27:27.880 --> 02:27:29.080]   That was the first thing he said.
[02:27:29.080 --> 02:27:30.680]   And the second thing he said is,
[02:27:30.680 --> 02:27:34.640]   you know, if I could do it over again,
[02:27:34.640 --> 02:27:37.040]   you know, one of these, if I could do it over again things,
[02:27:37.040 --> 02:27:42.040]   he said, I would have never agreed to review so many papers,
[02:27:42.040 --> 02:27:43.920]   review so many grants,
[02:27:43.920 --> 02:27:46.280]   and I would have eaten a lot more sushi
[02:27:46.280 --> 02:27:48.220]   and a lot more ice cream.
[02:27:48.220 --> 02:27:49.120]   And that was it.
[02:27:49.120 --> 02:27:51.600]   He had a good relationship with death.
[02:27:51.600 --> 02:27:54.880]   I interviewed him for hours, even before I had a podcast.
[02:27:54.880 --> 02:27:56.560]   - Yeah, I don't think people,
[02:27:56.560 --> 02:27:58.800]   when people are afraid of death,
[02:27:58.800 --> 02:28:01.240]   I don't think it's really death that they're afraid of.
[02:28:01.240 --> 02:28:03.480]   They're afraid of pain.
[02:28:03.480 --> 02:28:07.760]   And that, you know, and having no control at that moment.
[02:28:07.760 --> 02:28:10.880]   The old people I know, studying this for so long,
[02:28:10.880 --> 02:28:14.960]   I know lots of very old people.
[02:28:14.960 --> 02:28:17.040]   None of them seem to be afraid of death.
[02:28:17.040 --> 02:28:19.660]   In fact, I ended my counterclockwise book
[02:28:19.660 --> 02:28:21.920]   with a conversation I was having
[02:28:21.920 --> 02:28:25.080]   with a friend who was 90 something.
[02:28:25.080 --> 02:28:28.440]   And she said, you know, Ellen, I'm not afraid of dying,
[02:28:28.440 --> 02:28:30.620]   but living is such fun.
[02:28:30.620 --> 02:28:33.880]   And I think that that's the way most of us should be.
[02:28:33.880 --> 02:28:36.240]   But there's something I wanted to say
[02:28:36.240 --> 02:28:38.480]   that we touched on before,
[02:28:38.480 --> 02:28:41.200]   and I don't think, it's not really relevant now,
[02:28:41.200 --> 02:28:42.400]   but you'll find a way to,
[02:28:42.400 --> 02:28:44.160]   I'll find a way to make it relevant,
[02:28:44.160 --> 02:28:46.360]   about spontaneous remissions.
[02:28:46.360 --> 02:28:50.400]   You know, I said that with my mother,
[02:28:50.400 --> 02:28:52.000]   there was a spontaneous remission,
[02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:56.320]   and the medical world can't study spontaneous remissions,
[02:28:56.320 --> 02:28:59.760]   or doesn't study, so they seem infrequent.
[02:28:59.760 --> 02:29:03.020]   And I think, you know, that,
[02:29:03.020 --> 02:29:06.560]   how frequent does something have to be
[02:29:06.560 --> 02:29:10.800]   to give people a sense of hope that it's possible?
[02:29:10.800 --> 02:29:13.840]   You know, I don't think it has to be an everyday occurrence.
[02:29:13.840 --> 02:29:16.300]   Of course, the more frequent it is, the more likely,
[02:29:16.300 --> 02:29:18.360]   and then, you know.
[02:29:18.360 --> 02:29:21.360]   But when I think about spontaneous remissions,
[02:29:21.360 --> 02:29:25.240]   and I personally think that they're much more common
[02:29:25.240 --> 02:29:29.240]   than the medical world is likely to believe.
[02:29:29.240 --> 02:29:31.400]   You know, once you're in a hospital,
[02:29:31.400 --> 02:29:34.320]   life is very different from the way
[02:29:34.320 --> 02:29:38.140]   your health is once you're out of the hospital.
[02:29:38.140 --> 02:29:39.760]   I don't mean that you're sick in one case
[02:29:39.760 --> 02:29:41.380]   and not sick in the other,
[02:29:41.380 --> 02:29:43.920]   but the attention that's given to it,
[02:29:43.920 --> 02:29:48.640]   the degree to which things become self-fulfilling prophecies,
[02:29:48.640 --> 02:29:51.920]   you know, I think that if you believe
[02:29:51.920 --> 02:29:53.320]   that cancer is a killer,
[02:29:53.320 --> 02:29:55.920]   which is what people used to believe,
[02:29:55.920 --> 02:29:58.300]   then I think there are many ways
[02:29:58.300 --> 02:30:02.400]   that the cancer becomes a death sentence.
[02:30:02.400 --> 02:30:06.160]   You know, that the body learns to,
[02:30:06.160 --> 02:30:09.520]   well, you don't, even in a very mundane way,
[02:30:09.520 --> 02:30:10.840]   if you think you're going to die,
[02:30:10.840 --> 02:30:14.400]   you don't do those things that keep you alive.
[02:30:14.400 --> 02:30:16.440]   You know, you're not gonna go out and get exercise,
[02:30:16.440 --> 02:30:18.720]   for example, if you thought that was good for you.
[02:30:18.720 --> 02:30:20.440]   I mean, I'm gonna die anyway.
[02:30:20.440 --> 02:30:23.600]   The will to live is a very interesting thing.
[02:30:23.600 --> 02:30:26.520]   These super agers, the people that fall into that category.
[02:30:26.520 --> 02:30:28.200]   I hate that.
[02:30:28.200 --> 02:30:29.480]   No, I'm serious.
[02:30:29.480 --> 02:30:31.840]   Super memorizers, super tasters.
[02:30:31.840 --> 02:30:35.120]   As soon as we make a group of people, the super group,
[02:30:35.120 --> 02:30:38.120]   that says that whatever they're able to do
[02:30:38.120 --> 02:30:40.340]   is not available to everybody else,
[02:30:40.340 --> 02:30:43.120]   and I don't think that there's any evidence for that.
[02:30:43.120 --> 02:30:44.960]   Yeah, well, I align with you on that stance.
[02:30:44.960 --> 02:30:47.480]   I mean, I use the name only
[02:30:47.480 --> 02:30:49.760]   'cause they're sometimes referenced as such,
[02:30:49.760 --> 02:30:53.360]   but a focus of the podcast recently has been to emphasize
[02:30:53.360 --> 02:30:55.760]   that in that group and others,
[02:30:55.760 --> 02:30:59.060]   there's a brain area that's available to everybody
[02:30:59.060 --> 02:31:00.080]   'cause everybody has it,
[02:31:00.080 --> 02:31:02.040]   which is this anterior mid-cingulate cortex,
[02:31:02.040 --> 02:31:04.560]   which is activated when people embrace new forms
[02:31:04.560 --> 02:31:05.840]   of learning and challenges,
[02:31:05.840 --> 02:31:07.400]   and it does seem to correlate
[02:31:07.400 --> 02:31:10.500]   with maintaining cognitive function into later age,
[02:31:10.500 --> 02:31:13.400]   and it's roped into, excuse me,
[02:31:13.400 --> 02:31:14.600]   neurally it is roped into,
[02:31:14.600 --> 02:31:17.200]   it's linked up with the dopamine reward circuitry
[02:31:17.200 --> 02:31:20.260]   and other circuitries in a way that ties it somewhat
[02:31:20.260 --> 02:31:21.960]   to this notion of the will to live
[02:31:21.960 --> 02:31:26.560]   being related to the embracing new learnings
[02:31:26.560 --> 02:31:27.680]   or at least new challenges.
[02:31:27.680 --> 02:31:32.280]   You know that there was a story way back when,
[02:31:32.280 --> 02:31:36.600]   so there's this mental facility
[02:31:36.600 --> 02:31:39.080]   and people are on what's,
[02:31:40.680 --> 02:31:43.680]   their vernacular called the hopeless ward,
[02:31:43.680 --> 02:31:45.960]   and then they wanted to renovate the ward
[02:31:45.960 --> 02:31:47.720]   so they move all of the people.
[02:31:47.720 --> 02:31:49.000]   So you're in the hopeless ward,
[02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:52.200]   now you're in a hopeful without it being called that.
[02:31:52.200 --> 02:31:54.320]   Then the renovation is finished
[02:31:54.320 --> 02:31:56.680]   and people are returned to their old rooms
[02:31:56.680 --> 02:31:59.400]   and many unexpected deaths occurred.
[02:31:59.400 --> 02:32:02.660]   - This makes me wonder why we have names for hospitals,
[02:32:02.660 --> 02:32:04.560]   like Hospital for Sick Children.
[02:32:04.560 --> 02:32:05.400]   - Yeah.
[02:32:05.400 --> 02:32:06.880]   - I've always been bothered by that title.
[02:32:06.880 --> 02:32:09.280]   Sorry for anyone that's been treated there
[02:32:09.280 --> 02:32:10.200]   and had a great experience
[02:32:10.200 --> 02:32:12.160]   'cause I imagine it's a great hospital, but-
[02:32:12.160 --> 02:32:13.920]   - Did you read "The Mindful Body"?
[02:32:13.920 --> 02:32:15.860]   I talk about a mindful hospital,
[02:32:15.860 --> 02:32:19.200]   which would be different from the ground up.
[02:32:19.200 --> 02:32:21.080]   And I'm now trying to,
[02:32:21.080 --> 02:32:24.100]   in Mexico,
[02:32:24.100 --> 02:32:26.700]   Canada,
[02:32:26.700 --> 02:32:31.160]   in the States, Minnesota,
[02:32:31.160 --> 02:32:32.860]   trying to put up at least,
[02:32:32.860 --> 02:32:35.440]   start with a mindful emergency ward
[02:32:35.440 --> 02:32:37.920]   and then become a whole mindful hospital.
[02:32:37.920 --> 02:32:38.760]   - Why don't they call it-
[02:32:38.760 --> 02:32:39.880]   - It should be very different.
[02:32:39.880 --> 02:32:41.800]   I mean, for the reasons that I'm presuming
[02:32:41.800 --> 02:32:42.640]   you're getting that.
[02:32:42.640 --> 02:32:44.760]   But, you know, do you know anybody
[02:32:44.760 --> 02:32:47.360]   who's ever walked through a hospital door
[02:32:47.360 --> 02:32:49.360]   that isn't stressed?
[02:32:49.360 --> 02:32:50.200]   I mean, no.
[02:32:50.200 --> 02:32:51.560]   - No, only walking out.
[02:32:51.560 --> 02:32:52.380]   (laughing)
[02:32:52.380 --> 02:32:53.220]   - Yeah, no.
[02:32:53.220 --> 02:32:57.520]   But, and I believe that stress is by far the major killer.
[02:32:57.520 --> 02:32:59.520]   It's a very extreme position, Andrew.
[02:32:59.520 --> 02:33:01.200]   I believe, I was gonna do this work
[02:33:01.200 --> 02:33:03.320]   with people in China before COVID.
[02:33:03.320 --> 02:33:05.400]   We take, let's say a few hundred people
[02:33:05.400 --> 02:33:07.920]   who are just diagnosed with cancer,
[02:33:07.920 --> 02:33:09.920]   vary the cancer.
[02:33:09.920 --> 02:33:12.440]   And we find out how stressed they are.
[02:33:12.440 --> 02:33:15.840]   And nobody's gonna be happy being told they have cancer.
[02:33:15.840 --> 02:33:17.000]   So we give them a little while.
[02:33:17.000 --> 02:33:19.760]   It's given them three weeks to adjust to it.
[02:33:19.760 --> 02:33:23.480]   Then we measure their stress level every three, four weeks.
[02:33:23.480 --> 02:33:27.460]   I believe the stress level will predict
[02:33:27.460 --> 02:33:30.400]   the course of the disease over and above
[02:33:30.400 --> 02:33:33.760]   nutrition, genetics, and treatment.
[02:33:33.760 --> 02:33:37.200]   And stress is psychological,
[02:33:37.200 --> 02:33:39.720]   which takes me back to how all of this
[02:33:39.720 --> 02:33:43.120]   can be controlled by our minds.
[02:33:43.120 --> 02:33:44.600]   But anyway, so you go to a hospital,
[02:33:44.600 --> 02:33:46.880]   the first thing you are is stressed.
[02:33:46.880 --> 02:33:49.760]   You have the people working in the hospital
[02:33:49.760 --> 02:33:51.600]   who, especially during COVID,
[02:33:51.600 --> 02:33:53.160]   but it was always the case,
[02:33:53.160 --> 02:33:55.280]   suffer an enormous amount of burnout.
[02:33:55.280 --> 02:33:56.940]   Well, what is burnout?
[02:33:56.940 --> 02:33:59.440]   You don't get burnout if you're mindful.
[02:33:59.440 --> 02:34:01.620]   You know, if I'm seeing you every day
[02:34:01.620 --> 02:34:05.240]   and I'm presuming you're the same Andrew I've seen before,
[02:34:05.240 --> 02:34:06.920]   your symptoms are basically the same.
[02:34:06.920 --> 02:34:08.400]   I was, how are you, Andrew?
[02:34:08.400 --> 02:34:09.720]   I take your temperature.
[02:34:09.720 --> 02:34:11.720]   Everything is pretty much the same.
[02:34:11.720 --> 02:34:15.360]   It can be exhausting because I'm not getting anything.
[02:34:15.360 --> 02:34:16.720]   If on the other hand,
[02:34:16.720 --> 02:34:19.080]   I'm noticing all the new things about you,
[02:34:19.080 --> 02:34:23.480]   then I'm being fed and my neurons are firing
[02:34:23.480 --> 02:34:25.480]   and I'm not going to burn out.
[02:34:25.480 --> 02:34:27.080]   Then we have lots of simple things.
[02:34:27.080 --> 02:34:28.880]   So when I was talking to Atul one day,
[02:34:28.880 --> 02:34:31.480]   he did some wonderful work on checklists.
[02:34:31.480 --> 02:34:34.080]   And, you know, in surgery, for instance,
[02:34:34.080 --> 02:34:35.320]   if they have a checklist,
[02:34:35.320 --> 02:34:38.040]   there are many fewer errors that are made.
[02:34:38.040 --> 02:34:40.280]   But he had just, you know,
[02:34:40.280 --> 02:34:42.400]   sent the last draft to the publisher.
[02:34:42.400 --> 02:34:44.480]   So he wasn't going to be able to change it.
[02:34:44.480 --> 02:34:46.600]   I said, we need a mindful checklist.
[02:34:46.600 --> 02:34:47.840]   What is a mindful checklist?
[02:34:47.840 --> 02:34:50.800]   And you remember when we used to travel
[02:34:50.800 --> 02:34:52.240]   and you come back to the States
[02:34:52.240 --> 02:34:53.760]   and you had to fill out these forms
[02:34:53.760 --> 02:34:55.560]   and you're bringing any livestock.
[02:34:55.560 --> 02:34:57.640]   Now, do you have any fruits and vegetables?
[02:34:57.640 --> 02:34:58.760]   You answer three of these
[02:34:58.760 --> 02:35:00.040]   and you don't answer any of the other.
[02:35:00.040 --> 02:35:02.400]   You just know it's no, no, no, all the way down the list.
[02:35:02.400 --> 02:35:06.960]   So a checklist, and even the checklist in aviation,
[02:35:06.960 --> 02:35:11.160]   you know, the pilot, co-pilot flaps up,
[02:35:11.160 --> 02:35:18.200]   throttle open, anti-ice off, it becomes mindless.
[02:35:18.200 --> 02:35:22.080]   So remember the plane that was going from,
[02:35:22.080 --> 02:35:23.240]   the Air Florida flight,
[02:35:23.240 --> 02:35:26.920]   going from Florida to Washington DC.
[02:35:26.920 --> 02:35:30.320]   So that's one warm climate to another warm climate.
[02:35:30.320 --> 02:35:34.520]   And they got flaps up, throttle open, anti-ice off,
[02:35:34.520 --> 02:35:38.920]   but there was a snow in DC, an unusual event.
[02:35:38.920 --> 02:35:41.800]   The plane crashed because the de-icer was turned off
[02:35:41.800 --> 02:35:43.680]   and people were killed.
[02:35:43.680 --> 02:35:47.240]   And the point of it is that a checklist,
[02:35:47.240 --> 02:35:49.080]   well, better than no checklist,
[02:35:49.080 --> 02:35:50.840]   there's a better than better way.
[02:35:50.840 --> 02:35:54.080]   And we talk a lot about that in "The Mindful Body,"
[02:35:54.080 --> 02:35:57.480]   that the checklist needs to be a mindful checklist.
[02:35:57.480 --> 02:36:00.800]   So not, is Andrew in bed?
[02:36:00.800 --> 02:36:01.640]   Yes.
[02:36:01.640 --> 02:36:04.520]   What position is Andrew in, in the bed?
[02:36:04.520 --> 02:36:07.880]   You know, not, does Andrew have two eyes?
[02:36:07.880 --> 02:36:11.160]   But, you know, how much liquid can you see?
[02:36:11.160 --> 02:36:13.800]   So not yes, no, going beyond yes, no.
[02:36:13.800 --> 02:36:16.000]   Where you can only answer the question
[02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:18.120]   if you're actually looking at the person.
[02:36:18.120 --> 02:36:19.320]   So then you're noticing.
[02:36:19.320 --> 02:36:21.360]   Now, the wonderful thing about that is,
[02:36:21.360 --> 02:36:25.960]   if I'm noticing you and being mindful about aspects of you,
[02:36:25.960 --> 02:36:27.640]   you feel noticed.
[02:36:27.640 --> 02:36:29.760]   And that's the way you feel cared for.
[02:36:29.760 --> 02:36:32.080]   And then the relationship grows.
[02:36:32.080 --> 02:36:37.080]   It keeps coming back to powers of observation,
[02:36:37.080 --> 02:36:42.080]   asking questions, depth, as opposed to speed.
[02:36:42.080 --> 02:36:42.920]   Yeah.
[02:36:42.920 --> 02:36:45.800]   These seem to be the kind of basic contour.
[02:36:45.800 --> 02:36:49.760]   Yes, but it all follows from recognizing you don't know.
[02:36:49.760 --> 02:36:52.560]   So how do we get people to actually look
[02:36:52.560 --> 02:36:55.080]   for the changes in people?
[02:36:55.080 --> 02:36:58.200]   When I was talking about attention to symptom variability,
[02:36:58.200 --> 02:36:59.040]   and I said before,
[02:36:59.040 --> 02:37:02.920]   imagine you're with somebody who is,
[02:37:02.920 --> 02:37:05.840]   you think they're losing it, they're forgetting.
[02:37:05.840 --> 02:37:08.680]   Now, if you think they're forgetting,
[02:37:08.680 --> 02:37:11.400]   you become intolerant every time they forget something,
[02:37:11.400 --> 02:37:13.720]   because you forgot that it's not willful.
[02:37:13.720 --> 02:37:15.640]   They really just don't remember, number one.
[02:37:15.640 --> 02:37:18.520]   Number two, the only time you're paying attention
[02:37:18.520 --> 02:37:19.560]   is when they're forgetting.
[02:37:19.560 --> 02:37:23.760]   So you've not attended to all the times they're remembering.
[02:37:23.760 --> 02:37:27.200]   So the problem seems worse.
[02:37:27.200 --> 02:37:30.000]   But if you were, in fact, attending
[02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:33.360]   to when are they misremembering,
[02:37:33.360 --> 02:37:36.560]   what are the circumstances, and you catch it early,
[02:37:36.560 --> 02:37:39.480]   you see that the person doesn't forget everything.
[02:37:39.480 --> 02:37:42.080]   They forget, I don't know,
[02:37:42.080 --> 02:37:45.040]   questions about restaurants, for example.
[02:37:45.040 --> 02:37:47.560]   Well, then, you know, probably they don't care.
[02:37:47.560 --> 02:37:48.640]   I'm gonna be happy.
[02:37:48.640 --> 02:37:49.480]   I'm an eater.
[02:37:49.480 --> 02:37:51.360]   I'm gonna be happy wherever we go.
[02:37:51.360 --> 02:37:53.840]   And so, unless we're going to someplace
[02:37:53.840 --> 02:37:55.760]   that's phenomenally expensive,
[02:37:55.760 --> 02:37:57.920]   or we have to travel a great, you know,
[02:37:57.920 --> 02:38:00.240]   whether we went to restaurant A, B, or C,
[02:38:00.240 --> 02:38:01.840]   I might not remember.
[02:38:01.840 --> 02:38:04.360]   For you, since you're very discerning,
[02:38:04.360 --> 02:38:06.920]   you're gonna know you had a wonderful meal here
[02:38:06.920 --> 02:38:09.440]   and a horrible meal in the other three places.
[02:38:09.440 --> 02:38:10.840]   So for you, it matters.
[02:38:10.840 --> 02:38:13.240]   The point is, when somebody doesn't know,
[02:38:13.240 --> 02:38:15.040]   why don't they know?
[02:38:15.040 --> 02:38:19.160]   And if you immediately assume it's because of dementia,
[02:38:19.160 --> 02:38:22.760]   you have a catch-all and are missing all of the subtleties
[02:38:22.760 --> 02:38:25.400]   that, in fact, would lead to different diagnoses.
[02:38:25.400 --> 02:38:28.080]   And so, if the, this, you know,
[02:38:28.080 --> 02:38:31.880]   the same thing in the nurse or doctor
[02:38:31.880 --> 02:38:33.480]   attending to the patient,
[02:38:33.480 --> 02:38:35.320]   if they're attending to the changes
[02:38:35.320 --> 02:38:37.240]   and asking themselves why,
[02:38:37.240 --> 02:38:41.400]   the smaller changes and the things that are not changing.
[02:38:41.400 --> 02:38:46.320]   Now, I had a student many years ago who had MS,
[02:38:46.320 --> 02:38:49.320]   and when somebody would ask her how she is, she's great.
[02:38:49.320 --> 02:38:51.920]   You know, and then one person then said,
[02:38:51.920 --> 02:38:53.400]   but how could you be gracious?
[02:38:53.400 --> 02:38:55.600]   My arms work, my head is working, you know,
[02:38:55.600 --> 02:38:57.520]   and went through all the parts of her
[02:38:57.520 --> 02:39:00.560]   that are not suffering, you know.
[02:39:00.560 --> 02:39:02.920]   So you can always attend to what's wrong.
[02:39:02.920 --> 02:39:04.480]   You can't attend to everything.
[02:39:04.480 --> 02:39:05.720]   You know, playing tennis,
[02:39:05.720 --> 02:39:08.000]   you could attend to the wonderful shots you made,
[02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:11.880]   you can attend to the faults, you know,
[02:39:11.880 --> 02:39:15.200]   and that's gonna lead to very different states, right?
[02:39:15.200 --> 02:39:18.640]   If I attend to every time I hit that ball in a way
[02:39:18.640 --> 02:39:19.600]   I didn't think I could hit it,
[02:39:19.600 --> 02:39:20.920]   I'm gonna learn something from it
[02:39:20.920 --> 02:39:23.040]   and be motivated to try it again.
[02:39:23.040 --> 02:39:25.760]   If I attend to every time I screwed up,
[02:39:25.760 --> 02:39:27.520]   I'm gonna, you know, be embarrassed,
[02:39:27.520 --> 02:39:32.520]   I'm gonna be afraid to expand and experience new things.
[02:39:32.520 --> 02:39:36.320]   - I feel like-
[02:39:36.320 --> 02:39:38.240]   - I've just combined 12 different areas.
[02:39:38.240 --> 02:39:40.480]   - Yeah, and masterfully, and masterfully.
[02:39:40.480 --> 02:39:42.880]   Yeah, masterfully, and what I realized
[02:39:42.960 --> 02:39:47.120]   is that we're always to some extent in choice, as they say.
[02:39:47.120 --> 02:39:50.360]   And I think to some people that will feel freeing,
[02:39:50.360 --> 02:39:52.480]   like, you know, I'm always in choice.
[02:39:52.480 --> 02:39:54.880]   I can, my house burned down.
[02:39:54.880 --> 02:39:56.800]   Well, you know, who knows what newness
[02:39:56.800 --> 02:39:58.960]   that will bring, these kinds of things.
[02:39:58.960 --> 02:40:00.440]   But to some people-
[02:40:00.440 --> 02:40:04.520]   - Only if they believe that there's a right answer.
[02:40:04.520 --> 02:40:07.160]   If you don't believe there's a right answer,
[02:40:07.160 --> 02:40:08.320]   if you believe there's a right answer,
[02:40:08.320 --> 02:40:09.960]   you want someone to give me that answer.
[02:40:09.960 --> 02:40:11.480]   Which surgery should I have?
[02:40:11.480 --> 02:40:13.800]   Oh my God, I'm supposed to have a house, the house burned.
[02:40:13.800 --> 02:40:15.680]   You know, life is over.
[02:40:15.680 --> 02:40:19.080]   But if you realize that any experience
[02:40:19.080 --> 02:40:24.080]   is only experience through you and provides opportunities.
[02:40:24.080 --> 02:40:28.000]   - I can certainly adopt that.
[02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:30.880]   I also can feel the parts of me that I assume
[02:40:30.880 --> 02:40:33.640]   are what other people experience as well,
[02:40:33.640 --> 02:40:38.040]   which is that when one has so many degrees of freedom
[02:40:38.040 --> 02:40:41.320]   over how to respond, that itself can feel
[02:40:41.320 --> 02:40:42.840]   a bit overwhelming. - No, of course.
[02:40:42.840 --> 02:40:45.960]   So when Eric Fromm wrote "Escape from Freedom,"
[02:40:45.960 --> 02:40:50.080]   it was that same idea that you can be paralyzed
[02:40:50.080 --> 02:40:51.440]   by so many choices.
[02:40:51.440 --> 02:40:53.200]   But I think that's wrong.
[02:40:53.200 --> 02:40:55.920]   I think you're only paralyzed by the choices
[02:40:55.920 --> 02:40:58.320]   if implicitly you believe there's a right
[02:40:58.320 --> 02:40:59.880]   and a wrong choice.
[02:40:59.880 --> 02:41:02.520]   And when you recognize that they're all equal,
[02:41:02.520 --> 02:41:04.320]   it just doesn't matter.
[02:41:04.320 --> 02:41:06.400]   It's easy to choose them.
[02:41:06.400 --> 02:41:07.960]   - So it's choose your own adventure.
[02:41:07.960 --> 02:41:09.480]   - Exactly, yeah.
[02:41:09.480 --> 02:41:12.080]   And that, or make whatever you're doing an adventure.
[02:41:12.080 --> 02:41:13.720]   And if I can't be near the one I love,
[02:41:13.720 --> 02:41:15.880]   I should love the one I'm near.
[02:41:15.880 --> 02:41:18.480]   - I mean, at one time that was considered okay.
[02:41:18.480 --> 02:41:20.520]   Nowadays, well, nowadays there are a couple of things
[02:41:20.520 --> 02:41:23.560]   that are more complicated, I would argue.
[02:41:23.560 --> 02:41:27.600]   One, earlier you mentioned coddling of people
[02:41:27.600 --> 02:41:31.200]   that are, you know, aged, elderly.
[02:41:31.200 --> 02:41:33.400]   - I hate that word now that I'm 77.
[02:41:33.400 --> 02:41:37.920]   - Well, you are, no one would guess that you're 77.
[02:41:37.920 --> 02:41:41.200]   And yeah, your vitality is undeniable.
[02:41:41.200 --> 02:41:43.280]   This notion of coddling, you know,
[02:41:43.280 --> 02:41:46.680]   Jonathan Haidt wrote "The Coddling of the American Mind,"
[02:41:46.680 --> 02:41:48.040]   "Anxious Generation."
[02:41:48.040 --> 02:41:50.920]   I have to wonder what it's like for kids growing up nowadays
[02:41:50.920 --> 02:41:54.000]   and teenagers constantly being told about this disorder
[02:41:54.000 --> 02:41:57.680]   and that disorder and the idea that, you know,
[02:41:57.680 --> 02:42:00.360]   if you meet five out of 10 of the, you know,
[02:42:00.360 --> 02:42:03.120]   menu of criteria that you are,
[02:42:03.120 --> 02:42:04.520]   you might even be this thing.
[02:42:04.520 --> 02:42:07.120]   You are blank as opposed to just having blank
[02:42:07.120 --> 02:42:07.960]   or struggling with blank.
[02:42:07.960 --> 02:42:09.000]   - Everything is, yeah.
[02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:13.480]   - Yeah, and we certainly over prescribe medication
[02:42:13.480 --> 02:42:16.640]   in this country, certainly compared to other countries.
[02:42:16.640 --> 02:42:18.760]   You know, the vast amount of antidepressant
[02:42:18.760 --> 02:42:21.760]   and anti-anxiety medication is consumed in the United States
[02:42:21.760 --> 02:42:25.920]   and certainly those medications can be valuable for people,
[02:42:25.920 --> 02:42:29.800]   I would argue, but they are over prescribed,
[02:42:29.800 --> 02:42:30.920]   I would also argue.
[02:42:30.920 --> 02:42:35.000]   So my question is, if one grows up being told
[02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:38.880]   that they are fragile, that there's threat everywhere
[02:42:38.880 --> 02:42:41.000]   or even that there's threat everywhere on social media,
[02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:44.920]   let's just like push into that dent a little bit too,
[02:42:44.920 --> 02:42:48.140]   because that's Jonathan's idea.
[02:42:48.140 --> 02:42:51.360]   You know, sitting here talking to you,
[02:42:51.360 --> 02:42:56.360]   that now has me thinking, well, maybe my 18 year old niece
[02:42:56.360 --> 02:43:00.840]   is perfectly capable of navigating this online landscape
[02:43:00.840 --> 02:43:02.800]   and it's just me who's not capable of it.
[02:43:02.800 --> 02:43:05.840]   And so I'm gonna decide that she's struggling,
[02:43:05.840 --> 02:43:07.800]   but maybe kids aren't getting enough physical activity,
[02:43:07.800 --> 02:43:10.600]   one could argue, but on the basis of data,
[02:43:10.600 --> 02:43:11.760]   but do you see where I'm going here?
[02:43:11.760 --> 02:43:14.480]   When one can kind of pivot to different lenses
[02:43:14.480 --> 02:43:16.480]   to look at something through,
[02:43:16.480 --> 02:43:19.200]   it increases the number of options.
[02:43:19.200 --> 02:43:20.400]   But then at some point we have to decide,
[02:43:20.400 --> 02:43:22.200]   are we coddling our kids too much
[02:43:22.200 --> 02:43:25.560]   or are we not coddling them too much?
[02:43:25.560 --> 02:43:28.520]   - It reminds me of an argument back,
[02:43:28.520 --> 02:43:30.520]   I guess when I was your age.
[02:43:30.520 --> 02:43:35.160]   And the question was violence on TV
[02:43:35.160 --> 02:43:37.960]   and were kids being exposed to this violence,
[02:43:37.960 --> 02:43:39.480]   becoming more violent.
[02:43:39.480 --> 02:43:41.640]   And I never quite understood it
[02:43:41.640 --> 02:43:45.000]   because if you were my child
[02:43:45.000 --> 02:43:47.800]   and we were sitting there watching this violence,
[02:43:47.800 --> 02:43:51.880]   I go, oh, and you would see my reaction to it was negative.
[02:43:51.880 --> 02:43:55.720]   And you'd learn not to engage in that
[02:43:55.720 --> 02:44:00.320]   or to recognize the effects on other people.
[02:44:00.320 --> 02:44:04.360]   What I'm saying is that rather than the medium
[02:44:04.360 --> 02:44:09.360]   being the message, the medium...
[02:44:09.360 --> 02:44:12.000]   People say to me, is technology good?
[02:44:12.000 --> 02:44:14.240]   Technology isn't anything, the tools.
[02:44:14.240 --> 02:44:16.720]   And if they're used mindfully, they're good.
[02:44:16.720 --> 02:44:19.800]   If they're used mindlessly, they're not good.
[02:44:19.800 --> 02:44:24.640]   And so I think it's silly.
[02:44:24.640 --> 02:44:29.640]   There's data showing that kids who are college kids,
[02:44:30.400 --> 02:44:33.240]   for example, who use a lot of social media
[02:44:33.240 --> 02:44:35.520]   have lower self-esteem and all of this.
[02:44:35.520 --> 02:44:39.040]   And I present this to them and I say, this is silly.
[02:44:39.040 --> 02:44:41.720]   You're not now gonna get off Facebook
[02:44:41.720 --> 02:44:43.880]   because of these data, but let's look at it.
[02:44:43.880 --> 02:44:46.720]   You're Harvard students for God's sakes.
[02:44:46.720 --> 02:44:49.800]   Why is it that you're only gonna post the picture
[02:44:49.800 --> 02:44:51.400]   where you look the prettiest?
[02:44:51.400 --> 02:44:55.640]   Have the nerve to turn it around.
[02:44:55.640 --> 02:44:58.200]   Hey, would you believe what I look like last night?
[02:44:59.360 --> 02:45:01.760]   When you're having that bad hair day
[02:45:01.760 --> 02:45:03.200]   or something didn't go well.
[02:45:03.200 --> 02:45:05.080]   Just have the guts to do that.
[02:45:05.080 --> 02:45:07.240]   So it's not the social media.
[02:45:07.240 --> 02:45:12.200]   It's the lying that, or the mistaken assumption
[02:45:12.200 --> 02:45:16.200]   when you see all of the successes,
[02:45:16.200 --> 02:45:18.880]   that that's the more general truth.
[02:45:18.880 --> 02:45:21.540]   Everybody but you is having these successes.
[02:45:21.540 --> 02:45:27.860]   - Yeah, certainly social media gives it a literal score
[02:45:27.860 --> 02:45:30.400]   for followers and likes and things of that sort.
[02:45:30.400 --> 02:45:32.440]   So it's thumbs up, thumbs down.
[02:45:32.440 --> 02:45:35.120]   I mean, literally scoring performance
[02:45:35.120 --> 02:45:36.680]   in terms of what other people think.
[02:45:36.680 --> 02:45:40.320]   It's certainly training those circuits very robustly,
[02:45:40.320 --> 02:45:41.160]   whereas-
[02:45:41.160 --> 02:45:42.720]   - But if people learn the three levels
[02:45:42.720 --> 02:45:45.800]   that I was explaining before,
[02:45:45.800 --> 02:45:49.520]   then you'd see that what looks like is not very good,
[02:45:49.520 --> 02:45:51.960]   in fact, may be quite something.
[02:45:51.960 --> 02:45:55.740]   You know, you have people who are poor
[02:45:55.740 --> 02:46:00.080]   and they can't spend a lot of money on their appearance.
[02:46:00.080 --> 02:46:01.280]   And then you have everybody else
[02:46:01.280 --> 02:46:03.360]   is spending a lot of money on their appearance.
[02:46:03.360 --> 02:46:06.600]   They'd have some of these very, very rich people who,
[02:46:06.600 --> 02:46:11.600]   yeah, I had this editor for Mindfulness, wonderful woman.
[02:46:11.600 --> 02:46:15.840]   She has recently died.
[02:46:15.840 --> 02:46:19.440]   And the first time we went out,
[02:46:19.440 --> 02:46:22.520]   this is when I was young and it was wonderful
[02:46:22.520 --> 02:46:25.000]   how they're gonna send me all these free books
[02:46:25.000 --> 02:46:26.360]   and they take me out all the time
[02:46:26.360 --> 02:46:27.980]   to get me to publish with this company
[02:46:27.980 --> 02:46:29.760]   as opposed to that company.
[02:46:29.760 --> 02:46:31.200]   And I'll never forget this.
[02:46:31.200 --> 02:46:35.720]   We go for this meal and she looked poor.
[02:46:35.720 --> 02:46:38.440]   So I didn't eat anything.
[02:46:38.440 --> 02:46:40.880]   I chose the cheapest thing on the menu
[02:46:40.880 --> 02:46:42.200]   because I knew she was paying.
[02:46:42.200 --> 02:46:44.120]   And I found out she was one of the richest people
[02:46:44.120 --> 02:46:46.360]   in New England, you know.
[02:46:46.360 --> 02:46:49.080]   So that's the level three where you have so much,
[02:46:49.080 --> 02:46:50.760]   you hide it and, you know.
[02:46:50.760 --> 02:46:52.440]   - Well, this is interesting because, you know,
[02:46:52.440 --> 02:46:53.720]   when I was growing up,
[02:46:53.720 --> 02:46:55.640]   unless people had money to purchase things,
[02:46:55.640 --> 02:46:58.840]   they would drive older cars and things like that.
[02:46:58.840 --> 02:47:00.360]   With credit, that changed.
[02:47:00.360 --> 02:47:01.520]   - Yeah.
[02:47:01.520 --> 02:47:04.780]   - And I have friends who like to wear
[02:47:04.780 --> 02:47:06.440]   very, very fancy watches.
[02:47:06.440 --> 02:47:09.760]   I also have friends who have far more money than them
[02:47:09.760 --> 02:47:12.200]   and choose to wear no watch.
[02:47:12.200 --> 02:47:15.280]   So it's getting harder to discern,
[02:47:15.280 --> 02:47:17.240]   except at the extremes, of course.
[02:47:17.240 --> 02:47:19.320]   It's getting harder to discern who has what
[02:47:19.320 --> 02:47:21.200]   and maybe that's a good thing.
[02:47:21.200 --> 02:47:23.520]   Again, at the extremes, it's obvious, you know,
[02:47:23.520 --> 02:47:26.440]   the homeless issue in Los Angeles
[02:47:26.440 --> 02:47:29.320]   and everywhere in California is so troubling
[02:47:29.320 --> 02:47:32.120]   and so sad what's happening.
[02:47:32.120 --> 02:47:34.760]   But setting that aside,
[02:47:34.760 --> 02:47:37.400]   I think nowadays we have less information
[02:47:37.400 --> 02:47:39.960]   about people's values, even just by looking at them.
[02:47:39.960 --> 02:47:40.800]   When I was growing up,
[02:47:40.800 --> 02:47:42.240]   if somebody wore a particular t-shirt
[02:47:42.240 --> 02:47:43.240]   with a particular band,
[02:47:43.240 --> 02:47:45.040]   you kind of knew if you were part of the same group.
[02:47:45.040 --> 02:47:47.200]   All of that's gone now, it's all leveled.
[02:47:47.200 --> 02:47:50.840]   - Yeah, but people could be asked at any stage,
[02:47:50.840 --> 02:47:53.720]   why is somebody dressed this way?
[02:47:53.720 --> 02:47:55.760]   Why is somebody doing what they're doing?
[02:47:55.760 --> 02:47:59.840]   And when asked now, you're only given a single answer.
[02:47:59.840 --> 02:48:01.700]   When you're given multiple answers,
[02:48:01.700 --> 02:48:03.080]   you see the three levels.
[02:48:03.080 --> 02:48:05.520]   You know, they're doing it for this wonderful reason,
[02:48:05.520 --> 02:48:08.520]   for this awful reason, it has this meaning, that meaning,
[02:48:08.520 --> 02:48:10.720]   and that's what you want, things to be obscured.
[02:48:10.720 --> 02:48:13.200]   You don't want to be pigeonholed
[02:48:13.200 --> 02:48:17.400]   because if you think you know what I'm going to say
[02:48:17.400 --> 02:48:19.360]   because of this belief of who I am,
[02:48:19.360 --> 02:48:21.000]   you're not going to listen to me.
[02:48:21.000 --> 02:48:22.680]   And then we're not going to have a conversation
[02:48:22.680 --> 02:48:26.440]   that's going to be interesting, and that's a waste.
[02:48:26.440 --> 02:48:30.480]   - I know that you're not a fan of particular activities
[02:48:30.480 --> 02:48:32.320]   as a way to increase longevity,
[02:48:32.320 --> 02:48:34.920]   or particular activities as a way to increase mindfulness,
[02:48:34.920 --> 02:48:39.200]   but could we say that having somewhat of a mindset
[02:48:39.200 --> 02:48:43.000]   of playfulness with ideas and one's environment
[02:48:43.000 --> 02:48:45.720]   could potentiate longevity?
[02:48:45.720 --> 02:48:48.400]   - So I have these lyrics in the books.
[02:48:48.400 --> 02:48:51.120]   A friend of mine, Zoe Lewis, wonderful entertainer,
[02:48:51.120 --> 02:48:52.760]   and she sings a song that I just love,
[02:48:52.760 --> 02:48:54.600]   "You're Never Too Old to Be Young."
[02:48:54.600 --> 02:49:00.600]   And sure, I think that one should be playful to be playful.
[02:49:00.600 --> 02:49:04.160]   Now, a side effect of that is I think
[02:49:04.160 --> 02:49:05.960]   you'll be happier and healthier,
[02:49:05.960 --> 02:49:07.160]   and if you're happier and healthier,
[02:49:07.160 --> 02:49:08.840]   I think you'll live longer.
[02:49:08.840 --> 02:49:12.100]   But the reason to do it, the problem with most people now
[02:49:12.100 --> 02:49:15.360]   is that everything they're doing is for some other reason.
[02:49:15.360 --> 02:49:18.600]   I'm taking this medication so that eventually.
[02:49:18.600 --> 02:49:21.340]   I'm going to the gym so that eventually.
[02:49:21.340 --> 02:49:25.840]   I think who knows what's going to happen eventually.
[02:49:25.840 --> 02:49:28.600]   - I feel lucky that I enjoy exercise and always have,
[02:49:28.600 --> 02:49:31.520]   but if I didn't, I don't know what that would be.
[02:49:31.520 --> 02:49:32.360]   - Oh, how do you get yourself, yeah.
[02:49:32.360 --> 02:49:35.120]   I don't like exercise, that's exercise.
[02:49:35.120 --> 02:49:37.520]   I mean, I'm sorry, I was telling somebody this story
[02:49:37.520 --> 02:49:40.000]   actually just yesterday.
[02:49:40.000 --> 02:49:43.200]   So I was visiting friends many, many years ago
[02:49:43.200 --> 02:49:45.520]   in Vero Beach, and they said in the morning,
[02:49:45.520 --> 02:49:46.900]   "Let's go to Captain Jack's."
[02:49:46.900 --> 02:49:49.080]   I'm thinking, Captain Jack's is going to be breakfast,
[02:49:49.080 --> 02:49:51.200]   and I'm thinking, I'm going to have a big breakfast.
[02:49:51.200 --> 02:49:52.040]   Why not?
[02:49:52.040 --> 02:49:53.440]   I'm going to take a long walk to get there,
[02:49:53.440 --> 02:49:55.120]   and I'm very excited.
[02:49:55.120 --> 02:49:55.960]   So we get down to the beach,
[02:49:55.960 --> 02:49:57.520]   and we're walking to Captain Jack's,
[02:49:57.520 --> 02:50:00.800]   and then there's this stick in the sand
[02:50:00.800 --> 02:50:03.000]   that says on it, "Captain Jack's."
[02:50:03.000 --> 02:50:07.240]   All it is was the endpoint to our walk, you know?
[02:50:07.240 --> 02:50:12.160]   Well, for me, if I had known the walk was just for the walk,
[02:50:12.160 --> 02:50:15.280]   I probably would have enjoyed it much less.
[02:50:15.280 --> 02:50:18.720]   You know, that if I'm in Paris and shopping,
[02:50:18.720 --> 02:50:22.160]   or window shopping, I walk 10 miles a day
[02:50:22.160 --> 02:50:23.800]   and enjoy myself thoroughly.
[02:50:23.800 --> 02:50:27.000]   But if you said, "Let's go for a walk of even five miles,"
[02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:29.800]   and it's just to walk, now, this is mindless.
[02:50:29.800 --> 02:50:32.200]   I'm not suggesting this is a good thing.
[02:50:32.200 --> 02:50:36.940]   But, you know, activities that are meant to be fun
[02:50:36.940 --> 02:50:39.280]   and that are easy to engage and are fun
[02:50:41.840 --> 02:50:43.240]   will be good for you.
[02:50:43.240 --> 02:50:45.040]   And if you see it as exercise,
[02:50:45.040 --> 02:50:48.080]   if you're doing it for some other reason,
[02:50:48.080 --> 02:50:51.880]   it's a shame because even the exercise for exercise sake,
[02:50:51.880 --> 02:50:55.220]   I won't do it if it isn't fun.
[02:50:55.220 --> 02:50:57.720]   I don't know if that's a privileged position.
[02:50:57.720 --> 02:51:01.600]   But now, that's not that, you know,
[02:51:01.600 --> 02:51:03.440]   I say I won't do it if it isn't fun.
[02:51:03.440 --> 02:51:06.400]   I think that this is something that I do well
[02:51:06.400 --> 02:51:09.840]   is to make almost anything be fun.
[02:51:09.840 --> 02:51:10.920]   - Well, that's a great skill.
[02:51:10.920 --> 02:51:12.960]   I was talking to my mom last night
[02:51:12.960 --> 02:51:16.200]   and she was saying, "Not much is happening here."
[02:51:16.200 --> 02:51:18.680]   And I kept saying, "No, tell me, what are you guys up to?
[02:51:18.680 --> 02:51:19.500]   It'd been a while."
[02:51:19.500 --> 02:51:22.440]   And she said, "Well, I don't have this big exciting life."
[02:51:22.440 --> 02:51:24.800]   And I said, "What's going on?"
[02:51:24.800 --> 02:51:27.560]   And she said, "Okay, well, if you really wanna know,
[02:51:27.560 --> 02:51:30.880]   there's this new plant weed that's growing in the garden."
[02:51:30.880 --> 02:51:32.240]   And she started explaining to me
[02:51:32.240 --> 02:51:33.680]   this really interesting weed
[02:51:33.680 --> 02:51:35.020]   that has these little yellow flowers.
[02:51:35.020 --> 02:51:36.400]   And my mom loves gardening.
[02:51:36.400 --> 02:51:38.040]   And so she delights in gardening
[02:51:38.040 --> 02:51:39.560]   and I was delighting in her delight.
[02:51:39.560 --> 02:51:41.180]   And when she was done, I said-
[02:51:41.180 --> 02:51:42.020]   - Well, that's something.
[02:51:42.020 --> 02:51:42.840]   - That's actually the kind of thing
[02:51:42.840 --> 02:51:45.680]   I'd love to talk about, you know, and hear more about,
[02:51:45.680 --> 02:51:48.000]   because I also know my own experience.
[02:51:48.000 --> 02:51:49.400]   So I didn't need to talk about, like,
[02:51:49.400 --> 02:51:50.560]   what's going on on the podcast
[02:51:50.560 --> 02:51:52.320]   or what's going on in my daily life
[02:51:52.320 --> 02:51:54.480]   or the incredible breeds of dogs
[02:51:54.480 --> 02:51:56.880]   that I'm considering getting, maybe all of them,
[02:51:56.880 --> 02:52:00.440]   because I was interested in what was going on in her garden.
[02:52:00.440 --> 02:52:01.840]   And so what was trivial to her
[02:52:01.840 --> 02:52:02.960]   was actually interesting to me
[02:52:02.960 --> 02:52:05.880]   and it represented a really good bridge
[02:52:05.880 --> 02:52:07.360]   to a number of things.
[02:52:07.360 --> 02:52:11.280]   I have to say that we were talking earlier
[02:52:11.280 --> 02:52:15.480]   about how one frames past, present, and future.
[02:52:15.480 --> 02:52:17.640]   I don't know if we were talking about it in that way,
[02:52:17.640 --> 02:52:22.640]   but in thinking about age, longevity, and what's possible,
[02:52:22.640 --> 02:52:24.280]   the word that came to mind
[02:52:24.280 --> 02:52:27.280]   that I'd like to just pressure test a little bit
[02:52:27.280 --> 02:52:29.320]   is nostalgia.
[02:52:29.320 --> 02:52:31.720]   And I have this feeling, and I hope I'm wrong,
[02:52:31.720 --> 02:52:33.120]   'cause I've been wrong about most things today
[02:52:33.120 --> 02:52:35.020]   in a way that I've been learning from,
[02:52:36.240 --> 02:52:39.280]   that nostalgia can be, perhaps,
[02:52:39.280 --> 02:52:40.840]   kind of a dangerous line of thinking,
[02:52:40.840 --> 02:52:43.540]   this idea that things used to be great,
[02:52:43.540 --> 02:52:44.380]   but now they're not.
[02:52:44.380 --> 02:52:46.800]   - Why can't they be like we were?
[02:52:46.800 --> 02:52:47.640]   - And I thought to myself,
[02:52:47.640 --> 02:52:50.980]   what a terrible sense or emotion.
[02:52:50.980 --> 02:52:54.040]   And it led me to some practical questions,
[02:52:54.040 --> 02:52:56.200]   like, should we go to high school reunions?
[02:52:56.200 --> 02:52:58.800]   And I thought, well, no, if all we're gonna do
[02:52:58.800 --> 02:53:02.240]   is embrace nostalgia,
[02:53:02.240 --> 02:53:04.640]   yes, if it makes us feel like we're 19 again.
[02:53:04.640 --> 02:53:06.000]   - Yes, exactly.
[02:53:06.000 --> 02:53:06.840]   - This kind of thing.
[02:53:06.840 --> 02:53:09.240]   And here you can substitute reunions with,
[02:53:09.240 --> 02:53:11.120]   should I look at photo albums?
[02:53:11.120 --> 02:53:13.600]   Like, I don't know how I feel about photos from the past.
[02:53:13.600 --> 02:53:16.720]   I used to collect them and cherish them.
[02:53:16.720 --> 02:53:18.760]   And now, sometimes when I look at them,
[02:53:18.760 --> 02:53:20.820]   it just makes me long for something.
[02:53:20.820 --> 02:53:21.660]   And I'm trying,
[02:53:21.660 --> 02:53:23.160]   I think I need to learn how to pivot through that.
[02:53:23.160 --> 02:53:24.920]   So what are your thoughts on nostalgia
[02:53:24.920 --> 02:53:28.820]   and just notions of how we think about our past in general?
[02:53:28.820 --> 02:53:30.280]   - I don't think they're very different
[02:53:30.280 --> 02:53:32.400]   from what you've already covered.
[02:53:32.400 --> 02:53:35.120]   In that fire, I lost all the photos.
[02:53:35.120 --> 02:53:37.360]   And it didn't occur to me
[02:53:37.360 --> 02:53:39.660]   that I had lost all of them for years,
[02:53:39.660 --> 02:53:41.720]   because I didn't look at them.
[02:53:41.720 --> 02:53:44.120]   - Sorry, I couldn't help but laugh at a lot of that,
[02:53:44.120 --> 02:53:45.440]   so that's very true, yeah.
[02:53:45.440 --> 02:53:48.800]   - I think, you know, when I was young,
[02:53:48.800 --> 02:53:52.980]   some of my friends were keeping a diary.
[02:53:52.980 --> 02:53:56.120]   And I never kept a diary.
[02:53:56.120 --> 02:53:58.480]   And so then my feeling was,
[02:53:58.480 --> 02:54:02.080]   I'd rather just be living than recording.
[02:54:02.080 --> 02:54:04.860]   But it depends on how you record it.
[02:54:04.860 --> 02:54:07.440]   If you're reliving it while you're recording it,
[02:54:07.440 --> 02:54:09.520]   then you're living, it's the same thing.
[02:54:09.520 --> 02:54:12.600]   You know, one activity is really no better than another
[02:54:12.600 --> 02:54:14.240]   if you're doing it mindfully.
[02:54:14.240 --> 02:54:15.920]   Now, this is hard for people to accept.
[02:54:15.920 --> 02:54:20.040]   And if I say to you that if you're cleaning a toilet,
[02:54:20.040 --> 02:54:23.240]   that the distinctions you're drawing are no better or worse
[02:54:23.240 --> 02:54:25.920]   than if you're trying to come up
[02:54:25.920 --> 02:54:27.880]   with a theory of relativity,
[02:54:27.880 --> 02:54:31.000]   or understand Einstein's theory of relativity.
[02:54:31.000 --> 02:54:33.400]   A distinction is a distinction is a distinction.
[02:54:34.680 --> 02:54:39.000]   And so that's why these little things that you're noticing,
[02:54:39.000 --> 02:54:42.480]   your mother's weed, is no less important,
[02:54:42.480 --> 02:54:45.240]   although she thought you might see it as less important,
[02:54:45.240 --> 02:54:50.120]   than you're having just interviewed somebody
[02:54:50.120 --> 02:54:52.160]   that she thought was phenomenal.
[02:54:52.160 --> 02:54:55.080]   Once you notice, you notice,
[02:54:55.080 --> 02:54:56.160]   and that's the whole ballgame,
[02:54:56.160 --> 02:54:58.080]   and there's always something to notice.
[02:54:58.080 --> 02:55:02.940]   And if you're noticing it without the stress overlay
[02:55:02.940 --> 02:55:05.480]   that some people add to their lives,
[02:55:05.480 --> 02:55:06.880]   which I can't understand,
[02:55:06.880 --> 02:55:09.360]   it's no different from a game.
[02:55:09.360 --> 02:55:12.020]   You know, I use this example,
[02:55:12.020 --> 02:55:15.180]   and I think that my students must think I'm crazy.
[02:55:15.180 --> 02:55:18.220]   So if I believe that,
[02:55:18.220 --> 02:55:20.480]   I should come up with a different example.
[02:55:20.480 --> 02:55:23.920]   But you're flossing your teeth.
[02:55:23.920 --> 02:55:27.600]   Now, you can floss your teeth mindlessly,
[02:55:27.600 --> 02:55:29.680]   in which case you resent being there.
[02:55:29.680 --> 02:55:30.760]   You're spending the time
[02:55:30.760 --> 02:55:33.500]   because you're thinking that it's good for you,
[02:55:33.500 --> 02:55:35.960]   but you'd rather be doing something else.
[02:55:35.960 --> 02:55:40.040]   You're not there, you're flossing,
[02:55:40.040 --> 02:55:42.120]   but your mind is thinking about
[02:55:42.120 --> 02:55:45.960]   a party you're going to go to, for example.
[02:55:45.960 --> 02:55:49.600]   To me, make it fun, it's so easy.
[02:55:49.600 --> 02:55:51.240]   I mean, you play little games,
[02:55:51.240 --> 02:55:52.800]   like can I predict how much junk
[02:55:52.800 --> 02:55:54.360]   is going to come out as a, you know,
[02:55:54.360 --> 02:55:56.700]   and which teeth, which part, you know.
[02:55:56.700 --> 02:55:59.100]   Everything can be made into a game.
[02:56:00.420 --> 02:56:03.520]   I had this, you can maybe figure out
[02:56:03.520 --> 02:56:05.320]   how to bring this product to market,
[02:56:05.320 --> 02:56:09.120]   but it was called, I have so many of these,
[02:56:09.120 --> 02:56:10.320]   it's called WeGo,
[02:56:10.320 --> 02:56:13.200]   a way of training your child to use the toilet.
[02:56:13.200 --> 02:56:15.920]   And so it's not very hard.
[02:56:15.920 --> 02:56:18.240]   We'd sell, you could sell them,
[02:56:18.240 --> 02:56:20.040]   these little vials of chemicals
[02:56:20.040 --> 02:56:23.040]   that when you add it a few drops to urine,
[02:56:23.040 --> 02:56:24.440]   it changes color.
[02:56:24.440 --> 02:56:27.500]   But so each of these vials will change the color
[02:56:27.500 --> 02:56:28.340]   to a different color.
[02:56:28.340 --> 02:56:29.600]   - I think adults would buy that.
[02:56:29.600 --> 02:56:31.020]   - Yeah, and the kid is, you know,
[02:56:31.020 --> 02:56:34.600]   has to guess either to the parent or just for themselves,
[02:56:34.600 --> 02:56:36.920]   you know, is this going to be yellow, green, blue?
[02:56:36.920 --> 02:56:37.760]   You know what?
[02:56:37.760 --> 02:56:38.580]   It becomes fun.
[02:56:38.580 --> 02:56:43.640]   - Gamifying things is one of the great pleasures
[02:56:43.640 --> 02:56:44.480]   of parenting.
[02:56:44.480 --> 02:56:45.320]   - Yeah.
[02:56:45.320 --> 02:56:46.960]   - You know, and earlier you were talking about
[02:56:46.960 --> 02:56:50.840]   what do your grandkids call you?
[02:56:50.840 --> 02:56:51.840]   - Cosmic leader.
[02:56:51.840 --> 02:56:53.040]   - Cosmic leader.
[02:56:53.040 --> 02:56:57.040]   Like you can play these games with them that,
[02:56:57.040 --> 02:56:59.800]   and then they reach their adolescent and teen years
[02:56:59.800 --> 02:57:02.440]   and then they claim they don't like those games.
[02:57:02.440 --> 02:57:05.920]   But as a former child and then teen,
[02:57:05.920 --> 02:57:07.600]   now I delight in some of the games
[02:57:07.600 --> 02:57:10.020]   that my parents played with me when I was little
[02:57:10.020 --> 02:57:14.200]   because it brings me back to the notions of imagination.
[02:57:14.200 --> 02:57:19.200]   - Yeah, no, I think that one of the worst things
[02:57:19.200 --> 02:57:24.240]   that the world teaches us is that we have work
[02:57:24.240 --> 02:57:28.120]   and we have play, as if these are two distinct categories.
[02:57:28.120 --> 02:57:30.320]   In fact, I think if you were to ask somebody
[02:57:30.320 --> 02:57:34.200]   just one question to determine how mindful they are,
[02:57:34.200 --> 02:57:37.340]   it might be, how much do you need a vacation?
[02:57:37.340 --> 02:57:40.320]   - I mean, I've never taken one.
[02:57:40.320 --> 02:57:43.120]   - No, you know, but need and want are two different things.
[02:57:43.120 --> 02:57:44.680]   And if I really need a vacation,
[02:57:44.680 --> 02:57:49.280]   that means my working is being done mindlessly.
[02:57:49.280 --> 02:57:51.080]   And that's a shame.
[02:57:51.080 --> 02:57:53.560]   You know, if you can't find a way to do it
[02:57:53.560 --> 02:57:55.800]   so you enjoy it, go someplace else.
[02:57:55.800 --> 02:57:57.760]   It's not worth the price you're paying.
[02:57:57.760 --> 02:58:01.400]   - And for people that say, well, that's a luxury.
[02:58:01.400 --> 02:58:03.760]   I need to work in order to survive
[02:58:03.760 --> 02:58:05.920]   and feed my family, et cetera.
[02:58:05.920 --> 02:58:07.980]   How does one reconcile that?
[02:58:07.980 --> 02:58:09.880]   - Well, then learn how to make it fun.
[02:58:09.880 --> 02:58:14.480]   You know, that anything can be made fun.
[02:58:14.480 --> 02:58:15.920]   Just, you make it a game.
[02:58:15.920 --> 02:58:18.680]   You try to figure out, guess what's going to happen.
[02:58:18.680 --> 02:58:21.720]   See, can you do it differently from the last time?
[02:58:21.720 --> 02:58:23.960]   Can you do it with your eyes closed?
[02:58:23.960 --> 02:58:26.240]   I mean, you know, it's fun.
[02:58:26.240 --> 02:58:29.400]   You know, get down on, not related to your work,
[02:58:29.400 --> 02:58:31.200]   but you get down on all fours
[02:58:31.200 --> 02:58:33.940]   and see the world that your cat or your dog sees.
[02:58:33.940 --> 02:58:36.160]   You know, close the lights
[02:58:36.160 --> 02:58:38.360]   and see what it's like being blind.
[02:58:38.360 --> 02:58:41.680]   Trying to get through the day without hearing.
[02:58:41.680 --> 02:58:44.960]   I wanted to do this thing 50 years ago,
[02:58:44.960 --> 02:58:48.760]   which was to create a building
[02:58:48.760 --> 02:58:52.680]   that simulated old age.
[02:58:52.680 --> 02:58:55.200]   And so if you took the 50-year-old
[02:58:55.200 --> 02:58:59.120]   and they spent even a short time in that building
[02:58:59.120 --> 02:59:01.380]   where it's colder than usual
[02:59:01.380 --> 02:59:03.280]   because there's less oxygen in your blood,
[02:59:03.280 --> 02:59:05.720]   your field of vision narrows,
[02:59:05.720 --> 02:59:10.720]   that they would expand each of their abilities
[02:59:10.720 --> 02:59:11.920]   at a time that it's easy.
[02:59:11.920 --> 02:59:14.080]   But the problem with that was a 50-year-old
[02:59:14.080 --> 02:59:17.440]   doesn't want to imagine being 80 years old.
[02:59:17.440 --> 02:59:18.760]   - You've done some beautiful studies
[02:59:18.760 --> 02:59:20.720]   on healing and time perception.
[02:59:20.720 --> 02:59:22.600]   Could you just describe that experiment?
[02:59:22.600 --> 02:59:23.520]   I love this paper.
[02:59:23.520 --> 02:59:25.000]   I love this experiment so much.
[02:59:25.000 --> 02:59:28.360]   - Peter Unglund, I did this when I was a graduate student.
[02:59:28.360 --> 02:59:30.040]   We inflict a wound.
[02:59:30.040 --> 02:59:32.820]   Now, it would have been more dramatic
[02:59:32.820 --> 02:59:35.080]   if we could really cut you up,
[02:59:35.080 --> 02:59:36.640]   but we're not sadists.
[02:59:36.640 --> 02:59:38.000]   And even if we were,
[02:59:38.000 --> 02:59:40.200]   the review committees wouldn't let us do it.
[02:59:40.200 --> 02:59:43.280]   So it's a minor wound, but it's still a wound.
[02:59:43.280 --> 02:59:47.160]   And we have people individually sitting in front of a clock,
[02:59:47.160 --> 02:59:49.840]   unbeknownst to them, for a third of the people,
[02:59:49.840 --> 02:59:53.040]   the clock is going twice as fast as real time.
[02:59:53.040 --> 02:59:54.320]   For another third of the people,
[02:59:54.320 --> 02:59:56.560]   it's going half as fast as real time.
[02:59:56.560 --> 02:59:59.480]   And for the last third, it's going real time.
[02:59:59.480 --> 03:00:02.600]   And the question is, most people would assume
[03:00:02.600 --> 03:00:04.200]   that wound's gonna heal.
[03:00:04.200 --> 03:00:06.480]   How that wound heals has nothing to do
[03:00:06.480 --> 03:00:08.000]   with the perception of time.
[03:00:08.000 --> 03:00:12.300]   But it turns out that it healed based on clock time.
[03:00:12.300 --> 03:00:14.560]   Now, when you add that to some of the things
[03:00:14.560 --> 03:00:16.640]   that we've already said,
[03:00:16.640 --> 03:00:18.800]   you end up with a very different picture.
[03:00:18.800 --> 03:00:21.920]   You broke your arm and you asked the doctor,
[03:00:21.920 --> 03:00:23.980]   how long is it going to take to heal?
[03:00:23.980 --> 03:00:26.240]   How does he know or she know?
[03:00:26.240 --> 03:00:27.720]   I mean, it's a ridiculous question.
[03:00:27.720 --> 03:00:30.400]   Lots of people have broken arms.
[03:00:30.400 --> 03:00:34.540]   Even if this were somebody who studied broken arms
[03:00:34.540 --> 03:00:36.760]   and he stopped studying yesterday,
[03:00:36.760 --> 03:00:39.080]   today there are new people with broken arms
[03:00:39.080 --> 03:00:41.680]   that might have different rates of healing.
[03:00:41.680 --> 03:00:43.400]   But people give an answer.
[03:00:43.400 --> 03:00:45.800]   And depending on the way the doctor gives that answer,
[03:00:45.800 --> 03:00:47.040]   I think is important.
[03:00:47.040 --> 03:00:48.720]   If the doctor says it's gonna take you,
[03:00:48.720 --> 03:00:50.720]   and I'm making this, I don't know how long it'll take,
[03:00:50.720 --> 03:00:52.440]   it's gonna take you a month.
[03:00:52.440 --> 03:00:54.760]   You organize yourself in such a way
[03:00:54.760 --> 03:00:56.880]   that it's going to take a month.
[03:00:56.880 --> 03:00:59.240]   But I think if the doctor instead,
[03:00:59.240 --> 03:01:00.840]   which is what I would recommend,
[03:01:00.840 --> 03:01:02.800]   said, we really don't know.
[03:01:02.800 --> 03:01:05.080]   Some people heal faster than others.
[03:01:05.080 --> 03:01:08.980]   The fastest healing time that I personally know of is,
[03:01:08.980 --> 03:01:10.480]   you know, let's say two weeks.
[03:01:10.480 --> 03:01:14.240]   You know, and if you can heal faster than that,
[03:01:14.240 --> 03:01:18.720]   then good for you, and if not, you know, it's fine also.
[03:01:18.720 --> 03:01:20.840]   Because there are advantages to not healing
[03:01:20.840 --> 03:01:22.560]   that people don't realize.
[03:01:22.560 --> 03:01:25.600]   You know, if you've broken your right arm
[03:01:25.600 --> 03:01:27.320]   and it's taking a long time to heal,
[03:01:27.320 --> 03:01:29.520]   that means you're using your left arm.
[03:01:29.520 --> 03:01:31.160]   And if you're using your left arm,
[03:01:31.160 --> 03:01:34.500]   you're exercising the right side of your brain,
[03:01:34.500 --> 03:01:38.220]   which is going to be good for many tasks.
[03:01:38.220 --> 03:01:42.800]   I don't know how we ended up right-handed or left-handed.
[03:01:42.800 --> 03:01:44.040]   Are you ambidextrous?
[03:01:44.040 --> 03:01:45.100]   I'm right-handed.
[03:01:45.100 --> 03:01:50.520]   I'll occasionally go into hook righty, but I'm a righty.
[03:01:50.520 --> 03:01:52.240]   My dad was naturally left-handed.
[03:01:52.240 --> 03:01:53.560]   They forced him to be right-handed.
[03:01:53.560 --> 03:01:56.120]   Oh, interesting, 'cause I'm sort of ambidextrous,
[03:01:56.120 --> 03:01:57.220]   mostly right-handed.
[03:01:57.220 --> 03:02:00.360]   But people don't realize that if you're using
[03:02:00.360 --> 03:02:03.200]   your right hand, it's controlled by the left part
[03:02:03.200 --> 03:02:06.120]   of your brain, your left hand, the right part of your brain.
[03:02:06.120 --> 03:02:09.640]   And wouldn't it be nice to exercise both parts of our brain?
[03:02:09.640 --> 03:02:12.800]   And so we're doing research where we get people.
[03:02:12.800 --> 03:02:16.520]   This is really interesting, because it's not just using.
[03:02:16.520 --> 03:02:19.600]   So this work was begun, gosh, I can't tell you
[03:02:19.600 --> 03:02:21.760]   how many years ago, and for one reason or another,
[03:02:21.760 --> 03:02:23.140]   never got finished.
[03:02:23.140 --> 03:02:25.320]   Initially, it was just getting people
[03:02:25.320 --> 03:02:28.220]   to use their right or the left hand.
[03:02:28.220 --> 03:02:32.880]   Now it's more sophisticated, where it's using your left hand
[03:02:32.880 --> 03:02:35.800]   with an awareness that you're using it or not.
[03:02:35.800 --> 03:02:39.920]   And I think that the effect on the brain
[03:02:39.920 --> 03:02:43.360]   will only obtain if you're aware.
[03:02:43.360 --> 03:02:45.040]   - Oh, this fits so beautifully.
[03:02:45.040 --> 03:02:47.720]   I don't wanna spend too much time on this,
[03:02:47.720 --> 03:02:49.240]   and you're probably aware of these experiments,
[03:02:49.240 --> 03:02:50.960]   but just for sake of our listeners,
[03:02:50.960 --> 03:02:55.120]   you probably know that your colleagues at Harvard,
[03:02:55.120 --> 03:02:57.680]   David Huel and Torsten Wiesel, won the Nobel Prize
[03:02:57.680 --> 03:03:01.080]   for brain plasticity, critical periods of vision, et cetera.
[03:03:01.080 --> 03:03:02.760]   And they had this sort of doctrine
[03:03:02.760 --> 03:03:07.040]   that they stated in the '80s, and it lasted until the,
[03:03:07.040 --> 03:03:09.240]   gosh, until the early and mid-2000s,
[03:03:09.240 --> 03:03:13.040]   that there was no significant brain plasticity
[03:03:13.040 --> 03:03:15.880]   in adult humans, that it literally shut down.
[03:03:15.880 --> 03:03:18.640]   Mike Merzenich and a guy named Greg Reckinzone at UCSF
[03:03:18.640 --> 03:03:19.840]   did these beautiful studies.
[03:03:19.840 --> 03:03:22.120]   I'll try and describe this really quickly,
[03:03:22.120 --> 03:03:25.080]   where they would have their subjects pay attention
[03:03:25.080 --> 03:03:29.640]   to little bumps on a rotating drum
[03:03:29.640 --> 03:03:32.000]   of different coarseness or fineness.
[03:03:32.000 --> 03:03:34.200]   And then there was a tone playing in the room.
[03:03:34.200 --> 03:03:36.560]   And if they were told to discriminate
[03:03:36.560 --> 03:03:39.520]   when the bumps were changed from coarse
[03:03:39.520 --> 03:03:41.920]   to just slightly less coarse or more coarse,
[03:03:41.920 --> 03:03:45.200]   the subject would signal, "Okay, that happened."
[03:03:45.200 --> 03:03:46.280]   And then over time,
[03:03:46.280 --> 03:03:50.240]   the area of the brain responsible for touch in adults
[03:03:50.240 --> 03:03:52.400]   expanded the map of that.
[03:03:52.400 --> 03:03:55.360]   So adult plasticity was very interesting, however,
[03:03:55.360 --> 03:03:58.000]   is if they did the exact same thing,
[03:03:58.000 --> 03:04:00.320]   but they were told to attend to slight changes
[03:04:00.320 --> 03:04:02.120]   in the frequency of the tone,
[03:04:02.120 --> 03:04:04.640]   it didn't matter what they were doing with their fingers.
[03:04:04.640 --> 03:04:06.280]   The auditory cortex changed
[03:04:06.280 --> 03:04:09.080]   and the somatosensory, the touch map, didn't.
[03:04:09.080 --> 03:04:10.520]   And so it's proof positive
[03:04:10.520 --> 03:04:12.480]   that it's not just a behavior in adulthood,
[03:04:12.480 --> 03:04:14.760]   but the combination of behavior and awareness
[03:04:14.760 --> 03:04:19.600]   of the shift in perception that drives adult plasticity.
[03:04:19.600 --> 03:04:21.240]   And I find those studies to be,
[03:04:21.240 --> 03:04:24.200]   well, first of all, they aren't discussed enough,
[03:04:24.200 --> 03:04:25.880]   that that feature isn't discussed enough.
[03:04:25.880 --> 03:04:27.800]   And second of all, it basically says
[03:04:27.800 --> 03:04:31.880]   that awareness is the gate to brain change.
[03:04:31.880 --> 03:04:33.400]   And I think that fits perfectly
[03:04:33.400 --> 03:04:35.880]   with everything that you've been talking about.
[03:04:35.880 --> 03:04:38.360]   I don't see how it could be otherwise actually.
[03:04:38.360 --> 03:04:41.520]   But to go back to the doctor telling you
[03:04:41.520 --> 03:04:43.160]   how long it's going to heal,
[03:04:43.160 --> 03:04:45.820]   it tends to be now a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[03:04:45.820 --> 03:04:49.240]   So given that doctors have this influence over us,
[03:04:49.240 --> 03:04:51.180]   they need to be more responsible
[03:04:51.180 --> 03:04:53.240]   in the information they're given.
[03:04:53.240 --> 03:04:56.440]   And we can't know how long it's going to take to heal.
[03:04:56.440 --> 03:05:00.220]   People today are different from people 20 years ago.
[03:05:00.220 --> 03:05:01.360]   They ate different things.
[03:05:01.360 --> 03:05:02.640]   The activities were different.
[03:05:02.640 --> 03:05:04.920]   The air was different and so on.
[03:05:04.920 --> 03:05:07.880]   And so from where are these norms derived?
[03:05:07.880 --> 03:05:09.840]   In fact, whenever I speak to anybody,
[03:05:09.840 --> 03:05:11.400]   I get lots of calls from people
[03:05:11.400 --> 03:05:13.800]   who are given these dread diagnoses.
[03:05:13.800 --> 03:05:17.280]   And the first thing I tell them is,
[03:05:17.280 --> 03:05:20.640]   it takes so long to do these studies.
[03:05:20.640 --> 03:05:24.600]   And then it takes forever to analyze the data.
[03:05:24.600 --> 03:05:27.440]   And then it takes another forever to publish it.
[03:05:27.440 --> 03:05:30.320]   And then eventually when you're going to hear about it,
[03:05:30.320 --> 03:05:32.180]   it's already old news.
[03:05:32.180 --> 03:05:36.240]   So the information you're reading now
[03:05:36.240 --> 03:05:40.680]   was true for people who lived 10 years ago.
[03:05:40.680 --> 03:05:42.080]   10 years is a lot.
[03:05:42.080 --> 03:05:44.200]   There's a lot of things happening.
[03:05:44.200 --> 03:05:48.080]   And always with the intention of getting people
[03:05:48.080 --> 03:05:53.080]   to be less absolute in their understanding of any of this,
[03:05:53.080 --> 03:05:56.840]   so that they can imagine all sorts of possibilities.
[03:05:56.840 --> 03:06:00.040]   But even the thing that I just said a moment before,
[03:06:00.040 --> 03:06:03.520]   that it's important for people to realize
[03:06:03.520 --> 03:06:07.360]   the advantage in using their left hand
[03:06:07.360 --> 03:06:08.320]   if they're right-handed,
[03:06:08.320 --> 03:06:10.600]   or their right hand if they're left-handed.
[03:06:10.600 --> 03:06:12.600]   And then at the same time,
[03:06:12.600 --> 03:06:17.400]   recognizing that when they break a leg,
[03:06:17.400 --> 03:06:19.560]   when somebody breaks a leg,
[03:06:19.560 --> 03:06:23.420]   that forces you to do everything differently.
[03:06:23.420 --> 03:06:26.460]   And if you attend to that, that can be a wonderful thing.
[03:06:27.440 --> 03:06:30.480]   I don't know how I got to see these things.
[03:06:30.480 --> 03:06:32.000]   It's very strange to me when I think
[03:06:32.000 --> 03:06:33.840]   of what things have influenced me.
[03:06:33.840 --> 03:06:36.640]   I don't know how old I was, Andrea,
[03:06:36.640 --> 03:06:39.040]   but I'm watching this thing on television,
[03:06:39.040 --> 03:06:42.040]   and there's this woman who has no arms,
[03:06:42.040 --> 03:06:44.440]   who's got a knife between her toes,
[03:06:44.440 --> 03:06:46.280]   who's slicing a tomato.
[03:06:46.280 --> 03:06:50.520]   And it's a lot of years.
[03:06:50.520 --> 03:06:52.480]   I've seen and done a lot of things,
[03:06:52.480 --> 03:06:54.560]   but for me to remember that.
[03:06:54.560 --> 03:06:59.040]   And that even when we're taught to do something,
[03:06:59.040 --> 03:07:01.040]   we're taught a single way.
[03:07:01.040 --> 03:07:04.380]   It's so much more fun to be taught multiple ways.
[03:07:04.380 --> 03:07:06.480]   I mean, when I hurt my right arm,
[03:07:06.480 --> 03:07:08.280]   I'm playing tennis poorly,
[03:07:08.280 --> 03:07:11.020]   but I'm still playing with my left hand.
[03:07:11.020 --> 03:07:14.400]   - We have such a deficit model of life.
[03:07:14.400 --> 03:07:15.240]   - Yes, yes.
[03:07:15.240 --> 03:07:17.200]   - And this also fits with the Kahneman stuff, right?
[03:07:17.200 --> 03:07:19.600]   That people work much harder to avoid a loss
[03:07:19.600 --> 03:07:21.180]   than they will for a gain.
[03:07:21.180 --> 03:07:22.720]   And it seems to be--
[03:07:22.720 --> 03:07:24.160]   - Well, see, now that's interesting,
[03:07:24.160 --> 03:07:27.000]   because when I go to teach that,
[03:07:27.000 --> 03:07:30.120]   I have so much trouble keeping track of what's the loss
[03:07:30.120 --> 03:07:31.160]   and what's the gain,
[03:07:31.160 --> 03:07:33.320]   because I don't see the world that way.
[03:07:33.320 --> 03:07:36.520]   - You've transcended the typical notion of loss.
[03:07:36.520 --> 03:07:38.240]   - Whether I've transcended or not,
[03:07:38.240 --> 03:07:40.320]   I just think differently.
[03:07:40.320 --> 03:07:42.280]   But everybody accepts that.
[03:07:42.280 --> 03:07:45.920]   And to see the gain in the so-called loss,
[03:07:45.920 --> 03:07:47.960]   or the loss in the so-called gain,
[03:07:50.300 --> 03:07:52.620]   you just end up with a very different world.
[03:07:52.620 --> 03:07:56.540]   - Well, I'm not as involved in that aspect,
[03:07:56.540 --> 03:07:58.440]   certainly others as well as you are,
[03:07:58.440 --> 03:08:00.580]   but when I started my lab,
[03:08:00.580 --> 03:08:03.020]   I used to teach my students something,
[03:08:03.020 --> 03:08:05.380]   which was, okay, we're gonna get a lot more rejections
[03:08:05.380 --> 03:08:06.740]   and have to do a lot more revisions
[03:08:06.740 --> 03:08:10.240]   than we are going to get acceptances on papers and grants.
[03:08:10.240 --> 03:08:11.660]   So the best thing that you can do,
[03:08:11.660 --> 03:08:13.340]   which is what I had to do for myself,
[03:08:13.340 --> 03:08:14.940]   one of the best things you might consider
[03:08:14.940 --> 03:08:16.580]   would have been a gentler way to say it,
[03:08:16.580 --> 03:08:18.060]   but I say one of the best things you can do,
[03:08:18.060 --> 03:08:19.380]   'cause that's the way I talk sometimes,
[03:08:19.380 --> 03:08:24.380]   is to create a long arc of positive feedback loops
[03:08:24.380 --> 03:08:30.580]   when something good happens,
[03:08:30.580 --> 03:08:32.760]   but that when something negative happens,
[03:08:32.760 --> 03:08:36.000]   let yourself feel it acutely and then move on fast.
[03:08:36.000 --> 03:08:37.260]   And like, so if I were to plot this,
[03:08:37.260 --> 03:08:39.700]   it would basically be like an accepted paper
[03:08:39.700 --> 03:08:41.580]   will delight me and motivate me
[03:08:41.580 --> 03:08:43.780]   for many, many months, if not years,
[03:08:43.780 --> 03:08:46.660]   but a rejection or a tough revision,
[03:08:46.660 --> 03:08:49.780]   where we're looking at another year or two of experiments,
[03:08:49.780 --> 03:08:52.060]   I'd allow myself maybe a day and a half
[03:08:52.060 --> 03:08:55.860]   of just being utterly crushed and then right back to it.
[03:08:55.860 --> 03:08:57.180]   - Yeah, but another way,
[03:08:57.180 --> 03:08:59.700]   when I say put people back in the equation,
[03:08:59.700 --> 03:09:01.700]   that's what you need to teach them,
[03:09:01.700 --> 03:09:04.380]   which is the responses you're getting,
[03:09:04.380 --> 03:09:08.260]   these reviews are not from a bunch of sages in the sky.
[03:09:08.260 --> 03:09:09.740]   - Certainly not, certainly not.
[03:09:09.740 --> 03:09:11.380]   - They're just a group of people,
[03:09:11.380 --> 03:09:14.400]   a group of people with different biases and so on.
[03:09:15.300 --> 03:09:19.500]   And it doesn't mean you were wrong.
[03:09:19.500 --> 03:09:20.340]   - Yeah, and reviews,
[03:09:20.340 --> 03:09:23.260]   and I learned from my postdoc advisor, and I love this,
[03:09:23.260 --> 03:09:27.480]   is he used to say, "Reviews always make papers better."
[03:09:27.480 --> 03:09:29.540]   Even if you hate them, they always make papers better,
[03:09:29.540 --> 03:09:30.620]   they never make papers worse.
[03:09:30.620 --> 03:09:32.880]   Sometimes they make papers a little bit harder to track
[03:09:32.880 --> 03:09:34.580]   because like there's this weird figure put in
[03:09:34.580 --> 03:09:37.140]   just to satisfy a reviewer, kind of like, what is this?
[03:09:37.140 --> 03:09:38.980]   But everyone eventually realized
[03:09:38.980 --> 03:09:41.580]   what that figure is about anyway.
[03:09:41.580 --> 03:09:45.540]   And so I adopted the idea that reviews, red ink,
[03:09:45.540 --> 03:09:48.480]   critical feedback are just ways of getting better,
[03:09:48.480 --> 03:09:50.620]   which has also been essential in the podcasting sphere,
[03:09:50.620 --> 03:09:52.640]   'cause if I've ever gotten anything wrong,
[03:09:52.640 --> 03:09:54.220]   believe me, I hear about it in the comments,
[03:09:54.220 --> 03:09:55.540]   and sometimes it can be embarrassing,
[03:09:55.540 --> 03:09:57.480]   but you just look at it as an opportunity
[03:09:57.480 --> 03:10:00.020]   to address your humanness and move forward,
[03:10:00.020 --> 03:10:01.320]   correct it and move forward.
[03:10:01.320 --> 03:10:03.860]   But I think a lot of people try and maintain
[03:10:03.860 --> 03:10:05.220]   this air of perfection,
[03:10:05.220 --> 03:10:07.320]   like there's some sort of Fabergé egg,
[03:10:07.320 --> 03:10:09.420]   that instead of living life like a work of art
[03:10:09.420 --> 03:10:13.420]   where it has dimples and cracks and acne and all the rest,
[03:10:13.420 --> 03:10:14.440]   and it's human,
[03:10:14.440 --> 03:10:17.900]   I think a lot of people want to present themselves
[03:10:17.900 --> 03:10:19.580]   to the world like a Fabergé egg,
[03:10:19.580 --> 03:10:21.420]   like that's just absolutely flawless.
[03:10:21.420 --> 03:10:24.120]   - But the problem with that is going out the next day.
[03:10:24.120 --> 03:10:27.860]   You can be that Fabergé egg on day one,
[03:10:27.860 --> 03:10:29.640]   but now you've got to maintain that.
[03:10:29.640 --> 03:10:32.260]   I mean, the first paper that I published
[03:10:32.260 --> 03:10:36.260]   came back without a comment, without a comment,
[03:10:36.260 --> 03:10:38.380]   not a correction, not a typo.
[03:10:38.380 --> 03:10:39.620]   - What a dangerous thing to have.
[03:10:39.620 --> 03:10:40.740]   - Exactly, it was awful.
[03:10:40.740 --> 03:10:42.380]   - Yeah, that was not my experience.
[03:10:42.380 --> 03:10:45.180]   - Well, it set me up for expectations.
[03:10:45.180 --> 03:10:47.540]   What do you mean when you, for the next one?
[03:10:47.540 --> 03:10:51.620]   But I think also that it's,
[03:10:51.620 --> 03:10:56.620]   once you recognize that this is an opinion
[03:10:56.620 --> 03:10:59.180]   rather than a statement of fact,
[03:10:59.180 --> 03:11:01.860]   and then when you,
[03:11:01.860 --> 03:11:05.700]   what I tell my students is that when you get a comment,
[03:11:05.700 --> 03:11:09.220]   it doesn't mean that the comment is right.
[03:11:09.220 --> 03:11:13.340]   It means that whatever you wrote wasn't appreciated
[03:11:13.340 --> 03:11:15.540]   in the way you wanted it to be appreciated.
[03:11:15.540 --> 03:11:17.300]   And they're guessing at,
[03:11:17.300 --> 03:11:19.740]   well, if you did it this way rather than that way.
[03:11:19.740 --> 03:11:23.180]   Papers that are not accepted today
[03:11:23.180 --> 03:11:25.980]   may be accepted tomorrow, the same paper.
[03:11:25.980 --> 03:11:30.060]   I mean, I can't tell you how many times people say can't be,
[03:11:30.060 --> 03:11:32.220]   and then it becomes the standard.
[03:11:33.980 --> 03:11:36.540]   - You mean in terms of a field and what's acceptable?
[03:11:36.540 --> 03:11:37.940]   - Yeah.
[03:11:37.940 --> 03:11:39.380]   - Yeah, things have certainly changed.
[03:11:39.380 --> 03:11:40.940]   And look, you've done a tremendous amount
[03:11:40.940 --> 03:11:42.220]   to pioneer that change.
[03:11:42.220 --> 03:11:45.980]   I mean, it's not one study or 10 study or 20 studies.
[03:11:45.980 --> 03:11:47.360]   I mean, there's now a catalog
[03:11:47.360 --> 03:11:49.660]   of incredibly groundbreaking work that you've,
[03:11:49.660 --> 03:11:52.540]   I don't know if you used intentionally
[03:11:52.540 --> 03:11:54.180]   or you're just following your interests,
[03:11:54.180 --> 03:11:56.580]   but that have transformed the way that we think about
[03:11:56.580 --> 03:12:00.140]   the mind and its role in our physiology and so on.
[03:12:00.140 --> 03:12:03.060]   I was hoping to get your reflections on something
[03:12:03.060 --> 03:12:05.940]   that I sometimes say that's probably wrong,
[03:12:05.940 --> 03:12:07.660]   but that is helpful to me because,
[03:12:07.660 --> 03:12:09.620]   and hopefully to other people too,
[03:12:09.620 --> 03:12:11.060]   because it, I think,
[03:12:11.060 --> 03:12:13.300]   captures some of the circuit dynamics
[03:12:13.300 --> 03:12:15.060]   related to reward and reinforcement.
[03:12:15.060 --> 03:12:17.740]   And it sometimes resurfaces on the internet
[03:12:17.740 --> 03:12:20.460]   that addiction, among other things,
[03:12:20.460 --> 03:12:22.340]   is a progressive narrowing of the things
[03:12:22.340 --> 03:12:24.460]   that bring someone pleasure.
[03:12:24.460 --> 03:12:26.780]   And I used to attach to that statement,
[03:12:26.780 --> 03:12:29.220]   enlightenment, if there is such a thing,
[03:12:29.220 --> 03:12:31.180]   is a progressive broadening of the things
[03:12:31.180 --> 03:12:32.140]   that bring us pleasure.
[03:12:32.140 --> 03:12:35.340]   And one thing that struck me throughout today's conversation
[03:12:35.340 --> 03:12:38.580]   is that it seems like you're able to look at
[03:12:38.580 --> 03:12:42.280]   pretty much anything through a bunch of different facets,
[03:12:42.280 --> 03:12:44.100]   take on other points of view,
[03:12:44.100 --> 03:12:46.220]   so strong theory of mind,
[03:12:46.220 --> 03:12:49.420]   while holding onto your own perceptions, right?
[03:12:49.420 --> 03:12:51.980]   Right, you're not drifting off from yourself,
[03:12:51.980 --> 03:12:55.660]   you're remaining, you know, of self,
[03:12:55.660 --> 03:12:57.780]   but taking on other perspectives
[03:12:57.780 --> 03:13:01.940]   and that flexibility of thinking and that expansiveness,
[03:13:01.940 --> 03:13:03.580]   like looking at things as good, bad,
[03:13:03.580 --> 03:13:05.900]   maybe, I don't know, I don't know what's true
[03:13:05.900 --> 03:13:06.740]   or what could be true
[03:13:06.740 --> 03:13:08.940]   and really challenging preconceived notions,
[03:13:08.940 --> 03:13:12.380]   seems very powerful.
[03:13:12.380 --> 03:13:13.820]   Do you believe in enlightenment?
[03:13:13.820 --> 03:13:15.580]   And was the description I just gave
[03:13:15.580 --> 03:13:18.100]   anything like the way you envisioned it?
[03:13:18.100 --> 03:13:19.340]   - No, I'm very flattered.
[03:13:19.340 --> 03:13:23.500]   You know, I think that when you're walking around
[03:13:23.500 --> 03:13:25.620]   and you don't see and all of a sudden you see,
[03:13:25.620 --> 03:13:27.420]   you can say that you're enlightened.
[03:13:30.260 --> 03:13:35.260]   I guess in a not so grandiose way
[03:13:35.260 --> 03:13:41.620]   that that simple thing that I keep saying,
[03:13:41.620 --> 03:13:44.820]   recognizing that behavior makes sense,
[03:13:44.820 --> 03:13:47.860]   leads you to such a different view of people.
[03:13:47.860 --> 03:13:50.140]   You don't have people who are good and bad,
[03:13:50.140 --> 03:13:52.500]   people who are addicted and not addicted.
[03:13:52.500 --> 03:13:58.300]   You don't have A students and failing students,
[03:13:58.300 --> 03:14:01.340]   everything just organizes itself differently
[03:14:01.340 --> 03:14:04.960]   and you come to appreciate the individual talents
[03:14:04.960 --> 03:14:06.260]   that people have.
[03:14:06.260 --> 03:14:10.360]   And when you can do that,
[03:14:10.360 --> 03:14:12.660]   I don't know if you wanna call the person enlightened,
[03:14:12.660 --> 03:14:17.660]   but life just is easier and nicer.
[03:14:17.660 --> 03:14:22.600]   You know, it's nicer to walk outside
[03:14:22.600 --> 03:14:24.180]   and be trusting of people
[03:14:24.180 --> 03:14:28.420]   and not to be afraid of this bastard
[03:14:28.420 --> 03:14:30.540]   or that one who's going to come and get you.
[03:14:30.540 --> 03:14:32.860]   I mean, I went to, with a friend,
[03:14:32.860 --> 03:14:34.580]   this was so many years ago,
[03:14:34.580 --> 03:14:37.660]   to an AA meeting to see what it was like.
[03:14:37.660 --> 03:14:41.340]   And I had left my pocketbook over here,
[03:14:41.340 --> 03:14:43.340]   wherever that is, which you can see.
[03:14:43.340 --> 03:14:47.380]   And we walked over here for whatever reason.
[03:14:47.380 --> 03:14:50.420]   And I said, "I left my pocketbook over there."
[03:14:50.420 --> 03:14:53.640]   And then I thought, you know, so what?
[03:14:53.640 --> 03:14:54.780]   If somebody takes it,
[03:14:54.780 --> 03:14:57.100]   they probably need it more than I do.
[03:14:57.100 --> 03:14:58.740]   And it was so freeing.
[03:14:58.740 --> 03:15:03.100]   You know, just not to care about all these things
[03:15:03.100 --> 03:15:05.060]   that somehow we're implicitly,
[03:15:05.060 --> 03:15:08.060]   sometimes explicitly taught to care about
[03:15:08.060 --> 03:15:10.560]   and always evaluating ourselves.
[03:15:10.560 --> 03:15:14.500]   You know, that little song,
[03:15:14.500 --> 03:15:16.620]   feeling that let me sing.
[03:15:16.620 --> 03:15:17.580]   I enjoy singing.
[03:15:17.580 --> 03:15:19.840]   I can't carry a tune, so what?
[03:15:20.840 --> 03:15:24.840]   Why should somebody make me feel bad about singing?
[03:15:24.840 --> 03:15:27.180]   And maybe I'll become a better singer.
[03:15:27.180 --> 03:15:30.320]   Or maybe I'll sing in some way that'll teach somebody,
[03:15:30.320 --> 03:15:31.600]   you know, some new trick
[03:15:31.600 --> 03:15:33.840]   that they hadn't thought about before
[03:15:33.840 --> 03:15:36.680]   because of my inadequacy.
[03:15:36.680 --> 03:15:41.320]   Why are people evaluating themselves at every moment
[03:15:41.320 --> 03:15:43.860]   rather than feeling good about the things
[03:15:43.860 --> 03:15:44.960]   they know that they can do?
[03:15:44.960 --> 03:15:49.080]   And who decides what's important to be able to do?
[03:15:49.080 --> 03:15:52.820]   I don't know how to most articulately share it,
[03:15:52.820 --> 03:15:55.740]   but it's just a very different life.
[03:15:55.740 --> 03:15:58.220]   You know, a life where you don't,
[03:15:58.220 --> 03:16:02.160]   I just don't believe that stress is necessary.
[03:16:02.160 --> 03:16:05.740]   I don't believe that there's anybody in this world
[03:16:05.740 --> 03:16:07.500]   that's better than I am.
[03:16:07.500 --> 03:16:10.900]   But I also don't believe I'm better than anybody else.
[03:16:10.900 --> 03:16:12.300]   It's very different.
[03:16:12.300 --> 03:16:14.820]   Where everything, especially among, you know,
[03:16:14.820 --> 03:16:16.740]   those of us who are academics,
[03:16:16.740 --> 03:16:18.900]   where every minute you're given a grade,
[03:16:18.900 --> 03:16:22.000]   and even, you know, the number of papers you got accepted,
[03:16:22.000 --> 03:16:25.200]   you know, determines your pecking order and so on.
[03:16:25.200 --> 03:16:27.440]   It's all so silly, you know,
[03:16:27.440 --> 03:16:29.520]   and then you have the money people,
[03:16:29.520 --> 03:16:32.120]   and I have $20 billion, you know,
[03:16:32.120 --> 03:16:34.120]   so I'm better off than people.
[03:16:34.120 --> 03:16:36.620]   I'm a better person than people have $10 billion.
[03:16:36.620 --> 03:16:40.480]   It's sad to me when, in fact,
[03:16:40.480 --> 03:16:43.240]   I think all of it is engaged
[03:16:43.240 --> 03:16:45.840]   in order to feel good about yourself.
[03:16:45.840 --> 03:16:46.960]   That's all.
[03:16:46.960 --> 03:16:48.480]   You know, why do I need that money?
[03:16:48.480 --> 03:16:50.120]   Why do I need those A's?
[03:16:50.120 --> 03:16:52.160]   Why do I need those successes?
[03:16:52.160 --> 03:16:55.000]   So that I'll like myself.
[03:16:55.000 --> 03:16:56.600]   Just like yourself.
[03:16:56.600 --> 03:16:59.020]   Recognize that you're likable.
[03:16:59.020 --> 03:16:59.860]   Why not?
[03:16:59.860 --> 03:17:03.080]   That may seem simple-minded,
[03:17:03.080 --> 03:17:06.440]   but it's gotten me to wherever I am.
[03:17:06.440 --> 03:17:07.380]   - It has indeed,
[03:17:07.380 --> 03:17:09.960]   and it's helped a tremendous number of people,
[03:17:09.960 --> 03:17:13.000]   both in the form of scientific findings,
[03:17:13.000 --> 03:17:17.440]   which are then shared with people through books
[03:17:17.440 --> 03:17:19.160]   and through podcasts,
[03:17:19.160 --> 03:17:21.840]   and I'm just so grateful that you came here today
[03:17:21.840 --> 03:17:23.080]   to share with us.
[03:17:23.080 --> 03:17:26.120]   This is really, as vast as it's been,
[03:17:26.120 --> 03:17:31.000]   you know, just a subset of the discoveries that you've made.
[03:17:31.000 --> 03:17:33.560]   So, you know, a couple of things.
[03:17:33.560 --> 03:17:36.640]   First of all, thank you for coming here today.
[03:17:36.640 --> 03:17:37.600]   - It's been my pleasure.
[03:17:37.600 --> 03:17:39.560]   - I've thoroughly enjoyed this,
[03:17:39.560 --> 03:17:41.720]   and I love, love, love your work,
[03:17:41.720 --> 03:17:44.840]   and it's caused me to think differently about things,
[03:17:44.840 --> 03:17:46.600]   and today's discussion is going to make me,
[03:17:46.600 --> 03:17:47.880]   and I know so many other people,
[03:17:47.880 --> 03:17:50.160]   think differently about everything.
[03:17:50.160 --> 03:17:52.760]   I mean, very few discussions that I'll hold
[03:17:52.760 --> 03:17:57.280]   will make me rethink my thinking about everything.
[03:17:57.280 --> 03:17:58.540]   This one certainly will.
[03:17:58.540 --> 03:18:03.040]   And also for continuing to do the work that you're doing.
[03:18:03.040 --> 03:18:05.760]   I mean, it's clear that you embody
[03:18:05.760 --> 03:18:08.360]   and live the discoveries that you make,
[03:18:08.360 --> 03:18:11.200]   and it's not just an academic pursuit
[03:18:11.200 --> 03:18:12.040]   that then, you know,
[03:18:12.040 --> 03:18:14.120]   allows you to collect all the,
[03:18:14.120 --> 03:18:18.280]   appropriately collect all the amazing awards and titles,
[03:18:18.280 --> 03:18:20.800]   but that it really serves and that you live it.
[03:18:20.800 --> 03:18:22.640]   So thank you for that as well.
[03:18:22.640 --> 03:18:25.960]   And then two more questions, very briefly.
[03:18:25.960 --> 03:18:27.680]   The first one is, would you--
[03:18:27.680 --> 03:18:29.560]   - It doesn't matter how long the question is,
[03:18:29.560 --> 03:18:31.080]   it's the answer that matters, right?
[03:18:31.080 --> 03:18:33.240]   So you asked me the brief question for a long answer.
[03:18:33.240 --> 03:18:34.120]   - The floor is yours,
[03:18:34.120 --> 03:18:37.360]   but would you consider coming back again
[03:18:37.360 --> 03:18:39.400]   to share with us some additional findings
[03:18:39.400 --> 03:18:40.720]   is the second to last question.
[03:18:40.720 --> 03:18:43.680]   And then I'm just thinking that maybe the last question
[03:18:43.680 --> 03:18:47.360]   is so that it sticks in people's minds,
[03:18:47.360 --> 03:18:49.420]   would you be willing to share the song?
[03:18:49.420 --> 03:18:51.960]   - (laughs)
[03:18:51.960 --> 03:18:53.680]   Oh, Andrew, all right.
[03:18:53.680 --> 03:18:54.880]   Yes, I'm going to sing this.
[03:18:54.880 --> 03:18:56.800]   Now you have to remember, though,
[03:18:56.800 --> 03:19:01.400]   that I'm singing this because I think singing is fun
[03:19:01.400 --> 03:19:04.160]   and it shouldn't matter how good a voice you have.
[03:19:04.160 --> 03:19:05.720]   Okay, so here we go.
[03:19:05.720 --> 03:19:09.960]   This is to the old Sara Lee commercial.
[03:19:09.960 --> 03:19:11.560]   And everybody doesn't like something,
[03:19:11.560 --> 03:19:14.000]   but nobody doesn't like Sara Lee.
[03:19:14.000 --> 03:19:16.280]   ♪ Everybody doesn't know something ♪
[03:19:16.280 --> 03:19:19.100]   ♪ But everyone knows something else ♪
[03:19:19.100 --> 03:19:21.500]   ♪ Everyone can't do something ♪
[03:19:21.500 --> 03:19:23.960]   ♪ But everyone can do something else ♪
[03:19:23.960 --> 03:19:26.280]   So what have I lost by singing that?
[03:19:26.280 --> 03:19:29.440]   I know I can't sing, now you know I can't sing,
[03:19:29.440 --> 03:19:31.840]   but do you think my not being able to sing
[03:19:31.840 --> 03:19:36.800]   means I can't write, think, or do whatever it is
[03:19:36.800 --> 03:19:38.880]   that I do better than singing?
[03:19:38.880 --> 03:19:40.880]   No, of course not.
[03:19:40.880 --> 03:19:42.420]   I love the song.
[03:19:42.420 --> 03:19:44.340]   And thanks for saying you'll come back again.
[03:19:44.340 --> 03:19:45.400]   Thank you so much.
[03:19:45.400 --> 03:19:46.880]   - Thanks for having me.
[03:19:46.880 --> 03:19:48.760]   - Thank you for joining me for today's discussion
[03:19:48.760 --> 03:19:50.280]   with Dr. Ellen Langer.
[03:19:50.280 --> 03:19:53.280]   I hope you found it to be as fascinating as I did.

[03:20:30.840 --> 03:20:31.960]   For those of you that haven't heard,
[03:20:31.960 --> 03:20:33.160]   I have a new book coming out.
[03:20:33.160 --> 03:20:34.780]   It's my very first book.
[03:20:34.780 --> 03:20:36.160]   It's entitled "Protocols,
[03:20:36.160 --> 03:20:38.340]   "An Operating Manual for the Human Body."
[03:20:38.340 --> 03:20:39.520]   This is a book that I've been working on
[03:20:39.520 --> 03:20:40.660]   for more than five years,
[03:20:40.660 --> 03:20:43.000]   and that's based on more than 30 years
[03:20:43.000 --> 03:20:44.560]   of research and experience.
[03:20:44.560 --> 03:20:46.360]   And it covers protocols for everything
[03:20:46.360 --> 03:20:50.080]   from sleep to exercise to stress control,
[03:20:50.080 --> 03:20:52.560]   protocols related to focus and motivation.
[03:20:52.560 --> 03:20:55.920]   And of course, I provide the scientific substantiation
[03:20:55.920 --> 03:20:58.000]   for the protocols that are included.
[03:20:58.000 --> 03:21:01.880]   The book is now available by presale at protocolsbook.com.
[03:21:01.880 --> 03:21:04.240]   There you can find links to various vendors.
[03:21:04.240 --> 03:21:06.040]   You can pick the one that you like best.
[03:21:06.040 --> 03:21:07.720]   Again, the book is called "Protocols,
[03:21:07.720 --> 03:21:10.420]   "An Operating Manual for the Human Body."
[03:21:10.420 --> 03:21:12.480]   If you're not already following me on social media,
[03:21:12.480 --> 03:21:15.600]   I am Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[03:21:15.600 --> 03:21:18.320]   So that's InstagramX, formerly known as Twitter,
[03:21:18.320 --> 03:21:20.540]   Facebook, LinkedIn, and Threads.
[03:21:20.540 --> 03:21:21.720]   And on all those platforms,
[03:21:21.720 --> 03:21:23.800]   I discuss science and science-related tools,
[03:21:23.800 --> 03:21:25.360]   some of which overlaps with the content
[03:21:25.360 --> 03:21:26.760]   of the Huberman Lab podcast,
[03:21:26.760 --> 03:21:28.800]   but much of which is distinct from the content
[03:21:28.800 --> 03:21:30.320]   on the Huberman Lab podcast.
[03:21:30.320 --> 03:21:33.760]   Again, that's Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[03:21:33.760 --> 03:21:35.080]   And if you haven't already subscribed
[03:21:35.080 --> 03:21:36.680]   to our Neural Network newsletter,
[03:21:36.680 --> 03:21:37.960]   the Neural Network newsletter
[03:21:37.960 --> 03:21:40.000]   is a zero cost monthly newsletter
[03:21:40.000 --> 03:21:41.360]   that includes podcast summaries,
[03:21:41.360 --> 03:21:43.160]   as well as what we call protocols
[03:21:43.160 --> 03:21:45.440]   in the form of one to three page PDFs
[03:21:45.440 --> 03:21:47.720]   that cover everything from how to optimize your sleep,
[03:21:47.720 --> 03:21:50.520]   how to optimize dopamine, deliberate cold exposure.
[03:21:50.520 --> 03:21:52.280]   We have a foundational fitness protocol
[03:21:52.280 --> 03:21:55.360]   that covers cardiovascular training and resistance training.
[03:21:55.360 --> 03:21:57.840]   All of that is available completely zero cost.
[03:21:57.840 --> 03:21:59.560]   You simply go to hubermanlab.com,
[03:21:59.560 --> 03:22:01.440]   go to the menu tab in the top right corner,
[03:22:01.440 --> 03:22:03.960]   scroll down to newsletter and enter your email.
[03:22:03.960 --> 03:22:04.800]   And I should emphasize
[03:22:04.800 --> 03:22:07.380]   that we do not share your email with anybody.
[03:22:07.380 --> 03:22:08.680]   Thank you once again for joining me
[03:22:08.680 --> 03:22:11.120]   for today's discussion with Dr. Ellen Langer.
[03:22:11.120 --> 03:22:13.240]   And last, but certainly not least,
[03:22:13.240 --> 03:22:15.280]   thank you for your interest in science.
[03:22:15.280 --> 03:22:17.860]   (upbeat music)
[03:22:17.860 --> 03:22:21.200]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
