[00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.300]   Understanding how to build wealth isn't just about investing early or spending wisely,
[00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:07.760]   it's also about knowing where you are and what actually moves the needle.
[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:13.340]   So today, I'm joined by Nick Majuli, a data-driven financial writer and author of a great upcoming book,
[00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:19.520]   The Wealth Ladder, to break down the six levels of wealth in a way that's tactical, clear, and rooted in reality.
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:20.520]   As Nick puts it,
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.480]   If you can understand the wealth ladder, then you can really start to control your time and your life.
[00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.340]   In this episode, we'll break down every step of the wealth ladder,
[00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.600]   what separates those of us who move up from those who stall out,
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.740]   and how to make smarter decisions at each stage of your journey.
[00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:35.560]   I'm Chris Hutchins.

[00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:48.300]   Nick, what do you think most people get wrong when they think about growing their wealth?
[00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.140]   I think the main thing that people get wrong is they don't focus enough on income.
[00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.380]   I think income, it's the strongest relationship in all of personal finance.
[00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:58.600]   And there's a lot of things that matter.
[00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.360]   Your mindset matters.
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.140]   How you spend money matters.
[00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:01.320]   Of course, all those things matter.
[00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.000]   But the thing that's most correlated with building wealth is income.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.040]   It's not even close.
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.480]   Like everything I've seen in the data, and it's now overwhelming to me.
[00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.100]   Like I can't not see it anywhere else.
[00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.520]   It's very rare to see someone with low wealth and high income,
[00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.360]   or someone with high income and low wealth.
[00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.580]   Like they're just so correlated that if you have high income, you're going to get wealth, right?
[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.880]   Unless you're a crazy spender, which is very rare, and vice versa.
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.040]   So it's one of those things where like wealth builds income, income builds wealth,
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.520]   and it's just this flywheel that keeps working on itself.
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.100]   But it is possible to kind of confuse the two, right?
[00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.800]   Like to think, oh, because I have a lot of income, I have a lot of wealth.
[00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:40.600]   So while income might be really important, how is it also important to understand the distinction?
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.300]   Well, the distinction is like income is like it's the flow that's coming in.
[00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.960]   You now need to save that and make it into the stock, which is your wealth, right?
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.300]   And so a lot of people say, oh, I have all this stuff coming in.
[00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.660]   The problem is income is very fickle.
[00:01:52.660 --> 00:02:00.000]   Like they've done these studies, and roughly 10% of U.S. households are going to see a 50% drop in income in the next two years, right?
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.200]   And then they've studied this over time.
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.180]   It's relatively consistent.
[00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.540]   It shot up a little during like the 12% during the great financial crisis, but then it drops back down.
[00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.860]   But it's roughly 10%.
[00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:08.560]   So what does that mean?
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.280]   Roughly, you know, one in 20 people are going to lose their job in the next two years is not that crazy of a stat.
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.920]   But that, you know, you do that over a long time, and this does affect people.
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.460]   So income is very fickle.
[00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.620]   Like I like looking at like professional athletes.
[00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:19.620]   You're like, well, how do they end up broke?
[00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.980]   Well, they end up broke because they had five years of really high income, and they spent money based on their income, not on their wealth.
[00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.120]   They didn't accumulate wealth to keep sustaining that spending.
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.780]   And as a result, you know, you end up one day end up bankrupt because you don't have the flow.
[00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.600]   After five to seven years, that dries up, and then you have to live your rest of the life off that.
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.260]   So I think that's the difficulty with this stuff.
[00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.720]   Yeah, that's the argument.
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.000]   Everyone mathematically, lottery winners should always take the lump sum.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:52.520]   But I imagine that if you win the lottery and you take the payments over however many years, you are probably statistically likely to end up better off.
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.880]   People that win the lottery, not most, but some large percentage of them end up without money.
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.880]   Has anyone actually ever not taken the lump sum?
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.380]   I bet it's happened, but I bet it's almost, it's very rare if it's ever happened.
[00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:04.460]   But that's such a great point.
[00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.920]   Yeah, I think it would be hard to convince someone to do this inopportune thing.
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:14.060]   People don't typically take advice when you're saying, do this thing, because I don't trust that you'll be able to make good decisions.
[00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.740]   And plus, it's like, the thrill of the lump sum must be crazy.
[00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:19.080]   It must be absolutely insane.
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.980]   Yeah, I've never, I think the biggest lottery lump sum I ever had was like $10, you know?
[00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.460]   So I don't know that thrill.
[00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:32.800]   But in the most recent book, you've chosen to look at wealth as a ladder, and that wealth is not necessarily income.
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.960]   How do you think about that perspective?
[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:43.060]   I think the main thing to think about is like, as you build wealth, your financial decisions can change.
[00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.120]   What strategy makes sense for you can change as well.
[00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:55.140]   And so the analogy I give at the beginning of the book is like, a fitness coach would give very different advice to someone who's like morbidly obese versus like a well-trained athlete.
[00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.640]   I think we can apply that same analogy to financial advice.
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:07.280]   Like if you're just starting out and you have, you know, you have negative net worth or zero net worth, the advice I would give you is going to be very different than if you have like a million dollars.
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.800]   You're like, hey, how can I get to 10 million?
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.480]   How do I get to 20 million, et cetera, right?
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:16.160]   And so based on that, I've kind of classified wealth into these six levels, and we can talk about those.
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:22.180]   And based on which level you're in, based on your net worth, right, which is all your assets minus all your liabilities, we can get into that as well.
[00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.420]   It determines, okay, what income things do I think about?
[00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:25.260]   What spending things?
[00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.460]   What investment decisions would I make differently?
[00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.960]   And all those things impact your financial well-being.
[00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:41.500]   We're going to run through the levels, but do you think of it more as kind of conceptual levels or is there like an actual step function change where it's like where I get one more dollar here, things happen versus this kind of linear progression?
[00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.260]   No, it's of course, it's more of a linear progression than a step function change.
[00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:46.560]   And for every person, it's different.
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:47.660]   It depends where you live.
[00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.720]   I mean, there's all sorts of factors that impact this.
[00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:57.060]   I like thinking them as steps because I think there's just a mindset change that happens as you move throughout the levels.
[00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.240]   And the big thing is like each level is 10x from the other levels, right?
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.340]   So, you know, if you have, you know, less than $10,000 in net worth, that's level one.
[00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:07.700]   Level two is $10,000 to $100,000, right?
[00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.820]   The next level, level three is $100,000 to a million and et cetera, right?
[00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:16.640]   And the reason for that is because like you need a large step change to fundamentally change how you live your life, right?
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:26.700]   Someone with a million dollars, as nice as their life is, if I give them another million dollars, it's not going to change their life as much as if I took someone from zero and gave them a million dollars.
[00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:31.660]   Even though they're both a million dollars, like the person from zero to a million, their life's going to change in a ton of ways.
[00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.320]   The person with a million to two million, yeah, their life's going to change.
[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:37.520]   They're going to have a pretty nice improvement, but it won't change as much as the other person.
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:44.860]   I think everyone knows that intrinsically, but like seeing it happen in the real world and actually experiencing it is something in itself.
[00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:49.260]   By the way, all these levels, I think, map onto economic classes, at least within the United States.
[00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.860]   So for your U.S. listeners, I think this is going to map quite well.
[00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:55.560]   So once again, level one, less than $10,000 in total net worth.
[00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:58.960]   That includes your bank accounts, that includes your car, everything you own.
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.940]   You put it all together in a pile, less than $10,000, right?
[00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:04.440]   Level two is $10,000 to $100,000.
[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:05.840]   That's like the lower middle class.
[00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.600]   Level three is $100,000 to a million.
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.140]   That's your middle class America.
[00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:13.720]   Level four is $1 million to $10 million.
[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.280]   That's, I would consider the upper middle class.
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:21.140]   I know $10 million is going to sound like that's really upper middle, like in maybe the very high cost of living areas, that's upper middle class.
[00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:22.860]   But that's mostly upper class at this point.
[00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:26.520]   And then, you know, $10 million to $100 million, that's level five.
[00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:27.540]   That's definitely upper class.
[00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:29.580]   And then $100 million plus is like the super rich.
[00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:34.640]   And so each one of these levels, if I had to give you like a percentage of the United States, I'm going to approximate.
[00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:35.800]   These aren't the exact percentages.
[00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:40.900]   It's like 20% of households, U.S. households, so not just individuals, households are in level one.
[00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:43.140]   20% are in level two.
[00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:45.420]   40% are in level three.
[00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:46.300]   That's the middle class.
[00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:47.800]   That's, you know, $100,000 to a million.
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:51.480]   So now that's 80% of America is in levels one, two, and three.
[00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:54.700]   And then in the final 20% is level four and above.
[00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:58.320]   And in level four in particular, it's roughly like, you know, let's say 18%.
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:01.680]   And then the top 2% is level five and above.
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:06.140]   Actually, that level four figure, $1 million to $10 million, that's changed a lot in just the last few years.
[00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:08.640]   Before COVID to now, there's been a huge change.
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:09.780]   There's more millionaires than ever.
[00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:11.600]   A lot of it's like real estate prices have gone up.
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.200]   A lot of things like net worth has gone up.
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:18.860]   Doesn't mean that someone has a million dollars in their bank account, but total net worth, that has increased considerably.
[00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:23.040]   And so should people consider that when they're thinking about levels?
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:25.260]   Is it liquid net worth or their total net worth?
[00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:26.580]   It's total net worth.
[00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:29.020]   That's how we do the Wealth Flatter, and that's how I've done it.
[00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:33.120]   However, when you're talking about maybe spending decisions, I think you should look at liquid net worth.
[00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:34.900]   And we can get into that a little bit as well.
[00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:37.700]   I think that's the difference because you can't eat your home equity, right?
[00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:42.520]   I can't be like, oh, I have a million dollar house and $5,000 in my bank account, so I can go spend whatever.
[00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:43.940]   Like, no, not at all, right?
[00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:46.660]   In terms of just the Wealth Flatter in general, I think wealth matters.
[00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:48.300]   It doesn't matter where it is.
[00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:51.940]   But in terms of your spending decisions, it's definitely going to matter how it's comprised.
[00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:54.360]   I imagine we have listeners at every single one of those levels.
[00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:59.860]   So I'd love to give everyone a little bit of an overview of, like, what should you be thinking about this level?
[00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:03.000]   What are some of the challenges and tactics and risks when you're there?
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:03.640]   Yeah.
[00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:04.820]   So let's start at level one.
[00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:09.240]   So I like to say some piece of your life is being amplified in every wealth level.
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:13.960]   In level one, which is less than $10,000 in wealth, that amplification is bad luck.
[00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:22.860]   And what I mean by that is literally some unfortunate thing happens to you, and that can send your life down a very different path than if that thing hadn't happened.
[00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:24.100]   And this could be true of anyone.
[00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:25.960]   Like, anyone can get unlucky, can get sick or something.
[00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:27.340]   I'm not even talking about that.
[00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:28.920]   I'm talking just normal bad luck.
[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:29.900]   My tire blew out.
[00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:33.200]   I can't get to work now because of that, and then I lose my job, and then I'm in debt.
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:37.120]   If someone in level three or level four, their tire blew out, they would just get it repaired.
[00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:38.380]   It's an annoyance, right?
[00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:40.160]   But it's something that money can easily fix.
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:47.340]   For someone in level one, that's something where, like, a simple piece of bad luck you run into can really set you back a lot.
[00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:52.380]   And so the goal in level one is do everything you can to get out of level one.
[00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:55.420]   And so I'm usually not a fan of, like, cut your spending and all that.
[00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:56.760]   I'm not usually saying that.
[00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:00.040]   But in this case, like, if you want atypical results, you have to have atypical actions.
[00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:01.260]   You have to do something differently.
[00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:07.400]   So it's not a great place to be in because you have this constant fear of, oh, what if something happens, all this type of stuff.
[00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:10.220]   And so the goal of level one is to get out of level one.
[00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:10.680]   That's it.
[00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:12.920]   Once you're out of there, then you can kind of breathe easy a little bit.
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:15.360]   You heard about this during COVID when stimulus checks came in.
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:21.580]   People were like, oh, my gosh, I've never had this much money in my bank account, and I don't have to worry about how am I going to afford food this week.
[00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:26.820]   Something as simple as that, just even a few thousand dollars, you'll start to feel that stress falling away.
[00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:29.340]   But once you get into level two, you have $10,000.
[00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:36.340]   That's when it's much clearer that, like, okay, I have much more redundancy in my financial accounts.
[00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:40.560]   And so would you say cut spending and pick up extra work?
[00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:40.960]   Yeah.
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:45.280]   If you're in level one, like, I look at it as like an emergency in many cases.
[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:47.260]   Of course, that shouldn't be your long-term goal.
[00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.220]   It's like, oh, cut your spending and take your spending to zero.
[00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:50.200]   It's too difficult.
[00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:51.860]   And I've written about this extensively.
[00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:53.320]   I'm not a fan of cutting spending.
[00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:54.560]   I don't think it works.
[00:09:54.560 --> 00:10:00.840]   I think if you're in a drastic situation and you need to get out of that, there are ways you can try to do that.
[00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:03.080]   But the long-term goal is to increase your income.
[00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:07.240]   That is really the way at how you get out of any level to go forward.
[00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:07.960]   You have to increase your income.
[00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:12.580]   And there's different types of ways of increasing your income that we can discuss, and that would apply to different levels.
[00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:15.660]   But in terms of level one, like, the goal is just to get out.
[00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:17.080]   That's probably the biggest money change.
[00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:21.940]   Like, just going from level one to level two is going to have a bigger impact than basically anything else in your life.
[00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:23.600]   Okay, and so then you get to level two.
[00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:25.260]   Level two.
[00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.940]   At this point, okay, you have some financial resources saved.
[00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:29.840]   And people in level two are going to be all over the place.
[00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:32.500]   There's going to be people graduating from college who are like, well, I have no money.
[00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:36.780]   It's like, yeah, but you have a degree from a nice university and skills, and you're making a good income.
[00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:40.400]   You're basically not in level one, even though you don't have $10,000 in wealth.
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:43.400]   But you have, like, intangibles that are worth at least that much.
[00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:44.880]   So you have an education.
[00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:49.220]   You have skills that are going to allow you to generate the income to get out of level one easily.
[00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:54.780]   So level two, the thing I say to focus on is, like, once you're there, it's like, what else can you do to grow your income?
[00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:56.340]   So what type of skills can you learn?
[00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:57.740]   What type of education can you get?
[00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:00.940]   So the main thing to focus on there is your education.
[00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:04.300]   It's like the trajectory of your life, of your career, at least in this case.
[00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:10.060]   Like, what can you do so that that trajectory really takes off so you can really start amplifying your earnings?
[00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:17.140]   I think most people on level two, I would guess, you know, they make a good wage, but their entire earnings are just tied to how much they work.
[00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:21.340]   And I'm guessing they don't have that high of a wage.
[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:24.880]   And so as a result, it's like, you can feel like you're working 50, 60 hours a week.
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:26.660]   Like, Nick, I'm working really hard at this stuff.
[00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:29.360]   And at the same time, like, I'm not seeing enough progress.
[00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:31.020]   And the reason isn't because of your effort.
[00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:34.880]   It's like you're working hard, but the issue is your wage just isn't paying you enough, right?
[00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:41.000]   And so we have to be like, okay, how can I find a different income source, another income source that can actually get me to that next level?
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.920]   And how much is your age dependent on some of these levels?
[00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:57.700]   You know, when you started talking about college, I was thinking, you know, if someone's, you know, 50 years old and has a net worth of $10,000, you know, they're probably in a very different situation than someone who's 22 and saved their first $10,000.
[00:11:57.700 --> 00:11:58.680]   I agree completely.
[00:11:58.680 --> 00:11:59.780]   It's a very different situation.
[00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:06.440]   And so obviously, like, time is correlated with wealth in the sense, like, you've had more time to work and save money and all this stuff.
[00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:13.160]   So in general, you'll see, like, the median age within each level goes up and, like, the median age in level four is 62, by the way.
[00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:22.000]   So, like, if you took all the people who have one to 10 million, all the households in the United States that have one to $10 million and you put them in a room and you took the middle person, that person's 62 years old.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.820]   So as much as you see people, oh, they're young and rich and all, that's not the case.
[00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:26.940]   The data doesn't support that.
[00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:28.460]   So you're right.
[00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:30.480]   That age is a big, it's correlated a lot here.
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:35.740]   Either way, if you're in level two, you're in level two and you have to kind of deal with that.
[00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:37.780]   And it's like, okay, what can I do to increase my income?
[00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:38.760]   That's the question.
[00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:39.960]   And it's not going to happen overnight.
[00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:41.700]   It's like, it's a multi-year process.
[00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:46.400]   And you have to figure out what's the thing that's going to help me get there and start working on that thing.
[00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:47.200]   And it takes a ton of work.
[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:48.740]   There's no way around it.
[00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:50.920]   Like, I wish I could say there was a shortcut or something.
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:52.280]   There just isn't, unfortunately.

[00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:11.720]   I like how you added some freedom.
[00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:17.240]   So I'm going to, to help people kind of come up with a name here, you gave this level two grocery freedom, right?
[00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:17.560]   Yeah.
[00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:20.780]   So once we're talking about spending, level two is what I call grocery freedom.
[00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:26.820]   Not right when you get into level two, but as you kind of progress through level two, you can just care less and less about what you spend at the grocery store.
[00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:32.760]   By the time you have $100,000 in wealth, you know, let's just say liquid net worth, just to be very conservative here.
[00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:38.840]   You know, paying an extra dollar here for the cage-free eggs versus the non-cage-free, like it's not going to impact your wealth at all.
[00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:44.040]   And the reason where I came up with this is like, I use something called the 0.01% rule.
[00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:47.160]   And all that is, is just 0.01% of your net worth.
[00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:49.780]   So take your net worth and divide by 10,000.
[00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:51.240]   That's the same thing as 0.01%.
[00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:56.660]   So if you have a net worth of $10,000, that difference is 10,000 divided by 10,001.
[00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:57.360]   So it's $1.
[00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:02.040]   If your net worth's 100,000, you divide by 10,000, that, that value is 10.
[00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:07.960]   And that's how much extra you can spend per day without your having to worry about like losing your wealth or anything like that.
[00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:12.360]   The assumption is that your wealth is going to grow by 0.01% per day, which is 3.7% a year.
[00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:14.540]   And I don't think anyone's going to be like, oh, that's a crazy return.
[00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:15.900]   No, it's a very conservative return.
[00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:21.460]   And so, you know, given that, I think anyone's wealth will be able to grow at roughly that rate over time.
[00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:26.920]   And that's not how much you can spend in a day because it kind of assumes you're working and you have income.
[00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:27.200]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:27.900]   That's just like...
[00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:28.480]   That's extra.
[00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:33.220]   If things cost that much extra one day over the other, don't stress it.
[00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:33.580]   Yeah.
[00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:36.520]   So like the idea is like, and I'm not assuming this is going to be true of most people.
[00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:38.240]   Like, okay, you're spending all of your income.
[00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:44.480]   Even after you've done that, you can still spend whatever your wealth throws off and your wealth would, in theory, stay the same over time.
[00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:51.120]   Now, of course, I'm hoping you're not spending all your income, you're saving money, but it's just a good mental heuristic when you're looking at something.
[00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:56.600]   So like if you know your net worth is somewhere between $10,000 and $100,000, don't sweat it at the grocery store.
[00:16:56.600 --> 00:17:00.120]   But when you go to a restaurant, okay, maybe you need to be careful about what you buy, right?
[00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:05.960]   And so, for example, if you're in level four, $1 million to $10 million, and I know we jumped over level three, we can come back.
[00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:08.680]   But $1 million to $10 million, that's called travel freedom.
[00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:10.540]   So that's the beginning of travel freedom.
[00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:15.240]   So, for example, if I'm in level four, when I go to a restaurant, I don't look at the prices.
[00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:16.580]   I enjoy whatever I want.
[00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:20.980]   Besides, like, the wine list, which is a little crazy sometimes, outside of that, I just get whatever I want.
[00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:25.880]   Now, when it comes to travel stuff, I'm very particular on, like, what I buy.
[00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:31.620]   I'm always buying coach, even though, even if someone had $1 to $10 million, I would say, yeah, you got to try and get the cheapest stuff.
[00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:34.920]   You got to save money where you can because that marginal difference is pretty expensive.
[00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:38.240]   Going from, like, a coach seat to business class is not necessarily cheap.
[00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:40.880]   And so, it's about I spend according to my level.
[00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:42.420]   And I'm not saying everyone has to do that.
[00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:44.420]   It's what I recommend if you spend according to your level.
[00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:49.560]   It doesn't mean you're going to build wealth, but it's going to prevent you from falling down the wealth ladder, which I think is the more important thing.
[00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:50.800]   So, let's go back to level three.
[00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:51.260]   Yeah.
[00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:55.500]   So, level three, you're, you know, assuming in level two, you've gotten the education or you've gotten the skills you need.
[00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:56.940]   Now, you're kind of earning more money.
[00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:58.660]   So, you're kind of, you're able to save more.
[00:17:58.660 --> 00:17:59.360]   Now, you're in level three.
[00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:03.020]   What else can you do to kind of keep that ball moving in the right direction?
[00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:04.900]   That's where investing comes in.
[00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:05.960]   Investing or a side hustle?
[00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:06.760]   One or the other.
[00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:08.660]   And so, for a lot of people, it's investing.
[00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:11.500]   I'm not saying you shouldn't be investing when you're in level one or level two.
[00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:16.700]   I'm just saying it doesn't matter as much in terms of the total dollars that's being generated, right?
[00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:18.060]   And so, I'll give you a simple example.
[00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:21.440]   If you have $10,000 and you generate a 10% return, that's $1,000.
[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:22.280]   That's great.
[00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:27.780]   But as someone who's working, you can more easily generate income just through your labor than you can through your capital.
[00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:28.620]   You don't have a lot of money.
[00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:30.600]   The 10 grand is not that much in the grand scheme of things.
[00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:33.580]   But by the time you get to level three, now you have 100 grand.
[00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:35.260]   Now, a 10% return is $10,000.
[00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:37.520]   That's now starting to compete with you a little bit.
[00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:38.560]   And I saw a tweet today.
[00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:39.380]   It was actually very funny.
[00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:43.000]   If your investment portfolio earns you more than your job, is your job a side hustle?
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.180]   Like, it's a joke.
[00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:48.340]   But it gets at the point, which I'm getting at, is over time, if you're investing your money,
[00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:51.120]   like, your investment portfolio is going to get large enough for that.
[00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:52.840]   It's actually generating more income than you are.
[00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:55.380]   And especially if you're in level four, that's going to be true.
[00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:56.680]   So we can get to level four in a sec.
[00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:59.600]   But the main thing to think about there is investment side hustles.
[00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:01.080]   What else can I do to raise my income?
[00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:05.900]   And by investing, that's the way that I've seen most people that go from level three to level four.
[00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:07.800]   They just keep buying assets over time.
[00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:10.080]   And those assets generate more income and more income.
[00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:11.100]   And it just grows from there.
[00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:15.280]   And the last time you were on the show, we talked a lot about your previous book, Just Keep Buying.
[00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:17.580]   We've had a handful of shows about investing.
[00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:22.000]   So we won't go deep today on investing and index funds and ways to do that.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.880]   But I totally hear you.
[00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:26.100]   Like, at that level, it starts to matter.
[00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:27.300]   Whereas...
[00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:29.680]   And I can't remember if this was from our conversation before.
[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:33.860]   But, you know, sometimes I meet people really early in their financial journey, right?
[00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:35.720]   They just saved their first $5,000.
[00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:37.940]   And they're like, what should I invest in?
[00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:42.280]   And in a way, it's like, I want you to pick up good habits early.
[00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:48.340]   But whether you get a 10% return, a 5% return, or a 20% return on your first $1,000,
[00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:52.460]   like, we're talking tens of dollars difference.
[00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:58.820]   And if you picked up a side hustle for one hour a week, you know, you'd probably outperform that.
[00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:01.280]   And so it matters a lot more later.
[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:07.020]   But I think the habits you pick up earlier can translate and pay dividends in the future.
[00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:09.380]   So it's, like, important, but also not.
[00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:10.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:10.980]   You're completely right.
[00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:12.020]   Both of those things matter.
[00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:13.340]   I want people to learn about investing.
[00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:14.060]   I want them to care.
[00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:15.900]   But you don't want to obsess over it.
[00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:19.620]   As your portfolio gets bigger and bigger, once you're in level 4, level 5, etc.
[00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:22.880]   And at any of those levels, then everything, like, investments are everything.
[00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:24.180]   Because your labor is...
[00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:25.620]   You're not going to be able to compete with yourself, right?
[00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:28.540]   It's like your portfolio is generating more income than you are.
[00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:29.860]   And so you're at a point where you're like, oh, my gosh.
[00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:31.580]   Like, my investment decisions really matter now.
[00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:33.380]   And that transition slowly happens over time.
[00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:34.700]   Unless your income just keeps going up.
[00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:35.140]   Which, great.
[00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:35.900]   Congrats for you.
[00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:39.240]   But for most people, at some point, their portfolio is going to generate more income
[00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:39.820]   than they will.
[00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:46.040]   So it seems like at level 2, the risk was, you know, go get a lot more education and skills
[00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:46.980]   and career path.
[00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:49.300]   Because the risk is that you kind of don't move up.
[00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:54.100]   In level 3, what are some of the risks people should be thinking about that might kind of prevent
[00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:55.320]   them from moving up?
[00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:59.040]   I think that's where overspending can really get you into it.
[00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:00.520]   Because once you're like, oh, look, I'm making more money.
[00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:03.860]   And then you start investing, you're bringing more income, which is great.
[00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:08.060]   But if you start spending all of that income, then especially in level 3, which is like,
[00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:09.020]   hey, you're in the middle class.
[00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:13.720]   Now there's like social status and all these things that I think the middle class and the
[00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:18.200]   upper middle class get much more wrapped up in than I think than other economic classes
[00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:18.440]   do.
[00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:22.040]   People in level 3 and level 4, their lives aren't that different in terms of a consumption
[00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:23.080]   habit, like very similar.
[00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:26.940]   They might live in a slightly nicer neighborhood or they drive a slightly nicer car, but they
[00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:28.280]   pay a lot of money for that.
[00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:31.760]   So if you're thinking, oh my gosh, people in level 4 are flying private and people in level
[00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:34.460]   3 are flying coach, like nope, they're in the same plane.
[00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:37.180]   They might be in a slightly better seat, but the lifestyles are very similar.
[00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:40.720]   I think people in level 1 and like people in level 3, very different lifestyles, right?
[00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:43.140]   Like they're in the stress levels, everything's very different.
[00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:47.060]   But in terms of, you know, level 3 and level 4, the difference is not really that high,
[00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:52.040]   but people will spend a lot of money for status and all sorts of things that like changes their
[00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:55.920]   perception of themselves, but it doesn't necessarily really change their lifestyle that much.
[00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:59.060]   If I had to pick like what's the one thing that prevents people from just getting into level
[00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:02.480]   4, assuming they have a decent income, it's probably from overspending of some sort and
[00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:04.200]   going after and chasing those things.
[00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:09.320]   And I know what you do day to day for work, but I'm curious for people who think, oh, are
[00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:10.220]   these Nick's ideas?
[00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:11.440]   What kind of data went into this?
[00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:16.780]   How much kind of research and data have you dug through when you kind of put all this together?
[00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:18.300]   There's a lot of stuff.
[00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:20.340]   So there's two different data sources I use.
[00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:23.920]   The main one, which is the snapshot data is from the Federal Reserve.
[00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:25.440]   It's called the Survey of Consumer Finances.
[00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:30.180]   It just looks at just wealth in different US households over time.
[00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:33.480]   It samples them and then you can wait it and figure out all these statistics and all that.
[00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:37.500]   That was very useful for just understanding wealth in general in the United States.
[00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:41.900]   But if I wanted to understand how household wealth actually changes over time, you have to
[00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:43.620]   follow the same set of households, right?
[00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:47.580]   So the SCF Data Survey of Consumer Finances doesn't do that.
[00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:51.700]   But there's another data set called the Panel Study of Income Dynamics from the University
[00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:52.120]   of Michigan.
[00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:54.080]   They follow the same households over time.
[00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:57.340]   So that's how I was able to talk about all this stuff with building wealth.
[00:22:57.340 --> 00:22:58.600]   And there's an analysis in the book.
[00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:02.820]   I say, look, the difference between the people that were started in level 3 and got to level
[00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:07.260]   4 versus those that started in level 3 and stayed in level 3, the main difference is
[00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:09.520]   their starting income and how much money they spent, right?
[00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:12.700]   It's true in basically every wealth level, the people, if you compare the households in
[00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:16.440]   level 2 that got to level 3 versus those that were in level 2 that stayed in level 2,
[00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:23.060]   the ones that got to level 3, A, had a higher income, but also didn't spend as much relative
[00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:25.260]   to their income as people that stayed in level 2.
[00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:28.880]   So there's like a lot of cases where everyone in level 2 is spending the same amount of money,
[00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:31.640]   but the people that have more income, they end up making it to level 3.
[00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:35.720]   So I think spending does matter and you can kind of see it in the data, but you have to really
[00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:39.180]   parse it out in different ways and what prevents people from climbing the wealth ladder.
[00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:42.740]   And at some point, spending can do that, but for the most part, I say it's income.
[00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:46.240]   Okay, so you said level 3 and level 4 are similar.
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:47.180]   Where are they different?
[00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:53.060]   They're different in the sense of once you're in level 4, which is $1 million to $10 million,
[00:23:53.060 --> 00:24:00.460]   I think you can really take your foot off the gas in a way that most people in level 3
[00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:01.320]   probably couldn't.
[00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:03.300]   Like you can start doing something called coast fire.
[00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:07.240]   Basically, coast fire is this idea of like, hey, I don't have to work this job anymore.
[00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:10.160]   I've saved enough money for my retirement, all these things.
[00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:14.320]   I can work something where I don't get paid as much and I just enjoy more and I just need
[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:16.440]   to get through like the next 15 years and then I'll be good.
[00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:17.840]   I'm just kind of coasting, right?
[00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:23.380]   I think there are people in level 3, $100,000 to $1 million that can coast, but I think you
[00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:25.320]   have to be in like kind of living a low cost of living area.
[00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:30.300]   I think for most of the US, which is like let's say mid to high cost of living, you kind
[00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:31.980]   of need to be in level 4 before you can do that.
[00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:35.300]   So it gives you a little bit more freedom over what you do for your job.
[00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:38.380]   If you love your job and you're level 3, you've already made it.
[00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:40.860]   Like I say level 3, level 4, they're very similar to me.
[00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:44.600]   The only difference is kind of that time freedom you might be able to have in a higher cost of
[00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:45.140]   living area.
[00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:47.480]   So that's kind of the main difference I would say.
[00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:52.120]   And so I call level 4 travel freedom, level 3 restaurant freedom, but they're similar
[00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:54.780]   in a lot of ways because you just start the travel freedom in level 4.
[00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:58.820]   You're not truly like, oh, I can go do whatever and travel however I want until you're much
[00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:03.040]   deeper in there, which is like $8, $9, $10 million, which is obviously a lot of money.
[00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:04.840]   So and most people will never make it there.
[00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:07.620]   So I like the concept of coast fire, coast fire.
[00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:12.920]   And the thing I think about it is that you've kind of saved enough money that if you stopped
[00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:17.360]   contributing to your retirement or whatever you want to call that long term savings,
[00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:19.680]   bucket, you'd probably be okay working.
[00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:26.280]   And so you can, if you want, you can adjust your income by changing your job such that you
[00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:31.300]   can live on your earnings, but you don't need to keep contributing to savings because chances
[00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:35.980]   are over, you know, like you said, you know, your savings is going to grow over time as it's
[00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:36.360]   invested.
[00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:42.660]   And when you've got $1 to $10 million saved, that will grow to be probably what you need when
[00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:46.900]   you're done working, assuming, you know, you're not trying to stop working now.
[00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:48.580]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:50.320]   It allows a little bit more flexibility.
[00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:51.300]   That's the only difference.
[00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:53.640]   And it depends, you know, well, where are you in level three?
[00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:55.500]   And that's where it's like, yes, this is a step function.
[00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:58.840]   But at the same time, like if you're at a hundred thousand, that's very different from
[00:25:58.840 --> 00:25:59.860]   someone with a 5 million, right?
[00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:03.600]   That's someone low on level three versus someone middle level four, obviously very different.
[00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:08.200]   But if you're like, oh, I have 800,000 net worth or I have 1.4 million, like, you know,
[00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:09.480]   that's $600,000.
[00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:12.240]   That's a lot of money, but their lifestyles are not that different.
[00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:16.560]   Even though that's a large difference, like that $600,000 is not going to generate enough
[00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:19.060]   income on its own for you to, unless you consume it all, right?
[00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:21.960]   If you plan on consuming all of your resources, then yeah, it is a big difference.
[00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:23.720]   But most people don't want to consume all the resource.
[00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:25.900]   They want to leave money to the next generation, et cetera.
[00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:28.920]   As a result, you know, the income that generates is not that high.
[00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:30.100]   So that's something to keep in mind.
[00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:36.160]   And what are some of the risks that people face as they're kind of creeping up level four
[00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:38.620]   that are different than what you might have at level three?
[00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:39.640]   Yeah.
[00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:44.420]   So the risks I think about, obviously investment decisions, you know, once again, you're 10X more
[00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:47.440]   wealth, the investment decisions are 10X more important, right?
[00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:48.020]   All else equal.
[00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:51.020]   So bad investment decisions that can lead to all sorts of stuff.
[00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:56.140]   And I don't have too much data on this in particular, like what the portfolios are of millionaire
[00:26:56.140 --> 00:27:00.360]   households versus like households with a hundred thousand to a million in terms of what's in
[00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:01.380]   their actual portfolios.
[00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:05.820]   But I would guess that the people, as you kind of move up the wealth ladder, there's a little
[00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:07.240]   bit more concentration going on.
[00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:08.420]   So there is some of that.
[00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:12.680]   If you said, hey, I have a bunch of individual stocks and maybe they did well, and you keep
[00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:16.260]   making those types of bets in level four and beyond, like you could keep growing your
[00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:17.580]   wealth or you could lose a lot of it.
[00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:21.160]   So I think that the thing is, once you're in level four, you want to kind of get more diversified,
[00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:21.320]   right?
[00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:22.140]   You want to protect that.
[00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:24.780]   You probably want to start owning more treasury bills.
[00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:28.220]   I mean, also, it depends on a host of things in your life without knowing much about you.
[00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:31.580]   It's very hard to make a quote recommendation or advice, and I'm not trying to give that advice.
[00:27:31.580 --> 00:27:35.740]   But at the end of the day, like protection, I think is a little bit more important in level
[00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:37.280]   four than it is in level three.
[00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:40.900]   And so it's something to think about as you're kind of making that transition.
[00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:45.740]   It's like, okay, am I over concentrated or is, am I, you know, overlooking some risk in
[00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:47.660]   my financial life, in my investment portfolio?
[00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:51.520]   It matters in every level, but it's obviously much more important because you can't make up for
[00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:52.320]   it with your income, right?
[00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:55.560]   Let's say you have $5 million and you make a 10% investment mistake.
[00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:56.520]   That's $500,000.
[00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:59.420]   Like, let's say you can save $100,000 a year, which is a lot of money.
[00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:03.480]   That would take you five years to make up for a mistake that could happen in the course of
[00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:04.200]   a few months, right?
[00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:08.920]   So if you're in level three and you can save $100,000 a year, you can make up for that type
[00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:10.120]   of mistake very easily, right?
[00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:16.580]   So that's the difference is like your labor is far, far less useful at impacting your finances.
[00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:21.100]   And so because of that, all the decisions you make not related to your labor and your work
[00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:22.340]   are probably much more important.
[00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:22.600]   Yeah.
[00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:27.140]   One other thing you mentioned in the book was kind of the role of these kind of speculative
[00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:29.920]   investments that come in as you start building your wealth.
[00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:34.240]   And it's something I've seen amongst people in that kind of level four camp.
[00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:40.560]   And the risks that I've seen them face is one, they kind of feel like, oh, wow, now I
[00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:45.820]   maybe see this path to being on level five one day and they start wanting to act like that.
[00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:49.820]   And they're like, I need to be doing these crazy, you know, private syndicated real estate deals
[00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:51.680]   and investing in private equity funds.
[00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:57.520]   And one, I'm not sure they need to be doing that because the amount at which they're doing
[00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:02.100]   relative to the potential outsized return, I'm not sure it has the impact it does.
[00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:07.120]   But the other thing I've seen people come into a problem with is they want to get, let's
[00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:08.760]   call it fancier with their investments.
[00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:13.940]   And they don't realize the kind of liquidity constraint that comes with some of these sophisticated
[00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:14.480]   vehicles.
[00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:19.940]   And if you're thinking about someone who has $50 million, if they've got $40 million tied
[00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:22.900]   up somewhere that they can't really access for five years, well, that's okay.
[00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:23.980]   They've got this other $10 million.
[00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:29.740]   But if you've got $3 million and you tie up $2.9 million of it in a way you can't access
[00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:36.060]   it, I've seen a handful of people that are squarely like far into level four that are
[00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:38.420]   like, I can't get any of my money.
[00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:42.360]   Like I've tried to do all these sophisticated things and like their problem is they don't
[00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:43.800]   actually have access to any of it.
[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:45.880]   I don't know if you've seen that in this level or not.
[00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:47.860]   Yeah, no, I think it definitely is an issue.
[00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:51.600]   I don't obviously don't have data on like what percentage of households are locked up in
[00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:53.100]   private investment vehicles.
[00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:57.640]   But I do think it's something that people overlook like liquidity matters and you don't
[00:29:57.640 --> 00:29:59.420]   realize how much it matters until you need it.
[00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:00.580]   It's like you forget about it.
[00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:03.980]   It's like, you know, you're you're living in a paradise and all of a sudden you realize
[00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:06.220]   that we're in a drought and you're like, I need water and like I don't have it.
[00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:08.380]   And it's like liquidity is a very real thing in that sense.
[00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:11.140]   It's like you don't you don't actually realize you need it until you actually need it.
[00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:11.300]   Right.
[00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:12.140]   And so I agree with you.
[00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:16.140]   I think people should be mindful of how liquid they are, especially once you're at that level.
[00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:18.420]   It's like, okay, you know, I have, you know, let's see, 3 million bucks.
[00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:18.640]   Okay.
[00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:21.200]   Maybe I can have 10%, maybe 20% private investments.
[00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:22.380]   That's still a good amount of money.
[00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:23.900]   $600,000 you can't access.
[00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:24.700]   That's a lot of money.
[00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:28.280]   But, you know, if you're having, you know, anywhere over 50% of your net worth, that's
[00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:29.120]   where it kind of gets difficult.
[00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:30.680]   And then this is the same with owning a business.
[00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:32.720]   You can own a business that's shooting off a lot of income.
[00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:33.180]   That's great.
[00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:36.640]   But if you can't sell it or something at the end of the day, that's just like having
[00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:37.340]   the liquid investment.
[00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:40.720]   And in many cases, it's like a job you have to keep working, right, to service the income.
[00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:43.280]   So it's it's a it's interesting place to be in.
[00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:47.700]   And what are some of the biggest things that change as you go from level four to level five?
[00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:51.480]   So most people don't go to level five.
[00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:53.920]   And I don't mean this as a diss or anything like that.
[00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:58.720]   It's just the the things that got you into level four are not the things that get you into
[00:30:58.720 --> 00:30:59.380]   level five.
[00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:04.300]   And the biggest surprise I got from, you know, going through this whole process, analyzing
[00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:08.120]   all this wealth data, et cetera, was just how hard it is to get a level four.
[00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:09.020]   Now, let me give you an example.
[00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:11.980]   Let's say you've acquired a million dollars in assets, right?
[00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:14.140]   Let's just pretend it's all liquid for now just to make it easy.
[00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:17.940]   You have a million dollars and you're saving $100,000 a year after tax.
[00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:19.740]   How long does it take until you get to $10 million?
[00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:25.540]   The answer and by the way, growing at 5% a year, the answer is 28 years.
[00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:27.800]   Let's say we kick that up to $300,000.
[00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:30.120]   You're saving $300,000 a year, right, with your million dollars.
[00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:31.540]   How long would it take you to get to $10 million?
[00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:33.040]   17 years.
[00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:35.780]   You know, do you know how hard it is to save $300,000 after tax?
[00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:36.740]   It's incredibly difficult.
[00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:38.480]   You have to have a really huge income.
[00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:39.620]   You have to be making $700,000.
[00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:42.400]   Like when you really do the math on this, you're like, holy crap.
[00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:44.880]   That's why I think a lot of people get stuck in the data shows.
[00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:47.120]   The level you're most likely to get stuck in is level four.
[00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:47.960]   That's not a bad thing.
[00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:48.820]   I think level four is great.
[00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:50.860]   I think you can have an amazing life in level three, level four.
[00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:52.500]   You don't need to make it to level five.
[00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:53.920]   This is where Coast Fire kind of comes in.
[00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:54.960]   So I brought this idea up.
[00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:57.680]   The things that got you in there are not the things that are going to get you to level five.
[00:31:57.680 --> 00:31:58.940]   You have to do something completely different.
[00:31:58.940 --> 00:31:59.940]   Start your own business.
[00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:00.900]   Join a startup.
[00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:01.860]   Get equity early.
[00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:03.220]   And it has to sell for a ton of money.
[00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:06.000]   Like that's the only way I've seen people get out.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.760]   There's obviously exceptions, celebrities, entertainers, stuff like that.
[00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:11.280]   But for the most part, assume you're not one of those people.
[00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:12.940]   You got to start a business.
[00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:14.020]   That's the only way to do it.
[00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:15.380]   I call it the no man's land of wealth.
[00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:17.440]   And it's not a bad thing, but it's like you can't get out.
[00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:18.600]   You're not getting out of level four.
[00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:19.160]   You're stuck in there.
[00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:23.140]   So like once, like I expect myself to be in level four the rest of my life.
[00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:24.380]   I could sell a million books, right?
[00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:27.660]   Even after tax and everything, I'm not nowhere close to level five, right?
[00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:29.540]   I'm still like just treading water, right?
[00:32:29.540 --> 00:32:32.600]   So it's like I could do all this stuff and I'm still not going to get out of that.
[00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:33.340]   I have something crazy.
[00:32:33.340 --> 00:32:37.460]   I have to go and, you know, start my own business, do this whole other thing for me to get there.
[00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:40.580]   And I don't really think that's going to be worth the trade-offs of doing that.
[00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:42.880]   So everyone has to make those decisions personally.
[00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:46.020]   And that's why I think Coast Fire is such a great solution for a lot of this stuff because
[00:32:46.020 --> 00:32:49.720]   you can spend more time with family, kids, whatever, those things that you care about.
[00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:52.560]   But I think that getting to that point is what really matters.
[00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:58.520]   And, you know, even if you waited those 28 years saving $100,000 a year, you finally you say,
[00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:00.220]   oh, I just got to $10 million.
[00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:06.740]   That doesn't necessarily mean anything changes the moment you go from 9.99 to 10.
[00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:09.480]   So I guess we can come back to the question I brought up earlier.
[00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:13.420]   It's like, how do you know when anything in your life should change?
[00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:18.100]   You didn't say it yet, but I know that the spending freedom in level five is house freedom.
[00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:24.120]   You know, I assume someone who goes from $9,999,000 to $10 million isn't like, great,
[00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:25.380]   I can buy seven homes now.
[00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:28.020]   You know, it doesn't change on a dime.
[00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:35.040]   So how do people generally know when they can change when they're comfortable spending a little
[00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:36.660]   more or doing different things?
[00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:40.240]   That's where the I try to really use the point of one percent rule.
[00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:43.780]   Like I really believe that that rule helps because over time, as you're saying, hey, look,
[00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:45.320]   I've demonstrated I can build wealth.
[00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:48.020]   It allows you to spend more and more in certain categories.
[00:33:48.020 --> 00:33:52.900]   Now, of course, like where that and it's a sliding scale because it's 0.01% of your wealth.
[00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:55.740]   It's always if your wealth keeps increasing, that number is going up, right?
[00:33:55.740 --> 00:34:00.040]   So if you have, you know, a million dollars, you can spend 100 bucks a day without even thinking
[00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:00.600]   about it, right?
[00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:04.860]   And that's my 100 bucks a day on top of whatever else you're spending, assuming you're not spending
[00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:05.360]   above your income.
[00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:05.860]   That is right.
[00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:09.140]   So like it's one of those things where like, hey, oh, this is going to cost me 100 bucks.
[00:34:09.140 --> 00:34:09.760]   Don't sweat it.
[00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:14.000]   So if you're in level four and you and $20 dropped out of your pocket and you can't find
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.860]   it, you just don't spend time looking for it.
[00:34:15.860 --> 00:34:16.360]   It's gone.
[00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:17.000]   No big deal.
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:17.760]   Move on, right?
[00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:19.860]   It's one of those things where like it's not going to impact you.
[00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:21.500]   You just got to kind of move on with your life.
[00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:25.640]   And so when I start thinking about like, OK, well, you know, when does it change?
[00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:27.000]   There's no exact moment.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.600]   And a lot of this is psychology in terms of how people think about money.
[00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:33.980]   But I like to really use this rule because, you know, when I was younger, I go to a restaurant.
[00:34:33.980 --> 00:34:34.560]   I would not.
[00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:35.820]   I'd be like, yo, I got to get the cheapest thing.
[00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:36.660]   I can't afford this stuff.
[00:34:36.660 --> 00:34:36.840]   Right.
[00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:39.800]   And so now and then over time, I kind of gave myself the freedom to spend more.
[00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:42.900]   Now I go to a restaurant, I get whatever I want, what I want, you know, basically, besides,
[00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:45.940]   as I said, the expensive French wine, I'll pass on those things.
[00:34:45.940 --> 00:34:47.300]   But everything else, I don't care.
[00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:48.060]   I just want it.
[00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:48.680]   I'll get it right.
[00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:51.060]   And that's only because I've demonstrated the discipline.
[00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:51.880]   I built the wealth.
[00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:53.360]   I spent a lot of time doing this stuff.
[00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:54.680]   It allows some lifestyle creep.
[00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:56.360]   There's going to be people say, don't let your lifestyle creep.
[00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:57.020]   Don't let your lifestyle creep.
[00:34:57.020 --> 00:35:01.500]   I'm like, yeah, let your lifestyle creep if you've demonstrated the financial discipline to
[00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:01.920]   build wealth.
[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:04.140]   And I say it gets you a little bit the best of both worlds.
[00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:06.780]   That's what I'm really trying to do is get rid of spending guilt, but I'm not giving you
[00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:08.460]   free reign to spend on everything.
[00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:10.840]   And that's where I think this is a nice balance of those two things.
[00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:13.340]   This episode is brought to you by Masterclass.
[00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:18.000]   I have learned so much about everything from communication to leadership to negotiation from
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.660]   business experts on this show.
[00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:22.480]   But if you're like me, you are always hungry for more.
[00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:24.320]   And that's when I turned to Masterclass.

[00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:57.840]   But recently, I wanted to set up some great habits for 2025, and I took James Clear's class
[00:35:57.840 --> 00:35:59.500]   on habits, and it was so helpful.
[00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:01.240]   And it's not just me that loves it.

[00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:25.540]   This episode is brought to you by Notion.
[00:36:25.540 --> 00:36:30.020]   Now, I'm always juggling everything from goal setting for the business, to outlining big
[00:36:30.020 --> 00:36:35.240]   projects, to planning travel, and I do it all in Notion because it's so simple and beautifully
[00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:39.880]   designed, letting you combine notes, docs, and tasks into one seamless space.
[00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:43.880]   And the new Notion AI is a single AI tool that does it all.

[00:36:49.780 --> 00:36:51.680]   and chat with you about anything.
[00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:55.440]   It feels like having a personal assistant built right into your workspace.

[00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:47.460]   What advice would you have for someone who may or may not be like me, where it's like,
[00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:48.600]   okay, I've done the math.
[00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:49.280]   I've run the numbers.
[00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:55.160]   I've used the 0.01% rule, and I should be able to spend these things.
[00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:59.480]   But I find myself sometimes getting caught up.
[00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:01.460]   And this is a psychological issue, right?
[00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:02.200]   It's not a financial issue.
[00:38:02.660 --> 00:38:06.300]   There are days where my wife and I are at the grocery store, and we're like, God, that's
[00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:08.340]   like, I remember we were at Costco the other day.
[00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:11.740]   It was like organic strawberries are like $11.99 or something like that.
[00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:13.180]   They're normally like $7.99.
[00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:16.380]   And we were like, we're fighting ourselves.
[00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:18.580]   And we're like, I know this doesn't matter.
[00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:20.740]   But also, it seems egregious.
[00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:22.820]   Like, any tips for people like that?
[00:38:22.820 --> 00:38:24.740]   That's something you just have to deal with personally.
[00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:25.160]   You're like, wow.
[00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:26.520]   Because it feels like you're getting ripped off.
[00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:27.760]   It feels like an injustice.
[00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:30.740]   And it doesn't matter if an injustice is a penny or $10 or $100.
[00:38:30.740 --> 00:38:32.160]   It feels wrong.
[00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:32.900]   And I get that.
[00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:35.840]   At the same time, you'd be like, well, how much do I care about strawberries?
[00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:37.220]   Do I need to have these strawberries?
[00:38:37.220 --> 00:38:38.620]   Can I just get a different berry?
[00:38:38.620 --> 00:38:42.460]   Like, if you really care about that, like, obviously, there's some point where it's like,
[00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:44.240]   okay, well, Nick, you can spend $100 a day.
[00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:45.480]   Why don't you spend $100 for strawberries?
[00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:46.820]   Because I'm like, yeah, that's kind of silly.
[00:38:46.820 --> 00:38:49.880]   Like, at some point, like, there's like a full premium.
[00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:51.020]   You don't want to be a fool either.
[00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:51.260]   Okay.
[00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:55.780]   I know we probably, I'm going to say maybe we have one or two listeners in level six.
[00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:57.580]   So, we don't need to spend too much time there.
[00:38:57.580 --> 00:38:58.880]   But what happens there?
[00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:00.380]   Well, I'll say the same thing.
[00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:02.060]   I'll talk about level five and six together.
[00:39:02.060 --> 00:39:06.280]   Because I think the main thing to focus on, and this is helpful for any wealth level.
[00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:10.360]   But as you get to level five, level six, as you just build wealth in general,
[00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:14.880]   all of your problems in your life are less likely to be money problems.
[00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:18.180]   I'm not saying you can't have money problems in level six or level five or level four.
[00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:20.920]   But when you're in level one, you could have other problems.
[00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:22.500]   But most of your problems are money problems.
[00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:27.200]   As you get to the higher wealth levels, all of your problems cannot be solved by money.
[00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:29.220]   And that is the big realization.
[00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:33.000]   Because you can't write, you can't like, oh, well, I've been working so much to build this wealth,
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:34.880]   to sell this business, so now I'm worth $15 million.
[00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:40.940]   But as a result of that, I can't write my spouse a check to say, hey, just forget about
[00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:42.080]   all those years where I neglected you.
[00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:43.640]   Like, we have money now, so let's all get along.
[00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:44.760]   Like, that doesn't work.
[00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:45.920]   You can't do that with your children.
[00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:48.220]   You can't write your cardiovascular system.
[00:39:48.220 --> 00:39:51.280]   You can't ACH your cardiovascular system just to work better, right?
[00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:52.140]   If you're not taking care of your health.
[00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:56.120]   So like, all the problems you're going to have in level five and level six are all the
[00:39:56.120 --> 00:39:56.980]   non-financial things.
[00:39:56.980 --> 00:39:59.980]   That's what's being amplified there is all the non-financial pieces of your life.
[00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:02.460]   Because you can't, money's not going to buy them, right?
[00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:03.600]   And you're like, well, you can buy friends.
[00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:04.380]   It's not like, not really.
[00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:05.660]   You really can't do true friendship.
[00:40:05.660 --> 00:40:06.540]   It doesn't work, right?
[00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:11.480]   So the thing I tell people to focus on, if you're in those levels, they're probably not,
[00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:15.600]   they're probably focusing too much on their money and not enough on everything else in
[00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:16.020]   their life.
[00:40:16.020 --> 00:40:20.220]   So that's the, in the, in the wealth ladder, in the book, I talk about this stuff in level
[00:40:20.220 --> 00:40:24.620]   fives and level six, which is like, hey, focus on all the non-financial pieces because
[00:40:24.620 --> 00:40:26.100]   your financial stuff's good.
[00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:30.220]   Focus on all the other things because I bet you're overlooking at least your health or your
[00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:33.380]   relationships or your friendships or some piece of your life you're overlooking and you
[00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:34.280]   don't even realize it.
[00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:35.200]   Yeah.
[00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:38.760]   When I, when I first started with the book, I was like, oh, you know what?
[00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:42.860]   I feel like Nick needs to go read Sahil's book about the five types of wealth.
[00:40:42.860 --> 00:40:44.860]   You know, that, that was like early thought.
[00:40:44.860 --> 00:40:47.640]   Then I get to the point of the book where you actually referenced the entire thing.
[00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:51.720]   So I'm curious to date, all of the wealth you've talked about on the ladder, moving up the
[00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:53.160]   levels is all financial.
[00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:58.820]   How do you think about other types of wealth, whether it's family or health or anything like
[00:40:58.820 --> 00:40:59.040]   that?
[00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:02.680]   It's very funny because I collaborated with Sahil on his book when he needed help with the
[00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:03.500]   financial wealth piece.
[00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:04.220]   And I was like, you know what?
[00:41:04.220 --> 00:41:05.220]   This is such a great farm work.
[00:41:05.220 --> 00:41:05.760]   I'm going to use this.
[00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:10.560]   And so it's very interesting because all these types of wealth, like they're easy to overlook
[00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:11.900]   because they're not as easy to measure.
[00:41:11.900 --> 00:41:14.520]   Like I can look at my bank balance or I can give you a number of like, hey, here's what's
[00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:15.140]   in my checking account.
[00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:16.100]   Here's my net worth, whatever.
[00:41:16.100 --> 00:41:18.620]   Of course it's approximated, but still like, I can give you a number.
[00:41:18.620 --> 00:41:21.900]   Can I give you an exact measure of my health?
[00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:24.220]   Like I could, I would assume, well, I could tell you my VO2 max.
[00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:25.260]   I could tell you my miles.
[00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:26.600]   I can tell you all this stuff at the end of the day.
[00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:29.880]   Like for all you know, there's something going wrong somewhere else in my body that
[00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:32.400]   I can't even predict that none of these measures are going to pick up.
[00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:36.460]   So at the end of the day, your relationship, you can't with your spouse, with your children,
[00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:37.360]   you can't rate it.
[00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:40.660]   You can, you can come up with a rating, but you don't know like the other person's feelings,
[00:41:40.660 --> 00:41:41.020]   right?
[00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:42.420]   It's harder to measure those things.
[00:41:42.420 --> 00:41:43.380]   So they don't get measured.
[00:41:43.380 --> 00:41:45.820]   So they just kind of, they get overlooked basically.
[00:41:45.820 --> 00:41:49.060]   And so I think that's the big problem with the other types of wealth.
[00:41:49.060 --> 00:41:50.880]   And so I try to bring that back as a focus.
[00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:54.340]   And especially after talking about level five and level six, where it's like, these people
[00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:57.920]   have all this wealth and all this wealth is not going to fix these other problems in their
[00:41:57.920 --> 00:41:58.140]   life.
[00:41:58.140 --> 00:42:02.240]   So it's a good reminder of all the other things that matter in our lives and kind of where
[00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:03.460]   you should be spending your time as well.
[00:42:03.460 --> 00:42:09.500]   I've been fortunate to have a lot of travel in my life, but I've met people all around the
[00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:09.800]   world.
[00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:15.500]   Some of whom are, are very squarely in level one, uh, very happy people.
[00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:20.440]   And when I heard you saying like, Oh, this got you into level five, it almost made it feel
[00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:23.360]   like you've got to climb and climb the ladder.
[00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:30.480]   And I'm wondering how you think about general life happiness and whether we even need to be
[00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:33.860]   climbing or maybe once you get to level two or three, like, is that enough?
[00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:39.040]   Uh, versus kind of thinking of it as something that we need to get to the top of.
[00:42:39.340 --> 00:42:40.260]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:42:40.260 --> 00:42:43.800]   Without a doubt, level four is like, you know, 1 million to 10 million.
[00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:45.620]   If you're in that level, you do not need to keep climbing.
[00:42:45.620 --> 00:42:48.820]   I don't think it, it's going to add much value to your life personally.
[00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:52.780]   However, I can see why people would say, you know what, maybe level three is not enough
[00:42:52.780 --> 00:42:55.060]   because of I spend X dollars.
[00:42:55.060 --> 00:42:57.780]   And even if you have a million dollars, that's not gonna be able to throw off enough income
[00:42:57.780 --> 00:42:59.580]   to support a lifestyle, right?
[00:42:59.580 --> 00:43:00.440]   You know, a certain lifestyle.
[00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:04.400]   So I think it matters like based on your lifestyle, what you value in your life.
[00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:07.320]   Like there's people level two, level one that are very happy, that are happier than
[00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:08.400]   people in level three and level four.
[00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:12.420]   In general, happiness tends to go up with income and wealth, you know, as long as you're
[00:43:12.420 --> 00:43:13.000]   happy already.
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:16.200]   But, um, that's why I said, like, where's enough?
[00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:17.520]   Every person's going to be different.
[00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:19.320]   I think for most people, it's level three and level four.
[00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:19.840]   You'll be fine.
[00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:23.000]   Now, of course, can you get, there's happy people all over the place.
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:26.520]   But, you know, if you don't want to have to worry about money, stresses, all those other
[00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:29.960]   things, I encourage people to get at least out of, you know, level one for sure.
[00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:30.920]   And then go beyond there.
[00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:33.680]   But, um, yeah, I think it's a good question.
[00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:35.540]   And it does depend on a host of things.
[00:43:35.540 --> 00:43:38.400]   You can be much happier, you know, with, with no wealth.
[00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:40.180]   But I'm just saying, I'm showing what the data shows.
[00:43:40.180 --> 00:43:43.740]   The data shows, remember that original study from, you know, Kahneman and Deaton, it was
[00:43:43.740 --> 00:43:47.320]   like, hey, your happiness doesn't increase after $70,000 a year.
[00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:50.100]   Well, and they kind of went through the data and get again and dug through it.
[00:43:50.100 --> 00:43:56.900]   And basically, um, happiness does keep increasing above $70,000 a year in income and with wealth,
[00:43:56.900 --> 00:43:57.320]   et cetera.
[00:43:57.320 --> 00:44:04.200]   They've looked at wealth and at income, but the issue is you have to already be happy, right?
[00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:06.800]   If you're not a happy person, more money is not going to make you happier.
[00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:08.600]   And that's what the original study found.
[00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:11.820]   But if you're happy and you're loving life, I'm telling you more money is going to probably
[00:44:11.820 --> 00:44:12.340]   make you happier.
[00:44:12.340 --> 00:44:13.700]   Does that mean you need to chase it?
[00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:15.880]   No, I don't know why people are saying otherwise.
[00:44:16.060 --> 00:44:17.680]   I just don't want to, you know, mislead people.
[00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:17.920]   Yeah.
[00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:22.540]   And you mentioned, um, the kind of, I don't know, the myth we see on, on the internet of
[00:44:22.540 --> 00:44:26.180]   like all these people that are in their thirties that are millionaires and how the data shows
[00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:27.560]   that's not really true.
[00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:32.440]   Um, what is the kind of timeline to get through these levels?
[00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:37.800]   Like how long does it take to move up and what other kind of myths might exist in society
[00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:41.200]   about, about, you know, where we should be at certain times?
[00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:41.980]   Yeah.
[00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:45.520]   So the, the data is all in, in chapter 10 of the book where I go through a lot of this stuff,
[00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:49.680]   but like the median age for someone in level four, which is 1 million to 10 million is
[00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:50.140]   62.
[00:44:50.140 --> 00:44:51.660]   So it takes time.
[00:44:51.660 --> 00:44:52.940]   It takes decades, right?
[00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:53.660]   For this to happen.
[00:44:53.660 --> 00:44:53.960]   Right.
[00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:58.380]   And I have data in the book, which goes through like all the percentages in terms of, okay,
[00:44:58.380 --> 00:45:02.840]   you know, this percentage of people, um, went up one wealth level within 10 years or 20
[00:45:02.840 --> 00:45:03.000]   years.
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.260]   Basically long story short is like, it just takes time.
[00:45:05.260 --> 00:45:06.260]   There's no way around that.
[00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:06.540]   Right.
[00:45:06.580 --> 00:45:12.720]   So after, after 20 years, uh, 32% of households will have gone up one level.
[00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:14.420]   5% will have gone up two levels.
[00:45:14.420 --> 00:45:19.600]   So wherever you are now, whatever wealth level you're in, you know, within the next 20 years,
[00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:22.020]   there's a 32% chance you'll be up one level.
[00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:24.080]   I mean, all else equal, I have no idea.
[00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:26.360]   This doesn't control for ages across all ages.
[00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:29.240]   There's a 5% chance you'll be up two wealth levels, right?
[00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:30.160]   So it does take time.
[00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:34.260]   And then over a 10 year front timeframe, there's a 20% chance you're up one level.
[00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:36.500]   There's a two and a half percent chance you're up two levels.
[00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:39.080]   So it does happen, but as you can see, it's hard.
[00:45:39.080 --> 00:45:41.180]   And so you can still build wealth and stay in your level.
[00:45:41.180 --> 00:45:42.120]   It's nothing wrong with that.
[00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:45.580]   But just to show that the percentage of households moving up and down levels is,
[00:45:45.580 --> 00:45:47.220]   is not as high as we might've thought.
[00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:48.320]   What about moving down?
[00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:52.700]   Uh, I can't help, but think with two kids about the chutes and ladders analogy.
[00:45:52.700 --> 00:45:55.980]   It's like, you know, yes, you can stay standing.
[00:45:55.980 --> 00:46:00.920]   Yes, you can move up, but do people do things like overspending or make risky investments and
[00:46:00.920 --> 00:46:01.880]   then go down a level?
[00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:03.160]   Oh yeah, it happens.
[00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:04.280]   It's much rarer.
[00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:09.020]   I can give you the date again, over a 10 year period, roughly 11% of households will go
[00:46:09.020 --> 00:46:10.440]   down one level, right?
[00:46:10.580 --> 00:46:12.780]   And then 2% of households will be down two levels.
[00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:14.040]   So it's very rare.
[00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:15.280]   So it's much rare.
[00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:18.700]   It's, there's much more upward mobility than downward mobility, because I think most households
[00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:20.260]   are generally disciplined.
[00:46:20.260 --> 00:46:22.700]   63% of households won't change their level at all.
[00:46:22.700 --> 00:46:28.540]   And then over a 20 year period, only 12% of households will be down a level over 20 years,
[00:46:28.540 --> 00:46:32.560]   whichever level you're in today, there's only a 12% chance you're going to be down any number
[00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:33.620]   of levels from where you are.
[00:46:33.620 --> 00:46:38.560]   So it's unlikely over long periods of time that that happens, but it's something to consider,
[00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:38.780]   right?
[00:46:38.780 --> 00:46:39.740]   And so all the data is in there.
[00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:43.620]   You can look at, and there's even switching matrices where it's like, oh, if you start
[00:46:43.620 --> 00:46:46.680]   at this level, what's the percentage I'm going to be at that level in 10 years or 20,
[00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:46.880]   right?
[00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:49.620]   And so you can start going through all the data and thinking about this stuff.
[00:46:49.620 --> 00:46:52.940]   And I think it's kind of cool to see that because I'm actually following the same households.
[00:46:52.940 --> 00:46:54.420]   I'm not just looking at random households.
[00:46:54.420 --> 00:46:58.780]   I'm like saying, let's look at how households actually built wealth since it's from 1984 to
[00:46:58.780 --> 00:46:59.560]   like 2021.
[00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:02.860]   And so we're kind of just looking through all these 10 year and 20 year periods that are
[00:47:02.860 --> 00:47:03.120]   there.
[00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:06.340]   And we're just saying like, how did they actually build wealth and what percentage of them moved
[00:47:06.340 --> 00:47:06.620]   around?
[00:47:06.620 --> 00:47:10.300]   And it's very fascinating for me to see this data.
[00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:13.540]   If someone really wanted to nerd out, they can download it and play around with it.
[00:47:13.540 --> 00:47:16.940]   It's the it's from the University of Michigan PSID data.
[00:47:16.940 --> 00:47:18.460]   It's not that easy to pull.
[00:47:18.460 --> 00:47:19.720]   It's like a long process.
[00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:22.340]   But if you're interested in doing this, please DM me.
[00:47:22.340 --> 00:47:23.680]   I respond to all my DMs.
[00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:24.740]   I have the whole code base.
[00:47:24.740 --> 00:47:25.460]   It's up on the Internet.
[00:47:25.460 --> 00:47:27.040]   It's free to see with AI.
[00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:30.260]   You can probably get this thing up and running if you even if you've never programmed too much
[00:47:30.260 --> 00:47:30.600]   before.
[00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:34.260]   And you can actually download the data and get all this stuff running and you can play with
[00:47:34.260 --> 00:47:35.880]   it yourself and see what's out there.
[00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:37.900]   That's one of those things where I'm like, oh, that would be fun.
[00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:39.980]   But you've done a pretty good job summarizing it.
[00:47:39.980 --> 00:47:42.340]   So I'm not going to go down that rabbit hole.
[00:47:42.340 --> 00:47:42.720]   Yeah.
[00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:43.640]   And it doesn't need to be perfect.
[00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:45.200]   Like the exact percentages don't matter.
[00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:49.640]   The core idea is there is mobility upward that's generally true, at least in U.S.
[00:47:49.640 --> 00:47:51.380]   society over the period I talked about.
[00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:54.580]   I think that's probably going to be true in the in the future, even though, yes, it's been
[00:47:54.580 --> 00:47:55.600]   a little bit slower recently.
[00:47:55.600 --> 00:48:01.400]   I think Gen Z, millennials, you know, Gen Alpha, all these people like it's been tougher on them
[00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:02.420]   than prior generations.
[00:48:02.420 --> 00:48:06.400]   Like for a host of reasons, I think housing prices is one of those big determinants that's
[00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:07.060]   slowing that down.
[00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:11.600]   But we're going to see this change over time as the as the boomers, you know, pass on and
[00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:14.600]   stuff all that wealth is going to start moving back into the next generation, etc.
[00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:15.120]   I'm hopeful.
[00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:16.220]   I think we just have to wait it out.
[00:48:16.220 --> 00:48:19.500]   I think we just the median home, the first time homebuyer age is going to go up.
[00:48:19.500 --> 00:48:22.480]   Like we're just going to delay what we normally would have done earlier in life.
[00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:22.900]   That's all.
[00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:25.300]   This episode is brought to you by Trust and Will.
[00:48:25.300 --> 00:48:28.340]   It is so easy to overcomplicate simple tasks.
[00:48:28.340 --> 00:48:33.680]   Believe me, I know I love doing so much research, but some things don't always need to be so
[00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:34.460]   overcomplicated.
[00:48:34.460 --> 00:48:38.020]   They end up getting put off forever, like creating a will or trust.
[00:48:38.020 --> 00:48:42.820]   So check out Trust and Will because they make estate planning straightforward and so simple
[00:48:42.820 --> 00:48:44.220]   you can do it from your couch.
[00:48:44.540 --> 00:48:49.180]   Their platform is attorney designed, specific to each state, and most important, customized
[00:48:49.180 --> 00:48:51.000]   by you at every step.
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:55.580]   I can tell you firsthand how great Trust and Will is because we actually used it to set up
[00:48:55.580 --> 00:49:00.060]   our estate plan years ago, long before they were a sponsor, because it was quick, easy,
[00:49:00.060 --> 00:49:02.040]   and way less intimidating than it seems.
[00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:07.020]   In a few guided steps, we had a solid plan in place to protect our family, and we were able
[00:49:07.020 --> 00:49:11.980]   to customize it to match all our nuanced preferences about what happens to our savings, who's going to
[00:49:11.980 --> 00:49:14.240]   be the guardian for our kids, and so much more.
[00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:18.640]   I can't tell you how much peace of mind we have knowing that we got all of this taken
[00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:23.020]   care of, and it was so easy to update online after we had our second child.
[00:49:23.020 --> 00:49:26.480]   So let Trust and Will uncomplicate the process for you.

[00:49:40.080 --> 00:49:46.960]   So I love the .01% rule, but there's also a 1% rule that I hadn't heard, which maybe I thought
[00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:53.060]   was even more impactful as someone who loves a good side hustle, but recently has been trying
[00:49:53.060 --> 00:50:00.300]   to make sure that I don't waste time on business opportunities or work ideas that aren't really
[00:50:00.300 --> 00:50:01.120]   going to have an impact.
[00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:02.060]   Can you talk about that one?
[00:50:02.060 --> 00:50:02.620]   Yeah.
[00:50:02.720 --> 00:50:08.780]   So the 1% rule is just take 1% of your net worth, and that's the amount that should
[00:50:08.780 --> 00:50:11.360]   be the minimum before you consider getting into an opportunity.
[00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:12.900]   So let me do a simple example.
[00:50:12.900 --> 00:50:19.800]   Let's say you're worth $100,000, and someone's like, hey, would you be willing to come speak
[00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:21.200]   at this event for $100?
[00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:22.340]   You're like, no.
[00:50:22.340 --> 00:50:25.780]   Your cutoff should be $1,000, which is 1% of your net worth.
[00:50:25.780 --> 00:50:27.960]   1% of $100,000 is $1,000, right?
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:31.820]   It's like you have to think about income opportunities and how they impact you, and
[00:50:31.820 --> 00:50:34.480]   so whether you're willing to take on that income opportunity.
[00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:39.200]   And of course, obviously, it matters how much time you have to put into the thing, but I just
[00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:42.900]   like using it as a different way to evaluate a new income opportunity, right?
[00:50:42.900 --> 00:50:46.140]   Because a lot of times, people will be thinking about these things, and they'll say, oh, wait,
[00:50:46.140 --> 00:50:46.900]   should I really do this thing?
[00:50:46.900 --> 00:50:48.800]   And it's like, oh, wait, that's actually not going to move the needle at all.
[00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:50.420]   So why am I spending my time on this?
[00:50:50.420 --> 00:50:53.500]   And this is really true more for business owners and entrepreneurs, and people have all these
[00:50:53.500 --> 00:50:56.300]   different things, a lot of hats, a lot of things you're doing, side hustles, things
[00:50:56.300 --> 00:50:56.800]   like that.
[00:50:57.160 --> 00:50:59.960]   I think it's more applicable for those people than it is for others.
[00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:03.080]   And so you're lower on the wealth ladder, you'll say yes to almost everything, right?
[00:51:03.080 --> 00:51:04.620]   Because 1% of your net worth isn't that much money.
[00:51:04.620 --> 00:51:07.180]   But as you go up, you're like, yeah, this isn't really worth my time anymore.
[00:51:07.180 --> 00:51:10.200]   And so you have to really rethink that, because it just doesn't make an impact.
[00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:10.860]   That's the problem.
[00:51:10.860 --> 00:51:11.100]   Yeah.
[00:51:11.100 --> 00:51:14.860]   For some reason, I never thought about it as a percent of net worth, and I always just
[00:51:14.860 --> 00:51:16.980]   kind of equated it to something in my life.
[00:51:16.980 --> 00:51:21.120]   Whereas early on, it was like, oh, is this thing going to make a car payment?
[00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:24.640]   And then it's like, oh, okay, now is this thing going to make a rent payment or a mortgage
[00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:25.020]   payment?
[00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:29.260]   Or maybe you have kids in school, is this going to cover their tuition?
[00:51:29.260 --> 00:51:30.660]   You kind of move up.
[00:51:30.660 --> 00:51:36.480]   And I've always visually thought of it as something, but I never really had a framework for how to
[00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:37.520]   pick that number.
[00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:38.540]   So I don't know.
[00:51:38.540 --> 00:51:39.860]   That was really helpful for me.
[00:51:40.900 --> 00:51:44.760]   Yes, I have a business and we have opportunities where we're like, oh, should we plan trips
[00:51:44.760 --> 00:51:46.460]   and do this travel agency thing?
[00:51:46.460 --> 00:51:47.860]   Well, what kind of impact would that have?
[00:51:47.860 --> 00:51:51.600]   But even when I was working, it's like, oh, here's this side hustle.
[00:51:51.600 --> 00:51:55.640]   I talked about buying and selling gold at Costco, and I did a whole episode on it.
[00:51:55.640 --> 00:51:59.120]   It's like, okay, but how much is this thing actually going to make?
[00:51:59.180 --> 00:52:00.700]   And like, does it move the needle?
[00:52:00.700 --> 00:52:05.900]   Because not only is there time involved, but we have this limited amount of headspace to
[00:52:05.900 --> 00:52:07.440]   kind of be creative and think about things.
[00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:11.680]   And I could spend all my day thinking about flipping gift cards from the grocery store.
[00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:16.660]   But if the overhead that's going to cause and the anxiety of, oh, is there a sale this weekend
[00:52:16.660 --> 00:52:17.040]   at the grocery?
[00:52:17.120 --> 00:52:20.720]   All of those things combined will make me $500 a month.
[00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:23.780]   I should probably take that thing and just shove it to the side.
[00:52:23.780 --> 00:52:28.180]   But 10, 15, 20 years ago, me in college totally would have been all over it.
[00:52:28.180 --> 00:52:28.620]   Yeah.
[00:52:28.620 --> 00:52:29.600]   And that's the main idea.
[00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:32.920]   It's like, you're going to make different decisions about your spending income investments
[00:52:32.920 --> 00:52:34.240]   as you move up the wealth ladder.
[00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:35.500]   It's built into every piece of it.
[00:52:35.500 --> 00:52:37.600]   I try to come up with different rules for each one of these things.
[00:52:37.600 --> 00:52:37.840]   Yeah.
[00:52:37.840 --> 00:52:41.940]   We were talking about travel and how, you know, level four, you've got a million dollars
[00:52:41.940 --> 00:52:42.840]   plus net worth.
[00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:43.840]   You've got travel freedom.
[00:52:44.180 --> 00:52:47.580]   I know people that listen to this show probably want to travel even sooner.
[00:52:47.580 --> 00:52:48.680]   How do you think about that?
[00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:50.360]   And how has that been a part of your journey?
[00:52:50.360 --> 00:52:50.860]   Yeah.
[00:52:50.860 --> 00:52:53.100]   So it's not that you can't travel sooner than that.
[00:52:53.100 --> 00:52:54.200]   It's not the idea at all.
[00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:56.760]   It's a gradual increase in freedom, right?
[00:52:56.760 --> 00:53:03.600]   It's like, because at a million dollars, that marginal spend from the 0.01% rule is a hundred
[00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:04.120]   bucks, right?
[00:53:04.120 --> 00:53:07.960]   So that's not a ton of money, but like, hey, I can get a slightly better seat or I can upgrade
[00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:09.360]   and get a slightly nicer hotel room, right?
[00:53:09.360 --> 00:53:10.040]   Whatever it is, right?
[00:53:10.040 --> 00:53:13.520]   You can start making those types of decisions when you start to get into level four.
[00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:17.140]   But as you get deeper into level four, then you can make bigger and bigger types of travel
[00:53:17.140 --> 00:53:17.540]   decisions.
[00:53:17.540 --> 00:53:19.920]   And so that's the idea behind it.
[00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:22.560]   It's not that like, oh, as soon as you hit a million bucks, now you can do whatever you
[00:53:22.560 --> 00:53:23.020]   want to travel.
[00:53:23.020 --> 00:53:25.360]   No, but it's like over time, you're gonna be able to do that.
[00:53:25.360 --> 00:53:29.320]   And so what I say is like, that's why I think hacks like this matter because I'm in level
[00:53:29.320 --> 00:53:29.620]   four.
[00:53:29.620 --> 00:53:34.520]   So I'm like, hey, travel freedom matters to me, but I need to use these hacks because I don't
[00:53:34.520 --> 00:53:35.720]   have that much travel freedom.
[00:53:35.720 --> 00:53:38.760]   I can't go and upgrade my, uh, my flight anytime I want.
[00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:39.400]   I can't do that.
[00:53:39.420 --> 00:53:40.540]   So I have to use points and all these things.
[00:53:40.540 --> 00:53:43.880]   So a lot of this stuff matters in the context of your level.
[00:53:43.880 --> 00:53:46.160]   Even if you're in level four, you still need to kind of use these things.
[00:53:46.160 --> 00:53:47.020]   I think it's very helpful.
[00:53:47.020 --> 00:53:50.520]   So something to think about, you know, for those that are, that are wanting to travel a lot.
[00:53:50.520 --> 00:53:55.980]   I think that the, the nice thing is that as you're earlier in your journey, you have a
[00:53:55.980 --> 00:53:57.400]   lot more flexibility, right?
[00:53:57.400 --> 00:54:00.780]   We were talking with some friends who have no children and they're like, oh yeah, we could
[00:54:00.780 --> 00:54:01.760]   just take any week off.
[00:54:01.880 --> 00:54:06.360]   You know, they could go anywhere, anytime, no, no regard to school schedules, you know,
[00:54:06.360 --> 00:54:09.140]   three hour red eye, 12 hour layover, it doesn't matter.
[00:54:09.140 --> 00:54:17.240]   Um, and so earlier in your career or your journey or your life, uh, the ability to leverage things
[00:54:17.240 --> 00:54:24.580]   like points and miles where flexibility just gives you a huge, huge leverage on, on what value
[00:54:24.580 --> 00:54:29.100]   you can get, gives you a kind of like shortcut to some of these, these freedoms.
[00:54:29.100 --> 00:54:31.820]   Like, I think you have a lot of travel freedom earlier in your career.
[00:54:31.820 --> 00:54:36.000]   If you, if you play the points game well, and you're flexible that otherwise would have
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:41.200]   cost you, you know, a lot that would be kind of not prudent to spend on.
[00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:42.160]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:45.460]   So that's a very different way of thinking about travel freedom in that sense.
[00:54:45.460 --> 00:54:49.260]   Like you can do more stuff, but like, you're kind of, because you're more flexible, you're,
[00:54:49.260 --> 00:54:53.240]   you know, it's like, you can't go like, you know, I can't take my family to Hawaii during
[00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:53.820]   spring break.
[00:54:53.820 --> 00:54:55.680]   Cause that's when everyone else wants to go to spring break in Hawaii, right?
[00:54:55.680 --> 00:54:58.840]   It's like, that's the type of stuff where like, you don't have that flexibility.
[00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:00.480]   But you can do other things.
[00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:01.620]   So I think there's, you're right.
[00:55:01.620 --> 00:55:02.620]   There's ways around this.
[00:55:02.620 --> 00:55:05.940]   There's ways to hack travel freedom, to have it earlier in, you know, with less wealth.
[00:55:05.940 --> 00:55:08.440]   But it requires a little bit more effort on your part, right?
[00:55:08.440 --> 00:55:11.080]   The whole idea of travel freedom is by the time you get to 10 million, you don't have to
[00:55:11.080 --> 00:55:11.540]   worry about that.
[00:55:11.540 --> 00:55:12.880]   You say, Hey, I want to go here at this time.
[00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:15.360]   You just go, you know, that's the kind of the difference.
[00:55:15.360 --> 00:55:18.460]   You've been on this journey yourself, you know, through some of the levels.
[00:55:19.120 --> 00:55:23.080]   What are some of the big takeaways you've gotten and some of the mindset kind of shifts
[00:55:23.080 --> 00:55:24.860]   you've made as you move through this journey?
[00:55:24.860 --> 00:55:29.780]   So a few things, the first one that I had was like, stop focusing so much on my investments
[00:55:29.780 --> 00:55:31.300]   and focus more on income and career.
[00:55:31.300 --> 00:55:34.620]   And that was, I over obsessed with investments and that's why I'm an investment financial
[00:55:34.620 --> 00:55:35.180]   writer today.
[00:55:35.180 --> 00:55:39.440]   But like at the same time, like I should have been focused a little bit more on my career
[00:55:39.440 --> 00:55:41.740]   in terms of just actual financial dollars I was bringing in.
[00:55:41.740 --> 00:55:41.900]   Right.
[00:55:41.900 --> 00:55:43.300]   And I wasn't looking at that that much.
[00:55:43.300 --> 00:55:46.860]   So that was the first mindset change was to really become income focused.
[00:55:46.860 --> 00:55:49.920]   The other one I think is over time.
[00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:53.360]   It's just, it's how my relationship with money has changed.
[00:55:53.360 --> 00:55:54.860]   I grew up kind of lower middle class.
[00:55:54.860 --> 00:55:57.740]   I would say level two, even though my, my parents declared bankruptcy twice.
[00:55:57.740 --> 00:55:59.740]   It happened within like a 10 year span basically.
[00:55:59.740 --> 00:56:03.880]   And though that's technically level one, like I didn't grow up in level one for all practical
[00:56:03.880 --> 00:56:04.260]   purposes.
[00:56:04.260 --> 00:56:08.140]   So I would say like, I grew up in level two, I've lived that lifestyle and then kind of going
[00:56:08.140 --> 00:56:11.880]   to level three and level four and just seeing those changes and kind of understanding
[00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:15.120]   like how different people like, you know, view money.
[00:56:15.120 --> 00:56:19.220]   And it's just interesting to me to kind of, to, to witness that personally, but then also
[00:56:19.220 --> 00:56:22.840]   like how it's, it's been able to transform my life and my relationship with my family.
[00:56:22.840 --> 00:56:25.380]   Like my sister, her car broke down and she was like, Oh my gosh, what am I gonna do?
[00:56:25.380 --> 00:56:27.660]   I'm like, you know, I was like, Kelly, I'll just write you a check.
[00:56:27.660 --> 00:56:28.060]   It's all good.
[00:56:28.060 --> 00:56:28.960]   I'm very fortunate.
[00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:29.680]   I'm able to do it.
[00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:30.860]   Not everyone's able to do that.
[00:56:30.860 --> 00:56:34.980]   And so that's the big thing that I've seen change is like how my relationship with money
[00:56:34.980 --> 00:56:37.640]   and it's a tool for a lot of things that can help people.
[00:56:37.640 --> 00:56:40.620]   And I think that, you know, getting that first thing out of level one into level two is
[00:56:40.620 --> 00:56:42.540]   the biggest mindset shift you can have.
[00:56:42.540 --> 00:56:46.280]   And so just, and building on that is what's important.
[00:56:46.280 --> 00:56:50.940]   If you had to zoom out a little bit and think, what do you think someone who, who kind of
[00:56:50.940 --> 00:56:55.660]   understands the ladder and understands how to get through it and the risk associated, how
[00:56:55.660 --> 00:56:59.360]   do you think that really impacts their life and their journey?
[00:56:59.940 --> 00:57:04.440]   I think you can make much better decisions on how to prioritize your time and what you're
[00:57:04.440 --> 00:57:05.960]   going to do at different stages.
[00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:10.080]   And I think if you don't understand the ladder, you're just going to keep trying to maximize
[00:57:10.080 --> 00:57:10.440]   wealth.
[00:57:10.440 --> 00:57:11.520]   You're going to keep moving through it.
[00:57:11.520 --> 00:57:15.300]   And if you understand it, you can understand what the trade-offs are and what's needed to
[00:57:15.300 --> 00:57:16.120]   get to the next level.
[00:57:16.120 --> 00:57:19.100]   And like the sacrifices and all those different things.
[00:57:19.320 --> 00:57:22.700]   I think you can make much better decisions about what do I want to do with my time?
[00:57:22.700 --> 00:57:27.300]   How do I want to spend my time with who, you know, at what frequency, et cetera.
[00:57:27.500 --> 00:57:31.580]   I think those are the types of decisions that really impact your life because you can start
[00:57:31.580 --> 00:57:32.340]   going down a path.
[00:57:32.340 --> 00:57:35.860]   And once you realize that, so I talked a little bit about the level four stuff, it's because
[00:57:35.860 --> 00:57:36.960]   most people are going to get stuck in there.
[00:57:36.960 --> 00:57:37.680]   They'll never get out.
[00:57:37.680 --> 00:57:41.180]   And you're spending all this time, you know, running on the hamster wheel and you're never
[00:57:41.180 --> 00:57:43.280]   going to get out and it doesn't really impact your wealth that much anymore.
[00:57:43.280 --> 00:57:44.700]   And you're working so hard for what?
[00:57:44.700 --> 00:57:46.580]   And I don't understand why people do it.
[00:57:46.580 --> 00:57:51.700]   And so I think that's kind of the big mindset shift is like realizing like, okay, once you understand
[00:57:51.700 --> 00:57:56.300]   the ladder and all the decisions behind it, you can make much better decisions on how you
[00:57:56.300 --> 00:57:58.060]   use your time and what you do with your life.
[00:57:58.060 --> 00:57:58.380]   Okay.
[00:57:58.380 --> 00:57:59.600]   So the book's out.
[00:57:59.600 --> 00:58:01.620]   Where can people find it?
[00:58:01.620 --> 00:58:03.280]   Where can people find everything you're working on?
[00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:05.020]   So the book can be found everywhere.
[00:58:05.020 --> 00:58:05.860]   Books are sold.
[00:58:05.860 --> 00:58:08.500]   All my stuff I'm working on is going to be at ofdollarsanddata.com.
