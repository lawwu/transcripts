[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.100]   This spring during the quarantine,
[00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.940]   my youngest son and I have taken up a new hobby.
[00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.980]   We go outside in the dark to the backyard,
[00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:13.980]   we lay down and we stare straight up
[00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.500]   into the clear, dark Arizona sky
[00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.500]   to behold the dazzling stars.
[00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.420]   The more our eyes adjust, the more stars we begin to see,
[00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.220]   but about the only stars visible to us at night
[00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.440]   are the big boys, the stars that are mostly brighter
[00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.460]   and larger than our own sun.
[00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.780]   I love to hear the awe in my son's voice
[00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.540]   as I recite to him the stats on what we're looking at,
[00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.040]   the size and the distance of each visible star.
[00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.220]   He still finds it hard to believe that anything
[00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.680]   can be larger or brighter than the hot sun over Arizona,
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.700]   but in these moments we hear,
[00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.600]   we hear the voice of the creator.
[00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.460]   In the sky, God speaks to us, kinda.
[00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.740]   Here's Pastor John in a 1990 sermon on Psalm 19
[00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.660]   to explain what we hear.
[00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.060]   - What you see when you look up outdoors,
[00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:10.940]   speaks, it tells, it proclaims.
[00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.220]   You see those verbs?
[00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.980]   But here's the verb I like best in verse two.
[00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.180]   Day unto day, what is it?
[00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.580]   Pours forth speech.
[00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.000]   Now I looked that verb up in Hebrew just to check it out,
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.540]   and it is a very exciting word.
[00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.540]   It means gush forth, spew out knowledge and speech.
[00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.940]   So fix this truth very firmly in your minds.
[00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.780]   Every time the sun rises,
[00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.420]   or every time the stars come up,
[00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.860]   or every time the thunder rolls and the lightning strikes,
[00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.820]   every time there is a lavender, gold, yellow,
[00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.580]   sunrise or sunset,
[00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.580]   God is gushing forth speech to you.
[00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.420]   And He means for you to hear it.
[00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.180]   And He means for you to be ministered to by it.
[00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.420]   He means for you to be helped by it.
[00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.020]   Do you believe God speaks in vain?
[00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.900]   Do you believe God speaks without love?
[00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.260]   Do you believe He just rambles on
[00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.900]   with no purpose like some people do?
[00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.260]   No!
[00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.660]   Whenever God speaks,
[00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.660]   every word is designed for your good.
[00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.740]   And so the second point is simply,
[00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.900]   when you look up, God is speaking to you.
[00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.820]   And we need to learn to hear Him.
[00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.740]   We need to learn to interpret
[00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.060]   and be helped by what He's saying.
[00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.620]   The message comes without words,
[00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.180]   without speech,
[00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.900]   without voice.
[00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.620]   Now, this is difficult,
[00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.580]   because most of us are so word-dependent -
[00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.020]   I am -
[00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.460]   that thinking of something coming
[00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:11.180]   from God's heart to my heart,
[00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.700]   minus words, is very difficult.
[00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.540]   That's what's happening when you look up.
[00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.460]   Something is being communicated
[00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:21.620]   from God's mind and heart
[00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.260]   to your mind and heart
[00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.020]   without any vehicle of language.
[00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:32.020]   No reasonings, no arguments, no words.
[00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.260]   Now, you can tell how hard this is
[00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.460]   because David has to use paradox
[00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:38.980]   to get it across.
[00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.740]   Look at the paradox between verses 2 and 3.
[00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:47.460]   Verse 2 says, "Day to day pours forth speech."
[00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:48.860]   Then look at verse 3.
[00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.300]   "There is no speech."
[00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:53.580]   Now, you talk like that.
[00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.620]   That's the same Hebrew word, by the way.
[00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.820]   There's no different word there, no fancy meaning.
[00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.700]   Same thing in English that it is in Hebrew.
[00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.860]   Speech is being poured forth.
[00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.420]   "There is no speech."
[00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.260]   You get it?
[00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.540]   It's not easy to get.
[00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.340]   We're not good at it.
[00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:12.900]   I'm not good at it.
[00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.620]   Getting messages from God
[00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.380]   not through words,
[00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.860]   but through light, color, shape,
[00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:30.420]   contrast, proportion, design, magnitude,
[00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:32.940]   and a lot of other things I'm sure I can't think of
[00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.220]   that make up what the eye inhales
[00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.020]   when it looks up.
[00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.340]   God is communicating without words,
[00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.220]   without voice, without speech.
[00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.900]   And yet, verse 4 goes right back to verse 2
[00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.700]   and says, "Yet their line..."
[00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:53.980]   That may be written line,
[00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.900]   may be plumb line, sound, voice.
[00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.660]   There's a lot of uncertainty about what that word means,
[00:04:58.660 --> 00:04:59.700]   but we get the idea.
[00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:02.220]   "Their line goes out through all the earth,
[00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:03.420]   and their words..."
[00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:05.380]   There it is. Hey, I thought there were no words.
[00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.060]   Well, there aren't, but there are.
[00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.180]   "...words to the end of the world."
[00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.580]   Wordless words, speechless speech, voiceless voice.
[00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.900]   From God's heart to your heart
[00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.380]   to minister healing and wholeness
[00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.900]   and happiness and humility and hope.
[00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:25.460]   Are you good at it?
[00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:26.980]   Do you get it?
[00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:29.620]   Or are you too busy even to look up?
[00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.980]   And listen, the message that comes without words
[00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:39.060]   through the sky is about God.
[00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:41.260]   Day and night, everywhere in the world,
[00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.860]   God is speaking about God.
[00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:46.780]   You see it in verse 1.
[00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:53.140]   "The heavens are telling the glory of God."
[00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:56.260]   We are not New Age pantheists.
[00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.060]   In the beginning,
[00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:04.100]   God, who always was without nature,
[00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:09.260]   full and complete in His triune happiness,
[00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:13.660]   said, "Let there be nature."
[00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:14.860]   And there was nature.
[00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:18.060]   And it is not God.
[00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:21.180]   We are not pantheists.
[00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.780]   We believe in God Almighty,
[00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:28.220]   the Maker of heaven and earth.
[00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:30.980]   We are light years away
[00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:35.020]   from the kind of being
[00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:38.060]   that the New Age puts forth,
[00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:42.660]   calling all God.
[00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:46.100]   There were mornings on the study leave,
[00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:48.180]   the cottage was at the bottom of the hill
[00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:51.980]   and about 20 or 30 yards into the woods
[00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:53.660]   was this little trailer
[00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:55.100]   where I sat most of the days
[00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:58.380]   working on this book that I was working on.
[00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:01.340]   And mornings I would walk
[00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:04.700]   and I would just stop about halfway in the woods.
[00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:07.380]   And I would look down through the pine trees,
[00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:09.620]   probably 80 or 100 years old,
[00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:12.500]   to the little four-acre lake that's down there
[00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:15.020]   and I would see the sun spangled
[00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:17.140]   with those diamonds dancing across the water.
[00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:19.500]   You know how it does on the lake in the morning.
[00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:21.380]   And then I would begin to look up.
[00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:22.380]   It's about nine.
[00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:23.780]   The sun is about at this angle,
[00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:25.380]   just blazing through
[00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:27.500]   and there's the shield of hickory and oak
[00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:29.380]   and sweet gum and maple leaves
[00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:31.220]   all doing like this in the breeze.
[00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:34.340]   And they're all yellow-green and gold.
[00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:35.660]   And then I looked on up
[00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:38.540]   and there was the big, broad, expansive blue
[00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:41.180]   and the cool morning breeze was hitting me in the face
[00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:42.820]   and all I could do was say,
[00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:47.180]   "Glory, glory, glory."
[00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:50.620]   And I didn't reason it out either.
[00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:52.460]   I didn't lecture myself.
[00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:54.020]   It was just there.
[00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:55.380]   It's just there.
[00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:58.580]   When you open your eyes to see what God has done,
[00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:01.380]   you see glory.
[00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:03.740]   The glory of God is not something
[00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:07.500]   that can be transferred merely by words.
[00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:12.420]   It is transferred by words in the Gospel,
[00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:14.980]   by gifts and fruits of the Holy Spirit,
[00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:16.940]   by the Scriptures and by the skies,
[00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:19.500]   but it is only being transferred.
[00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:22.660]   The glory of God is always something more than sky.
[00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:24.940]   It's always something more than Scripture.
[00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:26.900]   It's always something more than gifts
[00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:28.900]   and fruit of the Holy Spirit.
[00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:33.500]   The glory of God is tasted by spiritual perception within.
[00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:38.700]   It is perceived by the gift of God's revelation.
[00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:41.100]   It is an awesome thing to behold
[00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:44.420]   the glory of God in the sky.
[00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:46.380]   - This excerpt was taken from John Piper's sermon
[00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:49.060]   on August 26, 1990, titled,
[00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:52.460]   Do You See the Joy of God in the Sun?
[00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:55.900]   And you can find the whole thing at DesiringGod.org.
[00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:56.820]   And thanks for listening.

[00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:17.980]   Next time we take up another important Bible question,
[00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:21.460]   which characters in Job can we trust?
[00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:24.260]   Most of the book's characters say things we can't trust.
[00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:28.020]   So it's a very important question up next on Friday.
[00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:30.020]   I'm Tony Reinke, and we'll see you then.
