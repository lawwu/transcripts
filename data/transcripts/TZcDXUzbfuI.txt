[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.720]   It's Monday morning, February 3rd, and we're getting ready to kick off the 2014 Conference
[00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.160]   for Pastors at the Minneapolis Convention Center this afternoon.
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.240]   And your prayers are greatly appreciated for the conference and for Pastor John and Sinclair
[00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.640]   Ferguson and Michael Horton and for all the pastors that will be in town.
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.320]   And your questions keep coming in, so we keep going.
[00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.480]   Today's question is from Katie Elias, who listens in from Canada.
[00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.020]   She writes, "Pastor John, I recently read your blog post about embracing weakness as
[00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.240]   a means to show God's strength.
[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.280]   How can I discern between a weakness that needs accepting and a besetting sin that needs
[00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.480]   eradicating?
[00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.160]   How do I know if I'm making an excuse for a besetting sin by saying it's just a natural
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.160]   weakness?"
[00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.480]   Oh my, that is such a good, penetrating question.
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.000]   It calls for...
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:59.140]   The only way I know how to make those really difficult distinctions in our souls, our motivations,
[00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.380]   is the revealed Word of God.
[00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:07.860]   And isn't it remarkable how Hebrews says that in relation to making distinctions?
[00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:15.140]   Because it says in Hebrews 4.12, "The Word of God is living and active, sharper than
[00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:22.180]   a two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and spirit, joints and marrow, and
[00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.780]   discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart."
[00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.460]   Isn't that exactly what she's asking about?
[00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.900]   How can I discern my thoughts?
[00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.140]   How can I discern my intentions?
[00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:43.660]   And I would say the summary answer is, let's immerse ourselves in the Word.
[00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:53.180]   And let the Word permeate us like a bath of swords, penetrating and separating weakness
[00:01:53.180 --> 00:02:00.740]   from sin, so that we don't deceive ourselves and justify our behaviors or our attitudes
[00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.140]   that are sinful by calling them mere weaknesses.
[00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:11.900]   But here, the reason I appreciate this question so much is it causes me to go a little deeper.
[00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.100]   Here's the painful reality.
[00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:21.100]   Our sins typically worm their way into our weaknesses.
[00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:27.940]   One of the reasons weaknesses are called weaknesses, I think, is that they're so vulnerable as
[00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.180]   places where sin can insinuate itself.
[00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:38.180]   So people often say, for example, "Our greatest strengths are part of our greatest weaknesses."
[00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.620]   And when they say that, I think they're getting at the same thing.
[00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:50.940]   For example, you, let's just say John Piper, may be prone to see in every circumstance
[00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.820]   something that needs changing.
[00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:01.620]   You may be the kind of person who almost never sees anything that needs changing.
[00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:08.020]   Those two opposite weaknesses, I would say, or you could say strengths, maybe.
[00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:15.860]   But both of those weaknesses are spring-loaded to be infected by sin at any second.
[00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:22.180]   The first one is almost certainly going to be infected with a critical spirit that is
[00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:29.020]   short on patience, lacking in mercy, lacking in tenderheartedness, all in the name of,
[00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.520]   "Well, there are things here that need to be changed," you know.
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:39.320]   The second one is almost certain to be infected with carelessness and failure to take sin
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:45.480]   seriously and lack of boldness to confront people when there are changes that need to
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.520]   be made.
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:56.320]   And disentangling the sin from the weakness in these is a lifelong challenge and possible,
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:05.360]   I think, only by the work of the Holy Spirit using this amazing, sharp Word of God.
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:12.440]   So how does God's Word about Christ being glorified in our weaknesses, 2 Corinthians
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:17.160]   12, 9, how does that apply to these complex cases?
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:23.320]   And I would say not by saying with a false teacher in Romans 6, "Well, let's continue
[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:29.560]   in sin that grace may abound," because if grace abounds in my weakness, then my weakness
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:35.320]   is vulnerable to this kind of sin, and God can even net glory from showing grace to my
[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:40.760]   sin, well, let's just not worry about this and go on and let the sin be because God gets
[00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.920]   grace from overcoming or overlooking my sin.
[00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.600]   Well, that would be exactly the opposite of what Paul said there.
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:54.720]   And if we believe that Christ will be magnified in overriding our sins, which I do, I must
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:02.600]   never ever exploit that mercy of God by saying, "Well, let's let some sin go because then
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.440]   he'll have more to override."
[00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:05.440]   No.
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:06.680]   No, here's what we do.
[00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.480]   We pray earnestly for humility and discernment.
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:15.840]   We make war on the sinful entanglements of our weaknesses.
[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:23.040]   We don't make excuses and turn God into a guilty party in our failure, and we repent.
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:28.720]   We turn away from every sinful failure, even if we have to do it every day, and we ask
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:35.640]   the Lord Jesus to purify our weaknesses and turn them for the glory of his name.
[00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:36.640]   Yes, very good.
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:37.640]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:41.000]   And speaking of the pastor's conference, which begins in a couple of hours for us, you can
