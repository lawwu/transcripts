[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120]   there is this weird thing about inflation,
[00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.060]   which is inflation expectations,
[00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.380]   what people think inflation is gonna do,
[00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:11.140]   has a huge effect on what inflation actually does, right?
[00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:14.740]   And for a long time, a sort of bizarrely long time,
[00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:15.740]   we lived in this world
[00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.940]   where we had persistently really low inflation, right?
[00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.280]   After the financial crisis through the aughts
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.820]   into the teens, whereby like 2019,
[00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.480]   we were in this world where unemployment was super low,
[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.700]   the economy was doing well,
[00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.260]   the government was borrowing tons of money,
[00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.100]   and all of those things
[00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.380]   you would think would give you higher inflation, right?
[00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.980]   That classically is a really inflationary environment
[00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.380]   and we didn't see it.
[00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.420]   And part of the reason it seems,
[00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:41.620]   it's a mystery why we didn't see it,
[00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.500]   but part of the reason it seems
[00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.580]   is because people expected it would stay low.
[00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.100]   So now, what do people think?
[00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.140]   I mean, you can look at the markets,
[00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.980]   you can look at various financial markets
[00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.580]   and people don't think inflation's gonna stay at 8%
[00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:55.500]   for like five years.
[00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.380]   So I'm hoping people's expectations
[00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:58.780]   are still kind of moderate.
