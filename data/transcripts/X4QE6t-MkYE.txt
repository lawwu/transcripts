[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.280]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.340]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.200]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.540]   Today, my guest is Dr. Nolan Williams.
[00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.600]   Dr. Williams is a medical doctor
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.280]   and professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.640]   at Stanford University School of Medicine.
[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.960]   His laboratory and clinic focus on depression
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.880]   and other mood disorders.
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.560]   They focus specifically on the use
[00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.880]   of transcranial magnetic stimulation,
[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.060]   which is a brain stimulation technique
[00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.620]   that can either activate or quiet specific brain circuits,
[00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.540]   as well as circuits within the body,
[00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.920]   in order to treat depression and other mood disorders.
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.560]   Other laboratories and clinics use TMS.
[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.400]   What sets apart the work of Nolan Williams and colleagues
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.440]   is that they combine TMS with other treatments.
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.560]   And some of those treatments are among the more cutting edge
[00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.160]   that you've probably heard about these days,
[00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.160]   including Ibogaine, psilocybin, MDMA, cannabis, DMT,
[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.320]   and other drugs that at this point in time
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.240]   are experimental in terms of clinical trials,
[00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.440]   but that at least the preliminary data show
[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.740]   hold great promise for the treatment of depression
[00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.220]   and other mood disorders.
[00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.400]   In the course of my discussion with Dr. Williams,
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.640]   we covered things such as the history
[00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.200]   of each of these drugs,
[00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.320]   how they came to be and their current status
[00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.840]   in terms of their clinical use and legality.
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.760]   We also talk about their safety profiles,
[00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.100]   both in children and in adults.
[00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.720]   And we talk about what the future of psychedelic research
[00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.400]   and clinical use really looks like.
[00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.460]   For instance, we discuss how a number of laboratories
[00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.720]   and clinics are modifying psychedelics
[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.340]   to remove some of their hallucinogenic properties
[00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.400]   while maintaining some of their antidepressant
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.200]   or anti-trauma properties.
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.020]   You'll also learn about some fascinating research
[00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.340]   in Dr. Williams' laboratory focused on ketamine,
[00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.700]   which is a drug that is increasingly being used
[00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:53.880]   to treat depression.
[00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.640]   And contrary to common belief,
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.760]   the effects of ketamine in terms of relieving depression
[00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.200]   may not actually arise from its dissociative effects.
[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.080]   One thing that you'll find extraordinary about Dr. Williams
[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.040]   is that not only does he have vast knowledge
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.040]   of the various treatments for depression,
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:10.940]   but that he and his laboratory
[00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.480]   are really combining these treatments
[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.560]   in the most potent way.
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.320]   That is combining psychedelic treatments
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.720]   with brain-machine interface
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.200]   or combining brain-machine interface
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.060]   with particular learning protocols,
[00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.240]   that is neuroplasticity protocols,
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.020]   which can directly change the brain in specific ways.
[00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.640]   So today you're going to learn a tremendous amount
[00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.880]   about the neural circuitry underlying depression,
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.300]   as well as positive moods.
[00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.040]   You'll also learn about all the various drugs
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.080]   that I described,
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.520]   and you're really going to learn about the current status
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.060]   and future of the treatment of mood disorders.
[00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.540]   Today, you'll also learn about a number of ongoing studies
[00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.400]   in Dr. Williams' laboratory.
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.380]   I should mention that they are recruiting subjects
[00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:46.620]   for these studies.
[00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:47.940]   If you go to BSL,
[00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.800]   which stands for Brain Stimulation Laboratory,
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.280]   so that's bsl.stanford.edu,
[00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.100]   you have the opportunity to apply
[00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.400]   for one of these clinical trials
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.200]   for the treatment of depression and other mood disorders.
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.300]   I confess that the conversation with Dr. Williams
[00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.600]   was, for me, one of the more stimulating
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.200]   and informative conversations I've ever had
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.500]   about psychedelics,
[00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.860]   which is simply to say that his breadth
[00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.360]   and depth of knowledge on that topic is incredible,
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.900]   and his breadth and depth of knowledge
[00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.640]   in terms of the underlying brain science
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.940]   and how it can all be combined with clinical applications
[00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.480]   is also extraordinary.
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.180]   I'm sure that by the end of today's episode,
[00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.160]   you're going to come away with a tremendous amount
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.380]   of knowledge about the clinical
[00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.580]   and nonclinical uses of those substances,
[00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.660]   and you're going to understand a lot more
[00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.180]   about how the healthy and diseased brain work.
[00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.160]   I'm pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.980]   has now launched a premium channel.
[00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.220]   I want to be very clear that the Huberman Lab Podcast
[00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.540]   will continue to be released every Monday
[00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.400]   at zero cost to consumer,
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.660]   and there will be no change in the format of these podcasts.
[00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.260]   The premium channel is a response
[00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.420]   to the many questions we get about specific topics,
[00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.420]   and it will allow me to really drill deep
[00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.740]   into specific answers related to those topics.
[00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:57.060]   So once a month, I'm going to host an Ask Me Anything,
[00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.540]   so-called AMA,
[00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.760]   where you can ask me anything about specific topics
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.140]   covered on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:03.960]   and I will answer those questions.
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.240]   Those, of course, will be recorded.
[00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.260]   There will also be other premium content
[00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.060]   available to premium subscribers,
[00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.680]   such as transcripts and short videos of new tools
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.980]   and unique tools for mental health,
[00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:15.880]   physical health, and performance.
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.460]   If you want to check out the premium channel,
[00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:20.080]   you can go to HubermanLab.com/premium.
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.580]   There's a $10 a month charge or $100 per year,
[00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.100]   and I should mention that a large portion of the proceeds
[00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:26.780]   from the Huberman Lab premium channel
[00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.980]   will go to support scientific research
[00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.400]   that develops the very sorts of tools
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.380]   that we talk about on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:35.320]   The rest of the support
[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.120]   from the Huberman Lab Podcast premium channel
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.700]   will go to supporting the regular Huberman Lab Podcast.
[00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.180]   Again, that's HubermanLab.com/premium.
[00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.660]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.440]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.600]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.140]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:54.720]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:55.780]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.540]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:00.900]   Our first sponsor is InsideTracker.
[00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.300]   InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.840]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.380]   to help you better understand your body
[00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.460]   and help you reach your health goals.
[00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.120]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.440]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.580]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.240]   can only be analyzed with a quality blood test.
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.340]   One problem with a lot of DNA tests and blood tests, however,
[00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.780]   is you get data back about levels of metabolic factors,
[00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.420]   levels of hormones, et cetera,
[00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:29.300]   but you don't know what to do with that information.
[00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:30.980]   InsideTracker makes interpreting your data
[00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:34.200]   and knowing what to do about it exceedingly easy.
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.340]   They have a personalized platform where you can go
[00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.020]   and you can see those levels of hormones,
[00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:39.860]   metabolic factors, lipids, et cetera,
[00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:42.260]   and they point to specific nutritional tools,
[00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.260]   behavioral tools, supplement-based tools, et cetera,
[00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:46.540]   that can help you bring those numbers
[00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:48.780]   into the ranges that are optimal for you.
[00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.200]   If you'd like to try InsideTracker,
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.100]   you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman
[00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.920]   to get 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans.
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:00.240]   Again, that's insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off.
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.900]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep.
[00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:04.560]   Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:07.620]   with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.
[00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:09.780]   I started sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover
[00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:12.580]   a few months ago, and it is simply incredible.
[00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.360]   In fact, I don't even like traveling anymore
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.860]   because they don't have Eight Sleep mattress covers
[00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:18.620]   in hotels and Airbnbs.
[00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:20.660]   One of the reasons I love my Eight Sleep mattress cover
[00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:23.140]   so much is that, as you may have heard before
[00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:24.660]   on this podcast or elsewhere,
[00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:26.940]   in order to fall and stay deeply asleep,
[00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:28.480]   you need your body temperature to drop
[00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.100]   by about one to three degrees.
[00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:32.100]   And I tend to run warm at night,
[00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:33.200]   which makes it hard to sleep
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.200]   and sometimes wakes me up in the middle of the night.
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:36.840]   When you sleep on an Eight Sleep mattress cover,
[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.460]   you can program the temperature of that mattress cover
[00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:41.700]   for specific times in the early, middle,
[00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:44.780]   and late part of your night so that the mattress stays cool.
[00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:47.480]   And as a consequence, you sleep very, very deeply.
[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.160]   It also tracks your sleep.
[00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.480]   So it's paying attention to how many times you're moving,
[00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.740]   how deep your sleep is, it gives you a sleep score,
[00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:55.900]   all wonderful data to help you enhance your sleep.
[00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:58.340]   And of course, sleep is the foundation of mental health,
[00:06:58.340 --> 00:06:59.900]   physical health, and performance,
[00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:02.620]   which makes an Eight Sleep a terrific tool for enhancing
[00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:05.680]   not just your sleep, but all aspects of your life, really.
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:07.480]   If you're interested in trying the Eight Sleep mattress
[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:10.260]   cover, you can go to eightsleep.com/huberman
[00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:11.740]   to check out the Pod 3 cover,

[00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:17.040]   Eight Sleep currently ships to the USA, to Canada,
[00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:20.020]   the UK, and select countries in the EU, and Australia.
[00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:22.460]   Again, that's eightsleep.com/huberman

[00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:27.260]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Roca.
[00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.220]   Roca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:31.540]   that are of the absolute highest quality.
[00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:33.580]   The company was founded by two all-American swimmers
[00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:36.100]   from Stanford, and everything about Roca eyeglasses
[00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:39.180]   and sunglasses were designed with performance in mind.
[00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:41.260]   I've spent a lifetime working on the visual system,
[00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.380]   and I can tell you that your visual system has to contend
[00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:45.180]   with some pretty significant challenges
[00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:47.080]   in order to be able to see clearly
[00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:48.640]   as you move from one area to the next.
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:50.200]   For instance, when you go from a shady area
[00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:51.620]   to a bright area.
[00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:54.040]   Roca understands this and have designed their sunglasses
[00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:55.360]   and eyeglasses accordingly,
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:57.520]   so you always see with crystal clarity.
[00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:59.360]   In addition, because they were initially designed
[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:01.680]   for performance, things like running and biking,
[00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.080]   they're extremely lightweight,
[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:04.640]   but they have a terrific aesthetic.
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:06.760]   So unlike a lot of eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:08.140]   that were designed for sports
[00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:09.480]   and make you look like a cyborg,
[00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:11.460]   they have styles that make you look like a cyborg
[00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:13.400]   if you like those, but they also have styles
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:15.560]   that you'd be perfectly comfortable wearing to work
[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:16.840]   or out to dinner, et cetera.
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:17.920]   They're really terrific glasses.
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:20.600]   I love mine because I can wear them anywhere,
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.440]   and I also use them when running
[00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:24.140]   and going out hiking, et cetera.
[00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:26.400]   If you'd like to try Roca eyeglasses or sunglasses,
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:29.040]   you can go to Roca, that's R-O-K-A.com,

[00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:39.200]   On many episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.740]   we talk about supplements.
[00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:42.880]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:45.400]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them.
[00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:48.040]   Things like enhancing sleep and the depth of sleep,
[00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:50.760]   or for enhancing focus and cognitive ability,
[00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:54.040]   or for enhancing energy or adjusting hormone levels
[00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:55.600]   to optimal range for you.
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.360]   The Huberman Lab Podcast is now partnered
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:58.580]   with Momentous Supplements.
[00:08:58.580 --> 00:08:59.900]   To find the supplements we discuss
[00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:01.120]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:03.760]   you can go to Live Momentous, spelled O-U-S,
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:06.320]   livemomentous.com/huberman.
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:07.700]   And I should just mention that the library
[00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:09.880]   of those supplements is constantly expanding.
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:13.000]   Again, that's livemomentous.com/huberman.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.080]   And now for my discussion with Dr. Nolan Williams.
[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:17.600]   Thanks for joining today.
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:20.060]   I'm really excited to have this conversation.
[00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:21.840]   It's been a long time coming,
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:25.960]   and I have a lot of questions about different compounds,
[00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:27.720]   psychedelics in particular.
[00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:30.120]   But before we get into that discussion,
[00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:34.120]   I want to ask you about depression, broadly speaking,
[00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:39.120]   intractable depression, how common depression is or isn't.
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:43.240]   I heard you say in a wonderful talk that you gave
[00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:45.360]   that depression is perhaps
[00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:49.040]   the most debilitating condition worldwide.
[00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:54.040]   And yet in contrast to other medical conditions like cancer,
[00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:57.240]   we actually have a fairly limited number of tools
[00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:00.920]   to approach depression, and yet number of tools
[00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:03.200]   and the potency of those tools is growing.
[00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:05.160]   So if you could educate us on depression,
[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:06.320]   I would really appreciate it.
[00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:07.160]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:09.560]   Depression is a condition that
[00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:14.240]   it has a lot of manifestations.
[00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:16.620]   So you can have kind of a depression
[00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:18.500]   that's primarily loss of interest.
[00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:21.320]   You can have folks who feel very anxious
[00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:22.620]   and they're kind of overactive.
[00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:25.280]   You can have people who don't have any anxiety at all,
[00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:26.400]   and they're very underactive
[00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:29.000]   and they have low motivation to do anything.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.920]   So you have this huge range of symptoms
[00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:33.480]   that are in that umbrella of depression.
[00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:35.480]   And some of our work is to actually work
[00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:37.920]   with folks like Connor Liston and Cornell
[00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:42.280]   and try to actually get biotypes based off of neuroimaging
[00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:44.040]   to see if we can kind of parse out
[00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:47.680]   the different depression kind of presentations
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:51.220]   and see that clinically and also see that in the brain.
[00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:55.400]   Depression is the most disabling condition worldwide.
[00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:56.800]   What's interesting about depression
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:00.920]   is it's both a risk factor for other illnesses
[00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:02.580]   and it makes other medical
[00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:04.640]   and psychiatric illnesses worse, right?
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:08.020]   So recently the American Heart Association
[00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:11.400]   added depression as the fourth major risk factor
[00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:13.160]   for coronary artery disease, right?
[00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:16.560]   So alongside the risk factors that we know,
[00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:19.520]   hypertension, high blood pressure, hyperlipidemia,
[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:24.100]   high cholesterol, and diabetes, high blood sugar,
[00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:26.820]   those three have been on the list for a long time
[00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:29.200]   and depression ended up being added to the list
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:30.580]   as the fourth one.
[00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:33.040]   And really interesting, right?
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:35.640]   So in addition to taking medications
[00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:37.640]   to address those other three risk factors,
[00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:40.000]   we really have to be thinking about
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.980]   how do you treat folks with depression
[00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:45.720]   to reduce the risk of having a heart attack in the future.
[00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:48.700]   And some of that's being worked on now,
[00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:50.480]   but we don't have a complete solution
[00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:52.880]   to thinking about that at this time.
[00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:54.880]   And then the other thing that's interesting
[00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:57.280]   is once you have a heart attack
[00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:00.640]   and in the individuals that end up having a heart attack,
[00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:04.060]   the risk of having depression after the heart attack
[00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:07.080]   is higher than the normal population, right?
[00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:09.960]   And so a lot of what we're doing in the lab actually
[00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:13.320]   is measuring kind of brain heart connections
[00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:16.200]   and we can actually with transcranial magnetic stimulation,
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:17.540]   a form of brain stimulation,
[00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:19.340]   we can actually decelerate the heart rate.
[00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:22.320]   We can capture that heart rate deceleration
[00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:24.000]   over the mood regulatory regions.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.100]   And so actually a direct probe of that connection.
[00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:28.360]   So it's interesting.
[00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:31.560]   And so as you said a second ago,
[00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:34.680]   it's a very disabling condition, moderate depressions,
[00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:37.840]   about as disabling as having a heart attack,
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:39.440]   acutely having a heart attack,
[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:41.520]   severe depressions as disabling
[00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:44.440]   as having cancer without treatment
[00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:47.000]   and dying from a cancer without treatment.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.200]   And so it's kind of underappreciated
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:54.120]   just how disabling depression is in that way.
[00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:58.600]   And I think important as stigma is consistently
[00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:01.840]   kind of being reduced over the years for mental illness,
[00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:03.640]   for mental illnesses than the idea
[00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:06.040]   that we can start really putting more funding
[00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:08.560]   and putting more focus at the federal level,
[00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:10.640]   private foundation level, whatever it is
[00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:13.840]   at a given university to thinking about
[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:15.400]   developing treatments.
[00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:19.240]   We've been very interested in a very particular
[00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:23.440]   clinical set of problems around the most severe
[00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:26.420]   and the most high acuity settings
[00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:29.400]   that folks with depression end up being in.
[00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:32.260]   And that's in emergency settings
[00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:34.260]   where they go into inpatient units.
[00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:37.180]   And in the rest of medicine,
[00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:38.780]   if it's talking about heart attacks,
[00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:41.560]   if I start having chest pain right now
[00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:44.400]   and you bring me to a primary care doctor's office,
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:46.080]   they're gonna have a certain number of tests
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:47.240]   and treatments, right?
[00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:50.520]   But very limited 'cause it's an outpatient facility.
[00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:52.600]   If you bring me to the emergency room after that,
[00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:54.320]   there are more tests and more treatments.
[00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:57.680]   If you put me in the ICU or in the cath lab
[00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:00.800]   where they do invasive procedures to the heart,
[00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:02.800]   there are more tests and more treatments.
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:07.800]   In psychiatry, as we elevate the acuity of an individual,
[00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:10.200]   you go from being just depressed to being depressed
[00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.080]   and now thinking about ending your life,
[00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:16.480]   the number of treatments actually go down on average.
[00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:17.900]   I mean, in some scenarios they go up,
[00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:21.080]   but on average they go down and there are no tests, right?
[00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:24.520]   And so we've been very focused on that particular problem.
[00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:28.520]   Somebody that maybe was doing fairly okay
[00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:30.080]   with a pretty moderate depression
[00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:32.000]   and then their depression gets worse
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.040]   and then they end up in an emergency setting
[00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:38.320]   and the field really hasn't developed a way
[00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:42.040]   of consistently being able to treat that problem
[00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:43.960]   and folks end up getting the same standard
[00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:47.640]   oral antidepressants that they've been getting outpatient.
[00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:51.800]   And I came to this because I dual trained as a neurologist
[00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:53.680]   and psychiatrist, went back and forth
[00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:55.640]   between neurology and psychiatry,
[00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:58.000]   saw that in neurology we have all of these ways
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.040]   of treating acute brain-based problems
[00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:04.000]   and really wanted to emulate that in psychiatry
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.320]   and find ways to develop and engineer
[00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:08.780]   new brain-based solutions.
[00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:11.020]   - There's a lot to unpack there.
[00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:14.840]   One thing that you said is I'd like to focus on a bit more
[00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:17.960]   because I think we hear that the brain and the heart
[00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:21.240]   are connected, but you described, I believe,
[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:24.600]   a direct relationship between areas of the brain
[00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:28.520]   associated with emotion and heart rate.
[00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:32.040]   And that makes perfect logical sense to me,
[00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:36.600]   but I think at the same time, many people out there
[00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:39.280]   probably think of the relationship between the heart
[00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:43.400]   and the mind as kind of woo or kind of a soft biology,
[00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:46.600]   but here you're talking about an actual physical connection
[00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:49.040]   between what area of the brain is it?
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:52.560]   - The first place where the stimulation goes
[00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:54.760]   is called the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.
[00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:57.020]   It's kind of the sense of control,
[00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:58.600]   kind of governor of the brain.
[00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:02.560]   And then what we know is that when you use a magnet,
[00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:04.480]   use kind of what we call Faraday's law,
[00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:07.820]   this idea of using a magnetic pulse
[00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:10.560]   to induce an electrical current
[00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:12.840]   in electrically conducting substances.
[00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:16.480]   So in this case, brain tissue, but not skull or scalp
[00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:17.920]   or any of that or hair.
[00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:20.160]   You avoid all that, just the brain tissue.
[00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:24.920]   Then you have a direct depolarization of cortical neurons,
[00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:27.360]   the surface of the brain's neurons
[00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:29.720]   in this dorsolateral prefrontal.
[00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:33.360]   And if you do that in the actual scanner, which we can do,
[00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:35.860]   you can see that that distributes down
[00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:39.920]   into the anterior cingulate and the insula and the amygdala.
[00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:42.720]   And ultimately, the tract goes into something
[00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:45.080]   called the nucleus tractus solitarius
[00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:47.760]   and ultimately into the vagus nerve and to the heart.
[00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:52.760]   So the heart very consistently seems to be the end organ
[00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:55.960]   of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.
[00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:58.760]   If you measure heart rate in standard ways
[00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:00.860]   that cardiologists measure heart rate
[00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:03.360]   and you stimulate over this left dorsolateral,
[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:05.200]   you get a deceleration of the heart rate
[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:08.400]   and it's very time locked to the stimulation.
[00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:10.760]   So it's a two second train of stimulation.
[00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:12.920]   At one second, you see the deceleration.
[00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:15.040]   It goes down about 10 beats per minute
[00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:17.080]   and then it'll drift back up and there's a break
[00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:18.640]   for eight seconds on the stimulation.
[00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:21.360]   It drifts back up and the stimulation goes back in
[00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:22.960]   and then the heart rate goes back down.
[00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:25.320]   So you see the heart rate just do this,
[00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:27.480]   10 beats per minute every train.
[00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:30.760]   And so we know if you do that over visual cortex,
[00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:32.400]   you don't get that or motor cortex,
[00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:33.740]   you don't get any of those findings.
[00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:38.040]   It's really specific to this kind of control region
[00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:38.880]   of the brain.
[00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:42.280]   So, yeah, it seems to, you know, it's our work,
[00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:46.200]   other folks work, Martin Arens in Europe,
[00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:48.960]   the Netherlands work showing the same connections.
[00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:51.800]   I think it's been replicated like four or five times.
[00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:56.160]   - So you mentioned left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.
[00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:58.240]   Anytime I hear about lateralization of function,
[00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:02.040]   I get particularly curious because obviously
[00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:07.040]   we have two mirror symmetric sides of the brain.
[00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:09.580]   There are, you know, rare exceptions to this,
[00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:12.080]   like the pineal and things of that sort
[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:15.900]   that are only, there is only one pineal.
[00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:19.160]   What is special about the left dorsolateral
[00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:20.000]   prefrontal cortex?
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.720]   Does this have anything to do with handedness,
[00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:22.920]   right-hand or left-hand?
[00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:24.480]   Because we know right-hand and left-handedness
[00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:26.280]   has a lot to do with lateralization of function
[00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:30.480]   for language, a topic for another time.
[00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:33.820]   But why do you think that left dorsolateral
[00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:36.920]   prefrontal cortex would be connected to the heart
[00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:37.920]   in this way?
[00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:39.580]   - Yeah, yeah, I think so.
[00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:42.680]   So left dorsolateral, you know,
[00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:46.320]   is thought to be the side that when you excite it,
[00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:49.700]   when you kind of do excitatory stimulation,
[00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:51.360]   potentiating sort of stimulation,
[00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:54.760]   that you can reduce depressive symptoms.
[00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:57.040]   And a guy by the name of Mike Fox at Harvard
[00:18:57.040 --> 00:19:00.400]   has demonstrated that if you have strokes in the brain
[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:03.000]   that cause depression and you put them
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.960]   on the human connectome 100,000 patient map,
[00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:08.280]   and you ask the question what they're all
[00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:11.880]   functionally connected to, left dorsolateral.
[00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:15.680]   If you take lesions that cause mania in individuals
[00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:17.800]   and you put those all on the human connectome map
[00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:20.840]   and ask what they're all, the one common area
[00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:24.120]   they're all connected to, it's the right dorsolateral.
[00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:28.840]   And so there seems to be a hemispheric, you know,
[00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:31.840]   balancing of mood between these two brain regions.
[00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:34.600]   And we know this from an experimental standpoint too,
[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:37.140]   because you can take individuals with depression
[00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:40.920]   and you can excite the left or you can inhibit the right
[00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:43.480]   and they're both antidepressant.
[00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:45.880]   You can excite the right
[00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:48.640]   and that's anti-manic in some studies.
[00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:52.320]   And so this idea that there is this hemispheric balancing
[00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:54.600]   of mood is quite interesting, right?
[00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:56.520]   - It's incredibly interesting.
[00:19:56.520 --> 00:20:00.000]   And just so people know if you're curious
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.160]   what the connectome is, connectome is a term
[00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:04.600]   that was built out of this notion of genomes
[00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:07.680]   of being a large collections of sequencing
[00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:08.960]   and mapping of genes.
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:12.360]   They're proteomes of proteins of connectomes
[00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:15.360]   as a so-called connectomics of connections between neurons.
[00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:18.940]   So the Human Connectome Project is ongoing.
[00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:22.120]   And I find that incredible that within the connectome
[00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:24.220]   project, they can identify these regularities
[00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:27.400]   of right versus left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex,
[00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:32.400]   especially since I've looked at a fair number of brains
[00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:36.240]   from humans, certainly not as many as you have.
[00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:39.820]   And if you look at the architecture, the layers,
[00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:42.620]   the cell types, and even the neurochemicals
[00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:45.560]   of which cells are expressing say dopamine or serotonin
[00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:47.640]   or receiving input from areas that make dopamine
[00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:49.960]   or serotonin, they don't look that different
[00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:51.360]   on the right and left side.
[00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:54.800]   And yet here we're talking about a kind of an accelerator
[00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:59.140]   and a break, if you will, on depression and mania
[00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:03.240]   using what at least by my eye and I think other people's eye
[00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:06.280]   look to be basically the same set of bits,
[00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:08.360]   the same parts list, more or less.
[00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:12.400]   So what gives these properties to the right
[00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:14.080]   and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex?
[00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:16.040]   Is it the inputs they receive?
[00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:17.800]   Is this something that we learn during development
[00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:19.640]   or do you think that we come into the world
[00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:22.240]   with these hemispheric biases?
[00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:23.720]   - Yeah, it's a great question.
[00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:26.000]   And it hasn't been worked out,
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.360]   which your original question was around,
[00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:31.760]   in a left-handed individual, which as you know,
[00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:35.480]   25% of those folks end up having a right brain dominance
[00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:38.880]   or 1% of right-handed people have a right brain dominance
[00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:40.100]   if it's flipped, right?
[00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:44.000]   And unfortunately that study still hasn't been done
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.380]   at the level 'cause that would be probably pretty helpful
[00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:48.320]   for teasing some of this out.
[00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:52.560]   But it's still being sorted out, right?
[00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:56.960]   We know enough to know this phenomenon exists
[00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:00.520]   because we can use TMS as a probe
[00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:03.200]   and do these sorts of manipulations.
[00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:06.580]   But to my knowledge, there hasn't been anybody
[00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:08.080]   that's gotten so interested in it
[00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:12.400]   that they've been able to get a mechanism of why that is.
[00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:16.320]   But it's kind of empirically true
[00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:19.160]   in the sense that you can push and pull on those systems
[00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:22.800]   or in the case of strokes that folks have
[00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:25.520]   and then you kind of get their brains and their brain images
[00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:28.000]   and look at where the strokes landed,
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.060]   those kind of causal bits of information
[00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:33.340]   point to this asymmetry.
[00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:34.180]   - Interesting.
[00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:37.280]   Well, in that case, going with what we do know,
[00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:39.840]   that stimulation of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
[00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:43.200]   slows the heart rate down transiently, but it slows it down
[00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:46.840]   and seems to alleviate at least some symptoms of depression.
[00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:50.360]   Leads me to the question of why would that be the case?
[00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:53.480]   Does it tell us anything fundamental about depression
[00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:56.520]   that anxiety is inherent to depression?
[00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:58.000]   I think a faster heart rate
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.160]   is part and parcel with anxiety.
[00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:07.040]   In my laboratory, we've studied fear a bit
[00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:08.240]   in animals and in humans,
[00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:10.920]   and we often observe brachycardia
[00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:14.200]   where somebody or an animal is afraid of something
[00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:15.940]   and rather than the heart rate speeding up,
[00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:17.520]   it actually slows down,
[00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:21.520]   something that most people don't think about or recognize.
[00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:26.000]   But given that stimulation of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.080]   slows the heart rate down
[00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:29.540]   and can alleviate depressive symptoms
[00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:31.740]   and that there are other ways to slow the heart down,
[00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:32.920]   I have two questions.
[00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:34.420]   What do you think this tells us
[00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:37.720]   about the basic architecture of depression
[00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:40.500]   and its physiology at the level of the heart?
[00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:43.340]   And does the circuit run in the opposite direction too?
[00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:45.820]   If one were to have or find other ways to slow
[00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:48.600]   the heart rate down, say with a beta blocker,
[00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:50.520]   does that help alleviate depression?
[00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:51.660]   - Yeah, that's a great question.
[00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:55.360]   So I'll answer the second question first.
[00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:59.360]   So we know that there are ongoing trials of this.
[00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:01.720]   If you stimulate in the vagus nerve
[00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:04.440]   and an implanted vagus nerve stimulator,
[00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:09.440]   you can actually have the afferent parts of the vagus
[00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:14.860]   project ultimately up to the DLPFC through the cingulate,
[00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:16.080]   through these anterior insula,
[00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:18.900]   so obviously the same tract, right?
[00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:22.180]   And you can stimulate there and alleviate depression,
[00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:24.240]   which seems very unusual, right?
[00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:27.140]   You're stimulating a cranial nerve down on the neck,
[00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:29.340]   but if you can get up into the brain,
[00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:31.820]   you actually can improve depressive symptoms.
[00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:35.380]   And so more evidence that this is
[00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:37.840]   kind of a whole tract and system,
[00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:40.620]   and if you stimulate in part of that system,
[00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:44.100]   it appears that you can improve mood.
[00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:46.220]   - And what if I were somebody who did not have
[00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:48.700]   a stimulating electrode in my vagus nerve
[00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:51.420]   and I was dealing with minor depression
[00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:54.440]   and I decided I wanted to take some other approach
[00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:56.480]   to slow my heart rate down via the vagus.
[00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:59.620]   For instance, exhale emphasized breathing
[00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:04.220]   or deliberately slow cadence breathing, things of that sort.
[00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:06.100]   Is there any evidence that behavioral interventions
[00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:10.380]   of those kinds can alleviate depression
[00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:12.980]   or some symptoms of depression?
[00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:15.320]   And is there any evidence that it does indeed feed back
[00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:17.060]   to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
[00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:19.100]   to achieve some of that alleviation?
[00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:19.940]   - Absolutely, yeah.
[00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:24.400]   So there's a number of studies implicating the dorsolateral
[00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:29.320]   and say meditation, mindfulness, that sort of thing.
[00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:31.500]   And they're small studies,
[00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:34.580]   but pretty well designed studies suggesting
[00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:37.720]   that behavioral interventions in mild depression
[00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:39.580]   actually work quite well.
[00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:43.100]   There seems to be a volitional threshold for depression
[00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:46.180]   where at some point you start losing,
[00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:49.100]   you go from being completely in total volition
[00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:51.180]   to having kind of semi-volition.
[00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:53.500]   You have thoughts that you really have a hard time
[00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:54.780]   controlling and that sort of thing.
[00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:57.120]   And when you go through that threshold,
[00:25:57.120 --> 00:26:00.220]   at some point it gets harder and harder
[00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:03.160]   for those sorts of things to kind of kick in and work.
[00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:05.380]   In the extreme form of that is catatonia,
[00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:08.300]   where people in a very severe form of depression
[00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:10.320]   get kind of stuck motorically,
[00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:12.820]   and they obviously can't, they have no control,
[00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:16.220]   and so, or very limited control.
[00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:19.160]   And so I think there's a threshold
[00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:21.860]   in which these sorts of interventions will work.
[00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:24.860]   Exercise seems to really be a good treatment
[00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:26.580]   for mild depression,
[00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:29.200]   and it may work through the mechanism you're describing.
[00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:33.660]   As we all know, athletes hold a lower resting heart rate
[00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:37.900]   than folks that aren't, if you were an athlete,
[00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:39.260]   you had a lower resting heart rate,
[00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:41.980]   you stopped exercising, and a couple years later,
[00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:44.580]   your resting heart rate in many cases goes up, right?
[00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:48.340]   And so maybe that's part of the process.
[00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:52.460]   I'm not aware of any studies specifically
[00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:57.300]   looking at dorsolateral prefrontal physiology
[00:26:57.300 --> 00:26:59.860]   pre, post exercise, but it would be a great study.
[00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:02.600]   I think that would be really helpful to understanding this,
[00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:06.080]   especially if you had a correlation of changes
[00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:07.460]   and kind of lowering of, say, heart rate
[00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:09.200]   with mood improvements.
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:13.220]   There's been a lot of work with heart rate variability
[00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:18.220]   and depression, and studies kind of point towards it.
[00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:24.300]   Not every study is positive for this,
[00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:27.700]   but quite a few studies say basically
[00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:30.720]   that lower heart rate variability
[00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:34.820]   is associated with moderate to severe depression,
[00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:36.980]   and that may be part of that mechanism
[00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:40.140]   of that heart brain risk.
[00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:42.180]   - So I'm both intrigued and a little bit perplexed
[00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:45.860]   by this relationship between heart rate and depression.
[00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:48.820]   On the face of it, I would think of depression as depressed,
[00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:51.140]   so lower heart rate might make somebody more depressed.
[00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:52.740]   You even mentioned catatonia or somebody
[00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:56.260]   that just doesn't seem motivated or excited to do anything.
[00:27:56.260 --> 00:27:59.760]   I think of mania as elevated heart rate and being excited.
[00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:02.840]   On the other hand, I realized that anxiety,
[00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:07.300]   which brings about ideas as elevated heart rate,
[00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:09.020]   is also built into depression,
[00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:10.740]   which brings me back to what you said earlier,
[00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:12.660]   which is that when we say depression,
[00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:15.220]   are we really talking about four or five different
[00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:19.220]   disorders, for lack of a better word?
[00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:23.260]   And for what percentage of people that have depression
[00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:28.260]   does some approach to reducing heart rate work?
[00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:29.500]   Whether or not it's stimulation
[00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:32.900]   of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
[00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:34.820]   by way of transcranial magnet stimulation,
[00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:38.900]   or by taking a beta blocker, or by stimulating the vagus,
[00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:40.900]   can we throw out a number, a rough number?
[00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:45.340]   Does that help 30%, 50%, how long lasting is that relief?
[00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:50.060]   - Yeah, and to be clear, the deceleration of the heart rate
[00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:52.980]   is in the moment when the stimulation is happening,
[00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:54.980]   but it's not something
[00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:57.820]   that's necessarily maintained chronically.
[00:28:57.820 --> 00:29:01.140]   It's more of an indicator that you're in the right network
[00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:06.060]   more than it appears to be itself central to the mechanism.
[00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:08.680]   The heart rate variability piece may be,
[00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:11.020]   and there's some studies that link the two,
[00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:13.260]   but the actual deceleration seems to be much more
[00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:16.020]   of a marker that you're in the right system,
[00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:19.020]   but it very well could be that the heart rate system
[00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:21.060]   and the mood system just sit next to each other
[00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:23.100]   and the stimulation hits both.
[00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:26.380]   If you look at how much of the variance in the mood
[00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:28.460]   is explained by the heart rate deceleration,
[00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:32.220]   it's not a huge amount, right?
[00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:35.580]   So it only explains a small percentage.
[00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:40.580]   And so it's unlikely that simply reducing the heart rate,
[00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:44.060]   and in fact, for many years, propranolol
[00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:45.300]   and these sorts of drugs actually
[00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:47.520]   were implicating causing depression.
[00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:50.040]   And so that's been kind of debunked,
[00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:53.540]   but it's unlikely that simply decelerating the heart rate
[00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:55.300]   is gonna improve depression.
[00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:58.780]   But what it does tell you is that if you're in that area
[00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:00.740]   that is the mood regulatory area,
[00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:04.220]   there's some parasympathetic cortical kind of process
[00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:07.540]   that's going on that gets in and causes this to happen.
[00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:10.140]   And it's independent of mood.
[00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:14.540]   You can take a normal healthy individual and you can do this
[00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:17.460]   and they're gonna decelerate their heart rate.
[00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:18.400]   - I'm so glad you mentioned
[00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:19.900]   the parasympathetic nervous system,
[00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:21.120]   which of course is the,
[00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:22.780]   most people think of as the rest and digest
[00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:25.620]   or the kind of calming side of the autonomic nervous system.
[00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:27.300]   As I'm hearing you say all of this,
[00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:30.100]   and in particular, what you just told me,
[00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:33.620]   which is that it's not as if having a lower heart rate
[00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:34.920]   protects you against depression
[00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:37.420]   or a higher heart rate is associated with depression,
[00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:39.860]   although at the extremes, that might be true,
[00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:42.980]   but rather it's something about the regulatory network,
[00:30:42.980 --> 00:30:46.040]   the ability to control your own nervous system
[00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:46.980]   to some extent.
[00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:50.060]   And when I think about the autonomic nervous system,
[00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:53.500]   I like to think about as a seesaw of alertness and calmness.
[00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:55.300]   And when you're asleep, it's a lot of calmness.
[00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:58.100]   And when you're panicking, it's a lot of alertness.
[00:30:58.100 --> 00:31:01.060]   But that, and I don't think this has ever been defined.
[00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:03.620]   And when I teach the medical students
[00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:04.920]   at Stanford Neuroanatomy,
[00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:07.540]   my wish is that someday I'll be able to explain
[00:31:07.540 --> 00:31:09.980]   what the hinge in that process would be, right?
[00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:11.100]   Not the ends of the seesaw.
[00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:12.820]   We know what the sympathetic nervous system is
[00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:15.400]   and what it's to wake us up and make us panic
[00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:17.980]   or make us feel nicely alert and calm.
[00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:21.440]   We know what puts someone into sleep or a coma
[00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:23.360]   or makes them feel relaxed.
[00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:26.260]   But what shifts from one side of the seesaw to the other
[00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:28.100]   and the tightness of that hinge
[00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:29.540]   seems to be what you're describing,
[00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:32.720]   that depression is sort of a lack of control
[00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:34.780]   over inner state so that when I'm stressed,
[00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:35.860]   I can't get myself out of it.
[00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:38.780]   But when I'm feeling completely collapsed with exhaustion,
[00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:40.700]   I can't get out of bed and get motivated
[00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:42.320]   to do the very things that would help me
[00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:45.060]   get out of depression, like a workout or social connection
[00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:48.040]   or eat a quality meal, these kinds of things.
[00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:52.240]   So this is perhaps the first time that I've ever heard
[00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:55.120]   about a potential circuit for the hinge,
[00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:55.960]   as I'm referring to it.
[00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:57.420]   Does that make any sense at all?
[00:31:57.420 --> 00:31:58.260]   - Yeah, absolutely, absolutely.
[00:31:58.260 --> 00:31:59.100]   - Okay, I just want to make sure
[00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:00.620]   that I'm framing this correctly in my mind.
[00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:01.460]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:32:01.460 --> 00:32:05.160]   And in some studies, if you do the same identical stimulation
[00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:07.900]   on the right dorsolateral, you can get an acceleration.
[00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:11.740]   You know, just kind of further confirming this idea
[00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:15.420]   of lateralization, right, that even it appears
[00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:18.600]   that even the prefrontal cortical areas
[00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:20.940]   seem to be lateralized in this way.
[00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:25.740]   And I, you know, it's less, the right finding
[00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:28.160]   is more variable depending upon the study.
[00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:31.780]   The left's very consistent in this way, so.
[00:32:31.780 --> 00:32:34.220]   - So we've talked about Czern's cranial magnet stimulation
[00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:35.900]   for getting into these networks.
[00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:38.860]   And I also just want to take a brief tangent and say I,
[00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:40.260]   'cause I've heard you say this before,
[00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:42.540]   I think it's so vital what you're saying
[00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:45.680]   that it's really not about stimulation of areas.
[00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:49.200]   It's, or any specific brain area or vagus nerve
[00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:51.280]   being important per se.
[00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:53.420]   It's really about a network, a connection,
[00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:54.980]   a series of connections.
[00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:57.100]   I think that's really important for people to understand
[00:32:57.100 --> 00:33:00.000]   and is kind of a new emerging theme really.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.600]   The other thing that to me seems extremely important
[00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:08.600]   for us to consider is what are these lateral prefrontal
[00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:11.420]   cortices doing?
[00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:14.020]   Are they involved, for instance, in sensation,
[00:33:14.020 --> 00:33:15.100]   sensing the heart rate?
[00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:17.780]   Are they involved in thinking and planning?
[00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:19.780]   And this gets down to a very simple question
[00:33:19.780 --> 00:33:20.900]   that I know a lot of people have,
[00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:24.380]   which is can we talk ourselves out of depression
[00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:25.660]   if it's mild?
[00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:29.740]   Can we talk ourselves into a manic state
[00:33:29.740 --> 00:33:31.860]   or an excited state, a positively excited state
[00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:34.200]   that doesn't qualify as mania?
[00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:36.900]   Other areas of the brain, I think of they is responsible
[00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:39.660]   for perception or for motor control.
[00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:42.480]   But here we are in this mysterious frontal cortex area,
[00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:45.400]   which people say executive function, planning, et cetera.
[00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:47.540]   Are we talking about thoughts?
[00:33:47.540 --> 00:33:49.380]   Are we talking about structured thoughts?
[00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:51.380]   Are we talking about dreamlike thoughts?
[00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:55.520]   What in the world is going on in the prefrontal cortex?
[00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:57.620]   And here I spend my career in neuroscience
[00:33:57.620 --> 00:34:01.820]   and I still can't really understand what it's doing
[00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:03.700]   and maybe it's doing 50 things.
[00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:05.420]   - Yeah, no, it's a great question.
[00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:10.420]   So one of the studies that we've been working on
[00:34:10.420 --> 00:34:11.820]   in addition to the depression work
[00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:15.060]   is actually trying to change trait hypnotizability.
[00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:17.520]   So David Spiegel and I have been working on this
[00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:21.740]   and he's found and published this 10 years ago
[00:34:21.740 --> 00:34:25.660]   that a different part of the left dorsolateral
[00:34:25.660 --> 00:34:30.340]   is functionally connected with the dorsol anterior cingulate
[00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:33.180]   with a lot of functional connectivity and high hypnotizables
[00:34:33.180 --> 00:34:35.720]   and not much in low hypnotizables.
[00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:38.780]   And that's a different, kind of a different sub-region
[00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:40.980]   within this bigger brain region we call
[00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:43.340]   left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
[00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:47.020]   than the part that seems to be important for regulating mood.
[00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:52.020]   And so the left dorsolateral seems to have connections
[00:34:52.020 --> 00:34:56.280]   that are location specific within the overall
[00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:59.460]   kind of named brain region that connect to various parts
[00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:03.260]   of the cingulate and seem to regulate it, right?
[00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:06.300]   And so if you knock out the left dorsolateral
[00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:10.180]   prefrontal cortex and you have people do the Stroop task,
[00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:13.100]   for instance, which is a task where you have,
[00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:15.300]   it's a simple task, you probably know this,
[00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:19.140]   you have people name the color of words.
[00:35:19.140 --> 00:35:24.140]   And so if I look at one of the cards that they'll show you,
[00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:28.780]   it'll have the word red in red and that's very easy
[00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:30.660]   and that's called a congruent.
[00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:35.660]   And then the incongruent is red in the color blue
[00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:39.860]   and you have to name, you have to say the word,
[00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:41.960]   you don't name the color.
[00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:43.460]   - So you have to suppress a response.
[00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:44.500]   - Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:47.740]   And so, I'm sorry, you name the color
[00:35:47.740 --> 00:35:50.700]   and you see the word written in a different way.
[00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:55.380]   And so basically, if you stimulate in a way
[00:35:55.380 --> 00:35:57.940]   that inhibits the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
[00:35:57.940 --> 00:36:01.220]   or either one, you can actually knock out the ability
[00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:04.220]   to do that well and it'll take longer for people
[00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:08.720]   on the incongruent cards to be able to name it.
[00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:11.700]   And so they have a kind of a time delay
[00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:14.740]   that's greater than they had before they got stimulated.
[00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:17.940]   So that's a part of the prefrontal cortex
[00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:20.140]   that's different than the part of the prefrontal cortex
[00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:22.420]   that's involved in mood regulation.
[00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:25.460]   The nice thing about TMS is that you can go through
[00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:29.460]   and you can find these areas that are functionally defined
[00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:32.020]   through brain imaging and you can perturb them
[00:36:32.020 --> 00:36:33.700]   and answer the question you're talking about.
[00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:36.900]   How do I understand this part of the prefrontal cortex
[00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:39.040]   and its function, this part?
[00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:44.040]   And so we were able to stimulate in an inhibitory way
[00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:47.420]   within the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
[00:36:47.420 --> 00:36:52.100]   that's involved with this sort of cognitive control area
[00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:55.140]   and we were able to knock that area out
[00:36:55.140 --> 00:36:58.340]   and an increased trait hypnotizability.
[00:36:58.340 --> 00:37:03.100]   So people had greater hypnotizability
[00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:05.520]   after they got active stimulation
[00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:07.300]   versus when they got sham.
[00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:11.620]   And so it suggests that that brain circuit is involved
[00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:16.620]   in the process of what therapeutic hypnosis ends up being
[00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:18.960]   but it's a very different region
[00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:21.260]   within the left dorsolateral than say we do
[00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:24.500]   when we do these very intensive stimulation approaches
[00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:26.420]   to treat severe depression
[00:37:26.420 --> 00:37:29.300]   and we're able to get people out of depression.
[00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:31.300]   With the part of the dorsolateral,
[00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:35.060]   it seems to be lower in the kind of more lateral
[00:37:35.060 --> 00:37:40.820]   and inferior on the DLPFC
[00:37:40.820 --> 00:37:43.380]   and connected with this subgenual anterior cingulate.
[00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:44.620]   So the part of the anterior cingulate
[00:37:44.620 --> 00:37:46.900]   that processes emotion.
[00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:48.420]   - I'd like to take a quick break
[00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:51.340]   and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.
[00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:54.900]   Athletic Greens now called AG1 is a vitamin mineral
[00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:57.660]   probiotic drink that covers all of your foundational
[00:37:57.660 --> 00:37:59.060]   nutritional needs.
[00:37:59.060 --> 00:38:01.740]   I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012
[00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:03.960]   so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:05.540]   The reason I started taking Athletic Greens
[00:38:05.540 --> 00:38:07.620]   and the reason I still take Athletic Greens
[00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:10.740]   once or usually twice a day is that it gets me
[00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:13.220]   the probiotics that I need for gut health.
[00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:14.340]   Our gut is very important.
[00:38:14.340 --> 00:38:16.860]   It's populated by gut microbiota
[00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:18.620]   that communicate with the brain, the immune system
[00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:21.020]   and basically all the biological systems of our body
[00:38:21.020 --> 00:38:24.660]   to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health.
[00:38:24.660 --> 00:38:27.700]   And those probiotics in Athletic Greens are optimal
[00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:30.340]   and vital for microbiota health.
[00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:32.940]   In addition, Athletic Greens contains a number of adaptogens,
[00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:34.340]   vitamins and minerals that make sure
[00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:37.280]   that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met
[00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:39.160]   and it tastes great.
[00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:40.620]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:38:40.620 --> 00:38:44.020]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:45.980]   and they'll give you five free travel packs
[00:38:45.980 --> 00:38:48.300]   that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens
[00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:49.580]   while you're on the road, in the car,
[00:38:49.580 --> 00:38:50.880]   on the plane, et cetera.
[00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:54.300]   And they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:56.980]   Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:38:56.980 --> 00:38:58.340]   to get the five free travel packs
[00:38:58.340 --> 00:39:01.140]   and the year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:39:01.140 --> 00:39:03.300]   Based on what you told us about the Stroop task
[00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:06.580]   and the role of the prefrontal cortex in the Stroop task,
[00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:09.620]   to me, the Stroop task is a rule switching game.
[00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:10.880]   You're saying in one moment,
[00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:14.100]   the rule is you read whatever the word says
[00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:17.040]   and then you switch and then you say the rule now
[00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:20.380]   is you tell me what color the word is written in
[00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:23.240]   and you suppress whatever it is the word says, okay?
[00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:24.080]   - Yeah, that's right.
[00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:27.580]   - Okay, a rule in some sense like that
[00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:31.220]   is a transiently adopted belief system.
[00:39:31.220 --> 00:39:33.180]   So I could imagine that in depression,
[00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:37.520]   which has all sorts of backstory to it,
[00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:39.560]   that of course the psychiatrist or psychologist
[00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:41.040]   or friend can pull on that thread.
[00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:45.340]   Like for instance, somebody might believe that they are bad
[00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:46.900]   or that they don't deserve love.
[00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:49.020]   I'm trying to bring this into the typical language
[00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:49.860]   that people talk about.
[00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:50.700]   - Absolutely.
[00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:52.040]   - That they will never succeed
[00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:54.340]   or that even if they keep succeeding,
[00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:56.160]   it's just going to get harder and harder
[00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:58.020]   and it will never feel good.
[00:39:58.020 --> 00:40:01.420]   These are sort of rules like the Stroop task at some level.
[00:40:01.420 --> 00:40:02.800]   They're rules that are more pervasive
[00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:04.500]   over time, unfortunately.
[00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:08.900]   But I could imagine that if the PFC is also contains
[00:40:08.900 --> 00:40:11.860]   some sort of maps or algorithms related to rules
[00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:14.420]   of emotionality or self-representation
[00:40:14.420 --> 00:40:15.540]   or things that we've heard,
[00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:17.580]   I think there must be data out there
[00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:19.800]   that saying that whatever we heard in middle school,
[00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:21.940]   when someone made fun of us, we can remember that.
[00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:24.140]   'Cause I can remember things that people said
[00:40:24.140 --> 00:40:26.840]   about a jacket I wore one day
[00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:28.820]   or something in the fourth grade, crazy.
[00:40:28.820 --> 00:40:30.360]   I didn't even like the jacket.
[00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:32.500]   Now I think it was kind of cool.
[00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:35.540]   But anyway, the point being that we have an intense memory
[00:40:35.540 --> 00:40:38.220]   for these things that set up a sort of rule or a question,
[00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:42.340]   like maybe I don't really know how to dress for instance.
[00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:44.780]   Maybe that's why I always wear the same black shirt.
[00:40:44.780 --> 00:40:45.940]   But in all seriousness,
[00:40:45.940 --> 00:40:48.220]   it seems like the dorsal out prefrontal cortex
[00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:52.300]   is in this amazing position to access rules,
[00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:54.700]   which are beliefs and beliefs are rules.
[00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:58.680]   And then for moments or longer to switch those rules.
[00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:01.200]   And so for somebody who's depressed
[00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:03.000]   to just simply look themselves in the mirror and say,
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:05.160]   you are great, you are fantastic.
[00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:08.340]   It feels like a lie if you feel like garbage to say that.
[00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:10.120]   It doesn't fit with the rule.
[00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:12.860]   It's like saying that card is not red.
[00:41:12.860 --> 00:41:16.640]   That card is green when your eyes tell you that it's red.
[00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:21.500]   And it seems like there's something about prefrontal cortex
[00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:25.060]   that in principle gives flexibility to rules
[00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:27.020]   based on what we know on this Stroop task.
[00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:29.620]   So given its connectivity,
[00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:33.420]   can we assume that the talk therapy that occurs
[00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:36.180]   in the psychiatrist's office or with a friend
[00:41:36.180 --> 00:41:37.980]   or through journaling out something,
[00:41:37.980 --> 00:41:41.660]   because we do know that reporting things about trauma
[00:41:41.660 --> 00:41:44.260]   or difficult circumstances or the rules that we contain
[00:41:44.260 --> 00:41:47.620]   and tend to hide inside of us about how we feel miserable,
[00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:50.540]   about ourselves or anything really,
[00:41:50.540 --> 00:41:53.300]   that in re-scripting that,
[00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:56.980]   that somehow it allows us to do a sort of Stroop task
[00:41:56.980 --> 00:42:00.500]   on our beliefs, is that a tremendous leap?
[00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:02.380]   I'm just really trying to frame this in the context
[00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:04.900]   of what I and most people think of as depression.
[00:42:04.900 --> 00:42:05.960]   - Yeah, totally.
[00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:07.900]   - Because the network components are vitally important,
[00:42:07.900 --> 00:42:09.720]   but I guess what I'm trying to figure out is like,
[00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:14.720]   what are the algorithms that govern prefrontal cortex?
[00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:15.820]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:42:15.820 --> 00:42:18.100]   So in a kind of standard cognitive
[00:42:18.100 --> 00:42:20.300]   behavioral therapy session, right?
[00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:23.600]   What the therapist is just trying to do
[00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:28.380]   is identify those beliefs and kind of determine
[00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:32.060]   how fixed they are, if they're flexible, as you're saying,
[00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:37.060]   and then help folks to find another explanation for them
[00:42:37.060 --> 00:42:42.700]   and to kind of reintegrate that potential other explanation
[00:42:43.420 --> 00:42:46.220]   into their memory system, right?
[00:42:46.220 --> 00:42:49.620]   Where I think TMS is really interesting, actually,
[00:42:49.620 --> 00:42:51.140]   we had a lot of patients who've told me,
[00:42:51.140 --> 00:42:54.960]   like my therapist told me that I wasn't trying hard enough
[00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:59.440]   in therapy and I really am trying hard,
[00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:03.140]   but these are moderate, pretty severe depressed patients.
[00:43:03.140 --> 00:43:06.860]   And as soon as we get them well with the TMS approaches,
[00:43:06.860 --> 00:43:09.180]   kind of rapid five day approach,
[00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:10.940]   and the next week we come in and see them
[00:43:10.940 --> 00:43:12.300]   and they'll say, you know what I did all weekend
[00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:13.660]   as I looked at my therapy books
[00:43:13.660 --> 00:43:15.600]   and now I can understand it.
[00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:18.980]   And so I actually see TMS as a way
[00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:23.980]   of having kind of exogenous sorts of cognitive functions
[00:43:23.980 --> 00:43:27.020]   that in milder forms of depression,
[00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:29.940]   we can pull off with psychotherapy,
[00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:32.000]   this idea of being able to kind of turn
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:35.780]   that prefrontal cortex on and have it govern
[00:43:35.780 --> 00:43:37.980]   these deeper regions, and depression,
[00:43:37.980 --> 00:43:41.900]   the deeper regions govern the prefrontal cortex,
[00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:45.260]   they precede the prefrontal cortex timing-wise,
[00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:46.940]   and we've got some data in review now
[00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:50.180]   where we're seeing that in depressed individuals
[00:43:50.180 --> 00:43:52.720]   that are responsive to our rapid TMS approach,
[00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:54.860]   what we call Stanford-accelerated intelligent
[00:43:54.860 --> 00:43:58.960]   neuromodulation therapy, or S&T, or SAINT,
[00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:02.700]   if you look at the brain before people get this,
[00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:06.300]   they will have a temporal delay
[00:44:06.300 --> 00:44:11.300]   where the cingulate is in front of the DLPFC.
[00:44:11.580 --> 00:44:15.380]   And in people that are normal healthy controls,
[00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:18.740]   no depression, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
[00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:23.000]   is temporally in front of the anterior cingulate.
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   With effective treatment, we can flip the timing of things
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:32.140]   so the dorsolateral is in front of the anterior cingulate,
[00:44:32.140 --> 00:44:33.920]   just like in a normal person.
[00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:35.260]   - So you're not talking about, obviously,
[00:44:35.260 --> 00:44:36.500]   physically moving these structures,
[00:44:36.500 --> 00:44:38.660]   you're talking about in time, their activation.
[00:44:38.660 --> 00:44:41.580]   So in one case, it's like the coach telling the player
[00:44:41.580 --> 00:44:43.020]   what to do, and in the other case,
[00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:44.660]   like a player telling the coach what to do,
[00:44:44.660 --> 00:44:46.820]   and you restore order to the game.
[00:44:46.820 --> 00:44:48.140]   - You restore order to the game.
[00:44:48.140 --> 00:44:52.020]   And what it looks like is depression, to your point,
[00:44:52.020 --> 00:44:55.300]   is a bunch of kind of spontaneous content
[00:44:55.300 --> 00:44:58.700]   that's semi-volitional, that's being kind of generated
[00:44:58.700 --> 00:45:02.180]   out of this conflict detection system,
[00:45:02.180 --> 00:45:06.420]   the cingulate that seems to sense conflict
[00:45:06.420 --> 00:45:09.420]   and kind of feed that information, gets overactive
[00:45:09.420 --> 00:45:13.300]   in depression, and then in depression,
[00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:15.420]   it looks like the left dorsolateral
[00:45:15.420 --> 00:45:19.120]   does not sufficiently clamp down on it.
[00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:23.320]   And what therapy appears to do is to kind of restore that.
[00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:26.340]   What we see with TMS over that region
[00:45:26.340 --> 00:45:28.980]   is that we just exogenously do the same sort of thing.
[00:45:28.980 --> 00:45:33.240]   We restore the governance of the left dorsolateral
[00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:36.660]   over the cingulate area, and that is correlated
[00:45:36.660 --> 00:45:38.440]   with treatment improvement.
[00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:43.440]   So the degree in which you can re-time, re-regulate in time
[00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:46.680]   the left dorsolateral over the cingulate,
[00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:48.980]   the more of an antidepressant effect you have.
[00:45:48.980 --> 00:45:54.500]   - Can we therefore say in crude terms
[00:45:54.500 --> 00:45:57.920]   that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
[00:45:57.920 --> 00:46:00.300]   really is the governor of how we interpret
[00:46:00.300 --> 00:46:02.860]   physiological signals and spontaneous thoughts?
[00:46:02.860 --> 00:46:07.280]   - It is, it places a lens that the rest of the brain
[00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:11.020]   sees things through, and you can do these experiments
[00:46:11.020 --> 00:46:14.500]   where you can put a normal healthy control person
[00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:17.640]   in the scanner, and you can make them feel
[00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:19.620]   like they have a loss of control,
[00:46:19.620 --> 00:46:22.820]   and then you can see that region come offline, right?
[00:46:22.820 --> 00:46:26.020]   So you experimentally manipulate the system,
[00:46:26.020 --> 00:46:29.400]   and so kind of buffing it up, it's like almost,
[00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:32.860]   TMS is almost like exercise for the brain, right?
[00:46:32.860 --> 00:46:35.880]   You're kind of exercising this region over and over again
[00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:39.200]   with a physiologically relevant signal
[00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:41.360]   and kind of turning that system on.
[00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:44.160]   And what's interesting, I think really interesting
[00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:48.320]   for this show is to, we had a couple of folks,
[00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:50.240]   probably five or six folks that have actually told me this,
[00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:52.240]   where if they remit early enough in the week,
[00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:54.440]   we have this very dense stimulation approach
[00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:57.440]   where we can stimulate people really rapidly
[00:46:57.440 --> 00:46:59.100]   over a five-day block.
[00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:00.880]   We don't discriminate when they get better
[00:47:00.880 --> 00:47:03.780]   to when they stop, so if they get better on day one,
[00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:05.400]   we still give them the other four days
[00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:07.640]   because it's in the protocol to do that.
[00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:09.300]   We're getting to a point where we can tell
[00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:12.180]   how long it's gonna take, but we're not there yet.
[00:47:12.180 --> 00:47:15.720]   And so every time somebody gets better at day one or two,
[00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:17.200]   at the beginning when we first started doing this,
[00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:20.200]   we'd say, we're not sure, we think this is safe
[00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:22.780]   to keep going, but what do you wanna do?
[00:47:22.780 --> 00:47:25.440]   And everybody was like, no, I wanna keep going.
[00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:29.140]   And so by Wednesday, they're like totally zeroed out
[00:47:29.140 --> 00:47:31.700]   on the depression scales, even better
[00:47:31.700 --> 00:47:33.220]   than most people walking around,
[00:47:33.220 --> 00:47:36.020]   like really no anxiety, no depression or anything.
[00:47:36.020 --> 00:47:39.260]   By Thursday, the first guy that told me this,
[00:47:39.260 --> 00:47:42.620]   he came in and he said, I was driving back to my hotel
[00:47:42.620 --> 00:47:44.940]   and I decided to go to the beach and I just sat there
[00:47:44.940 --> 00:47:48.400]   and I was totally present in the present moment for an hour.
[00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:50.780]   And he's like, I read about this in my mindfulness books,
[00:47:50.780 --> 00:47:53.420]   but I experienced it last night
[00:47:53.420 --> 00:47:55.340]   and I've never experienced anything like this before
[00:47:55.340 --> 00:47:57.240]   and I was like, hmm, that's interesting,
[00:47:57.240 --> 00:47:58.820]   but kinda wasn't sure.
[00:47:58.820 --> 00:48:02.020]   And then I didn't tell obviously any more patients
[00:48:02.020 --> 00:48:04.820]   about that and then about five over the last couple of years
[00:48:04.820 --> 00:48:06.980]   when they were mid early in the week.
[00:48:06.980 --> 00:48:09.140]   By the end of the week, they're like going to the beach
[00:48:09.140 --> 00:48:11.800]   and they're like totally having what people describe
[00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:15.960]   as a pretty mindful present moment sort of experience,
[00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:18.080]   which is really interesting what that is.
[00:48:18.080 --> 00:48:21.440]   I mean, I don't have full on scientific data to tell you,
[00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:25.180]   but it's an interesting anecdote
[00:48:25.180 --> 00:48:27.780]   that folks, when you push them through this point
[00:48:27.780 --> 00:48:30.820]   of feeling kind of clinically well,
[00:48:30.820 --> 00:48:32.420]   that some people end up reporting
[00:48:32.420 --> 00:48:35.320]   this additional set of features, so.
[00:48:35.320 --> 00:48:36.580]   - Yeah, you mentioned the cingulate
[00:48:36.580 --> 00:48:38.620]   and the anterior cingulate in particular,
[00:48:38.620 --> 00:48:41.960]   because now I feel like for the first time in my career,
[00:48:41.960 --> 00:48:44.580]   I have some sense of what prefrontal cortex
[00:48:44.580 --> 00:48:46.300]   might actually be doing,
[00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:49.340]   besides providing a bumper for the rest of the brain.
[00:48:52.060 --> 00:48:55.220]   The cingulate it seems is a more primitive structure
[00:48:55.220 --> 00:48:58.820]   in the sense that it's under the,
[00:48:58.820 --> 00:49:00.500]   ideally it's under the regulation
[00:49:00.500 --> 00:49:02.700]   of this top-down control from prefrontal cortex,
[00:49:02.700 --> 00:49:04.780]   but what's mapped in the cingulate?
[00:49:04.780 --> 00:49:06.560]   And for the non-neuroscientists out there,
[00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:09.380]   when I say mapped, if we were to put someone in a scanner
[00:49:09.380 --> 00:49:12.100]   and focus in on cingulate or put an electrode in there,
[00:49:12.100 --> 00:49:13.980]   what makes the neurons in there fire?
[00:49:13.980 --> 00:49:16.900]   What sorts of things in the body and in the mind
[00:49:16.900 --> 00:49:21.100]   and out in the world light up, for lack of a better phrase,
[00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:23.360]   the cingulate, what does the cingulate like?
[00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:25.460]   - Yeah, yeah, so that Stroop task,
[00:49:25.460 --> 00:49:28.380]   those incongruent word color associations,
[00:49:28.380 --> 00:49:30.540]   the dorsal part of that.
[00:49:30.540 --> 00:49:34.220]   For obsessive compulsive disorder patients,
[00:49:34.220 --> 00:49:37.340]   certain kind of triggers you'll see,
[00:49:37.340 --> 00:49:39.100]   some of the neuroimaging studies
[00:49:39.100 --> 00:49:41.500]   will point to anterior cingulate.
[00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:43.900]   In the kind of very crude psychosurgery world
[00:49:43.900 --> 00:49:46.460]   50 years ago, the anterior cingulotomy
[00:49:46.460 --> 00:49:49.540]   was a way of treating obsessive compulsive disorder, right?
[00:49:49.540 --> 00:49:52.220]   'Cause that area seems to be overactive
[00:49:52.220 --> 00:49:55.400]   in people who are experiencing obsessive compulsive disorder.
[00:49:55.400 --> 00:49:58.660]   You can kind of walk, the cingulate wraps around
[00:49:58.660 --> 00:50:01.660]   this white matter track, like bundles,
[00:50:01.660 --> 00:50:04.060]   it wraps around that, and so there's a part
[00:50:04.060 --> 00:50:07.260]   that's above that, around that, and below that.
[00:50:07.260 --> 00:50:12.260]   And depending upon how much of the conflict task
[00:50:12.260 --> 00:50:17.700]   has an emotional component, the more ventral
[00:50:17.700 --> 00:50:22.700]   and subgenual that activation is.
[00:50:22.700 --> 00:50:26.780]   So the dorsal part of the anterior cingulate
[00:50:26.780 --> 00:50:30.020]   seems to be kind of more of a pure cognitive,
[00:50:30.020 --> 00:50:34.160]   maybe obsessive compulsive disorder sort of area,
[00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:37.080]   whereas when you start getting into mood sorts of triggers,
[00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:42.080]   like facial expression conflicts where you're supposed to,
[00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:44.160]   you know, there's an emotional Stroop task
[00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:45.740]   where you show the word happy,
[00:50:45.740 --> 00:50:49.840]   and then you have a face of a person that looks mad,
[00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:51.100]   then that's another way
[00:50:51.100 --> 00:50:53.660]   of having the same sort of Stroop conflict.
[00:50:53.660 --> 00:50:57.300]   That seems to be more perigenual, subgenual areas, right?
[00:50:57.300 --> 00:51:00.140]   So you can kind of, you can trigger the cingulate
[00:51:00.140 --> 00:51:02.540]   based off the level of emotional valence
[00:51:02.540 --> 00:51:05.060]   from none down to a lot,
[00:51:05.060 --> 00:51:08.700]   and that seems to be how it's distributed.
[00:51:08.700 --> 00:51:11.180]   There are, you know, heart rate kind of components to it,
[00:51:11.180 --> 00:51:13.260]   autonomic components in there too.
[00:51:13.260 --> 00:51:15.900]   There's something called akinetic mutism.
[00:51:15.900 --> 00:51:19.140]   You know, I'm a board certified neuropsychiatrist,
[00:51:19.140 --> 00:51:21.820]   behavioral neurologist, and I've seen, you know,
[00:51:21.820 --> 00:51:24.380]   a lot of these, what we call zebra cases in neurology
[00:51:24.380 --> 00:51:25.900]   where people have, you know,
[00:51:25.900 --> 00:51:28.340]   these unusual neurological presentations,
[00:51:28.340 --> 00:51:30.780]   and one of them is akinetic mutism.
[00:51:30.780 --> 00:51:32.980]   So if you have a glioma
[00:51:32.980 --> 00:51:35.700]   sitting in the inner hemispheric fissure
[00:51:35.700 --> 00:51:39.580]   and kind of having pressure on the cingulate,
[00:51:39.580 --> 00:51:42.220]   people can get into an almost catatonic looking state
[00:51:42.220 --> 00:51:44.580]   where they kind of get stuck and they don't speak,
[00:51:44.580 --> 00:51:46.340]   and so that tells you something
[00:51:46.340 --> 00:51:50.020]   about how the cingulate works as well, right?
[00:51:50.020 --> 00:51:55.020]   It's like if it's not functioning,
[00:51:55.020 --> 00:51:59.340]   then people have a hard time kind of connecting with reality.
[00:51:59.340 --> 00:52:02.660]   It seems to need to be constantly on, you know,
[00:52:02.660 --> 00:52:05.940]   online to be able to interact with the exterior world.
[00:52:05.940 --> 00:52:08.180]   - Is it involved in some of the dissociative states
[00:52:08.180 --> 00:52:10.740]   that sometimes people who are very stressed
[00:52:10.740 --> 00:52:12.340]   or depressed experience,
[00:52:12.340 --> 00:52:15.200]   you said catatonia being an extreme one,
[00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:16.860]   but I know someone, for instance,
[00:52:16.860 --> 00:52:18.760]   that when they get really stressed,
[00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:22.900]   and it can even be if someone yells at them
[00:52:22.900 --> 00:52:25.540]   or someone's angry, even if someone's angry with them
[00:52:25.540 --> 00:52:27.140]   or they perceive someone's angry with them,
[00:52:27.140 --> 00:52:28.320]   there's a developmental backstory
[00:52:28.320 --> 00:52:30.240]   to why they likely feel this way.
[00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:33.500]   They sort of just kind of can't,
[00:52:33.500 --> 00:52:36.540]   this is a high, high functioning individual normally,
[00:52:36.540 --> 00:52:38.640]   and they just sort of can't function.
[00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:41.940]   They can't complete simple things like email or groceries
[00:52:41.940 --> 00:52:43.600]   or things for a short while.
[00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:45.800]   It's almost like a catatonia,
[00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:49.200]   and they refer to it as a dissociative state.
[00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:51.840]   Do you see that in depression?
[00:52:51.840 --> 00:52:53.480]   And I mean, we're speculating here
[00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:55.080]   as to whether or not that involves a cingulate,
[00:52:55.080 --> 00:52:57.920]   but what you're saying holds a lot of salience for me
[00:52:57.920 --> 00:52:59.200]   in thinking about this example.
[00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:01.280]   - Yeah, yeah, there's,
[00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:04.780]   so you see catatonia as an extreme outcome of depression
[00:53:04.780 --> 00:53:09.060]   and of, and sometimes schizophrenia and other illnesses.
[00:53:09.060 --> 00:53:11.460]   Dissociation is an extreme outcome,
[00:53:11.460 --> 00:53:13.780]   or even in some cases a less extreme outcome
[00:53:13.780 --> 00:53:16.380]   of PTSD and trauma.
[00:53:16.380 --> 00:53:21.020]   And it's also a phenomenon that happens naturally
[00:53:21.020 --> 00:53:23.680]   in some people that are highly hypnotizable.
[00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:25.020]   And so if you ask David Spiegel,
[00:53:25.020 --> 00:53:28.200]   he'd say that some of the work that he's been working on
[00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:29.980]   is around posterior cingulate
[00:53:29.980 --> 00:53:32.400]   and the capacity to dissociate.
[00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:37.400]   But yeah, with our stimulation approach to DLPFC,
[00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:39.380]   dorsal anterior cingulate,
[00:53:39.380 --> 00:53:42.440]   one of the subscales that moved the most
[00:53:42.440 --> 00:53:46.400]   was the dissociative subscale for hypnotizability.
[00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:49.540]   So even in a normal individual,
[00:53:49.540 --> 00:53:53.440]   you see that change in that kind of experience
[00:53:53.440 --> 00:53:54.560]   of dissociation.
[00:53:54.560 --> 00:53:56.820]   - I am highly hypnotizable.
[00:53:56.820 --> 00:53:58.400]   David's hypnotized me a number of times.
[00:53:58.400 --> 00:53:59.540]   In fact, we have a clip of that
[00:53:59.540 --> 00:54:01.460]   on our human life clips channel.
[00:54:01.460 --> 00:54:05.860]   I've always, well, always starting in my early teens,
[00:54:05.860 --> 00:54:07.080]   I started exploring hypnosis.
[00:54:07.080 --> 00:54:09.260]   I'm extremely hypnotizable.
[00:54:09.260 --> 00:54:13.580]   And self-hypnosis or assisted hypnosis.
[00:54:13.580 --> 00:54:16.240]   I don't know that I ever go into dissociative states.
[00:54:16.240 --> 00:54:18.420]   I'll try and avoid forcing you
[00:54:18.420 --> 00:54:20.320]   into running a clinical session right now,
[00:54:20.320 --> 00:54:22.580]   but to assess anything like that.
[00:54:22.580 --> 00:54:26.180]   But this brings about something really interesting, I think,
[00:54:26.180 --> 00:54:29.820]   which is I'm aware that some of the more popular
[00:54:29.820 --> 00:54:33.420]   emerging treatments for depression include things
[00:54:33.420 --> 00:54:36.940]   like ketamine, which is a dissociative anesthetic.
[00:54:36.940 --> 00:54:37.780]   Is that right?
[00:54:37.780 --> 00:54:42.440]   And my assumption is that as a dissociative anesthetic,
[00:54:42.440 --> 00:54:44.380]   that it leads to dissociative states
[00:54:44.380 --> 00:54:46.760]   where people can sort of third person themselves
[00:54:46.760 --> 00:54:50.220]   and feel somewhat distanced from their emotions.
[00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:55.700]   I've also been hearing that there are emerging treatments,
[00:54:55.700 --> 00:54:58.000]   psilocybin being one of them,
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:00.460]   but some other treatments, MDMA, et cetera,
[00:55:00.460 --> 00:55:02.900]   that we'll parse each of these in detail,
[00:55:02.900 --> 00:55:05.140]   that lead to the exact opposite state
[00:55:05.140 --> 00:55:06.700]   during the effect of the drug,
[00:55:06.700 --> 00:55:11.060]   which is a highly engaged emotionality
[00:55:11.060 --> 00:55:12.980]   and heart rate and sense of self,
[00:55:12.980 --> 00:55:16.640]   and can also lead to relief of depression.
[00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:18.100]   Now, whether or not this, again,
[00:55:18.100 --> 00:55:20.700]   reflects that depression has many conditions
[00:55:20.700 --> 00:55:24.620]   as opposed to just one, or whether or not somehow tickling,
[00:55:24.620 --> 00:55:26.260]   or in some cases, pushing really hard
[00:55:26.260 --> 00:55:29.160]   on the opposite ends of the scale really matter.
[00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:30.780]   I am absolutely fascinated,
[00:55:30.780 --> 00:55:33.220]   and again, also perplexed by this.
[00:55:33.220 --> 00:55:37.520]   Why would it be that a drug that induces dissociative states
[00:55:37.520 --> 00:55:39.460]   and a drug taken separately
[00:55:39.460 --> 00:55:42.960]   that induces hyper associative states
[00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:45.100]   would lead to relief of the same condition?
[00:55:45.100 --> 00:55:46.900]   - Yeah, that's a great question.
[00:55:46.900 --> 00:55:51.900]   Yeah, so for ketamine, the level of dissociation
[00:55:51.900 --> 00:55:55.280]   appears to be correlated with the therapeutic effect.
[00:55:55.280 --> 00:55:57.960]   It appears to be necessary,
[00:55:57.960 --> 00:56:00.920]   but not sufficient to produce an antidepressant effect,
[00:56:00.920 --> 00:56:05.920]   and so folks that don't have any psychological change
[00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:10.580]   from the ketamine or don't experience any dissociation
[00:56:10.580 --> 00:56:14.080]   typically tend to have less potent
[00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:16.240]   antidepressant effects from ketamine.
[00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:17.700]   We did a study a couple of years ago,
[00:56:17.700 --> 00:56:18.540]   it was really interesting,
[00:56:18.540 --> 00:56:23.360]   so we gave folks naltrexone, which is an opiate antagonist,
[00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:26.400]   a mu and kappa opiate receptor antagonist,
[00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:31.180]   and we gave the same individuals a pill of that
[00:56:31.180 --> 00:56:32.400]   or a pill of placebo,
[00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:34.160]   and they had no idea which one they were getting.
[00:56:34.160 --> 00:56:35.760]   - Was this low dose naltrexone?
[00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:37.360]   - 50 milligrams, so it's pretty high dose.
[00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:38.200]   - Okay.
[00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:41.360]   - Yeah, and so we gave a typical ketamine therapeutic dose,
[00:56:41.360 --> 00:56:45.120]   and then we gave 50 milligrams of naltrexone or placebo,
[00:56:45.120 --> 00:56:46.960]   and then in the same individuals,
[00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:51.320]   we gave two infusions, one with each of those conditions,
[00:56:51.320 --> 00:56:53.200]   and if they had an antidepressant effect,
[00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:54.960]   we waited until they relapsed,
[00:56:54.960 --> 00:56:56.760]   and then we gave them the other condition,
[00:56:56.760 --> 00:56:58.760]   and then we looked to see
[00:56:58.760 --> 00:57:02.560]   what effect of blocking the opioid receptor,
[00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:05.640]   what effect would you see on the antidepressant effect
[00:57:05.640 --> 00:57:06.720]   of blocking the opioid receptor,
[00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:09.260]   with the idea that if ketamine works the way
[00:57:09.260 --> 00:57:11.980]   that a lot of researchers at the time thought
[00:57:11.980 --> 00:57:14.060]   that it completely worked in,
[00:57:14.060 --> 00:57:15.880]   which is the glutamate system,
[00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:19.280]   then you would have no effect of naltrexone,
[00:57:19.280 --> 00:57:21.800]   'cause naltrexone just interacts with the opiate system,
[00:57:21.800 --> 00:57:24.360]   it doesn't do anything with any other systems.
[00:57:24.360 --> 00:57:27.240]   Ketamine has a lot of effects over,
[00:57:27.240 --> 00:57:30.640]   it has clear opiate effects in mice
[00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:32.880]   and various ways of looking at that,
[00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:37.600]   and NMDA receptor antagonism and glutamate effects,
[00:57:37.600 --> 00:57:40.520]   and so if it's just that the glutamate part
[00:57:40.520 --> 00:57:44.000]   is the part driving the antidepressant effect,
[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:46.240]   you shouldn't have any difference
[00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:49.180]   in the antidepressant effect between the two conditions,
[00:57:49.180 --> 00:57:53.020]   if, however, the antidepressant effect is primarily,
[00:57:53.020 --> 00:57:58.020]   is the opioid properties of ketamine are necessary
[00:57:58.020 --> 00:57:59.780]   for the antidepressant effect,
[00:57:59.780 --> 00:58:02.420]   then you should have a loss of antidepressant effect
[00:58:02.420 --> 00:58:05.320]   during the ketamine plus naltrexone condition
[00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:08.940]   that you observed in the ketamine plus placebo condition,
[00:58:08.940 --> 00:58:13.940]   and what we saw was that there was a dramatic blockade
[00:58:13.940 --> 00:58:17.500]   of the antidepressant effect when naltrexone was present
[00:58:17.500 --> 00:58:22.500]   in the people that had an antidepressant effect
[00:58:22.500 --> 00:58:26.440]   with ketamine plus placebo alone,
[00:58:26.440 --> 00:58:31.440]   and then some friends of mine did a TMS study with pain
[00:58:31.440 --> 00:58:33.700]   and they stimulated over
[00:58:33.700 --> 00:58:35.440]   the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
[00:58:35.440 --> 00:58:37.240]   and they gave IV naloxone,
[00:58:37.240 --> 00:58:39.640]   which works basically the same way as naltrexone,
[00:58:39.640 --> 00:58:43.840]   and they were able to block the anti-pain effects of TMS
[00:58:43.840 --> 00:58:45.380]   with a opiate blocker,
[00:58:45.380 --> 00:58:49.460]   so this idea that, another kind of convergent point,
[00:58:49.460 --> 00:58:52.040]   this idea that the opioid receptor
[00:58:52.040 --> 00:58:55.440]   may have a role in mood regulation,
[00:58:55.440 --> 00:58:57.480]   what's also interesting is if you look at people
[00:58:57.480 --> 00:58:58.880]   that are getting a total knee operation,
[00:58:58.880 --> 00:59:03.140]   very painful operation, total knee replacement,
[00:59:03.140 --> 00:59:06.480]   and you age, sex, everything matched,
[00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:08.360]   the individuals that are going through that,
[00:59:08.360 --> 00:59:11.020]   but you have a group of people that don't have depression
[00:59:11.020 --> 00:59:13.100]   and a group of people that do have depression,
[00:59:13.100 --> 00:59:17.500]   the presence of depression triples the oral opioid dose
[00:59:17.500 --> 00:59:19.320]   by day four.
[00:59:19.320 --> 00:59:20.520]   - That's required.
[00:59:20.520 --> 00:59:22.960]   - That's required to cover the pain,
[00:59:22.960 --> 00:59:24.000]   but what may be happening
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:26.360]   is it's not just treating physical pain,
[00:59:26.360 --> 00:59:28.500]   maybe treating emotional pain as well, right?
[00:59:28.500 --> 00:59:31.560]   At least transiently, it seems to have a pro,
[00:59:31.560 --> 00:59:32.800]   an antidepressant effect.
[00:59:32.800 --> 00:59:35.520]   Chronically, it seems to have a very pro-depressant effect
[00:59:35.520 --> 00:59:37.760]   that can make people treatment resistant,
[00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:40.400]   but it's an interesting phenomenon,
[00:59:40.400 --> 00:59:43.880]   but yeah, the opioid system seems to be pretty involved,
[00:59:43.880 --> 00:59:47.420]   but what's interesting there with the ketamine trial
[00:59:47.420 --> 00:59:50.960]   is that we didn't see any effect on the dissociation,
[00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:54.700]   and so the dissociation was the same each time,
[00:59:54.700 --> 00:59:57.800]   so the psychological effect of what we call the TRIP
[00:59:57.800 --> 01:00:00.100]   or the kind of dissociative effect
[01:00:00.100 --> 01:00:02.380]   where people are having a psychological phenomenon
[01:00:02.380 --> 01:00:06.140]   from ketamine, that was identical both times,
[01:00:06.140 --> 01:00:10.380]   and so it also challenged this idea
[01:00:10.380 --> 01:00:14.620]   that the psychological experience of the psychedelic effect
[01:00:14.620 --> 01:00:17.860]   may be all that's necessary to produce an effect,
[01:00:17.860 --> 01:00:20.100]   and that the pharmacology doesn't matter
[01:00:20.100 --> 01:00:22.500]   as long as you can achieve that state,
[01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:26.420]   and so we think we pretty clearly debunked that idea
[01:00:26.420 --> 01:00:29.540]   that the underlying pharmacology and the state
[01:00:29.540 --> 01:00:33.460]   seem to be important.
[01:00:33.460 --> 01:00:36.140]   We don't know for sure if you can, and a lot of people
[01:00:36.140 --> 01:00:38.380]   are working on this, if you can take out
[01:00:38.380 --> 01:00:39.940]   essentially the psychological effect
[01:00:39.940 --> 01:00:44.180]   and still have a drug that works to treat the illness
[01:00:44.180 --> 01:00:45.260]   that you're trying to target,
[01:00:45.260 --> 01:00:48.260]   and there was a mouse study out this week
[01:00:48.260 --> 01:00:50.460]   where they had an LSD analog,
[01:00:50.460 --> 01:00:54.900]   and they were able to see some animal level data
[01:00:54.900 --> 01:00:56.220]   to suggest that could be true,
[01:00:56.220 --> 01:00:58.500]   but until we figure that out in humans,
[01:00:58.500 --> 01:01:02.760]   it's kind of to be determined, but it is curious, right,
[01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:06.360]   being able to kind of use experimental manipulations
[01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:10.580]   to try to separate some of these phenomenon apart
[01:01:10.580 --> 01:01:13.020]   and really understand what's doing what.
[01:01:13.020 --> 01:01:14.740]   - It's so critical, and it's so critical
[01:01:14.740 --> 01:01:18.040]   to the other conversation that we'll surely get to,
[01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:20.900]   which is the progression of psychedelics
[01:01:20.900 --> 01:01:25.640]   from illicit illegal drugs to clinically validated
[01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:27.080]   and presumably at some point,
[01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:29.480]   either decriminalized or legal drugs,
[01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:33.260]   which has not yet happened, at least not in the US,
[01:01:33.260 --> 01:01:36.020]   but just to make sure that people are getting this
[01:01:36.020 --> 01:01:38.760]   and how crucial this is.
[01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:42.340]   What we're really talking about here is the fact that,
[01:01:42.340 --> 01:01:46.400]   you know, somebody takes a multigram dose of psilocybin,
[01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:50.140]   or somebody takes MDMA, or they take ketamine,
[01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:51.980]   and they experience relief from their trauma,
[01:01:51.980 --> 01:01:53.400]   their depression, their addiction,
[01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:55.300]   or any number of the other things that indeed
[01:01:55.300 --> 01:01:56.980]   those compounds have been shown to be useful for
[01:01:56.980 --> 01:02:00.860]   in certain contexts, clinically supported, et cetera.
[01:02:00.860 --> 01:02:04.040]   There's this gravitational pull to the idea that,
[01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:06.040]   oh, it was the hallucinations.
[01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:07.980]   It was the dissociative state.
[01:02:07.980 --> 01:02:10.240]   It was the feeling of connectedness.
[01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:11.700]   And what we're really saying is that
[01:02:11.700 --> 01:02:14.280]   while that certainly could be true,
[01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:16.900]   it may be the case that a major source
[01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:18.700]   of the positive shift that occurs
[01:02:18.700 --> 01:02:23.060]   after the effect of the drug is some underlying biology
[01:02:23.060 --> 01:02:25.460]   like shifts in the mu opioid receptor,
[01:02:25.460 --> 01:02:27.780]   a lot of your experiments with naltrexone,
[01:02:27.780 --> 01:02:30.220]   or a change in the underlying neuromodulation
[01:02:30.220 --> 01:02:33.700]   that had anywhere from nothing
[01:02:33.700 --> 01:02:36.620]   to something to do with the real shift.
[01:02:36.620 --> 01:02:38.900]   And I know there's a group up at UC Davis
[01:02:38.900 --> 01:02:42.340]   that published a paper in "Nature" about a year ago,
[01:02:42.340 --> 01:02:45.020]   also looking at, these are,
[01:02:45.020 --> 01:02:48.060]   is a chemistry lab essentially modifying psychedelics
[01:02:48.060 --> 01:02:51.160]   to remove the hallucinogenic properties,
[01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:52.420]   the mood-altering properties,
[01:02:52.420 --> 01:02:54.500]   and actually seeing some pretty impressive effects
[01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:57.680]   and shifts in mood after the drug wears off.
[01:02:57.680 --> 01:03:00.800]   And I know this gets people upset when they hear it.
[01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:03.540]   A lot of people, this gets a lot of people upset really
[01:03:03.540 --> 01:03:04.380]   because people think,
[01:03:04.380 --> 01:03:07.460]   oh no, it's the intense experience that matters.
[01:03:07.460 --> 01:03:12.460]   But in fact, that may not be the case at all.
[01:03:12.460 --> 01:03:14.740]   In fact, it's so powerful for people
[01:03:14.740 --> 01:03:17.040]   that sometimes I liken it in my mind to,
[01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:17.880]   you know, it's like somebody,
[01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:19.380]   it's like the birth of a new child
[01:03:19.380 --> 01:03:21.300]   and it's such an incredible experience.
[01:03:21.300 --> 01:03:22.820]   And then people feel so much connection
[01:03:22.820 --> 01:03:25.060]   and then they sort of connect the experience
[01:03:25.060 --> 01:03:26.840]   of the actual birth to the connection
[01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:28.900]   when in fact that's true, it turns out,
[01:03:28.900 --> 01:03:31.060]   but there are a bunch of other things happening too
[01:03:31.060 --> 01:03:33.160]   that's simply the reflection of the fact
[01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:34.180]   that you're holding a child
[01:03:34.180 --> 01:03:35.780]   and the pheromonal effects, et cetera.
[01:03:35.780 --> 01:03:38.780]   So anyway, I think it's very important
[01:03:38.780 --> 01:03:43.780]   that these different variables be figured out.
[01:03:43.780 --> 01:03:46.140]   Along those lines, I want to make sure
[01:03:46.140 --> 01:03:49.660]   that before we dive a bit deeper into ketamine and psilocybin
[01:03:50.540 --> 01:03:53.740]   that we do touch on a really important topic
[01:03:53.740 --> 01:03:56.100]   that has been in the press a lot lately,
[01:03:56.100 --> 01:03:59.060]   which is SSRI, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,
[01:03:59.060 --> 01:04:01.140]   'cause we can't really have a discussion about depression
[01:04:01.140 --> 01:04:02.660]   without talking about SSRI's.
[01:04:02.660 --> 01:04:05.600]   And then I want to circle back to ketamine and psilocybin.
[01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:10.100]   It seems that there are now data
[01:04:10.100 --> 01:04:14.740]   that essentially state that there's no direct link
[01:04:14.740 --> 01:04:18.460]   between serotonin levels and depression.
[01:04:18.460 --> 01:04:22.380]   Although my understanding is that the SSRI's
[01:04:22.380 --> 01:04:24.500]   are powerfully effective for certain forms
[01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:26.760]   of obsessive compulsive disorder
[01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:29.380]   and may also be effective for treatment of depression,
[01:04:29.380 --> 01:04:31.660]   but it may again be through some effect
[01:04:31.660 --> 01:04:33.540]   unrelated to serotonin itself.
[01:04:33.540 --> 01:04:34.360]   Is that right?
[01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:35.820]   And how should we think about SSRI's?
[01:04:35.820 --> 01:04:36.660]   Are they useful?
[01:04:36.660 --> 01:04:37.540]   Are they not useful?
[01:04:37.540 --> 01:04:41.820]   What's going on with SSRI's in your patients
[01:04:41.820 --> 01:04:44.180]   and in other people as well?
[01:04:44.180 --> 01:04:48.020]   - Yeah, the experiment that I described a bit ago
[01:04:48.020 --> 01:04:51.220]   around the naltrexone and ketamine
[01:04:51.220 --> 01:04:54.020]   is the first time I'm aware of where we were able
[01:04:54.020 --> 01:04:58.120]   to essentially eliminate an antidepressants effect
[01:04:58.120 --> 01:05:01.740]   by using a second drug as kind of a blockade.
[01:05:01.740 --> 01:05:03.900]   And it highlights a bigger issue, right?
[01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:07.240]   The issue that we haven't had a good way
[01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:10.760]   of really understanding how these drugs work.
[01:05:10.760 --> 01:05:12.300]   And so it's the difference,
[01:05:12.300 --> 01:05:14.540]   I think a lot of the controversy there
[01:05:14.540 --> 01:05:19.420]   is that it's been difficult I think for folks
[01:05:19.420 --> 01:05:24.340]   to see that something can in one hand work
[01:05:24.340 --> 01:05:27.380]   and in the other hand we don't know how it works, right?
[01:05:27.380 --> 01:05:31.100]   And so SSRI's clearly work.
[01:05:31.100 --> 01:05:36.420]   Many, many meta-analyses kind of proving that out, right?
[01:05:36.420 --> 01:05:39.140]   That in a sub-population of individuals
[01:05:39.140 --> 01:05:41.200]   they achieve great benefit.
[01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:45.560]   From depression, for depression, for obsessive compulsive
[01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:48.760]   disorder, for generalized anxiety disorder, panic,
[01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:51.400]   all these things you can see an improvement
[01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:54.920]   in those symptoms with what we call SSRI's
[01:05:54.920 --> 01:05:57.000]   or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
[01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:00.600]   The issue there is that these selective serotonin
[01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:05.120]   reuptake inhibitors end up blocking the reuptake
[01:06:05.120 --> 01:06:08.240]   of serotonin and leaving the serotonin
[01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:13.240]   in this kind of in between two neurons for a while
[01:06:13.240 --> 01:06:17.440]   and allowing for more serotonin to kind of be there.
[01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:21.940]   The issue is that they don't work immediately, right?
[01:06:21.940 --> 01:06:25.640]   So they don't work like the same day you start taking them.
[01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:29.480]   And that suggests that probably it's not exactly
[01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:33.020]   the serotonin being in there that's directly driving it,
[01:06:33.020 --> 01:06:35.440]   that it's much more likely that it may have
[01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:38.780]   some say brain plasticity effects, right?
[01:06:38.780 --> 01:06:43.260]   We know that things like brain derived neurotrophic factor
[01:06:43.260 --> 01:06:47.560]   get upregulated with chronic oral anti-depressant use.
[01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:52.560]   And so that's kind of the idea is that these things work
[01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:56.400]   but what's powerful, and I think with the authors
[01:06:56.400 --> 01:07:00.160]   of this paper, it was extremely controversial paper,
[01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:05.160]   we're in part trying to say was that there's not a,
[01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:07.600]   there's not a deficit of serotonin.
[01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:12.040]   You're not born with what people call a chemical imbalance.
[01:07:12.040 --> 01:07:13.240]   And psychiatry has known this.
[01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:15.920]   This is not actually new information to anybody.
[01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:19.100]   It's kind of a rehashing of a bunch of information
[01:07:19.100 --> 01:07:21.920]   we've known for a while now but in the lay press
[01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:24.320]   it's kind of hit in a way that it didn't seem
[01:07:24.320 --> 01:07:29.240]   to grab attention before with previous publications
[01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:32.760]   but this idea that this chemical imbalance idea is wrong.
[01:07:34.140 --> 01:07:36.900]   I really think that part's important
[01:07:36.900 --> 01:07:41.900]   because I think that for a while I think psychiatry,
[01:07:41.900 --> 01:07:47.880]   what I'll call psychiatry 1.0, this kind of idea of Freud
[01:07:47.880 --> 01:07:50.460]   and psychotherapy and its origins,
[01:07:50.460 --> 01:07:55.800]   it was a lot around your family and those experiences
[01:07:55.800 --> 01:07:58.620]   and psychotherapy kind of going in and correcting
[01:07:58.620 --> 01:08:03.620]   or helping you to figure out or show you being able to see
[01:08:03.720 --> 01:08:06.080]   or people hear you so that you can eventually come
[01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:09.700]   to the conclusion of certain cognitions
[01:08:09.700 --> 01:08:11.220]   that aren't helping you.
[01:08:11.220 --> 01:08:15.220]   And there's a huge importance there but there's a history
[01:08:15.220 --> 01:08:18.300]   where things like the schizophrenogenic mother
[01:08:18.300 --> 01:08:21.240]   and all of that, that was a concept at some point.
[01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:25.440]   And so we've transitioned from that to for a long time
[01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:30.240]   the chemical imbalance which I'll call psychiatry 2.0,
[01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:34.280]   this idea that there's something chemically missing.
[01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:40.840]   And I think that the trouble there for a patient
[01:08:40.840 --> 01:08:44.620]   who's not a physician, who's not someone
[01:08:44.620 --> 01:08:49.620]   who's steeped in these sorts of ideas,
[01:08:49.620 --> 01:08:54.780]   who's more of a kind of average American out there
[01:08:56.800 --> 01:09:01.100]   is that it's sending a message of there's something missing
[01:09:01.100 --> 01:09:04.560]   with me, whether it be my experiences I had no control of
[01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:08.620]   over when I was a child or a chemical in my brain.
[01:09:08.620 --> 01:09:11.860]   What I think is really powerful with TMS,
[01:09:11.860 --> 01:09:16.700]   really powerful TMS and a lovely even powerful
[01:09:16.700 --> 01:09:20.700]   the psychedelic story is it's saying something different.
[01:09:20.700 --> 01:09:24.460]   You know, TMS works and there's no serotonin coming in
[01:09:24.460 --> 01:09:27.480]   or out of the brain, right, and we're doing a rapid form
[01:09:27.480 --> 01:09:29.860]   of TMS that works in one to five days.
[01:09:29.860 --> 01:09:33.960]   There's no, it's very unlikely that there's some long-term
[01:09:33.960 --> 01:09:36.720]   kind of upregulation of serotonin that's driving that.
[01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:39.200]   So our work actually kind of pushes back
[01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:42.780]   on this serotonin hypothesis as being kind of the center
[01:09:42.780 --> 01:09:45.440]   of depression because it says, look, we're not giving
[01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:48.120]   anybody any serotonin, we're simply turning
[01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:51.940]   these brain regions on and we're focused on the circuitry.
[01:09:51.940 --> 01:09:54.000]   And that's psychiatry 3.0, it's not just like
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:57.800]   neuromodulation, neuromodulation's a really nice use case
[01:09:57.800 --> 01:10:00.700]   for psychiatry 3.0 'cause it's a way to focally
[01:10:00.700 --> 01:10:03.000]   and directly perturb brain regions
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.500]   in whatever modality you're using.
[01:10:05.500 --> 01:10:08.700]   But there are a lot of groups that are actually doing
[01:10:08.700 --> 01:10:11.220]   neuroimaging before and after and they're able to see
[01:10:11.220 --> 01:10:14.440]   circuit level changes for something like psilocybin
[01:10:14.440 --> 01:10:18.500]   or ketamine long after the drug is gone, right,
[01:10:18.500 --> 01:10:22.260]   suggesting in those same brain regions converge
[01:10:22.260 --> 01:10:24.500]   so the subgenual default mode network connection
[01:10:24.500 --> 01:10:29.020]   that we see is changing with our Stanford neuromodulation
[01:10:29.020 --> 01:10:32.860]   therapy technique, it's that same set of brain regions
[01:10:32.860 --> 01:10:36.900]   that ketamine and psilocybin seem to act on,
[01:10:36.900 --> 01:10:40.260]   act on these connections between brain networks
[01:10:40.260 --> 01:10:41.780]   that seem to shift.
[01:10:41.780 --> 01:10:45.940]   And so it refocuses the story on something
[01:10:45.940 --> 01:10:49.740]   that's highly correctable and it's basically
[01:10:49.740 --> 01:10:53.100]   electrophysiology and it's basically
[01:10:53.100 --> 01:10:58.100]   kind of recalibrating a circuit that is recalibratable
[01:10:58.100 --> 01:11:00.860]   instead of I have something missing
[01:11:00.860 --> 01:11:04.980]   or I have some set of experiences early in life
[01:11:04.980 --> 01:11:08.060]   that are gonna forever trap me
[01:11:08.060 --> 01:11:10.300]   in these psychiatric diagnoses.
[01:11:10.300 --> 01:11:12.060]   And so it kind of challenges that idea
[01:11:12.060 --> 01:11:16.500]   and I think that's what's so powerful about psychiatry 3.0,
[01:11:16.500 --> 01:11:18.300]   this idea of focusing on the circuit
[01:11:18.300 --> 01:11:21.620]   because it gets us into thinking about psychiatry
[01:11:21.620 --> 01:11:25.420]   and psychiatric illnesses as something that are recoverable.
[01:11:25.420 --> 01:11:29.060]   People can get better, we've seen with our TMS techniques,
[01:11:29.060 --> 01:11:30.740]   we've seen it with some of the psychedelic work
[01:11:30.740 --> 01:11:34.780]   that we've done where people are actually in normal levels
[01:11:34.780 --> 01:11:37.300]   of mood for sustained periods of time or--
[01:11:37.300 --> 01:11:38.260]   - Within five days.
[01:11:38.260 --> 01:11:41.220]   - Within five or less days and in the case of the
[01:11:41.220 --> 01:11:42.980]   psychedelics within a few days, right?
[01:11:42.980 --> 01:11:46.140]   So we can get people out of these states,
[01:11:46.140 --> 01:11:48.820]   they're totally well, there's no drug in their system
[01:11:48.820 --> 01:11:50.500]   at that point, in the case of psychedelics,
[01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:54.300]   it was never a drug in their system in the case of TMS
[01:11:54.300 --> 01:11:57.980]   and it just tells us that it's fixable,
[01:11:57.980 --> 01:12:01.020]   it's just like the heart, it's just like an arrhythmia
[01:12:01.020 --> 01:12:03.740]   in the heart, it's just like these other illnesses
[01:12:03.740 --> 01:12:06.820]   that it's like a broken leg, we can go in and do something
[01:12:06.820 --> 01:12:08.460]   and we can get somebody better.
[01:12:08.460 --> 01:12:11.740]   Then I think what's empowering and what a lot of patients
[01:12:11.740 --> 01:12:14.540]   have told me is they say, I've gotten to,
[01:12:14.540 --> 01:12:17.580]   some people will relapse and need more stimulation
[01:12:17.580 --> 01:12:19.820]   or need more psychedelics or whatever it is
[01:12:19.820 --> 01:12:24.300]   but they'll tell me, I've relapsed and I'm depressed again
[01:12:24.300 --> 01:12:26.680]   but I'll never think about killing myself again
[01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:31.460]   because I know that if I go get stimulated again,
[01:12:31.460 --> 01:12:35.500]   it improves, it gets better, I will be able to re-achieve it
[01:12:35.500 --> 01:12:39.460]   and I can't, and I don't fear that I'm chronically broken,
[01:12:39.460 --> 01:12:42.380]   I don't fear that the chemical imbalance
[01:12:42.380 --> 01:12:45.320]   is still imbalanced, I don't fear that these things
[01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:47.820]   that I couldn't control in my childhood
[01:12:47.820 --> 01:12:50.580]   are gonna be there and drive this problem forever
[01:12:50.580 --> 01:12:53.740]   and I think that's what's so powerful about this.
[01:12:53.740 --> 01:12:54.760]   - The sense of control.
[01:12:54.760 --> 01:12:56.540]   - The sense of control, the sense of,
[01:12:56.540 --> 01:12:58.700]   they're not doing the stimulation themselves,
[01:12:58.700 --> 01:13:01.460]   they're not administering the drug in these trials themselves
[01:13:01.460 --> 01:13:02.460]   and they probably never will,
[01:13:02.460 --> 01:13:04.500]   these will probably be medical treatments
[01:13:04.500 --> 01:13:06.420]   but they are choosing to do it
[01:13:06.420 --> 01:13:08.700]   and in that sense, they are in control.
[01:13:08.700 --> 01:13:12.180]   - Yeah, I have a good friend, I won't out him for reasons,
[01:13:12.180 --> 01:13:13.140]   they'll become clear in a moment,
[01:13:13.140 --> 01:13:18.140]   who was quite obese and lost a lot of weight
[01:13:18.140 --> 01:13:20.100]   and was really proud of himself
[01:13:20.100 --> 01:13:22.900]   and then I guess we could say he sort of relapsed in a sense,
[01:13:22.900 --> 01:13:26.420]   not all the way but far along
[01:13:26.420 --> 01:13:28.660]   but his tone around it was very different.
[01:13:28.660 --> 01:13:32.300]   He knew he had accomplished his goal once before,
[01:13:32.300 --> 01:13:33.700]   he was disappointed in himself
[01:13:33.700 --> 01:13:37.500]   but he knew exactly why he had relapsed, it was very clear,
[01:13:37.500 --> 01:13:39.740]   he had essentially relapsed to the previous set
[01:13:39.740 --> 01:13:42.820]   of eating behaviors and lack of exercise behaviors
[01:13:42.820 --> 01:13:44.740]   and has now brought himself back again
[01:13:44.740 --> 01:13:49.420]   and it just resonates with your story
[01:13:49.420 --> 01:13:51.580]   that once somebody understands they can do it
[01:13:51.580 --> 01:13:52.860]   because they've been there before,
[01:13:52.860 --> 01:13:56.200]   this idea again of considering new rules.
[01:13:56.200 --> 01:14:01.180]   And that brings me to this question about psychedelics
[01:14:01.180 --> 01:14:04.420]   and frankly, the altered thinking and perception
[01:14:04.420 --> 01:14:09.420]   that occurs in high dose psilocybin clinical sessions
[01:14:10.380 --> 01:14:12.800]   it seems that the disordered thinking
[01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:16.040]   even though it could be random, right?
[01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:19.240]   Hearing colors and seeing sounds is always
[01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:22.540]   the kind of cliche statement of the Timothy Leary area.
[01:14:22.540 --> 01:14:26.900]   Also, right there, that's a Stroop task of sorts.
[01:14:26.900 --> 01:14:29.740]   It's a synesthesia, it's a combining of perceptions
[01:14:29.740 --> 01:14:32.260]   but it's sort of Stroop task-ish
[01:14:32.260 --> 01:14:36.860]   in that it's a new set of rules for the same stuff, right?
[01:14:36.860 --> 01:14:41.820]   And people do, many people do report improvements
[01:14:41.820 --> 01:14:45.180]   in trauma-related symptomology and depression
[01:14:45.180 --> 01:14:47.720]   as I understand it from my read of the clinical trials
[01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:50.020]   after taking psilocybin because during those sessions
[01:14:50.020 --> 01:14:53.420]   something comes to mind spontaneously
[01:14:53.420 --> 01:14:56.220]   as you and I were talking about earlier,
[01:14:56.220 --> 01:14:59.100]   they will report for instance a new way
[01:14:59.100 --> 01:15:01.760]   of seeing the old problem and the old problem
[01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:03.140]   could be the voice that they're no good,
[01:15:03.140 --> 01:15:04.900]   they'll never, nothing will ever work out
[01:15:04.900 --> 01:15:06.960]   or could be even more subtle than that.
[01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:09.620]   So that raises two questions.
[01:15:09.620 --> 01:15:13.420]   One is about the basic functioning of the human brain
[01:15:13.420 --> 01:15:18.420]   which is why do you think the brain would ever hold on
[01:15:18.420 --> 01:15:22.620]   to rules that don't serve us well?
[01:15:22.620 --> 01:15:23.820]   That's one question.
[01:15:23.820 --> 01:15:27.940]   And then the second question is what is it
[01:15:27.940 --> 01:15:30.620]   about psilocybin and related molecules
[01:15:30.620 --> 01:15:32.060]   in terms of their neurochemistry,
[01:15:32.060 --> 01:15:35.060]   in terms of the ways they disrupt thinking and feeling,
[01:15:35.060 --> 01:15:37.540]   et cetera, during the session
[01:15:37.540 --> 01:15:42.540]   that allow this novel rule consideration phenomenon?
[01:15:42.540 --> 01:15:45.980]   - Yeah, so the first question,
[01:15:45.980 --> 01:15:50.980]   I think it's an evolutionary neurobiology answer, right?
[01:15:50.980 --> 01:15:55.220]   I think that at the individual person level,
[01:15:55.220 --> 01:15:56.840]   you know, it doesn't make a whole lot of sense
[01:15:56.840 --> 01:15:58.100]   that when we're really stressed out
[01:15:58.100 --> 01:15:59.840]   some of us want to eat more, right,
[01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:01.580]   at the individual person level
[01:16:01.580 --> 01:16:03.760]   'cause it's like that's not particularly that good
[01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:06.300]   for my health in the long term.
[01:16:06.300 --> 01:16:08.820]   But if you think about it like, you know,
[01:16:08.820 --> 01:16:12.100]   in some 500 years ago, 1,000 years ago,
[01:16:12.100 --> 01:16:14.400]   if I'm highly stressed out, it's most likely
[01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:16.940]   that I'm about to not have food at some point
[01:16:16.940 --> 01:16:19.100]   and I should eat a bunch of food that is high fat,
[01:16:19.100 --> 01:16:21.940]   high sugar, high carb food to put on weight
[01:16:21.940 --> 01:16:25.620]   for that next phase where in this stress,
[01:16:25.620 --> 01:16:27.900]   I may be in battle and I don't have food
[01:16:27.900 --> 01:16:30.220]   and I have enough fuel on board, right?
[01:16:30.220 --> 01:16:33.460]   And so we end up being a, you know,
[01:16:33.460 --> 01:16:36.740]   we end up being a result of probably a lot of biology
[01:16:36.740 --> 01:16:39.140]   that's not that useful in the modern era
[01:16:39.140 --> 01:16:42.900]   and I think in the brain for, let's say, PTSD, right?
[01:16:42.900 --> 01:16:44.700]   A lot of veterans come back
[01:16:44.700 --> 01:16:46.460]   and they experience these PTSD symptoms
[01:16:46.460 --> 01:16:50.260]   and they're not at all useful back home, right?
[01:16:50.260 --> 01:16:53.020]   You know, they hear some loud noise
[01:16:53.020 --> 01:16:54.660]   and all of a sudden they're behind a car
[01:16:54.660 --> 01:16:57.420]   or they're behind a, you know, I've heard of folks,
[01:16:57.420 --> 01:16:59.520]   jump and run behind a trash can or whatever
[01:16:59.520 --> 01:17:02.960]   in the middle of San Francisco when they hear a loud noise
[01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:05.800]   but if you put them back in the battlefield--
[01:17:05.800 --> 01:17:07.920]   - Highly adaptive.
[01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:09.180]   - That's highly adaptive, right?
[01:17:09.180 --> 01:17:14.180]   And so I think what's interesting is that we,
[01:17:14.180 --> 01:17:22.080]   in the absence of using substances like psychedelics,
[01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:26.540]   end up having these very persistent memories
[01:17:26.540 --> 01:17:29.100]   that are attached to negatively balanced emotion
[01:17:29.100 --> 01:17:31.720]   predominantly, as you were saying earlier,
[01:17:31.720 --> 01:17:34.560]   the jacket in elementary school, you know,
[01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:36.620]   I had various things like that for me too, right?
[01:17:36.620 --> 01:17:41.620]   You remember these things and we hold onto those things
[01:17:41.620 --> 01:17:46.320]   from I think an evolutionary neurobiology standpoint
[01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:50.060]   but what seems to, for whatever reason,
[01:17:50.060 --> 01:17:55.060]   kind of alleviate that are these substances,
[01:17:55.060 --> 01:17:58.660]   some new like MDMA, some that have been around
[01:17:58.660 --> 01:18:00.980]   for thousands of years like psilocybin
[01:18:00.980 --> 01:18:05.980]   and used as a sacrament in traditions
[01:18:05.980 --> 01:18:12.600]   seem to have a therapeutic effect
[01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:15.220]   that seems to be pretty long lasting for these phenomenon
[01:18:15.220 --> 01:18:17.560]   and so it's just curious, right?
[01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:22.560]   It's curious that in the absence of that,
[01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:24.660]   these things will keep going on and on
[01:18:24.660 --> 01:18:28.320]   but in the presence of that exposure,
[01:18:28.320 --> 01:18:31.540]   then all of a sudden you see a resolution of the problem
[01:18:31.540 --> 01:18:32.660]   and we have some work now.
[01:18:32.660 --> 01:18:34.980]   We're treating folks with Navy Seals
[01:18:34.980 --> 01:18:37.620]   and the data's still being, you know, being analyzed
[01:18:37.620 --> 01:18:39.900]   but the anecdotes that we're getting, right,
[01:18:39.900 --> 01:18:41.060]   are folks are coming back
[01:18:41.060 --> 01:18:44.200]   and they're saying it's finally gone, right?
[01:18:44.200 --> 01:18:48.320]   This kind of, these set of PTSD symptoms are finally gone
[01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:51.340]   and so this idea that for whatever reason,
[01:18:51.340 --> 01:18:54.020]   going into what's probably a highly plastic state
[01:18:54.020 --> 01:18:54.980]   like we were talking about earlier,
[01:18:54.980 --> 01:18:57.220]   upregulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor
[01:18:57.220 --> 01:19:01.260]   in the case of Ibogaine, glial-derived neurotrophic factor,
[01:19:01.260 --> 01:19:04.180]   this highly plastic state and the ability
[01:19:04.180 --> 01:19:07.760]   to kind of re-experience memories
[01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:12.620]   and then, as you know, we always re-consolidate a memory.
[01:19:12.620 --> 01:19:14.660]   When we bring it back up, we always re-consolidate,
[01:19:14.660 --> 01:19:17.340]   but re-consolidating it in that state,
[01:19:17.340 --> 01:19:22.340]   for whatever reason, may drive a therapeutic effect.
[01:19:22.340 --> 01:19:27.040]   And, you know, the jury's still out.
[01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:30.660]   I'm a, I would say that I'm kind of a,
[01:19:30.660 --> 01:19:35.140]   I'm an agnostic to what tool I'm using kind of guy.
[01:19:35.140 --> 01:19:38.760]   Like, I'm, my business is to find treatments
[01:19:38.760 --> 01:19:41.940]   that help people and so I'm much more, like,
[01:19:41.940 --> 01:19:43.440]   pragmatic about it, you know?
[01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:48.440]   If this sort of thing, which has a lot of cultural baggage,
[01:19:48.440 --> 01:19:51.760]   but if this sort of thing ultimately ends up
[01:19:51.760 --> 01:19:53.660]   being therapeutic, if we can design trials
[01:19:53.660 --> 01:19:56.400]   that convince me and others that it is,
[01:19:56.400 --> 01:19:58.600]   then we should absolutely use it, you know?
[01:19:58.600 --> 01:20:03.600]   And if it doesn't, then we clearly shouldn't use it, right?
[01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:06.860]   And I think that's a big, that's a big question
[01:20:06.860 --> 01:20:08.040]   the field's going to have to work out.
[01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:10.100]   We have a hard time blinding these trials
[01:20:10.100 --> 01:20:14.740]   because the placebo condition is not easy to pull off,
[01:20:14.740 --> 01:20:16.020]   obviously. - Right, a placebo
[01:20:16.020 --> 01:20:18.960]   for a psilocybin journey is hard to imagine.
[01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:22.060]   - We've got, you know, we've been thinking about this
[01:20:22.060 --> 01:20:24.500]   and maybe that ketamine study
[01:20:24.500 --> 01:20:25.460]   that I was talking about earlier,
[01:20:25.460 --> 01:20:28.260]   if we could give people naltrexone and ketamine,
[01:20:28.260 --> 01:20:30.000]   maybe that's a good, you know,
[01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:33.220]   a good sort of placebo condition, right?
[01:20:33.220 --> 01:20:34.600]   'Cause we know that we can block
[01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:36.820]   any of the actual antidepressant effects of ketamine,
[01:20:36.820 --> 01:20:38.700]   they can still have an experience, you know?
[01:20:38.700 --> 01:20:40.460]   So that's one way of doing it,
[01:20:40.460 --> 01:20:42.140]   but thinking about ways to do that
[01:20:42.140 --> 01:20:43.860]   and really kind of proving this out
[01:20:43.860 --> 01:20:48.020]   and that's been, yeah, I think that's been kind of central
[01:20:48.020 --> 01:20:50.400]   to the way I've been thinking about this.
[01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:53.220]   But yeah, I think there's the work that's been done so far,
[01:20:53.220 --> 01:20:57.300]   the first psilocybin trial, the first MDMA trial
[01:20:57.300 --> 01:20:59.760]   is published in "Azure Medicine" recently.
[01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:01.220]   - And what do those generally say?
[01:21:01.220 --> 01:21:04.260]   I mean, that they are effective for a number of people
[01:21:04.260 --> 01:21:06.340]   after one session, two sessions,
[01:21:06.340 --> 01:21:08.340]   but what's sort of the general contour?
[01:21:08.340 --> 01:21:11.300]   Let's start with psilocybin and MDMA.
[01:21:11.300 --> 01:21:14.900]   - Yeah, so MDMA appears to in, you know,
[01:21:14.900 --> 01:21:18.880]   one to a few MDMA sessions have an anti-PTSD effect
[01:21:18.880 --> 01:21:23.880]   that seems to be, you know, outside of the kind of standard
[01:21:23.880 --> 01:21:28.020]   assumed levels of PTSD improvement that you can observe
[01:21:28.020 --> 01:21:31.280]   in individuals with this level of PTSD, right?
[01:21:31.280 --> 01:21:33.120]   So what we call the effect size,
[01:21:33.120 --> 01:21:37.320]   which is essentially like a measure,
[01:21:37.320 --> 01:21:38.620]   a co-intensity effect size,
[01:21:38.620 --> 01:21:41.360]   a measure that allows for you to compare
[01:21:41.360 --> 01:21:42.480]   different treatments to each other
[01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:44.000]   for different conditions that are, you know,
[01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:47.440]   agnostic to what the actual illness is, you know?
[01:21:47.440 --> 01:21:51.200]   The effect sizes there, you know, approach effect sizes,
[01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:52.740]   the things that are pretty effective,
[01:21:52.740 --> 01:21:55.760]   like antacids for heartburn, right?
[01:21:55.760 --> 01:21:59.040]   And you see that with MDMA treatment.
[01:21:59.040 --> 01:22:02.320]   - So does that mean that for people that have trauma
[01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:04.220]   who do a, and again, we're talking about
[01:22:04.220 --> 01:22:08.400]   in a clinical setting, they take one or two doses of MDMA,
[01:22:08.400 --> 01:22:12.360]   I think the standard MAPS dose is 150 to 75 milligrams,
[01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:14.240]   again, doing this with a physician, et cetera,
[01:22:14.240 --> 01:22:16.260]   controlled clinical trial, legal.
[01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:18.160]   - Yep, exactly.
[01:22:18.160 --> 01:22:20.220]   - They do it once or twice.
[01:22:20.220 --> 01:22:23.240]   And broadly speaking, what percentage of people
[01:22:23.240 --> 01:22:26.120]   who had trauma report feeling significant relief
[01:22:26.120 --> 01:22:28.720]   from their trauma afterward?
[01:22:28.720 --> 01:22:29.980]   - It's about two thirds of people
[01:22:29.980 --> 01:22:34.980]   had a clinically significant change in their PTSD.
[01:22:34.980 --> 01:22:36.440]   - That's impressive.
[01:22:36.440 --> 01:22:37.360]   - Which is impressive, right?
[01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:39.020]   - And how long lasting was that?
[01:22:39.020 --> 01:22:41.800]   I mean, these trials were ended pretty recently, so.
[01:22:41.800 --> 01:22:43.120]   - It appears to last for a while.
[01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:45.040]   In the earlier trials where they followed people out,
[01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:47.280]   it seemed to last for kind of in the years range
[01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:48.120]   for some people.
[01:22:48.120 --> 01:22:52.080]   And so it's pretty compelling.
[01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:55.680]   Psilocybin, in contrast to it with ketamine,
[01:22:55.680 --> 01:22:58.200]   which only on average lasts about a week and a half
[01:22:58.200 --> 01:23:00.180]   for a single infusion.
[01:23:00.180 --> 01:23:01.760]   So it's a much shorter.
[01:23:01.760 --> 01:23:03.800]   - So they have to get repeated infusions of ketamine
[01:23:03.800 --> 01:23:05.960]   every 10 days or so?
[01:23:05.960 --> 01:23:07.780]   - Yeah. - Forever?
[01:23:07.780 --> 01:23:09.520]   - For some people, where they end up getting
[01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:12.960]   like a bunch of doses for a couple of weeks.
[01:23:12.960 --> 01:23:15.840]   And then for some people, that seems to last a while.
[01:23:15.840 --> 01:23:19.600]   You know, that's where I think the psilocybin story
[01:23:19.600 --> 01:23:22.760]   for depression and the MDMA story for PTSD
[01:23:22.760 --> 01:23:24.160]   seem more interesting to me.
[01:23:24.160 --> 01:23:28.020]   - So for psilocybin, what is the rough percentages on,
[01:23:28.020 --> 01:23:29.580]   and this would be relief not from trauma,
[01:23:29.580 --> 01:23:31.440]   but from depression.
[01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:32.720]   - Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[01:23:32.720 --> 01:23:34.640]   So it's, you know, in open label studies,
[01:23:34.640 --> 01:23:36.860]   it's closer to like half to two thirds of people
[01:23:36.860 --> 01:23:38.560]   end up getting better depending upon their level
[01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:39.520]   of treatment resistance.
[01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:42.960]   In the blinded trials, it was more like a third or so
[01:23:42.960 --> 01:23:45.840]   of people, you know, experienced relief.
[01:23:45.840 --> 01:23:49.760]   And this is a press release of the data.
[01:23:49.760 --> 01:23:51.740]   And so it hasn't, to my knowledge,
[01:23:51.740 --> 01:23:53.080]   it hasn't been published yet.
[01:23:53.080 --> 01:23:55.400]   And so I'm looking forward to seeing the full paper
[01:23:55.400 --> 01:23:56.240]   on that one.
[01:23:56.240 --> 01:23:59.760]   But it, you know, separated from placebo
[01:23:59.760 --> 01:24:02.000]   and looks, you know, looks pretty good as well.
[01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.800]   It looks like it's, you know, the first of two trials
[01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:07.000]   that need to be done to get this thing approved
[01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:08.440]   for treatment resistant depression.
[01:24:08.440 --> 01:24:11.780]   And so that stuff looks good.
[01:24:11.780 --> 01:24:15.480]   - In terms of MDMA, for many years,
[01:24:15.480 --> 01:24:18.080]   it was reported in the popular press
[01:24:18.080 --> 01:24:19.700]   and there was a paper published in Science
[01:24:19.700 --> 01:24:21.580]   that MDMA was neurotoxic,
[01:24:21.580 --> 01:24:23.700]   that it would kill serotonin neurons.
[01:24:23.700 --> 01:24:25.600]   This was what was always said.
[01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:29.040]   Then I saw another paper published in Science
[01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:31.400]   that wasn't a retraction of the previous paper,
[01:24:31.400 --> 01:24:33.640]   but rather was a second paper on the same group
[01:24:33.640 --> 01:24:37.000]   that essentially admitted that the first time around
[01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:40.280]   they had injected these monkeys
[01:24:40.280 --> 01:24:44.240]   'cause of the, with not MDMA, but with methamphetamine,
[01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:45.900]   which is known to be neurotoxic.
[01:24:45.900 --> 01:24:49.400]   So it was kind of a public admittance of oops
[01:24:49.400 --> 01:24:52.320]   or big, like really big screw up.
[01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:55.360]   So oops, but never a retraction.
[01:24:55.360 --> 01:24:59.180]   And then never really a publicly acknowledged correction
[01:24:59.180 --> 01:25:01.300]   in the popular press.
[01:25:01.300 --> 01:25:04.680]   So it seems that in the appropriate dosage range
[01:25:04.680 --> 01:25:07.760]   and with these one or two sessions,
[01:25:07.760 --> 01:25:11.120]   my assumption, and this again is an assumption,
[01:25:11.120 --> 01:25:12.920]   tell me if I'm right or wrong here,
[01:25:12.920 --> 01:25:17.600]   is that MDMA is not neurotoxic for serotonergic neurons
[01:25:17.600 --> 01:25:20.320]   at appropriate doses and with appropriate sourcing, et cetera.
[01:25:20.320 --> 01:25:23.560]   - So it was an interesting study that,
[01:25:23.560 --> 01:25:25.280]   I think the guy's name is Halpern.
[01:25:25.280 --> 01:25:26.760]   Last name's Halpern.
[01:25:26.760 --> 01:25:27.760]   - Not Casey Halpern.
[01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:29.160]   - Not Casey, different now.
[01:25:29.160 --> 01:25:31.400]   I think Joshua Halpern, I'm blanking on his first name,
[01:25:31.400 --> 01:25:34.640]   but he- - Casey Halpern was a guest on this podcast
[01:25:34.640 --> 01:25:36.800]   and is a former colleague of ours at Stanford,
[01:25:36.800 --> 01:25:39.600]   who unfortunately we lost to University of Pennsylvania
[01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:42.240]   and maybe someday we'll bring him back.
[01:25:42.240 --> 01:25:43.080]   - Yeah, that's right.
[01:25:43.080 --> 01:25:46.540]   So this individual received some NIH funding
[01:25:46.540 --> 01:25:50.080]   to actually NIDA, National Institute for Drug Abuse funding
[01:25:50.080 --> 01:25:55.080]   to explore individuals of the Mormon faith in Utah
[01:25:57.960 --> 01:26:02.800]   who partake in only MDMA.
[01:26:02.800 --> 01:26:07.800]   So the way this works is that MDMA happened
[01:26:07.800 --> 01:26:14.080]   kind of after a lot of the religious documents
[01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:16.640]   were developed and so MDMA
[01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:19.520]   isn't on the prohibited drug list.
[01:26:19.520 --> 01:26:20.360]   - The banned substance list.
[01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:21.680]   - Above the banned substance list.
[01:26:21.680 --> 01:26:23.240]   - I have some good friends who are LDS.
[01:26:23.240 --> 01:26:25.440]   - Yeah, great people.
[01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:28.820]   - I do as well, just to kind of set a facts.
[01:26:28.820 --> 01:26:33.820]   And so these folks only use MDMA,
[01:26:33.820 --> 01:26:37.900]   but they're not, the problem with some people using drugs
[01:26:37.900 --> 01:26:39.920]   is they're polysubstance users, right?
[01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:42.280]   So you can't say it's the MDMA
[01:26:42.280 --> 01:26:44.120]   if they've also taken other psychedelics
[01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:45.920]   and they've taken opiates and they've taken cocaine.
[01:26:45.920 --> 01:26:47.240]   And you have this picture
[01:26:47.240 --> 01:26:50.520]   where you can't really tease out that problem.
[01:26:50.520 --> 01:26:53.800]   But with this, it was just individuals
[01:26:53.800 --> 01:26:55.320]   that were part of the Mormon faith
[01:26:55.320 --> 01:26:58.240]   and so they were kind of purists
[01:26:58.240 --> 01:27:00.040]   in the sense they only used MDMA
[01:27:00.040 --> 01:27:01.880]   and he confirmed all of that.
[01:27:01.880 --> 01:27:04.620]   And it was a brilliant study, right?
[01:27:04.620 --> 01:27:06.200]   Because then he was able to go in
[01:27:06.200 --> 01:27:08.200]   and look at their cognitive profiles
[01:27:08.200 --> 01:27:12.160]   versus individuals of the same geography, the same faith,
[01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:15.720]   all of that that happened to not take MDMA
[01:27:15.720 --> 01:27:19.440]   and found there were no neurocognitive differences.
[01:27:19.440 --> 01:27:22.760]   - So does that mean that it was not damaging?
[01:27:22.760 --> 01:27:24.680]   - It was not damaging.
[01:27:24.680 --> 01:27:27.760]   It's hard to know because to really do this study well,
[01:27:27.760 --> 01:27:29.400]   you'd have to track these folks down
[01:27:29.400 --> 01:27:32.780]   before they ever took MDMA and do a pre-post
[01:27:32.780 --> 01:27:34.680]   and compare it to people that didn't.
[01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:37.800]   But this is about as good of a study as you can do
[01:27:37.800 --> 01:27:43.000]   given the situation to be able to check this out.
[01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:46.000]   Additionally, when I was back in Charleston
[01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.740]   and working at the medical university of South Carolina,
[01:27:48.740 --> 01:27:52.600]   one of my mentors there, Dr. Wagner,
[01:27:53.680 --> 01:27:55.760]   was a neuropsychologist at MUSC
[01:27:55.760 --> 01:27:58.280]   and he was also the neuropsychologist
[01:27:58.280 --> 01:28:00.480]   for the early MDMA trials.
[01:28:00.480 --> 01:28:03.140]   And so he did all the neurocognitive batteries
[01:28:03.140 --> 01:28:07.260]   for individuals pre-post and similarly did not see
[01:28:07.260 --> 01:28:11.300]   any changes in neurocognitive profiles in a negative way.
[01:28:11.300 --> 01:28:15.040]   And so there's data from experimental patients
[01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:16.640]   receiving this, there's data from people
[01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:20.600]   that are chronic users who only take MDMA
[01:28:21.680 --> 01:28:26.480]   and that combination of data suggests
[01:28:26.480 --> 01:28:30.160]   that there's certainly no apparent risk
[01:28:30.160 --> 01:28:34.120]   in the kind of one to two to three dose range.
[01:28:34.120 --> 01:28:39.120]   It's probably unlikely that at least modest dose exposure
[01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:43.200]   over a lifetime doesn't appear to have a profound
[01:28:43.200 --> 01:28:46.640]   neurocognitive damaging effect.
[01:28:46.640 --> 01:28:47.480]   - Interesting.
[01:28:47.480 --> 01:28:50.080]   Yeah, I know that sourcing is key
[01:28:50.080 --> 01:28:51.720]   and here we're talking about clinical trials
[01:28:51.720 --> 01:28:53.280]   where purity is assured.
[01:28:53.280 --> 01:28:58.080]   And years ago when so-called raves were really popular,
[01:28:58.080 --> 01:28:58.920]   maybe they're still popular,
[01:28:58.920 --> 01:29:02.040]   never been to one so I wouldn't know
[01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:03.040]   if they're happening or not.
[01:29:03.040 --> 01:29:05.120]   That's how in the know I am.
[01:29:05.120 --> 01:29:09.040]   But it was clear that testing for purity was important
[01:29:09.040 --> 01:29:14.040]   because sometimes the drugs are made such that
[01:29:14.040 --> 01:29:17.520]   there are contaminants like methamphetamine,
[01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:20.080]   which we know is highly neurotoxic.
[01:29:20.080 --> 01:29:23.120]   I think that one reason why people think that MDMA
[01:29:23.120 --> 01:29:27.640]   might be neurotoxic is the reported drop in energy
[01:29:27.640 --> 01:29:30.280]   or sort of feeling fatigued for a few days afterward.
[01:29:30.280 --> 01:29:32.200]   I spoke to a physician colleague of ours
[01:29:32.200 --> 01:29:35.760]   who said that very likely has something to do
[01:29:35.760 --> 01:29:40.080]   with the surgeon prolactin that arrives subsequent
[01:29:40.080 --> 01:29:43.520]   to the big dopamine surge that occurs in MDMA.
[01:29:43.520 --> 01:29:46.520]   And I mentioned that because I know a number of people
[01:29:46.520 --> 01:29:50.280]   talk about serotonin depletion after taking MDMA.
[01:29:50.280 --> 01:29:52.740]   He has it in mind that while that could be true,
[01:29:52.740 --> 01:29:54.960]   it's likely that anytime somebody takes something
[01:29:54.960 --> 01:29:57.920]   or does something where there's a huge lift in dopamine,
[01:29:57.920 --> 01:30:00.760]   that there's very likely a huge compensatory increase
[01:30:00.760 --> 01:30:02.440]   in prolactin that follows and prolactin
[01:30:02.440 --> 01:30:05.820]   has a kind of sedative effect, numbing effect on mood
[01:30:05.820 --> 01:30:08.760]   and libido, et cetera, that eventually also wears off.
[01:30:08.760 --> 01:30:10.700]   Does that make sense to you as a physician?
[01:30:10.700 --> 01:30:11.540]   - Yeah, it makes sense.
[01:30:11.540 --> 01:30:15.420]   I mean, the difference between say MDMA and psilocybin
[01:30:15.420 --> 01:30:17.800]   is that MDMA is kind of an amphetamine of sorts, right?
[01:30:17.800 --> 01:30:22.800]   So it has effects in dopamine and psilocybin's
[01:30:22.800 --> 01:30:26.720]   pretty neutral and maybe a little bit of dopamine effects,
[01:30:26.720 --> 01:30:30.380]   but kind of much more of a serotonergic focused drug.
[01:30:30.380 --> 01:30:32.480]   And so, yeah, I think you're going to see
[01:30:32.480 --> 01:30:34.120]   kind of a different profile after.
[01:30:34.120 --> 01:30:35.720]   And that makes, I haven't heard that story,
[01:30:35.720 --> 01:30:37.220]   but that makes sense to me too.
[01:30:37.220 --> 01:30:39.420]   - Since you mentioned psilocybin,
[01:30:39.420 --> 01:30:40.860]   let's talk a little bit about the neurochemistry
[01:30:40.860 --> 01:30:41.700]   of psilocybin.
[01:30:41.700 --> 01:30:45.180]   As a serotonergic agent, my understanding is it operates
[01:30:45.180 --> 01:30:49.980]   on these, is it the 5-HT serotonin 2C receptor?
[01:30:49.980 --> 01:30:53.340]   - 2A. - 2A, excuse me, 2A receptors.
[01:30:53.340 --> 01:30:55.600]   And that I've seen a bunch of different reports
[01:30:55.600 --> 01:30:57.360]   in terms of what it's actually doing to the brain
[01:30:57.360 --> 01:30:59.560]   while people are under the effects of the drug.
[01:30:59.560 --> 01:31:01.580]   And this is important for us to segment out
[01:31:01.580 --> 01:31:03.200]   because there are the effects that happen
[01:31:03.200 --> 01:31:04.600]   while people are under the influence
[01:31:04.600 --> 01:31:06.860]   and then the more long lasting effects.
[01:31:06.860 --> 01:31:08.540]   But some of the effects that I've heard about are,
[01:31:08.540 --> 01:31:11.540]   for instance, and tell me again if these are right or wrong,
[01:31:12.980 --> 01:31:17.980]   that there is increased activation of lateral connection,
[01:31:17.980 --> 01:31:21.000]   sort of broader areas of the brain being co-active
[01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.020]   than would normally occur.
[01:31:23.020 --> 01:31:25.460]   Maybe that explains some of the synesthesia,
[01:31:25.460 --> 01:31:29.520]   seeing sounds and hearing colors as the trivial example,
[01:31:29.520 --> 01:31:34.260]   but rule-breaking within the mind.
[01:31:34.260 --> 01:31:38.720]   But then I've also heard that perhaps it's lack of gating
[01:31:38.720 --> 01:31:39.620]   of sensory input.
[01:31:39.620 --> 01:31:41.220]   So normally if I'm looking at something,
[01:31:41.220 --> 01:31:43.820]   I'm not thinking about the sensation in my right toe
[01:31:43.820 --> 01:31:46.040]   unless it's relevant.
[01:31:46.040 --> 01:31:47.980]   But if I'm thinking about the sensation in my right toe,
[01:31:47.980 --> 01:31:49.300]   I'm generally not thinking about the truck
[01:31:49.300 --> 01:31:50.140]   around the corner.
[01:31:50.140 --> 01:31:51.760]   So we have these attentional spotlights,
[01:31:51.760 --> 01:31:56.000]   but that somehow it creates a more, it adds spotlights.
[01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:57.540]   - Yeah, de-gates the thalamus.
[01:31:57.540 --> 01:31:58.900]   - De-gates the thalamus, right,
[01:31:58.900 --> 01:32:01.520]   through the reticular thalamic structure.
[01:32:01.520 --> 01:32:05.580]   So what is the evidence that any of that is true?
[01:32:05.580 --> 01:32:07.520]   And are there other phenomena?
[01:32:07.520 --> 01:32:09.700]   Is there involvement of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
[01:32:09.700 --> 01:32:10.780]   that we are aware of?
[01:32:10.780 --> 01:32:13.720]   And where I'm really headed here in a few minutes is,
[01:32:13.720 --> 01:32:18.700]   is there a place for combining directed stimulation
[01:32:18.700 --> 01:32:21.580]   of the brain with psychedelics so that the effects
[01:32:21.580 --> 01:32:26.220]   of serotonin could be primarily within the structures
[01:32:26.220 --> 01:32:28.980]   that you know from your work to be relevant to depression?
[01:32:28.980 --> 01:32:30.940]   So, but to simplify it first,
[01:32:30.940 --> 01:32:33.260]   what's going on when one takes psilocybin
[01:32:33.260 --> 01:32:36.740]   and why is it interesting in light of depression?
[01:32:36.740 --> 01:32:37.580]   - Yeah, definitely.
[01:32:37.580 --> 01:32:42.580]   So David Nutt and Robin Carr and Harris' work
[01:32:42.580 --> 01:32:45.700]   around neuroimaging psychedelics are kind of some
[01:32:45.700 --> 01:32:47.520]   of the first folks to do that work.
[01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:50.100]   And to their great surprise,
[01:32:50.100 --> 01:32:52.820]   they thought there was gonna be an increase in activity
[01:32:52.820 --> 01:32:54.960]   on psychedelics and what they found is the opposite, right?
[01:32:54.960 --> 01:32:58.180]   There's kind of an overall decrease in the level of activity
[01:32:58.180 --> 01:33:00.900]   in the brain with psychedelics.
[01:33:00.900 --> 01:33:03.660]   But they've also looked at connectivity
[01:33:03.660 --> 01:33:05.700]   and there's this kind of small world,
[01:33:05.700 --> 01:33:08.900]   you know, large world connectivity that you think about.
[01:33:08.900 --> 01:33:11.460]   And so, you know, small world meaning there's a lot,
[01:33:11.460 --> 01:33:13.860]   there's kind of a much more kind of focused
[01:33:13.860 --> 01:33:15.540]   kind of cortical function or, you know,
[01:33:15.540 --> 01:33:17.660]   subcortical function or whatever it is.
[01:33:17.660 --> 01:33:21.780]   And what you see is a difference in that,
[01:33:21.780 --> 01:33:24.980]   in that level of engagement and of brain regions.
[01:33:24.980 --> 01:33:27.220]   So the connectivity, kind of global connectivity
[01:33:27.220 --> 01:33:29.380]   to your point kind of increases.
[01:33:29.380 --> 01:33:32.020]   And so, you know, it's interesting, you know,
[01:33:32.020 --> 01:33:36.100]   I think to kind of have a convergent theory on this,
[01:33:36.100 --> 01:33:38.700]   it's still, you know, to be determined,
[01:33:38.700 --> 01:33:41.440]   there's still a lot of work I think that needs to be done.
[01:33:41.440 --> 01:33:44.820]   But it's certainly suggestive
[01:33:44.820 --> 01:33:49.260]   that there's pretty profound changes in brain activity
[01:33:49.260 --> 01:33:51.400]   and brain connectivity after.
[01:33:51.400 --> 01:33:54.020]   And what we've found to be really interesting
[01:33:54.020 --> 01:33:58.480]   is the antidepressant effects of psilocybin
[01:33:58.480 --> 01:34:02.400]   have a particular connectivity change
[01:34:02.400 --> 01:34:05.960]   that we also see with our TMS approaches, right?
[01:34:05.960 --> 01:34:07.760]   And it's this connectivity
[01:34:07.760 --> 01:34:10.080]   between the subgenual anterior cingulate
[01:34:10.080 --> 01:34:11.920]   and the default mode network.
[01:34:11.920 --> 01:34:14.060]   And so when we do this effective
[01:34:14.060 --> 01:34:16.800]   Stanford neuromodulation therapy stimulation,
[01:34:16.800 --> 01:34:19.000]   we see a down regulation,
[01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:22.180]   the connectivity between the negatively valenced mood state
[01:34:22.180 --> 01:34:23.900]   in the case of depressed individuals
[01:34:23.900 --> 01:34:26.320]   and the self-representation of the brain.
[01:34:26.320 --> 01:34:29.040]   And you see that same connectivity change
[01:34:29.040 --> 01:34:31.840]   occur post psilocybin, you know,
[01:34:31.840 --> 01:34:33.920]   suggesting there's a convergent mechanism.
[01:34:33.920 --> 01:34:34.840]   And it makes sense, right?
[01:34:34.840 --> 01:34:36.860]   You've kind of got an over-connected,
[01:34:36.860 --> 01:34:40.320]   negatively valenced system, conflict system
[01:34:40.320 --> 01:34:42.280]   that's kind of, you know,
[01:34:42.280 --> 01:34:45.220]   kind of attached onto the self-representation
[01:34:45.220 --> 01:34:47.220]   and people feel stuck, right?
[01:34:47.220 --> 01:34:49.940]   And then when you do whatever you do that's effective,
[01:34:49.940 --> 01:34:53.200]   it unpairs those two systems.
[01:34:53.200 --> 01:34:56.480]   - I want to ask you about this phenomenon
[01:34:56.480 --> 01:34:58.440]   I've heard about during psilocybin journeys.
[01:34:58.440 --> 01:35:00.840]   I heard about this from Dr. Matthew Johnson,
[01:35:00.840 --> 01:35:02.380]   who's running a lot of the clinical trials
[01:35:02.380 --> 01:35:07.160]   at Johns Hopkins and has been a guest on this podcast.
[01:35:07.160 --> 01:35:11.240]   He said that there's something seems to be important
[01:35:11.240 --> 01:35:13.700]   about the patient who's depressed
[01:35:13.700 --> 01:35:16.900]   or who's and is under the influence of psilocybin
[01:35:16.900 --> 01:35:19.160]   or the patient who's trying to get a over smoking
[01:35:19.160 --> 01:35:21.400]   or an eating disorder who's taking psilocybin
[01:35:21.400 --> 01:35:24.680]   and is in the clinic, that there's something important
[01:35:24.680 --> 01:35:27.400]   to this notion of letting go,
[01:35:27.400 --> 01:35:30.560]   that people will feel as if their thoughts
[01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:32.320]   and their feelings and maybe even their body
[01:35:32.320 --> 01:35:33.480]   aren't under their control
[01:35:33.480 --> 01:35:36.640]   and that the clinician's job under those circumstances
[01:35:36.640 --> 01:35:38.360]   is of course to make sure that they're physically safe,
[01:35:38.360 --> 01:35:39.520]   so they don't jump out a window
[01:35:39.520 --> 01:35:41.560]   or try to actually give an example of a patient
[01:35:41.560 --> 01:35:43.640]   who thought that, I think it was a she,
[01:35:43.640 --> 01:35:45.980]   could move into the painting in the wall.
[01:35:45.980 --> 01:35:48.580]   And obviously that wasn't true in the real world,
[01:35:48.580 --> 01:35:49.860]   although it was true in her mind.
[01:35:49.860 --> 01:35:51.840]   So they prevented her from doing that.
[01:35:51.840 --> 01:35:56.080]   But that letting go, that somehow untethering
[01:35:56.080 --> 01:35:59.800]   from the autonomic arousal that's occurring is important,
[01:35:59.800 --> 01:36:02.720]   which brings us back to this idea
[01:36:02.720 --> 01:36:04.960]   or me back to this idea of like a seesaw
[01:36:04.960 --> 01:36:07.440]   where you're sort of letting go of the hinge
[01:36:07.440 --> 01:36:09.520]   and just sort of your heart rate's going up,
[01:36:09.520 --> 01:36:11.860]   like just go with it and trust.
[01:36:11.860 --> 01:36:13.860]   Your heart rate's going down, just go with it and trust.
[01:36:13.860 --> 01:36:16.920]   You're thinking about something very powerful
[01:36:16.920 --> 01:36:19.180]   and depressing related to your childhood.
[01:36:19.180 --> 01:36:21.520]   You're just supposed to go there without fear.
[01:36:21.520 --> 01:36:23.120]   You're thinking about what's possible
[01:36:23.120 --> 01:36:24.400]   in terms of what could happen.
[01:36:24.400 --> 01:36:27.000]   So anyway, you get the picture.
[01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:31.480]   Can we think of that as just the willingness
[01:36:31.480 --> 01:36:35.080]   to do a million different variations
[01:36:35.080 --> 01:36:37.720]   on the emotional Stroop task?
[01:36:37.720 --> 01:36:42.160]   You will entertain the full array of rules within your head
[01:36:42.160 --> 01:36:43.320]   and consider them.
[01:36:43.320 --> 01:36:45.440]   Or is there something more to it?
[01:36:45.440 --> 01:36:50.100]   And again, we're in the outer margins of understanding here,
[01:36:50.100 --> 01:36:53.540]   but what are your thoughts on this notion of letting go
[01:36:53.540 --> 01:36:57.220]   as such a key variable for relief from depression
[01:36:57.220 --> 01:36:58.420]   during the psychedelic journey?
[01:36:58.420 --> 01:37:00.580]   - Yeah, so I'll talk a little bit about something
[01:37:00.580 --> 01:37:03.060]   called exposure and response prevention therapy.
[01:37:03.060 --> 01:37:06.420]   That's a typical kind of gold standard treatment for OCD.
[01:37:06.420 --> 01:37:10.300]   And I'll help to kind of help this a little bit conceptually.
[01:37:10.300 --> 01:37:14.220]   And so what that really is, it's a letting go therapy.
[01:37:14.220 --> 01:37:18.060]   And so exposure response prevention,
[01:37:18.060 --> 01:37:22.280]   the idea is that you have to expose the individual
[01:37:22.280 --> 01:37:26.940]   to something that triggers an obsession
[01:37:26.940 --> 01:37:30.600]   that they then want to do whatever the compulsion is.
[01:37:30.600 --> 01:37:33.740]   And so I'll give you my first exposure
[01:37:33.740 --> 01:37:36.660]   and response prevention patient when I was a resident.
[01:37:36.660 --> 01:37:41.660]   He was very concerned about leaving the lights on this car.
[01:37:42.280 --> 01:37:45.180]   And so what we did is we went out
[01:37:45.180 --> 01:37:50.540]   and we turned the lights on in his car and locked his door.
[01:37:50.540 --> 01:37:53.020]   So his lights were on and he was super worried
[01:37:53.020 --> 01:37:54.920]   this is gonna kill his battery.
[01:37:54.920 --> 01:37:58.280]   And we went and we spent an hour talking about things
[01:37:58.280 --> 01:38:02.000]   and we went back out to his car and his battery was fine
[01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:05.440]   and his lights were on and he cranked the car
[01:38:05.440 --> 01:38:07.980]   and we did it maybe one other time.
[01:38:07.980 --> 01:38:10.920]   And then all of a sudden that was gone, right?
[01:38:10.920 --> 01:38:14.660]   And that's the idea is that you're essentially exposing
[01:38:14.660 --> 01:38:17.020]   and you wanna do it at levels that are
[01:38:17.020 --> 01:38:20.100]   from an anxiety standpoint, tolerable,
[01:38:20.100 --> 01:38:22.100]   but exposing the person to something
[01:38:22.100 --> 01:38:25.740]   and then letting them see that that exposure
[01:38:25.740 --> 01:38:27.580]   ends up being fine, right?
[01:38:27.580 --> 01:38:29.220]   It ends up not causing the thing
[01:38:29.220 --> 01:38:31.400]   that they end up being worried about.
[01:38:31.400 --> 01:38:36.860]   And so in some sense, being in the psychedelic state
[01:38:36.860 --> 01:38:41.320]   and we're all taught at a level to retain
[01:38:41.320 --> 01:38:43.640]   some level of control.
[01:38:43.640 --> 01:38:46.760]   People have more or less of that,
[01:38:46.760 --> 01:38:50.600]   but we're all effectively retaining some level of control.
[01:38:50.600 --> 01:38:52.720]   We all wake up in the morning and put clothes on
[01:38:52.720 --> 01:38:53.780]   to go into society.
[01:38:53.780 --> 01:38:58.680]   We all try to say, most people try to say the right things.
[01:38:58.680 --> 01:39:00.540]   They don't try to do things that are outside
[01:39:00.540 --> 01:39:03.680]   of cultural norms when they're in conversation.
[01:39:03.680 --> 01:39:07.520]   And so we're constantly at some level controlling
[01:39:07.520 --> 01:39:08.820]   the situation that we're in.
[01:39:08.820 --> 01:39:13.820]   And so it makes a lot of sense that in that state,
[01:39:13.820 --> 01:39:16.900]   part of the therapeutic effect that may be linked
[01:39:16.900 --> 01:39:21.360]   to the neural circuitry is this idea of letting go
[01:39:21.360 --> 01:39:24.480]   and essentially letting the system,
[01:39:24.480 --> 01:39:27.320]   the network configuration maybe, whatever it is,
[01:39:27.320 --> 01:39:32.480]   assume a state that you've essentially been fighting
[01:39:32.480 --> 01:39:36.240]   the whole time, the same way that my OCD patient
[01:39:36.240 --> 01:39:41.240]   was fighting this need to click the off button
[01:39:41.240 --> 01:39:46.240]   on the lights of his car 50 times before he would go
[01:39:46.240 --> 01:39:48.320]   and do whatever he needed to do.
[01:39:48.320 --> 01:39:50.080]   And in some level, letting go there,
[01:39:50.080 --> 01:39:52.240]   meaning letting us just turn the lights on
[01:39:52.240 --> 01:39:54.920]   and him not do anything, or letting go,
[01:39:54.920 --> 01:39:56.280]   meaning in the psychedelic state,
[01:39:56.280 --> 01:39:58.640]   you're just letting go of whatever it is
[01:39:58.640 --> 01:39:59.960]   you're holding onto.
[01:39:59.960 --> 01:40:02.800]   Negatively balanced thoughts about yourself
[01:40:02.800 --> 01:40:05.880]   in the setting of having depression
[01:40:05.880 --> 01:40:09.160]   or re-experiencing a trauma,
[01:40:09.160 --> 01:40:13.160]   memory and allowing that to just happen
[01:40:13.160 --> 01:40:16.100]   and re-seeing it again through a different light,
[01:40:16.100 --> 01:40:20.120]   it feels the same in the sense that that's allowing
[01:40:20.120 --> 01:40:23.040]   for whatever's going on with these psychedelic states
[01:40:23.040 --> 01:40:24.920]   to do whatever they do.
[01:40:24.920 --> 01:40:26.040]   - It's fascinating.
[01:40:26.040 --> 01:40:29.000]   You said exposure response therapy is the traditional name?
[01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:30.400]   - Closure response prevention.
[01:40:30.400 --> 01:40:34.680]   - Prevention therapy done outside of the psychedelic journey.
[01:40:34.680 --> 01:40:36.320]   - It's done outside the psychedelic journey,
[01:40:36.320 --> 01:40:41.320]   but that idea of letting go is present in both of those.
[01:40:41.320 --> 01:40:45.240]   Psychotherapy kind of straight up, totally sober,
[01:40:45.240 --> 01:40:48.120]   non-psychedelic, non anything,
[01:40:48.120 --> 01:40:50.280]   manualized that psychotherapy that we know
[01:40:50.280 --> 01:40:52.400]   works really well for OCD.
[01:40:52.400 --> 01:40:54.840]   And then in that psychedelic state.
[01:40:54.840 --> 01:40:58.560]   And so people have done studies with psilocybin
[01:40:58.560 --> 01:41:00.240]   and now there's some studies with MDMA
[01:41:00.240 --> 01:41:03.480]   trying to look at treating OCD
[01:41:03.480 --> 01:41:08.080]   with the same sort of idea of letting go, right?
[01:41:08.080 --> 01:41:11.320]   And how do you have an OCD patient kind of let go,
[01:41:11.320 --> 01:41:14.920]   maybe even letting go of not washing their hands anymore,
[01:41:14.920 --> 01:41:18.160]   kind of accepting the idea they're not going to get germs
[01:41:18.160 --> 01:41:19.960]   in their hands or whatever it is.
[01:41:19.960 --> 01:41:21.720]   And so it's kind of part and parcel
[01:41:21.720 --> 01:41:23.760]   that same sort of thinking.
[01:41:23.760 --> 01:41:24.600]   - When I was in college,
[01:41:24.600 --> 01:41:26.960]   I developed a compulsive superstition.
[01:41:26.960 --> 01:41:28.080]   I'm not afraid to admit this.
[01:41:28.080 --> 01:41:31.960]   I somehow developed a knock on wood superstition
[01:41:31.960 --> 01:41:35.640]   and I was actually kind of ashamed of it
[01:41:35.640 --> 01:41:38.400]   because it rationally made no sense.
[01:41:38.400 --> 01:41:40.540]   I don't consider myself a superstitious person,
[01:41:40.540 --> 01:41:42.820]   never was a superstitious kid.
[01:41:42.820 --> 01:41:46.160]   I'd step on the sidewalk cracks, I'd walk under ladders.
[01:41:46.160 --> 01:41:49.680]   You know, I'd probably even try to walk under a ladder
[01:41:49.680 --> 01:41:52.040]   even though I don't suggest it.
[01:41:52.040 --> 01:41:53.880]   But somehow I picked this thing up
[01:41:53.880 --> 01:41:57.080]   and I used to sneak it at times.
[01:41:57.080 --> 01:41:58.580]   I told my girlfriend at the time that I had it
[01:41:58.580 --> 01:42:01.520]   in hopes that that would prevent me from doing it.
[01:42:01.520 --> 01:42:02.580]   And it's tricky.
[01:42:02.580 --> 01:42:04.280]   Sometimes it actually comes back where I think,
[01:42:04.280 --> 01:42:06.120]   gosh, I didn't say, you know, knock on wood.
[01:42:06.120 --> 01:42:06.960]   I didn't knock on wood.
[01:42:06.960 --> 01:42:08.520]   I hope that doesn't actually happen.
[01:42:08.520 --> 01:42:11.360]   And it's quote unquote crazy, right?
[01:42:11.360 --> 01:42:14.400]   But crazy in the sense that it makes no sense rationally
[01:42:14.400 --> 01:42:16.240]   why the events would be linked.
[01:42:16.240 --> 01:42:17.640]   And yet I think a lot of people out there
[01:42:17.640 --> 01:42:21.000]   do have internal superstitions.
[01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.800]   Maybe by talking about it now, it'll go away.
[01:42:23.800 --> 01:42:25.960]   Clearly I just need to challenge it.
[01:42:25.960 --> 01:42:27.600]   You know, it's, anyway, I mentioned it
[01:42:27.600 --> 01:42:29.720]   because I concern myself, you know,
[01:42:29.720 --> 01:42:31.040]   generally rational person,
[01:42:31.040 --> 01:42:35.920]   but it's interesting how these motor patterns get activated
[01:42:35.920 --> 01:42:37.600]   and this notion of letting go
[01:42:37.600 --> 01:42:41.360]   because I don't actually know what consequence I fear.
[01:42:41.360 --> 01:42:43.400]   And the fear, as I was hearing the example you gave,
[01:42:43.400 --> 01:42:44.600]   you know, the fear of the car running,
[01:42:44.600 --> 01:42:46.020]   battery running down, I was about to say,
[01:42:46.020 --> 01:42:47.960]   well, what if the battery actually did run out?
[01:42:47.960 --> 01:42:49.740]   Then the therapy would be undermined.
[01:42:49.740 --> 01:42:51.800]   And yet that could also be interesting too
[01:42:51.800 --> 01:42:53.040]   because it's not that big of a deal.
[01:42:53.040 --> 01:42:54.400]   You jumped the car.
[01:42:54.400 --> 01:42:56.120]   But in my case, I need to think about
[01:42:56.120 --> 01:42:58.520]   what the ultimate fear is.
[01:42:58.520 --> 01:43:01.160]   - Yeah, and I, you know, I think a lot of people,
[01:43:01.160 --> 01:43:03.200]   so there's, it's interesting if you look at,
[01:43:03.200 --> 01:43:06.480]   say the OCD scale or the depression scale or whatever,
[01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:08.960]   we don't define normal as zero.
[01:43:08.960 --> 01:43:13.960]   We define normal as some number range above,
[01:43:13.960 --> 01:43:18.200]   so zero to, in the case of the Montgomery-Asburg
[01:43:18.200 --> 01:43:19.560]   Depression Rating Scale,
[01:43:19.560 --> 01:43:22.400]   one of the depression scales we use, 10, right?
[01:43:22.400 --> 01:43:23.620]   That's the normal range.
[01:43:23.620 --> 01:43:26.240]   And so people can have some sadness
[01:43:26.240 --> 01:43:27.720]   and still be considered normal.
[01:43:27.720 --> 01:43:30.320]   In the case of the OCD scale, it's about the same 10, right?
[01:43:30.320 --> 01:43:33.940]   Where we say it's kind of starts to be, you know,
[01:43:33.940 --> 01:43:36.040]   mildly abnormal or something.
[01:43:36.040 --> 01:43:36.880]   And I always, you know,
[01:43:36.880 --> 01:43:38.180]   I'd always tell the medical students,
[01:43:38.180 --> 01:43:40.800]   look, my friends that are surf instructors,
[01:43:40.800 --> 01:43:42.780]   they're more like a zero on the YBOC.
[01:43:42.780 --> 01:43:46.240]   People that are professionals, you know, they're non-zero,
[01:43:46.240 --> 01:43:48.800]   but it's still within the normal range.
[01:43:48.800 --> 01:43:49.960]   And especially, you know,
[01:43:49.960 --> 01:43:51.980]   in the case that you're talking about,
[01:43:51.980 --> 01:43:53.560]   it doesn't sound like it got in your way.
[01:43:53.560 --> 01:43:54.400]   It doesn't sound, I mean,
[01:43:54.400 --> 01:43:57.560]   you're obviously highly successful tenured professor
[01:43:57.560 --> 01:44:01.800]   at Stanford and do all the great things that you do.
[01:44:01.800 --> 01:44:05.220]   And so it's very much kind of within the normal range.
[01:44:05.220 --> 01:44:10.220]   And I think totally assumed that a lot of people
[01:44:10.220 --> 01:44:12.160]   have these sorts of things.
[01:44:12.160 --> 01:44:15.880]   And as long, I think something as a psychiatric diagnosis,
[01:44:15.880 --> 01:44:19.440]   when it severely impairs your ability to function,
[01:44:19.440 --> 01:44:22.680]   and that's when we kind of cross that threshold.
[01:44:22.680 --> 01:44:25.680]   But, you know, I think that a lot of people,
[01:44:25.680 --> 01:44:27.000]   and it's great that you're bringing this up.
[01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:28.720]   I mean, it's very anti-stigmatizing
[01:44:28.720 --> 01:44:29.560]   that you're bringing it up, right?
[01:44:29.560 --> 01:44:32.280]   Because I think a lot of people hold that stuff in
[01:44:32.280 --> 01:44:33.620]   and they don't want to talk about it
[01:44:33.620 --> 01:44:35.320]   because they're worried
[01:44:35.320 --> 01:44:36.960]   that somebody else may think something.
[01:44:36.960 --> 01:44:39.400]   But the reality is as a psychiatrist,
[01:44:39.400 --> 01:44:41.400]   I talk to a lot of patients,
[01:44:41.400 --> 01:44:43.840]   a lot of people that are, you know, family members,
[01:44:43.840 --> 01:44:46.920]   you know, folks that are just going through a death
[01:44:46.920 --> 01:44:48.480]   in the family, whatever it is.
[01:44:48.480 --> 01:44:49.720]   And what you figure out is like,
[01:44:49.720 --> 01:44:52.360]   everybody's got a little something here and there.
[01:44:52.360 --> 01:44:55.180]   Everybody has the knock in some way, if that makes sense.
[01:44:55.180 --> 01:44:58.160]   And it's just, and we're just all,
[01:44:58.160 --> 01:44:59.640]   we're all just kind of more predisposed
[01:44:59.640 --> 01:45:00.600]   not to talk about it.
[01:45:00.600 --> 01:45:02.780]   But I think it's important to talk about it
[01:45:02.780 --> 01:45:05.320]   because I think that when we start all talking about it,
[01:45:05.320 --> 01:45:07.100]   then we realize that we're all
[01:45:07.100 --> 01:45:09.120]   kind of in this together in a way.
[01:45:09.120 --> 01:45:11.760]   And that we're, and then some folks that, you know,
[01:45:11.760 --> 01:45:14.880]   have, you know, have to knock a hundred times,
[01:45:14.880 --> 01:45:18.520]   we call that OCD, you know, and they have all, you know,
[01:45:18.520 --> 01:45:19.760]   germ, they're worried about germs
[01:45:19.760 --> 01:45:22.000]   and all these other things, we call that OCD.
[01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.420]   And then in that circumstance, you know,
[01:45:24.420 --> 01:45:25.640]   they need treatment, right?
[01:45:25.640 --> 01:45:28.360]   But it is really on just like blood sugar,
[01:45:28.360 --> 01:45:30.960]   just like blood pressure, it's on a range, you know,
[01:45:30.960 --> 01:45:33.040]   and it's not just these discrete diagnoses,
[01:45:33.040 --> 01:45:34.740]   you have them or you don't.
[01:45:34.740 --> 01:45:35.580]   - It's good to know.
[01:45:35.580 --> 01:45:37.920]   I actually feel some relief just hearing this
[01:45:37.920 --> 01:45:40.720]   because I am slightly, I wouldn't say ashamed
[01:45:40.720 --> 01:45:43.640]   or sort of embarrassed by it, but I offer it as a,
[01:45:43.640 --> 01:45:48.140]   you know, that, you know, it is what it is, as they say.
[01:45:48.140 --> 01:45:51.840]   And it certainly doesn't seem to hinder my life
[01:45:51.840 --> 01:45:53.260]   much, knock on wood.
[01:45:53.260 --> 01:45:58.600]   So if we could talk a bit about ibogaine.
[01:45:58.600 --> 01:46:00.480]   I don't know much about ibogaine,
[01:46:00.480 --> 01:46:03.240]   although anytime I hear the, you know, A-I-N-E, you know,
[01:46:03.240 --> 01:46:05.600]   lidocaine, ibogaine, I think of an anesthetic
[01:46:05.600 --> 01:46:08.460]   and going to the dentist,
[01:46:08.460 --> 01:46:11.100]   which is an unpleasant experience for me, generally.
[01:46:11.100 --> 01:46:14.640]   What's, what is ibogaine?
[01:46:14.640 --> 01:46:19.360]   Does this have anything to do with the so-called toad?
[01:46:19.360 --> 01:46:22.400]   You know, people talk about smoking frog skin, toad skin.
[01:46:22.400 --> 01:46:26.120]   What is it used for clinically?
[01:46:26.120 --> 01:46:29.560]   Is it legal in the U.S. as a clinical tool?
[01:46:29.560 --> 01:46:33.380]   Who's using it and for what purposes?
[01:46:33.380 --> 01:46:35.680]   If you could educate me on ibogaine,
[01:46:35.680 --> 01:46:37.200]   I truly know nothing about it,
[01:46:37.200 --> 01:46:39.200]   except I think I know how to spell it correctly.
[01:46:39.200 --> 01:46:40.520]   - Yeah, that's fair.
[01:46:40.520 --> 01:46:45.520]   So ibogaine is one of the alkaloids
[01:46:46.320 --> 01:46:51.320]   that you can extract from a iboga tree root bark
[01:46:51.320 --> 01:46:57.120]   that's typically growing in the country of Gabon, Africa.
[01:46:57.120 --> 01:47:04.760]   So Gabon is one of the West African countries,
[01:47:04.760 --> 01:47:09.120]   kind of middle of Africa on the West coast.
[01:47:09.120 --> 01:47:12.120]   And Gabon is,
[01:47:13.920 --> 01:47:18.920]   has a group of folks called the Bawiti.
[01:47:18.920 --> 01:47:23.480]   It's a religious kind of sacramental group
[01:47:23.480 --> 01:47:28.480]   that sacramentally uses iboga root bark
[01:47:28.480 --> 01:47:32.340]   as part of that, this sacrament.
[01:47:32.340 --> 01:47:36.160]   And they've been using iboga root bark
[01:47:36.160 --> 01:47:41.160]   for a very long time and it's part of the tradition.
[01:47:41.280 --> 01:47:46.120]   There's a whole set of kind of ceremony around it.
[01:47:46.120 --> 01:47:47.140]   If you're interested in this,
[01:47:47.140 --> 01:47:49.100]   there's a book called Breaking Open the Head
[01:47:49.100 --> 01:47:51.800]   by Daniel Pinchbeck that goes through
[01:47:51.800 --> 01:47:54.740]   and talks about this whole process.
[01:47:54.740 --> 01:47:58.080]   But essentially, the Gabonese have been using this
[01:47:58.080 --> 01:47:59.560]   for a long time.
[01:47:59.560 --> 01:48:03.860]   And it's a kind of an atypical psychedelic.
[01:48:03.860 --> 01:48:08.860]   It's not a psychedelic that we normally think about
[01:48:09.440 --> 01:48:11.680]   with psilocybin and LSD where there are visual
[01:48:11.680 --> 01:48:13.320]   perceptual changes.
[01:48:13.320 --> 01:48:16.520]   So if you take psilocybin or LSD,
[01:48:16.520 --> 01:48:19.580]   what you experience is you experience
[01:48:19.580 --> 01:48:22.680]   these kind of visual perceptual differences
[01:48:22.680 --> 01:48:24.440]   in the external world.
[01:48:24.440 --> 01:48:26.520]   On enough LSD or psilocybin,
[01:48:26.520 --> 01:48:29.600]   an individual can actually perceive something
[01:48:29.600 --> 01:48:32.480]   visually in the external world that isn't there,
[01:48:32.480 --> 01:48:33.840]   as we talked about earlier.
[01:48:33.840 --> 01:48:36.520]   Ibogaine doesn't do that.
[01:48:36.520 --> 01:48:37.920]   Ibogaine does something different.
[01:48:37.920 --> 01:48:40.420]   It's kind of like, have you ever seen Minority Report
[01:48:40.420 --> 01:48:41.980]   with the movie with Tom Cruise,
[01:48:41.980 --> 01:48:44.680]   I think 15 or 20 years ago or something,
[01:48:44.680 --> 01:48:45.560]   so it dates us a little bit.
[01:48:45.560 --> 01:48:49.640]   But it was this movie where he would be able to go
[01:48:49.640 --> 01:48:51.380]   and see these kind of pre-crimes
[01:48:51.380 --> 01:48:56.120]   and he had this big screen where he could look at scenes
[01:48:56.120 --> 01:49:00.160]   from time and kind of go through that scene and see it.
[01:49:00.160 --> 01:49:03.600]   And so what individuals taking Ibogaine will say
[01:49:03.600 --> 01:49:06.200]   is that open eyes, they don't see anything,
[01:49:06.200 --> 01:49:08.760]   but closed eyes, they'll go back through
[01:49:08.760 --> 01:49:13.120]   and re-experience earlier life memories
[01:49:13.120 --> 01:49:15.680]   and they will be able to experience it
[01:49:15.680 --> 01:49:20.680]   from a place of empathy, not only for themselves,
[01:49:20.680 --> 01:49:24.800]   but from others and kind of a detached empathy
[01:49:24.800 --> 01:49:28.240]   and being able to see this as almost a third party,
[01:49:28.240 --> 01:49:30.240]   even though they were there,
[01:49:30.240 --> 01:49:32.640]   but they're able to see it as a third party.
[01:49:32.640 --> 01:49:36.080]   So Claudio Naranjo, a psychiatrist from Argentina,
[01:49:36.080 --> 01:49:38.280]   described this with a lot of books that he wrote
[01:49:38.280 --> 01:49:41.100]   in I think the '80s and '90s around this.
[01:49:41.100 --> 01:49:44.880]   And so Ibogaine's been around for a long time.
[01:49:44.880 --> 01:49:48.000]   Howard Lotsoff, American guy that brought it over
[01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.760]   from Africa, he was a polysubstance user,
[01:49:50.760 --> 01:49:54.560]   used every drug that he had his hands on,
[01:49:54.560 --> 01:49:57.400]   took Ibogaine, and including a lot of other psychedelics
[01:49:57.400 --> 01:49:59.560]   by the way, took Ibogaine and then never did another drug
[01:49:59.560 --> 01:50:02.560]   again supposedly because he had such a profound
[01:50:02.560 --> 01:50:04.480]   Ibogaine experience.
[01:50:04.480 --> 01:50:07.600]   Ibogaine is in no way a recreational substance.
[01:50:07.600 --> 01:50:09.160]   It's not a recreational substance
[01:50:09.160 --> 01:50:11.080]   if you want it to be a recreational substance
[01:50:11.080 --> 01:50:13.380]   because you're essentially having this
[01:50:13.380 --> 01:50:14.960]   what they call life review.
[01:50:14.960 --> 01:50:17.600]   They also call it 10 years of psychotherapy in a night.
[01:50:17.600 --> 01:50:21.460]   So these are the terminology that people talk about.
[01:50:21.460 --> 01:50:22.700]   The issue-- - How long does it last?
[01:50:22.700 --> 01:50:24.040]   Is it truly one night?
[01:50:24.040 --> 01:50:26.340]   - It's usually, you know, it can go,
[01:50:26.340 --> 01:50:28.560]   depending upon if you get re-dosed or anything go,
[01:50:28.560 --> 01:50:31.360]   sometimes depending upon how fast you metabolize it,
[01:50:31.360 --> 01:50:33.680]   sometimes 24, sometimes 36 hours,
[01:50:33.680 --> 01:50:37.120]   sometimes it can be shorter, but it is a long time.
[01:50:37.120 --> 01:50:38.000]   It's a very long time.
[01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.920]   So it's definitely the longest acting
[01:50:40.920 --> 01:50:43.300]   psychedelic substance I know of.
[01:50:43.300 --> 01:50:48.300]   And so people, you know, will take this
[01:50:48.300 --> 01:50:52.640]   and they'll have this reevaluation of a given memory
[01:50:52.640 --> 01:50:54.140]   and then as we were talking earlier,
[01:50:54.140 --> 01:50:56.280]   reconsolidate that memory again
[01:50:56.280 --> 01:50:57.960]   and then it seems to have, you know,
[01:50:57.960 --> 01:51:00.500]   an effect of that reconsolidation process.
[01:51:00.500 --> 01:51:04.720]   And so, you know, about four or five years ago,
[01:51:04.720 --> 01:51:06.860]   I was tapped by Robert Malinka,
[01:51:06.860 --> 01:51:09.380]   one of the, you know, senior neuroscientists
[01:51:09.380 --> 01:51:10.820]   we both know in the university.
[01:51:10.820 --> 01:51:13.680]   He says, well, there's an unnamed donor
[01:51:13.680 --> 01:51:17.660]   that's very interested in funding a group,
[01:51:17.660 --> 01:51:21.460]   you know, a scientific kind of open label study
[01:51:21.460 --> 01:51:25.340]   of these Navy SEALs that have been going down to Mexico
[01:51:25.340 --> 01:51:29.720]   and taking Ibogaine and also, and I'm five MEO DMT,
[01:51:29.720 --> 01:51:33.500]   which I'll talk about in a second, to treat PTSD.
[01:51:33.500 --> 01:51:36.920]   You know, they claimed to have traumatic brain injury,
[01:51:36.920 --> 01:51:40.320]   depression, you know, that whole constellation of symptoms.
[01:51:40.320 --> 01:51:42.860]   You know, and as it was described to me
[01:51:42.860 --> 01:51:45.280]   by various people that had done this,
[01:51:45.280 --> 01:51:49.440]   by their spouses and whatnot, you know, John,
[01:51:49.440 --> 01:51:50.280]   we'll just say John.
[01:51:50.280 --> 01:51:53.900]   John couldn't screw a light into a light bulb
[01:51:53.900 --> 01:51:55.500]   into a light fixture, right?
[01:51:55.500 --> 01:51:58.100]   They just, they were just so debilitated,
[01:51:58.100 --> 01:52:00.640]   they couldn't do, you know, simple tasks,
[01:52:00.640 --> 01:52:02.940]   what we call activities of daily living.
[01:52:02.940 --> 01:52:04.620]   And they were coming back and having these
[01:52:04.620 --> 01:52:08.360]   really dramatic improvements in, you know,
[01:52:08.360 --> 01:52:10.800]   all aspects of life.
[01:52:10.800 --> 01:52:14.540]   And so, you know, we have over the last couple of years
[01:52:14.540 --> 01:52:19.400]   been able to do this first in human
[01:52:19.400 --> 01:52:22.160]   kind of full neurobiological, clinical,
[01:52:22.160 --> 01:52:26.780]   neurocognitive evaluation of what Ibogaine is doing.
[01:52:26.780 --> 01:52:30.800]   In this case, in special operations, special forces,
[01:52:30.800 --> 01:52:33.640]   individuals, former Navy Seals, former Army Rangers,
[01:52:33.640 --> 01:52:35.500]   that kind of crew of folks,
[01:52:35.500 --> 01:52:38.320]   and look at the pre-post changes that we,
[01:52:38.320 --> 01:52:40.120]   that their experience to be able to totally
[01:52:40.120 --> 01:52:41.120]   quantitate all of that.
[01:52:41.120 --> 01:52:44.480]   And so we've been able to capture all the clinical scales,
[01:52:44.480 --> 01:52:46.540]   you know, depression scales, PTSD scales,
[01:52:46.540 --> 01:52:48.560]   all that standard stuff, neurocognitive batteries.
[01:52:48.560 --> 01:52:51.160]   So how does your executive function work specifically?
[01:52:51.160 --> 01:52:53.640]   How does your verbal memory, all of that?
[01:52:53.640 --> 01:52:55.800]   And then neuroimaging and EEG.
[01:52:55.800 --> 01:52:59.880]   So this will be the first human study of Ibogaine for those.
[01:52:59.880 --> 01:53:03.700]   And the reason why is because Ibogaine is kind of the,
[01:53:03.700 --> 01:53:06.740]   both seemingly the most potent and most,
[01:53:06.740 --> 01:53:13.080]   seemingly to me at least most powerful psychedelic,
[01:53:13.080 --> 01:53:15.520]   but the one that has the most risk too,
[01:53:15.520 --> 01:53:17.400]   because it has a cardiac effect.
[01:53:17.400 --> 01:53:19.480]   It seems to be that you can screen people out
[01:53:19.480 --> 01:53:22.180]   that have risk off of their electrocardiogram
[01:53:22.180 --> 01:53:23.980]   and reduce the risk quite a bit.
[01:53:23.980 --> 01:53:25.380]   And that's what we all did.
[01:53:25.380 --> 01:53:29.260]   But that's why people haven't really studied it as much.
[01:53:29.260 --> 01:53:33.060]   And it isn't as, in addition, there's no, right.
[01:53:33.060 --> 01:53:34.480]   Nobody goes to rave on Ibogaine.
[01:53:34.480 --> 01:53:36.360]   There's no recreation at all with it.
[01:53:36.360 --> 01:53:37.700]   - It's not fun.
[01:53:37.700 --> 01:53:40.500]   - It's, people say that it's relieving,
[01:53:40.500 --> 01:53:42.540]   but it's hard work, right?
[01:53:42.540 --> 01:53:45.800]   Because yeah, you're re-examining things.
[01:53:45.800 --> 01:53:50.800]   And, you know, and so then we see these folks after,
[01:53:50.800 --> 01:53:52.040]   and I'll tell you, you know,
[01:53:52.040 --> 01:53:54.020]   we haven't fully analyzed the data yet,
[01:53:54.020 --> 01:53:56.740]   but I'll tell you that, you know,
[01:53:56.740 --> 01:54:00.020]   from what my folks are telling me, it's pretty dramatic.
[01:54:00.020 --> 01:54:02.560]   You know, people come back and they're doing,
[01:54:02.560 --> 01:54:03.740]   they're doing a lot better.
[01:54:03.740 --> 01:54:04.680]   They're doing a lot better.
[01:54:04.680 --> 01:54:07.580]   And nobody, I'll knock on wood,
[01:54:07.580 --> 01:54:12.580]   nobody's had any sort of a cardiac issue at all in,
[01:54:12.580 --> 01:54:15.500]   you know, in the cohort that we've studied.
[01:54:15.500 --> 01:54:20.340]   And they look a lot better and they feel a lot better too.
[01:54:20.340 --> 01:54:22.600]   And they describe these experiences
[01:54:22.600 --> 01:54:24.000]   of being able to go back through.
[01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:27.380]   And, you know, soldiers experience
[01:54:27.380 --> 01:54:28.960]   something called moral injury, right?
[01:54:28.960 --> 01:54:32.240]   Where they, maybe they accidentally blew something up
[01:54:32.240 --> 01:54:34.220]   and it had a kid in it or something like that.
[01:54:34.220 --> 01:54:36.960]   You know, if they're in Afghanistan or Iraq,
[01:54:36.960 --> 01:54:39.100]   maybe a child died on accident,
[01:54:39.100 --> 01:54:42.480]   or maybe, you know, a civilian died or whatever it was,
[01:54:42.480 --> 01:54:45.040]   right, and they suffer these moral injuries
[01:54:45.040 --> 01:54:46.040]   as part of the job.
[01:54:46.040 --> 01:54:47.940]   And it's almost one of the kind of, you know,
[01:54:47.940 --> 01:54:49.400]   vocational risks.
[01:54:49.400 --> 01:54:53.460]   They come back and say that they've forgiven themselves,
[01:54:53.460 --> 01:54:55.500]   you know, which is huge, right?
[01:54:55.500 --> 01:54:58.480]   And part of that is being able to see themself
[01:54:58.480 --> 01:55:01.580]   in a different light and having empathy finally for themself
[01:55:01.580 --> 01:55:05.240]   and being able to kind of have that experience of forgiving.
[01:55:05.240 --> 01:55:07.640]   And so, very cool.
[01:55:07.640 --> 01:55:11.180]   The study, you know, what was happening
[01:55:11.180 --> 01:55:12.320]   was they were taking Ibogaine
[01:55:12.320 --> 01:55:14.480]   and then taking something called 5-MeO DMT,
[01:55:14.480 --> 01:55:15.460]   people call the toad.
[01:55:15.460 --> 01:55:19.940]   It's the Sonoran River toad, I think.
[01:55:19.940 --> 01:55:21.700]   It's like, you can find these in Mexico,
[01:55:21.700 --> 01:55:22.980]   find them in Arizona.
[01:55:22.980 --> 01:55:28.900]   In the back of the toad produces something called 5-MeO DMT,
[01:55:28.900 --> 01:55:32.980]   which is a, you know, flavor of DMT
[01:55:32.980 --> 01:55:35.940]   that produces a particular psychedelic effect,
[01:55:35.940 --> 01:55:38.500]   also used as a sacrament.
[01:55:38.500 --> 01:55:40.540]   - Is it a dimethyltryptamine?
[01:55:40.540 --> 01:55:44.420]   - It is a 5-MeO dimethyltryptamine.
[01:55:44.420 --> 01:55:46.140]   So it's a kind of dimethyltryptamine
[01:55:46.140 --> 01:55:47.740]   with a kind of addition to it.
[01:55:47.740 --> 01:55:52.740]   The deal there is that it lasts longer than traditional DMT.
[01:55:52.740 --> 01:55:56.420]   You know, it's like 20 minutes to five,
[01:55:56.420 --> 01:55:58.540]   three or whatever kind of thing.
[01:55:58.540 --> 01:56:02.620]   And so then, so these guys were taking Ibogaine
[01:56:02.620 --> 01:56:04.660]   and then they would take the 5-MeO DMT
[01:56:04.660 --> 01:56:07.780]   after we had to kind of divorce those two things,
[01:56:07.780 --> 01:56:08.600]   be able to do the study
[01:56:08.600 --> 01:56:10.500]   and just understand what Ibogaine was doing.
[01:56:10.500 --> 01:56:11.860]   And they go back down a month later
[01:56:11.860 --> 01:56:14.100]   and they'll do the 5-MeO DMT.
[01:56:14.100 --> 01:56:16.300]   - So two completely separate sessions.
[01:56:16.300 --> 01:56:17.820]   - Two completely separate sessions.
[01:56:17.820 --> 01:56:19.340]   - And then one quick question about Ibogaine
[01:56:19.340 --> 01:56:22.580]   before a bit more on 5-MeO DMT.
[01:56:22.580 --> 01:56:25.080]   Is the Ibogaine journey guided
[01:56:25.080 --> 01:56:26.700]   or the person just closes their eyes
[01:56:26.700 --> 01:56:27.940]   and they just start falling
[01:56:27.940 --> 01:56:30.060]   into the back catalog of memories?
[01:56:30.060 --> 01:56:32.460]   - They have a bunch of preparatory sessions
[01:56:32.460 --> 01:56:34.260]   and then they have a bunch of sessions after
[01:56:34.260 --> 01:56:37.500]   that they kind of, they're able to kind of rehash things.
[01:56:37.500 --> 01:56:39.700]   During, there's a sitter that sits there
[01:56:39.700 --> 01:56:43.300]   and kind of sits with them and helps them out,
[01:56:43.300 --> 01:56:45.900]   but it's not, it's pretty,
[01:56:45.900 --> 01:56:48.000]   the phenomenon of the drug seems
[01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:49.860]   to drive a lot of this, right?
[01:56:49.860 --> 01:56:51.340]   And so a lot of it ends up being
[01:56:51.340 --> 01:56:52.820]   what we call supportive psychotherapy,
[01:56:52.820 --> 01:56:55.180]   or just kind of being there and, you know,
[01:56:55.180 --> 01:56:56.240]   maybe you're holding the person's hand,
[01:56:56.240 --> 01:56:59.380]   maybe you're just saying I'm here or maybe whatever it is,
[01:56:59.380 --> 01:57:01.540]   but you're making sure they know you're around,
[01:57:01.540 --> 01:57:02.740]   but you're not really,
[01:57:02.740 --> 01:57:05.180]   there's not really an interaction per se.
[01:57:05.180 --> 01:57:08.100]   And then the whole kind of goal there is just to get,
[01:57:08.100 --> 01:57:09.760]   to get folks to kind of go back through
[01:57:09.760 --> 01:57:11.840]   and re-examine these memories
[01:57:11.840 --> 01:57:15.160]   and ultimately look like they reconsolidate them.
[01:57:15.160 --> 01:57:17.960]   And, you know, it's very interesting.
[01:57:17.960 --> 01:57:22.200]   I mean, there's this kind of, as you said earlier,
[01:57:22.200 --> 01:57:25.520]   Timothy Leary kind of socio-cultural construct
[01:57:25.520 --> 01:57:28.520]   that ends up being overlaid over psychedelics.
[01:57:28.520 --> 01:57:33.520]   And what I think is that if you rid yourself
[01:57:33.520 --> 01:57:36.000]   of all of those preconceived notions
[01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.920]   of what it is and isn't and the counterculture movement,
[01:57:38.920 --> 01:57:41.280]   all that stuff that neither of us were ever involved in,
[01:57:41.280 --> 01:57:43.800]   neither of us are ever partaken, you know,
[01:57:43.800 --> 01:57:46.240]   as kind of straight scientists looking at this, right?
[01:57:46.240 --> 01:57:47.360]   If you can kind of rid yourself
[01:57:47.360 --> 01:57:49.960]   of all those socio-cultural constructions
[01:57:49.960 --> 01:57:51.760]   and then re-examine this,
[01:57:51.760 --> 01:57:54.720]   these, if we just discovered these today,
[01:57:54.720 --> 01:57:58.000]   we would say that these sorts of drugs
[01:57:58.000 --> 01:57:59.900]   are a huge breakthrough in psychiatry
[01:57:59.900 --> 01:58:01.960]   because they allow for us to do
[01:58:01.960 --> 01:58:04.520]   a lot of the sorts of things we've been thinking about
[01:58:04.520 --> 01:58:06.640]   with SSRIs, with psychotherapy,
[01:58:06.640 --> 01:58:09.080]   but kind of combined, right?
[01:58:09.080 --> 01:58:13.680]   Psychotherapy plus drugs in a substance
[01:58:13.680 --> 01:58:16.400]   that kind of allows you to re-examine these things.
[01:58:16.400 --> 01:58:18.860]   And so it's interesting, you know,
[01:58:18.860 --> 01:58:22.080]   there's a lot to do to try to figure out if that's true,
[01:58:22.080 --> 01:58:25.200]   you know, and I can say that as it stands right now,
[01:58:25.200 --> 01:58:28.520]   we don't know if that statement is true, right?
[01:58:28.520 --> 01:58:30.400]   There's a lot more work that needs to happen
[01:58:30.400 --> 01:58:32.080]   for that statement to be proven to be true.
[01:58:32.080 --> 01:58:35.880]   But the hypothesis is if it is true,
[01:58:35.880 --> 01:58:39.520]   then it's very likely that this will be seen
[01:58:39.520 --> 01:58:41.920]   as a breakthrough because it allows you
[01:58:41.920 --> 01:58:44.320]   to do these sorts of things that you can't do
[01:58:44.320 --> 01:58:46.760]   with normal waking consciousness.
[01:58:46.760 --> 01:58:50.040]   But also why we have to really think about this
[01:58:50.040 --> 01:58:55.040]   and you know, these drugs can't be recreational drugs.
[01:58:55.040 --> 01:58:58.580]   They really shouldn't be recreational drugs, right?
[01:58:58.580 --> 01:59:01.760]   They're really too powerful to be used
[01:59:01.760 --> 01:59:03.420]   in the context of recreation
[01:59:03.420 --> 01:59:06.380]   because they can put you into these states.
[01:59:06.380 --> 01:59:10.020]   And this generation of psychedelic researchers
[01:59:10.020 --> 01:59:11.900]   are really clear about that.
[01:59:11.900 --> 01:59:14.580]   You know, I think the '60s folks were not clear about that
[01:59:14.580 --> 01:59:17.460]   and they felt like there was this whole kind of cultural
[01:59:17.460 --> 01:59:19.340]   thing that was going on there.
[01:59:19.340 --> 01:59:23.240]   But I think this cohort of individuals really understands
[01:59:23.240 --> 01:59:25.640]   that in order to really make this happen,
[01:59:25.640 --> 01:59:29.020]   we have to understand that if you need a prescription
[01:59:29.020 --> 01:59:32.640]   for an SSRI, which doesn't change your consciousness
[01:59:32.640 --> 01:59:35.740]   a whole lot and we're very worried about that
[01:59:35.740 --> 01:59:38.620]   and the doctor has to evaluate you for that every week,
[01:59:38.620 --> 01:59:42.080]   the idea that some of these substances would go outside
[01:59:42.080 --> 01:59:44.540]   of very strict medical supervision
[01:59:44.540 --> 01:59:47.040]   is kind of preposterous actually.
[01:59:47.040 --> 01:59:51.220]   It's kind of a dumb moment I think for all of medicine
[01:59:51.220 --> 01:59:53.860]   to say look, if we're gonna do this right,
[01:59:53.860 --> 01:59:56.860]   we've gotta do it in such a way that's so protected,
[01:59:56.860 --> 02:00:00.180]   that's so safe that we make sure people know
[02:00:00.180 --> 02:00:02.060]   these things are not recreational
[02:00:02.060 --> 02:00:04.160]   and they're really for the pure purposes
[02:00:04.160 --> 02:00:08.540]   of really powerfully changing cognition for a while
[02:00:08.540 --> 02:00:10.440]   and letting people have these,
[02:00:10.440 --> 02:00:14.020]   what seemed to be, you know, relatively therapeutic states.
[02:00:14.020 --> 02:00:15.720]   - I think it's great that you're doing this study
[02:00:15.720 --> 02:00:19.260]   and along the lines of the sort of the early iterations
[02:00:19.260 --> 02:00:22.360]   of psychedelics and the counterculture of the '60s and '70s,
[02:00:22.360 --> 02:00:24.900]   some of which took place like one flow of the cuckoo's nest
[02:00:24.900 --> 02:00:28.900]   I think is actually based on the Menlo Park VA,
[02:00:28.900 --> 02:00:32.900]   which is, you know, in our neighborhood of Stanford.
[02:00:32.900 --> 02:00:34.700]   And things are quite a bit different now.
[02:00:34.700 --> 02:00:38.180]   I know you and I have spent some time with the operators
[02:00:38.180 --> 02:00:41.080]   and former operators at an event and last Veterans Day.
[02:00:41.080 --> 02:00:43.820]   In fact, the so-called Veterans Solutions Group
[02:00:43.820 --> 02:00:46.980]   that's pioneering a lot of these psychedelic treatments
[02:00:46.980 --> 02:00:49.340]   for former special operators and current special operators.
[02:00:49.340 --> 02:00:53.020]   And what's interesting to me about that is in contrast
[02:00:53.020 --> 02:00:57.220]   to the counterculture movement of the '60s and '70s,
[02:00:57.220 --> 02:00:59.520]   that room was filled with people that are very much
[02:00:59.520 --> 02:01:01.720]   of a structure, the military, right?
[02:01:01.720 --> 02:01:05.460]   So it's no longer considered left-wing, right-wing,
[02:01:05.460 --> 02:01:06.940]   anti-military, pro-military.
[02:01:06.940 --> 02:01:09.060]   Here, this is just about one group of people
[02:01:09.060 --> 02:01:10.900]   who's exploring psychedelics as a treatment
[02:01:10.900 --> 02:01:13.940]   for trauma and PTSD and other things.
[02:01:13.940 --> 02:01:16.380]   And of course you also have other domains of society
[02:01:16.380 --> 02:01:17.220]   looking at this.
[02:01:17.220 --> 02:01:18.860]   And in fact, there were, it was really interesting
[02:01:18.860 --> 02:01:23.860]   because there were both far left and far right politicians
[02:01:23.860 --> 02:01:26.620]   at that event up on stage together
[02:01:26.620 --> 02:01:30.260]   talking about in kind of a lighter terms heart medicine,
[02:01:30.260 --> 02:01:31.940]   but also talking about neurobiology
[02:01:31.940 --> 02:01:35.340]   and it was just fascinating from the perspective
[02:01:35.340 --> 02:01:36.880]   of somebody who's trying to learn about this stuff
[02:01:36.880 --> 02:01:40.300]   that psychedelic therapies no longer sit
[02:01:40.300 --> 02:01:43.300]   within the anti-establishment realm.
[02:01:43.300 --> 02:01:47.620]   It's both, it's independent of all that.
[02:01:47.620 --> 02:01:49.580]   Certainly when people in the military are adopting it
[02:01:49.580 --> 02:01:51.100]   as a potential treatment.
[02:01:51.100 --> 02:01:52.620]   Again, still under exploration,
[02:01:52.620 --> 02:01:55.580]   but also under exploration at universities like Stanford
[02:01:55.580 --> 02:01:58.980]   and Johns Hopkins and UCSF and University College London
[02:01:58.980 --> 02:02:00.580]   and on and on.
[02:02:00.580 --> 02:02:03.140]   Along the lines of tree barks and toad skins,
[02:02:03.140 --> 02:02:09.080]   tell me about ayahuasca and as a plant, it's intriguing.
[02:02:09.080 --> 02:02:14.600]   And is it a pro-serotonergic drug like psilocybin?
[02:02:14.600 --> 02:02:19.760]   And is it useful for the same sorts of conditions
[02:02:19.760 --> 02:02:21.860]   that we've talked about thus far?
[02:02:21.860 --> 02:02:24.540]   And if you could perhaps tell me a little bit also
[02:02:24.540 --> 02:02:26.700]   about the Brazilian prisoner study.
[02:02:26.700 --> 02:02:28.580]   - Yeah, yeah, definitely.
[02:02:28.580 --> 02:02:30.540]   Ayahuasca is another psychedelic.
[02:02:30.540 --> 02:02:35.540]   It's used as a sacrament in Brazil and in Peru
[02:02:35.540 --> 02:02:38.160]   and Ecuador and Colombia.
[02:02:38.160 --> 02:02:41.020]   So a lot of the South American countries
[02:02:41.020 --> 02:02:46.020]   and what they do is they combine two plants together
[02:02:46.020 --> 02:02:50.940]   where one plant of the two plant combination
[02:02:50.940 --> 02:02:53.220]   would effectively do nothing,
[02:02:53.220 --> 02:02:55.900]   but the two plant combination together
[02:02:55.900 --> 02:03:00.900]   is capable of producing this very profound psychedelic effect
[02:03:00.900 --> 02:03:06.620]   and what's really kind of curious is that there are,
[02:03:06.620 --> 02:03:11.620]   as I understand it, 10 to 20,000 plant species in the Amazon
[02:03:11.620 --> 02:03:17.020]   and somehow somebody-- - Someone tried them all.
[02:03:17.020 --> 02:03:19.440]   - Combined these two plants together
[02:03:19.440 --> 02:03:23.780]   in certain proportionality and cooked this for five,
[02:03:23.780 --> 02:03:26.660]   10 hours to the point where you cook out
[02:03:26.660 --> 02:03:28.940]   the dimethyltryptamine out of one of the plants
[02:03:28.940 --> 02:03:32.900]   and cook out the reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor
[02:03:32.900 --> 02:03:35.500]   out of the other plant, it's such a way
[02:03:35.500 --> 02:03:38.900]   that the reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor
[02:03:38.900 --> 02:03:43.500]   prevents the GI breakdown of the dimethyltryptamine
[02:03:43.500 --> 02:03:45.260]   in such a way that it's then allowed
[02:03:45.260 --> 02:03:49.320]   to cross the blood-brain barrier and get into the brain.
[02:03:49.320 --> 02:03:51.540]   And if you didn't add the reversible
[02:03:51.540 --> 02:03:54.580]   monoamine oxidase inhibitor plant-derived
[02:03:54.580 --> 02:03:58.500]   into this combination, then it would never cross the brain.
[02:03:58.500 --> 02:04:03.100]   If you put people on a standard psychiatry-prescribed
[02:04:03.100 --> 02:04:05.920]   monoamine oxidase inhibitor that wasn't reversible,
[02:04:05.920 --> 02:04:09.980]   you'd throw them into serotonin syndrome, right?
[02:04:09.980 --> 02:04:13.340]   So this kind of like sweet spot
[02:04:13.340 --> 02:04:17.020]   that somehow ayahuasca practitioners have found
[02:04:17.020 --> 02:04:21.440]   being able to get DMT into the brain from an oral source
[02:04:21.440 --> 02:04:24.840]   with this combination of a monoamine oxidase inhibitor
[02:04:24.840 --> 02:04:29.800]   is curious and so that substance has been explored
[02:04:29.800 --> 02:04:31.540]   as an antidepressant agent
[02:04:31.540 --> 02:04:33.860]   and some studies have looked at that.
[02:04:33.860 --> 02:04:35.900]   It also seems to be very safe.
[02:04:35.900 --> 02:04:40.140]   There was a psychiatrist down at UCLA Harbor
[02:04:40.140 --> 02:04:41.800]   who's done a lot of work with this
[02:04:41.800 --> 02:04:46.040]   where he's looked at children even that have been exposed
[02:04:46.040 --> 02:04:49.660]   to small doses of ayahuasca as a kind of a sacrament
[02:04:49.660 --> 02:04:53.720]   within Amazonian tribes and found no neurocognitive effects,
[02:04:53.720 --> 02:04:56.160]   no neurocognitive effects in adults.
[02:04:56.160 --> 02:04:59.240]   And so it appears to be safe.
[02:04:59.240 --> 02:05:05.000]   It's kind of part and brought into various religions,
[02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:08.480]   including kind of merged with Catholicism in South America,
[02:05:08.480 --> 02:05:10.220]   which is kind of very interesting.
[02:05:10.220 --> 02:05:15.220]   And so in some sects of Catholicism in Brazil,
[02:05:15.220 --> 02:05:20.220]   it's used as a sacrament during religious ceremonies.
[02:05:20.220 --> 02:05:25.300]   And so it became interesting to Brazilian researchers
[02:05:25.300 --> 02:05:28.440]   as to whether or not they could affect recidivism rates
[02:05:28.440 --> 02:05:31.800]   for prisoners in Brazilian prisons, right?
[02:05:31.800 --> 02:05:34.340]   So they gave half of the prisoners
[02:05:34.340 --> 02:05:37.680]   some sort of inert substance
[02:05:37.680 --> 02:05:41.940]   and half of the prisoners an ayahuasca session
[02:05:41.940 --> 02:05:45.820]   and the recidivism rate or the return to prison rate
[02:05:45.820 --> 02:05:47.920]   in the ayahuasca exposed individuals
[02:05:47.920 --> 02:05:50.400]   was statistically significantly lower
[02:05:50.400 --> 02:05:53.560]   than the recidivism rate in the control group,
[02:05:53.560 --> 02:05:58.040]   suggesting that whatever's going on there
[02:05:58.040 --> 02:06:02.360]   seems to have an effect on whatever drives criminal behavior
[02:06:02.360 --> 02:06:04.320]   or whatever criminal behavior that happened to be.
[02:06:04.320 --> 02:06:06.060]   And I don't have the details
[02:06:06.060 --> 02:06:07.760]   on the exact nature of the crime.
[02:06:07.760 --> 02:06:10.640]   I am also in no way saying
[02:06:10.640 --> 02:06:12.340]   that we should just be giving psychedelics
[02:06:12.340 --> 02:06:15.000]   to folks in prison and all of that.
[02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:18.740]   I think that that is a very edgy thing to do
[02:06:18.740 --> 02:06:21.320]   and probably not something that anybody should try,
[02:06:21.320 --> 02:06:25.420]   but it does kind of bring up this curious question
[02:06:25.420 --> 02:06:28.520]   of what is it about that that would drive people
[02:06:28.520 --> 02:06:31.220]   to change those behaviors
[02:06:31.220 --> 02:06:34.960]   and why do people make those behavioral decisions?
[02:06:34.960 --> 02:06:36.780]   And a lot of times,
[02:06:36.780 --> 02:06:39.440]   if you look at prisons in the United States,
[02:06:40.360 --> 02:06:41.200]   people say this,
[02:06:41.200 --> 02:06:42.680]   what's the biggest mental health facility
[02:06:42.680 --> 02:06:44.000]   in the United States?
[02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:44.820]   It's a prison.
[02:06:44.820 --> 02:06:49.460]   - Yeah, there's a lot to unpack there for sure.
[02:06:49.460 --> 02:06:54.340]   The homeless issue, the prison issue,
[02:06:54.340 --> 02:06:58.040]   it does lead to something that I heard recently,
[02:06:58.040 --> 02:07:01.860]   which is related to all this, which is cannabis.
[02:07:01.860 --> 02:07:04.860]   We hear a lot nowadays about people will say,
[02:07:04.860 --> 02:07:06.080]   well, it's safer than alcohol.
[02:07:06.080 --> 02:07:07.440]   And we did an episode on alcohol
[02:07:07.440 --> 02:07:10.400]   that at least by my read of the literature,
[02:07:10.400 --> 02:07:14.800]   indeed alcohol does seem to be quite bad for our health.
[02:07:14.800 --> 02:07:16.960]   I think it's pretty clear that not drinking
[02:07:16.960 --> 02:07:19.640]   is better for your health than drinking at all.
[02:07:19.640 --> 02:07:21.280]   And here, I'm not trying to tell people what to do,
[02:07:21.280 --> 02:07:22.680]   but those are what the data say
[02:07:22.680 --> 02:07:24.400]   and forget the studies on red wine.
[02:07:24.400 --> 02:07:25.680]   You'd have to drink so much red wine
[02:07:25.680 --> 02:07:26.880]   to get enough resveratrol.
[02:07:26.880 --> 02:07:28.880]   It's not even clear what resveratrol does anything useful
[02:07:28.880 --> 02:07:31.080]   anyway, et cetera, et cetera.
[02:07:31.080 --> 02:07:33.360]   Nonetheless, cannabis is now available
[02:07:33.360 --> 02:07:35.760]   in a lot of very high potency forms.
[02:07:35.760 --> 02:07:38.340]   People are vaping cannabis.
[02:07:38.340 --> 02:07:40.280]   People are smoking cannabis.
[02:07:40.280 --> 02:07:42.120]   I certainly am not saying that cannabis
[02:07:42.120 --> 02:07:43.840]   is bad for people necessarily,
[02:07:43.840 --> 02:07:45.580]   although I think children,
[02:07:45.580 --> 02:07:47.640]   I would like to hope that their brain development
[02:07:47.640 --> 02:07:50.200]   would be completed first, get to age 25.
[02:07:50.200 --> 02:07:52.840]   I know that sounds late for a lot of people,
[02:07:52.840 --> 02:07:57.840]   but the THC obviously taps into some endogenous systems
[02:07:57.840 --> 02:08:03.420]   and the cannabinoid systems and is powerful.
[02:08:03.420 --> 02:08:08.420]   And I've seen this report that was in Lancet Psychiatry
[02:08:08.420 --> 02:08:12.780]   this last year that said that early use of potent cannabis,
[02:08:12.780 --> 02:08:17.320]   meaning age 14 to 20 or so can potentially lead
[02:08:17.320 --> 02:08:20.620]   to an exacerbation of psychosis later in life.
[02:08:20.620 --> 02:08:22.840]   And I actually put this out on social media
[02:08:22.840 --> 02:08:25.000]   and it sort of exploded.
[02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:26.720]   I didn't expect it to.
[02:08:26.720 --> 02:08:28.240]   When people were saying, "Well, that's not causal."
[02:08:28.240 --> 02:08:31.160]   And obviously it's not causal because people say,
[02:08:31.160 --> 02:08:33.940]   "Well, maybe people with psychotic tendencies
[02:08:33.940 --> 02:08:35.140]   are seeking out cannabis."
[02:08:35.140 --> 02:08:36.740]   Although that's sort of a weak argument
[02:08:36.740 --> 02:08:40.300]   in the sense that there's at least a four times,
[02:08:40.300 --> 02:08:44.380]   four X increase in these psychotic episodes
[02:08:44.380 --> 02:08:45.560]   for people later in life.
[02:08:45.560 --> 02:08:46.760]   But what are your thoughts about cannabis?
[02:08:46.760 --> 02:08:47.820]   Because I do want to acknowledge
[02:08:47.820 --> 02:08:50.380]   that it does have medical benefits for certain things,
[02:08:50.380 --> 02:08:52.600]   pain, chemotherapy.
[02:08:52.600 --> 02:08:55.100]   So by no means trying to knock on cannabis
[02:08:55.100 --> 02:08:57.420]   and its appropriate medicinal use.
[02:08:57.420 --> 02:09:01.100]   But what should we think about cannabis
[02:09:01.100 --> 02:09:05.380]   in terms of this finding that can exacerbate a psychosis
[02:09:05.380 --> 02:09:06.500]   in certain individuals?
[02:09:06.500 --> 02:09:10.860]   - Yeah, so I think there's a couple of things, right?
[02:09:10.860 --> 02:09:14.400]   So cannabis is multiple cannabinoids, right?
[02:09:14.400 --> 02:09:18.720]   - THC, CBD, CBN, sativas, and indicas.
[02:09:18.720 --> 02:09:21.220]   Yeah, there's a lot there to unpack.
[02:09:21.220 --> 02:09:22.620]   - Yeah, there's a lot.
[02:09:22.620 --> 02:09:26.840]   But there are two main kind of chemicals you think about
[02:09:26.840 --> 02:09:30.700]   and kind of how things are essentially bred, right?
[02:09:30.700 --> 02:09:33.760]   And so there's a lot of cannabis
[02:09:33.760 --> 02:09:38.140]   that's really bred to be very high, very potent THC.
[02:09:38.140 --> 02:09:41.700]   And there's cannabis where the THC is bred completely out.
[02:09:41.700 --> 02:09:46.340]   So there's stories from Colorado, right,
[02:09:46.340 --> 02:09:49.980]   this strain of cannabis that's THC-free.
[02:09:49.980 --> 02:09:53.460]   There's no THC at all, and it's all CBD.
[02:09:53.460 --> 02:09:56.040]   And it's called Charlotte's Web.
[02:09:56.040 --> 02:09:59.940]   And a bunch of kids' parents, one kid,
[02:09:59.940 --> 02:10:01.820]   and then kind of a string of parents after that
[02:10:01.820 --> 02:10:05.460]   moved to Colorado when cannabis was legalized
[02:10:05.460 --> 02:10:09.540]   because CBD is anti-epileptic.
[02:10:09.540 --> 02:10:13.580]   So CBD is also antipsychotic.
[02:10:13.580 --> 02:10:15.180]   And so there've been a number of studies
[02:10:15.180 --> 02:10:18.400]   that if you give CBD at high doses,
[02:10:18.400 --> 02:10:21.500]   it's antipsychotic in schizophrenic,
[02:10:21.500 --> 02:10:24.580]   established schizophrenic patients.
[02:10:24.580 --> 02:10:28.220]   The issue is that we've bred CBD out of marijuana
[02:10:28.220 --> 02:10:29.500]   selectively over time.
[02:10:29.500 --> 02:10:32.340]   We've gotten very good at figuring out how to do that, right?
[02:10:32.340 --> 02:10:37.340]   Conversely, THC is propsychotic and pro-epileptic, right?
[02:10:37.340 --> 02:10:43.640]   And so when you talk about does cannabis cause psychosis
[02:10:43.640 --> 02:10:46.340]   or does cannabis treat psychosis,
[02:10:46.340 --> 02:10:50.900]   it appears to be more related to the proportions of CBD
[02:10:50.900 --> 02:10:55.020]   to THC than it does to the kind of idea of cannabis.
[02:10:55.020 --> 02:10:58.820]   So for me, there's a, and I have no stock in this
[02:10:58.820 --> 02:10:59.820]   or anything like that,
[02:10:59.820 --> 02:11:01.900]   but there's a company called GW Pharmaceuticals,
[02:11:01.900 --> 02:11:03.380]   and I haven't looked into them in a while,
[02:11:03.380 --> 02:11:07.360]   but they have a lot of clinical trials
[02:11:07.360 --> 02:11:09.260]   for something called Dravet syndrome,
[02:11:09.260 --> 02:11:12.020]   which is a seizure disorder where kids seize a whole lot.
[02:11:12.020 --> 02:11:15.220]   Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, which is a seizure disorder
[02:11:15.220 --> 02:11:16.860]   where kids are seizing 300 times a day.
[02:11:16.860 --> 02:11:19.220]   Both of these are like kids are seizing so much,
[02:11:19.220 --> 02:11:20.820]   they're basically in a seizure
[02:11:20.820 --> 02:11:23.940]   or in the post-ictal phase constantly.
[02:11:23.940 --> 02:11:25.700]   And they've failed everything.
[02:11:25.700 --> 02:11:28.660]   They've failed barbiturates, they've failed bromides,
[02:11:28.660 --> 02:11:32.700]   which we just don't use anymore except in these cases
[02:11:32.700 --> 02:11:34.060]   because of the side effects.
[02:11:34.060 --> 02:11:35.520]   And they'll give kids CBD.
[02:11:35.520 --> 02:11:37.480]   And I think CBD is a pretty safe drug
[02:11:37.480 --> 02:11:39.140]   compared to bromide, right?
[02:11:39.140 --> 02:11:44.140]   And so this idea that CBD in a kid is actually safe.
[02:11:44.140 --> 02:11:48.860]   It's a cannabinoid, but it's CBD and it's safe, right?
[02:11:48.860 --> 02:11:52.400]   And so that to me is totally fine.
[02:11:52.400 --> 02:11:55.860]   Also giving CBD as an adjunct of treatment
[02:11:55.860 --> 02:11:58.980]   for schizophrenia, there've been some positive trials
[02:11:58.980 --> 02:11:59.860]   and negative trials in that,
[02:11:59.860 --> 02:12:01.780]   but there seems to be no negative side effects.
[02:12:01.780 --> 02:12:04.880]   It seems to reduce some of the metabolic syndrome issues
[02:12:04.880 --> 02:12:08.080]   in folks with schizophrenia who are having side effects
[02:12:08.080 --> 02:12:09.880]   from the primary antipsychotic.
[02:12:09.880 --> 02:12:13.380]   The converse is there's clearly cases
[02:12:13.380 --> 02:12:17.180]   where people that are taking very high doses of THC
[02:12:17.180 --> 02:12:21.040]   become psychotic, they get put into the psychiatric unit,
[02:12:21.040 --> 02:12:24.440]   nothing happens other than they kind of get the THC
[02:12:24.440 --> 02:12:27.980]   out of their system and then they resolve their psychosis.
[02:12:27.980 --> 02:12:34.720]   And a handful of people who've had seizures related
[02:12:34.720 --> 02:12:38.380]   to high doses of THC and syncope and all sorts of things.
[02:12:38.380 --> 02:12:43.260]   And so this idea that THC, high doses of THC
[02:12:43.260 --> 02:12:46.900]   can be propsychotic is also not taking a shot at people
[02:12:46.900 --> 02:12:49.860]   that think that cannabis overall is a good thing.
[02:12:49.860 --> 02:12:52.000]   It just is what it is.
[02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:54.540]   And the kind of pure, I think if you zoom back
[02:12:54.540 --> 02:12:56.860]   and you say, you're a true naturalist,
[02:12:56.860 --> 02:12:59.420]   you're thinking about natural medicines in the world,
[02:12:59.420 --> 02:13:02.700]   you should think, well, probably marijuana was balanced
[02:13:02.700 --> 02:13:06.860]   THC, CBD at some point and then we humans messed with it.
[02:13:06.860 --> 02:13:11.860]   And that most likely that was probably okay at some level
[02:13:11.860 --> 02:13:16.100]   and then we pushed it one way or another.
[02:13:16.100 --> 02:13:19.380]   And what I mean by okay is in a 45 year old,
[02:13:19.380 --> 02:13:21.020]   it's okay kind of thing.
[02:13:21.840 --> 02:13:26.360]   Now, what I think is going on with the kids,
[02:13:26.360 --> 02:13:29.500]   with the teenagers is you've got prefrontal maturation,
[02:13:29.500 --> 02:13:31.880]   and then you're exposing them to a whole lot
[02:13:31.880 --> 02:13:35.340]   of high THC load.
[02:13:35.340 --> 02:13:40.340]   And while it's unclear if it's cause or effect,
[02:13:40.340 --> 02:13:42.120]   it's certainly in the picture.
[02:13:42.120 --> 02:13:43.660]   And if I were a parent,
[02:13:43.660 --> 02:13:46.800]   I wouldn't want my 16 year old smoking marijuana.
[02:13:46.800 --> 02:13:49.560]   If I were a parent in my 30 year old,
[02:13:49.560 --> 02:13:54.560]   otherwise healthy, totally fine, whatever,
[02:13:54.560 --> 02:13:58.860]   banker, lawyer, kid decided to try marijuana
[02:13:58.860 --> 02:14:01.860]   for the first time, I wouldn't scold them about it, right?
[02:14:01.860 --> 02:14:03.860]   So I think it's kind of a different thing, right?
[02:14:03.860 --> 02:14:07.360]   I would never want my up to 25 year old,
[02:14:07.360 --> 02:14:09.780]   just like you're saying before prefrontal maturation
[02:14:09.780 --> 02:14:13.340]   of never want my kid to be exposed at all.
[02:14:13.340 --> 02:14:17.980]   But it looks like except in susceptible individuals
[02:14:17.980 --> 02:14:19.940]   that are susceptible to drug induced psychosis,
[02:14:19.940 --> 02:14:24.940]   it looks like it's a relatively safe thing
[02:14:24.940 --> 02:14:27.040]   past prefrontal maturation.
[02:14:27.040 --> 02:14:31.260]   Again, I'm not gonna comment of cause and effect,
[02:14:31.260 --> 02:14:35.980]   but I would say that if you're a parent,
[02:14:35.980 --> 02:14:37.700]   it doesn't make much sense, right?
[02:14:37.700 --> 02:14:40.700]   You never know what's ultimately gonna hurt your kid.
[02:14:40.700 --> 02:14:42.580]   I mean, we were talking about this earlier,
[02:14:42.580 --> 02:14:45.800]   my wife's pregnant now, she kind of avoids everything,
[02:14:45.800 --> 02:14:48.980]   right, rightfully so, right, this idea that we just,
[02:14:48.980 --> 02:14:51.180]   we wanna be careful when our children's brains
[02:14:51.180 --> 02:14:52.760]   are developing and I think that's really
[02:14:52.760 --> 02:14:55.560]   what you were saying and I think actually important.
[02:14:55.560 --> 02:14:57.640]   The bigger question that you asked,
[02:14:57.640 --> 02:15:01.220]   which is relative risks of drugs is an interesting one.
[02:15:01.220 --> 02:15:04.100]   So David Nutt published in, I think it was in the Lancet,
[02:15:04.100 --> 02:15:06.260]   I'll have to look it up, but I think in the Lancet,
[02:15:06.260 --> 02:15:09.500]   an article about relative drug risks
[02:15:09.500 --> 02:15:11.180]   for the person and for society.
[02:15:11.180 --> 02:15:16.180]   And this was like, he was on the UK's like British
[02:15:16.180 --> 02:15:21.920]   drug policy group where essentially what he showed
[02:15:21.920 --> 02:15:26.920]   was if you look at societal risk plus personal risk
[02:15:26.920 --> 02:15:29.760]   and you combine those two, you know what drug
[02:15:29.760 --> 02:15:32.440]   is the most dangerous drug in the world?
[02:15:32.440 --> 02:15:33.680]   - I'm gonna guess it's alcohol.
[02:15:33.680 --> 02:15:37.080]   - It's alcohol, right behind heroin and cocaine
[02:15:37.080 --> 02:15:38.600]   and duh, duh, duh, duh, duh and somewhere in the middle
[02:15:38.600 --> 02:15:41.480]   is marijuana and right on the tail end on the other,
[02:15:41.480 --> 02:15:45.880]   on the exact other end of this, psilocybin.
[02:15:45.880 --> 02:15:49.740]   - Is caffeine, it usually doesn't make the list.
[02:15:49.740 --> 02:15:52.140]   - I may have been on the list, if it was,
[02:15:52.140 --> 02:15:54.000]   it was probably pretty close to psilocybin,
[02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:56.020]   but somewhere in the middle was ketamine,
[02:15:56.020 --> 02:15:58.860]   somewhere in the middle was amphetamine,
[02:15:58.860 --> 02:16:01.180]   somewhere in the, you know, a little closer to psilocybin,
[02:16:01.180 --> 02:16:06.040]   I think it was MDMA, you know, but it's this combined
[02:16:06.040 --> 02:16:09.960]   personal, you know, kind of world risk of these things
[02:16:09.960 --> 02:16:13.720]   and so alcohol makes it because there's a huge amount
[02:16:13.720 --> 02:16:16.960]   of personal risk and there's a huge amount of societal risk,
[02:16:16.960 --> 02:16:19.600]   right, drunk drivers kill X amount of kids,
[02:16:19.600 --> 02:16:20.880]   you know, people in the world.
[02:16:20.880 --> 02:16:22.680]   - Fight sexual assault.
[02:16:22.680 --> 02:16:23.800]   - All that. - All that.
[02:16:23.800 --> 02:16:27.080]   - Yeah and then all the cancer and all that stuff
[02:16:27.080 --> 02:16:29.760]   and so it beats out cocaine, it beats out heroin,
[02:16:29.760 --> 02:16:34.760]   it beats out all of these things and yet we don't,
[02:16:34.960 --> 02:16:37.420]   we don't as a culture, for whatever reason,
[02:16:37.420 --> 02:16:41.400]   we don't as a culture see it as a drug
[02:16:41.400 --> 02:16:44.600]   and that's the part that really baffles me, you know?
[02:16:44.600 --> 02:16:45.780]   - I mean, they serve it, I mean,
[02:16:45.780 --> 02:16:48.240]   this is no knock on Stanford at all,
[02:16:48.240 --> 02:16:49.200]   of course I wouldn't do that,
[02:16:49.200 --> 02:16:50.920]   this is at every institution I've been to,
[02:16:50.920 --> 02:16:54.160]   they serve alcohol at the graduate student events.
[02:16:54.160 --> 02:16:55.440]   - That's right.
[02:16:55.440 --> 02:16:58.600]   - They serve alcohol, they do a happy hour.
[02:16:58.600 --> 02:17:01.660]   I've never been a drinker, I can take it or leave it, so,
[02:17:01.660 --> 02:17:05.020]   and I realized that some people, they really enjoy alcohol,
[02:17:05.020 --> 02:17:06.860]   you know, my former partner, I mean,
[02:17:06.860 --> 02:17:08.660]   she just was in that, you know,
[02:17:08.660 --> 02:17:11.120]   10% or so of people who have a glass of wine
[02:17:11.120 --> 02:17:14.060]   and just feel great and the second one feel great,
[02:17:14.060 --> 02:17:17.020]   I just want to take a nap after I have a bit of alcohol,
[02:17:17.020 --> 02:17:19.460]   so it never does much for me, I always feel poisoned,
[02:17:19.460 --> 02:17:23.420]   I feel lucky in that sense, but it's unbelievable
[02:17:23.420 --> 02:17:26.320]   that it is so prevalent and it's just,
[02:17:26.320 --> 02:17:29.460]   it's baked into the medical, even medical institutions,
[02:17:29.460 --> 02:17:31.940]   they'll pop a bottle of champagne to celebrate the opening
[02:17:31.940 --> 02:17:34.300]   of a hospital. - That's right, that's right.
[02:17:34.300 --> 02:17:35.340]   - It's pretty crazy.
[02:17:35.340 --> 02:17:36.860]   - Yeah, no, you're absolutely right, you know,
[02:17:36.860 --> 02:17:40.760]   I think what's gonna happen, but this is me, you know,
[02:17:40.760 --> 02:17:42.180]   looking at the crystal ball a little bit,
[02:17:42.180 --> 02:17:43.820]   but I think what's gonna happen
[02:17:43.820 --> 02:17:45.420]   is what happened with doctors and smoking,
[02:17:45.420 --> 02:17:47.020]   so if you look at the '50s and '60s, right,
[02:17:47.020 --> 02:17:49.780]   there are all these pictures of doctors smoking cigarettes,
[02:17:49.780 --> 02:17:51.980]   you know, with patients, there's, you know,
[02:17:51.980 --> 02:17:54.340]   psychiatrists doing psychotherapy and smoking a cigarette
[02:17:54.340 --> 02:17:56.140]   with the patients sitting on the couch, you know,
[02:17:56.140 --> 02:17:58.860]   surgeons smoking a cigarette in between cases,
[02:17:58.860 --> 02:18:00.500]   there are all these pictures of that, right,
[02:18:00.500 --> 02:18:02.700]   and now all of a sudden smoking's totally banned,
[02:18:02.700 --> 02:18:05.920]   I think it's totally banned from most of Stanford campus.
[02:18:05.920 --> 02:18:09.120]   My suspicion is, as you're suggesting, right,
[02:18:09.120 --> 02:18:11.940]   you know, this is everywhere and it's all kind of ubiquitous,
[02:18:11.940 --> 02:18:14.580]   it's some critical point, some tipping point,
[02:18:14.580 --> 02:18:19.260]   everybody's gonna realize that just like with smoking,
[02:18:19.260 --> 02:18:22.940]   we've got a rid, hospital systems and universities
[02:18:22.940 --> 02:18:27.820]   of alcohol, and at some point in 50 years,
[02:18:27.820 --> 02:18:31.420]   it's my view that we'll look back at these scenarios
[02:18:31.420 --> 02:18:34.820]   that you're talking about and be like, you know what,
[02:18:34.820 --> 02:18:38.540]   we were foolish about this, we can't believe
[02:18:38.540 --> 02:18:41.380]   that we gave people alcohol on the way, you know,
[02:18:41.380 --> 02:18:43.540]   when they graduated from whatever, you know,
[02:18:43.540 --> 02:18:45.780]   and I think we'll have a different take on it,
[02:18:45.780 --> 02:18:47.780]   but it's gonna take a longer time.
[02:18:47.780 --> 02:18:50.820]   I think people did a really good job
[02:18:50.820 --> 02:18:52.400]   tying smoking to lung cancer,
[02:18:52.400 --> 02:18:54.940]   and it's like a very simplistic story,
[02:18:54.940 --> 02:18:57.860]   smoking, lung cancer, you know.
[02:18:57.860 --> 02:19:01.340]   Now, as you know, alcohol increases the risk
[02:19:01.340 --> 02:19:04.460]   of a lot of different cancers, not so clear which one,
[02:19:04.460 --> 02:19:06.180]   I mean, there's like, you know, the kind of oral,
[02:19:06.180 --> 02:19:07.580]   like the throat, tongue cancer,
[02:19:07.580 --> 02:19:08.780]   that's one of-- - Breast cancer.
[02:19:08.780 --> 02:19:12.220]   - Yeah, breast cancer, you know, and so it's kind of,
[02:19:12.220 --> 02:19:14.580]   it's a harder story to tell, you know,
[02:19:14.580 --> 02:19:17.620]   and I think that's why, and everybody, you know,
[02:19:17.620 --> 02:19:19.100]   and then there's this whole, it's, you know,
[02:19:19.100 --> 02:19:22.060]   my mom says this, it's like, I drank my glass of wine
[02:19:22.060 --> 02:19:24.980]   because my doctor told me it was heart healthy,
[02:19:24.980 --> 02:19:26.980]   and we were talking about this, and I try to,
[02:19:26.980 --> 02:19:30.340]   no, no, no, but Dr. So-and-so said it's heart healthy,
[02:19:30.340 --> 02:19:32.820]   and so it ends up being this thing where, like,
[02:19:32.820 --> 02:19:34.780]   she's drinking alcohol because she thinks
[02:19:34.780 --> 02:19:37.340]   that it's good for her heart,
[02:19:37.340 --> 02:19:39.460]   and, you know, and it's hard,
[02:19:39.460 --> 02:19:40.940]   I've had those conversations with her,
[02:19:40.940 --> 02:19:44.500]   it's hard to untie that, and I think that, yeah,
[02:19:44.500 --> 02:19:48.340]   at some point, we're gonna hit some threshold moment,
[02:19:48.340 --> 02:19:50.460]   and it'll be interesting if we really look at the data
[02:19:50.460 --> 02:19:52.420]   and we really look at what's safe and not safe
[02:19:52.420 --> 02:19:54.980]   from purely from this analysis,
[02:19:54.980 --> 02:19:58.340]   it kind of, it kind of points to the right direction.
[02:19:58.340 --> 02:19:59.940]   - That's really interesting, and also saying nothing
[02:19:59.940 --> 02:20:02.900]   of poor judgment under the influence of alcohol.
[02:20:02.900 --> 02:20:06.460]   I mean, I would venture that if we were to remove alcohol
[02:20:06.460 --> 02:20:09.140]   from university campuses, watch the students
[02:20:09.140 --> 02:20:10.660]   are gonna lobby against me if I say this,
[02:20:10.660 --> 02:20:14.140]   but if you were to remove alcohol from campuses,
[02:20:14.140 --> 02:20:16.100]   I mean, just think about the,
[02:20:16.100 --> 02:20:18.100]   what I suspect would be the improvement
[02:20:18.100 --> 02:20:23.100]   in good decision-making and that would occur,
[02:20:23.100 --> 02:20:26.340]   or, you know, I've got stories from graduate school
[02:20:26.340 --> 02:20:30.300]   and it was very different, you know, 10 years ago,
[02:20:30.300 --> 02:20:32.360]   there was a lot more alcohol consumption,
[02:20:32.360 --> 02:20:33.420]   again, that was never my thing,
[02:20:33.420 --> 02:20:36.180]   but I know people who made really bad decisions.
[02:20:36.180 --> 02:20:40.060]   In any case, there's a whole landscape there emerging,
[02:20:40.060 --> 02:20:42.580]   I think you've got your finger right on the pulse of it.
[02:20:42.580 --> 02:20:44.940]   I want to touch on something slightly different
[02:20:44.940 --> 02:20:45.900]   than what we've been talking about,
[02:20:45.900 --> 02:20:47.620]   but definitely related to depression,
[02:20:47.620 --> 02:20:49.420]   and this is, again, is one of these intriguing
[02:20:49.420 --> 02:20:53.380]   but perplexing things, which is that sleep deprivation
[02:20:53.380 --> 02:20:56.980]   can improve symptoms of depression,
[02:20:56.980 --> 02:21:00.080]   and yet I'm personally very familiar with the fact
[02:21:00.080 --> 02:21:02.380]   that if I don't sleep well for one night,
[02:21:02.380 --> 02:21:04.180]   or don't sleep at all, in fact,
[02:21:04.180 --> 02:21:06.640]   I do have an ability to function pretty well the next day,
[02:21:06.640 --> 02:21:08.500]   I'll do this non-sleep deep rest practice
[02:21:08.500 --> 02:21:10.860]   that I blab a lot about on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:21:10.860 --> 02:21:12.720]   which for me is tremendously restorative,
[02:21:12.720 --> 02:21:15.020]   but I like a good night's sleep,
[02:21:15.020 --> 02:21:18.140]   I think everybody understands now,
[02:21:18.140 --> 02:21:20.400]   thanks to the great work of Matthew Walker and others,
[02:21:20.400 --> 02:21:22.500]   they've really gotten out into the world saying,
[02:21:22.500 --> 02:21:25.580]   "Look, the foundation of mental health, physical health,
[02:21:25.580 --> 02:21:27.860]   and high performance, if that's your thing,
[02:21:27.860 --> 02:21:28.980]   being a functional human being,
[02:21:28.980 --> 02:21:32.620]   is to try and get enough quality deep sleep
[02:21:32.620 --> 02:21:35.980]   at least 80% of the nights of your life, if you can."
[02:21:35.980 --> 02:21:38.640]   That's something to focus on, just like good nutrition,
[02:21:38.640 --> 02:21:42.100]   just like exercise and social connection, et cetera.
[02:21:42.100 --> 02:21:45.240]   So sleep deprivation we know can in particular,
[02:21:45.240 --> 02:21:48.340]   I think rapid eye movement components of sleep deprivation
[02:21:48.340 --> 02:21:51.020]   can improve the symptoms of depression,
[02:21:51.020 --> 02:21:54.140]   and yet being sleep deprived
[02:21:54.140 --> 02:21:56.540]   can also really dysregulate our control
[02:21:56.540 --> 02:21:57.540]   of the autonomic system.
[02:21:57.540 --> 02:21:59.700]   I notice on night two or night three of poor sleep,
[02:21:59.700 --> 02:22:02.560]   if I'm going through a stressful phase and that's happening,
[02:22:02.560 --> 02:22:05.380]   all of a sudden my heart rate is chronically elevated,
[02:22:05.380 --> 02:22:07.460]   my thought patterns become really disrupted,
[02:22:07.460 --> 02:22:11.260]   I can't then exercise, my decision-making is thrown off,
[02:22:11.260 --> 02:22:12.700]   my emotionality is more labeled,
[02:22:12.700 --> 02:22:14.980]   the hinge as we were referring to it earlier,
[02:22:14.980 --> 02:22:18.180]   feels less in control, under my control,
[02:22:18.180 --> 02:22:21.360]   and maybe I wonder sometimes if I enter that state
[02:22:21.360 --> 02:22:22.240]   that you referred to earlier,
[02:22:22.240 --> 02:22:24.300]   where the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
[02:22:24.300 --> 02:22:25.960]   is no longer leading the cingulate,
[02:22:25.960 --> 02:22:27.660]   but the cingulate is now in charge,
[02:22:27.660 --> 02:22:30.180]   the players are in charge of the coach.
[02:22:30.180 --> 02:22:31.700]   Not a good situation.
[02:22:31.700 --> 02:22:34.460]   So I know you've done some work on sleep deprivation
[02:22:34.460 --> 02:22:38.120]   and light and effects, please tell us about that,
[02:22:38.120 --> 02:22:40.900]   and please tell us about this triple therapy.
[02:22:40.900 --> 02:22:44.220]   - Yeah, yeah, so friend of mine, Greg Salem,
[02:22:44.220 --> 02:22:46.860]   another one of the professors at Stanford,
[02:22:46.860 --> 02:22:49.180]   is very interested in sleep.
[02:22:49.180 --> 02:22:51.980]   He did a bunch of training in sleep
[02:22:51.980 --> 02:22:53.300]   before he went to medical school
[02:22:53.300 --> 02:22:57.100]   and got very interested in this idea that,
[02:22:57.100 --> 02:23:01.740]   as you're saying, if you sleep deprive somebody one night
[02:23:01.740 --> 02:23:04.100]   in just kind of an isolated single night,
[02:23:04.100 --> 02:23:06.220]   at the end of that sleep deprivation
[02:23:06.220 --> 02:23:07.980]   they will have an antidepressant effect,
[02:23:07.980 --> 02:23:10.480]   but as soon as they fall asleep, they lose it.
[02:23:10.480 --> 02:23:13.060]   So if it's a depressed individual,
[02:23:13.060 --> 02:23:16.200]   you can get them to be less depressed acutely.
[02:23:16.200 --> 02:23:19.040]   Soon as they fall asleep, they wake up eight hours later,
[02:23:19.040 --> 02:23:22.420]   then they come back into the same level of depression.
[02:23:22.420 --> 02:23:24.740]   And so the idea was that you needed to do
[02:23:24.740 --> 02:23:26.580]   some sort of circadian reset,
[02:23:26.580 --> 02:23:29.460]   and part of what depression is
[02:23:29.460 --> 02:23:32.140]   is that it's a dysregulated circadian system.
[02:23:32.140 --> 02:23:33.960]   And so mentors of mine say,
[02:23:33.960 --> 02:23:35.820]   if you can just get the sleep better,
[02:23:35.820 --> 02:23:37.820]   that's half the battle of dealing with depression,
[02:23:37.820 --> 02:23:41.080]   'cause so many people have insomnia around depression
[02:23:41.080 --> 02:23:43.400]   and have a whole host of types of insomnia,
[02:23:43.400 --> 02:23:45.600]   having a hard time falling asleep,
[02:23:45.600 --> 02:23:47.680]   waking up in the middle of the night and waking up earlier,
[02:23:47.680 --> 02:23:50.180]   all symptoms of depression.
[02:23:50.180 --> 02:23:55.160]   And so what this does is it sleep deprives the individual
[02:23:55.160 --> 02:23:57.100]   and then there's a certain calculation
[02:23:57.100 --> 02:23:59.460]   of shifting their phase
[02:23:59.460 --> 02:24:02.680]   and simultaneously exposing them to bright light.
[02:24:02.680 --> 02:24:05.080]   So that's the triple, the phase shift,
[02:24:05.080 --> 02:24:07.280]   the sleep deprivation and the bright light
[02:24:07.280 --> 02:24:10.660]   to try to get their circadian rhythm.
[02:24:10.660 --> 02:24:14.080]   Essentially, the theory is re-entrained.
[02:24:14.080 --> 02:24:19.080]   And so in the trials that we've done and other trials
[02:24:19.080 --> 02:24:22.400]   prior to ours and after,
[02:24:22.400 --> 02:24:24.640]   it looked like there was a pretty profound
[02:24:24.640 --> 02:24:29.120]   antidepressant effect from this triple therapy
[02:24:29.120 --> 02:24:30.460]   that seemed to be durable,
[02:24:30.460 --> 02:24:33.800]   meaning durability is this term we use to say
[02:24:33.800 --> 02:24:36.280]   that not only can you get kind of point relief,
[02:24:36.280 --> 02:24:39.440]   but that the relief ends up lasting.
[02:24:39.440 --> 02:24:41.680]   What's important to know about this is like,
[02:24:41.680 --> 02:24:44.000]   you shouldn't do this at home for sure.
[02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:45.840]   This is what you would need to do this with a professional
[02:24:45.840 --> 02:24:48.560]   'cause it's complicated, it's not just one thing.
[02:24:48.560 --> 02:24:51.240]   And in sleep deprivation,
[02:24:51.240 --> 02:24:54.900]   while it seems to be antidepressant, it's pro-anxiety.
[02:24:54.900 --> 02:24:56.960]   So if you take a highly anxious person that's not depressed
[02:24:56.960 --> 02:24:59.920]   and you sleep deprive them, they get profoundly anxious.
[02:24:59.920 --> 02:25:01.120]   And so that's the other thing
[02:25:01.120 --> 02:25:04.000]   that you have to really realize is that this is,
[02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:06.040]   like everything else that I've talked about today,
[02:25:06.040 --> 02:25:09.560]   all things that you have to do under medical supervision,
[02:25:09.560 --> 02:25:11.240]   but curious, right?
[02:25:11.240 --> 02:25:14.280]   And I think the question that always comes up
[02:25:14.280 --> 02:25:16.240]   is why isn't this used more?
[02:25:16.240 --> 02:25:19.260]   And I think the reason is that there's not really
[02:25:19.260 --> 02:25:21.480]   a mechanism for,
[02:25:21.480 --> 02:25:23.920]   ultimately in medicine, as sad as it is,
[02:25:23.920 --> 02:25:26.060]   you have to have a code to do a thing.
[02:25:26.060 --> 02:25:29.040]   There has to be a code associated with a treatment
[02:25:29.040 --> 02:25:32.040]   and it's hard to figure out how to make a code for this.
[02:25:32.040 --> 02:25:33.680]   And so I think that's part of it.
[02:25:33.680 --> 02:25:36.560]   And so if there's a way,
[02:25:36.560 --> 02:25:39.580]   and somebody's gotta kinda take that baton on that,
[02:25:39.580 --> 02:25:41.900]   but if there's a way to make a code for this,
[02:25:41.900 --> 02:25:45.960]   I think you could actually turn it into something
[02:25:45.960 --> 02:25:48.360]   that was more widely utilized.
[02:25:48.360 --> 02:25:53.360]   And we probably dream up ways of how to integrate AI,
[02:25:53.360 --> 02:25:57.640]   passive sensing, all that stuff to really make that work.
[02:25:57.640 --> 02:26:00.320]   But I think that would be the idea,
[02:26:00.320 --> 02:26:02.480]   that would be the trajectory I'd see, so yeah.
[02:26:02.480 --> 02:26:07.040]   - Yeah, having a billable to insurance code is fundamental.
[02:26:07.040 --> 02:26:09.760]   And a lot of listeners to this podcast, I think,
[02:26:09.760 --> 02:26:11.580]   have a background in engineering science.
[02:26:11.580 --> 02:26:14.040]   And we will put a link to that manuscript
[02:26:14.040 --> 02:26:15.180]   that talks about the triple therapy,
[02:26:15.180 --> 02:26:16.440]   because here we're talking about
[02:26:16.440 --> 02:26:17.620]   one night sleep deprivation,
[02:26:17.620 --> 02:26:20.280]   some timed light exposure to the eyes,
[02:26:20.280 --> 02:26:22.380]   and then shifting in the circadian clock,
[02:26:22.380 --> 02:26:24.880]   things central to the themes of this podcast
[02:26:24.880 --> 02:26:26.440]   that come up often.
[02:26:26.440 --> 02:26:28.320]   I think for the typical person,
[02:26:28.320 --> 02:26:32.720]   can we say that trying to get a regular light-dark cycle
[02:26:32.720 --> 02:26:34.160]   and sleep rhythm would be beneficial
[02:26:34.160 --> 02:26:36.000]   for overall mood regulation?
[02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:38.680]   - Yeah, I think for the typical person,
[02:26:38.680 --> 02:26:42.680]   really kind of re-regulating your sleep
[02:26:42.680 --> 02:26:45.000]   and trying to get a good night's sleep
[02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:48.060]   in which you fall asleep, stay asleep, wake up,
[02:26:48.060 --> 02:26:52.260]   and a set time every morning is gonna be pretty crucial.
[02:26:52.260 --> 02:26:56.380]   In mild depression, I think that one has
[02:26:56.380 --> 02:26:57.600]   a lot of control over that.
[02:26:57.600 --> 02:26:58.600]   As we were talking about earlier,
[02:26:58.600 --> 02:27:00.680]   I think when you hit some threshold in depression
[02:27:00.680 --> 02:27:02.520]   where things become kind of semi-volitional,
[02:27:02.520 --> 02:27:06.120]   it's harder to kind of will yourself into that.
[02:27:06.120 --> 02:27:07.540]   There are therapies like,
[02:27:07.540 --> 02:27:11.160]   there's a CBT for insomnia, for instance,
[02:27:11.160 --> 02:27:12.840]   where you can do cognitive behavioral therapy
[02:27:12.840 --> 02:27:14.440]   to help with insomnia.
[02:27:14.440 --> 02:27:17.200]   Sometimes people, and I'm no sleep expert,
[02:27:17.200 --> 02:27:19.920]   that I'd kind of pass this to Greg to fully talk about this,
[02:27:19.920 --> 02:27:24.280]   but some of what goes on that people
[02:27:24.280 --> 02:27:26.960]   with kind of milder insomnia experience
[02:27:26.960 --> 02:27:29.340]   is like blue light out of their computer
[02:27:29.340 --> 02:27:30.840]   and things like that that they,
[02:27:30.840 --> 02:27:33.680]   so you can use like blue light blockers to,
[02:27:33.680 --> 02:27:36.240]   it tricks your brain, as you know better than me,
[02:27:36.240 --> 02:27:38.900]   it tricks your brain to think that it's still light outside
[02:27:38.900 --> 02:27:41.560]   and so people will, they'll have insomnia
[02:27:41.560 --> 02:27:44.520]   because their brain still thinks that it's light outside
[02:27:44.520 --> 02:27:49.520]   and then people will kind of strip CBT for sleep.
[02:27:49.520 --> 02:27:54.840]   Therapists will say there are only two things
[02:27:54.840 --> 02:27:56.520]   that you should do in your bed
[02:27:56.520 --> 02:27:59.640]   and if you're under a certain age and whatnot,
[02:27:59.640 --> 02:28:01.800]   it's really one thing that you should do in your bed,
[02:28:01.800 --> 02:28:05.800]   which is to sleep and be with your partner, right?
[02:28:05.800 --> 02:28:10.000]   And so those are kind of the two things
[02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:11.080]   that you should do in a bedroom
[02:28:11.080 --> 02:28:12.440]   and that's really the only things
[02:28:12.440 --> 02:28:13.380]   that you should do in a bedroom
[02:28:13.380 --> 02:28:14.920]   if you're having sleep problems.
[02:28:14.920 --> 02:28:16.240]   You shouldn't watch TV in a bedroom,
[02:28:16.240 --> 02:28:17.160]   you shouldn't eat in a bedroom,
[02:28:17.160 --> 02:28:18.280]   you shouldn't hang out.
[02:28:18.280 --> 02:28:19.300]   - Keep the phone out of the bedroom.
[02:28:19.300 --> 02:28:21.080]   - Keep the phone out of the bedroom, yeah.
[02:28:21.080 --> 02:28:24.700]   - Yeah, we should get Greg Salem on the podcast.
[02:28:24.700 --> 02:28:25.540]   I'll just mention for people
[02:28:25.540 --> 02:28:26.580]   that want to regulate their sleep,
[02:28:26.580 --> 02:28:29.640]   we have a sleep toolkit that's available
[02:28:29.640 --> 02:28:31.860]   as a downloadable PDF at hubermanlab.com.
[02:28:31.860 --> 02:28:33.380]   Just go to the menu and a lot of the things
[02:28:33.380 --> 02:28:35.500]   in that toolkit are based on work
[02:28:35.500 --> 02:28:37.060]   from Stanford sleep laboratories,
[02:28:37.060 --> 02:28:39.720]   including Jamie Zeitzers and others lab,
[02:28:39.720 --> 02:28:41.640]   not aimed at depression specifically.
[02:28:41.640 --> 02:28:48.140]   Listen, Nolan, Dr. Williams,
[02:28:48.140 --> 02:28:50.780]   this has been an amazing voyage
[02:28:50.780 --> 02:28:53.620]   through the circuitry of autonomic control.
[02:28:53.620 --> 02:28:55.460]   This landscape of the prefrontal cortex
[02:28:55.460 --> 02:28:58.620]   is I find incredibly fascinating
[02:28:58.620 --> 02:29:01.020]   and I just want to start off by saying,
[02:29:01.020 --> 02:29:02.700]   please do come back again
[02:29:02.700 --> 02:29:06.860]   and teach us more about that and your TMS work.
[02:29:06.860 --> 02:29:08.760]   Before we wrap, however,
[02:29:08.760 --> 02:29:10.460]   I do want to give you the opportunity
[02:29:10.460 --> 02:29:12.620]   to talk about the SAINT study.
[02:29:12.620 --> 02:29:14.320]   Is it SAINT or saints plural?
[02:29:14.320 --> 02:29:15.500]   - Yeah, it's SAINT.
[02:29:15.500 --> 02:29:19.760]   So SAINT or what we're calling it S-N-T now,
[02:29:19.760 --> 02:29:22.520]   SAINT has, you know, the intent was not
[02:29:22.520 --> 02:29:24.760]   to kind of connect it to religion,
[02:29:24.760 --> 02:29:28.320]   but we may have accidentally done so
[02:29:28.320 --> 02:29:33.000]   and so we abbreviated it to S-N-T for the subsequent trials,
[02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:35.820]   which was initially Stanford accelerated
[02:29:35.820 --> 02:29:37.760]   intelligent neuromodulation therapy
[02:29:37.760 --> 02:29:39.980]   or now what we're calling Stanford neuromodulation therapy,
[02:29:39.980 --> 02:29:43.760]   but the idea there, which is a cool idea,
[02:29:43.760 --> 02:29:48.760]   is that TMS is a device that delivers a treatment
[02:29:48.760 --> 02:29:54.520]   and the treatment is the protocol
[02:29:54.520 --> 02:29:59.180]   and the protocol is the stimulation parameter set
[02:29:59.180 --> 02:30:03.220]   in a specific brain region for a specific condition.
[02:30:03.220 --> 02:30:05.540]   And so what's cool about neuromodulation,
[02:30:05.540 --> 02:30:08.180]   whether it be transcranial magnetic stimulation
[02:30:08.180 --> 02:30:09.940]   or transcranial direct current stimulation
[02:30:09.940 --> 02:30:11.100]   or deep brain stimulation,
[02:30:11.100 --> 02:30:13.620]   like what Casey Halpern talked about, you know,
[02:30:13.620 --> 02:30:18.620]   on another podcast is this idea that in all of those cases,
[02:30:18.620 --> 02:30:23.180]   the device itself is a physical layer conduit
[02:30:23.180 --> 02:30:26.860]   of a stimulation protocol that's therapeutic
[02:30:26.860 --> 02:30:29.420]   for a given condition in a given brain region.
[02:30:29.420 --> 02:30:31.060]   And so in the case of depression,
[02:30:31.060 --> 02:30:33.440]   which we know the most about with TMS,
[02:30:33.440 --> 02:30:35.980]   we've been doing TMS studies for depression
[02:30:35.980 --> 02:30:39.180]   for, you know, since 1995, right,
[02:30:39.180 --> 02:30:43.340]   in the clearance in 2008, 2009.
[02:30:43.340 --> 02:30:47.200]   And in that timeframe, we were able to go
[02:30:47.200 --> 02:30:50.340]   from really knowing very little at all
[02:30:50.340 --> 02:30:51.900]   about how to do something like this
[02:30:51.900 --> 02:30:53.740]   to getting an FDA clearance.
[02:30:53.740 --> 02:30:56.740]   And the way that it went down was that
[02:30:56.740 --> 02:31:01.540]   there were two groups studying different components at NIH.
[02:31:01.540 --> 02:31:05.520]   The first group was studying mood neuroanatomy
[02:31:05.520 --> 02:31:08.180]   on functional imaging that was kind of the first generation
[02:31:08.180 --> 02:31:09.460]   of functional imaging back then.
[02:31:09.460 --> 02:31:13.940]   So PET scans, which are kind of metabolic scans
[02:31:13.940 --> 02:31:16.340]   and then SPECT scans.
[02:31:16.340 --> 02:31:18.620]   And the idea there was looking at activity
[02:31:18.620 --> 02:31:21.020]   and metabolism in prefrontal cortex.
[02:31:21.020 --> 02:31:24.220]   And what they found in these kind of more crude scans
[02:31:24.220 --> 02:31:28.300]   is a just general hypo activity, hypometabolism.
[02:31:28.300 --> 02:31:31.200]   The other group right upstairs at the National Institute
[02:31:31.200 --> 02:31:34.660]   for Neurological Diseases and Stroke, NINDS,
[02:31:34.660 --> 02:31:36.780]   they were looking at using TMS,
[02:31:36.780 --> 02:31:38.180]   which had been around for 10 years
[02:31:38.180 --> 02:31:41.860]   and repetitively stimulating in motor cortex.
[02:31:41.860 --> 02:31:45.020]   What they found was, gosh, we can get a readout
[02:31:45.020 --> 02:31:49.200]   in thumb muscle movement amplitude
[02:31:49.200 --> 02:31:51.500]   that's really reproducible across people.
[02:31:51.500 --> 02:31:54.780]   It's like universally reproducible.
[02:31:54.780 --> 02:31:57.480]   And if we do certain stimulation approaches,
[02:31:57.480 --> 02:31:59.100]   they are biologically active
[02:31:59.100 --> 02:32:02.740]   to either increase excitability, i.e. the thumb motion
[02:32:02.740 --> 02:32:05.140]   and a set intensity goes up,
[02:32:05.140 --> 02:32:06.820]   the amount of amplitude goes up,
[02:32:06.820 --> 02:32:09.900]   or inhibitory depotentiating goes down
[02:32:09.900 --> 02:32:12.480]   with other biological stimulation approaches.
[02:32:12.480 --> 02:32:14.540]   Then a third outcome, which is important,
[02:32:14.540 --> 02:32:16.140]   that it's inert, it doesn't do either.
[02:32:16.140 --> 02:32:19.640]   So you can have stimulation approaches that do one,
[02:32:19.640 --> 02:32:24.260]   increase activity, decrease activity, or are inert.
[02:32:24.260 --> 02:32:25.760]   And so what they found was,
[02:32:25.760 --> 02:32:28.000]   oh, we can excite certain brain regions.
[02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:31.480]   And my mentor, Mark George, had this kind of aha moment
[02:32:31.480 --> 02:32:34.840]   where he said, wow, there's underactivity
[02:32:34.840 --> 02:32:37.440]   in prefrontal cortex in depression,
[02:32:37.440 --> 02:32:39.920]   and we can increase activity using this thing
[02:32:39.920 --> 02:32:41.980]   that we know that we can increase activity in motor cortex.
[02:32:41.980 --> 02:32:43.160]   We just need to put it
[02:32:43.160 --> 02:32:45.800]   in the left-or-salateral prefrontal cortex.
[02:32:45.800 --> 02:32:48.680]   And then they combined the two
[02:32:48.680 --> 02:32:51.140]   and started stimulating once a day
[02:32:51.140 --> 02:32:53.560]   in this kind of very abbreviated fashion.
[02:32:53.560 --> 02:32:57.460]   And lo and behold, some of those depression patients
[02:32:57.460 --> 02:32:58.540]   resolved their depression.
[02:32:58.540 --> 02:33:00.380]   And back then, and still today,
[02:33:00.380 --> 02:33:02.140]   you can go and as a psychiatric patient,
[02:33:02.140 --> 02:33:04.640]   stay at the National Institute of Mental Health
[02:33:04.640 --> 02:33:07.280]   and go through clinical trials to try to get treated.
[02:33:07.280 --> 02:33:09.540]   And there were patients who'd been there for months
[02:33:09.540 --> 02:33:11.360]   and they were able to be discharged
[02:33:11.360 --> 02:33:12.320]   because their mood was better. - Incredible.
[02:33:12.320 --> 02:33:13.160]   - Yeah.
[02:33:13.160 --> 02:33:15.520]   And so it was just this very crude approach
[02:33:15.520 --> 02:33:17.200]   where they were using ruler measurements
[02:33:17.200 --> 02:33:20.520]   of where DLPFC was, and they were stimulating with devices
[02:33:20.520 --> 02:33:23.920]   that you needed to physically dunk the coil in an ice bath.
[02:33:23.920 --> 02:33:25.960]   And with that, they still were able to,
[02:33:25.960 --> 02:33:27.800]   the kind of genius of this, Mark and others,
[02:33:27.800 --> 02:33:30.780]   they'll still be able to create
[02:33:30.780 --> 02:33:34.980]   a purely engineered stimulation approach.
[02:33:34.980 --> 02:33:39.040]   What's cool about that is that they kind of
[02:33:39.040 --> 02:33:40.200]   found two things, right?
[02:33:40.200 --> 02:33:42.320]   They found this one stimulation protocol
[02:33:42.320 --> 02:33:44.040]   that does have some antidepressant effect.
[02:33:44.040 --> 02:33:46.240]   It's limited, it doesn't treat everybody.
[02:33:46.240 --> 02:33:48.180]   It does have some antidepressant effect.
[02:33:48.180 --> 02:33:52.200]   And this bigger concept that a neuromodulation device
[02:33:52.200 --> 02:33:56.600]   is kind of like a pharmaceutical company for you, right?
[02:33:56.600 --> 02:33:59.840]   That in a given individual, a TMS device
[02:33:59.840 --> 02:34:03.600]   or whatever neuromodulation device is able to generate,
[02:34:03.600 --> 02:34:06.240]   you can create a stimulation approach
[02:34:06.240 --> 02:34:09.620]   that is specific to a given condition
[02:34:09.620 --> 02:34:11.880]   and specific to an individual.
[02:34:11.880 --> 02:34:16.020]   And so the physical layer is just how you exert that.
[02:34:16.020 --> 02:34:18.760]   Similarly to how we make pharmaceutical drugs
[02:34:18.760 --> 02:34:20.280]   in a pharmaceutical company,
[02:34:20.280 --> 02:34:22.840]   but the actual therapy itself is what you do,
[02:34:22.840 --> 02:34:24.280]   where you do it.
[02:34:24.280 --> 02:34:28.920]   And so what we learned from another 20, 30 years of this
[02:34:28.920 --> 02:34:32.640]   is that you can modify the stimulation protocol
[02:34:32.640 --> 02:34:35.640]   in such a way where you can create a whole new treatment
[02:34:35.640 --> 02:34:37.920]   and put it through the same TMS device,
[02:34:37.920 --> 02:34:40.820]   or thank God, an evolved version of it
[02:34:40.820 --> 02:34:42.460]   where you don't have to dunk it in ice baths
[02:34:42.460 --> 02:34:44.660]   and they can actually really handle
[02:34:44.660 --> 02:34:47.540]   much more aggressive stimulation approaches.
[02:34:47.540 --> 02:34:51.440]   And so in 2005, a group published a neuron,
[02:34:51.440 --> 02:34:55.080]   a paper demonstrating that if you stimulate
[02:34:55.080 --> 02:34:59.460]   with the hippocampal rhythms through a TMS coil,
[02:34:59.460 --> 02:35:03.680]   you can excite the brain with memory rhythms
[02:35:03.680 --> 02:35:05.800]   and it'll last an hour.
[02:35:05.800 --> 02:35:07.580]   So you can change cortical excitability
[02:35:07.580 --> 02:35:11.160]   in this thumb twitch for an hour, sending three minutes
[02:35:11.160 --> 02:35:13.660]   of excitatory or 40 seconds in the case
[02:35:13.660 --> 02:35:17.140]   of inhibitory stimulation that mimics the hippocampal rhythms.
[02:35:17.140 --> 02:35:20.980]   So much more efficient than the original TMS approaches.
[02:35:20.980 --> 02:35:23.900]   And so after that, a group tried to do it
[02:35:23.900 --> 02:35:26.040]   in this kind of six-week schedule.
[02:35:26.040 --> 02:35:29.140]   And after that, and while they were doing that,
[02:35:29.140 --> 02:35:31.940]   we decided, gosh, this problem I talked about
[02:35:31.940 --> 02:35:35.040]   at the beginning of the show where you have this problem
[02:35:35.040 --> 02:35:37.600]   that we don't have a treatment for people
[02:35:37.600 --> 02:35:42.020]   who are in these high acuity psychiatric emergency states,
[02:35:42.020 --> 02:35:44.980]   this idea that we're gonna engineer a treatment
[02:35:44.980 --> 02:35:49.100]   where we can reorganize the stimulation approach in time
[02:35:49.100 --> 02:35:52.520]   to be much more efficient by utilizing something
[02:35:52.520 --> 02:35:54.000]   called space learning theory.
[02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:56.040]   And so you probably know about the space learning theory.
[02:35:56.040 --> 02:36:00.360]   So the idea for the viewers is it's a simple psychological
[02:36:00.360 --> 02:36:02.480]   thing, but we've also seen it in hippocampal slice
[02:36:02.480 --> 02:36:07.480]   sort of physiology too where if I'm cramming for a test,
[02:36:07.480 --> 02:36:11.560]   what I do is I write out 60 note cards
[02:36:11.560 --> 02:36:13.620]   and I read each one for a minute until I get
[02:36:13.620 --> 02:36:14.940]   to the first note card and again,
[02:36:14.940 --> 02:36:16.880]   and that's about an hour later, right?
[02:36:16.880 --> 02:36:18.980]   And we just intuitively do this.
[02:36:18.980 --> 02:36:22.620]   We all automatically do that.
[02:36:22.620 --> 02:36:26.420]   And we intuit that because we know that what doesn't work
[02:36:26.420 --> 02:36:28.480]   is writing out one note card and looking at it
[02:36:28.480 --> 02:36:29.420]   over and over again.
[02:36:29.420 --> 02:36:31.500]   Nobody ever does that, right?
[02:36:31.500 --> 02:36:33.980]   We've all been in graduate school, medical school,
[02:36:33.980 --> 02:36:36.060]   and we have these big stacks of note cards.
[02:36:36.060 --> 02:36:37.300]   That's space learning theory.
[02:36:37.300 --> 02:36:39.620]   It's this idea that you need to see it about every hour
[02:36:39.620 --> 02:36:42.440]   to an hour and a half and that optimizes learning.
[02:36:42.440 --> 02:36:45.780]   If you take the same stimulation approach
[02:36:45.780 --> 02:36:47.500]   that I'm talking about, this theta burst stimulation
[02:36:47.500 --> 02:36:50.400]   approach and you take a hippocampal slice of a mouse
[02:36:50.400 --> 02:36:55.360]   and you stimulate, you enlarge some dendritic spines
[02:36:55.360 --> 02:36:57.060]   and you prime some.
[02:36:57.060 --> 02:36:59.360]   And then if you stimulate right after that,
[02:36:59.360 --> 02:37:00.340]   you don't get any change.
[02:37:00.340 --> 02:37:01.740]   It's called in mass stimulation.
[02:37:01.740 --> 02:37:04.860]   But if you wait about an hour to an hour and a half,
[02:37:04.860 --> 02:37:08.380]   you get more dendritic spines enlarged and more primed,
[02:37:08.380 --> 02:37:10.320]   which by the way also is what ketamine does.
[02:37:10.320 --> 02:37:13.840]   It causes this dendritic spine enlargement.
[02:37:13.840 --> 02:37:18.300]   And so what we found was is that the old way of doing TMS,
[02:37:18.300 --> 02:37:20.900]   this idea of just doing it once a day, every day,
[02:37:20.900 --> 02:37:23.060]   five days a week for six weeks,
[02:37:23.060 --> 02:37:24.980]   didn't utilize the space learning theory.
[02:37:24.980 --> 02:37:28.340]   It's like studying for a month or two,
[02:37:28.340 --> 02:37:29.740]   just a little bit once a day.
[02:37:29.740 --> 02:37:31.260]   Like you remember some of that stuff,
[02:37:31.260 --> 02:37:33.180]   but it's like not as potent as that week
[02:37:33.180 --> 02:37:35.060]   where you're kind of cramming, right?
[02:37:35.060 --> 02:37:38.260]   And what we realized is that if we could reorganize
[02:37:38.260 --> 02:37:40.440]   the stimulation in times that we took the whole
[02:37:40.440 --> 02:37:42.240]   six week course, we actually figured out a way
[02:37:42.240 --> 02:37:43.500]   to do it in a day.
[02:37:43.500 --> 02:37:46.500]   And then what we also figured out is that people
[02:37:46.500 --> 02:37:49.500]   were underdosing TMS because if you just keep going
[02:37:49.500 --> 02:37:52.740]   after six weeks out to month three, four, five,
[02:37:52.740 --> 02:37:53.980]   more and more people got better.
[02:37:53.980 --> 02:37:55.780]   So we figured out it's not just one day,
[02:37:55.780 --> 02:37:57.460]   we're gonna get five times the normal dose.
[02:37:57.460 --> 02:38:00.260]   We have seven and a half months worth in five days
[02:38:00.260 --> 02:38:02.440]   using space learning theory.
[02:38:02.440 --> 02:38:03.640]   - So every hour?
[02:38:03.640 --> 02:38:05.140]   - Every hour for 10 hours.
[02:38:05.140 --> 02:38:05.980]   - For five days?
[02:38:05.980 --> 02:38:06.820]   - For five days.
[02:38:06.820 --> 02:38:07.860]   So it's a 50 hour block.
[02:38:07.860 --> 02:38:10.680]   It's 90 minutes of actual stimulation,
[02:38:10.680 --> 02:38:13.740]   but spread out through the day in the same way of learning,
[02:38:13.740 --> 02:38:16.100]   which is perfect for an inpatient psychiatric unit, right?
[02:38:16.100 --> 02:38:17.340]   - Five days is manageable.
[02:38:17.340 --> 02:38:18.900]   - Yeah, then you can get stimulation.
[02:38:18.900 --> 02:38:21.320]   Nobody's ever dropped out by the schedule.
[02:38:21.320 --> 02:38:25.460]   Folks that wanna do this wanna do it.
[02:38:25.460 --> 02:38:27.300]   So they'll do their nine minutes, they'll go get breakfast,
[02:38:27.300 --> 02:38:28.460]   they'll do their nine minutes,
[02:38:28.460 --> 02:38:31.120]   they'll go see their therapist or whatever it is.
[02:38:31.120 --> 02:38:34.380]   And so what we've found with this reorganization
[02:38:34.380 --> 02:38:38.020]   and time of the stimulation, dose,
[02:38:38.020 --> 02:38:40.460]   and then the third component is we do resting state
[02:38:40.460 --> 02:38:42.580]   functional connectivity scans on everybody.
[02:38:42.580 --> 02:38:45.260]   And we have ways now in the last five to 10 years
[02:38:45.260 --> 02:38:50.260]   of picking out that specific subgenual DLPFC subcircuit
[02:38:50.260 --> 02:38:52.780]   that I was talking about earlier, that cingulate DLPFC.
[02:38:52.780 --> 02:38:54.220]   We can pick that out in every single one.
[02:38:54.220 --> 02:38:55.200]   If you wanna come to the lab,
[02:38:55.200 --> 02:38:57.900]   we can find your DLPFC subgenual.
[02:38:57.900 --> 02:38:58.960]   It's even more robust and non-depressed.
[02:38:58.960 --> 02:39:00.940]   - And we can stimulate too just while we're in there.
[02:39:00.940 --> 02:39:01.780]   - Yeah, if you want to,
[02:39:01.780 --> 02:39:03.720]   we can move around your hypnotizability.
[02:39:03.720 --> 02:39:09.820]   And we can find that spot in each person.
[02:39:09.820 --> 02:39:11.740]   Instead of finding the same spot on the skull,
[02:39:11.740 --> 02:39:14.340]   we find the same spot on the brain and we can stimulate.
[02:39:14.340 --> 02:39:15.580]   We do that every hour on the hour.
[02:39:15.580 --> 02:39:20.460]   What we've found is that folks will,
[02:39:20.460 --> 02:39:24.520]   within one to five days, in more cases than not,
[02:39:24.520 --> 02:39:26.460]   depending upon if you're looking at this open label
[02:39:26.460 --> 02:39:30.460]   or in trials, somewhere between 60 and 90% of the time,
[02:39:30.460 --> 02:39:33.060]   they will go into full-on remission in the sense
[02:39:33.060 --> 02:39:36.260]   they're totally normal from a mood standpoint
[02:39:36.260 --> 02:39:37.400]   at the end of this.
[02:39:37.400 --> 02:39:41.020]   And like I said, with variable durability.
[02:39:41.020 --> 02:39:42.460]   So that's the part we have to figure out now
[02:39:42.460 --> 02:39:44.260]   about dosing and how to keep people well.
[02:39:44.260 --> 02:39:47.300]   But for some people, we've had four years of remission,
[02:39:47.300 --> 02:39:48.700]   a year of remission.
[02:39:48.700 --> 02:39:51.640]   And it's really that cramming of the test.
[02:39:51.640 --> 02:39:55.460]   It's really that idea that you're laying in that information
[02:39:55.460 --> 02:39:57.460]   in the exact right spot.
[02:39:57.460 --> 02:39:59.360]   And the signal is a simple signal,
[02:39:59.360 --> 02:40:04.140]   but it's a profound one, which is turn on, stay on,
[02:40:04.140 --> 02:40:05.880]   remember to stay on.
[02:40:05.880 --> 02:40:09.020]   You know, that idea that you're sending this memory signal
[02:40:09.020 --> 02:40:10.780]   into the brain and you're doing it in such a way
[02:40:10.780 --> 02:40:12.660]   that you're telling the system,
[02:40:12.660 --> 02:40:15.180]   you're kind of taking it out of the hippocampus,
[02:40:15.180 --> 02:40:17.340]   your own hippocampus's hand is you're sending
[02:40:17.340 --> 02:40:20.340]   the same signal the hippocampus normally signals out.
[02:40:20.340 --> 02:40:24.160]   Now you're sending that signal into the prefrontal cortex
[02:40:24.160 --> 02:40:28.960]   and kind of utilizing the brain's own communication style
[02:40:28.960 --> 02:40:31.360]   to get it to get out of the state.
[02:40:31.360 --> 02:40:35.440]   And what's very cool about this is that people,
[02:40:35.440 --> 02:40:38.000]   when they kind of exit out of that,
[02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:43.720]   they end up saying they don't have any side effects from it
[02:40:43.720 --> 02:40:46.080]   and they feel back to normal.
[02:40:46.080 --> 02:40:47.880]   Like some people, you know, not everybody,
[02:40:47.880 --> 02:40:50.500]   but there's a subsection of people with SSRIs
[02:40:50.500 --> 02:40:52.700]   where they'll say, I kind of feel numb
[02:40:52.700 --> 02:40:54.740]   or I have GI side effects or I can't,
[02:40:54.740 --> 02:40:56.740]   I can't, you know, I don't have the sexual interest
[02:40:56.740 --> 02:40:58.940]   that I used to have and that sort of thing.
[02:40:58.940 --> 02:41:01.660]   You know, not anything gets SSRIs, as I said earlier,
[02:41:01.660 --> 02:41:03.740]   life saving, you know, for a subsection of people,
[02:41:03.740 --> 02:41:05.220]   these things really work.
[02:41:05.220 --> 02:41:08.640]   But with this, what you see is that people don't talk
[02:41:08.640 --> 02:41:09.940]   about any of that stuff.
[02:41:09.940 --> 02:41:13.500]   And I think it's likely because you're tapping
[02:41:13.500 --> 02:41:15.860]   into that core circuitry and you're reversing it
[02:41:15.860 --> 02:41:18.040]   and you're doing it with a magnet
[02:41:18.040 --> 02:41:21.360]   that because it's a very profound electromagnet,
[02:41:21.360 --> 02:41:23.980]   it's the same field strength as an MRI scanner,
[02:41:23.980 --> 02:41:26.900]   it's able to induce a current in the brain
[02:41:26.900 --> 02:41:29.620]   in this focal targeted way
[02:41:29.620 --> 02:41:31.100]   without getting into the rest of the brain,
[02:41:31.100 --> 02:41:32.860]   without getting into the rest of the body at all,
[02:41:32.860 --> 02:41:34.940]   and just really kind of acting only
[02:41:34.940 --> 02:41:37.460]   on that circuitry that's involved.
[02:41:37.460 --> 02:41:38.440]   - Incredible.
[02:41:38.440 --> 02:41:40.460]   Is the SAINT study still ongoing?
[02:41:40.460 --> 02:41:44.260]   And if people are interested in potentially being patients
[02:41:45.460 --> 02:41:49.000]   or subjects in the study, can we provide them a portal link?
[02:41:49.000 --> 02:41:49.840]   - Absolutely, yeah.
[02:41:49.840 --> 02:41:53.480]   So we have, now the treatment,
[02:41:53.480 --> 02:41:55.060]   some of my students went over to a company
[02:41:55.060 --> 02:41:57.800]   called Magnus Medical and they've been working on this.
[02:41:57.800 --> 02:41:59.820]   They've gotten FDA clearance now.
[02:41:59.820 --> 02:42:04.820]   And now folks can get it through trials
[02:42:04.820 --> 02:42:06.360]   over the next couple of years,
[02:42:06.360 --> 02:42:08.620]   because it's going to take some time for that company
[02:42:08.620 --> 02:42:13.180]   to kind of get up and running and get a device
[02:42:13.180 --> 02:42:15.660]   and get the whole thing set up nationally.
[02:42:15.660 --> 02:42:18.020]   But while that's all going on,
[02:42:18.020 --> 02:42:19.940]   there's still about a thousand patients
[02:42:19.940 --> 02:42:20.900]   that need to be recruited
[02:42:20.900 --> 02:42:23.660]   across a bunch of different trials all over the country.
[02:42:23.660 --> 02:42:25.520]   We'll take people from anywhere in the country.
[02:42:25.520 --> 02:42:28.540]   We also have partners in New York and San Diego
[02:42:28.540 --> 02:42:32.720]   and in soon to be South Carolina and other places
[02:42:32.720 --> 02:42:34.540]   where we can actually kind of,
[02:42:34.540 --> 02:42:38.180]   my lab can help to kind of let people know where to go
[02:42:38.180 --> 02:42:40.340]   based off of where they're at in the US
[02:42:40.340 --> 02:42:42.620]   and get them access to being able to be in a trial
[02:42:42.620 --> 02:42:44.620]   and what we've tried to do is make it
[02:42:44.620 --> 02:42:47.780]   so that even if you get the 50/50 chance
[02:42:47.780 --> 02:42:48.980]   you're going to get the real deal
[02:42:48.980 --> 02:42:51.500]   or you're going to get the non-real deal,
[02:42:51.500 --> 02:42:53.940]   but what we have figured out is a way
[02:42:53.940 --> 02:42:56.660]   to let everyone have access.
[02:42:56.660 --> 02:43:00.060]   If they got the not real deal version,
[02:43:00.060 --> 02:43:02.300]   the kind of sham version or the fake version
[02:43:02.300 --> 02:43:04.300]   for the first part of the trial,
[02:43:04.300 --> 02:43:06.660]   there are other trials where they can have access
[02:43:06.660 --> 02:43:07.560]   to the real version.
[02:43:07.560 --> 02:43:11.200]   So essentially everybody eventually gets access
[02:43:11.200 --> 02:43:12.880]   to having the real version
[02:43:12.880 --> 02:43:14.740]   and so that's been a big thing for me
[02:43:14.740 --> 02:43:17.800]   is I want everybody that comes through one of our trials
[02:43:17.800 --> 02:43:19.020]   to be able to have access.
[02:43:19.020 --> 02:43:22.760]   I think it's important while the company's doing
[02:43:22.760 --> 02:43:24.340]   what they're doing and what the lab's doing
[02:43:24.340 --> 02:43:28.240]   and kind of nationally what other partner labs are doing.
[02:43:28.240 --> 02:43:30.640]   - Well, I can assure you you're going to get some interest.
[02:43:30.640 --> 02:43:31.920]   - Happy to have it, yeah.
[02:43:31.920 --> 02:43:36.920]   - Thank you and listen, thank you so much
[02:43:36.920 --> 02:43:40.080]   for taking us on this incredible voyage
[02:43:40.080 --> 02:43:43.600]   through the neurocircuitry underlying certain aspects
[02:43:43.600 --> 02:43:45.620]   of depression, the coverage of the different types
[02:43:45.620 --> 02:43:48.540]   of depression, the various therapeutic compounds,
[02:43:48.540 --> 02:43:49.380]   how they work.
[02:43:49.380 --> 02:43:51.100]   We've talked about a lot of things today
[02:43:51.100 --> 02:43:53.060]   and you've shared so much knowledge
[02:43:53.060 --> 02:43:56.600]   and even as I say that, I very much want to have you back
[02:43:56.600 --> 02:43:58.620]   to talk about many other things as well
[02:43:58.620 --> 02:43:59.820]   that we didn't have time to cover,
[02:43:59.820 --> 02:44:01.900]   but also just really want to thank you
[02:44:01.900 --> 02:44:03.560]   for the work that you do.
[02:44:03.560 --> 02:44:04.560]   I know we are colleagues,
[02:44:04.560 --> 02:44:07.340]   but you run an enormous laboratory.
[02:44:07.340 --> 02:44:10.740]   Enormous in my book, 40 people is a big group,
[02:44:10.740 --> 02:44:11.580]   very big group.
[02:44:11.580 --> 02:44:12.880]   Plus you're in the clinic.
[02:44:12.880 --> 02:44:16.420]   You also have a life of your own outside of work
[02:44:16.420 --> 02:44:18.240]   and to take the time to sit down with us
[02:44:18.240 --> 02:44:20.920]   and share all this knowledge that really is in service
[02:44:20.920 --> 02:44:25.300]   to mental health and human feeling better
[02:44:25.300 --> 02:44:28.100]   and in fact, avoiding often suicidal depression.
[02:44:28.100 --> 02:44:30.900]   It's just incredible work and an incredible generosity
[02:44:30.900 --> 02:44:32.620]   and just thank you so much.
[02:44:32.620 --> 02:44:34.460]   - Well, thank you, man.
[02:44:34.460 --> 02:44:36.900]   Similarly, I want to thank you for what you're doing.
[02:44:36.900 --> 02:44:40.300]   I mean, I think that I've got a lot of friends,
[02:44:40.300 --> 02:44:42.260]   folks that are not in the medical profession,
[02:44:42.260 --> 02:44:44.420]   friends of mine, one of my buddies
[02:44:44.420 --> 02:44:47.060]   who's a real estate agent who works with us,
[02:44:47.060 --> 02:44:48.680]   who's a big fan of your show
[02:44:48.680 --> 02:44:51.740]   and I told a couple people like that I was coming on
[02:44:51.740 --> 02:44:54.900]   and they were like super stoked.
[02:44:54.900 --> 02:44:57.660]   They're like, we watch every show
[02:44:57.660 --> 02:45:01.980]   and super excited to watch mine
[02:45:01.980 --> 02:45:03.740]   and they said something very important to me
[02:45:03.740 --> 02:45:08.740]   that you make this complicated neuroscience
[02:45:08.740 --> 02:45:12.820]   and kind of brain body science accessible
[02:45:12.820 --> 02:45:17.240]   in a way that few have a gift to do
[02:45:17.240 --> 02:45:19.900]   and I think that that's so important
[02:45:19.900 --> 02:45:24.700]   and this show is doing so much to help with science literacy
[02:45:24.700 --> 02:45:27.620]   and yeah, appreciate you.
[02:45:27.620 --> 02:45:28.740]   - Well, thank you.
[02:45:28.740 --> 02:45:31.580]   I'm gratified and honored by your statement
[02:45:31.580 --> 02:45:34.380]   and I look forward to more, thank you.
[02:45:34.380 --> 02:45:35.700]   - Absolutely, thank you.
[02:45:35.700 --> 02:45:36.740]   - Thank you for joining me today
[02:45:36.740 --> 02:45:39.060]   for my discussion with Dr. Nolan Williams.
[02:45:39.060 --> 02:45:41.180]   I hope you found our discussion about psychedelics
[02:45:41.180 --> 02:45:42.540]   and other compounds,
[02:45:42.540 --> 02:45:45.400]   about transcranial magnetic stimulation
[02:45:45.400 --> 02:45:48.040]   and about the treatments for depression in general
[02:45:48.040 --> 02:45:50.260]   to be as stimulating as I did.
[02:45:50.260 --> 02:45:51.980]   If you'd like to learn more about the work being done
[02:45:51.980 --> 02:45:53.780]   in Dr. Williams laboratory,
[02:45:53.780 --> 02:45:56.320]   you can go to the brain stimulation laboratory website,
[02:45:56.320 --> 02:45:59.620]   which is bsl.stanford.edu
[02:45:59.620 --> 02:46:01.660]   and there you have the opportunity to apply
[02:46:01.660 --> 02:46:04.140]   to be in one of the clinical trials for depression
[02:46:04.140 --> 02:46:06.420]   or other studies as well if you like
[02:46:06.420 --> 02:46:09.280]   to support the work being done in Dr. Williams laboratory
[02:46:09.280 --> 02:46:10.400]   for the treatment of depression
[02:46:10.400 --> 02:46:12.220]   and other psychiatric disorders.
[02:46:12.220 --> 02:46:13.600]   If you're learning from and are enjoying
[02:46:13.600 --> 02:46:15.020]   the Huberman Lab Podcast,

[02:46:39.700 --> 02:46:41.340]   at the beginning of today's episode.
[02:46:41.340 --> 02:46:44.220]   That's the best way to support the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[02:46:44.220 --> 02:46:46.380]   Not so much today, but in many previous episodes
[02:46:46.380 --> 02:46:48.780]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we talk about supplements.
[02:46:48.780 --> 02:46:50.980]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[02:46:50.980 --> 02:46:52.980]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[02:46:52.980 --> 02:46:54.980]   for things like enhancing sleep and focus
[02:46:54.980 --> 02:46:56.660]   and hormone optimization.
[02:46:56.660 --> 02:46:58.100]   The Huberman Lab Podcast has partnered
[02:46:58.100 --> 02:46:59.300]   with Momentous Supplements.
[02:46:59.300 --> 02:47:00.380]   If you'd like to see the supplements
[02:47:00.380 --> 02:47:01.860]   that the Huberman Lab Podcast has partnered
[02:47:01.860 --> 02:47:04.340]   with Momentous on, you can go to Live Momentous,
[02:47:04.340 --> 02:47:07.780]   spelled O-U-S, so livemomentous.com/huberman.
[02:47:07.780 --> 02:47:09.740]   And there you'll see a number of the supplements
[02:47:09.740 --> 02:47:11.700]   that we talk about regularly on the podcast.
[02:47:11.700 --> 02:47:13.640]   I should just mention that that catalog of supplements
[02:47:13.640 --> 02:47:15.240]   is constantly being updated.
[02:47:15.240 --> 02:47:17.060]   As mentioned at the beginning of today's episode,
[02:47:17.060 --> 02:47:20.100]   the Huberman Lab Podcast has now launched a premium channel.
[02:47:20.100 --> 02:47:22.660]   That premium channel will feature monthly AMAs
[02:47:22.660 --> 02:47:25.540]   or ask me anythings where I answer your questions in depth,
[02:47:25.540 --> 02:47:27.500]   as well as other premium resources.
[02:47:27.500 --> 02:47:29.340]   If you'd like to subscribe to the premium channel,
[02:47:29.340 --> 02:47:32.940]   you can simply go to HubermanLab.com/premium.
[02:47:32.940 --> 02:47:35.520]   I should mention that the proceeds from the premium channel
[02:47:35.520 --> 02:47:37.740]   go to support the standard Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:47:37.740 --> 02:47:41.040]   which will continue to be released every Monday per usual,
[02:47:41.040 --> 02:47:44.220]   as well as supporting various research projects done
[02:47:44.220 --> 02:47:46.900]   on humans to create the sorts of tools for mental health,
[02:47:46.900 --> 02:47:49.100]   physical health, and performance that you hear about
[02:47:49.100 --> 02:47:50.420]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[02:47:50.420 --> 02:47:53.540]   Again, it's HubermanLab.com/premium to subscribe.
[02:47:53.540 --> 02:47:56.620]   It's $10 a month or $100 per year.
[02:47:56.620 --> 02:47:57.820]   If you haven't already subscribed
[02:47:57.820 --> 02:47:59.500]   to our zero cost newsletter,
[02:47:59.500 --> 02:48:02.120]   we have what is called the Neural Network Newsletter.
[02:48:02.120 --> 02:48:04.560]   You can subscribe by going to HubermanLab.com,
[02:48:04.560 --> 02:48:06.400]   go to the menu and click on newsletter.
[02:48:06.400 --> 02:48:09.140]   Those newsletters include summaries of podcast episodes,
[02:48:09.140 --> 02:48:11.700]   lists of tools from the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[02:48:11.700 --> 02:48:13.920]   And if you'd like to see previous newsletters
[02:48:13.920 --> 02:48:16.180]   that we've released, you can also just go to HubermanLab.com,
[02:48:16.180 --> 02:48:17.540]   click on newsletter in the menu,
[02:48:17.540 --> 02:48:19.780]   and you'll see various downloadable PDFs.
[02:48:19.780 --> 02:48:21.460]   If you want to sign up for the newsletter,
[02:48:21.460 --> 02:48:22.580]   we just ask for your email.
[02:48:22.580 --> 02:48:24.500]   We do not share your email with anybody.
[02:48:24.500 --> 02:48:26.760]   And again, it's completely zero cost.
[02:48:26.760 --> 02:48:28.740]   If you're not already following me on social media,
[02:48:28.740 --> 02:48:32.220]   it's Huberman Lab on Twitter, on Facebook, and on Instagram.
[02:48:32.220 --> 02:48:33.960]   And at all three of those places,
[02:48:33.960 --> 02:48:36.420]   I cover topics and subject matter
[02:48:36.420 --> 02:48:38.820]   that are sometimes overlapping with the information
[02:48:38.820 --> 02:48:40.260]   covered on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:48:40.260 --> 02:48:42.300]   but that's often distinct from information
[02:48:42.300 --> 02:48:43.720]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[02:48:43.720 --> 02:48:46.600]   Again, it's Huberman Lab on all social media channels.
[02:48:46.600 --> 02:48:48.700]   And last, but certainly not least,
[02:48:48.700 --> 02:48:50.460]   thank you for your interest in science.
[02:48:50.460 --> 02:48:53.040]   [upbeat music]
[02:48:53.040 --> 02:48:55.640]   (upbeat music)
