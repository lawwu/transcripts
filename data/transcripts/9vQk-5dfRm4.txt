[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.400]   Well, we are approaching Halloween.
[00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.360]   It will be here on Sunday.
[00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:14.160]   And for many, it's a day about ghosts and ghouls and goblins and pumpkins and candy.
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.840]   But for some of us, the day serves as an annual reminder of the Protestant Reformation.
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:25.240]   Reformation Day reminds us how Paul's epistle to the Romans ignited a fire in Martin Luther's
[00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:30.600]   soul, a fire so bold that he stood against an entire religious system that wanted to
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.480]   shut him up and shut him down.
[00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.480]   It didn't.
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.480]   It couldn't.
[00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.320]   Luther gave his life to preach the gospel of justification before a holy God through
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.200]   the vicarious substitution of Jesus Christ.
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.920]   This reformer epitomizes lion-hearted boldness.
[00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.160]   So where does such boldness come from?
[00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.000]   And why are sinners so fearful?
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.160]   As we move towards Reformation Day, this is a great clip from a 1993 John Piper sermon,
[00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:07.560]   a sermon on Proverbs 28.1 of all places, which reads this, "The wicked flee when no one pursues,
[00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.320]   but the righteous are bold as a lion."
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:18.040]   It begins with Pastor John mentioning Proverbs 14.16 and talking about the guilty conscience.
[00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.040]   Here he is.
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:25.920]   "The fool rages and is bold."
[00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:32.620]   And the word "bold," "be bold," is the same word as verse 1 of chapter 28, "The righteous
[00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.320]   are bold as a lion."
[00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.400]   So fools can be bold and the righteous can be bold.
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.880]   Which causes me to think, like with so many Proverbs, you find this, that what is being
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:52.840]   said here in this verse is that in general there's something about wickedness that kindles
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:02:00.960]   fear and there's something about righteousness that kindles boldness, but it's not so absolute
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.960]   that there isn't a kind of boldness that the wicked can have and there isn't a kind of
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.620]   timidity that now and then the righteous can have.
[00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:12.960]   And we all know that from experience and we know it from the Bible, that there is a reckless
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:20.120]   boldness that the wicked have, especially in the pursuit of their wickedness.
[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:29.100]   Dirty needles, promiscuous sex, speeding, reckless crime.
[00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:35.700]   It takes a lot of stupid boldness to do what many wicked do.
[00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.520]   They are not cowardly often in the pursuit of sin.
[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:48.580]   They take manifold risks with their lives and their freedom and their eternity.
[00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.520]   So there is a kind of boldness that the wicked have.
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.680]   It's just not the kind that's being talked about in verse 1.
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.580]   The kind of boldness that's being talked about here is the boldness that's required in the
[00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.760]   atmosphere of justice.
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:09.400]   And there's something about wickedness that in the atmosphere of justice flees even when
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.240]   there's no one pursuing.
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:21.320]   There's something about the righteous that is bold as a lion for the cause of justice.
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:29.240]   What is it about the wicked that makes them flee when no one is pursuing?
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.960]   I think you know the answer to that.
[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.440]   We can find it from the Bible.
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:34.880]   We can find it in our experience.
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:42.520]   The answer is a bad conscience, a guilty conscience, an evil conscience makes a person flee when
[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.960]   no one is pursuing.
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:54.880]   When you see a police car, is your first response gratitude that there are law keepers?
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:03.640]   When you played basketball or did play basketball or soccer or football, did the way you play
[00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:09.480]   affect the response you felt every time the whistle blew?
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:16.280]   When you're in a conversation, do you begin to defend yourself even before there's been
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:22.640]   any accusation or anything clearly said against what you think?
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:27.120]   Fleeing because you can hear an accuser where there may even be none?
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:33.120]   We flee when we're not being pursued because we have a bad conscience.
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:39.240]   There are a lot of things stored up in our lives, bad things that we have done that we
[00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:47.600]   have not made right and a voice inside is telling us that someone is after us even when
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.400]   they are not.
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:58.400]   Guilt is the parent of fear and our conscience is very creative.
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:07.720]   Conscience creates pursuers where there ought to be some and are not any.
[00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:17.760]   The breeze turns into a burglar, the shadows turn into ghosts, police turn into adversaries,
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:26.560]   parents turn into police, God turns into an enemy when they are not.
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:32.200]   Verse 8 says, "And the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.800]   among the trees of the garden."
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:34.800]   He wasn't pursuing.
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:39.000]   He didn't have a gun.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.580]   And he said, "Where are you?"
[00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:49.280]   And Adam said, "I heard the sound of you in the garden and I was afraid."
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.480]   And we've been afraid ever since.
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:56.360]   We've been afraid of him ever since.
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:05.960]   A guilty conscience will turn shadows into phantoms and ambulances into police cars and
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:14.920]   innocent inquiries into indictments and doorbells into threats and mailmen into warrant officers
[00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:24.600]   and school teachers into wardens and parents into cross-examiners and friends into traitors
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:29.960]   and simple office memos into termination papers.
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:39.880]   The conscience is almost infinitely creative and the wicked flee where there is no one
[00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:45.320]   pursuing but there ought to be.
[00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:52.480]   The conscience makes up for what isn't by creating out of nothing the pursuers we need
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:07:00.520]   to have to bring us to justice and repentance and reconciliation, forgiveness with people
[00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:03.600]   we've wronged.
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:12.840]   A guilty conscience creates pursuers where there are none unless you drown it with alcohol
[00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:24.960]   or numb it with drugs or blast it with constant loud music and constant escapes from solitude
[00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:28.280]   or endless denials.
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:29.280]   It isn't there.
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:30.280]   It isn't conscience.
[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:31.280]   It doesn't count.
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:32.280]   It's not important.
[00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:40.360]   I can live without talking to them until you go so far in hardening yourself against this
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:49.820]   God-given voice that it ceases and you can no more hear the steps of God in the garden
[00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:52.880]   and that is a dreadful place to be.
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:53.880]   Potent.
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:57.400]   Okay I'm going to fast forward in the sermon to get from the conscience section to Martin
[00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:58.400]   Luther.
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:59.400]   Here we go.
[00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:05.120]   "The righteous ones are the people who trust in the Lord and not in themselves and their
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:08.520]   own merit and their own deeds and their own righteousness.
[00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:15.560]   They trust in the Lord and His mercy and His steadfast kindness and then they are the ones
[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:21.840]   who according to verses 1 and 2 have their sins covered and their iniquities are not
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:23.640]   imputed to them.
[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:29.440]   They simply are not counted because they trust in the Lord.
[00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:34.280]   Now that's who the righteous are in the Old Testament, the New Testament and everywhere
[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:36.040]   in this universe.
[00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:42.200]   The righteous are people who trust in the Lord and bank on Jesus Christ for everything
[00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:50.120]   they have and need and they are as bold as a lion.
[00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:56.200]   If you can have that kind of boldness with God like Martin Luther had so that you know
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:04.360]   as you look the almighty, holy, infinitely wise and beautiful God in the face, you know
[00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:14.960]   He imputes no iniquity to you, you will be as lion-hearted as can be with men.
[00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:21.600]   Fear with men is rooted in the fear of not being right with God.
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:27.920]   If you knew God was standing at your right hand with infinite power, with His right hand
[00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:34.120]   on your shoulder, you'd be bold.
[00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:37.320]   You'd be bold as a lion.
[00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:40.640]   Now I want to take Martin Luther as an example of that.
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:45.000]   In 1521, the lion-heartedness came out.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   His whole life was one of incredible courage.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.900]   Let me close with one illustration of his boldness.
[00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:53.840]   It was the fall of 1521.
[00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:56.360]   It was in the city of Worms.
[00:09:56.360 --> 00:10:03.860]   Charles, the emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, biggest empire since Charlemagne, was there
[00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:06.280]   in the cathedral.
[00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:09.600]   Frederick the Wise, the local governor, was there.
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:16.600]   The bishop, the archbishop of Trier was there named Eck, and in a room this size, at least,
[00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:21.560]   it was filled with lords and nobles, every one of them against Martin Luther, and all
[00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:27.820]   of them having the capacity to sentence him to death for heresy and treason if he did
[00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:33.120]   not recant his criticisms of the Holy Catholic Church.
[00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:43.760]   Eck said, "Do you or do you not repudiate your books and the errors which they contain?"
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:48.660]   And first in German, and then they asked him to repeat it in Latin so that it could go
[00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:51.880]   down in the official register.
[00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:57.360]   He responded like this, "Since then, your majesty and your lordships desire a simple
[00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:02.320]   reply, I will answer without horns and without teeth.
[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:08.480]   Unless I am convicted by Scripture in plain reason, I do not accept the authority of popes
[00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:12.960]   and councils, for they have contradicted each other.
[00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:16.640]   My conscience is captive to the word of God.
[00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:23.960]   I cannot and I will not recant anything, for to go against conscience is neither right
[00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:25.960]   nor safe.
[00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:28.000]   Here I stand.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.360]   I cannot do otherwise.
[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:31.920]   God help me.
[00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:32.920]   Amen."
[00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:39.920]   The righteous are as bold as a lion.
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:45.600]   They are as bold as a lion because they are righteous in Christ.
[00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:51.880]   They look into the face of God and they see a smile which imputes to them no iniquity,
[00:11:51.880 --> 00:12:00.480]   but rather makes him who knew no sin to be sin, that they might become the righteousness
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:02.040]   of God.
[00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:07.760]   And standing clothed with the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus, they are as
[00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:12.920]   bold as a lion before God and before men.
[00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:20.120]   And my prayer for us in these days as a church is that God, by the gospel, by the gospel
[00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:26.880]   of the imputed righteousness of Jesus Christ through faith, might deliver us from fear
[00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:34.720]   of God and fear of men and make us valiant for the truth in this city.
[00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:35.720]   So good.
[00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:37.280]   So where do you find gospel boldness?
[00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:40.020]   You find it in the gospel itself.
[00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:44.240]   The boldness is the product of the gospel, of the cleansed conscience.
[00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:45.240]   Amazing.
[00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:49.160]   This clip was taken from John Piper's sermon preached on May 2nd, 1993, titled "The Righteous
[00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:52.880]   Are Bold as a Lion," a sermon on Proverbs 28.1.
[00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:56.200]   You can find the whole thing at DesiringGod.org.

[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:25.500]   Well on the morning after the crazy November 2020 election here in the States, several
[00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:31.120]   culture commentators observed that amid all the confusion over who won the presidency,
[00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:34.400]   there was no mistaking who won the night.
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:36.200]   Marijuana.
[00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:40.580]   Four additional states passed ballot measures to legalize adult-use pot for recreational
[00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:44.860]   use, and none of the votes were even close.
[00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:49.200]   As recreational use gains widespread support in red and blue states, it's raising new
[00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:51.240]   issues for pastors and parents in churches.
[00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:53.520]   We're going to look at those issues next time.
[00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:54.520]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:58.160]   We are rejoined in studio with Pastor John on Friday, and we'll see you then.
[00:13:58.160 --> 00:13:59.160]   [END]
[00:13:59.160 --> 00:13:59.160]   1
[00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:00.160]   Pastor John, I'm so glad you're here.
[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:01.160]   I'm so glad you're here.
[00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:02.160]   I'm so glad you're here.
[00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:03.160]   I'm so glad you're here.
[00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:04.160]   I'm so glad you're here.
