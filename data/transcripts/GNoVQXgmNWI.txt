[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680]   "Should little children sit through big church?" That was a question we addressed
[00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.960]   in episode 919, and it is now the second most listened to episode in the history
[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:14.760]   of our podcast, presently at over 300,000 plays. Amazing. It raised a number of
[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.480]   follow-up questions in the inbox, like this one from Ryan. "Pastor John, I'm a
[00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.240]   teaching elder at our church, and another pastor and my wife and myself have been
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.920]   wrestling with the idea of sermon content when children are present. We
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.320]   share the value of having children in church with their family, but we cringe
[00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.680]   at the thought of dealing with homosexuality or abortion or bestiality
[00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.880]   with children present. How should one striving to rightly divide the word
[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.120]   consider a child's innocence as they prepare and present a sermon? Should
[00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.160]   there be any deference shown to a family trying to be mindful of what those
[00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.160]   little ears hear, and would it be prudent to provide an alternative for families
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.960]   when those topics are covered? What would you do as a pastor?" My bottom line answer,
[00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.880]   and I'll give the bottom line, then I'll back up to why. My bottom line
[00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:07.680]   answer is that sometimes a church needs to hear a sermon that deals with such
[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:15.040]   graphic and explicit detail concerning a kind of human depravity that
[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:21.040]   arrangements should be made for the parents to be notified that such a
[00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:26.080]   sermon is coming so that they can decide whether they want their children present,
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:32.760]   and I think the leaders of the ministry to children probably will want
[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:38.240]   to discern whether special alternatives that morning should be made for the
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.740]   children or not. So that's my bottom line answer. Now let me explain the
[00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:51.600]   principle behind it. That's as important, more important. I've argued in another
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:58.800]   podcast why I prefer and think it's good to have little children, say from age 4,
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.800]   on in the worship service with the parents or some responsible adult,
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:09.480]   and so I'm not gonna argue for that here, just point people to those resources. So
[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:15.840]   that means I do expect children are going to be constantly hearing words and
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:23.120]   concepts and experiences they do not understand. I think that is good, good,
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:29.440]   good, good. I think that's what it means to be a child. The aim is that
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:36.240]   little by little parents are clarifying for the children what they've been
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:43.800]   hearing so that the children grow into things that were once above them. But
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:49.600]   things are more complicated than just whether a concept is hard to understand.
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:57.720]   The issue is also whether the issue is morally hurtful to the child. So here's
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:05.160]   here's an example. Take the sin of greed and the sin of homosexual practice. Both
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.600]   of them, the reason I choose them is because they're both listed together in
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:17.800]   1st Corinthians 6 as keeping a person out of the kingdom if they are pursued
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:23.640]   without repentance. So greed and homosexual practice have the same
[00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:30.360]   horrific outcome when they are embraced in a lifelong lifestyle. Now should a
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:37.400]   child hear an extended explanation of greed? And should a child hear an
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:43.600]   extended explanation of homosexual practice? And by child I mean something
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:52.440]   like five, six, seven years old. And my answer is that there is a way that an
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:59.360]   extended description of greed can be good for a child, but an extended
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:05.680]   description of homosexual practice can be bad for a child. And one of the
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:12.560]   differences is this. This child is already greedy and there is a child form
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.920]   of greed. The child can be shown by the pastor in his preaching or by the
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:24.880]   parents in application, can be shown this in a simple way by the parents that he's
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:30.640]   greedy, he's sinful, he wants more than he should have or things that would be
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:36.960]   hurtful to him to have. And he can be then be given gospel instructions for
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:44.280]   how he can begin to overcome his greed. But in the vast majority of children, I'm
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:52.720]   gonna say 98 plus percent, just the vast majority, there are no homosexual desires
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:05:02.360]   at that age that need stopping because the child is normally developing
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:07.600]   unselfconsciously into a typical heterosexual young person as it should
[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:14.560]   be. An extended and detailed explanation in a sermon of the evils of homosexual
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:21.440]   practice would require a child to be exposed at a very tender and formative
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:29.880]   age to possibilities of sexual experience he should not have to bear. He
[00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:34.360]   shouldn't have to carry the burden of even contemplating or going to bed at
[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:40.920]   night wondering, "What was that? Am I that? Should I consider that?" He shouldn't even
[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:47.000]   have to face those questions at five, six, seven, eight years old. I wish he
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.480]   didn't ever have to face them, but terribly difficult if a child is dropped
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:06:01.000]   into that cesspool at a very, very early age. But I don't think any five-year-old
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.560]   boy, for example, should ever pose the question to himself whether he will
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:11.400]   engage in or someday grow into homosexual activity. That is too heavy
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:17.840]   and can create uncertainties and worries that he should not have to deal with at
[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:23.320]   that age. God's design for him is not to face multiple choices of
[00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:28.880]   sexuality. Our culture thinks that's the way it should be because choice is
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:35.040]   God, but it's not God. Rather, he should grow naturally with God's help and
[00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:41.240]   parents' guidance into a heterosexual, godly young man. Hence, there's a
[00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:46.520]   difference between the vigilance we need to take over what children hear
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:53.800]   concerning sins as opposed to some other sins, even when both sins are deadly. Some
[00:06:53.800 --> 00:07:01.960]   are more destructive for a child to hear about than others. But I don't think this
[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:06.840]   means—this is an important, I think, qualification of what I just said—I
[00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:13.040]   don't think this means that in the normal course of preaching, a pastor must
[00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:20.640]   avoid all references to kinds of sins that might create problems for children.
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:26.640]   That would be too constraining on the normal course of preaching. But he can be
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:32.800]   aware that any extended treatment of those sins, rather than a general
[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:39.640]   reference to them, could wait for that other special sermon. And the reason I
[00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:45.040]   don't think he needs to avoid every reference is that for young children, it
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:51.720]   is possible for parents to give age-appropriate explanations of things
[00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:56.620]   like adultery. A little five-year-old doesn't have a clue what adultery is, and
[00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:59.800]   if you tried to explain it to him, it wouldn't make any sense. It would sound funny. Or
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:07.960]   fornication, or homosexual practice, or transgender issues, or abortion. Children
[00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:13.180]   are often satisfied by being told graciously by their parents, "Let's wait
[00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:16.920]   and talk about that when you're a little older, because you're gonna be able to
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:20.240]   understand that, and I'm gonna explain it to you." And they're happy to run outside
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:25.040]   and play after you say that. So the parents are able to decide and be
[00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:30.920]   discerning what level of exposure or awareness they think their children
[00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:38.040]   need. So I would suggest that pastors talk with the parents and the children's
[00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:42.240]   workers, and try to lay out an agreed-upon philosophy of parenting and
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:47.040]   education and preaching that would enable them to give appropriate
[00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:51.560]   protection and appropriate education to their children.
[00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:54.800]   Yeah, that's very good. Thank you, Pastor John. And once again, the episode that's
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:59.520]   over 300,000 plays now is titled, "Should Children Sit Through Big Church?" It's

[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.020]   millennia, for Jesus to incarnate into human history? Why the wait? What took so
[00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:27.320]   long? It's a great question, and it's on the table Monday. I'm your host, Tony
