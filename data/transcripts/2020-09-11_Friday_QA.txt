[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.800]   We begin with Zach. Zach, welcome to the show. How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:11.600]   Hi, Joshua. Thanks so much for taking my call. Before I get started in my question, I'll just give you a brief background on my situation.
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:18.500]   So I work as a project manager and for the last couple of years, I've been contracting through a contract firm.
[00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:26.000]   So I was laid off a couple of months ago, obviously due to the coronavirus, but luckily I was able to land a new position yesterday.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.600]   In the process of searching for jobs, I spoke to several recruiters,
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.200]   but one recruiter had brought up the option of receiving my income through my own LLC.
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:42.000]   So the way I see it, essentially my options would be to work as a W-2 employee.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:50.900]   So where I would get an hourly rate from the contract firm, I could get paid through the LLC.
[00:01:50.900 --> 00:02:01.000]   This option, so the LLC would be the employer who hires me would be paying me through that firm, that contract firm.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.300]   This option would pay, as I understand it, about three to ten dollars more an hour.
[00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:11.200]   This is an hourly rate. So and then the last option, which is something I've been wanting to do,
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.200]   but want to hear your thoughts on this, is to kind of cut out that middleman completely,
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.700]   set up my own LLC and maybe pay like a finder's fee to a recruiting company.
[00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:30.100]   So I'm just hoping you could discuss some of the pros and cons of these options and let me know what you think.
[00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:38.700]   It's a good question. The first thing to begin with that you have to start with is, are you a contractor or are you an employee?
[00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:46.700]   This is an area where the IRS has started to become much tighter in recent years and it's an area that's under dispute.
[00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:53.200]   I guess most famously when California recently passed new legislation affecting contractors
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:59.500]   and making it even harder to be a contractor in that state where you saw Uber and the various ride sharing services
[00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:08.400]   and affected by that where they're trying to classify the contractors as employees and that is leading to major problems.
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:16.700]   But the IRS regulations on the subject are fairly clear and if you'll begin with those regulations,
[00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.000]   then you'll get an idea of which path is best to go.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.700]   So if I just use these words without actually defining them,
[00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:34.500]   if I just simply use these words of employee and contractor, are you an employee or are you a contractor?
[00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.800]   So that's the thing. I could be a contractor. Whether I get paid through a W-2,
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:46.900]   I'm still contracting to the contract firm who sets me up with the employer that needs the work done.
[00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:54.600]   Okay. So in this situation, the company, the hiring company is going to hire a contract firm
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:03.600]   and either you will be an employee of that contract firm or the employing company will hire your own contracting firm.
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.200]   Do I understand that? I believe so.
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:12.100]   I think what you're saying that second part is they would be I would have my own LLC
[00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:18.900]   and then it's a little confusing but like that that the contract firm is kind of the middleman.
[00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:25.100]   So regardless if I'm paid through W-2 or paid through like a 1099 independent contractor,
[00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.300]   it would go through the contract firm. Okay.
[00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:37.700]   So in your situation, this may work out fine for you to be deciding this.
[00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:43.200]   But in my experience answering this question, much of the time when I'm asked this question,
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:49.500]   the answer is simple. You just simply go and ask what does the IRS say about whether you're a contractor
[00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:56.400]   or an employee and let's follow that. And I'm going to give you how the IRS defines that
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.200]   and then move on to answering your specific question.
[00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:08.700]   But the IRS uses three distinct categories to create a set of facts that will lean in one direction or another.
[00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:12.200]   And those three categories are behavioral control,
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:19.000]   financial control, and the relationship between the worker and the employing company.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.400]   Behavioral control. A worker is an employee when the business has the right to direct
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:31.300]   and control the work performed by the worker even if that right is not exercised.
[00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.700]   And that is probably the most significant one. By the way,
[00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:39.300]   why is this important? Because there are significant penalties for the hiring company
[00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:44.100]   if they misclassify somebody as a contractor who is actually an employee.
[00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:49.200]   And so the biggest danger is not for you as the worker, it's actually for the company.
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:55.000]   But if the company has the right to control the work performed by the worker,
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.300]   then you are an employee. Behavioral control categories are the type of instructions given,
[00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:06.500]   such as when and where to work, what tools to use, or where to purchase supplies and services.
[00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:12.400]   Receiving the types of instruction in these examples may indicate that a worker is an employee.
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:17.700]   Degree of instruction. More detailed instructions may indicate that the worker is an employee.
[00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:21.400]   Less detailed instructions indicate less control,
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:25.600]   indicating that the worker is more likely to be an independent contractor.
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:30.500]   Evaluation systems to measure the details of how the work is done points to an employee.
[00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:37.800]   Evaluation systems measuring just the end result point to either an independent contractor or an employee.
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:43.200]   Training a worker on how to do the job, or periodic or ongoing training about procedures
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:47.400]   and methods, is strong evidence that the worker is an employee.
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:51.000]   Independent contractors ordinarily use their own methods.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.300]   Those are all indications under behavioral control.
[00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:59.700]   Secondarily, financial control. Does the business have a right to direct
[00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:04.600]   or control the financial and business aspects of the worker's job?
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:09.800]   Consider significant investment in the equipment the worker uses in working for someone else.
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:16.600]   Unreimbursed expenses. Independent contractors are more likely to incur unreimbursed expenses than employees.
[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:22.100]   Opportunity for profit or loss is often an indicator of an independent contractor.
[00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:28.000]   Services available to the market. Independent contractors are generally free to seek out business opportunities.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.800]   Method of payment. An employee is generally guaranteed a regular wage amount for an hourly,
[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:37.200]   weekly, or other period of time, even when supplemented by a commission.
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:42.000]   However, independent contractors are most often paid for the job by a flat fee.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.200]   So those are all factors of financial control.
[00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:48.800]   Number three, relationship. The type of relationship depends upon how the worker
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:51.900]   and business perceive their interaction with one another.
[00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:56.800]   This includes written contracts, which describe the relationship the parties intend to create,
[00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:59.600]   although a contract stating the worker is an employee
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:04.000]   or an independent contractor is not sufficient to determine the worker's status.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.400]   Benefits. Businesses providing employee-type benefits, such as insurance,
[00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:13.900]   a pension plan, vacation pay, or sick pay, have employees.
[00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:18.300]   Businesses generally do not grant these benefits to independent contractors.
[00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:21.400]   The permanency of the relationship is important.
[00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:25.000]   An expectation that the relationship will continue indefinitely,
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.600]   rather than for a specific project or period, is generally seen as evidence
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:33.800]   that the intent was to create an employer-employee relationship.
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:36.600]   Services provided, which are a key activity of the business,
[00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:41.500]   the extent to which services performed by the worker are seen as a key aspect
[00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:44.100]   of the regular business of the company.
[00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:48.000]   So you need to think about those things with regard to your situation,
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.500]   and I want other listeners to think about them as well,
[00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:55.000]   that if you are going to classify yourself as a contractor, you need to be a contractor,
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.100]   which means that you need to go through this list and make sure
[00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:03.200]   that on as many of those things as possible, your structure of work,
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:06.700]   the structure of relationship, reflects a contractor status.
[00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:08.700]   On the other hand, if you're an employee,
[00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:12.000]   there are less risks with simply being classified as an employee,
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:18.400]   but it would be fairly evident in that list of ways to look at it.
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:23.000]   So let's proceed forward on the assumption that you are eligible
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.100]   to either be hired as an employee of the contracting firm,
[00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:29.900]   or you're eligible to establish your own contracting firm.
[00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:31.800]   How would you decide between these?
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:35.900]   There are three major potential areas of benefit.
[00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:37.500]   Notice I say potential.
[00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:42.600]   They're not guaranteed areas of benefit, but they are potential areas of benefit.
[00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:49.100]   Number one is tax, number two is deductions, and number three is benefits.
[00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:50.500]   So let's talk about them.
[00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:53.700]   Tax, deductions, and benefits.
[00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:56.900]   The first thing to understand is the potential tax savings
[00:09:56.900 --> 00:10:02.600]   from being as an employee relate to your employment taxes.
[00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:09.100]   So if you are an employee and you're paid $100,000 per year as an employee,
[00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:15.600]   you pay employment taxes of 7.65% that's deducted from your wages.
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:20.300]   So that's $7,650 that is deducted from your $100,000 wages,
[00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:23.200]   and you see that reflected on your paycheck.
[00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:28.800]   Your employer pays an additional $7,650 of taxes
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:32.300]   that is not reflected on your paycheck.
[00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:37.100]   So the total cost to them is the cost of salary
[00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:41.300]   plus the cost of the employment taxes that they're paying
[00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:45.200]   plus any other costs or benefits, costs of insurance programs,
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:48.400]   costs of maintaining an office for you, etc.
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:53.700]   And so you're going to be paying in that situation $7,650.
[00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:57.500]   Now if you generate in your own company
[00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:00.800]   that is listed as a contractor to this employing business,
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:05.600]   if you generate a $100,000 profit for this company,
[00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:09.300]   you will owe, if you are a sole proprietorship,
[00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:14.200]   you will owe 15.3% of your total compensation to the IRS
[00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:17.000]   in the form of self-employment taxes.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.600]   That would be a total of $15,300.
[00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:26.500]   The opportunity that you have is to take some of your wages
[00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:30.300]   and change the classification, sorry, let me be precise,
[00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:31.800]   I used the wrong word.
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:34.800]   The opportunity that you have is to take some of your income
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:39.100]   and instead of classifying that income as wages,
[00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:42.300]   rather you classify it as profit,
[00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:46.400]   and you do this within the context of your own S corporation,
[00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:50.800]   then you can possibly classify some of that as profit
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:53.000]   and avoid paying employment taxes on it
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.300]   because you don't pay employment taxes on profits or dividends.
[00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:59.000]   You only pay employment taxes on wages.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.400]   So let's assume that you have $100,000 of potential profit
[00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:07.600]   in your business classified as an S corporation,
[00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:11.500]   and you now say, "I'm going to pay myself a $50,000 salary."
[00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:17.300]   With a $50,000 salary, you're going to pay 7.65% as the employee,
[00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:18.400]   but you're also the employer,
[00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:23.000]   so you're going to pay the other 7.65% as the employer.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:29.400]   So your total tax bill is on the $50,000 is $7,650.
[00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:32.400]   However, you can then issue yourself a dividend
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:35.700]   reflecting your profit of $50,000,
[00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:40.600]   and that $50,000 would not be subject to employment taxes.
[00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:43.500]   So in that situation, you've now created an opportunity
[00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:46.800]   for you to generate $100,000 worth of income,
[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:50.600]   but only pay $7,650 of taxes.
[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:52.000]   Now the reason I use round numbers,
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.600]   it should be is that on this particular scenario,
[00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:57.100]   it should be obvious to you that you haven't won.
[00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:59.300]   You haven't gained anything here.
[00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:02.600]   So if these numbers are different, for example,
[00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:07.600]   if you were previously being paid a $300,000 salary,
[00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:10.200]   but now you could as an employee,
[00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:14.300]   but now you could change and you could be paid a $30,000 salary
[00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:19.000]   as an employee of your own business with a $270,000 dividend,
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.100]   now the numbers would be wildly in your favor.
[00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:25.700]   The problem is this is an area that's subject to significant abuse,
[00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:28.100]   and so you need to get the numbers right.
[00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:33.700]   The IRS will not tell you what is their definition of right.
[00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:37.200]   Basically, it's a subjective analysis by an expert
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:39.000]   who looks at it and says,
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.100]   "I think that this is a reasonable amount of compensation."
[00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:46.000]   If you're a doctor working for your own medical practice,
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:51.100]   it would be unreasonable for you to pay yourself a $20,000 salary
[00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:54.200]   if somebody that you hired in that position
[00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:57.600]   was going to be earning a $120,000 salary.
[00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:00.300]   But it would be reasonable for you to pay yourself,
[00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:04.400]   say, a $100,000 or a $110,000 or a $120,000 salary
[00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:08.500]   if you would need to hire somebody in that position at $120,000,
[00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:12.500]   and then you could take the additional $200,000 in profit
[00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:15.000]   rather than as wages.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   So that's the tax consideration, and it's significant,
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   but it's not always a clear-cut choice.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.700]   And the reason is that if you're going to play this straight,
[00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:28.700]   you need to create a salary that will be reasonable
[00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:30.800]   if subjected to an audit.
[00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:35.000]   Now, there are a few wrinkles associated
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.700]   with this potential tax savings that many people ignore.
[00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:40.700]   For example, if you do this,
[00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:42.800]   you will need to establish an S-corporation.
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:44.100]   That's fairly easy.
[00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:46.400]   The most common way to do that
[00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:49.500]   is simply to establish a single-member LLC
[00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:53.600]   and for that entity to elect to be taxed as an S-corporation.
[00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:56.200]   That brings modest records requirements,
[00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:58.700]   modest filing requirements, et cetera.
[00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:00.700]   But "modest" does not mean "none."
[00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:03.000]   So you still need to keep corporate records,
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.100]   you still need to file corporate tax returns,
[00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:08.800]   and so there may be additional costs involved
[00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:12.700]   for accounting fees or additional costs of time.
[00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:15.600]   If the decision is simply between
[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:17.900]   "should I be an employee"
[00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:21.400]   and "should I run my own business"
[00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:26.600]   and the tax savings are of only modest comparison,
[00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:29.600]   there's not an obvious winner, stay an employee.
[00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:30.800]   It makes your life simpler.
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:35.300]   Get a WT2, you can do your 1040 in a few minutes
[00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:36.400]   instead of hours,
[00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:39.600]   you have fewer corporate record-keeping requirements, et cetera.
[00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:42.200]   So that's the tax situation.
[00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:46.000]   The second area of potential advantage or disadvantage
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   has to do with the area of deductions.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   And when I use the word "deductions" here,
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.800]   I mean, are there things that you would be able to deduct
[00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:58.000]   if you were running your own business
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.800]   that you wouldn't be able to deduct if you were not?
[00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:03.300]   So let's use an example.
[00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:05.900]   Let's assume that as a contractor,
[00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:08.600]   you can choose to live in Salt Lake City, Utah,
[00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:10.700]   or better, Park City, Utah,
[00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:14.300]   or Aspen, Colorado, or Telluride, Colorado,
[00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:16.600]   some beautiful little ski town.
[00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:20.400]   And as a contractor, you can choose to live in that location.
[00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:22.500]   That is the center of your operations.
[00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:25.200]   You do most of your work from that place,
[00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:28.200]   but quarterly, you fly to New York City
[00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:32.200]   and you spend two weeks in New York City
[00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:35.300]   consulting with clients, working with them in person.
[00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:38.000]   Well, now, all of your travel expenses
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.400]   going from your home location to your client's site
[00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:43.300]   now become deductible expenses.
[00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:46.400]   You're not incurring commuting costs.
[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:49.100]   It's all part of just simply business travel.
[00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:52.300]   Your hotel expenses, all of that stuff becomes business travel.
[00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:53.600]   But if you were an employee of the company,
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:55.400]   maybe they wouldn't let you live in Park City, Utah.
[00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:58.700]   Maybe they wouldn't let you live in Telluride.
[00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:01.000]   And so you, in that situation,
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.600]   now have to live in New York, maybe New York City,
[00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:06.300]   and now you have to commute to an office,
[00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:07.500]   and it's their headquarters.
[00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:09.900]   And perhaps you incur significant expenses
[00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:11.300]   commuting in from your office.
[00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:13.000]   Well, those are commuting expenses as an employee.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   They're not a deductible expense.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.400]   And so the question is, if you run your own company,
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:20.500]   is there some kind of expense
[00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:24.000]   that you would be able to move over onto the business books
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.500]   that you wouldn't be able to expense if you were an employee?
[00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:29.900]   And this, again, is also not always clear cut.
[00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:32.500]   It depends very much on the spending profile,
[00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:34.200]   on the lifestyle profile,
[00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:36.600]   and on the individual negotiations
[00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:38.600]   that you might make with the company.
[00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:40.800]   You could, with some companies,
[00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:43.900]   simply negotiate the fact that you work from your home
[00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:45.800]   in Telluride, Colorado,
[00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:48.200]   and on occasion, the company flies you in
[00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:49.800]   for quarterly meetings.
[00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:54.500]   And so you don't have to create your own company to do that,
[00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:59.200]   but sometimes it's the only way to actually accomplish that.
[00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:03.400]   And so if you look at your expense profile and you say,
[00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:05.300]   "There are some deductions that I could take
[00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:08.600]   that could potentially be significant over here."
[00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:10.600]   The common ones that are attractive to people
[00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:13.200]   are travel expenses,
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:16.600]   entertainment expenses, etc.
[00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:19.000]   And if you can set that situation up
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.500]   in an advantageous way by running your own company
[00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:24.000]   such that you can take more deductions,
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.100]   then it can help.
[00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:28.300]   So now let's go back to my $100,000 example.
[00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:32.700]   Let's assume for a moment that the profit of the company
[00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:36.200]   was probably going to be $100,000,
[00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:38.500]   but through a very careful reading
[00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:43.700]   of the tax deduction laws for businesses
[00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:45.400]   and through an understanding
[00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:48.100]   that you can generate ordinary
[00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:51.700]   and necessary business expenses in your business
[00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:55.000]   that obviously qualify for full deductibility,
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.300]   and you can do this in a proper way,
[00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:00.500]   you can decrease that taxable profit
[00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:05.000]   from $100,000 to $70,000.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.600]   And now you can then make a good argument
[00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:12.100]   that your salary should be pegged at $30,000
[00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:14.500]   with a dividend payment of $40,000,
[00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:16.600]   totaling $70,000.
[00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:19.000]   Well, now, yes, you still are going to incur
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.500]   a total cost of 15.3% of employment taxes
[00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:24.500]   on your $30,000 salary,
[00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:27.000]   which would be just under $4,600,
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.500]   total $4,590.
[00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:32.600]   But that's less than the $7,650,
[00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:35.200]   and you did it in an advantageous way.
[00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:37.300]   Your expenses were not expenses that—
[00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:40.900]   you gained some fun, some pleasure from those expenses
[00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:42.700]   by being able to go into the contractor
[00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:44.900]   or some other additional benefits.
[00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:46.500]   So that's where we talk about deductions,
[00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:48.400]   and there may be significant deductions
[00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:52.100]   that you can incur as a contractor that you can't.
[00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:55.200]   And it all has to do with what is the setup
[00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:56.500]   that your company gives you
[00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:59.200]   for unreimbursed employee expenses
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:01.300]   versus do they give you an expense account?
[00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:03.000]   You know, what do they actually provide for you?
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.500]   What's the total compensation of pay,
[00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:07.900]   the package that they're willing to offer to you?
[00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:09.400]   We'll come back to that in a moment.
[00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:11.500]   The third area has to do with benefits,
[00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:12.900]   employee benefits.
[00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:14.700]   And so here we would talk about things
[00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:16.700]   like insurance programs
[00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:20.700]   and also things such as—
[00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:24.200]   things such as retirement programs.
[00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:28.400]   So let's say that you could generate a $100,000 salary,
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:30.500]   but the company that you would work for
[00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:36.100]   has a mediocre insurance policy and no 401(k).
[00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:37.400]   But you, on the other hand,
[00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:39.600]   are a whiz with your personal finances.
[00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:43.100]   You can live on $2,000 a month, $24,000,
[00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:46.100]   but you have a daughter who has special needs
[00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:49.300]   and has a massive annual bill
[00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:53.500]   that just generates huge medical costs.
[00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:56.100]   And in addition, you really want to save for retirement
[00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:58.700]   because you think that these medical costs in the future
[00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:00.800]   might force you into bankruptcy.
[00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:02.300]   So what you could do in that situation,
[00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:04.400]   if a fact pattern like that emerged,
[00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:06.800]   would be to establish your own company.
[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:09.600]   And in your own company, you would do two things.
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:11.500]   You would go ahead and secure
[00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:15.800]   a very nice medical insurance policy,
[00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:18.300]   which now would give you large—
[00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:21.000]   the ability to expense large amounts of your medical costs
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.800]   in a totally deductible way towards your company
[00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:24.800]   because it would cover your minor dependents.
[00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:26.300]   You might also even take it to the point
[00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:32.100]   where you set up a self-reimbursed medical plan
[00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:35.300]   where you could set that plan up
[00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:36.300]   and you could arrange it to—
[00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:37.600]   maybe you have 10 children
[00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:40.000]   and all of your children have the world's crookedest teeth
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.400]   and you're facing $4,000 per year—
[00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:44.900]   or I'm making up silly facts—
[00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:45.900]   but you have 10 children,
[00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:47.400]   they all have crazy crooked teeth,
[00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:50.000]   and you're going to generate $15,000 a year
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.500]   of orthodontia bills for the next 10 years.
[00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:54.900]   Well, in that situation,
[00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:58.000]   you would set up a self-reimbursed medical plan in your company
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.600]   so that you could reimburse all of that massive orthodontia bill,
[00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:05.600]   which is ordinarily not an inexpensable cost
[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:09.100]   under a standard group health insurance plan.
[00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:10.900]   And so back to the sick daughter,
[00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:12.000]   you get a Cadillac plan,
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   maybe a self-reimbursed medical program
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.700]   that you set up that pays you for—
[00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:17.600]   maybe you have to commute, your daughter has cancer,
[00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:19.000]   and you've got to commute two states over.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.400]   Well, you go ahead and set up a mileage reimbursement
[00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:22.700]   as part of your medical plan
[00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:25.000]   and you reimburse yourself for all that commuting mileage
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.100]   to medical appointments.
[00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:29.400]   And then you establish a 401(k) plan
[00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:31.700]   and you set up a solo 401(k)
[00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:34.500]   or you have a 401(k) for you and your assistant
[00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:38.300]   or you and your fellow employees of the company,
[00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:42.000]   and you set that 401(k) up in such a way
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.900]   that you can defer and contribute the maximum amount
[00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:50.300]   of possibly as much as $50,000-something per year
[00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:52.000]   into that 401(k).
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.500]   And so a situation like that,
[00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:57.500]   for someone in that weird but not unrealistic fact pattern,
[00:22:57.500 --> 00:22:59.800]   a situation like that would mean
[00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:03.200]   that you could set up a benefit structure in your own company
[00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:06.600]   that would be highly advantageous to you
[00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:08.300]   in a fact pattern like I described,
[00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:11.700]   where you can now deduct massive numbers of medical expenses.
[00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:13.100]   That lowers your profits.
[00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:16.300]   You reduce your taxable income in your company
[00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:17.300]   to a very low level,
[00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:20.600]   possibly that qualifies you for some kinds of subsidies
[00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:22.000]   or government benefits.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.700]   And then by establishing the 401(k)
[00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:26.000]   and deferring huge amounts into the 401(k),
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.700]   you establish a creditor-protected pot of money
[00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:30.400]   so that if your daughter's illness drives you
[00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:32.000]   into bankruptcy in the future,
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.600]   you have some bankrupt-proof funds,
[00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:38.000]   some exempt funds that you would be able to merge
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.200]   on the other side of bankruptcy with.
[00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:43.100]   So those are the three levels of analysis.
[00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:44.300]   I know that's complex.
[00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:45.600]   I know that's a lot.
[00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:47.000]   What I would say is,
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.600]   to keep it simple for your situation,
[00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:51.900]   if you think about those three things,
[00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:57.200]   if there's not an obvious, clear winner
[00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:59.000]   based upon those three factors for you,
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.800]   and it's kind of a toss-up,
[00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:03.800]   and to me, $3 to $10 an hour sounds like a toss-up.
[00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:06.600]   $10 is very different than $3, but you can do the math.
[00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:08.600]   But if there's not an obvious, clear winner,
[00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:09.800]   just take the employee package.
[00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:10.800]   It'll be simpler.
[00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:12.200]   Your life will be simpler.
[00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:14.300]   And then what you do is take the employee package
[00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:16.700]   and then start your own little business on the side
[00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:18.900]   in something related or something else,
[00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:19.700]   which will give you,
[00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:21.800]   as long as you can generate some income there,
[00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:23.800]   it will give you most of those benefits
[00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:25.900]   without having to deal with all of the hassle
[00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:27.400]   of being a contractor.
[00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:29.700]   Now, I've done this analysis for many clients,
[00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:33.000]   and there have been answers that emerged both ways.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.800]   Some people, it's a clear winner
[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:39.200]   that they should go to being a contractor.
[00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:40.300]   In others, it's a clear winner
[00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:42.100]   that they should go to being an employee.
[00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:45.300]   And I would say that there are other little benefits.
[00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:47.700]   So, for example, are you thinking about buying a house?
[00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:49.300]   Well, if you're thinking about buying a house,
[00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:53.300]   you'll find that your W-2 wages secure a mortgage for you
[00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:57.400]   much more easily than your profits do.
[00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:59.000]   And so those are the three factors
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:03.300]   that you'll need to look through to make your decision.
[00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:05.600]   - Okay, yeah, I think that's a very detailed answer.
[00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:08.300]   I think, you know, the third option
[00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:11.200]   is definitely where I was leaning,
[00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:12.800]   meaning if I could make it work,
[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:14.900]   because I think there are, like in a situation,
[00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:16.300]   I don't necessarily have any medical bills
[00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:19.200]   or children or anything, but the retirement option,
[00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:21.800]   for example, is something that I think
[00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:25.700]   could drop that taxable income significantly.
[00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:28.400]   So I think I need to do a little bit more research,
[00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:32.200]   especially on the how much I can get paid more.
[00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:33.800]   Like you said, there is a big difference
[00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:36.700]   between $3 and $10 an hour.
[00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:39.600]   You know, I think also, and again, you can clarify for me,
[00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:41.700]   I think the reason it is more,
[00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:44.400]   and this is why I want to investigate further,
[00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:46.400]   is because they don't have to pay me those benefits, right?
[00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:47.900]   They don't have to offer the 401(k)
[00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:52.100]   and the health insurance plan, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:56.700]   And so I can get that back in a higher hourly wage.
[00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:59.800]   - Right, and this is why the IRS is so careful
[00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:01.900]   about misclassification,
[00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:04.100]   why they hold the business responsible,
[00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:08.200]   because it's very much in a business owner's interest
[00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:11.600]   to misclassify people as contractors
[00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:14.000]   rather than as employees.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:18.500]   Because in so doing, they save significant expenses.
[00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:20.200]   They also save significant liability.
[00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:21.500]   So is it the cost of benefits?
[00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:23.200]   Yes, it's the cost of benefits programs,
[00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:24.900]   the cost of health insurance programs.
[00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:26.700]   It's getting classified as a big company
[00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:27.700]   instead of a little company
[00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:29.700]   and having more stringent requirements.
[00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:33.600]   It's the ability to save on paying unemployment insurance,
[00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:35.000]   all of those things.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.600]   I don't want, you know, with my business,
[00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:41.400]   I prefer to always avoid hiring employees,
[00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:44.200]   because employees generate significant headaches,
[00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:48.200]   significant administrative problems, and major expenses.
[00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:51.600]   And most employment contracts are structured in such a way
[00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:56.400]   that they require ongoing costs.
[00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:58.900]   You know, you have to pay your employee $5,000 a month,
[00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:01.000]   and you gotta pay your employee $5,000 a month
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:05.300]   regardless of how much work they do,
[00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:07.100]   regardless of how much work you do.
[00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:09.100]   So what I have sought to do in my business
[00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:12.600]   is to work exclusively with contractors.
[00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:15.400]   And I work exclusively with contractors
[00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:19.800]   because that allows me to save all of the legal liability,
[00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:22.600]   the administrative expense of providing office space
[00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:23.700]   and equipment, et cetera.
[00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:25.400]   They can provide their own equipment.
[00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:29.900]   It allows me to hire and fire with total freedom,
[00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:31.900]   not to worry about this employee's gonna sue me
[00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:33.600]   for a wrongful termination.
[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:37.900]   It allows me to adjust the amount of work
[00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:40.800]   that I buy to the amount of work that I have.
[00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:42.500]   So if it's a simple hourly thing,
[00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:43.900]   and I just pay for the hours I use,
[00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:45.600]   if I'm not working, I'm not paying.
[00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:49.800]   And so it's a vast, for a business that can function
[00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:52.400]   on a contractor basis,
[00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:54.700]   from a business planning perspective,
[00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:58.500]   it's vastly superior to hire contractors,
[00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:00.500]   even if you pay a higher rate
[00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:03.900]   because of all of the total savings.
[00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:07.600]   However, only some businesses can function on contractors.
[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:09.500]   You can't, there's many businesses
[00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:11.700]   that you can't just have a different guy coming in every day.
[00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:14.900]   If you've got a store and you need a manager for that store,
[00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:17.100]   you can't bring in a different manager as a contractor
[00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:19.300]   every week of the year, you need a manager.
[00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:22.900]   And so that system, while superior on paper,
[00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:24.600]   will often be completely destroyed
[00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:25.500]   by the nature of the business.
[00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:27.100]   You have to have employees.
[00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:30.200]   And so yes, it's well within their interest
[00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:32.200]   to pay you as a contractor
[00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:35.300]   because they don't owe you anything at that point in time.
[00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:37.900]   If they lay you off, they don't have to pay you severance.
[00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:40.800]   And obviously, the severance is not a legal requirement,
[00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:43.700]   but it's a custom in certain kinds of industries.
[00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:44.900]   And so from a contractor,
[00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:46.300]   they just don't renew your contract.
[00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:50.500]   So you have significantly less security as a contractor.
[00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:52.800]   And that's why I say the increased compensation
[00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:54.500]   needs to reflect that.
[00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:55.900]   Now, what I would point out to you
[00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:58.500]   is that one additional area of analysis
[00:28:58.500 --> 00:28:59.500]   and with this we'll wrap up,
[00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:01.500]   but I would say you need to also think
[00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:05.000]   about your personal lifestyle benefits as a contractor.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:06.400]   So if you're an employee,
[00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:08.700]   are you required to be there Monday through Friday
[00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:10.000]   from eight to five?
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.100]   That's a lifestyle cost.
[00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:13.800]   I've never wanted to be an employee
[00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:19.300]   because I haven't wanted to work, trade time for money ever.
[00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:22.100]   The last time I traded time for money was in college
[00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:23.500]   and I didn't like it.
[00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:25.600]   I want to trade money for results.
[00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:27.900]   And so if I can get my results on Monday
[00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:32.000]   from noon till midnight and Tuesday noon till midnight,
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.900]   and then I can get on an airplane on Wednesday
[00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:35.700]   and travel Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday,
[00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:37.700]   to me, that's a major lifestyle benefit.
[00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:40.300]   And I've never been scared of the insecurity
[00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:42.200]   that comes with being a contractor
[00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:43.900]   because I crave the flexibility
[00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:45.900]   that comes with being a contractor.
[00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:49.200]   And so there may be major benefits to you for doing that,
[00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:51.400]   especially if you're interested in early retirement,
[00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:52.700]   financial independence.
[00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:55.600]   As a contractor, you have the ability to allocate your time
[00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:57.100]   probably more freely.
[00:29:57.100 --> 00:29:59.900]   And so that means that you can always be trading in clients,
[00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:03.400]   trading up clients and massively increasing your income.
[00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:05.600]   As a contractor, you can change your contract prices
[00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:09.400]   at your demand, not at the company's whim.
[00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:11.400]   You have more room for negotiation.
[00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:13.100]   You have more room to prove your value.
[00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:16.300]   So you can potentially increase your income significantly.
[00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:18.400]   Or if you can't increase your income,
[00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:22.400]   you can potentially change your lifestyle flexibility.
[00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:24.900]   In some industries, it's totally reasonable
[00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:28.100]   that somebody could secure four contracts per year.
[00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:32.000]   And the contracts each take them eight months, right?
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.800]   So they work January, February,
[00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:35.500]   they do a contract and they take March off.
[00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:37.700]   Then they work April, May, and they take June off.
[00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:39.900]   And they work July, August, September off,
[00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:41.700]   October, November, December off.
[00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:43.200]   And so as a contractor,
[00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:46.600]   if you are genuinely working on a contract basis,
[00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:48.900]   then there can be major lifestyle benefits
[00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:50.300]   from that type of approach.
[00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:51.800]   I've recommended this to many people
[00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:54.900]   who are leaving their primary job.
[00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:56.800]   They don't want the personal responsibility
[00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:59.700]   and lifestyle constraints of being an employee any longer.
[00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:01.900]   They have some savings, but perhaps not so much
[00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:06.200]   that they're comfortable living exclusively on investments.
[00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:07.400]   They still want to work.
[00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:09.800]   Well, the natural shift is to move from being an employee
[00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:11.300]   to being a contractor.
[00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:15.100]   And if they can do a few highly paid contracts per year,
[00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:17.100]   then things work out and everybody's happy.
[00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:19.100]   It's a really lovely way to work
[00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:22.100]   if you can handle the perceived risk.
[00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:26.600]   So consider all of that as well as you make your decision.
[00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:28.100]   - All right, that really helps, Joshua.
[00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:29.100]   Thanks so much.
[00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:30.600]   - My pleasure.
[00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:32.600]   - All right, we move on.
[00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:35.000]   We're on the backup recording system today.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.500]   So we move on to Jeremiah.
[00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:37.400]   Jeremiah, welcome to the show.
[00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:39.400]   How can I serve you today?
[00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:40.800]   - Hi, Joshua.
[00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:43.600]   Thank you for taking my call and for your show.
[00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:45.900]   I've really appreciated it.
[00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:47.600]   And can you hear me okay?
[00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:48.200]   - Sounds great.
[00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:48.700]   My pleasure.
[00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:51.200]   Thank you for being here.
[00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:54.900]   - Could you, my question's a two-part question.
[00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:58.700]   And if you've already talked about this in the past episodes,
[00:31:58.700 --> 00:32:00.300]   I won't be offended.
[00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:03.300]   If you just direct me to that episode.
[00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:05.900]   But could you possibly explain like negative interest rates
[00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:09.100]   for the average American and how much that would affect them
[00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:12.500]   in their daily life since it's looking more possible
[00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:16.000]   that we could see that in the US in the near future?
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.400]   And basically, what's your thoughts on the effectiveness,
[00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:23.200]   negative or positive of negative interest rates
[00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:26.700]   on the economy in general as compared to other countries
[00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:29.900]   like Japan and Sweden, et cetera?
[00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:34.100]   How much money do you have?
[00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:37.700]   - Like net worth wise?
[00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:40.700]   About 900,000.
[00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:41.500]   - Okay.
[00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:44.400]   So you're in the range where this is starting to be significant
[00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:46.200]   because it can affect your investments.
[00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:51.200]   The reason I begin with that question is in my experience,
[00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:57.100]   many of the people who obsess endlessly about economic forecasting
[00:32:57.100 --> 00:33:00.400]   and prognostication, et cetera, just simply don't have any money
[00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:02.200]   and it's a waste of time.
[00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:04.700]   The reality is if you don't have a lot of money,
[00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:10.700]   then you need to focus on your income and keeping your income up
[00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:13.600]   and your income will adjust with the economic environment
[00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:16.800]   in a straightforward way and interest rates are really
[00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:19.000]   only an academic concern.
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.700]   Even if you have modest amounts of money,
[00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:23.900]   they're still just relatively an academic concern.
[00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:25.700]   They're not particularly interesting
[00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:32.900]   that you should focus deeply on it at any one particular time.
[00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:34.800]   On the other hand, when you start to generate more money,
[00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:38.300]   it does make a big difference because the interest rates
[00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:42.300]   that are reflected in the investment prices
[00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:46.500]   that are available are going to drive what returns are available.
[00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:52.500]   If interest rates go negative and you have negatively priced government debt,
[00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:56.000]   then now that's going to affect the risk-free rate of return.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:59.500]   That's going to affect the returns across the board of your portfolio.
[00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:03.400]   It is difficult.
[00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:05.800]   Let me keep it simple and say this.
[00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:08.300]   If you think about why interest rates would go negative,
[00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:12.100]   and so to be clear, we're not talking about somebody
[00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:14.400]   getting negative interest rates on a home mortgage, right?
[00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:15.700]   That's not going to happen.
[00:34:15.700 --> 00:34:19.400]   You're not going to go down to the local mortgage broker and say,
[00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:20.800]   "Hey, can I get a mortgage from you?"
[00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:23.100]   And the guy says, "Yeah, sure, we'll give you $200,000.
[00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:26.400]   And not only that, but we'll send you a check for $5,000 a year
[00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:29.500]   to cover this negative interest rate."
[00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:30.400]   That's not going to happen.
[00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:31.800]   It's not going to happen to your credit card company.
[00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:37.600]   Your credit card company is not going to send you a letter in the mail
[00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:41.600]   that says, "Here's a credit card with a $1,000 credit limit on it.
[00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:44.800]   And if you take the $1,000 and spend $1,000,
[00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:48.000]   we'll cut $100 off your bill and you'll have to pay us $900 back."
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.300]   So when we use the term negative interest rates,
[00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:51.100]   what are we talking about?
[00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:54.700]   We're talking about the interest rates on the bond market
[00:34:54.700 --> 00:34:57.400]   for government debt, government bonds.
[00:34:57.400 --> 00:34:58.800]   And interest rates do go negative.
[00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:02.100]   They have gone negative at various times over the last few years.
[00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:03.300]   I'm not equipped with the charts,
[00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:06.500]   nor have I recorded a standalone show on this to show.
[00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:09.800]   But they have gone negative over the past few years
[00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:12.000]   in a number of different places.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.400]   And so you ask yourself,
[00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:17.700]   "Why would a German investor buy German bonds with a guaranteed decrease?"
[00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:19.800]   Well, the reason is always safety.
[00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:23.000]   The reason that people do it is because you get safety.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:26.200]   And you reach a certain point in the investment markets
[00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:30.600]   where you're just desperate for something that can—
[00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:33.900]   you're desperate for something that can be returned to you.
[00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:37.600]   And so you say, "Well, at least if I put my money here,
[00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:40.000]   yeah, I might lose some in terms of—
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.400]   theoretically, in terms of the negative interest rates.
[00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:45.700]   Then I'll at least get it back."
[00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:47.800]   So that's how it works.
[00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:50.400]   And you see investors still taking that debt.
[00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:52.700]   Government bond markets function—
[00:35:52.700 --> 00:35:54.300]   it's a free market.
[00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:57.300]   A government has to pay what the market requires
[00:35:57.300 --> 00:35:59.100]   in order for them to get money.
[00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:02.300]   And so Argentina might do a bond offering,
[00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:07.300]   and they have to pay 22% on their government debt
[00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:09.700]   in order to get anybody to trust the government of Argentina.
[00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:11.700]   So they'll just list it as 22%.
[00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:13.800]   And then if history is any advice,
[00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:17.200]   then they will default on it a number of years later.
[00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:20.800]   On the other hand, Germany can offer negative interest rates
[00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:22.900]   on its government debt, and people will lap it up
[00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:28.800]   because they understand the fiscal constraint of the German nation.
[00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:31.100]   Beyond that, I don't have anything intelligent to say
[00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:35.300]   other than to say that if interest rates go negative,
[00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:39.500]   it's a sign that there's a flight to safety.
[00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:43.400]   And what to do in that from an investment perspective,
[00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:45.600]   I don't know.
[00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:46.100]   I don't know.
[00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:48.300]   So I don't think that I have a very good answer for you
[00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:51.200]   other than that little bit of introductory commentary.
[00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:53.600]   If you want to specify your question more, fine.
[00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:56.500]   What I would say is my answer is always going to come down
[00:36:56.500 --> 00:36:59.500]   not to what the particular interest rate environment
[00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:01.600]   happens to be at a certain time,
[00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:04.900]   but rather, do you have an investment plan
[00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:08.300]   that will satisfy that interest rate environment?
[00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:11.400]   Last week, I posted on Twitter
[00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:15.700]   that I've become much more of a fan
[00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:19.600]   of the old Harry Brown permanent portfolio concept
[00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:22.600]   because of its ability to give people something
[00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:24.700]   that is understandable
[00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:28.100]   so that they don't bail on their investments in bad times.
[00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:32.200]   And I've done several shows on the permanent portfolio
[00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:34.700]   that I've talked with Jake DeSilis about it,
[00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:36.100]   did a standalone show on it.
[00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:38.100]   It's just one of those very interesting concepts.
[00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:40.200]   The concept for the uninitiated is that you divide
[00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:45.400]   your investment assets into four different investment classes.
[00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:47.800]   You invest 25% into stocks.
[00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:50.000]   You invest 25% into government bonds.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:51.700]   You invest 25% into gold.
[00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:54.000]   And you invest 25% into cash.
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.700]   And you maintain that 25% ratio.
[00:37:56.700 --> 00:38:01.100]   And the idea is that you have part of your investment portfolio
[00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:06.200]   that will function effectively for you in any market condition.
[00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:08.100]   And so if you have negative interest rates,
[00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:11.900]   number one, of course, you'll have older bonds that are—
[00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:14.100]   I won't go through all the permutations.
[00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:15.700]   So what I like about that,
[00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:17.700]   while I don't know that the permanent portfolio
[00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:21.200]   is the world's greatest approach,
[00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:24.600]   people have tweaked it and taken that concept to a diff—
[00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:26.900]   you know, famously Ray Dalio,
[00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:31.500]   you know, built off of that with his ideas.
[00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:35.000]   But what I like about it is it gives people the confidence
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:36.600]   to know that they own an asset
[00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:40.300]   that will function in every economic circumstance.
[00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:42.900]   And that's what your question makes me think of,
[00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:45.200]   is simply if interest rates go negative,
[00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:47.000]   look at your asset classes and say—
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.600]   your investments and say,
[00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:52.600]   "Do I have something that will continue to perform in that period?"
[00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:56.700]   But beyond that, I'm not particularly concerned beyond that.
[00:38:56.700 --> 00:38:58.100]   - Okay, that makes sense.
[00:38:58.100 --> 00:39:01.600]   So do you think banks would charge a fee
[00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:06.500]   for storing your cash in their institutions?
[00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:07.800]   Because that's my main concern,
[00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:13.200]   is working on the $100,000 savings
[00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:17.700]   that you had mentioned in previous episodes
[00:39:17.700 --> 00:39:23.200]   to hopefully retire here early in the future.
[00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:27.500]   And I mean, obviously getting zero interest is horrible,
[00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:32.900]   but having to pay them money to save my money is even worse.
[00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:37.400]   So I'm concerned about that aspect of it.
[00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:40.800]   - This has happened repeatedly over the past years.
[00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:43.200]   This is nothing new.
[00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:48.300]   This has happened repeatedly over the last few years.
[00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:51.000]   I don't have the articles at my fingertips,
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:54.100]   but there have been a number of banks in Europe
[00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:56.600]   that have charged for this.
[00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:59.000]   There have been a number of banks in the United States
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.200]   that stopped taking large accounts.
[00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:06.300]   And what they do is the bank says,
[00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:07.300]   they send you a letter, right?
[00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:09.300]   They said, "Now we're going to start, I'm sorry,
[00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:11.300]   but for now we're going to start incurring
[00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:14.400]   a monthly service fee on your checking account,
[00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:17.900]   your savings account, your CD, et cetera."
[00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:21.500]   And so when that happens,
[00:40:21.500 --> 00:40:23.700]   and that's where the bank has to protect themselves
[00:40:23.700 --> 00:40:25.000]   because if interest rates go negative,
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:25.600]   what do people do?
[00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:27.000]   They withdraw cash.
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.600]   And so they withdraw cash and they sit on cash,
[00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:31.400]   which wipes out the bank's reserves
[00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:34.200]   and make things very difficult for them.
[00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:35.900]   And so this has happened repeatedly
[00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:38.100]   over the past few years.
[00:40:38.100 --> 00:40:41.200]   What I would say is you basically come down to,
[00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:46.900]   in that situation, you come down to what do I do?
[00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:48.100]   You know, I just found an article.
[00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:51.200]   This one's from 2016 with just a quick search,
[00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:52.000]   but from the Telegraph.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.200]   "Savers fear negative interest rates as NatWest,"
[00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:55.300]   that's a UK bank.
[00:40:55.300 --> 00:40:56.600]   "NatWest warns businesses
[00:40:56.600 --> 00:40:57.900]   they might have to pay to hold cash."
[00:40:57.900 --> 00:40:59.900]   I'm sorry, I can't pull them in real time
[00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:00.700]   from the United States,
[00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:02.400]   but search for how this has happened.
[00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:04.600]   You'll find a number of times this has happened,
[00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:07.800]   mostly with large accounts.
[00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:10.600]   Mostly with large accounts is the primary thing.
[00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:15.200]   Here's one from Reuters from a couple years ago.
[00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:17.100]   "Jyske Bank, Denmark's second largest bank,
[00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:18.800]   said it would introduce a negative interest rate
[00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:21.300]   of 0.75% for all corporate deposits
[00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:22.700]   and for private clients depositing
[00:41:22.700 --> 00:41:25.600]   more than 750,000 Danish crowns,"
[00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:28.800]   which is $111,100 U.S. dollars,
[00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:30.200]   "from December 1.
[00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:31.700]   A month ago, it said clients depositing
[00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:33.500]   more than 7.5 million crowns
[00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:36.800]   would be charged negative interest rates of 0.6%.
[00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:38.300]   Last week, Denmark's central bank
[00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:41.500]   cut its key deposit rate to -0.75%,
[00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:43.500]   a record low among developed economies.
[00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:44.700]   Earlier the same day,
[00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:46.400]   the European central bank cut interest rates
[00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:48.100]   and resumed buying bonds.
[00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:49.600]   The rate cut means that Jyske Bank
[00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:50.900]   now loses even more money.
[00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:52.400]   Chief Executive Anders Dam
[00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:54.200]   said in a video statement on the bank's webpage,
[00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:56.400]   "It is a lot of money and we have to pass on
[00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:58.700]   part of this bill to our customers," he said.
[00:41:58.700 --> 00:42:00.200]   "I don't hope that we will have to go lower,
[00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:02.700]   but I don't dare to promise it."
[00:42:02.700 --> 00:42:04.300]   Denmark was among the first to introduce
[00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:06.300]   negative rates in 2012.
[00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:08.300]   In August, Jyske became the first to offer
[00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:09.800]   a negative rate on a home loan.
[00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:10.900]   Well, here we go.
[00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:13.000]   In effect, paying customers 0.5%
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:14.900]   to borrow money for 10 years.
[00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:16.200]   Maybe I need to check what I said earlier
[00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:17.600]   because maybe I got it wrong.
[00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:19.900]   Denmark's largest bank, Danske Bank, blah, blah, blah."
[00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:22.500]   So the point is that this has been happening
[00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:23.300]   all around the world,
[00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:26.000]   so it's not a hypothetical concern.
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:27.400]   What I'd say is that in that situation,
[00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:29.800]   why does the bank want the money out of there?
[00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:31.100]   Well, they want the money out of there
[00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:33.100]   because it's costing them more money to have it
[00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:34.300]   than to not have it.
[00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:35.200]   And so in your situation,
[00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:36.900]   if you're only dealing with $100,000,
[00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:38.400]   and I understand that word "only"
[00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:42.300]   is a relatively loaded term,
[00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:45.400]   but you're not going to have a problem.
[00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:48.100]   If you have a million dollars in your bank account,
[00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:49.100]   this is going to have a problem.
[00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:50.600]   $100,000 is probably not a problem.
[00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:54.500]   If you're in doubt, take out $50,000 in cash
[00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:56.200]   and put it in a safety deposit box
[00:42:56.200 --> 00:42:57.000]   and just sit on the cash,
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   and then negative interest rates are not a problem.
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.200]   And then when they start paying you money again,
[00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:05.000]   then you can go ahead and start depositing money again.
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:10.200]   But it's a simple solution when you're in that world
[00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:13.100]   where you can simply take out a $50,000 withdrawal
[00:43:13.100 --> 00:43:14.700]   and store it in physical cash.
[00:43:14.700 --> 00:43:16.200]   No problem there.
[00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:17.900]   - All right, thank you very much.
[00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:19.200]   - My pleasure.
[00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:24.200]   - All right, we move on to...
[00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:25.500]   Let's see.
[00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:28.300]   This should be Benjamin.
[00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:29.100]   Benjamin, welcome to the show.
[00:43:29.100 --> 00:43:30.400]   How can I serve you today?
[00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:31.600]   - Hey, good afternoon, Joshua.
[00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:33.000]   Thank you for all you do.
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   And also thank you for doing a show
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.400]   on the Facebook group.
[00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:39.400]   Question.
[00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:39.900]   - Oh, my pleasure.
[00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:42.000]   Are you the Benjamin that asked the question there?
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.300]   - Yes, yes, I am, Joshua.
[00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:46.000]   - How did I do on my answer?
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   - You nailed it, Dylan.
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:49.100]   Thank you so much.
[00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:51.000]   That cleared a lot of things up.
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:52.800]   I'm one of your listeners who, like,
[00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:54.900]   when you say something, I'm writing it down
[00:43:54.900 --> 00:43:56.100]   and I'm telling my friends
[00:43:56.100 --> 00:43:59.200]   and anyone I could tell about it.
[00:43:59.200 --> 00:43:59.900]   - I appreciate that.
[00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:02.300]   - For years now, and I very appreciate what you do.
[00:44:02.300 --> 00:44:06.400]   And just to clarify, that cash position,
[00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:08.100]   it's actually brought a lot of opportunities,
[00:44:08.100 --> 00:44:12.200]   I think, to clarify, put on that comment.
[00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:14.700]   Like, opportunities we would have never even seen before.
[00:44:14.700 --> 00:44:17.300]   And even though we have lost,
[00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:21.100]   theoretically would have lost market money,
[00:44:21.100 --> 00:44:22.800]   we've gained a lot of opportunities
[00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:24.600]   and investment opportunities.
[00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:26.800]   And the peace of mind has just been,
[00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:28.800]   I don't know if I could put a price tag on that
[00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:32.300]   through this last six, seven months now,
[00:44:32.300 --> 00:44:34.000]   with my family and extended family
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:36.300]   knowing that worst case scenario,
[00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:40.500]   we were good for years in certain situations.
[00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:42.400]   So.
[00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:44.400]   - I'll comment on what you're saying there
[00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:48.700]   because to me it is,
[00:44:48.700 --> 00:44:51.900]   it's something that I'm learning in real time
[00:44:51.900 --> 00:44:53.500]   that nobody taught me.
[00:44:53.500 --> 00:44:56.600]   And so I'm a little bit on thin ice
[00:44:56.600 --> 00:44:59.600]   generating ideas that are,
[00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:02.600]   I'm not saying they're exclusively original to me,
[00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:04.700]   but I'm generating ideas in an original way
[00:45:04.700 --> 00:45:07.000]   based upon my experience
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:10.700]   with regard to holding savings.
[00:45:10.700 --> 00:45:14.500]   I was trained in what I would call
[00:45:14.500 --> 00:45:18.000]   the mainstream school of financial planning,
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:22.700]   which has a few basic tenets that are generally accepted.
[00:45:22.700 --> 00:45:27.500]   Number one, you want to invest money continually.
[00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:31.100]   And the best and often only type of investment
[00:45:31.100 --> 00:45:35.200]   that is discussed is stock market investments.
[00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:38.300]   Buying mutual funds, often within a retirement account.
[00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:39.800]   That's usually what people think of
[00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:41.900]   when it comes to investing.
[00:45:41.900 --> 00:45:45.500]   The second thing is money that's in the bank is unproductive.
[00:45:45.500 --> 00:45:48.100]   So you want to minimize the money that's in the bank
[00:45:48.100 --> 00:45:49.900]   because it's not earning you very much.
[00:45:49.900 --> 00:45:51.300]   And this has been especially true
[00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:53.300]   throughout my financial planning career.
[00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:55.900]   I wasn't around in the 80s when you could get,
[00:45:55.900 --> 00:45:58.600]   I was around, I wasn't working in the 80s
[00:45:58.600 --> 00:46:00.500]   when you could get double digit rates of return
[00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:02.000]   on your savings account.
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:05.500]   My entire life, I have gotten less and less and less
[00:46:05.500 --> 00:46:08.100]   and less and less and less interest on my accounts.
[00:46:08.100 --> 00:46:09.800]   I remember when I opened my first money market account
[00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:11.100]   when I was 18 years old.
[00:46:11.100 --> 00:46:13.900]   And I don't remember what it was, but it was a few percent.
[00:46:13.900 --> 00:46:16.100]   And I would get these online banking things of,
[00:46:16.100 --> 00:46:19.000]   I think, 4% and 3% on my online bank.
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:21.600]   And then it's just gone down, down, down, down, down, down, down.
[00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:24.500]   To the point where today it's practically 0.0.
[00:46:24.500 --> 00:46:26.900]   Basically for all intents and purposes.
[00:46:26.900 --> 00:46:30.300]   So, and then the third tenet of mainstream advice
[00:46:30.300 --> 00:46:34.400]   is you should have savings and emergency funds
[00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:38.300]   that provide you with three to six months worth of expenses.
[00:46:38.300 --> 00:46:42.200]   And what I was taught in my certified financial planner training
[00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:46.200]   is that you tell a client that it's six months of expenses
[00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:49.500]   if, for example, you have a single income household,
[00:46:49.500 --> 00:46:52.500]   if you have, everyone's relying on one job.
[00:46:52.500 --> 00:46:55.100]   But then on the other side is three months worth of expenses
[00:46:55.100 --> 00:46:56.500]   if there's a dual income household
[00:46:56.500 --> 00:46:58.600]   because it's more likely that if one person loses their job,
[00:46:58.600 --> 00:46:59.400]   the both aren't.
[00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:01.500]   So it's three to six months of expenses.
[00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:04.100]   And I don't have a problem with that advice.
[00:47:04.100 --> 00:47:05.400]   I don't think it's bad advice.
[00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:08.200]   I don't think it's wrong advice.
[00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:12.400]   What I think it is is short-sighted at times.
[00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:16.600]   And there's a whole other side that I didn't understand.
[00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:18.200]   And for me, this has been personal.
[00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:20.900]   It's been personal experience.
[00:47:20.900 --> 00:47:24.700]   When I realized that by having money,
[00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:27.200]   I could change my lifestyle into a lifestyle
[00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:30.200]   I didn't want to retire from,
[00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:31.900]   it changed my perspective.
[00:47:31.900 --> 00:47:35.100]   When I realized what I have taught in public
[00:47:35.100 --> 00:47:38.400]   is that if I tell a 24-year-old,
[00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:40.300]   "Listen, if you got 10,000 bucks in the bank,
[00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:41.700]   even if you don't have any savings,
[00:47:41.700 --> 00:47:43.100]   but if you got 10,000 bucks in the bank,
[00:47:43.100 --> 00:47:44.400]   you can do anything."
[00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:46.200]   And then I see those 24-year-olds
[00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:48.800]   pursuing all these interesting paths.
[00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:50.500]   Some people buy a motorcycle
[00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:52.800]   and ride a motorcycle for a year.
[00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:55.100]   But out of that, they generate the creative inspiration
[00:47:55.100 --> 00:47:56.900]   to go and start some business.
[00:47:56.900 --> 00:48:01.300]   And I recently was reading a story
[00:48:01.300 --> 00:48:02.500]   that Kevin Kelly wrote.
[00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:04.200]   He's the founder of Wired Magazine.
[00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:07.700]   And he was writing an article about...
[00:48:07.700 --> 00:48:10.300]   Kevin's just a fascinating guy.
[00:48:10.300 --> 00:48:12.300]   If there's one person that I would just enjoy
[00:48:12.300 --> 00:48:14.900]   spending a few days with, he's the kind of guy.
[00:48:14.900 --> 00:48:17.500]   And he was writing this article about him
[00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:18.900]   back in, I think, the '70s,
[00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:21.400]   traveling around Asia by himself.
[00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:26.200]   And he went and, again, traveled Asia by himself
[00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:28.100]   for a very long period of time
[00:48:28.100 --> 00:48:29.800]   in a day when there were no guidebooks.
[00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:31.100]   He didn't speak any of the languages.
[00:48:31.100 --> 00:48:32.300]   He didn't have any money.
[00:48:32.300 --> 00:48:33.700]   He was just bumming around.
[00:48:33.700 --> 00:48:34.900]   And yet he came back
[00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:37.500]   and then proceeded to build a fascinating career.
[00:48:37.500 --> 00:48:40.500]   I've been reading the autobiography of Steve Jobs.
[00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:42.200]   And I learned in that autobiography
[00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:43.400]   something I hadn't previously known,
[00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:47.700]   that Jobs spent a significant amount of time in India
[00:48:47.700 --> 00:48:50.800]   when he was younger.
[00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:52.900]   I don't remember exactly, at least six months,
[00:48:52.900 --> 00:48:55.900]   bumming around India, maybe longer.
[00:48:55.900 --> 00:48:58.500]   And then he came back and went through a series of jobs
[00:48:58.500 --> 00:49:02.700]   that later ended up in his career work.
[00:49:02.700 --> 00:49:06.700]   What I regret is that I didn't have the clarity of mind
[00:49:06.700 --> 00:49:11.000]   to do more of that when I was that age.
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:12.000]   I did a lot.
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:14.500]   Compared to most people, I've done more.
[00:49:14.500 --> 00:49:18.300]   But in hindsight, I could have done a lot more.
[00:49:18.300 --> 00:49:21.000]   But I was so focused on invest money.
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:23.700]   And I put so much money in my Roth IRA,
[00:49:23.700 --> 00:49:24.600]   which I then invested.
[00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:26.900]   And I knew I couldn't touch the money in my Roth IRA,
[00:49:26.900 --> 00:49:29.900]   that I said no to a number of experiences
[00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:34.500]   that in hindsight I wish I'd said yes to.
[00:49:34.500 --> 00:49:38.400]   And so when I recognized that the problem was
[00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:41.700]   that I was so focused on putting money into mutual funds
[00:49:41.700 --> 00:49:43.300]   in my Roth IRA,
[00:49:43.300 --> 00:49:45.400]   and that if I'd had more money in my checking account,
[00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:47.200]   I would have done more interesting things.
[00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:49.900]   And who knows where those interesting things would have led.
[00:49:49.900 --> 00:49:51.500]   Those interesting life experiences
[00:49:51.500 --> 00:49:53.300]   are wildly unpredictable.
[00:49:53.300 --> 00:49:54.800]   I can't tell somebody,
[00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:58.400]   "Hey, if you go and buy a motorcycle,
[00:49:58.400 --> 00:50:00.700]   then you'll travel and travel for three months,
[00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:01.700]   you'll have some experience."
[00:50:01.700 --> 00:50:03.400]   I have given that advice.
[00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:06.400]   Last year I was counseling a friend of mine,
[00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:09.600]   and he had lost his job,
[00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:11.200]   but he had a lot of money saved.
[00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:13.900]   And we were talking about career options,
[00:50:13.900 --> 00:50:16.500]   and he had no imagination.
[00:50:16.500 --> 00:50:18.600]   He had no interesting ideas for his life.
[00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:19.900]   He had no idea what he wanted to do.
[00:50:19.900 --> 00:50:21.000]   He didn't want to marry.
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:24.500]   He wasn't interested in...
[00:50:24.500 --> 00:50:26.100]   But there was nothing he was interested in.
[00:50:26.100 --> 00:50:27.700]   And so I counseled him very strongly.
[00:50:27.700 --> 00:50:28.700]   I said, "You need to go.
[00:50:28.700 --> 00:50:30.700]   You need to load up a pickup truck,
[00:50:30.700 --> 00:50:32.200]   put a truck camper on the back,
[00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:34.800]   and you need to go and work your way across the United States
[00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:36.900]   for six months, a year, a year and a half,
[00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:38.000]   just doing odd jobs.
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:40.900]   Grab a job here as a waiter for a few months.
[00:50:40.900 --> 00:50:41.600]   Be a...
[00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:44.300]   Work in the local skate shop that some guy...
[00:50:44.300 --> 00:50:45.600]   You need to meet some people
[00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:47.200]   and have a little life experience."
[00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:49.400]   Now, he didn't do it.
[00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:51.700]   He tried to, but then he wasted all his money partying
[00:50:51.700 --> 00:50:53.400]   and ran out of money and got a job.
[00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:56.200]   But what I saw in that situation
[00:50:56.200 --> 00:50:57.500]   was that life experience
[00:50:57.500 --> 00:51:00.600]   would have helped him to see more interesting avenues.
[00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:02.300]   So when I reflect on the life experience
[00:51:02.300 --> 00:51:03.900]   of some of these men that I admire,
[00:51:03.900 --> 00:51:07.400]   men like Steve Jobs or Kevin Kelly,
[00:51:07.400 --> 00:51:08.700]   who...
[00:51:08.700 --> 00:51:10.800]   And I see the impact of their life experience,
[00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:12.600]   I believe it's important
[00:51:12.600 --> 00:51:15.300]   to spend money on things like life experience.
[00:51:15.300 --> 00:51:17.000]   Now, when we add on all the other things
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:18.200]   that can be done with money,
[00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:20.100]   the things that I didn't conceive of,
[00:51:20.100 --> 00:51:21.300]   because I was so busy,
[00:51:21.300 --> 00:51:22.500]   I didn't have somebody come along
[00:51:22.500 --> 00:51:25.900]   and trained me on how to flip washing machines
[00:51:25.900 --> 00:51:27.600]   and dryers on Craigslist.
[00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:29.600]   I could have made a bundle at that.
[00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:31.300]   And when I think about the dumb jobs
[00:51:31.300 --> 00:51:33.000]   that I did in college,
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:34.300]   that where I was paid, you know,
[00:51:34.300 --> 00:51:36.700]   10 or 12 or 15 dollars an hour,
[00:51:36.700 --> 00:51:37.800]   versus what I could have done
[00:51:37.800 --> 00:51:38.700]   if somebody had given me
[00:51:38.700 --> 00:51:40.800]   a little bit of entrepreneurial training,
[00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:42.300]   it would have been so much more profitable,
[00:51:42.300 --> 00:51:44.600]   but I needed money to start that stuff.
[00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:45.600]   And so...
[00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:48.600]   And time, out of my own frustration
[00:51:48.600 --> 00:51:50.300]   with taking the mainstream path,
[00:51:50.300 --> 00:51:51.900]   I've changed some of my philosophies
[00:51:51.900 --> 00:51:53.200]   and I've tested them.
[00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:55.700]   And the farther I go in testing them,
[00:51:55.700 --> 00:51:57.100]   the more convinced I am
[00:51:57.100 --> 00:51:59.400]   that I'm right, at least for me.
[00:51:59.400 --> 00:52:01.300]   I wouldn't presume to tell someone else
[00:52:01.300 --> 00:52:03.700]   that they're wrong for working a job
[00:52:03.700 --> 00:52:04.600]   and putting their money aside
[00:52:04.600 --> 00:52:06.400]   and having a three-month emergency fund.
[00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:08.600]   I would just explain that in my experience,
[00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:10.400]   this has been something helpful to me
[00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:12.500]   and I've accumulated enough stories
[00:52:12.500 --> 00:52:15.100]   and data and observations from other people
[00:52:15.100 --> 00:52:16.400]   that I see the value in this
[00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:18.600]   and you can consider it.
[00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:19.500]   And this is where,
[00:52:19.500 --> 00:52:21.700]   when it comes to holding cash,
[00:52:21.700 --> 00:52:23.400]   an interesting conversation emerged
[00:52:23.400 --> 00:52:25.600]   in the Radical Personal Finance Community Facebook group
[00:52:25.600 --> 00:52:26.900]   a month or so ago.
[00:52:26.900 --> 00:52:29.200]   And some of the members of the community
[00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:31.700]   were commenting on the statement that I had made,
[00:52:31.700 --> 00:52:33.500]   that where they said...
[00:52:33.500 --> 00:52:35.400]   I had made a statement on a show where I said,
[00:52:35.400 --> 00:52:37.900]   "The $100,000 emergency fund
[00:52:37.900 --> 00:52:39.500]   is going to be the new status symbol of choice
[00:52:39.500 --> 00:52:41.300]   in the wake of the COVID pandemic."
[00:52:41.300 --> 00:52:42.300]   That it's going to...
[00:52:42.300 --> 00:52:45.500]   People realize how vulnerable they are
[00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:47.300]   to significant events.
[00:52:47.300 --> 00:52:49.100]   And it feels like,
[00:52:49.100 --> 00:52:50.200]   in the modern age,
[00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:53.100]   it feels like the pendulum of change
[00:52:53.100 --> 00:52:55.400]   is swinging bigger and faster.
[00:52:55.400 --> 00:52:58.400]   The pace of change today is faster than it's ever been
[00:52:58.400 --> 00:53:00.900]   and we seem to have these
[00:53:00.900 --> 00:53:04.300]   really significant crises more frequently.
[00:53:04.300 --> 00:53:05.900]   Now, is this guaranteed?
[00:53:05.900 --> 00:53:06.400]   I don't know.
[00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:07.400]   But what I mean is that
[00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:10.100]   there've been economic crises throughout history.
[00:53:10.100 --> 00:53:12.400]   But many times they're separated by centuries,
[00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:14.000]   if you go back and study the history.
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:16.600]   Or they're localized, they're not global.
[00:53:16.600 --> 00:53:18.100]   But if you look at the modern world,
[00:53:18.100 --> 00:53:20.900]   we're living in an age of global,
[00:53:20.900 --> 00:53:24.800]   massive crises and tremendous instability.
[00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:26.500]   I remember long-term capital management,
[00:53:26.500 --> 00:53:28.400]   when all of Asia was about to implode.
[00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:30.600]   And then you've got 2001,
[00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:32.100]   then you've got 2008,
[00:53:32.100 --> 00:53:33.700]   and now you've got 2020.
[00:53:33.700 --> 00:53:35.800]   And in my lifespan,
[00:53:35.800 --> 00:53:37.200]   being a millennial,
[00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:39.800]   I know nothing but crisis to crisis.
[00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:42.400]   That doesn't mean that
[00:53:42.400 --> 00:53:44.300]   the market doesn't, you know,
[00:53:44.300 --> 00:53:45.500]   recover in five months.
[00:53:45.500 --> 00:53:48.000]   That doesn't mean that we don't have a historic bull market
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:50.600]   from 2009 to 2020.
[00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:51.500]   That doesn't mean any of those,
[00:53:51.500 --> 00:53:52.900]   that there's anything wrong.
[00:53:52.900 --> 00:53:54.800]   It just means that our lives are filled.
[00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:57.600]   Whereas our grandparents
[00:53:57.600 --> 00:53:58.700]   and great-grandparents
[00:53:58.700 --> 00:54:02.600]   would go through decades of their life with,
[00:54:02.600 --> 00:54:03.800]   I guess I want to be careful in saying that,
[00:54:03.800 --> 00:54:05.600]   you think about World War I and World War II,
[00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:08.800]   but you could go through periods of time of great stability.
[00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:10.800]   I've never known a world of stability.
[00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:13.200]   I've only ever known a world of instability.
[00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:16.000]   And so when you realize how these crises
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:18.800]   seem to be getting bigger, more significant,
[00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:20.500]   who knows why, right?
[00:54:20.500 --> 00:54:23.300]   Some of us have some ideas, but who knows?
[00:54:23.300 --> 00:54:26.400]   Then having more reserves makes sense.
[00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:27.600]   And so I made that comment,
[00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:28.500]   and it was being discussed,
[00:54:28.500 --> 00:54:30.200]   and several listeners said,
[00:54:30.200 --> 00:54:32.000]   "I think Joshua's just gone too far.
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:35.500]   Like, there's a big cost to maintaining that much cash."
[00:54:35.500 --> 00:54:36.500]   And the idea was,
[00:54:36.500 --> 00:54:39.500]   "Well, if I'm getting 0% on my cash,
[00:54:39.500 --> 00:54:44.000]   but I can go and I can get 7% or 10% on my investments,
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:45.800]   that's too big of an opportunity cost
[00:54:45.800 --> 00:54:48.600]   to hold $100,000 of cash."
[00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:50.200]   I grant the argument,
[00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:53.100]   but I rejoined with this comment.
[00:54:53.100 --> 00:54:55.700]   I said, "I don't see it,
[00:54:55.700 --> 00:54:58.800]   the difference as 0% versus 10%.
[00:54:58.800 --> 00:55:00.500]   In my experience,
[00:55:00.500 --> 00:55:03.600]   when people start to accumulate cash reserves,
[00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:06.100]   they start to realize the options
[00:55:06.100 --> 00:55:07.700]   that they have for investment
[00:55:07.700 --> 00:55:10.000]   that they didn't previously see.
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:12.300]   And so I could very easily see somebody
[00:55:12.300 --> 00:55:14.100]   who didn't have cash,
[00:55:14.100 --> 00:55:15.700]   then they started to save cash,
[00:55:15.700 --> 00:55:18.100]   then they realized, "I don't like this job."
[00:55:18.100 --> 00:55:19.500]   And they quit their job,
[00:55:19.500 --> 00:55:21.800]   and they go get another job that they do like.
[00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:24.000]   How do you measure that in a rate of return?
[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:25.400]   I'm convinced it's significant,
[00:55:25.400 --> 00:55:26.900]   but I can't put a number on it.
[00:55:26.900 --> 00:55:28.300]   Or somebody who says,
[00:55:28.300 --> 00:55:30.100]   they're driving past,
[00:55:30.100 --> 00:55:30.900]   I'll pick on,
[00:55:30.900 --> 00:55:34.400]   I've been enjoying the food truck CEO,
[00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:35.700]   Brent on Twitter,
[00:55:35.700 --> 00:55:36.900]   and I've watched his story.
[00:55:36.900 --> 00:55:39.600]   And he and his wife got out of debt,
[00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:41.200]   and then he was working in a corporate job,
[00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:42.800]   and he started making pizzas on the side.
[00:55:42.800 --> 00:55:43.800]   And then a year or so ago,
[00:55:43.800 --> 00:55:45.100]   he quit his corporate job.
[00:55:45.100 --> 00:55:46.600]   And now he's got two pizza wagons,
[00:55:46.600 --> 00:55:48.600]   and he's selling tons of pizzas,
[00:55:48.600 --> 00:55:49.400]   making lots of money,
[00:55:49.400 --> 00:55:50.900]   growing all over the place,
[00:55:50.900 --> 00:55:52.000]   and just loving his new business.
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:54.000]   And I've often thought,
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:56.400]   I can imagine one of my listeners
[00:55:56.400 --> 00:55:59.800]   driving to work on a Monday,
[00:55:59.800 --> 00:56:02.000]   on a dreary Monday morning again,
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:03.300]   driving past the food truck
[00:56:03.300 --> 00:56:04.800]   with a for sale sign in the window,
[00:56:04.800 --> 00:56:06.200]   and saying, you know what,
[00:56:06.200 --> 00:56:07.200]   I'm going to do it.
[00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:08.700]   And they go, and they take 30 grand,
[00:56:08.700 --> 00:56:09.900]   and they go and buy the food truck,
[00:56:09.900 --> 00:56:11.600]   and start a new business.
[00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:13.600]   And those kinds of lifestyle changes
[00:56:13.600 --> 00:56:17.100]   are accessible to people with money,
[00:56:17.100 --> 00:56:19.100]   that they're not accessible to others.
[00:56:19.100 --> 00:56:20.400]   What I have found, simple things,
[00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:22.000]   and I don't talk much about my own life,
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:25.700]   but simple things like
[00:56:25.700 --> 00:56:27.900]   having $100,000 in the bank
[00:56:27.900 --> 00:56:29.100]   means that you can emigrate
[00:56:29.100 --> 00:56:32.800]   into most countries in the world.
[00:56:32.800 --> 00:56:34.500]   Things that aren't previously available to you.
[00:56:34.500 --> 00:56:35.800]   I've been thinking about doing a show on,
[00:56:35.800 --> 00:56:39.100]   I did a show on immigration to Canada
[00:56:39.100 --> 00:56:40.100]   with my friend Brandon,
[00:56:40.100 --> 00:56:41.300]   that was very well received.
[00:56:41.300 --> 00:56:42.900]   And by the way, I've heard
[00:56:42.900 --> 00:56:44.300]   that many of you went to him,
[00:56:44.300 --> 00:56:45.000]   and got his book,
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:46.400]   and engaged his services,
[00:56:46.400 --> 00:56:48.400]   and I think that's great.
[00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:49.000]   But I've been thinking about,
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:50.000]   okay, maybe I should do a show
[00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:51.400]   on some of the other places, the UK.
[00:56:51.400 --> 00:56:52.700]   The UK has this fabulous,
[00:56:52.700 --> 00:56:54.500]   fabulous new visa program,
[00:56:54.500 --> 00:56:56.800]   startup visa, and an innovator's visa,
[00:56:56.800 --> 00:56:58.000]   that in the wake of Brexit,
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:01.600]   they're trying to encourage
[00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:04.800]   new entrepreneurs to move to the UK.
[00:57:04.800 --> 00:57:06.900]   And so there's this really interesting wrinkle
[00:57:06.900 --> 00:57:08.900]   in the UK immigration system,
[00:57:08.900 --> 00:57:10.300]   where you can come in,
[00:57:10.300 --> 00:57:12.200]   and if you can come in on an innovator's visa,
[00:57:12.200 --> 00:57:14.200]   and bring a business to the United Kingdom,
[00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:16.500]   and you can demonstrate 50,000 pounds,
[00:57:16.500 --> 00:57:18.200]   which is something like 80-something thousand dollars,
[00:57:18.200 --> 00:57:20.900]   I think, about 50,000 pounds of reserves.
[00:57:20.900 --> 00:57:21.900]   By the way, on the startup visa,
[00:57:21.900 --> 00:57:22.600]   you don't need the money,
[00:57:22.600 --> 00:57:23.700]   but there's different sources.
[00:57:23.700 --> 00:57:25.700]   I won't get into the details of the visa program.
[00:57:25.700 --> 00:57:27.400]   But it opens up the opportunity for you
[00:57:27.400 --> 00:57:29.100]   to emigrate to a new country.
[00:57:29.100 --> 00:57:32.600]   And so, how many people's lives would be improved
[00:57:32.600 --> 00:57:34.500]   if they could leave one country
[00:57:34.500 --> 00:57:35.800]   that's not a good fit for them,
[00:57:35.800 --> 00:57:38.100]   and go to another country?
[00:57:38.100 --> 00:57:40.500]   You can easily get a visa to Mexico,
[00:57:40.500 --> 00:57:42.400]   a person of means visa.
[00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:43.700]   And so if you want to go to Mexico,
[00:57:43.700 --> 00:57:45.100]   having $100,000 in the bank
[00:57:45.100 --> 00:57:47.700]   makes it easy for you to do things like immigration.
[00:57:47.700 --> 00:57:49.700]   And so I know that these are the non-common things,
[00:57:49.700 --> 00:57:52.300]   but I'm convinced that the rate of,
[00:57:52.300 --> 00:57:53.100]   that the analysis,
[00:57:53.100 --> 00:57:54.700]   the opportunity cost on holding the cash
[00:57:54.700 --> 00:57:57.200]   is not 0% versus 10%.
[00:57:57.200 --> 00:58:01.100]   It's some significant number versus 10% or 7%
[00:58:01.100 --> 00:58:02.700]   in the stock market.
[00:58:02.700 --> 00:58:05.500]   And the more I experience it myself,
[00:58:05.500 --> 00:58:07.200]   the more convinced I am of that,
[00:58:07.200 --> 00:58:10.300]   and the more stories I hear of guys like you,
[00:58:10.300 --> 00:58:11.600]   the more convinced I am of it.
[00:58:11.600 --> 00:58:12.600]   So go ahead.
[00:58:12.600 --> 00:58:13.900]   I cut you off a little, Benjamin,
[00:58:13.900 --> 00:58:16.300]   but if you had more stories to share, go ahead.
[00:58:16.300 --> 00:58:18.500]   - Oh, no, exactly that.
[00:58:18.500 --> 00:58:21.900]   I'm sure there's opportunities that we had
[00:58:21.900 --> 00:58:25.500]   been around that we'd be able to see and analyze them
[00:58:25.500 --> 00:58:28.800]   and actually think do we want to pursue these or not?
[00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:30.600]   And it feels great.
[00:58:30.600 --> 00:58:33.800]   We've had just a, I don't know, it's a weird thing.
[00:58:33.800 --> 00:58:35.800]   When we first did it, it was kind of like,
[00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:38.600]   ah, like, what are we doing?
[00:58:38.600 --> 00:58:40.500]   The more that time has gone on,
[00:58:40.500 --> 00:58:45.100]   I can't see any other way at this point.
[00:58:45.100 --> 00:58:46.800]   (laughs)
[00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:47.700]   It has felt so good.
[00:58:47.700 --> 00:58:49.900]   And there's been this strength level
[00:58:49.900 --> 00:58:53.200]   through all this, it's dropped a cup completely.
[00:58:53.200 --> 00:58:55.600]   And we've actually made a lot more money
[00:58:55.600 --> 00:58:58.300]   and more opportunities since we made that decision.
[00:58:58.300 --> 00:59:00.600]   Oddly enough, I don't know how that works, but.
[00:59:00.600 --> 00:59:02.000]   (laughs)
[00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:03.100]   - Well, it's encouraging.
[00:59:03.100 --> 00:59:04.200]   That's how it should happen.
[00:59:04.200 --> 00:59:05.200]   I'll give one more example.
[00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:07.200]   By the way, Benjamin, did you have a specific question
[00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:09.100]   or you just wanted to share your story?
[00:59:09.100 --> 00:59:10.700]   - I just wanted to reach out to you
[00:59:10.700 --> 00:59:13.400]   to share a story and say thank you.
[00:59:13.400 --> 00:59:14.200]   - Good, good.
[00:59:14.200 --> 00:59:16.700]   So I'll just, I'll wrap up and move on to the next.
[00:59:16.700 --> 00:59:18.800]   Thank you for calling in and for asking the question
[00:59:18.800 --> 00:59:20.600]   and for doing that.
[00:59:20.600 --> 00:59:23.000]   I enjoy, one of the things that I've always tried to stress,
[00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:24.600]   I enjoy pushback.
[00:59:24.600 --> 00:59:26.100]   It forces me to be better.
[00:59:26.100 --> 00:59:28.400]   And so I encourage any listener who disagrees
[00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:31.300]   with anything I ever say, call me up on a Friday show
[00:59:31.300 --> 00:59:35.000]   and we'll chat about it and have a positive conversation.
[00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:37.900]   And the commitment that I made
[00:59:37.900 --> 00:59:39.400]   before I ever started speaking in public
[00:59:39.400 --> 00:59:41.500]   was simply that if I'm wrong, I'll just admit it.
[00:59:41.500 --> 00:59:46.400]   And so I really appreciate the comments and the suggestion.
[00:59:46.400 --> 00:59:49.000]   What I would add is, like, here's a practical way
[00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:50.600]   that I think people's lives change.
[00:59:50.600 --> 00:59:52.900]   I've watched a few people that I follow online
[00:59:52.900 --> 00:59:54.800]   who've recently needed new cars.
[00:59:54.800 --> 00:59:56.400]   And they've needed to get new cars
[00:59:56.400 --> 00:59:59.400]   because their previous cars were failing.
[00:59:59.400 --> 01:00:02.800]   And a simple thing that can have, I'm convinced,
[01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:05.600]   significant financial impact in your life
[01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:09.400]   is simply buying cars before they're needed.
[01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:10.600]   Buying cars before they're needed.
[01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:15.200]   We know that things like cars have a useful lifespan.
[01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:19.900]   And so I have a practice that anytime anybody I know
[01:00:19.900 --> 01:00:23.300]   is selling a car, I always consider buying it.
[01:00:23.300 --> 01:00:25.900]   And the reason is, the biggest risk that you have
[01:00:25.900 --> 01:00:28.600]   in the used car marketplace, which is, of course,
[01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:31.000]   in many markets, especially North American market,
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.700]   where there's an abundance of high quality used cars,
[01:00:33.700 --> 01:00:37.000]   not the same on a global basis, but in North America it is.
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.500]   The biggest risk that you have in the used marketplace
[01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:44.500]   is purchasing a car that is either a lemon from the factory
[01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:46.000]   due to that model in some way
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.300]   or that particular unit in some way,
[01:00:48.300 --> 01:00:51.100]   or a car that's been abused or not taken care of.
[01:00:51.100 --> 01:00:52.900]   And you can't control for that
[01:00:52.900 --> 01:00:56.100]   when you buy used cars with an unknown history.
[01:00:56.100 --> 01:00:58.500]   If you go to the auction
[01:00:58.500 --> 01:01:01.100]   where a car dealer accumulates their cars,
[01:01:01.100 --> 01:01:04.000]   there's nothing said at the auction
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.100]   as to why the car is there.
[01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:07.100]   The car may be there
[01:01:07.100 --> 01:01:09.000]   because the guy got to the end of his three-year lease
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:10.600]   and decided he was done with it.
[01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:11.900]   On the other hand, the car might be there
[01:01:11.900 --> 01:01:14.900]   because the guy had put $15,000 into it
[01:01:14.900 --> 01:01:16.500]   and still couldn't get the thing working right.
[01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:18.000]   And he said, "I'm just gonna take it."
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.800]   And car dealers dump cars all the time at the auction.
[01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:23.600]   Now, the car dealers take that risk on.
[01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:26.200]   They buy cars, then they try to inspect them,
[01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:27.600]   fix them, et cetera.
[01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:29.800]   And then to some degree, they take some of the risk
[01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:32.200]   of providing you a working automobile.
[01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:34.300]   So it's not that buying a used car at a dealer
[01:01:34.300 --> 01:01:36.100]   is forever a problem,
[01:01:36.100 --> 01:01:38.700]   but it's certainly something that is fraught with danger.
[01:01:38.700 --> 01:01:41.800]   On the other hand, if you know your buddy
[01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:45.000]   has a car that he bought new seven years ago,
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:46.700]   and now he's just decided to upgrade,
[01:01:46.700 --> 01:01:47.700]   if you can go to your buddy and say,
[01:01:47.700 --> 01:01:49.500]   "Listen, can I buy that car from you?"
[01:01:49.500 --> 01:01:50.700]   You know the history.
[01:01:50.700 --> 01:01:52.300]   Your buddy will give you a fair price,
[01:01:52.300 --> 01:01:53.400]   might give you a little discount
[01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:55.500]   from what the dealership will give, might not,
[01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:57.700]   but I would rather pay a premium
[01:01:57.700 --> 01:01:59.800]   to buy from somebody that I know
[01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:01.800]   versus a car that I don't know.
[01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:03.800]   And so as a simple car-buying strategy,
[01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:06.200]   I think the most intelligent strategy
[01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:10.500]   is to not drive a car into the ground necessarily.
[01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:13.900]   Some I think it's wise to, but not necessarily.
[01:02:13.900 --> 01:02:16.600]   But buy cars in the second-hand market
[01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:18.700]   that you know the history of,
[01:02:18.700 --> 01:02:20.300]   drive them for a number of years,
[01:02:20.300 --> 01:02:22.100]   and then when another replacement car
[01:02:22.100 --> 01:02:23.700]   emerges on the market, go ahead and buy it,
[01:02:23.700 --> 01:02:26.200]   and then sell your car at a high retail price.
[01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:28.600]   And it's a lot easier to sell a car
[01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:31.000]   when you don't know anything wrong with it,
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.900]   when everything is working fine.
[01:02:32.900 --> 01:02:34.500]   You know that certainly there's gonna be
[01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:36.100]   some maintenance items that are due,
[01:02:36.100 --> 01:02:38.200]   but it just makes more sense to sell the car
[01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:41.100]   rather than to wait until you have $1,500 of expenses.
[01:02:41.100 --> 01:02:43.100]   Then you have to go and buy the other car.
[01:02:43.100 --> 01:02:44.700]   Then you have to fix up the car.
[01:02:44.700 --> 01:02:47.700]   Then you have to go and sell it at that point in time
[01:02:47.700 --> 01:02:50.900]   and talk about all the new things that are done to it.
[01:02:50.900 --> 01:02:52.400]   But in order to do that, you need money.
[01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:53.800]   But most people don't have any money.
[01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:55.100]   And so there's a way of saving
[01:02:55.100 --> 01:02:57.000]   thousands and thousands of dollars
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:58.600]   by simply having money.
[01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:00.600]   And instead of waiting until you need a car,
[01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:01.700]   or instead of necessarily waiting
[01:03:01.700 --> 01:03:03.500]   until you've budgeted for a car,
[01:03:03.500 --> 01:03:05.400]   you just recognize, "Hey, here's a good car
[01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:06.100]   "that's available.
[01:03:06.100 --> 01:03:07.700]   "I'll go ahead and upgrade us now."
[01:03:07.700 --> 01:03:09.800]   And you do this regularly when good cars
[01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:12.500]   come into your network, and you're ready to go.
[01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:16.900]   So there's just an example for other people to consider.
[01:03:16.900 --> 01:03:18.700]   And I appreciate hearing your story,
[01:03:18.700 --> 01:03:20.400]   and I appreciate hearing the question.
[01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:24.800]   All right, we finish out today's call-in show with,
[01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:26.400]   it was Lenore, Lenore in California.
[01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:28.500]   Oh, looks like we may have changed.
[01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:31.200]   Is that Peter or is that Lenore?
[01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:33.600]   - Hello?
[01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:34.800]   This is Lenore. - Yep, Lenore.
[01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:35.400]   Okay, go ahead.
[01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:37.000]   I've got another caller that jumped on after you,
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:38.300]   so I didn't realize.
[01:03:38.300 --> 01:03:40.000]   Go ahead, Lenore, you're up.
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:41.900]   - Okay, great, thanks.
[01:03:41.900 --> 01:03:43.100]   Thanks for having me on.
[01:03:43.100 --> 01:03:45.600]   It's interesting that you're just talking about vehicles
[01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:48.300]   because my question sort of has to do with that.
[01:03:48.300 --> 01:03:49.800]   - Okay. - My husband and I
[01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:51.200]   are homeowners.
[01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:54.800]   We live in the Redwoods just north of Santa Cruz, California,
[01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:57.300]   and we were recently evacuated for two weeks
[01:03:57.300 --> 01:04:00.100]   because of the surrounding wildfire.
[01:04:00.100 --> 01:04:03.200]   Our home was spared, but this event kind of had us wondering
[01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:05.500]   if the money that we've saved to renovate our house
[01:04:05.500 --> 01:04:07.700]   could be better spent on making
[01:04:07.700 --> 01:04:09.800]   sort of a tricked-out evacuation vehicle
[01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:12.200]   that we could both store our valuables in
[01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:14.100]   and sort of live in temporarily
[01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:17.300]   rather than living in our friend's spare bedroom.
[01:04:17.300 --> 01:04:19.500]   We don't have any children, but we do have a parrot,
[01:04:19.500 --> 01:04:21.700]   so it would kind of be nice to be able to roll her cage up
[01:04:21.700 --> 01:04:25.500]   into like a customized wheelchair-accessible passenger van
[01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:26.800]   and take that with us.
[01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:33.200]   But of course, we have enough money to buy an already-made RV
[01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:35.900]   that has everything set up already.
[01:04:35.900 --> 01:04:38.100]   We're engineers, so we like the idea of a project,
[01:04:38.100 --> 01:04:40.400]   but at the same time, we don't want to sink a bunch of money
[01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:43.800]   into something that could take us a long time to complete
[01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:45.700]   since we are still in fire season.
[01:04:45.700 --> 01:04:50.000]   So I wanted to know sort of am I crazy for switching gears
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:53.200]   from increasing our home value to buying a vehicle?
[01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:56.200]   And as an RV-prepping newbie, just kind of wondered
[01:04:56.200 --> 01:05:02.200]   if you had an opinion on the bus versus the RV.
[01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:06.100]   - Let's pretend you bought an RV,
[01:05:06.100 --> 01:05:09.300]   maybe something modest, whatever your ideal version of an RV is.
[01:05:09.300 --> 01:05:10.900]   Pretend you bought one.
[01:05:10.900 --> 01:05:13.100]   Do you think you would use it for fun?
[01:05:13.100 --> 01:05:15.800]   Like, would you and your husband take trips in it for fun,
[01:05:15.800 --> 01:05:19.800]   or is this exclusively an emergency thing?
[01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:22.800]   - No, we were actually thinking about getting one for fun before
[01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:25.300]   because my family is located on the East Coast,
[01:05:25.300 --> 01:05:27.800]   and my husband is from Europe,
[01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:31.000]   so we do have like major road trips across the US
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.200]   planned for the near future.
[01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:38.800]   - Okay, so that to me is really worth thinking about.
[01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:42.600]   I don't care for the, that was too strong.
[01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:47.500]   I believe it's hard and dangerous to focus exclusively
[01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:51.100]   on doing something for an emergency
[01:05:51.100 --> 01:05:56.600]   because the chances of an emergency happening to you
[01:05:56.600 --> 01:06:00.300]   are always so relatively low that if you spend a lot of money
[01:06:00.300 --> 01:06:02.900]   on something for an emergency,
[01:06:02.900 --> 01:06:04.600]   and then the emergency doesn't happen,
[01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:06.600]   you can feel foolish.
[01:06:06.600 --> 01:06:08.500]   So if you bought a $100,000,
[01:06:08.500 --> 01:06:11.100]   maybe a beautiful road-trek camper van, right?
[01:06:11.100 --> 01:06:12.200]   I like road treks.
[01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:14.700]   Just a great little, for two people,
[01:06:14.700 --> 01:06:17.700]   that's what I would recommend is like something like the road treks.
[01:06:17.700 --> 01:06:19.500]   And so you buy a nice road trek,
[01:06:19.500 --> 01:06:22.000]   maybe you get a used one, but you spend $100,000 on this,
[01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:23.600]   or $80,000, or $120,000.
[01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:25.200]   Of course, you can do it cheaper,
[01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:28.100]   and then you park it in your driveway
[01:06:28.100 --> 01:06:29.500]   so that you have something to live in.
[01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:32.100]   If a fire comes through your house,
[01:06:32.100 --> 01:06:33.600]   you're going to hate the thing
[01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:35.900]   because it's going to sit there,
[01:06:35.900 --> 01:06:38.200]   you know it's sitting there rotting,
[01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:40.000]   you know it's fading in the sun,
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.300]   you know you got to put new tires on it every five years,
[01:06:42.300 --> 01:06:45.200]   whether you put a single mile on those tires or not.
[01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:49.300]   Everything in an RV starts breaking if you don't use it.
[01:06:49.300 --> 01:06:52.300]   And so now you're paying to have the thing maintained,
[01:06:52.300 --> 01:06:54.600]   and it'll sit there in your driveway for four years,
[01:06:54.600 --> 01:06:55.900]   and then you'll be like, "This was stupid.
[01:06:55.900 --> 01:06:57.300]   I should have done something else,"
[01:06:57.300 --> 01:06:59.200]   and you'll sell it and you'll be annoyed with yourself
[01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:00.600]   because you're not using it.
[01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:02.500]   On the other hand, if you bought an RV
[01:07:02.500 --> 01:07:06.000]   that you really liked and you used it,
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:07.600]   and it was the kind of thing that,
[01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:09.800]   hey, let's go ahead and go across to the East Coast,
[01:07:09.800 --> 01:07:11.900]   or let's go up and down the Pacific Coast Highway,
[01:07:11.900 --> 01:07:13.300]   or you know what, it's Friday night,
[01:07:13.300 --> 01:07:15.300]   would you like to go to the lake for the day tomorrow?
[01:07:15.300 --> 01:07:16.400]   And you buzz out Friday night
[01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:18.000]   and you go to the lake on Saturday.
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:19.900]   I mean, RVs are awesome to have
[01:07:19.900 --> 01:07:22.000]   if you could imagine using your lifestyle.
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.100]   In that situation, you'll be thrilled to have it.
[01:07:24.100 --> 01:07:26.400]   You'll go to a concert and you'll say,
[01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:27.400]   "Well, let's just take the RV,
[01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:29.800]   and that way we can stay on the lot
[01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:31.600]   when we go and see the big band,"
[01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:33.700]   or, "Let's go up to the mountains and go skiing,
[01:07:33.700 --> 01:07:35.400]   and we'll just stay in the ski lot.
[01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:37.600]   We'll make it a quick trip," and you'll love it.
[01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:39.100]   Like, having an RV is awesome
[01:07:39.100 --> 01:07:41.000]   if you could imagine yourself using it,
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.800]   and to me, that's where I would begin.
[01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:48.400]   So if you begin with whether you'll use it or not,
[01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:52.600]   then that'll drive you in one direction or another.
[01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:54.300]   Let's assume that you are going to use it.
[01:07:54.300 --> 01:07:56.300]   Well, if so, then I would say
[01:07:56.300 --> 01:07:59.500]   keep the fire evacuation idea in the back of your head,
[01:07:59.500 --> 01:08:01.800]   but keep the primary idea simply,
[01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:04.200]   what kind of RV would we like to have?
[01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:06.700]   And there are so many good options
[01:08:06.700 --> 01:08:08.700]   of things that you would like to have
[01:08:08.700 --> 01:08:13.700]   that you don't need to have something fancy.
[01:08:13.700 --> 01:08:16.900]   Any RV will work for fires
[01:08:16.900 --> 01:08:20.400]   and a fire evacuation plan if you're early enough.
[01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:22.900]   I guess the only area where things get risky
[01:08:22.900 --> 01:08:26.000]   is if you bought a trailer, a towable RV.
[01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.600]   You know, you see some of these horrible videos
[01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:30.100]   of people driving through a fire,
[01:08:30.100 --> 01:08:31.300]   and I imagine myself towing
[01:08:31.300 --> 01:08:33.500]   some 30-foot trailer through that.
[01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:35.600]   That's not very good, but what I would do
[01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:37.800]   if I were in that situation, if I bought a trailer,
[01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:40.300]   and because I decided a trailer RV was best for me,
[01:08:40.300 --> 01:08:43.100]   is I would say, "If there's a fire threat,
[01:08:43.100 --> 01:08:45.500]   "we're gonna leave any time it looks like
[01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:46.700]   "there's any kind of fire threat
[01:08:46.700 --> 01:08:47.800]   "because I don't wanna be stuck here
[01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:49.100]   "trying to get a trailer out on the roads,
[01:08:49.100 --> 01:08:50.700]   "and we've got a trailer, so it's easy.
[01:08:50.700 --> 01:08:53.100]   "So we're gonna choose four locations,
[01:08:53.100 --> 01:08:55.800]   "one in each direction, of four cool little parks
[01:08:55.800 --> 01:08:57.900]   "or friends' houses that we could park at,
[01:08:57.900 --> 01:08:59.700]   "a nice little state park with cell phone access
[01:08:59.700 --> 01:09:02.400]   "so we can work, and if there's a fire threatening our area,
[01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:05.200]   "we're just gonna go to that park that's one hour away,
[01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:07.600]   "and that's gonna be our destination."
[01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:09.300]   So you can solve for that.
[01:09:09.300 --> 01:09:11.300]   What I would say is if you just wanted an emergency vehicle,
[01:09:11.300 --> 01:09:14.700]   being engineers, you can do it much more efficiently
[01:09:14.700 --> 01:09:18.500]   and provide the basics with all individual components.
[01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:21.600]   So it doesn't take much.
[01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:23.900]   Depending on how much fanciness you want,
[01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:28.200]   you probably, being a household of two engineers,
[01:09:28.200 --> 01:09:31.200]   you, I'm sure, earn a decent income,
[01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:34.500]   you have money, you're probably not the kind of people
[01:09:34.500 --> 01:09:38.400]   who would be totally thrilled about camping regularly
[01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:43.400]   in an old cargo van that you converted into a camper.
[01:09:43.400 --> 01:09:45.600]   In that situation, you'll enjoy having
[01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:48.700]   some of the creature comforts of a purpose-built RV.
[01:09:48.700 --> 01:09:50.600]   But for an emergency plan, that's what I would do,
[01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:52.600]   is I would just get an old cargo van,
[01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:54.700]   I would put in that cargo van a bed,
[01:09:54.700 --> 01:09:57.500]   I would install the bed, I would put in it,
[01:09:57.500 --> 01:09:59.500]   I would use camping gear that could be taken out,
[01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:02.400]   so I wouldn't install a standalone stove,
[01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:05.200]   I would just put a simple little Coleman propane stove,
[01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:06.900]   the kind that you camp on the picnic table with,
[01:10:06.900 --> 01:10:09.200]   and I'd put some propane bottles in there.
[01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:12.300]   I might just put in a simple 12-volt refrigerator
[01:10:12.300 --> 01:10:16.300]   or a cooler, and I would make sure that I had,
[01:10:16.300 --> 01:10:21.500]   that I had just the basics that I needed to be comfortable
[01:10:21.500 --> 01:10:23.900]   if it were just an emergency thing.
[01:10:23.900 --> 01:10:25.300]   The other thing that I think you should consider
[01:10:25.300 --> 01:10:27.600]   is even before you do all that,
[01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:29.700]   I think that you should consider,
[01:10:29.700 --> 01:10:32.600]   rather than evacuating with your stuff,
[01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:34.000]   I think you should consider installing
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000]   a fire shelter in your home,
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.200]   and especially if you're doing some home renovations.
[01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:41.100]   I don't know if you've thought about this or priced it,
[01:10:41.100 --> 01:10:44.900]   but you could install a fire shelter in your home,
[01:10:44.900 --> 01:10:49.900]   and the ideal system would be an underground shelter
[01:10:50.500 --> 01:10:55.200]   buried in the slab with a good solid hatch on it
[01:10:55.200 --> 01:10:57.300]   that you could store things and that would be fireproof
[01:10:57.300 --> 01:10:59.400]   even if your home burned down.
[01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:01.200]   If you think about the options,
[01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:03.400]   so of course you can install a fireproof safe,
[01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:07.500]   but those fireproof saves are heavily due to,
[01:11:07.500 --> 01:11:11.600]   subject to actual, the time and the intensity.
[01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:13.500]   A fireproof safe is not always fireproof,
[01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:15.800]   but it's a good start, and so that can be a good way
[01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:17.600]   to protect some of your valuables.
[01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:22.300]   You could, and I think this would actually be a real asset
[01:11:22.300 --> 01:11:24.100]   that you could possibly increase your home value,
[01:11:24.100 --> 01:11:26.000]   but you could purchase and install
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:29.900]   a purpose-built bunker of some kind in your home.
[01:11:29.900 --> 01:11:31.900]   There's a company that's well-known in the bunker space
[01:11:31.900 --> 01:11:34.000]   called Atlas Survival Shelters.
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:37.100]   They sell a specific fire bunker
[01:11:37.100 --> 01:11:38.700]   that's designed for this purpose.
[01:11:38.700 --> 01:11:40.400]   They call it the FireNATO.
[01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:44.100]   Now the FireNATO is not designed for human use,
[01:11:44.100 --> 01:11:47.400]   so you could install a proper bunker into your home,
[01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:53.100]   and a proper bunker with a filtration system,
[01:11:53.100 --> 01:11:57.100]   with beds in it, with a sink, whatever.
[01:11:57.100 --> 01:11:59.400]   You can just do a small one or a big one,
[01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:02.400]   and if you have a proper air system built into it,
[01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:05.000]   then that would be safe as a retreat for you
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.200]   if a fire came to your place.
[01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:09.900]   I think this, if I lived in a fire-prone region
[01:12:09.900 --> 01:12:11.800]   and I was living in the urban interface
[01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:13.100]   where there were a decent chance
[01:12:13.100 --> 01:12:15.800]   that a forest fire would take my house,
[01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:19.000]   and if you had the money and it wasn't a crazy expense,
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:20.800]   I would look at that and I would seriously consider
[01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:25.200]   installing a proper bunker with an air system,
[01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:26.700]   an air filtration system,
[01:12:26.700 --> 01:12:28.500]   that would be a safe place of retreat.
[01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:30.800]   So if the roads are blocked, and this, of course,
[01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:31.900]   if you lived in a place
[01:12:31.900 --> 01:12:33.400]   where maybe you didn't have a good escape route,
[01:12:33.400 --> 01:12:35.200]   if you got four good escape routes in four directions,
[01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:36.800]   you don't need it, but if you lived in a place
[01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:37.900]   where you didn't have a good escape route,
[01:12:37.900 --> 01:12:39.600]   I would install a proper bunker for people,
[01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:43.000]   for human habitation during a fire.
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.300]   But if you just wanted the basics,
[01:12:45.300 --> 01:12:47.200]   you could install the fire bunker,
[01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:48.100]   which is a lot cheaper
[01:12:48.100 --> 01:12:50.800]   because it doesn't have an air filtration system.
[01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:55.800]   You bury it in the ground, preferably in a garage floor
[01:12:55.800 --> 01:12:57.600]   or maybe an addition that you're adding to your house,
[01:12:57.600 --> 01:12:59.200]   although you could just put it in the backyard
[01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:01.000]   and put a little shed over it,
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:02.100]   and then make that the place
[01:13:02.100 --> 01:13:03.900]   where you store most of your valuables.
[01:13:03.900 --> 01:13:06.200]   So your fire bunker can just be the place
[01:13:06.200 --> 01:13:08.300]   where you store your guns, your paintings, your jewels,
[01:13:08.300 --> 01:13:10.500]   whatever valuable items that you have.
[01:13:10.500 --> 01:13:12.000]   So it's always protected.
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.400]   And then if there's a fire threatening,
[01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:17.000]   then you go ahead and just move your belongings
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:18.500]   into the more of your belongings,
[01:13:18.500 --> 01:13:19.800]   into the shelter to protect them
[01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:23.500]   from the possibility of fire, and then you leave.
[01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:25.800]   And so I would consider doing something like that
[01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:28.700]   in addition to the RV.
[01:13:28.700 --> 01:13:30.800]   I think that would be, it would be sensible to combine them
[01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:36.200]   if it makes sense for your family financially.
[01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:37.100]   - Yeah, great. Thanks.
[01:13:37.100 --> 01:13:38.700]   I just took a lot of notes on that.
[01:13:38.700 --> 01:13:43.200]   I hadn't even considered a fire shelter for our things,
[01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:46.000]   but we were considering building an addition on our house.
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.600]   So I think like you said, maybe budgeting,
[01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:51.000]   see how much it would cost to put that under there
[01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:52.700]   is a good option.
[01:13:52.700 --> 01:13:53.800]   - That would be ideal.
[01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:55.400]   And that's one of the reasons I wanted to mention it
[01:13:55.400 --> 01:13:59.100]   because if your renovation costs were including an addition,
[01:13:59.100 --> 01:14:00.400]   it would be really ideal.
[01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:03.100]   So there'd be a number of different ways that you could do it.
[01:14:03.100 --> 01:14:05.900]   If you just wanted to protect some small valuables,
[01:14:05.900 --> 01:14:10.300]   then right away you could install an in-ground safe.
[01:14:10.300 --> 01:14:14.500]   A recessed hidden in-ground safe of high quality
[01:14:14.500 --> 01:14:16.700]   is the safest home safe
[01:14:16.700 --> 01:14:19.400]   that you can have to protect your valuables.
[01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:23.800]   It's much better protected from, and that's for two reasons.
[01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:27.000]   So you can, if you install a large safe,
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:28.400]   even a large fire safe,
[01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:32.400]   picture like a big gun safe in your basement somewhere.
[01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:35.700]   The problem with that is it's very hard to conceal
[01:14:35.700 --> 01:14:37.200]   something like that.
[01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:39.700]   And it's exposed to the full heat of the fire.
[01:14:39.700 --> 01:14:41.200]   Less if in the basement, of course,
[01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:43.500]   but it's generally, the fire is all around it,
[01:14:43.500 --> 01:14:44.900]   and so it's exposed.
[01:14:44.900 --> 01:14:48.700]   And it's vulnerable to a thief breaking into it.
[01:14:48.700 --> 01:14:50.900]   You can break into most gun safes,
[01:14:50.900 --> 01:14:53.800]   even of popular brand names,
[01:14:53.800 --> 01:14:55.400]   if you have enough time with a crowbar.
[01:14:55.400 --> 01:14:57.400]   All they do is slow people down.
[01:14:57.400 --> 01:14:59.100]   They don't stop thieves necessarily,
[01:14:59.100 --> 01:15:00.500]   they slow people down.
[01:15:00.500 --> 01:15:03.800]   But the safest option, if you have significant valuables,
[01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:08.200]   personal valuables, is to install an in-ground safe,
[01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:10.000]   and then to do it in an area of the house
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.800]   where it wouldn't be looked for, and to conceal it.
[01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:15.400]   So if in your dining room, if you're installing an addition,
[01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:16.900]   and in your dining room,
[01:15:16.900 --> 01:15:18.900]   you go ahead and install a small safe,
[01:15:18.900 --> 01:15:20.000]   and when I say small, I mean, you know,
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:23.200]   a couple feet deep, something like that,
[01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:26.400]   two feet around, and you install it under a hatch,
[01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:33.400]   and you put a, you know, a curio cabinet or a table over it,
[01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:35.100]   then, and a piece of carpet,
[01:15:35.100 --> 01:15:36.800]   that's the kind of thing that would be very unlikely
[01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:38.400]   to be seen by a thief,
[01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:40.800]   and it's significantly protected from fire.
[01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:43.500]   The big threat to an in-ground safe is flood,
[01:15:43.500 --> 01:15:47.400]   because if water, you know,
[01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:49.700]   firefighters douse your house with water,
[01:15:49.700 --> 01:15:51.000]   everything in it is going to be flooded.
[01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.700]   So you need to be very careful about water damage
[01:15:53.700 --> 01:15:57.600]   for an in-ground safe, but that works really well.
[01:15:57.600 --> 01:16:00.600]   If you step up to a bunker,
[01:16:00.600 --> 01:16:02.500]   then it's ideal to install one at the time
[01:16:02.500 --> 01:16:03.700]   that you do your addition,
[01:16:03.700 --> 01:16:06.800]   and so you just simply excavate underneath it,
[01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:09.500]   underneath the slab, install the bunker,
[01:16:09.500 --> 01:16:11.300]   and then you pour the slab on top of it,
[01:16:11.300 --> 01:16:13.600]   and now you've got the fireproof room,
[01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:17.300]   which can, as I said, be a full-on blast shelter.
[01:16:17.300 --> 01:16:20.900]   You can do a bunker with bomb blast capabilities.
[01:16:20.900 --> 01:16:24.400]   You can do a bunker with radiation capabilities.
[01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:25.700]   I mean, there's all options available,
[01:16:25.700 --> 01:16:27.700]   or you can just put a simple fire storage bunker,
[01:16:27.700 --> 01:16:29.300]   which would be your cheapest option,
[01:16:29.300 --> 01:16:31.000]   but if you're doing an addition,
[01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:34.600]   you definitely should consider doing that at that time.
[01:16:34.600 --> 01:16:37.100]   And then I guess the third thing, which is possible,
[01:16:37.100 --> 01:16:39.500]   is I think it would be simplest to buy
[01:16:39.500 --> 01:16:41.000]   and best for your resale value
[01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.600]   if you purchase a high-quality, commercially-made one,
[01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:45.900]   but you could think through the engineering,
[01:16:45.900 --> 01:16:47.200]   and you guys are engineers,
[01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:48.800]   you could just think through and engineer
[01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:51.300]   a fireproof room in your home
[01:16:51.300 --> 01:16:53.900]   that would give you a place to store things,
[01:16:53.900 --> 01:16:56.400]   and so maybe you just dug out a traditional basement,
[01:16:56.400 --> 01:16:58.900]   but you went ahead and engineered it to be fireproof
[01:16:58.900 --> 01:17:01.300]   with your own engineering prowess.
[01:17:01.300 --> 01:17:02.900]   That could accomplish the same thing,
[01:17:02.900 --> 01:17:05.100]   but without purchasing the commercial options.
[01:17:05.100 --> 01:17:14.700]   - Yeah, that sounds like a fun project in itself.
[01:17:14.700 --> 01:17:17.100]   - All right, Lenore, thank you.
[01:17:17.100 --> 01:17:19.800]   Anything else before I go on to the last caller?
[01:17:19.800 --> 01:17:21.600]   - Nope, that's it. Thank you so much.
[01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:22.400]   - Thank you for calling in,
[01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:23.500]   and I'm glad that you guys are safe,
[01:17:23.500 --> 01:17:24.700]   and I'm glad that your house is safe,
[01:17:24.700 --> 01:17:27.600]   and may it continue in that way.
[01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:29.000]   All right, final call of the day.
[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:30.400]   We move now, Peter, you just got in.
[01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:32.500]   Peter in New York, welcome to the show, sir.
[01:17:32.500 --> 01:17:34.000]   - Hey, Josh, how are you?
[01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:34.800]   - Very well, sir.
[01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:36.900]   - Quick one.
[01:17:36.900 --> 01:17:40.800]   I just took a loan from a whole life insurance policy.
[01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:41.900]   Now what do I do?
[01:17:41.900 --> 01:17:46.300]   - What did you use the money for?
[01:17:46.300 --> 01:17:50.300]   - I used it for a down payment on a house.
[01:17:50.300 --> 01:17:54.600]   - Okay, so what I would do is I would just wait,
[01:17:54.600 --> 01:17:56.300]   secure the house, wait.
[01:17:56.600 --> 01:18:00.000]   If you have other funds,
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:03.300]   and it makes sense to pay it back from other funds, fine.
[01:18:03.300 --> 01:18:05.400]   But what I would do is I'd wait a couple of years,
[01:18:05.400 --> 01:18:08.000]   see if the house appreciates in value.
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:11.200]   If it does, calculate the cost of a refinance,
[01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:12.500]   and if your house appreciates,
[01:18:12.500 --> 01:18:13.900]   and you have additional money,
[01:18:13.900 --> 01:18:15.400]   then I would refinance the house,
[01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:18.000]   and then take the mortgage and pay back the loan.
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:24.000]   Otherwise, depending on your income flows,
[01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000]   if this is the thing that makes sense for you,
[01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:29.100]   is just from your income, set up a repayment plan,
[01:18:29.100 --> 01:18:31.500]   and set out a modest timeline.
[01:18:31.500 --> 01:18:33.600]   You don't have to do it right away,
[01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:36.000]   but at some point over the few years,
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:39.400]   depending on the ratio of loan, income, et cetera,
[01:18:39.400 --> 01:18:42.500]   set up a payment plan to pay it off within a few years,
[01:18:42.500 --> 01:18:44.700]   so you restore the cash values in the policy.
[01:18:44.700 --> 01:18:47.200]   - Okay.
[01:18:47.200 --> 01:18:50.200]   The policy is pretty old, actually,
[01:18:50.200 --> 01:18:53.300]   so the interest rate on it is 8%, interestingly.
[01:18:54.200 --> 01:18:56.800]   - That's not due to the fact that the policy is old.
[01:18:56.800 --> 01:19:00.000]   You can buy a life insurance policy today
[01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.900]   that will have an interest rate of 8%.
[01:19:02.900 --> 01:19:04.800]   What most life insurance companies will do
[01:19:04.800 --> 01:19:06.200]   is they'll offer you the choice
[01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:08.100]   of either a fixed interest rate
[01:19:08.100 --> 01:19:10.000]   or a variable interest rate,
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:11.600]   and you need to choose at the time
[01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:13.100]   that you take the loan out.
[01:19:13.100 --> 01:19:16.100]   So the 8% gives you the knowledge that no matter what,
[01:19:16.100 --> 01:19:18.700]   I'll always be able to take out the 8% loan.
[01:19:18.700 --> 01:19:21.900]   But if you take the variable interest rate loan,
[01:19:21.900 --> 01:19:23.300]   right now the variable interest rates
[01:19:23.300 --> 01:19:25.000]   are far lower than 8%,
[01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.200]   and so you need to call your insurance agent
[01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:31.300]   and see what the current variable interest rate loan rate
[01:19:31.300 --> 01:19:32.900]   is on your policy,
[01:19:32.900 --> 01:19:35.600]   and if it makes sense to decrease it,
[01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:38.400]   which probably does right now,
[01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:40.600]   it's probably 4%, something in that range,
[01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:42.800]   maybe five right now,
[01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:44.700]   depending on the insurance company that you have,
[01:19:44.700 --> 01:19:46.500]   decrease it to the variable interest rate.
[01:19:46.500 --> 01:19:48.300]   That'll drop your interest payments.
[01:19:48.300 --> 01:19:49.900]   The risk of going variable
[01:19:49.900 --> 01:19:53.200]   is that if interest rates adjust significantly,
[01:19:53.200 --> 01:19:54.500]   then you may wind up,
[01:19:54.500 --> 01:19:56.700]   because that's now an indexed rate,
[01:19:56.700 --> 01:19:58.900]   you may wind up paying 10%,
[01:19:58.900 --> 01:20:00.900]   where you could have borrowed at 8%.
[01:20:00.900 --> 01:20:03.400]   So what I do with all my whole life insurance policies
[01:20:03.400 --> 01:20:06.200]   is I always keep it at 8% as a standard,
[01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:09.700]   because that way, if interest rates are,
[01:20:09.700 --> 01:20:10.900]   if we're back in the 1970s,
[01:20:10.900 --> 01:20:12.000]   and interest rates are 15%,
[01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:15.200]   I know I've got a source of an 8% rate
[01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:18.500]   on my whole life insurance policy.
[01:20:18.500 --> 01:20:20.700]   But I would keep in mind,
[01:20:20.700 --> 01:20:21.900]   if I were gonna take a policy loan,
[01:20:21.900 --> 01:20:23.100]   especially a significant one,
[01:20:23.100 --> 01:20:24.300]   like for a home down payment,
[01:20:24.300 --> 01:20:27.300]   is I would probably switch to the variable rate,
[01:20:27.300 --> 01:20:29.700]   which would be lower, especially right now.
[01:20:29.700 --> 01:20:31.300]   So that would be my suggestion.
[01:20:31.300 --> 01:20:33.600]   - Sounds great, thank you.
[01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:35.900]   - Okay, one other suggestion for you to consider.
[01:20:35.900 --> 01:20:38.500]   I don't know, have you taken my credit card course yet
[01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:40.400]   on how to borrow? - Absolutely, yes.
[01:20:40.400 --> 01:20:41.200]   - Okay. - Yep.
[01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:43.300]   - So assuming that you've taken that course
[01:20:43.300 --> 01:20:47.300]   and you've captured the knowledge from that,
[01:20:47.300 --> 01:20:49.000]   if your credit profile,
[01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.500]   once the house is all done, you're in it,
[01:20:51.500 --> 01:20:52.500]   like everything is done, right?
[01:20:52.500 --> 01:20:53.800]   'Cause you wanna be really careful
[01:20:53.800 --> 01:20:55.100]   when you're qualifying for a mortgage
[01:20:55.100 --> 01:20:56.800]   or playing the credit card games.
[01:20:56.800 --> 01:20:59.200]   But once you're in that situation,
[01:20:59.200 --> 01:21:02.900]   what I would do is I would start the process
[01:21:02.900 --> 01:21:05.400]   of moving that whole life insurance loan
[01:21:05.400 --> 01:21:08.400]   onto credit cards at 0%.
[01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:11.200]   For that to make sense,
[01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:13.800]   you need to, I mean, you've taken the course, right?
[01:21:13.800 --> 01:21:16.600]   It needs to be at 0% or something close to 0%.
[01:21:16.600 --> 01:21:18.900]   I'm happy to pay 3% balance transfer fees.
[01:21:18.900 --> 01:21:21.200]   That's cheaper than the loan on my life insurance.
[01:21:21.200 --> 01:21:24.900]   But life insurance and the credit card game
[01:21:24.900 --> 01:21:27.100]   are perfect partners
[01:21:27.100 --> 01:21:29.100]   because you have no variability
[01:21:29.100 --> 01:21:31.200]   in your life insurance cash values, right?
[01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:32.400]   They're only going up.
[01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:34.300]   And so you know the money is there.
[01:21:34.300 --> 01:21:37.300]   And you can put it in and take it out willy-nilly.
[01:21:37.300 --> 01:21:40.800]   And so what I would do in that situation
[01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:43.100]   is I would go ahead,
[01:21:43.100 --> 01:21:46.800]   apply for a swath of new 0% cards
[01:21:46.800 --> 01:21:50.000]   with the goal of, in the ways that I teach in the course,
[01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000]   with the goal of moving the balance
[01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:53.500]   out of the whole life insurance loan
[01:21:53.500 --> 01:21:55.200]   onto the credit cards.
[01:21:55.200 --> 01:21:58.300]   I would extend those credit cards for the maximum period.
[01:21:58.300 --> 01:22:01.300]   And then if I need to pay down the credit cards,
[01:22:01.300 --> 01:22:04.200]   let's say that you've maxed out your borrowing limits,
[01:22:04.200 --> 01:22:05.900]   you got a bunch of 0% cards,
[01:22:05.900 --> 01:22:07.300]   you moved your money over onto there,
[01:22:07.300 --> 01:22:08.900]   but your credit score is starting to go down.
[01:22:08.900 --> 01:22:11.400]   And now you need to surf the balances again.
[01:22:11.400 --> 01:22:14.200]   You just simply take the money back out of the life insurance,
[01:22:14.200 --> 01:22:16.000]   pay down the credit card balances,
[01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.100]   wait for the balances to cycle through,
[01:22:18.100 --> 01:22:22.000]   wait a couple of months for your credit card,
[01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:25.500]   sorry, for your credit score to recover.
[01:22:25.500 --> 01:22:27.000]   Once your credit score recovers,
[01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.500]   apply for a new swath of credit cards.
[01:22:29.500 --> 01:22:31.200]   Once those cards are issued,
[01:22:31.200 --> 01:22:34.400]   use them in the way, you know, in the appropriate way
[01:22:34.400 --> 01:22:36.600]   by the, based upon the terms of the cards,
[01:22:36.600 --> 01:22:38.900]   use them to max out the financing
[01:22:38.900 --> 01:22:41.200]   and then pay down the policy loan again.
[01:22:41.200 --> 01:22:43.500]   And so this is one of the best uses
[01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:45.400]   that I like with whole life insurance.
[01:22:45.400 --> 01:22:48.800]   I think it works awesome in this application.
[01:22:48.800 --> 01:22:51.000]   I use whole life insurance policies
[01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.100]   for the bulk of my emergency fund.
[01:22:53.100 --> 01:22:54.700]   And the reason I do that
[01:22:54.700 --> 01:22:57.900]   is because it gives me all the advantages of having cash,
[01:22:57.900 --> 01:23:00.100]   but it eliminates some of those disadvantages
[01:23:00.100 --> 01:23:02.800]   that I was talking about earlier in the show of a low rate.
[01:23:02.800 --> 01:23:04.600]   And, but the way I would access the money,
[01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:06.600]   could I access the money with a policy loan?
[01:23:06.600 --> 01:23:07.700]   Certainly.
[01:23:07.700 --> 01:23:09.500]   But the first move that I would make
[01:23:09.500 --> 01:23:12.700]   is I would access the money with a 0% credit card loan
[01:23:12.700 --> 01:23:15.300]   before I would access it with the policy loan.
[01:23:15.300 --> 01:23:17.700]   And you can surf this back and forth, back and forth.
[01:23:17.700 --> 01:23:19.100]   You got a hundred thousand dollars of credit card,
[01:23:19.100 --> 01:23:20.900]   of policy values,
[01:23:20.900 --> 01:23:23.200]   and you got a hundred thousand dollars of credit card debt.
[01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:25.800]   Well, because you have no investment variability
[01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:26.800]   with that policy,
[01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:29.300]   with that whole life insurance policy,
[01:23:29.300 --> 01:23:31.200]   because there's no fluctuations,
[01:23:31.200 --> 01:23:33.300]   like there would be if you were doing a 401k loan
[01:23:33.300 --> 01:23:34.800]   or something like in this purpose,
[01:23:34.800 --> 01:23:36.400]   because there's no fluctuations,
[01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:38.500]   you always have that as a source of funding.
[01:23:38.500 --> 01:23:40.900]   And so it always works to, if the credit,
[01:23:40.900 --> 01:23:43.300]   if you come to the end of a 0% cycle
[01:23:43.300 --> 01:23:45.500]   and you can't surf the balance over
[01:23:45.500 --> 01:23:48.800]   to another 0% card with a 0% balance transfer
[01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:52.000]   or a 3% balance transfer or a 5% balance transfer,
[01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000]   then you just simply take the money
[01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:55.600]   from the life insurance policy.
[01:23:55.600 --> 01:23:58.800]   You pay off the credit card that ends that contract.
[01:23:58.800 --> 01:24:01.300]   You wait, as I said, go ahead and get a new one.
[01:24:01.300 --> 01:24:03.600]   So if you've taken that course,
[01:24:03.600 --> 01:24:07.000]   and if you understand the concepts that I taught in there,
[01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.200]   that's what I would do while you're waiting
[01:24:09.200 --> 01:24:11.400]   to either refinance the house
[01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:14.800]   or to either waiting to refinance the house
[01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:17.000]   and take the money from there to pay it down,
[01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.200]   pay it off totally and have no credit card debt
[01:24:19.200 --> 01:24:20.400]   and no policy loan,
[01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:22.200]   or whether you're just paying it down out of income.
[01:24:22.200 --> 01:24:24.600]   I think both of those are really good solutions.
[01:24:24.600 --> 01:24:27.700]   - Great, awesome idea, didn't think of it.
[01:24:27.700 --> 01:24:30.000]   - Thank you all so much for listening to today's show.
[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:33.400]   If you'd like to gain access to next week's Friday Q&A show,
[01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:35.200]   I would encourage you to do that.
[01:24:35.200 --> 01:24:38.300]   Just go to patreon.com/radicalpersonalfinance
[01:24:38.300 --> 01:24:39.500]   and sign up to support the show there.
[01:24:39.500 --> 01:24:41.900]   And as you can see from the content of today's show,
[01:24:41.900 --> 01:24:44.200]   we can talk about all kinds of interesting things.
[01:24:44.200 --> 01:24:45.500]   You gotta give me this,
[01:24:45.500 --> 01:24:48.100]   I may not be the world's best podcast host.
[01:24:48.100 --> 01:24:50.400]   I may not be the easiest person to listen to.
[01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:52.600]   I may actually be too long-winded.
[01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:55.500]   All of those criticisms that are very fair,
[01:24:55.500 --> 01:24:59.100]   I may have strong opinions, but tell me this,
[01:24:59.100 --> 01:25:00.700]   is there any other podcast,
[01:25:00.700 --> 01:25:04.300]   a financial podcast in existence on the marketplace?
[01:25:04.300 --> 01:25:06.800]   Is there any other podcast on the marketplace
[01:25:06.800 --> 01:25:11.200]   that you can begin with a question on contracting
[01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:14.300]   versus being a contractor versus an employee?
[01:25:14.300 --> 01:25:16.500]   You can talk about negative interest rates.
[01:25:16.500 --> 01:25:20.000]   You can talk about buying cars and having cash on hand.
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:23.400]   You can talk about evacuation vehicles from a fire
[01:25:23.400 --> 01:25:25.600]   and bomb shelters in your basement,
[01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:27.300]   and then finish it up with a conversation
[01:25:27.300 --> 01:25:28.900]   on whole life insurance and credit cards.
[01:25:28.900 --> 01:25:31.300]   I mean, you gotta give me that.
[01:25:31.300 --> 01:25:33.000]   I hope that this is the most interesting
[01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.400]   personal finance show that you listen to.
[01:25:35.400 --> 01:25:37.500]   So in addition to supporting show on Patreon,
[01:25:37.500 --> 01:25:39.600]   in addition to buying my wonderful products,
[01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:42.000]   which are available at radicalpersonalfinance.com/store,
[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:43.600]   including the course called
[01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:44.600]   How to Borrow Money Safely
[01:25:44.600 --> 01:25:46.500]   and Never Pay Interest Using Credit Cards,
[01:25:46.500 --> 01:25:47.700]   which I have said again and again,
[01:25:47.700 --> 01:25:49.000]   if you have a credit card
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.100]   or if you think you will ever have a credit card,
[01:25:51.100 --> 01:25:52.200]   or if you've ever had a credit card,
[01:25:52.200 --> 01:25:53.400]   you need to buy my course,
[01:25:53.400 --> 01:25:56.500]   because I just heard from the telephone call there with Peter.
[01:25:56.500 --> 01:25:59.200]   It can be a phenomenally useful system.
[01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:02.200]   You heard everything I said there.
[01:26:02.200 --> 01:26:05.200]   It's a very, very good system.
[01:26:05.200 --> 01:26:06.500]   What I just described.
[01:26:06.500 --> 01:26:09.600]   But in addition to all of those things,
[01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:11.700]   it's been a while since I've asked for reviews.
[01:26:11.700 --> 01:26:12.900]   If you would take a moment
[01:26:12.900 --> 01:26:17.800]   and just simply go to whatever platform that you use
[01:26:17.800 --> 01:26:20.500]   to listen to this podcast on
[01:26:20.500 --> 01:26:22.900]   and simply review the show,
[01:26:22.900 --> 01:26:23.900]   that would be awesome.
[01:26:23.900 --> 01:26:25.600]   So if you're listening on iTunes,
[01:26:25.600 --> 01:26:28.300]   go to iTunes and leave a review on iTunes.
[01:26:28.300 --> 01:26:30.800]   If you listen on Spotify, leave a review on Spotify.
[01:26:30.800 --> 01:26:32.300]   Say whatever you want.
[01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:35.900]   But I would be grateful if you would do that.
[01:26:35.900 --> 01:26:36.700]   Leave a review now.
[01:26:36.700 --> 01:26:39.400]   It takes you 30 seconds to click the stars
[01:26:39.400 --> 01:26:40.600]   and write one sentence saying,
[01:26:40.600 --> 01:26:43.100]   "Joshua is the bomb."
[01:26:43.100 --> 01:26:44.400]   I'll take a five star.
[01:26:44.400 --> 01:26:45.100]   And have a great weekend.
[01:26:45.100 --> 01:26:46.300]   We'll be back with you guys soon.
