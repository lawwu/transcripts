[00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.640]   Capital One might not be the first issuer you think of when it comes to premium rewards,
[00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.160]   but over the last few years, they've made major moves, and if you were going to carry
[00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.160]   just one card to earn points and miles, they might just have my top pick.
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.800]   From flexible points and elevated travel perks to unique benefits that most people overlook,
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.120]   Capital One has quietly become one of the most rewarding programs out there.
[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.280]   In today's deep dive, I'll walk through their full card lineup, highlight the hidden perks,
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.960]   explain how their point system works, and break down everything you need to know to
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.800]   decide if Capital One should have a spot in your wallet. I'm Chris Hutchins.

[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.560]   All right, so far we've done these issuer deep dives for credit cards on Citi and Amex,
[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.120]   and today I want to continue with Capital One because there is so much to get excited about,
[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.560]   both on the personal and business side. Now, I only got my first Capital One card a few years ago when
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:02.080]   the Venture X card launched, and since then we've added a few more cards in our household and built
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:07.840]   up a pretty good stash of Capital One miles, but despite that short tenure, for this episode today,
[00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:13.120]   I've done dozens of hours of research, read hundreds of pages about Capital One on their site and other
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:18.480]   sites, so we've got a lot to cover and we're going to go deep. First, I want to run through the entire
[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:24.480]   Capital One card lineup, giving every card a rating as we go, and then I want to talk about some of the cool
[00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:30.000]   benefits and perks you get from just being a Capital One customer. Everything from free drinks, co-working
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.200]   spaces, exclusive reservations, to a few things I didn't even know about until I started doing this
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:41.440]   research. Then I want to cover the entire Capital One miles ecosystem, how it works, how it's a great
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:47.440]   program for families, especially larger ones, and then I'm going to cover all the rules and other quirks
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:53.280]   of applying for cards, earning welcome bonuses, getting approved, and more. Finally, I'll share a bit of a
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:59.200]   comparison of Capital One cards, their miles, and how that compares with other major issuers and the
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.000]   different card combos you can have. There is a lot to cover and whether you're new to Capital One, have
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.480]   never had one of their cards, or have been a customer for decades, I'm confident you're going to learn
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:13.280]   something today that could help you level up your points and miles game. Also, keep in mind there's
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.240]   timestamps in the show notes if you want to skip around or find links to anything we discuss, and if you're
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:24.960]   interested in any of these cards, we have links to all of them on the website at allthehacks.com/cards.
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:30.160]   Using those links is a huge way to support the show and all the work we do, so thank you so much
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.800]   in advance for using them for the next time you're looking at a card. Okay, if you look at the Capital One
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.840]   website, you can see that there's over 30 different cards, but we're going to break them down into three
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.560]   major buckets. We're going to first focus on miles cards, then we're going to talk about cashback, and then we'll
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.360]   talk about some of the co-brand cards they have that at least make sense to cover in this episode.
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:55.600]   Keep in mind that all this information is only as good as of August 13th, 2025 when I'm recording it,
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.160]   but things in this space don't change that fast, so it will probably be pretty relevant whenever you're
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.600]   listening to this, especially things about the ecosystem. So let's start with miles cards, and the
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:11.760]   first one I want to start with is the Capital One Venture card. This card earns 2x miles on every purchase,
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.560]   and that's a pretty rare thing. There aren't a lot of cards, if any, other than Capital One, where you
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:23.920]   can earn 2x transferable miles on all purchases without needing to have another card in that ecosystem.
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:30.240]   There is the Blue Business Plus business card at Amex, which will give you that, but only on up to
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:37.360]   $50,000 of spend a year. Almost every other card that earns 2% back or 2x points earns it because it's
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.160]   paired with another card that has transferable points. So right out the gate, the Venture card
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:48.720]   is a really unique card and something that I think adds a ton of value to anyone who just wants a card
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.920]   that's super straightforward and simple that earns 2x miles on every purchase. Right now, it also has a
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:04:00.800]   great welcome bonus of 75,000 miles, and that's after spending $4,000 in the first three months, and it comes
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:07.680]   with a $95 annual fee and no foreign transaction fees. It has a few benefits, not as many as the
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:13.920]   next card we'll talk about, but you do get status with Hertz, you do get a credit for TSA Pre or Global
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:20.080]   Entry, and then you do get access to Capital One Lounges, but you have to pay for it. So let's look at
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:24.960]   this card on the tier list, which is something I'll do for all cards, and I'm going to put this card at
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:30.880]   the A tier. Now, right out the gate, you've got a card that earns 2x transferable points on all purchases.
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.600]   That's awesome. The benefits are a little lacking. There's not a lot of other things, but you do get to
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:41.120]   transfer those points to over 15 different transfer partners of airlines and hotels, which is amazing.
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.600]   By the way, if you're not following along on YouTube, you can find a link to the tier list in
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:50.800]   the show notes and take a look at that picture as we're talking about this. So venture card, great.
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:56.800]   There's a couple variations of it, so I'm going to run through those also. There's the Venture One card,
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:03.680]   which is very similar in its name, in its look, except instead of earning 2x miles on everything,
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:10.480]   it earns 1.25x miles on everything. So way lower earning rate, not that competitive. The signup bonus
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:17.680]   is also a lot smaller, 20,000 points on $500 spend in three months, but it does come with a 0% intro APR
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:25.040]   for 15 months and recently has been added a $100 Capital One travel credit. Now, that's a pretty
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:31.680]   good signup bonus and offer and 0% intro APR for a card with no annual fee and no foreign transaction fees,
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:39.600]   but it's 1.25 miles on everything, not 2x like you would see with a venture card. It does also have
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:45.760]   that elevated 5x miles on hotels and rental cars when you book through Capital One travel, but given
[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:52.560]   that 1.25 miles is just not as competitive as most cards out there, I'm going to put it down at B tier.
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:57.680]   Now, it's not a terrible earning rate. There are tons of people I meet who are using cards that earn just
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:03.840]   1x miles or points for their everything else purchases and with no annual fee, no foreign
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:09.360]   transaction fees. It's not a terrible card, but it's certainly not elevating itself to the S tier or the
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:15.120]   A tier. Now, there's another card called the Venture One card for good credit and Capital One does this
[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:19.680]   thing sometimes where there's a version of a card and then there's a version for good credit and a version
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:25.120]   for students and even in some cases a version for fair credit. And you got to keep in mind that the cards
[00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.640]   actually look very similar. So you definitely want to make sure you're clicking the right one when
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:33.200]   you're looking around, but the features and the benefits change a little bit. So the Venture One
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:39.280]   rewards card for good credit is very similar to the Venture One card, except there's no signup bonus,
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:45.680]   there's no 0% intro APR, and there's no Capital One travel credit offer. So still that $0 annual fee,
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:51.040]   zero foreign transaction fee. For the purpose of the tier list in this episode, I'm not going to rank all of
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:56.320]   the for good credit for students versions of the cards. I'm just going to stick to the main cards as
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:02.480]   we go through. So next, let's talk about my first card with Capital One, which is the Venture X card.
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:07.520]   Now, this card was a big splash. Tons of marketing went into it. When they originally launched it,
[00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:12.800]   it had a welcome offer of 100,000 miles, which I know a lot of people were excited about. Right now,
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:20.160]   the welcome offer is 75,000 miles after spending $4,000 in three months from account opening. So
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:25.040]   same welcome offer you would get with the Venture card. The main difference between the Venture card
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:30.880]   and the Venture X card is all around the benefits you get. So you're still getting 2x miles on every
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:36.000]   purchase. But if you're spending in the Capital One travel portal, now you're going to get 10x miles on
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:42.160]   hotels and rental cars, and 5x miles on airfare and vacation rentals. It's probably worth pausing
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:47.520]   for a second to talk a little bit about travel portals. In general, the reason that I don't love
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:54.080]   travel portals is that when you book a flight, or you book a hotel room, often the airline or the hotel
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:08:00.320]   group is not going to allow you to directly manage those reservations with them. And they're going to kick
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:04.640]   you back and say, hey, if you need to change your flight, go to Capital One travel. Hey, if you need to
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:09.520]   cancel your hotel, go to Capital One travel. So on one hand, that's a little bit frustrating. On the
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:14.640]   other hand, if you can earn 10x miles on a rental car, or 5x miles on a flight, that can be really
[00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:19.520]   compelling. And so I would just keep in mind what type of trip you're taking, how likely it is that
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:25.520]   it's going to need to be changed. On the hotel front, often you're not going to earn any points or elite
[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:31.440]   status with the hotel chain if you're booking a hotel through a travel portal. And so in that case,
[00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:35.360]   if I were booking something with Hyatt, where I'm trying to build up status, I probably wouldn't
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:39.440]   book it in a travel portal. That said, if I was booking a boutique hotel that wasn't any part of
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:45.600]   a travel program, and I also found the best rate in a travel portal, I'm not going to pay more for it,
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:50.640]   I would totally have no issue booking for 10x miles in the Capital One travel portal, which can make this
[00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:56.160]   a great card for travel, as long as you're willing to understand those differences. If you need to change a
[00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:01.120]   flight in the Capital One travel portal, it's not like you can't do it, you can go in and change it.
[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:06.400]   And in some cases, airlines will let you take over that reservation and manage it through their site.
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:11.760]   But I can just say that sometimes there are some issues. If you go search around for why not to use
[00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:16.480]   a travel portal, you'll find some articles about that. I'll try to find one and link it in the show notes.
[00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:21.200]   It's not a don't do it. I've done it plenty of times. It's just to understand what you're getting
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:28.720]   into. And so without some added benefit, which by the way, 10x miles or 5x miles or using a $300
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:33.760]   travel credit are all great benefits and reasons to do it. But you just want to understand that before
[00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:40.320]   you're doing it. This episode is brought to you by Superhuman, which is absolutely one of my top apps.
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:46.080]   It's on my dock on the phone. It's my first pin tab on my browser, and I've used it for years.

[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:56.400]   rent every month without earning anything in return, let me introduce you to Built, the rewards program
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:01.840]   designed for renters who want to earn my favorite transferable points for their largest monthly expense,
[00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:07.760]   their rent. Let me explain. By paying rent through Built, you can earn flexible points that can be redeemed
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:13.440]   towards hundreds of hotels and airlines, a future rent payment, your next Lyft ride, and more. But it doesn't
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:18.480]   stop there. Built is about making your entire neighborhood more rewarding. You can dine out at your
[00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:24.320]   favorite local restaurants and earn additional points, get VIP treatment at certain fitness studios, and enjoy
[00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:30.720]   exclusive experiences just for Built members every month. Built is turning a monthly expense into an
[00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:36.240]   opportunity to earn rewards and discover the best that your neighborhood has to offer. Your rent is
[00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:41.760]   finally working for you. Earn points on rent and around your neighborhood wherever you call home by going
[00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:51.120]   to allthehacks.com/built. That's allthehacks.com/built, B-I-L-T. Make sure to use our URL so they know we sent you.
[00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:56.720]   Another difference of this card and the Venture Card is that it has a $395 annual fee. It still has no
[00:11:56.720 --> 00:12:00.960]   foreign transaction fees, but it has a ton of benefits. So let's run through those because I think those
[00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:06.480]   benefits are what really make this card stand out. So first off, on your anniversary for the card, you get
[00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:12.160]   10,000 miles, which if you value Capital One miles like the Points Guy does at 1.85 cents,
[00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:19.760]   already that's $185 value for those miles. You also get a $300 travel credit you can use in Capital One
[00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:26.000]   Travel. It's very easy to use. You go look to book a flight and all of a sudden $300 gets taken off that
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.760]   flight and you save $300. So if you're going to spend more than $300 on travel, I've found that travel
[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:38.720]   credit really, really easy to use. Even if you want to value those 10,000 miles just at 1 cent per mile,
[00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:43.920]   you're looking at $100 value from the miles, $300 value from the travel credit for an annual fee of
[00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:51.760]   $395. You actually come out $5 a head. So for me, this is a great premium card because you're not
[00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:57.200]   stuck trying to make 20 different types of coupons and monthly discounts work. You have one annual travel
[00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:02.320]   credit and 10,000 miles a year to cover it. That said, there are other benefits, but just getting
[00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:07.280]   enough benefits to make up for the annual fee is way easier for this card than a lot of other premium
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:13.360]   travel cards. You also get that credit every, I think, four years for TSA Pre and Global Entry.
[00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:19.120]   And then the other big thing is you get access to Capital One's Lounge Network. Now, unfortunately,
[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:24.080]   this year in 2025, that access has changed a bit. So let me explain what that means.
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:29.280]   There are two types of access you get. You get access to Priority Pass, which is a lounge network
[00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:35.520]   of over 1,000 lounges around the world. And you get access to Capital One's own lounges. Now, right now,
[00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:42.000]   I think they have somewhere around seven lounges, Denver, Dallas, both airports in DC, Las Vegas.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.360]   And I think LaGuardia and JFK are coming soon, or maybe they're already there. But the way the access
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:53.360]   works is that you used to get two guests for free or one guest for their landing lounges, which right
[00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:59.920]   now are in Washington, Reagan, and LaGuardia in New York. But starting February, 2026, that changes and
[00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:05.600]   guests are no longer free with a couple of caveats. So one, this card has no fee for authorized users.
[00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:10.240]   So you can add an authorized user and they can use this card as well. However, those authorized users
[00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:18.000]   do not get lounge access unless you pay $125 a year. And you can do that for up to four authorized users.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:24.160]   So without guest privileges next year, that means that in order to have your partner get into a lounge,
[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:29.840]   you need to add them as an authorized user. Now, if you use lounges enough, maybe that $125 fee works.
[00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:34.320]   But if you have children and you're hoping to get them into lounges, that's not really a great option
[00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:39.120]   because I believe with Capital One, children need to be over 13 to be authorized users.
[00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:45.040]   So you can either pay for that lounge access, which for children is $25 or adults is $45.
[00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:53.680]   Or if you spend $75,000 a year on the card, then you or any authorized users now inherit free guest
[00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:59.760]   access of up to two guests for Capital One lounges and then one guest for the Capital One landing
[00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:03.760]   lounges. I believe the reason those lounges are different is that the landing lounges are a little
[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:08.400]   more elevated, a little better food, and they want to keep them a little bit smaller in terms of number
[00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:12.960]   of guests that come into those lounges. In general, anyone that's been in lounges the last few years
[00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:17.440]   knows that it seems like they're always getting more and more crowded. So I understand that Capital One
[00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:23.040]   wanted to add these restrictions, but having a premium card with no guest access unless you pay
[00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:29.440]   or spend a lot on the card does feel a little bit limiting. But unlike other cards where you might
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:34.320]   have to spend money to unlock a privilege like guesting into a lounge, at least this is a card
[00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:39.680]   where you're earning 2x miles on all your spending. So if you did have large tax payments where those fees
[00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:45.120]   are actually under 2%, it might actually make sense to put those tax payments on a card where you could
[00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:51.040]   earn 2x miles as opposed to a lot of other cards where you might only earn 1x miles on a tax payment.
[00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:55.520]   So it might actually be more feasible to use this card to meet that $7,500 spend
[00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:59.760]   if you spend a lot in a year. If you don't, I think it's going to be tough to use this card
[00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:04.240]   as your primary lounge card, and there's probably other cards to look at if that's important to you.
[00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:09.520]   Now keep in mind, if you do meet that $75,000 of spend to unlock guest access,
[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:14.880]   you get that unlocked access for the year you earn it, the following year, and until the end of January
[00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:19.840]   the next year. So that's the Capital One lounges. On the priority pass side,
[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:24.880]   it's no restaurant access, it's no guest access, even if you spend money, I don't think you unlock
[00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:29.840]   any guest access there as well. So I do love the priority pass network, but I would look at another
[00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:34.480]   card if you're looking for lounge access for a family, because this one is a little bit limiting.
[00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:39.760]   A few other benefits, you do get Hertz President Circle status, and then they do have on the Capital One
[00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:45.520]   travel portal, if you have the Venture X card, you get access to their premier lifestyle hotel collection.
[00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:51.760]   So it's elevated benefits, elevated perks at luxury hotels. I think we have more hotels in
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:57.280]   our luxury hotel program. If you go to hotels.allthehacks.com, you can see that and get access to
[00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:03.280]   all kinds of perks with hotels. The password for that site is the word perks. And if you're booking
[00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:08.080]   any luxury hotel, you'll almost always get a property credit, free breakfast, early check-in,
[00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:12.880]   late checkout, both subject to availability and upgrades subject to availability. So if you're
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:18.560]   booking a luxury hotel, definitely check that site out. But if you do have access to your Capital One
[00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:23.280]   card and you want to use that Capital One travel credit, you can use it at their premier and lifestyle
[00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:29.120]   hotel collection as well. Now, if I look at the tier list for the Venture X card, I think this one has to go in
[00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:35.200]   the S tier. It is a 2x miles on everything card, which is rare, but also it's a card where you do
[00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:40.800]   get lounge access, you do get some premium coverages and protections, all for an annual fee that isn't
[00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:48.480]   the six, seven, $800 annual fee a lot of similar cards are charging now. It's only $395 and the travel
[00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:55.520]   credit and annual 10,000 miles makes it really much easier to justify in my opinion. So I think the Venture X is
[00:17:55.520 --> 00:18:00.720]   definitely an S tier card. It is our all other purchases card in our household. We're using it
[00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:06.160]   anytime we want to earn miles on a purchase, but we don't have an elevated bonus for earning three,
[00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:11.680]   four or five miles per dollar. Next, I want to talk about the Venture X business card, and it's very,
[00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:17.360]   very similar to the Venture X card, so I won't spend too much time on it. But if you're asking why am I
[00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:23.040]   even including business cards, I want to flag that I think most people don't realize that they probably are
[00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:28.240]   closer to having a business than they thought. In the past, I've done consulting work, sold stuff on
[00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:33.840]   eBay, had a startup that maybe wasn't even profitable yet, but I was getting going. I've had a blog.
[00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:40.400]   There are a lot of different things, Etsy selling, walking dogs, babysitting that could classify as a
[00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:45.120]   business. That doesn't mean you need an LLC to open up a business credit card. You could do it as a
[00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:50.480]   sole proprietor under your own social security number without a business name. So there's a lot of people out
[00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:55.840]   there who I think don't realize they have a business or they have themselves that could very
[00:18:55.840 --> 00:19:01.040]   easily and justifiably be categorized as a business. I'll link to a couple articles if you want to go
[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:05.520]   read more, but I've been surprised at people that didn't actually realize they had a business and were
[00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:10.720]   eligible to open a business credit card. And so that held them back from what sets apart some business
[00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:16.000]   cards, which is really, really incredible welcome offers. So the biggest thing that sets aside the
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:21.280]   VentureX business from the VentureX card is that welcome offer. So right now, that welcome offer is
[00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:27.920]   150,000 points on $30,000 spend in three months. And I'll come back to why I think that welcome offer
[00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:33.440]   is so compelling, but I'll just quickly run through the benefits. Same annual fee of $395, no foreign
[00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:39.600]   transaction fees, same earnings multiples as the VentureX card. In fact, almost everything is the same,
[00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:46.560]   except on the lounge access. This card does get you two guests at priority pass lounges. So it's
[00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:51.600]   slightly better than the personal VentureX card. But I believe, and I couldn't find evidence for this on
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:56.560]   the website, that it doesn't offer Hertz president circle status for cardholders. Now, one unique thing
[00:19:56.560 --> 00:20:01.040]   about the VentureX business card that sets it aside from all the other cards is that it is not actually a
[00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:05.600]   credit card. It is a charge card, meaning you do need to pay that balance off in full at the end of each
[00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:10.560]   month. And you also don't have a preset spending limit, which means potentially for business owners,
[00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:16.400]   this card could be used to spend a lot more. And as you spend more and more, the limit will go up and
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:21.440]   up, similar to a lot of Amex charge cards. So for someone with a business who's spending a lot of money
[00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:28.400]   and doesn't want to be kind of hampered by a 10, 20, $30,000 limit, this could be a really good option.
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:33.360]   Now, given that this card has the highest welcome offer for Capital One Miles, I just want to dig in a
[00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:38.080]   little bit and share how I think about some of these offers, because it does require a large
[00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:43.600]   amount of spend, $30,000 in the first three months. So first off, if you look at the value of Capital One
[00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:49.520]   Miles, you can go to the points guy, they have a valuation series, they're using 1.85 cents. And part
[00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:53.520]   of the reason is that Capital One has a ton of amazing transfer partners, and I'll talk about that
[00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:58.480]   later in this episode. And because you have the flexibility to move those points to different hotels and
[00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:04.160]   airlines, there's so many different options for how you can make those points earn outsized value.
[00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:14.400]   So at 1.85 cents, earning 150,000 miles could be worth $2,775. However, most cards that have huge
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:19.200]   signup bonuses like that, think the Chase Sapphire Reserve Business, the Amex Business Platinum,
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:25.600]   you will be earning 1x on all other categories that aren't earning bonuses. So you're probably going
[00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:32.560]   to earn way less points on that spend to hit that bonus than you would with the VentureX business card.
[00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:37.920]   Here you're earning 2x miles. So while you do have to spend $30,000 in those first three months,
[00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:45.200]   you get another 60,000 miles from that spend, which is 210,000 miles total after you spend that $30,000.
[00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:52.800]   So if those miles are worth 1.85 cents, that is a total welcome offer return of $3,885,
[00:21:52.800 --> 00:22:00.640]   which is effectively about 12.95% back on that $30,000 of spend. And even if you wanted to ratchet
[00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:06.160]   that back and say, I don't want to use 1.85 cents, I just want to pretend these miles are worth 1 cent,
[00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:14.560]   that's still a $2,100 value welcome bonus, which is 7% back on your $30,000 of spend. So if you have
[00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:21.440]   $30,000 to spend in the next three months, this is a card that would get you at a minimum 7% back on that
[00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:26.720]   spend if you hit the full spend. But if you value those points, like many other people do in this
[00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:32.800]   industry, it could be close to $4,000 or even more dollars on that welcome bonus. And that also
[00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:38.960]   doesn't factor in the fact that those other two cards that often have 200,000, 250,000 point welcome
[00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:47.200]   bonuses have fees of $695, $795 with some complicated credits to be able to reduce those fees and get that
[00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:54.960]   value back. Whereas the VentureX business is a $395 fee with, in my opinion, an easy $300 travel credit
[00:22:54.960 --> 00:23:01.200]   and 10,000 miles on your account anniversary. So way easier to make that annual fee effectively
[00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:06.800]   down to zero. So big fan of the VentureX business, I'm not sure how long this elevated offer is going
[00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:11.520]   to last. But if you want to check it out, you can go to allthehacks.com/cards. It's at the top,
[00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:16.000]   because it's one of the best bonuses right now. So it's probably no surprise that I would be putting
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.960]   the VentureX business card in the S tier. It's just like the VentureX personal, except I think it has a
[00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:26.640]   better welcome offer, and you get a little better lounge access, all for the trade-off of no Hertz
[00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:32.720]   President Circle status. So definitely an S tier card. Next on the list is the Spark Miles cards.
[00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:37.440]   Now, I have a bit of a gripe with Capital One for the way they name cards. So they have a Spark Miles
[00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:43.200]   card, which is effectively a business card that also earns 2x miles. I'm not sure why they don't call it the
[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:48.400]   VentureBusiness card. It seems like you have Venture and VentureX, and then you have VentureX
[00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:53.440]   Business and Spark Miles, which is kind of effectively the business version of the VentureCard.
[00:23:53.440 --> 00:24:00.320]   It also earns 2x miles on every purchase. It also, like the VentureCard, earns 5x miles on hotels and
[00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:04.640]   rental cars and Capital One travel. But after that, there are some changes. So first off, the welcome
[00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:10.960]   bonus on this card is 50,000 miles on $4,500 spend in the first three months. It has the same annual fee as
[00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:15.280]   the VentureCard of $95. But in your first year, it's actually waived. So there is no annual fee.
[00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:20.640]   No foreign transaction fees on the card. You do get free employee cards. You do get reimbursed
[00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:25.120]   on Global Entry and TSA PreCheck and access to that Premier and Lifestyle Hotel Collection.
[00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:30.480]   But otherwise, there aren't a lot of other benefits. Now, there is one variation of the Spark Miles card,
[00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:35.440]   and that's the Spark Miles Select. It has the same signup bonus, but no annual fee. And instead of
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:40.560]   earning 2x miles on every purchase, it earns 1.5x miles on every purchase.
[00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:45.520]   No TSA Pre and Global Entry credit as well. So those are the two Spark Miles cards on the
[00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:50.880]   business side. That 2x miles card, I'm going to put up in the S tier as well. If you're asking why
[00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:57.600]   the Spark Miles 2x card is in the S tier and the VentureCard is not, I think the main thing for me
[00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:02.400]   is that there are just so many consumer cards that can reward you on tons of different categories.
[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:07.840]   Whereas on the business side, there are not a lot of business cards that get you uncapped 2x on
[00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:14.560]   everything. And a lot of business purchases don't fall into bonus categories on cards. A lot of
[00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:19.920]   business services, lots of spending in places that aren't restaurants and dining and travel.
[00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:26.640]   So that's why I put this in the S tier, because as a business owner, being able to get 2x transferable
[00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:32.320]   miles on all purchases is just really incredible and differentiated amongst a lot of other cards.
[00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:38.800]   That said, if I'm looking at the Spark Business 1.5x miles card, I'm putting that down in the B tier,
[00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:45.120]   because getting 1.5x is pretty comparable to a lot of other options. Maybe there aren't that many
[00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:51.440]   business cards, like there are personal cards that earn 1.5x or 1.5% back, but that definitely doesn't
[00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:53.040]   feel as differentiated.
[00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:57.760]   So that's Capital One's miles cards. Let's talk about Capital One's cashback cards.
[00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:04.880]   Though, technically, if you have a Capital One miles card, then if you have a cashback card, you can
[00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:11.760]   transfer the cashback you earn at a rate of one penny to one point to your rewards balance on your miles
[00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:17.680]   earning card. So I have a Capital One cashback business card, the Spark Cash Plus. And if I earned
[00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:26.160]   $100 of cashback, I can transfer that to be 10,000 miles in my personal VentureX card balance. So yes,
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:30.640]   these are all cashback cards if you have them on your own. If you pair them with any of the Venture or
[00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:36.800]   Spark Miles cards, you can turn them into miles, which makes them even more valuable in my opinion.
[00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:40.800]   So the first one we're going to talk about is a Capital One Saver Rewards card. This is a card that
[00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:48.880]   earns 3% back on grocery, dining, entertainment, and streaming. So this is Capital One's consumer card
[00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:54.400]   to reward you elevated amounts on your regular consumer spending. I really like this card.
[00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:58.640]   I have other cards that hit these categories, but if I were going to go all in on the Capital One
[00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:03.040]   ecosystem, which we'll talk about later, I would absolutely be getting this card and pairing it with
[00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:09.440]   a VentureX. It also earns 5% back on hotels and rental cars, and then it earns 1% back on all other
[00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:15.600]   purchases. It has no foreign transaction fees, has no annual fee. Right now, the welcome bonus is only $200
[00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:24.240]   on $500 spend in three months, but you do get a 0% intro APR for 15 months, and as of a few days ago,
[00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:30.720]   a $100 Capital One travel credit. So not the best welcome offer in terms of dollars, or if you took
[00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:37.280]   those $200 and turned them into miles, it would be 20,000 miles. But 0% intro APR is interesting,
[00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:41.920]   a free travel credit is interesting, but the elevated earnings are, I think, what sets this card apart.
[00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:47.600]   There are some variations of this. There is the for good credit version, which is the same except
[00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:53.520]   there's no welcome offer, and there's no 0% intro APR. Then there is a student version of the card with
[00:27:53.520 --> 00:28:00.080]   a lower welcome offer of only $100 on $300 spend in three months. Also doesn't have the 0% intro APR,
[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:05.040]   but you do need to be enrolled, admitted, or planning to enroll in the next three months at an accredited
[00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:09.920]   university, community college, or other higher education institution. So those are the three
[00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:14.960]   variations. Like I said, I'm only going to review the primary personal one, and I'm going to put this in
[00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:20.640]   the A tier. This is a card I really like. While the welcome offer isn't as compelling as a lot of other
[00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:27.600]   cards out there, I do think being able to get 3% back or 3x miles if you pair it with a miles card
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:33.760]   on grocery, dining, entertainment, and streaming covers a ton of the categories that are both competitive
[00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:38.960]   with other cards and areas where I think a lot of people spend money. So love this card, even though I
[00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:44.960]   don't have it. There used to be a saver one version of this card that went up to 4% back on groceries.
[00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:51.040]   And I know there's been some surveys going out from Capital One about maybe an elevated kind of venture
[00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:57.200]   X version, maybe the saver X card, but it hasn't come out yet. There's no details out there. Who knows if
[00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:03.600]   it ever will. This episode is brought to you by Trust and Will. It is so easy to overcomplicate
[00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:09.280]   simple tasks, especially for me when I love doing all the research, but some things don't always need
[00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:15.440]   to be complicated and put off like creating a will or trust. So check out Trust and Will because they

[00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:45.360]   steps, we had a solid plan in place to protect our family and we were able to customize it to match all our
[00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:50.160]   nuanced preferences about what happens to our savings, who's going to be the guardian for our kids, and
[00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:55.840]   much more. I can't tell you how much peace of mind we have knowing that all of this is taken care of and
[00:29:55.840 --> 00:30:02.480]   it was so easy to update it online after we had our second child. So let Trust and Will uncomplicate the

[00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:23.760]   This episode is brought to you by Element. If you've listened to this show, you know I'm always
[00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:29.040]   searching for ways to optimize my life and Element is genuinely one of the simplest, most impactful
[00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:35.200]   upgrades I've made. I drink Element almost every day and bring it with me every time I travel. Here's why:
[00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:39.920]   Staying hydrated isn't just about drinking water. Electrolyte imbalances can lead to headaches,
[00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:45.520]   fatigue, brain fog, poor sleep, and most electrolyte drinks out there are packed with sugar and other
[00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:51.680]   dodgy ingredients. But Element is different. It's zero sugar, zero artificial junk, just a perfectly
[00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:57.600]   balanced mix of electrolytes and sodium that is backed by science and tastes great. Since I started
[00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:01.680]   drinking Element, I've noticed clearer focus throughout the day, better sleep at night, and I
[00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:07.920]   am more energized for workouts and recovery. Honestly, it is hard to imagine going back. So whether you're an
[00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:13.200]   athlete or just someone like me trying to get the most out of every day, you've got to try Element,
[00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:17.760]   and they're so confident you'll love it that they offer no questions asked refunds so you can try it
[00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:23.920]   risk-free. And for All The Hacks listeners, you can get a free eight-count sample pack of Element's most
[00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:31.920]   popular drink mix flavors with any purchase at allthehacks.com/elementlmnt. Find your favorite
[00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:37.200]   Element flavor or share with a friend. That's allthehacks.com/elementlmnt.
[00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:42.480]   Okay, so the next cashback card is the Quicksilver card. Samuel L. Jackson's been talking about
[00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:47.920]   this card for years. You've probably seen ads. It is a one and a half percent cashback card on all your
[00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:53.840]   purchases. Right now, the welcome offer is $200 on $500 spend in three months, but you do also get a
[00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:59.120]   zero percent intro APR for 15 months and $100 Capital One travel credit. No annual fee, no foreign
[00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:04.480]   transaction fees, but the note says you do need excellent credit to get this card. There are some variations of
[00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:11.040]   this. So there is the Quicksilver for good credit version, which is the same card, but no welcome
[00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:16.080]   offer and no zero percent intro APR. And then there is the for student version of this card, which has
[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:21.600]   similar requirements to the saver card for students, also no intro APR, but it does have a small welcome
[00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:28.480]   offer of $100 on $300 spend in three months. Then there is the Quicksilver One card, which you'd think
[00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:34.000]   might be different given that there was a saver and a saver one card and they had different earnings. No,
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:40.800]   this one's the same earnings, no welcome offer, no intro APR, but this one actually has a $39 annual fee.
[00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:45.280]   They do say they do credit line reviews, but it says this is for fair credit. Still, again,
[00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:51.200]   with Capital One and the naming, I'm always confused. Instead of calling this the for fair credit version,
[00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:56.400]   they give it a different name called Quicksilver One. So I'll treat it like a separate card, but it's not
[00:32:56.400 --> 00:33:01.360]   really that different. And then there's also a Quicksilver secured card, which actually isn't a credit card,
[00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:06.480]   that has no welcome offer, no intro APR, no annual fee, but you have to make a refundable deposit.
[00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:10.720]   So when I look at these cards, I think about the Quicksilver card. I'm putting that at the C tier.
[00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:15.360]   And by the way, this tier list goes from S at the top all the way down to D tier. Think of it as a
[00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:21.440]   grading system with S for, I don't know, star, special. I don't actually know the origin of the S.
[00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:25.600]   And putting a card out there like the Quicksilver card that earns one and a half percent on everything,
[00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:31.920]   it's just not that compelling. It's a C tier card for me. But putting it out there with a annual fee,
[00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:37.040]   the Quicksilver One card, obviously the card is not targeting someone who could be eligible for these
[00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:42.240]   other cards. But even the secured version of this card has no annual fee and the same earnings. So I
[00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:46.800]   think the Capital One Quicksilver One card is a D tier card for me. Now, moving over to the business
[00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:51.360]   side of cash back, you've got the Spark Cash cards. These are similar to the Quicksilver cards,
[00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:56.560]   except they actually go all the way up to 2%. There is no 2% cash back card on the personal side.
[00:33:56.560 --> 00:34:03.040]   So the one I'll start with is the Spark Cash card. It's the Spark 2% cash version. You get 2% back on all
[00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:09.360]   purchases. You also get 5% back on hotels and rental cars through Capital One Travel. There is a bonus
[00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:16.480]   right now of $1,000 when you spend $10,000 in the first three months. So reasonable bonus there,
[00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:22.000]   right? You're getting 10% back on that spend. I like that. The annual fee is $95, but it's waived
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:27.360]   for the first year. There's no foreign transaction fees and you get free employee cards. So overall,
[00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:33.680]   as a business owner, a 2% back card on everything is pretty good. I would rather have 2X Miles. But if
[00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:38.480]   you already have a personal venture or VentureX card, then all of a sudden you don't need a Spark
[00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:44.320]   Miles card or a VentureX business card to be able to earn transferable miles with a business card.
[00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:51.920]   Now, similar to the Spark Cash 2% card, there is the Spark Cash Plus card, which is also a 2% card.
[00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:57.680]   And the main difference between this card is that unlike the Spark Cash, the Spark Cash Plus is a
[00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:01.840]   charge card. And so like I mentioned, when I was talking about the VentureX business, the Spark Cash
[00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:07.520]   Plus has no preset limit. You do have to pay it in full each month, but as you spend, that limit would go
[00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:12.080]   up and up over time and match your spending, or at least that's how it's supposed to work.
[00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:18.000]   And so it would be better than the Spark Cash card if you spend a ton of money in terms of needing a
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:23.360]   higher limit and not having to request credit line increases or be limited by whatever your limit is.
[00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:27.120]   It also has a much higher welcome offer. So right now, you earn $2,000
[00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:34.720]   on $30,000 of spend in the first three months. And then you earn another $2,000 for every
[00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:42.160]   $500,000 you spend in the first year. Now, that second bonus equates to about 0.4%.
[00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:48.240]   So I'm not really excited about that. Obviously, if you're spending a ton of money on your business,
[00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:52.880]   and you're going to spend $4 million in the first year, this card could be more rewarding because I
[00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:58.560]   guess in that first year, it would kind of average out if you spent right at $500,000 increments to be
[00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:05.440]   a 2.4% cashback card. But I think very few people are going to be spending $500,000 or more dollars on
[00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:09.440]   this card in the first 12 months. Now, you might look at this and say, okay, well, this welcome offer
[00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:14.640]   does seem like it could be more competitive than the VentureX business card in that if you paired it with a
[00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:21.280]   miles earning card, it would effectively be 200,000 miles for the same $30,000 of spend.
[00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:28.160]   The main difference here is that this card does have an annual fee of $150. And the only real
[00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:33.840]   benefits that it has that could offset that fee are that if you spend $150,000, it gets refunded.
[00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:37.840]   And there's not a lot of benefits. So you don't get lounge access, you don't get global entry
[00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:41.680]   reimbursed, you don't get the extra elevated earnings on Capital One Travel, you do get the
[00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:48.960]   5% back on hotels and rental cars, but not 10% or 10x on hotels and rental cars, or 5x on flights
[00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:53.840]   and vacation rentals that you would on the VentureX side. So to me, it kind of comes down to whether you
[00:36:53.840 --> 00:37:00.160]   want to pay that annual fee of $150 for the extra points, whether the benefits mean anything to you,
[00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:05.360]   how you think about the card long term. I do have this card, I did open this card when there was a really
[00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:10.560]   large welcome bonus. But as far as which card I'm keeping for a longer period of time, it's the
[00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:15.840]   VentureX business card. And you can only have one charge card with Capital One. So you can't have the
[00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:20.800]   Spark Cash Plus and the VentureX business card at the same time either. So keep that in mind if you're
[00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:24.960]   applying for one, and then you're thinking about the other, you definitely won't get approved for both.
[00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:31.760]   There are two other variations of the Spark cards. There's the Spark 1.5% cash select, and that is a
[00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:38.960]   one and a half percent back on everything card with no annual fee. The welcome bonus is $500 on $4,500
[00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:47.280]   in the first three months. And then there's the Spark 1% cash classic card, which is for fair credit,
[00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:52.800]   has no welcome offer, just earns a flat 1% back, but has no annual fee. So when I think about these on
[00:37:52.800 --> 00:38:00.000]   the tier list, I think the Spark business 2% cash plus is an A tier card. Because it's a charge card,
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:05.360]   you're able to get a much higher limit, and there's a much more lucrative welcome offer.
[00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:10.720]   So I like that. I think if paired with a miles earning card, that's great. There aren't a ton
[00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:17.920]   of 2% everything cards out there for businesses, but there are some. So the Spark 2% cash card that is
[00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:23.120]   very similar, but has a lower welcome offer and not a charge card, I'll put it the B tier. I think if there
[00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:28.960]   was a A minus B plus tier, those cards would be a lot closer. But if I compare them head to head,
[00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:33.040]   I'd prefer to have the higher welcome offer. And I think I'd prefer to have a charge card over a credit
[00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:39.440]   card. Then the Spark 1.5% cash card would be a C tier. And then the Spark classic card earning 1%
[00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:43.920]   would be a D tier. I think those speak for themselves. They're not earning a ton. There are better cards out
[00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:49.680]   there. I'm not interested in them. So that's the majority of the Capital One cards that aren't
[00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:53.920]   co-branded. There is one card that for whatever reason, when you go to look at cards on their
[00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:59.040]   website, it is the top card. It's the first one they show you. And it's the Platinum Master card.
[00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:05.840]   It has no annual fee and best I can tell it earns no rewards. And so I feel like it's at least worth
[00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:10.160]   mentioning this card, even though normally I wouldn't include it only because Capital One puts
[00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:15.600]   it at the top of their list. But for me, that is a D tier card that earns nothing. And I don't know
[00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:21.120]   why it's promoted so heavily, but I do know that it is a for fair credit card. So I assume it's probably
[00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:25.920]   for people who can't earn cards with more rewards. But if you look at the Capital One lineup, there are
[00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:31.200]   other cards for people with fair credit that do earn rewards. So this has got to be the worst of
[00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:36.400]   all of them. But if someone knows what I'm missing, I would love to know. Capital One also has a ton of
[00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:41.440]   co-branded cards with a lot of different retailers. And I was going to exclude all of them because none
[00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:46.240]   of them really stood out as interesting ones that would make sense to get if you weren't really,
[00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:51.440]   really tied into that retailer's ecosystem. But I do think it's worth mentioning just one of them.
[00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:55.200]   And technically, it's probably worth mentioning four of them. There is the Williams-Sonoma card,
[00:39:55.200 --> 00:40:00.160]   the Pottery Barn card, the West Elm card, and the key rewards card. And the most interesting
[00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:04.560]   thing about the fact that there are four of them is that best I can tell, they are all pretty much
[00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:09.760]   identical. I imagine the reason they're different is maybe they're opened in those individual stores,
[00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:13.840]   and maybe those stores get different bonuses based on how many cards they open. I have no idea.
[00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:18.800]   I can't tell what's different about any of them. So I'm just going to focus on the Williams-Sonoma
[00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:23.920]   one, but assume the same thing applies to Pottery Barn, West Elm, and the generic key rewards card.
[00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:30.960]   The reason I bring it up is that it is a 4% back on groceries, food delivery, and restaurants,
[00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:37.280]   which is actually not a bad rate of return. It also earns 5% back at Williams-Sonoma brands. So
[00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:41.760]   everything I mentioned, plus Mark and Graham, rejuvenation, maybe there's a couple other ones,
[00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:47.520]   like Pottery Barn Kids in there, and then 1% back on everything else. So I don't want to spend a lot of
[00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:53.280]   time on this card, but 4% cash back on groceries, restaurants, and food delivery is pretty interesting.
[00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:58.800]   With one caveat, you earn key rewards. You don't actually earn direct cash back.
[00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:04.000]   So if you're spending $20,000 a year on these categories, groceries, dining, you'd have to be
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:10.880]   spending $800 a year at Williams-Sonoma Pottery Barn, West Elm to be able to truly cash out that $800.
[00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:16.800]   It's actually $825 because every year on your birthday, you get $25 on top of that and free
[00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:23.120]   shipping. So if you spend money at those stores, it's not just rewarding to those stores, it's also
[00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:29.280]   rewarding to groceries, food, and restaurants, which is rare for a co-branded card. I think the Verizon
[00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:34.000]   Visa is a similar card that actually has really elevated good earnings. I think it's groceries also,
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   4%, but I could be wrong there. So for that card, I'll put it at the B tier because 4% on categories
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   like that is really compelling. It can't be any higher because that cash back only works if you
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:51.360]   spend 4% of your spend on those categories shopping at those Williams-Sonoma stores.
[00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:57.280]   So the other co-branded cards that I left out, the REI, Kohl's, Cabela's, Bass Pro, BJ's,
[00:41:57.280 --> 00:42:02.320]   they all have little to no signup bonus. The Williams-Sonoma card does have a welcome offer of 10%
[00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:06.960]   back on the Williams-Sonoma purchases in your first 30 days. So interesting if you're about
[00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:11.520]   to spend a ton of money at any of those stores, could make sense, could even keep it around for
[00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:16.320]   grocery, food, and delivery as long as you're spending enough on a regular basis at those stores
[00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:22.960]   to make use of that cash back. On all the other cards, they all earn about 1% to 7.5% at their
[00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:30.400]   respective stores, but only 1% to 1.5% everywhere else. So they really only make sense at those stores,
[00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:34.720]   which is why I separated the Williams-Sonoma card because it could make sense for other purchases.
[00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:41.280]   But some of them, notably the Cabela's and Bass Pro cards, they only go up to 5% off at their own
[00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:49.280]   store if you spend $25,000 a year. If you don't, they're 3% off if you spend $10,000. Otherwise,
[00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:54.800]   it's just a 2% off card at those stores and 1% everywhere else. To me, that seems absolutely
[00:42:54.800 --> 00:43:00.160]   crazy, right? You could get just a 2% everything card. And then if you go above and beyond and spend
[00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:07.840]   $10,000 at the retailer, you only get an extra 1% back on the spend at that store. So $100. If you
[00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:13.200]   spend $25,000, you could get an extra 3% back. So it's starting to be a little bit more interesting,
[00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:20.640]   but really for a small niche of people who spend well over $25,000 a year at Cabela's or Bass Pro. So
[00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:24.560]   I think there are people in that camp, but there are a lot of other cards that I think are more
[00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:29.120]   rewarding, which is why I'm not talking about them here. That's a lot of cards. Let's jump in to talk
[00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:34.080]   about the Capital One ecosystem. So a few things to know about all cards in general. So I didn't talk
[00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:40.560]   a ton about travel and purchase protections for those cards for a couple reasons. Mainly that Capital One
[00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:46.000]   doesn't always specify whether they're cards or visas or MasterCards. And this is kind of interesting,
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:49.120]   but if you go on the website and you look at all the pictures of the cards,
[00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:52.800]   you'll notice that it's not specified. And if you look up what are the travel purchase
[00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:58.400]   protections on certain cards, they'll send you to a link which says for Visa signature cards,
[00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:02.960]   here's the travel benefits. For World Elite MasterCard, click here. But they don't actually
[00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:08.160]   say which one you're going to get in advance. And I've heard stories of people getting a MasterCard
[00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:12.560]   version and then later changing it to a Visa version. And so I don't want to talk a lot about
[00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:17.760]   the travel and purchase protections. That said, almost all the cards I mentioned do have an extended warranty
[00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:24.960]   protection and not much else. However, the Venture X card does link out to the Visa Infinite benefits.
[00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:29.520]   So I have one, you are getting a Visa Infinite card, at least that's what it says on the website. It makes
[00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:33.920]   it pretty clear, which means you do get a lot more coverage for the Venture X card. You're getting
[00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:39.200]   primary rental coverage, trip delay and cancellation, lost luggage, purchase protection, extended warranty,
[00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:44.240]   cell phone protection. So that's great. But as for the other cards, I think you really have to go look
[00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:49.520]   at the guide to benefits. And I wouldn't be opening any of these Capital One cards except a Venture X card,
[00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:54.320]   primarily for their purchase protections and travel protections, because it's just hard to know what
[00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:57.920]   you're going to get. One thing you are going to get with all your Capital One cards, at least all the
[00:44:57.920 --> 00:45:03.120]   ones I've used, is virtual card numbers, which is awesome. So if you're checking out on some website and
[00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:07.520]   you feel like it's a little sketchy, you can go create a virtual card on the website, or you can use their
[00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:13.200]   Eno browser extension. And that lets you create virtual card numbers on the fly. I've done that a ton of
[00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:18.480]   times. Or for sites where you're getting a seven day trial, and you're not sure how easy it'll be to
[00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:25.280]   cancel, you can use a virtual card and set that card to expire the next day. So that if that trial is hard to
[00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:31.440]   cancel, you could just leave it go and not worry about it hitting your card. Another cool benefit is that in 19
[00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:37.840]   different states and pretty much most major cities in America, Capital One has cafes, they have 55 of
[00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:42.720]   them. And they're like coffee shops, except that if you have a Capital One debit or credit card, you get
[00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:51.280]   50% off all beverages. And there is semi private kind of nooks available to work out of at almost every cafe,
[00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:55.680]   and you can actually reserve them. I haven't figured out how to reserve them. But it says you can reserve
[00:45:55.680 --> 00:46:01.520]   these semi private nooks at almost every cafe. This episode is brought to you by Viore. Now,
[00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:05.600]   there is nothing better than finding a brand of clothing that's comfortable, functional and looks
[00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:10.400]   good. And that's how I feel about Viore. If you're looking at me in person, you'd know I believe it,
[00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:16.160]   because there are very few days that go by where I'm not wearing one, two or even three pieces of Viore
[00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:21.680]   clothing. They make performance apparel for men and women that's incredibly versatile. Everything is
[00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:26.720]   designed to work out in, but it doesn't look or feel like it at all. And it's so comfortable, you will
[00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:32.080]   want to wear it all the time. My personal favorite is the Sunday performance joggers, but I wear strato
[00:46:32.080 --> 00:46:38.240]   tech tees almost every day, I run and work out in their core shorts, and the meta pants and polos are what I
[00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:44.080]   wear out to a nice dinner. And for our listeners, they're offering 20% off your first purchase plus

[00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:30.560]   offers. Now this used to be just cashback offers for your cards. But now it's actually turned into
[00:47:30.560 --> 00:47:36.160]   a miles portal, which is pretty cool if you have a miles earning card. So right now, when I look, I see
[00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:43.840]   3556 offers, which is a ton. But unlike Chase and Amex, where these are mostly card linked offers,
[00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:50.080]   all but 30 of them are actually all online offers. So they're much more like a shopping portal with
[00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:54.320]   Rakuten than they are like the kind of card linked offers you might be used to.
[00:47:54.320 --> 00:48:01.120]   That said, when I'm looking at some of the in-store ones, they do have CVS for in-store at 15x miles.
[00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:06.320]   Now, if you click into it, you can see what that is. It says three activations. You can only use them
[00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:13.120]   one time every 30 days for up to 1000 miles. But 15x miles on purchases up to, I guess, $66,
[00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:19.680]   $67 in-store is pretty cool if you're regularly going to CVS. That brings up one thing that I'm going to
[00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:24.960]   throw out there in case anyone's tested this or tried this. I've been noticing that I have really,
[00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:29.360]   really high medical bills when I'm looking at what the actual cost insurance pays.
[00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:35.120]   And I'm wondering if when I'm picking up a prescription, when I'm going for treatment with a
[00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:40.240]   doctor, or even if I'm having a surgery like my daughter had, could I actually just start paying
[00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:45.040]   for all that out of pocket and then submitting for reimbursement? I'm not sure how that process
[00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:50.080]   works because I know there's pre-negotiated rates, but it would be really cool if I could use my credit
[00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:55.360]   card to pay for a thousand dollar prescription and then submit it for reimbursement with my insurance
[00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:59.360]   company instead of just having them pay for it because then I'd get the points and miles.
[00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:04.480]   So that kind of crossed my mind when I saw 15x miles at CVS because I thought, wow,
[00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:07.440]   I have a couple of prescriptions that I pick up regularly. That could be pretty lucrative.
[00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:11.440]   So if anyone has any experience there, shoot me an email, podcast@allthehacks.com.
[00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:17.440]   I'm really interested in exploring whether I can turn all the medical expenses that insurance normally
[00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:22.880]   covers directly into things I can put on my credit card and then get reimbursed for later.
[00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:27.200]   Obviously, I don't want to do it if I'm not going to get reimbursed, but if I could, that seems pretty
[00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:32.960]   interesting. On most of these offers, there are variable amount ranges from 0.01x miles all the way
[00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:39.840]   up to 87x miles. There are a handful that are just fixed amounts from anywhere from 1,000 to 25,000 miles.
[00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:45.440]   There are so many here that it's a little bit hard to grapple, but I would say worth going in here one
[00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:50.560]   or more times just to see what kind of is in there. Most of the major travel sites are on here for
[00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:56.720]   earning miles like Expedia, Virbo, Marriott, IHG, Hilton, but you really need to be comparing Capital
[00:49:56.720 --> 00:50:02.800]   One offers with Rakuten for a lot of these. So for me, I'll probably use this and go to in-store
[00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:07.520]   to see what's there. But for the most part, I'll probably be comparing Capital One offers
[00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:12.160]   on a site like SaveWise or Cashback Monitor and thinking about it that way.
[00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:16.640]   Then separately, there's Capital One Shopping, which interestingly enough has nothing to do with
[00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:20.240]   being a Capital One cardholder. It is a Rakuten competitor.
[00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:26.400]   You can go on and find offers for lots of different sites that you can earn cash back as long as you
[00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:30.560]   use their browser extension and enable it. So I'm not going to spend much time talking about it here
[00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:34.880]   because it has nothing to do with being a Capital One cardholder, but it does exist and it's part of
[00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:39.600]   Capital One. So I thought I'd at least mention that other than being able to log in with your Capital One
[00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:44.960]   login, there's no real link to your account, your card, your miles or anything like that. It's just a public
[00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:50.880]   shopping portal. That said, keeping that extension on when you're on certain sites is super interesting
[00:50:50.880 --> 00:50:56.400]   because they send these targeted emails. So you might be browsing a hotel at Hilton and then get
[00:50:56.400 --> 00:51:01.200]   an email two days later that says, "Hey, you never made that Hilton checkout. Do you want 30% back on
[00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:05.120]   Hilton?" And some of them can be pretty, pretty extreme. A few other things on Capital One. They
[00:51:05.120 --> 00:51:11.280]   do have referral programs. And so depending on your card, you can usually earn 20 to 25,000 miles for
[00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:17.920]   referring someone. But there is a cap each year of I think it's either 100,000 miles or $1,000. But also
[00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:23.040]   keep in mind that those referrals are taxable. If you refer enough people, you will probably get a 1099 and
[00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:28.640]   you will owe taxes on the paid out amount. I don't remember how they value miles in that case. Probably a
[00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:33.920]   penny a mile, but I'm not sure. But just something to keep in mind. And then last, there is a program called Capital One
[00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:40.640]   Dining, where all US issued Capital One branded cards have access. Debit cards and co-branded cards
[00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:45.280]   are not eligible, but they just have a few restaurants. And by a few, I mean quite a few
[00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:50.560]   in San Francisco that are really good. State Bird Provisions, Mr. Jews, Atelier Crenn, where you get
[00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:55.280]   exclusive reservations and they say a free treat from the restaurant. So I haven't booked a reservation
[00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:59.440]   here. It's on my list of something to test out. But just something if you have a Capital One card and
[00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:03.360]   you haven't played around with Capital One Dining, definitely something worth looking into.
[00:52:03.360 --> 00:52:06.720]   Next, I want to talk about Capital One miles and how to get the most out of them.
[00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:13.120]   So there are a few options for redemptions that I don't ever use, but I'll run through quickly.
[00:52:13.120 --> 00:52:18.160]   You could just take a straight statement credit towards cash at half a cent a point. They have
[00:52:18.160 --> 00:52:24.080]   a gift card marketplace where you can get gift cards for 0.8 cents a point. And then sometimes they
[00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:29.840]   go on sale. So right now, there's a sale on Apple, DoorDash, Uber, Wayfair. And that makes your points
[00:52:29.840 --> 00:52:37.440]   worth 1.07 cents. You can use it to book travel in Capital One Travel or for some cards reimburse
[00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:42.160]   yourself as a statement credit. That's at one cent a point. Now, earlier, I mentioned that the points
[00:52:42.160 --> 00:52:48.400]   guy values Capital One points at 1.85 cents. So obviously, none of these options are ways to redeem
[00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:53.680]   points at that level. The primary way you would want to get outsized value is from the Capital One
[00:52:53.680 --> 00:52:59.040]   Transfer Partners. But there's one little thing that I'll mention. If you like baseball, Capital One has
[00:52:59.040 --> 00:53:05.760]   some interesting cardholder exclusives where they have specific great seats at a handful of stadiums
[00:53:05.760 --> 00:53:10.960]   where when they release seats, you can get amazing seats for 5,000 miles, which is somewhere between
[00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:16.240]   50 and $100, but really, really great seats. I'm not a big baseball fan, so I've never done this.
[00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:21.520]   I'll link to an article from The Frequent Miler about how to take advantage of this because they also will
[00:53:21.520 --> 00:53:25.680]   sell you baseball seats at almost any game for a terrible use of miles. So you want to make sure you're
[00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:29.920]   getting a really great deal here, but that is one way to get outsized value. But the primary way to
[00:53:29.920 --> 00:53:34.720]   get outsized value from your Capital One miles is by transferring them to airlines and hotels.
[00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:39.520]   So I'm going to pull up my transfer partner spreadsheet. There right now are 16 airlines
[00:53:39.520 --> 00:53:44.960]   and three hotels that you can transfer to, and you need a miles card to do those transfers. So a
[00:53:44.960 --> 00:53:51.120]   Venture, a Venture X, a Spark Miles are all options. Now, at 16 airlines where I'll focus first,
[00:53:51.120 --> 00:53:57.760]   that's quite a few. And it's really competitive to Amex, for example. If you compare Capital One to Amex,
[00:53:57.760 --> 00:54:03.280]   you've got all the same partners with a couple exceptions. You're missing out on Delta and ANA,
[00:54:03.280 --> 00:54:09.600]   neither of which I regularly, if ever use. But you get EVA Air, which I love because they have their own
[00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:15.440]   kind of inventory special to their members for business class availability. Turkish, which has a few
[00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:21.040]   sweet spots, and Tap Air Portugal, which I'm not aware of any great uses. So pretty comparable in
[00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:26.880]   terms of Capital One points to Amex points on the airline side. And amongst those, a handful of my
[00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:35.040]   favorites. So Aeroplan in Star Alliance, Avianca in Star Alliance, Avios in One World and Asia Miles in One
[00:54:35.040 --> 00:54:42.240]   World, Flying Blue on the SkyTeam side. I mentioned EVA Air. It's not as good of a transfer ratio as you'd get
[00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:48.160]   from Citi, but might be worth the availability. And then a bunch of others that can be good for
[00:54:48.160 --> 00:54:53.440]   various uses. Qantas, Singapore, Turkish, Virgin Red, Emirates, Etihad. Those are the notable ones.
[00:54:53.440 --> 00:54:57.600]   I just did an episode with Greg from The Frequent Miler, where we talked about all these transfer
[00:54:57.600 --> 00:55:03.600]   partners. So if you're interested, go back and listen to that. Notably, there are not any major US airlines
[00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:08.640]   where there's a lot of opportunity for outsized value, other than possibly JetBlue, where you get a
[00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:13.600]   five to three ratio, which is not nearly as compelling as the ratio you get from Chase,
[00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:19.440]   Amex, or Citi. But at the end of the day, using US carriers is not necessary to get outsized value.
[00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:24.720]   I've done so many bookings from Air Canada Aeroplan to book flights on United, or Avios to book plans
[00:55:24.720 --> 00:55:31.600]   on American, or using Flying Blue to book flights on Delta. So there are ways to fly US-based airlines
[00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:34.960]   and get outsized value. You just don't book through those programs. And we've talked about
[00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:39.600]   that a ton on other episodes that I can link to in the show notes. On the hotel side, there are only
[00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:46.080]   three options. You get Choice Privileges, Accor, and Wyndham. And I'll be honest, not that compelling.
[00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:51.360]   The main one here that's kind of stand out is that Wyndham has an ability to earn outsized value
[00:55:51.360 --> 00:55:55.520]   through booking Vacasa vacation rentals. And so I'll put a link in the show notes if you want to
[00:55:55.520 --> 00:56:01.520]   go deeper on that. On the Accor side, Accor points are kind of fixed in value. So there's not a lot of
[00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:06.640]   opportunity for upside here. And on Choice, you're probably better off cashing out your Capital One
[00:56:06.640 --> 00:56:12.720]   miles for one cent and buying Choice points than transferring just one to one, to be honest,
[00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:17.840]   because they're often on sale for half a cent. I don't mind Choice as a partner, maybe if you have
[00:56:17.840 --> 00:56:24.720]   City or Wells Fargo, where you get two Choice points for every one point you transfer. But with Capital One,
[00:56:24.720 --> 00:56:30.720]   it's one to one. So not really an exciting partner for me. So I would stick to the airline partners.
[00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:36.880]   And as for transfer bonuses, Capital One has some. So in 2023 and 2024, there were six. There have been
[00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:43.920]   four year to date in 2025. Typical things you'd see 20% bonus to Flying Blue, 30% bonus to Virgin,
[00:56:43.920 --> 00:56:51.760]   30-40% to Etihad, maybe 20% to Avios, but we didn't see that every year. It's almost always in the 15%
[00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:57.760]   to 30% range. And it seems like there's one every other month. So while it happens, it doesn't happen
[00:56:57.760 --> 00:57:03.040]   that often, not as much as some other programs. But it doesn't happen enough that I would wait for it.
[00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:07.040]   But it happens frequently enough that maybe you'll get lucky and a trip you're planning happens right
[00:57:07.040 --> 00:57:11.840]   as a bonus hits and you can get a little bit of upside there. Where I think Capital One Miles really,
[00:57:11.840 --> 00:57:18.240]   really shine is that you can combine them across your cards, but you can also combine them between
[00:57:18.240 --> 00:57:23.600]   people. So you can share them to anyone, whether that's your spouse that lives at your same address
[00:57:23.600 --> 00:57:28.800]   or your friend that lives in another state. There's no limits or expirations like City. So I think it's
[00:57:28.800 --> 00:57:35.360]   really, really awesome for the ability to move points between people, pull points for trips
[00:57:35.360 --> 00:57:39.680]   with families, especially if you have a large extended family and you want to all book out of
[00:57:39.680 --> 00:57:44.560]   your account to make it a little easier, or maybe you have status with an airline you're transferring to.
[00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:49.600]   That is one amazing feature of Capital One is the ability to move miles by anyone. Unfortunately,
[00:57:49.600 --> 00:57:53.600]   you have to do it by the phone, but you can do it. And that's awesome. Also, keep in mind,
[00:57:53.600 --> 00:57:57.920]   I mentioned if you have a cash back card, you can move your cash back over to your miles balance,
[00:57:57.920 --> 00:58:02.880]   but it's not reversible. You can't move your miles back to cash back once you've earned them or once
[00:58:02.880 --> 00:58:08.000]   you've transferred them. As for getting Capital One cards, they are stricter with approvals than a lot
[00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:12.480]   of other issuers. I always say if you're looking at getting two cards, get the Capital One card first.
[00:58:12.480 --> 00:58:17.760]   They're really sensitive to recent inquiries. They also tend to only approve you for one card every six
[00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:23.120]   months. And you can only get a welcome offer for a card every 48 months for personal cards.
[00:58:23.120 --> 00:58:28.000]   And if you read around online, people say you can only have two personal cards with Capital One.
[00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:32.960]   And they say it's not always true. It sometimes excludes co-brands. Some say there's a new limit of
[00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:38.720]   five. Some people say, no, it's still two. But you can't open tons and tons of Capital One cards,
[00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:42.720]   especially with one every six months. It's difficult. Also, you can only have one charge card,
[00:58:42.720 --> 00:58:47.200]   as I mentioned earlier. So Spark Cash Plus or VentureX Business. Now you can have a lot more
[00:58:47.200 --> 00:58:51.360]   business cards. I know a few people who have five or six business cards for all their different
[00:58:51.360 --> 00:58:56.800]   businesses, and that is okay. Sometimes you can move credit from one card to an existing card.
[00:58:56.800 --> 00:59:04.640]   Seems like sometimes you can't. And you can't do a credit line increase within a few months of making
[00:59:04.640 --> 00:59:08.640]   any of those credit moves. So keep that in mind. If you're looking to move credit, you might want to
[00:59:08.640 --> 00:59:12.720]   request a credit line increase before you do that. They do have a reconsideration line if you're not
[00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:17.920]   approved immediately and you have questions. And they do allow product changes, but not in any kind
[00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:23.120]   of systematized way. You might not be eligible for something that someone else is. So for me,
[00:59:23.120 --> 00:59:27.360]   if I wanted to product change my VentureX, they said I could move it to a Venture, a VentureOne or a
[00:59:27.360 --> 00:59:32.640]   Quicksilver. But you might ask the same question or try to do that online and find that you don't get the
[00:59:32.640 --> 00:59:37.360]   same options. I looked at the options for my Spark Cash Plus and I didn't see any right now.
[00:59:37.360 --> 00:59:42.000]   That could change if I call. So there is the ability to product change, but there is not as
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:47.040]   straightforward of an ability to do it as some other issuers have in terms of what you can do.
[00:59:47.040 --> 00:59:51.840]   That said, they are more generous with limits than some other issuers. I know for me, I was able to get
[00:59:51.840 --> 00:59:57.920]   a $30,000 limit on my VentureX card when I opened it. And I know with some issuers, especially Citi,
[00:59:57.920 --> 01:00:02.480]   when I opened new cards, they were opening much lower limits than that. I love that you can do a
[01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:06.720]   lot of this online. You can upgrade your cards, move your credit lines, request credit line increases.
[01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:10.720]   You've got the virtual cards. Everything online is really great. And your personal and your business
[01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:15.120]   cards are on the same logins, which I can't say about Citi. And with Chase, it's a little bit strange
[01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:21.120]   with how that works. Amex, it's pretty straightforward. So that's basically all of the things you need to
[01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:26.640]   know about Capital One. Let's summarize. So Capital One, what's exciting? Some really good signup
[01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:33.200]   bonuses. Despite not having as many cards as an Amex or a Chase, being able to get 75,000 points on
[01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:39.520]   the Venture and the VentureX, being able to get 150 or $1,000 to $2,000 on some of the business cards,
[01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:44.160]   love having the option to get a bunch of good signup bonuses. For points diversification,
[01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:50.720]   you get a couple of things that you won't get with other programs like Evia Air and Windham. But it also
[01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:57.040]   has the mainstays that I'm often using for flights. Flying Blue, Aeroplan, Avios. Those are probably my
[01:00:57.040 --> 01:01:02.960]   most frequented uses. Like I said, it's missing a lot of the domestic US airlines, no United, American,
[01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:08.160]   or Alaska. And obviously, if they added Hyatt, it would be amazing. And they have not. And I don't
[01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:13.440]   foresee that ever happening. Other big thing to love about Capital One is lower annual fees. So for their
[01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:20.160]   premium cards, you're not looking at these $700 to almost $1,000 annual fees with tons of credits.
[01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:24.320]   That's not a game they've started playing. And I love that it works really well for multiple players,
[01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:28.720]   because you can transfer points between anyone with no expiration like you get with Citi.
[01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:34.000]   But the real reason I love Capital One is that they have uncapped 2x transferable miles cards.
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:38.480]   And they'd have it on the business side and the personal side, which is really, really rare.
[01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:42.960]   Even if you're just looking compared to cash back and focusing on the business side,
[01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:48.160]   it's hard to even find 2% cash back for business. Yes, there's the Chase Inc. Premier,
[01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:53.200]   but you can't get points. And it comes with an almost $200 fee. On the Bank of America side,
[01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:57.680]   you can get close to that, but only if you have $100,000 in a business account,
[01:01:57.680 --> 01:02:02.000]   which I have worked to set up, and it is a huge pain. Amex has the Blue Business Plus,
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:07.440]   but it has a cap of $50,000 of spend a year. And then there is this Wells Fargo Signify business
[01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:12.560]   cash card, which is a 2% card that may be able to transfer points over to the autograph or the
[01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:17.840]   autograph journey. But Wells Fargo is among the least interesting points currency out there.
[01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:23.040]   So I love that. I also love getting high limits on these cards compared to what you might get
[01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:28.240]   with a 2x card, like the City Double Cash or the Wells Fargo Active Cash, which also, by the way,
[01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:33.760]   requires you to have another card to tie it to. But coming back to my point that this uncapped 2x
[01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:39.120]   points card is interesting, I actually ran the numbers and it is the best single card. If you look
[01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:45.280]   at the Bureau of Labor Statistics data, I applied the average spending patterns for households with,
[01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:51.920]   I think it was a household annual income of $100,000 plus, to every single card. And the
[01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:58.480]   closest runner-ups to earning 2x miles on everything were the Amex Gold, where you get 4x on dining and
[01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:04.080]   grocery and 1x on everything else, and the City Premier, where you get 3x on dining, grocery, gas,
[01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:09.840]   air travel, and hotels, and 1x on everything else. But the average for the average family with the data
[01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:17.280]   I used was earning 1.74 on the Amex Gold and 1.65 on the City Premier. So if you want one single card,
[01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:22.080]   and you don't want to play games, and you just want to maximize your miles and points earning with one
[01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:27.920]   card, being able to do that with Capital One on the Venture, the Venture X, the Venture X Business,
[01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:34.000]   the Spark Miles, there's multiple cards that can do it. Really incredible for getting one card. Now, what's
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:40.080]   crazy is that that one card actually does better than the best two card combo from Amex or Chase.
[01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:45.360]   So if you look at the best two card combo from Amex, the average earning is 1.96x. So you're just shy of
[01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:51.280]   earning 2x on everything. And if you look at it on Chase, it's 1.91x. Now, if you want to look at two
[01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:57.680]   card combos from Capital One, you'd be looking at the Venture or the Venture X paired with the Saver
[01:03:57.680 --> 01:04:06.160]   card, and you'd have a $95 annual fee. And I calculated an average earning of 2.26x on everything.
[01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:12.960]   Now, if you compare that to Wells Fargo or Citi, they're slightly better at 2.32x and 2.33x on all
[01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:18.160]   your spending. So I could make a case that the best two card combo probably is the Citi Strata Premier
[01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:24.560]   and the Citi Double Cash. However, I much prefer Capital One as a platform from a technology standpoint.
[01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:30.640]   I much prefer Capital One from a limits on cards standpoint. And even more, that doesn't factor in
[01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:36.160]   how much you'd earn if you booked some of your travel in the Capital One travel portal. Because
[01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:42.240]   part of the reason that those other brands win is that they have 3x on travel or flights or hotels.
[01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:47.200]   If you were booking flights in Capital One travel for 10x or hotels in Capital One travel for 5x with
[01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:52.640]   the Venture X, you would blow that out of the water. So even as a two card combo, I think Capital One stands
[01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:59.440]   up to all the best out there. As a one card combo, it is the best. And the main thing that is less exciting
[01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:04.080]   is that it's harder to get approved, harder to have a lot of cards there. They don't have as many cards
[01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:09.440]   and welcome bonuses as a Chase or Amex, and they don't have any really major unique transfer partner
[01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:16.240]   differentiation like you might get AA from Citi, Hyatt from Chase, or United from Chase. However,
[01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:22.000]   while I would much rather have Chase or Bilt points than Capital One points, I would much rather have
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:28.800]   2x Capital One points over 1 to 1.5x Chase or Bilt or Citi or Amex or any other points. So the fact that you
[01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:35.760]   can earn 2x points with the Venture, the Venture X, the Spark Miles cards, I think that makes them the
[01:05:35.760 --> 01:05:40.160]   best catch-all cards out there. And I'm extremely happy that we have one on the personal and one on
[01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:44.720]   the business in our wallets right now. And if you can take advantage of that huge signup bonus on the
[01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:49.280]   Venture X business before it changes, it's an awesome way to boost your Capital One balance,
[01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:55.440]   150,000 points plus the 60,000 points from the spend, getting over 10% back on that spend in terms
[01:05:55.440 --> 01:06:00.560]   of how I value points. If you're going to sign up for anything, reminder that all the links to all
[01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:06.400]   the cards are in the show notes or at allthehacks.com/cards. I really hope this episode was helpful for you.
[01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:13.920]   Feedback is very welcome, podcast@allthehacks.com. I think next I'll be going deep on Bank of America
[01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:18.400]   or maybe Bilt now that they have three cards launching once they've announced that. But on the Bank of
[01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:22.720]   America side, we've gone from having zero to four Bank of America cards in our house and this new
[01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:28.480]   premium Alaska card is interesting and details are just starting to emerge. So stay tuned for those.
[01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:33.280]   That is it for this week. Again, comments, feedback, questions, other episode ideas,
[01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:36.800]   podcast at all the hacks.com is where to send it. I will see you next week.
