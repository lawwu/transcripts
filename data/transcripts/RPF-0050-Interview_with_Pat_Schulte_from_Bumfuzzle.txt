[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.240]   interested in learning everything you can from a man who started with an eight dollar an hour job
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:28.880]   after college, parlayed that job into a career as a commodities trader, retired at the age of 30,
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.080]   and has proceeded to spend the next 10 years traveling the world with his family?
[00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.040]   Welcome to episode 50.
[00:00:54.560 --> 00:01:02.000]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast for today, Thursday, August 28, 2014. I thank
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.720]   you for being here. This is an episode that I have been wanting to bring you for a while.
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:13.680]   Today we're going to speak with Pat Schulte, who is the writer and adventurer found at
[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:21.280]   bumfuzzle.com. Sailor and RVer, a vanner or a van dweller, I guess would be the term,
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:31.680]   commodities trader, man of international mystery and intrigue. Perhaps that's a little bit grandiose,
[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.160]   but as you'll see in today's show, I really don't think it is too grandiose. I've been looking
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.720]   forward to bringing you this interview. Before I play the interview for you, I'm just going to
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.160]   share with you a little bit about the background. This is a blog. I've mentioned it a couple of
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.720]   times on the show. It's a blog that I've read for a couple of years and I've thoroughly enjoyed.
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.160]   It's a wonderful blog. I would highly encourage you to check it out at bumfuzzle.com.
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.800]   But to pique your interest before the interview, Pat Schulte is a really intriguing guy.
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.880]   Today was my first time talking with him on the phone and I really enjoyed that.
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:09.600]   He's somebody who in many ways seems to have cracked the code on the American dream.
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.680]   Like I mentioned prior to starting the music, he started out of college with an $8 an hour job
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:25.680]   working on a Minneapolis exchange. He sold his pickup truck for $5,000 to start his
[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.280]   stake for trading. Worked as an independent trader for the next coming years, ultimately
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.640]   moved to Chicago so he could trade on the commodities board there in Chicago. I assume
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.960]   the mercantile exchange, but I'm not an expert on what board or what exchange he was trading on.
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:49.280]   Traded primarily soybeans futures. At the age of about 30, he and his wife decided to quit.
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.360]   They had done well, made a lot of money and decided to quit and go sail around the world.
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.560]   So they flew down to Fort Lauderdale, Florida. They bought a sailboat,
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.640]   spent the next four years sailing around the world on the 35-foot catamaran,
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:09.680]   then came back to the US, sold their boat, did an across the country race called the Great Race in
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:18.800]   their 1965 Porsche 356, decided to take another road trip, bought a 1958 Volkswagen bus, and then
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:24.400]   proceeded to do a 60,000 mile road trip in that, visiting, let's see, I think it was something like
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:32.400]   25 countries. So yeah, 28 countries, 60,000 miles, 525 days on the road. And they had visited about
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:38.480]   45 countries on their original sailboat. Got pregnant, moved to Mexico, had a baby,
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.920]   bought another sailboat, lived on that sailboat in Mexico and around Mexico and California for
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:49.040]   a few years, had another baby, then came back to, sold the boat, came back to the States and bought
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:55.680]   a 1966 Dodge Travco RV and have been traveling around the country for the last 11 years.
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.440]   So hopefully that'll pique your interest. And Pat has written a couple of books,
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:05.440]   one about a sailing adventure and one about trading. He currently earns his income trading
[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.760]   stocks, excuse me, trading options, as he clarifies in the interview, he doesn't trade
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.160]   stocks very much anymore. So trades options and that's how he funds, mostly funds his lifestyle.
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.560]   And I assume a little bit of income here and there from the books and perhaps other things as well.
[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:24.320]   So I've been looking forward to bringing you this interview. I am sure you're going to enjoy it.
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:29.040]   Oh, and I forgot to mention, I screwed up at the beginning of the show and I didn't hit the record
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.760]   button on the interview. And then I actually did it twice. The first time Pat was a minute into his
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.480]   talk and I thought I'd hit the record button, but I have to hit it twice and I didn't hit it the
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:43.600]   second time. And then I said, "Hey, sorry, I stopped him." And then we started again. And then
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:49.280]   I realized that I thought I'd hit it and I didn't hit it. So I screwed it up. So you're missing the
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.280]   first about 10 seconds of the show, but hopefully that's not a big deal. Here's the interview.
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:05:01.840]   So the first time, just a moment ago, I had hit record and then I didn't do it. So I apologize.
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:07.200]   I screwed up the recording, but I do want to thank you for being with us. And a personal thank you
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:12.560]   just for all the work that you've done on your site and the intro of shared people, just your
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:17.600]   site and your books. But I appreciate all of the work that you've done over the years of building a
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:22.320]   comprehensive website and putting together the books that you've written. So thank you for all
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.200]   the hard work that you've done. Yeah, of course. Thanks.
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.280]   Where I'd like to start, if you're willing, is just share with us a little bit about your story,
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:36.320]   maybe over about the last 10 or 20 years or so. Sure. Yeah. Well, my wife and I met back in high
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:43.520]   school and so we've always kind of had each other and we're able to take challenges on. And early
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:49.440]   on, I'd always wanted to be a trader. Watching the guys in the New York Stock Exchange on TV
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.200]   and everything, I always thought, "Wow, that looks like the job for me." And it turned out
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:58.720]   there was a small exchange in Minneapolis, the Commodities Exchange. So right out of college,
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:04.800]   I kind of started in on the ground floor there and just kind of worked my way up as a clerk and
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:10.400]   everything. And then as a broker and learned as much as I could from the smartest guys there that
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:17.040]   I could find. And then eventually I went out on my own in Chicago. I was trading soybean options and
[00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:25.360]   all sorts of different agricultural products and just focusing on options though. And things went
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:32.880]   well, fortunately. And all our friends kind of started to head off into the suburbs and started
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:37.040]   having kids. And my wife and I, we just kind of realized, "Oh, we're not quite ready to do that.
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:44.160]   We're looking to do something just kind of crazy and different and kind of run while we got the
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:52.240]   money and make something fun happen." And so we decided one night over beers to go sail around
[00:06:52.240 --> 00:07:00.720]   the world. It sounded about as crazy as we could come up with. And just a few months later, we were
[00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:04.960]   on a boat for the first time, our own boat, and just setting off.
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.680]   Mad Fientist Had you ever sailed before that? Or did you
[00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.840]   know anyone who sailed? Or where did the idea actually come from?
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:13.280]   Mike You know, as a commodities trader, I was off.
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:19.920]   The markets closed early every day. So I was home by like 1.30. And so I'd be on the internet
[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:25.760]   looking for... I got into the whole... I got a travel bug. I wasn't really a traveler or adventurer,
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:31.120]   but I got into that bug. And so I was always searching things out. And at the time, there
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:38.960]   wasn't a whole lot out there. I mean, this was like 2002 or 2003. But I found one blog about
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:43.200]   these people sailing around the world. And I thought, "That sounds pretty awesome." And they
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:47.680]   didn't seem to really know too much about what they were doing. So I figured, "What the heck?"
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:51.680]   Mad Fientist So you sailed around the world. And how long were you guys gone?
[00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:54.160]   Mike Yeah, we did that for four years. And we were
[00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:58.080]   about halfway through when we realized, "You know what? I don't think we're going to go back to
[00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:03.920]   Chicago." And we had always planned, "I'll just go back to Chicago and just pick up where we left
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:08.640]   off." But about halfway through, we thought, "There's a better life out here than just
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:15.600]   working to make money, to make more money, to keep working." Just the cycle.
[00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:20.000]   And so we've just kind of continued travels.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.400]   Mad Fientist It's interesting to me about just that exposure,
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:28.720]   because it seems to me – and let me just, instead of saying it, let me ask you this question. Did
[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:36.080]   your perspective of what kind of lifestyle was okay to choose change over the years as you got
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:38.720]   out and traveled and expanded your horizons? Mike
[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:44.640]   Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, when we first took off, we just told Tam and, "Hey, this is just a break
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:51.360]   from life. We're going to go do this thing, and it'll be an adventure, and it'll be a great story
[00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:58.160]   for our kids someday," kind of thing. But like I said, somewhere along the way, things just kind
[00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:06.560]   of changed, and that became our life. And the idea of going back to our previous life just wasn't
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:13.200]   appealing anymore. Suddenly, we were like, "Wow, we really don't need much of anything. We can
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:22.080]   live. We can travel the world on a fraction of pretty much what we're spending just to live
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:25.760]   downtown Chicago and go to work every day." Mad Fientist
[00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:31.520]   Do you have the money just to do that for the rest of your life, or do you see it running out
[00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:33.840]   at some point? Are you going to need to go back to work?
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:37.200]   Mike Yeah, well, that's part of the thing, too,
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:47.680]   is I kind of became a big proponent of mini-retirements. I guess that phrase has been
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:52.240]   coined at some point. I think it was in the four-hour work week or something. But I kind of
[00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:59.440]   figured, do stuff while you can, and you can always work. You might not always be able to make
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:04.320]   as much money as you once were. You might not be able to step right back into the same thing you
[00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:11.120]   were doing. But there's always work, and there's always options out there for smart people willing
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:22.400]   to work hard. Excuse me one second. What is it? I know I'm on the phone. Sorry.
[00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:24.640]   Mad Fientist My little one's not walking yet,
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:29.280]   but I'm sure that in the future, sometimes in the background of my show, you can hear him crying
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:34.400]   as he lies down or something. I'm sure in the future, he's going to walk in and interrupt my
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:36.240]   shows in the future. I think that's how it should be.
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:38.080]   Mike Well, that's my four-year-old. She's so
[00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:41.200]   amazed to hear me on the phone that she had to come see what the heck was going on. She's like,
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:44.000]   "I heard you talking to somebody. What's going on?"
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.040]   Mad Fientist Yeah, I thought you made a good point of that
[00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:52.080]   in your book about the mini-retirements. It's one of the themes I especially admire. You have a
[00:10:52.080 --> 00:11:00.880]   four-year-old, and your son is three, four and three. It seems to me, and I've said on the show,
[00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:05.920]   and I'm curious if you agree, it seems to me like the whole way that we approach life is so twisted.
[00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:11.040]   You probably don't know. I come from the background of a financial planner. I worked
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:16.800]   six years as a professional financial advisor and financial planner. The whole deal that is preached
[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:20.240]   in the financial planning world that I grew up reading personal finance books is you're supposed
[00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:24.560]   to save for retirement, save for retirement. The way I figured it out is you're supposed to go to
[00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:28.640]   college, graduate from college, work really hard, have kids, buy a house, get a mortgage,
[00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:33.360]   work really hard during those years to establish your career to earn money. Then you're supposed
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:38.160]   to save, save, save, save, save, so you can hit this magical point of 60 or 65 years old,
[00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:43.760]   having enough money to retire, which takes a huge amount of money. It's a massive amount of money
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:46.320]   if you're just going to say, "I'm not going to work." Then the other thing is we're not supposed
[00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:51.680]   to count on Social Security, so therefore you've got to save it all yourself. All during this time,
[00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:56.000]   you miss your kid's childhood. Right about the time you hit maybe 50, you hit your stride,
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.520]   you're in the peak of your career, you can afford to pull back a little. You turn around and your
[00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:04.400]   kids are gone. Then you hit 60 and you hit early retirement. Your kids are doing exactly the same
[00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:09.520]   thing you're doing. Now all you have to do is go to Florida and golf and drive your Mercedes around
[00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:13.200]   West Palm Beach, Florida, where I live. It just seems like a stupid way to live to me,
[00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:18.800]   but that's what our society is built on. Yeah, it's just a cycle. One of the things that always
[00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:23.440]   drives me nuts is the whole thing, you work until 65 and then everybody tells you you have to have
[00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:31.440]   like 80% of your last year's earnings to retire or something. I always think, "Really? When you're
[00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:38.720]   like that old, you need 80% of your maximum earnings? What do you need all that money for
[00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:47.760]   then?" I don't know. Our lifestyle has shown us that we really don't need that much. I certainly
[00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:54.800]   don't need 80% of this huge number to be earning that much in my investments and everything else
[00:12:54.800 --> 00:13:05.840]   at 65. I can live a real fulfilling and fun and exciting life unless. I don't know. It's just a
[00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:12.240]   different way and we've managed to find it. I ran your numbers one time off your budget.
[00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:17.280]   It's got to be one of the most visited pages on your website. You put on there your budgets for
[00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:22.000]   your sailing trip, your driving the Americas, your Mexico sailing trip, and now your current
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:28.160]   costs for your RVing. I went through one time and I ran the numbers. I'm doing this off the top of
[00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:32.160]   my head, so if you know the averages, let me know. One thing that's clear from your writing is you're
[00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:46.400]   not exactly a penny pincher. You seem to spend freely on anything that comes in a plastic bag
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:52.720]   that you can eat and anything that comes in a bottle. I say that tongue in cheek, but with a
[00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:58.320]   chuckling thing. You don't have any problem spending on food or spending on things that
[00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:03.680]   you want to do. You don't seem to try to worry too much about stressing about a specific budget,
[00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:09.120]   but it's hard to spend that much money when you don't have a lot of place to put stuff and you
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:13.760]   don't own a car and don't own a cell phone. I went through your budget even for your sailing
[00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:18.960]   trip. The way it comes across in your writing, you went down and you bought an almost brand new boat.
[00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:26.240]   You paid almost $160,000 for that. You sailed it for four years, was it?
[00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:28.720]   Yeah. Four years all around the world,
[00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:32.880]   down to Australia, New Zealand, all through Africa, the Mediterranean, back to the US.
[00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:39.760]   You had massive boat problems. You sank, what was it, 30,000, 40,000 bucks into fixing the boat in
[00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:41.280]   New Zealand? Yeah.
[00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:48.640]   So then I took it and I pulled out your ending, what you sold the boat for, and I calculated that
[00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:54.080]   your total monthly budget, including depreciation on the boat and repairs, came to something like
[00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:58.240]   $4,000 a month, right? Yeah, I think so. That's about it.
[00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:02.400]   And that included the flights, that included everything. It was somewhere between $4,000
[00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:07.280]   a month, including depreciation on the almost brand new boat and your massive repairs,
[00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:13.920]   because the boatmaker screwed you. Yeah. Basically, I ran the numbers once too,
[00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:20.160]   and I don't have them in front of me, but without the big repair bills, the number is more like
[00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:30.000]   $2,800 a month. It depends on how you look at it. It's either high or low to live on, but it's also,
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:36.480]   at that time, especially on that trip, we were planning most of the time just to go back to work
[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:42.000]   and save money. So it was like we were really free spending. So we were spending as much money as we
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.960]   wanted, and we're still only spending $2,800 a month. And that was to see, I mean, we went to,
[00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:54.720]   I don't know, 45 countries or 50 countries. I mean, it was like, that was a massive trip.
[00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:57.920]   I don't know. It was four years.
[00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:05.280]   And we managed to do it on $2,800 without a month, without even trying.
[00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:08.080]   Right. I mean, without any effort, we were able to
[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:14.240]   spend under $3,000. Do you remember what you sold that boat for when you finally sold it? Or I think
[00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:20.240]   you listed it publicly. If you didn't, let me know. Yeah, I think it was $140. Yeah, it was $140.
[00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:26.320]   So we bought the boat for $157, sold it for $140. And if we hadn't had all those problems.
[00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:32.800]   And that was the other thing is that I think, so I've never sailed. I'm intimidated by sailing.
[00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:40.320]   But I think, how could you spend $160,000, $157,000 on a boat? And I mean, you basically
[00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:46.640]   went and did it in a weekend. But when you come back with a sailboat, you had $17,000 of
[00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:53.200]   depreciation plus the 30 grand of repairs. So you wound up with $47,000 of costs spread out over four
[00:16:53.200 --> 00:17:00.320]   months. Right, about $1,000 a month, right? Right, exactly. And I couldn't believe it. And then
[00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:06.960]   so then your next adventure after your trip across the country, you bought the Volkswagen, right?
[00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:07.840]   Yeah. Yeah.
[00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:12.880]   And you bought this fancy, epic looking Volkswagen van. And you spent, let's see,
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:18.320]   I'm looking here at your page, 60,000 miles, 525 days on the road. And you probably averaged about
[00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:22.560]   $2,500 a month of expenses for that, right? Yeah, that's about right.
[00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:26.160]   Somewhere in that. And then your next sailboat, you got wiser.
[00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:31.760]   Oh, yeah, let's not forget on the VW bus. So we paid $22,000 for that. Fully restored,
[00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:37.680]   you know, really nice. And then we sold it in England for 15,000 pounds. So basically,
[00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:42.160]   it was roughly the exact same price. So it cost us, we drove it 60,000 miles,
[00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:48.480]   beat the crap out of it, and then sold it. You and your wife certainly have a penchance
[00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:52.160]   for old fashioned vehicles that keep you up underneath them, though, don't you?
[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:55.040]   Yeah, we love it, man. You like style.
[00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:57.920]   Yeah, we do. It's fun. So I won't go through, I mean, every number,
[00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:02.800]   but just for the sake of time, but it's certainly, I would point people towards the budgets, because
[00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:08.320]   the key is, and it took a while for me to figure it out, living a standard lifestyle is expensive,
[00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:15.680]   and you're locked in. But living a non-traditional lifestyle, if you can eliminate the expenses of
[00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:20.640]   the standard lifestyle, going on vacation in the United States is expensive, because you have all
[00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:25.200]   your current costs, but then you have your vacation costs on top of them. But if you can adjust to an
[00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:31.040]   adventure, then it can really cut your costs. Yeah, for sure. Most people, when they take a
[00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:36.240]   week vacation, they'll spend what we do for two months of steady traveling.
[00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:42.800]   So I didn't mean to steal the limelight. I want to go back to getting started in trading. In the
[00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:48.000]   end of your book, Live on the Margin, you told the story, you said that you got started, you were
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:54.800]   making basically minimum wage, something like that, and you got your bank set up by selling
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:58.320]   a pickup truck and using that money for trading. Is that true?
[00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:05.840]   Yeah, that's totally true. I started out as a pit reporter. Basically, I watched the traders make a
[00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:09.520]   trade, and then I called it into my little headphone, and then I got punched into the
[00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:14.400]   computer, and blah, blah, blah. And that was eight bucks an hour for four hours a day.
[00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:19.120]   That was like, I'm a college graduate with two degrees, and that's what I'm working for.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.480]   But yeah, you got to start at the bottom sometimes to get your foot in the door.
[00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:30.640]   And then I caught the attention of one of the brokers, one of the big brokers there,
[00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:37.360]   just for being a guy that looked like I gave a crap. And then I worked my way up from there.
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:45.040]   He was a mentor to me. And after about a year or two of learning, just following everything,
[00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:51.920]   and reading books, and being taught as much as I could, my wife and I, we sold my pickup,
[00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:56.240]   put $5,000 into a trading account, and she said, "All right, here's your shot."
[00:19:56.240 --> 00:20:03.360]   She'd been supporting us, essentially. I'm making no money. And so she's like, "Okay,
[00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:10.880]   here's your shot." And it just went up. It always went up from there. I never put any more money
[00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:14.960]   into it. And you were trading your own money. So when you went to Chicago, you weren't working for
[00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:17.840]   somebody, you were trading your own account. Correct, yeah.
[00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:20.720]   So is that still possible to do? Because I never even knew that was possible.
[00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:29.440]   Sure, yeah, it's possible. It's rare. It was even rare in my day, 10 years ago. But yeah,
[00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:37.680]   you can lease a seat. At the time, I think my lease was like $300 a month, to lease a commodities
[00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:47.360]   badge, and get in the pit and trade options. I think I had $50,000 to put in an account when I
[00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:52.640]   got to Chicago. I was able to trade in Minneapolis with a very small account to start, because I
[00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:56.080]   worked for a clearing firm. And they were kind of like, "All right, we'll let you slide on some of
[00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:59.440]   this margin, because while you work for us, we'll just keep your money."
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:00.240]   Right.
[00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:02.720]   Indenture servitude.
[00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:07.920]   Yeah, exactly. But yeah, you needed a little bit of bankroll before you got to Chicago and
[00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:11.680]   played with the big boys there. But yeah, it's totally possible.
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:16.240]   So how did you learn? Was it reading books? Was it mentors? Was it all of the above? Because
[00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:22.640]   I'm very interested. So I've never traded at all. And I want to talk through some of your book and
[00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:27.680]   some of the trading. I've always come from more of the investment background and primarily just
[00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:31.920]   working in financial planning, which has nothing to do with portfolio management. But I'm interested
[00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:37.040]   in trading. How did you learn from the beginning? If you were going to go back and redo it,
[00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:40.240]   how would you learn again to become a skillful trader?
[00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:44.480]   Well, definitely, I think the way I did learn was the best way. I mean,
[00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:51.600]   started from the bottom, worked my way up. There was about three guys on that trading floor who I
[00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:59.200]   thought were especially smart, especially successful. And I really tried to become
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:03.040]   friends with them and learn as much as I could from them. And I was also fortunate, because like
[00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:08.320]   I said, my boss was a mentor to me. And I mean, like on day one, he handed me this big, thick
[00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:14.800]   book. It's from Sheldon Natenberg, and it's called Options, Volatility, and Pricing, I believe. And
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:19.600]   it's a textbook, really. But it's all about options. And I mean, if you need to learn
[00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:24.160]   anything about options, it's in there. And I devoured it. And he quizzed me every day.
[00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:30.560]   And he just constantly quizzed me for, I don't know, for a year. I mean, we'd just look up at
[00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:39.200]   the screen, and he'd say, "Okay, what are the $6 calls worth?" or whatever it was. And he'd say,
[00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:44.400]   "Okay, what's going to happen if the futures drop a buck?" or whatever. I mean, he would just
[00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:50.320]   constantly give me these little scenarios and ask me what would happen. And I just learned that way.
[00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:57.040]   Is that something that becomes second nature over time, just by doing it?
[00:22:57.040 --> 00:23:00.080]   Like you kind of internalize the formulas?
[00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:06.240]   Yeah, I think so, definitely. I mean, options are all I trade now. I don't trade much anymore.
[00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:14.960]   But I do trade, and I still trade successfully. But I trade stock options now, solely options.
[00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:21.680]   And for me, it's just, I mean, I don't even think about it anymore. It's like riding a bike. It's
[00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:26.080]   just, it's options. But for a lot of people, just that word is enough to turn them off,
[00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:32.080]   because they just can't seem to grasp it. But I think if you break options down into the real
[00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:36.640]   basics, and you just kind of keep hammering away at it, it's something that you really can learn.
[00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:41.520]   I think a lot of traders could take advantage from trading options.
[00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:47.520]   So Pat, I don't believe you, because the markets are efficient, and there's not anything you can
[00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:52.400]   do to find an inefficient market. You need to just simply buy an index fund. So I think you're
[00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:56.720]   lying to me. What do you say to that? Well, I don't know. I don't think they're quite as
[00:23:56.720 --> 00:24:03.680]   efficient as people would like to believe. I mean, there is, there's manipulation out there.
[00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:11.600]   You have to kind of decide, I don't know what your, I don't know how to say it exactly,
[00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:17.520]   but how much risk you're willing to take on, and how much you can ride out sometimes.
[00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:22.800]   You know, you kind of have to be, sometimes you do have to be good at kind of seeing
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:30.800]   where something is acting. It's just not acting the way it should, you know. A stock might go
[00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:35.120]   down, and you're just like, well, that doesn't make any sense. You know, there's nothing,
[00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:42.560]   based on reality, there's no reason this should be happening. And in truth, I think that is true,
[00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:50.240]   that that can happen. So it is, it's something that you have to be able to ride out. I don't
[00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:58.160]   know. Do you track your performance in an academic way of some kind? No, I don't. No,
[00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:06.800]   I wish I did. But do you feel like, I mean, an honest feeling, I think you have the ability to
[00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:10.320]   be intellectually honest on an honest feeling. Do you have any sense of what your personal
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:14.880]   returns have been? Have they been in excess of the market returns? Oh, I think they've been
[00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:21.360]   very similar to market returns. I don't think I've ever really underperformed too badly,
[00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:27.520]   maybe a couple percent. But I've also had some really good years that are, that far outperformed
[00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:32.240]   the market. But if they've been similar to the market returns, then why bother with all the work
[00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:38.000]   of trading? Why not just sit tight and collect market returns? Well, I think that's, yeah,
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:43.120]   well, that's a good point. I mean, like I said, I've had some years that are significantly,
[00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:49.600]   and when I say significantly, I don't mean like the market made 10% and I made 12. I mean like
[00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:57.200]   the market made 10% and I made 80, that sort of thing. You know, sometimes, especially with me
[00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:05.760]   trading options, you can hit a big winner. And if you trade it right, you let it ride, maybe you can
[00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:11.200]   add on as you're making, as the trade's going up, instead of taking profits every time.
[00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:15.760]   Which is a hard thing to learn, because everybody's saying, "Okay, take profits,
[00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:22.240]   take profits." But sometimes you've got to realize the trend is still up, and you can buy more,
[00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:28.000]   and you can buy more, and you can ride it. I don't know. I mean, I have a hard time trying to
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:35.040]   teach trading. Because, you know, for me, a lot of it is just kind of, I don't know,
[00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:43.120]   I don't want to say gut feeling, because that really sounds ridiculous. But I don't know. I
[00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:49.520]   mean, I kind of put so many different variables together in my own mind. It's not just laying
[00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:55.600]   things down on paper and saying, "Here, here, here, and this is what I'm going to do." I don't
[00:26:55.600 --> 00:27:00.400]   know, it's hard to explain. But when I was in the pits, especially, I was what's called a short
[00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:07.440]   volatility trader. And when you're doing that, like, I'm basically short a bunch of options,
[00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:17.120]   and I want futures to essentially do nothing, would be my best scenario. But as futures would
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:23.440]   take off, if they go higher, at that point, I was supposed to buy in order to stay hedged. This
[00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:32.080]   might be too technical. But if I bought up high, and then the market tanked again, well, then I was
[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:38.720]   supposed to sell down low my future. So then you end up chopping yourself, you know, you're making
[00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:45.760]   some money on your options, but now you're losing it all because you're hedging so badly. And I
[00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:51.600]   think part of my thing was that I was able to kind of sit tight a lot and not make those bad
[00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:57.760]   decisions. I was able to ride things out a little better. And again, part of that was my situation,
[00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:04.960]   especially back then, where I really didn't have anything. And it was just me and my wife. And if
[00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:11.440]   we lost everything, you just start again, right? And nowadays, I guess my risk tolerance is
[00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:17.200]   slightly lower, but it's still kind of along the same lines. And I don't know. So I don't always
[00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:24.800]   advocating that everybody jump in and trade, but I am advocating that everybody learn how to trade.
[00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:31.760]   Because I think if nothing else, you're taking some control and learning something that's
[00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:35.760]   definitely valuable. I mean, everybody should know how to manage their own money and how to
[00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:45.200]   trade that money. It's interesting because in your book, you talk about exactly what you said
[00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:50.080]   as far as taking control of your money. And I'm no longer a financial advisor, but I come from
[00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:57.120]   that background. And I've struggled with this over the years. I reached the conclusion when I was
[00:28:57.120 --> 00:29:04.800]   managing portfolios that the only rational thing that a financial advisor can do as far as managing
[00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:11.600]   portfolios is help clients control their emotions. And if you're going to hire a portfolio manager,
[00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:16.480]   you have to trust your portfolio manager to do the trading. And so my job as the in-between
[00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:21.680]   between clients was to help them manage their emotions. But I also came to the conclusion and
[00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:27.680]   basically buy and hold and commit to holding no matter what happens. But that's exactly the
[00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:33.520]   opposite. You lampoon that in your book. But I've come to the conclusion, and feel free to disagree
[00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:39.120]   with me. I'm asking the question because I invite your comment. I've come to the conclusion that it
[00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:43.360]   very much depends on what type of person you are. And the type of person who's going to be a
[00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:48.480]   successful trader is the kind of person that's going to more likely to listen to everyone say,
[00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:51.840]   "You can't beat the market. You just got to buy and hold. You can't beat the market." It's going
[00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:56.960]   to say, "Forget that. I think I can and I want to do it and be gutsy enough to go off and do it."
[00:29:56.960 --> 00:30:00.880]   And I don't know how to control for that because I think that in some ways,
[00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:09.600]   the advice to trade is great advice for certain personality types and it's horrible advice for
[00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:13.920]   other people. And it very much depends on the personality type. What do you think? Am I wrong
[00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:17.760]   or am I right? No, I think you're exactly right. I think there are certain people that no matter
[00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:21.280]   how much they learn about trading, they're never going to be good traders. I mean, that just goes
[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:28.320]   without saying. They're emotional people who are just, you know, the second that market starts
[00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:34.240]   ticking down, they're in full panic mode and then it gets down a little bit more and they just sell
[00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:39.760]   everything. And then of course, it just reverses and goes back up. And they're the ones that,
[00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:43.520]   like I said, they chop themselves up. They're selling low, they're buying high because they
[00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:51.200]   can't ride anything out. They just have that fear. And again, I still think everybody needs
[00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:54.400]   to learn how to trade. Even those people, I think, should learn how to trade. I just think it's a
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:31:00.400]   valuable thing to know. And plus, we should all learn things that we're that are uncomfortable
[00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:08.320]   with. I think everybody should be learning all the time. But those people also shouldn't be putting
[00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:16.960]   all their money in trading everything. You can definitely learn how to trade without putting a
[00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:22.960]   lot of money at risk. Go ahead. How would you pursue if someone wanted to learn how to trade
[00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:28.720]   in addition to buying your book? Would you recommend they go out and buy options, volatility,
[00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:33.920]   and pricing? Or how would you teach someone to trade? Just an average person listening to this
[00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:38.560]   show that says, "Hey, I want to live in an RV and travel full time for the last 10 years and be with
[00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:43.200]   my kids and make money in stocks." How would you encourage someone to learn how to trade today?
[00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:48.000]   Yeah. Well, I think the easiest way, for the average person that's never made a trade,
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:53.920]   that they've got a 401(k) or whatever and might have had to pick a couple of different
[00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:59.360]   mutual funds or something over the years, but that's about it. Those people, I think,
[00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:04.160]   they should open a small account, something they're comfortable with putting at risk,
[00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:08.960]   and trade stocks. I don't think everybody should just immediately start trading options. I think
[00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:14.320]   you need to just learn how to actually make trades, how to navigate your way around the website,
[00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:19.200]   whichever broker you choose to use, and just learn to make a few small trades.
[00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:27.360]   I also think, when I say that, I don't mean pick some wild penny stock that you've never heard of
[00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:32.400]   before or some company that you know nothing about, but a friend of a friend told you about it. I
[00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:39.120]   think it's important for people to pick a few, I say pick 10 to 20 stocks, things that you use
[00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:47.920]   every day, things that you're happy with, brands that you're happy with. I'll throw this out. If
[00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:52.880]   you eat at McDonald's every day for lunch, there must be a reason for that. You must like them,
[00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:57.600]   and you must be happy with the service or whatever it is. I don't know exactly, but
[00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:03.200]   you must be happy about that company and also, so great, so buy a little bit.
[00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:09.040]   But then you're also able to watch and see how things change over time. If all of a sudden,
[00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:16.160]   you're looking at it and you're like, "Wow, this menu isn't changing. They're not adding such and
[00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:23.200]   such and doing this or that," you're able to see things and make decisions based on your real
[00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:32.640]   actual world experience versus trying to play catch up by doing research online, following the
[00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:37.440]   news on some company that you really have just, you can't even conceive of how they are actually
[00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:42.800]   making money, some semiconductor business or something. What does the average Joe really
[00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:49.200]   know about any of these companies or how they work? You don't. So you choose a few companies
[00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:54.160]   that you're comfortable with and that you use on a daily basis, and you get into it that way,
[00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:56.880]   I think is the easiest way. It seems like
[00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:03.200]   we're doing a lot of just thinking lately about why we don't learn to trust ourselves.
[00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:08.400]   It's a big subject, but it seems like in our society, we're taught not to have any confidence
[00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:17.360]   in our own ability to make decisions or to do anything. I felt this myself. I'm intimidated
[00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:21.520]   by sailing. I'm intimidated by mechanical things because I've never been effective.
[00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:27.200]   I've never felt confident with my ability to fix stuff, but somehow we're taught in our society
[00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:32.240]   and we're essentially conditioned not to trust yourself, but you have to look to an expert.
[00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:39.920]   I am increasingly coming to the opinion that there's a place and a role for experts, but it's
[00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:44.080]   probably better to learn to trust yourself and learn something about it. A good place to start
[00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:48.160]   would be to invest in what you know. Yeah. I don't know if I've always been
[00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:52.160]   that kind of person that's willing to just jump into things. I guess I have been, but
[00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:59.360]   you learn all these things and then you're able to put them into practice. I'm visiting my mother
[00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:05.200]   right now and her central vacuum had stopped working. She's like, "Oh, the vacuum's broken.
[00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:12.560]   That's it. We're screwed." I went down in her basement and I looked at this big contraption
[00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:17.520]   and I took it apart. I was like, "Okay, I guess here's a motor. I'll take that out."
[00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:25.120]   I ended up putting a new motor in it and it works again. Why would I have ever known to do that?
[00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:30.320]   We're so ingrained to just, "Oh, that's broke. I couldn't possibly. What do I know about that? I
[00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:34.880]   couldn't do anything," instead of just learning how to do it or just jumping in and figuring it
[00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:40.000]   out. I think the same thing like we were talking about with the stocks. If you pick something that
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:45.680]   you know, then you can be confident in your own decisions. Whereas, if you pick a company you have
[00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:51.920]   no idea about, you don't know anything about it, then any decision you do make is going to be based
[00:35:51.920 --> 00:36:00.240]   solely on other people. A lot of people like that. They want to be told. If you go online these days
[00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:06.000]   and you type in any stock, you're going to get wild opinions for bullish and you're going to get
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:10.720]   wild opinions for bearish on every stock. How do you choose? You have to know.
[00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:19.520]   I think, and I regret some of my own conditioning. When I was younger and I was studying,
[00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:26.400]   no one came alongside me and told me, "Josh, be self-confident. Why don't you pick some?"
[00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:31.120]   Just start having some fun with some companies that you individually think are going to be good.
[00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:36.720]   I was so brainwashed by personal finance books that I can't possibly have an opinion. I can't
[00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:42.480]   possibly have an idea that would be helpful. I'm not smart enough to do this. If the mutual fund
[00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:47.440]   managers can't beat the market, why are you doing it? You should go and just focus on something
[00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:52.400]   else. When I look back at it, now clearly, we remember the things that we would have gotten
[00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:56.800]   well and it's easy to have survivorship bias and confirmation bias. Seriously.
[00:36:56.800 --> 00:37:01.840]   I look back and there have been a number of times when I have felt very strongly,
[00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:07.520]   "This is a company." I think Chipotle, for example. Chipotle was something that the instant
[00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:11.920]   I went to Chipotle for the first time and I heard all of my friends raving about it, I said,
[00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:17.120]   "This is a company that's going to be incredibly successful. My wife and I go out of our way to
[00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:22.880]   eat there whenever we can. That should tell me something." But I didn't have the confidence
[00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:28.160]   to act on it and to move on it. That's a perfect example of what I'm saying.
[00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:33.600]   The company that you go, "Wow, this is great. I love this company. I want to invest in it."
[00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:40.480]   And then if all of a sudden you're like, "Wow, every bite of meat you're getting is all fatty
[00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:43.920]   and gross or something," you're going, "Okay, something's changed. Our quality control is off.
[00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:47.840]   I'm going to get out of this. Something's not the same as it was back then."
[00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:52.560]   But otherwise, you're just riding it up because you're like, "This is still a great company."
[00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:56.960]   I've been thinking about how I can teach my son. I have a son who's almost one year old
[00:37:56.960 --> 00:38:00.880]   and I've been thinking, "Okay, how am I going to teach him to invest?" I've been exactly what
[00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:05.600]   you're saying, trying to think through what are the companies that he's likely to know from an
[00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:10.800]   early age? What are the brands that he's likely to be aware of? Then I'm going to buy him some stock.
[00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:16.000]   We're going to talk about that. We're going to use that as a teaching tool to say,
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:20.880]   "You need to pay attention to these companies that you're doing business with from a few years old on
[00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:23.120]   to help him think like an investor."
[00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:24.400]   It's a great idea.
[00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:33.040]   Your book title, the book that you wrote with your friend Nick Kelly,
[00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:37.360]   what do you mean by "live on the margin"?
[00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:49.520]   In the book, we talk about going out and living your dreams, doing these mini-retirements,
[00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:56.320]   whether that's flying off to Bali to surf for a year or sail around the world or
[00:38:56.320 --> 00:39:02.560]   something much less ambitious. Everybody's got these things that they want to do and everybody's
[00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:10.080]   putting them off to 65, which then causes them to never happen. We're saying, "Yeah, you can do it.
[00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:13.360]   You can go out there. You can live on the margin." When we say, "Live on the margin," we mean
[00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:18.560]   we're talking about this is also a trading book. We're saying you can trade a little bit of that
[00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:23.520]   money that you're using and maybe you can extend your burn a little bit. We're saying
[00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:35.040]   you're spending X amount a month to live this dream. You've got Y. You've got this many months
[00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:42.960]   to basically do this. What if you traded a little bit of that money during this adventure, which is
[00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:50.800]   basically what I do. I don't trade all the time. I'm off doing all these different things, traveling
[00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:56.640]   all over the world and living all over the world and doing all these things. I'm only trading very
[00:39:56.640 --> 00:40:02.640]   rarely. I trade when I see opportunities that I think are interesting and also when I have time to
[00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:12.960]   feel like taking time away to actually do the trading. I'm not making enough necessarily
[00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:19.440]   all the time to cover all my expenses, but I'm making enough to extend my time out there.
[00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:27.120]   Now, instead of going back to work at 35, now I'm 40. Maybe I can go a few more years yet.
[00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:31.520]   If I keep trading and making a little bit of money here and make a little bit of money there,
[00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:35.680]   then I'm 45 and I'm still going.
[00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:45.280]   Tom: Running out of money is not the end of the world because if you look at the variety of
[00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:50.800]   experience that you've gained from doing things that are maybe non-traditional, there are always
[00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:56.560]   options. Once you've done it once, it's almost like you've cracked the code and you can pursue
[00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:59.360]   something else. If you look at people who are successful entrepreneurs, they usually have a
[00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:06.160]   string of failures in their wake and it takes them time. I personally feel sometimes like I'm on a
[00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:12.880]   mission against retirement, but it wasn't until I read a book. I worked as a financial planner
[00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:17.520]   and I couldn't figure out why isn't retirement working because I thought, "Well, retirement's
[00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:23.600]   easy." After all, I read Automatic Millionaire. All I need to do is just set aside 15%, cut out
[00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:27.600]   my latte factor, plunk it all into mutual funds, and I'm going to be set.
[00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:30.960]   Tom: You'll be done, man.
[00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:37.920]   Steven: I'm ready to go. I consumed all of these books and I just started looking at it and I said,
[00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:43.360]   "But it's not working for people." It really bothered me and I could never figure out why.
[00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:49.440]   Why is it not working? I read a book called Out of Print. I went back and I started researching
[00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:54.160]   the history of retirement. There's actually a book called The History of Retirement. If
[00:41:54.160 --> 00:42:00.720]   you're interested, I did a show on it. What I learned is that retirement was invented as a
[00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:07.200]   political solution to an unemployment problem. That's the whole basis of it.
[00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:09.200]   Tom: I'm sorry.
[00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:09.600]   Steven: Go ahead.
[00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:13.360]   Tom: Because people were already retiring earlier, weren't they?
[00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:20.400]   Steven: Throughout history, people have never retired. Retirement was always seen as something
[00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:26.160]   that was a negative thing. So the idea of being put out to pasture and not working
[00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:32.480]   was not an idea that most people wanted. And if you looked at what happened, and people worked
[00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:36.400]   from the time that they were born through death. They just simply pulled back as they got older.
[00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:42.640]   But primarily you can trace it back, and usually the person who's attributed to it is Bismarck,
[00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:46.640]   Chancellor Bismarck in Germany. And what was happening in that day, depending on what
[00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:51.600]   historical account, I still can't figure out what's the truth. I've heard conflicting accounts,
[00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:57.760]   and I haven't found any source that's academically rigorous to convince me of what it actually was.
[00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:01.760]   But it was either he was trying to eliminate some of his political competition,
[00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:08.000]   or he was trying to stave off extra socialism coming into Germany. And so he instituted a
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:13.120]   system of retirement in Germany. But in the U.S., if you trace back the history of retirement,
[00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:18.240]   it goes largely back to the Great Depression, where you had a period of high unemployment,
[00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:22.240]   and it was generally thought that that unemployment was going to be a systemic
[00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:28.960]   problem going forward. And so how do we lower the unemployment numbers? Well, we take workers out
[00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:34.480]   of the numerator or the denominator, whatever it is. And that way we can lower the percentages.
[00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:39.120]   But the people didn't buy it. And so then as productivity increased from, again,
[00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:43.920]   these are some of the academic research, and I'm not 100% confident on this, yes, but you could get
[00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:48.240]   more work per hour out of the workers, but you couldn't get it out of the older workers. So then
[00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:53.120]   mandatory retirement came in at 65, and people protested and protested and protested. And it
[00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:59.680]   wasn't until about the 1950s when the idea of marketing retirement as a golden age of leisure
[00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:07.920]   came about. And this whole societal transformation has happened since about the 1950s, when Florida,
[00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:12.640]   going down and playing golf at Florida in about the 1950s became a doable thing.
[00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:18.000]   So throughout history, retirement was seen as a curse, and now it's seen as the ultimate goal.
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:23.680]   And so then everybody feels guilty about, "I have to be saving for retirement. If I'm not saving for
[00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:28.320]   retirement, I feel guilty." And then all the money's locked away in qualified accounts.
[00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:33.680]   And it just seems like the perfect storm of, some people are perfectly happy, but many people are
[00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:37.280]   completely miserable, and they don't trust themselves enough to change, because I'm going
[00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:44.080]   to fall behind on retirement. And it doesn't seem like the joy of life is quite there. And that's
[00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:49.760]   just been my observation. In your book, you said, I'm quoting, "The fact of the matter is this,
[00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:52.560]   you can always make more money, but you can't make more time."
[00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:55.680]   Right. It's true, isn't it?
[00:44:55.680 --> 00:44:56.080]   It is.
[00:44:56.080 --> 00:45:06.720]   Yeah. I'm really trying to live those words. I lived my entire 30s just traveling, having fun,
[00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:13.440]   doing amazing things, writing. I would have never written two books. I would have never written
[00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:18.160]   dozens of magazine articles. I would have never done any of that. So I learned an entirely new
[00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:25.200]   skill. I met countless amazing people. And another great thing about traveling is you meet all these
[00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:28.400]   different people that are doing the same thing, and you're like, "Oh, geez, how do they do it?"
[00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:35.200]   You learn all these different ways of making it in the world that you would have never been exposed
[00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:39.680]   to just going to your job every day and being around the same people every day.
[00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:49.920]   But yeah, I completely erased my 30s without actually working a job. And I love it because
[00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:58.240]   I'm like, "I can always make more money." When I'm 60, whatever, however old I am, I can work.
[00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:06.480]   I might not make a ton of money, but I can work and I can get by. I don't know. Things will be
[00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:14.320]   okay. They will. And two quotes I want to read from your work. One was from your book, Bum Puzzle,
[00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:18.080]   and you may have put it in a blog post, but I just wrote it down when I was reading the book.
[00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:22.160]   You said, "It's too bad everyone waits until old age to go sailing."
[00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:27.920]   Tell me about your battle with the cruising community.
[00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:34.240]   Well, I don't know. I was younger then. I was a little more cheeky.
[00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:37.360]   Yeah, I've sensed that over the years.
[00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:45.200]   I mean, the cruising community is largely much older. It's the people that I'm kind of saying
[00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:52.800]   right now. I'm saying, "You're doing it wrong," but that's how they all did it. And I don't know.
[00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:59.920]   But that's one of those things, sailing around the world. It's not easy. It's physically
[00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:06.720]   challenging all the time. It's mentally challenging. And you're walking through these
[00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:13.440]   countries. You're really putting yourself out there. And it's like, man, it's so much easier
[00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:21.920]   as a 30-year-old or whatever to be doing this than it is to be doing this at 65. You're stronger and
[00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:28.240]   you're more vibrant. I don't know. So I was always like, "Gosh, it's too bad more people
[00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:34.000]   don't do this at 30 than at 65." Right. And you made a comment about
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:40.160]   in your book Live on the Margin, spearfishing at 90. When was the last time you saw an active
[00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:45.040]   90-year-old out spearfishing? And then I want to read one paragraph. You said, "We certainly aren't
[00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:50.240]   ageist or think that as we age, we become less capable. We don't believe that at all. But if we
[00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:54.800]   had a dollar for every time one of these older cruising couples said to us, 'You guys are doing
[00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:59.520]   it right. We wish we had done this at your age,' we would be eating a lot more steak and a lot less
[00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:04.880]   hamburger. Let's listen to our elders. If they say, 'Go when you are young,' then let's believe them."
[00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:09.920]   Yeah. Yeah. I mean, how many of those people are like, "Well, yeah, not one person ever said,
[00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:17.600]   'You're doing it wrong.' Like, wow, that's stupid. Why would you do such a thing when you're young?
[00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:22.800]   I mean, that's just silly. Not one person out there ever said that." The people back home that
[00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:28.880]   were plugging away, still on the treadmill, sure. I'm sure a lot of them thought that. They're like,
[00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:34.880]   "Boy, you're making a mistake. You're not going to be able to retire when you're 55 now." But
[00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:38.960]   the people that are actually out there doing it, they're like, "Man, that's right. That's the way
[00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:45.920]   to do it." I think some of the most valuable literature we don't read enough of is what
[00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:53.520]   are the people who are old and about to die, what do they say? It's certainly striking when you see
[00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:58.960]   that how little of a place most of the things that we, when we're younger, are obsessed with
[00:48:58.960 --> 00:49:04.000]   have in what they say and how much it's all about not regretting, living without regrets.
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:10.720]   Yeah. Yeah. And again, going back to the ageist thing, I hate this conversation often. It starts
[00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:17.200]   to sound like we're ageist, but the numbers are there. I mean, how many people, I don't know exact
[00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:24.960]   numbers, but it's like 75% of us are even going to live to 65. And of those 75%, how many are
[00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:30.640]   actually going to be physically capable still to do these adventurous things, their lifelong dreams?
[00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:36.720]   There's only a fraction of those that are going to be able to. So, I mean, your odds, if you wait
[00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:41.840]   to 65 to do the things that you always wanted to do, the odds of that happening are slim. And it's
[00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:47.280]   not because I'm just saying that. It's because that's the way life is. That's the real numbers.
[00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:56.080]   That's our bodies. That's life. Statistically, yeah, it is. You have lived on a sailboat
[00:49:56.080 --> 00:50:04.640]   in a Volkswagen van and in an apartment and in an RV. Which have you enjoyed the most? Sailing,
[00:50:04.640 --> 00:50:13.360]   RVing, the van? What have you enjoyed the most? Yeah. Well, I don't know. It's easy to say the
[00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:22.000]   land-based RV, the VW, and now we've got a 27-foot vintage RV that we travel around in, too.
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:28.560]   It's easy to say that because it's less of a challenge as far as boats, man. There's just
[00:50:28.560 --> 00:50:35.760]   no way to describe how much work boats are. Constant work. Engines and everything else.
[00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:40.160]   After we sailed around the world, I said, "Oh, never again. We're done with boats."
[00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:46.880]   And then a couple of years later, when we were pregnant with our daughter, we were like, "Well,
[00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:53.600]   that was a pretty good life for kids. You're on the water all the time. You're always outdoors.
[00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:59.280]   It's great." So we bought another boat and we did that for another three years or so,
[00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:04.560]   three or four years. We just recently sold that back to the RV. So I don't know. They both had
[00:51:04.560 --> 00:51:10.160]   their pluses and minuses for sure. But I don't know. We're having fun. We're having fun with
[00:51:10.160 --> 00:51:14.880]   the RV now. In a few years, that might change and we might get another boat. Who knows?
[00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:21.520]   It seems, I think at some point, we'll end up trying the boating thing. But
[00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:30.960]   I'm scared of just being bored. It seems really boring to me. Correct me, but I've never sailed.
[00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:38.480]   But it just seems like hours and hours and hours of boredom punctuated by a couple of minutes here
[00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:45.520]   and there of excitement and a minute or two of sheer terror. Yeah, it is. And that's part of
[00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:53.520]   the reason for me, boats are for going somewhere. Otherwise, they do get boring. We ended up on this
[00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:58.320]   last boat staying in Mexico for about three years. And then that's why we ended up selling it at the
[00:51:58.320 --> 00:52:02.400]   end. It was like, "You know what? We don't really have a plan for a big sailing adventure now.
[00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:06.880]   We weren't really interested in going around the world again or anything on a boat."
[00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:14.320]   And so it just wasn't doing it for us. We ended up stuck in one place for a while,
[00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:19.680]   longer than we would have liked to. Whereas on land, it's like, "Okay, if you get bored at all,
[00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:25.200]   you just up and move. It's time you just go." So there is that.
[00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:31.440]   It does seem like if you want to travel a lot of miles and go for a long adventure,
[00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:38.320]   it's depending on what the cost of the boat is. It's hard to travel as many miles as cheaply as
[00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:43.760]   on a boat. I mean, if you want to go around the world, if you can sail, it seems like it would be
[00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:48.080]   the cheapest way to do it on the lowest budget if you are a boat person and can sail.
[00:52:48.080 --> 00:52:54.080]   Yeah. For sure. Yeah. I mean, you can get yourself on a good, solid monohull,
[00:52:54.080 --> 00:53:03.360]   ready to go around the world for, I don't know, $50,000, which is considerably less than what
[00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:08.960]   we did on our first boat. But yeah, it's definitely possible. And if you don't run
[00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:16.080]   into major, major repairs, which you probably won't on an older boat, you can live pretty cheap
[00:53:16.080 --> 00:53:22.320]   out there. Right. One other question on the money that I want to switch to and ask you about how you
[00:53:22.320 --> 00:53:26.320]   think about risk and fear. And we'll kind of finish up on that unless there's anything else
[00:53:26.320 --> 00:53:33.840]   that you want to talk about. Question is this. You and your wife found yourselves expecting a
[00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:38.800]   baby and didn't have any health insurance. Now, I've read a little bit of your report, but share
[00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:42.640]   with us what you did and some of the numbers involved as far as how to have a baby in an
[00:53:42.640 --> 00:53:47.760]   affordable way without health insurance. Yeah. Well, yeah, we kind of knew we weren't
[00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:51.680]   going to have health insurance. I mean, we'd been traveling forever, so we obviously didn't have
[00:53:51.680 --> 00:53:57.840]   health insurance in the States. It really wouldn't have done us any good. So yeah,
[00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:05.840]   when we got pregnant, we were in Argentina. And by the end, we were in, I think we were in France
[00:54:05.840 --> 00:54:12.960]   when we had the first ultrasound and we just walked into the clinic, paid $50 and an ultrasound,
[00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:18.880]   walked out. And then we ended up flying back to the States and we went and saw one doctor.
[00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:26.880]   And it was just outrageous. I mean, the price they wanted for everything, cash was just insane. So we
[00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:32.640]   said, you know what? We're off to Mexico. So we just loaded up our car and we just drove down to
[00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:42.000]   Mexico and had the baby down there. Yeah, it costs $3,000 for everything. That was all in, $3,000.
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:48.960]   And the quality down there was exceptional. We loved the experience so much that when it was
[00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:57.200]   time to have our second child, we went straight back. Same doctor, same everything. So yeah.
[00:54:57.200 --> 00:54:59.680]   >> That was $3,000 for a C-section, right?
[00:54:59.680 --> 00:55:04.880]   >> Yeah, for a C-section. Yeah. And a couple days in the hospital and everything, doctors,
[00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:10.240]   everything, the whole works, that was everything. That was for the couple months beforehand doing
[00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:16.640]   all these different tests and everything else. I mean, it's definitely affordable and it's doable
[00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:17.080]   down there. >>
[00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:24.640]   It just seems like to me, that's one of the, in my experience, I think a lot about how to help
[00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:31.280]   people get over fear. And I don't think everybody wants to live in an RV. I have a desire to do
[00:55:31.280 --> 00:55:36.320]   that. So I'm attracted to a lot of people who do that. But I don't think everybody wants to live
[00:55:36.320 --> 00:55:42.000]   in an RV. I don't think everybody wants to sail. But I think many people have certain things that
[00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:49.120]   they would like to pursue, but they don't. And I try to figure out why. And to the best of my
[00:55:49.120 --> 00:55:55.760]   knowledge, I currently have a list of three things that are key. Number one is people fear, what am
[00:55:55.760 --> 00:56:00.560]   I going to do about health insurance? Number two, they fear, what am I going to do about my kids
[00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:05.520]   and their schooling? And then number three, what am I going to do about my savings and retirement?
[00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:12.720]   And what am I going to do with that? And those three things to me seem so simple. Forget about
[00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:18.400]   the idea of traditional retirement. If you get old and broke, the government will support you
[00:56:18.400 --> 00:56:24.480]   anyway. So don't worry about that. I'll come back and I'm going to actually ask you if you
[00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:27.760]   have an opinion on school, but I think school is the worst place you can put your kids.
[00:56:27.760 --> 00:56:33.040]   So anything you do is better than putting them in school, because if you want to destroy them,
[00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:37.920]   put them in school. That's my opinion. And then health, there's so many options around the world.
[00:56:37.920 --> 00:56:43.760]   The rest of the world doesn't have the same problem we have. And I just was thinking, in the
[00:56:43.760 --> 00:56:49.120]   US, if you're having a baby and it's a C-section and I don't have health insurance, well, guess
[00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:55.120]   what? You got a problem. But there are other options. Yeah. No, we could have easily just
[00:56:55.120 --> 00:57:01.360]   gone bankrupt having a baby up here. Easily. But yeah, there's other options. And everybody's
[00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:07.040]   fearful of, not everybody, but a lot of people are just fearful of going to other places,
[00:57:07.040 --> 00:57:11.680]   going to other countries. I mean, we went down there. We don't really speak the language. We
[00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:17.440]   kind of do, but not great. And we were kind of on our way down to go to Mexico City. We thought,
[00:57:17.440 --> 00:57:22.640]   OK, we'll go to Mexico City. We like that. It's a cool city. I'm sure they've got great health care.
[00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:27.440]   They've got big hospitals. So what the heck? And then somewhere along the way, we ended up in
[00:57:27.440 --> 00:57:31.280]   Puerto Vallarta instead. And we thought, eh, we kind of like the beach better, so we'll stay here.
[00:57:33.360 --> 00:57:38.160]   And yeah, it was really not that difficult. Health insurance has never been a concern of
[00:57:38.160 --> 00:57:45.120]   ours as far as getting things done down there. If something catastrophic happens, yeah, well,
[00:57:45.120 --> 00:57:49.040]   I don't know. I don't know exactly what the situation will become then.
[00:57:49.040 --> 00:57:55.200]   Well, you deal with it when it comes. And yeah, you deal with it when it comes. And it's not that
[00:57:55.200 --> 00:58:00.880]   prudent planning is important, but sometimes I have a tendency to take prudent planning to the
[00:58:00.880 --> 00:58:07.680]   extreme where it binds you up. Yeah. Yeah. It can tie you down. Being overly prudent, it will just
[00:58:07.680 --> 00:58:14.080]   strap you right down. If you try to plan for every single contingency, you just won't go
[00:58:14.080 --> 00:58:17.680]   anywhere. You won't do anything because you can't. You can't prepare for everything.
[00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:26.160]   Do you have any plans for schooling your kids? Yeah. Yeah. We talked just recently. We kind of
[00:58:26.160 --> 00:58:31.520]   started talking about it more. We've been getting the question since day one, but what are you going
[00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:37.600]   to do? But yeah, no, we're not doing traditional school. That's a certainty. Yeah. We'll be
[00:58:37.600 --> 00:58:47.200]   homeschooling, doing some sort of program or whatever, but I'm not sure exactly. Unschooling,
[00:58:47.200 --> 00:58:51.680]   schooling, homeschooling, we'll be doing something, but it'll be us, and we'll be
[00:58:51.680 --> 00:58:56.560]   teaching our kids and showing them the world as much as we possibly can. I'm thrilled to hear
[00:58:56.560 --> 00:59:02.320]   that. Any option is better than putting them into the government school system. Yeah. I can't
[00:59:02.320 --> 00:59:07.200]   imagine giving our kids what we've given them and then saying, "All right, well, it's time to move
[00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:10.640]   back to the States, and I'm putting you in this school, and you're going to sit there for eight
[00:59:10.640 --> 00:59:17.360]   hours a day, and you are going to sit and not talk and not run around and not play, and that's it."
[00:59:18.480 --> 00:59:23.920]   I couldn't do that to them. It destroys your ability to live any kind of lifestyle that is
[00:59:23.920 --> 00:59:31.920]   affordable, because it's affordable in the sense of it immediately locks you into the US cost of
[00:59:31.920 --> 00:59:36.880]   living. It immediately locks you into traveling on holidays when prices are the highest. It
[00:59:36.880 --> 00:59:41.280]   immediately locks you into short-term travel instead of longer-term travel. It immediately
[00:59:41.280 --> 00:59:45.120]   locks you into needing a car to get them there and then needing a car to go to soccer practice,
[00:59:45.120 --> 00:59:51.600]   and it just locks you in. It's so simple to me, and I won't go deep in education, but
[00:59:51.600 --> 00:59:55.680]   when you start researching the history of education, you start understanding
[00:59:55.680 --> 01:00:02.160]   why the school system exists, and it has nothing to do with the great learning opportunities,
[01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:08.000]   then it's an easy one to get free of. Yeah. I think it goes back again to trusting yourself.
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:13.040]   We talked about it with stocks and with trading, but it goes back to you can apply that to your
[01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:19.120]   kids as well. Why do we trust somebody else to do this for us? Why can't we do it ourselves?
[01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:26.080]   Do you think you're an idiot? You don't think you're smart enough? Or you just don't want to?
[01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:31.040]   Or what is it? I don't know. Right. It seems like if you are in control,
[01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:35.040]   you can take advantage of some of the most amazing educational opportunities that have
[01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:38.960]   nothing to do with school, whether that's putting your daughter in preschool like you did in Mexico,
[01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:43.920]   whether that's going to... I'm interested in one summer and going up to New York and going to some
[01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:48.240]   of the Chautauqua conferences that they have, or going to the conferences and seminars where
[01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:53.360]   there's real educational opportunities. But once you're free of it, you can do it yourself.
[01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:57.680]   And an interesting idea on the schooling, and then we'll flip to the last thing and wrap up. But
[01:00:57.680 --> 01:01:02.800]   you ever notice that you can sue... If you have an attorney that fails you, you can sue that
[01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:06.640]   attorney for breach of contract. If you have a doctor that messes things up, you can sue that
[01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:13.600]   doctor for malpractice. But you can't sue your child's teachers for screwing up your kid.
[01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:16.240]   True. So true.
[01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:20.240]   That's anecdotal, but to me, there's something about it.
[01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:21.200]   Right.
[01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:26.720]   How do you think about risk, fear, and uncertainty? How do you balance those things?
[01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:37.600]   Well, sometimes I think I'm a bad person to ask that. Personally, I've always been able to take
[01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:46.880]   on risk and live with it without my heart racing, without my palms sweating. I've just been able to
[01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:52.640]   do that. And I know that everybody can. So it's really, I guess, about managing that risk and
[01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:58.800]   only taking on small bites. Like we said with trading, you start out small,
[01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:02.720]   you just learn the basics. You're learning and you're teaching yourself something and you're
[01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:07.440]   probably going to lose some money along the way. And that's probably not such a bad thing.
[01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:13.040]   But you need to learn to manage that risk and then to just kind of add on a little more and
[01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:20.720]   a little more and a little more, I think. Risk is how you're going to make real money. That's how
[01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:26.880]   you're going to outperform the market. So I don't know. I don't know exactly what the answer is with
[01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:34.720]   that, but start taking some on. Don't try to avoid all the risk. It might be the biggest thing.
[01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:43.280]   So it may be easier for an outsider to see sometimes how people think. So I'll share what I
[01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:49.520]   see in reading your writing and just reading your writing, basically. And I'm interested in it if
[01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:55.280]   you agree with it. But I don't think that you take on a lot of risk because I think with a trader's
[01:02:55.280 --> 01:03:02.160]   mentality, you're always thinking about how do I manage risk? And it seems to me that this is one
[01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:07.760]   of the great – we only have one word. It's called risk. And it drives me nuts because are we talking
[01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:13.440]   about standard deviation risk or are we talking about – like in looking at a portfolio. People
[01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:23.040]   have one word, risk. But to somebody who's comfortable with the actual factors going on,
[01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:27.600]   risk means many things. In investing, there are many kinds of risks.
[01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:33.280]   And I think, for example, entrepreneurs, people often view entrepreneurship as risky.
[01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:37.520]   I have never met an entrepreneur who isn't very risk-averse. I'm sure they exist.
[01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:42.640]   But the entrepreneur thinks about risk differently and they manage it in a different way.
[01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:49.920]   And I think that the same thing. I mean, to me, with no sailing experience, sailing a boat across
[01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:55.360]   the ocean seems risky, especially being out in the middle of the ocean seems risky. But every person
[01:03:55.360 --> 01:04:01.360]   I've ever met who is a sailor says that being out in the middle of the ocean is the safest place you
[01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:09.920]   can be. I experienced this when flying. When I'm flying in an airplane, a commercial airline,
[01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:15.760]   I get nervous and I'm listening to everything and I'm thinking, "Oh, this plane is going to fall
[01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:20.640]   out of the sky." But if I go flying in a private airplane, I have a brother-in-law who's a pilot,
[01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:24.000]   and I have an uncle who's a pilot, and a father-in-law who's a pilot, and they're
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:28.880]   very comfortable with the plane being on its side or going down or going up because they know where
[01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:34.640]   the margin is. So what I view as very risky, that unknown thunk, they're not scared by because they
[01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:38.480]   know exactly what's going on. >> Yeah. For me, I think a lot of it,
[01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:43.280]   I've always been a guy that thinks in terms of probabilities. I'm thinking of statistically.
[01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:48.880]   I don't know, for instance, when we were sailing through the Red Sea area,
[01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:58.800]   that's a pirate area, the Gulf of Aden there. But I knew that the year before, some 500 boats had
[01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:05.680]   gone through there, and of those, only five had been pirated in some way, just robbed or whatever.
[01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:13.440]   So I'm thinking, "Okay, that's a 1% chance of something bad happening." For me, at the time,
[01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:20.640]   especially with no kids, 1%, yeah, I can roll that dice. I think I mentioned on my blog at that
[01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:26.240]   time, I was like, "You know what? If somebody gave me an opportunity, they said, 'This has got a 99%
[01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:33.280]   chance of being successful,' I would dump everything into that. So why would I be afraid of
[01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:38.880]   sailing through that area?" And it's the same thing for flying in an airplane. Statistically,
[01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:44.800]   it's just obscene to think that you're going to crash. And you can apply that to so many things,
[01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:52.160]   just sailing around the world. It sounds scary and dangerous, but the reality is, statistically,
[01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:57.280]   you're going to make it. Even if your boat does sink, statistically, you're still going to make
[01:05:57.280 --> 01:06:04.080]   it. The odds just don't support the fear. YARO: And even if the worst case happens,
[01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:10.800]   you could rebuild. I think you are friends, or at least read the ... I think you're friends with
[01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:16.480]   them, because I think you said that on your blog, with the Rebel Heart boat. And I didn't ever read
[01:06:16.480 --> 01:06:24.240]   their writing until they lost their boat. But I've been fascinated by just reading and looking at
[01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:28.720]   what they've done. And the reality is, here's the worst case scenario that I think I could imagine.
[01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:34.080]   You're out in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. You're a thousand-something miles away from land,
[01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:38.160]   and everything goes wrong with your boat. Everything goes wrong with your communication
[01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:43.360]   system, and you've got a sick baby. And the worst case scenario happens. You lose the boat. They
[01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:52.720]   lost their boat. But thank God, they're all fine and their baby is fine. And he was ... I don't
[01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:55.280]   remember his name. Do you remember his name? ERIK: That's Erik.
[01:06:55.280 --> 01:06:59.200]   STEVE: Erik. Okay. So he was prudent. He was prudent. He had the necessary things that
[01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:05.040]   he needed, and their lives were saved. And at this point in time, it seems like,
[01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:09.520]   yeah, they lost their boat. And I'm sure that wiped them out. But you can just tell they're
[01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:15.600]   going to rebuild, and they're going to rebuild a lot faster. And you can make a great ... Yes,
[01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:21.920]   I'm sure it's incredibly disheartening that their whole dream was lost on the bottom of the sea.
[01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:24.800]   But it doesn't mean their dreams are over and doesn't mean that their life is over.
[01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:29.920]   Yeah, absolutely not. I mean, you can see, if you know them, read all their blog, you know that
[01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:36.720]   they're happy. They're thriving. They've got jobs again. Their kids are healthy and happy.
[01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:44.800]   But they're also ... They're living a very small life. They're living as small as they can
[01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:49.200]   to rebuild and get back to the point that they were so they can sail off again.
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:55.760]   And yeah, it was a dramatic, terrible thing. But again, it's not the end of the world.
[01:07:55.760 --> 01:07:59.040]   But they picked themselves up, and they're on their way again.
[01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:04.000]   Right. And in some ways, I just love hearing stories like that, because that's so much more
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:07.840]   meaningful than the people who just seem to have it all handed to them, and everything goes perfect.
[01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:09.840]   Yeah. Because life doesn't go perfect.
[01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:15.280]   Yeah. And I always talk about that, too. When people say, talk about ... Just keep referring
[01:08:15.280 --> 01:08:19.680]   to sailing around the world or whatever, or even just going and living on a boat, I always tell
[01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:25.360]   people, do it. And what's really the worst thing that's going to happen? You're going to decide,
[01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:30.080]   well, this isn't for us, or we don't like it. And great, okay, so you're going to sell that boat,
[01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:33.840]   and you're going to go back to doing whatever else you wanted to do. And you're going to be
[01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:40.560]   out of a little money, but you're not going to be broke. You're not going to be destitute. It's not
[01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:44.720]   going to be the end of the world for you. You'll be able to pick yourself up again, and you'll be
[01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:49.440]   fine. Right. And even if you are broke and destitute, you can still rebuild, because
[01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:54.240]   you still have your skills. And barring the loss of your physical health or your physical life,
[01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:58.800]   you can rebuild. Which is what's going to happen when you're older, much older.
[01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:04.480]   So do it now while you've still got all those opportunities.
[01:09:04.480 --> 01:09:08.640]   Right. I'll lob you one softball, and then we'll wrap, and then we're done.
[01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:16.720]   If you could redesign the American dream, and if you could speak to someone, like I'm sure you do
[01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:23.280]   when you meet a reader or a friend or someone, if you could speak to a young couple, a young family,
[01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:28.720]   something like that, what words of encouragement would you give them? And what would you tell them
[01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:35.520]   to do? And what would be your anthem of the American dream? The American dream. Basically,
[01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:41.920]   what I would tell people to do is save up some money, take that first mini-retirement, go out
[01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:47.280]   for a year, two years, three years, as long as you could, and go back to work and do it again.
[01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:52.320]   And every time, I think every cycle that you do that, all these different dreams and all these
[01:09:52.320 --> 01:09:57.600]   different cycles that you're going to go through, that you're going to need less as time goes on,
[01:09:57.600 --> 01:10:04.000]   but you're going to be richer. Maybe not exactly financially every time, but definitely through
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:11.120]   your life experiences, your connections with other people, your friendships, everything in
[01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:17.680]   your life is going to be so much better. And it's just go out and do these things, but don't
[01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:24.400]   just fall into this trap that we have to do things a certain way. It just doesn't have to be that way.
[01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:30.400]   Your website is bumfuzzle.com. Your books, one of them is Bumfuzzle, which is about your sailing
[01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:36.000]   adventures. Your other book is Live on the Margin, which is an introduction to the finance of living
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:41.120]   a slacker lifestyle and also an introduction to technical trading. And let's see, Twitter is
[01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:45.840]   Bumfuzzle, right? It is, yeah. Anywhere else online that you want people to find you?
[01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:52.560]   Oh, geez, I don't know. I'm on Facebook. It's @patschulte or Bumfuzzle. You can type in either
[01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:57.840]   one. I'm sure you'll find me. But yeah, check us out on Bumfuzzle.com. That's where we share our
[01:10:57.840 --> 01:11:02.080]   life and our experiences. It's all out there. Yeah. And I would encourage someone. It's one
[01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:06.240]   of the most beautiful sites on the internet. And just as far as you take great pictures,
[01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:12.240]   and there's tons of pictures. And there are 10 years of archives going from your original post
[01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:17.280]   where you decided over beer and pizza to sail around the world. And then you flew down to Fort
[01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:23.280]   Lauderdale, bought a boat coming up to current day in Portland. Yeah, it's all there. It'll take a
[01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:26.800]   long time to catch up, but you'll get there. Yeah. Pat, thanks so much for coming on the
[01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:29.440]   show. I appreciate it. Yeah. All right. Thank you, Joshua. I appreciate it.
[01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:35.280]   And that's the interview. Pat, thanks so much for coming on. I really appreciate it. I know
[01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:41.680]   it's challenging. It's challenging for you to find a time when you know where you're going to
[01:11:41.680 --> 01:11:46.000]   be enough to do Wi-Fi. We've been working on that interview for a long time, but I appreciate
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:52.720]   you're making the effort. I really do. It was awesome. I'm going to close this show. And I
[01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:57.040]   just want to take a moment just to point out some things that I've learned from Pat's story. And
[01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:04.080]   sometimes it's easier to see other people than it is to see ourselves. Even at the end,
[01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:08.560]   it's hard to self-analyze. And in our society, we're kind of taught that we're not supposed to
[01:12:08.560 --> 01:12:15.760]   necessarily look at ourselves too much. But here are some things that I've observed as
[01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:20.720]   general trends among people like Pat. And I just feel like many people would--not
[01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:25.360]   everybody, but many people would enjoy the type of lifestyle that he lives. Number one,
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:30.000]   he did have an idea of what he wanted to do from an early age. He said he wanted to be a trader.
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:34.160]   He would see them on TV and say that I wanted to do it, be a trader. That's great. If you have an
[01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:39.680]   idea of something that you'd like to do, don't suppress that. Don't say, "Oh, I could never do
[01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:44.960]   that." Follow it. Pursue it. See where it leads you. Next, he got a job at eight bucks an hour,
[01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:48.560]   but he didn't get a job because he needed a job during the money. I'm sure that he'd worked at
[01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:54.160]   many jobs younger in his life. He got a job which would be close to something that he wanted to do
[01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:59.520]   to get his foot in the door to learn something. If there's a company you want to work at,
[01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:05.120]   go get any job at that company and prove how great you are and get promoted 16 spaces up,
[01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:09.920]   you know, 16 levels up. But get a job close to something that you can learn about.
[01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:14.240]   So if you're going to work for a job, as many of us are going to need to do,
[01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:17.760]   at least stay in a job where you can learn something that's going to be useful for you.
[01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:23.920]   If you're working in a restaurant, view working in the restaurant as giving you the knowledge that
[01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:31.680]   you need to run your restaurant someday. Next, he built a stake. Now in his situation, that was a
[01:13:31.680 --> 01:13:36.720]   fairly modest stake. He sold a pickup truck for five grand. That was what he started with, trading
[01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:43.840]   off of. But he built a stake of cash. If you don't have cash, you got to get some. Now again, he had
[01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:47.280]   a truck that he could sell, he could build from, but if not, you got to figure out a way to save
[01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:52.000]   cash. That's why when I did that Walmart show on how to become a multimillionaire on a minimum wage,
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:56.400]   if you don't save money on a minimum wage, you have to, or there's no chance of getting ahead.
[01:13:56.400 --> 01:14:01.920]   You can't say, "Oh, I only make minimum wage, so I can't save money." No, you got to say,
[01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:07.920]   "I only make minimum wage, so I've got to save money." He took managed risks. And that's what
[01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:11.600]   all about trading, especially if you get into options trading. We didn't get into the technical
[01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:16.080]   details today, A, because he's written an entire book on it, and B, it's challenging to get into
[01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:20.720]   the technical details unless you even start with what are options. So I'd like to do some shows.
[01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:25.280]   It's not high on the priority list, but at some point I will do some shows on what are options.
[01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:29.440]   In the meantime, go read his book. But options trading is a way of controlling and managing
[01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:36.800]   your risks. He learned and studied a lot. Anybody who's going to sit down and read options,
[01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:43.200]   volatility, and pricing is a serious, dedicated student, and you can hear that. I guarantee
[01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:48.240]   he's read dozens and dozens of books from other people, and he was getting close to people and
[01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:52.640]   learning. So you have to learn and become excellent. You have to control expenses.
[01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:56.640]   And this is one of the things that I think investors often do better than most other people,
[01:14:56.640 --> 01:15:01.120]   or traders or investors, whatever. You have to differentiate the term, but in this case,
[01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:05.840]   it doesn't matter. If you're going to build a stake, you can't go and take that stake and blow
[01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:12.000]   it on a BMW. Now, if you made a million bucks this year and you want to buy a $50,000 BMW, fine. But
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:18.080]   if you've got $200,000, you can't afford to destroy your portfolio by going and taking a BMW.
[01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:24.960]   So it's very clear when you read his writing about his story, then it's clear that he controlled his
[01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:30.480]   cash, and they didn't necessarily -- they weren't super frugal. They weren't penny pinchers. They
[01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:37.680]   weren't extreme couponers, but they just didn't spend a ton of money. Next, notice that they
[01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:41.440]   followed their dreams. They didn't wait. They pulled the trigger and followed those dreams,
[01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:44.560]   not knowing where they would lead. And guess what? They led to different places than they
[01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:49.120]   thought they would lead. And now they have a multidimensional experience, multidimensional
[01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:54.240]   skill set. And over the last 10 years -- it's funny, we didn't talk much about what do you do
[01:15:54.240 --> 01:15:58.480]   if you run out of money. In some ways, in the beginning, to pique your interest, I said he
[01:15:58.480 --> 01:16:02.480]   retired at 30. Who knows whether he's going to stay not working or whether he's going to need
[01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:08.480]   to work. But the key is today. He spent the last 10 years, if nothing else, he spent the last 10
[01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:13.760]   years building up a huge website. He's got followers of his website that will enjoy meeting
[01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:17.760]   up with him all over the world. That allows him to save money. When he was working on his bus this
[01:16:17.760 --> 01:16:23.920]   last summer, he had a listener or a reader of the show that offered him the use of his garage for
[01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:28.240]   all the winter up in, I guess, Minnesota, I think it was, to work on his garage. That's something
[01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:33.520]   that would cost somebody money. But he's built up other kinds of equity beyond just financial equity.
[01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:41.280]   He's built social equity. And if he put out a note on his blog saying, "I'm considering
[01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:47.520]   taking a job of some kind," not a doubt in my mind he'd have multiple, multiple six-figure jobs
[01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:54.160]   offers to him within the week. And I bet you some of those six-figure job offers would be multiple
[01:16:54.160 --> 01:16:59.360]   six-figure job offers. Because what he's done is he's expanded his influence. He's put together
[01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:08.000]   a portfolio showing, "Here's what I did and here's what I can do." So even though he's spent the last,
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:14.960]   what is it, 10 years playing, so to speak, he's actually built a portfolio and built an incredible
[01:17:14.960 --> 01:17:20.400]   base that if he wanted a job, I mean, I guarantee you he could have a job offer for multiple six
[01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:31.040]   figures within a week. Other kinds of equity. And finally, it's clear from his writing that
[01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:39.280]   he holds the future loosely. I struggle with this one because I'm so much of a planner. I'm very much
[01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:43.280]   one of those people that wants to have everything figured out. And I'm learning just to hold the
[01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:48.720]   future loosely and see life as an adventure. Excitement comes from change. This is one of
[01:17:48.720 --> 01:17:54.080]   the things that seems to be missing. Excitement comes from change. It's more fun and more exciting
[01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:57.680]   to pursue multiple careers in multiple fields because guess what? Every one of them you can
[01:17:57.680 --> 01:18:01.760]   learn from. And it's way more exciting to have a new career that you're learning something in and
[01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:06.320]   being challenged in than to do the same old humdrum thing you've always done no matter how much,
[01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:13.120]   no matter how good you are at it. I want to close with reading two paragraphs from his book. This
[01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:18.160]   is from the first chapter of his book, Bumfuzzle. And again, strongly recommend, go and buy his books
[01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:23.680]   and read them. "On my last day of Friday, I walked into the pits and told a couple of friends that I
[01:18:23.680 --> 01:18:29.360]   wouldn't be there on Monday. I was done, and Ali and I were going sailing. Nobody really believed
[01:18:29.360 --> 01:18:35.360]   me, but the talk soon circulated around the pits and before long everybody knew. The trading floor
[01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:41.440]   is really a different world compared to an office job. Here the news was met almost universally by
[01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:46.160]   whispering behind my back, most trying to determine how much money I had really made on
[01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:52.240]   such and such trade and the others predicting my demise at sea. There were no pats on the back or
[01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:57.760]   high fives. When the final bell rang, I tore up my remaining trading cards and dropped them on the
[01:18:57.760 --> 01:19:03.040]   floor for the last time. As the pit emptied out and I was left standing there staring up at the
[01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:08.160]   blinking price quotes circling the walls, one of the largest brokers in the building walked up to
[01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:13.520]   me. He was a nice guy whom I had stood five feet away from for three years and made thousands of
[01:19:13.520 --> 01:19:19.920]   trades with, but with whom I'd never really just had a talk with. It was well known by the traders
[01:19:19.920 --> 01:19:25.440]   that he was worth north of twenty million dollars, lived in the ritziest neighborhood, owned a bunch
[01:19:25.440 --> 01:19:32.160]   of outside businesses, and drove six-figure cars. In these circles he was a god. He stood alongside
[01:19:32.160 --> 01:19:38.080]   of me, put his arm over my shoulder, and said, "I wish I had done the same thing when I was your age.
[01:19:38.080 --> 01:19:45.520]   Now it's too late, so I just come in here and hang out with all of you every day, day after day."
[01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:49.600]   We stood there talking for a few more minutes, and I realized that this guy,
[01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:55.040]   whom everybody held up on a pedestal, was actually filled with regrets. While everyone
[01:19:55.040 --> 01:20:01.200]   else was busy wishing they lived his life, he suddenly wished he could go back in time and live
[01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:06.960]   mine. There's a time and a place for everything. There's a time to buckle down and work,
[01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:12.560]   sacrifice, work overtime and study. There's a time and a place to pull off and relax and
[01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:19.120]   spend. There really is. There's a time and a place for everything. So just consider
[01:20:19.120 --> 01:20:26.160]   where you are and make sure you don't let fear and indecision keep you from pursuing something,
[01:20:26.160 --> 01:20:31.520]   if you know clearly that it's what you want to pursue.
[01:20:31.520 --> 01:20:37.920]   Thank you all for listening today. I want to finish today's show just with a special thank
[01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:42.080]   you. I pulled up iTunes just a few minutes ago just for fun. I check this about once a week or
[01:20:42.080 --> 01:20:48.640]   so and check to see how the show is doing. I was thrilled and humbled to find that
[01:20:48.640 --> 01:20:57.200]   we are currently listed at number eight in the new and noteworthy section for the business section.
[01:20:57.200 --> 01:21:07.840]   That is amazing to me. That's a very competitive section on iTunes to be in the business section.
[01:21:07.840 --> 01:21:12.160]   That's so humbling to me. That gives us a lot of exposure for the show. I want to thank you.
[01:21:12.160 --> 01:21:16.960]   It was through your reviews and your subscribing and your telling other people that that has
[01:21:16.960 --> 01:21:22.160]   happened. That's so valuable. iTunes is not everything, but the way this works is that
[01:21:22.160 --> 01:21:25.360]   when you launch your show, you can have up to eight weeks in the new and noteworthy,
[01:21:25.360 --> 01:21:29.520]   from my understanding. That can give you a lot of exposure. I have heard from several
[01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:37.200]   listeners who have found the show through the new and noteworthy. Thank you. I was even more
[01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:41.440]   thrilled to pull up the investing section and find that we are listed as number one in the
[01:21:41.440 --> 01:21:48.320]   investing section. That is awesome and super, super thrilling. Then I was also super humbled
[01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:56.720]   to pull up just the podcast section. Right now, the show is number 18, if I counted right,
[01:21:56.720 --> 01:22:02.720]   in all of the new and noteworthy for all shows from all genres. I want to thank you.
[01:22:02.720 --> 01:22:07.440]   I never would have dreamed that I could make it. I was hoping that we could get the show into the
[01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:11.440]   new and noteworthy for the investing section. I was hoping that it would be maybe potentially
[01:22:11.440 --> 01:22:14.960]   for the business section. I never would have dreamed we could be there for all podcasts.
[01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:19.840]   I want to just say thank you to you and ask you for your help. We're currently listed at number
[01:22:19.840 --> 01:22:24.800]   18. I would love to have a stretch goal of being able to get over into that first screen on new
[01:22:24.800 --> 01:22:29.920]   and noteworthy. That happens because of your reviews, your reviews and your subscribing.
[01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:35.520]   If you haven't left a review yet, I know I ask every day. It just pays me back so much. I want
[01:22:35.520 --> 01:22:39.840]   to read you a couple of these reviews and just tell you how meaningful they have been to me.
[01:22:39.840 --> 01:22:46.400]   Last time I read you, there was an interview called So Informative, a five-star review from
[01:22:46.400 --> 01:22:51.440]   India by Jason. For an in-depth look of how to get your financial life in order,
[01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:55.760]   you got to listen to this. Five-star review from the US, excellent, by Jay Rosen.
[01:22:56.400 --> 01:23:01.520]   This is a very detailed and thorough podcast about personal finance. It has helped me to improve my
[01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:06.800]   financial game tremendously. That means the world to me. Five-star review from, looks like,
[01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:12.880]   Seco, Florida. Action may be the most humane thing we do with the ideas in our head. Joshua
[01:23:12.880 --> 01:23:17.760]   Sheets' show provides the inspiration and practice to engage in action. Ideas are meant to be acted
[01:23:17.760 --> 01:23:24.160]   on and not just thought about. Look forward to the next episode. Hugely helpful. Five-star review by
[01:23:24.160 --> 01:23:28.320]   Tutu. Joshua does a great job preparing for and delivering insightful financial information
[01:23:28.320 --> 01:23:32.400]   without going too deep. Great podcast. Thank you. This one was super meaningful to me,
[01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:35.120]   and I want to read it to you. It's a US five-star review from Anesh.
[01:23:35.120 --> 01:23:39.840]   I have a meaning to write a review as I have obsessively digested this content over the
[01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:44.160]   previous three weeks. My life truly is different in three weeks. I've always been curious about
[01:23:44.160 --> 01:23:48.640]   lifestyle design, and I love how the host is able to look at finance from so many creative angles
[01:23:48.640 --> 01:23:52.880]   with the ultimate goal of freedom. Josh feels like a positive friend you wish you had, keeping
[01:23:52.880 --> 01:23:57.120]   you motivated to get your life in order. I especially appreciated the show on spin farming,
[01:23:57.120 --> 01:24:01.440]   as it gave me an idea I can immediately implement from my home. Now the trick is to convince the
[01:24:01.440 --> 01:24:05.920]   wife of all these amazing ideas. I've combined this content with early retirement extreme,
[01:24:05.920 --> 01:24:10.720]   mad scientist, and get rich slowly to feel very informed. And then, Josh, I appreciate
[01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:14.640]   your obsessive desire to continue to make the show better, but I reassure you the show is amazing.
[01:24:14.640 --> 01:24:18.720]   Please do not dedicate any more shows to explaining your philosophy of podcasting,
[01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:22.560]   because you already have so many disciples. You do not need to justify your approach any longer.
[01:24:22.560 --> 01:24:26.080]   Keep up the excellent work. I missed your daily shows during the conferences. The daily shows in
[01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:29.600]   the past kept me going." Anesh, that is so heartwarming, and I just want to thank you
[01:24:29.600 --> 01:24:34.000]   personally for that review. That's exactly what I'm trying to do. Podcasting is a very intimate
[01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:38.880]   communication, and every day when I do this, I just feel like, "How would I speak to my best
[01:24:38.880 --> 01:24:44.240]   friend, and how could I encourage today?" I love how you are taking the ideas that I'm sharing and
[01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:48.880]   combining them with other ideas that you have learned from other places. That's how creativity
[01:24:48.880 --> 01:24:54.080]   works, is take the ideas that I share. They're just my journey as far as me learning from other
[01:24:54.080 --> 01:24:59.040]   places that I have learned, and apply them in your situation. All financial planning has to
[01:24:59.040 --> 01:25:06.400]   ultimately be personal. And thanks also for the reminder to quit explaining philosophy of
[01:25:06.400 --> 01:25:11.200]   podcasting. You're right. I'm not going to do it anymore. It's clear that many of you are enjoying
[01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:14.960]   the show and appreciating it, and it's doing exactly what I hope to do. I'm not going to
[01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:18.960]   apologize anymore for the show, and if I do, you hold me accountable. So many emails say, "Joshua,
[01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:24.880]   quit." It's challenging because it's a growth of confidence. I've never done a podcast before,
[01:25:24.880 --> 01:25:30.640]   so it's hard for me because I don't feel like I'm very good at it. So then when you do that,
[01:25:30.640 --> 01:25:35.440]   you're quick to pull back and just talk about how you're not very good at it. But I'm done. I'm not
[01:25:35.440 --> 01:25:41.920]   going to do it anymore. Thank you for the reminder. Five-star review from Abby in the U.S.
[01:25:41.920 --> 01:25:51.760]   This is a great podcast. I appreciate the advice. Five-star show from GDURHUXHXH.
[01:25:51.760 --> 01:25:55.360]   The show is packed with great information. I wish it would have existed 20 years ago.
[01:25:55.360 --> 01:26:00.640]   You and me both, if it had existed 20 years ago, I would have been listening to it for the last 20
[01:26:00.640 --> 01:26:05.440]   years, and I would have been 20 years ahead of where I am. Five-star review from Chris. Great
[01:26:05.440 --> 01:26:10.560]   show to learn personal finance. Joshua presents many things that most other bloggers and podcasters
[01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:14.560]   aren't talking about in an accessible way for most to understand, especially find the emphasis
[01:26:14.560 --> 01:26:20.080]   on tax planning beneficial. Thank you, Chris. Yes, we're going to do a ton more on tax planning
[01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:23.920]   because that's one of the biggest expenses that we all face, and there are a lot of ideas. We've
[01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:29.600]   just set the basis, and I've got dozens more shows planned on that. Ian Farmer in Canada.
[01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:33.840]   Inspiring and informative podcast about the economics of life. I enjoy this show for the
[01:26:33.840 --> 01:26:37.360]   unique take on personal finance. I don't make a lot of money and haven't thought too much about
[01:26:37.360 --> 01:26:41.920]   saving or wealth in the past, so this is good for me to get introduced to personal finance.
[01:26:41.920 --> 01:26:45.760]   Enjoy the interviews with people on unique and creative paths to meeting their goals. Ian,
[01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:51.520]   thank you. I hope that you can continue to enjoy the creative approach and to design your own
[01:26:51.520 --> 01:26:59.360]   approach to finance. BJ, five-star review in the US. Best financial podcast. This is by far the
[01:26:59.360 --> 01:27:04.080]   best financial podcast out there. I look forward to Joshua's podcast every day and strangely don't
[01:27:04.080 --> 01:27:07.920]   mind my commute home. I've listened to almost every episode, and there are so many financial
[01:27:07.920 --> 01:27:11.520]   behavioral tidbits in each episode. I've recommended this podcast to many people and
[01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:15.680]   can't wait to follow the progression. BJ, thank you. That's what I'm hoping, is that every day
[01:27:15.680 --> 01:27:21.840]   this show will be here for you and to encourage you and keep you going forward on your goals.
[01:27:21.840 --> 01:27:27.920]   Finally, new one from Ivan in the US. Five-star review. Original personal finance content from
[01:27:27.920 --> 01:27:32.320]   an amateur. Great podcast. Original and intriguing. Thank you, Ivan. Just a special
[01:27:32.320 --> 01:27:42.320]   [inaudible 00:01:36] excuse me. Just a special request. This feedback, and thank you to all of
[01:27:42.320 --> 01:27:47.840]   you who've emailed me as well. This feedback is what I love it. It's just so thrilling to me.
[01:27:47.840 --> 01:27:53.040]   If you would, I would be really beholden to you. If you'd take a moment and leave a review on the
[01:27:53.040 --> 01:27:57.520]   show, it would help so much. We're almost about to be kicked out of the New and Noteworthy. It
[01:27:57.520 --> 01:28:01.520]   would be so thrilling to be on that first page of New and Noteworthy for all podcasts. We're at
[01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:06.560]   number 18 right now. If each of you would just leave a review and a rating, that would be super
[01:28:06.560 --> 01:28:12.480]   huge. Tell someone else about the show. I would so appreciate it. We'll be back tomorrow. I'm
[01:28:12.480 --> 01:28:17.520]   going to be doing a Q&A show. I've got some questions to go through. If you've got questions
[01:28:17.520 --> 01:28:25.200]   for me, feel free to shoot me an email. I still am trying to make the time to get the speak pipe
[01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:29.440]   installed on the site. Also, I got to fix the commenting system. If any of you are techie
[01:28:29.440 --> 01:28:34.480]   people and know how to do this stuff, I could sure use some help. I got to figure out how to go from
[01:28:34.480 --> 01:28:38.800]   live fire back to the WordPress without losing all of your great comments. I've just discovered that
[01:28:38.800 --> 01:28:43.760]   the comments aren't showing up. I got to fix that. If any of you guys have...I don't know.
[01:28:43.760 --> 01:28:47.760]   I guess I'm asking for help, but I don't know how to do it. I just am stretched with all the
[01:28:47.760 --> 01:28:53.520]   techie stuff. Thank you so much for listening. Come back tomorrow for some awesome Q&A and some
[01:28:54.320 --> 01:28:59.520]   interesting tidbits to send you into the weekend. If you enjoyed today's interview,
[01:28:59.520 --> 01:29:03.280]   I would love to do more interviews like this. If you have a favorite blogger, podcaster,
[01:29:03.280 --> 01:29:08.240]   or friend, if you have an interesting story, shoot me an email, joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com.
[01:29:08.240 --> 01:29:11.520]   I would be thrilled to bring you on the show. We can all learn from one another.
[01:29:11.520 --> 01:29:18.000]   The thing about the show is wherever people are at in the process, if you're making minimum wage,
[01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:23.200]   it's hard to learn a ton from somebody who's making 10 million bucks. I want to have people
[01:29:23.200 --> 01:29:26.320]   on the show that are making just more than minimum wage, but on the other hand, I want to have people
[01:29:26.320 --> 01:29:32.320]   making 10 million bucks so we can all learn. That's my vision. I'm just so thrilled that many
[01:29:32.320 --> 01:29:37.440]   of you are getting it and along for the ride. We've got good things in store. Have a great day,
[01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:38.960]   everybody.
