[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   Welcome back to the podcast.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.560]   Today we are going deep, very deep.
[00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:16.060]   Of course, at the center of our faith, we celebrate the cross of Jesus Christ, His horrific
[00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:19.960]   suffering and His death by crucifixion.
[00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:27.720]   Christ bore our sins in His body on the tree that we might die to sin and live to righteousness
[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.040]   by His wounds, you have been healed.
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.020]   That's 1 Peter 2 verse 24.
[00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.760]   His death was designed.
[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.080]   It was no accident.
[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.000]   It was no fluke of history.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.280]   It was no mere result of mob violence left unchecked.
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.440]   His death was intentional.
[00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:57.640]   It was divinely intended, intended from the very beginning of time.
[00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:04.760]   This is a somber and significant point to grasp from Acts chapter 4 verses 27 and 28.
[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:10.320]   This theological point matters when we look at the fallenness of this world, the brokenness
[00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.080]   of our lives.
[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.320]   Specifically in this clip, you're going to hear a mention of a massive earthquake that
[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.480]   hit Nepal in the spring of 2015.
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.720]   That earthquake hit the day before this sermon was preached.
[00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:33.600]   In that disaster, three and a half million people were left homeless and nearly 9,000
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.800]   lost their lives.
[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.160]   Why?
[00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:44.120]   Why does such a world exist with such deep pain?
[00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.500]   Here's Pastor John.
[00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:55.860]   This world exists with its pain, with its sorrow, with its death to make a place for
[00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:02.060]   Jesus Christ, the Son of God, to suffer and die.
[00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:10.500]   If a world like this didn't exist, Jesus would have no place to suffer and die.
[00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.540]   If there were no suffering, Jesus couldn't suffer.
[00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.220]   If there were no death, Jesus couldn't die.
[00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:22.140]   Put it another way, the reason there is terror is so that Christ could be terrorized.
[00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.180]   The reason there is trouble is so that Christ could be troubled.
[00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:32.480]   The reason there is pain is so that Christ could feel pain.
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:43.580]   This world became what it is so that the Son of God could enter it and feel all of it.
[00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:54.220]   Therefore, you should never feel that God is somehow out there, distant, far away, toying
[00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.140]   with this creation.
[00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:03.540]   He made the horrors to enter the horrors.
[00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:09.220]   Romans 5:8, "God shows his love for us in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died
[00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.220]   for us."
[00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:11.220]   Do you believe?
[00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:18.940]   Let me say it again, "God shows his love for us in that while we were yet sinners, Christ,
[00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.660]   his Son, died for us."
[00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.220]   He showed his love through the death of his Son.
[00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.300]   He showed his love through the death of his Son.
[00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:30.420]   Do you believe that love could be shown another way?
[00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.820]   That love could be shown another way.
[00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:38.460]   It couldn't, and he meant for it to be shown.
[00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:44.300]   Listen to these words from Acts chapter 4, "Truly in this city," this is being prayed
[00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:50.460]   by the saints after the death and resurrection of Jesus, "Truly in this city," Jerusalem,
[00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:58.700]   "there were gathered together against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed, Herod,
[00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:07.780]   Pontius Pilate, the Gentiles, and the peoples of Israel, to do whatever your hand and your
[00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.060]   plan predestined to take place."
[00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.500]   Do you hear what that says?
[00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:20.820]   Herod, who mocked him, put a purple robe on him, scorned him.
[00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:27.300]   Pilate, who expediently washed his hands and said, "I'll find no fault in him, but my job's
[00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:32.340]   at stake, and so kill him, crucify him, put him through the worst tortures imaginable."
[00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.420]   The Gentiles, that's the soldiers, they were driving the nails, pushing the sword in the
[00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:37.420]   side.
[00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:40.540]   "Crucify him, Jewish people, crucify him, crucify him."
[00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:46.740]   Those four things, this text says, I'll read it again, "Herod, Pontius Pilate, the Gentiles,
[00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:52.740]   and the peoples of Israel were gathered together to do whatever your plan and your hand had
[00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.220]   predestined to take place."
[00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.420]   Christ did not die by accident.
[00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:08.460]   Oh, just a fluke of history, just a turning of Roman affairs, just a mob violence.
[00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:13.080]   This had been planned since before the foundation of the world.
[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.460]   This is the climax of the reason for existence.
[00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:25.780]   The Son of God bearing all the suffering of the world in order to lift sin from all who
[00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:33.140]   would trust Him, bring them into everlasting reward and joy, exquisitely on a new heavens
[00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:39.860]   and a new earth, glorifying God for His wisdom and grace and love.
[00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:45.060]   That's the reason this world exists the way it exists.
[00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:50.260]   In my church, I still affectionately call it my church.
[00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.620]   I've been the pastor for two years.
[00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:59.540]   I feel I love her.
[00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:09.140]   There were a thousand young women, there were about 5,000 folks, and a lot of young people
[00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:11.060]   like here, right?
[00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:15.340]   And we grew up together, guys there for 33 years, and young people would come.
[00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:19.260]   And when you have a lot of young people together, they tend to fall in love and they get married
[00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:27.020]   and they have babies, and those babies die more than you would like.
[00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:34.020]   And some of them are born with profound disabilities, like Michael, thinking of Michael.
[00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:40.580]   And you got moms, therefore, who've just lost their babies or have now, their whole lives
[00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:46.380]   changed because they will be caring for this child until they're dead.
[00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:50.220]   And I just want to bear witness to you young people.
[00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:56.940]   I would welcome you to come to this church and interview any of them, like Patty, who
[00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:00.620]   you can't interview because she died of breast cancer.
[00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:04.140]   The first crisis was that Eric, her one-year-old, died in her arms.
[00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:08.980]   And I went to the hospital, she's sitting there holding Eric, he looks like he's made
[00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:14.540]   out of ivory, dead, sitting in his mother's arms.
[00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:17.500]   She just looks at me.
[00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:25.580]   And then I buried her about 15 years later, four kids, young kids, and she dies.
[00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:28.620]   It was a horrible death, in fact.
[00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:30.060]   Patty was a rock.
[00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:33.620]   Patty believed every word of what I said.
[00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:38.860]   With her bald head and her cap, she made a video about 15 minutes, 13 minutes, we showed
[00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:46.940]   it at a service, telling the people to trust God before she died.
[00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:51.060]   So I'm inviting you, work through this.
[00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:59.740]   If it sounds problematical, God could shake this city, not just Nepal.
[00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:07.340]   Half these buildings could go down at 10 a.m. on Monday morning and 100,000 people be dead.
[00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:13.100]   Do you have a vision of God that would be able to handle that?
[00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:18.780]   That's my question, which might be easier to handle than if one of your children died
[00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:21.540]   or if you had a child with a profound disability.
[00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:31.540]   I am inviting you to embrace Jesus Christ as the one for whom, through whom, and to
[00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:34.420]   whom all things exist.
[00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:36.900]   And He came to share this suffering.
[00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:39.440]   He came to bear this pain.
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:45.660]   He came to taste every test and every temptation that we have known, take it to the cross,
[00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:51.660]   die in our place so that by faith alone we could have all our sins forgiven, have eternal
[00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:58.500]   life and have a destiny on a new heavens and a new earth where that curse will finally
[00:08:58.500 --> 00:08:59.500]   be lifted.
[00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:05.220]   The sobering connection between the death of Christ and the suffering of the world and
[00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:08.840]   our display of treasuring Christ above all things.
[00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:13.220]   This was taken from John Piper's sermon, "The Pain of the World and the Purposes of God,"
[00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:20.700]   preached on April 26, 2015, the day after the major earthquake that hit Nepal.
[00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:24.020]   If you have remaining questions about this episode, that's understandable, certainly
[00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:25.020]   understandable.
[00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:28.540]   These are deep topics and it reminds me of a key theological point that Paul gives us
[00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:31.700]   in Romans 9.22 we should mix in here.
[00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:36.060]   And it just so happens to be the most asked about text in all of the Bible, in all of
[00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:38.300]   our listener emails, Romans 9.22.
[00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:42.460]   I mentioned that this summer in APJ 1827.
[00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:46.580]   But Romans 9.22 comes to the forefront in three other important episodes that you might
[00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:48.220]   want to check out.
[00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:52.220]   If God is so happy, why did He create the non-elect?
[00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:54.300]   That's APJ 547.
[00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:55.900]   Don't miss that one, 547.
[00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:59.540]   Also how is God glorified in those who reject Him?
[00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:02.980]   Another really important episode, that's APJ 1215.
[00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:07.860]   And see also why does God choose some and not others, that's APJ 1320.
[00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:12.580]   So if this episode today raises questions, you might want to press into Romans 9.22 and
[00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:19.460]   check out APJs 547, 1215, and 1320.
[00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:23.500]   While shifting topics now, do you have skills in your church?
[00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:28.820]   Like you're a mechanic or a carpenter or a doctor or a lawyer or a photographer and you
[00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:35.420]   feel like other Christians around you are using your skills unwilling to pay for them?
[00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:37.220]   Well that's the topic of next time.
[00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:38.540]   I'm your host Tony Reiki.
[00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:42.100]   We are rejoined in studio with Pastor John on Friday for that.
[00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:42.600]   We'll see you then.
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.600]   [END]
