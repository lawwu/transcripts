[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   - You mentioned shapers, Elon Musk, Bill Gates.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.340]   What, who are the shapers that you find yourself
[00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:12.880]   thinking about when you're constructing these ideas?
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.160]   The ones that define the archetype of a shaper for you?
[00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.760]   - Well, as I say, a shaper for me is somebody who
[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.880]   comes up with a great visualization,
[00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.440]   usually a really unique visualization,
[00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.600]   and then actually builds it out
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.320]   that makes the world different,
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.560]   changes the world in that kind of a way.
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.160]   So when I look at it,
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.400]   Mark Benioff with Salesforce,
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.440]   Chris Anderson with TED,
[00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.240]   Mohammed Yunus with Social Enterprise and Philanthropy,
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.280]   Jeffrey Canada and Harlem Children's Zone.
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.160]   There are, all domains have shapers
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.800]   who have the ability to visualize
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.200]   and make extraordinary things happen.
[00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.760]   - What are the commonalities between some of them?
[00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.720]   - The commonalities are, first of all,
[00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.960]   the excitement of something new,
[00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.040]   that call to adventure,
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.080]   and then again, that practicality,
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.720]   the capacity to learn.
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.040]   The capacity then,
[00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.400]   they're able to be in many ways full-range.
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.880]   That means they're able to go from
[00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.120]   the big, big picture down to the detail.
[00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.160]   So let's say, for example, Elon Musk.
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.760]   He describes, he gets a lot of money
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.360]   from selling PayPal, his interest in PayPal.
[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.680]   He said, "Why isn't anybody going to Mars
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.680]   "or outer space?
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.780]   "What are we gonna do if the planet goes to hell?
[00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.000]   "And how do we gonna get that?"
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.800]   Nobody's paying attention to that.
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.320]   He doesn't know much about it.
[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.200]   He then reads and learns and so on.
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.200]   Says, "I'm gonna take, okay, half of my money,
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.300]   "and I'm gonna put it in there,
[00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.480]   "and I'm gonna do this thing."
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:53.960]   And he learns, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.200]   and he's got creative, okay.
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.800]   That's one dimension.
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.280]   So he gave me the keys to his car,
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.120]   which was just early days in Tesla.
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.480]   And he then points out the details.
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.880]   Okay, if you push this button here,
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.560]   it's this, the detail.
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.520]   So he's simultaneously talking about
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.840]   the big, big, big picture.
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.720]   Okay, when does humanity going to abandon the planet?
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.200]   But he will then be able to take it down
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.520]   into the detail so he can go,
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.080]   let's call it helicoptering.
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.640]   He can go up, he can go down,
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.600]   and see things at those types of perspective.
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.400]   - And then you've seen that with the other Shapers as well.
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.940]   - And that's a common thing, that they can do that.
[00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.260]   Another important difference that they have in mind
[00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.920]   is how they deal with people.
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.080]   I mean, meaning there's nothing more important
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.960]   than achieving the mission.
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.040]   And so what they have in common
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.880]   is there's a test that I give these personality tests,
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.200]   'cause they're very helpful for understanding people.
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.520]   And so I gave it to all these Shapers.
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.080]   And one of the things in workplace inventory test
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.680]   is this test, and it has a category called
[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:07.820]   concern for others.
[00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.360]   They're all having concern for others.
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.040]   This includes Mohammed Yunus,
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.520]   who invented microfinance, social enterprise,
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.600]   impact investing, as Mohammed Yunus
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.400]   received the Nobel Peace Prize for this,
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.320]   Congressional Medal of Honor.
[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:29.120]   A fortune determined one of the 10 greatest
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.720]   entrepreneurs of our time.
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.780]   He's built all sorts of businesses
[00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.800]   to give back money in social enterprise, a remarkable man.
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.220]   He has nobody that I know practically
[00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.120]   can have more concern for others.
[00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.160]   He lives a life of a saint.
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.000]   I mean, very modest lifestyle,
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.080]   and he puts all his money in to try to help others.
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.920]   And he tests low on what's called concern for others,
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.040]   because what it really, the questions under that
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.660]   are questions about conflict to get at the mission.
[00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.520]   So they all, Jeffrey Canada,
[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.400]   who changed Harlem Children's Zone
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.680]   and developed that to take children in Harlem
[00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.960]   and get them well taken care of,
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.280]   not only just in their education, but their whole lives.
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.360]   Him also, concern for others.
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.480]   What they mean is that they can see
[00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.480]   whether though individuals are performing at a level,
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.440]   an extremely high level,
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.320]   that's necessary to make those dreams happen.
[00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.960]   So when you think of, let's say,
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.920]   Steve Jobs was famous for being difficult with people
[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.000]   and so on, and I didn't know Steve Jobs,
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.920]   so I can't speak personally to that.
[00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.600]   But his comments on, do you have A players,
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.600]   and if you have A players, if you put in B players,
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.640]   pretty soon you'll have C players and so on.
[00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.880]   That is a common element of them.
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.760]   Holding people to high standards
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:50.080]   and not letting anybody stand in the way of the mission.
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.880]   - What do you think about that kind of idea,
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.400]   sorry to pause on that for a second,
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.600]   that the A, B, and C players,
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.200]   and the importance of, so when you have a mission,
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.880]   to really only have A players
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.040]   and be sort of aggressively filtering for that.
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.160]   - Yes, but I think that there are all different ways
[00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.400]   of being A players.
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.960]   And I think, and what a great team,
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.620]   you have to appreciate all the differences
[00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.080]   in ways of being A players, okay?
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.280]   That's the first thing.
[00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:26.480]   And then you always have to be super excellent,
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:29.180]   in my opinion, you always have to be really excellent
[00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:33.680]   with people to help them understand themselves
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.000]   and get in sync with them about what's true
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.840]   about them and their circumstances and how they're doing
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.560]   so that they're having a fabulous
[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.880]   personal development experience
[00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.220]   at the same time as you're dealing with them.
[00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:49.500]   So when I say that they're all different ways,
[00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.360]   this is one of the then qualities,
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.240]   you asked me what are the qualities,
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.260]   so one of the third qualities that I would say
[00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:02.260]   is to know how to deal well with your not knowing
[00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:08.220]   and to be able to get the best expertise
[00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:12.140]   so that you're a great orchestrator of different ways
[00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:15.620]   so that the people who are really, really successful,
[00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:18.500]   unlike most people believe that they're successful
[00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.260]   because of what they know,
[00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:24.340]   they're even more successful by being able
[00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:26.420]   to effectively learn from others
[00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:28.580]   and tap into the skills of people
[00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:30.780]   who see things different from them.
[00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:34.180]   - Brilliant, so how do you, when that personality being,
[00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:36.740]   first of all, open to the fact that there's,
[00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:39.980]   other people see things differently than you
[00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:44.100]   and at the same time have supreme confidence in your vision,
[00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:46.680]   is there, just the psychology of that,
[00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.060]   do you see a tension there between the confidence
[00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:50.340]   and the open-mindedness?
[00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:52.980]   - No, it's funny because I think we grow up
[00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:54.980]   thinking that there's a tension there, right?
[00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:58.820]   That there's a confidence and the more confidence
[00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:02.340]   that you have, there's a tension with the open-mindedness
[00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:04.540]   and not being sure, okay?
[00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:10.380]   Confident and accurate are almost negatively correlated
[00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:11.900]   in many people.
[00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:15.700]   They're extremely confident and they're often inaccurate
[00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:19.140]   and so I think one of the greatest tragedies of people
[00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:21.980]   is not realizing how those things go together
[00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:25.980]   because instead, it's really that by saying,
[00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:30.380]   I know a lot and how do I know I'm still not wrong
[00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:35.260]   and how do I take that, the best thinking available to me
[00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.460]   and then raise my probability of learning?
[00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:41.380]   All these people think for themselves, okay?
[00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:43.340]   I mean, meaning they're smart
[00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:45.820]   but they take in like vacuum cleaners,
[00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:48.020]   they take in ideas of others,
[00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:50.640]   they stress test their ideas with others,
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.940]   they assess what comes back to them
[00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:55.460]   in the form of other thinking
[00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:58.140]   and they also know what they're not good at
[00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:00.240]   and what other people who are good at,
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:01.620]   the things that they're not good at,
[00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:03.300]   they know how to get those people
[00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:05.420]   and be successful all around
[00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:08.740]   because nobody has enough knowledge in their heads
[00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:11.420]   and that I think is one of the great differences.
[00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:15.220]   So the reason my company has been successful
[00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:17.900]   in terms of this is 'cause of an idea meritocratic
[00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:21.080]   decision making, a process by which you can get
[00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:24.620]   the best ideas, you know, what's an idea meritocracy?
[00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:27.660]   An idea meritocracy is to get the best ideas
[00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:30.060]   that are available out there and to work together
[00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:32.540]   with other people in the team to achieve that.
[00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:35.120]   (upbeat music)
[00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:37.700]   (upbeat music)
[00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:40.280]   (upbeat music)

[00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:48.020]   (upbeat music)
[00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:58.020]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
