[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.560]   I should like to call attention this evening to those words which are recorded in the first
[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:16.320]   chapter of the Gospel according to St. Luke, from verse 46 to verse 55.
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:23.640]   In other words, what is commonly called the Magnificat, the words which were uttered by
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:32.240]   Mary the mother of our Lord, after she had just listened to the salutation of Elizabeth,
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.680]   the mother of John the Baptist.
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:41.520]   And this evening, perhaps in particular, I would like to direct attention to the first
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.400]   part of this statement, namely verses 46 to 49.
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:54.920]   And Mary said, "My soul doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.520]   For he hath regarded the lowest state of his handmaiden.
[00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.400]   For behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:13.440]   For he that is mighty hath done to me great things, and holy is his name."
[00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.480]   But I don't really want to confine my attention to that.
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:24.000]   I rather want to look at the whole statement this evening from a particular angle and standpoint.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   Some who are here this evening will know that we are looking at the Magnificat for the fourth
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.320]   time, twice last Sunday, this morning, and now again this evening.
[00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:41.800]   But tonight I am anxious to look at it in this way, as an expression of the consciousness
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:50.240]   of Mary, of what was happening to her, of what God had done, and was doing, and was
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:57.280]   going to do to her and for her, and in and through her.
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.320]   Now my reason for doing that this evening, at least perhaps the reason that is uppermost
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:09.600]   in my mind and that controls me this evening, is this, that this Sunday evening is not only
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.480]   the Sunday evening following Christmas Day, but is also at the same time the last Sunday
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.960]   night of an old year.
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.360]   You say, "What's that got to do with the spiritual realm?"
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.480]   In a sense, of course, it's got nothing to do with it.
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.100]   And yet we are still in the flesh.
[00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.640]   We are still in time.
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:41.880]   And so we think in terms of time, and it is not a bad thing for us, now and again, to
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:47.720]   do with respect to the spiritual realm what we do in a more ordinary realm.
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:55.480]   I refer, of course, to the habit of taking stock, to the habit of examining the position,
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:01.720]   the situation, in order that we may discover exactly where we stand.
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:07.400]   Nothing is easier in life in this world than just to go on from day to day and week to
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:16.000]   week and month to month and year to year, without stopping to consider what it all means,
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.920]   what it really is all about, as to what it's all going to lead to.
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.600]   It's so easy, isn't it, to be governed by circumstances and surroundings and events
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:28.600]   and happenings.
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:34.320]   We are always proposing to look into these things, but somehow we don't find the time.
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:39.720]   Something else comes in, and so it goes so often by default.
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.520]   And this can happen, I say, in the spiritual realm.
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:49.560]   It is possible, alas, for us even to attend a place of worship such as this Sunday by
[00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:59.760]   Sunday, and yet not rarely to face the real purpose and object and function in so doing.
[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.400]   There are still people in the world, though it's no longer in general the custom and
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.920]   the habit for people to attend a place of worship, there are still people who do that
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:13.320]   out of mere habit and custom, or various other reasons that they've got, their own private
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.200]   personal reasons.
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.900]   There are many motives that bring people to the house of God.
[00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.800]   We all know that perfectly well when we're honest with ourselves.
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:31.440]   But the question is, have we come face to face with the real object, the real purpose?
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.720]   What has listening to the gospel meant to us?
[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.280]   Not a bad question to ask, is it, the last Sunday night of an old year?
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.080]   How many times have you heard the gospel this year?
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.520]   Well, what's it done to you?
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.840]   Has it done anything?
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.440]   Has it made any vital difference to you?
[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.440]   It's meant to.
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.820]   It's meant to change everything.
[00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.360]   If any man be in Christ, says the Apostle Paul, he is a new creature.
[00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.600]   Old things are passed away, behold, all things are become new.
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.120]   That's Christianity.
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:12.400]   Our Lord talks about it as a rebirth, being born again.
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.840]   What's the effect of this gospel when it comes truly?
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.960]   Has it come to us like that?
[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.640]   Has it made any difference to us?
[00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:27.800]   Isn't it a terrible thing that it's possible for us thus, I say, to go on listening to
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:34.080]   the gospel, and yet in a sense to be so detached and remote that it does nothing to us, and
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.920]   we might just as well never have heard it?
[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:40.320]   Now that's a terrible state to be in.
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.640]   And that isn't my own personal opinion.
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:47.440]   Our Lord himself put this very plainly on one occasion.
[00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:57.040]   He said that in the end we shall be judged by our response and reaction to this word,
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.280]   to this gospel.
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:00.520]   Let me read to you his words.
[00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:04.720]   They're very solemn words.
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:14.960]   What he said was this, that all men eventually would have to face this word of his, and they
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.240]   would have to give an answer.
[00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.920]   Here it is in these words.
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:25.560]   "If any man hear my words and believe not, I judge him not, for I came not to judge the
[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:29.140]   world but to save the world.
[00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:36.580]   He that rejecteth me and receiveth not my words hath one that judgeth him.
[00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:45.580]   The word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day."
[00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:50.540]   Now that's a very solemnizing thought.
[00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:55.660]   There is nothing more serious than to listen to this gospel, the preaching of this gospel,
[00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:59.260]   because according to our Lord there, it'll meet us again.
[00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:00.980]   We'll have to give an answer.
[00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:05.260]   If we've ever heard it, the question is why didn't we believe it?
[00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:09.580]   We shall be confronted by Christian people, by those who did believe it, and we'll be
[00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:11.380]   left without an excuse.
[00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:14.020]   They sat in the same chapel, in the same church.
[00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:17.340]   They heard the same gospel, the same message, the same everything.
[00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:19.780]   Well they were saved by it, why were not we?
[00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:21.900]   That's what he's saying.
[00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:30.820]   So surely it is of very vital importance to us that we should know exactly where we stand
[00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:35.020]   with regard to this gospel.
[00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:40.420]   Now let's look at it like this.
[00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:49.720]   To be a Christian means that we have had an experience of the grace of God.
[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:53.700]   That is essential Christianity.
[00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:57.500]   There are many other definitions that one could give of it.
[00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:02.260]   One which I've often quoted, because it seems to me to be such an excellent one, is this.
[00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:07.180]   That old definition of Henry Scougal, that old Scotsman who lived nearly 300 years ago,
[00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:08.860]   he said, "This is Christianity.
[00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:12.500]   It is the life of God in the souls of men."
[00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:14.860]   Now that is Christianity.
[00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:20.500]   In other words, let's get it clear in this way.
[00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:33.620]   What makes us Christian is not primarily what we do, but what God does to us.
[00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:35.500]   That's essential Christianity.
[00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:39.100]   This rebirth, this being born again, that's all God's action.
[00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:40.620]   That isn't men, that's God.
[00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:42.220]   It's born from above.
[00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:45.140]   It is the work of the Holy Spirit of God.
[00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:48.540]   Very well.
[00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:55.340]   Now then, I say therefore that the essential thing about being Christian is that one has
[00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:59.620]   thus been dealt with by God, and that's an experience.
[00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:03.020]   It isn't only experience, of course.
[00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:06.340]   There is the element of understanding and so many other things.
[00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:10.820]   But the vital thing is just this, this experience.
[00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:15.780]   Now I'm contrasting it obviously, as you see, with many other things which so often
[00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:19.860]   passes Christianity.
[00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:22.220]   I've mentioned them many and many a time before.
[00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:24.940]   I'm taking no risks tonight.
[00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:31.180]   We are examining ourselves and in the light of our Lord's warning, oh how often must one
[00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:32.180]   repeat it?
[00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:34.300]   One can never repeat it too frequently.
[00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:40.060]   Now being interested in Christianity alone doesn't make us Christians.
[00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:44.100]   You see, you can take an intellectual interest in these things.
[00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:46.780]   There's nothing more fascinating than that.
[00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:51.180]   This is the most amazing system of truth in the world tonight, or that the world has ever
[00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:52.180]   known.
[00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:58.500]   It's a fascinating intellectual occupation to study this book and books about it.
[00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:03.500]   Many a man has gone through life doing that, you know, without being a Christian.
[00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:08.220]   You can be interested intellectually, and only intellectually.
[00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:11.100]   And there are other people who think that being Christian means doing good.
[00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:13.140]   That's the popular one today, of course.
[00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:17.180]   Any man who does good is a Christian, though he may say himself that he's a Mohammedan
[00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:18.500]   or a Hindu, doesn't matter.
[00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:20.700]   They say he's doing good, he's a Christian.
[00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:24.740]   He doesn't say so, but he is, he must be.
[00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:27.700]   That's what makes us Christian, you see, what we do, doing good.
[00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:33.740]   But of course it's the exact opposite of all we find in this book.
[00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:40.700]   Other people believe it's attending church services, particularly if you get up early
[00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:43.940]   in the morning to do so and things like that, and adopt certain postures.
[00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:48.100]   Oh, that's fine, that's wonderful Christianity, exceptional.
[00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:52.140]   But you see, it's still something that you do.
[00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:57.140]   Whereas I say the basic definition is this, it is that which God does to us.
[00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:58.980]   It's an experience.
[00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:07.700]   Now then, let's examine ourselves in the light of that, using what we are told here by Mary,
[00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:09.500]   with regard to her experience.
[00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:15.900]   I'm going to use her statement as a means of self-examination, that we may test ourselves
[00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:19.900]   one by one this evening in the light of this.
[00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:24.860]   For I suggest to you that it can be said that in many ways Mary's experience as reported
[00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:32.780]   here is in a sense the first authentic Christian experience.
[00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:41.660]   Here, you see, she tells us about her reaction to what God had done to her.
[00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:45.460]   You say, "Ah, but that's different because she was going to give birth to a child."
[00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:48.700]   That isn't the important thing, you know, in Mary's experience, as she may explain
[00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:49.700]   herself.
[00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:50.940]   She doesn't refer much to that.
[00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:58.500]   No, no, the important thing is Mary's realization of what is happening, of what God is doing.
[00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:02.780]   And that's the thing to which she gives expression in the Magnificat.
[00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:08.660]   In other words, Mary was aware of an undergoing a spiritual experience.
[00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:15.340]   And she gives us here in her statement what I want to show you are the salient cardinal
[00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:21.940]   features and elements in this Christian experience.
[00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:26.380]   Now then, let's look at it together in this way.
[00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:31.340]   Let us first of all get rid of something which is so often a stumbling block to people, and
[00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:35.980]   that is the element of time in this experience.
[00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:44.300]   Or to put it still more generally, the way in which this experience comes.
[00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:48.700]   I've known many people who have doubted whether they were Christians or not because
[00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:53.380]   the experience hadn't come to them in a given way or manner.
[00:12:53.380 --> 00:13:01.940]   This is a very subtle snare by which the devil robs many people of their joy.
[00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:08.540]   He would have us believe that there is a standard experience, and one only, and that unless
[00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:14.940]   we have had that exact experience, that we are not Christians at all.
[00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:20.140]   But I feel that this one story alone, and it is as I say in many respects the very first,
[00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:26.060]   here is the first account of a reaction to God's dealings with us all.
[00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:33.420]   This alone is enough to tell us that there is no such thing as a standardized Christian
[00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:37.060]   experience.
[00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:46.020]   Sometimes this experience may come very suddenly, but sometimes it may come very gradually.
[00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:49.260]   And the thing of course that I am anxious to emphasize is this, that it doesn't matter
[00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:54.380]   to the slightest extent whether it's sudden or gradual.
[00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:58.740]   What matters is that it's happened.
[00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:03.740]   Now here I say is the thing that stumbles many people.
[00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:11.500]   Imagine somebody for instance reading John Bunyan's Grace Abounding, and there you read
[00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:16.700]   that poor John Bunyan for 18 months passed through a terrible agony of repentance.
[00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:21.580]   Oh, he was conscious of his sin, his unworthiness and his shame.
[00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:26.620]   It was such an agony in his soul that he tells us quite solemnly that on one occasion he
[00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:30.920]   felt he could even smell brimstone in the air.
[00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:32.740]   He felt such a wretch.
[00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:36.700]   He was so unhappy on another occasion that when he happened to see a number of geese
[00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:40.220]   grazing in a field nearby, he envied them.
[00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:42.860]   He wished he were an animal.
[00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:47.380]   He wished that he were not capable of this awful agony through which he was passing,
[00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:53.220]   his agony of repentance, which went on for 18 months.
[00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:57.740]   Now there are some people who think that if you don't go through that precise experience
[00:14:57.740 --> 00:14:59.180]   that you've never been a Christian.
[00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:02.980]   I mean, they'd even emphasize the 18 months almost.
[00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:06.140]   And unless you conform to the pattern, you're not a Christian.
[00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:09.260]   Now there is no scriptural basis for that whatsoever.
[00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:15.820]   Others, you see, read an account like that of the Philippian jailer or something like
[00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:19.180]   that and find a man suddenly converted.
[00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:23.500]   And unless it happens to them like that, if they have to go through remorse and repentance
[00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:27.700]   for 18 months instead of seeing it suddenly, they feel they're not Christians.
[00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:29.500]   They say it must be sudden.
[00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:33.380]   Some say gradual, some say sudden.
[00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:39.740]   The answer is that there is no standardized experience taught in the New Testament.
[00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:45.660]   The case of Mary that we are looking at, as I said on one of these previous occasions,
[00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:47.740]   is most instructive in this respect.
[00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:49.620]   Thank God for it.
[00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:54.260]   I'm holding it before you tonight in order that I may perchance comfort somebody who
[00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:57.060]   is in trouble about this matter.
[00:15:57.060 --> 00:15:58.620]   Did you notice what happened to Mary?
[00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:03.820]   The archangel came and made the announcement that instead of Mary jumping at it, taking
[00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:09.320]   to it with both hands, Mary stumbled at it and queried it and questioned it.
[00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:15.060]   Instead of being filled with a spirit of rejoicing at first, I read this, "When she saw him,
[00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:19.940]   she was troubled at his saying and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should
[00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:20.940]   be."
[00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:23.140]   Definite stumbling.
[00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:29.120]   The archangel goes on speaking, but even then Mary doesn't grasp it, she doesn't get it.
[00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:33.920]   He tells her about this wonderful child that was to be born of her, and instead again of
[00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:40.900]   praising God, Mary said unto the angel, "How shall this be, seeing that I know not a man?"
[00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:43.220]   She said, "You're talking nonsense, it's impossible.
[00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:44.220]   How can I bear a child?
[00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:46.020]   I'm a virgin, I've never known a man.
[00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:49.460]   I'm not married."
[00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:50.460]   She stumbled.
[00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:59.180]   That's Mary's first reaction, questioning, stumbling, querying, doubting.
[00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:03.180]   And then you remember she goes on to this second step in which when the archangel has
[00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:08.900]   answered her doubts and mildly rebuked her and told her that with God nothing shall be
[00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:15.140]   impossible, Mary said, "Behold the handmaid of the Lord, be ye done to me according to
[00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:16.460]   thy word."
[00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:18.000]   And the angel departed from her.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.340]   She didn't get further, that's a sort of passive resignation.
[00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:25.660]   She hasn't seen it yet, but she's seen this.
[00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:30.260]   She's been rebuked for querying the possibility of this thing with God.
[00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:34.940]   She's been rebuked for putting a limit to the all-mightiness of God.
[00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:37.300]   And she says, "Very well, I see I'm wrong.
[00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:40.460]   I don't understand, but I'll submit."
[00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:44.020]   She went through that stage.
[00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:48.400]   And it was only later when she hears the words of Elizabeth, her cousin, the mother of John
[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:52.800]   the Baptist, that she sees it.
[00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:56.840]   And the moment she sees it, she bursts forth into this magnificat.
[00:17:56.840 --> 00:18:03.780]   Now, there you see steps and stages, hindrances and obstacles, which she has to overcome.
[00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:06.040]   It's a kind of process through which she goes.
[00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:11.040]   She doesn't immediately, she hears the message of the archangel say, "I believe it's wonderful."
[00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:12.280]   No, no.
[00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:15.480]   That's possible, but so is this.
[00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:23.000]   Very well then, I say that the thing that matters tonight is not whether this has happened
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.440]   to you suddenly or gradually.
[00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:27.280]   The vital question is, has it happened?
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:33.480]   If I may use an illustration, which I once heard an old, old preacher using and which
[00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:40.320]   I thought was very good, let me use it in order that I may help you.
[00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:44.440]   He said there are two men, you can think of two men, going on a journey, walking along
[00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:46.240]   a road.
[00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:51.480]   One of them is walking in a sort of gentle drizzle.
[00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:55.680]   But he's got a long journey to take, and as a result of this gentle drizzle, which has
[00:18:55.680 --> 00:19:02.240]   gone on throughout the whole journey, he arrives at his destination, wet through.
[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:05.800]   The other man sets out in glorious sunshine.
[00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:10.400]   And for the first three hours of his walk, he's continuing in the glorious sunshine.
[00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:14.800]   Suddenly the clouds gather, when he's only got about half a mile to go, and a cloudburst
[00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:16.480]   takes place.
[00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:19.960]   And in a few moments, he is soaked through to the skin.
[00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:24.200]   They both arrive at their destination wet, soaked through.
[00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:26.040]   It took a long time in one case.
[00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:28.640]   It happened very quickly and suddenly in the second.
[00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:32.760]   But you see, what matters is not whether you got wet to the skin suddenly or gradually,
[00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:37.360]   but the fact that you got wet through to the skin.
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:42.320]   God forbid that anybody in this congregation should be stumbled by that particular point
[00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:43.320]   this evening.
[00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:48.440]   No, no, it doesn't matter how nor when, the mode, the method, the vital question is, has
[00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:49.440]   it happened?
[00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:50.440]   Very well, let's come to that.
[00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:52.120]   Here's my second point.
[00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:56.560]   What are the elements in this experience as taught in this incident?
[00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:57.560]   They're all here.
[00:19:57.560 --> 00:20:01.200]   Here is the first one.
[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:07.520]   The first is an awareness of being dealt with and being blessed by God.
[00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:15.560]   Mary, you see, puts that right at the beginning, doesn't she?
[00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:19.080]   He hath regarded the lowest state of his handmaiden.
[00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:25.680]   He that is mighty hath done to me great things, and holy is his name.
[00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:30.360]   Ah, but you say again, of course, she's referring to the fact that she was going to have this
[00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:31.360]   child.
[00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:35.240]   I know, it comes in, but that isn't the thing that Mary is most aware of.
[00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:42.240]   What she's aware of above everything else, that God has been doing something to her.
[00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:45.360]   That's the thing to emphasize.
[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:49.000]   And that is the thing that I would emphasize now.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:55.360]   If to be a Christian means to receive life from God, if to be a Christian means that
[00:20:55.360 --> 00:21:01.040]   you are born again, if to be a Christian means that you've passed from death to life, from
[00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:07.400]   darkness to light, that you're a new creature, a new creation.
[00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:13.640]   Well isn't it quite inevitable that anyone to whom that has happened must be aware of
[00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:20.360]   the fact that something is happening?
[00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:24.240]   You see, it isn't a decision that I take, it isn't something that I do, it isn't the
[00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:27.280]   end product of my activity, no, no.
[00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:33.280]   The peculiar thing about this is, as Mary was aware that God was doing something to
[00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:40.480]   her, so this person who's become a Christian has the same awareness.
[00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:43.760]   I mean something like this.
[00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:51.160]   That though you don't understand it, you are aware that something's happening to you, something's
[00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:54.280]   taking place in your life, you're being disturbed.
[00:21:54.280 --> 00:22:00.600]   I've borrowed those words of Wordsworth before, now he didn't mean what I mean, but I can
[00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:01.640]   use them in a sense.
[00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:03.760]   He put it like this, you see.
[00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:11.800]   I have felt a presence that disturbs me with the joys of elevated thought.
[00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:12.800]   That's it.
[00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:15.880]   I felt a presence.
[00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:21.040]   You can't be a Christian without being aware of the fact that God is dealing with you,
[00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:25.520]   is concerned about you, is doing something to you.
[00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:27.840]   God's got his hands upon you.
[00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:32.440]   You may at first react in a hostile manner against that, you may not like it, you may
[00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:34.000]   want to shake it off.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.480]   It's often happened, many people have done that, but whether you like it or not, what
[00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:39.620]   you are aware of is that something's happening.
[00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:43.960]   You wish sometimes that you'd never heard of God, that you'd never heard of Christ.
[00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:47.400]   You wish you could be enjoying that other life with the world as you've always done,
[00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:52.880]   but something's come in, you're disturbed.
[00:22:52.880 --> 00:23:00.380]   Sometimes it's nothing more than that at the beginning, just an uneasiness, just an awareness
[00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:03.600]   that something's troubling you and has come into you.
[00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:07.800]   You wish you could divest yourself, but you can't, it's something inside you.
[00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:10.920]   It's the one who made you at the beginning, making you again.
[00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:14.920]   His creator hands and fingers are upon you and moulding you.
[00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:20.360]   Mary was aware of being dealt with by God.
[00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:23.360]   So is every Christian.
[00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:26.760]   So is every Christian.
[00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:32.440]   You may fight and kick and struggle, and yet the whole time you know that it's not you,
[00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:33.440]   it's something else.
[00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:39.880]   You see, that is why in a sense I always feel happier about a man who's militantly opposed
[00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:45.440]   and is fighting with his teeth clenched and hating it, I almost prefer him to the man
[00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:51.680]   who feels that he, by living a good life and this and that, is making himself a Christian.
[00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:55.880]   With regard to that second man, I'm not aware that God's doing anything to him at all.
[00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:56.880]   He's doing everything.
[00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:59.680]   He's like the pharisee who thanks God for all he's doing.
[00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:05.540]   But when this other man is struggling against it, and I see him kicking violently, I say
[00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:11.240]   to myself very often, "God's doing something to that man."
[00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:15.600]   Let me give a word of comfort to some people who may be here tonight who are anxious about
[00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:18.060]   someone who's very dear to them.
[00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:21.680]   You Christian people, you may be almost breaking your heart.
[00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:24.080]   You feel that that loved one is going further and further away.
[00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:26.360]   You say, "He's becoming more and more violent."
[00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:29.760]   It may be the best sign in the world.
[00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:30.760]   What's he doing?
[00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:34.480]   Ah, he's trying to get rid of this power that started dealing with him.
[00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:35.840]   It's God acting.
[00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:36.840]   He doesn't understand.
[00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:37.840]   He doesn't like it.
[00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:38.840]   He's against it so far.
[00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:40.280]   But there it is.
[00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:42.400]   God has put his hand upon him.
[00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:43.400]   Hold on.
[00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:44.400]   That's the first thing.
[00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:45.720]   Let me hurry to the second.
[00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:50.680]   The second is, of course, and it follows quite inevitably from the first, the element of
[00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:53.800]   surprise and amazement.
[00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:57.040]   It's here everywhere in Mary's statement.
[00:24:57.040 --> 00:25:04.040]   "My soul doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.
[00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:07.480]   He hath regarded the lowest state of his handmaiden.
[00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:10.360]   He that is mighty hath done to me great things and holy is his."
[00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:17.960]   Don't you feel and hear the note of amazement and of astonishment?
[00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:23.120]   And again, I would emphasize and underline this.
[00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:28.960]   I'm not at all sure that this isn't one of the most crucial tests of all.
[00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:31.880]   Mary couldn't believe this thing that was happening to her.
[00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:35.240]   It was so remarkable, it was so astonishing.
[00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:36.240]   She knew it was happening.
[00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:37.480]   She could scarcely credit.
[00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:41.800]   Should this happen to me, my lowest state, a handmaiden?
[00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:42.800]   Is it happening?
[00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:43.800]   Yes, it is.
[00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:49.560]   But she can scarcely contain the surprise and the amazement at it all.
[00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:58.320]   That God had ever looked upon her and had chosen to do this to her.
[00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:02.360]   I almost feel that this is the acid test.
[00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:05.560]   Are you surprised at yourself?
[00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:09.380]   Are you amazed at yourself?
[00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:13.480]   You never will be, of course, until you're conscious that God is doing something to you.
[00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:15.160]   Oh, you can be very moral.
[00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:16.440]   There's no amazement in that.
[00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:20.320]   You decided to do it, and you're doing it.
[00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:24.920]   Intellectual interests, all the rest of them, there's nothing to amaze a man in that.
[00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:26.440]   He's aware of what he's doing.
[00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:30.160]   He's doing it volitionally, willingly, and well aware of what he's doing.
[00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:34.240]   You see, there is no element of surprise and amazement until we are conscious that God
[00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:36.200]   is doing something to us.
[00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:41.360]   And then we are filled with amazement, as Mary was, and we ask, "Can this be true of
[00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:42.360]   me?
[00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:43.360]   Is it really I?
[00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:47.880]   Is this happening to me?"
[00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:48.880]   What do I mean?
[00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:53.400]   Well, I mean something like this.
[00:26:53.400 --> 00:27:00.720]   This awareness, if you like, of the process that is going on in us.
[00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:05.640]   Because the moment this process begins to go on, you'll find tremendous changes taking
[00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:06.640]   place.
[00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:12.040]   You'll find this, for instance, that whereas you never gave a single thought to the fact
[00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:17.640]   that you'd got a soul, it's now your chief concern.
[00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:22.120]   You never gave a thought to the fact of death.
[00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:24.360]   You often think about it now.
[00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:27.040]   You never gave a thought to the next world and life beyond.
[00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:31.560]   No, no, you regarded that as morbid, something to be dismissed, never to be thought of.
[00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:35.040]   But now it's very frequently in your mind, you're thinking of it.
[00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:36.040]   The Bible.
[00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:40.320]   The most boring book in the world.
[00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:45.760]   The idea of reading the Bible for pleasure was just unthinkable, of course.
[00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:50.760]   But now you find yourself wanting to read it and you desire to understand it.
[00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:53.640]   It's the book of books to you.
[00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:54.640]   And so on.
[00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:55.640]   Prayer.
[00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:59.680]   You never prayed at all unless, of course, you were desperately ill or somebody dear
[00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:03.640]   to you was desperately ill or some terrible accident or calamity took place or there
[00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:04.640]   was a war.
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:05.640]   Then, of course, you prayed.
[00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:08.440]   But when things were going well, you wouldn't dream of praying.
[00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:13.220]   But now you see that prayer is the most amazing and wonderful thing in the world.
[00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:16.960]   And what you can't get over is this, that you should be trying to pray.
[00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:19.320]   You should say, "Is it possible?
[00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:20.600]   Am I the same person?
[00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:22.320]   Can it be I?
[00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:23.320]   The thing seems...
[00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:24.320]   No, it's impossible.
[00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:25.320]   I'm not."
[00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:30.720]   Well, you read all this, you see Mary felt all that, this amazement, this astonishment,
[00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:32.160]   this surprising element.
[00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:36.000]   And you've got it, of course, in every one of these New Testament writers.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.840]   Let me hurry on immediately to the classical example of it.
[00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:41.920]   The Apostle Paul himself.
[00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:48.880]   "I live, yet not I."
[00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:49.880]   There's something wrong here.
[00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:53.440]   "I live, yet not I.
[00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:54.680]   I am Saul of Tarsus.
[00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:56.440]   I'm not Saul of Tarsus.
[00:28:56.440 --> 00:29:01.440]   Saul of Tarsus was a blasphemer, an injurious person, a hater of Christ and of the gospel.
[00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:03.360]   I cannot be Saul of Tarsus.
[00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:04.720]   And yet I am Saul of Tarsus.
[00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:05.720]   I know I am.
[00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:06.720]   I'm the same man.
[00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:07.720]   You see, he's in trouble.
[00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:09.600]   He doesn't understand himself.
[00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:11.360]   I live, yet not I."
[00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:13.280]   Now, that's Christianity.
[00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:15.800]   Here's a man who's amazed at himself.
[00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:17.280]   He can't understand himself.
[00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:18.280]   There's only one solution.
[00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:23.560]   "I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me."
[00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:25.600]   And he couldn't get over it.
[00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:26.600]   What was it?
[00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:29.280]   Well, it was this, you see.
[00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:35.200]   That the Son of God, the Lord Jesus Christ, whom he'd blasphemed and hated and whom he'd
[00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:41.040]   reviled, should have loved him with an everlasting love and should have died for him.
[00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:46.440]   The Son of God, he says, who loved me and gave himself for me.
[00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:47.440]   He never got over it.
[00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:48.440]   Never.
[00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:51.440]   "And that is essential Christian experience."
[00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:55.920]   "Yes," says Charles Wesley, "you're perfectly right."
[00:29:55.920 --> 00:30:03.800]   "And can it be that I should gain an interest in the Savior's blood?
[00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:06.800]   Died he for me who caused his pain?
[00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:09.720]   For me who him to death pursued?
[00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:11.200]   Amazing love!
[00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:17.960]   And can it be that thou, my God, hast died for me?
[00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:21.560]   Has this happened to me?"
[00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:24.560]   That's what Mary was saying, wasn't it?
[00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:29.200]   The amazement, the astonishment, the surprise.
[00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:32.200]   Are you surprised at yourself?
[00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:38.360]   And are you driven to say with the Apostle Paul elsewhere, "I am what I am by the grace
[00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:40.200]   of God."
[00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:41.800]   I can't explain it.
[00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:43.520]   That's the only explanation.
[00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:44.920]   I don't understand myself.
[00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:46.960]   I've undergone such a complete revolution.
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:48.800]   I was against, I'm now for.
[00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:51.640]   With the vehemence with which I persecuted, I'm now preaching.
[00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:53.520]   A complete transformation.
[00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:58.040]   New creature, new creation.
[00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:03.440]   He never got over the surprise, neither did Mary.
[00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:09.840]   And you know no Christian can ever get over this surprise.
[00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:12.960]   Here we are, a little company on this last night of this old year.
[00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:19.120]   Let me tell you that nothing so amazes me as the fact that I'm in this pulpit and doing
[00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:22.200]   what I'm doing at this moment.
[00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:24.680]   Why am I here?
[00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:26.880]   Was it because I'm a good man?
[00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:30.760]   Certainly not.
[00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:32.920]   Was it because I decided?
[00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:36.880]   Certainly not.
[00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:42.540]   I am what I am by the grace of God.
[00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:49.680]   And I'm more and more amazed at the fact that I should be doing what I am doing.
[00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:53.400]   I might so easily have been doing something else.
[00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:55.640]   I never decided.
[00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:58.640]   I fought against.
[00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:03.080]   This is God's action.
[00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:08.880]   Why should any Christian be different from anybody else?
[00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:14.520]   Why shouldn't we all be living the way of the world, living to drink and to dance and
[00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:17.640]   to indulge our base of passions?
[00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:18.640]   Why not?
[00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:21.160]   It's not because we're any better.
[00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:24.080]   It's not because we've got a superior understanding.
[00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:27.360]   It's not because of anything in us.
[00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:36.680]   I am what I am by the grace of God, and what's amazing is that I am this in spite of myself.
[00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:37.680]   It is God's action.
[00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:40.680]   It's what He's doing.
[00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:41.920]   That's what Mary felt.
[00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:44.000]   Let me go on to another point.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:48.040]   You notice that because of this, and you see every one of them leads to the next, you notice
[00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:51.840]   her humility and her lowliness.
[00:32:51.840 --> 00:33:02.040]   He hath regarded the low estate of his handmaidens; he that is mighty hath done to me great things,
[00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:08.240]   and holy is his name of God.
[00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:15.080]   Where there is a complete absence of humility and lowliness, there is no Christianity at
[00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:18.560]   all.
[00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:23.320]   I was reminding you last Sunday evening that Mary here anticipates the Beatitudes, and
[00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:27.160]   they are, you remember, blessed are the poor in spirit.
[00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:30.240]   Blessed are they that mourn.
[00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:34.680]   Blessed are they that do hunger and thirst after righteousness.
[00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:35.680]   Blessed are the meek.
[00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:38.080]   They are the Christians.
[00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:40.400]   That's Christianity.
[00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:41.960]   Why does a Christian feel like this?
[00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:43.880]   Well, my dear friends, isn't it inevitable?
[00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:46.040]   These things, you know, they need no demonstration.
[00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:47.440]   They need no argument.
[00:33:47.440 --> 00:34:01.120]   What Mary was conscious of was this, "My soul doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit
[00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:05.920]   hath rejoiced in God."
[00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:07.800]   She felt the touch of his power.
[00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:13.920]   The archangel had told her that she would, that the All-Highest should overcome her,
[00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:19.000]   and that the power of God should be upon her, and she felt it.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.200]   She had touched, as it were, God.
[00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:23.920]   She had sensed the eternal presence.
[00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:27.920]   And my dear friend, I don't care who you are, nor what you are, if you've ever had
[00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:33.040]   the faintest suspicion of a realization of the presence and the glory and the greatness
[00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:42.560]   and the majesty and the holiness of God, it will humble you to the dust.
[00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:50.920]   You'll feel that you're vile and unworthy, humility, lowliness.
[00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:55.320]   Mary wasn't proud of herself in any way at all.
[00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:57.700]   The Christian never is.
[00:34:57.700 --> 00:35:02.640]   Not proud of his works, not proud of his activity, not proud of his morality, not proud of his
[00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:07.640]   prayers, not proud of his understanding.
[00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:16.080]   What the Christian is conscious of above everything else is his own utter unworthiness, his complete
[00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:18.760]   unworthiness, that this should happen to me.
[00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:20.240]   Elizabeth felt the same thing.
[00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:24.220]   Elizabeth, you see, was filled with the Holy Spirit, and she spake out with a loud voice
[00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:28.880]   and said, "Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, and
[00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:36.160]   whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?"
[00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:38.360]   That's it.
[00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:43.520]   And Mary feels exactly the same thing.
[00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:48.600]   The moment we realize something of the nearness and the presence and the character of God's
[00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:57.920]   being, we see ourselves as we are in all our nakedness, all our sinfulness, all our unrighteousness,
[00:35:57.920 --> 00:35:59.520]   and all our unworthiness.
[00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:03.560]   You remember Isaiah, he was a very good man, but he was given that vision, that glimpse
[00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:08.820]   of God, and you remember what he said at once, "Woe is me, woe is me, for I am a man of
[00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:13.000]   unclean lips, and I dwell amongst the people of unclean lips.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:16.240]   Woe is me."
[00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:24.480]   Do you remember the bold, self-confident, and self-satisfied Simon Peter, the disciple,
[00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:25.480]   saying the same thing?
[00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:26.480]   Peter, the daredevil.
[00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:31.960]   Peter, the man who was ready to venture in and be the first volunteer always.
[00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:35.600]   Yes, but one occasion, you remember, he had been out fishing with the others and they
[00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:39.200]   had caught nothing, and our Lord just gave them a command and they carried it out, and
[00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:43.480]   they caught so many fish they didn't know what to do with them.
[00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:46.400]   You remember the effect on Simon Peter?
[00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:53.800]   He went to our Lord and he said, "Depart from me, O Lord, for I am a sinful man."
[00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:56.240]   What made him feel he was so sinful and vile?
[00:36:56.240 --> 00:37:01.760]   Oh, he'd had a glimpse, you see, of the almightiness of the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God,
[00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:10.080]   the manifestation of divine power, and it made him feel he was vile and unworthy.
[00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:16.240]   I don't see how a man has a right to regard himself as a Christian unless he sees something
[00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:21.120]   of his own unworthiness and sinfulness and vileness, his own weakness, his own lack of
[00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:22.120]   power.
[00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:26.640]   Do you know, the man about whom I'm absolutely certain that he's not a Christian is the man
[00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:28.600]   who thinks he can make himself a Christian.
[00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:31.480]   I am certain that he's not a Christian.
[00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:35.280]   And you give me a man who's conscious of his unworthiness, you give me a man who says,
[00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:40.040]   "Oh, if you but knew my heart, if you knew but the thoughts and the imaginations, if
[00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:44.200]   you knew me as I am within, you wouldn't regard me as a Christian."
[00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:48.440]   I'm very hopeful about that person.
[00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:55.560]   If you feel you deserve to be forgiven, I don't think you are forgiven.
[00:37:55.560 --> 00:38:01.000]   If you feel you deserve to be blessed by God, I'm sure you're not being blessed by God.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:07.240]   Oh, these are the people, that this should happen to me, humility, unworthiness, sense
[00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:13.600]   therefore of it all coming from God in spite of our wretchedness and our vileness.
[00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:16.880]   You again say it with Charles Wesley, don't you?
[00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:27.400]   "Blessed and holy is thy name, I am all unrighteousness.
[00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:36.840]   Vile and full of sin I am, thou art full of truth and grace."
[00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:38.520]   That's it, humility and lowliness.
[00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:42.400]   Hurry to the next point which is of course, gratitude and praise.
[00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:46.680]   My soul doth magnify the Lord, of course.
[00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:51.720]   Praise my soul, the King of heaven, to his feet thy tribute bring.
[00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:55.440]   Why, ransom, healed, restored, forgiven.
[00:38:55.440 --> 00:39:00.720]   Who like thee whose praise should sing?
[00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:05.440]   Praise him, praise him, praise the everlasting King.
[00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:10.400]   My dear friends, have you a sense of gratitude to God at this last Sunday night of this old
[00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:11.400]   year?
[00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:15.000]   Is there a glimmering of praise in your heart somewhere?
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:24.480]   Is there something within you that makes you desire to praise God and to magnify his grace?
[00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:29.920]   Is it possible to be a Christian without feeling something of that?
[00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:33.920]   Do you believe your sins are forgiven?
[00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:38.120]   Do you believe your soul is redeemed?
[00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:41.840]   Do you say you've got a new nature?
[00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:47.320]   Do you say that there is a blessed hope set awaiting you in heaven with God?
[00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:49.000]   Do you believe all that?
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:54.600]   Tell me, do you really believe that Jesus of Nazareth, the babe of Bethlehem, first
[00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:57.920]   of all, was in reality the Son of God?
[00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:01.140]   Do you really believe in the incarnation?
[00:40:01.140 --> 00:40:07.680]   Do you really believe that God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son,
[00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:12.280]   sent him into the world, sent him into the virgin's womb, sent him to be born as a
[00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:15.840]   babe in that stable, and put him into the manger?
[00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:22.600]   Do you believe that God so loved you that he sent his Son not only to do that, but to
[00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:29.080]   die on the cross on Calvary's hill, and take your sins upon him and receive their punishment,
[00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:34.200]   that you might be absolved and forgiven, and reconciled to God and made his child, and
[00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:35.440]   given an everlasting hope?
[00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:36.680]   Do you really believe it?
[00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:42.080]   How can you believe it without feeling some sense of gratitude and of praise and of thanksgiving?
[00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:52.040]   My soul doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit doth rejoice in God my Savior.
[00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:54.760]   Do you feel a little of it?
[00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:57.280]   I want to try and help you.
[00:40:57.280 --> 00:41:01.520]   Is there the faintest flicker of a sense of gratitude within you?
[00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:05.880]   If so, you can be hopeful.
[00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:11.160]   But if you can consider these blessed facts, if you can consider the Christmas event, the
[00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:16.720]   incarnation, and all that followed, if you can look at it with a complete detachment,
[00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:23.080]   with a philosophical or intellectual objectivity, and if it does not move you even to the slightest
[00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:34.240]   fraction, if there is not a speck of softness in your calloused, hard heart, oh, how can
[00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:35.960]   you be a Christian?
[00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:37.440]   No, no.
[00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:42.720]   The one who realizes what God is doing and what is happening says, "My soul doth magnify
[00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:49.800]   the Lord, and my spirit doth rejoice in God my Savior."
[00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:51.120]   The next step is fear.
[00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:55.880]   "Yes," says Mary, "his mercy is on them that fear him."
[00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:58.400]   From generation to generation, what is this?
[00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:00.780]   It is not a craven fear.
[00:42:00.780 --> 00:42:02.340]   It is not a fear of hell.
[00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:04.200]   It is not a fear of punishment here.
[00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:05.200]   What is it?
[00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:11.560]   Well, it is what the author of the epistle to the Hebrews calls reverence and godly fear.
[00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:18.880]   It is, in other words, that sense of God about which I have been speaking.
[00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:22.080]   This is a very good test again.
[00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:27.320]   You see, the man of the world, the man who is obviously not a Christian, he knows nothing
[00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:33.000]   about the fear of the Lord, but I will give you a good and a comforting negative test
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:37.840]   this night in order to help you.
[00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:41.600]   If you have got a consciousness within you that the eye of God is upon you, wherever
[00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:46.920]   you are and whatever you are doing, it is hopeful.
[00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:47.920]   Who is a Christian?
[00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:50.640]   He is a man who walks in the fear of the Lord.
[00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:53.480]   He says, "No, no, it is not men and women that matter.
[00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:55.400]   It is not I myself that matters.
[00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:57.440]   I know that God's eye is upon me.
[00:42:57.440 --> 00:42:59.320]   I am ever under God.
[00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:02.400]   God is ever looking at me, and I cannot escape him.
[00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:05.520]   I know that he is always the fear of the Lord.
[00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:13.520]   The mercy of the Lord is upon them that fear him from generation to generation."
[00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:17.840]   This you see is a healthy and a hopeful fear.
[00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:21.400]   It is what the Apostle Paul means when he says this.
[00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:29.520]   "Work out," he says, "your own salvation with fear and trembling."
[00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:31.040]   He says that to Christian people.
[00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:36.200]   "Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God that worketh in you
[00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:40.160]   both to will and to do of his good pleasure."
[00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:43.920]   The only man who can know fear and trembling in this sense is a Christian.
[00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:45.760]   The other man knows nothing about it.
[00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:49.080]   Take your typical men of the world, you know, the men who are lauded on the wireless and
[00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:54.640]   the television, the free lover, the drinker, the gambler, the man who indulges his sex.
[00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:57.480]   Fear and trembling, they know nothing about it.
[00:43:57.480 --> 00:44:02.820]   They will know, they will know, and they'll know to all eternity if they die like that.
[00:44:02.820 --> 00:44:06.960]   But now they know nothing about it.
[00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:11.720]   But a Christian does know something about it.
[00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:18.920]   It is the fear that a man is aware of when he is afraid of hurting someone whom he loves.
[00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:19.920]   That's it.
[00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:20.920]   That's the fear.
[00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:25.760]   Not the fear of a law, but the fear of love.
[00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:28.880]   The fear of hurting or wounding love.
[00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:31.040]   The fear of disappointing love.
[00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:32.520]   The fear and trembling.
[00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:37.920]   Well, it's because he has some realization of God's being, his holiness, his majesty,
[00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:41.280]   his glory, his greatness, and his eternity.
[00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:45.040]   And this man realizes that he's ever in the presence of God.
[00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:53.360]   He walks carefully, he walks softly, he walks in the fear of the Lord.
[00:44:53.360 --> 00:45:01.040]   And lastly, the Christian is one who rejoices in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:08.480]   Yes, Mary's come to see that this child that is to be born of her is the Son of God.
[00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:12.560]   She says, "All generations shall call me blessed.
[00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:18.640]   I of everybody have been chosen to have this inestimable privilege of being the mother
[00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:20.240]   of the Son of God.
[00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:23.920]   All generations shall call me blessed.
[00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:31.920]   As the archangel told me, the one who is to be born of my womb is the Son of God."
[00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:38.880]   And in anticipation she gloried in him and rejoiced in him.
[00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:44.320]   That's the final test of whether we are Christians or not.
[00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:51.040]   But our entire hope is centered on the Son of God, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:56.840]   The Christian is not only a man who believes in God, he's a man who believes in God through
[00:45:56.840 --> 00:45:57.840]   Christ.
[00:45:57.840 --> 00:46:01.040]   You're Mohammedan, you're Jew, believe in God.
[00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:02.040]   What makes a man a Christian?
[00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:06.160]   Not to believe in God only, but to believe in God through Christ.
[00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:09.640]   To realize that it is Christ alone who can bring him to God.
[00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:12.100]   It is Christ alone who reconciles him to God.
[00:46:12.100 --> 00:46:16.320]   It is Christ alone who gives him this new nature and makes him a partaker of the divine
[00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:17.320]   nature.
[00:46:17.320 --> 00:46:18.320]   He rejoices in God.
[00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:20.920]   May I end with the words of Peter?
[00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:30.120]   "Whom having not seen ye love, in whom though now ye see him not yet believing, ye rejoice
[00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:36.520]   with a joy unspeakable and full of glory.
[00:46:36.520 --> 00:46:50.860]   Can you say, I rest my faith in him alone who died for my transgressions to atone?"
[00:46:50.860 --> 00:46:51.860]   Can you say that?
[00:46:51.860 --> 00:47:00.260]   Can you say with the Apostle Paul, "God forbid that I should glory save in the cross of the
[00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:11.180]   Lord Jesus Christ by whom the world was crucified unto me and I unto the world."
[00:47:11.180 --> 00:47:12.180]   Can you say that?
[00:47:12.180 --> 00:47:17.740]   "In the cross of Christ I glory."
[00:47:17.740 --> 00:47:19.220]   Do you make your boast?
[00:47:19.220 --> 00:47:27.380]   Do you rejoice entirely and only in him?
[00:47:27.380 --> 00:47:30.780]   Those are the elements in this Christian experience.
[00:47:30.780 --> 00:47:32.980]   Mary was aware of them.
[00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:38.500]   Everybody who becomes a Christian must be aware of them in exactly the same way.
[00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:44.620]   Very well, I end with this final word of encouragement to you.
[00:47:44.620 --> 00:47:49.420]   If you are in trouble this evening, if my sermon has made you unhappy, if you feel that
[00:47:49.420 --> 00:47:56.020]   these tests are difficult to answer, let me say this to you.
[00:47:56.020 --> 00:48:02.700]   Are you in trouble, I wonder, because you are still in Mary's first stage?
[00:48:02.700 --> 00:48:07.460]   Are you in that condition in which you have not yet realized that here you are in a realm
[00:48:07.460 --> 00:48:12.420]   that is altogether different from everything that is known by the world?
[00:48:12.420 --> 00:48:14.460]   You are in a spiritual realm here.
[00:48:14.460 --> 00:48:18.900]   Mary stumbled, you see, because she did not realize that she was being addressed by an
[00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:24.460]   archangel and that he was talking about a miracle, about the action of God, the supernatural,
[00:48:24.460 --> 00:48:26.140]   the spiritual realm.
[00:48:26.140 --> 00:48:31.340]   She did not realize that, so she stumbles, and she was trying to understand it all.
[00:48:31.340 --> 00:48:34.340]   My dear friend, I wonder whether that is you in trouble.
[00:48:34.340 --> 00:48:38.780]   Don't bring the canons that you employ in business or in your profession here.
[00:48:38.780 --> 00:48:39.780]   They won't help you.
[00:48:39.780 --> 00:48:40.820]   They will be of no value.
[00:48:40.820 --> 00:48:47.380]   You see, when Christ came into this world, as the apostle Paul reminds us, the princes
[00:48:47.380 --> 00:48:50.500]   of this world did not know him.
[00:48:50.500 --> 00:48:52.780]   They were the great men, the philosophers and others.
[00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:56.620]   They didn't know him, for had they known him, they would not have crucified the Lord of
[00:48:56.620 --> 00:48:57.620]   Glory.
[00:48:57.620 --> 00:48:58.620]   Why not?
[00:48:58.620 --> 00:49:01.260]   Well, they were trying to understand him, and they couldn't.
[00:49:01.260 --> 00:49:04.460]   Realize that here you are in a realm which is supernatural.
[00:49:04.460 --> 00:49:06.420]   This is God's activity.
[00:49:06.420 --> 00:49:11.300]   It is God sending his Son, doing the work by the Spirit.
[00:49:11.300 --> 00:49:14.580]   Dismiss all your categories of thought.
[00:49:14.580 --> 00:49:18.500]   Realize you are in a new and in a different and in a spiritual realm.
[00:49:18.500 --> 00:49:22.980]   And secondly, give up trying to understand it.
[00:49:22.980 --> 00:49:24.740]   You never will.
[00:49:24.740 --> 00:49:28.060]   Great is the mystery of godliness.
[00:49:28.060 --> 00:49:30.420]   Christ is the eternal mystery.
[00:49:30.420 --> 00:49:33.220]   Two natures in one person.
[00:49:33.220 --> 00:49:34.220]   You can't understand it.
[00:49:34.220 --> 00:49:35.220]   Don't try to.
[00:49:35.220 --> 00:49:36.220]   Don't be a fool.
[00:49:36.220 --> 00:49:39.580]   New birth, of course you can't understand it.
[00:49:39.580 --> 00:49:41.260]   It's God's miracle.
[00:49:41.260 --> 00:49:47.060]   Like the wind, don't try to.
[00:49:47.060 --> 00:49:48.420]   What then are you to do?
[00:49:48.420 --> 00:49:51.820]   Well, emulate Mary's example.
[00:49:51.820 --> 00:50:00.660]   Though you may feel baffled and that you don't understand, if you grant me this much, that
[00:50:00.660 --> 00:50:05.700]   at any rate you've now come to see that it is what God does, not what you do, well then
[00:50:05.700 --> 00:50:13.900]   follow Mary and say, "All right, carry on."
[00:50:13.900 --> 00:50:16.420]   That's what she said in effect.
[00:50:16.420 --> 00:50:22.980]   Behold the handmaid of the Lord, be ye done to me according to thy will.
[00:50:22.980 --> 00:50:28.060]   Just as you are not understanding, baffled, bewildered, perplexed, if you're conscious
[00:50:28.060 --> 00:50:32.620]   that God has started something in your life, I say stop trying to understand, just turn
[00:50:32.620 --> 00:50:38.380]   to him and say, "Go on, go on."
[00:50:38.380 --> 00:50:41.020]   Submit.
[00:50:41.020 --> 00:50:44.220]   Allow him to go on speaking.
[00:50:44.220 --> 00:50:46.940]   Allow him to go on acting.
[00:50:46.940 --> 00:50:48.820]   Simply do what he tells you.
[00:50:48.820 --> 00:50:51.660]   Obey what you're beginning to feel within you.
[00:50:51.660 --> 00:50:56.020]   Go on, I say.
[00:50:56.020 --> 00:51:02.620]   And if God has started dealing with you, he won't give it up.
[00:51:02.620 --> 00:51:10.260]   He'll bring you to the point when some Elizabeth will say something to you and you'll know.
[00:51:10.260 --> 00:51:14.460]   That you have been born again.
[00:51:14.460 --> 00:51:19.540]   You'll be amazed at yourself, astonished, surprised.
[00:51:19.540 --> 00:51:24.780]   You'll be humbled, feel humiliated, and yet you'll rejoice in it and glory in it.
[00:51:24.780 --> 00:51:31.260]   You'll praise God and you'll give all the glory.
[00:51:31.260 --> 00:51:37.140]   To his dearly beloved only begotten son, who though he was equal with God and thought it
[00:51:37.140 --> 00:51:45.020]   not robbery to be equal with God, humbled himself and made himself of no reputation.
[00:51:45.020 --> 00:51:53.740]   And was born as a babe in Bethlehem and put in a manger and went willingly to the death
[00:51:53.740 --> 00:51:55.820]   of the cross for you.
[00:51:55.820 --> 00:52:02.740]   You'll give him all the glory and he will say, "I am amazing though it is, I am what
[00:52:02.740 --> 00:52:07.580]   I am by the grace of God.
[00:52:07.580 --> 00:52:15.300]   Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift."
[00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:16.980]   Amen.
[00:52:16.980 --> 00:52:22.660]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
