[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500]   [Music]
[00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.580]   Our first email arrived on October 3rd from Marcus in Los Angeles, and since, over the
[00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:15.660]   past eight months, another 100 emails followed, all of them asking about the Ravi Zacharias
[00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.640]   sex scandal.
[00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.940]   Our emails can be basically boiled down into three questions.
[00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.540]   "Professor John, how are you processing the tragedy yourself?"
[00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.780]   "How should we think of his ministry legacy now?"
[00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:32.620]   And "What would you say to those who are shaped deeply or were even converted through
[00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:35.700]   his influence?"
[00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.540]   So even though your two ministries didn't overlap much, you got a lot of emails about
[00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.700]   this, like this one, a representative email from a listener named Jonah.
[00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.840]   "Hello Pastor John, with the substantiated allegations of sexual immorality in the life
[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.740]   of Ravi Zacharias, how should we process it and respond to it?
[00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:57.660]   The initial impulse seems to be to delete him, to ignore him, and to never talk about
[00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:58.980]   him again.
[00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.940]   But that's not what we do with David, a man after God's own heart who infamously
[00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:09.620]   committed sins of lust and adultery leading to pregnancy, deception, and murder.
[00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:14.780]   David is a man of great faith we talk about and celebrate today despite his serious sins.
[00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.460]   Is it wrong to defend contemporary spiritual leaders in spite of their sexual sin?
[00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.540]   Does the death of a teacher factor into this decision, as in, would it be more dangerous
[00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.300]   to defend a living teacher susceptible to greater failures?
[00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:33.820]   Also, I know a number of people who have come to faith because of Ravi.
[00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.620]   What would you say to encourage a believer now enduring the trial of having their spiritual
[00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.860]   father torn down because of his own sin?"
[00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:50.940]   Well, let me begin with perhaps a word about why I would be so slow to speak.
[00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:56.940]   One of the reasons is wanting to know everything I should know, and the other is I just cannot
[00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:06.460]   imagine the sorrow that family members and very close associates must feel.
[00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:16.180]   And for people to publicly assess and criticize a husband, a father, a very long-term friend
[00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.340]   must be horrible.
[00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.100]   And so now I'm going to be a part of that.
[00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.460]   And so I get it.
[00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:27.180]   I mean, I just think the person is right to ask this question.
[00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.780]   Those hundred people are right to ask, "Okay, Piper, you knew him.
[00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.340]   How are you responding in your heart and mind to this?"
[00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.340]   So here we go.
[00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:44.780]   Let me begin with some biblical background of gospel ministers who for a season spoke
[00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:52.140]   the truth in useful ways and then made shipwreck of their lives and indeed their faith.
[00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.420]   These illustrations that I'm using from the Bible, I'm thinking here of Judas, Demas,
[00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:04.380]   and Hymenaeus, all of whom are explicitly named by Jesus and Paul.
[00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:11.900]   According to John 12, verse 4, Judas was very critical of Mary's anointing Jesus' feet
[00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:19.540]   with an expensive perfume, and he said, "Why was this ointment not sold for 300 denarii
[00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.140]   and given to the poor?"
[00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.940]   And John comments, he said this not because he cared about the poor, but because he was
[00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:30.060]   a thief, and having charge of the money bag, he used to help himself from what was put
[00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.060]   into it.
[00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.980]   So in other words, for a long time, three years, say, Judas was abusing the Lord's
[00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:43.260]   trust by stealing what others had given to the ministry, and I assume that during all
[00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:50.260]   this time, he was preaching the gospel of the kingdom, that he was sent out two by two
[00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:56.420]   with others, that he worked miracles, that he enjoyed the most intimate conversations
[00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:01.460]   with the Son of God, Jesus Christ, all the while being a son of perdition.
[00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:03.620]   John 17, 12.
[00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:12.540]   This deception was so exceptional that none of the other 12 even suspected him of sedition
[00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:18.700]   and betrayal, because they were stunned at the Last Supper when Jesus said, "It's
[00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.220]   one of you who's going to betray me."
[00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.620]   They didn't all look at Judas and say, "Whoa, of course it's Judas."
[00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.260]   He was a master of deceit.
[00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:33.420]   And what if, among the many people who were converted into followers of Jesus, some of
[00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:40.780]   them had been healed by Judas and had responded to his preaching with faith in Jesus, which
[00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:45.580]   wasâ€”his preaching was so orthodox, so apparently authentic.
[00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:50.500]   No apostles were looking at him saying, "Well, Judas never gets it right."
[00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:51.500]   They weren't.
[00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:52.500]   He was getting it right.
[00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.460]   He was preaching the truth.
[00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:59.380]   And lest anyone think that a phony apostle can't do miracles, remember the words of
[00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:04.300]   Jesus in Matthew 7, 22, "On that day many will say to me, 'Lord, Lord, did we not
[00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.860]   prophesy in your name and cast out demons in your name and do many mighty works in your
[00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:09.940]   name?'
[00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:14.420]   And then will I declare to them, 'I never knew you.
[00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:16.660]   Depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.'"
[00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:25.060]   And those works of lawlessness would, of course, include things like pervasive deception, greedy,
[00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:32.500]   lavish use of ministry funds, harmful manipulation of other people for your own private pleasures,
[00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:38.460]   adulterous dalliances, continually making provision for the flesh against the explicit
[00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:42.140]   command of the apostle in Romans 13.
[00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:43.780]   And then there's Demas.
[00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:49.860]   Twice we hear from Paul that he is a faithful partner in gospel work alongside Paul.
[00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:56.780]   Colossians 4, 14, "Luke, the beloved physician, greets you, so does Demas, greets you."
[00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:04.540]   Philemon 1, 23, "Epiphras greets you, and so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke,
[00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:07.740]   my fellow workers."
[00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:15.180]   Demas is ranked as a fellow worker in the gospel alongside Luke of all people.
[00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:23.020]   And then in his last letter, 2 Timothy 4, 10, come these horrible words, "Demas, in
[00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:29.500]   love with this present age, has deserted me and gone to Thessalonica."
[00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:37.420]   So it appears that for several years, Demas was a trusted gospel partner with Paul, just
[00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:40.240]   like Judas was with Jesus.
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:45.100]   During that time, there's no reason to think that he didn't preach the gospel truly and
[00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:50.580]   that people came to faith along with faith through Paul's preaching.
[00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:54.420]   Otherwise Paul would have sent him home like he did John Mark.
[00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:59.660]   You go home, you're not ready, Demas, and he never did that.
[00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:07.500]   But there came a time when Demas' true colors were revealed, namely what he really loved.
[00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:18.500]   It was not true spiritual reality, but only what this age was offering him through religious
[00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:26.580]   workâ€”things like association with notable people, access to money, experiences of power,
[00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:32.140]   accolades for eloquence, commendations for courage.
[00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:41.540]   There are plenty of worldly pleasures to be had doing so-called otherworldly work.
[00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:47.580]   But Demas decided to stop playing the game and he abandoned Paul.
[00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:50.740]   And then thirdly, there's Hymenaeus.
[00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:59.700]   In 1 Timothy 1, 20, Paul says to Timothy, "Wage the good warfare, holding faith with
[00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:01.860]   a good conscience."
[00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:03.620]   I'm underlining that.
[00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:05.340]   With a good conscience.
[00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:10.820]   By rejecting this, namely, faith with a good conscience.
[00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:18.100]   "Some have made shipwreck of their faith, among whom are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom
[00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:22.660]   I have handed over to Satan that they might learn not to blaspheme."
[00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:24.420]   They appeared to have faith.
[00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:26.340]   Well, what happened?
[00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:30.220]   They did not hold faith in a good conscience.
[00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:31.820]   What does that mean?
[00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:38.900]   It means that over time, they began to do things for which their conscience condemned
[00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:39.900]   them.
[00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:46.900]   But instead of repenting, they found ways to dull their conscience until their conscience
[00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:54.300]   was so seared that they could justify behaviors which were simply appalling, even to the point
[00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:57.220]   where Paul said they made shipwreck of their faith.
[00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:05.820]   A double life lived contrary to the Christian conscience is a shipwreck about to happen.
[00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:10.700]   So the lessons from Judas, Demas, and Hymenaeus are many.
[00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:12.460]   Here's three.
[00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:20.740]   One, soul-saving, Christ-exalting truth may be spoken by hypocrites.
[00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:27.980]   Two, forsaking a good conscience is prelude to moral disaster.
[00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:35.660]   Three, the amassing of money and the pursuit of lavish lifestyles in ministry are the alarm
[00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:39.060]   bells of the love of this age.
[00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:45.340]   Now let me make two observations specifically about Ravi in particular.
[00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:55.900]   First, Ravi's way of publicly narrating his past personal experiences really troubled
[00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:58.780]   me.
[00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:06.300]   I always found him difficult to listen to for that very reason.
[00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:11.940]   His rhetorical style was very distinct in this regard.
[00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:14.920]   Go to listen to any of his sermons, you'll hear it.
[00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:23.940]   He would recall an encounter with someone, and then he would proceed to narrate the interchange
[00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:31.780]   with exact quotations, "So-and-so said this," and then "I said this," and then "So-and-so
[00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:34.180]   responded with this."
[00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:41.220]   And I don't recall him cautioning the audience that, "Actually, these are approximations
[00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:46.160]   at best of my memory," and what was actually said.
[00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:51.620]   I don't like that kind of pretense of precision in remembered narration.
[00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:58.780]   It sounded careless to me at best and dishonest at worst.
[00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:05.860]   At any rate, it really made me uncomfortable, and looking back, I can't help but wonder
[00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:13.260]   if it was a symptom of looseness with truth about his experience.
[00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:18.980]   Here's a second observation, and it's way more important than what I just said.
[00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:27.500]   There's a lesson to be learned from Ravi's manipulation of people, a lesson to be learned
[00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:31.660]   about the need for tethered sympathy.
[00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:39.500]   And what I mean is this, every time sympathy is called for, it needs to be tethered to
[00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:45.060]   the truth so that it is given lavishly.
[00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:53.000]   Sympathy is given lavishly when the truth calls for it and is withheld when the truth
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.420]   clashes with it.
[00:11:55.420 --> 00:12:02.660]   And we usually think of this issue of tethered sympathy with regard to the victims of abuse
[00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:06.780]   who finally step forward at great risk and tell the truth.
[00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:12.580]   And at that moment, it can be very controversial to say that there should be tethered sympathy,
[00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:18.780]   sympathy that abounds and blesses and helps and heals in accord with truth.
[00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:25.300]   But it seems to me there is another lesson to be learned, namely a lesson about the value
[00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:36.100]   of tethered sympathy upstream from the crisis of revealed abuse, namely the point at which
[00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:39.380]   the abuse was happening.
[00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:47.380]   How did Ravi manipulate people into sinfully sending him nude pictures?
[00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:54.020]   How did he manipulate people into sinfully providing him with sexual stimulation?
[00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:59.220]   He did it by demanding untethered sympathy.
[00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:06.940]   He portrayed himself as an embattled, burdened, wounded warrior in the righteous cause of
[00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:08.780]   the gospel.
[00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:17.780]   And ironically, he turned his position of power into a form of neediness and woundedness.
[00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:26.100]   And then he tried to coerce untethered sympathy under the guise of calling for kingdom therapy
[00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:28.220]   for the wounded warrior.
[00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:31.260]   Now I have seen this kind of manipulation, Tony.
[00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:40.620]   I have seen this kind of demand and manipulation for untethered sympathy repeatedly among fallen
[00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:42.280]   Christian leaders.
[00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:44.300]   The burdens are so great.
[00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:46.500]   The wounds are so many.
[00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:49.260]   Those who understand me are so few.
[00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:52.420]   The weight of faithful ministry, oh, it is so great.
[00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:54.980]   I deserve some relief.
[00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:58.460]   Have some sympathy on this poor, wounded warrior.
[00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:00.820]   Empathize with your embattled hero.
[00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:06.860]   I need your body if I'm to carry on in the Lord's work.
[00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:13.820]   To which the administrative assistant or the old college flame or the teenage boy in the
[00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:18.700]   locker room should say, "That's disgusting.
[00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:20.900]   Don't ever talk to me like that again."
[00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:23.460]   My sympathy is not for sale.
[00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:27.140]   It's tethered to truth and righteousness.
[00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:36.460]   And I think the last thing I would say to those who came to Christ under Ravi's ministry
[00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:44.740]   or who had their faith mightily strengthened by what he taught is this.
[00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:53.700]   Don't let the imperfections and failures of men turn you away from the perfections and
[00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:59.020]   the triumphs of Christ, who will never, never fail you.
[00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:00.580]   Amen and amen.
[00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:01.580]   Christ does not fail us.
