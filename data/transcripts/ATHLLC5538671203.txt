[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.640]   - Hello and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.560]   a show about upgrading your life, money and travel.
[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:09.720]   I'm your host, Chris Hutchins,
[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.300]   and if you've been watching this podcast recently on YouTube,
[00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.880]   you'll have noticed two things.
[00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.980]   First, I have a new studio setup.
[00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.360]   I signed up for Kevin Chen's Dream Studio course,
[00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.120]   which I'll link to in the show notes because it's fantastic
[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.860]   and got so many great tips
[00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.240]   that ultimately led to what you see today.
[00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.400]   It's not quite done, but it's almost there.
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.600]   And I even have a setup for in-person interviews,
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.140]   which you'll see the first version of in a few weeks.
[00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:33.980]   But more importantly is number two,
[00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.560]   you'll see that I have a few skateboards
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.200]   hanging on the wall behind me.
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.680]   That's not just 'cause they look cool.
[00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.920]   I have loved skateboarding since I was a kid
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.000]   and I still skate a bit today.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.480]   Well, what you probably can't see
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.240]   is that one of those skateboards is signed
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.880]   by none other than Tony Hawk,
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.240]   who I've looked up to for so many years,
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.480]   which is why it is surreal
[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.040]   that I'm sitting down with Tony for today's episode.
[00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.580]   He is one of the most decorated athletes in the world,
[00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.920]   having turned pro at 14.
[00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.520]   And by 16, he was considered
[00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.960]   the best competitive skateboarder on earth.
[00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.280]   He was world champion for 12 years in a row,
[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.040]   launched a video game franchise with 30 million games sold.
[00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.040]   He also runs a skate brand, an awesome nonprofit,
[00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.800]   a clothing brand, and has made hundreds of appearances
[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.480]   in movies, magazines, and TV shows.
[00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.080]   We're gonna talk about his career,
[00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.020]   how he's pushed himself to achieve things
[00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.840]   that so many people thought were impossible,
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.340]   what lessons we can take away
[00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.700]   from all of that time skateboarding,
[00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.780]   what he's learned being a parent to four kids,
[00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.720]   and some of his favorite travel hacks.
[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.020]   We also shot this in person at Tony's studio
[00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.060]   with an awesome three camera setup.
[00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.140]   So if you wanna check out the video from this episode,
[00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.660]   I'll put a link to the YouTube channel in the show notes.
[00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.460]   All right, let's jump in right after this.
[00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.760]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions
[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.260]   about life, money, and so much more,
[00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.840]   but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.280]   in your situation,
[00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.880]   which actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.160]   So I wanna introduce you to today's sponsor, Long Angle.
[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.000]   Long Angle is a community of high net worth individuals
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.160]   with backgrounds in everything from technology,
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.260]   finance, medicine, to real estate,
[00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.680]   law, manufacturing, and more.
[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.080]   I'm a member of Long Angle.
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.080]   I've loved being a part of the community,
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.360]   and I've even had one of the founders, Tad Fallows,
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.500]   join me on all the hacks in episode 87
[00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.860]   to talk about alternative investments.
[00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.580]   Now, the majority of Long Angle members
[00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.400]   are first generation wealth,
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.480]   young, highly successful individuals
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.600]   who join the community to share knowledge
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:29.940]   and learn from each other
[00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.560]   in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.840]   On top of that, members also get access
[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.160]   to some unique private market investment opportunities.
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.580]   Like I said, I'm a member,
[00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.720]   and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.720]   because you're getting advice and feedback
[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.200]   from people in a similar situation to you
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.640]   on everything from your investment portfolio,
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:49.980]   to your children's education,
[00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.280]   to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.740]   So many of these conversations
[00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.960]   aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.620]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets,
[00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.480]   which is their minimum for membership,
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.640]   I encourage you to check out Long Angle,
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.720]   and it's totally free to join.
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.860]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more,
[00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.380]   and if you choose to apply,
[00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.320]   be sure to let them know you heard about it here.
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:18.060]   Again, that's longangle, A-N-G-L-E, .com.
[00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.300]   (upbeat music)
[00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.520]   Tony, welcome to the show.
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:22.560]   Thank you.
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:23.980]   Yeah, so before we jump in,
[00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.320]   what is one thing you think most people just don't get
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.240]   about skateboarding or skateboard culture?
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.640]   The amount of discipline it takes.
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.200]   I think that there's still a stigma that skaters,
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.980]   especially people who make their living from skateboarding
[00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.380]   or from riding their skateboards,
[00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.720]   are slackers, are stoners.
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.760]   They just get up late, they do what they want,
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.960]   they go trespassing, they go skate.
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.520]   And to get to a certain level of skating,
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.280]   to get to some of the more difficult maneuvers,
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.280]   it takes years of discipline and perseverance, pain.
[00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:01.060]   And I think that's lost in the noise of,
[00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.640]   these guys are, they're rebels,
[00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.440]   they got crazy hairdos, they go against the grain.
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.560]   It's like, those things are also true in a lot of ways,
[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.720]   but they do that out of,
[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.440]   it's more out of function of where they came from,
[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:19.440]   because especially in the early 90s, mid 90s,
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.440]   there were no places to skate.
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:22.960]   And you had to break into places,
[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.320]   you had to hop fences and go to schoolyards
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.540]   or go to plazas to find any type of terrain.
[00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.880]   And then skaters got labeled as outcasts
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.400]   and outlaws through that.
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.800]   Yeah, I remember flipping over like,
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.000]   Shays' lounges at the pool and trying to grind
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.260]   the rails on, there was nothing to do back then.
[00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:44.720]   - I know you have a lot of discipline, right?
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.320]   You talk about how important it was.
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.580]   Going back to the early days,
[00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.700]   was there anything about your upbringing
[00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:54.080]   that kind of drove that competition and determination?
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.880]   - I was just always very determined.
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.040]   That was my mom's best explanation for it,
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.960]   because people would say I was a terror
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.720]   and I was a nightmare and I was relentless.
[00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.840]   And she's like, he's just very determined.
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.420]   That was her nice way of summarizing my behavior.
[00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:12.360]   But I think that I wanted to figure things out
[00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.520]   and I was gonna do it at all costs.
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.460]   Like I wanted to, I mean, I played baseball and basketball,
[00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.600]   but I didn't thrive and only because of my size.
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.760]   You know, I was committed to it and I was doing the work
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.080]   and I was trying to get in the mix,
[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.640]   but I just, I didn't have the strength
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.360]   or the height to really make a difference.
[00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.160]   'Cause I was really small for my age.
[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.720]   And then when I found skating,
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.200]   I still had the same disadvantage,
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.660]   but there was something about it
[00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:38.840]   that was much more creative that I enjoyed.
[00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.120]   It wasn't a team sport.
[00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.920]   I didn't have to listen to a coach or rely on the team.
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.320]   And there was something about that that spoke to me,
[00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.440]   but also just the whole culture
[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:53.000]   and how people's attitudes was very do it yourself.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.500]   And they were proactive and I loved it.
[00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:57.920]   - I know you said it's not a team sport,
[00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:59.680]   but there were a lot of other people involved.
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:00.960]   There were a lot of other skaters growing up.
[00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.920]   - It wasn't that it was so individualistic
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.400]   that it was like, I'm just on my own mission.
[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.040]   I love the community of it.
[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:08.900]   I love that you could go to the skate park
[00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:11.120]   and be trying to learn something
[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.000]   and suddenly people rally around you
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.320]   because they just want to see you succeed.
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:16.760]   And then you have the support.
[00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.800]   And in that sense, you have a team,
[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:23.800]   but you're not relying on each other for the,
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.160]   I don't know, coordination or anything like that.
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:27.920]   It was very much like, you can do it.
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.060]   You got it, all right.
[00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:30.560]   And then someone else is trying something else
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:31.920]   and then you get behind that.
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:33.760]   And I think that spoke to me a lot too,
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:38.280]   because I was really small for my age.
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.060]   I didn't feel like I fit in anywhere.
[00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:43.040]   I was bullied a lot, mostly because of my size,
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:45.640]   but also just because I was not the cool kid.
[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:47.700]   And then when I found skateboarding,
[00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:49.580]   there were a bunch of people like me
[00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:50.660]   all trying to find their way
[00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:53.380]   and they all connected through skateboarding.
[00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:55.780]   - I look back to my childhood and I remember like those days
[00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:56.820]   I was not the cool kid.
[00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:59.580]   I was like the computer nerd and skateboard nerd.
[00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:02.100]   And you know, you found our tribe, if you will.
[00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:02.940]   - Yeah.
[00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:04.980]   - I didn't have, I think the determination you did.
[00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:07.540]   I remember all I wanted was to skate
[00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:10.780]   at like an amazing level and it just never clicked for me.
[00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:13.380]   I found determination other places later in life,
[00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:15.580]   but it was so hard.
[00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:17.540]   You, I've seen, you know, documented,
[00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:19.420]   fortunately a lot of your experiences in life
[00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:23.740]   are documented, against all odds, against all pain,
[00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:26.500]   I remember watching the X Games in '99
[00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.540]   where you're trying to do your 900 12 times in a row,
[00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:31.200]   falling even this year,
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:35.100]   trying to kick flip for five, 10 minutes after surgery.
[00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:38.540]   Like, what do you think allows you to go
[00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:39.540]   and just keep going?
[00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:41.340]   Because I remember sitting in the garage,
[00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:43.780]   trying to kick flip for hours.
[00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:45.380]   And then I just gave up at some point
[00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:46.980]   and I just couldn't keep going.
[00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:50.820]   - I think firstly that I have convinced myself
[00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:52.900]   that whatever it is I'm trying is possible.
[00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:56.580]   And so I just have to figure out the right approach
[00:07:56.580 --> 00:08:00.780]   to make it so, and that comes in a lot of forms.
[00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:03.760]   But I do feel like, especially if I go to try a new trick,
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:05.620]   it's like, I have every element of this trick.
[00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:09.420]   I know how to spin, I know how to flip my board.
[00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:11.640]   I have landed in similar fashions.
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:13.900]   So it's like, how do I combine all those elements
[00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:15.580]   to make this one thing work?
[00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:17.820]   And I think I rely on that so much
[00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:20.780]   that I'm willing to push through pain
[00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:23.220]   and exhaustion to get there.
[00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:24.340]   It doesn't always work.
[00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:27.860]   Like when you talk about, saw the 900 was 12 tries,
[00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:31.220]   those 12 tries are representative of thousands of tries.
[00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:34.200]   I tried that trick for 10 years.
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:37.000]   So 12 tries was nothing.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:37.900]   You know what I mean?
[00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:39.320]   - They're just the 12 I got to witness.
[00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:41.040]   - No, but I'm saying it, but I understand
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:42.800]   that if people saw that from the outside,
[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:44.000]   they're like, oh, he won't give up.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.680]   And I was like, yeah, you have no idea
[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:47.320]   how deep that not give up goes,
[00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:50.220]   especially for that particular move.
[00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:53.800]   I would try dozens of tries in one session
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:56.240]   only to walk away with a broken rib.
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:57.080]   So--
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:58.320]   - Heal up and come back and do it again.
[00:08:58.320 --> 00:08:59.800]   - Heal up and come back and try again.
[00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:02.160]   Actually, after the broken rib, that put me on pause.
[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.400]   That one, I had actually stepped away from that trick
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:06.220]   after getting hurt like that.
[00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:09.840]   And at some point thought, I've given it everything I have,
[00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:12.480]   I've fully committed to it, and that's what happens.
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.880]   So maybe it's not in the cards.
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:18.520]   - At the time, did you think I'm quitting on this endeavor?
[00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:19.360]   - I did, yeah.
[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:20.580]   Actually, after I broke my rib, I was like,
[00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:23.160]   I had every element, I had every piece of it.
[00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:24.460]   I had the landing, I had everything.
[00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:27.560]   And so if it didn't work, it's never gonna work.
[00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:31.880]   But in that one instance at the X Games,
[00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:33.800]   the reason I even tried it was because
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:35.240]   it was the best trick event.
[00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:37.720]   I had a trick in mind for what I wanted to do
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.260]   that I had made once before.
[00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:40.600]   And so I thought, I'm just gonna try it.
[00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:41.960]   That's my best trick.
[00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:43.400]   I'm gonna try to get to that trick.
[00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.320]   And I got to it very early.
[00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:47.320]   So I didn't really have anything else planned.
[00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:50.440]   And so the announcer, actually at the time,
[00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:52.280]   the announcer that was on site said,
[00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:54.120]   oh, let's see one of those 900 attempts.
[00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:55.360]   That's what started it.
[00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:57.640]   - Was that part of your being,
[00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:58.800]   was being encouraged by others
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:00.040]   or was it internal motivation?
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:02.200]   - No, I mean, I probably would have tried it anyway
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:05.400]   'cause it's like, yeah, that would be my next trick
[00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:07.200]   that I'd like to accomplish,
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:09.480]   would be the next best trick for sure.
[00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:13.520]   And so I tried it more to appease the crowd.
[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:15.580]   Like, this is what it looks like.
[00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:18.880]   And then somewhere around the third or fourth try,
[00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:21.280]   my speed was consistent, my spin was consistent.
[00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:23.040]   I started spotting the landing.
[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:24.820]   And in previous attempts,
[00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:28.420]   I only ever spotted the landing maybe one out of five tries
[00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:30.960]   because the ramps were all pretty terrible back then.
[00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:32.880]   You couldn't rely on the speed
[00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:34.840]   or the walls weren't the same.
[00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:37.480]   So you're always kind of struggling to adjust.
[00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:40.340]   And that ramp was built really well.
[00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:43.780]   So I didn't have to struggle with the construction.
[00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:45.880]   It was more like I could rely on the speed
[00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:47.120]   and the trueness of it.
[00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:50.160]   So after about my third or fourth try, I can see it.
[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:51.100]   I see it every time.
[00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:53.820]   I might as well try to make it again.
[00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:55.520]   And when I did try to make it,
[00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:58.100]   the first time when I tried to put it on the wall,
[00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:01.300]   I fell forward, but I didn't fall forward so hard
[00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:03.300]   that I got hurt again.
[00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:05.440]   And that was the key because it was like,
[00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:07.420]   oh, I can adjust the landing
[00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:10.540]   and I can try to get more in my back foot.
[00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:13.420]   And then I basically shifted my weight mid-spin
[00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:16.140]   so that when I landed, I was more on the back foot
[00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:18.040]   and I was too far on the back foot.
[00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:20.900]   And then I shot backwards.
[00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:21.740]   - Now you just have to readjust.
[00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:22.780]   - We call that shooting out.
[00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:25.300]   So the first one, I was too top heavy.
[00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:26.140]   I fell forward.
[00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:27.820]   The second one, the ones I tried to make.
[00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:30.020]   And then that next one, I shot out.
[00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:32.520]   And it was like, that was the magic moment
[00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:34.700]   because it was like, we'll split the difference.
[00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:35.540]   And that's it.
[00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:37.180]   And then that's when it worked.
[00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:38.500]   - Let's say someone listening is hearing this story.
[00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:40.860]   They're like, this guy's not afraid of anything.
[00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:42.540]   Are there other sports, other things in life
[00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:43.780]   that you have fear from?
[00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:44.600]   - Oh, for sure.
[00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:46.820]   I surf and I don't like big surf.
[00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:48.560]   People say, well, you ride these giant ramps.
[00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:49.500]   Yeah, but if I fall,
[00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:52.060]   the giant ramp doesn't crash on top of me
[00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:53.540]   and hold me underwater.
[00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:54.820]   You know what I mean?
[00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:56.500]   My brother, he is a surfer
[00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:58.860]   and that's how I got into skateboarding, my older brother.
[00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:00.300]   But when I would go surf with him
[00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:02.220]   and he has plenty of experience,
[00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:03.580]   he'd go out to pretty heavy stuff.
[00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:05.700]   And it's just like, I like riding a big wave
[00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:07.460]   but I don't want to suffer the consequences
[00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:09.180]   of falling on one.
[00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:12.500]   - My first experience surfing was a friend of mine took me
[00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:14.500]   and he was like, let's just try these on a short board.
[00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:15.940]   I had no idea what I was doing.
[00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:16.780]   - Yeah, a great first experience on a short board.
[00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:18.940]   - It was a horrible first experience.
[00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:21.220]   And then the next one was like Hawaii long board,
[00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:22.060]   super chill.
[00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:23.260]   I was like, oh, I could get back into this.
[00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:24.100]   - Oh yeah.
[00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:25.400]   Well, I'll tell you, I have surfed through my years
[00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:27.720]   because my brother wouldn't allow me to exist
[00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:30.800]   without at least a foot or a toe in the water, so to speak.
[00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:33.700]   But I have fallen in love with the wave machines,
[00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:37.620]   the wave pools, because they are consistent.
[00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:42.620]   They're not too scary and they are like skate parks
[00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:46.700]   because when you go surfing out in the wild,
[00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:48.060]   you never really know what you're going to get.
[00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:49.940]   You get waves and sometimes they're good.
[00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:50.900]   Sometimes they're not good.
[00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:53.380]   You've got to figure out kind of how to navigate nature
[00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:55.180]   and where the swell is going to hit.
[00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:57.660]   Those things are, the waves are always good.
[00:12:57.660 --> 00:12:59.100]   They're always going to barrel.
[00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:02.900]   And so in that sense, you have what I consider a skate park
[00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:05.840]   to try to learn tricks and try to learn techniques.
[00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:07.740]   So yeah, I get it.
[00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:08.660]   It's not the purest thing.
[00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:11.580]   It's not, you're not out in nature,
[00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:14.020]   but for me, it's just a controlled environment
[00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:16.460]   and it very much feels like skateboarding.
[00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:18.760]   I've been waiting for a time where I'm near
[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:21.300]   one of these wave parks, because I don't think there's one
[00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:23.420]   near San Francisco, at least close enough.
[00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:24.880]   - L'Amour, Fresno.
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:28.660]   - Okay, not go out for a few hours and then come back.
[00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:29.480]   - Yeah.
[00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:32.300]   - So you've got this crazy determination with skateboarding.
[00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:35.520]   Did you ever figure out or do you know the secret
[00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:37.740]   to applying that to something else?
[00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:40.380]   I think for my personal life, there are things
[00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:43.180]   where I'm like, I'm wildly obsessed with optimizing travel,
[00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:45.220]   but that doesn't mean that I can take that same thing
[00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:47.700]   and apply it necessarily to go learn a kickflip.
[00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:49.380]   Though, you've somewhat inspired me to do that
[00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:50.500]   as soon as I get home today.
[00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:53.420]   - I think I learned the value of patience and perseverance
[00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:58.420]   and that I've transcended to being a parent,
[00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:01.540]   to being a business owner, to travel,
[00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:02.860]   to pretty much everything.
[00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:05.200]   I learned all that through skating.
[00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:07.420]   - And is there a way that you applied that?
[00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:09.700]   It's not always natural for someone who's,
[00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:11.940]   I could do this as hard, I could try everything
[00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:13.620]   and then they get to work and they're like, oh, it's hard.
[00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:15.620]   Like, how do you rewire your brain to say,
[00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:17.220]   oh, well, I know how to do this with skateboarding.
[00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:20.460]   - Yeah, I'm also trying to reach back to remembering,
[00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:22.780]   well, how was I able to figure this out?
[00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:26.420]   I think that with parenting, especially,
[00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:28.220]   it's so easy to get frustrated and give up.
[00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:29.040]   It really is.
[00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:30.380]   I get it, it's hard, man,
[00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:32.220]   especially when your kids are relentless
[00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:35.900]   and they're difficult and you want to just yell and can't,
[00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:37.060]   that's not effective.
[00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:40.580]   And so you've got to figure out how to sort of
[00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:44.020]   change your approach and to see what is effective.
[00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:45.700]   And that is really hard.
[00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:47.700]   But I learned that through skating
[00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:49.740]   and I've had plenty of kids,
[00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:52.300]   so I've had time to figure it out even more so.
[00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:56.580]   And I learned the value of persistence and determination.
[00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:58.660]   And you do see the results eventually,
[00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:01.360]   but it's not some wow moment always.
[00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:03.960]   Take your small wins as long the way.
[00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:05.700]   - I'm early on the parenting journey
[00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:07.240]   with one at two and six months,
[00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:10.400]   but I've seen some small wins and it's like, whew.
[00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:13.460]   - Yeah, and those exponentially get better.
[00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:15.700]   And you can see that, oh, well, I planted the seed.
[00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:18.300]   I'll tell you what I did with all my kids early on.
[00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:21.320]   And it was hard 'cause I was very much,
[00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:23.180]   in the early days, kind of a single parent.
[00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:24.500]   I just travel with them.
[00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:27.300]   And it wasn't a question of like, oh, I got to go,
[00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:28.540]   I'm gonna have to find care.
[00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:29.580]   It was just, we're going.
[00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:30.860]   In the beginning, that was super hard,
[00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:32.080]   especially when they're toddlers
[00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:33.460]   and they don't have patience.
[00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:35.380]   We didn't have iPhones or anything like that.
[00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:37.820]   I remember I took my son, my oldest son,
[00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:39.380]   I took him to Japan when he was four
[00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:41.980]   because I had the opportunity to do some skate demos.
[00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:44.020]   No one was paying me to do skate demos at the time.
[00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:45.900]   I was struggling to pay bills.
[00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:49.460]   And it was like this brand in Osaka said,
[00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:51.220]   oh, we want you to come to our skate shop
[00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:54.620]   and do two skate exhibitions a day in the skate shop.
[00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:56.780]   So they built these little ramps in their skate shop,
[00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:58.980]   like moved all their inventory.
[00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:02.820]   And I brought him along and yeah, it was challenging,
[00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:05.860]   but it made him appreciate different cultures
[00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:07.300]   and travel and things like that.
[00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:10.500]   Later on, he's 30 now, he's adventurous.
[00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:15.500]   He understands and he embraces other cultures
[00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:17.140]   and other ways of life.
[00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:17.980]   You know what I mean?
[00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:18.820]   It's not like everything's so,
[00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:20.860]   ew, it's weird, it's crazy, this food,
[00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:22.460]   or the way they do things.
[00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:24.140]   He's down for it.
[00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:26.080]   - I think in the moment,
[00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:28.140]   we just took a trip with two kids,
[00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:29.580]   two in six months and it's brutal,
[00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:31.740]   but you think, why are we doing this?
[00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:33.460]   And you got to constantly remind yourself,
[00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:34.620]   well, there's a reason we're doing this.
[00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:35.620]   We're doing this to expo.
[00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:37.580]   But I think in those years, it's super hard
[00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:38.420]   because it's like,
[00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:39.860]   they're not gonna remember any of this,
[00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:41.740]   but it does set a precedent
[00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:45.440]   and it sets a way of functioning with your family
[00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:47.180]   that they get used to.
[00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:50.180]   And you'll see other kids try to do that.
[00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:52.460]   Like eventually they're gonna want to bring friends along.
[00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:53.420]   The friends are like, what?
[00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:55.760]   I don't, I can't, where do we go?
[00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:57.300]   What do we do?
[00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:59.640]   And your kids will be dialed in.
[00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:01.940]   - Even adapting ourselves, getting comfortable with,
[00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:05.280]   okay, well, traveling in London with two kids
[00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:08.180]   is very different from two single adults.
[00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:10.340]   And so like, we're trying to get comfortable with that,
[00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:11.260]   which was hard.
[00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:13.720]   And I think it worked really well.
[00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:15.840]   I know you've said skateboarding is a title,
[00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:17.180]   but your favorite title is dad.
[00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:19.460]   Is there anything else you were trying to teach your kids?
[00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:20.700]   Give them that determination.
[00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:21.540]   Do they have it?
[00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:22.380]   Do they see it from you?
[00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:24.660]   - I think they see it from me by example,
[00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:27.960]   but I do feel like there is also a nature over nurture
[00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:32.500]   where I see them and they're all different.
[00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:36.040]   And a couple of them have that relentless determination
[00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:37.960]   and they're gonna see it through against all odds,
[00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:38.960]   against all injury.
[00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:43.660]   One of them was actually kind of so,
[00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:45.760]   so determined and so fearless
[00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:48.700]   that I worried for him when he was young.
[00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:50.860]   I used to say it was my son Keegan,
[00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:52.700]   but I used to say like, you don't babysit Keegan,
[00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:53.980]   you go on death watch.
[00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:56.020]   You're just trying to keep him from hurting himself
[00:17:56.020 --> 00:17:58.340]   because he doesn't understand the consequences
[00:17:58.340 --> 00:17:59.680]   of all the stuff that he's trying to do.
[00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:00.520]   They're all very different,
[00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:05.520]   but I do see that they do have that same sense of commitment.
[00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:09.180]   - And was that a conscious thing
[00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:12.760]   or do you think it was just by watching you have it yourself?
[00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:14.340]   - I think each of them are different,
[00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:18.000]   but they all do see their challenges through.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.080]   Some are just a little more daring with their challenges.
[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:23.980]   And I can't say they got that from me.
[00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:26.600]   I mean, maybe they saw that I would pose a challenge
[00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:28.460]   and then I would see it through for sure.
[00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:30.340]   But like I said, there was one,
[00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:33.800]   like some of my kids were really, really good skaters,
[00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:36.080]   really solid, had the foundational skills,
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:39.200]   but didn't really wanna push their limits too hard
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:41.060]   or put themselves in danger.
[00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:43.200]   And then other ones, one especially,
[00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:45.120]   was not great at skating early on,
[00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:47.000]   didn't wanna put in the hard work
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.640]   to get the foundational skills,
[00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:52.500]   but would try anything and get hurt, didn't care.
[00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:54.920]   - And were you there pushing or supporting
[00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:57.720]   or what was your kind of role to help them grow and evolve?
[00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:00.840]   - It's hard with my position because of course,
[00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:03.600]   I'm qualified to give them advice,
[00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:06.320]   but because I'm dad, they don't wanna hear it.
[00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:08.860]   And I actually have seen it happen time and time again,
[00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:10.460]   where I'll tell them to try something
[00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:12.120]   or to do it a different way.
[00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:14.580]   They don't take my advice
[00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:16.100]   'cause they're determined to do it their way.
[00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:17.200]   One of their friends is like,
[00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:18.920]   "Oh, you should put your foot over here more."
[00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:21.380]   And they do it and it works.
[00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:23.080]   Like, that's what I told you weeks ago.
[00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:27.260]   - I feel like the same lesson applies with spouses as well.
[00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:28.760]   - Maybe a little bit, but they do.
[00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:31.080]   And honestly, it's fun too 'cause they all skate.
[00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:34.080]   And so when we go travel, I mean, they're all adults now,
[00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:36.200]   all of our boys, two are still in college,
[00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:37.760]   three are on their own.
[00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:39.520]   And then my daughter is the only one still at home,
[00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:40.600]   she's 14.
[00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:43.120]   So whenever we travel, they're very self-sufficient,
[00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:45.240]   but what they wanna do when we go places
[00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:46.400]   is to go to the skate parks.
[00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:47.220]   And at some point, he was like,
[00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:50.440]   "You guys, can I get a break from skating maybe?"
[00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:53.560]   So I ended up going with them as their filmer.
[00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:54.580]   - Okay.
[00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:57.160]   - That's my role when we travel together.
[00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:58.060]   - Videographer.
[00:19:58.060 --> 00:19:58.900]   - I am, yes.
[00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:02.540]   - Do you all remember episode 122
[00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:04.860]   where I spoke with chef David Chang
[00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:07.020]   about leveling up your cooking at home?
[00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:10.040]   If not, definitely go back and give it a listen.
[00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:13.980]   But one of his top hacks was using the microwave a lot more.
[00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:16.420]   I'll admit I was a skeptic at first,
[00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:19.260]   but after getting a full set of microwave cookware
[00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:21.900]   from Anyday, I am a total convert
[00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:24.020]   and I am so excited to be partnering with them
[00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:25.300]   for this episode.
[00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:28.380]   Anyday is glass cookware specially designed
[00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:31.640]   to make delicious food from scratch in the microwave.
[00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:34.980]   And honestly, using it feels like a kitchen cheat code
[00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:39.000]   because it speeds up and simplifies the process so much.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.620]   The cookware is 100% plastic free
[00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:44.560]   and you can cook, serve, store, and reheat
[00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:47.720]   all in the same dish that happens to be dishwasher,
[00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:49.920]   freezer, and oven safe too.
[00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:52.560]   And just last week, they worked with David Chang
[00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:55.760]   to launch the beautiful matte black IO collection,
[00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:58.040]   so you should definitely check that out.
[00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:01.400]   To get 15% off our new favorite cookware,
[00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:04.440]   go to allthehacks.com/anyday

[00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:12.560]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/anyday for 15% off.
[00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:18.140]   There are only a few brands I use almost every single day
[00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:19.700]   and Viore is one of them.
[00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:21.600]   And I am so excited to be partnering with them
[00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:22.720]   for this episode.
[00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:25.920]   Viore makes performance apparel that's incredibly versatile.
[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:27.580]   Everything is designed to work out in,
[00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:30.120]   but it doesn't look or feel like it at all.
[00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:31.920]   And it is so freaking comfortable,
[00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:34.000]   you will wanna wear it all the time.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.840]   Seriously, I'm pretty sure it's more comfortable
[00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:37.560]   than whatever you're wearing right now,
[00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:40.160]   unless it's Viore, in which case you know what I mean.
[00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:41.600]   And it's not just for men.
[00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:45.000]   My wife Amy is as obsessed with Viore as I am.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.640]   My personal favorite is the Sunday Performance joggers.
[00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:49.080]   I think I have three pairs of them
[00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:50.560]   and they're probably the most comfortable pants
[00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:51.600]   I've ever owned.
[00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:53.400]   Their products are incredibly versatile
[00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:55.480]   and can be used for just about any activity,
[00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:57.400]   whether it's running, training, yoga,
[00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:59.560]   but they're also great for lounging.
[00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:02.840]   Or I even wear their MetaPants out to a nice dinner.
[00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:05.760]   Honestly, I think Viore is an investment in your happiness.
[00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:07.080]   And for All The Hacks listeners,

[00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:23.640]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/viore.
[00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:26.400]   And get yourself some of the most comfortable
[00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:28.800]   and versatile clothing on the planet.
[00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:31.360]   So we actually talk a lot about travel on the show.
[00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:33.880]   I'm imagining you've been to countless countries.
[00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:35.880]   I don't know if you even keep track.
[00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:37.480]   Is there a favorite?
[00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:39.680]   Are there places that you love going and going back to,
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:41.160]   aside from just the skating there,
[00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:42.600]   might inspire people listening?
[00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:47.400]   Iceland is amazing because the landscape is so diverse.
[00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:50.240]   I can't explain it, but you go there,
[00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:51.600]   as soon as you leave the airport,
[00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:53.000]   it looks like you're on the moon.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.520]   And there's just all this moss covering these rocks,
[00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:58.240]   and there's the Blue Lagoon.
[00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:00.240]   And then as you drive south,
[00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:03.160]   it completely changes into almost like a farm setting.
[00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:04.240]   And then it changes again,
[00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:06.080]   like another half hour into the drive.
[00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:07.760]   And yeah, it can get really cold there,
[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:09.200]   but it's an amazing place.
[00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:12.360]   So my wife and I went there a long time ago,
[00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:14.400]   almost 15 years ago now,
[00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:17.640]   and it felt very untapped.
[00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:19.720]   Definitely wasn't a tourist destination.
[00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:23.280]   And now it feels much more like there is tourism.
[00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:25.400]   But if you just drive out of the city,
[00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:27.320]   you can see some amazing sights.
[00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:29.160]   My general rule is if you go,
[00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:32.800]   not when everyone else goes and leave a little bit outside,
[00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:34.120]   you can have a very different experience.
[00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:36.600]   Yeah, we're not afraid to go way off the beaten path,
[00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:37.520]   which we do a lot.
[00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:40.280]   Other than that, Japan is just so surreal.
[00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:42.120]   It feels like a video game.
[00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:44.840]   We just did an episode on Japan
[00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:46.880]   and we were like three hours in
[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:48.800]   and we covered Tokyo and Kyoto.
[00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:49.640]   Oh yeah.
[00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:50.480]   We couldn't even get close
[00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:52.040]   to comprehending the entire country.
[00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:54.120]   And the guy I was talking to had been there
[00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:55.200]   20 times or something.
[00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:56.320]   And he's just still like,
[00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:58.040]   everywhere I go, I see something new.
[00:23:58.040 --> 00:23:58.880]   So-
[00:23:58.880 --> 00:23:59.720]   Oh, every time.
[00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:00.760]   We brought our kids when they were all,
[00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:03.960]   I brought all of them just before they were teenagers
[00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:06.360]   and they were all mesmerized.
[00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:07.440]   Like it was fascinating.
[00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:09.680]   Even Disneyland, still the Magic Kingdom,
[00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:11.000]   but it's very different.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.400]   Japan's one of the coolest places.
[00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:15.360]   Early on, you traveled a lot as a skater.
[00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:18.360]   Before you'd hit the success you've had now,
[00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:20.480]   I gotta ask a question I know everyone is thinking
[00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:22.640]   because multiple people said I should ask,
[00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:24.000]   racking up all these miles?
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   'Cause I know you weren't making a lot in the early days,
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.640]   especially in that kind of mid part of your career.
[00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:30.680]   What was that like?
[00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:32.560]   You started getting tall, uncomfortable,
[00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:33.400]   were using points,
[00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:35.160]   were you trying to get status and upgrades?
[00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:40.160]   Honestly, I didn't fly first class until I was in my 30s.
[00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:42.800]   Were you optimizing things when you traveled,
[00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:44.760]   thinking, okay, I'm gonna rack up a bunch of miles?
[00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:48.040]   Yeah, but also I just learned how to travel more efficiently
[00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:49.680]   and a little bit lighter,
[00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:52.880]   and how to navigate airports and lines
[00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:56.360]   and where the best security checkpoint is
[00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:58.960]   instead of the one where everyone's just being fed into,
[00:24:58.960 --> 00:24:59.840]   just stuff like that.
[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:02.720]   I guess I learned how to be a better traveler in those days,
[00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:06.420]   but I'd learned the value of frequent flyer miles
[00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:07.260]   through those years,
[00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:09.460]   especially when I wasn't making very much money,
[00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:12.160]   but I still have to travel to go do stuff.
[00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:13.440]   I collected a lot of miles.
[00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:17.760]   I mean, I was a million miler on United very early on.
[00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:19.200]   (laughing)
[00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:21.100]   You know what they sent me for that?
[00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:21.940]   Luggage tax.
[00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:23.000]   Yeah, that was gonna be my guess.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.800]   Like, it's not a very rewarding experience.
[00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:27.240]   Here you go, 10 bucks.
[00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:28.300]   What would some of the things,
[00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:30.400]   if you were telling your favorite travel hacks
[00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:32.600]   to how you make your life efficient when you travel,
[00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:35.640]   whether it's a secret neck pillow or some crazy eye mask?
[00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:39.600]   Well, let's see, I just flew home from New York
[00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:42.180]   and it was last minute, and so I'm in the bulkhead.
[00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:43.320]   It's not some great hack,
[00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:48.100]   but if you want to travel with your laptop or anything else,
[00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:50.620]   'cause you have to put your backpack up in the overhead.
[00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:51.580]   We're getting into the weeds here,
[00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:54.540]   but if you're in the bulkhead,
[00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:58.460]   take your laptop out and put it right under your feet
[00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:01.540]   so that half of it's kind of under your own seat,
[00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:02.460]   and then the other half,
[00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:04.220]   you just kind of lightly put your heels on it.
[00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:06.640]   It'll hide it from the flight attendants.
[00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:07.560]   And then you have your laptop.
[00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:08.820]   You don't have to go up and get it.
[00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:09.660]   Yeah, I love it.
[00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:10.500]   Which is kind of a hassle, right?
[00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:12.520]   Yeah, if you have one of those laptop sleeves,
[00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:13.640]   I like to get a black one
[00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:15.240]   'cause then it just blends in everywhere.
[00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:18.320]   Yeah, I'm pretty good at just hiding it all together.
[00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:20.480]   And then usually I'll have a little bag,
[00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:22.560]   it's actually my toiletry kit,
[00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:27.560]   and then I just stuff my headphones and my iPhone cable.
[00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:28.480]   Everything you need.
[00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:30.520]   Everything I need, but just put that on the side of the seat
[00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:31.360]   so they don't see that either.
[00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:33.040]   That's my bulkhead hack for you.
[00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:33.880]   Love it.
[00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:35.940]   As far as other travel,
[00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:38.580]   it's not like I carry some big wardrobe or anything,
[00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:43.580]   but I do try to keep it down to a carry-on and a backpack.
[00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:46.840]   If I can, at all costs,
[00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:48.120]   'cause I don't wanna check bags.
[00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:50.980]   I'll tell you the biggest travel hacks for skateboards,
[00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:52.780]   and people will travel with skateboards,
[00:26:52.780 --> 00:26:55.400]   but you can travel with a skateboard
[00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:58.880]   and put it in the overhead anywhere in the US.
[00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:00.580]   If you're making a connection,
[00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:05.580]   say in Frankfurt or London or even Tokyo,
[00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:10.320]   you can't carry your skateboard on the plane
[00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:12.460]   through those airports.
[00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:14.980]   So I've been told a couple of times,
[00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:16.120]   I've actually gotten away with it once,
[00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:18.940]   and I learned the hard way, like going through London,
[00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:21.080]   you're in the terminal, you're connecting,
[00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:22.340]   but you know how you have to go through
[00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:24.400]   another security checkpoint?
[00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:25.240]   You can't bring your skateboard,
[00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:27.740]   so you have to go outside the airport
[00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:29.920]   on a connecting flight and check it in.
[00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:31.920]   - And probably miss your flight, maybe.
[00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:34.120]   - Oh yeah, yeah, no, I've actually thrown a skateboard away
[00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:35.480]   because of that.
[00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:37.120]   In London, they said, "Oh, you gotta check in,
[00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:38.380]   "I don't have time."
[00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:39.720]   They go, "Well, I don't know what to tell you."
[00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:41.700]   And then I put it in the trash can
[00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:43.500]   at the security checkpoint.
[00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:44.340]   Okay, done.
[00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:45.160]   - Do you think it's a safety risk?
[00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:46.000]   Do they think it's a weapon?
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.600]   Or like what is it?
[00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:48.640]   - I assume, yeah.
[00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:49.480]   - You bring a guitar.
[00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:51.000]   - Also Mexico too, surprisingly,
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.240]   you can't carry a skateboard on the airplane in Mexico.
[00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:56.340]   So every time we travel with the kids to Mexico,
[00:27:56.340 --> 00:27:58.800]   we've gotta put 'em all in plastic bags.
[00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:00.640]   So we're a disaster coming back
[00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:02.200]   'cause we're just a bunch of luggage.
[00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:03.280]   That's my advice.
[00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:04.760]   I don't know if it's a hack, it's just my advice.
[00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:07.080]   Like if you're gonna travel through Europe,
[00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:09.400]   don't carry your skateboard onto the plane
[00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:10.760]   that is connecting.
[00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:13.480]   - That could probably apply to other items.
[00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:14.800]   Not that it's the end of the world
[00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:17.480]   to replace things like nail clippers.
[00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:19.440]   There's some country where you can't bring nail clippers
[00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:20.360]   on your plane, 'cause I remember.
[00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:23.280]   Or if it has that like slide out file thing.
[00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:25.760]   And I've definitely gotten dinged on that.
[00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:29.000]   So I would say the hack is to look up
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.800]   what are the security requirements
[00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:32.560]   for the country you're transiting through
[00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:35.520]   or try at all costs to fly direct.
[00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:37.680]   Just to avoid these problems when possible.
[00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:38.520]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:40.600]   I live in San Diego, but I live in North County
[00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:42.040]   and you used to be able to fly
[00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:44.520]   from Carlsbad Airport to LAX.
[00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:47.720]   And so basically you could go anywhere from LAX, right?
[00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:51.160]   So that was always like the best way to do it.
[00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:54.360]   But many times our Carlsbad flight would be canceled
[00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:56.320]   and we'd just have to literally drive to Carlsbad Airport.
[00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:57.880]   Like if a flight's canceled,
[00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:01.040]   just keep going North to LAX with the skateboard thing.
[00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:05.040]   I remember, so my wife and I usually carry our skateboards
[00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:07.400]   when we go places 'cause we like to skate around cities,
[00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:08.640]   you know, just as transportation,
[00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:10.560]   if we're going by ourselves.
[00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:14.000]   And we were coming back from Brazil maybe.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:15.240]   And we were coming through
[00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:18.080]   where you hand them your customs form.
[00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:20.000]   I'll never forget this.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.280]   He grabbed my customs form
[00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:25.200]   and he saw my skateboard in his peripheral.
[00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:28.880]   And immediately was like, "Go that way to secondary."
[00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:29.720]   'Cause he saw my skateboard.
[00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:30.800]   It was so obvious.
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:31.920]   I just saw his wheel turn like,
[00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:33.960]   "Oh, he's a problem, he's a skateboarder."
[00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:36.600]   And he looked up and he saw my face and he recognized it,
[00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:40.400]   but he'd already handed me this red card to go to secondary.
[00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:41.480]   And he goes, "Oh, you know what?
[00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:43.560]   "Just tell them you're in a hurry."
[00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:45.480]   I said, "Oh, is that gonna work for me?
[00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:46.480]   "You're sending me to secondary
[00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:47.480]   "where they're gonna go through all my stuff
[00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:49.400]   "and I'm gonna tell them I'm in a hurry."
[00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:52.040]   That's probably not the best approach.
[00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:53.400]   And then my wife and I got into secondary.
[00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:55.080]   They wouldn't let us go to the bathroom.
[00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:57.280]   We were very much being interrogated.
[00:29:57.280 --> 00:29:58.280]   - Wow.
[00:29:58.280 --> 00:29:59.240]   You've told lots of stories.
[00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:01.620]   I'll encourage anyone here to go check out the internet
[00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:03.660]   for all the stories of you getting recognized
[00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:04.500]   as other people.
[00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:06.760]   Is there a good one you don't share?
[00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:09.520]   - Yeah, it still happens all the time.
[00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:12.640]   It's weird now because obviously, as you would know,
[00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:14.280]   that meme kind of took off.
[00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:16.920]   Not the meme, but just me telling my story.
[00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:19.240]   Like all the stories I tell are absolutely true.
[00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:20.080]   100%.
[00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:22.200]   But it started happening so,
[00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:24.240]   it would happen pretty frequently and I was sharing it.
[00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:25.880]   And at some point people thought I was making it up.
[00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:28.260]   So I kind of stopped sharing these incidents
[00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:31.120]   because people were just like, "Come on, like really?"
[00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:33.280]   But now it's gotten to the point where
[00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:37.280]   it's like this vicious cycle where people now wanna say it,
[00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:40.960]   even though they know who I am all the time.
[00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:45.200]   So I would say that happens probably three times a day.
[00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:47.320]   That interaction, like, "Anyone ever tell you
[00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:48.920]   "you look like Tony Hawk?
[00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:50.360]   "Yep, and you're the first today."
[00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:53.520]   But then it happens genuinely at least once or twice too.
[00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:55.760]   When it happens genuinely, if people were following me
[00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:57.240]   around, they wouldn't believe it.
[00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:58.160]   'Cause you know what I mean?
[00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:00.360]   Like they hear about it and it's just like, "All right,
[00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:02.200]   "like enough with this whole, I don't even know
[00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:06.100]   "what you'd call it, mistaken identity thing."
[00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:07.760]   So yes, it still happens.
[00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:08.720]   It happens as a joke.
[00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:09.720]   It happens for real.
[00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:13.380]   I think my favorite one as of late was that
[00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:15.960]   I was sitting at a gate and this guy was sitting
[00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:18.640]   across from me at the gate and he came over.
[00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:20.920]   He's a man who looked just like Tony Hawk.
[00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:22.600]   Said, "Oh yeah, I know, I've heard that."
[00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:24.000]   He's like, "That's crazy."
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.640]   And then he went and sat back down.
[00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:29.600]   And then a group of people came who did recognize me
[00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:33.360]   for real and wanted autographs and pictures.
[00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:36.800]   And the whole time he's watching me laughing
[00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:41.800]   because he's in on the joke that it's not really me.
[00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:42.620]   Do you know what I mean?
[00:31:42.620 --> 00:31:44.960]   Like he and I are sharing this inside joke somehow
[00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:48.160]   that these people are crazy and they're mistaken.
[00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:50.080]   But he just thought it was hilarious.
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:52.200]   - Did you ever tell him at the end or did he ever?
[00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:53.040]   - No, I don't.
[00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:56.200]   It's up to them to either decide that or to ask me.
[00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:58.920]   It drives my daughter crazy because a lot of times
[00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:00.720]   people will say, "Oh, you look like Tony Hawk."
[00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:02.840]   I'm like, "Yeah, yeah, that's cool."
[00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:03.880]   And they walk away and my daughter's like,
[00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:04.780]   "Why didn't you tell him?"
[00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:05.920]   I go, "He didn't ask."
[00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:09.320]   - So if someone asks, you'll say, "Yeah."
[00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:10.320]   - Of course, yeah.
[00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:11.960]   - All right, well, I hope whoever was sitting across from me
[00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:13.760]   at the airport is listening and they can finally
[00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:14.600]   come to terms with the fact that this guy is really you.
[00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:17.800]   - No, I think he had way more fun in his mind
[00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:19.200]   making fun of people.
[00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:20.040]   - Yeah.
[00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:20.920]   - Like that was his thing.
[00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:22.480]   So I just let him run with it.
[00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:25.920]   - So to round out travel, I'm sure you buy lots of things.
[00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:27.240]   Do you play the points game?
[00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:30.040]   Do you try to rack up points or cash back on credit cards
[00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:32.040]   to travel for free still?
[00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:35.440]   - Yes, I try to focus in on one or two airlines
[00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:37.960]   or their partners so that I rack up the most points
[00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:40.880]   on them, which is for the most part United and Delta.
[00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:45.760]   But also all my credit card purchases go towards miles.
[00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:48.320]   So I use those for my team.
[00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:51.560]   So for instance, we have the skater, Felipe Nunes
[00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:53.560]   from Brazil, you might've seen him.
[00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:56.040]   He's a double amputee.
[00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:57.760]   He skates like kind of sitting on his board.
[00:32:57.760 --> 00:32:58.720]   He's amazing.
[00:32:58.720 --> 00:32:59.840]   - It's crazy.
[00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:02.000]   I'll find a link to it and put it in the show notes.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.560]   - Like truly deserves to be a pro skater.
[00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:07.400]   Like he is incredible and has only gotten better,
[00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:11.280]   but it's tricky 'cause he lives in a really small town,
[00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:14.440]   a couple hours from Sao Paulo, in Curitiba.
[00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:17.760]   So for me to get him flights is always really tricky
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:21.160]   and challenging, but I do it using my points
[00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:24.300]   and I can get him his flights all the time.
[00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:26.480]   He has to travel with kind of a handler
[00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:27.560]   and it's a whole thing.
[00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:29.400]   And I use that for his flights.
[00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:31.160]   I use them for my other skaters flights
[00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:33.480]   if they need to get somewhere for a skate trip or whatever.
[00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:34.600]   And it's been awesome.
[00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:35.880]   - Everyone's always surprised.
[00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:37.440]   Like no matter how successful you are,
[00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:39.800]   no matter how famous or rich or whatever you are,
[00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:41.280]   everyone still wants to make sure
[00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:42.680]   that when they're spending money on their card,
[00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:46.240]   they're getting like the most they can out of their rewards.
[00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:48.280]   - Yeah, and also just with me,
[00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:50.800]   sometimes other groups do my travel.
[00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:52.920]   If I'm going to an event, I do a lot of speaking gigs,
[00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:54.840]   corporate gigs and whatnot and conferences.
[00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:57.720]   And so sometimes it's up to them to do the travel
[00:33:57.720 --> 00:34:00.360]   and they don't plug in my advantage number
[00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:02.680]   or my, you know, my mileage plus number or whatever.
[00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:04.040]   And it's such a hassle.
[00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:07.720]   Like it all seems so frivolous, but it's important
[00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:10.480]   'cause it's like, you can go to a different line.
[00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:11.320]   You know what I mean?
[00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:12.720]   Or a security or whatever it is.
[00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:14.440]   And there's just some efficiency to it.
[00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:16.920]   And when you travel as much as I do,
[00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:18.360]   those things count for a lot.
[00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:20.360]   - I know someone who's part of their rider for speaking
[00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:23.120]   is like, I will book my flights and you will reimburse me
[00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:23.960]   because I just don't want--
[00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:24.960]   - That is usually what we do.
[00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:27.520]   But every once in a while, it slips through the cracks.
[00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:29.320]   - Well, if anyone's listening, if you ever take a flight
[00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:30.960]   and you didn't put your number in,
[00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:33.120]   you can actually retroactively ask for credit.
[00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:34.480]   So if you ever forget,
[00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:35.920]   the airlines do allow you to do that.
[00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:38.240]   - It's better to do it at a ticket counter though.
[00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:39.480]   - Yeah, they can do it faster.
[00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:41.080]   - They can do it immediately.
[00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:43.640]   - That's the other thing is people like,
[00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:46.760]   they wield such great power at the ticket counters.
[00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:48.800]   They could literally just put you on a flight
[00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:51.360]   to London first class without blinking an eye
[00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:52.520]   if they wanted to.
[00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:54.560]   - It always amazes me when something happened
[00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:55.960]   and they're yelling at this person.
[00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:58.840]   And I'm like, you realize the person that holds the keys
[00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:01.440]   to whatever your situation will be,
[00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:02.680]   you're yelling. - Is that person.
[00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:05.680]   Who is not responsible for your delay
[00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:07.560]   or for your seat mix up.
[00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:09.920]   - I think just being nice to the person at the desk
[00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:12.160]   can pay dividends on certain ways.
[00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:13.120]   - Oh, absolutely, yeah.
[00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:14.400]   No, I agree.
[00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:16.800]   - I've never scored this kind of mythical,
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:19.000]   we're just gonna upgrade you for no reason kind of thing.
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.080]   Obviously if you have status, you can get it.
[00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:23.280]   But everything else like, oh, my flight's gone.
[00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:24.680]   They could decide, do I wanna put you
[00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:26.080]   on that easy connection?
[00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:27.920]   Do I wanna just give you a coupon and you can get a hotel
[00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:28.960]   and come back tomorrow?
[00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:30.920]   And playing that game has been very helpful.
[00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:32.240]   And if that line's too long,
[00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:34.840]   I always try to call and see if I can get someone
[00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:36.000]   faster than a long line.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.040]   Like when a flight's canceled
[00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:38.640]   and there's a hundred people lined up.
[00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:39.600]   - Oh yeah, yeah.
[00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:42.480]   So I have all the apps, the flight track
[00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:45.760]   that will sometimes alert me to a problem by flight
[00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:47.320]   before the airline does.
[00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:50.480]   So I'm always kind of ahead of the curve with that
[00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:52.440]   where it's like, oh, this thing's getting canceled.
[00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:55.000]   I'm gonna go figure this out before everyone else
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:56.720]   at the gate knows that's what's happening.
[00:35:56.720 --> 00:35:57.560]   - And you're like telling them,
[00:35:57.560 --> 00:35:58.720]   you're like, the flight's canceled.
[00:35:58.720 --> 00:35:59.960]   She's like, what?
[00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:00.800]   Oh, yes it is canceled.
[00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:02.080]   - Yeah, yeah, yes. - You're telling them.
[00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:05.120]   So one other area that we haven't talked a lot about
[00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:06.800]   is around health and fitness.
[00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:08.840]   And people like Laird Hamilton go nuts
[00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:11.720]   about everything they do with their regime for exercise,
[00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:13.080]   sauna, all this stuff.
[00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:15.640]   Skateboarding, I think some people,
[00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:16.680]   especially when I was a kid,
[00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:18.800]   like didn't even see it as a physical sport.
[00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:20.640]   I can assure you, I'm sure you can assure everyone
[00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:22.240]   that it is. - Yeah.
[00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:26.280]   - How much was kind of diet, exercise, training
[00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:28.600]   outside of skating important?
[00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:30.600]   Or how has that evolved as you've gotten older?
[00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:32.080]   - I think in the early days,
[00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:35.040]   I didn't recognize the importance of my diet
[00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:35.880]   and training and whatnot,
[00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:38.920]   but I was so obsessed with skating
[00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:41.200]   that that was all my exercise.
[00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:43.600]   And that was enough because I was skating
[00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:46.800]   three to four hours a day, every day, giving it my all.
[00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:50.800]   So I think that over time,
[00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:52.280]   and also just seeing my peers,
[00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:54.720]   I saw a lot of them not take care of themselves,
[00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:56.120]   drinking too much, partying,
[00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:58.920]   and really kind of losing their skill sets.
[00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:03.240]   And so skating was always such a paramount importance to me
[00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:06.440]   that I was never going to let that happen.
[00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:08.160]   And I saw it by example, like,
[00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:09.480]   "Oh man, he's not skating good.
[00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:12.080]   Oh, that's 'cause he won't stop partying."
[00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:15.240]   And so for me, that was sort of the first lesson
[00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:19.000]   was not completely, but clean living for the most part.
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:20.520]   But as I grew older,
[00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:22.800]   then I realized the importance of diet
[00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:26.080]   and of trying to stay active when I can't skate.
[00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:29.560]   And now, especially at my age and with my current recovery,
[00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:31.280]   I've learned that I gotta stay active,
[00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:33.160]   even if I can't skate, I gotta.
[00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:36.320]   And I need to do so much stuff to help.
[00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:39.120]   I'm recovering from a broken femur from last year.
[00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:41.560]   I need to do so many things to help that healing.
[00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:43.680]   At one point, it was a full-time job
[00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:46.240]   and I had to kind of back off from it.
[00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:48.320]   'Cause I was like, "Maybe I just need to wait,
[00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:49.160]   just give it time."
[00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:51.200]   Instead of trying to do all these other things,
[00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:53.720]   like hyperbaric chamber and laser treatment
[00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:55.480]   and acupuncture and peptides.
[00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:59.040]   And I was going all the way in with all those treatments.
[00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:00.600]   And at some point,
[00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:03.240]   I actually went the wrong way with my recovery,
[00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:06.080]   but only because I couldn't stop skating.
[00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:09.480]   So my bone never connected to itself.
[00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:12.320]   It never actually became one bone again.
[00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:14.960]   So I had it reset two months ago.
[00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:16.640]   - Are there things that you've experimented with,
[00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:20.000]   whether it's diet or different kinds of treatment
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.640]   that you think you'll keep in a routine that are lasting
[00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:24.480]   or things like breathwork or yoga
[00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:27.200]   or any of those things that are part of your routine?
[00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:30.280]   - I think swimming helped me with my strength a lot
[00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:31.560]   when I wasn't skating.
[00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:34.280]   So I'm gonna lean into that more going forward,
[00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:37.360]   including with my skating and just trying to,
[00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:40.600]   well, it was more like not eating to excess
[00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:43.960]   and not indulging in sweets and sodas and stuff like that.
[00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:47.360]   I still carry a lot of my habits from as a kid,
[00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:51.080]   then I still enjoy, not the healthiest of foods,
[00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:54.960]   but I don't go all in on just fast food
[00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:57.360]   and just more stuff that's gonna slow me down
[00:38:57.360 --> 00:39:01.960]   and try to make a concerted effort to take supplements,
[00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:05.200]   to eat greens, less processed foods, stuff like that.
[00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:06.120]   - What kind of supplements?
[00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:08.640]   - Well, I take quite a few, but most importantly,
[00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:10.680]   I have to take a stat now 'cause I have high cholesterol
[00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:12.760]   because of my family history.
[00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:15.240]   So I take Qnol CoQ10.
[00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:17.000]   It was funny because they reached out to me
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.080]   about possibly doing an endorsement.
[00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:20.200]   Like, do you know what this is?
[00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:22.120]   You know, I take it.
[00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:24.200]   I literally take it every day.
[00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:27.600]   And so I was kind of the perfect one for their campaign.
[00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:28.440]   You know what I mean?
[00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:30.800]   So it's stuff like that, but multivitamins too.
[00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:31.800]   - Okay.
[00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:33.240]   - And a bevy of other ones,
[00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:36.600]   just trying to keep all my levels balanced.
[00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:37.560]   - What about the morning routine?
[00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:39.720]   Are you early up and get after it?
[00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:41.800]   - Yeah, well, we still have one at home.
[00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:43.460]   I gotta make sure my daughter is up
[00:39:43.460 --> 00:39:45.080]   and getting ready by 7 a.m.
[00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:47.120]   So I'm usually up by 6.30.
[00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:50.280]   That's not crazy early, but sometimes it's six.
[00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:53.280]   And that's kind of my time to try to go through
[00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:56.200]   my communications, emails, and whatnot.
[00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:59.640]   Because as the day starts and as she goes to school,
[00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:02.440]   I come here, this is my office, this is where my ramp is.
[00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:04.280]   Things get crazy through the day.
[00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:07.320]   And so it's hard to stay on top of communication.
[00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:12.200]   - This holiday season, I wanna give gifts to my loved ones
[00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:14.160]   that make them feel special and unique,
[00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:16.500]   just like the relationships we share.
[00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:17.760]   If you feel the same way,
[00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:19.480]   you should be giving them story worth,
[00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:21.360]   which is an incredible gift I've given
[00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:22.680]   to the people I care about.
[00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:25.040]   And I'm excited to be partnering with them today.
[00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:26.840]   Story worth is an online service
[00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:28.160]   that helps you and your loved ones
[00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:31.600]   preserve precious memories and stories for years to come.
[00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:33.520]   It's a thoughtful and meaningful gift
[00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:35.840]   that connects you to those who matter most.
[00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:38.600]   Each week, story worth emails your relative or friend
[00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:40.840]   a thought provoking question of your choice
[00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:42.880]   from a vast pool of options.
[00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:44.700]   Each unique prompt asks a question
[00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:45.980]   you've never thought about.
[00:40:45.980 --> 00:40:48.000]   Like what's the bravest thing you've ever done?
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:49.800]   Or if you could see into the future,
[00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:51.860]   what would you want to find out?
[00:40:51.860 --> 00:40:54.040]   After a year, story worth will compile
[00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:55.640]   all your loved ones stories,
[00:40:55.640 --> 00:40:58.720]   including photos into a beautiful keepsake book
[00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:00.480]   that you'll be able to share and revisit
[00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:01.940]   for generations to come.
[00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:03.400]   Which now that we have kids,
[00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:05.980]   I couldn't be more excited to start collecting these books
[00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:07.400]   to share with them.
[00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:09.400]   Reading the weekly stories helps connect you
[00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:12.760]   with loved ones no matter how near or far apart you are.
[00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:15.120]   And you'll be surprised at the things you learn,
[00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:17.680]   like how my dad might have gotten into trouble
[00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:19.400]   for landing a helicopter at Denny's
[00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:21.200]   back when he was in the military.
[00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:23.740]   With story worth, I'm giving those I love most
[00:41:23.740 --> 00:41:25.820]   a thoughtful personal gift from the heart
[00:41:25.820 --> 00:41:27.780]   and preserving their memories and stories
[00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:29.200]   for years to come.

[00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:44.220]   I wish I could say I'm eating
[00:41:44.220 --> 00:41:46.240]   a fully balanced diet every day,
[00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:48.020]   but the reality is that I'm not.
[00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:49.900]   So I love having an easy way
[00:41:49.900 --> 00:41:52.060]   to get my daily nutritional insurance,
[00:41:52.060 --> 00:41:53.740]   which is why I kickstart every day
[00:41:53.740 --> 00:41:55.620]   with AG1 from Athletic Greens,
[00:41:55.620 --> 00:41:57.300]   and I'm excited to be partnering with them
[00:41:57.300 --> 00:41:58.280]   for this episode.
[00:41:58.280 --> 00:42:01.740]   AG1 has been in my routine for the past six months
[00:42:01.740 --> 00:42:03.460]   because I think it's the best option
[00:42:03.460 --> 00:42:06.340]   for easy, optimal nutrition out there.
[00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:08.080]   You take one scoop of AG1,
[00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:10.780]   and you're absorbing 75 high-quality vitamins,
[00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:13.100]   minerals, whole food source superfoods,
[00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:16.060]   probiotics, and adaptogens to help you start your day right.
[00:42:16.060 --> 00:42:18.500]   Every morning, I mix it up with some cold water,
[00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:21.660]   add a few ice cubes because it tastes so good cold,
[00:42:21.660 --> 00:42:23.780]   and head to my office feeling focused
[00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:25.300]   and energized for the day,
[00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:27.820]   which is a feeling I absolutely love.
[00:42:27.820 --> 00:42:30.580]   I also love that it has less than one gram of sugar
[00:42:30.580 --> 00:42:34.620]   and no GMOs, nasty chemicals, or artificial anything.
[00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:36.380]   To make giving it a try easy,
[00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:39.460]   Athletic Greens is gonna give you a free one-year supply
[00:42:39.460 --> 00:42:41.340]   of immune-supporting vitamin D

[00:43:18.380 --> 00:43:21.740]   I heard you say in a podcast almost five years ago
[00:43:21.740 --> 00:43:23.100]   that your kryptonite was time.
[00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:26.220]   I'm curious if in the last few years
[00:43:26.220 --> 00:43:27.380]   you've made any changes,
[00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:30.020]   whether it's to time management or anything,
[00:43:30.020 --> 00:43:31.300]   that made you more productive.
[00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:32.940]   Yeah, I've learned to say no.
[00:43:32.940 --> 00:43:35.220]   It's hard, especially when things are growing
[00:43:35.220 --> 00:43:36.340]   and things are successful
[00:43:36.340 --> 00:43:38.660]   and people are asking for your time
[00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:41.340]   and for you to attend events
[00:43:41.340 --> 00:43:43.740]   or for you to do interviews and things like that.
[00:43:43.740 --> 00:43:45.360]   And at some point I thought,
[00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:48.040]   I don't need to do these things
[00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:53.040]   and I don't think that they are necessarily beneficial.
[00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:54.040]   I don't know.
[00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:56.680]   They just don't seem like they should be so obligatory.
[00:43:56.680 --> 00:43:58.400]   I'm honored that people wanna talk to me
[00:43:58.400 --> 00:43:59.480]   and that people want me to do stuff,
[00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:02.720]   but at some point I needed, for my own sanity
[00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:06.520]   and also for my own family dynamic,
[00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:08.760]   to just be available to them
[00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:10.380]   and not be on the move all the time
[00:44:10.380 --> 00:44:11.920]   or just home on my phone.
[00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:13.300]   I think that's one thing that people
[00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:16.380]   don't necessarily recognize is that
[00:44:16.380 --> 00:44:18.420]   just because you are home,
[00:44:18.420 --> 00:44:20.740]   if your attention is elsewhere, you're not really home.
[00:44:20.740 --> 00:44:23.000]   I think it's something that when you have young kids,
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:24.420]   you start to realize, wow,
[00:44:24.420 --> 00:44:27.280]   the number of times I'm just a little bit distracted
[00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:28.940]   because they run off and you're like,
[00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:30.160]   whoa, I was distracted.
[00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:31.000]   They're no longer in the group.
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:31.820]   Or they're trying to show you something
[00:44:31.820 --> 00:44:33.340]   and you're like, uh-huh, yep, yep, uh-huh, uh-huh.
[00:44:33.340 --> 00:44:34.380]   And you think that that's good enough,
[00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:36.460]   but they see that, that can affect them.
[00:44:36.460 --> 00:44:38.780]   In some ways it might've been much easier
[00:44:38.780 --> 00:44:41.020]   to be a parent before all of the distraction
[00:44:41.020 --> 00:44:42.460]   that we have today.
[00:44:42.460 --> 00:44:43.820]   In other ways, I think it was way harder.
[00:44:43.820 --> 00:44:46.180]   - Yeah, so I was very young.
[00:44:46.180 --> 00:44:48.060]   I was 24 when my first son was born
[00:44:48.060 --> 00:44:51.180]   and that was, there were no DVRs.
[00:44:51.180 --> 00:44:54.640]   We were still using VHS and he would wake up super early
[00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:58.520]   and sometimes before Sesame Street was on the air.
[00:44:58.520 --> 00:44:59.880]   You know what I mean? - Yeah, you're like, what do we do?
[00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:02.780]   - Yeah, what do we, yeah, let's read a book or do something.
[00:45:02.780 --> 00:45:06.600]   You learn to entertain the old fashioned way, storytelling.
[00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:08.100]   - Find us on flights now.
[00:45:08.100 --> 00:45:10.060]   It's like you're on a flight, you're on Southwest.
[00:45:10.060 --> 00:45:11.780]   There's no TVs, there's no, you're sitting there
[00:45:11.780 --> 00:45:14.460]   and you're like, it's amazing how kids are like,
[00:45:14.460 --> 00:45:15.820]   I wanna run around and you're like,
[00:45:15.820 --> 00:45:17.420]   well, you can't run around.
[00:45:17.420 --> 00:45:18.260]   I wanna read a book.
[00:45:18.260 --> 00:45:19.940]   Okay, five minutes in, I don't wanna read a book anymore.
[00:45:19.940 --> 00:45:22.220]   So I think flights in that kind of toddler age
[00:45:22.220 --> 00:45:23.060]   are really tough.
[00:45:23.060 --> 00:45:24.460]   - Tell you a hack for toddlers,
[00:45:24.460 --> 00:45:27.420]   since you do have young ones and this is gonna be weird,
[00:45:27.420 --> 00:45:29.620]   but it worked for me a couple of times.
[00:45:29.620 --> 00:45:33.100]   My son was prone to being car sick sometimes
[00:45:33.100 --> 00:45:34.380]   and on planes too.
[00:45:34.380 --> 00:45:36.500]   Sometimes we would be walking through a terminal
[00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:38.940]   or something and then he would just barf.
[00:45:38.940 --> 00:45:43.060]   And I learned that it's very easy to remove your shoe,
[00:45:43.060 --> 00:45:46.380]   remove one sock, use that as a rag
[00:45:46.380 --> 00:45:47.820]   and just throw the sock away
[00:45:47.820 --> 00:45:49.740]   and deal with just wearing one sock
[00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:51.820]   the rest of your trip or your day
[00:45:51.820 --> 00:45:54.180]   to save from having to try to go
[00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:56.060]   some massive cleanup effort.
[00:45:56.060 --> 00:45:57.140]   - The sock burp cloth.
[00:45:57.140 --> 00:45:58.420]   - Sock burp cloth, yeah.
[00:45:58.420 --> 00:45:59.660]   I've done it a few times.
[00:45:59.660 --> 00:46:03.440]   - The last thing we didn't really talk on was around money.
[00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:05.300]   So early on in your career,
[00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:07.360]   you were making six figures in high school.
[00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:08.580]   I'm trying to comprehend that.
[00:46:08.580 --> 00:46:10.100]   Most people in high school are making
[00:46:10.100 --> 00:46:12.540]   maybe a couple bucks on a side gig.
[00:46:12.540 --> 00:46:14.500]   What was the relationship with money like back then?
[00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:16.500]   - Well, it was all a big surprise
[00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:19.420]   'cause it wasn't like you got into skateboarding
[00:46:19.420 --> 00:46:20.340]   to be rich or famous.
[00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:22.380]   No one had become rich or famous.
[00:46:22.380 --> 00:46:23.820]   No one made money doing it.
[00:46:23.820 --> 00:46:24.900]   You just did it 'cause you loved it.
[00:46:24.900 --> 00:46:26.260]   And all of a sudden there was this fame
[00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:27.460]   and there was this money.
[00:46:27.460 --> 00:46:30.100]   And I was in my late teens.
[00:46:30.100 --> 00:46:34.420]   I'd say I started making pretty good money around 16, 17.
[00:46:34.420 --> 00:46:37.140]   And it was like, oh, this is awesome.
[00:46:37.140 --> 00:46:39.380]   I'm gonna take all my friends to Hawaii.
[00:46:39.380 --> 00:46:41.780]   I'm going to Sharper Image and buying all the gear.
[00:46:41.780 --> 00:46:45.220]   And at some point, my dad gave me the best advice.
[00:46:45.220 --> 00:46:47.340]   He said, I really think you should put some of that money away.
[00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:49.460]   I was like, why?
[00:46:49.460 --> 00:46:52.020]   As if it's just gonna keep raining down on me.
[00:46:52.020 --> 00:46:53.580]   And he said, well, you just don't know
[00:46:53.580 --> 00:46:54.420]   if this is gonna last.
[00:46:54.420 --> 00:46:56.260]   'Cause he really wanted me to go to college.
[00:46:56.260 --> 00:46:57.340]   He was like, if you're gonna do this,
[00:46:57.340 --> 00:47:00.180]   you should really save from what you're making here.
[00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:04.540]   So when I was 17, he co-signed a mortgage.
[00:47:04.540 --> 00:47:05.800]   I had the income to qualify,
[00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:07.660]   but I literally was not old enough
[00:47:07.660 --> 00:47:09.580]   to sign the paperwork by myself.
[00:47:09.580 --> 00:47:11.980]   So he co-signed on a house for me.
[00:47:11.980 --> 00:47:16.740]   So I lived in my own place as a senior in high school,
[00:47:16.740 --> 00:47:17.820]   as if I was in college.
[00:47:17.820 --> 00:47:18.660]   - Parents weren't there.
[00:47:18.660 --> 00:47:19.620]   - No.
[00:47:19.620 --> 00:47:20.460]   And then I had-
[00:47:20.460 --> 00:47:21.280]   - All the high school parties.
[00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:23.700]   - I had one roommate that was also at the same high school.
[00:47:23.700 --> 00:47:26.240]   We had two older roommates that just had jobs,
[00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:29.700]   but were young enough to be taking advantage
[00:47:29.700 --> 00:47:31.380]   of the situation.
[00:47:31.380 --> 00:47:33.340]   You know, when you're in high school,
[00:47:33.340 --> 00:47:34.780]   whoever's friends are out of town,
[00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:35.740]   that's where the party is.
[00:47:35.740 --> 00:47:37.700]   Whoever's friends' parents were out of town,
[00:47:37.700 --> 00:47:39.920]   that's the house where the party is, right?
[00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:41.600]   My parents were never in town.
[00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:43.820]   So my house was always where the party was.
[00:47:43.820 --> 00:47:47.360]   And it was very challenging to stay focused on school
[00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:50.320]   when I'm already making more than my teachers
[00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:52.760]   and everyone's coming over to hang out
[00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:54.080]   and then I'm supposed to get up early
[00:47:54.080 --> 00:47:55.320]   and drive to high school.
[00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:59.520]   But I did, mostly because of how important my parents,
[00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:01.980]   how much they valued education.
[00:48:01.980 --> 00:48:05.120]   My mom was a teacher at a junior college at the time.
[00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:07.480]   And so I knew they'd be really disappointed
[00:48:07.480 --> 00:48:09.600]   if I just left.
[00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:11.400]   - So finishing high school was like a very-
[00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:12.620]   - Well, yeah, it was important, yeah.
[00:48:12.620 --> 00:48:14.680]   - And then did you keep saving
[00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:17.080]   or was the house the kind of saving grace?
[00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:18.440]   - The house was saving grace.
[00:48:18.440 --> 00:48:20.040]   Well, I got in kind of over my head.
[00:48:20.040 --> 00:48:23.440]   So a few years later, I bought another property.
[00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:25.200]   I built a bunch of big ramps on it.
[00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:29.640]   It was a four acre lot here, kind of East San Diego.
[00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:32.240]   And at some point, not long after that,
[00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:34.840]   my income started dropping by half.
[00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:38.520]   By half every month, because it was all royalty-based.
[00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:41.240]   It was all based on items or products with my name on it.
[00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:43.640]   Skating was taking a downturn in popularity.
[00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:45.800]   So suddenly, skating is not popular,
[00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:49.100]   my name's not popular, my products aren't selling,
[00:48:49.100 --> 00:48:52.760]   and I'm stuck with two mortgages, my first child on the way.
[00:48:52.760 --> 00:48:54.980]   And it was like, how did I get here?
[00:48:54.980 --> 00:48:56.040]   This is crazy.
[00:48:56.040 --> 00:49:00.440]   So I sold my house for basically,
[00:49:00.440 --> 00:49:03.240]   I'd taken equity out of it to start a skate company,
[00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:06.240]   which seems like not the smartest move at a time
[00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:07.240]   when your income's dropping,
[00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:08.760]   but I wanted to stay in the industry
[00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:10.560]   and I wanted to, at that point,
[00:49:10.560 --> 00:49:12.320]   have more control over a brand,
[00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:14.820]   because up to then, I had been skating
[00:49:14.820 --> 00:49:17.360]   for the same sponsor for 10 years.
[00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:20.480]   And their popularity was waning, so was skateboarding,
[00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:22.080]   and I thought, well, I could probably just start a brand
[00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:24.460]   and be behind the scenes, because it seems like now,
[00:49:24.460 --> 00:49:29.040]   my career as a skater is starting to fall apart.
[00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:30.600]   I could, at the very least, be effective
[00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:35.600]   as sort of a team manager, curator, marketer.
[00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:38.600]   And so I took the equity out of my house,
[00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:40.280]   started Birdhouse Skateboards,
[00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:42.400]   sold the house for what I owed on it,
[00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:45.120]   then moved back into the house I was living at
[00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:46.040]   as a senior in high school.
[00:49:46.040 --> 00:49:49.920]   And for probably three to four years,
[00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:53.440]   lived off of Top Ramen, peanut butter and jelly sandwiches,
[00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:55.500]   Taco Bell, and just made it work.
[00:49:55.500 --> 00:49:57.680]   And those were the years when I started
[00:49:57.680 --> 00:50:02.160]   to have to travel to make ends meet, like Japan,
[00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:04.640]   and bring my son along, you know what I mean?
[00:50:04.640 --> 00:50:06.560]   That's how that all unraveled.
[00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:08.480]   - There wasn't childcare at home to help out,
[00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:11.760]   because if you're eating Top Ramen, it's tough.
[00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:13.480]   So how did that evolve?
[00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:15.920]   Like, now, are you much more passionate
[00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:18.120]   or interested about money and saving and all of that?
[00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:19.360]   Or where is your relationship?
[00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:23.160]   - I think I have much more respect for saving money
[00:50:23.160 --> 00:50:25.120]   and for making sure everyone's taken care of,
[00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:26.120]   especially with our kids.
[00:50:26.120 --> 00:50:27.920]   I want them to all forge their own way, for sure,
[00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:30.440]   but at the same time, we want to be able to know
[00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:33.280]   that we have a nest egg in case something goes south.
[00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:36.140]   So my relationship is just that I have much more reverence
[00:50:36.140 --> 00:50:37.360]   and respect for it,
[00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:42.360]   and that I also don't take every single opportunity.
[00:50:42.360 --> 00:50:45.280]   That's the reason why I had so many relationships
[00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:48.080]   fall apart, too, 'cause I just kept chasing the carrot,
[00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:52.060]   even when it was huge, even when I didn't need to at all.
[00:50:52.060 --> 00:50:52.900]   I just kept going.
[00:50:52.900 --> 00:50:54.960]   It was like I couldn't turn it off.
[00:50:54.960 --> 00:50:56.840]   And then at some point, I realized,
[00:50:56.840 --> 00:50:59.420]   I'm missing my kids' formative years,
[00:50:59.420 --> 00:51:02.040]   chasing some dream that I've already realized.
[00:51:02.040 --> 00:51:04.400]   - Yeah, I think at a different scale,
[00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:06.200]   it's something that we all face,
[00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:07.680]   is you have kids and you're like,
[00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:09.560]   "I can't go to the thing, I can't go to the thing."
[00:51:09.560 --> 00:51:12.080]   And I think if you pause and reflect for a moment,
[00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:14.200]   you're like, "But it's okay."
[00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:15.800]   But it's so hard to process,
[00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:18.060]   and FOMO is definitely real,
[00:51:18.060 --> 00:51:20.800]   but if there's one thing that your kids can teach you,
[00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:21.880]   even when they're really young,
[00:51:21.880 --> 00:51:24.720]   it's like, you can miss the thing.
[00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:25.560]   It's okay.
[00:51:25.560 --> 00:51:26.380]   - Oh yeah, it's okay.
[00:51:26.380 --> 00:51:29.720]   And also, if you really devote yourself
[00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:31.720]   to that time with your kids,
[00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:34.000]   you just see the gleam in their eye,
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:36.720]   and you see that they appreciate it.
[00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:38.120]   They're not gonna speak it to you.
[00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:40.120]   Good luck getting your kids to say thank you,
[00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:40.960]   by the way, for anything.
[00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:43.600]   But they do appreciate it, and they thrive because of it.
[00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:46.480]   But I think it was just that I had gotten so used
[00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:50.240]   to the hustle of not being successful,
[00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:52.240]   and all the time, trying to create something,
[00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:53.680]   trying to make something happen,
[00:51:53.680 --> 00:51:56.920]   that when it started to happen in droves,
[00:51:56.920 --> 00:51:58.800]   how could I let it go?
[00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:00.040]   That seems crazy.
[00:52:00.040 --> 00:52:00.880]   That's impossible.
[00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:02.400]   Why would I not do that?
[00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:04.500]   And at some point, I lost myself in it.
[00:52:04.500 --> 00:52:06.720]   - Is there something that you wish you'd known,
[00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:09.160]   or you'd wish someone had told you
[00:52:09.160 --> 00:52:11.040]   that could've gotten you out of that earlier?
[00:52:11.040 --> 00:52:11.880]   - I don't think so.
[00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:15.240]   I think it was all so new and fantastical to me
[00:52:15.240 --> 00:52:17.680]   that I don't think I was gonna listen to a voice of reason.
[00:52:17.680 --> 00:52:18.880]   You know what I mean?
[00:52:18.880 --> 00:52:20.920]   - And so now, you've got plenty of things
[00:52:20.920 --> 00:52:21.760]   that could keep you busy.
[00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:22.720]   What's the focus now?
[00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:23.800]   I mean, you're still skating,
[00:52:23.800 --> 00:52:26.080]   or you will probably after you heal.
[00:52:26.080 --> 00:52:30.360]   - Now, I'm just so thankful to still be in the scene,
[00:52:30.360 --> 00:52:32.720]   and to be able to bear witness
[00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:35.880]   to skateboarding's massive acceptance.
[00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:36.780]   I don't wanna say growth.
[00:52:36.780 --> 00:52:38.600]   I mean, it definitely has grown hugely
[00:52:38.600 --> 00:52:40.320]   in the last five or 10 years,
[00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:42.880]   but just to see it come of age,
[00:52:42.880 --> 00:52:45.600]   and to be an activity, a sport,
[00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:47.880]   a lifestyle that is all-inclusive,
[00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:52.000]   that is super diverse, that is now an Olympic sport,
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:56.160]   it's something that transcends boundaries,
[00:52:56.160 --> 00:53:00.120]   cultures, economics, people that get together to skate,
[00:53:00.120 --> 00:53:00.960]   they don't care where you're from,
[00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:02.400]   they just care how you skate,
[00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:03.560]   and it's low-cost of entry.
[00:53:03.560 --> 00:53:06.120]   And so to see it come this far,
[00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:07.880]   and to still be considered relevant,
[00:53:07.880 --> 00:53:08.980]   that's the greatest joy I have.
[00:53:08.980 --> 00:53:10.920]   So what am I doing?
[00:53:10.920 --> 00:53:13.200]   I'm doing whatever I can to still be an advocate
[00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:16.400]   for skating, and to be able to skate myself,
[00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:18.960]   because that still is the most fun for me.
[00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:20.480]   But kind of whatever comes along,
[00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:23.120]   and like I said, I do a lot of speaking gigs now,
[00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:25.920]   which I never imagined would be a way of living,
[00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:26.960]   or a source of income.
[00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:28.920]   I say it all the time, because when I go to these things,
[00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:30.120]   it's just like, look, I never imagined
[00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:31.360]   anyone would pay me to skate.
[00:53:31.360 --> 00:53:33.280]   So I certainly never imagined that people would pay me
[00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:36.060]   to talk about skateboarding, but here we are.
[00:53:36.060 --> 00:53:37.980]   And it's a blast, I love it.
[00:53:37.980 --> 00:53:40.240]   - What's the advice to someone who's passionate
[00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:44.000]   about a thing that's not necessarily a revenue source
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:44.980]   for their life right now?
[00:53:44.980 --> 00:53:47.740]   - It's what's gonna bring you the most joy,
[00:53:47.740 --> 00:53:48.580]   and it's worth it.
[00:53:48.580 --> 00:53:52.400]   If you go to work, and your work makes you happy,
[00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:55.120]   that's living the dream, at any level.
[00:53:55.120 --> 00:53:58.180]   And if it's very successful financially, great.
[00:53:58.180 --> 00:53:59.480]   That's just sort of gravy,
[00:53:59.480 --> 00:54:01.740]   but it's more about your peace of mind.
[00:54:01.740 --> 00:54:02.880]   And I think that if there is something
[00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:04.200]   that makes you truly happy,
[00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:06.320]   and maybe you have to do something else
[00:54:06.320 --> 00:54:07.520]   to supplement your income,
[00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:09.720]   try to balance those things as best you can.
[00:54:09.720 --> 00:54:11.920]   - I've actually turned my position on this
[00:54:11.920 --> 00:54:13.200]   in the past few years.
[00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:14.920]   I used to say, oh, go follow your passion,
[00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:16.560]   find a way to make that your job.
[00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:18.180]   But if you have a job that allows you
[00:54:18.180 --> 00:54:20.880]   to follow your passion, not as a job, that's okay.
[00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:21.800]   - Yeah, that's enough.
[00:54:21.800 --> 00:54:24.280]   - My brother-in-law went pro golfing,
[00:54:24.280 --> 00:54:26.360]   and then hated it because it was his job,
[00:54:26.360 --> 00:54:29.800]   and then got a job, and just golfs on the weekend,
[00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:30.900]   and loves it.
[00:54:30.900 --> 00:54:32.460]   And so I think for some people,
[00:54:32.460 --> 00:54:34.960]   even pursuing it to some extent can actually take away,
[00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:36.280]   I don't know if there was ever a moment in your career
[00:54:36.280 --> 00:54:39.280]   where it was like, skating to win competitions,
[00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:40.780]   and to win trophies was just too much,
[00:54:40.780 --> 00:54:41.620]   and it took away the fun.
[00:54:41.620 --> 00:54:42.560]   - Yeah, for sure.
[00:54:42.560 --> 00:54:45.120]   Especially in the late '80s, I became a machine,
[00:54:45.120 --> 00:54:47.660]   and it was very cyclical, and it was like,
[00:54:47.660 --> 00:54:50.360]   all right, there's an event coming up next weekend,
[00:54:50.360 --> 00:54:52.660]   I've gotta learn a couple new tricks for the event,
[00:54:52.660 --> 00:54:55.800]   because the judges saw my current roster of tricks,
[00:54:55.800 --> 00:54:57.800]   so I gotta hide it from them,
[00:54:57.800 --> 00:55:00.460]   and then unleash it in the finals.
[00:55:00.460 --> 00:55:03.920]   But it became so formulaic that it really was not fun.
[00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:05.600]   And at some point, I just pulled away,
[00:55:05.600 --> 00:55:06.920]   and stepped away from it altogether,
[00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:09.480]   because skating had become a job,
[00:55:09.480 --> 00:55:10.480]   and it wasn't fun for me.
[00:55:10.480 --> 00:55:11.960]   And when I did pull away,
[00:55:11.960 --> 00:55:14.020]   I got very creative with my skating,
[00:55:14.020 --> 00:55:16.840]   and I was able to really learn a lot of different techniques,
[00:55:16.840 --> 00:55:19.080]   and a lot of stuff that I wanted to pursue,
[00:55:19.080 --> 00:55:22.140]   even though I wasn't making a living at it at the time.
[00:55:22.140 --> 00:55:23.040]   I mean, I kinda was,
[00:55:23.040 --> 00:55:25.120]   I still had signature skateboards and whatnot,
[00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:27.080]   but when you're not, in those years,
[00:55:27.080 --> 00:55:29.040]   if you were not competing actively,
[00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:31.000]   you were not going to get coverage,
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:34.740]   you were not going to get career opportunities.
[00:55:34.740 --> 00:55:36.140]   But I was willing to let those go
[00:55:36.140 --> 00:55:38.520]   to just at least be happy with it.
[00:55:38.520 --> 00:55:41.920]   And so, it gave me this sort of new energy
[00:55:41.920 --> 00:55:43.220]   to come back to competing,
[00:55:43.220 --> 00:55:46.840]   and with a different approach that was less careful,
[00:55:46.840 --> 00:55:50.560]   and it was more risky.
[00:55:50.560 --> 00:55:51.400]   That was it.
[00:55:51.400 --> 00:55:52.360]   I came at it with a sense of,
[00:55:52.360 --> 00:55:54.120]   I'm gonna just try everything.
[00:55:54.120 --> 00:55:55.880]   If it doesn't work, it doesn't work.
[00:55:55.880 --> 00:55:59.320]   I don't care if my competitive record
[00:55:59.320 --> 00:56:01.080]   is so pristine anymore.
[00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:02.160]   I'd rather just do this,
[00:56:02.160 --> 00:56:03.880]   and take the chances, and have fun doing it.
[00:56:03.880 --> 00:56:07.080]   And if it works, then it's going to work awesomely.
[00:56:07.080 --> 00:56:09.580]   The downside of that was that,
[00:56:09.580 --> 00:56:11.560]   when I did come back to competing,
[00:56:11.560 --> 00:56:14.540]   it was when skateboarding was starting to take a downturn.
[00:56:14.540 --> 00:56:16.600]   So I came back with this renewed energy,
[00:56:16.600 --> 00:56:18.260]   and I was winning a lot of big events,
[00:56:18.260 --> 00:56:19.440]   and all of a sudden it was like,
[00:56:19.440 --> 00:56:20.520]   what happened?
[00:56:20.520 --> 00:56:21.920]   Where's the crowd?
[00:56:21.920 --> 00:56:23.120]   Where's the contest?
[00:56:23.120 --> 00:56:23.960]   - Where's the prize money?
[00:56:23.960 --> 00:56:26.160]   - You guys, turn the machines back on.
[00:56:26.160 --> 00:56:27.560]   I thought this was cool.
[00:56:27.560 --> 00:56:30.400]   It was kind of like the wrong place at the right time.
[00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:32.280]   - But you probably wouldn't have had the career
[00:56:32.280 --> 00:56:34.960]   you had after that, had that not happened.
[00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:38.200]   - No, no, because in those dead years,
[00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:40.080]   I was skating more than ever.
[00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:41.840]   Having fun doing it.
[00:56:41.840 --> 00:56:43.480]   Learning new tricks, and learning new techniques.
[00:56:43.480 --> 00:56:45.320]   It was just that I wasn't doing it in front of crowds,
[00:56:45.320 --> 00:56:48.600]   'cause the crowds weren't there anymore.
[00:56:48.600 --> 00:56:49.840]   - I think I'm very fortunate,
[00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:51.800]   and I think you did the same with your podcast.
[00:56:51.800 --> 00:56:53.400]   When you start a podcast,
[00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:55.560]   if you can start it not needing to be
[00:56:55.560 --> 00:56:56.760]   your job and your business,
[00:56:56.760 --> 00:56:58.060]   you can do whatever you want with it.
[00:56:58.060 --> 00:56:58.900]   When I started it,
[00:56:58.900 --> 00:57:00.960]   I never thought I'd be going over countries as episodes.
[00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:02.660]   And then I was like, I'm going to London.
[00:57:02.660 --> 00:57:04.400]   I want to talk to someone who knows everything about London.
[00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:05.400]   Let's make an episode about London.
[00:57:05.400 --> 00:57:06.640]   And then we do it on Japan.
[00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:10.240]   So I think when you really start to do
[00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:13.040]   what you're passionate about in your work,
[00:57:13.040 --> 00:57:14.760]   it sometimes creates an even better experience.
[00:57:14.760 --> 00:57:15.920]   And people love these episodes,
[00:57:15.920 --> 00:57:16.960]   and I never had an idea.
[00:57:16.960 --> 00:57:18.880]   - Oh yeah, my co-host Jason Ellis and I,
[00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:20.660]   we have a lot of experience, obviously skating,
[00:57:20.660 --> 00:57:21.960]   but just life experience.
[00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:24.320]   He had a totally different path than I did.
[00:57:24.320 --> 00:57:27.760]   And when we have guests, especially with non-skating guests,
[00:57:27.760 --> 00:57:30.440]   we relate to them in different ways
[00:57:30.440 --> 00:57:33.520]   that people would not expect, but in a very parallel way.
[00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:35.520]   For instance, we had two wrestlers on.
[00:57:35.520 --> 00:57:36.760]   That's our most recent guest,
[00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:39.480]   and Darby Allen and Jamie Hayter.
[00:57:39.480 --> 00:57:41.160]   And people were like, why would you have them on?
[00:57:41.160 --> 00:57:42.980]   And then when we started to talk about our experiences
[00:57:42.980 --> 00:57:45.640]   and our injuries, we were right in line
[00:57:45.640 --> 00:57:46.960]   and we were bouncing off of each other.
[00:57:46.960 --> 00:57:48.720]   And it was a really great conversation.
[00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:49.560]   It was fascinating.
[00:57:49.560 --> 00:57:51.400]   Say what you will about wrestling
[00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:53.240]   or that it's made up or whatever.
[00:57:53.240 --> 00:57:58.240]   Those guys take as much abuse as skateboarders.
[00:57:58.240 --> 00:57:59.480]   - I listened to this episode.
[00:57:59.480 --> 00:58:00.320]   It was wild.
[00:58:00.320 --> 00:58:01.240]   I don't think I've gotten that
[00:58:01.240 --> 00:58:02.960]   behind the scenes look at wrestling.
[00:58:02.960 --> 00:58:04.000]   It hasn't been a passion of mine,
[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:05.720]   but it was super fascinating.
[00:58:05.720 --> 00:58:07.120]   And you don't have to say who,
[00:58:07.120 --> 00:58:09.000]   but I know there's some cool guests coming down the pike.
[00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:11.280]   So if anyone's listening and wants to check it out.
[00:58:11.280 --> 00:58:13.960]   - We have an insane roster coming up
[00:58:13.960 --> 00:58:16.020]   and I feel like now we're starting to hit our stride
[00:58:16.020 --> 00:58:17.140]   and we've been doing it a couple of years.
[00:58:17.140 --> 00:58:18.520]   So you're right.
[00:58:18.520 --> 00:58:20.200]   It wasn't something that we needed,
[00:58:20.200 --> 00:58:21.360]   but we enjoy doing it.
[00:58:21.360 --> 00:58:24.600]   And we did find that we had something unique to offer.
[00:58:24.600 --> 00:58:25.720]   We found a groove.
[00:58:25.720 --> 00:58:26.880]   We found an audience.
[00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:29.760]   It was just that we weren't doing all the right things
[00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:31.560]   with the algorithms and the promotions.
[00:58:31.560 --> 00:58:34.320]   And so now we have a group, Amalka,
[00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:35.960]   that is taking the reins on that
[00:58:35.960 --> 00:58:37.040]   and they've been doing a great job.
[00:58:37.040 --> 00:58:40.160]   So we get to focus more on the content.
[00:58:40.160 --> 00:58:41.000]   - Podcast is great.
[00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:44.080]   I enjoy it, especially 'cause I have my childhood skate dreams
[00:58:44.080 --> 00:58:45.640]   still somewhere buried in my head.
[00:58:45.640 --> 00:58:46.760]   For anyone else listening,
[00:58:46.760 --> 00:58:47.760]   where else do you want to send them
[00:58:47.760 --> 00:58:49.740]   to keep on top of whatever you're doing?
[00:58:49.740 --> 00:58:51.600]   - Well, I'm out there on all the social media
[00:58:51.600 --> 00:58:54.200]   as Tony Hawk, luckily.
[00:58:54.200 --> 00:58:57.000]   I think I had to buy one of someone squatted my name
[00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:59.280]   on some platform early on.
[00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:00.800]   So I'm Tony Hawk and all the social media.
[00:59:00.800 --> 00:59:03.440]   And that's where I put all of my content out there.
[00:59:03.440 --> 00:59:05.280]   We have the Hawk versus Wolf podcast.
[00:59:05.280 --> 00:59:06.240]   I think if anything,
[00:59:06.240 --> 00:59:10.340]   my energy also is directed towards the skate park project,
[00:59:10.340 --> 00:59:12.440]   which is my foundation for public skate parks
[00:59:12.440 --> 00:59:13.720]   in underserved areas.
[00:59:13.720 --> 00:59:16.640]   We have been doing it over 20 years now.
[00:59:16.640 --> 00:59:19.760]   We've helped to fund over a thousand skate parks
[00:59:19.760 --> 00:59:20.720]   in the US alone.
[00:59:20.720 --> 00:59:23.000]   We have a couple of international projects as well.
[00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:24.040]   I think that's my proudest work
[00:59:24.040 --> 00:59:27.000]   because when I was growing up skating,
[00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:28.440]   the skate park was my salvation.
[00:59:28.440 --> 00:59:29.560]   I was an outcast kid.
[00:59:29.560 --> 00:59:31.040]   I was bullied at school,
[00:59:31.040 --> 00:59:33.920]   but I found my tribe and my community at the skate park.
[00:59:33.920 --> 00:59:36.520]   And I was very lucky that the park
[00:59:36.520 --> 00:59:38.840]   that I grew up skating at was one of the last ones
[00:59:38.840 --> 00:59:41.360]   in the US in the mid eighties.
[00:59:41.360 --> 00:59:43.080]   There were only a handful.
[00:59:43.080 --> 00:59:45.400]   And that was never lost on me how lucky I was
[00:59:45.400 --> 00:59:48.600]   to have that place to go and to have that crew.
[00:59:48.600 --> 00:59:51.960]   So when I was in a position to advocate
[00:59:51.960 --> 00:59:54.160]   and to possibly affect change,
[00:59:54.160 --> 00:59:57.000]   that's what I focused in on was public skate parks.
[00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:59.960]   - I grew up kind of at the born in the early eighties.
[00:59:59.960 --> 01:00:02.640]   I was in that kind of dearth of lack of skate parks.
[01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:03.480]   - Lack of skate parks, yeah.
[01:00:03.480 --> 01:00:05.040]   - And I think my community was like the guy
[01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:06.680]   that lived across the street that had a skateboard.
[01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:07.520]   That was it.
[01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:08.360]   It was the two of us.
[01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:11.600]   - And also that these kids that they find something
[01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:13.600]   they love, they maybe live in an area
[01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:15.100]   where there's not much opportunity.
[01:00:15.100 --> 01:00:17.260]   They find something they love and they're mostly told
[01:00:17.260 --> 01:00:20.320]   that they can't do it 'cause they're trespassing
[01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:21.640]   or they're a nuisance.
[01:00:21.640 --> 01:00:23.320]   - They put things to prevent you from doing it.
[01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:24.280]   - Right, or they're a nuisance.
[01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:27.240]   This kid has finally found something that speaks to them.
[01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:29.320]   And now you're discouraging them from that.
[01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:31.200]   What are you doing to your community?
[01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:36.200]   So to have those parks, the kids feel like they matter
[01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:38.760]   and that they can find their crew.
[01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:40.280]   I think the best part about the foundations,
[01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:43.600]   we try to empower groups that are already doing it themselves
[01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:44.960]   or trying to do it themselves.
[01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:46.280]   Like they're trying to fundraise
[01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:47.640]   or they're going to city council meetings
[01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:49.200]   or they're petitioning.
[01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:51.800]   All those things matter.
[01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:54.760]   And it feels like you're in an uphill battle
[01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:59.240]   that will never end, especially with the red tape
[01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:01.760]   and the bureaucracy and city councils.
[01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:04.960]   But we give them the roadmap to do it the right way.
[01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:08.200]   And when we do give them our endorsement
[01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:11.280]   and possibly funding, that's usually the tipping point
[01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:13.240]   for them to get it approved officially.
[01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:16.680]   And so for us, it's empowering those go-getters
[01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:19.000]   that were trying to do it in the first place.
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:19.840]   - I love it.
[01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:21.720]   So you should all definitely check out the podcast
[01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:22.560]   and the socials,
[01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:24.560]   but definitely check out the Skatepark Project.
[01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:28.240]   I wish that it was around 30 something years ago for me.
[01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:29.560]   It would have been awesome.
[01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:33.080]   Any parting advice for anyone who's looks at you and says,
[01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:34.200]   gosh, when I'm in my fifties,
[01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:36.200]   I want to be doing the thing I love
[01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:37.960]   and performing at that level.
[01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:39.280]   - Wow, what can I say?
[01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:43.080]   My approach always has been to keep improving what I do.
[01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:46.000]   And at my age, that's shifted a bit
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:49.360]   from trying to do these big spins and these big stunts
[01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:51.760]   to more subtle techniques,
[01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:53.760]   but something that I feel like is progressive.
[01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:56.160]   And I'm talking about just in terms of physical skating,
[01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:58.120]   but also just my approach to life is like
[01:01:58.120 --> 01:01:59.520]   to not rest on my accolades,
[01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:03.480]   to keep trying to improve what I do, keep evolving,
[01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:06.880]   listen to other input and glean what you can from them,
[01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:09.360]   glean what is appropriate to what you do.
[01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:11.000]   I'm fascinated listening to people
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:12.880]   who are passionate about what they do,
[01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:14.560]   whether they're successful or not,
[01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:17.760]   just to hear what drives them.
[01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:21.320]   And a lot of times you can translate that to what you do.
[01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:23.600]   - Is there a favorite way you consume these stories,
[01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:25.240]   podcasts you like, books you like?
[01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:27.200]   - For these days, it's actually doing my own podcast
[01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:29.200]   'cause I like to invite people that I think are fascinating
[01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:30.560]   and really get into their story.
[01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:33.360]   Like we interviewed this girl who's a,
[01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:35.200]   she's the most decorated Paralympian now.
[01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:36.600]   Her name's Oksana Masters,
[01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:40.480]   who grew up in a Ukrainian orphanage after Chernobyl
[01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:42.480]   and who was disfigured from Chernobyl,
[01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:44.600]   who came to the US, she got adopted.
[01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:47.720]   And her story is incredible.
[01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:48.640]   And so inspiring.
[01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:50.080]   I already knew a little bit of it,
[01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:51.400]   but to invite her on our podcast
[01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:53.320]   and hear all of it was fascinating.
[01:02:53.320 --> 01:02:54.480]   - I have not listened to that.
[01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:56.480]   So that's my homework for the flight home today.
[01:02:56.480 --> 01:02:59.160]   Thank you so much for being here or for having me here.
[01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:00.160]   - Oh yeah, thanks.
[01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:01.320]   This is my home away from home.
[01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:02.160]   - I love it.
[01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:05.480]   Wow, that episode was so much fun
[01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:07.640]   and I really hope you guys enjoyed it.
[01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:10.000]   Big thanks to Tony for hosting me in his space
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:11.880]   and to all of you for listening.
[01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:14.080]   I'll be doing another Q&A episode soon.
[01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:15.920]   So please send over your questions,
[01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:18.800]   but also any awesome wins you have to share
[01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:22.120]   or hacks you've learned and put to use in your own life.
[01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:24.760]   And finally, I am about 100 ratings shy
[01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:26.440]   of hitting my goal from last year
[01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:29.760]   of getting to a thousand reviews on Apple Podcasts.
[01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:31.560]   So if you haven't left one yet,
[01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:33.280]   I would greatly appreciate it.
[01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:34.960]   It would mean so much to me.
[01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:36.680]   All right, that's it for this week.
[01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:37.600]   See you next week.
[01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:40.400]   (upbeat music)
[01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:42.980]   (upbeat music)
[01:03:42.980 --> 01:03:44.700]   (radio static)
