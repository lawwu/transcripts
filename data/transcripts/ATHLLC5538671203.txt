[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.640]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.560]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:09.720]   I'm your host, Chris Hutchins,
[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.300]   and if you've been watching this podcast recently on YouTube,
[00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.880]   you'll have noticed two things.
[00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.980]   First, I have a new studio setup.
[00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.360]   I signed up for Kevin Chen's Dream Studio course,
[00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:19.600]   which I'll link to in the show notes,
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.860]   because it's fantastic and got so many great tips
[00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.240]   that ultimately led to what you see today.
[00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.400]   It's not quite done, but it's almost there.
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.600]   And I even have a setup for in-person interviews,
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.140]   which you'll see the first version of in a few weeks.
[00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:33.980]   But more importantly is number two,
[00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.560]   you'll see that I have a few skateboards
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.200]   hanging on the wall behind me.
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.680]   That's not just 'cause they look cool.
[00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.920]   I have loved skateboarding since I was a kid,
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.000]   and I still skate a bit today.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.480]   Well, what you probably can't see
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:45.800]   is that one of those skateboards
[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.880]   is signed by none other than Tony Hawk,
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.240]   who I've looked up to for so many years,
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.480]   which is why it is surreal
[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.040]   that I'm sitting down with Tony for today's episode.
[00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.580]   He is one of the most decorated athletes in the world,
[00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.520]   having turned pro at 14, and by 16 he was considered
[00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.960]   the best competitive skateboarder on earth.
[00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.280]   He was world champion for 12 years in a row,
[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.040]   launched a video game franchise with 30 million games sold.
[00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.040]   He also runs a skate brand, an awesome nonprofit,
[00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.800]   a clothing brand, and has made hundreds of appearances
[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.480]   in movies, magazines, and TV shows.
[00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.100]   We're gonna talk about his career,
[00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.020]   how he's pushed himself to achieve things
[00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.840]   that so many people thought were impossible,
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.320]   what lessons we can take away
[00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.680]   from all of that time skateboarding,
[00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.780]   what he's learned being a parent to four kids,
[00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.720]   and some of his favorite travel hacks.
[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.040]   We also shot this in person at Tony's studio
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.080]   with an awesome three-camera setup,
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.120]   so if you wanna check out the video from this episode,
[00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.640]   I'll put a link to the YouTube channel in the show notes.
[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.620]   All right, let's jump in right after this.
[00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.880]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.080]   Tony, welcome to the show.
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.120]   Thank you.
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.540]   Yeah, so before we jump in,
[00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.880]   what is one thing you think most people just don't get
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.800]   about skateboarding or skateboard culture?
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.220]   The amount of discipline it takes.
[00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.780]   I think that there's still a stigma that skaters,
[00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.560]   especially people who make their living from skateboarding
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.280]   or from riding their skateboards are slackers, are stoners,
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.320]   they just get up late, they do what they want,
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.520]   they go trespassing, they go skate,
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.080]   and to get to a certain level of skating,
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.840]   to get to some of the more difficult maneuvers,
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.160]   it takes years of discipline and perseverance,
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.680]   pain, and I think that's lost in the noise
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.200]   of these guys are, they're rebels,
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.040]   they got crazy hairdos, they go against the grain.
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.160]   It's like those things are also true in a lot of ways,
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.320]   but they do that out of,
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.040]   it's more out of function of where they came from
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.040]   because especially in the early '90s, mid '90s,
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.040]   there were no places to skate,
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.520]   and you had to break into places,
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.880]   you had to hop fences and go to schoolyards
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.120]   or go to plazas to find any type of terrain,
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.440]   and then skaters got labeled as outcasts
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.980]   and outlaws through that.
[00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.200]   - Yeah, I remember flipping over
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.560]   Shays' lounges at the pool and trying to grind
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.840]   the rails on, there was nothing to do back then.
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.280]   I know you have a lot of discipline, right?
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.880]   You talk about how important it was.
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.160]   Going back to the early days,
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.260]   was there anything about your upbringing
[00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.160]   that kind of drove that competition
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.640]   and determination?
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.440]   - I was just always very determined.
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.560]   That was my mom's best explanation for it
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.520]   because people would say I was a terror
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.260]   and I was a nightmare and I was relentless,
[00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.400]   and she's like, "He's just very determined."
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.960]   That was her nice way of summarizing my behavior,
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.880]   but I think that I wanted to figure things out
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.440]   and I was gonna do it at all costs.
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.960]   I wanted to, I mean, I played baseball and basketball,
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.280]   but I didn't thrive, and only because of my size.
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.320]   I was committed to it, and I was doing the work,
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.620]   and I was trying to get in the mix,
[00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.160]   but I just, I didn't have the strength
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.880]   or the height to really make a difference
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.680]   'cause I was really small for my age.
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.240]   And then when I found skating,
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.760]   I still had the same disadvantage,
[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.200]   but there was something about it
[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.360]   that was much more creative that I enjoyed.
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.640]   It wasn't a team sport.
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.460]   I didn't have to listen to a coach or rely on the team,
[00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:12.860]   and there was something about that that spoke to me,
[00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.980]   but also just the whole culture
[00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.540]   and how people's attitudes was very do-it-yourself,
[00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.040]   and they were proactive, and I loved it.
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.460]   - I know you said it's not a team sport,
[00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.220]   but there were a lot of other people involved.
[00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.500]   There were a lot of other skaters growing up.
[00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.460]   - It wasn't that it was so individualistic
[00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:31.940]   that it was like, "I'm just on my own mission."
[00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:33.580]   I love the community of it.
[00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.440]   I love that you could go to the skate park
[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.660]   and be trying to learn something,
[00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.500]   and suddenly people rally around you
[00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.860]   because they just wanna see you succeed,
[00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.280]   and then you have the support,
[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.340]   and in that sense, you have a team,
[00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.680]   but you're not relying on each other
[00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.700]   for the, I don't know, coordination or anything like that.
[00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:54.380]   It was very much like, "You can do it.
[00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:55.600]   "You got it, all right,"
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.100]   and then someone else is trying something else,
[00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.460]   and then you get behind that,
[00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.300]   and I think that spoke to me a lot, too,
[00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.820]   because I was really small for my age.
[00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.620]   I didn't feel like I fit in anywhere.
[00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.580]   I was bullied a lot, mostly because of my size,
[00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.180]   but also just 'cause I was not the cool kid,
[00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.240]   and then when I found skateboarding,
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.120]   there were a bunch of people like me
[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.200]   all trying to find their way,
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.920]   and they all connected through skateboarding.
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.000]   - I look back to my childhood,
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.320]   and I remember those days.
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.360]   I was not the cool kid.
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.120]   I was the computer nerd and skateboard nerd,
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.240]   and you found our tribe, if you will.
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.520]   I didn't have, I think, the determination you did.
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.080]   I remember all I wanted was to skate
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.320]   at an amazing level, and it just never clicked for me.
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.920]   I found determination in other places later in life,
[00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:42.120]   but it was so hard.
[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.560]   You, I've seen, documented, fortunately,
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.860]   a lot of your experiences in life are documented.
[00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:50.280]   Against all odds, against all pain,
[00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.000]   I remember watching the X Games in '99,
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.080]   where you're trying to do your 900 12 times in a row,
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.440]   falling, even this year, trying to kickflip
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:02.040]   for five, 10 minutes after surgery.
[00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:06.040]   What do you think allows you to go and just keep going?
[00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.840]   Because I remember sitting in the garage
[00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.240]   trying to kickflip for hours,
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.880]   and then I just gave up at some point,
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:13.480]   and I just couldn't keep going.
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:17.320]   - I think, firstly, that I have convinced myself
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.400]   that whatever it is I'm trying is possible,
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.080]   and so I just have to figure out the right approach
[00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:27.280]   to make it so, and that comes in a lot of forms.
[00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.260]   But I do feel like, especially if I go to try a new trick,
[00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.120]   it's like I have every element of this trick.
[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.200]   I know how to spin.
[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:35.920]   I know how to flip my board.
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.120]   I have landed in similar fashions.
[00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.400]   So it's like, how do I combine all those elements
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.080]   to make this one thing work?
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.320]   And I think I rely on that so much
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:47.280]   that I'm willing to push through pain
[00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.720]   and exhaustion to get there.
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:50.800]   It doesn't always work.
[00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:54.340]   Like when you talk about, saw the 900 was 12 tries.
[00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:57.700]   Those 12 tries are representative of thousands of tries.
[00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:00.680]   I tried that trick for 10 years.
[00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:02.960]   So 12 tries was nothing.
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:03.800]   (laughing)
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:04.620]   You know what I mean?
[00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:05.840]   - They were just the 12 I got to witness.
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:06.680]   - You know what I'm saying?
[00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:09.280]   But I understand that if people saw that from the outside,
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:10.480]   they're like, oh, he won't give up.
[00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:12.160]   And I was like, yeah, you have no idea
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.800]   how deep that not give up goes,
[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:16.700]   especially for that particular move.
[00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:20.280]   I would try dozens of tries in one session
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:22.720]   only to walk away with a broken rib.
[00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:23.560]   So--
[00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:24.800]   - Heal up and come back and do it again.
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.280]   - Heal up and come back and try again.
[00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:28.640]   Actually, after the broken rib, that put me on pause.
[00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:30.880]   That one, I had actually stepped away from that trick
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.720]   after getting hurt like that.
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:36.320]   And at some point thought, I've given it everything I have,
[00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:38.960]   I've fully committed to it, and that's what happens.
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:41.380]   So maybe it's not in the cards.
[00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:45.000]   - At the time, did you think I'm quitting on this endeavor?
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:45.840]   - I did, yeah.
[00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:47.080]   Actually, after I broke my rib, I was like,
[00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:49.640]   I had every element, I had every piece of it.
[00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:50.960]   I had the landing, I had everything.
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:54.040]   And so if it didn't work, it's never gonna work.
[00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:58.360]   But in that one instance at the X Games,
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:07:59.760]   the reason I even tried it was
[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:01.720]   because it was the best trick event.
[00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:04.240]   I had a trick in mind for what I wanted to do
[00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:05.760]   that I had made once before.
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:07.080]   And so I thought, I'm just gonna try it.
[00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:08.440]   That's my best trick.
[00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:09.880]   I'm gonna try to get to that trick.
[00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:11.820]   And I got to it very early.
[00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:13.820]   So I didn't really have anything else planned.
[00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:16.920]   And so the announcer, actually, at the time,
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:18.760]   the announcer that was on site said,
[00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:20.640]   oh, let's see one of those 900 attempts.
[00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:21.880]   That's what started it.
[00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:24.160]   - Was that part of your being,
[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:25.320]   was being encouraged by others,
[00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:26.560]   or was it internal motivation?
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:28.720]   - No, I mean, I probably would have tried it anyway
[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:31.920]   'cause it's like, yeah, that would be my next trick
[00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:33.760]   that I'd like to accomplish,
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:36.000]   would be the next best trick for sure.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.320]   And so I tried it more to appease the crowd.
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:42.120]   This is what it looks like.
[00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:45.400]   And then somewhere around the third or fourth try,
[00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:47.800]   my speed was consistent, my spin was consistent.
[00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:49.600]   I started spotting the landing.
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:51.360]   And in previous attempts,
[00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:54.960]   I only ever spotted the landing maybe one out of five tries
[00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:57.520]   because the ramps were all pretty terrible back then.
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:59.400]   You couldn't rely on the speed
[00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:01.400]   or the walls weren't the same.
[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:04.000]   So you're always kind of struggling to adjust.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.880]   And that ramp was built really well.
[00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:10.320]   So I didn't have to struggle with the construction.
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:12.400]   It was more like I could rely on the speed
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:13.640]   and the trueness of it.
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:16.680]   So after about my third or fourth try, I can see it.
[00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:17.640]   I see it every time.
[00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:20.380]   I might as well try to make it again.
[00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:22.080]   And when I did try to make it,
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:24.680]   the first time when I tried to put it on the wall,
[00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:27.880]   I fell forward, but I didn't fall forward so hard
[00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:29.880]   that I got hurt again.
[00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:31.360]   And that was the key.
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:34.000]   Because it was like, oh, I can adjust the landing
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.120]   and I can try to get more in my back foot.
[00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:39.980]   And then I basically shifted my weight mid-spin
[00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:42.680]   so that when I landed, I was more on the back foot
[00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:44.600]   and I was too far on the back foot.
[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:47.480]   And then I shot backwards.
[00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:48.320]   - Now you just have to readjust.
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:49.360]   - We call that shooting out.
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:52.520]   So the first one, I was too top heavy, I fell forward.
[00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:54.400]   The second one, the ones I tried to make.
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:56.560]   And then that next one, I shot out.
[00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:59.080]   And it was like, that was the magic moment
[00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:01.280]   because it was like, we'll split the difference.
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:02.120]   And that's it.
[00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:03.720]   And then that's when it worked.
[00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:05.040]   - Let's say someone listening is hearing this story,
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:07.400]   they're like, this guy's not afraid of anything.
[00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:09.080]   Are there other sports, other things in life
[00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:10.320]   that you have fear from?
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:11.160]   - Oh, for sure.
[00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:13.400]   I surf and I don't like big surf.
[00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:15.120]   People say, well, you ride these giant ramps.
[00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:17.440]   Yeah, but if I fall, the giant ramp doesn't crash
[00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:20.080]   on top of me and hold me underwater.
[00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:21.380]   You know what I mean?
[00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:23.080]   My brother, he is a surfer
[00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:25.440]   and that's how I got into skateboarding, my older brother.
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:26.880]   But when I would go surf with him
[00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:28.800]   and he has plenty of experience,
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:30.160]   he'd go out to pretty heavy stuff.
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:32.280]   And it's just like, I like riding a big wave,
[00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:35.760]   but I don't wanna suffer the consequences of falling on one.
[00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:39.080]   - My first experience surfing was a friend of mine took me
[00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:41.080]   and he was like, let's just try these on a short board.
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:42.520]   I had no idea what I was doing.
[00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:43.720]   - Yeah, a great first experience on a short board.
[00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:45.520]   - It was a horrible first experience.
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:47.820]   And then the next one was like Hawaii, long board,
[00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:48.660]   super chill.
[00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:49.840]   I was like, oh, I could get back into this.
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:50.680]   - Oh yeah.
[00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:52.000]   Well, I'll tell you, I have surfed through my years
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.320]   because my brother wouldn't allow me to exist
[00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:57.400]   without at least a foot or a toe in the water, so to speak.
[00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:00.320]   But I have fallen in love with the wave machines,
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:04.240]   the wave pools, because they are consistent.
[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:06.960]   They're not too scary.
[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:10.040]   And they are like skate parks.
[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:13.320]   Because when you go surfing out in the wild,
[00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:14.680]   you never really know what you're gonna get.
[00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:16.520]   You get waves and sometimes they're good.
[00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:17.480]   Sometimes they're not good.
[00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:19.960]   You've got to figure out kind of how to navigate nature
[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:21.740]   and where the swell is gonna hit.
[00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:24.240]   Those things are, the waves are always good.
[00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:25.680]   They're always gonna barrel.
[00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:29.460]   And so in that sense, you have what I consider a skate park
[00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:32.400]   to try to learn tricks and try to learn techniques.
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:34.320]   So yeah, I get it.
[00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:35.240]   It's not the purest thing.
[00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:38.160]   It's not, you're not out in nature.
[00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:40.600]   But for me, it's just a controlled environment
[00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:43.040]   and it very much feels like skateboarding.
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:44.720]   - I've been waiting for a time
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:46.360]   where I'm near one of these wave parks
[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:48.880]   because I don't think there's one near San Francisco,
[00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:49.800]   at least close enough.
[00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:51.460]   - L'Amour, Fresno.
[00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:52.300]   - Okay.
[00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:55.200]   Not go out for a few hours and then come back.
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:56.040]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:58.860]   - So you've got this crazy determination with skateboarding.
[00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:02.080]   Did you ever figure out or do you know the secret
[00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:04.280]   to applying that to something else?
[00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:06.320]   I think for my personal life,
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:07.360]   there are things where I'm like,
[00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:09.720]   I'm wildly obsessed with optimizing travel.
[00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:11.760]   But that doesn't mean that I can take that same thing
[00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:14.240]   and apply it necessarily to go learn a kickflip.
[00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:15.920]   Though you've somewhat inspired me to do that
[00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:17.000]   as soon as I get home today.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.960]   - I think I learned the value of patience and perseverance
[00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:24.960]   and that I've transcended to being a parent,
[00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:28.100]   to being a business owner, to travel,
[00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:29.420]   to pretty much everything.
[00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:31.740]   I learned all that through skating.
[00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:33.980]   - And is there a way that you applied that?
[00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:36.260]   It's not always natural for someone who's,
[00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.460]   I could do this as hard, I could try everything
[00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:40.180]   and they get to work and they're like, oh, it's hard.
[00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:42.180]   Like, how do you rewire your brain to say,
[00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:43.780]   oh, well, I know how to do this with skateboarding.
[00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:47.020]   - Yeah, and also trying to reach back to remembering,
[00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:49.340]   well, how was I able to figure this out?
[00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:52.940]   I think that with parenting, especially,
[00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:54.740]   it's so easy to get frustrated and give up.
[00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:55.580]   It really is.
[00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:56.900]   I get it, it's hard, man.
[00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:58.740]   Especially when your kids are relentless
[00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:01.720]   and they're difficult and you want to just yell
[00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:03.580]   and can't, that's not effective.
[00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:04.900]   And so you've got to figure out
[00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:08.700]   how to sort of change your approach
[00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:12.220]   and to see what is effective and that is really hard.
[00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:15.100]   But I learned that through skating
[00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:16.260]   and I've had plenty of kids,
[00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.860]   so I've had time to figure it out even more so.
[00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:23.140]   And I learned the value of persistence and determination
[00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:25.220]   and you do see the results eventually,
[00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:27.940]   but it's not some wow moment always.
[00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:30.540]   Take your small wins along the way.
[00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:32.260]   - I'm early on the parenting journey
[00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:33.820]   with one at two and six months,
[00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:36.980]   but I've seen some small wins and it's like, whew.
[00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:40.020]   - Yeah, and those exponentially get better.
[00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:42.260]   And you can see that, oh, well, I planted the seed.
[00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.860]   I'll tell you what I did with all my kids early on,
[00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:47.900]   and it was hard 'cause I was very much,
[00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:49.740]   in the early days, kind of a single parent.
[00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:52.780]   I just travel with them and it wasn't a question of like,
[00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:55.220]   oh, I got to go, I'm going to have to find carers.
[00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:56.140]   We're going.
[00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:57.420]   In the beginning, that was super hard,
[00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:00.020]   especially when they're toddlers and they don't have patience.
[00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:01.940]   We didn't have iPhones or anything like that.
[00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:04.380]   I remember I took my son, my oldest son,
[00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:05.940]   I took him to Japan when he was four
[00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:08.540]   because I had the opportunity to do some skate demos.
[00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:10.580]   No one was paying me to do skate demos at the time.
[00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:12.480]   I was struggling to pay bills.
[00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:16.020]   And it was like this brand in Osaka said,
[00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:17.780]   oh, we want you to come to our skate shop
[00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:21.180]   and do two skate exhibitions a day in the skate shop.
[00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:23.340]   So they built these little ramps in their skate shop,
[00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:25.580]   like moved all their inventory.
[00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:29.380]   And I brought him along and yeah, it was challenging,
[00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:33.100]   but it made him appreciate different cultures and travel
[00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:33.940]   and things like that.
[00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:37.100]   Later on, he's 30 now, he's adventurous.
[00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:42.100]   He understands and he embraces other cultures
[00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:43.720]   and other ways of life.
[00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:44.560]   You know what I mean?
[00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:46.220]   It's not like everything's so, ew, it's weird.
[00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:49.020]   It's crazy, this food or the way they do things.
[00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:50.700]   He's down for it.
[00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:54.740]   - I think in the moment, we just took a trip with two kids,
[00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:56.140]   two in six months, and it's brutal,
[00:14:56.140 --> 00:14:58.340]   but you think, why are we doing this?
[00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:00.020]   And you got to constantly remind yourself,
[00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:01.180]   well, there's a reason we're doing this.
[00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:02.220]   We're doing this to expose--
[00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:04.120]   - I think in those years, it's super hard
[00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:06.420]   because it's like, they're not gonna remember any of this,
[00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:08.300]   but it does set a precedent
[00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:11.980]   and it sets a way of functioning with your family
[00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:13.740]   that they get used to.
[00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:16.780]   And you'll see other kids try to do that.
[00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:19.020]   Eventually, they're gonna want to bring friends along.
[00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:21.540]   The friends are like, what, I don't, I can't.
[00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:22.380]   Where do we go?
[00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:23.860]   What do we do?
[00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:26.180]   And your kids will be dialed in.
[00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:28.460]   - Even adapting ourselves, getting comfortable with,
[00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:31.820]   okay, well, traveling in London with two kids
[00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:34.100]   is very different from two single adults.
[00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:36.860]   And so we're trying to get comfortable with that,
[00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:40.260]   which was hard, and I think it worked really well.
[00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.380]   I know you've said skateboarding is a title,
[00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:43.660]   your favorite title's dad.
[00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:45.940]   Is there anything else you were trying to teach your kids?
[00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:47.180]   Give them that determination?
[00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:48.020]   Do they have it?
[00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:48.860]   Do they see it from you?
[00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:51.140]   - I think they see it from me by example,
[00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:54.420]   but I do feel like there is also a nature over nurture
[00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:58.980]   where I see them and they're all different.
[00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:02.500]   And a couple of them have that relentless determination
[00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:04.420]   and they're gonna see it through against all odds,
[00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:05.420]   against all injury.
[00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:10.420]   One of them was actually kind of so determined
[00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:15.140]   and so fearless that I worried for him when he was young.
[00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:17.300]   I used to say, it was my son Keegan,
[00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:19.140]   but I used to say like, you don't babysit Keegan,
[00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:20.420]   you go on death watch.
[00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:22.460]   You're just trying to keep him from hurting himself
[00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:24.780]   because he doesn't understand the consequences
[00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:26.100]   of all the stuff that he's trying to do.
[00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:26.940]   They're all very different,
[00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:31.940]   but I do see that they do have that same sense of commitment.
[00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:35.620]   - And was that a conscious thing,
[00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:39.180]   or do you think it was just by watching you have it yourself?
[00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:40.780]   - I think each of them are different,
[00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:44.420]   but they all do see their challenges through.
[00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:48.500]   Some are just a little more daring with their challenges.
[00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:50.420]   And I can't say they got that from me.
[00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:53.020]   I mean, maybe they saw that I would pose a challenge
[00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:54.900]   and then I would see it through for sure.
[00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:56.780]   But like I said, there was one,
[00:16:56.780 --> 00:17:00.220]   like some of my kids were really, really good skaters,
[00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:02.500]   really solid, had the foundational skills,
[00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:05.620]   but didn't really wanna push their limits too hard
[00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:07.500]   or put themselves in danger.
[00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:09.620]   And then other ones, one especially,
[00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:11.540]   was not great at skating early on,
[00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:13.420]   didn't wanna put in the hard work
[00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:15.060]   to get the foundational skills,
[00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:18.940]   but would try anything and get hurt, didn't care.
[00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:21.340]   - And were you there pushing or supporting,
[00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:24.140]   or what was your kind of role to help them grow and evolve?
[00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:25.820]   - It's hard with my position
[00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:30.020]   because of course I'm qualified to give them advice,
[00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:32.740]   but because I'm dad, they don't wanna hear it.
[00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:35.300]   And I actually have seen it happen time and time again,
[00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:36.900]   where I'll tell them to try something
[00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:38.540]   or to do it a different way.
[00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:41.020]   They don't take my advice
[00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:42.540]   'cause they're determined to do it their way.
[00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:43.620]   One of their friends is like,
[00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:45.380]   "Oh, you should put your foot over here more."
[00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:47.860]   And they do it and it works.
[00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:49.540]   Like, that's what I told you.
[00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:53.700]   - I feel like the same lesson applies with spouses as well.
[00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:55.220]   - Maybe a little bit, but they do.
[00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:57.540]   And honestly, it's fun too 'cause they all skate.
[00:17:57.540 --> 00:18:00.540]   And so when we go travel, I mean, they're all adults now,
[00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:02.660]   all of our boys, two are still in college,
[00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:04.220]   three are on their own.
[00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:05.980]   And then my daughter's the only one still at home.
[00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:07.060]   She's 14.
[00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:09.580]   So whenever we travel, they're very self-sufficient,
[00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:11.660]   but what they wanna do when we go places
[00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:12.820]   is to go to the skate parks.
[00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:13.660]   And at some point, he's like,
[00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:16.900]   "You guys, can I get a break from skating maybe?"
[00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:20.020]   So I ended up going with them as their filmer.
[00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:21.020]   - Okay.
[00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:23.700]   - That's my role when we travel together.
[00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:24.540]   - Videographer.
[00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:25.420]   - I am, yes.
[00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:29.860]   - Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:33.380]   I get it, life comes at you fast, but trust me,
[00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:36.260]   your friends are probably desperate for a good hang.
[00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:40.340]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:42.260]   Just make sure you do it the easy way
[00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:44.220]   and let our sponsor Drizzly,
[00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:47.940]   the go-to app for drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:50.740]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:52.620]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:54.020]   It could be your dog's birthday,
[00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:55.980]   that the sun finally came out,
[00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:57.460]   or maybe you just wanna celebrate
[00:18:57.460 --> 00:18:59.540]   that you got through another week.
[00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:01.660]   With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy
[00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:04.220]   by taking the drink run off your to-do list,
[00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:05.980]   which means you can entice your friends
[00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:09.060]   to leave their houses without ever leaving yours.
[00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:10.740]   And since I know you like a good deal,
[00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:13.300]   Drizzly compares prices on their massive selection
[00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:16.260]   of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:18.300]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails
[00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:20.140]   while we were hosting family last week,
[00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:22.220]   not only could I get an Italian Amaro
[00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:23.820]   delivered in less than an hour,
[00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:27.300]   but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:30.380]   So whatever the occasion, download the Drizzly app
[00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:32.260]   or go to drizzly.com.
[00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:36.260]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:39.500]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:44.700]   There are only a few brands I use almost every single day,
[00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:46.260]   and Viore is one of them.
[00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:47.860]   And I am so excited to be partnering
[00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:49.260]   with them for this episode.
[00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:52.460]   Viore makes performance apparel that's incredibly versatile.
[00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:54.100]   Everything is designed to work out in,
[00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:56.660]   but it doesn't look or feel like it at all.
[00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:58.460]   And it is so freaking comfortable,
[00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:00.540]   you will want to wear it all the time.
[00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:02.380]   Seriously, I'm pretty sure it's more comfortable
[00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:04.100]   than whatever you're wearing right now,
[00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:06.660]   unless it's Viore, in which case you know what I mean.
[00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:08.140]   And it's not just for men.
[00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:11.540]   My wife, Amy, is as obsessed with Viore as I am.
[00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:14.180]   My personal favorite is the Sunday Performance Joggers.
[00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:15.620]   I think I have three pairs of them,
[00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:17.100]   and they're probably the most comfortable pants
[00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:18.180]   I've ever owned.
[00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:19.980]   Their products are incredibly versatile
[00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:22.060]   and can be used for just about any activity,
[00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:23.980]   whether it's running, training, yoga,
[00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:26.140]   but they're also great for lounging.
[00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:29.380]   Or I even wear their MetaPants out to a nice dinner.
[00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:32.340]   Honestly, I think Viore is an investment in your happiness.
[00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:33.660]   And for All The Hacks listeners,

[00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:57.900]   - So we actually talk a lot about travel on the show.
[00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:00.460]   I'm imagining you've been to countless countries.
[00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:02.460]   I don't know if you even keep track.
[00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:04.060]   Is there a favorite?
[00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:06.260]   Are there places that you love going and going back to,
[00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:07.740]   aside from just the skating there,
[00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:09.180]   might inspire people listening?
[00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:13.980]   - Iceland is amazing because the landscape is so diverse.
[00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:16.820]   I can't explain it, but you go there,
[00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:18.180]   as soon as you leave the airport,
[00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:19.580]   it looks like you're on the moon.
[00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:23.140]   And there's just all this moss covering these rocks,
[00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:24.820]   and there's the Blue Lagoon.
[00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:26.860]   And then as you drive south,
[00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:29.740]   it completely changes into almost like a farm setting.
[00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:30.860]   And then it changes again,
[00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:32.660]   like another half hour into the drive.
[00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:34.380]   And yeah, it can get really cold there,
[00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:35.780]   but it's an amazing place.
[00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:38.980]   So my wife and I went there a long time ago,
[00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:43.980]   almost 15 years ago now, and it felt very untapped.
[00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:46.300]   Definitely wasn't a tourist destination.
[00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:49.860]   And now it feels much more like there is tourism.
[00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:51.980]   But if you just drive out of the city,
[00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:53.900]   you can see some amazing sights.
[00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:55.740]   - My general rule is if you go,
[00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:59.340]   not when everyone else goes and leave a little bit outside,
[00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:00.660]   you can have a very different experience.
[00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:03.180]   - Yeah, we're not afraid to go way off the beaten path,
[00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:04.060]   which we do a lot.
[00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:06.820]   Other than that, Japan is just so surreal.
[00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:08.700]   It feels like a video game.
[00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:11.420]   - We just did an episode on Japan,
[00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:13.500]   and we were like three hours in,
[00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:15.380]   and we covered Tokyo and Kyoto.
[00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:16.220]   - Oh yeah.
[00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:17.060]   - We couldn't even get close
[00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:18.620]   to comprehending the entire country.
[00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:19.860]   And the guy I was talking to
[00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:21.780]   had been there 20 times or something,
[00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:23.540]   and he's just still like everywhere I go,
[00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:25.020]   I see something new.
[00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:25.860]   - Oh, every time.
[00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:27.340]   We brought our kids when they were all,
[00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:30.540]   I brought all of them just before they were teenagers,
[00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:32.940]   and they were all mesmerized.
[00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:34.020]   Like it was fascinating.
[00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:36.300]   Even Disneyland, still the Magic Kingdom,
[00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:37.580]   but it's very different.
[00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:38.980]   - Japan's one of the coolest places.
[00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:41.900]   Early on, you traveled a lot as a skater
[00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:44.900]   before you'd hit the success you've had now.
[00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:47.060]   I gotta ask a question I know everyone is thinking
[00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:49.220]   because multiple people said I should ask.
[00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:50.540]   Racking up all these miles?
[00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:53.580]   'Cause I know you weren't making a lot in the early days,
[00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:56.180]   especially in that kind of mid part of your career.
[00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:57.220]   What was that like?
[00:22:57.220 --> 00:22:59.100]   You started getting tall, uncomfortable,
[00:22:59.100 --> 00:22:59.940]   were you using points,
[00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:01.740]   were you trying to get status and upgrades?
[00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:04.060]   - Honestly, I didn't fly first class
[00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:07.340]   until I was in my 30s.
[00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:09.340]   - Were you optimizing things when you traveled,
[00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:11.300]   thinking okay, I'm gonna rack up a bunch of miles?
[00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:13.660]   - Yeah, but also I just learned how to travel
[00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:16.220]   more efficiently and a little bit lighter,
[00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:19.380]   and how to navigate airports and lines
[00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:22.900]   and where the best security checkpoint is
[00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:25.460]   instead of the one where everyone's just being fed into,
[00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:26.380]   just stuff like that.
[00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:29.220]   I guess I learned how to be a better traveler in those days,
[00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:32.940]   but I learned the value of frequent flyer miles
[00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:33.780]   through those years,
[00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:35.980]   especially when I wasn't making very much money,
[00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:38.700]   but I still have to travel to go do stuff.
[00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:39.940]   I collected a lot of miles.
[00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:44.260]   I mean, I was a million miler on United very early on.
[00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:47.620]   And you know what they sent me for that?
[00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:48.660]   - Luggage tax.
[00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:49.740]   - That was gonna be my guess.
[00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:52.340]   It's not a very rewarding experience.
[00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:53.780]   Here you go, 10 bucks.
[00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:54.860]   What would some of the things
[00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:56.980]   if you were telling your favorite travel hacks
[00:23:56.980 --> 00:23:59.180]   to how you make your life efficient when you travel,
[00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:02.220]   whether it's a secret neck pillow or some crazy eye mask?
[00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:03.060]   - Well, let's see.
[00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:07.380]   I just flew home from New York and it was last minute,
[00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:08.740]   and so I'm in the bulkhead.
[00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:09.900]   It's not some great hack,
[00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:14.660]   but if you want to travel with your laptop or anything else,
[00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:17.200]   'cause you have to put your backpack up in the overhead,
[00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:18.180]   we're getting into the weeds here,
[00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:21.140]   but if you're in the bulkhead,
[00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:25.020]   take your laptop out and put it right under your feet
[00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:28.140]   so that half of it's kind of under your own seat,
[00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:29.060]   and then the other half,
[00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:30.780]   you just kind of lightly put your heels on it.
[00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:33.220]   It'll hide it from the flight attendants.
[00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:34.140]   And then you have your laptop.
[00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:35.380]   You don't have to go up and get it.
[00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:36.860]   - Yeah, I love it.
[00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:37.700]   - Which is kind of a hassle, right?
[00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:39.100]   - Yeah, if you have one of those laptop sleeves,
[00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:40.220]   I like to get like a black one
[00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:41.820]   'cause then it just blends in everywhere.
[00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:44.900]   - Yeah, I'm pretty good at just hiding it all together.
[00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:47.060]   And then usually like I'll have a little bag,
[00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:49.160]   it's usually actually my toiletry kit.
[00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:52.080]   And then I just stuff like my headphones
[00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:54.200]   and my iPhone cable and everything.
[00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:55.080]   - Everything you need.
[00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:55.920]   - Everything I need,
[00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:57.120]   but just put that on the side of the seat
[00:24:57.120 --> 00:24:57.960]   so they don't see that either.
[00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:00.000]   That's my bulkhead hack for you.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.520]   But as far as other travel,
[00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:05.160]   it's not like I carry some big wardrobe or anything,
[00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:10.160]   but I do try to keep it down to a carry-on and a backpack
[00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:13.440]   if I can at all costs,
[00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:14.720]   'cause I don't want to check bags.
[00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:17.580]   I'll tell you the biggest travel hacks for skateboards
[00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:19.380]   and people will travel with skateboards,
[00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:22.020]   but you can travel with a skateboard
[00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:25.500]   and put it in the overhead anywhere in the US.
[00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:27.200]   If you're making a connection,
[00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:32.200]   say in Frankfurt or London or even Tokyo,
[00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:36.940]   you can't carry your skateboard on the plane
[00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:39.060]   through those airports.
[00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:41.580]   So I've been told a couple of times,
[00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:42.740]   I've actually gotten away with it once
[00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:43.740]   and I learned the hard way,
[00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:45.580]   like going through London,
[00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:47.740]   you're in the terminal, you're connecting,
[00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:48.980]   but you know how you have to go through
[00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:51.060]   another security checkpoint?
[00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:52.100]   You can't bring your skateboard,
[00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:54.400]   so you have to go outside the airport
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:56.580]   on a connecting flight and check it in.
[00:25:56.580 --> 00:25:58.540]   - And probably miss your flight, maybe.
[00:25:58.540 --> 00:25:59.380]   - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:01.540]   No, I've actually thrown a skateboard away because of that.
[00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:02.380]   - Yeah.
[00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:03.820]   - In London, they said, "Oh, you got to check in."
[00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:05.020]   I go, "I don't have time."
[00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:06.340]   They go, "Well, I don't know what to tell you."
[00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:08.340]   And then I put it in the trash can
[00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:10.140]   at the security checkpoint.
[00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:10.980]   Okay, done.
[00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:11.800]   - Do you think it's a safety risk?
[00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:14.100]   It's a weapon or like what?
[00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:15.260]   - I assume, yeah.
[00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:17.620]   I mean, also Mexico too, surprisingly,
[00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:20.840]   you can't carry a skateboard on the airplane in Mexico.
[00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:22.940]   So every time we travel with the kids to Mexico,
[00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:25.380]   we've got to put them all in plastic bags.
[00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:27.240]   So we're a disaster coming back
[00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:28.820]   'cause we're just a bunch of luggage.
[00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:29.900]   That's my advice.
[00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:31.380]   I don't know if it's a hack, it's just my advice.
[00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:33.700]   Like if you're going to travel through Europe,
[00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:36.020]   don't carry your skateboard onto the plane
[00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:37.380]   that is connecting.
[00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:40.100]   - That could probably apply to other items.
[00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:41.400]   Not that it's the end of the world
[00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:44.080]   to replace things like nail clippers.
[00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:46.000]   There's some country where you can't bring nail clippers
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:46.920]   on your plane, 'cause I remember,
[00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:49.880]   or if it has that like slide out file thing.
[00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:52.360]   And I've definitely gotten dinged on that.
[00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:55.560]   So I would say the hack is to look up
[00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:57.400]   what are the security requirements
[00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:59.120]   for the country you're transiting through
[00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:02.120]   or try at all costs to fly direct.
[00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:04.240]   Just to avoid these problems when possible.
[00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:05.080]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:07.160]   I live in San Diego, but I live in North County
[00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:11.080]   and used to be able to fly from Carlsbad Airport to LAX.
[00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:14.320]   And so basically you could go anywhere from LAX, right?
[00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:17.760]   So that was always like the best way to do it.
[00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:20.960]   But many times our Carlsbad flight would be canceled
[00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:22.920]   and we just have to literally drive to Carlsbad Airport.
[00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:24.440]   Like if your flight's canceled,
[00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:27.640]   just keep going North to LAX with the skateboard thing.
[00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:31.640]   I remember, so my wife and I usually carry our skateboards
[00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:33.960]   when we go places, 'cause we like to skate around cities,
[00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:35.240]   you know, just as transportation.
[00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:37.200]   If we're going by ourselves
[00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:40.640]   and we were coming back from Brazil, maybe,
[00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:41.880]   and we were coming through
[00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:44.680]   where you hand them your customs form.
[00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:46.600]   I'll never forget this.
[00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:47.880]   He grabbed my customs form
[00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:51.820]   and he saw my skateboard in his peripheral.
[00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:55.480]   And immediately was like, "Go that way to secondary."
[00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:56.320]   'Cause he saw my skateboard.
[00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:57.400]   It was so obvious.
[00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:58.560]   I just saw his wheelchair and like,
[00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:00.560]   "Oh, he's a problem, he's a skateboarder."
[00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:03.200]   And he looked up and he saw my face and he recognized it,
[00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:05.640]   but he'd already handed me this red card
[00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:07.000]   to go to secondary.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.080]   And he goes, "Oh, you know what?
[00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:10.200]   "Just tell them you're in a hurry."
[00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:12.080]   I said, "Oh, is that gonna work for me?
[00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:13.080]   "You're sending me to secondary
[00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:14.080]   "where they're gonna go through all my stuff
[00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:15.920]   "and I'm gonna tell them I'm in a hurry.
[00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:18.640]   "That's probably not the best approach."
[00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:20.000]   And then my wife and I got into secondary.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.680]   They wouldn't let us go to the bathroom.
[00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:23.900]   We were very much being interrogated.
[00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:24.880]   - Wow.
[00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:25.840]   You've told lots of stories.
[00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:28.240]   I'll encourage anyone here to go check out the internet
[00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:30.280]   for all the stories of you getting recognized
[00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:31.100]   as other people.
[00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:33.380]   Is there a good one you don't share?
[00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:36.140]   - Yeah, it still happens all the time.
[00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:39.260]   It's weird now because obviously, as you would know,
[00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:40.900]   that meme kind of took off.
[00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:43.540]   Not the meme, but it's just me telling my story.
[00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:46.580]   Like all the stories I tell are absolutely true, 100%.
[00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:48.820]   But it started happening so,
[00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:50.840]   it would happen pretty frequently and I was sharing it.
[00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:52.500]   And at some point people thought I was making it up.
[00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:54.860]   So I kind of stopped sharing these incidents
[00:28:54.860 --> 00:28:57.740]   because people were just like, "Come on, like really?"
[00:28:57.740 --> 00:28:59.900]   But now it's gotten to a point where
[00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:03.900]   it's like this vicious cycle where people now want to say it
[00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:07.540]   even though they know who I am all the time.
[00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:11.820]   So I would say that happens probably three times a day,
[00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:12.660]   that interaction.
[00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:15.620]   Like anyone ever tell you, you look like Tony Hawk?
[00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:16.980]   Yup, and you're the first today.
[00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:20.140]   But then it happens genuinely at least once or twice too.
[00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:21.500]   When it happens genuinely,
[00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:22.620]   if people were following me around,
[00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:23.820]   they wouldn't believe it.
[00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:24.780]   'Cause you know what I mean?
[00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:26.380]   Like they hear about it and it's just like,
[00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:28.380]   all right, like enough with this whole,
[00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:30.180]   I don't even know what you'd call it,
[00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:32.700]   mistaken identity thing.
[00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:34.380]   So yes, it still happens.
[00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:36.340]   It happens as a joke, it happens for real.
[00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:39.060]   I think my favorite one as of late
[00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:41.780]   was that I was sitting at a gate
[00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:43.660]   and this guy was sitting across from me at the gate
[00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:47.500]   and he came over, he's a man, he looked just like Tony Hawk.
[00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:49.180]   Said, "Oh yeah, I know, I've heard that."
[00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:50.580]   He's like, "That's crazy."
[00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:52.220]   And then he went and sat back down
[00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:56.180]   and then a group of people came who did recognize me
[00:29:56.180 --> 00:29:59.940]   for real and wanted autographs and pictures.
[00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:03.380]   And the whole time he's watching me laughing
[00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:08.340]   because he's in on the joke that it's not really me.
[00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:09.180]   Do you know what I mean?
[00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:11.540]   Like he and I are sharing this inside joke somehow
[00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:14.740]   that these people are crazy and they're mistaken.
[00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:16.660]   But he just thought it was hilarious.
[00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:18.780]   - Did you ever tell him at the end or did he ever?
[00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:19.620]   - No, I don't.
[00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:22.780]   It's up to them to either decide that or to ask me.
[00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:24.100]   It drives my daughter crazy
[00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:26.260]   because a lot of times people will say,
[00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:27.300]   "Everybody tell you you look like Tony Hawk."
[00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:29.460]   I'm like, "Yeah, that's cool."
[00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:30.480]   And they walk away and my daughter's like,
[00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:31.380]   "Why didn't you tell him?"
[00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:32.540]   I go, "He didn't ask."
[00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:35.900]   - So if someone asks, you'll say yeah.
[00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:36.900]   - Of course, yeah.
[00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:38.540]   - All right, well I hope whoever was sitting across from me
[00:30:38.540 --> 00:30:39.460]   at the airport is listening
[00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:41.260]   and they can finally come to terms with the fact
[00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:42.100]   that this guy is really you. - No, I think he had
[00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:45.780]   way more fun in his mind making fun of people.
[00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:46.620]   - Yeah.
[00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:49.060]   - Like that was his thing, so I just let him run with it.
[00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:52.500]   - So to round out travel, I'm sure you buy lots of things.
[00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:53.820]   Do you play the points game?
[00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:56.620]   Do you try to rack up points or cash back on credit cards
[00:30:56.620 --> 00:30:58.620]   to travel for free still?
[00:30:58.620 --> 00:31:02.020]   - Yes, I try to focus in on one or two airlines
[00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:05.500]   or their partners so that I rack up the most points on them,
[00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:07.460]   which is for the most part United and Delta,
[00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:12.340]   but also all my credit card purchases go towards miles.
[00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:14.900]   So I use those for my team.
[00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:18.140]   So for instance, we have the skater Felipe Nunez
[00:31:18.140 --> 00:31:20.140]   from Brazil, you might've seen him.
[00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:22.620]   He's a double amputee.
[00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:24.340]   He skates like kind of sitting on his board.
[00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:26.420]   He's amazing. - It's crazy.
[00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:29.420]   I'll find a link to and put it in the show notes.
[00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:31.140]   - Truly deserves to be a pro skater.
[00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:33.980]   Like he is incredible and has only gotten better,
[00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:37.860]   but it's tricky 'cause he lives in a really small town,
[00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:41.020]   a couple hours from Sao Paulo and Curitiba.
[00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:44.340]   So for me to get him flights is always really tricky
[00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:47.740]   and challenging, but I do it using my points
[00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:50.880]   and I can get him his flights all the time.
[00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:53.100]   He has to travel with kind of a handler
[00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:54.180]   and it's a whole thing.
[00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:56.020]   And I use that for his flights.
[00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:57.780]   I use them for my other skaters flights
[00:31:57.780 --> 00:32:00.100]   if they need to get somewhere for a skate trip or whatever.
[00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:01.220]   And it's been awesome.
[00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:02.500]   - Everyone's always surprised.
[00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:04.060]   Like no matter how successful you are,
[00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:06.420]   no matter how famous or rich or whatever you are,
[00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:07.880]   everyone still wants to make sure
[00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:09.260]   that when they're spending money on their card,
[00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:12.860]   they're getting like the most they can out of their rewards.
[00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:14.900]   - Yeah, and also just with me,
[00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:17.420]   sometimes other groups do my travel.
[00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:19.540]   If I'm going to an event, I do a lot of speaking gigs,
[00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:21.480]   corporate gigs and whatnot and conferences.
[00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:24.340]   And so sometimes it's up to them to do the travel
[00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:26.980]   and they don't plug in my advantage number
[00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:29.340]   or my mileage plus number or whatever.
[00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:33.180]   And it's such a hassle, like it all seems so frivolous,
[00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:34.940]   but it's important because it's like,
[00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:37.820]   you can go to a different line, you know what I mean?
[00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:39.340]   For security or whatever it is.
[00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:41.060]   And there's just some efficiency to it.
[00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:43.540]   And when you travel as much as I do,
[00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:44.980]   those things count for a lot.
[00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:46.940]   - I know someone who's part of their rider for speaking
[00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:49.740]   is like, I will book my flights and you will reimburse me
[00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:51.560]   because I just don't want-- - That is usually what we do.
[00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:54.120]   But every once in a while, it slips through the cracks.
[00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:55.880]   - Well, if anyone's listening, if you ever take a flight
[00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:57.540]   and you didn't put your number in,
[00:32:57.540 --> 00:32:59.680]   you can actually retroactively ask for credit.
[00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:01.080]   So if you ever forget,
[00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:02.520]   the airlines do allow you to do that.
[00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:04.840]   - It's better to do it at a ticket counter though.
[00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:07.680]   - Yes, they can do it faster. - They can do it immediately.
[00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:10.240]   That's the other thing is people like,
[00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:13.360]   they wield such great power at the ticket counters.
[00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:15.900]   They could literally just put you on a flight to London
[00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:19.120]   first class without blinking an eye if they wanted to.
[00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:21.160]   - It always amazes me when something happened
[00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:22.580]   and they're yelling at this person.
[00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:25.440]   And I'm like, you realize the person that holds the keys
[00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:28.080]   to whatever your situation will be--
[00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:32.280]   - Is that person who is not responsible for your delay
[00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:34.160]   or for your seat mix-up.
[00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:36.520]   - I think just being nice to the person at the desk
[00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:39.760]   can pay dividends on-- - Oh, absolutely, yeah.
[00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:41.000]   No, I agreed.
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.400]   - I've never scored this kind of mythical,
[00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:45.600]   we're just gonna upgrade you for no reason kind of thing.
[00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:47.720]   Obviously, if you have status, you can get it.
[00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:49.840]   But everything else like, oh, my flight's gone.
[00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:51.240]   They could decide, do I wanna put you
[00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:53.640]   on that easy connection or do I wanna just give you a coupon
[00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:55.560]   and you can get a hotel and come back tomorrow.
[00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:57.480]   And playing that game has been very helpful.
[00:33:57.480 --> 00:34:00.040]   And if that line's too long, I always try to call
[00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:02.560]   and see if I can get someone faster than a long line.
[00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:03.600]   Like when a flight's canceled
[00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:05.200]   and there's 100 people lined up.
[00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:06.200]   - Oh, yeah, yeah.
[00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:09.080]   So I have all the apps, the flight track,
[00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:12.360]   that will sometimes alert me to a problem with my flight
[00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:13.920]   before the airline does.
[00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:17.080]   So I'm always kind of ahead of the curve with that
[00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:19.040]   where it's like, oh, this thing's getting canceled.
[00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:21.640]   I'm gonna go figure this out before everyone else
[00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:23.320]   at the gate knows that's what's happening.
[00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:24.600]   - And you're like telling them, you're like,
[00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:25.440]   the flight's canceled.
[00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:26.600]   She's like, what, what?
[00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:28.680]   Oh, yes, it is canceled, you're telling them.
[00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:31.720]   So one other area that we haven't talked a lot about
[00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:33.400]   is around health and fitness.
[00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:36.160]   And people like Laird Hamilton go nuts about everything
[00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:38.840]   they do with their regime for exercise, sauna,
[00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:40.560]   all this stuff.
[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:42.280]   Skateboarding, I think some people,
[00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:43.280]   especially when I was a kid,
[00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:45.440]   like didn't even see it as a physical sport.
[00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:47.280]   I can assure you, I'm sure you can assure everyone
[00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:48.920]   that it is.
[00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:52.920]   How much was kind of diet, exercise, training
[00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:55.280]   outside of skating important?
[00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:57.280]   Or how has that evolved as you've gotten older?
[00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:58.760]   - I think in the early days,
[00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:02.160]   I didn't recognize the importance of my diet and training
[00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:05.600]   and whatnot, but I was so obsessed with skating
[00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:07.880]   that that was all my exercise.
[00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:10.280]   And that was enough because I was skating
[00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:13.480]   three to four hours a day, every day, giving it my all.
[00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:18.480]   So I think that over time, and also just seeing my peers,
[00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:21.400]   I saw a lot of them not take care of themselves,
[00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:22.800]   drinking too much, partying,
[00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:25.600]   and really kind of losing their skillsets.
[00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:29.920]   And so skating was always such a paramount importance to me
[00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:33.120]   that I was never going to let that happen.
[00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:35.400]   And I saw it by example, like, oh man,
[00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:36.240]   he's not skating good.
[00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:38.760]   Oh, that's 'cause he won't stop partying.
[00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:41.920]   And so for me, that was sort of the first lesson
[00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:45.680]   was not completely, but clean living for the most part.
[00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:47.200]   But as I grew older,
[00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:49.480]   then I realized the importance of diet
[00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:52.760]   and of trying to stay active when I can't skate.
[00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:56.240]   And now, especially at my age and with my current recovery,
[00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:57.960]   I've learned that I gotta stay active,
[00:35:57.960 --> 00:35:59.840]   even if I can't skate, I gotta.
[00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:03.000]   And I need to do so much stuff to help.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.840]   I'm recovering from a broken femur from last year.
[00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:08.240]   I need to do so many things to help that healing.
[00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:10.400]   At one point, it was a full-time job
[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:12.920]   and I had to kind of back off from it.
[00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:15.040]   'Cause I was like, maybe I just need to wait,
[00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:16.640]   just give it time instead of trying to do
[00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:19.640]   all these other things like hyperbaric chamber
[00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:22.200]   and laser treatment and acupuncture and peptides.
[00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:25.760]   And I was going all the way in with all those treatments.
[00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:27.320]   And at some point,
[00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:29.960]   I actually went the wrong way with my recovery,
[00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:32.800]   but only because I couldn't stop skating.
[00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:36.200]   So my bone never connected to itself.
[00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:39.040]   It never actually became one bone again.
[00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:41.680]   So I had it reset two months ago.
[00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:43.360]   - Are there things that you've experimented with,
[00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:46.720]   whether it's diet or different kinds of treatment
[00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:49.360]   that you think you'll keep in a routine that are lasting
[00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:51.200]   or things like breathwork or yoga
[00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:53.880]   or any of those things that are part of your routine?
[00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:57.000]   - I think swimming helped me with my strength a lot
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:58.280]   when I wasn't skating.
[00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:01.000]   So I'm gonna lean into that more going forward,
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:04.480]   including with my skating and just trying to,
[00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:07.320]   it's more like not eating to excess
[00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:10.680]   and not indulging in sweets and sodas and stuff like that.
[00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:14.080]   I still carry a lot of my habits from as a kid.
[00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:17.820]   Then I still enjoy, you know, not the healthiest of foods,
[00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:21.680]   but I don't go all in on just fast food
[00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:24.120]   and just more stuff that's gonna slow me down
[00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:28.660]   and try to make a concerted effort to take supplements,
[00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:31.920]   to eat greens, less processed foods, stuff like that.
[00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:32.840]   - What kind of supplements?
[00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:35.360]   - Well, I take quite a few, but most importantly,
[00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:36.440]   I have to take a stat now
[00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:39.440]   'cause I have high cholesterol because of my family history.
[00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:41.920]   So I take Qnol CoQ10.
[00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:43.640]   It was funny because they reached out to me
[00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:45.760]   about possibly doing an endorsement.
[00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:46.880]   Like, "Do you know what this is?"
[00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:48.780]   You know, I take it.
[00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:50.880]   I literally take it every day.
[00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:54.240]   And so I was kind of the perfect one for their campaign.
[00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:55.080]   - Yeah. - You know what I mean?
[00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:57.440]   So it's stuff like that, but multivitamins too.
[00:37:57.440 --> 00:37:58.440]   - Okay.
[00:37:58.440 --> 00:37:59.880]   - And a bevy of other ones,
[00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:03.240]   just trying to keep all my levels balanced.
[00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:04.240]   - What about the morning routine?
[00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:06.360]   Are you early up and get after it?
[00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:08.480]   - Yeah, well, we still have one at home.
[00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:10.120]   I gotta make sure my daughter is up
[00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:11.720]   and getting ready by 7 a.m.
[00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:13.800]   So I'm usually up by 6.30.
[00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:16.940]   That's not crazy early, but sometimes it's six.
[00:38:16.940 --> 00:38:18.440]   And that's kind of my time
[00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:21.200]   to try to go through my communications,
[00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:22.840]   emails, and whatnot.
[00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:26.300]   Because as the day starts and as, like, she goes to school,
[00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:29.120]   I come here, this is my office, this is where my ramp is.
[00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:30.920]   Things get crazy through the day.
[00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:33.960]   And so it's hard to stay on top of communication.
[00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:38.440]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions
[00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:40.920]   about life, money, and so much more.
[00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:43.520]   But sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people
[00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:44.960]   in your situation,
[00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:47.560]   which actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:50.820]   So I wanna introduce you to today's sponsor, Long Angle.
[00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:53.680]   Long Angle is a community of high net worth individuals
[00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:55.840]   with backgrounds in everything from technology,
[00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:57.920]   finance, medicine, to real estate,
[00:38:57.920 --> 00:39:00.360]   law, manufacturing, and more.
[00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:01.760]   I'm a member of Long Angle.
[00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:03.760]   I've loved being a part of the community.
[00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:06.080]   And I've even had one of the founders, Tad Fallows,
[00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:08.220]   join me on all the hacks in episode 87
[00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:10.560]   to talk about alternative investments.
[00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:12.280]   Now, the majority of Long Angle members
[00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:14.100]   are first generation wealth,
[00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:16.160]   young, highly successful individuals
[00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:18.320]   who join the community to share knowledge
[00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:19.640]   and learn from each other
[00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:22.240]   in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:24.520]   On top of that, members also get access
[00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:27.880]   to some unique private market investment opportunities.
[00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:29.280]   Like I said, I'm a member
[00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:31.440]   and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:33.420]   because you're getting advice and feedback
[00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:35.920]   from people in a similar situation to you
[00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:38.360]   on everything from your investment portfolio,
[00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:42.000]   to your children's education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.200]   So many of these conversations aren't happening
[00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:45.680]   anywhere else online.
[00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:49.340]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets,
[00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:51.200]   which is their minimum for membership,
[00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:53.320]   I encourage you to check out Long Angle
[00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:55.440]   and it's totally free to join.
[00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:58.560]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:00.080]   And if you choose to apply,
[00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:03.040]   be sure to let them know you heard about it here.
[00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:07.100]   Again, that's longangle, A-N-G-L-E.com.
[00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:11.260]   I wish I could say I'm eating a fully balanced diet
[00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:13.880]   every day, but the reality is that I'm not.
[00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:15.740]   So I love having an easy way
[00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:17.880]   to get my daily nutritional insurance,
[00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:19.560]   which is why I kickstart every day
[00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:21.480]   with AG1 from Athletic Greens
[00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:25.040]   and I'm excited to be partnering with them for this episode.
[00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:27.560]   AG1 has been in my routine for the past six months
[00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:29.320]   because I think it's the best option
[00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:32.200]   for easy, optimal nutrition out there.
[00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:33.920]   You take one scoop of AG1
[00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:36.640]   and you're absorbing 75 high-quality vitamins,
[00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:38.960]   minerals, whole food source superfoods,
[00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:41.900]   probiotics, and adaptogens to help you start your day right.
[00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:44.360]   Every morning, I mix it up with some cold water,
[00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:47.520]   add a few ice cubes because it tastes so good cold,
[00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:49.600]   and head to my office feeling focused
[00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:51.120]   and energized for the day,
[00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:53.620]   which is a feeling I absolutely love.
[00:40:53.620 --> 00:40:56.360]   I also love that it has less than one gram of sugar
[00:40:56.360 --> 00:41:00.400]   and no GMOs, nasty chemicals, or artificial anything.
[00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:02.160]   To make giving it a try easy,
[00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:05.240]   Athletic Greens is gonna give you a free one-year supply
[00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:07.120]   of immune-supporting vitamin D
[00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:10.600]   and five free travel packs with your first purchase.
[00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:15.440]   All you have to do is visit allthehacks.com/athleticgreens.
[00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:20.080]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/athleticgreens
[00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:21.760]   to take ownership over your health
[00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:24.740]   and pick up the ultimate daily nutritional insurance.
[00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:28.360]   I just wanna thank you quick for listening to
[00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:29.840]   and supporting the show.

[00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:44.140]   So please consider supporting those who support us.
[00:41:44.140 --> 00:41:47.480]   I heard you say in a podcast almost five years ago
[00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:48.880]   that your kryptonite was time.
[00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:51.960]   I'm curious if in the last few years,
[00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:53.160]   you've made any changes,
[00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:55.760]   whether it's to time management or anything,
[00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:57.080]   that made you more productive.
[00:41:57.080 --> 00:41:58.680]   Yeah, I've learned to say no.
[00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:00.960]   It's hard, especially when things are growing
[00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:02.080]   and things are successful
[00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:04.400]   and people are asking for your time
[00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:07.100]   and for you to attend events
[00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:09.480]   or for you to do interviews and things like that.
[00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:13.800]   And at some point, I thought I don't need to do these things
[00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:18.800]   and I don't think that they are necessarily beneficial.
[00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:19.780]   I don't know.
[00:42:19.780 --> 00:42:22.420]   They just don't seem like they should be so obligatory.
[00:42:22.420 --> 00:42:24.160]   I'm honored that people wanna talk to me
[00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:25.200]   and that people want me to do stuff,
[00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:28.440]   but at some point I needed for my own sanity
[00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:32.240]   and also for my own family dynamic
[00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:34.480]   to just be available to them
[00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:36.120]   and not be on the move all the time
[00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:37.680]   or just home on my phone.
[00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:38.680]   I think that's one thing
[00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:41.120]   that people don't necessarily recognize
[00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:44.220]   is that just because you are home,
[00:42:44.220 --> 00:42:46.520]   if your attention is elsewhere, you're not really home.
[00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:48.800]   I think it's something that when you have young kids,
[00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:50.200]   you start to realize, wow,
[00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:53.080]   the number of times I'm just a little bit distracted
[00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:54.720]   because they run off and you're like,
[00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:55.960]   whoa, I was distracted.
[00:42:55.960 --> 00:42:56.780]   They're no longer interested.
[00:42:56.780 --> 00:42:57.620]   Or they're trying to show you something
[00:42:57.620 --> 00:42:59.140]   and you're like, uh-huh, yep, yep, uh-huh, uh-huh.
[00:42:59.140 --> 00:43:00.160]   And you think that that's good enough,
[00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:02.240]   but they see that, that can affect them.
[00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:04.560]   - In some ways, it might've been much easier
[00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:06.800]   to be a parent before all of the distraction
[00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:08.240]   that we have today. - Right, yeah.
[00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:09.600]   - In other ways, I think it was way harder.
[00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:11.960]   - Yeah, so I was very young.
[00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:13.840]   I was 24 when my first son was born
[00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:16.960]   and that was, there were no DVRs.
[00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:20.420]   We were still using VHS and he would wake up super early
[00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:24.280]   and sometimes before Sesame Street was on the air.
[00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:25.680]   You know what I mean? - Yeah, you're like, what do we do?
[00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:28.580]   - Yeah, what do we, yeah, let's read a book or do something.
[00:43:28.580 --> 00:43:30.700]   You learn to entertain the old-fashioned way.
[00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:32.420]   Storytelling. (laughing)
[00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:33.920]   - Find us on flights now.
[00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:35.900]   It's like you're on a flight, you're on Southwest.
[00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:37.620]   There's no TVs, there's no, you're sitting there
[00:43:37.620 --> 00:43:40.300]   and you're like, it's amazing how kids are like,
[00:43:40.300 --> 00:43:41.660]   I wanna run around and you're like,
[00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:42.500]   well, you can't run around.
[00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:43.860]   It's like, I wanna read a book.
[00:43:43.860 --> 00:43:45.760]   Okay, five minutes in, I don't wanna read a book anymore.
[00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:48.040]   So I think flights in that kind of toddler age
[00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:48.880]   are really tough.
[00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:50.300]   - Tell you a hack for toddlers,
[00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:53.260]   since you do have young ones and this is gonna be weird,
[00:43:53.260 --> 00:43:55.460]   but it worked for me a couple of times.
[00:43:55.460 --> 00:43:58.920]   My son was prone to being carsick sometimes
[00:43:58.920 --> 00:44:00.200]   and on planes too.
[00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:02.320]   Sometimes we would be walking through a terminal
[00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:04.760]   or something and then he would just barf.
[00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:08.880]   And I learned that it's very easy to remove your shoe,
[00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:12.200]   remove one sock, use that as a rag
[00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:13.640]   and just throw the sock away
[00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:15.560]   and deal with just wearing one sock
[00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:17.640]   the rest of your trip or your day
[00:44:17.640 --> 00:44:20.000]   to save from having to try to go
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:21.880]   some massive cleanup effort.
[00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:22.960]   - The sock burp cloth.
[00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:24.240]   - Sock burp cloth, yeah.
[00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:25.460]   I've done it a few times.
[00:44:25.460 --> 00:44:29.220]   - The last thing we didn't really talk on was around money.
[00:44:29.220 --> 00:44:31.060]   So early on in your career,
[00:44:31.060 --> 00:44:33.140]   you were making six figures in high school.
[00:44:33.140 --> 00:44:34.340]   I'm trying to comprehend that.
[00:44:34.340 --> 00:44:35.180]   Most people in high school
[00:44:35.180 --> 00:44:38.300]   are making maybe a couple bucks on a side gig.
[00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:40.260]   What was the relationship with money like back then?
[00:44:40.260 --> 00:44:42.260]   - Well, it was all a big surprise
[00:44:42.260 --> 00:44:45.180]   'cause it wasn't like you got into skateboarding
[00:44:45.180 --> 00:44:46.100]   to be rich or famous.
[00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:48.140]   No one had become rich or famous.
[00:44:48.140 --> 00:44:49.580]   No one made money doing it.
[00:44:49.580 --> 00:44:50.660]   You just did it 'cause you loved it.
[00:44:50.660 --> 00:44:52.020]   And all of a sudden there was this fame
[00:44:52.020 --> 00:44:53.200]   and there was this money
[00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:55.860]   and I was in my late teens.
[00:44:55.860 --> 00:45:00.160]   I'd say I started making pretty good money around 16, 17.
[00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:02.860]   And it was like, oh, this is awesome.
[00:45:02.860 --> 00:45:05.140]   I'm gonna take all my friends to Hawaii.
[00:45:05.140 --> 00:45:07.540]   I'm going to Sharper Image and buying all the gear.
[00:45:07.540 --> 00:45:10.940]   And at some point my dad gave me the best advice.
[00:45:10.940 --> 00:45:13.100]   He said, I really think you should put some of that money away.
[00:45:13.100 --> 00:45:15.180]   I was like, why?
[00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:17.740]   As if it's just gonna keep raining down on me.
[00:45:17.740 --> 00:45:18.780]   And he said, well,
[00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:20.140]   you just don't know if this is gonna last.
[00:45:20.140 --> 00:45:22.000]   'Cause he really wanted me to go to college.
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:23.100]   And he's like, if you're gonna do this,
[00:45:23.100 --> 00:45:25.940]   you should really save from what you're making here.
[00:45:25.940 --> 00:45:30.260]   So when I was 17, he co-signed a mortgage.
[00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:31.540]   I had the income to qualify,
[00:45:31.540 --> 00:45:33.420]   but I literally was not old enough
[00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:35.340]   to sign the paperwork by myself.
[00:45:35.340 --> 00:45:37.740]   So he co-signed on a house for me.
[00:45:37.740 --> 00:45:42.460]   So I lived in my own place as a senior in high school.
[00:45:42.460 --> 00:45:43.580]   As if I was in college.
[00:45:43.580 --> 00:45:44.420]   Parents weren't there.
[00:45:44.420 --> 00:45:45.340]   So. No.
[00:45:45.340 --> 00:45:46.180]   And then I had.
[00:45:46.180 --> 00:45:47.020]   All the high school parties.
[00:45:47.020 --> 00:45:49.420]   I had one roommate that was also at the same high school.
[00:45:49.420 --> 00:45:51.980]   We had two older roommates that just had jobs,
[00:45:51.980 --> 00:45:55.460]   but were young enough to be taking advantage
[00:45:55.460 --> 00:45:57.140]   of the situation.
[00:45:57.140 --> 00:45:59.060]   You know, when you're in high school,
[00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:00.500]   whoever's friends are out of town,
[00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:01.460]   that's where the party is.
[00:46:01.460 --> 00:46:03.460]   Whoever's friends' parents were out of town,
[00:46:03.460 --> 00:46:05.660]   that's the house where the party is, right?
[00:46:05.660 --> 00:46:07.340]   My parents were never in town.
[00:46:07.340 --> 00:46:09.560]   So my house was always where the party was.
[00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:13.100]   And it was very challenging to stay focused on school
[00:46:13.100 --> 00:46:16.060]   when I'm already making more than my teachers.
[00:46:16.060 --> 00:46:18.500]   And everyone's coming over to hang out.
[00:46:18.500 --> 00:46:19.820]   And then I'm supposed to get up early
[00:46:19.820 --> 00:46:21.060]   and drive to high school.
[00:46:21.060 --> 00:46:25.260]   But I did, mostly because of how important my parents,
[00:46:25.260 --> 00:46:27.700]   how much they valued education.
[00:46:27.700 --> 00:46:30.860]   My mom was a teacher at a junior college at the time.
[00:46:30.860 --> 00:46:33.220]   And so I knew they'd be really disappointed
[00:46:33.220 --> 00:46:35.340]   if I just left.
[00:46:35.340 --> 00:46:37.140]   - So finishing high school was like a very.
[00:46:37.140 --> 00:46:38.380]   - Well, yeah, it was important, yeah.
[00:46:38.380 --> 00:46:40.420]   - And then did you keep saving
[00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:42.820]   or was the house the kind of saving grace?
[00:46:42.820 --> 00:46:44.180]   - The house was saving grace.
[00:46:44.180 --> 00:46:45.780]   Well, I got in kind of over my head.
[00:46:45.780 --> 00:46:49.180]   So a few years later, I bought another property.
[00:46:49.180 --> 00:46:50.940]   I built a bunch of big ramps on it.
[00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:55.340]   It was a four acre lot here in kind of East San Diego.
[00:46:55.340 --> 00:46:57.980]   And at some point, not long after that,
[00:46:57.980 --> 00:47:02.380]   my income started dropping by half, by half every month,
[00:47:02.380 --> 00:47:04.260]   because it was all royalty based.
[00:47:04.260 --> 00:47:06.940]   It was all based on items or products with my name on it.
[00:47:06.940 --> 00:47:09.380]   Skating was taking a downturn in popularity.
[00:47:09.380 --> 00:47:11.540]   So suddenly skating is not popular.
[00:47:11.540 --> 00:47:13.180]   My name's not popular.
[00:47:13.180 --> 00:47:14.820]   My products aren't selling.
[00:47:14.820 --> 00:47:16.700]   And I'm stuck with two mortgages,
[00:47:16.700 --> 00:47:18.460]   my first child on the way.
[00:47:18.460 --> 00:47:20.700]   And it was like, how did I get here?
[00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:21.740]   This is crazy.
[00:47:21.740 --> 00:47:26.140]   So I sold my house for basically,
[00:47:26.140 --> 00:47:28.940]   I'd taken equity out of it to start a skate company,
[00:47:28.940 --> 00:47:31.940]   which seems like not the smartest move at a time
[00:47:31.940 --> 00:47:32.940]   when your income's dropping,
[00:47:32.940 --> 00:47:34.460]   but I wanted to stay in the industry.
[00:47:34.460 --> 00:47:36.260]   And I wanted to, at that point,
[00:47:36.260 --> 00:47:38.020]   have more control over a brand,
[00:47:38.020 --> 00:47:40.540]   because up to then I had been skating
[00:47:40.540 --> 00:47:43.060]   for the same sponsor for 10 years.
[00:47:43.060 --> 00:47:46.220]   And their popularity was waning, so was skateboarding.
[00:47:46.220 --> 00:47:47.780]   And I thought, well, I could probably just start a brand
[00:47:47.780 --> 00:47:48.660]   and be behind the scenes,
[00:47:48.660 --> 00:47:52.020]   because it seems like now my career as a skater
[00:47:52.020 --> 00:47:54.740]   is starting to fall apart.
[00:47:54.740 --> 00:47:56.300]   I could at the very least be effective
[00:47:56.300 --> 00:48:01.300]   as sort of a team manager, curator, marketer.
[00:48:01.300 --> 00:48:04.300]   And so I took the equity out of my house,
[00:48:04.300 --> 00:48:05.980]   started Birdhouse Skateboards,
[00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:08.100]   sold the house for what I owed on it,
[00:48:08.100 --> 00:48:10.820]   then moved back into the house I was living at
[00:48:10.820 --> 00:48:11.740]   as a senior in high school.
[00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:15.620]   And for probably three to four years,
[00:48:15.620 --> 00:48:19.140]   lived off of Top Ramen, peanut butter and jelly sandwiches,
[00:48:19.140 --> 00:48:21.220]   Taco Bell, and just made it work.
[00:48:21.220 --> 00:48:23.380]   And those were the years when I started
[00:48:23.380 --> 00:48:27.860]   to have to travel to make ends meet, like Japan,
[00:48:27.860 --> 00:48:29.860]   and bring my son along.
[00:48:29.860 --> 00:48:30.700]   You know what I mean?
[00:48:30.700 --> 00:48:32.260]   That's how that all unraveled.
[00:48:32.260 --> 00:48:34.180]   - There wasn't childcare at home to help out,
[00:48:34.180 --> 00:48:37.420]   because if you're eating Top Ramen, it's tough.
[00:48:37.420 --> 00:48:39.500]   So how did that evolve?
[00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:42.140]   Now are you much more passionate or interested
[00:48:42.140 --> 00:48:43.820]   about money and saving and all of that?
[00:48:43.820 --> 00:48:48.820]   - I think I have much more respect for saving money
[00:48:48.820 --> 00:48:50.820]   and for making sure everyone's taken care of,
[00:48:50.820 --> 00:48:51.820]   especially with our kids.
[00:48:51.820 --> 00:48:53.620]   I want them to all forge their own way, for sure.
[00:48:53.620 --> 00:48:56.140]   But at the same time, we want to be able to know
[00:48:56.140 --> 00:48:58.980]   that we have a nest egg in case something goes south.
[00:48:58.980 --> 00:49:01.860]   So my relationship is just that I have much more reverence
[00:49:01.860 --> 00:49:03.100]   and respect for it.
[00:49:03.100 --> 00:49:08.100]   And that I also don't take every single opportunity.
[00:49:08.100 --> 00:49:10.980]   That's the reason why I had so many relationships
[00:49:10.980 --> 00:49:13.780]   fall apart too, 'cause I just kept chasing the carrot.
[00:49:13.780 --> 00:49:14.940]   Even when it was huge.
[00:49:14.940 --> 00:49:17.740]   Even when I didn't need to at all.
[00:49:17.740 --> 00:49:18.580]   I just kept going.
[00:49:18.580 --> 00:49:20.660]   It was like, I couldn't turn it off.
[00:49:20.660 --> 00:49:22.540]   And then at some point I realized,
[00:49:22.540 --> 00:49:25.100]   I'm missing my kids' formative years,
[00:49:25.100 --> 00:49:27.700]   chasing some dream that I've already realized.
[00:49:27.700 --> 00:49:30.100]   - Yeah, I think at a different scale,
[00:49:30.100 --> 00:49:31.900]   it's something that we all face.
[00:49:31.900 --> 00:49:33.460]   It's like, you have kids and you're like,
[00:49:33.460 --> 00:49:35.260]   I can't go to the thing, I can't go to the thing.
[00:49:35.260 --> 00:49:37.780]   And I think if you pause and reflect for a moment,
[00:49:37.780 --> 00:49:39.900]   you're like, but it's okay.
[00:49:39.900 --> 00:49:41.500]   But it's so hard to process.
[00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:43.780]   And FOMO is definitely real,
[00:49:43.780 --> 00:49:46.500]   but if there's one thing that your kids can teach you,
[00:49:46.500 --> 00:49:47.580]   even when they're really young,
[00:49:47.580 --> 00:49:50.220]   it's like, you can miss the thing.
[00:49:50.220 --> 00:49:51.060]   Like, it's okay.
[00:49:51.060 --> 00:49:52.020]   - Oh yeah, it's okay.
[00:49:52.020 --> 00:49:55.420]   And also, if you really devote yourself
[00:49:55.420 --> 00:49:57.420]   to that time with your kids,
[00:49:57.420 --> 00:49:59.700]   you just see the gleam in their eye.
[00:49:59.700 --> 00:50:02.420]   And you see that they appreciate it.
[00:50:02.420 --> 00:50:03.820]   They're not gonna speak it to you.
[00:50:03.820 --> 00:50:05.820]   Good luck getting your kids to say thank you,
[00:50:05.820 --> 00:50:06.660]   by the way, for anything.
[00:50:06.660 --> 00:50:07.780]   But they do appreciate it.
[00:50:07.780 --> 00:50:09.300]   And they thrive because of it.
[00:50:09.300 --> 00:50:12.180]   But I think it was just that I had gotten so used
[00:50:12.180 --> 00:50:16.780]   to the hustle of not being successful and all the time,
[00:50:16.780 --> 00:50:17.940]   trying to create something,
[00:50:17.940 --> 00:50:19.380]   trying to make something happen,
[00:50:19.380 --> 00:50:22.620]   that when it started to happen in droves,
[00:50:22.620 --> 00:50:24.500]   how could I let it go?
[00:50:24.500 --> 00:50:25.740]   That seems crazy.
[00:50:25.740 --> 00:50:26.580]   That's impossible.
[00:50:26.580 --> 00:50:28.100]   Why would I not do that?
[00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:30.220]   And at some point I lost myself in it.
[00:50:30.220 --> 00:50:32.420]   - Is there something that you wish you'd known
[00:50:32.420 --> 00:50:34.860]   or you'd wish someone had told you
[00:50:34.860 --> 00:50:36.740]   that could have gotten you out of that earlier?
[00:50:36.740 --> 00:50:37.580]   - I don't think so.
[00:50:37.580 --> 00:50:40.980]   I think it was all so new and fantastical to me
[00:50:40.980 --> 00:50:43.420]   that I don't think I was gonna listen to a voice of reason.
[00:50:43.420 --> 00:50:44.620]   You know what I mean?
[00:50:44.620 --> 00:50:46.660]   - And so now you've got plenty of things
[00:50:46.660 --> 00:50:47.500]   that could keep you busy.
[00:50:47.500 --> 00:50:48.460]   What's the focus now?
[00:50:48.460 --> 00:50:49.540]   I mean, you're still skating,
[00:50:49.540 --> 00:50:51.820]   or you will probably after you heal.
[00:50:51.820 --> 00:50:56.100]   - Now I'm just so thankful to still be in the scene
[00:50:56.100 --> 00:50:58.460]   and to be able to bear witness
[00:50:58.460 --> 00:51:01.620]   to skateboarding's massive acceptance.
[00:51:01.620 --> 00:51:02.540]   I don't wanna say growth.
[00:51:02.540 --> 00:51:04.340]   I mean, it definitely has grown hugely
[00:51:04.340 --> 00:51:06.060]   in the last five or 10 years.
[00:51:06.060 --> 00:51:10.780]   But just to see it come of age and to be an activity,
[00:51:10.780 --> 00:51:13.660]   a sport, a lifestyle that is all inclusive,
[00:51:13.660 --> 00:51:17.780]   that is super diverse, that is now an Olympic sport.
[00:51:17.780 --> 00:51:21.940]   It's something that transcends boundaries,
[00:51:21.940 --> 00:51:25.900]   cultures, economics, people that get together to skate.
[00:51:25.900 --> 00:51:26.740]   They don't care where you're from.
[00:51:26.740 --> 00:51:28.180]   They just care how you skate.
[00:51:28.180 --> 00:51:29.340]   And it's low cost of entry.
[00:51:29.340 --> 00:51:31.900]   And so to see it come this far
[00:51:31.900 --> 00:51:33.660]   and to still be considered relevant,
[00:51:33.660 --> 00:51:34.780]   that's the greatest joy I have.
[00:51:34.780 --> 00:51:36.740]   So what am I doing?
[00:51:36.740 --> 00:51:40.100]   I'm doing whatever I can to still be an advocate for skating
[00:51:40.100 --> 00:51:42.220]   and to be able to skate myself
[00:51:42.220 --> 00:51:44.780]   because that still is the most fun for me.
[00:51:44.780 --> 00:51:46.260]   But kind of whatever comes along.
[00:51:46.260 --> 00:51:48.940]   And like I said, I do a lot of speaking gigs now,
[00:51:48.940 --> 00:51:51.740]   which I never imagined would be a way of living
[00:51:51.740 --> 00:51:52.780]   or a source of income.
[00:51:52.780 --> 00:51:54.740]   I say it all the time because when I go to these things,
[00:51:54.740 --> 00:51:55.580]   it's just like, look,
[00:51:55.580 --> 00:51:57.180]   I never imagined anyone would pay me to skate.
[00:51:57.180 --> 00:51:59.100]   So I certainly never imagined that people would pay me
[00:51:59.100 --> 00:52:01.900]   to talk about skateboarding, but here we are.
[00:52:01.900 --> 00:52:02.980]   And it's a blast.
[00:52:02.980 --> 00:52:03.820]   I love it.
[00:52:03.820 --> 00:52:06.020]   - What's the advice to someone who's passionate
[00:52:06.020 --> 00:52:09.780]   about a thing that's not necessarily a revenue source
[00:52:09.780 --> 00:52:10.780]   for their life right now?
[00:52:10.780 --> 00:52:13.500]   - It's what's gonna bring you the most joy.
[00:52:13.500 --> 00:52:14.340]   And it's worth it.
[00:52:14.340 --> 00:52:18.180]   If you go to work and your work makes you happy,
[00:52:18.180 --> 00:52:20.900]   that's living the dream at any level.
[00:52:20.900 --> 00:52:23.980]   And if it's very successful financially, great.
[00:52:23.980 --> 00:52:25.260]   That's just sort of gravy,
[00:52:25.260 --> 00:52:27.540]   but it's more about your peace of mind.
[00:52:27.540 --> 00:52:28.660]   And I think that if there is something
[00:52:28.660 --> 00:52:29.980]   that makes you truly happy
[00:52:29.980 --> 00:52:32.100]   and maybe you have to do something else
[00:52:32.100 --> 00:52:33.300]   to supplement your income,
[00:52:33.300 --> 00:52:35.500]   try to balance those things as best you can.
[00:52:35.500 --> 00:52:37.700]   - I've actually turned my position on this
[00:52:37.700 --> 00:52:38.940]   in the past few years.
[00:52:38.940 --> 00:52:40.660]   I used to say, oh, go follow your passion,
[00:52:40.660 --> 00:52:42.340]   find a way to make that your job.
[00:52:42.340 --> 00:52:43.940]   But if you have a job that allows you
[00:52:43.940 --> 00:52:46.660]   to follow your passion, not as a job, that's okay.
[00:52:46.660 --> 00:52:47.580]   - Yeah, that's enough.
[00:52:47.580 --> 00:52:50.060]   - My brother-in-law went pro golfing
[00:52:50.060 --> 00:52:52.140]   and then hated it because it was his job.
[00:52:52.140 --> 00:52:55.580]   And then got a job and just golfs on the weekend
[00:52:55.580 --> 00:52:56.660]   and loves it.
[00:52:56.660 --> 00:52:58.220]   And so I think for some people,
[00:52:58.220 --> 00:53:00.740]   even pursuing it to some extent can actually take away.
[00:53:00.740 --> 00:53:02.060]   I don't know if there was ever a moment in your career
[00:53:02.060 --> 00:53:05.060]   where it was like skating to win competitions
[00:53:05.060 --> 00:53:06.580]   and to win trophies was just too much
[00:53:06.580 --> 00:53:07.460]   and it took away the fun.
[00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:08.300]   - Yeah, for sure.
[00:53:08.300 --> 00:53:09.780]   Especially in the late eighties,
[00:53:09.780 --> 00:53:12.420]   I became a machine and it was very cyclical.
[00:53:12.420 --> 00:53:13.780]   And it was like, all right,
[00:53:13.780 --> 00:53:16.140]   there's an event coming up next weekend.
[00:53:16.140 --> 00:53:18.420]   I've got to learn a couple of new tricks for the event
[00:53:18.420 --> 00:53:21.580]   because the judges saw my current roster of tricks.
[00:53:21.580 --> 00:53:23.580]   So I got to hide it from them
[00:53:23.580 --> 00:53:26.220]   and then unleash it in the finals.
[00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:29.700]   But it became so formulaic that it really was not fun.
[00:53:29.700 --> 00:53:31.340]   And at some point I just pulled away
[00:53:31.340 --> 00:53:32.660]   and stepped away from it altogether
[00:53:32.660 --> 00:53:36.220]   because skating had become a job and it wasn't fun for me.
[00:53:36.220 --> 00:53:37.700]   And when I did pull away,
[00:53:37.700 --> 00:53:39.780]   I got very creative with my skating
[00:53:39.780 --> 00:53:42.580]   and I was able to really learn a lot of different techniques
[00:53:42.580 --> 00:53:44.820]   and a lot of stuff that I wanted to pursue,
[00:53:44.820 --> 00:53:47.860]   even though I wasn't making a living at it at the time.
[00:53:47.860 --> 00:53:48.780]   I mean, I kind of was,
[00:53:48.780 --> 00:53:50.860]   I still had signature skateboards and whatnot,
[00:53:50.860 --> 00:53:52.820]   but when you're not in those years,
[00:53:52.820 --> 00:53:54.780]   if you were not competing actively,
[00:53:54.780 --> 00:53:56.740]   you were not going to get coverage.
[00:53:56.740 --> 00:54:00.500]   You were not going to get career opportunities,
[00:54:00.500 --> 00:54:01.900]   but I was willing to let those go
[00:54:01.900 --> 00:54:04.260]   to just at least be happy with it.
[00:54:04.260 --> 00:54:07.660]   And so it gave me this sort of new energy
[00:54:07.660 --> 00:54:08.980]   to come back to competing
[00:54:08.980 --> 00:54:12.580]   and with a different approach that was less careful
[00:54:12.580 --> 00:54:16.300]   and it was more risky.
[00:54:16.300 --> 00:54:17.140]   That was it.
[00:54:17.140 --> 00:54:18.100]   I came at it with a sense of,
[00:54:18.100 --> 00:54:19.860]   I'm going to just try everything.
[00:54:19.860 --> 00:54:21.580]   If it doesn't work, it doesn't work.
[00:54:21.580 --> 00:54:25.060]   I don't care if my competitive record
[00:54:25.060 --> 00:54:26.820]   is so pristine anymore.
[00:54:26.820 --> 00:54:28.700]   I'd rather just do this and take the chances
[00:54:28.700 --> 00:54:29.620]   and have fun doing it.
[00:54:29.620 --> 00:54:32.820]   And if it works, then it's going to work awesomely.
[00:54:32.820 --> 00:54:35.340]   The downside to that was that
[00:54:35.340 --> 00:54:37.300]   when I did come back to competing,
[00:54:37.300 --> 00:54:40.260]   it was when skateboarding was starting to take a downturn.
[00:54:40.260 --> 00:54:42.340]   So I came back with this renewed energy
[00:54:42.340 --> 00:54:43.980]   and I was winning a lot of big events.
[00:54:43.980 --> 00:54:46.260]   And all of a sudden it was like, what happened?
[00:54:46.260 --> 00:54:47.660]   Where's the crowd?
[00:54:47.660 --> 00:54:48.860]   Where's the contest?
[00:54:48.860 --> 00:54:49.700]   - Where's the prize money?
[00:54:49.700 --> 00:54:51.900]   - You guys like, turn the machines back on.
[00:54:51.900 --> 00:54:53.300]   I thought this was cool.
[00:54:53.300 --> 00:54:56.140]   It was kind of like the wrong place at the right time.
[00:54:56.140 --> 00:54:58.020]   - But you probably wouldn't have had the career
[00:54:58.020 --> 00:55:00.700]   you had after that had that not happened.
[00:55:00.700 --> 00:55:01.540]   - No, no.
[00:55:01.540 --> 00:55:03.940]   Because in those dead years,
[00:55:03.940 --> 00:55:07.340]   I was skating more than ever, having fun doing it.
[00:55:07.340 --> 00:55:09.220]   You know, learning new tricks and learning new techniques.
[00:55:09.220 --> 00:55:11.060]   It was just that I wasn't doing it in front of crowds
[00:55:11.060 --> 00:55:14.340]   'cause the crowds weren't there anymore.
[00:55:14.340 --> 00:55:15.540]   - I think I'm very fortunate.
[00:55:15.540 --> 00:55:17.340]   And I think you did the same with your podcast.
[00:55:17.340 --> 00:55:19.140]   Like when you start a podcast,
[00:55:19.140 --> 00:55:21.260]   if you can start it not needing to be
[00:55:21.260 --> 00:55:22.500]   your job and your business,
[00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:23.780]   you could do whatever you want with it.
[00:55:23.780 --> 00:55:24.620]   When I started it,
[00:55:24.620 --> 00:55:26.700]   I never thought I'd be going over countries as episodes.
[00:55:26.700 --> 00:55:27.740]   And then I was like, you know what?
[00:55:27.740 --> 00:55:28.580]   I'm going to London.
[00:55:28.580 --> 00:55:30.140]   I want to talk to someone who knows everything about London.
[00:55:30.140 --> 00:55:31.140]   Let's make an episode about London.
[00:55:31.140 --> 00:55:32.380]   And then we do it on Japan.
[00:55:32.380 --> 00:55:35.980]   So I think when you really start to do
[00:55:35.980 --> 00:55:38.780]   what you're passionate about in your work,
[00:55:38.780 --> 00:55:40.500]   it sometimes creates an even better experience.
[00:55:40.500 --> 00:55:41.660]   And people love these episodes.
[00:55:41.660 --> 00:55:42.700]   And I never had an idea.
[00:55:42.700 --> 00:55:43.540]   - Oh yeah.
[00:55:43.540 --> 00:55:44.620]   My co-host, Jason Ellis and I,
[00:55:44.620 --> 00:55:46.380]   we have a lot of experience, obviously skating,
[00:55:46.380 --> 00:55:47.700]   but just life experience.
[00:55:47.700 --> 00:55:50.060]   He had a totally different path than I did.
[00:55:50.060 --> 00:55:53.500]   And when we have guests, especially with non-skating guests,
[00:55:53.500 --> 00:55:56.180]   we relate to them in different ways
[00:55:56.180 --> 00:55:57.380]   that people would not expect,
[00:55:57.380 --> 00:55:59.260]   but in a very parallel way.
[00:55:59.260 --> 00:56:01.260]   For instance, we had two wrestlers on,
[00:56:01.260 --> 00:56:02.500]   that's our most recent guest,
[00:56:02.500 --> 00:56:05.220]   and Darby Allen and Jamie Hader.
[00:56:05.220 --> 00:56:06.900]   And people were like, why would you have them on?
[00:56:06.900 --> 00:56:08.700]   And then when we started to talk about our experiences
[00:56:08.700 --> 00:56:11.380]   and our injuries, we were right in line
[00:56:11.380 --> 00:56:12.700]   and we were bouncing off of each other.
[00:56:12.700 --> 00:56:14.460]   And it was a really great conversation.
[00:56:14.460 --> 00:56:15.340]   It was fascinating.
[00:56:15.340 --> 00:56:17.140]   Say what you will about wrestling
[00:56:17.140 --> 00:56:18.980]   or that it's made up or whatever.
[00:56:18.980 --> 00:56:23.980]   Those guys take as much abuse as skateboarders.
[00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:25.220]   - I listened to this episode.
[00:56:25.220 --> 00:56:26.060]   It was wild.
[00:56:26.060 --> 00:56:27.060]   I don't think I've gotten that
[00:56:27.060 --> 00:56:28.780]   behind the scenes look at wrestling.
[00:56:28.780 --> 00:56:29.820]   It hasn't been a passion of mine,
[00:56:29.820 --> 00:56:31.500]   but it was super fascinating.
[00:56:31.500 --> 00:56:32.940]   And you don't have to say who,
[00:56:32.940 --> 00:56:34.780]   but I know there's some cool guests coming down the pike.
[00:56:34.780 --> 00:56:37.100]   So if anyone's listening and wants to check it out.
[00:56:37.100 --> 00:56:39.780]   - We have an insane roster coming up
[00:56:39.780 --> 00:56:41.820]   and I feel like now we're starting to hit our stride
[00:56:41.820 --> 00:56:42.940]   and we've been doing it a couple of years.
[00:56:42.940 --> 00:56:45.980]   So you're right, it wasn't something that we needed,
[00:56:45.980 --> 00:56:47.180]   but we enjoy doing it.
[00:56:47.180 --> 00:56:50.380]   And we did find that we had something unique to offer.
[00:56:50.380 --> 00:56:52.700]   We found a groove, we found an audience.
[00:56:52.700 --> 00:56:55.580]   It was just that we weren't doing all the right things
[00:56:55.580 --> 00:56:57.380]   with the algorithms and the promotions.
[00:56:57.380 --> 00:57:00.140]   And so now we have a group, Amalka,
[00:57:00.140 --> 00:57:01.780]   that is taking the reins on that
[00:57:01.780 --> 00:57:02.860]   and they've been doing a great job.
[00:57:02.860 --> 00:57:05.980]   So we get to focus more on the content.
[00:57:05.980 --> 00:57:07.540]   - Podcast is great, I enjoy it,
[00:57:07.540 --> 00:57:09.900]   especially 'cause I have my childhood skate dreams
[00:57:09.900 --> 00:57:11.460]   still somewhere buried in my head.
[00:57:11.460 --> 00:57:13.580]   For anyone else listening, where else do you want to send them
[00:57:13.580 --> 00:57:15.540]   to keep on top of whatever you're doing?
[00:57:15.540 --> 00:57:17.420]   - Well, I'm out there on all the social media
[00:57:17.420 --> 00:57:20.020]   as Tony Hawk, luckily.
[00:57:20.020 --> 00:57:22.820]   I think I had to buy one of someone squatted my name
[00:57:22.820 --> 00:57:25.100]   on some platform early on.
[00:57:25.100 --> 00:57:26.540]   So I'm Tony Hawk on all the social media
[00:57:26.540 --> 00:57:29.180]   and that's where I put all of my content out there.
[00:57:29.180 --> 00:57:31.060]   We have the Hawk versus Wolf podcast.
[00:57:31.060 --> 00:57:34.500]   I think if anything, my energy also is directed
[00:57:34.500 --> 00:57:36.100]   towards the skate park project,
[00:57:36.100 --> 00:57:38.220]   which is my foundation for public skate parks
[00:57:38.220 --> 00:57:39.500]   in underserved areas.
[00:57:39.500 --> 00:57:42.420]   We have been doing it over 20 years now.
[00:57:42.420 --> 00:57:45.540]   We've helped to fund over a thousand skate parks
[00:57:45.540 --> 00:57:46.500]   in the US alone.
[00:57:46.500 --> 00:57:48.780]   We have a couple of international projects as well.
[00:57:48.780 --> 00:57:49.820]   I think that's my proudest work
[00:57:49.820 --> 00:57:52.780]   because when I was growing up skating,
[00:57:52.780 --> 00:57:54.220]   the skate park was my salvation.
[00:57:54.220 --> 00:57:56.820]   I was an outcast kid, I was bullied at school,
[00:57:56.820 --> 00:57:59.700]   but I found my tribe and my community at the skate park.
[00:57:59.700 --> 00:58:02.300]   And I was very lucky that the park
[00:58:02.300 --> 00:58:04.620]   that I grew up skating at was one of the last ones
[00:58:04.620 --> 00:58:07.140]   in the US in the mid eighties.
[00:58:07.140 --> 00:58:08.860]   There were only a handful.
[00:58:08.860 --> 00:58:11.180]   And that was never lost on me how lucky I was
[00:58:11.180 --> 00:58:14.380]   to have that place to go and to have that crew.
[00:58:14.380 --> 00:58:17.740]   So when I was in a position to advocate
[00:58:17.740 --> 00:58:19.940]   and to possibly affect change,
[00:58:19.940 --> 00:58:22.780]   that's what I focused in on was public skate parks.
[00:58:22.780 --> 00:58:25.740]   - I grew up kind of at the born in the early eighties.
[00:58:25.740 --> 00:58:28.380]   I was in that kind of dearth of lack of skate parks.
[00:58:28.380 --> 00:58:29.220]   - Lack of skate parks, yeah.
[00:58:29.220 --> 00:58:30.780]   - And I think my community was like the guy
[00:58:30.780 --> 00:58:32.420]   that lived across the street that had a skateboard.
[00:58:32.420 --> 00:58:34.140]   That was it, it was the two of us.
[00:58:34.140 --> 00:58:37.380]   - And also that these kids that they find something
[00:58:37.380 --> 00:58:39.340]   they love, they maybe live in an area
[00:58:39.340 --> 00:58:40.860]   where there's not much opportunity.
[00:58:40.860 --> 00:58:43.020]   They find something they love and they're mostly told
[00:58:43.020 --> 00:58:46.100]   that they can't do it 'cause they're trespassing
[00:58:46.100 --> 00:58:47.420]   or they're a nuisance.
[00:58:47.420 --> 00:58:49.100]   - They put things to prevent you from doing it.
[00:58:49.100 --> 00:58:50.020]   - Right, or they're a nuisance.
[00:58:50.020 --> 00:58:52.980]   This kid has finally found something that speaks to them.
[00:58:52.980 --> 00:58:55.060]   And now you're discouraging them from that.
[00:58:55.060 --> 00:58:56.940]   What are you doing to your community?
[00:58:56.940 --> 00:59:01.940]   So to have those parks, the kids feel like they matter
[00:59:01.940 --> 00:59:04.500]   and that they can find their crew.
[00:59:04.500 --> 00:59:06.020]   I think the best part about the foundations,
[00:59:06.020 --> 00:59:09.340]   we try to empower groups that are already doing it themselves
[00:59:09.340 --> 00:59:10.660]   or trying to do it themselves.
[00:59:10.660 --> 00:59:11.980]   Like they're trying to fundraise
[00:59:11.980 --> 00:59:13.380]   or they're going to city council meetings
[00:59:13.380 --> 00:59:14.940]   or they're petitioning.
[00:59:14.940 --> 00:59:17.540]   All those things matter.
[00:59:17.540 --> 00:59:20.540]   And it feels like you're in an uphill battle
[00:59:20.540 --> 00:59:25.020]   that will never end, especially with the red tape
[00:59:25.020 --> 00:59:27.520]   and the bureaucracy and city councils.
[00:59:27.520 --> 00:59:30.740]   But we give them the roadmap to do it the right way.
[00:59:30.740 --> 00:59:33.980]   And when we do give them our endorsement
[00:59:33.980 --> 00:59:37.040]   and possibly funding, that's usually the tipping point
[00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:39.020]   for them to get it approved officially.
[00:59:39.020 --> 00:59:42.420]   And so for us, it's empowering those go-getters
[00:59:42.420 --> 00:59:44.740]   that were trying to do it in the first place.
[00:59:44.740 --> 00:59:45.580]   - I love it.
[00:59:45.580 --> 00:59:47.500]   So you should all definitely check out the podcast
[00:59:47.500 --> 00:59:48.340]   and the socials,
[00:59:48.340 --> 00:59:50.340]   but definitely check out the skate park project.
[00:59:50.340 --> 00:59:54.020]   I wish that it was around 30 something years ago for me.
[00:59:54.020 --> 00:59:55.300]   It would have been awesome.
[00:59:55.300 --> 00:59:58.860]   Any parting advice for anyone who's looks at you and says,
[00:59:58.860 --> 00:59:59.980]   gosh, when I'm in my fifties,
[00:59:59.980 --> 01:00:01.980]   I want to be doing the thing I love
[01:00:01.980 --> 01:00:03.740]   and performing at that level.
[01:00:03.740 --> 01:00:05.060]   - Wow, what can I say?
[01:00:05.060 --> 01:00:08.840]   My approach always has been to keep improving what I do.
[01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:11.780]   And at my age, that's shifted a bit
[01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:15.140]   from trying to do these big spins and these big stunts
[01:00:15.140 --> 01:00:17.540]   to more subtle techniques,
[01:00:17.540 --> 01:00:19.540]   but something that I feel like is progressive.
[01:00:19.540 --> 01:00:21.900]   And I'm talking about just in terms of physical skating,
[01:00:21.900 --> 01:00:23.900]   but also just my approach to life is like
[01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:25.300]   to not wrestle my accolades,
[01:00:25.300 --> 01:00:29.240]   to keep trying to improve what I do, keep evolving,
[01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:32.620]   listen to other input and glean what you can from them,
[01:00:32.620 --> 01:00:35.140]   glean what is appropriate to what you do.
[01:00:35.140 --> 01:00:37.860]   I'm fascinated listening to people who are passionate
[01:00:37.860 --> 01:00:40.320]   about what they do, whether they're successful or not,
[01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:43.520]   just to hear what drives them.
[01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:47.100]   And a lot of times you can translate that to what you do.
[01:00:47.100 --> 01:00:49.380]   - Is there a favorite way you consume these stories,
[01:00:49.380 --> 01:00:51.020]   podcasts you like, books you like?
[01:00:51.020 --> 01:00:52.980]   - For these days, it's actually doing my own podcast
[01:00:52.980 --> 01:00:54.980]   'cause I like to invite people that I think are fascinating
[01:00:54.980 --> 01:00:56.320]   and really get into their story.
[01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:59.140]   Like we interviewed this girl who's a,
[01:00:59.140 --> 01:01:00.980]   she's the most decorated Paralympian now.
[01:01:00.980 --> 01:01:02.380]   Her name's Oksana Masters,
[01:01:02.380 --> 01:01:06.260]   who grew up in a Ukrainian orphanage after Chernobyl
[01:01:06.260 --> 01:01:08.260]   and who was disfigured from Chernobyl,
[01:01:08.260 --> 01:01:10.380]   who came to the US, she got adopted.
[01:01:10.380 --> 01:01:13.480]   And her story is incredible.
[01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:14.400]   - And so inspiring.
[01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:15.820]   I already knew a little bit of it,
[01:01:15.820 --> 01:01:17.180]   but to invite her on our podcast
[01:01:17.180 --> 01:01:19.100]   and hear all of it was fascinating.
[01:01:19.100 --> 01:01:20.260]   - I have not listened to that.
[01:01:20.260 --> 01:01:22.260]   So that's my homework for the flight home today.
[01:01:22.260 --> 01:01:24.940]   Thank you so much for being here or for having me here.
[01:01:24.940 --> 01:01:27.060]   - Oh yeah, thanks, this is my home away from home.
[01:01:27.060 --> 01:01:27.900]   - I love it.
[01:01:27.900 --> 01:01:29.220]   (upbeat music)
[01:01:29.220 --> 01:01:31.260]   Wow, that episode was so much fun
[01:01:31.260 --> 01:01:33.420]   and I really hope you guys enjoyed it.
[01:01:33.420 --> 01:01:35.780]   Big thanks to Tony for hosting me in his space
[01:01:35.780 --> 01:01:37.620]   and to all of you for listening.
[01:01:37.620 --> 01:01:39.820]   I'll be doing another Q&A episode soon.
[01:01:39.820 --> 01:01:41.700]   So please send over your questions,
[01:01:41.700 --> 01:01:44.580]   but also any awesome wins you have to share
[01:01:44.580 --> 01:01:47.900]   or hacks you've learned and put to use in your own life.
[01:01:47.900 --> 01:01:50.540]   And finally, I am about 100 ratings shy
[01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:52.220]   of hitting my goal from last year
[01:01:52.220 --> 01:01:55.540]   of getting to a thousand reviews on Apple Podcasts.
[01:01:55.540 --> 01:01:57.340]   So if you haven't left one yet,
[01:01:57.340 --> 01:01:59.060]   I would greatly appreciate it.
[01:01:59.060 --> 01:02:00.740]   It would mean so much to me.
[01:02:00.740 --> 01:02:02.460]   All right, that's it for this week.
[01:02:02.460 --> 01:02:03.380]   See you next week.
[01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:06.180]   (upbeat music)
[01:02:06.180 --> 01:02:08.760]   (upbeat music)
