[00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:09.600]   Man, just got to the hotel after a long flight out here to Brooklyn from Denver.
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.480]   Probably was like a four-hour flight, I want to say.
[00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:19.460]   But made it to the hotel, gonna chill tonight, gonna chill tonight and get to it tomorrow.
[00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:20.740]   Day one out here in Brooklyn.
[00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.160]   So we're gonna hit the white room, hit the court tomorrow morning, and finally see the
[00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.160]   facilities.
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.100]   I've heard some good things about the whole practice facility and everything, so I'm excited
[00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.100]   to see it.
[00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:37.200]   We're just gonna take it easy tonight, might get some dinner in the city, but man, just gonna
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.140]   try to adjust over the next couple weeks.
[00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:40.400]   So we'll see how it goes.
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:59.340]   The best part of what we got, parking lot over here.
[00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.340]   City.
[00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.280]   I'm just glad y'all got two courts, man.
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.440]   That's what Connor was telling me.
[00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.940]   Cause over there we had, we had the one court.
[00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.340]   Y'all always keep the windows up?
[00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.340]   As much as we can.
[00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.340]   When we start practice, sometimes the light from the sun is like too much.
[00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.280]   But this is, this is what everybody wants to see.
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.280]   Smooth though.
[00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.280]   You know, it's sweet.
[00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.280]   It's definitely, so that's all Manhattan right there, right?
[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:27.280]   Yeah, so Manhattan is right there, Brooklyn is over here, and then Jersey is on the other
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.280]   side.
[00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.280]   All them builders is Jersey?
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.280]   Yeah.
[00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.280]   And that's Manhattan and that's Brooklyn?
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.280]   Yeah.
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.280]   Good job.
[00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.280]   Jersey is sweet.
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.280]   What are they renovating?
[00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.220]   So there's a lot of stuff going on.
[00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.220]   I don't know what's happening over there, but I know in the players' suite, they got the,
[00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.220]   they're redoing our hot tubs, cold tubs, that whole space back there.
[00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.220]   This is smooth.
[00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:50.220]   I'm about to be in here.
[00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.220]   Yeah.
[00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:52.220]   All the time.
[00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.220]   Yeah.
[00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.220]   This is our flag.
[00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.220]   Jordy talks about it all the time.
[00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.220]   Really different when you're ready to connect yourself.
[00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.220]   It's the beginning of the year, everybody's signing.
[00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.220]   So, it's always with us on the road.
[00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.220]   It's always with us at home.
[00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.220]   It's always with us at Barclays.
[00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.220]   That's brilliant.
[00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.220]   Oh my God.
[00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.220]   What you up?
[00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.220]   What's up?
[00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.220]   Yeah.
[00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.220]   Spend a lot of time in here before you get there.
[00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.220]   Obviously, you'll be looking for holiday, but it's another part of what we've got here.
[00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:27.220]   So, on this side, there are more offices that lead to the hydro room that's in the back room.
[00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.220]   Okay.
[00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.220]   So, back there is where all the pools and stuff are going to place.
[00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:32.220]   Five 30 clips.
[00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.220]   Video room style.
[00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.220]   And then, just the locker room.
[00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.220]   Showers, bathrooms over here.
[00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.220]   You're trying to walk around.
[00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.220]   Lock the room right here.
[00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.220]   You got you in the middle.
[00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.220]   Man, that means something.
[00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:46.220]   No, it don't.
[00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:47.220]   That means something.
[00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.220]   Nah, that's cool.
[00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.220]   That's where we at.
[00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.220]   This is nice.
[00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.220]   Pretty spacious.
[00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.220]   Yeah.
[00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.220]   So, y'all never practice at Barclays?
[00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:56.220]   On game day.
[00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.220]   That's the only time we're really over there.
[00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.220]   Go and do a little shoot around?
[00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.220]   Yeah, we'll do a shoot around and walk.
[00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.220]   Last year, we did a shoot around and walk through.
[00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.220]   It was there.
[00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.220]   And then, we just stayed there.
[00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:05.220]   Smooth, man.
[00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.220]   Yeah.
[00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.220]   Yeah.
[00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.220]   You got the steam room right here.
[00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.220]   Little sauna type thing.
[00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.220]   Showers.
[00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.220]   These are our temporary cold tubs.
[00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.220]   Because in here, we're all the practice of hot tubs.
[00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.220]   Cold tubs, hot tubs.
[00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.220]   This is like, I didn't know how to describe it.
[00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.220]   It's like a little soft bath.
[00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.220]   You lay in the water and it keeps a little bit sour.
[00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.220]   Some of them.
[00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:29.220]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.220]   Whatever that shoot is called.
[00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.220]   It's that.
[00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:32.220]   Is there people being here?
[00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.220]   Yeah.
[00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.220]   People going here?
[00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.220]   All the time.
[00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.220]   That's the float tank.
[00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:37.220]   Yeah, exactly that.
[00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:38.220]   Exactly that.
[00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.220]   So, that's pretty dope.
[00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.220]   We made it, man.
[00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:44.220]   Friggin' stay in Brooklyn.
[00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.220]   How does it feel to be here?
[00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:47.220]   Excited.
[00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.220]   Got my first lift today.
[00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.220]   My first little court workout.
[00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.220]   You know what I mean?
[00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:53.220]   So, came here to grind.
[00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.220]   Gotta get better.
[00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:55.220]   Okay.
[00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.220]   We were doing the game, my egg lunch.
[00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.220]   We were doing over here.
[00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.220]   And then, back here is where we got all of our food.
[00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.220]   So, we got chefs every day.
[00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.220]   They cook us breakfast and lunch.
[00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:07.220]   It's great.
[00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:08.220]   The fridges are stocked.
[00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.220]   Whatever we need.
[00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.220]   And then, this is it.
[00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:13.220]   We're recovering.
[00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.220]   Get our fuel.
[00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.220]   That's it.
[00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:16.220]   So, yeah, it's us, man.
[00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:17.220]   Yeah, it's strange, bro.
[00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.220]   It's us in a nutshell.
[00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:19.220]   Cool, man.
[00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:20.220]   Appreciate the little tour.
[00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:21.220]   Most definitely.
[00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:22.220]   Man, we made it, man.
[00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.220]   First day in Brooklyn.
[00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.220]   I'm excited to get to it.
[00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.220]   About to get this work on the weight room.
[00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.220]   Then, take it to the court.
[00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.220]   Good little views from the locker room.
[00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.220]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.220]   So, let's do it.
[00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:38.220]   Starting off the day, man.
[00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.220]   Gotta get some good nutrition in me.
[00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.220]   Normally, I like to work out before I eat.
[00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.220]   But, who knows what these dudes gonna have me doing today.
[00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:47.220]   So, I'm gonna eat first.
[00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.220]   Got a little omelet.
[00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.220]   Some orange juice.
[00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:53.220]   Some oatmeal.
[00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:58.220]   A little hash brown.
[00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.220]   And a bagel.
[00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:02.220]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.220]   Bagel with cream cheese.
[00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.220]   I'm not even gonna lie.
[00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.220]   It's a whirlwind getting traded.
[00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:13.220]   Getting traded after figuring out, you know, the new facility.
[00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:14.220]   Your new space.
[00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.220]   How you get to the arena.
[00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.220]   All that little stuff, like, it takes a minute.
[00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:27.220]   It took me about three years to learn how to get from my crib to the Denver airport with no GPS.
[00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:31.220]   So, it's definitely gonna be a little adjustment period.
[00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.220]   They got a float tank.
[00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:35.220]   They got a...
[00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:36.220]   That float tank.
[00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.220]   That's something we didn't have in Denver.
[00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.220]   You basically just go and you float in the water.
[00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:44.220]   And there's so much salt in the water that you just get to float.
[00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:45.220]   And chill in there.
[00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:47.220]   So, I'm definitely gonna utilize that.
[00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:48.220]   Do some...
[00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:49.220]   Some prayer in there.
[00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:50.220]   Some meditation.
[00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:51.220]   Stuff like that.
[00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:54.220]   I didn't eat too much 'cause I still wanna be light.
[00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.220]   Feel good for my workout.
[00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:00.220]   So, that's what we're going right now.
[00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:01.220]   We're going to get this lift in, man.
[00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:02.220]   Let's get it.
[00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:03.220]   We're going to get this lift.
[00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:04.220]   We're going to get this lift.
[00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:05.220]   We're going to get this lift.
[00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:06.220]   We're going to get this lift.
[00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:07.220]   We're going to get this lift.
[00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:08.220]   We're going to get this lift.
[00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:09.220]   We're going to get this lift.
[00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:10.220]   We're going to get this lift.
[00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:11.220]   We're going to get this lift.
[00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:12.220]   We're going to get this lift.
[00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:13.220]   We're going to get this lift.
[00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:14.220]   We're going to get this lift.
[00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:15.220]   We're going to get this lift.
[00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:16.220]   We're going to get this lift.
[00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:17.220]   We're going to get this lift.
[00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:18.220]   We're going to get this lift.
[00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:19.220]   We're going to get this lift.
[00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:20.220]   We're going to get this lift.
[00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:21.220]   We're going to get this lift.
[00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:22.220]   We're going to get this lift.
[00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:23.220]   We're going to get this lift.
[00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:24.220]   We're going to get this lift.
[00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:25.220]   We're going to get this lift.
[00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:26.220]   We're going to get this lift.
[00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:27.220]   We're going to get this lift.

[00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:08.220]   And the good part about this place is it's 10 minutes from the arena.
[00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:13.220]   10 minutes from the practice corner.
[00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:16.220]   What you think of the city great?

[00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:01.220]   Walking around.
[00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:03.220]   Trying to see what's up with the city.
[00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:05.220]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:06.220]   Get the view.
[00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:14.220]   We're going to go to dinner in a minute, but decided to walk around and see what's up, man.
[00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:16.220]   Look at the view, Greg.
[00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:20.220]   Need a fit check, Greg.
[00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:21.220]   Fit check?
[00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:22.220]   Fit check.
[00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:23.220]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:25.220]   Got the Jumbo Jumbo Chanel on.
[00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:27.220]   Got this and Saint Tropez.
[00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:30.220]   You're not finding the Jumbo one like this anywhere.
[00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:31.220]   Nowhere else.
[00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:32.220]   Got the...
[00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:33.220]   Got the, uh...
[00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:34.220]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:36.220]   The Louie Kicks on.
[00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:37.220]   The Rick Owens pants.
[00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:38.220]   Poked out, Jones.
[00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:39.220]   Everything else in the Mia's.
[00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:40.220]   Mia's shirt.
[00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:41.220]   Mia's hat.
[00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:44.220]   Got the Pepsi Roley on.
[00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:46.220]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:48.220]   Had to throw a little bit of ice on.
[00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:50.220]   Nothing too crazy tonight for dinner, but...
[00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:51.220]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:52.220]   That's it.
[00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:53.220]   We out here in New York.
[00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:54.220]   First night out here.
[00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:55.220]   Just chilling.
[00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:56.220]   Just chilling.
[00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:58.220]   Capped the night off.
[00:12:58.220 --> 00:12:59.220]   With a good dinner, man.
[00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:01.220]   After a tough day in the lab.
[00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:03.220]   We pulled up to Tao.
[00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:04.220]   It's a nice little spot.
[00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:06.220]   It's my first time at this one.
[00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:07.220]   I've been to the LA one.
[00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:08.220]   And I've been to the Vegas one.
[00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:11.220]   See what the food's talking about.
[00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:14.220]   Good little ambiance.
[00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:15.220]   We just gonna kick it.
[00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:16.220]   Get some good food.
[00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:19.220]   And get ready for another day in the lab tomorrow.
[00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:21.220]   We got a couple appetizers, man.
[00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:24.220]   If you know me, you know I love some edamame.
[00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:26.220]   Some shishito peppers.
[00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:28.220]   Got a little mocktail.
[00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:30.220]   This joint right here is fire.
[00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:34.220]   Waiting on the main course.
[00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:37.220]   Man, here goes some of the main courses.
[00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:39.220]   We got a little sea bass right here on the skewer.
[00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:40.220]   Fire.
[00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:42.220]   Got the chicken wings.
[00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:43.220]   Some fried rice, man.
[00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:44.220]   Some orange chicken.
[00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:46.220]   We about to dig in.
[00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:48.220]   Good little meal to finish the day.
[00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:52.220]   Man, it's been a long but productive day.
[00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:53.220]   Got that working this morning.
[00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:56.220]   Then got to, you know, enjoy the city a little bit.
[00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:57.220]   Check out Brooklyn.
[00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:58.220]   Check out New York City.
[00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:00.220]   Got to tour a couple places.
[00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:01.220]   See where I wanna...
[00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:03.220]   See where I wanna live while I'm out here.
[00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:05.220]   Got some good food in me.
[00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:07.220]   And now we back in the room.
[00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:08.220]   About to get some rest.
[00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:11.220]   Probably about to find a little show on Netflix.
[00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:12.220]   And get me some sleep.
[00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:13.220]   Get ready for tomorrow.
[00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:16.220]   So, like I told y'all, I'm gonna be doing this little vlogging thing.
[00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:17.220]   I hope you liked it.
[00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:19.220]   I hope you enjoy watching.
[00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:20.220]   Curious Mike out, man.
[00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:21.000]   He's Mike out, man.
