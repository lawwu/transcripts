[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.200]   - Happy Friday everyone.
[00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.840]   Thanks for listening to the podcast.
[00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.720]   Well, for many of you, you know the kingdom
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.920]   is a big theme for Jesus.
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.040]   In the ESV translation, the kingdom language
[00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:20.040]   is mentioned 126 times in the gospels.
[00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.800]   But then kingdom is mentioned only 34 times
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.360]   in the rest of the New Testament,
[00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.520]   which prompts Christopher from the UK to write in.
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:28.880]   Hi, Pastor John, thank you very much
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.960]   for your excellent APJ podcast.
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.320]   I'm amazed you can put so much effort
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.300]   into such complex and difficult questions
[00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.560]   for complete strangers like me.
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.480]   My question for you is this.
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.740]   The gospel of Matthew alone is full of references
[00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.440]   to the coming kingdom, 55 of them in Matthew alone.
[00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.440]   But from Acts and into the epistles,
[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.360]   there seems to be very little mention of the kingdom.
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.880]   So what is the kingdom of God and is it the church
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.840]   or is it something larger than the church?
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.160]   So I hear two crucial questions.
[00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.200]   One is what is the kingdom of God?
[00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:08.920]   And the other is why does it get so much prominent,
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.780]   explicit focus in the teachings of Jesus,
[00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.960]   but far less prominent, explicit focus
[00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.880]   in the letters of the New Testament?
[00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.820]   So let me say a word about each of those questions.
[00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.760]   I think the most important thing I could say
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.880]   about the kingdom of God that would help people make sense
[00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.160]   out of all the uses is that the basic meaning
[00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:40.160]   of the word kingdom in the Bible is God's reign,
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:46.280]   R-E-I-G-N, not realm or people.
[00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:52.360]   The kingdom creates a realm, the kingdom creates a people,
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.680]   but it is not synonymous with its realm or its people.
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.520]   For example, consider Psalm 103, verse 19.
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.480]   The Lord has established his throne in the heavens
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:09.060]   and his kingdom rules over all.
[00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.040]   Now you can hear the basic meaning
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.920]   of the word kingdom as rule.
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.920]   It doesn't mean that his realm rules over his realm.
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.320]   It means that God's reign or rule governs all things.
[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:31.160]   He sits as king on his throne of the universe
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.360]   and his kingly rule, his kingdom,
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.200]   his reign governs all things.
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.720]   So the basic meaning of the word kingdom in the Bible
[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.720]   is God's kingly rule, his reign, his action,
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.120]   his lordship, his sovereign governance.
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.280]   And then you add this.
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.920]   Since God's purpose for the world is to save a people
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.920]   for himself and renew the world for that people,
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.880]   his kingly rule implies a saving
[00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.880]   and a redeeming activity on their behalf.
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.800]   This is why the coming of the kingdom in the New Testament
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.200]   is called good news.
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.920]   In and through Jesus, God, the king,
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.240]   is coming in a way, a new way,
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:30.240]   in the world to establish his saving rule,
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:35.080]   first in the hearts of his people and in their relationships
[00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.560]   by triumphing over sin, Satan, death,
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.040]   and then by the exercise of his reign,
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.660]   gathering a people for himself in congregations
[00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:49.660]   that live as citizens of a new allegiance
[00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.960]   of the kingdom, not of this world.
[00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:55.520]   And then Christ comes a second time
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.440]   and completes the reign,
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.720]   the kingdom in establishing a new heavens and a new earth.
[00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.080]   So the picture you get in the gospels
[00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.940]   as Jesus unfolds the teaching of the kingdom
[00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.940]   is that it is both present and it is still future.
[00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.640]   In fact, this is what he means when he says
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:25.040]   that the mystery of the kingdom is here,
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.240]   presence without consummation.
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.540]   So for example, the future dimension of the kingdom,
[00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.200]   you can hear it in the Lord's prayer,
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.920]   your kingdom come, we should pray that every day.
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.520]   Bring it, Lord, it's not here the way we want it to be.
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.700]   Bring your kingdom, bring your reign fully
[00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.560]   in people's lives, in my life, in the world.
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.560]   Or Luke 19 11, Jesus proceeded to tell a parable
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:55.360]   because he was near Jerusalem and because they supposed
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.160]   that the kingdom of God was to appear immediately.
[00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.120]   In other words, it's not.
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.920]   The kingdom of God is not going to appear immediately.
[00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:09.480]   And yet, repeatedly, Jesus says the kingdom is at hand.
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.800]   Repent for the kingdom of God is at hand.
[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.400]   In fact, he's more explicit than that, Luke 11 20.
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.940]   If it is by the finger of God that I cast out demons,
[00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.100]   the kingdom of God is upon you.
[00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:25.040]   Or even more explicitly, Luke 17 21,
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:30.040]   behold, the kingdom of God is in your midst.
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:36.180]   So how can the kingdom of God be both not yet present,
[00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.560]   pray for it, it's coming, it's not yet here,
[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.880]   it's not gonna be immediate, and yet already present
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.380]   in your midst, upon you, at hand?
[00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:51.280]   And the answer is the kingdom of God is God's reign,
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:56.200]   his sovereign action in the world to redeem
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:00.220]   and deliver a people and then at a future time,
[00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:05.220]   finish it and renew his people and the universe completely.
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:11.320]   Now, if we ask, why is the term kingdom of God
[00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:15.160]   or kingdom of heaven prominent and explicit
[00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:19.780]   in the teachings of Jesus, but much less so in the epistles,
[00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:23.840]   which is true, my suggestion is this.
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:30.160]   During the lifetime of Jesus, he was walking a very fine line
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.960]   between making himself known as the son of God
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:41.960]   and the actual presence of the king himself,
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:46.240]   on the one hand, and concealing himself
[00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.720]   from being taken and made to be an earthly king,
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:52.320]   'cause they were ready to come and make him king.
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:56.500]   And you recall how Jesus repeatedly told people
[00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:59.720]   not to tell others about what they had seen,
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:03.400]   Matthew 17, nine, Mark 7, 36.
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:07.720]   And that's because there would be such a widespread
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:11.160]   misunderstanding about the nature of his kingship
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:14.040]   that a political revolt might happen
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:17.680]   as people tried to sweep him onto the throne,
[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:21.960]   like John six, no, he came to be crucified.
[00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:24.680]   That's why he came, he came to die,
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.500]   not to be put on a throne yet.
[00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:33.600]   He would only be king through crucifixion and resurrection,
[00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:37.680]   and the disciples could scarcely comprehend that.
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:41.960]   So after the resurrection, it could be seen now
[00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:46.960]   with crystal clarity what the disciples couldn't fathom
[00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:52.520]   during his lifetime, namely, the kingdom of God
[00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:57.520]   would be most gloriously revealed in a crucified and risen
[00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:03.240]   king, and therefore the shift that happens in no way
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:07.840]   diminishes the importance of what was taught
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:10.560]   about the kingdom during the lifetime of Jesus,
[00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:15.560]   but it does shift, it does put the overwhelming emphasis
[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:22.360]   now on the king himself as the crucified risen Lord
[00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:25.000]   of the universe.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.920]   So the new emphasis, which is more explicit
[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:33.840]   in the epistles, is Jesus is Lord.
[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:37.480]   In fact, if you were to press me, I'd say,
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:40.880]   the kingdom has come is almost synonymous
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:45.160]   with Jesus is Lord, or to say it the other way around,
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:49.080]   Jesus is Lord is almost synonymous in the epistles
[00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:54.080]   with the kingdom, the reign, the king has come.
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:59.240]   It's not just that he has come, he will come.
[00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:05.560]   And I think we probably do well today to keep in mind
[00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:11.360]   whenever we start to foreground the kingdom of God,
[00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:16.520]   let's make sure that our teaching has the flavor
[00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:21.760]   of the apostolic application of the reign of Jesus
[00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:24.240]   in the churches and in the world.
[00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:29.240]   It's the Lordship of the crucified and risen Christ
[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:33.020]   that should receive the emphasis today.
[00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:36.880]   - Amen, what a glorious sovereign savior we serve.
[00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:37.960]   Thank you, Pastor John,

[00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:00.680]   to look at personal suffering once again.
[00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:02.800]   We looked at this about a week ago,
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:04.680]   specifically when it comes to
[00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:07.860]   our most difficult pains in life.
[00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:09.880]   How do we thank God for those sufferings?
[00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:13.240]   How do we thank God for those sufferings?
[00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:16.680]   And are we to thank him for the trials?
[00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:17.600]   That's next time.
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:21.360]   Have a wonderful weekend, a long Labor Day weekend
[00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:22.560]   for those of you in the stays,
