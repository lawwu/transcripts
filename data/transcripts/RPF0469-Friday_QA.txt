[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:33.680]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.600]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.200]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.920]   My name is Joshua, and I am your host, and today's show is a Q&A show.
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.360]   The way these work is once a week at this point, doing my best to keep to a once a week
[00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.360]   schedule.
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.920]   Once a week, I open up the call phone line to patrons of the show, and you get to ask
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:02.240]   me anything, and then it goes out on the show.
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.440]   I enjoy doing these Q&A shows because it gives me a good amount of feedback, and it allows
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.560]   me to answer questions from the audience, which is really fun.
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.940]   It keeps the show topics varied and diverse, and it gives you a chance to ask your question
[00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.080]   or make your comment.
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.000]   You can say anything that you want.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.040]   So I've got five callers waiting on the line right now.
[00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.520]   We're going to get right to it in just a second.
[00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.520]   Before we do, if you'd like to join a call like this, just sign up to become a patron
[00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:31.160]   of the show, RadicalPersonalFinance.com/patron, and access to these Q&A calls is one of your

[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.480]   First let's go to Matthew in Tennessee.
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.720]   Matthew, welcome to the show.
[00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.720]   Let me know what your question is, please.
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.440]   Good morning, Joshua.
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.480]   Thank you for taking my call today.
[00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:49.120]   My question revolves around the missing money concept.
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:55.820]   Have you helped clients find missing money using sites like literallymissingmoney.com?
[00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.800]   If you have, what's the process look like?
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.320]   Any helpful pointers?
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.400]   It always comes across as really scammy to me, but I could be wrong.
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.840]   I haven't used that website specifically, the missing money, but just from the name,
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.920]   I'm aware of how it works.
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.440]   In essence, there are government databases of unclaimed funds.
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.760]   Let's say, for example, that you had a life insurance policy and it died and they couldn't
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.800]   find – the insurance company couldn't find a beneficiary, et cetera.
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:29.360]   At some point in time, that may go and revert back and it needs to be published as available
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.360]   money.
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.040]   Or let's say there were a lawsuit settlement or somebody died.
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.480]   Your long-lost aunt and she died in test state with no next of kin.
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:46.840]   Then that money gets published and then I guess these websites access a public database
[00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.400]   in some way and allow you to find it and then file your claim on it.
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.640]   I've not used any of them.
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.640]   I don't know – I haven't heard of them being scams.
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.440]   I have found money and I forget the process.
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.280]   It was so many years ago that I found something that I was entitled to and I know I've had
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.840]   family members as well.
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.360]   If you put your name into some of the websites, it seems like oftentimes you can find $100
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.840]   or a couple of $100 that was missing somewhere.
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.800]   I don't know enough to say about scams or not scams.
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.080]   I think that it's a legitimate – it's certainly legitimate that there is missing
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.800]   money out there.
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.640]   But in terms of which website would be the best to use, I simply don't know.
[00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:24.960]   Have you actually tried filing?
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:29.320]   Are you showing up as having money missing in the database?
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.680]   No, I've not tried.
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.920]   I've actually went on their website and that's what's kind of throwing me off is
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.880]   that the websites are quite dated.
[00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.160]   And that's what was kind of pushing me back a little bit was that – I don't know
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.280]   if that's actually rational either to go onto a website and be like, "Oh, this looks
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.760]   nice and therefore I should trust it."
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.480]   But sometimes it does help.
[00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:58.200]   But no, I haven't tried it and I haven't – I was mainly asking the question which
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:04.640]   you answered in that is it legitimate and is it worth actually going through the time
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:05.640]   of –
[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.840]   Well, I guess that's debatable depending on value.
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.620]   But I'm saying is it legitimate practically.
[00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:16.400]   I think it is legitimate and I don't know if you have to go through the website.
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.840]   I just did a quick DuckDuckGo search here and it looks like there – it goes through
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.440]   the National Association of Unclaimed Property Administrators.
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.880]   Has a website that you can use, search state by state.
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.980]   That seems to be probably a more officially endorsed website.
[00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:37.880]   So again, that's National Association of Unclaimed Property Administrators.
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:44.080]   But then it says that they endorse a free search database called Missing Money.
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.760]   So perhaps that is the best place to start.
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:51.640]   I don't know whether it would be possible to go directly through the government, through
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.160]   the local state government, et cetera.
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.000]   And I would be very, very cautious about giving information out anytime you're dealing with
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.140]   that.
[00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:01.260]   But I'm not immediately scared of it.
[00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.440]   Is it worth it for $100 or $200?
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.520]   I don't know.
[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:05.520]   Probably not.
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.360]   Is it worth it for thousands if you could find thousands?
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.360]   Probably so.
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:15.720]   So if any other listeners have an idea of how this works or if you've gone through it,
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.880]   come by the show notes for today's episode and post that in the comments so we can benefit.
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:23.680]   Matthew, since I didn't have a good answer there, you want to ask another question?
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.480]   Matthew McQueen Sure.
[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:26.480]   OK.
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:32.880]   So in your opinion, what's the distinct difference between the CFP education and the
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.280]   MSFS education?
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:41.920]   And I know that you'd mentioned it on the show before that your previous employer covered
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.720]   the cost for that MSFS.
[00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:47.920]   But actually going through the program, in your opinion, do you think it would have been
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:50.920]   worth shelling out the $20K that it costs for the program?
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:57.120]   So that's two different questions as far as the difference versus what it's worth.
[00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.600]   So here are the differences.
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:06.840]   First, the CFP designation is a professional designation.
[00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.360]   It's not a degree.
[00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:14.480]   It's a professional designation and it's granted by the CFP board, which is a private industry
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:19.240]   organization that simply exists to provide the CFP designation.
[00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:23.840]   And the steps to getting the CFP involve – I believe it's seven classes at this point,
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:29.060]   seven specifically focused on various aspects of financial planning classes and a comprehensive
[00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:32.280]   exam at the end of it.
[00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:38.640]   And then if you pass the requirements, there's also an experience requirement and a testing
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:39.760]   requirement.
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:46.280]   If you pass those requirements and you have – and you pay your fees every year, then
[00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:51.200]   you get to use the certified financial planning credential and designation.
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:54.440]   And it's certainly – at this point, I would say it has the highest brand awareness
[00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:58.440]   and the highest knowledge in terms of the consumer mind.
[00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:01.180]   And I think it's a good designation.
[00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:06.800]   The education to get there is relatively broad-based.
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:10.960]   The MSFS stands for Masters of Science in Financial Services.
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:15.200]   Basically it's more commonly known to be a master's degree in financial planning.
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:21.480]   And that is an official college degree that's going to be granted by an educational institution.
[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:25.640]   So the process is much like any other master's degree.
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:30.240]   It's not based upon the specific CFP designation board.
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:32.640]   It's granted by the university.
[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:37.800]   And the MSFS – my experience, I did my MSFS with the American College, which is a college
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:40.760]   of financial planning up in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania.
[00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:47.840]   And there – when they did – when we did the MSFS, it required a number of different
[00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:51.560]   courses and in different areas.
[00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:58.080]   And then some of them were self-study and some of them were study in person, some capstone
[00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:02.460]   courses that were all together in a seminar format.
[00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:07.680]   What I experienced with the MSFS is that it was much deeper in terms of deeper study in
[00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:08.880]   some specific areas.
[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:14.380]   So for example, I remember that the coursework involved a deeper dive into retirement planning
[00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:17.900]   and into some of the modern science around retirement planning.
[00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:22.640]   And so it was much more about reading some of the papers and reading some of the new
[00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:28.200]   techniques that financial planners are using to try to solve the retirement problems.
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:34.480]   It was much more up-to-date and it was much deeper level rather than general broad understanding.
[00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:39.640]   In order to pass the CFP, you need to have a general broad understanding of rules and
[00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:40.880]   regulations.
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:43.320]   But the CFP is technique agnostic.
[00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:46.840]   So they wouldn't talk about, yes, you should use a buckets of money approach or you should
[00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:51.360]   use a safe money, risky money approach or they wouldn't get into that kind of approach.
[00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:55.520]   Whereas in the MSFS, that would be an example of the types of things that we studied.
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:59.520]   How much should – when doing a retirement distribution plan, how much money should you
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:06.240]   put in annuities versus just simply mutual funds, things like that.
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:10.520]   The MSFS, I'm actually lapsed on my CFP right now.
[00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:16.240]   I don't actually – even though I have all the credentials still hanging on my desk
[00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:20.400]   wall, I haven't paid them their fees this year and I lapsed on my CE.
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:22.880]   This is some of the kind of practical things.
[00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:26.760]   The CFP requires a certain number of continuing education credits every year.
[00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:30.720]   I can't remember if it's 20 or 30 hours and I got behind last year and I haven't
[00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:32.360]   caught up my CE yet.
[00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:33.560]   Then they also require a fee.
[00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:40.640]   So they require 360 bucks a year to be able to use the CFP designation and to display
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:41.640]   it.
[00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:45.960]   So currently, I don't call myself a certified financial planner because I lapsed with them
[00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.480]   and I'm not listed in the database anymore.
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:51.240]   On the flip side, the MSFS is just simply a college degree.
[00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:57.560]   So I still do use that designation because I have the degree and there are not ongoing
[00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:01.720]   continuing education credits required for it.
[00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:05.400]   Would I pay the 20 grand for the master's degree?
[00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:08.000]   It would depend on the circumstance that I'm in.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:17.080]   In general, in a financial services productive capacity, very rarely will a client actually
[00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:20.080]   care about your academic certifications.
[00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:24.520]   What a client cares about is your knowledge and there's no reason to pay for academic
[00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:30.500]   certifications if you have the knowledge in terms of you can do it.
[00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:39.620]   Some of the most productive financial services people that I know have no financial planning
[00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:43.260]   designations of any kind but they're very, very productive and they can be very, very
[00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:44.260]   smart.
[00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:49.180]   Now, usually, the cost of actually getting into it does make it worth it and most of
[00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:51.740]   the time, the cost is relatively small.
[00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:56.340]   So if I were actively still in that business, yeah, I think I would probably consider it
[00:10:56.340 --> 00:11:00.980]   but I would do it slowly over time and I wouldn't fall into the trap of thinking that it was
[00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:02.460]   going to make a big, big difference.
[00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:06.500]   The only place that certification makes a big, big difference formally in terms of the
[00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:11.660]   pay is for somebody whose pay is going to be a change based upon the academic degree.
[00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:15.340]   A lot of times, somebody – if they get an MBA or if they get a master's degree, then
[00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:20.780]   there's an automatic increase in pay of a certain amount and then you can run the analysis
[00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:22.540]   of it.
[00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:24.540]   Would I pay for it out of pocket?
[00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:25.540]   I don't know.
[00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:33.020]   I would probably lean towards doing it but it's so hard to say.
[00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:36.820]   It's not really going to make that big of a difference for somebody who's knowledgeable.
[00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:40.980]   The biggest thing where I think designations make the difference is they help transform
[00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:44.460]   the person's confidence and they help the person to learn more.
[00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:47.500]   There's good industry data to show that the people who are the most credentialed are often
[00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:51.340]   the most productive and I think the reason is because it builds confidence.
[00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:57.140]   I know for me, it helped me to build confidence to where I felt like I could actually give
[00:11:57.140 --> 00:12:03.620]   real tremendous financial planning value to somebody because I had the background academically.
[00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:06.420]   But I wouldn't focus on it first.
[00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:10.220]   If I were just getting started in the business, I would focus on production and then I would
[00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:11.620]   build up over time.
[00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:14.340]   I couldn't answer it beyond that.
[00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:15.780]   That answer the question enough, Matthew?
[00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:18.180]   Any follow-up clarification before I go on to the next caller?
[00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:20.300]   Matthew Fossum No, that absolutely does.
[00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:25.220]   I was just, yeah, that's exactly what I was thinking.
[00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:29.460]   I just was pretty much asking did the MSFS have any special sauce, but it kind of sounds
[00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:34.820]   like what you're paying for is the organization of the actual education and actually the follow-through
[00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:40.740]   to the different things that you have versus by getting the MSFS, that there probably was
[00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:46.060]   something inside of that that couldn't be obtained from an outside source.
[00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:52.420]   You can buy a whole lot of books for 20K, but I do appreciate your answer in that question.
[00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:53.420]   Thank you very much.
[00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:57.520]   It's the same exact question and problem that you face with any kind of college degree.
[00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:03.780]   You can – that favorite scene from Good Will Hunting where the guy is talking about
[00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:05.500]   you could have gotten – you got an education.
[00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:08.820]   You could have gotten for a couple hundred bucks in late fees at the local library.
[00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:10.760]   The knowledge is freely available.
[00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:15.620]   So in looking at – the access to the information is freely available.
[00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:19.900]   It's not hard to find good information at all.
[00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:25.500]   But the key is to go – is to start and look.
[00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:28.480]   Am I looking for the information that's applicable?
[00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:32.940]   In that case, going through a class is probably an inefficient way to learn when you're just
[00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:35.060]   simply looking for information on the case.
[00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:38.020]   Or are you looking for something that is going to have a broader benefit?
[00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:43.900]   A master's degree is going to open up opportunities for teaching and that was why I did it was
[00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:47.000]   because I didn't have to come out of pocket for it and I always thought it would be fun
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   to be a college professor.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.580]   I said, "Well, if I can get a master's degree without coming out of pocket for me,
[00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:57.440]   that opens up the opportunity for me to potentially be a college professor if I ever wanted to."
[00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:58.980]   So never know.
[00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:02.180]   There's no reason not to.
[00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:03.180]   All right.
[00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:06.260]   Jeff in New York, go ahead and let us know what your question is please.
[00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:07.260]   Hey, Joshua.
[00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:12.180]   First of all, just appreciate you taking my call and thanks for everything that you do.
[00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:16.700]   I found you about a year ago, just kind of mumbling through podcasts.
[00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:23.340]   And ever since I've been listening, definitely taking a closer look at the Phi community
[00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:25.340]   and kind of that side of things.
[00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:30.260]   So it's definitely been a great thing to have access to all that you're doing.
[00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:32.660]   So thanks very much for that.
[00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:36.940]   My question is just related to kind of general housing strategy.
[00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:42.540]   I'm currently trying to pay off some debts and my dad is actually in the process of building
[00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:47.100]   his retirement home, but he's not going to live there for about probably about a year
[00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:48.100]   or so.
[00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:53.260]   And he offered me the possibility to live there rent free probably for about six to
[00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.300]   12 months.
[00:14:55.300 --> 00:15:00.820]   This would require a little bit of a commute on a daily basis, probably about an hour.
[00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:04.460]   I'm currently commuting really only about 30 minutes per se.
[00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:06.220]   I'm actually carless at the moment.
[00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:08.260]   It would also necessitate purchasing a car.
[00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:12.100]   So I was thinking probably, you know, three to 5,000 out of pocket, just pay cash for
[00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:14.220]   something to do that.
[00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:21.820]   So I'm currently paying about 1,200 in rent, depending on the month.
[00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:26.980]   So just kind of wanted to see if, you know, the outlay of maybe five grand for a car was
[00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:34.740]   worth in the grand scheme, you know, that just that savings of, you know, potentially
[00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:40.020]   living six to 12 months for a year rent free and having that extra to be able to throw
[00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:41.020]   at my debt.
[00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:42.020]   Are you single?
[00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:43.900]   I am, yes.
[00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:46.620]   How much debt do you have?
[00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:48.260]   About 35,000.
[00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:49.260]   And what's your income?
[00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:50.260]   80,000.
[00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:59.060]   If you were to do this, do you think you could be out of debt in six to 12 months?
[00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:00.180]   I do.
[00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:07.140]   I'm currently kind of projecting probably about June of '18 I should be all done.
[00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:12.620]   So if I was there that minimum, probably six to 12 months, I think it could be the vehicle
[00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:14.220]   to make that happen.
[00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:16.500]   What type of work do you do?
[00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:20.580]   I'm in technology, like operations type stuff.
[00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:22.580]   So you don't, I mean, you don't use your car for work.
[00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:23.580]   You could drive a cheap car.
[00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:24.580]   It's not a big deal.
[00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:25.580]   You're not in the road.
[00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:26.580]   You don't have image to maintain, et cetera.
[00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:27.580]   No, definitely not.
[00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:30.820]   Not the lawyer doctor stigma.
[00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:33.340]   Great, great.
[00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:37.740]   It sounds pretty cool to me.
[00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:39.980]   I would probably pursue it.
[00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:45.900]   If you can do it on six to 12 months, to me it sounds really ideal in this context.
[00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:48.980]   It's probably of help to your dad to have the place looked after.
[00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:52.860]   Empty houses are not great things, period.
[00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:54.500]   And so it's probably of help to him.
[00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:56.940]   So you don't have to feel like a total freeloader.
[00:16:56.940 --> 00:16:59.380]   He wants to help you out during this phase.
[00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:04.220]   So it's a win for him that he gets to provide some help for you.
[00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:07.140]   So I see that as being good.
[00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:11.900]   An hour commute, to go from 30 minutes of a commute to a one hour commute for the short
[00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:17.060]   term, a year's time to me sounds pretty, it doesn't sound terrible.
[00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:22.740]   Obviously, shorter commutes are always, are often better and more valuable.
[00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:25.180]   But for you, you could put the time to good use.
[00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:30.060]   Many of ways to put the time to good use, and we're talking about a temporary time period,
[00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:38.180]   and it's a very direct path to saving $10,000 to $12,000 if we called it on the year timeline.
[00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:41.860]   And if you have the timeline to where that would work out with your income to be able
[00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:45.860]   to be debt free at the end of the year, I think that would be well worth pursuing.
[00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:52.580]   I would buy a cheap car, a little Toyota Corolla, a Honda Accord, Toyota Camry, something like
[00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:53.580]   that.
[00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:54.940]   I'd spend a couple thousand dollars.
[00:17:54.940 --> 00:18:01.380]   And the great thing about doing that, if you do that, is depending on what you need after
[00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:08.860]   you're done, if you buy an inexpensive car, you can sell it again if you want to go car
[00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:09.920]   free at the end of the year.
[00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:16.420]   You can sell it again and basically get all your money out of it and have a fine little
[00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:17.580]   commuter car.
[00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:21.060]   So I think I would, yeah, I would.
[00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:23.660]   I think that sounds like a really ideal scenario.
[00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:26.860]   Is there any reason why you don't think that would be a good idea?
[00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:33.060]   No, I think really the only thing would be the silly fear of missing out, I suppose.
[00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:37.120]   It's a little bit out in the sticks, so to say.
[00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:42.940]   But other than that, I think it's probably good to dig me out of the hole.
[00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:49.100]   And I think the other thing you hit on very well is the resale potential of the car.
[00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:52.020]   I was definitely thinking something like a Camry or an Accord.
[00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:57.820]   So to be able to get three quarters of what I paid for it out of it, I think, makes that
[00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:02.700]   outlay a little bit more reasonable in the situation.
[00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:07.980]   You got to compare it to what's the scenario that would be – what's a different scenario
[00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:08.980]   that you have.
[00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:12.720]   So right now you're spending $1,000 or $1,200 a month on rent and you're able to get by
[00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:14.060]   without a car.
[00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:18.260]   Well, could you spend – if you got a roommate, or could you find a place to rent a room and
[00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:21.620]   a house for $400 a month and get by without a car?
[00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:26.240]   If so, then you calculate what that would look like over the course of a year.
[00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:31.720]   But to go from what you're paying now to zero rent and I don't know – would your
[00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:35.740]   dad pay the – cover the utilities or would you need to pay for those as well?
[00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:38.020]   I think he was willing to do that, yes.
[00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:45.180]   So when you get rid of utilities, that could also be really compelling because $100 a month
[00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:51.380]   in electricity, things like that, you could probably get rid of your – any kind of internet
[00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:52.380]   needs.
[00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:56.420]   Just use your cell phone and tether when you need internet at home and you're going to
[00:19:56.420 --> 00:19:57.940]   be at work a lot of times.
[00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:02.940]   So you can get rid of any kind of cable or unless it comes in the house.
[00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:09.740]   You can cut your utility bills down hugely and so the savings here with having a hookup
[00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:16.340]   like a family connection could wind up in your benefit closer to say $1,300, maybe $1,400
[00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:20.940]   a month by the time you add up the coverage for utilities.
[00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:23.380]   So as a temporary thing, I think it helps your dad.
[00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:25.180]   It helps you as a temporary thing.
[00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:26.580]   I think it sounds like a great idea.
[00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:27.580]   Great.
[00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:30.420]   I appreciate the insight, Joshua.
[00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:31.420]   For sure.
[00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:32.420]   All right.
[00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:34.860]   Haleshia, we're going to come to you in just a moment.
[00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:37.380]   Before I do though, sponsor of today's show is HelloFresh.
[00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:40.340]   HelloFresh, you've heard me talk about it before.
[00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:45.860]   It's one of these boxed up meals scenarios where they send you a box with all kinds of
[00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:47.420]   different meals in it.
[00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:49.420]   They send you it once a week if you want.
[00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:52.700]   You can choose the number of meals, all kinds of different scenarios and the food comes
[00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:55.660]   all in the box, in a refrigerated box.
[00:20:55.660 --> 00:21:01.580]   The food comes with all of the portions measured out and step-by-step instructions where you
[00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:05.620]   can follow the recipe card and just pull the box out of the fridge, follow the recipe card
[00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:09.580]   and basically 30 minutes, you've got the food in the oven and you can get it on the table
[00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:11.660]   shortly thereafter.
[00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:16.660]   I do a lot of the cooking in my house and I have a problem that I cook from massive portions.
[00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:23.500]   So I do a lot of the cooking and always have these just crazy amounts of food in the house.
[00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:30.020]   But it frustrates my wife deeply because for her, she has to come to the refrigerator and
[00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:34.180]   see mountains and mountains of stuff and figure out what to do at 5 o'clock in the evening.
[00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:37.760]   We try to do a better job with meal planning but it still seems to be one of the areas
[00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:43.500]   where we constantly – well, our aspiration is higher than our realization.
[00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:45.140]   HelloFresh solves some of those problems for us.
[00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:47.400]   It gives you a little box, you can pop the box out.
[00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:48.400]   She loves that.
[00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:49.400]   She doesn't have to think.
[00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:52.700]   She just grabs the recipe and puts it together and boom, done.
[00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:55.700]   Now, John, you said – we're talking before I hit record on the call.
[00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:57.940]   You said that your wife loves it as well.
[00:21:57.940 --> 00:21:58.940]   Is that right?
[00:21:58.940 --> 00:21:59.940]   Yeah, that's correct.
[00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:00.940]   Yeah, she's tried a few of them.
[00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:01.940]   She likes HelloFresh.
[00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:04.260]   What does she like about it?
[00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:05.260]   What's her favorite thing?
[00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:12.540]   Is it like with my wife where she grabs the simplicity of it or what specifically does
[00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:13.540]   she like about it?
[00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:19.460]   I mean, everything is measured out and if you need an onion or a small onion, they give
[00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:23.780]   you one small onion or one little vial of olive oil or whatever.
[00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:27.620]   So it's kind of like having a little sous chef there that's already done all the work
[00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:30.980]   for you and you just kind of assemble everything.
[00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:34.420]   I think the biggest thing she likes though is that the recipes don't tend to repeat.
[00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:36.860]   I don't know if they repeat even in a year.
[00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:40.820]   So it kind of gets her to cook things she wouldn't normally cook and have the ability
[00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:48.100]   to cook so without some research online, it's a subscription service so it puts it all right
[00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:50.020]   there in front of you and it's ready to go.
[00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:53.740]   Yeah, it takes some of the planning and puts it back in your cell.
[00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:55.900]   Certainly not as cheap as what we do.
[00:22:55.900 --> 00:23:00.060]   You go to Costco and the restaurant supply store where we get most of our groceries.
[00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:03.700]   It's not as cheap but it still comes out to less than $10 a meal and when you've got someone
[00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:08.700]   else that can create the recipes for you, it's a really great in-between scenario.
[00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:13.140]   It's cheaper and more fun than dining out good quality food as well.
[00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:15.660]   So go to HelloFresh.com, sign up if you've never tried it.
[00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:21.300]   Try it out, a simple starter subscription, save $30 with the coupon code RPF30.
[00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:27.500]   Again that's $30 off your initial subscription with the coupon code RPF30 and then let me
[00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:28.980]   know how you like it.
[00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:31.060]   All right, Halesha, did I say it right?
[00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:32.580]   Halesha in Colorado, welcome to the show.
[00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:33.580]   Yes, thank you.
[00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:36.740]   I'm really excited to be here.
[00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:40.580]   Let us know what's on your mind and let's see how I can serve you today, please.
[00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:45.340]   My mom's pretty sick and she has some pretty hefty medical expenses coming up.
[00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:51.940]   I was wondering just from my financial standpoint on what I should really look into or there's
[00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:55.540]   some creative ways to finance this that maybe I haven't thought about.
[00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:57.300]   What kind of sick is she?
[00:23:57.300 --> 00:23:59.860]   Cancer sick.
[00:23:59.860 --> 00:24:00.860]   What's her medical prognosis?
[00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:04.980]   Probably going to die in the next year.
[00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:07.540]   And is she married?
[00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:09.020]   Yes.
[00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:10.660]   Okay.
[00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:13.820]   Financially what is your mom's financial situation?
[00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:15.820]   Not great.
[00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:19.660]   Deprived of my parents.
[00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:25.500]   Is she – as far as her – how old is she and what insurance coverage does she have?
[00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:30.940]   She is 67 and she has Medicare.
[00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:31.940]   Okay.
[00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:35.380]   So just base Medicare and no supplemental insurance?
[00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:37.380]   My understanding is yes.
[00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:38.380]   Okay.
[00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:40.940]   Do you feel that she is receiving through the Medicare system?
[00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:45.860]   Is she receiving the type of treatment that she needs or is there a need for her to get
[00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:49.580]   treatment that's not currently covered?
[00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:51.580]   I'm not really sure yet.
[00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:52.580]   All right.
[00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:56.980]   So, I'm sorry to hear she's doing so poorly.
[00:24:56.980 --> 00:25:01.060]   So there are a couple of different ways to answer it.
[00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:06.980]   Let's talk about kind of the most aggressive protective scenario.
[00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:14.540]   Your mom's husband, do they have assets together that they own together?
[00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:15.540]   Not really.
[00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:16.540]   Not at the moment.
[00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:17.540]   Okay.
[00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:20.380]   So basically I'm getting the impression they don't have a lot of money or a lot of assets.
[00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:21.380]   Is that right?
[00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:22.820]   That is correct.
[00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:23.820]   Okay.
[00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:26.700]   So – and then is he working right now?
[00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:27.700]   No.
[00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:28.700]   He's like 83.
[00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:29.700]   Okay.
[00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:30.700]   So he's caring for her.
[00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:31.780]   Are they their sources of income?
[00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:36.780]   Is it just basically Social Security or do they have any other types of pension arrangements
[00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:37.780]   established for themselves?
[00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:41.100]   I think there's a pension as well for my dad.
[00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:42.100]   Okay.
[00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:47.860]   So let's start with kind of the most aggressive financial planning scenario.
[00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:54.980]   Essentially there are two people that need to be cared for in this context.
[00:25:54.980 --> 00:26:01.020]   The number one most important is your mother and her medical care and her medical needs.
[00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:05.140]   So that is of primary importance and you've got to make sure that she gets the care.
[00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:11.860]   But you also have to make sure that your father is cared for as well.
[00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:16.580]   And because their finances are joined, there's – we have a duty of care for both of them
[00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:19.860]   and we have a financial duty of care for both of them as well.
[00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:24.180]   So as a simple example, let's say they had a million dollars in a bank account.
[00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:28.420]   If they were going to use all million dollars of that bank account on her medical care,
[00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:29.500]   that might be the right thing to do.
[00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:35.280]   But we have to recognize the fact that that will leave him destitute, financially destitute.
[00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:41.560]   Now in your situation, since your parents don't have significant assets, we're basically
[00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:43.580]   talking about income.
[00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:46.340]   So she's going to accrue – she hasn't already.
[00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:50.740]   She's probably going to accrue major medical bills that she doesn't have the money to
[00:26:50.740 --> 00:26:51.780]   pay.
[00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:56.060]   So the first thing is to approach this almost like you would approach bankruptcy planning
[00:26:56.060 --> 00:27:00.140]   and to say what sources of income do they have and how do we protect them?
[00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:05.540]   Social security income is protected from the claims of creditors and so can be pension
[00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:08.040]   income from the claims of creditors.
[00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:12.260]   So it's important that you sit down and if your dad is receiving a pension payment
[00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:19.020]   from a work pension, then you want to make sure that's segregated and that's not
[00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:22.060]   becoming a claim – that's not going into a joint account.
[00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:27.780]   I just want to start to provide some protection for that from the potential future claims
[00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:29.900]   of her creditors.
[00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:34.580]   As she accrues medical expenses, as she goes forward with her treatment and as she has
[00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:40.140]   the medical expenses, all of those medical expenses, you want to work to make sure that
[00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:43.340]   they all stay in her name and in her name alone.
[00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:48.980]   And what will happen is if she dies, say six months from now she dies and she owes $300,000
[00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:58.620]   of medical expenses, then her estate will stand good for her debts.
[00:27:58.620 --> 00:28:01.580]   But it's likely that she won't have much of an estate.
[00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:03.740]   So do your parents own a house together?
[00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:06.060]   Not at the moment, no.
[00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:07.060]   So they're renting.
[00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:12.580]   So basically anything that she owns will stand good for what she owes.
[00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:17.700]   So if she does have any personal assets or any financial assets, when she dies, if she
[00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:23.380]   dies prematurely, if she dies prematurely, then anything that she owns, her bank accounts
[00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:28.380]   and any personal property, things like that, would basically go to stand good for her debts.
[00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:33.500]   If she doesn't have a lot of money and if she doesn't have a lot of property, then
[00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:39.160]   the creditors will just simply not be paid because you are not going to inherit her debts.
[00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:42.060]   Your dad is not going to inherit her debts.
[00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:46.140]   So those medical expenses just simply won't be paid.
[00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:50.100]   So it's important to be defensive in your approach and it's important for you to be
[00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:58.660]   defensive in making sure that you don't sign up to become – that you don't agree to
[00:28:58.660 --> 00:29:02.700]   stand for the medical expenses and it's important that to the best degree possible that your
[00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:06.340]   dad not agree to be liable for any medical expenses.
[00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:10.980]   So that in a worst-case scenario, if she dies in the next six months from now or 12 months
[00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:16.060]   from now, that those medical expenses unfortunately simply won't be paid.
[00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:20.580]   What many people try to do is you want to obviously acknowledge the goodness of the
[00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:28.780]   people who are seeking to – providing medical care for her and who may never get paid.
[00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:31.580]   They know that that going in, they know that they may never get paid.
[00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:36.180]   So you obviously want to do anything you can to satisfy that moral obligation of the debt
[00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:40.060]   but you don't have to take on to yourself the financial obligation.
[00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:43.700]   That's the basic approach financially.
[00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:45.860]   Now the key thing is back to the care.
[00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:47.140]   What about the care?
[00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:50.240]   Oftentimes what you'll find, especially with Medicare, is there are some treatments
[00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:57.420]   that Medicare is going to cover and then there may be some things that Medicare isn't going
[00:29:57.420 --> 00:29:58.420]   to cover.
[00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:03.140]   So you've got to figure out how – if you're going to do something that the insurance doesn't
[00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:05.220]   pay for, how can you do that?
[00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:06.620]   How can it be paid for?
[00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:08.980]   How could you do it?
[00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:17.540]   Knowing clearly that your mom – that likely speaking, the people who are providing medical
[00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:21.740]   care for her are not going to be paid except what the insurance pays out and knowing that
[00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:27.260]   you're not going to inherit any of her debts, then you and the family members need to decide
[00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:31.900]   about the things that aren't covered by insurance that you can do.
[00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:35.700]   Oftentimes there will be ways for you to support and you can say, "Well, we'll pay for
[00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:41.780]   this other treatment over here or we'll negotiate for this experimental thing," et cetera,
[00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:45.140]   and you may choose to pay for that out of your own resources.
[00:30:45.140 --> 00:30:49.140]   But basically what I would do is just talk to everybody, make sure that everybody knows
[00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:56.780]   the situation, knows the circumstances, knows your mom's lack of financial resources, and
[00:30:56.780 --> 00:30:57.780]   talk to them.
[00:30:57.780 --> 00:31:01.160]   Make sure while you're going – meaning that oftentimes they may go ahead and agree
[00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:05.300]   to provide care even though they know that they're not going to get paid in the long
[00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:06.300]   run.
[00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:11.740]   Finally, make sure that her income is being used to meet her living expenses as best as
[00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:12.780]   possible.
[00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:18.900]   So prioritize the payment of her rent, the food, the things that she needs, not paying
[00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:19.900]   the medical expenses.
[00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:23.660]   Medical expenses are just going to have to pile up until they can be dealt with.
[00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:24.660]   Okay.
[00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:25.660]   Thank you.
[00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:27.260]   Any further clarifying?
[00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:30.260]   Is that a good start?
[00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:32.940]   I think it's a pretty good start.
[00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:35.980]   I didn't know that the debt wouldn't be transferred.
[00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:36.980]   Right, right.
[00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:42.580]   So that's really good to know because I think it's going to be pretty crushing.
[00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:43.580]   Yeah, it is.
[00:31:43.580 --> 00:31:44.580]   It always is.
[00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:47.580]   I mean it's not uncommon to have a million, a couple of million dollars of debt especially
[00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:51.380]   if there have been advanced treatments and things like that.
[00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:56.540]   So it is important that you know, yes, nobody will inherit your mom's debt.
[00:31:56.540 --> 00:31:58.620]   You will not inherit her debt.
[00:31:58.620 --> 00:32:00.020]   Your dad will not inherit her debt.
[00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:01.740]   Nobody will inherit her debt.
[00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:06.340]   So if she dies prematurely, she dies six months from now, nobody is going to be responsible
[00:32:06.340 --> 00:32:10.900]   for those payments.
[00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:12.580]   So nobody is going to be responsible for that.
[00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:17.020]   You're not going to get any of her assets because her estate, the assets of her estate
[00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:21.980]   need to be sold and disposed of to pay her creditors if she dies.
[00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:24.180]   But no one is going to inherit the debt.
[00:32:24.180 --> 00:32:29.160]   So let me just make a quick planning tip for those who are in a situation where the parents
[00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:31.040]   have more money.
[00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:35.820]   If you're in a situation like this and let's say mom and dad have – they own a house
[00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:43.180]   together and the house has $300,000 of equity and maybe mom has an IRA or a 401K account,
[00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:44.260]   things like that.
[00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:50.800]   This is where you need to sit down and do some good defensive planning, basically elder
[00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:55.900]   care planning or bankruptcy planning and you want to make sure that you don't drain the
[00:32:55.900 --> 00:33:00.160]   assets that are needed for the spouse in order to pay for the medical expenses.
[00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:06.980]   So if I have an IRA with a half a million dollars in it and I need medical care and
[00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:16.940]   I can't – my wife is depending on the $500,000 in my IRA for her retirement years.
[00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:21.420]   If I'm undergoing a cancer diagnosis and cancer treatment, then it's very important
[00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:26.240]   that I not drain the IRA to pay the hospital bills because then what's my wife going
[00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:27.540]   to do when I die?
[00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:30.600]   It's much more important that I keep the money in the IRA.
[00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:33.740]   The IRA has protection from the claims of creditors.
[00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:36.900]   It is a bank – it's a judgment-proof asset.
[00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:41.420]   You cannot be – I can't be sued by the hospitals and then have access to the IRA
[00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:45.380]   and the IRA would pass to my wife by beneficiary designation.
[00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:47.820]   So we cannot spend the money in our IRA.
[00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:53.700]   I can make sure that that money is set aside for her at my death to make sure that she's
[00:33:53.700 --> 00:34:00.540]   covered for retirement and then if I die prematurely, then my estate will just simply not be able
[00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:02.220]   to pay the hospital bills.
[00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:07.580]   So you've got to be defensive there and make sure that the parties of all people are
[00:34:07.580 --> 00:34:08.580]   covered.
[00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:13.840]   You want to make sure the medical providers are paid for as much as money is available
[00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:17.580]   but you've got to make sure that all of the other parties that need to be protected
[00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:19.760]   are protected as well.
[00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:20.760]   So hopefully that helps.
[00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:23.820]   All right, John, you did my hello fresh ad for me.
[00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:24.820]   Now I'll answer your question.
[00:34:24.820 --> 00:34:25.820]   What's up?
[00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:26.820]   John R. Reilly: Yeah, no problem.
[00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:31.820]   Well, first I just wanted to say I appreciate all the advice you gave to Halesha.
[00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:38.780]   That's all good stuff to know and maybe the second caller wants to take some lessons from
[00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:45.520]   Halesha's situation and possibly move in this dad's house and then he might get another
[00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:49.180]   year or two of rent-free living with his dad after that.
[00:34:49.180 --> 00:34:54.420]   I know you've used up like 99% of your time with your in-person time with your parents
[00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:55.420]   after you leave high school.
[00:34:55.420 --> 00:35:00.420]   You might want to take advantage of that.
[00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:07.860]   But yeah, my question was pretty mundane after Halesha's situation but I was just kind of
[00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:14.460]   curious about during the last Q&A you had mentioned a couple tips on how you kind of
[00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:19.700]   digitized some receipts that had the heat ink on them and I've fallen trap to that,
[00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:22.140]   you know, saving receipts forever go back and they're invisible ink.
[00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:24.060]   It's like disappearing ink on them.
[00:35:24.060 --> 00:35:30.500]   And it kind of made me wonder about your system in general and overall about how and your
[00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:38.500]   decision process for which receipts and financial paperwork in general that you keep around
[00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:44.820]   just the whole finances of life and somewhat high level how you organize or how you decide
[00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:48.780]   maybe like a decision process for how you decide to keep certain things in certain ways.
[00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:54.660]   I have a couple apps that I use for scanning but they always seem to be in 10 different
[00:35:54.660 --> 00:36:00.900]   places, you know, just getting it all in one place and OCR and recoverable when you want
[00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:05.220]   to get a certain information would be interesting for me to hear.
[00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:06.220]   Sure.
[00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:10.540]   So let's start simple and here are the simplest ways to do it.
[00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:13.020]   Most people don't need anything fancy.
[00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:14.700]   They don't need anything digital.
[00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:21.380]   They just need a simple file folder and unfortunately many people, their lives are so disorganized
[00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:23.140]   they don't have a file folder.
[00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:29.460]   So the first thing that I recommend is anytime you have something or you buy something, just
[00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:32.340]   establish a standalone file folder.
[00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:37.100]   Depending on the type of thing that it's going to be, a simple manila folder can work well
[00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:42.380]   or oftentimes I like to use and I've acquired a bunch of them for free.
[00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:48.460]   I like to use these little basically like Tyvek envelopes that have a cover that you
[00:36:48.460 --> 00:36:52.260]   can wrap the little bungee cord around and that allows you to organize things that are
[00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:55.500]   related in a very simple way.
[00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:57.640]   But at least a file folder.
[00:36:57.640 --> 00:37:01.700]   So usually for most people, there are only a few things that need to be tracked.
[00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:04.220]   A simple example would be a car.
[00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:08.260]   If I buy a car, the first thing I do when I buy a car is I create a file folder for
[00:37:08.260 --> 00:37:13.940]   it and in that file folder, I keep anything related to that car.
[00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:22.660]   Initial, bill of sale, the title, initial paperwork, registration paperwork, copies
[00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:25.580]   of anything, copies of repair records, etc.
[00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:31.300]   If you just simply have one file folder that's immediately made out for that car, then you
[00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:36.680]   always have a place to put things and it's easy to take and to put things into it.
[00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:42.060]   Another thing that I do is I always keep a notebook with something and a simple notebook
[00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:44.060]   that I can write in.
[00:37:44.060 --> 00:37:47.980]   A simple pad or any kind of small notebook and keep a log.
[00:37:47.980 --> 00:37:52.020]   A log of the mileage, the log of the things that are done.
[00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:55.500]   So when I – a year ago, I bought a camper van and the first thing I did was I put a
[00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:59.460]   notebook in the camper van with a pen attached to it and I use that for keeping notes.
[00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:04.960]   When I take the car to the mechanic, then I write down what I did, what I fixed, etc.
[00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:08.180]   The mileage, the date, all of that.
[00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:11.440]   So I have all the information laid aside.
[00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:16.940]   By simply having a place to put it, that lowers the resistance that we have to keeping good
[00:38:16.940 --> 00:38:21.740]   records and there's no need for complex digital solutions.
[00:38:21.740 --> 00:38:25.220]   In general, you can just have a piece of paper, a notebook, etc.
[00:38:25.220 --> 00:38:31.220]   The issue that we mentioned with regard to the fading receipts is pretty rare with most
[00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:35.060]   things that are in use in life.
[00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:39.820]   Your mechanic generally is going to give you a printed paper printout from his accounting
[00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:45.620]   software and then there will be a heat receipt on the back of it that was just simply the
[00:38:45.620 --> 00:38:47.260]   credit card slip.
[00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:49.340]   So you can look at it and say, "Well, is this important?"
[00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:52.460]   Chances are it's probably not important.
[00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:56.180]   You can probably continue on and you'll have everything you need.
[00:38:56.180 --> 00:38:59.140]   If you do that with – same thing with your house.
[00:38:59.140 --> 00:39:03.060]   You put your title records all in one place and then if you have more, a lot of people
[00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:09.980]   will go ahead and create a binder for their home appliances, things like that.
[00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:15.860]   I try to save almost nothing that can be easily found online but I do try to save paperwork
[00:39:15.860 --> 00:39:17.540]   for things that can't be.
[00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:23.980]   So to me, the user manual is not nearly so important as the actual purchase confirmation
[00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:26.160]   so that I have the information.
[00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:30.780]   So low tech is perfectly fine and works really, really well.
[00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:37.100]   If you need to preserve the receipts, the simplest low tech way to do that is going
[00:39:37.100 --> 00:39:39.300]   to just be to copy them.
[00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:45.500]   I think in this context, a lot of times people have a copier at work.
[00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:49.740]   Certainly you don't want to run your own thousand booklet production job on your boss's
[00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:54.980]   time and paper but ask your boss and one or two receipts copied a month is probably not
[00:39:54.980 --> 00:39:59.720]   going to be a big deal or you can buy a home copy machine that's very inexpensive.
[00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:04.320]   That would be the most basic level and most people would be well served by simply having
[00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:05.860]   that done.
[00:40:05.860 --> 00:40:10.860]   Now you can go up from there and you mentioned you can use a scanning app and start to scan
[00:40:10.860 --> 00:40:11.860]   information.
[00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:14.240]   I've done that.
[00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:15.240]   And does it work?
[00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:16.580]   Yeah, I think it can work.
[00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:21.380]   You can set up an Evernote notebook or some non-Evernote equivalent.
[00:40:21.380 --> 00:40:27.740]   You can set up an Evernote notebook for your – the car, et cetera and then you can just
[00:40:27.740 --> 00:40:29.820]   simply scan each receipt.
[00:40:29.820 --> 00:40:35.100]   I have found that using the scanning app on the phone is good for every now and then but
[00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:37.860]   it's not good for consistent things.
[00:40:37.860 --> 00:40:42.660]   But if you only have a few pieces of property, et cetera, then I think using a scanning app
[00:40:42.660 --> 00:40:44.020]   can be fine.
[00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:49.780]   I think you should either choose to do all paper or in essence all digital and that lowers
[00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:54.020]   the resistance because I've found that having half and half didn't really work.
[00:40:54.020 --> 00:40:59.340]   At this point, I use actually a scanner and I use a pretty fancy scanner.
[00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:01.660]   The one that I use is – and it's expensive.
[00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:03.940]   It's 400-something bucks if you buy it new.
[00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:15.060]   But I use a scanner called a ScanSnap iX500 made by Fujitsu and it is probably the – it's
[00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:21.020]   a pretty Cadillac scanner that is appropriate for all kinds of different things.
[00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:26.220]   It's a duplex scanner which means it will scan front and back of any document simultaneously.
[00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:27.220]   It's very fast.
[00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:35.460]   I think it's rated for 25 pages a minute and it can be used to scan a variety of media.
[00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:36.820]   It can scan receipts.
[00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:39.700]   It can scan – it can scan receipts.
[00:41:39.700 --> 00:41:40.940]   It can scan papers.
[00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:43.860]   It can scan stacks of random things.
[00:41:43.860 --> 00:41:49.620]   And so what I have done is more and more, I've gone ahead and committed to doing things
[00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:51.660]   largely digital.
[00:41:51.660 --> 00:41:57.500]   And so I use it for records and I keep just a simple foldering system.
[00:41:57.500 --> 00:42:02.140]   I prefer not to back things up in the cloud for greater security.
[00:42:02.140 --> 00:42:06.920]   I have good backup systems that aren't – so I'm not worried about the cloud on the backup.
[00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:13.580]   So I just keep a foldering system and a file system in for each of my assets.
[00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:19.500]   So if there is a – if it's my car or if it's a house or something like that, I make
[00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:24.540]   a separate folder for it and then I scan all of the documents into it and I just simply
[00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:27.740]   – I don't worry too much about organization.
[00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:31.380]   In general, you can get so bogged down trying to organize something perfectly that there's
[00:42:31.380 --> 00:42:32.420]   no need for it.
[00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:37.060]   For the average car, if you have 20 or 30 files in a folder, you don't need to do
[00:42:37.060 --> 00:42:38.260]   any major organization.
[00:42:38.260 --> 00:42:42.780]   You can look through those and figure out when you replace the transmission fluid if
[00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:45.020]   you have to and it only takes a few minutes.
[00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:49.180]   So just simply setting up a simple file, simple foldering system.
[00:42:49.180 --> 00:42:52.620]   What I do is I just simply use a dated system.
[00:42:52.620 --> 00:42:59.840]   So for any file, I use a date system that will be sortable on date of year, month, day.
[00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:10.620]   So as I – if we record this in 2017, it would be 20170713 and then the name of what
[00:43:10.620 --> 00:43:13.980]   it was and a quick description in the title.
[00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:20.300]   The fancy scanner like the Fujitsu ScanSnap makes it so easy to scan these things, put
[00:43:20.300 --> 00:43:24.140]   the file name in, drop it into that, that it makes it super, super simple.
[00:43:24.140 --> 00:43:27.020]   So I love it and that's what I use.
[00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:28.900]   So I organize things around the asset.
[00:43:28.900 --> 00:43:31.540]   If it's a home purchase, just organize things there.
[00:43:31.540 --> 00:43:36.340]   Then if it's financial records, then that should be organized in the accounting software.
[00:43:36.340 --> 00:43:40.260]   Either use – I use YNAB for personal stuff.
[00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:42.540]   You can organize things effectively enough in YNAB.
[00:43:42.540 --> 00:43:44.220]   I use hashtags.
[00:43:44.220 --> 00:43:46.500]   So I have a Toyota Sienna minivan.
[00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:50.900]   So #ToyotaSienna, if anything is related to that.
[00:43:50.900 --> 00:43:52.740]   That makes it easily searchable.
[00:43:52.740 --> 00:43:57.300]   And then if it's more complex than that, then you can go ahead and use bookkeeping
[00:43:57.300 --> 00:43:58.300]   software.
[00:43:58.300 --> 00:44:02.860]   So something like QuickBooks makes it very simple for you to associate a scanned receipt
[00:44:02.860 --> 00:44:06.940]   with the actual file.
[00:44:06.940 --> 00:44:11.780]   I found that for me, I struggled with it being cheap for a long time of not wanting to get
[00:44:11.780 --> 00:44:12.780]   a scanner.
[00:44:12.780 --> 00:44:17.260]   Finally, I just said, "No, I've got to have a good scanner," and I use it for basically
[00:44:17.260 --> 00:44:18.260]   everything.
[00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:22.780]   I use my ScanSnap for – I scan all my books.
[00:44:22.780 --> 00:44:26.140]   For example, when I read a book, I like to read books in paper and mark them up.
[00:44:26.140 --> 00:44:27.580]   But then at the end of it, I destroy them.
[00:44:27.580 --> 00:44:30.220]   I pull the bindings apart, toss them in the ScanSnap.
[00:44:30.220 --> 00:44:32.460]   In probably about 10 minutes, I can scan the book.
[00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:34.460]   That way I have a permanent digital archive of it.
[00:44:34.460 --> 00:44:38.140]   I don't have to keep the paper version of it.
[00:44:38.140 --> 00:44:42.060]   I have a permanent digital archive that contains all my notes, all of my emphasis, et cetera.
[00:44:42.060 --> 00:44:43.060]   It does color.
[00:44:43.060 --> 00:44:44.060]   It does black and white.
[00:44:44.060 --> 00:44:46.460]   So I find it really useful for that.
[00:44:46.460 --> 00:44:47.500]   And then also records.
[00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:50.120]   You can just put stacks of records together and do it.
[00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:55.340]   So I have found that having a good scanner has been well worth it for me to simplify
[00:44:55.340 --> 00:44:56.340]   things.
[00:44:56.340 --> 00:45:00.340]   So one of those systems can be created, and I think those are just – that's how I do
[00:45:00.340 --> 00:45:02.220]   it, and those are my simple ideas for it.
[00:45:02.220 --> 00:45:03.580]   How do you do it, John?
[00:45:03.580 --> 00:45:04.580]   And what ideas do you have?
[00:45:04.580 --> 00:45:05.580]   John Cramer No, I appreciate that.
[00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:06.580]   Those are all good ideas.
[00:45:06.580 --> 00:45:14.420]   I think you've kind of helped me isolate – what my problem is, it's a balance between paper
[00:45:14.420 --> 00:45:22.180]   and tech and then a balance between asset filing versus sort of like a time – you
[00:45:22.180 --> 00:45:28.380]   said you primarily keep it by asset, and then within that asset, you have kind of a dated
[00:45:28.380 --> 00:45:29.380]   structure.
[00:45:29.380 --> 00:45:33.740]   I kind of tend to go all or nothing one way or the other.
[00:45:33.740 --> 00:45:38.140]   So right now I'm in this in-between stage where I'm trying to digitize everything,
[00:45:38.140 --> 00:45:44.660]   scanning in religiously as I get the item, and then I put it into a – just every six
[00:45:44.660 --> 00:45:49.460]   months I start a new folder and put everything I purchase, all receipts, all records, whatever,
[00:45:49.460 --> 00:45:50.460]   into that linearly.
[00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:54.820]   They might get mixed up again, but you can sort through them.
[00:45:54.820 --> 00:45:59.900]   And then what I've been doing on the digital side is just hoping it has OCR and you can
[00:45:59.900 --> 00:46:06.460]   search for it that way, but OCR isn't perfect, and even things you're trying to remember
[00:46:06.460 --> 00:46:11.900]   that thing that you're trying to search, maybe it's not really listed that way on a receipt
[00:46:11.900 --> 00:46:12.900]   or a paperwork.
[00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:17.660]   And I've been getting by pretty decently with that, but overall it's just – it's kind
[00:46:17.660 --> 00:46:18.660]   of disconnected.
[00:46:18.660 --> 00:46:24.740]   And to your point about the car stuff, I think that's one of my major pain points is there's
[00:46:24.740 --> 00:46:29.860]   a separation between when I do the thing to the car and type a little email to myself
[00:46:29.860 --> 00:46:34.700]   to send it to myself, and then later I have to take that email and put it into my online
[00:46:34.700 --> 00:46:38.340]   spreadsheet where I keep track of all that stuff.
[00:46:38.340 --> 00:46:41.580]   And that little disconnect is a big problem, because sometimes it doesn't happen or it
[00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:44.060]   happens very late or I don't get all the notes in.
[00:46:44.060 --> 00:46:49.980]   So just having a little tablet in each vehicle and going kind of low-tech on that I think
[00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:54.380]   is a – I think that's a good idea.
[00:46:54.380 --> 00:46:56.020]   It keeps it where it needs to be.
[00:46:56.020 --> 00:46:59.900]   You generally don't need that information when you're away from your car.
[00:46:59.900 --> 00:47:02.900]   And even if you are away from your car, you're usually not that far away from your car if
[00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:06.340]   you're doing this other work at home and trying to do planning.
[00:47:06.340 --> 00:47:09.780]   So I think that'll help a lot, just with a simple notebook.
[00:47:09.780 --> 00:47:11.020]   Low-tech on that will help.
[00:47:11.020 --> 00:47:12.020]   So –
[00:47:12.020 --> 00:47:16.380]   Yeah, for the uninitiated, OCR stands for optical character recognition, and it's the
[00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:22.460]   function that allows you to scan a document or take a picture of it and have the computer
[00:47:22.460 --> 00:47:26.100]   translate that image into textual recognition.
[00:47:26.100 --> 00:47:28.620]   This is what most – many of us use Evernote in some capacity.
[00:47:28.620 --> 00:47:29.980]   This is what Evernote does.
[00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:33.420]   When you take a picture of a paper and it says on it "radical personal finance,"
[00:47:33.420 --> 00:47:38.500]   it allows you to come back later and search your database for "radical" and find those
[00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:40.020]   instances of it.
[00:47:40.020 --> 00:47:44.600]   My experience, John, having – being the master of creating complex systems and then
[00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:51.280]   watching them fail, I have learned that it's simple – it's important not to kind of
[00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:52.280]   overstress.
[00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:58.680]   As a simple example, I don't save receipts for anything except business expenses.
[00:47:58.680 --> 00:48:00.040]   I don't save them.
[00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:02.480]   What am I going to need a receipt for on something?
[00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:07.680]   Or possibly a big ticket item certainly is a reason to do it.
[00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:09.720]   But I don't need to save my receipts from the grocery store.
[00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:11.640]   I don't need to save any of those things.
[00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:17.200]   All I need there is to know basically how much am I spending on a monthly basis on food.
[00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:22.640]   And so as long as I have some record of that and I do, either checkbook register or program
[00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:27.880]   like you need a budget, radicalpersonalfinance.com/ynab, radicalpersonalfinance.com/ynab, you need a
[00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:28.880]   budget.
[00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:33.640]   As long as I'm using something like that, then I have the category that I need.
[00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:35.780]   And so simple is important.
[00:48:35.780 --> 00:48:40.000]   Before you design a system for something, it's most important just to eliminate steps
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:41.720]   and say, "Am I ever going to need this?"
[00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:45.640]   And in general, I found that as long as I get rid of stuff and I simplify, I don't
[00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:46.720]   need to save all these emails.
[00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:48.040]   I don't need to save all of these receipts.
[00:48:48.040 --> 00:48:50.120]   I don't need to save all these records.
[00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:52.240]   I'm probably never going to need it.
[00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:56.980]   And if I ever did need it to save on $100, well, $100 was the price I paid for having
[00:48:56.980 --> 00:48:58.840]   a simpler life.
[00:48:58.840 --> 00:49:02.760]   Similar things like saving boxes for – I bought a new monitor for my computer.
[00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:06.240]   Well, I'm not going to save the box for it just in case I ever need it.
[00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:10.440]   If I ever need it, it just – it adds too much complexity.
[00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:14.960]   So one or the other, either paper or digital works really well.
[00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:16.800]   And if you're digital, then you have the tools.
[00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:20.160]   So if you have a scanner, then that makes the tool simple enough and then you had to
[00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:24.400]   create the setup, set up the filing system, figure out where is it going to be stored,
[00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:27.840]   how is the data going to be encrypted so it's protected, and how is it going to be backed
[00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:28.840]   up.
[00:49:28.840 --> 00:49:31.600]   You've got to set that up and then follow through across the board.
[00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:34.720]   But in general, for most people, it's not that big a deal.
[00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:38.800]   If you just had a file folder for your house that you put everything – a receipt in for
[00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:43.200]   everything in your house, chances are you'd have most of the info needed.
[00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:46.800]   And then if you ever need to go back through and look at housing expenses, you just pull
[00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:50.600]   up that category in your accounting software and you cross-reference it and you can come
[00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:56.640]   close enough to solve the records needs.
[00:49:56.640 --> 00:49:58.160]   I do – I would say this.
[00:49:58.160 --> 00:50:01.800]   I struggled for years with trying to use the phone as a scanner.
[00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:02.800]   I was an early adopter.
[00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:05.720]   I always used the JotNot scanning app.
[00:50:05.720 --> 00:50:07.080]   JotNot Pro is what I used.
[00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:11.040]   It worked great on my phone for years with my iPhone.
[00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:14.640]   But it is nothing like having an actual scanner.
[00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:20.480]   And today, if I had the choice, I'd get the cheapest smartphone or get a dumb phone
[00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:25.280]   and get a scanner rather than trying to integrate it into the phone.
[00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:30.000]   Scanning with a phone is so frustrating to do because of all the problems with now how
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:33.680]   do I get the document onto the hard drive, how do I name it, et cetera.
[00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:39.040]   So I highly recommend pick up a good quick duplex scanner and it's worth it.
[00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:41.000]   That's a good tip.
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:42.000]   Thank you.
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:43.000]   I appreciate that.
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:44.000]   For sure.
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:47.240]   Someday I should probably do more and try to organize the system better.
[00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:48.240]   But that's what I do.
[00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:49.240]   All right.
[00:50:49.240 --> 00:50:51.040]   Finally, Andy, you're up.
[00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:52.040]   Welcome to the show.
[00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:53.040]   Let me know your question, please.
[00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:54.040]   Hi, Joshua.
[00:50:54.040 --> 00:50:59.360]   I just wanted to maybe kind of get a little more detail on some of the things you've said
[00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:07.000]   about insurance purchasing in the past and then your opinion on whether there is any
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:10.840]   value in what that is of having a local agent versus not having a local agent.
[00:51:10.840 --> 00:51:11.840]   Okay.
[00:51:11.840 --> 00:51:12.840]   Tell me more.
[00:51:12.840 --> 00:51:19.440]   So specifically with the agent thing, I don't want to be necessarily asking brand recommendations.
[00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:22.280]   I'll try not to say brands unless you want me to.
[00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:29.320]   But I've always had car insurance, home insurance, all that through a local agent, you know,
[00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:33.240]   a person that I knew that I went in and I sat down and talked with.
[00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:37.920]   And I've never used any of my insurance, but I've always been happy with the agents.
[00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:42.680]   They seem knowledgeable and helpful and willing to go over things with me.
[00:51:42.680 --> 00:51:49.560]   And I've recently compared just car insurance with some of the online you can buy, you know,
[00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:50.560]   direct online.
[00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:55.080]   And I could save a couple hundred dollars just on car insurance, you know, and not counting
[00:51:55.080 --> 00:51:58.440]   homeowners and all the other things I have insurance on.
[00:51:58.440 --> 00:52:04.360]   And one of my big hangups on that is the idea of leaving a local agent and not having that
[00:52:04.360 --> 00:52:05.360]   person I could go talk to.
[00:52:05.360 --> 00:52:11.320]   And just wondered if, in your opinion, there's value to that or, you know, kind of what your
[00:52:11.320 --> 00:52:12.320]   thoughts on that.
[00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:13.320]   Yeah.
[00:52:13.320 --> 00:52:14.320]   All right.
[00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:15.320]   So I understand more.
[00:52:15.320 --> 00:52:16.320]   So I think the value is good.
[00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:18.680]   So it's going to depend on the type of insurance.
[00:52:18.680 --> 00:52:24.480]   Let's start with property and casualty insurance, car insurance, homeowners insurance, et cetera.
[00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:30.020]   I think there is value in a local agent if you can find one that meets your needs and
[00:52:30.020 --> 00:52:31.440]   does a good job.
[00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:36.080]   I think there's also value sometimes in working with companies that don't have local agents.
[00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:40.040]   And I don't know of a grand way to understand the difference.
[00:52:40.040 --> 00:52:43.480]   My experience was I grew up – my dad was always a USAA member.
[00:52:43.480 --> 00:52:48.680]   And USAA is an insurance company that only does business with military personnel.
[00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:53.240]   And they have a significant degree of brand loyalty because in most things they've done
[00:52:53.240 --> 00:52:54.420]   a good job.
[00:52:54.420 --> 00:52:58.920]   And then – so I just got – I got my car insurance with USAA because I was on my dad's
[00:52:58.920 --> 00:53:00.440]   policy for years and I got my own.
[00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:03.400]   I was like, "Well, I'll just stick with USAA."
[00:53:03.400 --> 00:53:09.200]   And so it wasn't – in general, if my dad had done his business with a local state farm
[00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:12.520]   agent, then I probably would have just gone with the local state farm agent just like
[00:53:12.520 --> 00:53:14.480]   many people do.
[00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:17.640]   And most of us, that's the biggest influence.
[00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:21.800]   I was always comfortable not having somebody local because I just grew up never having
[00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:22.920]   someone local.
[00:53:22.920 --> 00:53:24.440]   Same thing with local banking.
[00:53:24.440 --> 00:53:26.600]   I've never banked with a local bank.
[00:53:26.600 --> 00:53:28.400]   I've had a count here and there.
[00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:31.960]   But as far as primary banking, I've never had a bank that I could walk into and work
[00:53:31.960 --> 00:53:33.640]   with a banker.
[00:53:33.640 --> 00:53:39.760]   And so I'm – but I'm a point – I'm at a generational approach where I'm comfortable
[00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:42.000]   not having that.
[00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:47.840]   I think the first thing that matters is whenever possible to work with a company that's going
[00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:51.100]   to be excellent for the type of insurance that you're looking for.
[00:53:51.100 --> 00:53:55.800]   So in property and casualty insurance, there are two mutual insurance companies that have
[00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:56.920]   often had good ranks.
[00:53:56.920 --> 00:53:58.360]   One was USAA.
[00:53:58.360 --> 00:54:02.700]   Another that's often been leading is a company called Amica Mutual.
[00:54:02.700 --> 00:54:06.080]   They often are well-ranked in terms of their customer service.
[00:54:06.080 --> 00:54:10.640]   And when it comes to actually filing a claim, I've seen personally with my experience
[00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:16.300]   with USAA on car insurance claims how nice it is to work with a company that just seems
[00:54:16.300 --> 00:54:19.840]   to want to do the right thing and care for their policy owners.
[00:54:19.840 --> 00:54:25.640]   I'm biased whenever possible to work with a mutual insurance company as compared to
[00:54:25.640 --> 00:54:31.240]   a stock insurance company because I have had experience formerly working with Northwestern
[00:54:31.240 --> 00:54:34.680]   Mutual that there's just – the culture was different, that there was more of a sense
[00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:35.840]   of camaraderie.
[00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:39.040]   So I'd rather bank with a credit union than with a profit-seeking bank.
[00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:43.360]   I'd rather have my insurance with a mutual insurance company than with a stock insurance
[00:54:43.360 --> 00:54:44.360]   company.
[00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:47.040]   So to me, that's where I start.
[00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:51.520]   The problem is what do you do if insurance is not available?
[00:54:51.520 --> 00:54:59.560]   When I owned a home a few years ago, USAA does not write coverage for houses in Florida
[00:54:59.560 --> 00:55:03.480]   because of the – just the hurricane situation.
[00:55:03.480 --> 00:55:09.240]   The whole Florida homeowners insurance market is a disaster.
[00:55:09.240 --> 00:55:12.360]   It's been – it's a disaster.
[00:55:12.360 --> 00:55:19.520]   The government regulators have screwed the whole thing up by – and destroyed free market
[00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:20.520]   competition.
[00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:24.440]   So basically we have the state-run option and we have a few startup local insurance
[00:55:24.440 --> 00:55:28.000]   companies that basically cancel your policy every year and you shop for insurance every
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:29.160]   year or two.
[00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:33.240]   So in that context, I had no idea where to start and I called company after company that
[00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:34.240]   was national.
[00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:35.240]   No, sorry.
[00:55:35.240 --> 00:55:36.240]   We don't do business in Florida.
[00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:40.640]   The only thing I had to do – the only place I had to start was to work with a local agent
[00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:45.080]   because there was value in that specialized localized knowledge.
[00:55:45.080 --> 00:55:50.340]   So in that case, the specialized localized local knowledge trumped the value of any particular
[00:55:50.340 --> 00:55:55.240]   brand name and I worked with these no-name insurance companies that I had never heard
[00:55:55.240 --> 00:56:00.600]   of that were local that I had no confidence in from a customer service representative
[00:56:00.600 --> 00:56:05.080]   but I was required to have insurance and that was – they were the only people that could
[00:56:05.080 --> 00:56:06.260]   offer it.
[00:56:06.260 --> 00:56:09.360]   So it's very subjective.
[00:56:09.360 --> 00:56:12.560]   I think you are better served by working with an agent.
[00:56:12.560 --> 00:56:14.040]   Here's how the insurance works.
[00:56:14.040 --> 00:56:19.920]   A lot of times you can buy insurance directly from the national company or you can work
[00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:23.920]   with somebody locally who can write it with the national company and your actual premium
[00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:26.760]   payment is going to be identical between those two.
[00:56:26.760 --> 00:56:31.240]   But if you work with somebody local, you're going to have somebody who can sit down and
[00:56:31.240 --> 00:56:33.960]   integrate your coverage and who can review them.
[00:56:33.960 --> 00:56:38.820]   And as your financial situation is more complex, that's more and more valuable.
[00:56:38.820 --> 00:56:43.600]   You want to make sure that your liability limitations on your car insurance are properly
[00:56:43.600 --> 00:56:48.680]   aligned with your homeowner's insurance and you want your umbrella liability policy
[00:56:48.680 --> 00:56:51.680]   to go right on top of those so you don't have any gaps.
[00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:55.580]   You're not going to get that with a customer service rep just on the phone.
[00:56:55.580 --> 00:57:00.640]   So if you can work with somebody locally that's going to be knowledgeable, why not?
[00:57:00.640 --> 00:57:02.520]   I'd rather do that.
[00:57:02.520 --> 00:57:06.080]   The other thing – comment I've made was something like life insurance.
[00:57:06.080 --> 00:57:07.840]   Same thing applies with life insurance.
[00:57:07.840 --> 00:57:13.000]   If you work with a local agent, you're going to pay exactly the same premium as working
[00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:15.480]   with somebody that you find on the internet.
[00:57:15.480 --> 00:57:20.920]   Banner Life Insurance Company charges the same premium to a 45-year-old male non-tobacco
[00:57:20.920 --> 00:57:25.000]   of somebody who buys it through a website, lifeinsurance.com or whatever the website
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:29.000]   of the day is versus somebody who works with the local insurance agent.
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:37.280]   It's just a matter of who gets the commission, the life insurance agent locally or the website.
[00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:42.040]   Well, after spending years writing life insurance, if your premium is going to be for your term
[00:57:42.040 --> 00:57:49.160]   insurance is going to be $600 a year, my commission from Banner Insurance is going to be $500
[00:57:49.160 --> 00:57:50.160]   to sit down with you.
[00:57:50.160 --> 00:57:55.000]   I'll come and sit down with you for a couple of hours and work with you in exchange for
[00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:59.640]   earning a $500 commission and I'll give you good advice on your life insurance program
[00:57:59.640 --> 00:58:00.640]   and we'll help you figure it out.
[00:58:00.640 --> 00:58:04.000]   It's going to be a lot less frustrating than a national website.
[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:07.920]   So I think there is value in working with a local agent.
[00:58:07.920 --> 00:58:12.640]   There is value in working with somebody who's an expert in your area and a newly trained
[00:58:12.640 --> 00:58:16.960]   customer service rep is generally not going to be able to provide the same service as
[00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:20.960]   somebody you can sit down in their office with, especially if someone's a member of
[00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:23.440]   the community, a long-term member of the community.
[00:58:23.440 --> 00:58:28.000]   But it's good to keep those people honest and it's good to price things yourself.
[00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:32.080]   So if you go online and you do a pricing and you price things out and you quote your insurance
[00:58:32.080 --> 00:58:35.320]   with Geico, go down to your local agent and say, "Hey, I quoted it with Geico.
[00:58:35.320 --> 00:58:36.360]   What can you do?"
[00:58:36.360 --> 00:58:42.120]   My experience has been I've never was in a situation when I was a local insurance agent.
[00:58:42.120 --> 00:58:47.680]   I was never in a situation where I was ever scared of an online quote because they didn't
[00:58:47.680 --> 00:58:50.000]   have anything that I don't have.
[00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:54.280]   They didn't have anything, any access to somebody that I didn't have.
[00:58:54.280 --> 00:59:00.080]   And even if I was going to be a little bit more, I knew why it was going to be a little
[00:59:00.080 --> 00:59:03.320]   bit more and I could just say, "Hey, here's why this company that I'm recommending is
[00:59:03.320 --> 00:59:07.260]   a little bit more and that's – and here's why I would recommend it."
[00:59:07.260 --> 00:59:10.400]   I don't try to buy the cheapest insurance I can get.
[00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:13.600]   Not that I'm opposed to it, it doesn't matter.
[00:59:13.600 --> 00:59:18.480]   But when you need insurance payment on something like your house or your car, you don't want
[00:59:18.480 --> 00:59:20.280]   to get into a fight with the insurance company.
[00:59:20.280 --> 00:59:22.080]   You want your claim paid.
[00:59:22.080 --> 00:59:24.960]   And a lot of times that's going to have to do with the quality of the company.
[00:59:24.960 --> 00:59:26.400]   All right.
[00:59:26.400 --> 00:59:28.400]   That's really helpful.
[00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:36.480]   I think that basically answers that part of my question and I think you were hinting at
[00:59:36.480 --> 00:59:38.800]   kind of the second part.
[00:59:38.800 --> 00:59:45.360]   So I've always worked with basically a company representative of a specific company, such
[00:59:45.360 --> 00:59:47.760]   and such insurance company office.
[00:59:47.760 --> 00:59:54.760]   Am I correct that there are also insurance agents out there that are more like – I
[00:59:54.760 --> 00:59:58.640]   don't know if freelancer is the right term, but I could go to and they could say, "Well,
[00:59:58.640 --> 00:59:59.640]   independent, yes.
[00:59:59.640 --> 01:00:03.280]   Here's the rate you can get from this company and that company and because you're such
[01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:06.680]   and such, this company would be better for you.
[01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:10.880]   Is that an option and is that a better option in your opinion?"
[01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:16.720]   So I think the reason people have these questions like you is because you probably feel a personal
[01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:21.760]   loyalty to the person that you're working with and you don't want to appear like you're
[01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:25.320]   being disloyal by talking about quotes and things like that.
[01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:31.000]   I always have that personal hesitation.
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.720]   I don't want to disappoint my friends.
[01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:37.480]   I don't want to cause problems for the people that I'm working with.
[01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:41.200]   But I would encourage you that this person is a professional and they work for you.
[01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:42.520]   So ask the questions.
[01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:46.440]   There's no reason why you can't ask a question.
[01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:51.440]   From having come from the sales world and insurance sales, I always knew that if I was
[01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:56.280]   going to lose a case or if I were going to lose a customer, I wanted to know why because
[01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:59.160]   probably I know more about it than my customer did.
[01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:02.760]   But I would be so frustrated if somebody – you get a replacement notice if someone is replacing
[01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:08.000]   your policy in life insurance and similar things I'm sure with property and casualty
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.000]   insurance.
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:12.640]   I would always be frustrated if I saw – look, I placed so-and-so with a good company and
[01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:16.560]   I look down and I get a replacement notice for the policy that I sold them that was appropriate
[01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:22.760]   to them and now we're going with a piece of junk company that's $5 a month cheaper.
[01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:29.260]   I can sell somebody on why the $5 a month is more valuable and be right about it.
[01:01:29.260 --> 01:01:32.620]   So I think you should always talk with the people that you're working with and tell
[01:01:32.620 --> 01:01:34.060]   them what you're doing.
[01:01:34.060 --> 01:01:38.740]   Tell them, "Oh, I'm quoting – if you're working with a local legacy company where
[01:01:38.740 --> 01:01:42.500]   their agent is a captive agent," here's the terminology, called a captive agent where
[01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:45.880]   they can only write business with that specific company.
[01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:48.220]   Tell them, "Hey, I'm quoting my insurance around.
[01:01:48.220 --> 01:01:50.660]   I've gotten quotes from so-and-so.
[01:01:50.660 --> 01:01:52.040]   Why should I stay with you?"
[01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:54.140]   Just ask them the question.
[01:01:54.140 --> 01:01:55.140]   They're professionals.
[01:01:55.140 --> 01:01:56.140]   They can handle it.
[01:01:56.140 --> 01:01:57.140]   They're big boys and girls.
[01:01:57.140 --> 01:01:59.020]   They can handle it.
[01:01:59.020 --> 01:02:01.900]   It's always a good idea to collect quotes.
[01:02:01.900 --> 01:02:07.900]   It's always a good idea to talk to an independent agent and inquire with a local company and
[01:02:07.900 --> 01:02:11.100]   say, "Hey, can we quote a few different companies?"
[01:02:11.100 --> 01:02:12.540]   It's always a good idea.
[01:02:12.540 --> 01:02:17.940]   The trick is in order to make it worthwhile, go back to the professionals that you're
[01:02:17.940 --> 01:02:19.060]   working with.
[01:02:19.060 --> 01:02:25.860]   Tell them your competitive quote because often there are a lot of unethical people who will
[01:02:25.860 --> 01:02:28.460]   quote something but they're quoted under different terms.
[01:02:28.460 --> 01:02:29.460]   Let's take this example.
[01:02:29.460 --> 01:02:33.700]   You come in and your legacy company that you're with right now, you have a million dollars
[01:02:33.700 --> 01:02:38.980]   of liability coverage but you go online and they quote you at $100,000 of liability coverage.
[01:02:38.980 --> 01:02:41.300]   Well, of course your policy is cheaper.
[01:02:41.300 --> 01:02:45.500]   It's cheaper because it has different terms and there's almost no insurance, especially
[01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:51.420]   property and casualty and many kinds of life insurance, disability insurance, et cetera.
[01:02:51.420 --> 01:02:53.860]   You can't compare it one to another.
[01:02:53.860 --> 01:02:57.140]   About the only thing you can do that is compare it with a straight 20-year term life insurance
[01:02:57.140 --> 01:02:58.140]   policy.
[01:02:58.140 --> 01:02:59.500]   You can't quote on price.
[01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:03.020]   Everything else is based on features and the agent needs to see the quote.
[01:03:03.020 --> 01:03:04.340]   So go and get the quotes.
[01:03:04.340 --> 01:03:07.140]   Get it from the legacy company where you have a good relationship with.
[01:03:07.140 --> 01:03:10.780]   Get it from the independent company where they're quoting with a couple of people and
[01:03:10.780 --> 01:03:11.900]   then compare them one another.
[01:03:11.900 --> 01:03:14.900]   Show each other the quotes and ask them, "Why should I stick with it?"
[01:03:14.900 --> 01:03:16.820]   Then be open to their answer.
[01:03:16.820 --> 01:03:18.120]   Cheaper is not always better.
[01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:22.620]   You often get what you pay for in most things, including in insurance coverage.
[01:03:22.620 --> 01:03:23.620]   Okay.
[01:03:23.620 --> 01:03:27.900]   So, yeah, that makes a lot of sense.
[01:03:27.900 --> 01:03:32.540]   I guess what you're saying earlier when you're talking about the local agent versus the website,
[01:03:32.540 --> 01:03:38.140]   I guess my thought had been when you go with a company that is largely web-based and doesn't
[01:03:38.140 --> 01:03:43.140]   have local offices, the fact that there is two or three people sitting in a building
[01:03:43.140 --> 01:03:51.900]   40 hours a week would be a big reason why online company A could be cheaper than brick
[01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:58.340]   and mortar company B. Would it be reasonable to expect that that's true or not?
[01:03:58.340 --> 01:03:59.340]   I think absolutely.
[01:03:59.340 --> 01:04:03.420]   There are a lot of companies that have made their business working online and because
[01:04:03.420 --> 01:04:06.340]   it's cheaper, they can offer cheaper policies.
[01:04:06.340 --> 01:04:10.500]   But this very much depends on the type of insurance and on what's available.
[01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:12.500]   I'll give you an example.
[01:04:12.500 --> 01:04:14.860]   I bought a motorhome a year or two ago.
[01:04:14.860 --> 01:04:18.220]   I've since sold it this year and I needed insurance for it.
[01:04:18.220 --> 01:04:23.100]   Well, I paid cash for it and I didn't care about having the value of it covered.
[01:04:23.100 --> 01:04:27.780]   I just wanted some strict liability insurance that would allow me to drive it legally.
[01:04:27.780 --> 01:04:31.540]   But all I cared about was inexpensive liability insurance.
[01:04:31.540 --> 01:04:33.620]   I didn't need big coverages, et cetera.
[01:04:33.620 --> 01:04:36.780]   I just needed inexpensive liability insurance so that I could drive the thing on the road
[01:04:36.780 --> 01:04:37.780]   legally.
[01:04:37.780 --> 01:04:43.580]   I quoted it with USAA and my premiums came out to like $60, $70 a month that they quoted
[01:04:43.580 --> 01:04:46.540]   for my motorhome.
[01:04:46.540 --> 01:04:51.980]   Progressive is well-known for having some of the cheapest insurance coverage for RVs.
[01:04:51.980 --> 01:04:57.060]   So I quoted it with Progressive and they gave me just simple liability insurance for $12
[01:04:57.060 --> 01:04:58.060]   a month.
[01:04:58.060 --> 01:05:01.060]   So I was able to have the coverage for $12 a month.
[01:05:01.060 --> 01:05:04.860]   Well, I couldn't see any reason or benefit why I wouldn't just go with the cheapest place
[01:05:04.860 --> 01:05:08.660]   in that one because I wanted something that was very simple and I wanted something – I
[01:05:08.660 --> 01:05:12.460]   was just going for strict liability coverage.
[01:05:12.460 --> 01:05:18.300]   So in that case, Progressive was a company that they're known for providing cheap RV
[01:05:18.300 --> 01:05:19.300]   insurance.
[01:05:19.300 --> 01:05:21.340]   That's a segment of the market that they've gone after.
[01:05:21.340 --> 01:05:26.060]   So you want to work with them for RV insurance.
[01:05:26.060 --> 01:05:29.580]   That's very different than something else.
[01:05:29.580 --> 01:05:33.540]   Insurance companies all have a different market segment where they want to be competitive.
[01:05:33.540 --> 01:05:37.820]   Another example, I'm just using companies that I know where I can speak to because of
[01:05:37.820 --> 01:05:40.140]   personal experience.
[01:05:40.140 --> 01:05:43.980]   There are – like USAA does homeowners insurance in some places but there are certain kinds
[01:05:43.980 --> 01:05:49.000]   of houses that USAA doesn't want to have and sometimes they want high-end houses.
[01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:50.740]   Sometimes they want low-end houses.
[01:05:50.740 --> 01:05:56.660]   So each company with something that's peculiar to a property in casualty, each company will
[01:05:56.660 --> 01:06:01.260]   choose this is the type of person that we want as an insured and they'll often price
[01:06:01.260 --> 01:06:05.060]   their policies out of the market for someone else.
[01:06:05.060 --> 01:06:09.380]   So that's where you need an expert if possible who can look and say, "Do you fall into
[01:06:09.380 --> 01:06:13.380]   one of these situations or are you buying a commodity product?"
[01:06:13.380 --> 01:06:18.500]   And there's no general way to answer it other than research.
[01:06:18.500 --> 01:06:21.400]   There are only specific ways of application.
[01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:24.380]   One more example to build my point.
[01:06:24.380 --> 01:06:29.260]   I mentioned a moment ago that about the closest thing that comes to a commodity product is
[01:06:29.260 --> 01:06:32.540]   term life insurance, simple level term life insurance.
[01:06:32.540 --> 01:06:37.380]   In many ways, a 10-year level term life insurance company from company A is the same as company
[01:06:37.380 --> 01:06:39.140]   B is the same as company C.
[01:06:39.140 --> 01:06:42.740]   There are a few differences but it's as close to a commodity as you can get in the
[01:06:42.740 --> 01:06:44.580]   life insurance business.
[01:06:44.580 --> 01:06:48.420]   That applies if you're healthy and you don't smoke.
[01:06:48.420 --> 01:06:51.840]   But it doesn't apply if you smoke cigars.
[01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:54.900]   If you smoke cigars, you immediately go into a question, "Well, how many cigars do you
[01:06:54.900 --> 01:06:55.900]   smoke?"
[01:06:55.900 --> 01:06:59.100]   And there are some companies where if you smoke over a certain number of cigars, they're
[01:06:59.100 --> 01:07:00.660]   going to give you tobacco rates.
[01:07:00.660 --> 01:07:04.180]   There are other companies where you can smoke an unlimited number of cigars but as long
[01:07:04.180 --> 01:07:06.860]   as you don't smoke cigarettes, you can get non-tobacco rates.
[01:07:06.860 --> 01:07:11.340]   And so it's only going to be an experienced life insurance agent who's going to know that
[01:07:11.340 --> 01:07:15.460]   answer and you can't know it as a consumer by reading a website.
[01:07:15.460 --> 01:07:22.940]   The teaser website at lifeinsurance.com is going to say, "A 45-year-old healthy male
[01:07:22.940 --> 01:07:25.560]   can get insurance for $15 a month."
[01:07:25.560 --> 01:07:30.940]   But it's only the agent who's going to know, "Well, how many cigars do you smoke?"
[01:07:30.940 --> 01:07:35.780]   In that case, I need to put you over here with Prudential because they're cheaper.
[01:07:35.780 --> 01:07:37.740]   They're not $15 a month.
[01:07:37.740 --> 01:07:40.400]   It's going to be $17 a month but it's non-tobacco rates.
[01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:45.380]   If we applied with the company that you saw the advertisement for, it'd be $30 a month.
[01:07:45.380 --> 01:07:48.380]   Same thing with anytime there's health risks.
[01:07:48.380 --> 01:07:50.580]   Every company has something that they've chosen.
[01:07:50.580 --> 01:07:54.060]   So if somebody has a history of heart disease or history of cancer or they've had certain
[01:07:54.060 --> 01:07:58.260]   medical conditions or they have diabetes or hypertension, that's where the expert pays
[01:07:58.260 --> 01:07:59.260]   off.
[01:07:59.260 --> 01:08:03.780]   So I don't know how to define that for the layperson in advance and say, "Always use
[01:08:03.780 --> 01:08:06.460]   online or always use local."
[01:08:06.460 --> 01:08:13.160]   I do know that you should try both or all and constantly shop your coverages but tell
[01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:17.660]   the professionals what you're doing and let them work to earn your business.
[01:08:17.660 --> 01:08:18.660]   Okay.
[01:08:18.660 --> 01:08:20.340]   That's really helpful.
[01:08:20.340 --> 01:08:26.340]   So I think the advice I'm hearing is just, you know, if I'm looking to understand whether
[01:08:26.340 --> 01:08:30.980]   I'm getting good value and whether there's better value to be had, maybe get a few online
[01:08:30.980 --> 01:08:36.820]   quotes for especially things like auto insurance that are heavy online and then try to find
[01:08:36.820 --> 01:08:42.820]   a independent insurance agent in my area and just go to them and get a couple quotes from
[01:08:42.820 --> 01:08:48.420]   them and then take that back and compare with the legacy agent that I've been working with.
[01:08:48.420 --> 01:08:51.100]   Is that a good summary of your advice?
[01:08:51.100 --> 01:08:52.100]   Right.
[01:08:52.100 --> 01:08:54.620]   Don't discount somebody from a large company.
[01:08:54.620 --> 01:08:56.780]   Don't discount them for two reasons.
[01:08:56.780 --> 01:08:58.620]   One, they have experience.
[01:08:58.620 --> 01:08:59.620]   They know what they're doing.
[01:08:59.620 --> 01:09:02.380]   There's a reason the company is large.
[01:09:02.380 --> 01:09:05.020]   They probably provide a good product at a good rate.
[01:09:05.020 --> 01:09:08.820]   They can't make it if they don't provide decent rates.
[01:09:08.820 --> 01:09:12.900]   Now, you may not be in their target demographic so you might have an expensive policy from
[01:09:12.900 --> 01:09:16.780]   that company but there's probably a reason why they're big and they're well-known.
[01:09:16.780 --> 01:09:22.260]   Number two is just because an agent has a certain name of a company on their business
[01:09:22.260 --> 01:09:25.860]   card doesn't mean they don't have access to other companies.
[01:09:25.860 --> 01:09:29.740]   As an example, when I was a Northwestern Mutual agent, my business card said Northwestern
[01:09:29.740 --> 01:09:35.540]   Mutual but I was licensed with and appointed with 30 or 40 different life insurance companies
[01:09:35.540 --> 01:09:38.100]   and I could write business with any of those companies.
[01:09:38.100 --> 01:09:40.940]   So it wasn't only Northwestern Mutual.
[01:09:40.940 --> 01:09:42.180]   I could write a banner policy.
[01:09:42.180 --> 01:09:43.340]   I could write a prudential policy.
[01:09:43.340 --> 01:09:46.180]   I could write MetLife and often did.
[01:09:46.180 --> 01:09:51.620]   So sometimes you may not know that just because the person's business card that may or may
[01:09:51.620 --> 01:09:57.680]   not captive, the word captive agent means different things in different contexts.
[01:09:57.680 --> 01:09:59.980]   So that would be my answer.
[01:09:59.980 --> 01:10:01.260]   All right.
[01:10:01.260 --> 01:10:02.420]   Last question, Matthew.
[01:10:02.420 --> 01:10:06.300]   You said that I'm going to come back to you and give you a chance to ask one more question.
[01:10:06.300 --> 01:10:08.460]   Before you said you wanted to talk about books.
[01:10:08.460 --> 01:10:12.820]   So the question you said you were going to ask me before I hit record was what three
[01:10:12.820 --> 01:10:17.580]   books would I take to – is this the Desert Island scenario?
[01:10:17.580 --> 01:10:21.580]   Is that the question that you wanted to ask?
[01:10:21.580 --> 01:10:22.580]   Absolutely.
[01:10:22.580 --> 01:10:23.580]   Yeah.
[01:10:23.580 --> 01:10:25.700]   It's kind of a fun question to end on.
[01:10:25.700 --> 01:10:29.680]   If you could only have three books to read for the rest of your life, which three would
[01:10:29.680 --> 01:10:30.980]   you choose and why?
[01:10:30.980 --> 01:10:31.980]   Okay.
[01:10:31.980 --> 01:10:33.780]   So first, what would you pick?
[01:10:33.780 --> 01:10:36.380]   Because I got to think for a moment.
[01:10:36.380 --> 01:10:38.180]   Do you have your answer figured out?
[01:10:38.180 --> 01:10:41.820]   Oh, that's a great question.
[01:10:41.820 --> 01:10:42.820]   Wow.
[01:10:42.820 --> 01:10:44.860]   That's tough.
[01:10:44.860 --> 01:10:51.500]   So I guess to frame it a little bit better would be in our current society because obviously
[01:10:51.500 --> 01:10:55.660]   if I were on a desert island, then I would want books applicable to that scenario to
[01:10:55.660 --> 01:10:57.580]   teach me how to live on a desert island.
[01:10:57.580 --> 01:11:03.380]   So let's just say in our current scenario and in our current culture, given everything,
[01:11:03.380 --> 01:11:07.260]   if I can only have three books – let's see here.
[01:11:07.260 --> 01:11:08.260]   All right.
[01:11:08.260 --> 01:11:12.780]   So I'll take it because I've been kind of – I've been pondering it and if you
[01:11:12.780 --> 01:11:15.100]   have any ideas, you want to add in a moment.
[01:11:15.100 --> 01:11:19.980]   So it's an interesting question and it's fun to talk about.
[01:11:19.980 --> 01:11:22.660]   And of course in a way, I would say I don't know.
[01:11:22.660 --> 01:11:27.060]   But I'm going to picture this as I fell off of an airplane into the desert island
[01:11:27.060 --> 01:11:28.140]   scenario.
[01:11:28.140 --> 01:11:33.700]   Because just for the constraint of it, here's conceptually what I would answer.
[01:11:33.700 --> 01:11:39.060]   You need to have an idea of – we need to have something that would be helpful in the
[01:11:39.060 --> 01:11:42.080]   context of culture.
[01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:44.180]   How do you establish and build culture?
[01:11:44.180 --> 01:11:49.260]   You need to have something that would be helpful in terms of practical living.
[01:11:49.260 --> 01:11:51.260]   How do we keep ourselves alive?
[01:11:51.260 --> 01:11:55.060]   And we need to have something that would be helpful in the context of science and how
[01:11:55.060 --> 01:12:02.220]   do we approach – what's the basic outline of scientific knowledge?
[01:12:02.220 --> 01:12:05.220]   What is the bare minimum?
[01:12:05.220 --> 01:12:09.180]   The first thing I think would be necessary in the desert island scenario is we would
[01:12:09.180 --> 01:12:12.140]   need a practical book on living.
[01:12:12.140 --> 01:12:17.380]   And so there are some very practical books on certain kinds of technology.
[01:12:17.380 --> 01:12:18.500]   How do you preserve food?
[01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:19.660]   How do you build shelter?
[01:12:19.660 --> 01:12:23.020]   How do you do these things?
[01:12:23.020 --> 01:12:27.420]   Back to Basics, there's a book I've – I've had various editions over the years.
[01:12:27.420 --> 01:12:28.420]   But there's a well-known book.
[01:12:28.420 --> 01:12:29.420]   It's like Back to Basics.
[01:12:29.420 --> 01:12:30.820]   I used to love reading it when I was a kid.
[01:12:30.820 --> 01:12:35.260]   It's the kind of book that you need that gives you the practical instruction and the
[01:12:35.260 --> 01:12:44.580]   practical outline of where did you come – of what did you – it gives you the – again,
[01:12:44.580 --> 01:12:48.220]   practical structure and outline of how to preserve food, how to build a shelter, how
[01:12:48.220 --> 01:12:51.780]   to get water, things like that.
[01:12:51.780 --> 01:12:53.580]   That would be the first basic approach.
[01:12:53.580 --> 01:13:00.260]   The second book that we would need would be something about like basic scientific knowledge.
[01:13:00.260 --> 01:13:04.980]   I have no idea what basic text would serve there.
[01:13:04.980 --> 01:13:10.700]   But we would need something that would try to bring together a record of mathematics
[01:13:10.700 --> 01:13:13.820]   and basic scientific knowledge in some way.
[01:13:13.820 --> 01:13:16.620]   I've never seen kind of that type of book.
[01:13:16.620 --> 01:13:20.700]   But it would be interesting to stumble across it in some way.
[01:13:20.700 --> 01:13:21.700]   The third one would be culture.
[01:13:21.700 --> 01:13:23.580]   What do you build a culture on?
[01:13:23.580 --> 01:13:27.660]   Because obviously, if we're stuck somewhere, then we're going to build a culture.
[01:13:27.660 --> 01:13:35.820]   And so with that, rather obviously, I would insert the 66 books of the Protestant Bible.
[01:13:35.820 --> 01:13:37.900]   The reason there is because you have history.
[01:13:37.900 --> 01:13:38.900]   Where did we come from?
[01:13:38.900 --> 01:13:39.900]   Why are we here?
[01:13:39.900 --> 01:13:41.940]   What's the meaning of this whole thing?
[01:13:41.940 --> 01:13:43.380]   That's what that answers.
[01:13:43.380 --> 01:13:45.940]   And then also the cultural construct.
[01:13:45.940 --> 01:13:52.820]   The early Puritan settlers to the United States of America used explicitly the Mosaic Law
[01:13:52.820 --> 01:13:56.660]   as their outline for their law and their tradition.
[01:13:56.660 --> 01:14:03.420]   And that has produced – that fundamental foundation has produced the wealthiest, most
[01:14:03.420 --> 01:14:06.100]   successful culture in the history of the world.
[01:14:06.100 --> 01:14:10.940]   And so I'd want to build again on that foundation to understand the outline and understand that
[01:14:10.940 --> 01:14:17.180]   the precepts of where we come from, where are we going, and how do we organize a society
[01:14:17.180 --> 01:14:21.340]   because that is the fundamental conflict in the world today.
[01:14:21.340 --> 01:14:26.780]   Once you have the basic needs of life established, once you have the basic – you have some
[01:14:26.780 --> 01:14:34.620]   shelter and you have some fire and you have some water to drink and some food to eat,
[01:14:34.620 --> 01:14:37.180]   then as human beings, we immediately start building civilization.
[01:14:37.180 --> 01:14:39.460]   We immediately start building culture.
[01:14:39.460 --> 01:14:47.060]   And so I'd want to understand what was it that has led to the most incredibly successful
[01:14:47.060 --> 01:14:50.940]   cultures in the history of the world because there have been thousands of different cultures
[01:14:50.940 --> 01:14:56.020]   that have developed but not all of them have survived and not all cultures are the same.
[01:14:56.020 --> 01:14:57.580]   And so those would be the three books.
[01:14:57.580 --> 01:15:01.820]   I would choose a basic book on an outline of kind of how to live.
[01:15:01.820 --> 01:15:04.260]   I thought about adding to this like a book on architecture.
[01:15:04.260 --> 01:15:05.260]   I have some books.
[01:15:05.260 --> 01:15:06.260]   What's the guy's name?
[01:15:06.260 --> 01:15:07.580]   I can't remember his name.
[01:15:07.580 --> 01:15:13.540]   But I read this really interesting architecture guy who wrote these books not on the actual
[01:15:13.540 --> 01:15:17.500]   engineering or the design but more on the fundamental design and he talked about the
[01:15:17.500 --> 01:15:20.500]   design principles of architecture as applied to different climates.
[01:15:20.500 --> 01:15:22.540]   I can't remember the name right now.
[01:15:22.540 --> 01:15:25.980]   I was trying to come up with it.
[01:15:25.980 --> 01:15:29.820]   But those would be kind of the things is we need – how do we live and how do we stay
[01:15:29.820 --> 01:15:30.820]   alive?
[01:15:30.820 --> 01:15:36.180]   We need – what basic knowledge do we need to build on, the mathematical and scientific
[01:15:36.180 --> 01:15:42.620]   precepts for us to be able to construct engineering projects and have them not fall down?
[01:15:42.620 --> 01:15:45.660]   And then how do we build culture and civilization?
[01:15:45.660 --> 01:15:46.660]   Where do we come from?
[01:15:46.660 --> 01:15:53.700]   Where are we going and how do we build a strong culture with a moral fabric that's going
[01:15:53.700 --> 01:15:54.940]   to last the test of time?
[01:15:54.940 --> 01:15:59.140]   Because obviously if we wound up on this desert island, we probably failed.
[01:15:59.140 --> 01:16:00.620]   So that's my answer.
[01:16:00.620 --> 01:16:01.620]   Very good.
[01:16:01.620 --> 01:16:02.620]   Very good.
[01:16:02.620 --> 01:16:11.160]   I will have to think about in that exact kind of that brainstorming session to see what
[01:16:11.160 --> 01:16:13.400]   I guess I would choose for the three books as well.
[01:16:13.400 --> 01:16:16.500]   That's an interesting outlook.
[01:16:16.500 --> 01:16:20.280]   One would go as far as saying that maybe you've actually thought about that before the question
[01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:21.280]   was raised today.
[01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:26.980]   I have because I've thought about it a lot for a couple of reasons.
[01:16:26.980 --> 01:16:34.860]   Number one, because I'm a strong advocate of home education for children, I've thought
[01:16:34.860 --> 01:16:39.820]   a lot about what do we need to teach our children in order for them to be successful in the
[01:16:39.820 --> 01:16:41.260]   future.
[01:16:41.260 --> 01:16:45.460]   And in one way, this is probably the thing that I have most benefited from in thinking
[01:16:45.460 --> 01:16:51.020]   about home education and in considering how home education can be applied.
[01:16:51.020 --> 01:16:56.100]   I've benefited from recognizing the fact that I have got to be responsible to know
[01:16:56.100 --> 01:16:57.460]   what my children need to know.
[01:16:57.460 --> 01:17:00.060]   And that's caused me to question my own education.
[01:17:00.060 --> 01:17:06.300]   If we just ship our kids off to a school that somebody else has designed, then as parents,
[01:17:06.300 --> 01:17:10.780]   we never think about what my children – we often don't think so much about what my
[01:17:10.780 --> 01:17:12.060]   children need to know.
[01:17:12.060 --> 01:17:13.620]   It's kind of just handed to us.
[01:17:13.620 --> 01:17:20.980]   Well, here's the curriculum that you need and so go for it.
[01:17:20.980 --> 01:17:21.980]   This is what you need.
[01:17:21.980 --> 01:17:28.020]   Well, it's not so simple when you're going to take care of your own education, your own
[01:17:28.020 --> 01:17:29.780]   children's education.
[01:17:29.780 --> 01:17:35.620]   So I've really benefited from thinking about education and it's made me think what are
[01:17:35.620 --> 01:17:39.300]   the fundamental principles that my children need to know.
[01:17:39.300 --> 01:17:47.220]   I'm convinced that it's absolutely impossible for me to teach my children the specific facts
[01:17:47.220 --> 01:17:51.660]   that are going to see them through the coming decades.
[01:17:51.660 --> 01:17:56.420]   Actually, almost all the facts supposedly – and I'm putting facts in air quotes
[01:17:56.420 --> 01:18:02.180]   – almost all the facts that I was taught in school, I've since debunked or we've
[01:18:02.180 --> 01:18:04.780]   since gone on with deeper knowledge.
[01:18:04.780 --> 01:18:09.540]   If the atom was the smallest particle, some of us were taught this is the smallest particle
[01:18:09.540 --> 01:18:10.540]   of the cell.
[01:18:10.540 --> 01:18:11.540]   What is it now?
[01:18:11.540 --> 01:18:12.540]   It's like a cork or something.
[01:18:12.540 --> 01:18:13.540]   All of a sudden, no, wait a second.
[01:18:13.540 --> 01:18:18.500]   The cell goes smaller or there's this number of periodic elements but all of a sudden,
[01:18:18.500 --> 01:18:19.500]   it goes deeper.
[01:18:19.500 --> 01:18:21.260]   That's been pretty stable.
[01:18:21.260 --> 01:18:23.180]   Those aren't good examples.
[01:18:23.180 --> 01:18:27.140]   But most of the facts that I was taught about history, Columbus sailed the ocean blue in
[01:18:27.140 --> 01:18:28.140]   1492.
[01:18:28.140 --> 01:18:34.820]   Well, maybe he did and he had a huge impact but he was by no means the first European
[01:18:34.820 --> 01:18:40.420]   visitor to the United States and he didn't discover America in that context.
[01:18:40.420 --> 01:18:44.480]   That was a very surface shallow thing that I was taught.
[01:18:44.480 --> 01:18:50.320]   So I've come to the conclusion that you can't really teach facts to children effectively
[01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:51.940]   enough where it's going to last them.
[01:18:51.940 --> 01:18:55.220]   What we need to do is teach principles and teach an approach.
[01:18:55.220 --> 01:19:01.460]   So there, by teaching my children orderly thinking or teaching them how to be disciplined
[01:19:01.460 --> 01:19:06.420]   people and disciplined researchers or teaching them how to approach problems or how to understand
[01:19:06.420 --> 01:19:12.500]   philosophy or how to trace a thread through, then it causes me to think about things at
[01:19:12.500 --> 01:19:13.500]   a deeper level.
[01:19:13.500 --> 01:19:17.100]   So I've thought a lot about it there as I've tried to identify what do my children need
[01:19:17.100 --> 01:19:20.980]   to know to be successful in the world of 2050.
[01:19:20.980 --> 01:19:24.620]   The other thing that I've thought a lot about is one of my major concerns.
[01:19:24.620 --> 01:19:33.460]   I look at the US American society and in many ways, all I see is a society that's in collapse
[01:19:33.460 --> 01:19:38.380]   and I don't know the timing on it nor do I know what the impact of it looks like.
[01:19:38.380 --> 01:19:43.500]   But it's very hard to escape the indicators of collapse.
[01:19:43.500 --> 01:19:47.620]   The US American empire has turned its attention inward.
[01:19:47.620 --> 01:19:50.460]   We've put up walls around the country to try to keep people out.
[01:19:50.460 --> 01:19:55.980]   That's a sign of an empire in decline rather than a sign of an empire in expansion.
[01:19:55.980 --> 01:20:08.020]   There's some significant financial constraints that are affecting the country and the culture
[01:20:08.020 --> 01:20:14.700]   and those will have significant impacts and I'm convinced they'll have impacts in my lifetime.
[01:20:14.700 --> 01:20:21.900]   When I look at the underlying social fabric and the unrest that exists, there's a very
[01:20:21.900 --> 01:20:27.300]   small segment of the US American culture that's doing well, but I would say a majority of
[01:20:27.300 --> 01:20:30.820]   the US American culture is sick, I find it fundamentally sick.
[01:20:30.820 --> 01:20:36.620]   I read the most impactful book I read in January was Charles Murray's book, Coming Apart, and
[01:20:36.620 --> 01:20:43.260]   it kind of really opened my eyes to the measurable sociological collapse happening in our society
[01:20:43.260 --> 01:20:44.260]   today.
[01:20:44.260 --> 01:20:45.660]   And so I've thought a lot about, "OK, what does that look like?"
[01:20:45.660 --> 01:20:50.860]   Because I don't personally see a scenario where – I don't think people are shooting
[01:20:50.860 --> 01:20:51.860]   each other in the streets.
[01:20:51.860 --> 01:20:57.320]   We're not going back to the Middle Ages and electricity is not going to go anywhere.
[01:20:57.320 --> 01:20:58.780]   But in terms of what is that?
[01:20:58.780 --> 01:21:03.180]   And so I've kind of really approached it as a research project to say, "Well, what
[01:21:03.180 --> 01:21:05.340]   got us here?
[01:21:05.340 --> 01:21:10.020]   Am I committing a Golden Age fallacy and just think that, well, life was better before but
[01:21:10.020 --> 01:21:11.340]   now it's not?
[01:21:11.340 --> 01:21:16.940]   Or are there legitimate, objectively measurable things that I can look at and I can identify
[01:21:16.940 --> 01:21:19.820]   that are markers of success and markers of progress?
[01:21:19.820 --> 01:21:20.820]   Where did we come from?
[01:21:20.820 --> 01:21:21.820]   What was the path that got us here?
[01:21:21.820 --> 01:21:26.780]   And then what are the philosophies that are warring in today's world?"
[01:21:26.780 --> 01:21:29.860]   Because religion and philosophy leads the culture.
[01:21:29.860 --> 01:21:32.900]   So what are the religious presuppositions of the culture?
[01:21:32.900 --> 01:21:37.620]   What's happening philosophically that's leading people to the actual actions of their
[01:21:37.620 --> 01:21:39.200]   daily life?
[01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:43.900]   And so in thinking about that, it's caused me to do a lot of thinking about culture because
[01:21:43.900 --> 01:21:44.900]   how do you change it?
[01:21:44.900 --> 01:21:49.980]   I'm very concerned about how do we adjust and change culture, not on a macro scale.
[01:21:49.980 --> 01:21:51.840]   I can't do anything about a broad scale.
[01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:55.580]   But at the margin, how can I make a little bit of an impact in my children's lives and
[01:21:55.580 --> 01:21:58.860]   in my family's lives and in my neighbor's lives and in my community?
[01:21:58.860 --> 01:22:05.460]   How can I adjust and get off the crazy train and stay on the train that leads to prosperity
[01:22:05.460 --> 01:22:07.060]   and stability of society?
[01:22:07.060 --> 01:22:09.060]   So you got me going.
[01:22:09.060 --> 01:22:10.380]   I didn't mean to go into all that.
[01:22:10.380 --> 01:22:12.380]   But yes, I have thought a little bit about it.
[01:22:12.380 --> 01:22:13.540]   No, that's great.
[01:22:13.540 --> 01:22:21.620]   And to be honest, I can't speak for the entire RPF audience, but that seems like a great
[01:22:21.620 --> 01:22:26.420]   future outline for a particular show and get into specific examples.
[01:22:26.420 --> 01:22:32.820]   And I think that would be really interesting to kind of hear the deeper impact in that
[01:22:32.820 --> 01:22:34.060]   in the specific examples.
[01:22:34.060 --> 01:22:41.180]   Now, here's the short version because I can't do it in terms of the 30-minute version.
[01:22:41.180 --> 01:22:44.000]   But here's the short version.
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:51.540]   If you and your personal life are stable and you have a stable life and a stable outline
[01:22:51.540 --> 01:22:55.900]   of the world and you have a stable framework and you understand the things that are objectively
[01:22:55.900 --> 01:23:00.620]   true and the things that are not objectively true, and it all starts with us as individuals
[01:23:00.620 --> 01:23:05.020]   and you can never ask a sick person to try to help.
[01:23:05.020 --> 01:23:09.260]   You can't ask a sick person to help a community, but it starts with us as individuals.
[01:23:09.260 --> 01:23:14.340]   And then you build that from that stability into a stable family and a husband and a wife
[01:23:14.340 --> 01:23:19.900]   that are locked together and who are individually stable and who have a marriage that's stable
[01:23:19.900 --> 01:23:22.220]   based upon something that lasts.
[01:23:22.220 --> 01:23:24.740]   That's an impossible unit to separate.
[01:23:24.740 --> 01:23:30.580]   And as society disintegrates, whenever the family unit of a husband and wife gets split
[01:23:30.580 --> 01:23:36.120]   apart it leads to a slowly unfolding society that reflects onto children, that reflects
[01:23:36.120 --> 01:23:37.700]   onto the broader community.
[01:23:37.700 --> 01:23:42.300]   But it has nothing to do with going out and forcing anyone else to do what they can do.
[01:23:42.300 --> 01:23:43.300]   You can't do it.
[01:23:43.300 --> 01:23:44.920]   You just see the reflection of that.
[01:23:44.920 --> 01:23:47.740]   You can only start with you as an individual.
[01:23:47.740 --> 01:23:51.540]   And I think this is where so many people get kind of the approach wrong is they just start
[01:23:51.540 --> 01:23:56.140]   with trying to say, "Well, how can I go and affect those 152 million people out there?"
[01:23:56.140 --> 01:23:57.140]   You can't do it.
[01:23:57.140 --> 01:23:58.140]   There's no way to do it.
[01:23:58.140 --> 01:24:03.420]   The only way you can do it there is with the imposition of statist force and you come and
[01:24:03.420 --> 01:24:10.020]   you try to force people, but that either winds up in begrudging obeisance or revolution,
[01:24:10.020 --> 01:24:12.820]   at the worst case.
[01:24:12.820 --> 01:24:17.460]   So the things that we talk about every day have an impact on the culture.
[01:24:17.460 --> 01:24:20.900]   And you and I, each of us, has a ripple effect on the people around us.
[01:24:20.900 --> 01:24:23.020]   So I don't know.
[01:24:23.020 --> 01:24:26.820]   It's too big of a question and there's so many unknowns.
[01:24:26.820 --> 01:24:29.660]   I don't feel confident publicly going farther than that.
[01:24:29.660 --> 01:24:35.740]   But I do know that as each of us individually engages in the proper stewardship of our own
[01:24:35.740 --> 01:24:37.820]   life, it has a ripple effect.
[01:24:37.820 --> 01:24:39.060]   Thank you so much for listening to today's show.
