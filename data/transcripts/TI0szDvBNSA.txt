[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200]   All right, segment three, the deep life.
[00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:06.440]   Let's go to the deep life academy.
[00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.900]   So we're going to do here is we're going to start with a question.
[00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.540]   And use this question to motivate a deeper look
[00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.840]   at a key idea in the deep life universe.
[00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.400]   All right. So our motivating question comes from a non.
[00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.960]   How do you go about figuring out the lifestyle you want to have?
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.360]   And the career you want to pursue, you talk about lifestyle
[00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.040]   centric career planning. And while I love your idea,
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.000]   I am still unable to put it into practice.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.240]   I work in IT as a data engineer, and I'm trying to think about what next,
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.240]   which is where your advice seemed relevant.
[00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.160]   Where can I get inspiration from you to help figure out
[00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.600]   the type of lifestyle I would like to lead?
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.860]   All right. This is an opportunity
[00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.440]   to open up the deep life academy for the topic of lifestyle
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.880]   centric career planning.
[00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.140]   One of my favorite strategies, probably the piece of advice
[00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.120]   I give most often to young people trying to figure out their careers.
[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:10.180]   So I have three, four lessons,
[00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.380]   four brief lessons, lesson number one.
[00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.080]   What is lifestyle centric career planning?
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.220]   So here's the idea.
[00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.240]   When making decisions about what career to follow
[00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.560]   or what advancement to pursue in your current career,
[00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.460]   you should work backwards from a concrete image of your ideal lifestyle
[00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.200]   that you hope to be living in the near to intermediate future.
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.560]   This vision, this concrete image should include details
[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.160]   about the physical environment where you are, the social environment
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.260]   in which you find yourself, the stress pace, a general atmosphere of your life,
[00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:46.720]   your mental and spiritual life.
[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.500]   What are the details there and what your time outside of work?
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.900]   Is occupied with, so you're building a concrete image
[00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.640]   that has all these things in it,
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.600]   concrete specific imagery, but does not have specifics
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.740]   about what exact career you're doing or what exact work you're doing.
[00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.780]   So it's all of the elements of your lifestyle.
[00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.240]   Save specifics about I work in UX design
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.540]   at a mid market tech company.
[00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:15.780]   So that's the exercise.
[00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.380]   You then use this image to help figure out
[00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.480]   what job you want or what career advancement to take,
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.780]   because now you have a simple question of the things available to me now.
[00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.600]   What will most effectively move me closer to achieving this lifestyle?
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.980]   So you have a clear target for your decisions.
[00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.780]   It gets you away from much more vague approaches to making career decisions,
[00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.480]   such as a what's my passion?
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.700]   What's my true calling possible to answer questions
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.940]   or just what seems most respectable or most stable or, you know, make
[00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.840]   my parents happiest?
[00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.340]   This is, I think, a much more
[00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.740]   effective means of pursuing these questions.
[00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.540]   And we'll get we'll get to why in a later lesson.
[00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.340]   All right, lesson number two,
[00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.540]   and this goes straight to a non particular query.
[00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.040]   How do you figure out the answers to those questions?
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.340]   How do you figure out what your ideal lifestyle is?
[00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.180]   What your ideal lifestyle?
[00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.140]   Should look like.
[00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.880]   Here, you have to trust your gut.
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:24.940]   So this is kind of interesting.
[00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:30.600]   I reject the idea that we have a gut instinct about jobs
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.140]   that is pretty effective, right, this idea that we have a passion.
[00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.280]   We're wired for this particular job and we'll know it when we see it
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.140]   because jobs are weird.
[00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.280]   That we don't have a great instinct for what they really mean for our lives.
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.300]   We don't have we don't have good prediction software.
[00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.840]   We don't have a good sense of what that job actually be like.
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.600]   I don't trust my gut too much about something as vague
[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:57.600]   as a career in UX design versus a career in QA quality insurance.
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.200]   My mind doesn't know what that means.
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.440]   My gut's not going to give me interesting reactions about this,
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:02.900]   but I do trust my gut.
[00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:08.900]   When I'm thinking about specific concrete aspects of my lifestyle.
[00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:14.500]   When I imagine myself, you know, going for a long walk
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.340]   in the morning with my dog and the sun is filtering through and this is
[00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.800]   and that really resonates, I want to be doing that every day.
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:22.600]   Something about that resonates.
[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.300]   I trust my gut about that because that's concrete, that specific.
[00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.780]   Specific concrete.
[00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.700]   So you need to see what resonates, where do you find examples
[00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:36.780]   to test for resonance documentaries, movies, magazine profiles, books,
[00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.740]   YouTube videos, people that you know and experience in your life,
[00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.040]   all these different forms of media expose yourself.
[00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.920]   Let me watch the thing about Laird Hamilton and his house in
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:49.140]   Malibu or his house in Hawaii
[00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.520]   and that we're kind of like outdoor exercise focused lifestyle.
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.780]   Let me watch something about Steve Jobs.
[00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:58.640]   And his hard charging style to try to change the world.
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.020]   Let me watch something about a math genius.
[00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.920]   Let me watch something about a guy who shapes surfboard.
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.520]   Expose yourself, expose yourself to all sorts of different stories,
[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:09.020]   all sorts of different examples and aspects of life and see what resonates.
[00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:10.720]   Trust your trust, your intuition.
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.160]   All right, for lesson number three, let's do a case study.
[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:14.360]   Let's see this in action.
[00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:21.260]   Using our original question asker as our starting point here.
[00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.260]   Let's go through two
[00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.960]   possible lifestyles that he might come up with.
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:32.520]   So we get I want to show you an example of what a good concrete lifestyle looks like
[00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.560]   and then and then discuss how that could impact decisions he makes about his career.
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.020]   So let's let's make this tangible with a case study.
[00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:44.160]   All right. So Anand is a data engineer, IT guy.
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.820]   Let's let's assume he's early in his career.
[00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:47.960]   I'm not sure if that's true, but just for the case of our case study.
[00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:52.760]   He has a technical degree working in some sort of data engineering job.
[00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:57.620]   All right. He goes through our exercises here, exposes himself to a lot of media,
[00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:00.320]   sees what resonates, come up with a concrete image of his lifestyle
[00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:03.320]   that has all details tangible except for the specifics of his job.
[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.320]   Let's look at two possible visions he might come up with.
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:07.320]   Vision number one.
[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:12.920]   Maybe that the image he creates that resonates is that he's in a house
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:17.920]   overlooking a sun drenched meadow.
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.520]   It's kind of land here
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:24.320]   that that evening friends come over.
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:28.760]   It's like the opening scene in that NBC show Parenthood where there's
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:34.820]   cafe lights over an old picnic table and some Tibetan prayer flags.
[00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:36.860]   You sort of outside, it's a little bohemian.
[00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:40.920]   Enjoying some wine from a local vineyard that someone brought,
[00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.220]   just just enjoying people's company.
[00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:47.020]   Maybe as part of this vision, Anand is imagining
[00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:50.120]   sort of in the late afternoon, sort of as his workday is over.
[00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.120]   And his workday, he imagines he's he's
[00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:57.020]   he's looking out through a picture window over the meadow,
[00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:00.920]   working generically at a computer screen, but with his tea and it's quiet.
[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.720]   And by three, he's done.
[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:07.120]   And he has a riding shed at the corner of the property, maybe by a garden
[00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.920]   with a deer fence up that he tends that he's working on a novel,
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:13.920]   speculative fiction novel, not stressed about money,
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:18.820]   but nothing in this image shows him being, you know, particularly rich.
[00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:20.420]   All right.
[00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:23.820]   That's an image with lots of concrete attributes
[00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:25.320]   about different aspects of his life.
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:26.520]   Let's say that's what resonates.
[00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:31.320]   What impact might that have on how he advances in his career?
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:32.920]   As a data engineer?
[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:37.820]   Well, it might tell him I need autonomy,
[00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:41.520]   so I'm going to move towards highly valuable project based skills.
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:45.320]   So skills where you can do a project
[00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:48.720]   applying the skill and it's really valuable, it's really hard one skill.
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:51.420]   This would then give him going forward
[00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:55.020]   a lot of flexibility in where and how he looked.
[00:07:55.020 --> 00:08:00.720]   So, for example, he might follow the the the path of a computer
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:04.120]   the path of Lulu for my book,
[00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.320]   So Good They Can't Ignore You, where I discuss these things.
[00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:09.320]   Lulu did database design, so this is very similar.
[00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:12.820]   She got very good at doing a particular type of database design
[00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:15.020]   that was relevant for financial institutions,
[00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:18.020]   left her job and did this freelance.
[00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:22.220]   Projects took, you know, four or five months.
[00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:27.920]   So she constructed a life where she worked half the time
[00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:32.720]   and then the other half of the year would go do adventures, do something else.
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:36.220]   So maybe a non has this model in place.
[00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:39.120]   I got to build up some specific skill where I can take on a few projects a year.
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:42.020]   I can do them forever. I want to do.
[00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:44.620]   I have control over how many I do, but it's lucrative enough
[00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:47.720]   that if we live someplace that's not super expensive, can have the house
[00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:51.320]   in the meadow because, you know, we don't need to be in suburban D.C.
[00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:54.720]   So you're looking for that type of skills.
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:58.420]   You're looking for shifting to a position that's more location independent.
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:01.820]   Let me leave this firm where it's all in person to work for this remote firm.
[00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:05.120]   So now I have more arbitrage over where I live.
[00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:08.920]   In fact, if I let me find a location, if I live here, it's actually pretty cheap.
[00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:13.620]   And so I don't have to get as high up the income
[00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:16.020]   possibility salary with my skills before I make that move.
[00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:18.320]   All these things become relevant once you have the vision.
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:23.720]   Vision number two, so let's assume.
[00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:25.020]   Instead of that being the vision.
[00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:29.720]   When Ananda's lifestyle centric career planning, he comes up with the following
[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:35.020]   image, he sees himself in a high rise apartment in the city
[00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:38.720]   and he's got a cool view of the buildings and the light at night.
[00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:41.220]   He's plugged into the cultural scene of the city.
[00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:45.120]   So he seemed like the latest movies and interesting music.
[00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:49.220]   He really plugged in, being exposed to the interesting culture.
[00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:52.820]   He has an exciting type of professional life where he's leading a team.
[00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:55.920]   There's a Steve Jobsian feel to it, that they're getting something new
[00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:57.720]   off of the ground.
[00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:00.020]   He's respected in this world of entrepreneurs.
[00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:03.920]   There's the sense of like if this goes right, like we might be wealthy.
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:06.920]   We're making a big play.
[00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:09.520]   Getting after it. Very exciting, very plugged in.
[00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:13.520]   Maybe a non came from a quieter background and felt bored
[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:14.820]   and wanted the energy.
[00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:17.920]   All right. So if that's your vision, it would lead to different decisions
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:20.920]   about what to do with your early stage data engineering career.
[00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:23.320]   Now you might take on a more aggressive path
[00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:25.820]   where you're trying to get into team leadership positions,
[00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:27.520]   take on more responsibilities.
[00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:30.920]   You're not trying to develop a very bespoke skill
[00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:34.120]   that you can then trickle out and as many projects as you want.
[00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:37.920]   You instead want to prove yourself as someone who can get things done.
[00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:41.820]   Maybe he moves from his company to a company that's in a bigger city
[00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:45.020]   and faster growing where there's startup capital at play
[00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:47.520]   so he can meet investors.
[00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:50.820]   Meet higher end players, be around more skilled people,
[00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:52.320]   the people who are going to get the biggest investment
[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:56.320]   and make the biggest moves to try to get new companies started.
[00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:00.420]   Completely different types of decisions will be made if that's the vision.
[00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:05.620]   Same person, different visions, both give you clear images of what to do.
[00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:13.320]   Final lesson here, why does lifestyle centric career planning works?
[00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:17.420]   Because ultimately the daily reality of your lifestyle
[00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:20.220]   is what affects your sense of well-being.
[00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:25.420]   The details of your life each day is what is directly acting on your body
[00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:28.220]   and your mind from which your affect is generated.
[00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:33.720]   So working backwards from what are the details that I am going to enjoy,
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:35.920]   they're going to be meaningful to me, they're going to be sustainable to me.
[00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:38.920]   Working backwards from that is the most consistent way you have
[00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:43.120]   of getting to a place where you actually feel good about your life.
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:47.220]   To instead focus on your career in isolation.
[00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:49.520]   Forget all that.
[00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:51.920]   What job is my passion?
[00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:54.220]   How can I be as successful as possible?
[00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:58.620]   And to just hope that after you make those decisions,
[00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:00.620]   you can get the rest of your life to sort of fit.
[00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:02.720]   Get the rest of your life to sort of fix.
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:05.020]   You're just rolling the dice.
[00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:10.020]   You are very likely to end up in a career path
[00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:13.220]   in which things that are really important to you to enjoy
[00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:16.120]   and find meaning in your life are difficult or unavailable.
[00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:19.420]   You might get lucky, but you probably won't.
[00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:21.920]   I was reading a book the other day.
[00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:27.120]   I won't mention the specific book, but the author had moved
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:30.720]   from the Pacific Northwest to suburban Washington, D.C.
[00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:36.220]   and like being outside, outdoor activity, exercise, fresh air, the woods.
[00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:38.320]   Like all of this was really important to her.
[00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:41.420]   And they moved to the suburban D.C.
[00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:43.820]   because this is a better job.
[00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:46.420]   And if I'm just going to put on my blinkers and say,
[00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:49.420]   what do I want to do? What's a good job?
[00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:51.220]   What's a good opportunity? I can't pass up a good opportunity.
[00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:54.420]   So they come to suburban D.C., which is not near any nature.
[00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:56.820]   She was miserable.
[00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:59.720]   Now, this book wasn't just about that, but I pulled that thread out of it.
[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:02.120]   I was thinking, man, if you were a lifestyle
[00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:04.920]   such a career planning, you would say I could care less
[00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:08.320]   that there is a quote unquote good opportunity
[00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:10.820]   at a think tank in D.C.
[00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:15.920]   What I care about is do I have the opportunities where I am?
[00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.920]   Do I have the opportunities right now to make my life something?
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:19.120]   I really like this really meaningful.
[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:22.220]   And for me, the person speaking in the voice of the person that book
[00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:25.320]   is probably staying in the Pacific Northwest and finding the right skill set
[00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:28.220]   that allows you to not be stressed about money and have this flexibility.
[00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:30.020]   I really think it's the way to go.
[00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:35.020]   Career serves your life because ultimately your daily experience
[00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:37.620]   of your life is what dictates how you feel.
[00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:43.320]   Life justice, your career planning is the natural consequence of that truism.
