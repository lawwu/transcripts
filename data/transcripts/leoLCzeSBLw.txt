[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.440]   Thank you. Alright, it's 14 minutes past 7 o'clock. Now, do you ever sit at home getting
[00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.040]   frustrated by the speed of your internet connection? Well, even broadband services in Australia
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.600]   are considerably slower than in many parts of the world.
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:17.780]   Are you tired of waiting on companies like Telstra? The Queensland Government is preparing
[00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:23.120]   to do something about it. It wants to build a cutting-edge fibre optic network that promises
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:31.600]   internet services 100 times faster than regular broadband that we're used to now. For more,
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.200]   we're joined by computer expert Jeremy Howard. Good morning to you. Now, let's start at
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.320]   the beginning. Why are we so far behind the rest of the world?
[00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.100]   Well, that's a good question. I think a lot of it is to do with... Well, in the end, I
[00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.280]   think, really, the government and Telstra have dropped the ball over the last few years.
[00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.120]   In the States, where I just spent three months, real fast broadband was everywhere. People
[00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:02.300]   were used to downloading video on demand and video conferencing. Productivity in the workplace
[00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.700]   was much higher. I think when it comes to having a monopoly supplier like Telstra has
[00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.000]   been, they can get a bit fat and lazy, to be honest.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.800]   Because I guess a lot of us are surprised. We thought broadband was as fast as it got,
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:22.280]   but Premier Peter Beatty's saying that this new service can be 100 times faster than regular
[00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.840]   broadband. Is that right 100 times?
[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.320]   That's right, Mel. In fact, elsewhere in the world, they wouldn't call what we have here
[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.920]   broadband. Broadband is a service that allows people to access the kind of services I was
[00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:38.880]   talking about, like video on demand. We don't really have broadband in this country, except
[00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.400]   for a few companies like Primus and Internode, which have actually really innovated here
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.600]   and are providing that to very small parts of the nation. But it's people like the Queensland
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.440]   Government that need to step forward and provide this to the rest of the country.
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.880]   So how will their system work?
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.440]   Well, it's pretty unclear on the details at this stage, but one of the really expensive
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.080]   parts of this is actually getting access to places to put the cables. So what the Queensland
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.840]   Government is saying is that they're going to provide access to the power lines, the
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.380]   rights of way next to railways and so forth. So there's actually somewhere to put the highest
[00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:21.280]   bid fibre optic cables. They're talking about a cost of $550 million just to cover southeast
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.980]   Queensland. So that's a pretty big expense, and that's where the real question is here.
[00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.440]   And what about cost to consumers, Jeremy? Is it just going to be so expensive that none
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.440]   of us will be able to afford to have it?
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.000]   That's what I'm worried about. If you look at what Telstra's done with their NextG network
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.160]   that they're so excited about, they're talking about $200 a month to get reasonable amounts
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:48.600]   of volume on that. If it costs $550 million, that could end up being about $1,000 to the
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.960]   consumer. So I think this is the big issue, is whether this is actually going to be affordable
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.720]   for people to take advantage of it.
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.920]   Jeremy Howard, thank you for your time this morning and explaining it.
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:00.920]   Thank you.
