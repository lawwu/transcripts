[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.280]   Well, we've talked a lot about Bible study principles on the podcast.
[00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.080]   Arcing, specifically, the practice of breaking down a paragraph in the Bible to its individual
[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.960]   statements, its propositions, to determine how those propositions relate to one another
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.400]   logically so that we can then see for ourselves the main point of a text.
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.880]   Arcing is a powerful way to employ discourse analysis.
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.800]   We talked about this back in APJ 1056, if you want more there.
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.640]   But in that episode, you only used examples from Paul's epistles, Pastor John, and I think
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.960]   the epistles are rather intuitive for arcing.
[00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.480]   But Nicholas in Ontario, Canada, who is, I think he's a pastor, writes in to ask about
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.840]   narrative texts.
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.480]   Hello, Pastor John, thank you for your tireless work on this podcast.
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.920]   It is such a blessing to have these concise and thoughtful responses to the perennial
[00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.400]   questions of life.
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:02.520]   I am currently listening on Audible to your book, Reading the Bible Supernaturally.
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.600]   It has been such a wonderful refresher on why to read the Bible and how to focus my
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.360]   reading and study for personal devotion and sermon prep.
[00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.360]   Thank you.
[00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.000]   My question is regarding narratives.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.160]   You make the point that your revolution in reading came when you discovered that the
[00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.880]   Bible's authors were making arguments and that tracing those arguments well was key
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.400]   to understanding the author and thus God's intention in the Word.
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.000]   I see how this applies to the epistles of the New Testament and even the wisdom literature,
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.560]   but what about narratives?
[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.360]   My church is currently preaching through Luke, and while there is indeed structure, how do
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.800]   you arc out a narrative?
[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.860]   Are there different keys you look for?
[00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.640]   Are there specific transitions, markers, or triggers you're looking for in the narrative
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:47.640]   text?
[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.640]   Pastor John, what would you say?
[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.000]   Well, let me see if I can get everybody up to speed with what he's asking.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:02.560]   I put a huge emphasis on following an author's train of thought in order to find his true
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.320]   intention.
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:12.280]   And I do believe that the most fundamental goal of reading is to discover the author's
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.480]   intention, what he wants to communicate.
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.040]   Now there may be other good effects of reading besides that discovery.
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:29.000]   You might just find entertainment, for example, but without pursuing this foundational effect
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:36.760]   of finding an author's intention, we're being discourteous and we're treating authors the
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.760]   way we don't like to be treated when we try to communicate something and somebody says,
[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.280]   "I don't really care what you're trying to communicate.
[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.000]   I'm going to take your words to mean this or that."
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.240]   And in the process, we're going to lose a great opportunity for growing.
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:55.280]   If we don't care about finding what another person has discovered in reality, and we just
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.000]   want to read our own ideas in, we're not going to grow.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:06.120]   And 2 Peter 3.18 says, "Grow in the knowledge and the grace of the Lord Jesus."
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:14.560]   So I argue that one essential means of pursuing that goal of finding an author's intention
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:22.040]   and growing in knowledge and grace is to carefully trace an author's argument.
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.000]   And by argument, I don't mean quarrel.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.280]   Sometimes people use the word argument differently than I do.
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:36.560]   I mean a sequence of thought that builds from foundations to conclusions.
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:44.480]   For example, Romans 1.15 to 17 goes like this, "I am eager to preach the gospel to you who
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:45.480]   are in Rome because..."
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.000]   There's going to be three of these becauses.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   Listen now.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.480]   "I am eager to preach the gospel to you who are in Rome because I am not ashamed of the
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:04.800]   gospel, because it is the power of God unto salvation for everyone who believes, because
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.440]   in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith."
[00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:14.060]   I read my Bible for two decades before I discovered that's the way Paul wrote.
[00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.400]   So there are four statements here, right?
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.040]   Massively important statements.
[00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:25.000]   And my point is you can't understand Paul's intention, what he's trying to communicate,
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:32.640]   unless you understand the logical relationships between those four statements.
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:41.760]   And Paul signals loud and clear those relationships by using the word "because" three times.
[00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:46.300]   He's building an argument from foundations to conclusions.
[00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:56.380]   Now Nicholas's question is how that detailed, rigorous focus on the logical relationships
[00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:05.200]   between particular statements relates to the interpretation of big sections of narrative
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.380]   in the Bible or story in the Bible.
[00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:12.700]   And he could expand it out and say, "How does it relate to poetry and parable and so
[00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:13.700]   on?"
[00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:17.900]   Events that are woven together in a certain way.
[00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.740]   That's what I mean by narrative.
[00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:25.100]   Should we seek the author's intention in the same way?
[00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:29.940]   And my answer is, in principle, yes.
[00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:36.280]   But in the details of how the author signals his intention, we're going to have to watch
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:41.780]   for other things than simply one proposition following another proposition with a logical
[00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:43.660]   connector in between.
[00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:45.500]   Stories don't work like that.
[00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.980]   But biblical authors write stories for a reason.
[00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:52.340]   They are trying to communicate something to us.
[00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:55.100]   They want us to find it.
[00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:59.300]   One of Jesus' main criticisms—I remember when I wrote that book he referred to, I was
[00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:04.500]   just blown away by this, that I saw this really for the first time—one of Jesus' main
[00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:09.060]   criticisms of the Pharisees was that he said they didn't know how to read.
[00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:11.940]   I mean, it must have absolutely galled them.
[00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:14.420]   They were the readers, right?
[00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:22.780]   Over and over he says, "Have you not read Matthew 12.3, Matthew 19.4, Matthew 22.31?
[00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:23.780]   Have you not read?"
[00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:27.820]   And they're scratching their heads and saying, "That's all we do is read."
[00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:29.220]   Of course they read.
[00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:30.660]   So what does he mean?
[00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:34.980]   He means you are reading and not reading.
[00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:37.660]   You are seeing and not seeing.
[00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:44.400]   In other words, there are real intentions that the inspired authors—in this case,
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:51.460]   the Old Testament authors that the Pharisees read every day—those authors have real intentions
[00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:58.600]   to communicate, whether through careful sentence-by-sentence exposition or whether through poetry or whether
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:04.660]   through narrative, and those Pharisees weren't seeing it at all.
[00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:07.120]   That's what Jesus was upset about.
[00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:12.820]   So yes, we should look for an author's intention in all writing, all writing that's worth
[00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:14.260]   its salt.
[00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:22.180]   And yes, we should look for whatever clues the author gives us, and all good authors
[00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:27.100]   do give clues, to help us find what he's trying to communicate.
[00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:36.880]   Those clues with regard to narrative might be repetitions or the order of events or what
[00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:46.720]   the dialogues actually say or the effects of certain events or actual inserted interpretive
[00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:50.560]   comments by the author, etc.
[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:58.120]   So let me just give a few illustrations from one of the best stories in the Old Testament.
[00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:03.680]   So I'm thinking of Joseph now, Genesis 37-50.
[00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:07.360]   Some regard this as one of the best short stories that's ever been written, if you
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:09.360]   want to put it in those categories.
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:15.640]   It's an absolutely riveting story, and you wonder, "What in the world is going on here?
[00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:17.840]   Where is this going, this story?"
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:24.640]   Fourteen whole chapters about Joseph's dreams, the hatred of his brothers, they're
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:31.320]   selling him into slavery, his fall further and further into misery as Potiphar's wife
[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:39.160]   lies about him, and then he goes to prison and he's forgotten in prison, and then he
[00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:46.920]   becomes the second-ranked ruler in Egypt, and the people of God are saved from starvation
[00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:50.840]   in the famine, and the line of the Messiah is preserved.
[00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:54.520]   Oh, that's what was going on.
[00:08:54.520 --> 00:09:00.000]   And there are numerous layers of intentions in this writing.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.640]   I want to get it out of people's minds that when you read a narrative, get the big
[00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:05.400]   picture, get the one big point.
[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:08.120]   Well, yes, by all means, get the one big point.
[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:12.300]   It may govern all the others, but there are a lot of little points that authors make along
[00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:13.600]   the way.
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:16.680]   So let's start with the big picture of this story.
[00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:18.240]   Moses doesn't leave us.
[00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:21.480]   I think Moses wrote this book, Genesis.
[00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:27.680]   Moses does not leave us wondering about the big overarching intention of the story.
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:35.600]   He fills us in with a couple of very clear-pointed summary statements of what he's been talking
[00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:36.600]   about.
[00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:45.160]   For example, Joseph says in chapter 45, verse 7, "God sent me, he sent me to Egypt before
[00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:52.280]   you to preserve you a remnant and to keep alive for you many survivors.
[00:09:52.280 --> 00:10:00.920]   So it was not you who sent me here, even though you sold me as slavery, but God, he has made
[00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:08.440]   me a father to Pharaoh and Lord of all his house and ruler over the land of Egypt."
[00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:13.440]   In other words, all these apparently human events that we've been reading about for 14
[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:19.080]   chapters, even the sinful ones, were in the control of the sovereign God who is sending
[00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:23.920]   his emissary through sinful actions down to Egypt to save his people.
[00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:24.920]   That's crazy.
[00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:25.920]   That's wonderful.
[00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:28.760]   That's almost the meaning of the Bible in parable.
[00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:34.600]   And then Genesis 50, verse 20, Joseph says to his brothers, "As for you, you meant evil
[00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:40.960]   against me, but God meant it for good to bring it about that many people should be kept alive."
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:45.000]   I think when you read that, you almost have to go back and reread the story because now
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   you get it.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.640]   Now you say, "Oh, that's where it was all going."
[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:54.120]   And you can reread the story and say with that clue in your mind, "Oh, this meant that
[00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:59.360]   and this was going here," and you see God's hand more immediately.
[00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:06.480]   So the big point is human sinfulness of God's people, of God's people, or human sinfulness
[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:15.360]   against God's people, not only does not thwart his saving plans, they advance his saving
[00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:16.360]   plans.
[00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:21.380]   They are part of the plans of God to save his people and finally his Messiah and bring
[00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:23.720]   him into the world through that line.
[00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:25.000]   So that's the big picture.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.960]   And he clues us in with hints all along the way and with that big explanatory statement
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:32.480]   at the end.
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:40.640]   But there are other clues of meaning and layers of meaning besides the big interpretive statement
[00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:42.100]   at the end.
[00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:51.600]   Along the way, Moses mingles worsening circumstances with encouraging words.
[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.460]   Joseph is thrown into the pit.
[00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:55.320]   He's sold as a slave.
[00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:56.960]   He's far from home in Egypt.
[00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:00.480]   He's lied about by Potiphar's wife.
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:01.800]   He's forgotten in prison.
[00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:03.360]   Down, down, down, down.
[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:07.960]   You can graph this story and it corresponds to many of your lives.
[00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:09.480]   I've done this for our people.
[00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:15.400]   I graph it and say, "Where are you on this horribly descending graph of miserable circumstances
[00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:17.000]   in your life?"
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.840]   And he comes to the end and then he seems to be forgotten by God.
[00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:24.700]   In the world, it's supposed to sound that way.
[00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:32.940]   But along the way, he says things like, Moses says, "The Lord was with him and the Lord
[00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:37.220]   caused all that he did to succeed in his hands."
[00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:43.300]   Or again, "The Lord was with Joseph and showed him steadfast love and gave him favor
[00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:45.540]   in the sight of the keeper of the prison."
[00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:51.600]   So we get these hints along the way that even though things are getting worse for Joseph,
[00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:54.020]   it's not because of his sinfulness.
[00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:56.420]   He's not bringing this on himself.
[00:12:56.420 --> 00:13:01.840]   It's not because he's been abandoned by God, but because God's hidden purpose.
[00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:03.800]   And as we read, we want to know what's the purpose?
[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:04.800]   What's the purpose?
[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:06.260]   God, you say you're for him.
[00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:09.000]   You don't look like you're for him.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.560]   One more illustration of how the author gets across his intention.
[00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:16.160]   And this is one of the perplexing things to me in the whole story.
[00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:22.880]   Chapter 38 totally, it seems, interrupts the flow of this story.
[00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:28.560]   The story begins in chapter 37 with the dreams and the selling into slavery in Egypt.
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:30.520]   And bang!
[00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:38.840]   Moses inserts chapter 38 as soon as the big story starts, and it is so extraneous.
[00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:42.520]   It tells this bizarre story about Judah.
[00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:47.320]   This older brother who winds up getting his daughter-in-law pregnant, thinking she's
[00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:49.160]   a prostitute.
[00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:55.840]   Now whatever else is going on here, my question is, Moses, why here?
[00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:59.680]   I mean, put that chapter before chapter 37.
[00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:01.800]   Let the story flow.
[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:07.000]   What's the point of interrupting the narrative with this chapter 38?
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:14.280]   Well, here's my suggestion, and I would love to know whether it's right or not.
[00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:24.000]   Because the very next thing after that horrible immorality of Judah in chapter 38, the very
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:33.480]   next thing we read about in Joseph's story is his incredible uprightness in sexual relations
[00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:37.520]   with Potiphar's wife, who tries to seduce him.
[00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:44.560]   And Moses records his words, "How then could I do this great wickedness and sin against
[00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:45.760]   God?"
[00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:54.000]   So I think the ordering of the narrative with the insertion of Judah's sexual immorality
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:02.160]   just before Joseph's staggeringly effective and beautiful sexual morality is to underline
[00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:09.560]   in bright colors the difference between Judah's unfaithfulness and Joseph's amazing sexual
[00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:16.920]   uprightness, which simply goes to show that there can be main points to narratives and
[00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:23.960]   lots of sub-points to narratives that we should be alert to.
[00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:31.000]   So in answer to Nicholas's question, whether we are reading a tightly argued epistle of
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:39.880]   Paul or a sweeping narrative across 14 chapters, we're always looking for what the author
[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:43.200]   intends to communicate.
[00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:51.920]   And we look for the kinds of clues that he gives us, whether in exposition or in narration,
[00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:54.960]   to help us find the intention.
[00:15:54.960 --> 00:16:00.480]   And I would just say to Nicholas, the more you read, the more I read with that aim of
[00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:07.480]   spotting those tips and pointers that authors give us, the more you're going to see.
[00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:08.480]   Excellent.
[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:09.800]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:16.680]   And if you want more on arcing, see APJ episodes 127, 395, and 1056.
[00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:23.160]   Those three are really good on this topic—127, 395, and 1056.
[00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:28.560]   All found at our online home at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:35.800]   Just go to the search bar and type in the episode number—127, 395, 1056.
[00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:37.960]   We are approaching Halloween in the States.
[00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:39.800]   It will be here on Sunday for us.
[00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:46.160]   And for many, it's a day about ghosts and ghouls and goblins and pumpkins and candy.
[00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:50.520]   But for some of us, the day serves as an annual reminder of the Protestant Reformation.
[00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:56.640]   Reformation Day reminds us how Paul's epistle to the Romans ignited a fire in Martin Luther's
[00:16:56.640 --> 00:17:02.520]   soul—a fire so bold that he stood against an entire religious system that wanted to
[00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:04.960]   shut him up and shut him down.
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:08.360]   We'll look back on Luther's boldness next time on Wednesday.
[00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:10.200]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:11.000]   We'll see you then.
