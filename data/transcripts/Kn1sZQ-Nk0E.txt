[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.120]   Welcome to the Bogleheads Chapter Series.
[00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.400]   This episode was hosted by the Bogleheads Starting Out Life Stage Chapter and recorded
[00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.340]   August 30th, 2021.
[00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:17.820]   It features the blogger Matt Fientist discussing achieving the dream of financial independence.
[00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.800]   Bogleheads are investors who follow John Bogle's philosophy for attaining financial independence.
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.880]   This recording is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as investment
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.600]   advice.
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.280]   Brandon, great to see you.
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.440]   Thanks a lot for having me.
[00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.060]   Thanks for being here.
[00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.560]   We are so grateful that you're taking the time.
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:43.560]   A lot of folks know that you were a software developer, you retired at 34, having reached
[00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.280]   financial independence.
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.600]   So we're going to talk about the highs and lows of financial independence, but also get
[00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:57.680]   to know you as a person, talk about some of your influences, how you've evolved during
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.060]   early retirement, and wherever the conversation takes us.
[00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:06.600]   So I want to be sensitive to some of the audience knowing your material really well, both written
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.020]   and podcast, and some of the audience being less familiar.
[00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:17.800]   So we'll navigate that balance so as to not be too redundant, as well as to not address
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.620]   what you're known for and specialized about.
[00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:27.080]   So again, as Miriam mentioned, we have a national audience here from coast to coast.
[00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.040]   And for the audience, you and I will chat for about an hour.
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:35.720]   And then during the chat, we're collecting, the team is collecting questions via the chat
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.120]   function.
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:43.840]   And we'll address those after your and my conversation concludes.
[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.960]   So with that, I also want to encourage folks who aren't yet familiar with Brandon's website
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.720]   to read the blogs, listen to the podcast, there's so much there.
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.000]   A lot of it might sound familiar, covered in the space, but a lot of it is uniquely
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.960]   Brandon or med-scientist related, a lot of tax efficiency stuff.
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.880]   And Brandon has also been a guest on other podcasts like Choose FI and Afford Anything
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:17.000]   so you can find additional insights from Brandon as a guest, not just on his podcast.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.200]   With that, let's dive in.
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.120]   Anything you want to say before we get started, Brandon?
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.120]   No, no.
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.120]   Looking forward to it.
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.120]   Excellent.
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:31.720]   So we'll begin with something that you often end with on your podcast, which is you ask
[00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.360]   your guests who are leaders in the FI space or often the self-improvement space, you ask
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.960]   them what's one piece of financial advice you would give towards financial independence.
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.480]   So I ask you that question.
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.480]   Yeah.
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.800]   Well, yeah, that's a question I love to ask because there's so many different answers
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:49.920]   I've gotten over the years.
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:56.080]   But for me, I would say experiment, which being the med-scientist, I probably wouldn't
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.560]   have said that when I started the med-scientist.
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.840]   So it's not me just saying that because it fits with my science theme or anything, but
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:03.840]   it's really the truth.
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:09.400]   Because if I've learned anything over the past 10 years of doing this and really thinking
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.520]   about it hard, it's that we're really bad at knowing what we really, really want.
[00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:22.000]   And the only way to find out is to try things, hopefully try them at a low cost, low commitment
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.040]   sort of situation so that you don't get yourself into a situation where you can't reverse that
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.160]   choice.
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:34.960]   But it's really about experimenting because especially for me, I'm a naturally frugal
[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:45.720]   guy and spending has been a big focus of mine recently and after post-fi to figure out what
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.960]   is the best use of money.
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:54.440]   And now that it's not as tight anymore, what's actually going to make me happier and what's
[00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.360]   not really going to move the needle and things like that.
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:02.320]   So yeah, experimenting and just realizing that you don't have to be right right away
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:07.240]   because you are probably pretty bad at actually figuring out what you really want to do or
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.920]   what you want to be or what you want to spend your money on.
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:10.920]   Excellent.
[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.040]   Yeah, it's so great to hear.
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:18.080]   And there's so much there that I'd like for us to follow up on.
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:21.280]   One is when you say experiment, try it out.
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.520]   There are tons of people that we hear about who, whether they're planning for financial
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:31.640]   independence, early retirement, or just retirement in general, they dream about this next phase
[00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:37.280]   of life, they plan the savings part of it, but then when they get there, they're kind
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.120]   of absent the social structure or interaction or meaning.
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:46.200]   How do you suggest people, building on what you said about experimenting, how do you suggest
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.880]   people fill that void in advance?
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:49.880]   Sure.
[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:50.880]   Yeah.
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:51.880]   No.
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.960]   So I'm sure a lot of people out there are probably similar to what I was, where I blamed
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.000]   my job for the reason I wasn't living the life that I thought would make me happiest
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.360]   and wasn't doing the things that I thought I really wanted to do with my life.
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.680]   Like it was such an easy scapegoat.
[00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:10.000]   And only after leaving the job and then trying to do all those things that I thought I wanted
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.200]   to do, I realized it wasn't my job holding me back.
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.200]   I was very lucky.
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:19.840]   I was a software developer and the technologies I used allowed me to be very productive very
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:20.840]   quickly.
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:21.840]   So I could get my work done.
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:26.880]   And a quarter of the time that some other teams that I worked amongst were able to do
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:27.880]   it.
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:32.160]   But the timescales were never tight and I had plenty of free time.
[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:38.480]   So it was only once that I removed that easy scapegoat, did I realize that actually I could
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:46.120]   have been doing all of these things with a job and I would have then not had to also
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:50.520]   try to figure out all these crazy post-fi things that come up that you never even expect
[00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.680]   because I would have still been working.
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:06:00.720]   So yeah, I would say one, yeah, just try to remove the easy scapegoats of your job and
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:06.440]   start trying to do these things that you really think you're going to do post-fi because one,
[00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.720]   some things aren't big enough to really get you out of the bed in the morning.
[00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:14.600]   Like I remember I thought like, oh, I'll learn a new language and then that way when we travel
[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:18.840]   to wherever in the world, I'll be able to, you know, know this new language is going
[00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:19.840]   to be amazing.
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.960]   You know, like when you don't have anyone forcing you to get out of bed in the morning
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:30.240]   to conjugate verbs, it's harder to force yourself to do that and you're not exactly leaping
[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:33.280]   out of bed to do that either.
[00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:38.000]   So the more you can like get started on these things while you're still in the grind, the
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.880]   daily grind, I think the way better off you're going to be because one, you're going to have
[00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:46.800]   momentum, you're going to sort of like come across these challenges that have nothing
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:50.920]   to do with your job earlier and start to work through them and realize, hey, actually it's
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:52.160]   not my job that's holding me back.
[00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:56.240]   It's for me, like personally, it was my self-doubt and some of the artistic things I wanted to
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.240]   do.
[00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:03.280]   And yeah, if you, if you just start early and don't think like, I think the other problem
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:07.200]   is like, it's like for me back then it was a finish line.
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:11.760]   Everything was going to be great after that finish line and everything wasn't working
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:13.680]   prior to that finish line.
[00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:16.040]   And I think that was the definitely wrong way to do it.
[00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:20.520]   I think the more you can view it as just a spectrum where every dollar you're saving
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:26.080]   is adding to that power that you have to, you know, take more time off or follow that
[00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:29.720]   passion projects to another level and things like that.
[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:36.140]   I think the better off you'll be and then the less crazy FI or post-FI life would be
[00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:39.200]   after because it's not going to be just like flipping a switch.
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:43.540]   It's going to be this gradual progression into, oh, actually now I have the power to
[00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:48.360]   have unlimited free time and now I know how to deal with that and use it properly because
[00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:52.080]   I've practiced along the way as I've incrementally got more free time.
[00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:56.360]   So that's, that's how I would view it just as a spectrum, not as a goal line.
[00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:57.360]   Excellent.
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:58.360]   Yeah.
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:07:59.360]   That makes a lot of sense.
[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:04.760]   It reminds me of someone interviewed Michael Phelps and in, I think one of the Olympic
[00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:10.200]   runs his goggles failed and water got in his eyes and he had to do the whole thing closed
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:14.220]   with eyes closed and they interviewed him after and said, how was he able to perform
[00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:15.220]   at such a high level?
[00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:18.420]   And he said, he did that in his head over and over again.
[00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:21.180]   So it reminds me of how you're saying prepare.
[00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:25.440]   So following up on a few of the things you mentioned, so you mentioned passion project.
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:31.900]   I think your followers will know that you pursued FI to record and release your own
[00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:33.780]   music and you were able to do that.
[00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:36.540]   So huge congrats again there.
[00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:40.080]   And you know, I know you're, you're modest.
[00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:44.980]   So I'll let folks know that the release went really well and had success on the charts.
[00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:47.540]   Why don't you tell us a bit more about that?
[00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:52.900]   How it was to pursue this lifelong goal and you know, how's it been since?
[00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:53.900]   Yeah.
[00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:54.900]   Yeah.
[00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:58.060]   So you mentioned the charts and like, I'd love to, I'd love that to be because the music
[00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:00.980]   was so amazing and it just got played on radio everywhere.
[00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:04.500]   Actually it was just the mad scientist audience had grown so big over 10 years and I'd never
[00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:05.500]   asked them to do anything.
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:09.440]   And I asked them to buy the album and they, and thousands of them did.
[00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:13.360]   And yeah, it was a ridiculous, a ridiculous one week on the charts.
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:16.440]   And then it was, yeah, that was, that was done.
[00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:18.920]   But yeah, that was, yeah, that was the main goal.
[00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:23.680]   That was again, like I've, I've mentioned a bit earlier that I blamed my job for holding
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:26.340]   me back on that for so long.
[00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:29.920]   But it was only once I quit my job and had all the time in the world to pursue it that
[00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:32.360]   I realized it was way more than that.
[00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:35.320]   It was, it was really just a ton of self doubt.
[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:37.220]   I never thought I could actually do it.
[00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:42.800]   So I was not even trying to do it because I thought if I tried and then failed, I'd
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:45.160]   lose the dream forever.
[00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:49.580]   But and I never wanted to do that because I was like, I really need to write and release
[00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:52.380]   an album one day.
[00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:54.000]   So I didn't want to lose the dream.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.080]   But trying every time I tried, just made it so much more evident that I would never actually
[00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:00.080]   be able to do it.
[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:01.160]   So that's why I just put off doing it.
[00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.000]   So I never made progress.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:10.320]   And it took me till three and a half years after I left my job, before, you know, I finally
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:11.320]   got fed up.
[00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:15.600]   And I was like, look, this is the whole reason I was wanting to have all this free time.
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:19.720]   And in the first years after leaving my job, I filled it with, you know, Mad Fientist stuff,
[00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:23.560]   I filled it with fun stuff, I was saying yes to everything, because I couldn't have all
[00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:24.560]   this time.
[00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:28.640]   And I was like, I need to just really get serious about this.
[00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:30.760]   And it was brutal.
[00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:34.360]   But I, it was actually Atomic Habits by James Clear.
[00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:39.600]   I read his book, got to speak to him on my podcast, which was amazing.
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:46.720]   And it was that coupled with another book called Ultra Learning.
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:51.200]   And then there was a music specific one that I, it was just an ebook, but it was actually
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:52.560]   phenomenal.
[00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:57.160]   So if any musicians out there care, I'll send you a link to that, because it's not a very
[00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:58.160]   big book.
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:03.320]   But it was very instrumental in me actually making progress.
[00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:07.600]   And all of that at the end of the day, just boiled down to like putting in the time.
[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:12.120]   So sitting in the chair and being uncomfortable and just forcing yourself to do that.
[00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:16.480]   And trying to not focus on what you produce by the end of that day.
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:22.000]   Just focusing on okay, I put five hours into the chair, and it was all mostly productive,
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.240]   you know, like, I would lose confidence, I would lose willpower.
[00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:29.200]   And by the end of the day, I was like watching YouTube tutorials, which, you know, was not
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:35.480]   really productive, but I could sort of make it seem productive for my five hours, at least.
[00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:36.920]   So anyway, it took all of that.
[00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:40.800]   And then the pandemic hit.
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:47.040]   And then I just locked myself inside for 15 months, because Scotland was very locked down.
[00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:50.640]   My wife's Scottish, and we live in Edinburgh, or we did at that time.
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:56.840]   And just locked myself inside, and never truly believed that I would do it.
[00:11:56.840 --> 00:12:00.480]   And until it came out, and still don't really believe it.
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:01.480]   But I listened to it.
[00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:04.360]   And I'm like, I'm really proud of it.
[00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:08.720]   It was definitely the most challenging thing I've ever tried to do.
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:09.840]   And it meant so much to me.
[00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:10.840]   So yeah, you'll listen to it.
[00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:12.600]   It's not like Grammy Award winning stuff.
[00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:17.760]   It's like my weird, like synthesizer, like experimental synth pop stuff that I loved
[00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:18.760]   growing up.
[00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:21.560]   So it's a really weird genre of music.
[00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:28.640]   But it's, yeah, my only goal line was that I was comfortable enough with it to release
[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:29.800]   it.
[00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:30.800]   And I did.
[00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:37.040]   So that it's, that was the highlight, and was the whole reason I wanted to pursue Phi
[00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:38.040]   in the first place.
[00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:41.240]   And like I said before, I didn't actually need to be Phi to do it.
[00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:44.360]   But I sort of did as well, because that took away all my excuses.
[00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:45.360]   Yeah.
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:47.320]   Well, congrats again on achieving that.
[00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:48.360]   It's tremendous.
[00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:54.160]   And I'm not typically a synth pop listener, but absolutely enjoyed your music.
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:56.680]   So thanks again for getting it out there.
[00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:59.400]   So a few things.
[00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:04.120]   One is a lot of folks in the Fi space, you know, we'll talk about, of course, saving
[00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:08.360]   and investing and reducing your living expenses and increasing your savings rate.
[00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:14.080]   And I think folks, you know, interested in pursuing it have a lot of access to that information.
[00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:21.220]   A more common underlying message that surfaces is a lot of this is about happiness, right?
[00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:28.580]   So can you elaborate on what happiness is, you know, like for you, or what success means
[00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:29.580]   to you?
[00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:34.600]   And for this audience, the Bogleheads famously are not defined by fancy house or fancy car,
[00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:39.040]   even though many of them could easily afford that, sometimes many times over.
[00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:45.720]   So yeah, what does success mean to you and how has it been in early retirement?
[00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:46.720]   Yeah.
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:53.160]   Well, success is to me, those personal wins, like I can think back over the last 10 years
[00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:57.040]   and the things I'm most proud of are things that, you know, I haven't shouted about or
[00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:01.680]   told, you know, anybody about really, and it's just those, like knowing how hard I worked
[00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:06.520]   on that album and all of the hurdles that I had to overcome that, like, that's what
[00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:07.520]   I'm super proud of.
[00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:12.040]   And getting on the Billboard charts for a week is funny and just adds to the ridiculousness
[00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:14.840]   of my life in a great way.
[00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:20.620]   Like it's so funny to think about every time I think about it, but that's nothing.
[00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:26.600]   It's thinking back at all those things that I had to overcome and yeah, happiness is a
[00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:35.160]   tricky one because I had a great comment on my last post and it was, I was sort of talking
[00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:40.280]   about happiness and like finding new sources of motivation after five, because people like
[00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:44.920]   me who think about money since I was a, you know, a kid, I was there, my parents were
[00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:48.440]   throwing quarters in the deep end of the pool and I would spend all day like finding money
[00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:50.000]   and I just loved it.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   So for somebody who's where money has been so important for so long, for now that to
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:59.040]   not matter anymore because I don't want the fancy house or the fancy cars or I don't want
[00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:01.720]   to waste money in any way and things like that.
[00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:06.720]   So that's been really interesting to try to come to grips with that and find new sources
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:09.760]   of motivation because now I don't have to do anything.
[00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:15.000]   And as I said in like my most recent post, it's like a lot of the really fun things have
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:21.920]   a lot of discomfort up front, but now that I don't have money driving me through that
[00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:27.280]   initial discomfort, I'm worried that I'm missing out on some like longer term fun in some areas
[00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:30.360]   just because, you know, I'm like, well, I don't want to do that.
[00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:33.600]   I don't have to do that because I don't need to earn another dollar or whatever.
[00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:37.060]   So yeah, happiness is a tricky one.
[00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:41.600]   And in that, so this goes back to the comment I was going to mention.
[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:44.000]   So it was, I thought it was really insightful.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:50.960]   The guy had said, I think as humans, we always need something to be uncomfortable with or
[00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:55.600]   unhappy about or striving for something better.
[00:15:55.600 --> 00:16:01.200]   And he brought up the fact that like, you know, there's a lot of maybe I'm not too big
[00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:05.840]   in the rest of the Phi community anymore just because I've been working on the music stuff.
[00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:09.600]   But apparently in the Phi community, there's lots of like divorces happening and things
[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:15.560]   and people reach Phi and then, you know, they need that unhappiness.
[00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:17.920]   So they find it in their partner or things like that.
[00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:24.540]   And I can see how that happens because, you know, I could throw everything at my job and
[00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:27.100]   be like, that's why my boss is making me mad.
[00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:30.000]   My colleagues are making me mad and that's why I'm unhappy.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   But then when you can control everything and do whatever you want, then you either have
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.240]   to come to accept that, oh, it's just you that's finding those things to be unhappy
[00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:46.560]   about or angry about, or you, you know, sometimes sadly maybe put it on the person closest to
[00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:49.640]   you or the people around you.
[00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:56.420]   So yeah, so it's still one that I haven't figured out yet and I'm like, that's not to
[00:16:56.420 --> 00:17:01.260]   say like I feel so lucky and I'm definitely happier now having been able to pursue all
[00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:05.060]   these things that I've always wanted to and, you know, not have the stresses of money or
[00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:09.560]   worrying about, you know, the markets are tanking or anything like that.
[00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:15.060]   But yeah, it's not a golden ticket to just happiness and rainbows, which I think early
[00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:20.020]   me when I was pursuing it, I put that on FI, I was like, well, yeah, I'll be happy when
[00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:21.020]   I'm FI.
[00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:23.900]   So I'll just be miserable now and just grind it out.
[00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:29.600]   And again, going back to the advice that I was given earlier is like, yeah, don't put
[00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:32.460]   off happiness until the finish line either.
[00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:35.100]   Don't put off, you know, pursuing your things that you want to do.
[00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:39.420]   Don't put off thinking about what post FI life is going to look like because yeah, when
[00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:42.660]   you cross the finish line, it's just at the end of the day, it's just a slightly higher
[00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:48.180]   number on the screen and it really maybe is more anticlimactic than you may expect it
[00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:49.180]   to be.
[00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:50.180]   Got it.
[00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:51.180]   Yeah.
[00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:52.420]   Very insightful stuff.
[00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:54.380]   So two particular things.
[00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:58.840]   So let's say a two part question, one building on your comments.
[00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:01.000]   One is this concept of enough, right?
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:06.940]   You and I know people in the FI space and life in general who had earned a lot, can
[00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:13.760]   still earn a lot and really adjusted this mindset to just say, you know, any additional
[00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:15.980]   money has very little marginal value.
[00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:21.000]   Why, why am I needing to work or seeking work?
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.080]   But there are also people who either enjoy what they do.
[00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:28.700]   Maybe they're entrepreneurs or some people are paid really well, just like the rat race,
[00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:33.360]   but enjoy accumulating, enjoy watching their portfolios grow.
[00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:37.900]   And you know, within the FI community, there's this one more year syndrome, right?
[00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:39.520]   People don't feel comfortable.
[00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:45.760]   Can you elaborate on how you achieve this, I'll call it a Zen like state of you have
[00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:46.760]   enough, right?
[00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:50.500]   We know someone who, who says any additional money he gets, he gives to charity.
[00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:53.760]   And I just feel like that's such an enlightened state, right?
[00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:59.260]   Like we're socialized, like apart from societal influence on the importance of money, there's
[00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:00.740]   a practical importance.
[00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:01.800]   So that's one.
[00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:07.160]   And then the second you spoke about relationships and specifically in the FI community, can
[00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:11.660]   you elaborate on yours to the extent you're comfortable, what it's like being, because
[00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:13.700]   you mentioned publicly, Jill still works.
[00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:16.180]   She loves what she does.
[00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:23.440]   You guys converged in this journey and you know, what has that been like to be?
[00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:28.460]   And I'll talk about like gender roles or societal, you know, pressures or influences to be the,
[00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:34.780]   the spouse who's not working and to be a guy in, you know, not working in, in our society.
[00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:35.780]   Sure.
[00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:36.780]   Oh yeah.
[00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:41.660]   I really don't feel like I've reached any Zen like state sadly, but I'm more, I'm working
[00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:43.300]   towards it.
[00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:49.380]   Again, like I think the big thing for me was never feeling like I needed to impress anyone
[00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:50.380]   with money.
[00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:53.020]   And I think that just gives you such a huge advantage where like, I would rather people
[00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:58.660]   think I was poorer than I am because I just had a, you know, a middle-class upbringing
[00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:05.360]   like you know, like times were always tight and I, my identity is so tied to that.
[00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:11.360]   So to then either go into the next societal brackets you know, upper class or something
[00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:14.060]   would just be a total identity.
[00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:17.060]   I would just, yeah, I don't think my brain could handle it.
[00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:20.380]   So I'm always, so I'm lucky in that sense where I've never felt the need to impress
[00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:24.900]   people with flashy anything.
[00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:33.780]   I wouldn't say I'm Zen yet because you mentioned charity, like I still can't give money away.
[00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:37.820]   I'm not wasting it and that's why I have such a hard trouble spending it because I don't
[00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:38.900]   want to waste it.
[00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:44.220]   And I know one day I'm going to be at that stage where I can make better use of it.
[00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:51.760]   So in this meantime where I still have this psychological hangup, I, yeah, I just, I'm
[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:56.460]   protecting it so that I don't waste it away and have some sort of lifestyle inflation
[00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:59.100]   that causes me to not to be able to give it away.
[00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:04.460]   But there's still part of me that I guess just has this scarcity mindset like, oh, like
[00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:09.220]   I got to keep it all just in case something really bad happens or, and I don't know where
[00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:10.220]   that comes from.
[00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:14.620]   Like I said, maybe it was because times were so tight growing up and I never felt like
[00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:18.700]   we were deprived of anything, but you know, there was, you know, every penny was accounted
[00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:23.980]   for and I still feel that in that my mindset hasn't caught up with the actual situation
[00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:24.980]   yet.
[00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:27.860]   So, so yeah, so a long way to go on the Zen part.
[00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:32.980]   To get to the spouse part, yes, my wife was complete opposite end of the spectrum for
[00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:33.980]   me.
[00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:37.620]   She wasn't, she never spent money to like impress other people.
[00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:40.960]   So I don't think it was like that far, but she never, she just didn't care about money.
[00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:45.260]   So if it was in their, her account, she would spend it and if it wasn't, she wouldn't want
[00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:47.060]   to think, think too much about it.
[00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:52.260]   Whereas I was like, you know, spreadsheets for everything and go into, you know, knowing
[00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:55.520]   what I bought at this store versus this store and all that stuff.
[00:21:55.520 --> 00:22:01.520]   So yeah, thankfully we've come together and she's a lot more conscious of spending and
[00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:07.240]   money and I'm not as crazy about it, which has worked out great.
[00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:09.500]   And as you said, she's, she loves her job.
[00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:10.860]   She's an optometrist.
[00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:15.980]   She can't think of anything else she'd want to do, but she's also seen the benefits of
[00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:16.980]   having savings.
[00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:25.660]   So to go to COVID at the beginning of the pandemic in Scotland, her thing, people weren't
[00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:31.020]   taking it as seriously as we felt needed to be, you know, things needed to be taken care
[00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:32.060]   of.
[00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:35.980]   So she was able to just say, look, I'm not, I'm just not coming in.
[00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:40.700]   And then she, yeah, she was off for the first three or four months of the pandemic because
[00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:44.780]   she was worried about giving this to her elderly patients and she didn't think the PPE was
[00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:45.940]   all in the right state.
[00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:48.500]   And then once that came back, she was able to go back.
[00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:52.220]   And then for the past like six months, we've been traveling to the States since we were
[00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:56.980]   finally able to, and we've been able to see friends and family.
[00:22:56.980 --> 00:22:58.820]   So she's obviously not worked that time.
[00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:02.900]   So she's seen the benefits of that.
[00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:06.480]   And obviously I've seen the benefits of not being so crazy with money.
[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:10.660]   So thankfully we have met in the middle and I think we've both made each other better
[00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:13.380]   with our relationships with money.
[00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:21.220]   But as far as her working and me not, one, like this is going to sound crazy cause I'm,
[00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:26.980]   you know, I've been writing about financial independence on the internet since 2012, but
[00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:30.620]   I really don't like talking about it to people I know in real life.
[00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:34.500]   So I still just say I'm a software developer that works from home, which is technically
[00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:39.220]   true because I write software for the Mad Scientist website.
[00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:43.340]   But yeah, I feel really weird talking about that in person.
[00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:51.780]   So yeah, I'm at home, but I was at home before we, before I even hit FI and again, I don't
[00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:59.840]   think it bothers me that, even if that wasn't the case and I was, if all of our friends
[00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:05.100]   thought I was just unemployed and she was working, yeah, I don't know how I would feel
[00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:06.100]   about that.
[00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:10.860]   I don't think, I would hope I wouldn't care that much because again, like the things that
[00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:16.380]   drive me or the personal things that I accomplish that, you know, I still don't, I don't tell
[00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:19.740]   anybody, anybody about anyway.
[00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:22.140]   So I think I'd, I'd hope that I would be okay with that.
[00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:28.100]   But you know, like I said, it's harder to, reality is often way different than you imagine
[00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:29.100]   it would be.
[00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:31.020]   So yeah, but so far I haven't had any issue.
[00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:35.420]   Cause again, I just mostly tell people I'm a, I work from home for myself as a software
[00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:36.420]   developer.
[00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:37.420]   Excellent.
[00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:38.420]   Great to hear.
[00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:41.520]   So that spawns another two part question.
[00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:50.340]   One is COVID and I know historically you said you saved enough, but your, you know, passive
[00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:55.300]   income stream was sufficient that you didn't need to withdraw from your portfolio.
[00:24:55.300 --> 00:25:00.260]   And I know that this audience would be very curious about your withdrawal strategy.
[00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:06.280]   So maybe if you can elaborate, maybe during COVID you needed to test it or how you envision
[00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:08.620]   it if you haven't needed to test it.
[00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:16.900]   And then within the, you know, the actual FI experience, if you could talk more about
[00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:18.220]   the highs and lows of it.
[00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:20.020]   So what surprised you?
[00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:21.700]   Were you blindsided by anything?
[00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:27.980]   Were there some disappointing surprises and then some like phenomenal surprises you didn't
[00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:28.980]   even consider?
[00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:29.980]   Sure.
[00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:36.180]   So the first thing I haven't had to withdraw with Joe working and with the side income
[00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:45.060]   that has grown probably over the last three or four years, I guess when, whenever FI really
[00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:50.320]   took off, I guess that was maybe 2018 when it seemed to be in mainstream media and stuff.
[00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:54.500]   So then the MADFINES has started earning more income than we spend.
[00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:55.500]   So I can't speak to that.
[00:25:55.500 --> 00:26:02.540]   My plan was always to, you know, do the safe withdrawal rates, just I'd never imagined
[00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:07.180]   I would increase it with inflation as allowed for.
[00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:12.500]   I felt that I would be very flexible in my withdrawals.
[00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:17.300]   Since we don't have a lot of fixed costs, a lot of our spending is just discretionary.
[00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:22.100]   So the plan was to just tighten up and down years and then go back to three and a half
[00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:29.980]   percent was my floor withdrawal rates, but then 4% plus and better years potentially.
[00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:35.900]   So yeah, 3.5% was my target and that's still what I base all of our spending on now.
[00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:42.220]   I'm actually, like I said, I'm trying to loosen up with spending because I'm still the frugal
[00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:46.340]   college student I was 20 years ago and I'm trying to break out of that.
[00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:50.460]   I spoke to Ramit Sethi about that on my podcast and I'm hopefully going to get him back because
[00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:57.180]   I feel like I've made some strides in that slightly, but now I'm trying to force myself
[00:26:57.180 --> 00:27:07.260]   to spend that 3.5% withdrawal, which we've been shy of ever since we hit five.
[00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:12.780]   So yeah, I wish I could talk more, but like I said, I don't have any first-hand experience,
[00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:18.340]   so I'm not going to go on about what I theoretically would do, because that doesn't really help
[00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:19.340]   anybody.
[00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:27.600]   And then the second question, the surprise is, yeah, one is losing money as a source
[00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:30.900]   of motivation.
[00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:32.620]   That wasn't what I expected.
[00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:39.820]   I always thought, wow, just do fun stuff with it.
[00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:43.900]   But as part of that experimentation I told you about earlier, we experimented one year
[00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:49.020]   and we traveled the whole year and we ate out four or five nights a week and we tried
[00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:53.300]   all that stuff and realized it's actually way more fun when it's special and you get
[00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:57.460]   to look forward to it over a few months and you plan for it.
[00:27:57.460 --> 00:27:58.460]   Same with eating out.
[00:27:58.460 --> 00:28:02.420]   It's like, well, if it's a Friday night thing, then you're looking forward to Friday night.
[00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:04.220]   So we've tried a lot of that stuff.
[00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:09.260]   So I guess pre-fi, I would have thought that, oh, if we had extra money, this is going to
[00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:10.260]   be great.
[00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:12.900]   We could go do even more fun stuff.
[00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:20.020]   But through experimentation, I feel like we've got the sweet spot and more is not necessarily
[00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:21.020]   better.
[00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:22.500]   In a lot of cases, it's worse.
[00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:27.660]   So that was a big surprise and that's still something I'm trying to come to grips with.
[00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:36.740]   I haven't even talked to you about this, Glory, but I realized now that my cheapness was the
[00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:39.760]   only thing keeping my eating in check when we're traveling.
[00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:46.340]   So when we go somewhere, sightseeing is just the stuff I do in between eating and drinking
[00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:51.140]   and tasting all the foods and trying all the different stuff.
[00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:55.500]   And on these past trips, ever since we've been able to travel since COVID, I've just
[00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:56.500]   gone crazy.
[00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:59.900]   And I realized that the only thing that was keeping that in check was my frugality and
[00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:01.100]   my cheapness.
[00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:05.780]   And now that that's not there, it's like, well, I'd need some self-control, I guess,
[00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:08.660]   when it comes to food and drinks.
[00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:17.100]   So yeah, it's things like that you don't really think about, but then, yeah, they rear their
[00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:20.140]   head when your situation changes.
[00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:22.660]   So that was a surprise.
[00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:27.980]   I think just the peace of mind has been fantastic.
[00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:29.900]   Like I said, I still feel like a teenager.
[00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:37.240]   So the thought of my car breaking down still gives me some stress and anxiety.
[00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:43.220]   But having enough and then having more than enough has eased that and been like, okay,
[00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:49.860]   we can handle the car breaking or an unexpected repair and things like that, that I think
[00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:56.660]   has really drastically improved my baseline, just at easeness, I guess.
[00:29:56.660 --> 00:29:58.660]   So that's been fantastic.
[00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:05.500]   And then I'm trying to think if there's anything else that's been really, yeah, no, those are
[00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:06.500]   some of the big ones.
[00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:10.660]   If anything comes up when we're talking, I'll be sure to add it.
[00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:12.580]   But yeah, those are the big ones.
[00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:17.580]   And then, yeah, just realizing that all your excuses before, all the blame I was placing
[00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:23.060]   on my job was just totally misplaced and it was all the internal stuff and stuff that
[00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:29.300]   I still had to deal with, yeah, just the self-doubt and the motivation, the procrastination, all
[00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:30.300]   that stuff.
[00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:31.380]   Yeah, it wasn't my job.
[00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:32.860]   So those are the big ones.
[00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:33.940]   Got it.
[00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:39.980]   So thanks for sharing, especially some of these vulnerable topics like what you're opening
[00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:42.080]   up about, a lot of it's personal.
[00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:46.020]   So some of the things, I think it's funny to hear your comments about Ramit for a lot
[00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:51.820]   of folks in the space, there are diehard mustachians, folks who read Mr. Money Mustache and whose
[00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:54.300]   blog changed their lives.
[00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:59.860]   And then Ramit, I would joke to myself, I really value his content as well.
[00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:04.500]   But in my head, I think of him as somewhat of the anti-mustachian.
[00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:08.340]   So I understand that you felt liberated to some extent.
[00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:12.820]   I'd love to hear more about what you've grown to enjoy spending on.
[00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:14.100]   You mentioned food.
[00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:17.380]   And then I'd also love to hear about the evolution of travel.
[00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:19.860]   It sounds like we all want to travel.
[00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:24.540]   It's a very common primary goal, and then some people travel a lot.
[00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:30.700]   So it sounds like your ambition for travel has kind of perhaps changed.
[00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:32.360]   So I'd love to hear more about that.
[00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:40.060]   And then on the topic of travel and living abroad, how has being financially independent,
[00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:43.940]   living abroad, how do you feel that would differ from living in the States?
[00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:49.700]   I think a lot of people in the FI space consider moving abroad, and they try to optimize where
[00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:52.100]   they're going to live, either travel around or settle.
[00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:53.660]   So your thoughts on those.
[00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:54.660]   Yeah, sure.
[00:31:54.660 --> 00:32:00.500]   Yeah, I'll address the anti-mustachian Ramit, which I thought too, and that's why I was
[00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:05.420]   so excited to get him on my show, because I was like, yeah, you are the opposite ends
[00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:06.420]   of the spectrum.
[00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:09.980]   I think they say a lot of the same things in just different ways.
[00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:17.700]   But I think having both in your year is great, and I was lucky to talk to both of them.
[00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:23.060]   And again, I'm going to be going back to Ramit, because I feel like I'm naturally like Mr.
[00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:24.740]   Money Mustache.
[00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:27.200]   That's my natural inclination, I guess.
[00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:34.100]   So having Ramit there, challenging all that stuff that, yeah, me listening to MMM is like
[00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:35.100]   an echo chamber.
[00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:37.300]   So it's like I'm not really getting anything out of that.
[00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:44.780]   But Ramit challenges me, and as far as some of the stuff that has helped me not be so
[00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:50.300]   crazy with the spending, which I believe you asked me, but I'm not sure if you want me
[00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:55.780]   to talk about something else, I believe that was part of the question about Ramit.
[00:32:55.780 --> 00:32:57.980]   It was reframing things.
[00:32:57.980 --> 00:33:05.420]   So one of the things that's helped is like $10 to me is just as valuable as it was when
[00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:07.820]   I was a college student.
[00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:09.060]   It's in my mind, it's the same.
[00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:10.060]   It's like, that's $10.
[00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:15.040]   I'm not going to waste $10, or I'm going to save $10 if I can.
[00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:21.420]   So the trick that I've been doing recently is anytime I'm like freaking out about a expense
[00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:26.860]   that I think I really shouldn't be freaking out about, I calculate what that expense is
[00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:33.660]   like in my college years, because that's where my brain feels like still is with money.
[00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:42.920]   So taking my net worth back in 2000, and dividing it by my net worth now, and then timesing
[00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:48.420]   it by the expense that I'm worried about, and then it'll be like, oh, that's a nickel.
[00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:53.580]   You're actually stressing out about a nickel in college times.
[00:33:53.580 --> 00:33:58.060]   So that's been helpful.
[00:33:58.060 --> 00:34:04.140]   And then forcing myself to spend what the portfolio should allow me to spend has been
[00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:09.860]   really nice, because it's made me a lot more generous, which is something I've always wanted
[00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:10.860]   to be.
[00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:14.380]   But I always was, like I said before, I'm always like, oh, every penny I need to squeeze
[00:34:14.380 --> 00:34:17.460]   it tight in case anything happens.
[00:34:17.460 --> 00:34:20.420]   Whereas now this year, it's like going out to dinner with my family.
[00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:24.580]   It's like, hurry up and try to pay before anybody else even has a chance, and same with
[00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:26.140]   drinks with friends and things like that.
[00:34:26.140 --> 00:34:29.580]   So that's been really nice, because it's like, well, I've got to spend it this year.
[00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:34.140]   I'm forcing myself to spend that much, and there's no way I'm going to do that naturally,
[00:34:34.140 --> 00:34:37.960]   because like I said, I feel like we've dialed in our spending quite well.
[00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:47.660]   So anything more is just going to be maybe not as useful or not bring as much happiness.
[00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:51.820]   So then, yeah, doing those things day to day has been really nice, just because before
[00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:53.140]   I would have maybe stressed about that.
[00:34:53.140 --> 00:34:56.620]   You got to dinner with friends, and somebody orders the fancy cocktail, and you're drinking
[00:34:56.620 --> 00:34:57.620]   water.
[00:34:57.620 --> 00:35:01.540]   And then you're like, oh, and that's the mindset I was in when I was a student.
[00:35:01.540 --> 00:35:05.420]   I want to get out of that, and now the times have changed.
[00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:07.380]   Forcing myself to spend that this year.
[00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:10.500]   And again, I'm not wasting any money, because like I said, I don't want to waste money.
[00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:17.620]   I want to protect it in case one day I definitely will be giving it away.
[00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:26.180]   And the third thing that's helped with that is also allowing myself to enjoy investment.
[00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:32.340]   So rather than just dump all my money into Vanguard index funds, which is what I've done
[00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:41.700]   for the last 20 years, instead, I'm thinking about buying a house, for example.
[00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:43.400]   So to me, that's an ultimate luxury.
[00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:49.220]   It's not really a great investment, but I think it's a luxury that I'm really looking
[00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:51.860]   forward to right now, and my wife is as well.
[00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:58.520]   So in my mind, as I think about it as an investment, rather than me spending on myself, which that
[00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:02.480]   makes it a lot easier to accept.
[00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:05.280]   So I think that's something we're going to do over the next few months, is buy a house
[00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:10.760]   in Scotland, and hopefully make it really comfortable and nice and all of that.
[00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:15.980]   And then for the music stuff, it's like, instead of buying the cheapest synthesizer
[00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:22.520]   that'll let me make the sounds, I buy the one that's going to hold its value the best,
[00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:27.920]   and it's going to maybe be a future classic that is going to maybe even go up in value.
[00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:33.160]   So that's helping me spend a bit more in the near term, but then hopefully getting a lot
[00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:41.060]   of enjoyment out of it, and then maybe even making it an investment where I'm, if not
[00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:43.080]   making money, at least not losing money.
[00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:52.360]   And that's been helpful in mentally being able to spend on myself a little bit more.
[00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:56.320]   And I'm sorry, but I forgot the second question.
[00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:59.400]   Living abroad versus being FI in the States.
[00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:00.400]   Sure.
[00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:01.400]   Yeah.
[00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:05.800]   So luckily, so that was one thing I never skimped on when we were in our 20s, and I'm
[00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:06.800]   thankful for that.
[00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:07.800]   We did travel.
[00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:09.640]   I was really good at travel hacking.
[00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:12.240]   That's like, I love doing stuff like that.
[00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:16.680]   That's like having spreadsheets and plans, and that's like how my brain loves to be all
[00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:17.680]   the time.
[00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:20.200]   So travel hacking was just right in my wheelhouse.
[00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:29.160]   So we visited, I think, 50 countries over our lifetime so far, and we had great, great
[00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:31.480]   trips, and it didn't break the bank.
[00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:36.720]   But obviously, yeah, especially since now that COVID has sort of made travel a bit less
[00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:41.320]   fun where I'm so glad I didn't skimp on that when we were younger.
[00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:47.600]   But now, I don't know if it's because I'm older, I'm turning 40 this year.
[00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:48.600]   I don't know.
[00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:53.160]   I feel like I've got that out of my system.
[00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:54.800]   I feel like it's out of my system.
[00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:59.760]   And now, we just flip-flop back between Scotland and America because my wife's family is in
[00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:03.040]   Scotland and my family is in America.
[00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:08.640]   And luckily, those are two great, beautiful, rich places that have so much to offer that
[00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:14.340]   you can continue to explore for a lifetime and not get bored with them.
[00:38:14.340 --> 00:38:16.160]   So we're always so excited to do that.
[00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:19.520]   But now, I think our travel is more based around people.
[00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:24.340]   So it's not, "All right, which country could we go to to see these things or eat these
[00:38:24.340 --> 00:38:25.400]   foods or whatever?"
[00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:30.320]   It's now like, "All right, where could we go to see these people and have fun with them?"
[00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:32.560]   So that's been a huge shift.
[00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:37.280]   So I think travel is going to decrease for us in the future as well.
[00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:41.440]   It's just going to be mainly just bouncing between those two places.
[00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:49.600]   As far as how that impacts Fi, I know travel in my 20s was very impactful in showing me
[00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:54.600]   that what I thought was normal in America was actually extremely extravagant.
[00:38:54.600 --> 00:39:00.160]   And there's a lot of really unfortunate situations out there where people are really struggling
[00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:01.420]   to get by.
[00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:06.760]   And that allowed me to keep my spending in check, I think, and never feel like I deserved
[00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:09.080]   nicer things or anything like that.
[00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:10.080]   So that was huge.
[00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:15.140]   Just having given me the mindset to save so much money over those years.
[00:39:15.140 --> 00:39:22.060]   But as far as now, I just became a British citizen on July 1st, which was really exciting
[00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:26.360]   after so long and so many applications trying to get it.
[00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:28.560]   So now we don't have to worry about visas and stuff.
[00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:32.040]   But obviously, the healthcare thing, that's a huge weight off my chest now.
[00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:38.640]   I guess it's like the national healthcare, National Health Service is fantastic in Scotland.
[00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:43.920]   So there are benefits in places.
[00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:48.000]   It's probably more difficult to pursue Fi there, just because of the higher taxes and
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   things like that.
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:54.480]   And there's less loopholes, which is what my whole site was built on back in the earlier
[00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:59.600]   days was just finding interesting loopholes for early retirees or future early retirees.
[00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:02.320]   So there's a lot less of that.
[00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:04.920]   But then there's a bigger social safety net.
[00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:07.520]   So you have a lot more stuff covered as well.
[00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:11.800]   So yeah, I don't know if that exactly answers your question, but hopefully it's helpful.
[00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:13.200]   Yeah, that was very helpful.
[00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:14.200]   Thanks.
[00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:15.200]   So a few things.
[00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:19.880]   In what you said, one is that you're considering buying a house, I'm certain that the Boglehead
[00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:25.000]   audience would like to hear more about, especially given how analytical you are, and how, you
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:28.880]   know, you commented, it's not necessarily a good investment, or it's often not a good
[00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:29.880]   investment.
[00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:35.080]   But also, if you could talk about on top of that, share your thoughts.
[00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:40.080]   So you mentioned you were considering buying real estate as a part time investment.
[00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:46.680]   So you mentioned, you know, like a unit near a ski resort that you could you could use
[00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:50.840]   personally when you in ski season, and then you could rent it out when you're not using
[00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:51.840]   it.
[00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:52.840]   And then COVID happened.
[00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:53.840]   So obviously, that changed.
[00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:57.520]   But how are your your thoughts going forward on that?
[00:40:57.520 --> 00:40:58.760]   Does it still interest you?
[00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:04.600]   And then can you elaborate on your purchase analysis and how you decided where you're
[00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:05.600]   currently leaning?
[00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:06.600]   Sure.
[00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:07.600]   Yeah, no.
[00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:10.040]   So that that plan is pretty much out the window.
[00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:15.040]   And again, that's always me coming back to my default, which is like, how could I optimize
[00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:18.040]   this for the numbers as perfectly as possible?
[00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:23.640]   And that that whole plan of having two places, one in Scotland, one in America.
[00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:29.080]   And the thought was that we would buy in places that the peak tourist season was pretty much
[00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:30.080]   opposite.
[00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:35.960]   So we could live in the non high peak tourist place while we rent out the peak tourist place,
[00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:38.880]   and then use that money to pay for the other one and then vice versa.
[00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:40.920]   And it was all a numbers thing in it.
[00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:45.320]   And that's again, it's just old habits die hard, I'm trying to get out of making numbers
[00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:50.080]   only decisions, which is where Ramit comes in, where he's like, there's more than a spreadsheet
[00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:52.240]   and you have to live outside the spreadsheet.
[00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:58.280]   And, you know, sometimes decisions should be more than just like optimizing numbers.
[00:41:58.280 --> 00:42:07.440]   So I realized like, all the stress that could come from renting things out, and, and, and
[00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:10.600]   at least I know myself well enough to know that that would just cause a huge amount of
[00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:15.960]   stress because yeah, I'm an introverted guy, and I do enjoy interacting with people.
[00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:21.400]   But yeah, conflict with people that I just know that if I'm a landlord, I'm not going
[00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:25.540]   to be too happy, and I'll probably be a lot more stressed.
[00:42:25.540 --> 00:42:27.280]   So it would just add a lot of negative things.
[00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:28.760]   And yeah, the numbers may be great.
[00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:32.520]   But yeah, I don't think would actually benefit.
[00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:39.800]   So so now the idea is to just buy a base in Scotland, you know, finally get to enjoy some
[00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:44.520]   of our stuff that has been we just literally today, Jill and I were in that closet, I'm
[00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:50.000]   at my dad's house, going through that closet, because there's boxes in there that we haven't
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:53.960]   seen since we moved out of Vermont, like six years ago or something.
[00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:57.340]   So yeah, being reunited with all that stuff is going to be nice.
[00:42:57.340 --> 00:42:59.620]   And then we can just store it all in Scotland.
[00:42:59.620 --> 00:43:02.580]   And then when we come to the states, and yeah, if we want to go skiing, we can just rent
[00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:07.140]   an Airbnb or if we want to, you know, come to Pittsburgh and see all of my family here,
[00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:11.100]   we can just rent an apartment in the city or I think it'll allow us to be a lot more
[00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:13.700]   flexible in the states.
[00:43:13.700 --> 00:43:16.460]   And then in Scotland, we'll have a home base to go back to.
[00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:20.820]   And that's when I can, you know, the idea is to like, yeah, Scotland will be the place
[00:43:20.820 --> 00:43:26.540]   where we can get stuff done and see Jill's family and just really spend time with them.
[00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:30.300]   And Jill can work if she wants to pick up some shifts and things like that.
[00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:35.140]   And in the states, we can just use that time to see people here and have fun and do things
[00:43:35.140 --> 00:43:36.900]   like skiing and visiting friends.
[00:43:36.900 --> 00:43:38.780]   So so yeah, it's changed quite a lot.
[00:43:38.780 --> 00:43:45.500]   And then as far as the end of the analysis for buying a place in Scotland, not really
[00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:50.600]   not really looking at it numbers based trying not to at least we know where we want to be,
[00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:52.740]   we know the type of property we want.
[00:43:52.740 --> 00:43:57.660]   Thankfully, it hasn't popped up yet, because we're in the states for we're not going to
[00:43:57.660 --> 00:44:00.880]   be back in Scotland till mid October.
[00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:03.220]   So hopefully, we can deal with that when we get back.
[00:44:03.220 --> 00:44:07.420]   But yeah, I think it's hopefully, hopefully just going to be the property that decides
[00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:13.740]   it and not any crazy number analysis for me and I can just, I have some money set aside.
[00:44:13.740 --> 00:44:16.100]   It's like for that.
[00:44:16.100 --> 00:44:20.880]   And yeah, hopefully, we just find a property that that works and then try to be homeowners
[00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:24.520]   again after renting for so long now.
[00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:25.520]   That sounds fantastic.
[00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:29.800]   It's a another example of optimizing for happiness.
[00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:34.500]   So I'm sensitive of the group's time, I think we have about four or five minutes before
[00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:36.660]   we go to the group's questions.
[00:44:36.660 --> 00:44:40.600]   So as you and I wrap up, even though clearly, we could, you know, keep talking about so
[00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:42.720]   many different things.
[00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:48.000]   And I think folks, you know, find a lot of this practical and insightful.
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:54.960]   On that note, you've commented that you're, you're not in this five space to be evangelical,
[00:44:54.960 --> 00:45:00.760]   you started the blog to kind of keep yourself accountable, right with an external motivator.
[00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:04.620]   And it helps people who are already interested in the journey.
[00:45:04.620 --> 00:45:08.480]   So this question is really like for a lot of bogal heads, they're the beacon in their
[00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:12.520]   community, whether it's a social circle or family, people come to them for guidance and
[00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:13.520]   advice.
[00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:16.900]   What have you seen in the space, because there's so much advice out there, right?
[00:45:16.900 --> 00:45:21.400]   And certain things resonate with some people more than others, obviously, what have you
[00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:27.240]   seen be most effective for the folks that want to improve, they want to save better,
[00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:31.560]   they want to invest better, but they find it so incredibly challenging?
[00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:35.740]   Yeah, that's, yeah, that's, that's tough.
[00:45:35.740 --> 00:45:39.600]   It's a tough one for me, just because it has come so naturally, like I said before, it's
[00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:44.880]   just been such a focus in my life for some reason, for so long.
[00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:52.920]   I guess it would have to just go back to tracking and really, like, so this is probably a good
[00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:53.920]   actual example.
[00:45:53.920 --> 00:46:02.880]   So I have another personal spreadsheet, where I just in a cell, just one column will have
[00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:06.060]   like all the thing, all the big purchases I made that year.
[00:46:06.060 --> 00:46:11.160]   And then another column will have, and it doesn't like all the spreadsheet purists are
[00:46:11.160 --> 00:46:12.660]   gonna be like, you don't need a spreadsheet for that.
[00:46:12.660 --> 00:46:14.860]   But I just love working with cells.
[00:46:14.860 --> 00:46:18.860]   So then I'll have another column, that's the highlights of the year.
[00:46:18.860 --> 00:46:25.100]   And I think, like, obviously, if I was struggling with that, I think that would be really beneficial
[00:46:25.100 --> 00:46:31.660]   to keep those lists, you know, your big purchases, and then your highlights, and then revisit
[00:46:31.660 --> 00:46:32.900]   it in future years.
[00:46:32.900 --> 00:46:36.780]   And, you know, tracking your spending is obviously huge.
[00:46:36.780 --> 00:46:40.820]   And I think like, yeah, tracking your spending, and then tracking these big purchases, I think
[00:46:40.820 --> 00:46:46.740]   would be the first step because I feel like a lot of people maybe are just, you know,
[00:46:46.740 --> 00:46:50.060]   buying what other people think, or they see other people doing that, and they're buying
[00:46:50.060 --> 00:46:53.720]   and it's really not adding to their happiness in any way.
[00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:57.620]   So I think writing those things down, and then looking back on it, be like, Oh, actually,
[00:46:57.620 --> 00:47:02.020]   those things weren't really that important, or that trip wasn't that great.
[00:47:02.020 --> 00:47:03.300]   Or eating out wasn't that great.
[00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:09.660]   So yeah, but again, though, I'm like I said, I'm, I'm so naturally focused on this stuff
[00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:14.800]   that it's a bit harder for me to think about what would be really beneficial.
[00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:21.100]   But I think, even now, as I'm trying to come to grips with my new spending patterns, it's
[00:47:21.100 --> 00:47:22.420]   been helpful for me.
[00:47:22.420 --> 00:47:24.300]   And it's something Yeah, that I still do.
[00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:29.420]   So it's just recording all the all the big purchases, all the highlights, and then trying
[00:47:29.420 --> 00:47:35.100]   to figure out, what does that mean for what I actually enjoy or get value out of?
[00:47:35.100 --> 00:47:36.100]   Great.
[00:47:36.100 --> 00:47:38.260]   Yeah, that's, it's definitely helpful to hear.
[00:47:38.260 --> 00:47:47.260]   And for folks who who don't know, mad scientist compiled a PDF of the one piece of advice
[00:47:47.260 --> 00:47:49.980]   answers that he got from his podcast guests.
[00:47:49.980 --> 00:47:54.780]   So that's available at mad scientist slash advice, I believe you go to that, enter your
[00:47:54.780 --> 00:47:58.100]   email, you'll get that PDF, basically instantly.
[00:47:58.100 --> 00:48:02.820]   So in closing, before we turn it over to audience questions, you mentioned James clear as atomic
[00:48:02.820 --> 00:48:03.820]   habits.
[00:48:03.820 --> 00:48:06.840]   I think that's a universal favorite.
[00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:11.220]   Everyone I know that's read it just kind of swears by it on top of the other habit books
[00:48:11.220 --> 00:48:14.060]   out there that preceded it.
[00:48:14.060 --> 00:48:15.060]   Very practical.
[00:48:15.060 --> 00:48:20.740]   And you mentioned ultra learning any other books you recommend or documentaries, especially
[00:48:20.740 --> 00:48:24.700]   for the bogal head crowd doesn't need to be finance related could be, you know, spanning
[00:48:24.700 --> 00:48:25.700]   life.
[00:48:25.700 --> 00:48:26.700]   Yeah.
[00:48:26.700 --> 00:48:32.540]   Um, so JL Collins, the author of The Simple Path to Wealth, he was my second podcast guest
[00:48:32.540 --> 00:48:37.140]   way back in 2012, way before The Simple Path to Wealth.
[00:48:37.140 --> 00:48:44.500]   And he had recommended how to obtain freedom in an unfree world, Harry Brown.
[00:48:44.500 --> 00:48:47.780]   And there's a lot in that book that are, you know, like, I definitely don't agree with
[00:48:47.780 --> 00:48:49.780]   it all.
[00:48:49.780 --> 00:48:53.460]   My wife particularly had big issues with some of it.
[00:48:53.460 --> 00:49:00.860]   But it did make you think a little bit differently about the boxes you put yourself in and the
[00:49:00.860 --> 00:49:07.580]   constraints that are all self imposed, pretty much, I would say in a lot of cases.
[00:49:07.580 --> 00:49:13.780]   And you know, back then 2012, you know, fire wasn't as big of a thing and definitely wasn't
[00:49:13.780 --> 00:49:18.540]   anywhere near mainstream, like it got to be in 2018, or things like that.
[00:49:18.540 --> 00:49:26.100]   So that helped just, yeah, with my mindset at like, oh, actually, society doesn't know
[00:49:26.100 --> 00:49:32.120]   best and these other people don't know best and the things that I think I'm restricted
[00:49:32.120 --> 00:49:36.980]   by aren't actually restrictions, they're just my own mental restrictions.
[00:49:36.980 --> 00:49:41.340]   And I can actually do anything that I really want.
[00:49:41.340 --> 00:49:46.740]   So that was I would say that was a pretty impactful non financial book.
[00:49:46.740 --> 00:49:51.300]   Early Retirement Extreme, that was what got me into this in the first place I saw in 2011.
[00:49:51.300 --> 00:49:59.820]   I think it was that J.D. Roth on Get Rich Slowly had interviewed or had written a book
[00:49:59.820 --> 00:50:02.140]   review of Early Retirement Extreme.
[00:50:02.140 --> 00:50:06.020]   And that that reads like a academic book.
[00:50:06.020 --> 00:50:10.460]   But there's a lot of a lot of great stuff in there that, you know, I've read it at least
[00:50:10.460 --> 00:50:16.020]   three times, and finally got to speak to Jacob just last year, which was a which was a big
[00:50:16.020 --> 00:50:19.860]   thrill for me, because he was the thing that he was the guy that made the light bulb go
[00:50:19.860 --> 00:50:22.220]   off in my head.
[00:50:22.220 --> 00:50:25.340]   So yeah, Early Retirement Extreme is still still one of my favorites.
[00:50:25.340 --> 00:50:31.100]   So those two, I would, I would give as something to check out with an open mind.
[00:50:31.100 --> 00:50:33.180]   And yeah, it's not they're not Bibles.
[00:50:33.180 --> 00:50:35.620]   But yeah, they'll hopefully get you thinking.
[00:50:35.620 --> 00:50:36.620]   Fantastic.
[00:50:36.620 --> 00:50:37.620]   Well, thanks again.
[00:50:37.620 --> 00:50:43.620]   I meant to mention earlier, when we're talking about relationships that your wife, Jill has
[00:50:43.620 --> 00:50:50.500]   a guest post on your blog, and also a podcast conversation that if folks haven't listened
[00:50:50.500 --> 00:50:56.660]   to, I highly recommend those very engaging, very just warm and enjoyable.
[00:50:56.660 --> 00:51:02.600]   So with that, Brandon, thanks again, you're, you know, we're still continuing, but I want
[00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:09.040]   to turn it over to Miriam, Carol, and Manny, and the folks who are running the questions
[00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:10.260]   on the chat.
[00:51:10.260 --> 00:51:12.980]   And those folks will be asking the questions from the audience.
[00:51:12.980 --> 00:51:13.980]   Oh, yeah.
[00:51:13.980 --> 00:51:14.980]   Before you move over.
[00:51:14.980 --> 00:51:15.980]   Thanks a lot, Gorrie.
[00:51:15.980 --> 00:51:16.980]   It's always a pleasure to chat with you.
[00:51:16.980 --> 00:51:19.020]   And yeah, we'll see you back in Edinburgh soon.
[00:51:19.020 --> 00:51:20.020]   Love that.
[00:51:20.020 --> 00:51:21.020]   And likewise.
[00:51:21.020 --> 00:51:22.020]   Thank you, Gorrie.
[00:51:22.020 --> 00:51:24.780]   Thank you, Mad Scientist.
[00:51:24.780 --> 00:51:27.300]   That was a wonderful, wonderful discussion.
[00:51:27.300 --> 00:51:29.340]   I enjoyed it very much.
[00:51:29.340 --> 00:51:32.180]   I'm going to remove you from spotlight.
[00:51:32.180 --> 00:51:38.580]   So hold on here while I do that.
[00:51:38.580 --> 00:51:43.220]   Thank you.
[00:51:43.220 --> 00:51:47.780]   Thank you.
[00:51:47.780 --> 00:52:03.380]   Thank you.
