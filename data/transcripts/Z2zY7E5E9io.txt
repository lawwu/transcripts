[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.920]   This idea that owning stocks is mom American and apple pie and shorting
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:11.260]   stocks somehow is bad and evil and rooting, rooting against America.
[00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:16.180]   And I remember going back to the Enron days, someone, people criticizing me,
[00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.200]   even other people in the press saying, but you took a tip from a short seller.
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:19.900]   They're biased.
[00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.980]   And I, I would say, but, but, but wait, the analysts who have buy ratings on
[00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.580]   stocks and the portfolio managers who own those stocks are biased too.
[00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.440]   They want stocks to go up.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.600]   Everybody's biased.
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.040]   So the trick is a journalist is getting information from all sides and figuring
[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.680]   out who you think is right and what makes sense, but it's not avoiding anybody with
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.320]   any bias, but it was really interesting that people saw the bias on the part of
[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.680]   short sellers and did not see it on the part of, of, of longs.
[00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.120]   And I think there is that preconception that exists broadly, that somehow you
[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.480]   are doing something wrong and you're somehow rooting for a company's failure.
