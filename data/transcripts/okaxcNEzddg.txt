[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.400]   This is a really sharp question.
[00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:12.500]   If God is sovereign, how do we pray for good things while also honoring God's final decision
[00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:13.500]   as the best option?
[00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.000]   This is a question from a listener named Connor.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.880]   Pastor John, how much confidence should we voice in petitioning God for physical healing?
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.000]   It somehow feels wrong or cheap to pray, "God, heal this person," but if you don't, that's
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.580]   okay, your will be done.
[00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.820]   I feel less genuine in my asking God to move on someone's behalf when I constantly also
[00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.420]   acknowledge to myself that He might not, and I must acknowledge it.
[00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.080]   Could you give us an example of how to rightly pray in confidence and with authority on someone
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:47.840]   else's behalf for healing while remaining in full submission to the mystery of God's
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:48.840]   will?
[00:00:48.840 --> 00:01:00.320]   Well, let me say to Connor that at age 72, I wonder if I will go to my grave without
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.800]   having come to a satisfactory answer to this question.
[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:14.200]   I circle back to this question again and again because of the texts that both call us to
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:20.280]   confidence that we will receive from the Father what we ask when we ask in faith, like Mark
[00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:31.040]   11, 23 and 24, and texts that give the Lord Jesus, for example, as a model who, as the
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:40.480]   perfect prayer, said after he made his request, "Nevertheless, not my will but yours be done,"
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:44.120]   Luke 22, 42.
[00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:49.280]   Clearly it was not sin for Jesus to add that qualifier.
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.980]   He didn't sin.
[00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:57.980]   So let me simply give you the pieces of the puzzle of prayer that I keep rearranging in
[00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:05.400]   my mind to try to see the coherent biblical picture, because I know there's a coherent
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.400]   picture.
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.480]   This is the Bible.
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.880]   This is God's Word.
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.680]   If there's a problem, it's a problem with me, not Jesus.
[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.880]   Two of the pieces we've already mentioned, the pieces of the puzzle of prayer.
[00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:26.620]   Strong promises from Jesus in John 15 and John 16 and Mark 11 and elsewhere that whatever
[00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.280]   we ask and believe that we have it, we will receive it.
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:37.280]   And the other piece is Jesus' words, "Nevertheless, not my will but yours be done."
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.560]   Now there are a few other pieces of the puzzle, so let me get those out there on the table,
[00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.680]   see if we can arrange them in an order that might make a picture we can understand.
[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.360]   Jesus said in Matthew 7, "Ask and it will be given you.
[00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.640]   Seek and you will find.
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.200]   Knock and the door will be opened to you.
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.160]   For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.040]   it will be opened.
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.120]   Or which of you, if his son asks for bread, will give him a stone, or if he asks for fish,
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.900]   will give him a serpent?
[00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:13.560]   If you then," now hear this, this is really important for understanding our Father's heart
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:21.440]   in prayer, "If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:29.080]   much more will your Father, who is in heaven, give good things to those who ask him?"
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:36.080]   It has been a great encouragement to me over the years that that last verse, verse 11,
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:45.520]   seems to promise not that God will give exactly what a foolish child sometimes asks, but will
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.720]   always give him good things.
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:54.640]   How much more will your Father, who is in heaven, give good things to those who ask?
[00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:02.640]   So one of the pieces in the puzzle of prayer seems to be that we should always pray not
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:10.300]   with the qualification that God will withhold good things—nevertheless, not my good will,
[00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.140]   but your bad will be done.
[00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.320]   That's not the point of that qualification.
[00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:19.700]   So let's not assume that we're going to qualify our prayers with saying, "Well, I'm asking
[00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.360]   for good things, and God might give a bad thing, and so I guess I have to just submit."
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.360]   That's not what he does.
[00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.680]   He doesn't give bad things to his children.
[00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:35.520]   Rather, we should pray with the confidence that what he gives may be different from what
[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.560]   we ask, and yet good, even better.
[00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:48.520]   So the certainty of our faith may not be for the precise thing we think is best, but our
[00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:56.960]   certainty of faith should rest on the goodness of our Father, who always does what's best
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.140]   for his children.
[00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:06.160]   Now underneath that confidence is what I call the logic of heaven from Romans 8:32.
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:11.640]   He who did not spare his own son, but gave him up for us all.
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:16.800]   So God surrendering his son to die in our place.
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:24.400]   He who gave him up for us all, how will he not freely give us all things with him?
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:32.840]   In other words, because of the blood of Jesus, God has secured, guaranteed, purchased, made
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:36.400]   certain all things.
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:43.040]   Will he not graciously give us all things—and I'm going to interpret that to mean all things
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:49.280]   that we need to do his will, all things that we need to glorify him, all things that we
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:55.280]   need to be eternally happy in the fellowship of God forever.
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:04.200]   This is the assurance that we can have when praying for good in the lives of God's people.
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:10.640]   Another piece in the puzzle that's implied in what we just saw, I think, is that assurance
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:17.840]   in prayer must rest upon revelation that God has given.
[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:25.200]   We don't honor God by assuming we know what's best in any given situation.
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:33.000]   We need a revelation from him in order to have complete confidence that what we're asking
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.320]   for is best.
[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:42.360]   And what he has promised explicitly in Scripture—this is the revelation we have in Matthew 7-11—is
[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:46.480]   that he will give good things to those who ask.
[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:54.640]   So the question now is, how do we bring our requests into alignment with what he regards
[00:06:54.640 --> 00:07:01.280]   as a good thing, the good thing he aims to do through our prayer in this situation?
[00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:04.880]   And here's where another piece of the puzzle comes in.
[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:12.400]   In 1 Corinthians 12, 8, and 9, Paul describes spiritual gifts of the Spirit that not all
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.200]   believers have.
[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:21.880]   He says in verses 8 and 9 of 1 Corinthians 12, "For to the one is given through the Spirit
[00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:26.000]   the utterance of wisdom, and to another the utterance of knowledge, and according to the
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:34.560]   same Spirit, to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healing by the
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:36.200]   one Spirit."
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:37.440]   Hmm.
[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:45.120]   Now think about that and the implications that has, that faith is called a spiritual
[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:54.480]   gift and healing is called a spiritual gift, and Paul says explicitly that not all believers
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:57.000]   have these all the time.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:04.280]   Now doesn't that necessarily teach that some will be able to have faith to pray for
[00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:08.840]   healing at points where others will not?
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:12.000]   And yet it's not a sin not to have a spiritual gift.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:18.120]   The Bible teaches that it's not appointed for everybody to have these all the time.
[00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:23.960]   The fact that there are gifts of faith, gifts of healing, may go a long way, I think, to
[00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:29.960]   explaining what's going on in James 5, 15, where James speaks of the prayer of faith
[00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:32.600]   that will heal the sick man.
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:38.600]   Perhaps that's the gift of faith given in that moment to one or more of the elders who
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:40.440]   are praying.
[00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:46.120]   Now there are other pieces of the puzzle of prayer that need to fit into the picture,
[00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:55.560]   but these are enough, maybe, to give you something to work with over the next few years or decades.
[00:08:55.560 --> 00:09:06.120]   So my answer to Connor's specific question—here's what he asked—how to rightly pray in confidence
[00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:13.120]   with authority on someone's behalf for healing while remaining in full submission to the
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:14.600]   mystery of God's will.
[00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:16.160]   That's his question.
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:17.520]   So here's what I say.
[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:26.640]   We should rest our confidence and our authority on the promise of Jesus in Matthew 7, 11,
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:34.480]   the promise of Paul in Romans 8, 32, that because of the death of Jesus, every good
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:43.280]   thing that God's elect need has been purchased for them infallibly by Jesus, and that our
[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:52.880]   heavenly Father always gives from that storehouse of what is good for his children when we ask.
[00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:57.000]   He gives them good when we ask.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:03.480]   And yes, we should remain open and receptive and eager to receive a spiritual gift of faith
[00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:09.520]   at any given time that might fix our confidence on a specific outcome.
[00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:17.080]   Let's not assume that this is the way every prayer should be made.
[00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:18.520]   Really good question and response.
[00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:19.520]   Thank you, Pastor John.

[00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:52.280]   In fact, how much of our joy in Christ is really only achievable and possible in a state
[00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:55.560]   of robust obedience to Christ?
[00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:57.720]   I'm looking forward to that question, which is next.
