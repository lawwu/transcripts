[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.640]   If you're living paycheck to paycheck and you're now all of a sudden
[00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:04.840]   pursuing financial independence.
[00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.360]   Okay.
[00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.900]   Maybe it's not going to take you 10 years to get to five.
[00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.080]   Maybe it's going to take you 20 years.
[00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.200]   Maybe it's going to take you how, how many every year?
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.680]   So it almost doesn't even matter, but your life is vastly better.
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.920]   That first time you have $5,000 saved up even $1,000, right?
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.520]   Like, cause how many people live paycheck to paycheck and think that an emergency
[00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:32.440]   is a $200 expense that came out of the blue, but was perfectly foreseeable in
[00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:37.880]   a given year, but that to them is, is an emergency, but it's really not right.
[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.720]   Like, it's just life is lumpy.
[00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:40.820]   Expenses are lumpy.
[00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:41.720]   That's the way it works.
[00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.360]   But man, that first time they have a thousand bucks saved up, $5,000 saved
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.220]   up, like their life is dramatically better.
[00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.720]   That power starts accruing from day one.
[00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.640]   I think it's, it really radically transforms people and their entire mindset.
