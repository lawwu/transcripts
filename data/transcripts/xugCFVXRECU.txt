[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.320]   - Happy Friday, everyone.
[00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.520]   A podcast listener named Matt was one of several listeners
[00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.920]   who emailed us to ask us about a new Bible
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.680]   that's trending online.
[00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.800]   Matt asks, "Pastor John, what are your thoughts
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.460]   "about the new four-volume Bibliotheca Bible,
[00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.460]   "which costs $75?
[00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.900]   "Do we need aesthetically and artistically pleasing Bibles?
[00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.900]   "What are the benefits and what are the drawbacks?"
[00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.880]   - I think the most important thing for me to say
[00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.120]   is that I love the Bible.
[00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.640]   Under God, it is the most precious possession
[00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.520]   that we have in the world, yes,
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.640]   even more precious than other people.
[00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.640]   And therefore, I support its distribution everywhere
[00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.720]   and by every means that preserves its accurate meaning
[00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.760]   and does not sin in the construction
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.320]   or the distribution of it.
[00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.240]   That's my overarching passion.
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.040]   Yes, get the Bible into as many hands
[00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.660]   in this world as possible in a faithful translation
[00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.840]   in as many forms that will be helpful to people
[00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.320]   and not undermine the meaning or the truth of the Bible.
[00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.220]   Now, this project, Bibliotheca Bible,
[00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.160]   is a project to put the Bible into four volumes
[00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.920]   with no verse or chapter numbers on beautiful paper
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.280]   in beautiful bindings with the ASV,
[00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.440]   American Standard Version Translation,
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.860]   which was published in 1901 and is characterized,
[00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.860]   everybody knows, by a very formal literalism.
[00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.360]   I say literalism because it is pretty wooden.
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.960]   It is going to have the these and thous taken out
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.360]   with the corresponding verbs updated.
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.480]   The copyright has expired on that text,
[00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.160]   so it's in the public domain,
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.000]   which is what makes this project financially feasible,
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.160]   I presume.
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.480]   And the aims, as I understand them,
[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.200]   just watching the video that's been made available,
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.960]   is to make a version of the Bible,
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.480]   a form, a packaging of a Bible,
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.480]   which is, quote, "elegant, simple, and pure,"
[00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.280]   and to enable readers to read it, quote,
[00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.360]   "with a fresh set of eyes," and to, quote,
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.660]   "experience it anew."
[00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.440]   Now, I pray that that will happen.
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.680]   I think that's an laudable goal,
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.120]   to want a fresh set of eyes
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.280]   to be created by a fresh presentation.
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.880]   The reason I don't protest the expense of the Bible
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.760]   is because, as far as I can tell,
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.280]   there's no intent on the part of the publisher
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.160]   to make this normative,
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.400]   like, "This is the way all the Bibles should be,
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.880]   "$75 in beautiful bindings."
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.360]   I don't think that's the mindset at all.
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.200]   The publishers aren't saying, as far as I know,
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.080]   "All Bibles should be printed this way
[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.480]   "and be this expensive."
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.760]   And, of course, it's nothing new, right?
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.600]   I own a $200 Bible because it was given to me,
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.820]   because it's got a lambskin cover.
[00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.640]   I mean, there are Bibles of every price imaginable,
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.680]   ranging from 50 cents to hundreds and hundreds of dollars,
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.640]   based largely on the nature of the cover
[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.420]   and the binding and mass production and all that.
[00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.360]   So I'm happy to have the Bible available in another format,
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.340]   with enough formatting differences to draw people into it
[00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.440]   in a fresh encounter with the Word of God.
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.400]   Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God.
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.960]   You can't bind the Word of God.
[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.960]   It's running free and doing its work
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.400]   wherever you faithfully present it.
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.640]   But it might be helpful to hear just a few reasons
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.640]   why I think this Bible won't replace
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.800]   traditional Bible formats.
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.200]   I mean, for all the good things you can say
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.140]   about taking out verse divisions and chapter divisions,
[00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.360]   for freshness' sake, there are some really good reasons
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.520]   why this will not do away with,
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.440]   and should not do away with,
[00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.680]   our traditional Bibles printed with verse divisions
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:12.560]   and chapter divisions.
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.120]   So here are a couple of reasons.
[00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.280]   One, because we love to share our discoveries,
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.160]   and the greater the discoveries are,
[00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.440]   the more we want to share them,
[00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.520]   and verses make it possible for us to share something we saw
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.000]   because we can tell people it's that chapter so-and-so
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.080]   and verse so-and-so, and they can just find it and share it.
[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.120]   Number two, we love to study our Bibles
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.520]   and see what the Bible say about all kinds of topics
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.560]   and how one part of the Bible sheds light
[00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:40.860]   on another part of the Bible,
[00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.920]   which means that we need to find our way around
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.720]   in five or 10 or 20 places in the Bible
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:47.840]   that speak about something,
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.220]   and it's very hard to do that if you can't jump around
[00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.740]   with the help of verses and chapters.
[00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.360]   Number three, we love to memorize precious sentences
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.860]   in the Bible, but we know the danger
[00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.960]   of taking them out of context.
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.560]   With verse and chapter divisions,
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.980]   we can find our way right back to the context
[00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:10.160]   where we are learning and see what it says
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.220]   in the surrounding verses.
[00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.060]   Number four, we love to teach groups of people
[00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:18.940]   what the Bible says, and in a group,
[00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.060]   it's very helpful to direct all the eyes to the same place,
[00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:24.760]   and we can do that way more easily
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.240]   if we can say it verse so-and-so in chapter so-and-so.
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.600]   Fifth, we're not only citizens.
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.680]   This is a comment about the beauty of it.
[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:35.880]   I love beauty.
[00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:40.540]   However, we are not only citizens of this world
[00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:43.600]   who savor the beauty around us, right,
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.480]   including book bindings and layouts.
[00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.920]   I'm reading a book right now about George Herbert,
[00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.160]   and it's simply beautiful.
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.500]   The paper's beautiful, the cover's beautiful,
[00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:53.960]   the writing is beautiful.
[00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.440]   I love just holding the book,
[00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.580]   so I resonate with what's behind this.
[00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.560]   We are that kind of human being.
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:01.760]   We're not animals.
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:06.560]   We love beauty, and the Bible ought to be, at times,
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.920]   presented in that kind of way,
[00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:13.920]   but we are also pilgrims who are aliens here
[00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.960]   and who travel lightly on our way to heaven
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.120]   and are striving to get the Bible,
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:23.400]   its message and its truth into as many hands as we can,
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:28.400]   which means simplicity and economy become,
[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:33.320]   in some contexts at least, just as important as elegance.
[00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:36.160]   A Bible that costs $1, and there are Bibles
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:40.360]   that cost $1, can be put into the hands of many people
[00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:44.440]   more easily than a Bible that costs $75,
[00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:47.320]   and so that pilgrim principle, I think,
[00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:52.320]   drives us to economy as well as beauty in different settings.
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:54.440]   And one last thing.
[00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:57.480]   The ASV will never replace
[00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.760]   the more readable contemporary versions.
[00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:03.880]   It is literal, and I love that,
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:07.760]   but it is wooden also, and in some places,
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:12.220]   so structurally foreign to our way of writing
[00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:15.560]   that there are greater barriers
[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:20.560]   than these and thous that people are gonna run into.
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:26.360]   So last thing I'd say is God bless the project.
[00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:30.080]   God bless it, and may thousands of people
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:33.560]   not just encounter the text in a fresh way,
[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:36.960]   but may God himself make his way through
[00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:40.240]   this new version into people's lives.
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.640]   - Amen, thank you, Pastor John,
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:43.800]   and for more on this project,
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:46.800]   go to the website bibliotheca.co.
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.160]   And it's probably worth mentioning here
[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:49.960]   that Crossway has just recently released
[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:53.040]   the ESV Reader's Bible, which is a one-volume Bible
[00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:54.960]   with a lot of the same aesthetic values
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:56.680]   of the Bibliotheca Bible,
[00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:58.040]   but for only a fraction of the cost.
[00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:00.560]   I think you can get a copy for 20 bucks right now on Amazon.
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:03.840]   It's worth checking out the ESV Reader's Bible.
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:05.200]   Also, it's no fair for Pastor John
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:06.640]   to ever mention a book he's reading
[00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:08.400]   without giving us the title.
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:09.720]   The title of that George Herbert book
[00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:11.800]   is titled Music at Midnight,
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.740]   the Life and Poetry of George Herbert,
[00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:17.480]   authored by John Drury, D-R-U-R-Y.
[00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:19.320]   Well, speaking of reading beautiful books,
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:20.760]   the weekend is upon us.
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:23.080]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke, and we'll see you on Monday.
[00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:25.660]   (upbeat music)
[00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:28.240]   (upbeat music)
[00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:38.240]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
