[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.720]   Welcome back to a new week on the podcast.
[00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.320]   Well, last summer in episode 1500, some of you may remember that we talked about personal
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.320]   productivity.
[00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.640]   And there, Pastor John, you said it was essential that we learn the difference between sloth
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.640]   and rest.
[00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.720]   And you pointed us to the poem that you wrote titled, "Pilgrim's Conflict with Sloth."
[00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.720]   I commend that poem and your reading of it, all available right now at DesiringGod.org.
[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.240]   But in APJ 1500, you said that everyone knows that there is a place, an absolutely crucial
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:42.560]   place for rest and for leisure because the Sabbath principle still holds.
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.920]   But then you warned us that we must know the difference between sloth and rest.
[00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.680]   You didn't really explain that difference there.
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.840]   You pointed us to the poem.
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.960]   And I hate to say it, but I think a lot of listeners will resonate more with plainly
[00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.960]   stated principles than a poem.
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:05.000]   So can you, in principle, distinguish for us the indulgence of sinful sloth from the
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.440]   virtue of true rest?
[00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.200]   Yes, I think we can.
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.320]   And that's because the Bible does pretty clearly.
[00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.440]   So let me use biblical terms.
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:23.720]   Let's use the terms sluggard and diligent because those terms are used in the Proverbs.
[00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:32.960]   For example, Proverbs 13.4, "The soul of the sluggard craves and gets nothing while
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.740]   the soul of the diligent is richly supplied."
[00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:45.720]   So the question we're asking then is, what's the difference between the restfulness of
[00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.800]   the diligent and the laziness of the sluggard?
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:56.960]   Because at any given moment, restfulness and laziness might look the same if you're just
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.680]   looking at somebody sitting in a chair or lying in a bed or sleeping, but they're not
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.680]   the same.
[00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.600]   So what's the difference?
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.600]   One other clarification before I state the difference.
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.960]   I'm not interested here in unbelieving diligence.
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:18.960]   The kind of diligence I care about is the kind that sees the cross of Christ as the
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:28.360]   ground of all grace and the Holy Spirit as the key to all holiness and the glory of God
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:34.760]   as the goal of all reality, which would include the goal of all diligence.
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:41.840]   So I'm not just talking about any diligence, but the diligence rooted in the glory of God,
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.720]   the cross of Christ, and the power of the Holy Spirit.
[00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:56.400]   So let me state now my summary of the difference between laziness and the sluggard and restfulness
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.400]   and the diligent, and then we'll dig down into the roots.
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:09.840]   The laziness of the sluggard is owing to his overpowering aversion to work, and the restfulness
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:19.400]   of the diligent is received as a gracious reward for the gift of God-glorifying work
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:25.920]   and a pleasant preparation for renewed productivity.
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.760]   Or let me say it another way.
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:37.080]   The laziness of the sluggard is a capitulation to his disinclination to exertion, and the
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:47.920]   restfulness of the diligent is a sweet compensation for God-honoring exertion and thankful renewal
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.060]   for more usefulness.
[00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:51.880]   So those are my summary statements.
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:59.880]   Now let's go down now to the roots and take just a moment to focus on the problem of the
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:07.920]   sluggard and then spend most of our time on the biblical vision of work that makes the
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.040]   restfulness of the diligent so sweet.
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:18.040]   Paul says in 1 Corinthians 6, 12, "All things are lawful for me, but not all things are
[00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:23.240]   helpful, useful, beneficial, accomplish some good purpose."
[00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:31.880]   He continues, "All things are lawful for me, but I will not be mastered, dominated,
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.160]   controlled, ruled by anything."
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.880]   Now there's the test that the sluggard fails.
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:46.080]   You can devote your life to things that are helpful, useful, beneficial, accomplishing
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:55.480]   some good for the glory of God, or you can be mastered by bodily disinclinations to work.
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:59.680]   It's called laziness or sluggardness, if that's a word.
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:06.160]   Paul says, "I will not be mastered, enslaved, dominated, ruled by anything.
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.200]   I belong to Christ.
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.240]   He alone is my master.
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:17.680]   Therefore I will put to death the bodily impulses that tend to enslave me, and I will walk as
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:24.160]   a free man, devoting myself to things that are helpful, useful, beneficial."
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.040]   But the sluggard, not so.
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:34.080]   The sluggard is mastered by his bodily aversion to exertion.
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.960]   He's a slave.
[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:42.640]   Therefore his rest is not the sweet reward for doing good.
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:47.480]   It is the selfish resistance to doing good.
[00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:55.200]   Now let's turn for a moment to the amazing roots of the diligent and the restfulness
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.160]   that they enjoy.
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:05.720]   At root, the basic difference between the sluggard and the diligent is that the sluggard
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:15.560]   feels work as a misery to be avoided, and the diligent sees work as a God-given, life-giving
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.760]   privilege.
[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:25.720]   Now of course it's true that when sin entered the world through Adam and Eve, one of the
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:34.720]   effects of sin was to infect work with futility and burdensomeness.
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:38.960]   God said to Adam, "Cursed is the ground because of you.
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:42.640]   In pain you shall eat of it all the days of your life.
[00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:47.200]   By the sweat of your face you shall eat bread."
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:50.880]   That's not a very positive view of work.
[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:58.960]   There will always be some of that burdensome, some of that futility in all of our work.
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:05.000]   As long as this sinful age lasts, there'll be some of that no matter what your work is,
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:13.960]   which is why the final rest that God offers in his kingdom is desired and longed for even
[00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:18.000]   by those who find their work here rewarding.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:25.280]   But the grace of God has penetrated this fallen world order and enables the children of God
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:34.400]   to recover in part the rewarding significance of work which God intended from the beginning
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.520]   in creation.
[00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:41.560]   And that's what I think the diligent perceive, even if they don't articulate it, they sense
[00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:43.720]   it before the fall.
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:51.320]   God said to Adam and Eve, Genesis 128, "Be fruitful, multiply, fill the earth, and subdue
[00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:56.800]   it, and have dominion over every living creature that moves."
[00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:04.280]   That subduing and having dominion over creation would not happen while you're sitting in your
[00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:07.600]   long chair with your feet up.
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:14.880]   In fact, in Genesis 2.15, before the fall, it says, "The Lord God took the man and put
[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:19.960]   him in the Garden of Eden to work it and keep it."
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:27.800]   In other words, the original plan was not laziness or sloth or inactivity or lack of
[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.880]   productivity.
[00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:34.440]   Human beings are in the image of God.
[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:38.560]   We are makers like God.
[00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:45.840]   Whether we make a meal or make a bed or make a computer program or make a straight piece
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:54.000]   of wood or make a ditch or a wall of bricks or a school lesson or a sermon, we are makers
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.240]   by nature.
[00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:58.160]   The diligent have discovered this.
[00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:08.300]   And by grace, the fall does not prevent the recovery by grace in Christ in some significant
[00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:18.380]   measure of the God-glorifying meaningfulness of work so that rest can be experienced as
[00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:28.920]   a sweet reward for a day's work and a pleasant renewal for a new day of purposefulness.
[00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:37.960]   Ecclesiastes 5.12 says, "Sweet is the sleep of a laborer, whether he eats little or much,
[00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:44.120]   but the full stomach of the rich will not let him sleep."
[00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:51.860]   What makes the restfulness of the diligent sweet is the peaceful realization that the
[00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:58.740]   success of all their work depends finally on God and not themselves.
[00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:03.940]   Unless the Lord builds the house, those who build it labor in vain.
[00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:12.820]   It is in vain that you rise up early, go late to rest, eating the bread of anxious toil,
[00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:16.300]   for he gives to his beloved sleep.
[00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:17.900]   Psalm 127.
[00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:29.780]   It is the grace of God pushing back the effects of the fall that takes away anxiety and makes
[00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:37.420]   labor meaningful and sweet and gives true restfulness.
[00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:43.260]   The New Testament adds to the motivations of the diligent that when we work, we will
[00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:46.820]   have something not only for ourselves, but to give others.
[00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:51.620]   Ephesians 4.28, that we will not be a burden to others.
[00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:56.380]   Second Thessalonians 3.8, that we will be a good example to unbelievers.
[00:10:56.380 --> 00:11:02.500]   First Thessalonians 4.12, we will let our light shine so that people see our good deeds,
[00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:05.980]   our exertions for the glory of God.
[00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:12.640]   Matthew 5.16, the sluggard finds none of these motivations compelling.
[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:15.060]   So let me give my summary once more.
[00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:23.660]   The laziness of the sluggard is owing to his overpowering aversion to work, and the restfulness
[00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:32.420]   of the diligent is received as a gracious reward for the gift of God-glorifying work
[00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:37.740]   and a pleasant preparation for renewed productivity.
[00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:39.540]   Very good and helpful distinction, Pastor John.
[00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:42.540]   Thank you for that summary, and thank you for joining us today.
[00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:45.540]   You can ask a question of your own, you can search our growing archive, or subscribe to
[00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:46.740]   the podcast.

[00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:55.580]   We become like what we watch.
[00:11:55.580 --> 00:12:00.060]   The objects of our attention shape our becoming.
[00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:05.460]   Our potential as creatures is realized by what we behold.
[00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:12.060]   We're moldable creatures of clay conforming to whatever most attracts our gaze.
[00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:15.260]   What we behold shapes us for better or for worse.
[00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:20.220]   Obviously, this is a profound reality, and it carries with it massive implications for
[00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:25.940]   our media diets in the digital age, as we will hear next time from Pastor John himself.
[00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:30.300]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke, and we will see you back here on Wednesday.
[00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:30.620]   See you then.
