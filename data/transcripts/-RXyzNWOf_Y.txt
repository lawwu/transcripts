[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640]   - Do you think math is discovered or invented?
[00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.160]   So we're talking about the different kind of mathematics
[00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.160]   that could be developed by the alien species.
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.040]   The implied question is, yeah,
[00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.760]   is math discovered or invented?
[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.180]   Is fundamentally everybody going to discover
[00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.680]   the same principles of mathematics?
[00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:23.700]   - So the way I think about it,
[00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:24.920]   and everyone thinks about it differently,
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:25.960]   but here's my take.
[00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.460]   I think there's a cycle at play
[00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.520]   where you discover things about the universe
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.520]   that tell you what math will be useful.
[00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.600]   And that math itself is invented in a sense,
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.960]   but of all the possible maths that you could have invented,
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.280]   it's discoveries about the world
[00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.740]   that tell you which ones are.
[00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.280]   So like a good example here is the Pythagorean theorem.
[00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.280]   When you look at this, do you think of that as a definition
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.480]   or do you think of that as a discovery?
[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.840]   - From the historical perspective, right, it's a discovery
[00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:54.680]   because they were,
[00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.160]   but that's probably because they were using physical object
[00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.700]   to build their intuition.
[00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.040]   And from that intuition came the mathematics.
[00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.880]   So the mathematics was in some abstract world
[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.600]   detached from the physics.
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.800]   But I think more and more math has become detached from,
[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.160]   when you even look at modern physics,
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.080]   from string theory to even general relativity,
[00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.080]   I mean, all math behind the 20th and 21st century physics,
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.720]   kind of takes a brisk walk outside
[00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.000]   of what our mind can actually even comprehend.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.880]   In multiple dimensions, for example,
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.400]   anything beyond three dimensions, maybe four dimensions.
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.800]   - No, no, no, higher dimensions
[00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.260]   can be highly, highly applicable.
[00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.760]   I think this is a common misinterpretation
[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.840]   that if you're asking questions
[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.760]   about like a five-dimensional manifold,
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.220]   that the only way that that's connected
[00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.640]   to the physical world is if the physical world
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.480]   is itself a five-dimensional manifold or includes them.
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.760]   - Well, wait, wait, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.720]   You're telling me you can imagine
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.760]   a five-dimensional manifold?
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.880]   - No, no, that's not what I said.
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.520]   I would make the claim that it is useful
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.740]   to a three-dimensional physical universe,
[00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.940]   despite itself not being three-dimensional.
[00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.720]   - So it's useful, meaning to even understand
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.800]   a three-dimensional world, it'd be useful
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.440]   to have five-dimensional manifolds.
[00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.680]   - Yes, absolutely, because of state spaces.
[00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.300]   - But you're saying there, in some deep way,
[00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.960]   for us humans, it does always come back
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.560]   to that three-dimensional world,
[00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.120]   for the usefulness of the three-dimensional world,
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.480]   and therefore it starts with a discovery,
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.560]   but then we invent the mathematics
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.760]   that helps us make sense of the discovery, in a sense.
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.400]   - Yes, I mean, just to jump off
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.340]   of the Pythagorean theorem example,
[00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:40.720]   it feels like a discovery.
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.400]   You've got these beautiful geometric proofs
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.140]   where you've got squares and you're modifying the areas.
[00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.240]   It feels like a discovery.
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.120]   If you look at how we formalize the idea of 2D space
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.600]   as being R2, all pairs of real numbers,
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.240]   and how we define a metric on it and define distance,
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.520]   you're like, "Hang on a second, we've defined distance
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.520]   "so that the Pythagorean theorem is true,
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.960]   "so that suddenly it doesn't feel that great."
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.920]   But I think what's going on is the thing that informed us
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.120]   what metric to put on R2, to put on our abstract
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.800]   representation of 2D space, came from physical observations.
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.120]   And the thing is, there's other metrics
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.960]   you could have put on it.
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.640]   We could have consistent math with other notions of distance,
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.360]   it's just that those pieces of math wouldn't be applicable
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.140]   to the physical world that we study,
[00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:24.080]   'cause they're not the ones
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.680]   where the Pythagorean theorem holds.
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.540]   So we have a discovery, a genuine bonafide discovery
[00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.000]   that informed the invention,
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.200]   the invention of an abstract representation of 2D space
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.720]   that we call R2 and things like that.
[00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.220]   And then from there, you just study R2 as an abstract thing
[00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.000]   that brings about more ideas and inventions and mysteries,
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.920]   which themselves might yield discoveries.
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.480]   Those discoveries might give you insight
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.880]   as to what else would be useful to invent,
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.480]   and it kind of feeds on itself that way.
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:51.680]   That's how I think about it.
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.640]   So it's not an either/or.
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.280]   It's not that math is one of these or it's one of the others.
[00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.680]   At different times, it's playing a different role.
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.600]   - So then let me ask the Richard Feynman question,
[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.720]   then, along that thread.
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:06.880]   Is what do you think is the difference
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.820]   between physics and math?
[00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.320]   There's a giant overlap.
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.460]   There's a kind of intuition that physicists have
[00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:18.560]   about the world that's perhaps outside of mathematics.
[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.200]   It's this mysterious art that they seem to possess,
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.680]   we humans generally possess.
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.560]   And then there's the beautiful rigor of mathematics
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.340]   that allows you to, I mean, just like as we were saying,
[00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:37.360]   invent frameworks of understanding our physical world.
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.200]   So what do you think is the difference there,
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.380]   and how big is it?
[00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.000]   - Well, I think of math as being the study
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.880]   of abstractions over patterns and pure patterns in logic.
[00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.820]   And then physics is obviously grounded
[00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.200]   in a desire to understand the world that we live in.
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:53.560]   I think you're gonna get very different answers
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.100]   when you talk to different mathematicians,
[00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.640]   'cause there's a wide diversity in types of mathematicians.
[00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:01.000]   There are some who are motivated very much by pure puzzles.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.600]   They might be turned on by things like combinatorics.
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.220]   And they just love the idea of building up a set
[00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:10.420]   of problem-solving tools applying to pure patterns.
[00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:12.840]   There are some who are very physically motivated,
[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:17.840]   who try to invent new math or discover math in veins
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.520]   that they know will have applications to physics
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:21.840]   or sometimes computer science.
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.240]   And that's what drives them.
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.080]   Like chaos theory is a good example of something
[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.200]   that's pure math, that's purely mathematical,
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.720]   a lot of the statements being made.
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.400]   But it's heavily motivated by specific applications
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.880]   to largely physics.
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:36.220]   And then you have a type of mathematician
[00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.060]   who just loves abstraction.
[00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:39.440]   They just love pulling it to the more
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.680]   and more abstract things, the things that feel powerful.
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.760]   These are the ones that initially invented topology
[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:47.060]   and then later on get really into category theory
[00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:49.940]   and go on about infinite categories and whatnot.
[00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:53.000]   These are the ones that love to have a system
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.720]   that can describe truths about as many things as possible.
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:00.320]   People from those three different veins
[00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:01.680]   of motivation into math are gonna give you
[00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.240]   very different answers about what the relation
[00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.280]   at play here is.
[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:07.200]   'Cause someone like Vladimir Arnold,
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.100]   who has written a lot of great books,
[00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.040]   many about differential equations and such,
[00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:15.220]   he would say, "Math is a branch of physics."
[00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:16.720]   That's how he would think about it.
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.720]   And of course he was studying differential equations
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.600]   related things because that is the motivator
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.340]   behind the study of PDEs and things like that.
[00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:26.040]   But you'll have others who,
[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.800]   like especially the category theorists,
[00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.920]   who aren't really thinking about physics necessarily.
[00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:34.080]   It's all about abstraction and the power of generality.
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:35.980]   And it's more of a happy coincidence
[00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:37.880]   that that ends up being useful
[00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.420]   for understanding the world we live in.
[00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:42.380]   And then you can get into like, why is that the case?
[00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:45.740]   It's sort of surprising that that which is
[00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:47.380]   about pure puzzles and abstraction
[00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:50.580]   also happens to describe the very fundamentals
[00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:52.680]   of quarks and everything else.
[00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:57.380]   - So why do you think the fundamentals of quarks
[00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:02.780]   and the nature of reality is so compressible
[00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:04.860]   into clean, beautiful equations
[00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:08.820]   that are for the most part simple, relatively speaking?
[00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:11.220]   A lot simpler than they could be.
[00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:14.900]   So you have, we mentioned somebody like Stephen Wolfram
[00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:19.900]   who thinks that sort of there's incredibly simple rules
[00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:21.420]   underlying our reality,
[00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:24.460]   but it can create arbitrary complexity.
[00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:26.280]   But there is simple equations.
[00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:28.740]   What, I'm asking a million questions
[00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:30.180]   that nobody knows the answer to.
[00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:31.580]   - Yeah, I have no idea.
[00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:32.740]   (laughing)
[00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:33.840]   Why is it simple?
[00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:36.620]   - It could be the case that
[00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:38.020]   there's like a filtration at play.
[00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:40.140]   The only things that physicists find interesting
[00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:41.220]   are the ones that are simple enough
[00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:42.820]   they could describe it mathematically.
[00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:44.660]   But as soon as it's a sufficiently complex system,
[00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:46.460]   like, oh, that's outside the realm of physics.
[00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:48.860]   That's biology or whatever have you.
[00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:50.980]   And of course-- - That's true.
[00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:52.220]   - You know, maybe there's something where it's like,
[00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:56.060]   of course there will always be some thing that is simple
[00:07:56.060 --> 00:08:00.900]   when you wash away the like non-important parts
[00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:02.940]   of whatever it is that you're studying.
[00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:04.680]   Just from like an information theory standpoint,
[00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.180]   there might be some like,
[00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:08.960]   you get to the lowest information component of it.
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:10.420]   But I don't know, maybe I'm just having
[00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:12.500]   a really hard time conceiving of what it would even mean
[00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:16.860]   for the fundamental laws to be like intrinsically complicated
[00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:20.140]   like some set of equations
[00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:22.060]   that you can't decouple from each other.
[00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:26.300]   - Well, no, it could be that sort of we take for granted
[00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:29.500]   that the laws of physics, for example,
[00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:33.000]   are for the most part the same everywhere
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.860]   or something like that, right?
[00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:39.860]   As opposed to the sort of an alternative could be
[00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:44.940]   that the rules under which the world operates
[00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:46.780]   is different everywhere.
[00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:49.860]   It's like a deeply distributed system
[00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:51.900]   where just everything is just chaos.
[00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:55.060]   Like not in a strict definition of chaos,
[00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:59.940]   but meaning like just it's impossible for equations
[00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:03.560]   to capture, for to explicitly model the world
[00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:05.560]   as cleanly as the physical does.
[00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:08.640]   I mean, we almost take it for granted that we can describe,
[00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:10.800]   we can have an equation for gravity,
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.340]   for action at a distance.
[00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:15.040]   We can have equations for some of these basic ways
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:20.040]   the planets move and just the low level
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:23.560]   at the atomic scale, how the materials operate
[00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:26.520]   at the high scale, how black holes operate.
[00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:29.360]   But it doesn't, it seems like it could be,
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.240]   there's infinite other possibilities
[00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:34.600]   where none of it could be compressible into such equations.
[00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:36.080]   It just seems beautiful.
[00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:40.440]   It's also weird, probably to the point you were making,
[00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:44.680]   that it's very pleasant that this is true for our minds.
[00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:46.680]   So it might be that our minds are biased
[00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:49.180]   to just be looking at the parts of the universe
[00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:51.280]   that are compressible.
[00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:53.240]   And then we can publish papers on
[00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:56.000]   and have nice E equals mc squared equations.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:56.840]   - Right.
[00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:01.280]   - So I wonder, would such a world with uncompressible laws
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:04.720]   allow for the kind of beings that can think about
[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:07.360]   the kind of questions that you're asking?
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:08.180]   - That's true.
[00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:10.160]   - Right, like an anthropic principle coming into play
[00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:12.160]   in some weird way here?
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.360]   I don't know, I don't know what I'm talking about at all.
[00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:17.580]   - Or maybe the universe is actually not so compressible,
[00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:22.120]   but the way our brain evolved,
[00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:25.440]   we're only able to perceive the compressible parts.
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:27.960]   I mean, we are, so this is a sort of Chomsky argument.
[00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:29.440]   We are just descendants of apes.
[00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:33.160]   We're like really limited biological systems.
[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.960]   So it totally makes sense that we're really limited
[00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:38.160]   little computers, calculators,
[00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:39.840]   that are able to perceive certain kinds of things.
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:42.720]   And the actual world is much more complicated.
[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:46.240]   - Well, but we can do pretty awesome things, right?
[00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:47.880]   Like we can fly spaceships.
[00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:51.160]   And we have to have some connection of reality
[00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:54.880]   to be able to take our potentially oversimplified models
[00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:57.360]   of the world, but then actually twist the world
[00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:58.680]   to our will based on it.
[00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:00.000]   So we have certain reality checks
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   that physics isn't too far afield,
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.040]   simply based on what we can do.
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:06.880]   - Yeah, the fact that we can fly is pretty good.
[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:08.000]   - It's great, yeah.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.120]   It's a pretty good proof of concept
[00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:14.160]   that the laws we're working with are working well.
