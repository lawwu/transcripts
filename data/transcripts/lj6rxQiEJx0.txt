[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.040]   Well, on Monday, we talked about what makes a good sermon.
[00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:12.680]   And today we have a question about what place eloquence has in the pulpit, if any.
[00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.800]   And it's a question from a seasoned preacher who asked to remain nameless.
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.720]   Pastor John, thank you for this podcast.
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.580]   What is the role of creativity, imagination, and rhetoric in preaching?
[00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.760]   I'm thinking of things from alliteration and assonance to structural and
[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.740]   organizational devices to the use of metaphors, imagery, and illustrations.
[00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.380]   What would you say, Pastor John, to this preacher?
[00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:40.920]   This question has weighed on me for decades.
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:48.420]   So much so that maybe he knows, we did an entire Desiring God National
[00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:56.280]   Conference, I think in 2008, under the title, "The Power of Words and the Wonder
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.400]   of God," and the next year, Justin Taylor edited those messages into a book by the
[00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:10.840]   same title, and my talk in that conference was, "Is There Christian Eloquence?"
[00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:20.680]   And my burden was 1 Corinthians 1.17, which says, "Christ did not send me to
[00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:30.840]   baptize, but to preach the gospel, and not with words of eloquent wisdom, lest
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.800]   the cross of Christ be emptied of its power."
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.680]   And I think that is the key issue.
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:47.200]   How do we reconcile the pursuit of creative, imaginative, compelling uses
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.120]   of language in preaching and writing with the biblical warnings against
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:58.400]   replacing the power and offensiveness of the cross with human finesse or
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.960]   human art or human cleverness?
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.360]   Nobody can escape this problem.
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.760]   So nobody out there should say, "Oh, I don't even come close to that problem.
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:07.760]   I'm not eloquent at all."
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:08.400]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:12.880]   You do come close to this problem every time you open your mouth for Jesus.
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:13.600]   Yes, you do.
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.000]   Nobody escapes this because everybody in preaching or teaching or
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.880]   witnessing has to choose words.
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:27.840]   And when you choose words, they are more or less grammatically correct,
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:36.440]   more or less interesting, more or less striking, more or less traditional,
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:44.960]   more or less concrete or abstract, more or less evocative, more or fewer
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:52.280]   analogies and illustrations, which may be more or less captivating, and on and on.
[00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:59.160]   Nobody can evade the issue that when we choose our words, we are hoping that
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.200]   they have an effect for the glory of God and the salvation of sinners.
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:10.400]   And we make choices and we're never quite sure, was that the right choice?
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:18.600]   So this preacher is asking, is it fitting, helpful, legitimate, faithful to turn on
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:25.600]   like a faucet in your brain, to turn on the mental juices of creativity and
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.320]   imagination and make efforts at alliteration?
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.880]   He mentions like big bad bellicose bully.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.040]   That's alliteration and assonance like men sell the wedding bells.
[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.880]   You hear the sound that's assonance men sell the wedding bells.
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:49.160]   I got that off the internet as an illustration of assonance and metaphors.
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.400]   Jesus is the lion of Judah or similes.
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.200]   He will come like a thief or imagery.
[00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.320]   The sun crosses the sky like a bridegroom leaving his chamber.
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:06.200]   And illustrations like Jesus parables, the kingdom of God is like, and so on.
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.080]   It's not a simple question.
[00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.880]   And let me point our pastor friend to the fourth part of the
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.840]   new book, expository exaltation.
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:22.240]   I've got an entire part of this book devoted to the question of, is there such
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.840]   a thing as a legitimate Christian eloquence?
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.040]   My answer is yes.
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.880]   But chapters eight and nine really tried to tackle and show that the use of our
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:38.480]   natural powers, our natural brains, our natural creativity with verbal effort to
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:44.080]   say things effectively may cross the line of emptying the cross of its power.
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.120]   Or they may not cross the line.
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.080]   And here's what I've, I've concluded, and you'd have to go to the chapter
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:56.240]   to see the whole argument, but I've concluded the Bible itself is filled
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:02.600]   with every manner of literary device to add impact to the language.
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:09.680]   Acrostics, alliteration, analogies, anthropomorphisms, assonance, cadence,
[00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:17.160]   chiasm, consonants, dialogue, hyperbole, irony, metaphor, meter, onomatopoeia.
[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:17.880]   Look it up.
[00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:23.640]   Paradox, parallelism, repetition, rhyme, satire, simile.
[00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:24.440]   They're all there.
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:26.960]   And more, lots, lots more.
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:34.080]   The Bible is just explosive with varieties of effort to make the
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:41.520]   language different from ordinary hum, drum, traditional speech.
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:48.800]   And it seems to me that not only is there an example for us in the Bible for what
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:54.440]   to do with language when we're handling sacred things, but also that God Himself
[00:05:54.440 --> 00:06:03.760]   invites us to join Him in this creativity of compelling language with words like
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:11.840]   these, this is Proverbs 15, 23, "To make an apt answer is a joy to a man, and a
[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:16.520]   word in season, how good it is."
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:25.720]   Or Proverbs 25, 11, "A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in a setting of
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:26.520]   silver."
[00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:34.320]   Or Colossians 4, 6, "Let your speech always be gracious, seasoned with salt so
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:39.200]   that you may know how you ought to answer each person," and on and on.
[00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:47.600]   So my answer is yes, we should use our creative gifts to say things in
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:55.640]   interesting, non-boring, clear, truthful, biblically faithful, emotionally
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:07:02.040]   engaging, memorable, striking, compelling ways that are suitable to the subject
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.080]   matter.
[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:09.240]   So when I seek to guard against the misuse of creativity or the misuse of
[00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:15.880]   Christian eloquence, which I don't think is a bad thing, I think mainly of two
[00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:22.280]   criteria that would show something out of bounds or in bounds, protecting the
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:25.160]   cross with its power and its offensiveness.
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:33.480]   The first criteria is this, does my way of speaking or writing feed boasting?
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:42.520]   Does it come from an ego in search of exaltation through clever speech, and
[00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:43.600]   would it lead to that?
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:53.800]   Oh, how prone we are to want to get accolades for the way we put words
[00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:58.320]   together, and that's what Paul considers so deadly.
[00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:00.160]   Paul rejects it.
[00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:06.040]   Here's the second criterion, does my use of creative language in speaking and
[00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:12.840]   writing exalt Christ, especially the crucified Christ?
[00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:21.160]   The most helpful word I ever read on this outside the Bible is James Denny's
[00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:27.240]   dictum, which I think expresses these two criteria in a nutshell.
[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:35.480]   He says, "No man can give the impression that he himself is clever and that
[00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:37.200]   Christ is mighty to save."
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:44.040]   I read that early on in my ministry, and it has held me fast.
[00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:53.640]   So hold fast to that and be as creative and compelling as you can be for the glory
[00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:56.000]   of Christ and the good of souls.
[00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:57.480]   So good.
[00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:58.400]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:02.640]   And this week we are talking about preaching to celebrate Pastor John's new
[00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:07.560]   book, Expository Exaltation, which is the capstone of his 1000-page trilogy.
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:11.040]   Asking and answering three really critical questions.
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:13.200]   Question number one, can we trust the Bible?
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:17.160]   That was answered, of course, back in book number one, A Peculiar Glory.
[00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:20.920]   Question number two, how should I go about reading the Bible to get God's meaning?
[00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:24.200]   That was answered in book number two, Reading the Bible Supernaturally.
[00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:28.040]   And now finally, question three, what should I expect from my church and my
[00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:30.400]   pastors when they proclaim this book to me?
[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:35.360]   That is now answered in book three, now out, titled Expository Exaltation,
[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:38.120]   Christian Preaching as Worship.
[00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:42.800]   Well, our week of episodes on preaching ends on Friday next time, and I'll ask
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:46.880]   Pastor John, how do we know if our sermons are too short or too long?
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:49.600]   That should generate an interesting answer.
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:51.560]   That's on Friday when we return.
[00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:52.360]   I'm your host, Tony Ranke.
[00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:54.920]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast with longtime
[00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:56.480]   author and preacher, John Piper.
[00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:57.040]   We'll see you then.
