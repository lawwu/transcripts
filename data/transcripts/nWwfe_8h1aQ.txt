[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800]   This is one of my favorite models for relationships.
[00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.440]   When someone comes to you with a problem, you ask,
[00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.960]   "Do you want to be helped, heard, or hugged?"
[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.680]   And it immediately cuts through the noise on that exact problem that you're identifying.
[00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.000]   My natural bias is as a fixer.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.080]   Like, when my wife would come to me with a problem early in our relationship,
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.760]   I would be, like, trying to think,
[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.080]   "Okay, well, you could have done this differently. You could have done that."
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.600]   And she would go nuts.
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.000]   And it took me years to realize all she wanted was to be listened to.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.360]   She wanted to be heard.
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.800]   And then maybe she wanted to be hugged because her love language is touch.
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.120]   So, all I really needed to do in those moments was listen to her, hear her,
[00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.400]   and then give her a hug.
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.680]   But here I was spending all my time spinning my wheels trying to fix whatever the problem was.
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.960]   And so, it actually is, like, a really healthy way to identify
[00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.920]   what the other person needs from you in that moment.
[00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.280]   It's really, really helpful.
[00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.640]   Helped, heard, or hugged.
