[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.820]   Why should we invest the time and energy it takes to pray?
[00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.180]   This was a question taken up by John Piper in his sermon, "Pray Like This, Hallowed Be
[00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.100]   Your Name," which he preached on December 30th, 2007.
[00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.060]   Here's what Pastor John said.
[00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:26.580]   Number one, because we're told to so many times, over and over and over again.
[00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:27.580]   Here's a few.
[00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.540]   James 5.16, this is God telling us to pray.
[00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.780]   Pray for one another that you may be healed.
[00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:38.020]   How many sicknesses are there in the church because they don't pray for each other, that
[00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.820]   God would be willing to heal?
[00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.180]   First Thessalonians 5.17, pray without ceasing.
[00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.980]   Luke 22.40, pray that you may not enter into temptation, that you may not enter into temptation.
[00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.380]   Luke 18.1, he told them a parable to the effect that they ought always to pray and not lose
[00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:58.380]   heart.
[00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:03.620]   Luke 6.28, bless those who curse you, pray for those who abuse you.
[00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.540]   You're in a rotten situation, getting ripped off, being lied about, pray, pray, pray for
[00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:09.900]   them.
[00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.100]   Matthew 6.9, pray like this, our Father in heaven.
[00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.100]   That's number one.
[00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:21.060]   We pray because dozens of times in the Bible we're told to pray and God loves us.
[00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.420]   He wouldn't tell us to do something that's bad for us.
[00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.500]   It's good for us.
[00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:34.060]   Number two, we pray because it is a means to the increase of our joy.
[00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:40.020]   Now, you might think, well, that's what we expect you to say, but you expect me to say
[00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.500]   it because I'm a Christian hedonist.
[00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.140]   But the case is, I'm a Christian hedonist because of texts like this that blew me away
[00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.460]   35 years ago.
[00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:57.820]   John 16.24, "Until now," Jesus said, "you have asked nothing in my name.
[00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.420]   Ask and you will receive that your joy may be full."
[00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:13.900]   Ask, ask, because in coming to me as a needy person and depending upon me for everything
[00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:22.900]   you need, your joy will be fuller than if you try to get that need met another way.
[00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:33.420]   He wants you happy in him and he says, "Ask and your joy will be full."
[00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:44.620]   Number three, because it is simply a staggeringly awesome privilege.
[00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.420]   It is simply a staggeringly awesome privilege.
[00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.620]   Now you've got to think of this.
[00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:56.300]   We just must be blown away by this.
[00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:02.140]   God runs the world with infinite wisdom.
[00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:09.300]   You and I never inform him of anything he doesn't already know.
[00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:14.420]   We never add to his wisdom, ever.
[00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:22.180]   When we pray, we do not improve upon his knowledge about what he should do next.
[00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.600]   This is really basic.
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.300]   This is who God is.
[00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:31.300]   Romans 11, 34, "Who has known the mind of the Lord?
[00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.360]   Or who has been his counselor?
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.180]   Or who has ever given a gift to him that he should be repaid?
[00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.120]   For from him and through him and to him are all things.
[00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.540]   To him be glory forever."
[00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.140]   Nobody ever counseled him.
[00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.700]   Nobody ever gave anything to him that he didn't already own.
[00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:54.420]   We are never obliging God to act out of his need for us.
[00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:55.420]   He doesn't need us.
[00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:56.420]   He doesn't need your prayer.
[00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.620]   He doesn't need anything about you.
[00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:59.620]   He's God.
[00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.540]   That's the meaning of God.
[00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.760]   No needs.
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.300]   We have needs.
[00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:06.900]   He's the need meter.
[00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.980]   And how the need meter gets glory is by hearing the prayers of the needy.
[00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:17.900]   And it's simply staggering that God would ordain, now get this, that God, the sovereign
[00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:26.100]   ruler of the universe, would ordain that prayers cause things.
[00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:32.340]   Prayers cause things to happen that would not happen if you didn't pray.
[00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:39.340]   I wonder if any Calvinists out there squirming.
[00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:51.500]   Listen to this, when James 4.2 says, "You do not have because you do not ask."
[00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:59.940]   That does not mean you would have anyway even if you didn't ask because I've got a plan.
[00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:04.500]   The verse doesn't mean the opposite of what it says.
[00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:10.300]   It says you have not because you ask not.
[00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:20.580]   That means prayer causes things to happen that wouldn't happen if you didn't pray.
[00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:30.380]   This is why this is a staggeringly glorious privilege to be taken by the sovereign God
[00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:35.820]   of the universe who runs all things according to his infinite wisdom and fold it in to his
[00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:39.300]   causality.
[00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.680]   This is breathtaking.
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:53.840]   If you do not avail yourself of the privilege of bringing to pass events in the universe
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:06:02.140]   that would not take place if you didn't pray, you are acting like a colossal fool, aren't
[00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:03.140]   you?
[00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:05.840]   I'm just thinking logically here.
[00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:14.040]   If you are offered the privilege of engaging with God in such a way that your request could
[00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:22.780]   bring into being things that would not otherwise come into being, not to avail yourself of
[00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:31.120]   that privilege is folly of the highest or lowest order.
[00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.000]   That's why we pray.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.400]   God is beckoning us into our share in the running of the universe.
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:39.400]   Wow.
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:40.400]   Amen.
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.760]   That was from John Piper's sermon, "Pray Like This, Hallowed Be Your Name," which was preached
[00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:45.840]   on December 30, 2007.
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:51.360]   We have over 1,200 sermons like this one from John Piper in our archive at DesiringGod.org.
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:54.480]   And on Wednesdays, we like to dip into that archive to pull out a classic quote for the
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:55.480]   podcast.
[00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:57.280]   And I welcome your suggestions.
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:01.080]   If you have a favorite John Piper sermon clip, please email us the name of the sermon and

[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:15.120]   Well how can we prepare for the rapture?
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:19.080]   Many of you have asked and Pastor John responds tomorrow on the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:19.520]   We'll see you then.
[00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:28.000]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
