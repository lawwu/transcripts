[00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:05.260]   One thing we didn't talk about is greeters. Okay. And there is a hack. Again, there's a cost to it.
[00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:11.420]   In most airports, there's the accessibility of getting around some lines by using a paid airport
[00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.120]   employee, a greeter, to get you through security, sometimes immigration, much faster. These folks
[00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:22.340]   cost between $150 and $500 per use, and it does scale up based on how many people are using it at
[00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.900]   the same time. So if you're a family of five, it might be $150 for the first passenger, then $50 for
[00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:32.180]   each passenger they're after. So it's not cheap. But in some places where it's confusing to get to the
[00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.320]   airport, or you've got a tight connection, if you're coming inbound from one airline and going
[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.260]   out on another, or if you're in a foreign country and you don't speak the language, getting a greeter
[00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.960]   might be a really valuable experience. We've used greeters at five-year-old airports across the
[00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.320]   world, right? Getting a greeter in a porter is a great way of getting through domestic airports,
[00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.540]   internationally especially, cutting lines, getting through security faster, getting through immigration
[00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.320]   faster, getting into a different lounge you might not have access to with your ticket, a great leveling
[00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.300]   up by using a greeter.
