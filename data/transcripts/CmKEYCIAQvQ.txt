[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.680]   Good Monday morning everyone. We start this new week talking about gambling, and not for
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.080]   the first time. Of course, Pastor John, we have a handful of helpful episodes on this
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:20.720]   theme already in the podcast archive. Elsewhere, you've talked about how lotteries prey on
[00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:26.840]   the poor. It's a point you made in a 2016 article, which was titled "Seven Reasons
[00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.680]   Not to Play the Lottery." Reason number five was that it preys on the poor. You made
[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:38.000]   the point, but only briefly there. I'd like for you to dwell on this point here in the
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.520]   podcast. How does the lottery prey on the poor, and why should we care that it does?
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.740]   Let me begin with a few observations taken from various studies. First, just a quotation
[00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:55.280]   from that article that you mentioned that I wrote on this some time ago. I said that
[00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:02.720]   the lottery supports and encourages a corrosive addiction that preys upon the greed and hopeless
[00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:10.680]   dreams of those entrapped in poverty. I gave this example. Those earning $13,000 or less
[00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:17.960]   spend an astounding 9% of their income on lottery tickets. That was a statistic from
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:25.480]   maybe six years ago or so. Here's a few more recent things. People who make less than
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:34.520]   $10,000 a year spend on average $597 on lottery tickets. That's 6% of their income.
[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:40.400]   Another observation. The odds of winning a state Powerball lottery are considerably less
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:47.060]   than being struck by lightning. For example, the odds of winning the January 21 Powerball
[00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:55.120]   drawing in Tennessee was one in 292.2 million, while the odds of a lightning strike death
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:05.880]   hover in the one in 2.3 million area. It's a pretty weak possibility, to say the least.
[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.460]   Let's clarify what we're talking about. We're not just talking about Powerball with its
[00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:17.800]   million-dollar payout. There are many different kinds of public gambling, lotteries, some
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:26.280]   far more destructive for the poor than others. Lotto America, Mega Millions, Lucky for Life,
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:33.120]   InstaPlay, Pull Tab, Scratch Games, all of these created by governments to help pay the
[00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:41.520]   bills. So when we think of how the poor spend money on public lotteries, we must not just
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:49.160]   think about Powerball. In fact, even poor people recognize that the chances of winning
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:55.560]   millions are so remote, that's really not the main draw. That's not where poor people
[00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:02.200]   are spending their money. The main draw is Pull Tabs and Scratch Games. You buy a ticket,
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.360]   so you can go online and just type in Scratch Games, Minnesota, and find what the offerings
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:13.120]   are. In Minnesota, the one-dollar ticket that you can buy online or you can buy at a guest
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.600]   station is called "Rake It In." That's the name of the ticket for one dollar. You scratch
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:24.160]   it off and you'll know immediately if you've won. The payouts are like one dollar. You
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:30.360]   get one dollar, or ten, or fifty, or right up to five thousand. So in Minnesota, the
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.280]   extent for the scratch-offs are from one dollar all the way up to five thousand dollars. These
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:42.240]   kinds of games are less attractive to middle-class people and upper-class people because adding
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.680]   ten dollars or a hundred dollars even to your bank account really doesn't make that much
[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:52.640]   difference to a middle-class person. But to a poor person, ten, a hundred dollars, or
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:04:00.400]   five hundred dollars, that's like a windfall, and therefore the more frequent payout and
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:07.640]   the greater the likelihood of winning draws in disproportionately more poor people for
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:16.800]   these kinds of games than for, say, the big Powerball payout. The poorest one-third of
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:26.360]   American households purchase one-half of the lottery tickets. The lowest one-fifth of earners
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:33.520]   in America have the highest percentage of lottery players. One study showed that the
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:43.960]   introduction of scratch-offs grew three times faster in poor areas than in others. But study
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:53.800]   after study has shown that across the board, players lose on average forty-seven cents
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:05:02.440]   for every dollar. Or to say it another way, what you purchase on average when you spend
[00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:09.240]   a dollar on the lottery, what you purchase is fifty-three cents. And of course, that
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:17.280]   statistic is highly misleading because to arrive at that average of millions of people
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:24.080]   investing, you overlook the fact that millions of those people got exactly nothing. And to
[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:29.800]   bring the average up to getting back fifty-three cents on your dollar, you have to reckon that
[00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:36.560]   some people have won a million dollars, a very, very few people. So it's a truism to
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:45.800]   say the lottery did not become a million-dollar industry due to its large output of winners.
[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:55.480]   Not the way it works. It's true that states have created lotteries to help pay for social
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:06:02.840]   services that aim at benefiting everyone. But there are ironies. Most states allocate
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:11.080]   some of the lottery income to providing services for gambling addiction, and some try to provide
[00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:20.400]   a good kind of education, which creates, supposedly, habits of mind and heart, which are the opposite
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:28.720]   of the habits they exploit by the lottery itself. Very ironic. Addictive behaviors are
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:36.960]   more common among the poor, and living by immediate rather than deferred gratification
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:46.040]   is more common among the poor. Publicly funded gambling feeds these kinds of habits, which
[00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:54.320]   are destructive to people's lives. Now, for all these reasons, the lottery has regularly
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:07:00.840]   been called a regressive tax on the poor. Here's what that means. It's a way of
[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:10.040]   luring the poor, who pay almost no taxes for social services, to pay a kind of tax in a
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:15.040]   way that worsens their situation rather than making it better, which is what taxes are
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:19.440]   supposed to do. They're supposed to make life better for us, and this is a regressive
[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:25.520]   tax in the sense that it makes life worse for the poor rather than better.
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:34.920]   Now, it would be easy to sarcastically say, "Well, no, actually, it's not a tax on
[00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:40.360]   the poor. It's a tax on the stupid." And I know there are a lot of people who think
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:48.920]   that way about the poor, as if the only factor in making a person poor is all their bad habits
[00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:57.200]   or, they might say, stupid habits. And of course, it's true. Personal responsibility
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:02.720]   and the failure to act with righteousness and integrity and dependence on God through
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:09.560]   grace and through patience and through trust in Jesus Christ is a huge factor in why many
[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:19.040]   people are poor. But there are many other factors as to why, say, a widow might be stuck
[00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:24.480]   economically earning $20,000 a year, working full-time and spending half her income on
[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:29.920]   her apartment and unable to afford a car and facing physical and mental challenges few
[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:38.600]   people know about that make advancement for her of any kind unlikely. There are more factors.
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:48.480]   The number one reason why people in such seemingly hopeless situations purchase scratch-offs
[00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:56.840]   is because things already look so hopeless for improvement that the so-called stupidity
[00:08:56.840 --> 00:09:03.240]   of wasting this dollar won't really make any things worse, so why not try? That's,
[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:12.720]   I think, basically the mindset that drives most of the purchases, a sense of hopelessness.
[00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:18.560]   It's not going to make things worse because there's no hope that they could get better.
[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:23.800]   And when you already feel hopeless, then arguments against gambling lose most of their force.
[00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:32.640]   Now, from a biblical and Christian point of view, then, I don't think we are the least
[00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:40.320]   bit encouraged by God's Word to stand aloof, roll our eyes at the stupidity of millions
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:45.080]   of dollars that roll into the state coffers from people who can barely pay their bills.
[00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:51.360]   I don't think that is basically a Christian standpoint. When I read my Bible, I see a
[00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:57.800]   different disposition, a different heart, a different mind. For example, "Blessed
[00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:04.520]   is the one who considers the poor. In the day of trouble the Lord delivers him" (Psalm
[00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:12.200]   41). "Whoever mocks the poor, insults his Maker. He who is glad at calamity will not
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:19.240]   go unpunished" (Proverbs 17). "Whoever oppresses a poor man, insults his Maker,
[00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:25.280]   but he who is generous to the needy honors him" (Proverbs 14). "Open your mouth,
[00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:31.000]   judge righteously, defend the rights of the poor and the needy" (Proverbs 31). "God
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:36.400]   raises the poor from the dust and lifts the needy from the ash heap" (Psalm 113).
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:47.880]   So I think the upshot of all this for Christians is that we should disapprove of and resist
[00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:53.800]   an institution—every form of gambling, I would say. I've written about that elsewhere.
[00:10:53.800 --> 00:11:01.760]   We've talked about that APJ on several occasions. Just gambling itself is a major biblical problem.
[00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:08.040]   So I think we should resist all forms of gambling, all forms of lottery, which fly in the face
[00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:15.280]   of how God intends for His creatures to use the resources He has entrusted to us. You
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:23.200]   don't gamble with somebody else's money. It's all God's. And we wittingly or unwittingly
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:29.720]   prey upon the vulnerabilities of the poor, and we should resist that kind of institution.
[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:37.760]   And instead, we should give our thinking and praying and advocating and investing and planning
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:45.040]   toward, one, the removal of unnecessary barriers to productive work and gainful employment
[00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:51.520]   among the poor; two, the removal of incentives and allurements toward waste and squandering
[00:11:51.520 --> 00:12:01.440]   and irresponsibility; and three, instead seek to put in place encouragements toward deferred
[00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:10.160]   gratification; and finally, the creation of responsibility and hope, especially through
[00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:12.800]   the gospel in people's lives.
[00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:17.760]   Yeah, you don't gamble with somebody else's money. That's a great point. Thank you, Pastor
[00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:22.080]   John, and thank you for joining us today. You can ask a question of your own, search

[00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:36.240]   We've all been there. Maybe you're there right now. You see problems in every direction in
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:41.680]   your life. All you see are difficulties. You see your sins, your shortcomings, your challenges,
[00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:46.360]   the places in your life that have been neglected. And you are now tempted to live a life that
[00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:51.520]   has shrunk down to the size of all the problems that you see in your life. Well, Pastor John
[00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:56.080]   has been there. And if this is where you're at, you need to hear what he learned from
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:59.560]   a season in his life. I'm your host, Tony Reinke. We'll see you back here on Wednesday
[00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:01.040]   for that. We'll see you shortly.
