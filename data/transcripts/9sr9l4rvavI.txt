[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.800]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:14.440]   the Epistle to the Hebrews, in chapter 13, reading verses 11 and 12.
[00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:23.000]   Verses 11 and 12 in the 13th chapter of the Epistle to the Hebrews.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.200]   "For the bodies of those beasts whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.920]   priest for sin are burned without the camp.
[00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:45.320]   Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without
[00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.320]   the gate."
[00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.400]   I want to deal in particular with that twelfth verse.
[00:00:50.400 --> 00:01:00.480]   "Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without
[00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.480]   the gate."
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:10.560]   Now, we are met together on this good Friday morning in order that we may consider together
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.200]   what happened on the cross on Calvary's hill.
[00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.400]   This is, of course, the great and the central theme of all Christian preaching.
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:32.200]   But we meet particularly this morning in order to remind ourselves of the fact, the actual
[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.800]   literal event that took place.
[00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:42.800]   Now it is important that we should always start with that and emphasize that fact.
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:51.720]   What differentiates this Christian faith of ours from all so-called religions and teachings
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:02:01.440]   is that this is based solidly and essentially upon historical facts and events.
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.440]   This isn't a philosophy.
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.480]   This isn't merely a teaching.
[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:15.520]   We preach the wonderful works of God, and at the center of them all, what happened on
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.600]   the cross on Calvary's hill.
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:25.200]   Therefore I say that it is good and right that from time to time we should give the
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:32.800]   whole of our attention primarily to the fact itself, rather than to the teaching and the
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:38.200]   doctrine that we derive from the fact.
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:46.000]   Now the importance of this, I'm sure, is something which we all realize.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.760]   This whole chapter, this whole epistle to the Hebrews, out of which we take our text
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:58.480]   this morning, rarely had to be written because these Hebrew Christian people were becoming
[00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:05.440]   a little bit uncertain in their minds and understanding as to the fact of the cross
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.440]   and the meaning of the cross.
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:15.960]   That really is the whole purpose of the entire epistle, to bring them back to a realization
[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:23.160]   of what it was that happened there and its eternal meaning and significance.
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.880]   And of course the subsequent history of the Christian church has so often or less demonstrated
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.920]   the same thing.
[00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:37.640]   When people become unclear or uncertain in their minds and hearts as to the meaning of
[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:43.720]   the death on the cross on Calvary's hill, they very soon begin to make shipwreck of
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:44.720]   their faith.
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:53.240]   Therefore I say it behoves us to come back once more and to look again at this fact with
[00:03:53.240 --> 00:04:01.320]   which in a sense we are so familiar, but from which unless we are very careful we may be
[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.920]   led away.
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:08.520]   You remember the Apostle Paul in writing his first epistle to the Corinthians warns them
[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:15.160]   against the terrible danger of making the cross of Christ of none effect through their
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:21.280]   philosophy and the danger still remains with us.
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:27.080]   Now it is in order that we may do this together that I am calling your attention to this extraordinary
[00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:33.400]   verse here in the thirteenth chapter of this epistle to the Hebrews.
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:40.400]   And all we really need to do is to look at the actual statements made by the author.
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.960]   He puts it very plainly and very clearly for them.
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.880]   He has been arguing it at great length in the various chapters of his great epistle,
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:55.240]   but here he seems to sum it all up and he does it in a most interesting manner.
[00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.280]   Now all I propose to do is to hold these words before you.
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:05.440]   And the first word that must engage your attention therefore is the word wherefore.
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.360]   Wherefore Jesus also.
[00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:15.160]   Now this is the key to the entire statement and argument of this writer at this particular
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.160]   point.
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:22.320]   He puts it in this way of course because as I say he is having to deal with the Hebrew
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.320]   Christians.
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:30.200]   Here were people who had come out of Judaism and had disposed of the Christian faith and
[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.680]   had become members of the Christian church.
[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:40.320]   But for various reasons, persecution, trials, disappointments in various ways, they were
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:46.680]   beginning to be uncertain of their faith and to look back to their old religion.
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.120]   And he warns them against it.
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:55.560]   So that what he does is he compares and contrasts this new faith with the old religion, the
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:56.560]   old teaching.
[00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.900]   And that's of course the very thing that he's doing here.
[00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:05.880]   He says we have an altar whereof they have no right to eat, which serves the tabernacle.
[00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:12.580]   These people were wanting to go back to those old offerings, meal offerings and various
[00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:13.580]   other offerings.
[00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:17.800]   He says don't be carried about with these diverse and strange doctrines.
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:22.240]   For it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace.
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.680]   That's the New Testament.
[00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.840]   That's the Christian message.
[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.280]   Grace.
[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:33.960]   Not with meats which have not profited them that have been occupied therein.
[00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:39.480]   And then he goes on to say, but you remember he says surely that the bodies of those beasts
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:45.800]   whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin are burned without
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.400]   the camp.
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:55.000]   And then he takes hold of that to illustrate to them and to show to them plainly and clearly
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:01.120]   the meaning of the death and the cross of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:06.400]   Well now then, what does this word wherefore tell us?
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:12.120]   Well he tells us this, not merely that our Lord died upon the cross in order to fulfill
[00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:13.120]   prophecy.
[00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:18.920]   He does tell us that, but he doesn't only tell us that.
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:24.120]   There are people who seem to think that when you get these quotations from the Old Testament
[00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:30.040]   in the New Testament, showing how our Lord by doing or saying something was fulfilling
[00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:37.600]   prophecy, they seem to think that our Lord's only object therefore was to fulfill prophecy.
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.720]   But that of course is quite wrong.
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:46.960]   The cross does fulfill prophecy, but it doesn't merely do that.
[00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:52.200]   Nevertheless, we must remember that it does do that.
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:58.160]   What was happening on the cross was the fulfillment of all the types and all the shadows that
[00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:04.640]   we find in the Old Testament, in books like Leviticus and Numbers and so on, and indeed
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:07.920]   all the prophecies which point forward to him.
[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:10.080]   He fulfills them all.
[00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:16.320]   All the promises of God in him are yea, and in him are men.
[00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:22.440]   Yes he fulfills all the prophecies, wherefore Jesus also.
[00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:26.920]   But he not only fulfills them all, he ends them all.
[00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:30.920]   And that's the thing that this man was impressing upon these Hebrew Christians.
[00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:33.800]   Don't go back to them, he says they're finished.
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:36.600]   He's the end of all these things.
[00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:41.520]   They were pointing to him, he is the Lamb of God, all the other lambs point forward
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:42.520]   to him.
[00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:47.960]   So he not only fulfills it all, he ends it all.
[00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:54.080]   In other words, he introduces a new era.
[00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:59.840]   He brings in a new testament, a new covenant.
[00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:06.520]   So that this word wherefore reminds us of this great watershed, this dividing line between
[00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:13.120]   the Old Testament, the New Testament, the Old Covenant, the New Covenant.
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:22.960]   He has ended everything that has gone before, and he ushers in a new covenant, the covenant
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:26.040]   of grace.
[00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:32.160]   But not only does this word wherefore tell us that, it tells us something else.
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:37.640]   We must always remember that these types in the Old Testament, all the burnt offerings
[00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:49.360]   and the sacrifices and so on, were prophetic of and foreshadowed what he would do.
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:54.000]   They had no actual meaning in and of themselves.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.160]   They were all given by God to the nation of Israel in order to prepare them for that which
[00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:00.160]   was to come.
[00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:06.200]   Therefore, they had no inherent or intrinsic merit or value.
[00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:07.840]   They were nothing but shadows.
[00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:10.480]   They were nothing but types.
[00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:13.160]   Again these Hebrew Christians needed to be taught that.
[00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:14.600]   They wanted to go back to them.
[00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:19.760]   So he says, "Why go back to the types when the anti-type has come?"
[00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:26.140]   We mustn't therefore attach any value to them in and of themselves.
[00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:32.280]   Or that we must never say, as I was saying, that our Lord died upon the cross merely in
[00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:37.840]   order to fulfill the types, as if the type was the important thing which he had to fulfill.
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:39.180]   No, no.
[00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:41.360]   You must put it the other way around.
[00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:49.180]   The types are of value only in that they point forward to him.
[00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:57.920]   But to me the most important point which this word, wherefore, teaches us is this, that
[00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:09.060]   we realize from these types in the Old Testament, the offerings of various kinds, that what
[00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:17.040]   happened on the cross on Calvary was something that was always in the mind of God.
[00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:21.040]   Now what I mean is this.
[00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:28.620]   There are so many today who regard the death on Calvary's hill as an accident or as a
[00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:31.540]   great tragedy.
[00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:37.720]   They regard it as something which was done to the Son of God by cruel, ignorant, foolish
[00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:40.480]   men who didn't grasp his teaching.
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:42.920]   Oh, they say, "What a tragedy."
[00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:46.040]   If only they'd listened to him, if only they'd followed him.
[00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:48.600]   It was something that happened accidentally.
[00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:51.040]   It was something that took him by surprise.
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:54.380]   It's the supreme tragedy of history.
[00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:58.900]   But you see, this one verse that we're looking at, and this word, wherefore, alone, gives
[00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:03.780]   a complete answer to such teaching and to such ideas.
[00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:10.720]   It tells us this, that all that we have in the Old Testament was prophetic of what happened
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:13.000]   upon the cross.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.400]   It was God who ordained the burnt offerings and the sacrifices.
[00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:22.240]   It was God who taught the people that the body of these beasts, whose blood was brought
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:28.240]   into the sanctuary for sin, should be burned without the camp, without the gate.
[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:37.960]   Therefore, I argue this, that the types and the shadows of the Old Testament are a complete
[00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:45.680]   and entire proof, without going any further, that the cross on Calvary's Hill was in
[00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:52.280]   the mind and the purpose of God from the foundation of the world.
[00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:55.360]   Now this is a very important argument.
[00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:59.140]   You see, it shows the value of the Old Testament.
[00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:03.880]   We must get rid of this notion that the death of our Lord was something unforeseen and a
[00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:06.280]   tragedy produced by men.
[00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:13.920]   No, this is something that God had ordained and predetermined before the foundation of
[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:15.400]   the world itself.
[00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:21.480]   And we have proof of that in that he gave these prophetic adumbrations of it, these
[00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:29.680]   four views of it, to the children of Israel, a way back into the dispensation of Moses.
[00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:34.120]   Now this is a very important and a very significant point.
[00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:39.200]   Whatever else we may see as we look at the cross on Calvary's Hill this morning, we
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:42.320]   must always put this in the first place.
[00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:50.600]   This is something that God himself had planned and ordained before the foundation of the
[00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:51.600]   world itself.
[00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:57.880]   Our names, we are told in many places in the New Testament, are written in the Lamb's
[00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:01.680]   Book of Life, slain before the foundation of the world.
[00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:04.200]   There is no accident here.
[00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:07.520]   This isn't the action of men.
[00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:14.240]   The pipes, the shadows, the offerings, all the ceremonial of the Old Testament is proof
[00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:19.880]   positive that this was the thing to which God was coming.
[00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:25.960]   This was the thing whereby he was going to make his way of salvation.
[00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:28.260]   Very well.
[00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.480]   This word "wherefore" tells us all that.
[00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:32.480]   "Wherefore Jesus also."
[00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:36.600]   He's the fulfillment of all this.
[00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:44.200]   So that brings us to the point of asking, what then exactly does this teach us?
[00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:49.720]   All I want to try to do this morning is to show you how this old type to which the author
[00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:58.600]   refers here helps us to understand what really happened on the cross and its meaning for
[00:14:58.600 --> 00:14:59.600]   ourselves.
[00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:05.000]   Now, he says what happened on the cross was the great antitype of that which they used
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.040]   to do under the old dispensation.
[00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:09.200]   Well, what did they do?
[00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:15.360]   Well, he's referring back, of course, to what happened in connection with the sin offering.
[00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:21.720]   Read for yourselves at leisure Leviticus 4 sometime this afternoon or this evening, and
[00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:28.880]   read again Leviticus 16, where you'll read about the great day of atonement.
[00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:35.080]   And our author here is referring to both those things, the sin offering, Leviticus 4, the
[00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:40.660]   great day of atonement in Leviticus 16.
[00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:41.660]   What did they do?
[00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:45.660]   Well, in its essence we can put it like this.
[00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:51.620]   They took an animal, a bull and a goat.
[00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:57.580]   And then the high priest came and he laid his hands upon the head of the animal.
[00:15:57.580 --> 00:16:03.580]   That was, of course, a symbolic action whereby he indicated that he was transferring his
[00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:10.480]   own sins and the sins of the priests and the sins of the people to this animal that was
[00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:13.300]   to be sacrificed.
[00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:19.580]   Then having thus transferred the sins to the animal, the animal was killed.
[00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:22.540]   His blood was collected.
[00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:28.740]   And having killed the animal and having taken the blood, they then took a part of the fat
[00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:35.540]   of the animal and burnt it upon the altar of sacrifice, of burnt sacrifice, of burnt
[00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:36.540]   offering.
[00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:42.660]   But, and this is the thing that is emphasized here, having taken away just that portion
[00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:48.980]   of the fat, they then took the remainder of the animal in his entirety outside the camp,
[00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:58.300]   outside the gate, and there in a clean place it was burned until nothing whatsoever remained
[00:16:58.300 --> 00:16:59.300]   of it.
[00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:02.420]   Even the skin was burned, everything was burned.
[00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:05.260]   No part of this animal was eaten.
[00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:15.340]   It was entirely burned and destroyed and removed in that way outside the camp.
[00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:21.220]   Then the other action, of course, was this, that the high priest took this blood, the
[00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:27.380]   blood of the animal that had been slain and sacrificed, he took it into the tabernacle
[00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:33.020]   and subsequently into the temple and went in to the holiest of all.
[00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:39.300]   He didn't merely go into the second chamber, the holy place, he went right in past the
[00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:47.460]   ultimate veil into that innermost sanctuary called the holiest of all, in which you remember
[00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:55.460]   was the place where God met with the people, the mercy seat, and the ark containing the
[00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:57.300]   tables of the covenant and so on.
[00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:01.620]   There's a wonderful description of it in the ninth chapter of this great epistle.
[00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:07.380]   He went in and he sprinkled the blood on this mercy seat and before it.
[00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:08.380]   What was he doing?
[00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:17.740]   Well, he was presenting the blood of the slain animal as an offering and a sacrifice and
[00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:21.420]   an atonement to God.
[00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:25.020]   And God received the offering.
[00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:30.460]   And thus the high priest was able to go out again to the people and announce that their
[00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:36.940]   sins were covered over once more and that they could proceed with their life.
[00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:44.180]   An atonement had been made, they were reconciled to God, and therefore all was well with their
[00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:45.180]   souls.
[00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:49.940]   Now that in its essence was the ceremonial, that's the very thing to which our author
[00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:53.380]   is referring here in the eleventh verse.
[00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:57.020]   Wherefore Jesus also.
[00:18:57.020 --> 00:19:01.940]   Now then, here's the way to understand what happened on the cross on Calvary's Hill.
[00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:06.820]   It was that in absolute perfection.
[00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:07.820]   Well what is it?
[00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:09.580]   Let us look at this for a moment.
[00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:15.100]   What does this therefore tell us about the event that took place on Calvary's Hill?
[00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:21.020]   And again, all I want to do with you is to hold these words before you and here's the
[00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:27.180]   first, Jesus, Jesus also.
[00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:30.820]   Wherefore Jesus also.
[00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:34.060]   Who is this Jesus?
[00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:37.500]   The answer of course has been given abundantly by this man himself.
[00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:43.380]   He starts his epistle by telling us about him, God who at sundry times and in divers
[00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:48.920]   men has spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets, hath in these last days spoken
[00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:56.460]   unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the
[00:19:56.460 --> 00:20:03.780]   world, who being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person, and upholding
[00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:11.140]   all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down
[00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:14.460]   on the right hand of the majesty on high.
[00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:19.740]   And you remember how he goes on to contrast him with the prophets, with the angels, with
[00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:23.300]   Moses, with Aaron, with everybody.
[00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:24.300]   Jesus.
[00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:29.340]   Oh, this is the first thing of course about which we must always be clear when we look
[00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:33.060]   at the cross on Calvary's Hill.
[00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:36.060]   This is none other than the Son of God.
[00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:40.300]   Jesus, the Son of God.
[00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:48.180]   We are not merely looking at a man, we are looking at God the Son, the heir of all things,
[00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:53.020]   the one through whom all things were made, and without whom was nothing made that is
[00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:54.020]   made.
[00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:58.260]   Jesus, Jesus also.
[00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:03.340]   We are looking at three crosses, a man on the right, a man on the left, but in the middle,
[00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:11.500]   a man, Son of God, the brightness of the Father's glory and the express image of his person.
[00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:15.020]   Very well, let's see what's happening to him there.
[00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:16.020]   What has he done?
[00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:23.340]   Well, once more, our words, our terms answer the question completely.
[00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:27.660]   Suffered, suffered without the gate.
[00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:30.580]   His own blood.
[00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:33.980]   What do these terms mean?
[00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:40.420]   We have only to go back again to the type to see exactly what it is.
[00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:44.500]   What was happening there, he says to Jesus, was the same thing that used to happen on
[00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:47.580]   the day of atonement.
[00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:48.580]   What happened?
[00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:50.940]   Well, I've reminded you.
[00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:55.020]   The high priest came and he put his hands upon the head of the animal, transferring
[00:21:55.020 --> 00:22:03.580]   the sins of the people to them, and the animal was then slain, sacrificed.
[00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:11.980]   So that as we look at that cross, we see that Jesus is a sin offering.
[00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:18.500]   He's made a sin offering there, which means, I say, that the sins of the people are laid
[00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:21.060]   upon him.
[00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:25.780]   All the sins they've committed and the guilt and the punishment that they deserve, it is
[00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:27.460]   laid upon him.
[00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:36.580]   The hands, as it were, are put upon his head, and thus the sins are transferred to him.
[00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:42.780]   But we must look for a moment at this word, suffered.
[00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:47.740]   Suffered without the gate.
[00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:53.620]   And the suffering, of course, has reference, as our type shows us, to the punishment that
[00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:59.500]   is meted out by the law of God upon the sins of men.
[00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:04.220]   That's why, you see, they had to take these animals, and that is why they had to slay
[00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:05.900]   them and present their blood.
[00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:07.700]   The law demands this.
[00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:12.740]   Without shedding of blood, there is no remission of sins.
[00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:20.300]   God is holy and just and righteous, and he's revealed that in his holy law, sin offends
[00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:24.500]   God and something must be done about it.
[00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:27.500]   The law of God demands the punishment of sin.
[00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:31.220]   God wouldn't be just if that were not the case.
[00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:36.620]   So what our type teaches us is this, that our sins were laid there upon the Son of God
[00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:45.500]   and that he suffered the penalty of the law of God upon sin and upon the guilt of sin.
[00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:52.060]   This animal that they used to take, you see, was struck, was smitten, was bled, and that's
[00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:54.940]   exactly what happened to him.
[00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:57.820]   He was smitten of God.
[00:23:57.820 --> 00:24:00.020]   He was afflicted.
[00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:03.220]   The lamb was slain.
[00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:07.340]   By his stripes we are healed.
[00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:14.380]   Oh, as you look at that cross, therefore, remember this suffering.
[00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:17.120]   It isn't merely a physical suffering.
[00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:20.180]   It was a terrible form of death, crucifixion.
[00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:25.780]   It was a very slow and agonizing kind of death, but the reference here in the word suffering
[00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:28.580]   is not merely to the physical agony and suffering.
[00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:35.020]   No, no, over and above that, there was this other element that he was smitten, stricken,
[00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:37.820]   wounded, bruised.
[00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:43.220]   This is the enactment of the law.
[00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:47.540]   But this other expression also helps to cast light upon this.
[00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:53.020]   We are told that he suffered without the gate.
[00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:57.260]   And we are reminded, you see, that the bodies of those beasts whose blood is brought into
[00:24:57.260 --> 00:25:03.380]   the sanctuary by the high priest for sin were burned without the camp.
[00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:08.540]   And we must see the meaning of that in what happened on the cross on Calvary's Hill.
[00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:11.500]   He fulfills that part of the type also.
[00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:13.740]   What does it mean?
[00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:19.140]   Well, what was being signified by the burning of the body of the beast like this outside
[00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:22.700]   the camp?
[00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:26.020]   And the answer is quite simple.
[00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:34.340]   The fire is symbolic of the wrath of God against sin, God's hatred of sin.
[00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:39.220]   You see, sin is something so terrible, so evil, that it cannot exist in any part or
[00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:41.380]   portion in the presence of God.
[00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:48.100]   So the animal was taken, skin and dung and everything, and the entire animal was consumed.
[00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:52.300]   It's got to be burned out of existence from the presence of God.
[00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:56.660]   That's what was happening.
[00:25:56.660 --> 00:26:03.940]   And Jesus also suffered without the gate.
[00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:12.060]   In other words, the whole wrath of God upon sin and evil descended upon him.
[00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:17.060]   All the guilt was utterly dealt with there and was destroyed.
[00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:23.580]   All the power and the force of the wrath of God against sin and evil was manifested in
[00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:25.460]   him there upon the cross.
[00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:30.100]   That's what it's teaching us.
[00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:33.260]   So that we must never lose sight of this.
[00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:37.140]   This author has already told us this in the previous chapter.
[00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:43.660]   "Wherefore, we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby
[00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:48.260]   we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear.
[00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:55.820]   For our God is a consuming fire."
[00:26:55.820 --> 00:27:02.700]   And he is a consuming fire as regards sin and evil and iniquity and vileness.
[00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:03.940]   He consumes it.
[00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:06.300]   The animal was burned entirely.
[00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:08.940]   Sin cannot exist in the presence of God.
[00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:11.300]   So God cannot merely pretend he hasn't seen it.
[00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:12.820]   He must destroy it.
[00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:18.620]   And there on Calvary's hill he destroys our sins and the guilt attached to them once and
[00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:24.460]   forever without the gate.
[00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:28.420]   But let us not forget that there was another element in this which happened outside the
[00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:37.940]   camp and that is, of course, the element of disgrace, the element of shame, the element
[00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:40.660]   of reproach.
[00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:44.500]   This man goes on to say in the next verse, "Let us go forth therefore unto him without
[00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:47.540]   the camp, bearing his reproach."
[00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:52.700]   To be put outside the camp was a terrible thing.
[00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:56.220]   It was a sign of reproach.
[00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:58.380]   That is what they did, you remember, with the lepers.
[00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:00.500]   The lepers were not allowed to be in the camp.
[00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:03.900]   They were ushered out, driven out, outside the camp.
[00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:06.620]   Unclean was the word upon them.
[00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:07.620]   Outside the camp.
[00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:08.620]   Lepers.
[00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:13.940]   But not only lepers, criminals.
[00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:18.220]   That's why the two thieves were crucified with him, outside the city wall.
[00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:22.420]   They didn't put criminals to death inside the camp or inside the city.
[00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:23.420]   No, no.
[00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:24.420]   It was a shame.
[00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:25.420]   It was a disgrace.
[00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:26.900]   It was a vileness.
[00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:31.700]   Outside the gate, outside the camp.
[00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:35.300]   And Jesus also suffered without the gate.
[00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:36.460]   Why?
[00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:41.340]   Well, because he was made a curse for us.
[00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:43.260]   The shame of the cross.
[00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:46.980]   He was counted amongst the transgressors.
[00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:50.700]   He shared death with murderers, with thieves.
[00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:54.220]   He was a moral leper, as it were, at this point.
[00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:55.540]   Unfit to be in the camp.
[00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:56.540]   Why?
[00:28:56.540 --> 00:28:58.520]   Well, because your sins and mine were upon him.
[00:28:58.520 --> 00:28:59.900]   He never committed sin.
[00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:03.260]   Tempted in all points like as we are, yet without sin.
[00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:05.420]   And yet he's off scouring.
[00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:06.420]   It's a shame.
[00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:07.420]   It's a disgrace.
[00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:10.420]   He humbled himself even unto death.
[00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:15.220]   Yes, even the death of the cross.
[00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:21.660]   The lowest, the vilest, the most disgraceful thing that can happen to any man.
[00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:26.300]   He suffered without the gate.
[00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:31.580]   And there we see something of the meaning of the cross on Calvary's Hill in the light
[00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:34.660]   of this ancient type.
[00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:37.980]   He was made a sin offering.
[00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:43.740]   The apostle Paul, you remember, puts that in 2 Corinthians 5, 21 in this way, "He,
[00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:46.860]   God hath made him to be sin for us."
[00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:50.260]   He was made sin, a sin offering.
[00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:51.580]   They were laid upon him.
[00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:53.100]   He is the animal.
[00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:55.100]   He is the lamb of God.
[00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:58.860]   He is the anti-type of the bulls and the goats.
[00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:02.460]   He's a sin offering.
[00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:07.860]   But our verse also tells us that he was not only a sin offering.
[00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:11.500]   He was also the high priest.
[00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:15.380]   And this is where he fulfills every type.
[00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:19.900]   Under the old dispensation, the high priest was a man, the offering, the sin offering,
[00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:20.900]   was an animal.
[00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:25.860]   But here, the offering and the priest are one.
[00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:33.020]   Therefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without
[00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:34.020]   the gate.
[00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:35.020]   Let's follow it.
[00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:44.060]   "I have told you and reminded you of what they did to the animal that was slain, but
[00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:49.500]   I must remind you again of what the high priest now began to do with the blood of the animal
[00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:55.020]   that thus had been slain and whose carcass had been burnt to nothing outside the camp."
[00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:56.300]   What did the high priest do?
[00:30:56.300 --> 00:31:02.700]   Well, he took it, as I've reminded you, into the holiest of all, the innermost sanctuary.
[00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:08.500]   And there he presented it, and there he sprinkled it on the mercy seat, and before the mercy
[00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:10.140]   seat what was he doing?
[00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:15.100]   Oh, he was making an atonement for the sins of the people.
[00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:22.380]   And Jesus also, having suffered, now we are told takes his own blood.
[00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:28.700]   As our great and merciful high priest, he now takes it not into some earthly tabernacle
[00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:34.820]   or sanctuary, but into the heavenly sanctuary itself, into the very presence of God, and
[00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:40.660]   presents his own blood.
[00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:44.020]   And thereby makes an atonement for our sins.
[00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:49.700]   You see, this is the thing we are told in Leviticus 17, 11, "For the life of the flesh
[00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:58.180]   is in the blood, and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for yourselves.
[00:31:58.180 --> 00:32:03.980]   For it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul."
[00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:09.020]   The blood, not the carcass, not the body, the presented blood, the poured out life,
[00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:14.620]   the life given in sacrifice, the blood is offered, the life has been given to bear the
[00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:20.820]   punishment of sin meted out by the holy and eternal law of God.
[00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:27.140]   And the astounding thing we are told is this, that the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God,
[00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:31.820]   is not only the Lamb of God that is slain, he's the high priest.
[00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:37.140]   And he takes not the blood of bulls and of goats, nor the ashes of an heifer, he takes
[00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:41.060]   in and presents his own precious blood.
[00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:45.820]   You have been redeemed, says Peter, in his first epistle, in the first chapter, not with
[00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:53.040]   gold and silver or such things, but with the precious blood of Christ as of a lamb without
[00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:55.060]   blemish and without spot.
[00:32:55.060 --> 00:33:01.580]   His own blood, he gives his own life for us.
[00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:02.580]   What for?
[00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:09.860]   Well, as I say, that we might be forgiven, that he might sanctify the people.
[00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:12.180]   What's the meaning of this word sanctify?
[00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:17.660]   Well, you mustn't think of it primarily in terms of sanctification.
[00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:23.140]   The word sanctify has as its primary meaning in the whole of the Bible, setting apart from
[00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:25.260]   God.
[00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:29.340]   The mountain on which God gave the law to Moses became a holy mount.
[00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:31.660]   It was sanctified, it was set apart.
[00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:37.580]   The vessels in the temple were sacred, sanctified vessels set apart for the use of God.
[00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:43.020]   And here we are told, wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people, set them
[00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:48.860]   apart from God, for God, take them out to the world, deliver them from this present
[00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:54.820]   evil world, present them to God, sanctify them, set them apart as a people for God.
[00:33:54.820 --> 00:33:56.780]   It means this.
[00:33:56.780 --> 00:34:03.500]   It means that we are forgiven and reconciled.
[00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:08.820]   And it means in a very wonderful way that we are given access and entry into the presence
[00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:10.900]   of God.
[00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:14.660]   This man has already been making that point.
[00:34:14.660 --> 00:34:20.940]   In the fourth chapter, having reminded ourselves that we have a great high priest that is passed
[00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:27.220]   through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, a high priest who can be touched with the
[00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:32.660]   feeling of our infirmities, because he has been tempted in all points like us, we are
[00:34:32.660 --> 00:34:35.100]   yet without sin, goes on to say this.
[00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:41.460]   Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, forgiveness,
[00:34:41.460 --> 00:34:44.740]   and grace to help in time of need.
[00:34:44.740 --> 00:34:49.140]   And then in the tenth chapter he has put it like this in a very wonderful statement.
[00:34:49.140 --> 00:34:57.860]   Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest of all by the blood of Jesus,
[00:34:57.860 --> 00:35:02.580]   by a new and living way which he has concentrated for us through the veil, that is to say,
[00:35:02.580 --> 00:35:07.700]   his flesh, and having a high priest over the house of God, let us draw near with a true
[00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:13.660]   heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and
[00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:17.820]   our bodies washed with pure water.
[00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:18.820]   That is the way.
[00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:25.460]   By his own blood he reconciles us to God, assuring us that we are forgiven and gives
[00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:34.580]   us access into the presence of God with boldness and confidence and assurance.
[00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:40.500]   That is what he was doing on Calvary's hill.
[00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:47.660]   He gave himself there as the Lamb of God in order that as our great high priest he might
[00:35:47.660 --> 00:35:54.020]   present his blood in the presence of God and might therefore sanctify us unto God, make
[00:35:54.020 --> 00:35:57.580]   of us God's people.
[00:35:57.580 --> 00:36:01.540]   Not the whole world, remember.
[00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:06.460]   Wherefore Jesus also that he might sanctify the people.
[00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:08.980]   The nation of Israel was God's people.
[00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:10.780]   All the nations were not.
[00:36:10.780 --> 00:36:12.980]   These were his peculiar people.
[00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:18.780]   And this is only true of his people, that he might sanctify the people with his own
[00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:19.780]   blood.
[00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:20.780]   Who were they?
[00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:24.580]   Well, they are those who believe in him, nobody else.
[00:36:24.580 --> 00:36:29.300]   Wherefore let us go forth unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach.
[00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:31.500]   They are the people for whom he has died.
[00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:34.260]   He didn't die for the sins of the whole world.
[00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:38.060]   There are many in the world who are going to hell and to everlasting perdition, but
[00:36:38.060 --> 00:36:42.260]   not the people.
[00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:51.460]   The people of God, those who believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and his atoning sacrificial
[00:36:51.460 --> 00:36:57.780]   death, those who go out unto him without the camp, ready to bear his reproach, ready to
[00:36:57.780 --> 00:37:03.700]   talk about the blood and not heed the ridicule that will be poured upon them, ready to believe
[00:37:03.700 --> 00:37:08.340]   that he is a substitute for sins and that it's not merely a tableau of God's love,
[00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:16.500]   bearing his reproach, they are the people for whom he has done it.
[00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:20.620]   And he makes of them not only a people that have a right of entry into the presence of
[00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:28.820]   God, they indeed become the very people of God, the children of God, heirs of God and
[00:37:28.820 --> 00:37:32.540]   joint heirs with Christ.
[00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:38.220]   It is to them, to us, who are his people this morning, who believe these truths about him,
[00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:42.580]   that he is son of God and that he died to bear the punishment of our sins.
[00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:48.300]   He gives us these blessings, he leads us in this world, but over and above it he prepares
[00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:51.820]   us for that world to come.
[00:37:51.820 --> 00:38:01.060]   Wherefore, let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach,
[00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:11.020]   for here have we no continuing city, but we, the people, seek one to come.
[00:38:11.020 --> 00:38:15.420]   These are the people for whom he died, the people who look not to this world and its
[00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:20.020]   passing pleasures, but the people who look for the city which is to come, the world to
[00:38:20.020 --> 00:38:24.940]   come, the glory that he'll usher in, the new heavens and the new earth wherein dwelleth
[00:38:24.940 --> 00:38:25.940]   righteousness.
[00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:27.100]   That's what he was doing.
[00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:32.540]   He was dying for these people who are to be the citizens of the everlasting kingdom of
[00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:38.380]   glory, who are to share with him in the government of the whole universe, who are to join with
[00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:44.200]   him in the enjoyment of this great inheritance that God has given him.
[00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:47.560]   We seek one to come.
[00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:54.620]   He died for the people who thus are set apart for God to be God's people and to enjoy their
[00:38:54.620 --> 00:38:58.300]   eternal inheritance.
[00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:05.900]   Very well then, my friends, that is the meaning of what was happening on the cross on Calvary's
[00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:07.660]   hill.
[00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:20.220]   Before any man has any access into God's presence at all, atonement must be made.
[00:39:20.220 --> 00:39:24.860]   And he died in order that the atonement might be made.
[00:39:24.860 --> 00:39:33.700]   God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto
[00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:34.700]   them.
[00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:45.740]   There is no entry into the holiest of all, into the presence of God, except by the blood
[00:39:45.740 --> 00:39:48.180]   of Jesus.
[00:39:48.180 --> 00:40:01.940]   He suffered to the uttermost the punishment of sin without the camp.
[00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:14.340]   And he has entered into the heavenlies, presenting his own blood for us as an atonement, propitiating
[00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:25.620]   the wrath of God upon sin, and reconciling unto God and making God's people, all who
[00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:32.580]   believe in him, and who forsaking their own righteousness and goodness and all their own
[00:40:32.580 --> 00:40:47.100]   efforts, turn to him in utter helplessness and hopelessness and give themselves to him.
[00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:52.720]   We either believe it or we don't.
[00:40:52.720 --> 00:41:04.040]   And we give proof of the fact that we believe it in this way, by going forth unto him without
[00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:15.760]   the camp, bearing his reproach, saying, "Let the world deride or pity.
[00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:24.760]   I will glory in thy shame.
[00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:34.200]   God forbid that I should glory save in the cross of the Lord Jesus Christ, whereby the
[00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:48.200]   world is crucified unto me and I unto the world, wherefore Jesus also, that he might
[00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:53.480]   sanctify the people with his own blood."
[00:41:53.480 --> 00:42:06.800]   Suffered, suffered the agony, the shame, the disgrace, the curse, the wrath of God upon
[00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:23.720]   sin and iniquity himself in his own body on the tree, that he might sanctify us and separate
[00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:27.560]   us unto God.
[00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:29.040]   Amen.
