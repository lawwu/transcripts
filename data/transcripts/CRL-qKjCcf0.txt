[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.040]   Welcome to the "Bogleheads" chapter series.
[00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.120]   This episode was jointly hosted by the South Florida and New York City "Bogleheads" local
[00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.200]   chapters and recorded November 2nd, 2022.
[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.040]   It features Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence, discussing his
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.240]   recent book, "The Bogle Effect."
[00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.840]   "Bogleheads" are investors who follow John Bogle's philosophy for attaining financial
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:24.840]   independence.
[00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.640]   This recording is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as personalized
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:30.640]   investment advice.
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:36.760]   Welcome to the "Bogleheads" chapter series meeting.
[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:45.600]   We are really delighted today to host Eric Balchunas, who is from Bloomberg Intelligence.
[00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.960]   He is the ETF expert or researcher with Bloomberg Intelligence.
[00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.720]   I like that title, Eric.
[00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.640]   Am I pronouncing your name correctly?
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.640]   It is Balchunas?
[00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:58.640]   Yeah.
[00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.240]   No, that's better than most.
[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.440]   Okay, good.
[00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.960]   We are delighted to have you here.
[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:11.880]   Eric is the author of this wonderful, wonderful book, "The Bogle Effect."
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:12.880]   It is a...
[00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.560]   I love the book.
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.200]   It's a great read, Eric.
[00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.560]   It's easy, well-written.
[00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:18.920]   I really, really appreciate it.
[00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:26.120]   I learned so much about the history of, well, the financial industry, as well as Vanguard
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.820]   index funds, and Mr. Bogle also.
[00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:36.440]   As everyone knows, we are the Bogleheads, and we follow the investing philosophy of
[00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.040]   Jack Bogle.
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:45.640]   Jack Bogle created Vanguard, and he also basically created the index fund for retail investors.
[00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:54.360]   Eric, we also have, not with us tonight, but we do have a Boglehead who invested in 1976,
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:01.920]   1977, with the Vanguard First...
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.080]   It's called the Vanguard First Index Investment Trust.
[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:13.640]   He was an airplane pilot, and he invested then, and he still owned it until the Vanguard
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.800]   opened their total market index fund, and then he thought that was a good idea.
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.040]   I asked him on the forum, "How did you even invest in that?
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.440]   Where did you even find that fund?"
[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.240]   He said he found it on the Wall Street Journal or Money Magazine.
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:35.000]   He just read a little bit about it, and he thought, "That makes perfect sense."
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.800]   Everything that you wrote in your book shows how everything came together for creating
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:42.800]   that fund.
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.480]   Anyway, let me go forward here.
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.280]   I'd like to introduce our helpers tonight.
[00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.760]   Gauri is going to coordinate the meeting and ask the questions.
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.060]   Gauri is from New York City.
[00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.200]   We have Alan from Tampa, the Tampa chapter.
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.400]   Carol from the Dallas chapter.
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.920]   Kip is joining us from Wyoming, and he said it is going to be the first snowfall tonight
[00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.080]   in Wyoming.
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.280]   I hope you're ready for that, Kip.
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.120]   We are, we are.
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.240]   We also have Jim from Chicago.
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.160]   He will be doing the recording.
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.160]   This meeting will be recorded from beginning to end, and it will then be posted on the
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.440]   Bogleheads calendar and the Bogleheads YouTube.
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.160]   In addition, we have several other guests.
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:35.800]   We have Mel Lindauer, who is one of the creators, the founders of the Bogleheads.
[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.120]   Hi, Mel.
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.320]   He's here.
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:45.120]   We also have, from Germany, Mary, who joins us from Germany.
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.740]   We welcome tonight the Japan Bogleheads.
[00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:51.400]   Mayumi is here from Japan.
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:04:02.520]   Eric, Mayumi worked for Vanguard from 2008 until 2017 and met Mr. Bogle several times
[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.280]   on the Vanguard campus.
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.200]   I visited Vanguard campus several times.
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:19.240]   I met with Bogle several times, and I impressed his talk very deeply.
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:28.880]   So I left financial industry last year, but I'd like to introduce Bogle's philosophy in
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:29.880]   Japan.
[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:36.760]   So we decided to establish Bogleheads Japan chapter last year.
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:37.760]   Thank you.
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.500]   Thank you so much.
[00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:40.500]   Very nice.
[00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:41.500]   Thank you for coming.
[00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:42.500]   We really appreciate it.
[00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:43.500]   Okay.
[00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.240]   Let me see what else.
[00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.680]   Zoom tips.
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.760]   Everybody probably knows how to use Zoom.
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.960]   You can keep your video off.
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.240]   Please keep yourself muted unless you're speaking.
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.640]   What we are going to do is hold the questions until the end of the presentation.
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.520]   Is that okay, Eric, that we hold the questions until the end?
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:02.520]   Yeah, sure.
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:03.520]   Okay.
[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.600]   That's probably easier, and I'm going to go very quickly.
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:07.600]   Okay.
[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.520]   So just jot down your questions, and then we can hit them at the end.
[00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:12.520]   Right.
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.280]   Put your questions in the chat, and we will be monitoring the chat.
[00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.080]   We'll get to them in the end.
[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.020]   You can save the chat.
[00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.560]   Throughout the evening, people will be posting things on the chat, links.
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:23.560]   Don't worry.
[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:24.560]   You don't have to write them down.
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:29.320]   You can save the chat by bringing the chat window up, and then the lower right are the
[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.160]   three ellipses.
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:35.360]   Click on that, and it will have an option to save the chat.
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:40.840]   The chat will be saved as of the time you click it, so do it at the end of the meeting.
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.160]   You can also move the goalposts if Eric has slides.
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.680]   The goalposts are the little -- you know, so the peanut gallery is over here, and his
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:47.680]   slides are here.
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:52.680]   You can move that goalpost so that you can enlarge his slides, and the disclaimer is
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.840]   that this is for informational and educational purposes only.
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.320]   We are not giving investing advice.
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:59.320]   Okay.
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:05.800]   Is there anything that I didn't cover, Gorey, Alan, Carol?
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.520]   >> I think you got it all, as far as I know, for me.
[00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:09.520]   >> Okay.
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:10.520]   Gorey, why don't you take over?
[00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:15.360]   Eric, I already mentioned that I liked your book, and why don't you take it over, Gorey?
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:16.360]   >> Fantastic.
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:20.960]   Thank you, Miriam, and thanks to the team that helped put this together, and Eric, it's
[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.360]   so great to have you here.
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:23.720]   Thanks for being here.
[00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:30.240]   So for folks who haven't seen or read Eric's book already, I will put it -- put the cover
[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:37.940]   on the screen while I read -- while I further introduce Eric a little beyond what Miriam
[00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:39.280]   already mentioned.
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.440]   So this description is straight from Eric's book.
[00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:47.460]   Eric Balchunas is a senior ETF analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence, where he writes for
[00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:49.640]   and leads the fund research team.
[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:55.480]   He has more than 15 years' experience working with ETF data, designing new functions, and
[00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:57.440]   writing research and articles.
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:02.920]   He also helped to create the first TV show solely focusing on the opportunities, risks,
[00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:10.200]   and current events in the ETF industry, Bloomberg ETF IQ, as well as a podcast, Trillions.
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:15.480]   He's a Bloomberg Opinion Contributor and the author of the Institutional ETF Toolbox, published
[00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:18.640]   by Wiley in March 2016.
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:24.360]   Eric holds a bachelor's degree in journalism and environmental economics from Rutgers University.
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:30.780]   Currently lives in Philadelphia with his wife and two sons, and as folks mentioned earlier,
[00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:33.800]   is in tune to the World Series game going on.
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:37.880]   So for folks who haven't read the book yet, I'm happy to say it reads and flows really
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:38.880]   well.
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:45.760]   I could see it appealing to both nerds, self-proclaimed nerd, and it would appeal to non-nerds as
[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:46.760]   well.
[00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:52.920]   But really anyone who's interested in a good story, it reads like you're watching a documentary.
[00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:58.280]   So for housekeeping, before I turn it over to Eric in terms of what to expect, like Miriam
[00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:03.280]   said, Eric will present first, after which I'll ask a few questions, and Miriam will
[00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:06.980]   ask a few questions, then we'll turn it over to questions from the chat.
[00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:12.520]   So again, folks should feel free throughout the evening to submit questions via chat.
[00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:15.760]   With that, I'll turn it over to Eric.
[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:19.400]   >> Thank you very much, both of you guys.
[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:22.640]   I'm going to share my screen real quick and just make sure we have the PowerPoint up and
[00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:24.560]   then we'll get going here.
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:27.400]   So let me share screen.
[00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:30.360]   It says host disabled participant screen sharing.
[00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:32.640]   Can you allow me to share it?
[00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:36.520]   >> Well, hold on, hold on, sorry.
[00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:37.520]   >> Okay.
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:40.040]   >> No, no, no, no, hold on.
[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:41.040]   Okay.
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:42.040]   >> I got it.
[00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:43.040]   >> There you go.
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:44.040]   >> Let's try it now.
[00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:45.040]   I got it.
[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:46.040]   Okay.
[00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:47.720]   So I'm going to share, and then I'm going to go like this.
[00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:48.720]   Let's go.
[00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:55.240]   I mean, my desktop is very busy, as you can see.
[00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:56.240]   I don't delete a lot.
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:57.240]   Okay.
[00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:58.240]   Can you see the full PowerPoint here?
[00:08:58.240 --> 00:08:59.240]   >> Yes.
[00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:00.240]   >> Okay.
[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.240]   All right.
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:02.240]   Let's get started.
[00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:04.600]   So thank you for the introduction, and I'm a big fan of the Bogleheads.
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:10.380]   And for those of you who heard me speak at the dinner that was at the banquet at the
[00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:15.960]   Bogleheads conference, some of this will be redundant, but you can just tune into Philly's
[00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:19.160]   game while I talk, and then come back in after.
[00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:20.160]   But this is a bridge version.
[00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:21.320]   I'm not going through every slide.
[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:27.840]   So I also wanted to just, I heard Mel was on the call, and Taylor, who really came ahead
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:29.680]   of me in that banquet.
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:37.820]   And I just want to say how awesome it is that they started this really cool organization.
[00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:42.360]   And Taylor in particular, who I interviewed for the book, was really helpful in my section
[00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:43.600]   on the Bogleheads.
[00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:48.440]   And again, I, it wasn't just because of him, but I dedicated the book to the World War
[00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:49.440]   II generation.
[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:51.280]   I know he was in Battle of the Bulge.
[00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:56.120]   But Bogle, in my opinion, when I went to hang out with him multiple times, I felt like I
[00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:59.640]   was kind of hanging out with my grandfather, or at least somebody from that generation.
[00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:01.840]   My grandfather was in the war.
[00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:02.920]   He was not a boomer.
[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:09.800]   And so I just felt Bogle's character and his wit was very much from that generation.
[00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:13.500]   And that's why I dedicated the book to my own grandparents.
[00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:14.500]   Thank you for asking me here.
[00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:19.100]   And look, this PowerPoint is rapid style, so I'm going to go very quickly.
[00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:21.280]   And if you have a question, we'll go to the end.
[00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:24.500]   So this is the cover of the book, which you just showed.
[00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:26.420]   So I won't spend much time here.
[00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:29.580]   I'll just go into why I wrote the book.
[00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:30.580]   People know who Bogle is.
[00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:33.880]   I'm a guy at Bloomberg, why would this happen?
[00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:36.660]   The main reason is, see this dictaphone here?
[00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:42.700]   During the pandemic, that's my jar of pens, which is the cute little ceramic clay thing
[00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:45.760]   my son made when he was like eight years old.
[00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:50.280]   And the dictaphone was just like gnawing at me.
[00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:53.960]   And Jack had passed away maybe a year before.
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:58.440]   And that dictaphone contained about three and a half hours of me and Bogle just going
[00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:03.800]   at it, both in agreement and disagreement and debates and discussions.
[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:06.640]   And I felt, especially the last interview, I felt he said some things about the future
[00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:07.640]   that were just so interesting.
[00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:11.400]   And I thought, you know, I really should get that on paper.
[00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:12.480]   And I knew I had the data.
[00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:17.020]   I'm a fund analyst who does nothing but look at funds data, and I'm blown away.
[00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:21.920]   Even as much as I look at it year after year, I'm still blown away at the amount of money
[00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:24.200]   Vanguard takes in every year.
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:25.200]   It is unbelievable.
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:31.200]   In any other industry, this would be a way bigger deal, but Vanguard isn't a public.
[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:33.240]   So it isn't as examined or studied as much.
[00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:38.220]   In fact, in my research department, the woman who covers asset managers only covers the
[00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:41.600]   public ones, BlackRock, Goldman, T. Rowe Price.
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.040]   She doesn't know a lot about Vanguard.
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:44.040]   It's not even on her dashboard.
[00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:45.720]   And I'm like, that's crazy.
[00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:47.160]   That's like not knowing about Amazon.
[00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:52.080]   So I thought if she doesn't know much about this company, there's probably other people
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:53.240]   who don't know a lot.
[00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:55.800]   And I could combine the interviews with the data.
[00:11:55.800 --> 00:12:03.120]   And as Gauri said earlier, I was always surprised there was never a documentary on Jack or Vanguard,
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:09.280]   given the incredible influence and the fact that we finally have a happy Wall Street story.
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:13.560]   I would just think this would just really attract the creative types, but there isn't
[00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:14.560]   one.
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:18.680]   So I wrote the book as a documentary with me as the narrator, and I interviewed 50 different
[00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:21.120]   people for the book.
[00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:26.520]   And if you read it, you'll realize you could almost turn this into a script for a documentary.
[00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:32.760]   So if anybody on here knows anybody at Netflix, just Gauri has my email.
[00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:38.640]   Vanguard is also a great vehicle to talk about the changing financial industry and the ecosystem.
[00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:45.920]   So it's not just funds, it's the advisory business, it's ETFs, it's behavior, it's trading.
[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:50.620]   There's so much going on that Vanguard allows you to talk about here.
[00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:53.800]   And I think it's a good business case study.
[00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:57.760]   The moral of the story here is treat your customers well, throw them a bone now and
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:59.960]   then, and they will stick with you.
[00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:02.800]   If you take all the money, they won't.
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:05.320]   And this is a great tale of that.
[00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:11.320]   And I think a lot of younger people who are into the more populism themes will identify.
[00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:16.000]   Here's a picture of me and Jack from, I believe, the second interview, or it might have been
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   the first one.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   I can't remember.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.580]   I'm 20 pounds skinnier, which is why, that's half the reason I like this picture.
[00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:26.940]   Yes, it's with me with this legendary guy, but I'm also probably in the best shape I've
[00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:28.140]   been for the past couple of years.
[00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:30.780]   I had to gain a few pounds during the pandemic.
[00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:34.380]   Anyway, this office, if you've ever been there, is really cool.
[00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:36.620]   There's papers flying all over the place.
[00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:38.980]   There's oil paintings.
[00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:43.660]   There's a pillow of Confederate flag in the United States.
[00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:50.220]   Again, it's a very old school room, and it's a special room, and I really enjoyed going
[00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:51.220]   there.
[00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:56.300]   But I was shocked at how much this guy knew about everything in the ETF industry.
[00:13:56.300 --> 00:14:01.180]   He knew a thematic ETF that was launched earlier that week that nobody cared about.
[00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:06.060]   He wanted to complain about the oil ETF right off the bat, and the dollar-weighted returns,
[00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:10.700]   and he showed me papers, and I was just like, "Wow, this guy's in his 80s, and he's kind
[00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:13.140]   of looking at the same stuff I am every day."
[00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:19.980]   And so that's sort of how our relationship began over the next five years, and I'll end
[00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:20.980]   with that.
[00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:23.900]   So the book project was born out of that.
[00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:29.100]   So what I'm going to do in this presentation is give you 10 takeaways from the book that
[00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:31.580]   might be obvious, but I think most are not obvious.
[00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:37.140]   They're things that I think would be big themes if you were to read it, and I'll start with
[00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:41.580]   this one, which is that indexing needed Vanguard way more than Vanguard needed indexing.
[00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:48.700]   It's ironic, but index funds got way too much credit for the index fund revolution.
[00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:54.320]   They simply wouldn't be a big deal unless Vanguard's mutual ownership structure existed.
[00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:56.680]   That's the real change agent.
[00:14:56.680 --> 00:15:00.980]   I would also add to that, Vogel's unique structure.
[00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:07.820]   Those two unique structures, to me, exploded to create everything we're seeing today.
[00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:12.460]   Indexing just got lucky to be around at the time.
[00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:16.260]   Indexing almost surfed the Vanguard wave in a weird way.
[00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:20.820]   And so I speculate in the book that if Vogel and Vanguard hadn't existed, indexing would
[00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:21.820]   happen.
[00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:26.180]   I mean, he didn't invent it, but it would only have 4% to 5% of the assets as today,
[00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:29.660]   maybe $500 billion versus $12 trillion.
[00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:30.660]   And I point to this.
[00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:31.980]   There's a couple of pieces of evidence here.
[00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:37.180]   I point to this quote that Jack points out, meeting Jonathan Lovelace in an airport in
[00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:43.020]   1974, when Lovelace heard that Vanguard was formed as a back office company that was mutually
[00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:44.300]   owned.
[00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:49.420]   This was two years before they launched the index fund and four months before Jack read
[00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:53.220]   the article in the journal that gave him the idea for the index fund.
[00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:56.420]   So this was purely based on the structure.
[00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:57.940]   Lovelace isn't a dumb guy.
[00:15:57.940 --> 00:15:59.820]   He nailed it all the way back in 1974.
[00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:06.280]   Now, the industry isn't destroyed, but it is on its way to being completely disrupted.
[00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:14.020]   And it's this chart here, which I think if you were to take one chart that defined Vogel's
[00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:15.660]   life's work, it's probably this one.
[00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:20.300]   This is the average fee of a Vanguard fund versus that of the average active fund.
[00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:25.820]   And you can see the natural gravity for the industry is to charge more because they're
[00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:26.820]   in a business.
[00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:30.500]   They're trying to serve these other people who aren't the investors, right?
[00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:36.100]   Vanguard obviously has this one master thing, and they continually vote to lower the fee
[00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:37.540]   over the years.
[00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:42.980]   It also shows that indexing wasn't dirt cheap from the get-go.
[00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:44.940]   It got that way over many years.
[00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:46.980]   I'm talking decades.
[00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:52.980]   It wasn't until 2010 that it was below 10 basis points.
[00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:54.820]   That's when it really took off.
[00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:59.820]   So this chart to me shows that it's the mutual ownership structure that brought indexing
[00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:02.860]   to a cheap point, which is when it really took off.
[00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:04.460]   I just don't think it gets cheap without it.
[00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:06.020]   And here's an example.
[00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:09.060]   If you look, there are many index funds today that are not cheap.
[00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:13.660]   In other words, it's not the guarantee that if you have an index fund, it's automatically
[00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:14.660]   cheap.
[00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:16.380]   This was just what Vogel did and Vanguard.
[00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:20.940]   I think if Vogel hadn't existed, index funds would be out, but they'd be 80, 90 basis
[00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:21.940]   points.
[00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:27.300]   They'd be used by institutions and fans of the efficient market hypothesis.
[00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:29.260]   And the one I highlight here is the Wells Fargo.
[00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:33.980]   This is the second index fund ever launched, and it still charges 44 basis points.
[00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:37.180]   And that's with Vogel and Vanguard in the picture.
[00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:42.220]   So imagine without, I say it's probably double, and nobody really cares.
[00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:45.060]   It's not a big deal.
[00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:48.460]   Now some people say, let's say indexing didn't exist at all.
[00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:52.060]   Let's say nobody had even thought of this as a concept.
[00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:56.260]   Vogel starts Vanguard, and he ends up starting to audit active funds eventually.
[00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:59.540]   I know he couldn't do it at first, but let's just say he could.
[00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:04.060]   I have premised that Vanguard would be the biggest active fund manager six times over
[00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:06.100]   if indexing never happened.
[00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:12.400]   They're already the third biggest, and that's with Vanguard crapping on active for 35 years.
[00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:19.040]   So you think about if he was praising active, or cheap active, if you will, I think Vanguard
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:20.040]   would have taken off.
[00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:24.000]   Because all studies point to the fact that the lower your fee is as an active fund, the
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.200]   higher or better chance you have of beating the benchmark over 10, 20 years.
[00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:32.840]   So the 10 to 20 year SPIVA reports, if you will, would show Vanguard active funds at
[00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:37.320]   the top, and the word would get out, and ultimately they'd get the majority of the flows.
[00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:42.120]   So again, this speaks to the mutual ownership structure is the thing.
[00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:43.480]   And here's another great example.
[00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:47.340]   The Wellington Fund is an active fund, as you all know.
[00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:49.600]   It was launched in the '20s.
[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:52.040]   And I actually looked at all the funds launched in the '20s.
[00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:53.760]   We'll call these the early pioneer funds.
[00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:55.800]   They're all 90 plus years old.
[00:18:55.800 --> 00:19:00.000]   And you can see here, Wellington has 90% of the assets of those funds.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:05.320]   First of all, half of them closed, and the half that exists only have 10% market share
[00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:06.320]   between them.
[00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:08.200]   So this, to me, is a great point.
[00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:12.160]   A, it shows you if Vanguard only had active, they would dominate.
[00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:19.040]   And B, it shows you that Vanguard today is going to dominate in the future too, because
[00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:23.880]   this shows you what they can do when that structure is applied to their home team, if
[00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:24.880]   you will.
[00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:27.280]   They're just ultimately going to win out.
[00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:30.800]   Okay, number two, Bogle's mission not yet realized.
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:33.360]   I had read a bunch of Bogle's quotes like everybody else.
[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:39.440]   The needle in the haystack, you get what you don't pay for, all these, those are the Ben
[00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:41.680]   Franklin type quotes we all know.
[00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:45.200]   But there was a quote I read in Character Counts that I was like, I'd never read before.
[00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:47.760]   And I was like, holy moly.
[00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:50.800]   And it's this one here, which is the first sign that Vanguard's mission is create a better
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:55.480]   world for the investor will be when our market share begins to erode.
[00:19:55.480 --> 00:20:00.480]   I've asked many people, I've been on like 25 podcasts, people who know business.
[00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:05.200]   Can you find a CEO in the history of time who has ever rooted for their market share
[00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:06.200]   to erode?
[00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:08.840]   Again, if you can find one, let me know.
[00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:11.540]   I still have not found one.
[00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:14.200]   Speak to the different trip this guy was on.
[00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:18.080]   Because what he knew back in 1991, by the way, when they were still small, was that
[00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:21.000]   ultimately, if you offer this great deal, people will come, right?
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.940]   You build it, they will come and they did.
[00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:27.200]   But it won't be until other people do it.
[00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:30.560]   And they get cheap and they become good stewards that Vanguard's market share will plateau
[00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:32.520]   and ultimately erode.
[00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:38.720]   So you can see he was on a quote mission beyond just making a big company to actually completely
[00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:40.440]   change the industry.
[00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:46.040]   This is why, and the Bogleheads are also why, at the beginning of the book, I compare Bogle
[00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:51.240]   to be a combination of Steve Jobs, because he put actual products that people could use
[00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:53.120]   in the marketplace.
[00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:57.800]   And Martin Luther, the Reformation guy, who stuck the thing right on the church door and
[00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:01.960]   preached this stuff right to the people in the church, pissed everybody off.
[00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:05.440]   But you can see he created a new religion in a way.
[00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:10.680]   And so I think that's sort of why the story was so attractive to me.
[00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:14.600]   There was multiple elements to it.
[00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:16.440]   And Vanguard's market share is not eroding.
[00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:17.760]   In fact, it's only growing.
[00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:21.880]   Right now, it's about 27%, 28% of all US fund assets.
[00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:26.040]   So that's double the old high watermark held by any other company.
[00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:29.440]   Fidelity was 14% in 1992, I think.
[00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:31.680]   Since then, it's been all Vanguard.
[00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:34.200]   And they take in more money than everybody else.
[00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:37.600]   And so until that changes, they're going to continue to grow their market share, obviously,
[00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:39.520]   especially in bear markets.
[00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:45.080]   The line at the bottom is the percent of the industry's revenue they account for.
[00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:50.360]   So you can see that they account for 5% of the revenue, but 27% of the market share.
[00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:54.640]   That gap also doesn't really exist in any other business.
[00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:56.800]   It's weird.
[00:21:56.800 --> 00:22:01.560]   But that, in my opinion, this chart, I would say, is the scariest chart on Wall Street,
[00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:06.960]   because it speaks of the pain that's to come, which I will feel, my company will feel.
[00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:12.520]   I write this book not as somebody who is necessarily rooting for this, because I feed off of the
[00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:15.560]   active fund industry in many ways in the trading world.
[00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:18.480]   But I'm an analyst, and I'm just trying to give it to people straight.
[00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:21.400]   So it's my analyst hat that I'm trying to explain all this.
[00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:25.200]   And I'm also trying to warn our clients, you had better have a plan for this.
[00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:26.200]   This is a big deal.
[00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:30.320]   It's like not having a plan for Amazon if you're in the retail business.
[00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:31.760]   And here you can see Vanguard's flows.
[00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:33.680]   They always take in more money than everybody else.
[00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:40.280]   They've taken a $2.4 trillion over the past 10 years, which is $920 million a day.
[00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:43.640]   So almost a billion dollars a day for a decade.
[00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:49.140]   The next most flow getter is BlackRock, with half.
[00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:52.240]   And then you need binoculars to see third place.
[00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:54.060]   And then many have seen outflows.
[00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:58.240]   So again, this deserves to be studied.
[00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:06.520]   If you look at the top funds in the United States by assets, now the top 10 are all cheap
[00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:07.800]   index funds.
[00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:10.680]   And eight of the top 11 are Vanguards.
[00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:13.080]   And three that aren't Vanguard are people who just copy them.
[00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:17.080]   So that'd be Fidelity, Spider, and let's get the one iShares.
[00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:21.120]   This is part of why I call it the Bogle effect and not like a book about Vanguard, because
[00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:24.760]   the effect is almost as interesting as the thing itself.
[00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:27.960]   These companies all had to copy Vanguard to get money.
[00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:30.760]   I just looked at Fidelity's flows recently.
[00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:36.640]   They've taken in $64 billion in their index mutual funds, but they've seen $30 billion
[00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:37.640]   out of their active funds.
[00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:40.200]   And this is a pattern we've seen all year.
[00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:44.720]   Fidelity looks like it's having good years, because it's flat for a little bit in terms
[00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:45.720]   of positive flows.
[00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:52.280]   But if you unpeel that, all the money that they get is into their low-cost index funds,
[00:23:52.280 --> 00:24:00.360]   which on one hand, it's like if there's ever a compliment, it's that Fidelity has gone
[00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:01.360]   here.
[00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:02.400]   But it's also smart of them.
[00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:03.400]   They swallowed their pride.
[00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:05.320]   They used the trash index funds.
[00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:10.560]   And now it's helping save their business in a way, at least on assets.
[00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:16.240]   And so a capital group has three in the top 15.
[00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:19.600]   Obviously, all those are below the top 12.
[00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:23.200]   I think those will probably be pushed off in the next couple of years, be 15 out of
[00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:24.760]   15 at some point.
[00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:30.120]   And just so you know, of all the passive assets out there that are low cost, Vanguard has
[00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:31.440]   half.
[00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:32.720]   The other half are other people.
[00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:34.440]   So Bogle would have loved this.
[00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:38.480]   I think Bogle would have loved that Fidelity did it, and Goldman did it, and Spyder did
[00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:39.480]   it.
[00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:40.480]   He was happy to see this.
[00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:44.680]   Number three, Vanguard wouldn't exist if not for a ton of serendipity.
[00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:46.600]   I didn't know everything about the story.
[00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:51.220]   So when I researched it, and I read all these books about it, I was just amazed at how many
[00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:55.560]   little moments it could have gone the other way, and we would not have a Vanguard.
[00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:59.280]   So the first moment would be when Jack's looking for a thesis to write.
[00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:04.840]   He goes to the library at Princeton in December 1949, he finds this magazine, Fortune.
[00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:09.680]   He reads it, and he finds an article on mutual funds in there, and says, "Oh, this is interesting.
[00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:12.320]   Let me write about this."
[00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:15.880]   I looked at other magazines that would have been laying around the library in December
[00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:21.880]   1949, and on time, the cover was Conrad Hilton, the hotel guy.
[00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:28.980]   So I tell anyone I know in the hotel industry, you guys dodged a major bullet, because we
[00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:33.280]   would have probably had low-cost hotels if he had picked up this magazine, who knows?
[00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:35.880]   But you can see, isn't it funny how life works like that?
[00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:38.420]   Sometimes your whole life can be just what you pick up versus not.
[00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:42.280]   I just think that's pretty wild.
[00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:48.000]   Another moment of serendipity was when Bogle was searching for a partner in the '60s, because
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.320]   his Wellington Fund was boring, and everybody wanted gross stocks, so he felt he needed
[00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:54.880]   to partner with an equity manager.
[00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:58.140]   He said he wanted a middle-of-the-road equity manager.
[00:25:58.140 --> 00:26:00.800]   So he went and he asked Capital Group, they said no.
[00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:02.640]   He asked Incorporated Investors, they said no.
[00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:04.860]   He asked Franklin, they said no.
[00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:08.760]   Wasn't until fourth on the list, Thorndike, Doran, Payne, and Lewis, they said yes.
[00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:10.100]   They were like Cathie Wood.
[00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:15.120]   They were like the arc of that era, small, but very growthy.
[00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:19.080]   And they were one of these people who saw everything as the new normal, and mean reversion
[00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:23.440]   is dead, really into this stuff, totally full of Kool-Aid.
[00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:28.180]   So when the '70s hit, the bear market hit, they got into a huge fight with Bogle, because
[00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:31.700]   Bogle thought they ruined his company.
[00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:34.840]   And so that bifurcation was nasty.
[00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:41.540]   And it was out of that bifurcation that Vanguard was born as a solution to this nasty situation.
[00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:44.320]   So let's say Capital Group had said yes.
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:45.840]   He was friendly with Lovelace.
[00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:48.520]   They weren't as hardcore into gross stocks.
[00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:50.580]   They probably wouldn't have had a falling out.
[00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:52.000]   Same with Franklin.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.840]   Again, interesting how life works.
[00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:59.400]   Sometimes when one door closes, another one opens, or something was just meant to be.
[00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:07.040]   And I found in my story here, the universe almost wanted this to exist in a weird way.
[00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:12.400]   The third one is now you have Vanguard, and you promised the new people that you will
[00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:13.400]   not manage money.
[00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:14.880]   You'll just do back office.
[00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:15.880]   So he reads this magazine.
[00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:22.440]   I think it was the first edition of the Journal of Portfolio Management, where Sam Wilson
[00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:25.240]   says, look, can somebody please set up an S&P 500 index?
[00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:26.680]   We need the pleas to people.
[00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:28.360]   Can someone do this, please?
[00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:29.560]   So Bogle, this is it.
[00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:33.760]   He thought, this is a great idea, and I can sell it to the board, because we're not actually
[00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:34.760]   running money.
[00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:36.240]   It doesn't have to be managed.
[00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:40.360]   And as he said to my colleague, Mike Regan, in a Businessweek article, they actually bought
[00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:42.640]   it.
[00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:45.140]   So he knew he was sort of getting one by.
[00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:51.360]   And again, that little opening created a whole different change in history.
[00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:55.800]   So it was those three things that I think were remarkably serendipitous.
[00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:58.320]   All right, let's have a little fun here.
[00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:02.440]   I think Bogle has a lot of similarities to punk rock.
[00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:06.640]   OK, let me, before you tune out, let me explain what I mean.
[00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:12.000]   Number one, before I interviewed Bogle, I would see him on CNBC and Bloomberg TV.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   And he would get up there.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:18.400]   And the whole network is designed to sign, where's the next hot stock sector?
[00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:20.280]   What do you think of the Fed?
[00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:26.540]   He'd get up like completely a 180, and he'd be like, trading is for losers.
[00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:28.560]   There is no there there.
[00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:29.720]   There's no way around the index.
[00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:35.240]   He would just pour cold water just on the whole network's mission, really.
[00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:38.040]   And I was like, man, this guy is kind of punk rock.
[00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:42.760]   He's just basically dumping on the whole thing, and he's got this nice smile on his face.
[00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:45.240]   He looks like Latter-day Henry Fonda.
[00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:48.760]   And I just found him looks like your grandfather.
[00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:51.920]   Somebody put it, grandfatherly assassin.
[00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:53.640]   And he would do this at events.
[00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:57.080]   He was at an ETF event, and he said, ETFs suck.
[00:28:57.080 --> 00:28:58.760]   Rate to the ETF people.
[00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:01.120]   He'd go to Morningstar and say, active is awful.
[00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:02.200]   Rate to active managers.
[00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:07.880]   And that idea of just antagonizing an audience like that is not easy.
[00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:11.760]   I think it actually helped him to create attention for himself and to sell indexing.
[00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:14.920]   But I give him credit for sort of being kind of punk like that.
[00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:19.280]   Most people just want to get along and not really stick out.
[00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:21.080]   If that were the only metaphor, I wouldn't have done it.
[00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:23.960]   But the other huge metaphor with punk rock is this.
[00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:27.320]   The birth of punk is largely the Ramones.
[00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:34.400]   The Ramones, in 1974-- by the way, three weeks between the Ramones' first show, Vanguard
[00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:35.520]   was formed.
[00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:42.320]   I think in the early '70s, a lot of things were forming that were like a let's get real
[00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:47.680]   reaction to the collapse of the '60s, both culturally and economically.
[00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:50.600]   So I think Vanguard was a let's get real reaction.
[00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:51.680]   So was punk rock.
[00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:54.320]   A lot of cinema became very gritty.
[00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:58.060]   And those movies have held up for a long time, just as punk rock has.
[00:29:58.060 --> 00:30:02.240]   And if you can see here, Ramone, Johnny Ramone said, all we did was take out the stuff we
[00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:04.860]   didn't like about rock and roll and use the rest.
[00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:07.800]   No blues influence, no long guitar solos.
[00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:12.280]   If you think about it, Jack's life work is taking everything he didn't like about the
[00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:15.160]   mutual fund industry and leaving what's left.
[00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:19.520]   Let's remove the expense ratio, let's remove the transaction costs, let's remove the brokers,
[00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:22.120]   and let's remove the human emotion.
[00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:25.800]   And so you basically get addition by subtraction.
[00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:30.880]   And this chart, I think, is a brilliant chart that he used, which is the growth of $10,000
[00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:35.000]   over 50 years, if you get 5% annually versus 7%.
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.600]   7% annually is after Bogle took out everything.
[00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:43.320]   The 5% is when the industry gets their takes and all this stuff is in the middle.
[00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:48.200]   And you can see, one will get you $300,000 and one gets you a little over $100,000.
[00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:53.680]   And this is a powerful way to explain that those little innocuous percentage points on
[00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:56.640]   fees add up over the long term.
[00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:59.880]   I also think he was punk by this one.
[00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:05.160]   When he wouldn't pay brokers-- again, this reminds me of Michael Corleone in Godfather
[00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:10.520]   2, when he wouldn't give the senator who was looking for handouts any money.
[00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:12.280]   He says, my offer is this, nothing.
[00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:19.160]   So this is a tough move, especially if you're a guy with a young family, a lot of kids.
[00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:25.720]   It would have been easier just to sell out to the man, pay the loads, get your fund some
[00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:26.800]   assets.
[00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:29.920]   And this was also in the midst of 80 months of straight outflows.
[00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:35.280]   Again, this is a pretty ballsy move, if I can say so.
[00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:38.680]   And it's ultimately saying, you need to come to us.
[00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:42.040]   So anybody who wanted to use Vanguard had to leave the system.
[00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:46.920]   So I actually fathom in the book that the RAA movement should be loosely credited to
[00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:47.920]   Bogle.
[00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:53.180]   He forced brokers to leave because they knew what they were up to was bad for the investor.
[00:31:53.180 --> 00:32:00.600]   Leave that system, which is pay-to-play, and go to Vanguard and set up as an RAA who was
[00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:01.600]   a fiduciary.
[00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:05.840]   Doing this made Vanguard's success take a long time.
[00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:08.320]   It would have been faster if you took the shortcut.
[00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:13.780]   And that's why this stat exists, which is wild, which is 97% of Vanguard's assets today
[00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:17.840]   came after Bogle stepped down as CEO.
[00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:22.320]   I looked at Apple, and 83% of Apple's market cap came after Steve Jobs left.
[00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:26.440]   So this is even a more hardcore situation than that.
[00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:28.760]   Active funds root problem isn't underperformance.
[00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:29.940]   It is, but it isn't.
[00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:34.120]   The root problem with active is not sharing economies of scale.
[00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:35.800]   Bogle didn't even have a problem with high fees.
[00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:39.960]   If you were just starting out, and you had to charge 1% on a small amount of assets,
[00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:45.400]   we'll say, in this case here, I'm showing you, 1% on $10 million is $100,000.
[00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:46.600]   You need that money.
[00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:47.600]   That's barely enough to live on.
[00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:49.560]   Let's say you have a billion dollars.
[00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:50.560]   Now you have $10 million.
[00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:51.560]   OK, fine.
[00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:52.560]   You have a staff.
[00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:53.560]   You have an office.
[00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:54.560]   You're up and running.
[00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:59.000]   But once you get to $40 billion, $75 billion, you keep that 1%.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:03.920]   Now you're looking at $400 million a year, $750 million a year, or in the case of a $100
[00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:09.200]   billion fund like PIMCO and Fidelity, that's a billion a year in fees.
[00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:11.440]   They didn't share any of that.
[00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:19.280]   They could have shared just a portion of the gravy and not even cannibalized themselves.
[00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:23.960]   And thank good will, the lower the fee would have helped their beat rates in terms of the
[00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:27.480]   benchmark, and Vanguard wouldn't have completely, utterly disrupted them.
[00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:30.440]   So they missed a major opportunity here.
[00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:35.200]   And Bogle argued to make dollar fees a bigger deal.
[00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:37.640]   But he couldn't even get the Supreme Court to agree to it.
[00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:42.080]   But I think investors over the years, just sniff test-wise, understood that this is a
[00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:43.080]   better deal.
[00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:45.080]   And obviously, we've seen the results.
[00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:48.880]   But it's the dollar fees that did them in.
[00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:51.800]   And it reminds me of the music industry.
[00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:58.000]   A CD was $16.99 for 30 years or whatever.
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.080]   But the cost of making a CD dropped to $0.50.
[00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:03.600]   The music industry didn't share any of their economy scale.
[00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:07.840]   So when the MP3 came along, and Napster, people were like, I'm leaving.
[00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:11.040]   I have no loyalty to these record companies.
[00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:14.520]   And the industry revenue of the music industry dropped by half.
[00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:18.720]   And so I think the MP3 metaphor is somewhat relevant.
[00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:22.440]   I think Uber to cabs, there's been many examples like this.
[00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:25.680]   The difference between those industries and this one, though, is that you can actually
[00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:29.640]   lose market share and still make more money in this industry.
[00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:32.040]   It almost should be illegal.
[00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:38.680]   You can see here that in 1993, passive made up only 2% of all assets.
[00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:39.680]   Active is 98%.
[00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:43.000]   In 2012, passive makes up almost a quarter.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.880]   Now it makes up 40%.
[00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:50.240]   But you can see here that active slice, even though it shrunk, the pie itself grew, because
[00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:53.640]   the market doubled like 10 times.
[00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:58.720]   Thus, they lost customers, didn't do a good job because they underperformed the benchmark,
[00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:00.360]   yet they got more money.
[00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:01.840]   And again, I benefit from this.
[00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:02.880]   I'm not knocking it.
[00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:04.880]   I'm just saying it's unusual.
[00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:08.040]   It's almost not really fair or capitalist.
[00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:11.680]   But that's what happens when you have an equity market premium baked into your business.
[00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:13.600]   You get lucky.
[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:20.360]   And this is part of why Jack said the index fund revolution has claimed no victims yet.
[00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:22.920]   Now a bear market is where we're going to see victims.
[00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:26.200]   And so I use this metaphor of the bank consolidation.
[00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:30.280]   It went from like 60, it was like the March Madness brackets, it went from like 35 banks
[00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:31.280]   to four.
[00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:35.520]   I think we're going to see something similar if this bear market goes on and on, because
[00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:37.140]   they won't have the market to save them.
[00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:43.380]   I think we'll see like three or four mega giant asset managers controlling 70, 80% of
[00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:44.660]   all assets.
[00:35:44.660 --> 00:35:45.660]   And they'll do everything for you.
[00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:49.820]   They'll do the mutual funds, the advice work, yada, yada, be full service, vertically integrated
[00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:50.820]   kind of thing.
[00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:54.360]   The other 30% will be niche providers.
[00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:58.220]   Maybe if we compare it to the airlines, those would be like your Hawaiian airs, right?
[00:35:58.220 --> 00:36:03.500]   They do specialized things, arc themes, crypto, alternative stuff like that.
[00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:04.640]   I could be wrong.
[00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:05.820]   This is how I see it playing out.
[00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:10.580]   I asked Jack what he thought, he said this, it's going to go even further than this.
[00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:13.980]   These companies are going to have to mutualize to survive, which means they're going to have
[00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:18.140]   to adopt Vanguard's structure to make it.
[00:36:18.140 --> 00:36:19.620]   I couldn't find anybody to agree with this.
[00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:25.820]   I asked even his close friends, Christine Benz, Burt Malkiel, Rick Ferry, even they
[00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:27.820]   didn't agree with this.
[00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:35.060]   Basically there was three things that nobody agreed with Jack on, mass mutualization, ETFs,
[00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:37.500]   and international.
[00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:42.220]   He was a man alone in those three areas, maybe not alone, but at least amongst his people
[00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:47.980]   who really liked him, definitely disagreed on those big topics.
[00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:52.220]   Number six, the bigger Active gets, the more active Active will become.
[00:36:52.220 --> 00:36:59.140]   So like I said, BogleEffect isn't just funds, he's changing or Vanguard is changing Active.
[00:36:59.140 --> 00:37:04.500]   So what we see is the modern portfolio based on the way flows are going these days is 85%
[00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:06.780]   of a portfolio now is low cost, cheap beta.
[00:37:06.780 --> 00:37:09.540]   This is your 60/40 for like seven bips.
[00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:11.140]   It's a wonderful thing.
[00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:12.140]   Everybody's happy.
[00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:14.980]   The problem with it is it's boring as hell.
[00:37:14.980 --> 00:37:19.660]   Now for Bogleheads, you may love boring and Bogle himself would say that's fine with me.
[00:37:19.660 --> 00:37:24.860]   Boring is good, but there are definitely people who want to decorate that and maybe keep themselves
[00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:27.680]   a little busy, have some fun in the market and speculate.
[00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:30.620]   So what they want is something completely opposite.
[00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:33.260]   So they want a hot sauce.
[00:37:33.260 --> 00:37:42.220]   This would be something like ARK would fit here, thematic ETFs, crypto, NFTs, call options,
[00:37:42.220 --> 00:37:45.260]   an account at Robinhood where you just trade stocks.
[00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:48.300]   That would be the hot sauce lane and that is a viable lane.
[00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:49.660]   We do see flows going there.
[00:37:49.660 --> 00:37:54.020]   This partially explains Cathie Wood's staying power.
[00:37:54.020 --> 00:37:58.060]   ARK has not seen any outflows, even though they're down 70%.
[00:37:58.060 --> 00:38:02.780]   And my theory on that is because everybody has the serious, fundamentally sound stocks
[00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:05.340]   covered in their Vanguard fund.
[00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:06.420]   They don't need her for that.
[00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:11.460]   They need her to be crazy and live in the future.
[00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:15.940]   And so that hot sauce plate is a little bit to satisfy your FOMO because, hey, what if
[00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:20.460]   this lady's right and there's robo taxis and AI all over the place?
[00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:24.260]   I don't want to be sad I missed out.
[00:38:24.260 --> 00:38:30.860]   So I think, ironically, Cathie Wood staying power is a byproduct of Vogel's success of
[00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:33.940]   dominating the portfolio.
[00:38:33.940 --> 00:38:39.540]   And we know this because the number of stocks in every new equity ETF launch is going down.
[00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:44.540]   In other words, they're designing ETFs now, which is where all the innovation is, to have
[00:38:44.540 --> 00:38:46.700]   maximum pot potential.
[00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:48.700]   They want to be your hot sauce.
[00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:51.280]   They certainly don't want to compete with Vanguard.
[00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:55.020]   This is also why we say that if you're in the middle, you're in trouble.
[00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:57.820]   And this is where legacy active would exist.
[00:38:57.820 --> 00:39:03.500]   If you're kind of near the benchmark and you charge over 20 basis points, you're probably
[00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:05.340]   going to go extinct.
[00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:07.120]   So the middle is dead.
[00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:10.340]   But if you're cheap or shiny, you might have a future.
[00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:15.300]   OK, Vogel's relationship with ETFs was complicated.
[00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:18.460]   So I know I'm an ETF business.
[00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:21.180]   He wasn't a fan.
[00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:23.500]   But what's funny is he had such a big impact on ETFs.
[00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:30.140]   If it wasn't for Vogel, ETFs would be a couple percent of assets of what they are today.
[00:39:30.140 --> 00:39:37.340]   So for example, when S&P 500, or I say Amex, Nate Most, wanted to launch the first ETF
[00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:41.540]   in the early 90s, he went to Vogel's office, said, hey, can we make the Vanguard index
[00:39:41.540 --> 00:39:42.540]   fund be the first ETF?
[00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:45.140]   And Vogel said, no way, I hate trading.
[00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:47.320]   Here's a couple ideas on your design.
[00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:51.220]   So Nate Most goes to State Street with the same pitch, and they buy it.
[00:39:51.220 --> 00:39:57.780]   But when SPY comes out in 1993, the expense ratio is 0.20%.
[00:39:57.780 --> 00:39:59.180]   Why?
[00:39:59.180 --> 00:40:05.700]   That is where Vanguard 500 index mutual fund had been mutually owned structured down to
[00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:06.700]   in '93.
[00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:11.900]   So SPY launches because it wants to be able to be at the same price point as Vanguard.
[00:40:11.900 --> 00:40:12.900]   Major.
[00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:16.660]   Had SPY launched at 80 or 90, the ETF business would not be what it is.
[00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:20.700]   It started out on third base because it was 20 bits.
[00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:25.380]   And then Barclays comes along and see, it was originally designed to be a trading tool,
[00:40:25.380 --> 00:40:30.500]   but Barclays comes along and sees it as something that could spread to retail because it's low
[00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:32.740]   cost, tax efficient, yada, yada.
[00:40:32.740 --> 00:40:39.060]   So that's sort of a major contribution to the ETF market that he did not like at all.
[00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:45.260]   I sometimes equate Vogel's relationship to ETFs is like this, like the index mutual fund
[00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:49.740]   was like his firstborn daughter who he just loved.
[00:40:49.740 --> 00:40:54.620]   And the ETF was like the sort of tatted up bad boy that she married.
[00:40:54.620 --> 00:40:59.540]   So he didn't like it, but he's in the family now and he has to deal with it.
[00:40:59.540 --> 00:41:04.220]   And he would wrestle with it for the rest of his life, and he could never get comfortable
[00:41:04.220 --> 00:41:05.220]   with it.
[00:41:05.220 --> 00:41:11.860]   He even would like, he'd make some, you know, he would offer an olive branch a little bit
[00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:15.180]   sometimes, but then he would go right back to how it trades too much and he didn't like
[00:41:15.180 --> 00:41:17.740]   trading and he'd just never get comfortable with it.
[00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:23.220]   And now ETFs are bigger than traditional index funds in assets.
[00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:27.780]   And if you look at Vanguard, they're about to become the biggest ETF for sure.
[00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:33.980]   In two years, they're going to pass BlackRock, who is the white line in assets there.
[00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:39.800]   And again, on one hand, ETFs spread indexing to more people.
[00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:41.740]   How can you be, you know, how can you hate that?
[00:41:41.740 --> 00:41:45.420]   On the other, they do trade and he was against trading so you could understand his point
[00:41:45.420 --> 00:41:46.420]   of view.
[00:41:46.420 --> 00:41:52.460]   A lot of times in the book when Vogel would go savage, unless it was against dollar fees
[00:41:52.460 --> 00:41:55.500]   of high cost managers, I agree with him completely there.
[00:41:55.500 --> 00:41:59.740]   I would sort of just lay out both points of view because he would fight with Vanguard
[00:41:59.740 --> 00:42:00.740]   and ETFs.
[00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:04.580]   And I'm like, I don't know, here's, you know, here's his take, here's some other people's
[00:42:04.580 --> 00:42:06.860]   takes, you be the judge.
[00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:13.380]   But anyway, Vogel, I think also beyond the trading of ETFs, he didn't like the innovation.
[00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:18.500]   And so he said he felt like Dr. Frankenstein where he had created a monster.
[00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:22.660]   And you know, Gus Sauter and Rick Ferry, they agree, they think the ETF industry has gotten
[00:42:22.660 --> 00:42:27.680]   too crazy, all kinds of weird stuff coming out that are based on the index funds.
[00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:32.980]   And they're sort of riding the index funds success a bit because they're technically
[00:42:32.980 --> 00:42:36.220]   passive, but they're far from it in spirit.
[00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:38.780]   So I kind of understand what he felt here.
[00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:44.740]   But I will say the bulk of the money in ETFs goes to very boring, vanilla, cheap beta.
[00:42:44.740 --> 00:42:49.340]   So I think his influence is bigger than even he might think.
[00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:51.740]   And this is a funny story.
[00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:56.900]   Our last podcast with him, which was six months before he passed away, he was 89, I believe,
[00:42:56.900 --> 00:42:57.900]   or 88.
[00:42:57.900 --> 00:43:02.900]   At the end of our ETF podcast, we ask every guest a fun question to end it on.
[00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:05.220]   We say, what's your favorite ETF ticker?
[00:43:05.220 --> 00:43:07.740]   Because ETFs have some funny tickers.
[00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:13.740]   He thinks for three seconds, and he goes, CRZY, which isn't a ticker, by the way.
[00:43:13.740 --> 00:43:20.540]   It's just his take on ETFs, but in a ticker form, which, again, we thought was just really
[00:43:20.540 --> 00:43:25.420]   funny and witty, especially for someone of that age, his mind was sharp as a tack.
[00:43:25.420 --> 00:43:29.740]   And he could, you know, have a sense of humor, because he just got done ranting against them.
[00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:33.940]   And then he's able to sort of have fun with it and move on.
[00:43:33.940 --> 00:43:36.220]   Number eight, most passive worries are overblown.
[00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:38.300]   I'll go fast through this.
[00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:41.660]   The idea that passive is going to, like, take over the stock market and ruin everything
[00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:43.220]   is just wrong.
[00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:48.980]   If you look at the ownership of the stock market, households own 40% of all stocks.
[00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:52.660]   Mutual funds and ETFs that are passively managed own about 17%, 18%.
[00:43:52.660 --> 00:43:56.440]   If we add institutions, we might get to 25%.
[00:43:56.440 --> 00:44:02.860]   But even if mutual funds and ETFs were 100% passive, that would still be only 40% of the
[00:44:02.860 --> 00:44:03.860]   stock market.
[00:44:03.860 --> 00:44:07.740]   So you're still looking at at least half would be trading.
[00:44:07.740 --> 00:44:13.100]   Burt Malkiel, Gus Sauter, even Vogel thought you can get well over 70% and still be fine
[00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:14.100]   and have price discovery.
[00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:18.060]   Speaking of price discovery, I don't think index funds are really ruining fundamentals.
[00:44:18.060 --> 00:44:24.140]   We've seen time and again a stock price like GE here will crash, essentially, over like
[00:44:24.140 --> 00:44:28.140]   a 10-month or 18-month period because of bad earnings.
[00:44:28.140 --> 00:44:34.080]   Meanwhile, the blue bars are showing you flows into index funds and ETFs that own GE.
[00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:36.360]   So clearly, the tail cannot wag the dog.
[00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:42.300]   It's just not enough muscle power to make that stock not react to bad news.
[00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:48.220]   Now, would the stock have gone down 50% instead of 45% because there was a bid coming in from
[00:44:48.220 --> 00:44:49.220]   passive?
[00:44:49.220 --> 00:44:50.220]   Maybe.
[00:44:50.220 --> 00:44:51.220]   But I would almost argue that's a good thing.
[00:44:51.220 --> 00:44:55.620]   I think passive and the relentless bid can sometimes put a floor in a sell-off, which
[00:44:55.620 --> 00:44:56.620]   helps everybody.
[00:44:56.620 --> 00:44:58.220]   So I have no problem with it.
[00:44:58.220 --> 00:44:59.940]   I'm a big sniff test, guys.
[00:44:59.940 --> 00:45:05.500]   If stocks don't move on earnings the way they should, then I think we need to start looking
[00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:07.020]   at this more.
[00:45:07.020 --> 00:45:12.380]   Now, what is a big concern that is-- most of these worries on passive I just kick out
[00:45:12.380 --> 00:45:13.660]   pretty quickly.
[00:45:13.660 --> 00:45:19.020]   The one that I tend to find most legitimate is that you have a concentration of voting
[00:45:19.020 --> 00:45:20.020]   power.
[00:45:20.020 --> 00:45:22.700]   Vanguard owns 8.4% of most stocks.
[00:45:22.700 --> 00:45:27.980]   They are now the top owner of 69% of the stocks in the S&P 500.
[00:45:27.980 --> 00:45:29.280]   And BlackRock is 7%.
[00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:33.100]   So the two of them own 15% of every company in America.
[00:45:33.100 --> 00:45:36.180]   And their little corporate governance group, which is made up of a couple of people, are
[00:45:36.180 --> 00:45:38.860]   voting 8% of that share.
[00:45:38.860 --> 00:45:42.940]   That's 30 million investors getting voted on by five people.
[00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:43.940]   I don't even like that.
[00:45:43.940 --> 00:45:44.940]   I think there's something wrong with it.
[00:45:44.940 --> 00:45:50.500]   So Vanguard actually today came out and said, we're going to try to do a pilot program where
[00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:53.380]   we let people have a choice on how they're going to vote.
[00:45:53.380 --> 00:45:58.340]   So if you want to have a third party do it, or we'll do it if you want, or you can opt
[00:45:58.340 --> 00:46:04.620]   not to vote, I think it's a practical solution to help solve this concern over this.
[00:46:04.620 --> 00:46:09.100]   Because that 8.4% is going to grow, because they take in more money than everybody else.
[00:46:09.100 --> 00:46:13.500]   So it could get to 15%, 20% at some point.
[00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:15.300]   So anyway, I think this is an issue we're going to see.
[00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:21.940]   But what they did today will go a long way in staving off potential regulation.
[00:46:21.940 --> 00:46:23.620]   And this brings me to my Warren Buffett quote.
[00:46:23.620 --> 00:46:25.780]   Like I said, I interviewed 50 people.
[00:46:25.780 --> 00:46:32.300]   One of them was Warren Buffett, who answered my email within like half a day, by the way.
[00:46:32.300 --> 00:46:36.580]   I was told he will never reply to me, because I'm like nobody.
[00:46:36.580 --> 00:46:38.140]   But he did.
[00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:42.380]   And he answered four or five questions, because he said he loved Jack.
[00:46:42.380 --> 00:46:47.220]   Anyway, one of the questions I had was, do you think passive is getting too big?
[00:46:47.220 --> 00:46:51.180]   And he said, if index funds continue to grow, there will be public policy issues down the
[00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:52.180]   line.
[00:46:52.180 --> 00:46:53.340]   But that's a subject for another day.
[00:46:53.340 --> 00:46:56.500]   So I do think at some point, we have a team on our team, it's the only thing that can
[00:46:56.500 --> 00:46:59.980]   stop Vanguard is regulation.
[00:46:59.980 --> 00:47:01.540]   And at some point, I think they'll be regulated.
[00:47:01.540 --> 00:47:04.020]   But here's the thing, it doesn't even matter.
[00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:06.940]   Because every firm now has low cost passive funds.
[00:47:06.940 --> 00:47:10.460]   So if Vanguard can no longer sell funds to you, you can go to Fidelity, you can go to
[00:47:10.460 --> 00:47:12.300]   Goldman, you can go to Schwab.
[00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:16.900]   That again, is why I call the book Bogle Effect, and not like the Vanguard story.
[00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:22.180]   Number nine, a cheap index fund is way undercredited for improving investor behavior.
[00:47:22.180 --> 00:47:26.860]   There's all these books on behavior and psychology and all these advisors, I think they take
[00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:29.760]   a lot of credit for behavioral coaching.
[00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:34.060]   But try doing that when the person's in a high cost active fund that's underperforming
[00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:35.700]   the market.
[00:47:35.700 --> 00:47:36.940]   That is hard.
[00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:40.880]   But in a cheap index fund makes behavior very easy.
[00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:45.460]   And we know this because the flows go into index funds and ETFs, even when the market's
[00:47:45.460 --> 00:47:46.580]   down.
[00:47:46.580 --> 00:47:51.500]   Index fund investors are the best behaved, like maybe seals level discipline.
[00:47:51.500 --> 00:47:55.300]   And same thing this year, they're not leaving, they're fine.
[00:47:55.300 --> 00:47:59.380]   They don't just can't be, because you know why?
[00:47:59.380 --> 00:48:02.380]   They've resigned to the fact they have the best possible deal.
[00:48:02.380 --> 00:48:06.020]   They probably think to themselves, oh, the market's down, what am I going to do?
[00:48:06.020 --> 00:48:10.860]   Jump out of this three basis point total market fund, and hop into some hot manager who has
[00:48:10.860 --> 00:48:15.740]   happened to pick like managed futures or like inverse strategy and having no, because I
[00:48:15.740 --> 00:48:19.100]   know they'll underperform eventually, I'll just stick where I am.
[00:48:19.100 --> 00:48:20.100]   And that's that.
[00:48:20.100 --> 00:48:21.960]   So I call it the great resignation.
[00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:23.780]   And that has that.
[00:48:23.780 --> 00:48:30.460]   But so just by providing a cheap index fund, he radically made behavior way more easy.
[00:48:30.460 --> 00:48:31.460]   And he should get more credit.
[00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:35.420]   I think the academics don't really give him enough credit for that.
[00:48:35.420 --> 00:48:37.900]   And I like to look at Vanguard's flows during 2008.
[00:48:37.900 --> 00:48:42.660]   I mean, this should be in a hanging in art gallery.
[00:48:42.660 --> 00:48:44.540]   They took in money every month.
[00:48:44.540 --> 00:48:46.780]   That's just insane.
[00:48:46.780 --> 00:48:50.500]   Even in October, when the market was down 17%, they took in cash.
[00:48:50.500 --> 00:48:52.760]   That is, it's just, it's crazy.
[00:48:52.760 --> 00:48:56.720]   So again, this deserves to be studied, it's not normal.
[00:48:56.720 --> 00:49:01.060]   And this is a quote from Michael Lewis, who I also interviewed for the book, who gave
[00:49:01.060 --> 00:49:06.660]   this knock on effect of Vanguard about how once you have this great resignation, you
[00:49:06.660 --> 00:49:08.700]   can just stop looking at this stuff.
[00:49:08.700 --> 00:49:10.980]   And for him, he said it made him a better writer.
[00:49:10.980 --> 00:49:13.740]   He became a Vanguard investor in the 80s actually.
[00:49:13.740 --> 00:49:15.540]   And he says, I don't have to worry about this.
[00:49:15.540 --> 00:49:18.620]   I can focus on my job, my family, whatever.
[00:49:18.620 --> 00:49:19.620]   And that's a beautiful thing.
[00:49:19.620 --> 00:49:21.500]   Again, it's an unmeasured benefit.
[00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:25.900]   And I think this kind of takes you in the mindset of the great, the resigned Vanguard
[00:49:25.900 --> 00:49:26.900]   investor.
[00:49:27.500 --> 00:49:32.780]   That's to say, sometimes it's not easy to do this because you have free trading.
[00:49:32.780 --> 00:49:38.380]   You've got the media focuses on like trying to scare you or give you FOMO.
[00:49:38.380 --> 00:49:40.460]   So there are definitely elements that can make this tough.
[00:49:40.460 --> 00:49:43.660]   But I think a cheap index fund has been able to overcome all those.
[00:49:43.660 --> 00:49:47.340]   And for the young people that have gone crazy trading over the past decade, the Robin Hood
[00:49:47.340 --> 00:49:54.860]   Army, you know, we look at their, they make up 24% of all equity trading in 2021.
[00:49:54.860 --> 00:49:56.780]   That was the height of the Robin Hood Army thing.
[00:49:56.780 --> 00:50:02.100]   That's up from 10% a decade ago, but you see how it's fallen off because they got a bear
[00:50:02.100 --> 00:50:03.100]   market.
[00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:06.260]   It's a lot harder to be a day trader when a bear market hits, it sobers you up.
[00:50:06.260 --> 00:50:09.820]   So I think the whole day trading thing is just a young person's thing.
[00:50:09.820 --> 00:50:12.740]   I did it when I was in the 90s as a Gen Xer.
[00:50:12.740 --> 00:50:16.820]   And then I got handed a bear market, realized I'm not a genius.
[00:50:16.820 --> 00:50:21.720]   And I got a family, a house, and I can't just be like wasting money gambling on the market.
[00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:26.420]   So these young people are going to find what Dave Nading calls Vogel's hack, which reminds
[00:50:26.420 --> 00:50:28.340]   me of the scene in war games.
[00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:33.620]   When the computer figures out that when it comes to nuclear war, the only winning game
[00:50:33.620 --> 00:50:39.420]   is not to play, which I think is where you eventually get to as an investor, a young
[00:50:39.420 --> 00:50:41.680]   person who tried it the other way.
[00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:48.060]   So I do think that this is sort of the natural state of things, but it does make it way easier
[00:50:48.060 --> 00:50:49.060]   not to play.
[00:50:49.060 --> 00:50:53.100]   If you have a three basis point index fund, a little harder when you're only dealing with
[00:50:53.100 --> 00:50:55.060]   like a fidelity active fund.
[00:50:55.060 --> 00:51:01.300]   And then finally, the Vogel effect is much bigger than Vanguard, and it's only just beginning.
[00:51:01.300 --> 00:51:05.380]   I think that the Vogel effect is going to hit the advisory business next.
[00:51:05.380 --> 00:51:09.060]   Here's the assets in Vanguard's personal advisory service, which charges you between five and
[00:51:09.060 --> 00:51:10.580]   30 basis points.
[00:51:10.580 --> 00:51:13.660]   I think advisors that charge 1% are probably in trouble.
[00:51:13.660 --> 00:51:17.420]   There's some that are specialized that will be fine, but there's a middle, I think, that's
[00:51:17.420 --> 00:51:23.420]   going to be disrupted by Schwab, Vanguard, Wealthfront, Betterment over the next 20 years.
[00:51:23.420 --> 00:51:28.300]   This is the next big area, and they manage 26 trillion in assets, so there's a lot of
[00:51:28.300 --> 00:51:29.980]   money here at play.
[00:51:29.980 --> 00:51:36.140]   I also think overseas, right now, the Vogel effect is just barely, barely even cracking
[00:51:36.140 --> 00:51:41.400]   the surface in Europe, in South America, in Asia.
[00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:42.620]   So here's a chart.
[00:51:42.620 --> 00:51:46.180]   The further right this chart is, the more passive the country is.
[00:51:46.180 --> 00:51:51.980]   Japan is not really, it's an outlier because the Bank of Japan bought a bunch of ETFs.
[00:51:51.980 --> 00:51:52.980]   It's not really that high.
[00:51:52.980 --> 00:51:56.160]   But you can see the US is pretty much the furthest along.
[00:51:56.160 --> 00:52:02.460]   We think all of this is going to go to 75%, at least, before it finds some medium.
[00:52:02.460 --> 00:52:04.300]   But it will take 10 years, probably.
[00:52:04.300 --> 00:52:08.460]   Because overseas, there's still brokers who rely on kickbacks and mutual funds, or think
[00:52:08.460 --> 00:52:11.140]   their value add is to pick an active fund manager.
[00:52:11.140 --> 00:52:17.780]   And again, in the US, we were all pushed into being somewhat intelligent on investing because
[00:52:17.780 --> 00:52:22.180]   we had to, they have 401k here, the 401k market.
[00:52:22.180 --> 00:52:27.900]   So US investors are smarter than other investors because other investors get defined benefits
[00:52:27.900 --> 00:52:29.140]   and pensions.
[00:52:29.140 --> 00:52:31.780]   And so they never really have to learn about what fees mean and all this stuff.
[00:52:31.780 --> 00:52:34.860]   So that's another challenge for overseas.
[00:52:34.860 --> 00:52:38.580]   But ultimately, I'm a big believer in value and technology.
[00:52:38.580 --> 00:52:41.980]   And the Vogel effect is what that's all about.
[00:52:41.980 --> 00:52:46.700]   Plus, as we just heard this nice young woman talk about spreading in Vanguard, all these
[00:52:46.700 --> 00:52:51.700]   Vogel head sites are set up almost like the way a religion is spread in the early days.
[00:52:51.700 --> 00:52:55.580]   So I think that'll all help, which brings me to the Vogel head's quote from Jack.
[00:52:55.580 --> 00:52:57.980]   I use it because you guys are here.
[00:52:57.980 --> 00:52:58.980]   He loves you guys.
[00:52:58.980 --> 00:53:04.740]   I mean, if you listen to the first episode of Vogel head's podcast, he goes on and says
[00:53:04.740 --> 00:53:07.940]   about how big of a service the Vogel heads have been.
[00:53:07.940 --> 00:53:11.660]   I find it interesting, sometimes Vanguard isn't hot on the Vogel heads, and there's
[00:53:11.660 --> 00:53:13.940]   a gap formed between you guys.
[00:53:13.940 --> 00:53:16.900]   And again, that was another reason I chose to go with the Vogel effect versus the Vanguard
[00:53:16.900 --> 00:53:23.420]   effect, because I think Vogelism is actually much bigger than Vanguard, the company, and
[00:53:23.420 --> 00:53:26.540]   Vogel heads are a big part of that.
[00:53:26.540 --> 00:53:28.820]   I'll leave you with this.
[00:53:28.820 --> 00:53:32.220]   Everything I just described helps half the country.
[00:53:32.220 --> 00:53:35.780]   Only 50% of people are invested in stocks.
[00:53:35.780 --> 00:53:38.260]   The bottom 50% have no exposure.
[00:53:38.260 --> 00:53:39.700]   They do not get the Vogel effect.
[00:53:39.700 --> 00:53:42.820]   So at the end, I sort of say, this is sort of the next.
[00:53:42.820 --> 00:53:46.900]   Everyone should step up and in Vogel spirit, help this.
[00:53:46.900 --> 00:53:53.420]   I do say if they come up with a plan to get the underserved into the stock market, they
[00:53:53.420 --> 00:53:55.780]   have a great tool awaiting them when they start.
[00:53:55.780 --> 00:53:56.980]   So at least there's that.
[00:53:56.980 --> 00:54:01.940]   But anyway, that's sort of the way I leave the book at the end.
[00:54:01.940 --> 00:54:05.260]   And with that, I will conclude the presentation and say, thank you for your time, turn it
[00:54:05.260 --> 00:54:06.260]   back to Gauri.
[00:54:06.260 --> 00:54:07.260]   Fantastic.
[00:54:07.260 --> 00:54:08.500]   Thanks so much, Eric.
[00:54:08.500 --> 00:54:10.420]   That was phenomenal.
[00:54:10.420 --> 00:54:14.240]   In the interest of time, so I have a few questions that I'm dying to ask you, but I also want
[00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:16.760]   to turn it over to the audience.
[00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:23.540]   So if we could turn this into semi-speed round, and if you feel the questions, just there's
[00:54:23.540 --> 00:54:26.220]   not that much there, we can move on to the next one.
[00:54:26.220 --> 00:54:32.300]   So you mentioned that the book was, in a separate talk, you mentioned that the book was originally
[00:54:32.300 --> 00:54:33.820]   600 pages.
[00:54:33.820 --> 00:54:38.020]   What did you find toughest to cut from the book that got cut?
[00:54:38.020 --> 00:54:43.580]   Oh, I cut a whole chapter, which is called The Game of Basis Points.
[00:54:43.580 --> 00:54:46.340]   I studied the art of passive management.
[00:54:46.340 --> 00:54:51.260]   You know these people who make sure that the index fund tracks the benchmark?
[00:54:51.260 --> 00:54:55.340]   What they do every day is actually that they actually provide hundreds of millions of dollars
[00:54:55.340 --> 00:55:00.100]   in value to investors by securities lending, which allows you to make up a basis point.
[00:55:00.100 --> 00:55:06.820]   So the Vanguard Total Market Fund is three basis points, but really it's only one basis
[00:55:06.820 --> 00:55:10.980]   point of tracking difference, because the two basis points you get in a rebate.
[00:55:10.980 --> 00:55:16.320]   So I just wanted to explore that, and I thought it was an unsung area, but everybody I showed
[00:55:16.320 --> 00:55:20.980]   the book to was like, "This is too boring, it's just too wonky, I don't care."
[00:55:20.980 --> 00:55:25.900]   And so I ended up, I whittled it down, and I just cut the whole thing.
[00:55:25.900 --> 00:55:31.980]   That was probably the toughest to cut, because it was literally like 25 pages, and I spent
[00:55:31.980 --> 00:55:35.460]   a lot of time on it, and just, you know, had to hack it.
[00:55:35.460 --> 00:55:41.620]   So that's why I give the book to regular people, like my mom, and not just nerds.
[00:55:41.620 --> 00:55:44.500]   Got it, makes sense.
[00:55:44.500 --> 00:55:49.900]   And so I'll just squeeze in another plug for the book, just that it is not a cheerleading
[00:55:49.900 --> 00:55:51.820]   book about Jack.
[00:55:51.820 --> 00:55:55.140]   It's balanced, it's objective, it's factual, there's a lot of data in there, there are
[00:55:55.140 --> 00:56:03.940]   a lot of personalities commenting, both pro and not necessarily our icon, but it's a story
[00:56:03.940 --> 00:56:06.140]   well told, and it's not all positive.
[00:56:06.140 --> 00:56:09.060]   So thanks, Eric, for keeping it balanced.
[00:56:09.060 --> 00:56:10.060]   Next question.
[00:56:10.060 --> 00:56:16.340]   You write about how Jack wore frumpy clothes, and this is not surprising, like a sort of
[00:56:16.340 --> 00:56:18.820]   Warren Buffett personality.
[00:56:18.820 --> 00:56:22.300]   He flew coach when possible, not first class.
[00:56:22.300 --> 00:56:26.220]   He enjoyed saving over spending.
[00:56:26.220 --> 00:56:32.540]   Can you talk about how Jack's personality type and personal concept of enough contributed
[00:56:32.540 --> 00:56:37.260]   so significantly to Vanguard's unique structure in that space?
[00:56:37.260 --> 00:56:45.740]   Yeah, well, and to your point, I did show Jack's blemishes, including while he was immune
[00:56:45.740 --> 00:56:51.180]   seemingly to greed and money, like most people who go to Wall Street, and he wrote the book
[00:56:51.180 --> 00:56:57.060]   Enough, which was about that, after talking to people, I realized what filled him, because
[00:56:57.060 --> 00:57:02.100]   we all have a void inside that we need to fill, was adulation.
[00:57:02.100 --> 00:57:06.820]   He could never get enough, and his kids were even like, he would stop and talk to a doorman
[00:57:06.820 --> 00:57:12.220]   for like 15 minutes on vacation and stuff, and he loved it.
[00:57:12.220 --> 00:57:14.500]   And so we all have different needs.
[00:57:14.500 --> 00:57:19.100]   He just didn't have the need of money and power, which was what draws most people to
[00:57:19.100 --> 00:57:20.100]   Wall Street.
[00:57:20.100 --> 00:57:25.620]   And that character, I think, was important because Vanguard's mutual ownership structure
[00:57:25.620 --> 00:57:29.580]   obviously turned over all the future profits to the investors.
[00:57:29.580 --> 00:57:34.740]   No normal Wall Street titan would ever do that, and so you had to have a unique character
[00:57:34.740 --> 00:57:40.940]   do that, and that's why Bogle deserves all the credit, really, for this.
[00:57:40.940 --> 00:57:44.420]   Let's say there was a circumstance where somebody else created a mutual.
[00:57:44.420 --> 00:57:47.660]   I'm not sure they would have championed it or hung with it that long if they were the
[00:57:47.660 --> 00:57:51.900]   kind of person who was going to work 12 hours a day and be a good manager of people and
[00:57:51.900 --> 00:57:57.780]   build this huge asset manager, but he did it, and it's just an amazing story.
[00:57:57.780 --> 00:58:00.060]   He ended up with $80 million, which is not bad.
[00:58:00.060 --> 00:58:05.740]   I mean, a house at Lake Placid, so he wasn't poor, and nobody at Vanguard is.
[00:58:05.740 --> 00:58:08.820]   I think when people get confused, it's like people at Vanguard don't live in the woods
[00:58:08.820 --> 00:58:10.900]   and eat bugs.
[00:58:10.900 --> 00:58:15.340]   They make decent money, but nobody's getting like Ned Johnson rich.
[00:58:15.340 --> 00:58:19.180]   Nobody's getting Jeff Bezos rich because the owners are the investors, whereas in those
[00:58:19.180 --> 00:58:23.380]   cases they're the owners, and you can see how much their wealth blooms beyond anything
[00:58:23.380 --> 00:58:27.420]   they could possibly spend in their lifetime, and I think people really respond to that.
[00:58:27.420 --> 00:58:32.260]   An interesting anecdote on that, when I interviewed Michael Lewis about the book, he said, "How
[00:58:32.260 --> 00:58:35.540]   much did Bogle end up with in his net worth?"
[00:58:35.540 --> 00:58:40.900]   And I said, "80 million," and he said, "Oh, my God," he goes, "I almost fell off my chair.
[00:58:40.900 --> 00:58:45.100]   I thought you were going to say a couple billion, and even then I was going to say he left so
[00:58:45.100 --> 00:58:47.100]   much money on the table."
[00:58:47.100 --> 00:58:50.820]   That's when he gave me the quote of the book, because he's Michael Lewis, he's better at
[00:58:50.820 --> 00:58:51.820]   words than I am.
[00:58:51.820 --> 00:58:57.860]   He said, "Never in the history of Wall Street has so much money been touched, but so little
[00:58:57.860 --> 00:58:59.740]   kept."
[00:58:59.740 --> 00:59:05.540]   That gap, that ratio is just ridiculously off the charts.
[00:59:05.540 --> 00:59:09.380]   So yeah, I think Bogle's structure and discipline deserves a lot of credit, and there was many
[00:59:09.380 --> 00:59:14.580]   times early in the Vanguard story where they denied money because it was short-term traders.
[00:59:14.580 --> 00:59:20.740]   Always protecting of the little investor early on, it prolonged Vanguard's success.
[00:59:20.740 --> 00:59:25.580]   So I try to tell people who read this book, it's kind of a cool book about if you do the
[00:59:25.580 --> 00:59:30.420]   hard road, it may take a long time, but when it finally hits, it will have real staying
[00:59:30.420 --> 00:59:31.420]   power.
[00:59:31.420 --> 00:59:32.420]   It won't be like a gimmick.
[00:59:32.420 --> 00:59:33.420]   Okay.
[00:59:33.420 --> 00:59:34.420]   Fantastic.
[00:59:34.420 --> 00:59:40.220]   Building on that, and also, Eric, the screen that I see is a red or orange.
[00:59:40.220 --> 00:59:45.740]   If you unshare your deck, we might have you back on camera.
[00:59:45.740 --> 00:59:47.060]   I'm not sure that'll solve it.
[00:59:47.060 --> 00:59:48.060]   Hold on.
[00:59:48.060 --> 00:59:49.060]   I did a screen share.
[00:59:49.060 --> 00:59:51.060]   Let me share it and then unshare it again.
[00:59:51.060 --> 00:59:52.060]   Okay.
[00:59:52.060 --> 00:59:53.800]   I had that and then I hear a stop share.
[00:59:53.800 --> 00:59:54.800]   It goes to red for me.
[00:59:54.800 --> 00:59:55.800]   I don't know why.
[00:59:55.800 --> 00:59:56.800]   Okay.
[00:59:56.800 --> 00:59:57.800]   Yeah.
[00:59:57.800 --> 00:59:58.800]   I saw you for a second there.
[00:59:58.800 --> 00:59:59.800]   Okay.
[00:59:59.800 --> 01:00:00.800]   We can live with that.
[01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:07.060]   So building on that, there are plenty of phenomenal founder leaders who build phenomenal companies
[01:00:07.060 --> 01:00:14.020]   during their oversight and then things change dramatically for the worse often when they
[01:00:14.020 --> 01:00:15.020]   depart.
[01:00:15.020 --> 01:00:16.020]   In Vanguard's case, it's different.
[01:00:16.020 --> 01:00:23.220]   We know there was management shakeup, but in terms of what Jack ingrained in the crew
[01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:29.780]   that would sustain for decades, this commitment to keeping costs low beyond operating costs
[01:00:29.780 --> 01:00:35.660]   and mutual ownership, can you comment on how Vanguard incentivizes keeping costs low?
[01:00:35.660 --> 01:00:38.340]   Like you said, folks are decently paid.
[01:00:38.340 --> 01:00:41.800]   Is there a bonus structure to reward keeping costs low?
[01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:42.800]   Things like that.
[01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:47.940]   Yes, there is, which can be tough if you work there.
[01:00:47.940 --> 01:00:53.800]   I think he's had several cases where the employees felt like they were being too altruistic and
[01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:54.800]   they wanted money.
[01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:55.800]   They could make money more elsewhere.
[01:00:55.800 --> 01:00:59.340]   So there's a Vanguard partnership plan, which does very well.
[01:00:59.340 --> 01:01:03.860]   There was one report that outperformed the S&P 500, which is kind of ironic.
[01:01:03.860 --> 01:01:08.380]   So people have different ways to sort of get over that, but yeah, they are more incentivized
[01:01:08.380 --> 01:01:09.660]   to keep costs low.
[01:01:09.660 --> 01:01:11.820]   I personally think it's enough.
[01:01:11.820 --> 01:01:14.980]   If I was running Vanguard, I would stop with the low cost thing.
[01:01:14.980 --> 01:01:16.580]   It's all low enough.
[01:01:16.580 --> 01:01:17.840]   We're good.
[01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:22.740]   Put all future profits that would have otherwise gone to low cost to customer service because
[01:01:22.740 --> 01:01:23.940]   that's their Achilles heel.
[01:01:23.940 --> 01:01:27.220]   This is why Vogel didn't want Vanguard to get so big.
[01:01:27.220 --> 01:01:32.860]   He thought we'll stop seeing our people as like human souls who have wants and needs
[01:01:32.860 --> 01:01:36.260]   and we'll just see them as just like 30 million numbers.
[01:01:36.260 --> 01:01:37.380]   And that's sort of what's happening.
[01:01:37.380 --> 01:01:38.380]   It's unfortunate.
[01:01:38.380 --> 01:01:41.700]   But even with that, they're still growing because of all of the goodwill.
[01:01:41.700 --> 01:01:43.420]   But that's what I would do if I ran the place.
[01:01:43.420 --> 01:01:49.780]   I would actually change the incentive system away from the low cost because it's done.
[01:01:49.780 --> 01:01:50.880]   Everybody's happy.
[01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:54.460]   Move to customer service and let's spend money there.
[01:01:54.460 --> 01:02:01.340]   So I'm not totally sure how you can get the people to sort of vote that up or maybe I'm
[01:02:01.340 --> 01:02:04.940]   alone and they really just want lower costs to be on three basis points.
[01:02:04.940 --> 01:02:06.180]   But I would do that.
[01:02:06.180 --> 01:02:08.500]   But yeah, the whole culture is designed around that.
[01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:11.740]   And you read the early speeches and character counts.
[01:02:11.740 --> 01:02:12.740]   That's really what he talks about.
[01:02:12.740 --> 01:02:17.420]   In fact, I have this funny split screen image of December 1987.
[01:02:17.420 --> 01:02:20.980]   That's the year Wall Street came out, the movie.
[01:02:20.980 --> 01:02:26.500]   There was people in audiences all over America watching Gordon Gekko's "Greed is Good" speech.
[01:02:26.500 --> 01:02:32.420]   And it inspired all these young traders to get into the market and become masters of
[01:02:32.420 --> 01:02:33.420]   the universe.
[01:02:33.420 --> 01:02:41.420]   And meanwhile, out in Malvern, the same month, maybe even the same day, you have Bogle talking
[01:02:41.420 --> 01:02:45.340]   about cutting a basis point off the fund and if we're good stewards and hang around, we
[01:02:45.340 --> 01:02:46.340]   should have success.
[01:02:46.340 --> 01:02:51.740]   And it was such a boring, wholesome speech compared to what was happening in the 80s.
[01:02:51.740 --> 01:02:55.500]   And I do give Vanguard, the employees and Bogle credit.
[01:02:55.500 --> 01:02:59.220]   It's easier to do all this now because it's kind of cool and in fashion.
[01:02:59.220 --> 01:03:05.740]   But in the 80s, it was way more normal to party and be decadent and then have the crash.
[01:03:05.740 --> 01:03:07.580]   And even the 90s were kind of decadent.
[01:03:07.580 --> 01:03:14.580]   And Bogle just was able to tunnel vision this idea and not have any of the cycles mess with
[01:03:14.580 --> 01:03:20.740]   his mind, which again, unusual and way ahead of its time.
[01:03:20.740 --> 01:03:22.860]   Okay, great.
[01:03:22.860 --> 01:03:27.780]   So I'll try to squeeze in two more questions and then we'll turn it over to the audience.
[01:03:27.780 --> 01:03:35.300]   This one will involve sort of your personal and professional, maybe evolution.
[01:03:35.300 --> 01:03:42.260]   Given you were well-informed about the fundamentals of investing, how did your many hours with
[01:03:42.260 --> 01:03:48.220]   Jack and the folks you spoke with affect you personally and professionally, either investing
[01:03:48.220 --> 01:03:53.060]   outlook approach or values, principles, things like that?
[01:03:53.060 --> 01:03:54.220]   Sure.
[01:03:54.220 --> 01:03:55.620]   I'm back on screen now, right?
[01:03:55.620 --> 01:03:56.620]   Yes.
[01:03:56.620 --> 01:03:58.860]   So I'm going to share my screen just so you can see me.
[01:03:58.860 --> 01:04:00.340]   Is that worth it?
[01:04:00.340 --> 01:04:01.340]   Yeah.
[01:04:01.340 --> 01:04:02.340]   Okay.
[01:04:02.340 --> 01:04:03.340]   Yeah.
[01:04:03.340 --> 01:04:04.340]   Thank you.
[01:04:04.340 --> 01:04:05.340]   Yeah.
[01:04:05.340 --> 01:04:12.340]   Like I said, there's something about Jack that is like just eating a ton of broccoli
[01:04:12.340 --> 01:04:15.180]   or this feels like, right.
[01:04:15.180 --> 01:04:21.940]   He's not serving you like sugar or he's giving you the real deal and you feel it when you're
[01:04:21.940 --> 01:04:22.940]   with them.
[01:04:22.940 --> 01:04:24.780]   I liked his sense of humor.
[01:04:24.780 --> 01:04:31.900]   I also enjoyed, I thought, I was amazed at how good he was at separating what you did
[01:04:31.900 --> 01:04:33.660]   with the person you were.
[01:04:33.660 --> 01:04:38.860]   Because remember, he was pretty savage towards everything and everybody in terms of their
[01:04:38.860 --> 01:04:39.860]   livelihood.
[01:04:39.860 --> 01:04:44.020]   Active ETFs, it's my whole livelihood is ETFs and he would dump on them.
[01:04:44.020 --> 01:04:47.980]   But I could tell he generally enjoyed me as a person and vice versa.
[01:04:47.980 --> 01:04:51.620]   I also found it interesting when I was seeing him in the first meeting, he invited me to
[01:04:51.620 --> 01:04:52.620]   lunch.
[01:04:52.620 --> 01:04:57.660]   We go out to the lunch hall there and everybody's like, "Oh, hi, Mr. Bogle."
[01:04:57.660 --> 01:05:02.060]   And he's moving real slow, but eventually gets into the cafeteria, goes right in the
[01:05:02.060 --> 01:05:03.060]   middle.
[01:05:03.060 --> 01:05:07.580]   I mean, he must've brought the average age in that cafeteria down to about 32, right?
[01:05:07.580 --> 01:05:10.980]   It's just him and a bunch of young people and he doesn't care.
[01:05:10.980 --> 01:05:16.860]   And I don't know many CEOs that would be that open to just walk right into the main place.
[01:05:16.860 --> 01:05:19.980]   They're usually in their private room and if they see somebody, it's all orchestrated
[01:05:19.980 --> 01:05:20.980]   and scripted.
[01:05:20.980 --> 01:05:23.380]   They walk around the office and they're scurried off.
[01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:26.140]   He had no handlers.
[01:05:26.140 --> 01:05:27.840]   He was just out there.
[01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:30.340]   I will always remember that.
[01:05:30.340 --> 01:05:32.180]   Nobody is better than anybody else.
[01:05:32.180 --> 01:05:37.340]   I think he was genuinely felt like among the people.
[01:05:37.340 --> 01:05:44.820]   I do think he thought he was a legendary figure, but in terms of, I don't think his ego really
[01:05:44.820 --> 01:05:47.140]   let him separate himself from humanity.
[01:05:47.140 --> 01:05:52.740]   I think he was right there and he loved the investors at Vanguard.
[01:05:52.740 --> 01:05:53.740]   Those would be my things.
[01:05:53.740 --> 01:05:57.980]   I also, one of the things he did that you don't see anymore is the art of letter writing.
[01:05:57.980 --> 01:06:01.860]   It used to be you'd write these nice letters to people, thank you cards.
[01:06:01.860 --> 01:06:05.820]   "Oh, I saw your article and here's my take on it."
[01:06:05.820 --> 01:06:06.820]   Nice email.
[01:06:06.820 --> 01:06:08.380]   He did that all the time.
[01:06:08.380 --> 01:06:11.340]   I really didn't know that well, but he did that on multiple occasions with me.
[01:06:11.340 --> 01:06:14.500]   Then I interviewed people and I realized he did it with everybody.
[01:06:14.500 --> 01:06:17.740]   There was a guy who was a Bogle scholar who became a musician.
[01:06:17.740 --> 01:06:19.860]   Bogle asked for him to send his CD.
[01:06:19.860 --> 01:06:27.580]   He listened to it and gave this three-paragraph review of the CD, even though he's into opera.
[01:06:27.580 --> 01:06:29.820]   This email was not meant to see the light of day.
[01:06:29.820 --> 01:06:35.420]   I reprinted it in my book, but I'm like taking that time after you've done all that in your
[01:06:35.420 --> 01:06:38.500]   life, it's pretty cool.
[01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:44.260]   It's those little things, I think, that really go a long way, that influenced me is that.
[01:06:44.260 --> 01:06:47.660]   Now my personal portfolio, yeah, I'm fully passive.
[01:06:47.660 --> 01:06:50.860]   It's too strong of a value proposition.
[01:06:50.860 --> 01:06:55.780]   That said, my wife, she loves to invest in really beat up value stocks.
[01:06:55.780 --> 01:07:00.860]   She'd be like, she's the kind of person who goes, "GE is trading at $7, should we buy
[01:07:00.860 --> 01:07:01.860]   some?"
[01:07:01.860 --> 01:07:03.180]   We do a little of that.
[01:07:03.180 --> 01:07:08.060]   Every now and then I get caught up in a flyer, like I bought the Bitcoin ETF, right at the
[01:07:08.060 --> 01:07:09.060]   top.
[01:07:09.060 --> 01:07:10.060]   That's your hot sauce.
[01:07:10.060 --> 01:07:11.060]   Yeah, that's my hot sauce.
[01:07:11.060 --> 01:07:13.300]   Largely, I'm happy with Borg.
[01:07:13.300 --> 01:07:16.860]   I've seen the numbers and I know I'm in the right place.
[01:07:16.860 --> 01:07:17.860]   Great.
[01:07:17.860 --> 01:07:22.900]   My last question, I have a bunch more that I'd like to ask, but we do need to switch
[01:07:22.900 --> 01:07:23.900]   it over.
[01:07:23.900 --> 01:07:28.300]   Last one for me for now, switching to Vanguard in the broader space.
[01:07:28.300 --> 01:07:35.180]   It's clear Vanguard's maturing relative to its younger self, but they have a lot of runway
[01:07:35.180 --> 01:07:36.180]   in the US.
[01:07:36.180 --> 01:07:41.260]   Can you talk about the challenges they face internationally and whether that varies by
[01:07:41.260 --> 01:07:44.980]   country and where you see Vanguard in that space in the future?
[01:07:44.980 --> 01:07:47.060]   Yeah, it's what I said earlier.
[01:07:47.060 --> 01:07:52.660]   The plumbing over there, it's more like the US in the '80s and '90s where a broker gets
[01:07:52.660 --> 01:07:56.220]   a kickback from mutual funds or the bank.
[01:07:56.220 --> 01:08:00.180]   People have one bank they've been going through for like 18 generations and the bank gets
[01:08:00.180 --> 01:08:06.500]   a kickback and people there, if you ask them, you're paying 2%, they're like, "Okay."
[01:08:06.500 --> 01:08:11.900]   Here you go crazy over two basis points, they're at 2%, no big deal.
[01:08:11.900 --> 01:08:14.820]   A lot more has to get out.
[01:08:14.820 --> 01:08:16.700]   They are getting ripped off.
[01:08:16.700 --> 01:08:17.700]   I think it will.
[01:08:17.700 --> 01:08:22.260]   The numbers are showing a decline, I mean, an incline in passive assets, but it just
[01:08:22.260 --> 01:08:23.260]   takes a while.
[01:08:23.260 --> 01:08:29.780]   I think the ultimate thing you need to see first is the move from brokers to advisors,
[01:08:29.780 --> 01:08:32.580]   from the suitability to the fiduciary model.
[01:08:32.580 --> 01:08:38.340]   Once that switch is over, the rest will fall in place because the intermediaries will be
[01:08:38.340 --> 01:08:40.260]   shoulder to shoulder with their own clients.
[01:08:40.260 --> 01:08:44.700]   Of course, they're going to pick the cheap ones, they know, they're not dumb.
[01:08:44.700 --> 01:08:46.180]   I think that's what we're looking at.
[01:08:46.180 --> 01:08:52.660]   I track that percentage of broker to fiduciary because to me, this pretty much informs where
[01:08:52.660 --> 01:08:53.660]   we'll see passive go.
[01:08:53.660 --> 01:08:58.020]   This is why in many countries, ETFs are big with institutions, but not yet retail.
[01:08:58.020 --> 01:09:00.660]   Okay, thanks for that.
[01:09:00.660 --> 01:09:01.660]   Excellent.
[01:09:01.660 --> 01:09:04.580]   Miriam, turn it over to you.
[01:09:04.580 --> 01:09:05.580]   Thank you.
[01:09:05.580 --> 01:09:06.580]   Thank you, Eric.
[01:09:06.580 --> 01:09:07.580]   What a nice presentation.
[01:09:07.580 --> 01:09:09.700]   Very interesting.
[01:09:09.700 --> 01:09:10.780]   I do have a question.
[01:09:10.780 --> 01:09:16.620]   I did notice that your dedication in your book was to your grandparents and the rest
[01:09:16.620 --> 01:09:20.900]   of the World War II generation.
[01:09:20.900 --> 01:09:25.460]   As we know, Jack Bogle and Taylor Laramore were part of that generation.
[01:09:25.460 --> 01:09:34.020]   Taylor moved to Miami when his parents and grandparents lost everything up in the Northeast.
[01:09:34.020 --> 01:09:43.900]   Is it possible, and also John Bogle was intensely interested in American history.
[01:09:43.900 --> 01:09:50.300]   Do you think that it is possible that his past and his interest in American history
[01:09:50.300 --> 01:09:57.780]   and his generation has spilled over into his views of international stock investing?
[01:09:57.780 --> 01:10:03.140]   Where he thinks that we really don't need international, you can stick with an American
[01:10:03.140 --> 01:10:04.140]   stock portfolio.
[01:10:04.140 --> 01:10:06.740]   That's a good question.
[01:10:06.740 --> 01:10:07.740]   Maybe.
[01:10:07.740 --> 01:10:15.660]   I think he just looked at the numbers and said, okay, 40% of the revenue from S&P 500
[01:10:15.660 --> 01:10:18.740]   stocks comes from international anyway.
[01:10:18.740 --> 01:10:20.560]   It's all linked together.
[01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:25.120]   Like Buffett, we know that American innovation is almost peerless.
[01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:29.220]   Is there really a point to add international?
[01:10:29.220 --> 01:10:37.140]   The same reason that investors are just content to pay 2% in Europe is also the same reason
[01:10:37.140 --> 01:10:41.740]   I think you don't see Amazons and Apples coming out of Europe.
[01:10:41.740 --> 01:10:47.700]   They're just not that motivated, I think in general.
[01:10:47.700 --> 01:10:50.180]   Europe is a special place, not to say they're not good companies elsewhere.
[01:10:50.180 --> 01:10:55.660]   This is why ESG, in my opinion, is much easier in Europe than here, because you don't have
[01:10:55.660 --> 01:11:00.340]   to worry about missing out on an Apple, Amazon, or Tesla, one of these companies that changes
[01:11:00.340 --> 01:11:02.980]   the world in intense innovation.
[01:11:02.980 --> 01:11:07.980]   I would argue he has a point, but again, most people I talked to thought they wanted international
[01:11:07.980 --> 01:11:08.980]   just in case.
[01:11:08.980 --> 01:11:17.060]   As Dan Egan of Betterment said, "Rome fell," which means it's possible America has a decline
[01:11:17.060 --> 01:11:19.980]   and you want to be diversified.
[01:11:19.980 --> 01:11:21.780]   But I see his point.
[01:11:21.780 --> 01:11:25.020]   If you had done nothing but international since when he said that, you'd actually be
[01:11:25.020 --> 01:11:27.820]   in a better place today.
[01:11:27.820 --> 01:11:30.540]   I can't guarantee that going forward, but you would have been in a better place.
[01:11:30.540 --> 01:11:32.300]   He kind of was right.
[01:11:32.300 --> 01:11:37.700]   I don't know if it was his World War II upbringing that caused that and maybe he was a little
[01:11:37.700 --> 01:11:39.620]   more patriotic than people today.
[01:11:39.620 --> 01:11:40.620]   I don't know.
[01:11:40.620 --> 01:11:42.660]   It's a good question.
[01:11:42.660 --> 01:11:48.860]   I think the World War II thing more informed his character in terms of not getting too
[01:11:48.860 --> 01:11:56.980]   high on himself, wearing the same khakis for 40 years, being thrifty, being patriotic,
[01:11:56.980 --> 01:12:08.420]   liking history, just having that nuclear family kind of thing, his wit.
[01:12:08.420 --> 01:12:17.820]   I remember when I asked him about when he talked about thematic ETFs, he'd call it the
[01:12:17.820 --> 01:12:23.860]   lunatic fringe or fruit cases and nut cakes or something.
[01:12:23.860 --> 01:12:28.920]   His language around some of this stuff was really funny and I thought that was partially
[01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:33.620]   because my grandfather, I remember he used to say, "Son, if you had a brain, you'd be
[01:12:33.620 --> 01:12:40.960]   dangerous," or, "Go take a 20-foot walk off a 10-foot pier," or, "Go play in traffic."
[01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:44.900]   There was a certain savagery to the wit that I felt Bogle shared as well.
[01:12:44.900 --> 01:12:50.020]   He just applied it to the stuff in the investing world and I thought it was fun.
[01:12:50.020 --> 01:12:54.300]   I think part of why I couldn't find anybody to really talk too much trash about him because
[01:12:54.300 --> 01:12:59.860]   even when I said, "Look, Bogle said this about your neck of the woods," they'd be like, "Yeah,
[01:12:59.860 --> 01:13:01.580]   it's just Jack being Jack.
[01:13:01.580 --> 01:13:03.060]   I love him anyway."
[01:13:03.060 --> 01:13:07.540]   There was something about that wit where I knew my grandfather did not love me, but it's
[01:13:07.540 --> 01:13:09.380]   just funny.
[01:13:09.380 --> 01:13:11.300]   I think some of that is lost today.
[01:13:11.300 --> 01:13:15.740]   People are a little too sensitive and not as creative when they're funny.
[01:13:15.740 --> 01:13:19.860]   Those would be some of the things I think the World War II generation instilled in him.
[01:13:19.860 --> 01:13:21.780]   I don't know if the international thing is related.
[01:13:21.780 --> 01:13:22.780]   Maybe.
[01:13:22.780 --> 01:13:25.940]   Kip, do you have a question?
[01:13:25.940 --> 01:13:27.940]   I do, Eric.
[01:13:27.940 --> 01:13:28.940]   Thank you so very much.
[01:13:28.940 --> 01:13:32.580]   That was a great presentation and very entertaining.
[01:13:32.580 --> 01:13:36.380]   I have to say, I hope your book would make a great Netflix special.
[01:13:36.380 --> 01:13:38.540]   Sadly, I don't know anybody at Netflix.
[01:13:38.540 --> 01:13:43.620]   If it does become a Netflix special, you need to be in it because you're a very entertaining
[01:13:43.620 --> 01:13:44.620]   public speaker.
[01:13:44.620 --> 01:13:45.620]   It's really refreshing.
[01:13:45.620 --> 01:13:46.620]   Thank you.
[01:13:46.620 --> 01:13:49.500]   My question is this.
[01:13:49.500 --> 01:13:55.020]   You talked about how Vanguard will dominate the future, but they were the disruptor of
[01:13:55.020 --> 01:14:00.260]   their time, arguably they still are a disruptor now, but we can all look what's going on with
[01:14:00.260 --> 01:14:03.780]   Facebook and Meta and all this stuff.
[01:14:03.780 --> 01:14:05.260]   What might be coming next?
[01:14:05.260 --> 01:14:15.020]   For example, in terms of robo-investing, the role of AI, I guess on the technology side,
[01:14:15.020 --> 01:14:19.700]   it just feels as though there's so much coming so quickly.
[01:14:19.700 --> 01:14:28.860]   Can you opine a little bit on Vanguard's role in that and do you get the sense that Vanguard
[01:14:28.860 --> 01:14:31.020]   is positioned for that?
[01:14:31.020 --> 01:14:32.020]   Yes.
[01:14:32.020 --> 01:14:36.540]   This is where I think you should be happy that other people were running Vanguard because
[01:14:36.540 --> 01:14:39.020]   I don't think Jack would have done a lot of this stuff.
[01:14:39.020 --> 01:14:40.500]   I don't think he would have launched DTS.
[01:14:40.500 --> 01:14:41.500]   We know he wouldn't have.
[01:14:41.500 --> 01:14:44.460]   He wouldn't have launched the advisory service.
[01:14:44.460 --> 01:14:49.380]   Maybe he would have done it for special cases or something, but he didn't want to get bigger.
[01:14:49.380 --> 01:14:51.100]   I think what Vanguard's doing is smart.
[01:14:51.100 --> 01:14:52.100]   They're vertically integrating.
[01:14:52.100 --> 01:14:57.500]   They'll give you the digital robo, the full service advisor, the ETFs, the funds.
[01:14:57.500 --> 01:14:59.580]   BlackRock does the same thing.
[01:14:59.580 --> 01:15:03.480]   We're going to find a couple of vertically integrated companies that will do anything
[01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:04.480]   you want.
[01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:05.900]   They bought a direct indexing platform.
[01:15:05.900 --> 01:15:07.820]   I think direct indexing is overrated.
[01:15:07.820 --> 01:15:11.180]   That's where you all get your own separate account and you pick out stocks based on your
[01:15:11.180 --> 01:15:12.180]   values.
[01:15:12.180 --> 01:15:18.140]   It's so overrated because it's active management in disguise and the tax efficiency is overrated.
[01:15:18.140 --> 01:15:24.380]   Most people don't really need customization.
[01:15:24.380 --> 01:15:27.100]   You could arguably customize your portfolio using ETFs right now.
[01:15:27.100 --> 01:15:28.820]   They're pretty specific.
[01:15:28.820 --> 01:15:33.260]   I think that's overrated, but the fact that Vanguard bought a DI platform shows you they're
[01:15:33.260 --> 01:15:36.940]   ready in case technology does change it quickly.
[01:15:36.940 --> 01:15:42.780]   They also are going into the private equity area because they know that the number of
[01:15:42.780 --> 01:15:45.540]   public stocks has declined over the last 10 years.
[01:15:45.540 --> 01:15:46.980]   There's only 4,000 public stocks.
[01:15:46.980 --> 01:15:48.820]   They're worth 7,000.
[01:15:48.820 --> 01:15:49.820]   Companies are going public less.
[01:15:49.820 --> 01:15:51.940]   They don't want the headache and stuff.
[01:15:51.940 --> 01:15:56.820]   That is probably good because if you're an investor who wants a diversified portfolio,
[01:15:56.820 --> 01:16:02.020]   you may want a slice of PE because that is capturing American capitalism.
[01:16:02.020 --> 01:16:04.620]   Again, this is Vanguard.
[01:16:04.620 --> 01:16:08.500]   The company, you're going to see them do all this and try to keep up all of this.
[01:16:08.500 --> 01:16:13.340]   Some of the bogleheads are going to go, "That's not my Vanguard," but to your point, would
[01:16:13.340 --> 01:16:18.900]   you rather them not do it and not have the Vanguard effect going into private equity?
[01:16:18.900 --> 01:16:22.100]   Maybe private equity needs a little boggle effect there.
[01:16:22.100 --> 01:16:27.420]   It's a complicated topic, but I do think technology will make things easier, but at the end of
[01:16:27.420 --> 01:16:34.700]   the day, even if technology happened, technology would have happened regardless, but I still
[01:16:34.700 --> 01:16:40.420]   do not think we're anywhere near three basis point portfolios without boggle and the Vanguard
[01:16:40.420 --> 01:16:41.420]   effect.
[01:16:41.420 --> 01:16:47.300]   The low cost, I think, almost should be entirely attributed to him, but technology certainly
[01:16:47.300 --> 01:16:48.540]   is going to continue to change things.
[01:16:48.540 --> 01:16:54.820]   I just think we're far away from tokenization or even at the direct indexing concept.
[01:16:54.820 --> 01:16:58.780]   I think people are very happy to have five funds in their portfolio.
[01:16:58.780 --> 01:17:00.500]   It's very simple.
[01:17:00.500 --> 01:17:02.220]   I'll outsource all of that stuff to them.
[01:17:02.220 --> 01:17:05.060]   It's a great deal for the cost.
[01:17:05.060 --> 01:17:07.060]   I just think we're going to be here for a long time.
[01:17:07.060 --> 01:17:10.020]   Some people try to look for the next thing that's going to disrupt, but I'm like, "Wait
[01:17:10.020 --> 01:17:11.020]   a second.
[01:17:11.020 --> 01:17:13.900]   ETFs hung around for a hundred years."
[01:17:13.900 --> 01:17:21.180]   ETFs and low cost, like I said, funds didn't get below 10 basis points until 10 years ago.
[01:17:21.180 --> 01:17:27.580]   I would say the cheap beta is going to last 50, 80 years at least in the form probably
[01:17:27.580 --> 01:17:29.540]   of the ETF.
[01:17:29.540 --> 01:17:34.380]   I would say the disrupting that they're doing is just getting started.
[01:17:34.380 --> 01:17:37.460]   I don't know if there's really much else to disrupt for a while.
[01:17:37.460 --> 01:17:38.660]   I think we're in a good spot.
[01:17:38.660 --> 01:17:42.460]   I think how they're able to get information to you and how you're able to look at your
[01:17:42.460 --> 01:17:45.820]   portfolio, I think will become easier and easier though, and more convenient through
[01:17:45.820 --> 01:17:46.820]   technology.
[01:17:46.820 --> 01:17:47.820]   Thank you so much, Eric.
[01:17:47.820 --> 01:17:49.340]   Again, it's a privilege to have you with us.
[01:17:49.340 --> 01:17:50.340]   Thank you.
[01:17:50.340 --> 01:17:51.340]   Great job.
[01:17:51.340 --> 01:17:52.340]   Thank you.
[01:17:52.340 --> 01:18:00.260]   Eric, you mentioned in your book about Jack Vogel being a force of nature.
[01:18:00.260 --> 01:18:09.100]   I like that because one could see that he was a force of nature.
[01:18:09.100 --> 01:18:17.320]   Do you think he really relished the idea of being a force for the average investor?
[01:18:17.320 --> 01:18:21.820]   You mentioned that in your own family, you have a family, you have things that you have
[01:18:21.820 --> 01:18:22.820]   to do.
[01:18:22.820 --> 01:18:28.780]   You cannot spend your whole day watching stocks, worrying about your stocks, individual stocks,
[01:18:28.780 --> 01:18:31.540]   protecting your own portfolio of stocks.
[01:18:31.540 --> 01:18:35.100]   It is difficult to raise your family, especially nowadays without pensions.
[01:18:35.100 --> 01:18:39.200]   You have to create your own pension, you have to have a retirement fund.
[01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:44.700]   What asset allocation, how much stock, how much bond, how many bonds, how do you buy
[01:18:44.700 --> 01:18:45.700]   your bonds?
[01:18:45.700 --> 01:18:53.180]   Jack Vogel, he was so interested in the average person.
[01:18:53.180 --> 01:19:00.300]   What I have read about people who interviewed with him when they applied for jobs, his first
[01:19:00.300 --> 01:19:05.660]   questions were not about their experience in the financial industry.
[01:19:05.660 --> 01:19:07.940]   It was, how did you grow up?
[01:19:07.940 --> 01:19:10.420]   Did you work when you were in high school?
[01:19:10.420 --> 01:19:13.500]   He was interested in the person.
[01:19:13.500 --> 01:19:23.940]   He wanted to make investing simple, and yet he knew the simple was the best.
[01:19:23.940 --> 01:19:30.340]   You could have your index funds on hold, you could just have them in your portfolio and
[01:19:30.340 --> 01:19:35.500]   basically not worry about them, and when you retired, you would have a nice pot of money
[01:19:35.500 --> 01:19:38.380]   there for your family and for you and for your retirement.
[01:19:38.380 --> 01:19:43.580]   Yeah, the word I think that he would describe is predictability.
[01:19:43.580 --> 01:19:49.140]   Index funds had predictability, which active funds do not, and that's really helpful in
[01:19:49.140 --> 01:19:52.700]   their staying power and their ability for you to just tune out.
[01:19:52.700 --> 01:19:57.220]   Like Michael Lewis said, it's an unmeasured benefit, and it's great.
[01:19:57.220 --> 01:20:01.140]   Again, there's so many dimensions to this story.
[01:20:01.140 --> 01:20:05.500]   Your idea of him hiring characters, I think that was important because he also wanted
[01:20:05.500 --> 01:20:09.060]   to hire people who probably would get psychic income from working at Vanguard, because you're
[01:20:09.060 --> 01:20:12.700]   not going to make the most money on Wall Street there, but you're going to feel good about
[01:20:12.700 --> 01:20:16.300]   what you do, and you're probably going to settle down in Melbourne, get a family, a
[01:20:16.300 --> 01:20:20.700]   suburban house, and be less likely to get hired away.
[01:20:20.700 --> 01:20:23.580]   It makes a lot of sense, even if that wasn't his main motive.
[01:20:23.580 --> 01:20:27.780]   I also think that one of the stories I heard a lot, which I had to cut from the book, was
[01:20:27.780 --> 01:20:30.540]   he really likes sports.
[01:20:30.540 --> 01:20:37.020]   I think Gus Sauter came in with a tennis racket in his bag, or he had basketball shoes on
[01:20:37.020 --> 01:20:38.340]   that he forgot to take off.
[01:20:38.340 --> 01:20:42.780]   There were a couple of stories of key executives at Vanguard who got hired simply because they
[01:20:42.780 --> 01:20:47.860]   came with something sports-related hanging off of them, and Vogel went right to that.
[01:20:47.860 --> 01:20:48.860]   "Oh, what do you play?
[01:20:48.860 --> 01:20:49.860]   How do you play?"
[01:20:49.860 --> 01:20:53.380]   Because Vogel loved playing squash, and so he liked that competitive nature.
[01:20:53.380 --> 01:20:56.500]   You have a life outside of this place.
[01:20:56.500 --> 01:20:58.620]   I definitely heard some of those stories.
[01:20:58.620 --> 01:21:03.540]   There was one guy who told me that one time he came in to interview with Vogel, and Vogel
[01:21:03.540 --> 01:21:08.060]   fell asleep during the interview, because he's working really hard.
[01:21:08.060 --> 01:21:12.540]   I could see that, just kind of nodding off during the interview.
[01:21:12.540 --> 01:21:13.540]   That was funny.
[01:21:13.540 --> 01:21:21.180]   It was a good story, but yeah, no, I think those are all important things, and again,
[01:21:21.180 --> 01:21:23.260]   I keep going back to the word "weird."
[01:21:23.260 --> 01:21:26.260]   I know what you just described sounds like a normal person looking for character.
[01:21:26.260 --> 01:21:31.420]   I get that, but think of all the big companies that have hedge funds.
[01:21:31.420 --> 01:21:38.220]   They're looking for people who can apply some complicated math and have an edge.
[01:21:38.220 --> 01:21:40.260]   That wasn't his deal, and I think you're right.
[01:21:40.260 --> 01:21:44.540]   He kept it simple in how he hired as well, and many of those people stayed for a long
[01:21:44.540 --> 01:21:50.420]   time, and many of them who went on to other things speak fondly.
[01:21:50.420 --> 01:21:57.380]   I tried to find a former assistant or even someone near him that was dumped on or something,
[01:21:57.380 --> 01:21:58.900]   and I couldn't really find it.
[01:21:58.900 --> 01:22:01.680]   His former assistants were among his biggest fans.
[01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:08.580]   His son loved him, said he was my hero, and he was even ... I mean, guys seem pretty good
[01:22:08.580 --> 01:22:10.540]   model of what a person should be.
[01:22:10.540 --> 01:22:17.980]   Like I said, he wasn't perfect, but in the intro, I say, "Look, the net positive is the
[01:22:17.980 --> 01:22:21.180]   accurate framing here."
[01:22:21.180 --> 01:22:24.820]   There are a couple people out there, Dan Wiener in particular, and this other guy from the
[01:22:24.820 --> 01:22:29.340]   Philadelphia Inquirer, who they couldn't handle my take.
[01:22:29.340 --> 01:22:32.540]   They're like, "It's too positive."
[01:22:32.540 --> 01:22:33.620]   I'm just looking at the data.
[01:22:33.620 --> 01:22:37.380]   I'm looking at what this guy did, and I'm like, "It's incredible.
[01:22:37.380 --> 01:22:39.740]   I'm calling it like I see it."
[01:22:39.740 --> 01:22:43.540]   They get caught up with like, "Oh, well, the executives there, they don't tell you how
[01:22:43.540 --> 01:22:47.420]   much they make these days, and that's why it's all ... " I'm like, "You're looking at
[01:22:47.420 --> 01:22:53.620]   a tiny speck in this bigger picture, and even if they made $2 million, the fee's still three
[01:22:53.620 --> 01:22:54.620]   bips.
[01:22:54.620 --> 01:22:56.460]   It doesn't change that."
[01:22:56.460 --> 01:22:57.460]   There's a lot of nitpickers.
[01:22:57.460 --> 01:23:03.460]   There's a couple nitpickers to say that you could really go, and you could have a negative
[01:23:03.460 --> 01:23:05.580]   slant on the guy and everything he did.
[01:23:05.580 --> 01:23:06.580]   I guess you could.
[01:23:06.580 --> 01:23:07.580]   It'd be very difficult.
[01:23:07.580 --> 01:23:13.460]   I feel like you'd have to do a lot of mental gymnastics to say, "This guy sucked."
[01:23:13.460 --> 01:23:16.020]   I just don't see it.
[01:23:16.020 --> 01:23:19.300]   I thought, "I also want to write a book for my kids."
[01:23:19.300 --> 01:23:20.780]   I had a chance to hang out with this great man.
[01:23:20.780 --> 01:23:22.300]   He completely changed it.
[01:23:22.300 --> 01:23:27.820]   I wanted to give a Gen X version of him because, like I said, he had a dash of punk rock, a
[01:23:27.820 --> 01:23:28.820]   real dose of populism.
[01:23:28.820 --> 01:23:34.740]   These things are popular and interesting because most people think of mutual funds as interesting
[01:23:34.740 --> 01:23:35.740]   as C-SPAN.
[01:23:35.740 --> 01:23:42.060]   They think of them as like Boomer, and I really wanted to reframe him to a younger audience
[01:23:42.060 --> 01:23:46.500]   and to my kids later—they're not interested now, but maybe they will down the road—that
[01:23:46.500 --> 01:23:48.660]   yeah, this is a cool story.
[01:23:48.660 --> 01:23:49.660]   I framed it.
[01:23:49.660 --> 01:23:51.700]   There will be many books written about him.
[01:23:51.700 --> 01:23:53.020]   I won't be the only one.
[01:23:53.020 --> 01:23:55.220]   There's already been a couple.
[01:23:55.220 --> 01:23:57.580]   I think down the road, there'll be more.
[01:23:57.580 --> 01:23:58.580]   People can make their own decision.
[01:23:58.580 --> 01:24:03.660]   I think I heard there's like 800 books written on Winston Churchill.
[01:24:03.660 --> 01:24:06.140]   I think Vogel could at least get a dozen.
[01:24:06.140 --> 01:24:12.020]   Ellen, do you have a question?
[01:24:12.020 --> 01:24:13.020]   You're on mute.
[01:24:13.020 --> 01:24:14.020]   Ellen?
[01:24:14.020 --> 01:24:15.020]   Yeah.
[01:24:15.020 --> 01:24:16.020]   Yes.
[01:24:16.020 --> 01:24:17.020]   Thank you.
[01:24:17.020 --> 01:24:19.660]   Thank you, Eric, for an excellent presentation.
[01:24:19.660 --> 01:24:21.900]   Jean in the chat has a good question.
[01:24:21.900 --> 01:24:28.220]   Do you think Vanguard will continue to capture AUM growth at the same pace after their ETF
[01:24:28.220 --> 01:24:31.660]   share class patent expires next May?
[01:24:31.660 --> 01:24:33.100]   Yes.
[01:24:33.100 --> 01:24:38.100]   That patent expiration, it's not as huge of a big deal to the rest of the industry as
[01:24:38.100 --> 01:24:39.620]   people think.
[01:24:39.620 --> 01:24:46.700]   Also, you have to keep in mind that the rest of the industry that wants to use this patent,
[01:24:46.700 --> 01:24:52.060]   a lot of what they want to do is use it for their high-cost active mutual funds.
[01:24:52.060 --> 01:24:59.340]   But again, just like active non-transparent ETFs, you can create cool new structures,
[01:24:59.340 --> 01:25:03.700]   but the metaphor I use is you can have a dog food bowl that's state-of-the-art, but the
[01:25:03.700 --> 01:25:07.420]   dog has to want to eat the food in it.
[01:25:07.420 --> 01:25:13.860]   You could take, if an active mutual fund is seeing outflows, and people are leaving, putting
[01:25:13.860 --> 01:25:17.700]   an ETF share class on it isn't going to do much.
[01:25:17.700 --> 01:25:20.660]   We've seen Fidelity Magellan is a great example.
[01:25:20.660 --> 01:25:24.700]   They launched a clone of the Magellan fund in an ETF format about a year and a half ago.
[01:25:24.700 --> 01:25:25.940]   They have no assets.
[01:25:25.940 --> 01:25:28.980]   Nobody cares.
[01:25:28.980 --> 01:25:32.900]   Most of the assets in active funds are mirage.
[01:25:32.900 --> 01:25:34.740]   A lot of the customers have left.
[01:25:34.740 --> 01:25:37.380]   What's left is just that pie chart I showed.
[01:25:37.380 --> 01:25:40.620]   It's just assets based on the market having gone up.
[01:25:40.620 --> 01:25:47.980]   That's why if this bear market continues for like two years or so, I'd say, we're going
[01:25:47.980 --> 01:25:52.420]   to see these mirages collapse, and they're going to team up and get bought.
[01:25:52.420 --> 01:25:59.260]   You could see an ETF issuer like Invesco buying T. Rowe Price.
[01:25:59.260 --> 01:26:01.220]   It could get crazy.
[01:26:01.220 --> 01:26:05.220]   No, I don't really think it's going to change much.
[01:26:05.220 --> 01:26:09.660]   The other thing is people ask me all the time, "Well, a lot of people have cheap index funds
[01:26:09.660 --> 01:26:10.660]   and ETFs.
[01:26:10.660 --> 01:26:12.580]   Why does Vanguard continue taking the most money?"
[01:26:12.580 --> 01:26:17.980]   I'm like, "Well, they built up a brand of being for the little guy and low cost for
[01:26:17.980 --> 01:26:21.500]   40 years before anybody else followed them."
[01:26:21.500 --> 01:26:23.420]   That's a 40-year head start with branding.
[01:26:23.420 --> 01:26:26.500]   You cannot just magically erase that.
[01:26:26.500 --> 01:26:30.740]   A lot of times in the book, people would say this, they'd say, "Vanguard lowered fees because
[01:26:30.740 --> 01:26:32.300]   they wanted to.
[01:26:32.300 --> 01:26:34.660]   Everyone else did it because they had to."
[01:26:34.660 --> 01:26:36.140]   That mattered to some people.
[01:26:36.140 --> 01:26:41.400]   I think for those reasons, I don't really think switching this or doing that will really
[01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:44.740]   change this whole trend much at all.
[01:26:44.740 --> 01:26:47.780]   Excellent answer.
[01:26:47.780 --> 01:26:58.060]   Eric, when you go on the Bogleheads forum, Jack Bogle loved our forum, and he loved the
[01:26:58.060 --> 01:26:59.060]   Bogleheads.
[01:26:59.060 --> 01:27:05.780]   He said he loved it because it was, and you put out the quote on your screen, "Individual
[01:27:05.780 --> 01:27:12.060]   investors helping other investors," for the main purpose of helping each other.
[01:27:12.060 --> 01:27:16.260]   He thought that when he had quotes from de Tocqueville about the American system where
[01:27:16.260 --> 01:27:19.780]   people band together in groups to help each other.
[01:27:19.780 --> 01:27:21.180]   He really liked it.
[01:27:21.180 --> 01:27:27.260]   When you go on the Boglehead forum, what strikes you about the forum?
[01:27:27.260 --> 01:27:34.820]   By the way, could you tell everybody how you were banned from the Boglehead forum?
[01:27:34.820 --> 01:27:38.420]   What happened there?
[01:27:38.420 --> 01:27:41.440]   Maybe Lady Geek wants to go over that story, but I'll tell you anyway.
[01:27:41.440 --> 01:27:42.580]   I was researching the book.
[01:27:42.580 --> 01:27:43.740]   I had not gone to the book.
[01:27:43.740 --> 01:27:44.740]   I knew they existed.
[01:27:44.740 --> 01:27:45.740]   I knew the forum existed.
[01:27:45.740 --> 01:27:46.740]   I had seen it.
[01:27:46.740 --> 01:27:47.740]   I just wasn't on there a lot.
[01:27:47.740 --> 01:27:53.220]   I live in this world, so I didn't really feel the need to get an account and do that, but
[01:27:53.220 --> 01:27:56.340]   I will say the specificity of what's shared on there is really interesting.
[01:27:56.340 --> 01:27:59.180]   It's like how to roll over a 401(k).
[01:27:59.180 --> 01:28:01.820]   It's really cool stuff, very, very useful.
[01:28:01.820 --> 01:28:05.860]   Again, not real flashy, but highly practical.
[01:28:05.860 --> 01:28:10.860]   The website, it looks like it's stuck in 1996, no offense.
[01:28:10.860 --> 01:28:11.860]   We like it.
[01:28:11.860 --> 01:28:17.020]   It's part of the charm because it looks like early internet, but there's nothing.
[01:28:17.020 --> 01:28:18.020]   There's no ads.
[01:28:18.020 --> 01:28:19.020]   There's just nothing.
[01:28:19.020 --> 01:28:20.020]   It's pure.
[01:28:20.020 --> 01:28:24.220]   When I went on there, I got an account and I wanted to interview do-it-yourself Vanguard
[01:28:24.220 --> 01:28:27.700]   investors and I said, "Hey, I'm this guy writing a book on Vanguard and Bogle.
[01:28:27.700 --> 01:28:31.500]   If anybody out there is just a regular Vanguard investor and would like to be interviewed,
[01:28:31.500 --> 01:28:32.500]   let me know."
[01:28:32.500 --> 01:28:38.100]   I got an email, I think a day later, from Lady Geek saying, "You are disqualified.
[01:28:38.100 --> 01:28:42.460]   That's illegal and you have been banned."
[01:28:42.460 --> 01:28:45.180]   I was like, "Oh, really?"
[01:28:45.180 --> 01:28:46.180]   I explained my case.
[01:28:46.180 --> 01:28:47.580]   She goes, "Okay, I'll give you a second chance."
[01:28:47.580 --> 01:28:52.980]   She did give me a second chance to her credit, but in the book, I say that after reflecting
[01:28:52.980 --> 01:28:56.560]   on that, I respected it because there is a rule you can't solicit.
[01:28:56.560 --> 01:29:00.900]   The idea of a book is something I would make money on, even though I make very little money.
[01:29:00.900 --> 01:29:04.540]   The author gets very little money unless you're like Stephen King.
[01:29:04.540 --> 01:29:08.660]   The book would be making me money and then you'd open up Pandora's box potentially for
[01:29:08.660 --> 01:29:11.580]   other people like me and who wants that?
[01:29:11.580 --> 01:29:19.540]   I actually respected the decision because you're going to have to be the bad guy from
[01:29:19.540 --> 01:29:23.900]   time to time to keep that pure.
[01:29:23.900 --> 01:29:27.100]   That's my story on that, but certainly the forum is awesome.
[01:29:27.100 --> 01:29:28.100]   It's got a wide reach.
[01:29:28.100 --> 01:29:33.260]   A dentist friend of mine who I play golf with sometimes is like, "I saw somebody talk about
[01:29:33.260 --> 01:29:34.260]   you on the forum."
[01:29:34.260 --> 01:29:37.780]   It was some tweet I had about, it might have been about the Bitcoin ETF, I forget, but
[01:29:37.780 --> 01:29:40.100]   they took a tweet of mine and he saw it on there.
[01:29:40.100 --> 01:29:44.980]   Here's a guy who's a dentist who's on there and I asked him, "What's your portfolio look
[01:29:44.980 --> 01:29:45.980]   like?"
[01:29:45.980 --> 01:29:46.980]   He's got a very good portfolio.
[01:29:46.980 --> 01:29:53.660]   He worked it out to himself, not through a broker, and the Bogleheads forum helped him
[01:29:53.660 --> 01:29:54.660]   get there.
[01:29:54.660 --> 01:29:56.940]   That's obviously not affiliated with me.
[01:29:56.940 --> 01:29:59.700]   He got there already when he brought that story up.
[01:29:59.700 --> 01:30:04.500]   Well, that is what Mr. Bogle wished, I think.
[01:30:04.500 --> 01:30:12.420]   That's what he wished for individual investors to create funds, the index funds, so they
[01:30:12.420 --> 01:30:20.980]   could do it their way or do it themselves and not be necessary for them to pay a lot
[01:30:20.980 --> 01:30:26.500]   of money to brokers and to financial advisors for assets under management.
[01:30:26.500 --> 01:30:27.500]   Yeah.
[01:30:27.500 --> 01:30:31.060]   The advisor, I asked him in the last interview we had, "What do you think is going to happen
[01:30:31.060 --> 01:30:32.060]   to the advisory world?"
[01:30:32.060 --> 01:30:37.580]   He said, "Well, I think they're going to move to a more professional way to get paid."
[01:30:37.580 --> 01:30:42.700]   He thought the 1% fee that they got, even if that gets brought down by Betterment and
[01:30:42.700 --> 01:30:47.460]   Vanguard and such to, I don't know, 50 bips over the next 10 years, he thinks ultimately
[01:30:47.460 --> 01:30:48.460]   that's not enough.
[01:30:48.460 --> 01:30:52.620]   It's going to have to switch to hourly or as you go.
[01:30:52.620 --> 01:30:58.540]   If you really look at the numbers, if you go to see your doctor, going to see your advisor
[01:30:58.540 --> 01:31:03.580]   is the equivalent of seeing your doctor 30 times if you have a decent amount of money.
[01:31:03.580 --> 01:31:06.220]   It's a ridiculous number for what they're doing.
[01:31:06.220 --> 01:31:12.900]   If you get paid by the session, the problem is some people are so in shock.
[01:31:12.900 --> 01:31:17.260]   If I said to you, "Okay, come see me, you're going to charge me $5,000."
[01:31:17.260 --> 01:31:23.180]   It seems crazy, but it's probably way cheaper than 1% on your assets.
[01:31:23.180 --> 01:31:28.100]   People don't see the 1%, they don't write a check, so it becomes more difficult to disrupt
[01:31:28.100 --> 01:31:29.100]   that.
[01:31:29.100 --> 01:31:32.860]   I do think over time that will happen because there are people who are out there promoting
[01:31:32.860 --> 01:31:40.420]   the hourly model and ultimately, you might start to see a migration over to it, but it's
[01:31:40.420 --> 01:31:44.940]   got more challenges than the active mutual fund world did in the '90s, but it should
[01:31:44.940 --> 01:31:45.940]   be interesting.
[01:31:45.940 --> 01:31:47.820]   That's an area we watch a lot.
[01:31:47.820 --> 01:31:52.540]   Are there more questions from the chat?
[01:31:52.540 --> 01:31:56.940]   Alan, Gauri, do you want to?
[01:31:56.940 --> 01:32:00.580]   I don't see any in the chat, but I'm also not watching it closely.
[01:32:00.580 --> 01:32:04.700]   Here's a real quick one.
[01:32:04.700 --> 01:32:06.380]   The person said, "Did I misunderstand?
[01:32:06.380 --> 01:32:09.900]   Does a typical European really pay 2% to manage their funds?"
[01:32:09.900 --> 01:32:10.900]   Yeah.
[01:32:10.900 --> 01:32:15.620]   Actually, a lot of times, they pay more.
[01:32:15.620 --> 01:32:22.060]   Between the broker, the bank, the funds, it could be 5%, 6%.
[01:32:22.060 --> 01:32:26.780]   I went to visit Vanguard in Europe, and I remember the guy going, "You have no idea.
[01:32:26.780 --> 01:32:29.780]   It's ridiculous."
[01:32:29.780 --> 01:32:34.220]   Just looking at active mutual funds alone, the average fee paid over there is almost
[01:32:34.220 --> 01:32:37.940]   near between 1.5% and 2%.
[01:32:37.940 --> 01:32:41.040]   It's worse than where we were in the '80s and '90s.
[01:32:41.040 --> 01:32:42.900]   You see the same thing in Canada.
[01:32:42.900 --> 01:32:45.220]   I've traveled all over.
[01:32:45.220 --> 01:32:51.980]   Again, I've gone over the theories on why, but people just have way more tolerance than
[01:32:51.980 --> 01:32:52.980]   here in the US.
[01:32:52.980 --> 01:32:53.980]   I don't know.
[01:32:53.980 --> 01:32:57.860]   We're in the same culture, though, that created Amazon.
[01:32:57.860 --> 01:33:02.580]   We'll gladly leave the mall and go to Amazon because it's cheaper and more convenient.
[01:33:02.580 --> 01:33:04.800]   I think I give Americans credit.
[01:33:04.800 --> 01:33:06.700]   We are very good consumers.
[01:33:06.700 --> 01:33:10.340]   We are a consumer culture, and we don't have much to depend on.
[01:33:10.340 --> 01:33:11.700]   We have to look out for ourselves.
[01:33:11.700 --> 01:33:16.540]   I think that really makes a big difference.
[01:33:16.540 --> 01:33:17.540]   I agree with you.
[01:33:17.540 --> 01:33:23.180]   I would be like, "It's an absurd amount of money."
[01:33:23.180 --> 01:33:25.380]   Let's say you paid 2%.
[01:33:25.380 --> 01:33:28.860]   I just showed that chart with Vogel.
[01:33:28.860 --> 01:33:34.220]   Over 50 years, that 2% gap is worth like 200 grand.
[01:33:34.220 --> 01:33:38.740]   Basically the intermediaries take 60% of your gains over 50 years.
[01:33:38.740 --> 01:33:43.920]   You only keep 40% of your gains based on just that 2%, so a little bit is 3, 4, 5.
[01:33:43.920 --> 01:33:51.140]   It just becomes like you almost forego all of your future gains, all of it.
[01:33:51.140 --> 01:33:58.180]   Like I said, a lot of the SEC and people in the media, they go after really crazy cases
[01:33:58.180 --> 01:34:01.580]   like Madoff, which definitely you need to call that out.
[01:34:01.580 --> 01:34:06.380]   There's a general blob of money, a big blob of money, where the intermediaries, there's
[01:34:06.380 --> 01:34:10.580]   almost stuff that should probably be illegal.
[01:34:10.580 --> 01:34:18.260]   Look, it's been going on for so long and seems like no big deal, but when you convert all
[01:34:18.260 --> 01:34:27.980]   of that to dollars, it's crazy and it almost seems unethical at the very least.
[01:34:27.980 --> 01:34:32.500]   I say that as somebody who feeds downstream from these people who are friends with active
[01:34:32.500 --> 01:34:33.500]   managers.
[01:34:33.500 --> 01:34:38.820]   Some of them are very nice, but they're all caught in this incentive system that rewards
[01:34:38.820 --> 01:34:39.820]   all this.
[01:34:39.820 --> 01:34:42.320]   It's an incentive system, which is really the ultimate issue.
[01:34:42.320 --> 01:34:46.940]   That's why in the '70s, when he decided not to pay brokers, that really fired the first
[01:34:46.940 --> 01:34:53.620]   shot that changed everything, because now the incentive system, he would not be part
[01:34:53.620 --> 01:34:54.620]   of.
[01:34:54.620 --> 01:34:58.980]   He set up camp alone outside of the incentive system.
[01:34:58.980 --> 01:35:04.980]   As he quoted Field of Dreams, he built it and hoping they would come.
[01:35:04.980 --> 01:35:09.620]   Most people just unwilling to risk their whole career and a decade of profits for that are,
[01:35:09.620 --> 01:35:12.300]   like I said, it's unusual to do that.
[01:35:12.300 --> 01:35:16.620]   It's funny, I interviewed the guy from Flash Boys, Brad Kutsuyama.
[01:35:16.620 --> 01:35:23.180]   He's the guy who started that exchange that is boglish in a way that it doesn't take kickbacks.
[01:35:23.180 --> 01:35:27.380]   When I told him that it took Vanguard 25 years to get to 10% market share, he said I made
[01:35:27.380 --> 01:35:31.300]   his day, because they're having a tough time.
[01:35:31.300 --> 01:35:37.900]   If you operate outside of an incentive system, be prepared to be patient.
[01:35:37.900 --> 01:35:41.260]   That is the problem in Europe, but you have Vanguard and BlackRock and other companies
[01:35:41.260 --> 01:35:47.500]   coming in and trying to talk about this stuff and boggle heads, ultimately, I think it'll
[01:35:47.500 --> 01:35:48.500]   change.
[01:35:48.500 --> 01:35:49.500]   It's wild.
[01:35:49.500 --> 01:35:55.820]   I've been shocked when I actually physically go to these places and hear these stories.
[01:35:55.820 --> 01:35:59.740]   Especially here, because when BlackRock goes to three bips and Vanguard's two, we actually
[01:35:59.740 --> 01:36:00.740]   see money.
[01:36:00.740 --> 01:36:03.280]   I call it the power of one basis point.
[01:36:03.280 --> 01:36:08.380]   People here are that tuned in to cost that they're worried about one bip or 10, and over
[01:36:08.380 --> 01:36:12.780]   there, 100 is no biggie.
[01:36:12.780 --> 01:36:13.780]   Thanks for that, Eric.
[01:36:13.780 --> 01:36:19.220]   I'll post two questions, and I see it's 9.40 Eastern, so you let us know when you need
[01:36:19.220 --> 01:36:20.740]   to jump.
[01:36:20.740 --> 01:36:27.380]   One is, more broadly speaking, Vanguard, you're saying, is just beginning disrupting certain
[01:36:27.380 --> 01:36:34.780]   spaces, but overlaying your Dan Egan quote about Rome fell or empires fall applied to
[01:36:34.780 --> 01:36:37.780]   the US.
[01:36:37.780 --> 01:36:41.020]   Let's overlay that to Vanguard.
[01:36:41.020 --> 01:36:42.860]   What do you think the threats are to Vanguard?
[01:36:42.860 --> 01:36:45.720]   Where are they vulnerable?
[01:36:45.720 --> 01:36:48.740]   What should they be worried about?
[01:36:48.740 --> 01:36:49.740]   Customer service.
[01:36:49.740 --> 01:36:55.820]   Even on the boggle heads platform, and Lady Geek will tell you about this, people trash
[01:36:55.820 --> 01:37:00.900]   Vanguard's customer service right on the platform.
[01:37:00.900 --> 01:37:01.900]   That's not a good sign.
[01:37:01.900 --> 01:37:07.660]   These are supposed to be the biggest fans, and then, conversely, if you go to Yelp.com,
[01:37:07.660 --> 01:37:12.620]   where I live in the Philadelphia area, Vanguard gets 1.5 stars.
[01:37:12.620 --> 01:37:13.620]   Okay?
[01:37:13.620 --> 01:37:15.220]   That's out of five.
[01:37:15.220 --> 01:37:17.380]   The reviews are all awful.
[01:37:17.380 --> 01:37:19.220]   You know what else gets 1.5 stars?
[01:37:19.220 --> 01:37:23.100]   The Walmart on Columbus Boulevard, which is like a cesspool.
[01:37:23.100 --> 01:37:26.980]   I mean, it's awful.
[01:37:26.980 --> 01:37:30.580]   It's almost like it's just pandemonium.
[01:37:30.580 --> 01:37:31.580]   There's long lines.
[01:37:31.580 --> 01:37:33.180]   The carts don't work.
[01:37:33.180 --> 01:37:35.500]   There's nobody can help you.
[01:37:35.500 --> 01:37:41.500]   So Vanguard has the same Yelp review as Walmart, so that's a big problem, but it's still not
[01:37:41.500 --> 01:37:46.820]   big enough yet to curb their flows, so ultimately, I think what's going to happen is regulation's
[01:37:46.820 --> 01:37:52.100]   going to kick in and say, "Look, no company can own, say, more than 15% of a stock," and
[01:37:52.100 --> 01:37:55.580]   that will cap Vanguard, but again, it doesn't matter.
[01:37:55.580 --> 01:38:00.460]   All these little mini-Vanguards have been formed in the way of other companies copying
[01:38:00.460 --> 01:38:04.980]   them, so the genie is out of the bottle, the ship has sailed.
[01:38:04.980 --> 01:38:06.260]   It's almost meaningless.
[01:38:06.260 --> 01:38:10.380]   In fact, I think Bogle, if he had a choice, would say, "Yeah, regulate Vanguard right
[01:38:10.380 --> 01:38:11.380]   now.
[01:38:11.380 --> 01:38:12.380]   We own too much.
[01:38:12.380 --> 01:38:17.820]   It's ridiculous and absurd, and let these other people start getting assets into their
[01:38:17.820 --> 01:38:24.940]   cheap stuff, and that will, again, curb our market share," which was my ultimate dream,
[01:38:24.940 --> 01:38:29.580]   but outside of regulation, I'm not sure what else could do it.
[01:38:29.580 --> 01:38:30.580]   Okay.
[01:38:30.580 --> 01:38:31.580]   Great perspective.
[01:38:31.580 --> 01:38:38.980]   So my last question, you mentioned Jack's, say, commencement speeches, or you could read
[01:38:38.980 --> 01:38:45.260]   these things over decades sometimes and how there was this through line where he was unchanged
[01:38:45.260 --> 01:38:50.140]   on certain things, certain values and principles, but he also must have evolved in certain ways
[01:38:50.140 --> 01:38:51.460]   over those decades.
[01:38:51.460 --> 01:38:58.860]   So can you talk about those two contrasts and what ways was he absolutely firm and unchanging
[01:38:58.860 --> 01:39:03.900]   that you haven't already covered, and then in what ways did you learn that he evolved?
[01:39:03.900 --> 01:39:09.660]   And just something that's fun for me to share, speaking of the early Jack, I happened to
[01:39:09.660 --> 01:39:19.560]   get super lucky on eBay one day and purchased Jack's graduation album from Princeton.
[01:39:19.560 --> 01:39:26.220]   So this is from the 1951, I don't know what's in view here there.
[01:39:26.220 --> 01:39:31.900]   So 1951 from Princeton, and so to give folks a sense of Jack, mind you, he autographed
[01:39:31.900 --> 01:39:36.060]   this when I sent it to him in 2014, hopefully that's readable.
[01:39:36.060 --> 01:39:39.360]   So you see he was in student government back then as well.
[01:39:39.360 --> 01:39:43.980]   So he was, as far as I can tell, an activist at heart for a long time.
[01:39:43.980 --> 01:39:46.260]   So back to you, Eric.
[01:39:46.260 --> 01:39:53.920]   So his great-grandfather was a gadfly towards the fireman insurance business.
[01:39:53.920 --> 01:40:00.240]   And when you read his great-grandfather's pamphlets, it's all Bogle.
[01:40:00.240 --> 01:40:02.600]   It's like, "Gentlemen, lower your fees."
[01:40:02.600 --> 01:40:04.740]   That's the quote he used that he got from his great-grandfather.
[01:40:04.740 --> 01:40:07.040]   So there was something in the Bogle blood about that.
[01:40:07.040 --> 01:40:11.940]   And in the book, I say, honestly, he might've been miscast.
[01:40:11.940 --> 01:40:18.760]   As you said, I think government or military or maybe even medicine might've been a more
[01:40:18.760 --> 01:40:21.280]   accurate place for a guy like that.
[01:40:21.280 --> 01:40:24.680]   But we actually got lucky that he ended up in this industry.
[01:40:24.680 --> 01:40:28.760]   This industry probably needed a weird guy like that who was miscast.
[01:40:28.760 --> 01:40:35.800]   But to your point about how he stayed the same, stewardship and costs seem to be constant.
[01:40:35.800 --> 01:40:40.900]   What changed was that he would launch a quant fund, he launched value growth, he launched
[01:40:40.900 --> 01:40:41.900]   all these things.
[01:40:41.900 --> 01:40:43.120]   He did change with the times.
[01:40:43.120 --> 01:40:46.640]   He built a mutual fund company that had several options for you.
[01:40:46.640 --> 01:40:53.240]   But over the years, he would come to find them all an exercise in futility.
[01:40:53.240 --> 01:40:58.880]   And so one of the fascinating things was that Bogle would crap on many of the funds he created.
[01:40:58.880 --> 01:41:03.280]   He didn't like the value or growth funds, which are now the two biggest smart beta funds
[01:41:03.280 --> 01:41:04.480]   in the world.
[01:41:04.480 --> 01:41:07.280]   They have like $200 billion each.
[01:41:07.280 --> 01:41:10.200]   And he thought it's just a waste.
[01:41:10.200 --> 01:41:18.360]   And that's how honest he was that he obviously had problems with his own innovations over
[01:41:18.360 --> 01:41:19.400]   the years.
[01:41:19.400 --> 01:41:24.520]   And he settled into, well, you just buy an S&P 500 or total market US funds, and really
[01:41:24.520 --> 01:41:26.080]   there's nothing else to do.
[01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:28.800]   And so that put him at odds with everybody.
[01:41:28.800 --> 01:41:34.760]   But the stewardship and low cost, I think that thread was throughout.
[01:41:34.760 --> 01:41:38.560]   And in the book, he's not anti-active.
[01:41:38.560 --> 01:41:40.800]   He's not anti-high cost even.
[01:41:40.800 --> 01:41:44.800]   And the book, I sort of settle on what he said in his own words, which was that he's
[01:41:44.800 --> 01:41:46.640]   just very pro stewardship.
[01:41:46.640 --> 01:41:50.960]   Like I said, you can be high cost if you're small, you need the money.
[01:41:50.960 --> 01:41:57.980]   And you can be active and it's all about, are you a good steward of this person's money?
[01:41:57.980 --> 01:42:04.720]   And I think when you're getting $800 million a year in dollar fees to service one fund,
[01:42:04.720 --> 01:42:06.640]   you're not a good steward.
[01:42:06.640 --> 01:42:12.920]   So again, it was all about the specific situations and the word stewardship that I think was
[01:42:12.920 --> 01:42:14.320]   the common thread.
[01:42:14.320 --> 01:42:19.200]   But the crapping on his own innovations made it, again, who does that?
[01:42:19.200 --> 01:42:25.720]   You rarely see somebody like Steve Jobs ever came out and said, iPad sucks.
[01:42:25.720 --> 01:42:31.440]   It's just very unusual for someone to level their own company and most of the work they
[01:42:31.440 --> 01:42:32.440]   did there.
[01:42:32.440 --> 01:42:33.440]   Weird guy.
[01:42:33.440 --> 01:42:38.680]   And you've commented in similar to Steve Jobs that ultimately it was a journey towards
[01:42:38.680 --> 01:42:39.680]   simplicity.
[01:42:39.680 --> 01:42:40.680]   Right?
[01:42:40.680 --> 01:42:41.680]   Yeah.
[01:42:41.680 --> 01:42:45.380]   Also, Steve Jobs has this rule, if you don't cannibalize yourself, somebody else will.
[01:42:45.380 --> 01:42:51.640]   The first iPod comes out, it's 400 bucks, holds a thousand songs and it's huge.
[01:42:51.640 --> 01:42:58.080]   Second iPod comes out two years later, it's 300 bucks, holds 10,000 songs and it's smaller.
[01:42:58.080 --> 01:43:02.000]   Rinse and repeat and nobody can catch Apple.
[01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.300]   Bogle did this.
[01:43:04.300 --> 01:43:08.720]   Jobs did it because he's a hard ass and it's smart and it's the innovators dilemma.
[01:43:08.720 --> 01:43:10.920]   The active mutual fund industry did the opposite.
[01:43:10.920 --> 01:43:16.120]   They kept all the money, didn't do any of that and they paid the price.
[01:43:16.120 --> 01:43:24.420]   So I do think Steve Jobs had a hardcore element in him that was similar to Bogle's, although
[01:43:24.420 --> 01:43:29.760]   Jobs did it without the mutual ownership structure, purely just out of this makes sense business
[01:43:29.760 --> 01:43:34.960]   wise, so there was a relation there, I always thought.
[01:43:34.960 --> 01:43:42.040]   And I thought these are two guys who started doing this early on in their life and were
[01:43:42.040 --> 01:43:46.760]   consistent the whole time pretty much and put out products.
[01:43:46.760 --> 01:43:51.240]   He doesn't like the word products, but I'll use it anyway.
[01:43:51.240 --> 01:43:56.800]   Just the idea of getting a eight basis point, five basis point index fund into the marketplace
[01:43:56.800 --> 01:44:04.640]   is such a gift for people again that you could talk about all this stuff, you could talk
[01:44:04.640 --> 01:44:11.540]   about behavior, but you need something practical to actually use to implement all this.
[01:44:11.540 --> 01:44:16.720]   So providing the product was also important and like Jobs who was ultimately a visionary,
[01:44:16.720 --> 01:44:19.200]   you ever see an interview with Jobs, his mind is all over the place.
[01:44:19.200 --> 01:44:25.360]   He's clearly very, he's got a vision and he's got thoughts and he reads journals.
[01:44:25.360 --> 01:44:29.720]   At the same time, he could manage a huge organization.
[01:44:29.720 --> 01:44:34.480]   To be a manager of people and a visionary, these two things don't collide a lot.
[01:44:34.480 --> 01:44:38.140]   Normally one or the other, Bogle also had both.
[01:44:38.140 --> 01:44:43.960]   So usually when you combine a visionary, someone who has academic knowledge, someone who has
[01:44:43.960 --> 01:44:48.160]   competitive spirit and can actually manage people without pissing them all off and create
[01:44:48.160 --> 01:44:52.600]   a huge structure, those people tend to change the world because they have like four or five
[01:44:52.600 --> 01:44:55.960]   things that normally we only have one of.
[01:44:55.960 --> 01:44:59.920]   Got it, excellent.
[01:44:59.920 --> 01:45:05.360]   So I don't know, Miriam, if there are any other questions in the chat, but Eric is where
[01:45:05.360 --> 01:45:07.440]   10 to 10 Eastern.
[01:45:07.440 --> 01:45:13.080]   Before we wrap up again, I want to thank you on behalf of the Bogleheads community for
[01:45:13.080 --> 01:45:19.560]   a phenomenal presentation and Q and A. And before you go, what's the best way for folks
[01:45:19.560 --> 01:45:22.320]   to find you?
[01:45:22.320 --> 01:45:26.760]   I would say here, I'll pull up my Twitter page here and you can find me on Twitter.
[01:45:26.760 --> 01:45:27.760]   Where is it?
[01:45:27.760 --> 01:45:28.760]   Here we go.
[01:45:28.760 --> 01:45:29.760]   @ericvaltunis.
[01:45:29.760 --> 01:45:34.640]   I don't know why I can't click on this, bad timing for my internet to not work.
[01:45:34.640 --> 01:45:40.920]   But @ericvaltunis on Twitter and let's see here, profile.
[01:45:40.920 --> 01:45:45.840]   Twitter's gotten a little crazy since Elon Musk took over, but I think it'll calm down.
[01:45:45.840 --> 01:45:50.000]   But anyway, here's my homepage here if it comes up.
[01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:57.600]   And the other way you can find me is I have a podcast called Trillions and I have a TV
[01:45:57.600 --> 01:46:03.320]   show called ETFIQ that's on Bloomberg TV every Monday at 1 p.m.
[01:46:03.320 --> 01:46:12.160]   But if you look at my feed here, you can see it's a lot of financial information.
[01:46:12.160 --> 01:46:16.240]   I talked about the Vanguard story on here earlier.
[01:46:16.240 --> 01:46:19.040]   Anyway I think this is a good place and my DMs are open.
[01:46:19.040 --> 01:46:22.920]   So if you go to message, you can message me whenever you want if you have a question.
[01:46:22.920 --> 01:46:23.920]   And this is all free.
[01:46:23.920 --> 01:46:28.480]   You can find me at the terminal, but most people that are retail don't have a terminal.
[01:46:28.480 --> 01:46:33.080]   So I'll say that, but assuming that's not how you're going to get me.
[01:46:33.080 --> 01:46:34.080]   Fantastic.
[01:46:34.080 --> 01:46:35.080]   So thanks for sharing.
[01:46:35.080 --> 01:46:37.460]   And then I'll just check in with Miriam really quickly.
[01:46:37.460 --> 01:46:39.080]   Any closing comments?
[01:46:39.080 --> 01:46:42.240]   And thanks again to all the team that helped organize this.
[01:46:42.240 --> 01:46:43.240]   Yes.
