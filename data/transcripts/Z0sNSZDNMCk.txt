[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.920]   All right, let's do some questions.
[00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:12.120]   As always, we start with questions about deep work.
[00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.960]   Our first question comes from Tanner.
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.160]   Tanner says, "Can you implement your productivity tips
[00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.820]   without time blocking?"
[00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.520]   He elaborates, "I'm a public defender,
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.680]   and I have implemented a capture configure control setup
[00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.520]   that has greatly helped me reign in my caseload."
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.640]   I'm skipping here a little bit,
[00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.840]   but he says he generally finds it hard to time block,
[00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.120]   however, because there's aspects of his day
[00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.440]   that are so out of control.
[00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.000]   He says, "Often things bubble up throughout the day,
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.520]   and I have more small tasks than can be easily scheduled.
[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:46.680]   Is it possible to implement
[00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.440]   the patented Cal Newport productivity system
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.860]   while mostly eschewing time blocking?"
[00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.980]   So yes, Tanner, you can.
[00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.680]   So what is the patented Cal Newport productivity system?
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.320]   Well, here is where I can point everyone
[00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.200]   to a video in which I explain this step-by-step,
[00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.920]   a core ideas video.
[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.400]   If you go to the YouTube page for the show,
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.480]   youtube.com/calnewportmedia,
[00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:13.980]   you go to the core idea playlist,
[00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.720]   and I have a core idea video on time management
[00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.040]   where I say, "Here is my philosophy for time management.
[00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.260]   What are the high-level principles?"
[00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.880]   And then I explain my specific system
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.640]   for implementing those high-level principles.
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.840]   So the high-level principles, as you mentioned, Tanner,
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.020]   are capture, configure, control.
[00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.400]   Time blocking is part of how I specifically implement
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.620]   that last piece, control.
[00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.820]   So you can certainly take those high-level principles
[00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.000]   and implement them in a way
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.400]   that makes the most sense for your job.
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.280]   And for your job, that might mean,
[00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.500]   for that control piece, not having time blocking.
[00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.800]   That's actually quite common.
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.760]   I would say the most commonly occurring example I get
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.640]   or hear from in terms of individuals who use that system
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.120]   but don't use time blocking in implementing control
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.820]   is people who do support work.
[00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.240]   So IT professionals, for example,
[00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.880]   will often run their days off a ticketing system.
[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.400]   So control, time blocking is not that relevant for control.
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.120]   What they typically do is have,
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.920]   what they worry about is there's a small amount
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.000]   of non-urgent, personally initiated work
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.240]   that has to happen in addition to just servicing tickets.
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.040]   There's always some stuff you have to do.
[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.600]   And they typically put aside a certain amount of time,
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.600]   set time every day where they do that work.
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:29.480]   And otherwise they're just running
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.560]   through their ticketing system.
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.840]   And so they are definitely controlling their time
[00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.120]   but they don't have to time block every minute.
[00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.120]   It doesn't make sense 'cause most of their day
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.600]   is actually executing one ticket after another.
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.080]   So it could be similar for you, Tanner,
[00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.160]   that you have a different method of controlling.
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.360]   The key is just making sure
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.560]   that these three principles are implemented.
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.020]   And so capture is about not having things in your head,
[00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.520]   be it small obligations or big projects.
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.160]   You're not keeping track of things in your head.
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.300]   They're entrusted systems.
[00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.640]   Configure is wrangling with and making sense
[00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:00.840]   of all the stuff on your plate,
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.280]   simplifying, getting rid of things,
[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.060]   clarifying, taking things off, moving things around.
[00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.080]   So you really understand what's on your plate.
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.640]   You have plans at multiple scales.
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:09.920]   You're not just winging it.
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.320]   And control is making sure
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.640]   that you are not reactively just going through your day,
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.020]   saying what's next in a way that is unintentional.
[00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.200]   So however you wanna implement that is fine by me.
[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.000]   I will say though, Tanner, looking at your elaboration,
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.780]   I'm not sure that time blocking is not gonna work for you.
[00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.640]   It looks like to me, and again,
[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.080]   I'm basing this off of just two paragraphs
[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.640]   of description I have here.
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.760]   But it looks like to me
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.120]   that if you put a little bit more emphasis into configure,
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.400]   you might be able to use time blocking and control
[00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.200]   because you talk about here that,
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.360]   you know, you have all these small,
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.780]   more small tasks that can easily be scheduled.
[00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.000]   Well, you don't need all the small tasks
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.160]   on your plate to be scheduled.
[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.120]   You need them to be captured and configured
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.680]   in a way that you can make intelligent decisions
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.040]   about what's gonna happen this week
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.120]   and what's gonna happen this day.
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.100]   So if you potentially had a better handle
[00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.840]   over the small tasks, they're grouped,
[00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.540]   they're categorized, you automate some,
[00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.240]   they're in separate particular lists.
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.080]   You have certain times where you work on certain things.
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.800]   You can make decisions about which of these things
[00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:12.760]   do I need to get done this week
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.200]   and when am I gonna do them,
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.920]   that time blocking might actually work.
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.280]   So what might be happening here
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.040]   is that you're getting to your time outside of cases
[00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.720]   where you're presenting in court
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.160]   and then just feeling so overwhelmed
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.760]   that you just fall back to reactive mode.
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.600]   So I'm gonna say, and I don't know if this will work for you
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.160]   because again, I only have two paragraphs here,
[00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.160]   but I'm gonna say, lean in more into the configure step
[00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.000]   because you're telling me
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   you just have one large Word document
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.360]   where you try to keep track of everything.
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.800]   Lean more into the configure step,
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.080]   go watch that video and hear about
[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.540]   how I implement configure.
[00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:45.200]   And you might be able to get a better handle
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.920]   on all of this stuff so that you can get to
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.800]   a time blocking level of intentionality.
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.720]   It's not necessary and maybe not best for your job,
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:53.560]   but it might be.
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.520]   I wouldn't dismiss it so quickly.
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.100]   (upbeat music)
[00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.440]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
