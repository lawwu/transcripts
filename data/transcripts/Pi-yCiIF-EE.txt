[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:13.840]   - Welcome to the 57th edition of "Bogleheads on Investing."
[00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.840]   Today, our special guest is Dr. Derek Horsmeyer,
[00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.040]   professor of finance
[00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.840]   at George Mason University School of Business,
[00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.440]   who publishes a monthly "Wall Street Journal" column
[00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.520]   on interesting investment topics
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.120]   and also publishes for the CFA Institute
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.820]   and other major publications.
[00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.400]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:39.520]   Hi, everyone.
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:40.360]   My name is Rick Ferry
[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.080]   and I'm the host of "Bogleheads on Investing."
[00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.600]   This episode, as with all episodes,
[00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.160]   is brought to you by the John C. Bogle Center
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.880]   for Financial Literacy,
[00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.760]   a nonprofit organization that is building a world
[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.340]   of well-informed, capable, and empowered investors.
[00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.840]   Visit the Bogle Center at boglecenter.net,
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.520]   where you will find a treasure trove of information,
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.960]   including transcripts of these podcasts.
[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.380]   Before we begin today, I have two special announcements.
[00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.000]   The first announcement is the opening of registration
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.400]   for the 2023 "Bogleheads Investment Conference"
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.400]   to be held in Bethesda, Maryland,
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.480]   just north of Washington, D.C.,
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.180]   from Friday, October 13th through Sunday, October 15th.
[00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.260]   We've pulled together an action-packed agenda
[00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.340]   full of "Bogleheads" favorites,
[00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.420]   as well as well-known investment and personal finance experts
[00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.500]   who will be appearing at the event.
[00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.700]   This year, we have Charles Ellis, Paul Merriman,
[00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.580]   Clark Howard, Jonathan Clements,
[00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.700]   Michelle Singletary, J.L. Collins, Barry Ritzelt,
[00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.760]   and Wade Fowle to name just a few of our special speakers,
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.560]   along with "Bogleheads" favorites such as Mike Piper,
[00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.380]   Alan Roth, Christine Benz, Bill Bernstein,
[00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.720]   and I'll be there too.
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.040]   Go to boglecenter.net to see a full lineup
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.200]   and to register for this unique event.
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.640]   The second announcement is that there will be a guest host
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.680]   for this podcast for the next five episodes.
[00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.360]   Within the next week, my wife and I
[00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.360]   will be loading up the truck and the dog
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.520]   and hooking up the travel trailer
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.560]   and heading out for a five-month travel adventure.
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.140]   We'll head northwest to the Rocky Mountains,
[00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.520]   up into Canada, into the Yukon, over to Alaska,
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.160]   then turn north up to the Arctic Circle
[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.200]   and keep on going until we can't go any further,
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.280]   and then put our toes in the Arctic Ocean.
[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.140]   We'll then tour around in Alaska for about a month
[00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.360]   before heading back.
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.120]   And during that period of time,
[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.320]   your guest host on this show will be John Luskin.
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.880]   John has a fantastic lineup of guests,
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.940]   including Nobel laureate William Sharpe.
[00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.400]   I'll be back as the host in October
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.320]   right after attending the "Bogleheads" conference.
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.520]   Our special guest this month is Dr. Derek Horstmeyer,
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.600]   a professor of finance
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.480]   at George Mason University School of Business,
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.840]   where he specializes in corporate finance.
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.080]   He writes a monthly column for "The Wall Street Journal"
[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.880]   and the CFA Institute on cutting-edge research in finance.
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.760]   His work has also been cited in "Forbes," "Bloomberg,"
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.000]   "CNBC," "Fortune," and other outlets.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.640]   He's a dedicated teacher.
[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.040]   He helped create and lead
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.080]   the first student-managed investment fund
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.700]   at George Mason University,
[00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.320]   developed numerous programs at the college,
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.740]   such as the MS in Finance and CFA tracks,
[00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.960]   and currently serves as the director
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.280]   of the new financial planning
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.040]   and wealth management major at the university.
[00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.800]   One interesting aspect of the way Dr. Horstmeyer teaches
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.960]   is he encourages his students to do unique research
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.140]   and helps them get published.
[00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.680]   So with no further ado,
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.400]   let me introduce Dr. Derek Horstmeyer.
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.520]   Welcome to "Bogleheads on Investing."
[00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:00.600]   - Thank you, sir.
[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.080]   It's great to be here, and please call me Derek.
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.920]   - Thank you.
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.820]   Well, you've written on a lot of topics,
[00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:09.560]   and what intrigued me about your writing,
[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.360]   which I find all over the place,
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.800]   in the "Wall Street Journal" and CFA publications,
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.680]   I mean, your name is out there,
[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.760]   is the depth and the range of different topics
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:20.600]   that you talk about,
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.040]   and a lot of them have to do with individual investors
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.400]   and things that we should be aware of.
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.160]   Whether we take action or not, we should be aware of it.
[00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.560]   But the other thing that I'm very impressed with
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.660]   is that you bring your students into the conversation.
[00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.720]   You co-author a lot of these articles.
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.040]   So could you tell me, first of all,
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.760]   a little bit about yourself, your bio,
[00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:47.000]   and then how you bring your own students into this?
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.840]   - Sure.
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.360]   Yeah, to start off, obviously,
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.320]   I'm a professor at George Mason University.
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.540]   I've been there for about 10 years now.
[00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:56.840]   Before that, I was a PhD student at USC
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.480]   and Stanford University.
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.440]   And yeah, it's been great.
[00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.920]   It really is just a great feature
[00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.040]   that you get to reach out to students,
[00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:11.040]   and they are enthusiastic to help and to do this data work.
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.600]   And not only that,
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.680]   I get employers reaching out all the time saying,
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.400]   "Did John Smith actually co-author
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.480]   "this Wall Street Journal piece with you?"
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.700]   And it really opens doors for the students.
[00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.960]   It really is win-win to have these students
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.000]   kind of help with this work and do the data work
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.760]   and have a phenomenal thing to have on their resume.
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.000]   - Outside of being a professor,
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.200]   you're also an avid swimmer and a squash player
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:40.180]   and a devoted fan to everything that is Reno, Nevada?
[00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:41.760]   (laughing)
[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:42.640]   - Very true.
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:45.880]   Yeah, I am a squash player first.
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:49.520]   Obviously, your prime age for being a squash player
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.980]   is probably 25 to 30.
[00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:54.360]   So I'm a little bit over my prime there,
[00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.520]   but I still try and play as much as possible.
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.480]   But, whew, man, is that a hard sport.
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.120]   - I have a piece of advice.
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.240]   Try pickleball.
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.080]   - Oh, boy.
[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:08.000]   - All of us over the age of 50 are getting into pickleball.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.320]   So maybe you're getting there.
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:11.320]   - I'll probably be there soon.
[00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:12.160]   (laughing)
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:13.120]   - Okay, very good.
[00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:14.880]   Well, the way we're gonna do this today
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.400]   is I've broken down all of these articles
[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.000]   that you've written in the Wall Street Journal
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.440]   with your students and the articles
[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.000]   that you wrote for the CFA Institute
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.220]   and their publications.
[00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:28.840]   And there was literally dozens of them on your website,
[00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.040]   derrickhorstmeyer.com.
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:33.600]   There's just a laundry list of all these articles
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:36.760]   you publish, one a month in the Wall Street Journal,
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:40.120]   one a month for the CFA Institute, plus others.
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:44.520]   And I categorize them by individual investments,
[00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:48.200]   portfolio management, taxes,
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.960]   and then the last one I call investor behavior.
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.420]   So four different categories I put them into
[00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:54.560]   for this interview.
[00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.520]   And so I'm gonna start with investments.
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.240]   So under investments, they are individual
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:03.080]   investment categories, for example.
[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:04.440]   And I'm gonna throw this out there
[00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:07.120]   because this is something that I have been big on
[00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:08.500]   for a long time.
[00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:11.680]   High-yield bonds.
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.520]   Do they belong in a portfolio?
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.600]   Do they not belong in a portfolio?
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:20.600]   On the Boglehead site, you will find the camp is divided.
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:24.360]   I am on the side of yes, they can add value.
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:28.120]   What did your research say about high-yield bonds?
[00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:29.680]   The title of the article was,
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:32.200]   do junk bonds pay off in the long run?
[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:35.560]   And we found in general, yeah,
[00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:39.600]   they're basically in line with the Sharpe ratio
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:41.000]   that you would expect.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.960]   The funds that we were looking at were mutual funds
[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:47.640]   and ETFs that had the word high-yield or junk bond
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:51.360]   or other names like that in the title of the fund.
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:55.720]   So we didn't look at the underlying D rated or C rated
[00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:58.280]   or BBB minus rated debt itself,
[00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:01.120]   but the fund that was carrying it.
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:06.120]   And in general, what we found was comparable returns
[00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:11.320]   to the S&P 500 with a little bit lower correlation.
[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:16.120]   So there is some diversification benefits here
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:19.320]   and a little bit lower volatility.
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:23.160]   So yes, it did seem on the whole
[00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:28.160]   that this could add some value to your portfolio.
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.840]   But again, don't expect that this is gonna be
[00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:33.120]   a groundbreaking investment
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:38.120]   that's gonna outperform the S&P by a significant amount.
[00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:40.560]   For instance, to quantify what I'm saying,
[00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:43.640]   what we found was over this 30 year period
[00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:45.560]   when we could study these things,
[00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:49.920]   the S&P delivered 7.8% and the high-yield bond fund
[00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:54.680]   delivered 7.1% with a little bit lower volatility.
[00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:58.400]   - Some people will say, don't buy credit risk,
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:03.400]   just buy treasuries and take your credit risk with equity.
[00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:06.040]   How do you feel about that strategy?
[00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:09.480]   - Yeah, that's an interesting point.
[00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:12.840]   So I think this research would highlight that, yeah,
[00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:17.360]   taking some credit risk in the bond market is appropriate
[00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:22.060]   just because again, you're getting near S&P 500 returns
[00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:23.680]   over the long run,
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:28.680]   but it doesn't have a perfect correlation with the S&P.
[00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:30.960]   So again, what it's doing
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:34.320]   is slightly diversifying your positions.
[00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:37.960]   We also noticed it had less crash risk.
[00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:42.680]   So we define that as did the S&P 500 drop 4%
[00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:43.760]   in a month or more?
[00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:47.760]   And we found that high-yield bonds had a lot less
[00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:51.560]   of these big drops on a monthly basis.
[00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:52.560]   - Interesting.
[00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:54.320]   Well, let's go into another area
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:59.320]   of mostly non-investment grade fixed income.
[00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:01.120]   And this is preferred stock.
[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:04.060]   This is another thing that I personally own
[00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:07.100]   in a fund, in an ETF, an index fund.
[00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:08.120]   A small amount.
[00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:09.840]   I've owned it for many years.
[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:13.120]   I also used to manage preferred stock portfolios.
[00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:16.200]   It's kind of unusual because it's such a small market,
[00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:18.880]   but I always felt that there was something there
[00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:20.620]   and there's not a lot of research on this,
[00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:22.400]   but you did do an article
[00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:23.860]   and you did do some research on this.
[00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:25.720]   So can you talk about it?
[00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:26.560]   - Sure.
[00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:27.380]   Yes, indeed.
[00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:28.320]   So again, you're right.
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:30.640]   There's not a lot of funds out there
[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:32.240]   that are concentrating on this.
[00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:37.140]   And so we were able to look back at 10 years of data
[00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:41.820]   from basically 2010 to 2020 on preferred shares.
[00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:45.300]   And we found that in general,
[00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:48.940]   these came in around the returns
[00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:52.100]   and volatility of long-term bonds.
[00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:53.740]   So to put numbers to that,
[00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:56.480]   over the past 10-year period,
[00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:59.660]   long-term bonds delivered about 7%.
[00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:03.080]   Preferred stocks delivered about 7.2%
[00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:07.480]   and with a little bit less volatility than long-term bonds.
[00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:12.480]   So again, an appropriate thing to add to a portfolio
[00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:17.000]   and definitely to an equity portfolio.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.520]   But again, we didn't see some strange
[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:20.920]   out of equilibrium behavior
[00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:25.080]   where preferred stocks absolutely knocked out of the park.
[00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:27.080]   But again, I will say this caveat,
[00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:28.840]   all of this data that we were looking at
[00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:31.120]   was a 10-year period because again,
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:33.920]   we couldn't find any major funds
[00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:37.400]   that went back before the mid 2000s.
[00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:40.400]   - And one other thing about preferred stock
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:45.400]   is there is a tax benefit to it for taxable investors.
[00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:48.120]   Was that part of your,
[00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:49.320]   first explain what that is
[00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:52.840]   and then was it part of this calculation?
[00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:54.200]   - So yeah, very good point.
[00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:58.480]   We looked at pre-tax returns
[00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:01.440]   and we compared everything on pre-tax return basis,
[00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:06.440]   not with the post-tax benefit of preferred stock.
[00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:09.160]   - So when the other thing about preferred stock
[00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:13.320]   that I personally like is I own it in my taxable account
[00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:16.720]   and a lot of the dividend yield that comes in
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:18.760]   is treated as a long-term capital gain
[00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:20.800]   because it's a stock dividend.
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:25.000]   It may be more tax efficient than owning a corporate bond.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.080]   And again, it's a complicated asset class,
[00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.880]   it's not widely followed.
[00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:30.560]   I do wanna say one thing before we move on
[00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:32.760]   is that all the things we're talking about today
[00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:34.440]   are not investment recommendations.
[00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:36.680]   We're just discussing these things.
[00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:38.840]   I don't want people who are listening here to get confused
[00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:41.000]   that we're actually making investment recommendations
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:41.920]   because we're not.
[00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:42.760]   - Of course.
[00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:45.160]   - All right, well, and then there was this one other area
[00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:47.160]   which I found very interesting.
[00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:51.520]   It affects a lot of people across a lot of different states
[00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:55.640]   and that is municipal bond performance by state.
[00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:59.920]   And I didn't realize how much of a difference there was.
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:00.760]   - Very true.
[00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:02.480]   Yeah, we were surprised by these results as well.
[00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:07.480]   We went out there and collected data on muni bond offerings.
[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:12.080]   Obviously, we're focusing here on the big states
[00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:16.360]   that have muni bond mutual funds or ETFs.
[00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:21.360]   So we were able to get about 15 different state offerings
[00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:27.120]   and calculate returns based on these different state funds.
[00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:32.120]   And in some cases, buying a muni offering
[00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:36.200]   for a particular state makes sense
[00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:39.000]   over the past 10, 15 years of data that we have,
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:44.360]   even if you don't get obviously the tax benefit
[00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:46.280]   of living in that state.
[00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:48.760]   So for instance, to put numbers to this,
[00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:53.760]   Colorado and Missouri over the past 10, 15 years
[00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:58.520]   have averaged about a 4% rate of return
[00:13:58.520 --> 00:13:59.960]   over that time period.
[00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:04.640]   And Maryland on the opposite end returned about 3%.
[00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:06.360]   So there's about a 1% spread there.
[00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:08.840]   And again, this is pre-tax.
[00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:12.960]   Yeah, interesting to see that you get this big spread
[00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:15.620]   and it's not totally explained by risk
[00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:18.560]   just because we didn't see any significant differences
[00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:20.560]   between Colorado and Maryland
[00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:22.920]   in the volatility of these things.
[00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:26.080]   - Yeah, obviously it's not due to Colorado funds
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:28.120]   having lower fees than Maryland funds.
[00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:30.240]   I mean, you factored that, correct?
[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:31.760]   - Yep, we factored that in.
[00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:36.400]   One idea that we had, and again, it didn't fully pan out,
[00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:40.200]   maybe it could be the age of the population.
[00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:43.720]   So you can imagine maybe there's a bit more wealth
[00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:48.000]   in places like Maryland and a bit older individuals.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.280]   And so they all rush into the immunity bond offerings
[00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:55.780]   and push rates of return down.
[00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:59.880]   So that was one theory, but that didn't kind of line up
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:02.920]   with all the other states that we had in this data set.
[00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:05.520]   - And taxes, obviously, if you're in California
[00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:08.600]   and you're paying 13% tax versus Texas
[00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:12.600]   and you're paying no taxes, that didn't explain it either?
[00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:14.000]   - That didn't explain it either.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.120]   From what I can tell, what we looked at,
[00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:20.840]   Florida was really high up on the return list.
[00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:25.680]   And so I think Florida had something like a 3.9%,
[00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:27.480]   something like that, rate of return
[00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:29.580]   over the past 10, 15 years.
[00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:32.320]   And to the best of my knowledge,
[00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:35.200]   Florida's a pretty darn low tax state.
[00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:36.920]   - That's why a lot of people move there.
[00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:37.760]   - Yeah.
[00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:39.200]   - And I'll ask one more question about this,
[00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:44.080]   and that is, is it a factor of the makeup of the portfolio,
[00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:47.920]   whether a lot of hospital bonds in Maryland
[00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:50.880]   versus general obligation bonds in Colorado, right?
[00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:52.160]   I have that backwards.
[00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:53.400]   - No, no, that's a great thing.
[00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:56.040]   We didn't dive into the actual holdings.
[00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:58.540]   But again, we did look at the volatility.
[00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:02.080]   The volatility was pretty close across the whole spectrum
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:06.240]   of 15 different states that we looked at.
[00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:07.480]   - So the volatility was the same,
[00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:09.720]   it was only the performance that was different.
[00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:11.720]   - The performance was, and we're not talking, again,
[00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:15.240]   about huge spreads, but a one percentage point spread
[00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:16.800]   per year is pretty big.
[00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:18.520]   And again, that's the top performer
[00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:20.720]   against the bottom performer.
[00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:22.720]   - Well, let's go into another topic,
[00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:24.840]   and this has to do with inflation.
[00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:27.520]   So we've had a bout of inflation here,
[00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:31.240]   and everyone is wondering where should I be putting my money
[00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:34.960]   if I want to hedge against inflation?
[00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:37.840]   And you've written a couple of articles about this.
[00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:40.560]   - Yes, it's always a fascinating topic.
[00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:42.160]   How do you preserve your money?
[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:43.760]   Or how do you just have something
[00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:46.520]   that just correlates positively with inflation?
[00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:49.720]   Obviously, a lot of people piled into TIPS,
[00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:51.560]   Treasury Inflation Protected Securities,
[00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:54.280]   and then they had a horrible 2022
[00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:57.040]   because the ramp up in price happened
[00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:02.040]   at the very beginning of 2022, or even end of 2021.
[00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:05.760]   And so you think the things that are gonna protect you
[00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:06.840]   don't do as well.
[00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:09.040]   And so we looked at this.
[00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:12.880]   Not surprisingly, S&P does really poorly
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:15.200]   during inflationary periods.
[00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:18.440]   Again, we looked from 1970.
[00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:19.960]   So I should be very clear,
[00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:24.160]   this data came from 1970 to 2021.
[00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:28.720]   So before the most recent big bout of inflation.
[00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:31.360]   Something else we saw, not surprisingly,
[00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:34.480]   real estate actually hedges very well
[00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:38.240]   and did very well during high inflationary periods.
[00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:40.520]   This is tangible real estate, I should be very clear.
[00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:43.200]   Not REITs, but tangible real estate.
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:47.040]   And not surprisingly, oil, gold, and silver
[00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:48.600]   were the best performers
[00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:51.240]   over the high inflationary periods.
[00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:53.080]   And the two worst performers,
[00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:56.120]   the S&P 500 and intermediate bonds.
[00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:58.160]   - Well, that wasn't good for last year.
[00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:59.400]   - Exactly, yeah.
[00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:03.040]   So this data was up to 2020, 2021.
[00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:06.800]   And then obviously we saw it play out exactly like that
[00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:09.560]   or close to like that last year.
[00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:11.280]   - You know what's funny about last year,
[00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:14.920]   people who may have bought gold
[00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:17.280]   at the beginning of last year
[00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:20.320]   when inflation was coming back were disappointed
[00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:22.320]   that it didn't do well.
[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:25.880]   And I think you had to look back
[00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:28.320]   and see what the price of gold did
[00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:30.680]   as soon as the pandemic hit.
[00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:32.280]   Everybody started hoarding gold.
[00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:36.440]   So the price of gold shot up $400, $500 an ounce.
[00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:37.600]   So as soon as the pandemic hit,
[00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:38.800]   and there wasn't any inflation.
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:41.360]   It was probably deflation during that period of time.
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:44.320]   And then when inflation came rolling around
[00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:47.560]   and gold didn't do anything, it actually went down.
[00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:51.200]   And I was telling people, well, you already had the gain.
[00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:54.680]   The gain occurred before there was even inflation.
[00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:56.480]   Not that people were anticipating inflation.
[00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:59.000]   They were just hoarding gold at that time too.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.720]   Because of what was going on in the world,
[00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:04.840]   real estate does a good job of hedging inflation,
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:08.080]   but not if interest rates are also going up
[00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:11.200]   and you have a pandemic and occupancy rates
[00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:14.160]   start going down and you start seeing foreclosures
[00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:15.920]   and a banking crisis all at the same time.
[00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:20.920]   So it's period specific, but in general, in general.
[00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:23.160]   In general, yeah, you're exactly right.
[00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:26.000]   There's a lot going on in the past three years.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.680]   And so we can't just isolate it to inflation.
[00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:31.200]   Let's go on to the next part of this,
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:33.160]   which we started to work on a little bit,
[00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:35.480]   which is portfolio management.
[00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:37.000]   And you've written a lot of articles
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.280]   about portfolio management, both active and passive.
[00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:45.520]   And I first want to talk about an article that you wrote,
[00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:48.120]   which I thought was very interesting.
[00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:50.760]   Is it better to roll your own, pardon my French,
[00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:53.000]   roll your own portfolio by buying
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.400]   a few broad market index funds
[00:19:56.400 --> 00:20:01.120]   than it is to use a one and done target date fund?
[00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:05.160]   As a lot of people would happily create
[00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:06.680]   their own index fund portfolio,
[00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:09.440]   or if it's easier, use a target date fund.
[00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:11.680]   I mean, what did you find there?
[00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:15.520]   Yeah, this obviously takes some effort,
[00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:19.040]   but we looked back and said, are you getting fleeced
[00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:21.920]   on your target date fund, for lack of a better word?
[00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:24.080]   And so we said, could you construct your own
[00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:25.280]   and do better here?
[00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:29.360]   And what we found was in general,
[00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:31.160]   you could construct your own
[00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:35.880]   for about 10 basis points less per year, right?
[00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:38.880]   So you're saving 10 basis points by constructing your own.
[00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:41.360]   And obviously that takes a bit of effort.
[00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:43.080]   So again, to put kind of numbers to this,
[00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:45.840]   we were looking at the average target date fund
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:49.480]   was charging you about 30 basis points a year
[00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:54.480]   and using the same fund family bond and equity holdings,
[00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:58.320]   you could create that same portfolio for 20 basis points.
[00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:00.760]   So they're charging you 30 basis points.
[00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:03.900]   You could go in there and using the same thing
[00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:07.400]   that they're using, you could do it for 20 basis points.
[00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:11.320]   So they're kind of taking 10 basis points from you
[00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:15.280]   for the management and for shifting it over time.
[00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:16.400]   That's kind of what we found.
[00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:19.080]   And we found that the longer you went out
[00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:21.040]   on the target date spectrum,
[00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:23.920]   say the 2060 target date funds,
[00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:26.280]   those are the ones where they were charging the most.
[00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:27.480]   Oh, really?
[00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:29.960]   Interesting enough, they're charging the young kids.
[00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:31.160]   More money.
[00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:33.520]   Yeah, more money to manage these things.
[00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:35.720]   And so this adds up over time.
[00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:38.400]   We kind of calculated if you did it yourself
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:40.400]   over a 10 year period,
[00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:43.520]   you would have an extra 3% return
[00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:44.880]   if you just did it yourself.
[00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:48.320]   Oh, wow, that's fairly significant.
[00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:49.360]   Yeah.
[00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:52.520]   Interesting offshoot of what you just said
[00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:57.240]   that the fund companies are charging you 10 basis points.
[00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:59.160]   Some maybe a little bit more
[00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:01.400]   to do the portfolio management.
[00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:05.400]   So you could go to a mutual fund company,
[00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:08.000]   a Vanguard or whomever.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.160]   And for 10 basis points,
[00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:13.680]   you can get a pretty darn good portfolio managed for you.
[00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:16.600]   And I kind of tongue in cheek, look at that and say,
[00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:19.920]   well, why are investment advisors charging 100 basis points
[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:21.920]   to do the same thing?
[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:23.960]   Yeah, very good point.
[00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:25.760]   Yeah, you wonder how they stay in business.
[00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:27.920]   Well, they stay in business because people think
[00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:29.720]   they're getting what's called value added.
[00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:31.920]   But anyway, that's a different topic.
[00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:34.680]   All right, now we're gonna get into
[00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:39.160]   the active versus passive debate a little here.
[00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:41.920]   And you've written quite a bit about active management.
[00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:45.480]   And we have a three fund portfolio,
[00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:47.040]   Boglehead portfolios.
[00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:51.800]   You refer to them as lazy portfolios in your article
[00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:54.720]   versus what's called a valuation based,
[00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:56.720]   which if you could explain what that is,
[00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:57.760]   but it's active management.
[00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:00.440]   So how do they compare?
[00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:01.280]   Yeah, very good.
[00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:03.440]   So this was one that just came out a month ago
[00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:04.480]   for the Wall Street Journal.
[00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:07.040]   And it won't surprise anyone in this group
[00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:09.520]   that time in the market doesn't work.
[00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:10.560]   What we looked at this one
[00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:13.960]   was the age old Fama versus Schiller debate.
[00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:17.360]   They both won Nobel prizes 10 years ago
[00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:19.040]   for their work in market efficiency.
[00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:22.080]   Eugene Fama comes down on the efficient side
[00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:24.240]   and Schiller would always say,
[00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:27.520]   you could time the market based on the P/E ratios
[00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:30.160]   or his CAPE ratio.
[00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:32.120]   And so what we did was we said,
[00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:34.040]   well, does that still hold true?
[00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:38.800]   We looked at how the P/E ratio changes in our market.
[00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:43.160]   And we kind of followed his advice from back in the 70s,
[00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:48.160]   which said, if the P/E ratio is very high at 20 or above,
[00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:52.760]   you should be shift over to a bond portfolio.
[00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:56.080]   We used a 70% bonds, 30% equity.
[00:23:56.080 --> 00:24:00.680]   And if the P/E ratio for the market goes down below 12,
[00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:02.080]   then you should shift over to equities.
[00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:05.740]   And again, 70% equities, 30% bonds.
[00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:06.880]   And we tested the strategy.
[00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:07.720]   Does this work?
[00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:10.240]   Does this help you on a risk adjusted basis?
[00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:12.040]   - Relative to what portfolio?
[00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:14.040]   The passive, but what was the passive portfolio?
[00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:16.400]   - The passive portfolio was just 50/50.
[00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:17.840]   - Ah, good, okay, thank you.
[00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:19.320]   - It was just 50/50.
[00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:21.920]   So if you formed a 50/50 portfolio,
[00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:23.880]   how would you compare against this?
[00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:27.440]   And not surprisingly, hasn't done well.
[00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:29.960]   Interestingly enough, before 1950,
[00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:32.060]   this actually juiced returns a little bit,
[00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:35.560]   but since then, nope, you'd be underperforming.
[00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:36.960]   And again, I think to most people,
[00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:38.260]   this wouldn't surprise anyone,
[00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:40.760]   just because basically using this strategy,
[00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:45.220]   you would have been out of equities since 1995,
[00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:46.060]   for the most part.
[00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:48.120]   You would have been really out of equities.
[00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:50.920]   And obviously we've seen crazy strong growth
[00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:53.080]   in equities since 1995.
[00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:54.200]   So yeah, it was interesting.
[00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:58.160]   We also updated this and tried to move the valuation points
[00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:01.640]   so that it made sense in a post-2000 world.
[00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:03.840]   And still we saw no results.
[00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:04.720]   - Interesting.
[00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:07.200]   - Yeah, we kind of biased it and moved things up.
[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:09.240]   Still no risk-adjusted returns.
[00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:12.800]   I follow this strategy that Schiller lined out
[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:15.080]   and partially won a Nobel Prize for.
[00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:17.940]   - It's interesting that you said something,
[00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:19.420]   prior to 1950, it worked,
[00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:23.120]   because it seems like market structures do evolve.
[00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:28.260]   When Fama, French, came out with their three-factor model
[00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:31.700]   showing that the determinants of portfolio return
[00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:33.980]   were both the market beta,
[00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:37.820]   the size of the stocks in the portfolio,
[00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:40.500]   and whether they had high price to book
[00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:42.460]   or low price to book, basically.
[00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:46.800]   And since that time, at least the size portion
[00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:49.040]   hasn't really materialized.
[00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:49.880]   - Oh yeah.
[00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:53.240]   - Again, they looked at data going back prior to 1994
[00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:54.300]   and it worked really well.
[00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:56.440]   But then from '94 coming forward,
[00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:57.800]   it just hasn't seemed,
[00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:00.440]   at least the size premium hasn't worked.
[00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:04.080]   The value versus growth has been very difficult lately,
[00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:07.080]   but we think it should work, I think, in the long-term,
[00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:09.040]   because there's sort of a fundamental reason
[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:10.400]   why it should work.
[00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:13.440]   But what's interesting is that the dynamics of the market
[00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:16.800]   do seem to change over the long-term,
[00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:21.160]   as taxation on buybacks change,
[00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:22.440]   and dividend structure change.
[00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:24.220]   I mean, all these things change,
[00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:26.160]   causing companies to react,
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:29.440]   and it causes changes in the marketplace.
[00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:30.960]   - Nope, very true, very true.
[00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:35.500]   Yeah, it's been a bad 15 years for small caps.
[00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:38.280]   Everyone swore that you could juice returns
[00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:39.720]   by going with small caps,
[00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:41.640]   and small caps haven't done well.
[00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:44.680]   And obviously, up until a year ago,
[00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:46.880]   value stocks obviously didn't do well.
[00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:49.240]   Growth had this great decade,
[00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:52.760]   obviously due to low interest rates and a few other things.
[00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:54.120]   - Well, talking about large and small,
[00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:55.640]   let's talk about another paper you wrote,
[00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:57.640]   which is, look, if I'm going to invest
[00:26:57.640 --> 00:26:59.760]   in a actively managed fund,
[00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:02.960]   should I invest in a large actively managed fund,
[00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:06.520]   or a small actively managed fund?
[00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:08.680]   Intuitively, I'd say, well, I want a small fund
[00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:11.320]   where the manager is maneuverability.
[00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:12.820]   But you did some work on this.
[00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:16.240]   - Yeah, yeah, it was interesting to find
[00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:19.260]   that your biggest actively managed funds
[00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:23.000]   actually did better than the small funds,
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.640]   on average, after taxes.
[00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:27.880]   This was a little interesting to us,
[00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:29.480]   'cause we thought, you're right,
[00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:32.000]   you would go with the small fund
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.080]   just because it had more maneuverability, like you said,
[00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:39.360]   or ability to fly below the radar
[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:42.920]   and maybe not have their strategies mimicked,
[00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:47.800]   and a big fund would just be kind of lumbering and bloated.
[00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:49.360]   But we didn't really find that.
[00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:53.320]   We found that small funds had more turnover
[00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:56.020]   and therefore were less tax-efficient,
[00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:58.460]   and while the big guys didn't trade as much,
[00:27:58.460 --> 00:28:01.080]   that actually worked to your advantage.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   - Well, go on to another way
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.600]   of picking actively managed funds,
[00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:08.940]   and this is, do we go with the fund manager
[00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:11.360]   who's been around for 35 years,
[00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:13.600]   or do we hire the fund manager
[00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:17.200]   who is right out of one of the Ivy League colleges,
[00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:18.320]   30 years old?
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:22.800]   How does age and experience work in this marketplace?
[00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:25.000]   - Yeah, again, this is for active mutual funds.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.760]   We looked at 20 years of data
[00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:30.520]   and looked at how did the short tenure managers
[00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:33.680]   compare against the long tenure individuals,
[00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:36.080]   and I don't think it would surprise anyone.
[00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:40.640]   The long-tenured fund managers were, on average,
[00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:44.640]   on a post-tax basis, a little bit better than your rookies,
[00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:49.560]   but they didn't have that right tail to their distribution.
[00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:52.440]   So in other words, they didn't hit a lot of home runs.
[00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:54.580]   They were just kind of steady eddies.
[00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:56.520]   They kind of just delivered you
[00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:59.320]   a very close return to the benchmark.
[00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:02.280]   Some would call that almost closet indexing.
[00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:04.040]   That's a term that people have thrown out
[00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:05.880]   at some active fund managers
[00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:08.760]   that are just trying to follow the index
[00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:11.320]   when they should be doing more active management.
[00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:15.080]   And then the rookies, on average, underperformed,
[00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:17.560]   but every once in a while,
[00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:20.800]   you had a rookie that just did very well,
[00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:23.200]   knocked out of the park, took on a lot of risk,
[00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:24.540]   but it worked out.
[00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:27.360]   So if you kind of want big and boring,
[00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:30.920]   you go with the individual that's long-tenured.
[00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:34.440]   If you want to take on some risk and maybe have a winner,
[00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:35.360]   then you go with the rookie,
[00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:38.000]   but on average, they underperformed.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.040]   - We talked about a lot of investment strategies
[00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:42.000]   of the active managers versus the passive
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:45.680]   and how you might try to choose an active fund
[00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:49.400]   that might outperform experience of the manager,
[00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:53.740]   the size of the fund, valuation models,
[00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:58.180]   but how important, I guess the elephant in the room,
[00:29:58.180 --> 00:30:00.380]   is fees, fees.
[00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:02.080]   There's been studies out there.
[00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:04.580]   What did you find about fees?
[00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:07.160]   - Sure, it's not gonna surprise anyone, right?
[00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:09.640]   I should say that all of these past results,
[00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:11.020]   doesn't matter if you're a rookie
[00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:12.880]   or a long-tenured manager,
[00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:15.120]   you're still underperforming the benchmark
[00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:16.540]   over a 10-year period.
[00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:17.660]   Obviously, to this group,
[00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:19.560]   that's not gonna surprise anyone.
[00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:21.140]   Now, when we looked at fees,
[00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:25.420]   fees was the single determinant of long-run return.
[00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:28.500]   It's your turnover and then your fees.
[00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:30.220]   It's how tax-efficient you are
[00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:31.460]   and then what you're charging.
[00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:35.740]   And we looked at the most egregious mutual funds out there
[00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:36.580]   in terms of fees.
[00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:41.180]   Are they charging more than 1.5% per year?
[00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:43.660]   And these were just the worst performers.
[00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:46.940]   It's amazing these funds still exist out there,
[00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:48.160]   but there's quite a few of them
[00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:53.160]   that are still charging 1.5% or more to manage a fund.
[00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:58.420]   And not only did they underperform by 1.5%,
[00:30:58.420 --> 00:31:02.460]   they underperformed by about 2% on average.
[00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:05.500]   So not only do they charge you a lot,
[00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:09.380]   they did worse than their fee structure would suggest.
[00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:10.420]   - Interesting.
[00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:12.760]   - Again, obviously, I'm preaching to the choir here,
[00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:17.260]   but if somebody's charging you 1.5% to manage something,
[00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:19.460]   you just don't touch it with a 10-foot pole.
[00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:22.340]   - Yeah, I think that the people who are paying 1.5%
[00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:24.420]   probably don't even know they're paying 1.5%
[00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:27.660]   because it's not something that they pay attention to.
[00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:29.340]   - True, or these are being crammed
[00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:32.100]   in really bad 401(k) offerings.
[00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:33.340]   - Oh, is that right?
[00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:34.960]   - Yeah, I haven't written on this,
[00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:36.620]   but I have done some consulting work
[00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:39.820]   and looked at very small companies
[00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:42.900]   just get the dregs of the 401(k) offerings.
[00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:45.580]   And a lot of times these awful,
[00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:47.980]   awful offerings are crammed in there.
[00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:50.700]   - All right, now we're gonna get into a couple
[00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:55.300]   of controversial active management strategies.
[00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:57.740]   And it'll be the last two questions on this.
[00:31:57.740 --> 00:32:01.620]   ESG, environmental, social, and governance.
[00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:04.660]   A lot of information out there on this.
[00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:08.060]   Big fight in Washington, D.C. now over this.
[00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:10.940]   Is it alpha enhancing?
[00:32:10.940 --> 00:32:13.420]   Are they really helping the world?
[00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:14.820]   Is it just a fad?
[00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:16.260]   What did you find out?
[00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:19.700]   - Yep, the evidence goes back and forth.
[00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:24.180]   And in general, ESG funds are just gonna probably
[00:32:24.180 --> 00:32:26.660]   match the benchmark over the long run.
[00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:31.360]   I know energy has had a good year, past year.
[00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:35.620]   So ESG underperformed during that period.
[00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:38.620]   But we kind of looked at a different tact and said,
[00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:41.820]   what are you really getting with ESG
[00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:45.180]   in terms of your correlation coefficients?
[00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:47.140]   What is it moving with?
[00:32:47.140 --> 00:32:49.020]   Like what risks are you exposed to?
[00:32:49.020 --> 00:32:54.020]   And what we found was because when an ESG portfolio
[00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:57.460]   is formed, they need to cut something.
[00:32:57.460 --> 00:32:59.340]   They are obviously cutting energy.
[00:32:59.340 --> 00:33:01.540]   They need to add something to make up for that.
[00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:04.420]   And so not surprisingly, a lot of tech companies
[00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:07.660]   out there have good ESG ratings.
[00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:11.220]   So what we found was if you invest in an ESG fund,
[00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:14.780]   you have a higher correlation with tech
[00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:18.260]   and you have a higher correlation with the Russell 2000.
[00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:22.540]   You're taking on more small cap risk and more tech risk.
[00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:23.380]   - I see.
[00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:27.300]   - And because of that, you actually had
[00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:30.180]   close to the same level of correlation
[00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:31.860]   with the change in oil prices,
[00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:33.940]   which was kind of another thing.
[00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:37.060]   ESG funds were about the same level of correlation
[00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:39.700]   with underlying price of oil.
[00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:41.180]   - Correlated with the price of oil.
[00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:42.740]   So if the price of oil goes up,
[00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:45.100]   everybody's looking at alternative energies, right?
[00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:47.700]   So maybe some of these funds
[00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:50.420]   that specialize in that do better.
[00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:51.260]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:55.020]   So we found the S&P had a correlation of 0.22
[00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:59.500]   with a change in oil prices and ESG funds on average 0.23.
[00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:01.980]   Little bit higher correlation to oil.
[00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:03.980]   - Interesting.
[00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:05.300]   All right, we're gonna get into the last one
[00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:06.980]   about active management
[00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:09.060]   and it's the one on everybody's mind
[00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:11.420]   or I should say on everybody's computer.
[00:34:11.420 --> 00:34:15.820]   And that is AI, artificial intelligence.
[00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:17.820]   Is this the new active management?
[00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:22.820]   Is there hope for buying a fund that employs AI
[00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:26.300]   and this will outperform?
[00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:28.100]   Is this it?
[00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:29.220]   - We did a deep dive.
[00:34:29.220 --> 00:34:32.940]   We got access to one particular AI fund.
[00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:34.220]   Even the person that was running it
[00:34:34.220 --> 00:34:37.140]   couldn't explain kind of just said it's a black box
[00:34:37.140 --> 00:34:39.140]   and it's trained on this past data
[00:34:39.140 --> 00:34:40.780]   and I don't know what it's doing.
[00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:42.020]   And it would try and predict
[00:34:42.020 --> 00:34:43.940]   and move in and out of the market.
[00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:47.300]   And this particular one actually did an okay job.
[00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:49.620]   It had much higher risk.
[00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:51.740]   Sharp ratio was pretty comparable
[00:34:51.740 --> 00:34:54.700]   but it was moving in and out on a daily basis.
[00:34:54.700 --> 00:34:56.620]   We're trying to figure out what is going on
[00:34:56.620 --> 00:34:57.740]   inside this black box
[00:34:57.740 --> 00:35:00.140]   that's making it sell out on these days.
[00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:03.180]   And we got some insight, but we couldn't totally get it.
[00:35:03.180 --> 00:35:06.660]   - Well, you're not supposed to be smarter than humans.
[00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:08.740]   - Exactly, exactly.
[00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:11.260]   And so, yeah, this one was taking on excessive risk
[00:35:11.260 --> 00:35:12.300]   and it did pretty well.
[00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:14.020]   But again, on a sharp ratio basis
[00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:16.700]   kind of matched the S&P 500.
[00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:17.540]   But you're right.
[00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:18.580]   If AI is gonna work,
[00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:21.140]   then all the AIs will just be trading
[00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:23.620]   and then they'll--
[00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:24.460]   - Then it won't work.
[00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:25.540]   - Then it won't work, exactly.
[00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:27.020]   - Yeah, it works until it doesn't.
[00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:27.900]   - It works until it doesn't.
[00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:29.860]   There's an equilibrium, it has to be.
[00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:31.140]   - All right, let's get off of this topic
[00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:32.700]   of portfolio management
[00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:36.660]   and get into something that we all love and that's taxes.
[00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:40.460]   We've all just recently paid our taxes or did our taxes.
[00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:44.700]   So we've realized that funds,
[00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:47.700]   some of them distribute capital gains
[00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:48.540]   at the end of the year,
[00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:51.060]   even in years where the markets are down.
[00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:54.180]   We realize that some funds are distributing dividends
[00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:58.260]   and maybe some of the dividends are not too tax efficient.
[00:35:58.260 --> 00:36:01.700]   And we learn a lot about what we own
[00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:04.340]   if we really start to study our tax returns
[00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:08.260]   because it can really affect our after-tax returns.
[00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:12.180]   So you did a lot of work on taxes
[00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:14.460]   and mutual funds and ETFs.
[00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:17.260]   Let's talk first about turnover within a fund
[00:36:17.260 --> 00:36:19.180]   and how does that affect taxes?
[00:36:19.180 --> 00:36:22.980]   - Sure, I've always told my students this
[00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:24.140]   and I've always been told this.
[00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:27.620]   Well, you should just look to the turnover of a fund
[00:36:27.620 --> 00:36:30.540]   and that'll tell you how tax efficient it is.
[00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:32.900]   So we kind of took a step back and said,
[00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:33.860]   well, how true is that?
[00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:35.900]   Can you just look at the turnover
[00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:38.500]   of an actively managed fund or even an index fund
[00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:41.300]   and does that predict how tax efficient it is?
[00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:44.740]   And it was pretty much a muddled picture.
[00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:47.300]   Some funds were better and some funds weren't,
[00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:49.860]   but on average, it was kind of just a wash.
[00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:53.260]   And so what I mean by that was we separated
[00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:55.900]   within Ask Classes, we looked at high turnover funds
[00:36:55.900 --> 00:36:59.020]   and low turnover funds and on average,
[00:36:59.020 --> 00:37:01.580]   they kind of just have the same tax efficiency.
[00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:03.860]   And so, yeah, we kind of started thinking,
[00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:07.220]   there's a lot that's captured by a turnover measure.
[00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:08.620]   It doesn't separate out,
[00:37:08.620 --> 00:37:11.300]   are you trading short-term capital gains?
[00:37:11.300 --> 00:37:13.300]   Are you incurring long-term capital gains?
[00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:15.980]   Are you maybe trying to tax loss harvest?
[00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:17.420]   All these things that are going
[00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:19.820]   into the underlying turnover measure.
[00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:24.220]   And so that is kind of lost in one simple measure.
[00:37:24.220 --> 00:37:27.460]   And so that was kind of our ending conclusion.
[00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:31.260]   You can't really see that with a turnover measure.
[00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:32.380]   - Interesting.
[00:37:32.380 --> 00:37:36.140]   You did do work on the ETF structure
[00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:39.020]   versus the open-end mutual fund structure,
[00:37:39.020 --> 00:37:41.660]   the traditional open-end mutual fund structure.
[00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:43.100]   And you did come to a different conclusion
[00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:47.100]   about ETFs versus traditional open-end mutual funds.
[00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:47.940]   - Yes, indeed.
[00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:49.860]   Again, another thing that I've always been told
[00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:52.420]   is ETFs are more tax efficient,
[00:37:52.420 --> 00:37:55.020]   but I've never heard a quantifier,
[00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:57.420]   literally how much more tax efficient they are.
[00:37:57.420 --> 00:38:00.220]   And so we designed this pretty simple study
[00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:04.420]   where we looked at within fund family,
[00:38:04.420 --> 00:38:06.660]   so it had to be the same fund family,
[00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:08.580]   it had to be the same benchmark,
[00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:13.020]   the same expense ratio within two basis points,
[00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:14.980]   and the same underlying holdings.
[00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:17.220]   For instance, we looked at Charles Schwab,
[00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:20.940]   Charles Schwab S&P 500 ETF
[00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:24.300]   compared to the Charles Schwab S&P 500 index fund.
[00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:27.140]   I'm not sure if those two were in our study,
[00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:28.660]   but I'm just giving an example, right?
[00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:31.380]   So it's the same holding, same everything.
[00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:32.740]   - Almost identical.
[00:38:32.740 --> 00:38:36.140]   - Almost identical, same expense ratio, same everything,
[00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:39.580]   except one is a mutual fund and another is an ETF.
[00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:41.220]   And then we looked at, well,
[00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:43.900]   how much has their performance differed?
[00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:47.780]   And what we found was it differs by about 20 basis points
[00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:49.860]   to 25 basis points per year.
[00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:54.860]   - That's what the benefit to the taxable investor was?
[00:38:54.860 --> 00:38:57.580]   - Yes, on a post-tax basis,
[00:38:57.580 --> 00:39:00.340]   the ETF outperformed by about 20 basis points.
[00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:01.620]   - Wow, that's a lot.
[00:39:01.620 --> 00:39:02.980]   - Yeah, it's significant.
[00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:04.540]   And again, obviously this is due
[00:39:04.540 --> 00:39:07.580]   to the redeem-in-kind feature of ETFs,
[00:39:07.580 --> 00:39:09.900]   but that adds up over time.
[00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:11.940]   That 20 basis points,
[00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:13.940]   if you're holding that in a taxable account,
[00:39:13.940 --> 00:39:16.940]   that's a percentage point every four years or so.
[00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:17.860]   - Sure.
[00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:19.260]   Now, Vanguard is a little different.
[00:39:19.260 --> 00:39:20.980]   Their structure is different.
[00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:21.980]   Can you explain that
[00:39:21.980 --> 00:39:24.780]   and then why it really wouldn't fit into this study?
[00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:25.620]   - Sure, yeah.
[00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:27.220]   Vanguard was omitted from our study
[00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:30.580]   just because their ETFs and mutual funds
[00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:33.180]   have the same post-tax returns,
[00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:36.340]   net of the difference in the expense ratios.
[00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:40.860]   And that is, again, because of this patented system
[00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:42.180]   that Vanguard has,
[00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:45.620]   which basically gives the same benefits
[00:39:45.620 --> 00:39:48.380]   that an ETF has to the mutual funds.
[00:39:48.380 --> 00:39:51.780]   I believe that patent is, I've read, is expiring soon.
[00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:52.660]   - It is expiring,
[00:39:52.660 --> 00:39:54.420]   but it doesn't mean they're gonna stop doing it.
[00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:57.940]   It just means others don't have to pay Vanguard to do it.
[00:39:57.940 --> 00:39:58.940]   - Yes, exactly.
[00:39:58.940 --> 00:39:59.780]   Which will be good
[00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:02.780]   'cause then other groups will have this same benefit
[00:40:02.780 --> 00:40:05.420]   and it'll be more tax efficient for all, hopefully.
[00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:06.940]   - You know, you would think though over the years
[00:40:06.940 --> 00:40:10.300]   that it was a really good idea back 20 years ago
[00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:11.980]   when they did this at Vanguard.
[00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:14.420]   You would have thought that if it was other fund companies
[00:40:14.420 --> 00:40:19.300]   would have just paid Vanguard some fee to use the patent.
[00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:21.140]   But I've heard all kinds of different stories
[00:40:21.140 --> 00:40:23.460]   about why that never happened.
[00:40:23.460 --> 00:40:25.900]   Some of it had to do with the fund companies
[00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:27.740]   not wanting to pay Vanguard anything.
[00:40:27.740 --> 00:40:30.140]   And then other times I've heard that Vanguard
[00:40:30.140 --> 00:40:34.660]   wasn't interested in leasing the patent to anyone.
[00:40:34.660 --> 00:40:37.260]   So, but it is coming off patent, I understand.
[00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:42.260]   And maybe, in fact, I have seen and heard of companies
[00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:44.740]   that are preparing to launch products
[00:40:44.740 --> 00:40:46.980]   where the Open-End Fund and the ETF
[00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:50.380]   are a share class of the same underlying portfolio.
[00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:53.580]   So they'd be treated the same for taxes.
[00:40:53.580 --> 00:40:54.460]   - Interesting.
[00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:59.460]   - Another section of taxes, tax loss harvesting.
[00:40:59.460 --> 00:41:01.860]   You did a lot of work on this.
[00:41:01.860 --> 00:41:04.260]   Now you did it with individual stocks,
[00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:05.580]   but if you've also done some work
[00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:09.700]   on just tax loss harvesting of ETFs
[00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:12.140]   within a taxable portfolio, that would be helpful.
[00:41:12.140 --> 00:41:14.300]   So tell me, what is tax loss harvesting
[00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:15.660]   and what's the benefit?
[00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:18.420]   - Sure, again, I should give the caveat here
[00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:22.540]   that tax loss harvesting is very unique
[00:41:22.540 --> 00:41:24.860]   to a particular situation.
[00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:29.860]   But we tried to capture how much could one individual
[00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:34.220]   juice returns by tax loss harvesting.
[00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:38.180]   So again, the idea here with tax loss harvesting
[00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:41.780]   is you sell loser stocks to offset
[00:41:41.780 --> 00:41:43.900]   some capital gains tax liability.
[00:41:43.900 --> 00:41:46.140]   And we did a lot of simulations here.
[00:41:46.140 --> 00:41:48.900]   We looked at past 50 years of data.
[00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:53.900]   And not surprisingly, during high volatility periods
[00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:59.140]   or strong down years, that's when tax loss harvesting
[00:41:59.140 --> 00:42:01.580]   could juice your returns the most.
[00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:04.500]   And on average, on down years or high volatility years,
[00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:09.500]   we saw you could add about 2% on that year
[00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:11.980]   by tax loss harvesting.
[00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:15.260]   But over the long run, kind of on average,
[00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:20.260]   you're looking about, I would say a percent or so return
[00:42:20.260 --> 00:42:22.500]   that could be added to your portfolio
[00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:24.180]   by tax loss harvesting.
[00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:27.860]   - To make it clear, you added it to your return
[00:42:27.860 --> 00:42:30.700]   because eventually you have capital gains.
[00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:31.540]   - Yes.
[00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:33.220]   - Because you're only allowed to write off $3,000
[00:42:33.220 --> 00:42:35.700]   as a year of losses against your income.
[00:42:35.700 --> 00:42:38.540]   So if you don't have any gains, but if you have gains,
[00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:41.060]   then you could write off these losses against those gains.
[00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:45.420]   So when you're talking about in the long-term adding 1%,
[00:42:45.420 --> 00:42:47.820]   you're assuming you're gonna have gains from,
[00:42:47.820 --> 00:42:50.020]   I don't know, the sale of a piece of property,
[00:42:50.020 --> 00:42:54.140]   the sale of a business, even the sale of your primary home,
[00:42:54.140 --> 00:42:58.220]   if it goes over the 250,000 or $500,000 limit,
[00:42:58.220 --> 00:43:00.220]   if you're single or if you're married.
[00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:04.140]   And therefore, this is how you make up that 1%.
[00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:04.980]   - Yes, yeah.
[00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:07.780]   So again, we're generalizing here to something
[00:43:07.780 --> 00:43:11.220]   that's incredibly individual-specific.
[00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:13.580]   Tax loss harvesting obviously is most beneficial
[00:43:13.580 --> 00:43:17.860]   when you're going to incur a very large taxable event,
[00:43:17.860 --> 00:43:21.740]   I don't know, a sale of a business or something, so.
[00:43:21.740 --> 00:43:24.580]   - Well, that breaks things into another question I have.
[00:43:24.580 --> 00:43:26.460]   And I don't know if you've written on this or not.
[00:43:26.460 --> 00:43:27.380]   I didn't see anything.
[00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:30.060]   It has called direct indexing.
[00:43:30.060 --> 00:43:34.780]   And this is where, instead of just buying the S&P 500
[00:43:34.780 --> 00:43:37.580]   or the total stock market index fund,
[00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:40.980]   you go out and you hire a company,
[00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:42.460]   and even Vanguard does this now,
[00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:46.700]   so it's widely sold out there, and I will say sold,
[00:43:46.700 --> 00:43:49.860]   is that you end up with a portfolio
[00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:53.580]   of 500 different stocks or 1,000 stocks in your portfolio,
[00:43:53.580 --> 00:43:57.300]   literally 85-page account statement every month
[00:43:57.300 --> 00:43:58.940]   of individual securities.
[00:43:58.940 --> 00:44:03.940]   But the program sells the losers, generates tax losses,
[00:44:03.940 --> 00:44:09.300]   and then rebuys or fills in or substitutes,
[00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:11.620]   or the different programs do it different ways,
[00:44:11.620 --> 00:44:13.620]   waits 30 days, rebuys it back,
[00:44:13.620 --> 00:44:18.220]   and you generate quite a bit of tax loss in a year or two
[00:44:18.220 --> 00:44:19.620]   when you might need it.
[00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:21.340]   In other words, you're gonna sell a business
[00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:24.780]   or you've got a big single security
[00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:25.620]   that you're gonna be selling,
[00:44:25.620 --> 00:44:26.900]   and there's a big capital gains,
[00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:28.780]   you wanna maximize the losses.
[00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:31.620]   - So that's how direct indexing is sold.
[00:44:31.620 --> 00:44:34.460]   On the downside, you have to pay fees on that
[00:44:34.460 --> 00:44:35.940]   pretty much for the rest of your life,
[00:44:35.940 --> 00:44:38.700]   because what are you gonna do with 1,000 stocks?
[00:44:38.700 --> 00:44:42.860]   My views of direct indexing might not be as rosy
[00:44:42.860 --> 00:44:44.300]   as the people who are selling this product,
[00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:46.940]   but what are your views on direct indexing?
[00:44:46.940 --> 00:44:50.340]   - Yeah, I was hearing so much about this about a year ago,
[00:44:50.340 --> 00:44:52.980]   and then it kind of dissipated.
[00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:56.020]   I wish I could say more about this.
[00:44:56.020 --> 00:44:57.500]   I just haven't dug into the data.
[00:44:57.500 --> 00:44:59.860]   I don't know if there is data availability yet,
[00:44:59.860 --> 00:45:01.900]   'cause again, it's, to the best of my knowledge,
[00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:04.820]   it's individually created for a person.
[00:45:04.820 --> 00:45:06.500]   Correct me if I'm wrong, but it was,
[00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:08.420]   I remember hearing O'Shaughnessy,
[00:45:08.420 --> 00:45:10.420]   hopefully I'm pronouncing that name right.
[00:45:10.420 --> 00:45:14.620]   They were on TV a year ago really propping this thing up
[00:45:14.620 --> 00:45:17.060]   and saying how great it was,
[00:45:17.060 --> 00:45:18.860]   but I haven't heard much since then.
[00:45:18.860 --> 00:45:20.060]   - Direct indexing firms,
[00:45:20.060 --> 00:45:23.700]   if you had created the software to do it,
[00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:28.020]   became extremely valuable, the companies themselves.
[00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:30.860]   Wealthfront was almost sold to UBS
[00:45:30.860 --> 00:45:33.020]   at extremely high valuation
[00:45:33.020 --> 00:45:34.500]   because of their direct indexing products.
[00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:36.580]   I mean, these direct indexing companies
[00:45:36.580 --> 00:45:39.700]   were going for crazy multiples,
[00:45:39.700 --> 00:45:41.380]   and then it disappeared, you're right.
[00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:44.580]   I mean, last year, 2022, when the market went down,
[00:45:44.580 --> 00:45:45.420]   it all stopped.
[00:45:45.420 --> 00:45:48.420]   In fact, UBS backed out of the deal with Wealthfront.
[00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:51.340]   I will admit there are individuals who could use this,
[00:45:51.340 --> 00:45:53.260]   as long as there's some sort of an exit strategy
[00:45:53.260 --> 00:45:55.500]   to get out of it, so you don't, for the rest of your life,
[00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:59.340]   have a 85-page statement and have to pay fees.
[00:45:59.340 --> 00:46:00.180]   - Yeah.
[00:46:00.180 --> 00:46:04.100]   - Let's go on to the last phase,
[00:46:04.100 --> 00:46:08.220]   the last part of this, and that is investor behavior.
[00:46:08.220 --> 00:46:11.340]   And particularly, I think I wanna get to
[00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:13.580]   a little bit of performance chasing.
[00:46:13.580 --> 00:46:17.380]   We hit on this with the Fama-French three-factor model
[00:46:17.380 --> 00:46:19.740]   a little bit, when it first came out,
[00:46:19.740 --> 00:46:22.300]   Dimensional Fund Advisors adopted it
[00:46:22.300 --> 00:46:25.780]   and they started promoting three-factor investing,
[00:46:25.780 --> 00:46:29.020]   and then Rob Arnott and research affiliates
[00:46:29.020 --> 00:46:30.900]   came out with fundamental indexing,
[00:46:30.900 --> 00:46:35.300]   and all of a sudden, smart beta was the big thing.
[00:46:35.300 --> 00:46:39.220]   It didn't really pan out, as far as the performance,
[00:46:39.220 --> 00:46:41.980]   since it got to be really popular.
[00:46:41.980 --> 00:46:45.260]   Even though these things are academic-based,
[00:46:45.260 --> 00:46:48.620]   sometimes they don't actually work.
[00:46:48.620 --> 00:46:51.900]   And my question to you, as an academic,
[00:46:51.900 --> 00:46:55.020]   is how much weight should investors put
[00:46:55.020 --> 00:47:00.020]   on these new academic discoveries about investing,
[00:47:00.020 --> 00:47:03.260]   or should they wait to partake in them
[00:47:03.260 --> 00:47:04.860]   for at least 20 or 25 years
[00:47:04.860 --> 00:47:08.300]   to see if it actually works in reality?
[00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:10.460]   - Yeah, it's an interesting phenomenon.
[00:47:10.460 --> 00:47:13.700]   At Boston College, we've been writing a lot on this,
[00:47:13.700 --> 00:47:15.940]   and their name just slipped my mind,
[00:47:15.940 --> 00:47:17.620]   but they published a number of works
[00:47:17.620 --> 00:47:20.140]   that go back and look at anomalies.
[00:47:20.140 --> 00:47:23.660]   Anytime a anomaly is announced,
[00:47:23.660 --> 00:47:25.260]   it disappears pretty quickly.
[00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:27.780]   So there's a lot of writing in finance
[00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:30.100]   that goes and looks at an anomaly.
[00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:32.740]   This could be the, I don't know, January effect anomaly.
[00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:34.460]   It could be any of this.
[00:47:34.460 --> 00:47:37.460]   And as soon as it's published, it disappears.
[00:47:37.460 --> 00:47:38.420]   - Yes.
[00:47:38.420 --> 00:47:39.820]   - And that's kind of what we've seen
[00:47:39.820 --> 00:47:41.700]   with this five-factor model.
[00:47:41.700 --> 00:47:42.940]   For those who don't know about it,
[00:47:42.940 --> 00:47:46.340]   it isolates how do small companies do against big companies,
[00:47:46.340 --> 00:47:49.780]   how do high book-to-market do against low book-to-market.
[00:47:49.780 --> 00:47:54.220]   Three factors plus what we call a quality factor.
[00:47:54.220 --> 00:47:56.860]   All the factors really haven't done well
[00:47:56.860 --> 00:48:00.500]   since year 2000, except for the quality factor.
[00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:03.460]   - By quality, you mean quality of earnings?
[00:48:03.460 --> 00:48:04.580]   - Quality of earnings, yep.
[00:48:04.580 --> 00:48:06.220]   People have different definitions for this,
[00:48:06.220 --> 00:48:10.020]   but Vanguard has a quality ETF, a lot of others do,
[00:48:10.020 --> 00:48:14.660]   and it's companies that have positive ROA and growing ROA.
[00:48:14.660 --> 00:48:17.180]   - That has done well, but that's a later factor, right?
[00:48:17.180 --> 00:48:19.580]   I mean, that came out later on.
[00:48:19.580 --> 00:48:21.340]   - Yes, that came out really recently.
[00:48:21.340 --> 00:48:24.420]   That has come out in the past 10 to 15 years.
[00:48:24.420 --> 00:48:26.980]   - If I'm not mistaken, I think the fourth factor
[00:48:26.980 --> 00:48:29.500]   that came out was momentum.
[00:48:29.500 --> 00:48:31.340]   Cliff Asness did a lot of work on that
[00:48:31.340 --> 00:48:35.180]   at the University of Chicago, did his dissertation on that.
[00:48:35.180 --> 00:48:36.900]   I had him on the show.
[00:48:36.900 --> 00:48:39.700]   And then this quality, I believe, was the fifth factor.
[00:48:39.700 --> 00:48:41.660]   That came even later than momentum.
[00:48:41.660 --> 00:48:44.340]   Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think that's the linearity.
[00:48:44.340 --> 00:48:45.180]   - Definitely correct.
[00:48:45.180 --> 00:48:47.100]   That came out with a group of researchers
[00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:49.900]   at University of Rochester.
[00:48:49.900 --> 00:48:53.460]   - So it hasn't had time yet to go awry.
[00:48:53.460 --> 00:48:54.300]   - Yes.
[00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:55.660]   - I don't know, I'm just saying.
[00:48:55.660 --> 00:48:59.340]   It seems to me that even in the academic world,
[00:48:59.340 --> 00:49:02.060]   taking what's called evidence-based investing,
[00:49:02.060 --> 00:49:06.620]   this is a term that I never liked, but it's out there,
[00:49:06.620 --> 00:49:10.020]   and saying, look, here's the evidence from the past,
[00:49:10.020 --> 00:49:12.100]   therefore it's going to,
[00:49:12.100 --> 00:49:13.580]   I don't wanna say it's going to be the future,
[00:49:13.580 --> 00:49:16.180]   but there's evidence that it'll be there in the future.
[00:49:16.180 --> 00:49:18.420]   And I just never bought into that,
[00:49:18.420 --> 00:49:21.460]   but it's sold a lot out there, evidence-based investing.
[00:49:21.460 --> 00:49:26.460]   It's sold as being scientific, a scientific way to invest.
[00:49:26.460 --> 00:49:29.260]   And I don't know, to me, that's just marketing.
[00:49:29.260 --> 00:49:30.180]   What do you think?
[00:49:30.180 --> 00:49:33.340]   - Yes, yeah, I think it's,
[00:49:33.340 --> 00:49:36.180]   we always need a new marketing gimmick, like you said.
[00:49:36.180 --> 00:49:37.220]   - Smart beta.
[00:49:37.220 --> 00:49:38.740]   - Yeah.
[00:49:38.740 --> 00:49:42.900]   And then there was dynamically adjusted multifactor ETFs.
[00:49:42.900 --> 00:49:44.020]   - Yes, of course.
[00:49:44.020 --> 00:49:46.140]   - I haven't heard from those in a while.
[00:49:46.140 --> 00:49:48.460]   But you always need to come up with something
[00:49:48.460 --> 00:49:50.180]   that seems to fit the bill even better,
[00:49:50.180 --> 00:49:51.940]   but it disappears quickly.
[00:49:51.940 --> 00:49:54.580]   And again, if people are curious to read this research
[00:49:54.580 --> 00:49:57.940]   that really does go through the 200 anomalies
[00:49:57.940 --> 00:49:59.340]   that we've identified,
[00:49:59.340 --> 00:50:03.540]   it's a gentleman named Jeff Pontiff at Boston College,
[00:50:03.540 --> 00:50:05.780]   who's done a lot of work and chronicles,
[00:50:05.780 --> 00:50:07.620]   and shows you just how much,
[00:50:07.620 --> 00:50:10.940]   once something's talked about, it disappears quickly.
[00:50:10.940 --> 00:50:12.740]   So Jeff Pontiff.
[00:50:12.740 --> 00:50:13.860]   - All right, so, you know,
[00:50:13.860 --> 00:50:17.860]   Fogelhead's philosophy is buy a few low-cost index funds,
[00:50:17.860 --> 00:50:20.980]   broad market index funds, rebalance if you can.
[00:50:20.980 --> 00:50:23.940]   I mean, and you probably use your tax advantage accounts
[00:50:23.940 --> 00:50:26.780]   to do rebalancing, or new money to rebalance,
[00:50:26.780 --> 00:50:30.220]   so that you can be tax efficient, and stay the course.
[00:50:30.220 --> 00:50:32.380]   How does this sound to you as an academic
[00:50:32.380 --> 00:50:34.500]   who has studied all this other stuff?
[00:50:34.500 --> 00:50:35.940]   It's a loaded question, by the way.
[00:50:35.940 --> 00:50:37.380]   (laughing)
[00:50:37.380 --> 00:50:40.260]   - I've been part of this group for 20 plus years.
[00:50:40.260 --> 00:50:43.020]   It still seems to hold true in the data.
[00:50:43.020 --> 00:50:45.260]   You know, there's no magical solution here.
[00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:48.540]   Just being low-cost and tax efficient
[00:50:48.540 --> 00:50:53.540]   is 98%, 99% of what you can do over the long run.
[00:50:53.540 --> 00:50:56.380]   Doesn't matter if you're an active manager,
[00:50:56.380 --> 00:50:57.940]   and you think you can beat the market.
[00:50:57.940 --> 00:51:00.220]   Over the long run, you're gonna underperform.
[00:51:00.220 --> 00:51:01.980]   It's just a matter of time.
[00:51:01.980 --> 00:51:03.340]   The way I explain it to my students,
[00:51:03.340 --> 00:51:06.300]   'cause they're always so gung-ho,
[00:51:06.300 --> 00:51:07.820]   and, you know, 'cause they read about,
[00:51:07.820 --> 00:51:09.460]   I don't know, renaissance technology,
[00:51:09.460 --> 00:51:11.220]   or some hedge fund out there,
[00:51:11.220 --> 00:51:12.660]   that we think has beaten the market.
[00:51:12.660 --> 00:51:15.260]   And I say, "Well, even if there are a few
[00:51:15.260 --> 00:51:18.180]   "that can beat the market, they don't want your money."
[00:51:18.180 --> 00:51:19.020]   Right?
[00:51:19.020 --> 00:51:19.860]   They're not taking your money.
[00:51:19.860 --> 00:51:20.700]   You're gonna have-- - That's right.
[00:51:20.700 --> 00:51:21.540]   - Right?
[00:51:21.540 --> 00:51:23.340]   If a hedge fund is asking for your money,
[00:51:23.340 --> 00:51:25.900]   you're probably gonna lose money with that hedge fund.
[00:51:25.900 --> 00:51:27.380]   So-- (laughing)
[00:51:27.380 --> 00:51:28.260]   - So true.
[00:51:28.260 --> 00:51:29.100]   - Yeah.
[00:51:29.100 --> 00:51:32.220]   So being tax efficient, low-cost is the best you can do.
[00:51:32.220 --> 00:51:33.540]   - And stay the course.
[00:51:33.540 --> 00:51:34.700]   - Stay the course, yeah.
[00:51:34.700 --> 00:51:35.620]   - Well, Derek, thank you so much
[00:51:35.620 --> 00:51:37.220]   for being on Bogleheads on Investing.
[00:51:37.220 --> 00:51:38.700]   I really enjoyed having you here today.
[00:51:38.700 --> 00:51:41.300]   It's always great to get these different perspectives.
[00:51:41.300 --> 00:51:43.140]   And I gotta give you a lot of credit
[00:51:43.140 --> 00:51:44.460]   for what you're doing at your school,
[00:51:44.460 --> 00:51:46.100]   getting these young people involved,
[00:51:46.100 --> 00:51:47.820]   not just having them do projects,
[00:51:47.820 --> 00:51:50.260]   but you being a real advocate for them,
[00:51:50.260 --> 00:51:51.260]   getting them published.
[00:51:51.260 --> 00:51:54.420]   I mean, that is so huge for them and their careers.
[00:51:54.420 --> 00:51:55.980]   Continue the great work.
[00:51:55.980 --> 00:51:58.020]   - Well, thank you for having me on this podcast.
[00:51:58.020 --> 00:51:59.540]   It's been great.
[00:51:59.540 --> 00:52:03.620]   - This concludes this episode of Bogleheads on Investing.
