[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.500]   while Wikipedia is an astounding resource,
[00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:06.200]   I find it rarely to be the best available introduction
[00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.780]   or explanation of a topic.
[00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:10.160]   I find it often to be like a good jumping off point.
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.640]   Like it'll help me know the right thing to ask about.
[00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.080]   It's good as a reference.
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.100]   So hypertext is a very effective navigational aid.
[00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.780]   It can help you get to a spot
[00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.120]   that you're looking for very quickly
[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.240]   because it's about automating, flipping through pages.
[00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.580]   And so for a reference, it's very effective.
[00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.580]   If what you have is a table of chemical compounds
[00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:30.700]   and their properties,
[00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:31.900]   hypertext is gonna let you navigate
[00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.440]   that book very effectively.
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.000]   Likewise, dictionaries have been revolutionized by hypertext.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.480]   So navigating around the sources by clicking on links
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.840]   to say like, "Oh, shade it a little bit more like that."
[00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.440]   That's like a much better source.
[00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:43.960]   There are certain kinds of text
[00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.720]   that are more amenable to hypertext
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.080]   because they are more amenable
[00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.720]   to having the reader dropped in the middle of them.
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.960]   Encyclopedias are like that, dictionaries are like that.
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.120]   Most text is not like that.
[00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.720]   Most concepts are not like that.
