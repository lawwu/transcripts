[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.600]   The pattern that I seem to be perpetually in
[00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.200]   is one of whatever I'm doing,
[00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.140]   unless I'm podcasting or reading a research paper,
[00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.080]   that my mind is constantly flitting to the other things
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.640]   that I think I should be doing.
[00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:16.480]   - Yeah, that's sad.
[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.160]   - It's sad, and it's something I've been working on
[00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.320]   for a very long time.
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.800]   And I'm able to hold my, for lack of a better word,
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.520]   attention on things to accomplish tasks in my life,
[00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.700]   and to be present with people, as it were.
[00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.200]   But I thought--
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.960]   - No, no, no, let's go back a step,
[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.240]   'cause we both said it was sad.
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.200]   Why is it sad?
[00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.280]   I'm reconsidering, you know,
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.440]   that to be able to think of five different things
[00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.960]   instead of one could be an asset.
[00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:44.980]   - Right, it could be an asset.
[00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.860]   I think that, for me, what I realize is
[00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.240]   most of the shoulds are just total lies.
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.080]   - Yeah.
[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.920]   - They don't, and also they don't--
[00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.320]   - Exactly, exactly. - They're just lies.
[00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.920]   Like, they're not actually coming from a script.
[00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.560]   I'm not hearing other people's voices in my head.
[00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.620]   Yeah, you should do this.
[00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.380]   It's, you know, not parental narrative or anything.
[00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:07.380]   It's just contamination of a useless type.
[00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.260]   It's not like listening to the radio.
[00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:12.180]   I used to listen to the radio
[00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.540]   while I'd make dinner or something.
[00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:14.700]   And it was so pleasant, right?
[00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.260]   You know, hear an evening discussion about the news
[00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.180]   or talk show or whatever on the radio while cooking.
[00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.780]   And so that kind of quote-unquote distraction
[00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:24.660]   felt really meaningful.
[00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.500]   I felt like when I lived alone
[00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.020]   that I had other people in the room with me.
[00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.260]   This is different.
[00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.640]   This is, it feels as if it detracts
[00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.980]   from some essence of the behavior that I'm in,
[00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.120]   even if the behavior is just getting out of bed
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.960]   in the morning.
[00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.820]   - Wait, so let me be clear.
[00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.300]   You get out of bed or start to get out of bed
[00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.740]   and you have several thoughts.
[00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:44.580]   - Yep.
[00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.200]   - And those thoughts bother you?
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.700]   Do they prevent you from getting out of bed?
[00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.940]   - No, but they feel intrusive.
[00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.860]   They don't feel welcome.
[00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.220]   Because I know what I'm gonna do each day.
[00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.500]   I have a policy for myself of doing one work thing each day,
[00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:03.700]   maybe in one or two blocks.
[00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.340]   And I try and really put everything I have into those.
[00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.940]   It's kind of a recent evolution
[00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.120]   of not trying to do three things in a day.
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.580]   Maybe it's a function of getting older,
[00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.700]   but I get so much more satisfaction
[00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.700]   and get truly so much more done
[00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.940]   from just doing one thing in my work life each day.
[00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.220]   - I don't even understand the one thing idea.
[00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.980]   You know, that people talk about multitasking,
[00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:25.900]   which is what you're saying.
[00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.020]   And you're better not to multitask,
[00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.500]   but you're always multitasking, right?
[00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.260]   I mean, I'm moving my hands while I'm talking to you
[00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.380]   and I'm sort of thinking and, you know,
[00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.380]   fixing my back at the same time.
[00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.660]   There are always lots of things going on.
[00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.620]   And I think that also tasks, you know,
[00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.220]   so let's say you're a kid
[00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.020]   and you're doing your social studies homework.
[00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.700]   And then you're doing your math homework.
[00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.020]   And so, and you go back and forth.
[00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:57.980]   So are you multitasking?
[00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:58.820]   It depends.
[00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.900]   If you see yourself as multitasking,
[00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.420]   then you're drawing boundaries
[00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.620]   between your math and your social studies.
[00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.140]   If you see yourself as doing homework,
[00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.780]   it's all part of the same thing.
[00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.420]   And so there's always a way that the tasks can be grouped
[00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.420]   as a single unit, or you can see anything as multitasking.
[00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.220]   When you see it as multitasking,
[00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.700]   you're suggesting to yourself that
[00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.700]   there's going to be some conflict.
[00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.500]   There's some reason I'm leaving this to go to this.
[00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.760]   Well, maybe I'm running the script backwards.
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.100]   Let me put it differently.
[00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:40.020]   The level of satisfaction that I feel
[00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.980]   from having, say, worked on a chapter of my book
[00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.820]   for a couple of hours or even 45 minutes,
[00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.380]   or from going for a run without my phone
[00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.380]   and just enjoying the run,
[00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:56.180]   it still blows me away
[00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.540]   how much I enjoy things
[00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.820]   that would fall under the category of simple things
[00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:05.100]   or things that I experience in isolation,
[00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.020]   as compared to how little I enjoy
[00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.460]   and sometimes reflect on how punishing
[00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:15.540]   quote-unquote multitasking is,
[00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.060]   like being in a text conversation
[00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.420]   while I'm walking on the beach.
[00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.100]   - No, no, but when you're texting while you're on the beach,
[00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.860]   probably it's some kind of work text, right?
[00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.020]   There's something about it,
[00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.980]   and why are you doing it when you're on the beach?
[00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.500]   It's not, because I can easily imagine,
[00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.660]   oh, I'm on the beach, it's wonderful.
[00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.660]   Let me text Andrew and say,
[00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.820]   Andrew, you're right, this time on the beach is wonderful.
[00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.460]   And texting wouldn't take away from it.
[00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.860]   You know, my life is much simpler.
[00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.660]   To me, all you have are moments.
[00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:50.500]   That's it.
[00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.140]   And if you make the moment matter,
[00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:53.220]   then the moment matters.
[00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.180]   And you can't make it matter more.
[00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.540]   It matters or it doesn't matter.
[00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.500]   And so the question, you know,
[00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.380]   when you're lost doing or found, really,
[00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.220]   I don't want to say lost when we're writing.
[00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.300]   I find myself while I'm writing.
[00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.420]   But when you're engaged in an activity,
[00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:13.620]   you know, you're making each of those moments matter,
[00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.660]   but, you know, they should matter as much.
[00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:21.500]   I had this thought that I would help people who were stressed
[00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:22.860]   and I would say to them, okay,
[00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:27.100]   so assuming that their vision is reasonable,
[00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:28.380]   just thread a needle.
[00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.460]   Threading the needle.
[00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.780]   And then I'd ask them how they felt.
[00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:35.340]   And everybody's gonna feel fine
[00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:39.980]   because you're actively engaged and doing something.
[00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:43.060]   You're not engaged in what people call monkey brain
[00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.420]   or whatever, worrying about tomorrow,
[00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:48.060]   worrying about, you know, so on.
[00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:52.620]   So to go back to your three things,
[00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:56.260]   you know, it's like the text on the beach
[00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.980]   is not an I love you text
[00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:02.740]   'cause I don't see why that would distract you.
[00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:05.980]   I can imagine being anywhere, doing multiple things
[00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:08.020]   where I'm sharing what I'm doing,
[00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:10.420]   but I'm not seeing them, you know,
[00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:12.380]   oh, I have to do this work thing.
[00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:16.860]   And then the question is why see the work thing that way,
[00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:18.980]   and especially someone like you
[00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:22.660]   where you don't need any of this anymore anyway, you know?
[00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:24.660]   Well, yeah, that's a discussion unto itself.
[00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:27.780]   No, no, no, but no, but it's important, you know,
[00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:31.380]   and so that if it's all fun, it doesn't matter.
[00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:33.940]   I was on this panel in Australia.
[00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:36.740]   Well, first, each of us gave a talk, some big shots,
[00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:40.020]   and then unbeknownst to us, they brought us all out.
[00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:41.620]   And so we're sitting there
[00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:44.180]   and I'm the last one to be asked.
[00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:47.620]   And the question was, what's on your bucket list?
[00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:51.060]   And so the first person answers what's on the next person,
[00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:52.100]   and we get five.
[00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:53.300]   Now it's my turn.
[00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:55.420]   So I've had some time to think about this.
[00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:59.060]   And you know, my first thought, I don't have a bucket list.
[00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:00.700]   But of course, you know that I'm gonna say,
[00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:02.340]   well, it's good not to have a bucket list
[00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:04.060]   or else I'd have a bucket list.
[00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:07.540]   So then I'm able to say why I don't have a bucket list.
[00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:11.300]   You know, if you imagine you're like a glass,
[00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:15.100]   you know, and the water is full or whatever,
[00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:17.740]   you know, vodka in this case, you know,
[00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:20.860]   that it's full, it's full, you can't do more than that.
[00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:24.020]   And so if the moment is meaningful,
[00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:26.460]   you don't have to be writing that book,
[00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:31.460]   being in love, on a vacation in Paris, you know.
[00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:37.340]   And so I think we have all these crazy notions,
[00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:40.340]   even the idea of, and I've talked about this before,
[00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:42.020]   work life balance.
[00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:44.180]   Ooh, that's scary to me.
[00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:47.180]   What that says, you know, what life really means
[00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:50.340]   is some, you know, joy, right?
[00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:53.740]   Other than just being, you know, doing work 24/7
[00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:56.140]   or however long people work, not 24/7.
[00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:59.620]   What is it, three and a half hours?
[00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:04.620]   Anyway, that it suggests that we,
[00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:09.100]   the work that we're doing has to be aversive.
[00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:13.300]   And because it's aversive, the only way to have a good life
[00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:16.140]   is to add this fun time.
[00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:17.940]   And I think that's sad.
[00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:21.940]   I think it's sad that people think life has to be stressful,
[00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:26.060]   that work has to be unpleasant, you know,
[00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:28.740]   that no matter what you're doing,
[00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:32.540]   I believe there's a way of doing it so that it's fun.
