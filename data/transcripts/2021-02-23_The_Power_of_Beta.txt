[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.680]   Welcome to the
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.720]   Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge, skills,
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.560]   insight and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now, while building
[00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.880]   a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:32.040]   My name is Joshua and today we're going to talk about the power of beta.
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.560]   Let me quickly clarify what I mean.
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:46.960]   Put very simply, if you can observe some large-scale macro trends and then align yourself, perhaps
[00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:53.520]   your career, perhaps your investments and your assets in line with those trends, then
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.440]   I'm convinced that you can win even if you don't happen to be the smartest person in
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.520]   the room.
[00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:08.360]   You just simply need to observe and align yourself with some trends and then get some
[00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.280]   big-picture decisions right.
[00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.560]   Now let's first begin with a discussion of alpha and beta.
[00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.720]   I'm going to use these terms in a way that they don't specifically mean, but I'm drawing
[00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:30.280]   inspiration from what they mean in the marketplace of stock research and stock investing.
[00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:37.840]   Usually when you talk about investing, the term beta is a measure of volatility of a
[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.740]   particular investment, the ups and downs, the volatility of an investment relative to
[00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.740]   a benchmark.
[00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:51.480]   And so what beta does is it measures the systematic risk of a specific security or a specific
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:59.360]   portfolio when compared to an index, like say example, the S&P 500.
[00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.960]   That's what beta is.
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.160]   What's most interesting in your mind is to think about it in terms of alpha.
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.160]   What is alpha?
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:12.640]   Well, alpha is generally understood in stock investing to be the excess return of a particular
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:21.240]   stock or a particular mutual fund or a particular portfolio as compared to the general marketplace.
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.680]   Now, that's what they mean in investing terms, but I'm going to just take inspiration from
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.200]   that and not try to talk about this in a technical sense.
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.120]   I'm going to analogize these terms alpha and beta and apply them in a very broad sense.
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.600]   Just note that from here going forward, these answers are not going to be correct on a CFA
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:41.600]   exam.
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:47.240]   I want to simply take these terms as inspiration to talk about this concept.
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:52.240]   When I think about alpha, I think very simply about outperformance.
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:58.760]   I think about finding a star, finding a winner.
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:04.080]   In the investment world, when you get alpha, it's because you're just a magical portfolio
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.080]   manager.
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:11.160]   You can come in and you can say, "I know how to pick the very best stock.
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.160]   I know how to pick the very best company."
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.760]   Perhaps you go into a marketplace where there are five different packaged goods manufacturers
[00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.160]   and you say, "This particular company has a star of a leader.
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.040]   Because of that star of a leader, I know that this company is going to win."
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.360]   Perhaps you observe a telecommunications company and you say, "This telecommunications company
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.440]   has an exciting new technology.
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.540]   I'm going to come in and I'm going to invest in that telecommunications company because
[00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.640]   it's going to be a winner."
[00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:45.360]   The idea is in time you can generate alpha, you can generate outperformance.
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:51.120]   In life, we often think of ourselves as needing to generate outperformance.
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:57.320]   We often think of ourselves as needing to be the star, needing to have the best of skills,
[00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:02.120]   needing to have the ability to go beyond where other people go.
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.720]   Now alpha is awesome.
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:13.160]   If you can create alpha in your portfolio, you can do very, very well for yourself.
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.960]   You can make a fortune if you can do it in the investing world.
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:23.240]   If you can create alpha in your own life by being a star, you can do very, very well for
[00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.240]   yourself.
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:30.200]   Unlike perhaps the world of investments, which is maybe challenging for many of us, you can
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.400]   do this in your career.
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.880]   You can be the hardest working guy in the room.
[00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:41.240]   You can be the most prepared prior to the important meeting.
[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.280]   You can be the best researcher.
[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.920]   You can be the person that goes the extra mile.
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.680]   You can be a star employee.
[00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:53.480]   Or you can run a business that does very, very well.
[00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.820]   The challenge is this.
[00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:05.440]   If you get alpha right, but you get beta wrong, it's very hard to be successful.
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:13.200]   But if you get alpha right and you get beta right, now you have a winning formula.
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.480]   Again, remember, I'm not using these terms in the CFA sense.
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.280]   I'm trying to simply drive a concept.
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:24.960]   When I think about beta as compared to alpha, I think about the marketplace as a whole.
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.200]   I think about how is this general market going to do.
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.360]   What's going to happen with, say, telecommunications?
[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.280]   Or what's going to happen with space travel?
[00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.640]   Or what's going to happen with the airline industry?
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:42.560]   What's my sense of the market?
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:47.320]   And then when I come back and I think about my life, I find even more applications for
[00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:48.320]   this.
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:54.880]   I think about not am I the person who is by definition the best, but am I lined up with
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.960]   where the market is going?
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:06.180]   Because if you're in a rising industry or you're in a rising company, now you have the
[00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:13.880]   ability to succeed even if you may not be the star employee.
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:22.840]   The 10th hire to Facebook wound up becoming very, very rich, even though they were the
[00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.900]   10th hire.
[00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:28.660]   And you can apply this all the way down the road.
[00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:36.260]   So the question for you to ask yourself is, am I getting my beta right?
[00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:41.700]   You might run the very best company in your industry.
[00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:47.540]   You might be the world's greatest entrepreneur, able to make the best decisions.
[00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:52.120]   You might be the world's greatest manager running a very well-run company.
[00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.540]   Your company might make the very best products.
[00:06:55.540 --> 00:07:01.900]   But if the year is 1900 and your company is engaged in the business of building buggy
[00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:06.180]   whips, you didn't get it right.
[00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:09.140]   You didn't win.
[00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:12.580]   You probably didn't survive.
[00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:16.940]   Now I would be quick to point out that of course that's not guaranteed.
[00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:22.940]   Maybe today you're the world's greatest buggy whip manufacturer for the 577 people per year
[00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:27.380]   who buy a Surrey and hook it up and race their horse at the local track and they need a whip.
[00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:29.380]   I don't know.
[00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:30.520]   The point is pretty obvious.
[00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:33.180]   The market changed under your feet.
[00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:38.940]   But if the year was 1900 and you saw the direction that transportation was going and you got
[00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:48.460]   involved in the industry, there was a very good chance that you experienced more success.
[00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:53.180]   Now you may have joined the wrong company to start with.
[00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:55.380]   And I'm going to use a couple of legacy industries.
[00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:59.020]   Think about something like automobiles.
[00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:02.420]   Getting involved in the automobile industry when people are still trying to figure it
[00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:08.020]   out and you've got hundreds and hundreds of different people making 10 cars a year.
[00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:11.660]   The fact that you're involved in the automobile industry because you saw the direction of
[00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:17.360]   the industry was going didn't necessarily guarantee that you were going to be successful.
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:20.680]   You may have joined a company that had a bad product.
[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:24.160]   But the fact that you were around the automobile industry and you saw the direction of the
[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:28.540]   industry got you a step closer to success and there was a pretty good chance that you
[00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:30.700]   had a timeline of success.
[00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:34.460]   And then once you're in the industry, you can look around and try to figure out who's
[00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:36.420]   going to be the winner in this industry.
[00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:38.440]   Is it going to be Ford Motor Car Company?
[00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:42.940]   In which case you may have gone and hitched your wagon up to Mr. Ford because you said
[00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:44.540]   this is going to be the winner.
[00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:46.000]   Or maybe it was airlines.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.100]   Maybe you observed after the airplane was invented that, you know what, air travel has
[00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:52.580]   the potential to change the world.
[00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:59.060]   And if I go and get involved in air travel, then I have the ability to be in something
[00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:01.340]   that's going to be transformative.
[00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:04.820]   You may have ended up working for a company that went bankrupt.
[00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:06.960]   But once you're in the industry, you can adjust.
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:09.240]   You can look for your alpha.
[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:13.620]   You can look for the opportunity to be the best employee at the best company.
[00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:15.720]   But first you've got to get your beta right.
[00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:17.580]   You've got to get the industry right.
[00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:20.440]   And you've got to get the direction of the marketplace right.
[00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:22.240]   Maybe it was telecommunications.
[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:24.840]   Perhaps it is telecommunications.
[00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:29.240]   But maybe you were involved in telecommunications and it was the 1980s and the 1990s.
[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:33.120]   You said, you know what, the fact that we can make a phone call from anywhere and carry
[00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:36.600]   a phone on our hip, this is going to revolutionize the world.
[00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:40.880]   And if I just get involved in this industry in some way, there's a good chance that I
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.440]   can make my fortune.
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:47.520]   Well making that move doesn't mean you don't wind up at a bankrupt company.
[00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:53.720]   But what it means is there's a much better chance that you're on an upswell.
[00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:59.620]   As the axiom goes, a rising tide raises all boats.
[00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:03.400]   Maybe it was the dot-com in the early 2000s.
[00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:06.480]   Maybe it was real estate.
[00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:08.200]   I don't know.
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:14.240]   But when you see a trend and you observe that trend, my point in today's show is that you
[00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:16.120]   should pay attention to it.
[00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:20.960]   And you should think about how can I get involved in this trend?
[00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:25.600]   Can I get the beta right?
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:28.720]   So how can you apply this to your own finances?
[00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:36.820]   Well, the first thing that I would emphasize is that you should apply this to your income,
[00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:40.400]   to your earnings.
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:46.520]   I'm going to give an example of two different trends that I observe, especially trends that
[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:51.820]   could be found in the space of where you're earning money.
[00:10:51.820 --> 00:11:00.120]   The first trend would be a legacy industry that may be on the decline.
[00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:05.440]   In my mind, a good example of this industry would be the role of a real estate agent in
[00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:08.280]   the United States of America.
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:14.880]   For a very long time, working as a real estate agent has been something that could be a very
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:20.520]   profitable and very – a really nice way to make a living.
[00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:25.040]   I have actually frequently recommended to people that they consider working as a real
[00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:26.040]   estate agent.
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:29.520]   It's the kind of job that I think I would be a pretty good fit for and that I would
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:31.440]   enjoy.
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:34.820]   Working as a real estate agent can be a very good career.
[00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:39.800]   But in my opinion – this is my opinion – it is a career that at least in the United States
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:42.960]   – I don't know all markets around the world, but in the United States, it's a career that
[00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:44.760]   is on the decline.
[00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:45.760]   Why?
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:54.600]   Well, because in many cases, the individual work and service of an agent is increasingly
[00:11:54.600 --> 00:12:03.800]   replaced by Internet technology and by people's comfort levels with going and seeing and viewing
[00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:10.800]   properties online, choosing among properties online, doing tours, virtual tours, establishing
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.800]   their own things, etc.
[00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:15.280]   Now, I'm not saying the industry is dead.
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:20.520]   I'm saying that I think the industry is significantly on the decline.
[00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:23.440]   I think that you're having the big players that are coming in that are disrupting the
[00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:29.760]   marketplace and I will be very surprised if five years from now, ten years from now, a
[00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:35.960]   traditional real estate agent can command the same level of commissions today that they've
[00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:39.320]   been able to command for many years.
[00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:40.880]   I'm not insulting you real estate agents.
[00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:44.400]   I'm saying I think this is a good example of a trend.
[00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:49.280]   So if I were in the real estate business, I would be observing and looking at this trend
[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:59.200]   and saying, "I think my career may have a limited time span, shelf life.
[00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:07.920]   I think that within a period of years, this particular career in the United States is
[00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:11.720]   going to become less profitable and more difficult."
[00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:14.080]   We could have used other careers as well.
[00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:20.480]   For example, this one's more difficult because there's more factors, but let's just stick
[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:22.040]   with a career with real estate.
[00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:26.380]   That'd be an example of, in my opinion, of a career that's on the decline in the United
[00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:30.800]   States or at least its prospects are not as bright as it once was.
[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:33.960]   Don't think, by the way, that these things will change overnight and all of a sudden.
[00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:38.040]   I could say a similar thing of the pressure on financial advisors.
[00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:42.440]   Financial advisors are under intense pressure in the current world.
[00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:47.480]   In the 1980s, it was very easy to be a financial advisor and make a lot of money selling stocks,
[00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:49.560]   charging management fees, et cetera.
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:54.320]   But the pressure, the financial pressure on financial advisors has been intense so that
[00:13:54.320 --> 00:14:00.040]   now it's very hard to make a living going out and selling stocks for a commission.
[00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:04.920]   I know of virtually no financial advisors that can actually do that successfully, sell
[00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:06.320]   stocks for a commission.
[00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:07.320]   Why?
[00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:08.320]   Because you had market pressures.
[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:14.760]   You had the market pressures of no commission stock brokerage houses.
[00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:17.160]   You had the market pressure of index funds.
[00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:22.040]   You had a mammoth like Vanguard that came in and brought tremendous pressure against
[00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:23.240]   the industry.
[00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:30.080]   You had all kinds of fracturing in the financial industry such that now financial advisors
[00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:32.160]   had to go in a totally different direction.
[00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:33.720]   Doesn't mean the career is dead.
[00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:38.600]   It means it's under intense pressure and it's not as easy as it once was.
[00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:44.840]   If you're going to be successful, your success matters depends much more on your alpha, on
[00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:49.640]   what you bring to the table than on the beta, on what the industry actually provides for
[00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:50.640]   you.
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:55.280]   In 1980, if you came to the table and you picked up the phone and you did your cold
[00:14:55.280 --> 00:15:00.520]   calls, you could make a great income selling stocks over the phone if you were persistent
[00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:01.600]   enough.
[00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:04.760]   In 2020, you cannot.
[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:07.760]   It's a totally different business model and you've got to be much more intelligent about
[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:08.760]   it.
[00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:10.200]   So there are two careers as an example.
[00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:13.920]   Now where could you go where there's some sense of growth?
[00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:17.280]   Well I think there'd be many examples.
[00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:22.120]   Last night I was looking around online in the cryptocurrency space and I was observing
[00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:28.680]   that now there are several dozens of degrees available right now in blockchain technology
[00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:32.800]   from really all over the world, but you can now go and you can get a degree in blockchain
[00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:33.800]   technology.
[00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:36.520]   Last night I was looking at the website for the University of Malta.
[00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:42.240]   Malta between Africa and Europe, a little island off the tip of Italy, has sought to
[00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:45.000]   bill itself as blockchain island.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.040]   They've tried to be very friendly.
[00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:49.920]   They've tried to establish regulation for cryptocurrency businesses with I would say
[00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:51.160]   mixed success.
[00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:54.720]   Not as much success as was hoped thus far and we'll see what happens, but they've tried
[00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:57.280]   to bill themselves as blockchain island.
[00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:02.560]   So the University of Malta has a career, sorry, has a master's degree program that you can
[00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:07.780]   go and you can be involved in and get a master's degree in blockchain technology.
[00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:12.640]   In my opinion this would be a pretty good example of an area where there's massive growth,
[00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:22.560]   of an area where if you are competent in some skills relating to cryptocurrencies to blockchain
[00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:27.880]   technology, this is something where there's a lot of career growth.
[00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:36.120]   When you have Bitcoin hitting 50, almost $60,000 per coin and with just only modest signs of
[00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:42.080]   stopping, now all of a sudden you see a pretty significant field and then you see people
[00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:48.720]   and countries and companies trying to say, "How can we take this new technology and apply
[00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:50.200]   it in different areas?"
[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:54.040]   Now I don't know what the end of the day is, where we're going to be 10 years from now
[00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:57.360]   with cryptocurrencies and with blockchain technology.
[00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:01.880]   There's a lot of reason to believe that they'll be an integral part of our lives, but this
[00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:07.040]   would be an example of the type of career where I think things are in a growth pattern.
[00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:12.480]   Now perhaps that's a little bit too innovative or a little bit too rare for you.
[00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:17.000]   I think another obvious example would be something as simple and mundane as being a software
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.500]   engineer.
[00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:22.880]   You could begin today with no history, no knowledge.
[00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:26.680]   You could be working as a real estate agent today, looking down and realizing, "My career
[00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:31.480]   is declining," but you can start studying software engineering entirely for free, by
[00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:32.480]   the way.
[00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:35.140]   No need to take any classes that you pay for.
[00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:36.140]   Start doing projects.
[00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:40.200]   Start going through the various coaching sites and the education sites and whatnot.
[00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:45.240]   Then a few years from now, you could have a six-figure job as a software engineer with
[00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:50.120]   massive growth potential, and as the world moves more and more intensively in the direction
[00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:54.560]   of software solutions for more and more parts of life, the need for software engineers is
[00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:55.560]   intense.
[00:17:55.560 --> 00:18:00.320]   I don't see any way that that particular career is in decline at the moment, although there
[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:03.240]   may be heavy competition, it's not in decline.
[00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:06.040]   And there are many other examples of these.
[00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:10.600]   Now don't just think that if you just find beta, it's good enough, or if you just have
[00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:12.160]   alpha, it's good enough.
[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:17.040]   I think the power – I teach a course on career and income planning.
[00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:20.240]   It's called the Radical Personal Finance Guide to Career and Income Planning, available
[00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:24.120]   for you today, right now, at radicalpersonalfinance.com/store.
[00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:29.160]   And one of the concepts that I teach in that course is the power of choosing very carefully
[00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:32.800]   and maximizing both your beta and your alpha.
[00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:42.520]   Somebody who carefully chooses an industry that is growing in a location, a geographic
[00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:49.480]   location of the world that is growing and where the trends are in the right direction,
[00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:54.600]   and they choose the best company in the industry that has the brightest prospects, and then
[00:18:54.600 --> 00:19:00.440]   within that company, they choose the best segment, the best division of the company,
[00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:03.560]   where it's the most important division of the company.
[00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:07.980]   And then to the degree that it's possible, they choose the best boss in that division
[00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:13.560]   to work under, and they choose the best job position for them.
[00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:18.480]   And then they go into that workplace and they work their tail off, and they become an absolute
[00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:21.640]   star exercising their alpha.
[00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:27.320]   That person is going to be light years away of the person who has the capability and potential
[00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:33.400]   to be a star, but works under a bad boss in a division of a company that's not particularly
[00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:38.840]   valuable, in a company that's poorly run, and in an industry or a geographic place in
[00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:41.040]   the world that's in decline.
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:44.680]   So to get the maximum benefit in your career, you want to stack all of these things on top
[00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:49.400]   of each other.
[00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:55.120]   In summary on the career perspective, think carefully about the trends that are happening.
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:20:02.000]   I've listed a number of trends, but think carefully about these.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.760]   It's all well and good for you to be personally success oriented, for you to be the person
[00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:14.500]   who has the basic skills to be effective and successful and valuable in the marketplace.
[00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:19.360]   But if you're not positioned well, again, think about your boss.
[00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:24.400]   If you're under the wrong boss, that can be the death of you.
[00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:25.400]   Not in and of itself.
[00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:30.040]   If you're under somebody who is not going to raise you up with them, if you're under
[00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:37.480]   somebody who's not going to recognize it when you make them shine, you got a problem.
[00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:39.640]   Change to a different boss.
[00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:45.220]   If you're in a division of the company that's not particularly contributing to growth, change.
[00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:47.920]   If you're in the wrong company, change.
[00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:54.240]   But the big ones to get right are industry and I would say also geography.
[00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:56.120]   Think carefully about your industry.
[00:20:56.120 --> 00:21:03.440]   You may, and this is one of the things that I get upset a lot of times with the concepts
[00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:12.560]   of passive investing, of saying to yourself, "I can't successfully choose what stocks are
[00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:14.800]   going to outperform."
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:18.440]   And the reason I get upset with it is not because I have the ability to argue with the
[00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:20.120]   academic research.
[00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:22.400]   I don't.
[00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:27.480]   I'm not a researcher at the Chicago School of Economics who could sit down and generate
[00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:31.160]   new economic investing theories worthy of a Nobel Prize.
[00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:33.440]   It's not my forte.
[00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:37.520]   But what I think happens is I think that people take it too far and I believe that this has
[00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:38.520]   hurt me personally.
[00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:41.120]   I'll start with me personally.
[00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:47.280]   When I was younger, I spent so much time being told by the financial industry that, "Well,
[00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:54.320]   Joshua, you can't tell successfully with any statistical reliability, you can't tell what's
[00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:56.560]   going to outperform."
[00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:59.640]   And I was told that again and again and again and I would read the academic literature and
[00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:01.840]   I didn't have the ability to refute it.
[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:03.920]   I didn't have the ability to say, "Well, wait a second.
[00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:04.920]   Wait a second.
[00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:12.740]   Yes, you've got your hypothesis, Mr. Fancy Pants Academic Researcher, but I think I can."
[00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:15.560]   And what would happen is I would just say, "Well, I can't do it.
[00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:16.920]   I can't predict it.
[00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:19.720]   I can't predict it."
[00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:25.240]   The problem is for me, this went far too far, far beyond what the academic research would
[00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:31.400]   indicate to areas where the academic philosophy, sorry, the academics who created that numerical
[00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:35.640]   modeling that said, "Hey, it's very difficult for a fund manager to outperform."
[00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:42.120]   I absorbed this concept in my own life to much too great of a degree and I came to the
[00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:46.160]   perspective and I said, "Well, I can't predict what market's going to be.
[00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:49.040]   I can't predict what stock is going to be the next winner."
[00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:53.120]   I didn't understand that there were ways to make money on stocks even if I couldn't predict
[00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:54.880]   it successfully and to ensure my bets.
[00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:55.880]   I didn't get that.
[00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:58.160]   I wasn't sophisticated enough at that time.
[00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:04.560]   Then I thought, "Well, I can't predict what market segment or I can't predict the general
[00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:11.880]   direction of the stock market or I can't predict what industries are going to take off or I
[00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:17.000]   can't predict what regions of the world are going to be successful."
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:22.560]   When I test those ideas, I realized that I was completely wrong.
[00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:29.680]   Now, I may not be the world's best stock picker, but I can look at something as simple as demographics
[00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:33.800]   and make some educated guesses about where I think things are going.
[00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:36.800]   Now, in the fullness of time, will I turn out to be right or wrong?
[00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:46.040]   I don't know, but I can make some educated guesses and I'm willing to put my money behind
[00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:47.040]   that.
[00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:50.760]   This is just, again, speaking personally for me.
[00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:56.880]   When I finally realized where this came from, again, I become frustrated with passive investing
[00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:00.120]   because I believe that one of the dangers, maybe not for most people, but at least for
[00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:06.080]   me, one of the dangers was that it led me to doubt my own abilities.
[00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:10.960]   I'm not so much of a maverick in the sense of my ability to go against everybody and
[00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:13.000]   say, "Well, I just have it all figured out."
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.920]   I admire people who can.
[00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:20.040]   I admire somebody who can stand up in a room full of people saying, "That thing is white."
[00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:21.040]   They can say, "No, it's not.
[00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:22.040]   It's not white.
[00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:23.960]   It's black," and they can be totally convinced of it.
[00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:28.440]   I'm too much of a researcher and analytical and I say, "Well, listen, if 98% of the people
[00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:32.320]   say it's white, there's a very good chance it's white and I want to see some really good
[00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:37.120]   evidence that it's actually black before I open my mouth and say it's black."
[00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:41.720]   So if I've had 18 years to do the research, then I might be willing to be one of the 2%.
[00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:46.040]   In some things, I'm totally willing to be the 2%, but I'm not willing to open my mouth
[00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:50.360]   at an early stage where there are other people who are just – they have a gut instinct
[00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:52.000]   and they say, "No, this is the way it is.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   This is the way the world is."
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   I admire those people.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:55.520]   That's not me.
[00:24:55.520 --> 00:25:02.080]   And all of that idea about the efficient market hypothesis, I took it far too far in my own
[00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:08.480]   life and it's hurt me because I didn't have the forethought to be willing to take bets
[00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:10.800]   on things that I thought were true.
[00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:16.040]   Well, speaking personally, now that I have identified that, I'm changing.
[00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:17.880]   I was wrong.
[00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:24.840]   I've identified to the best of my ability the source of why I was wrong and now I reject
[00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:30.440]   that previous way of thinking and I'm willing at this point in my life to take bets on myself
[00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:32.400]   and on my own hunches.
[00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:36.120]   I have a good safety mechanism with good financial planning to say, "Hey, I'm not going to
[00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:41.040]   ruin myself," but I'm willing to bet my money on what I think is happening and I'm willing
[00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:42.040]   to bet my life on it.
[00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:43.600]   I'm willing to make life decisions on it.
[00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:45.800]   I'll give you a couple of examples.
[00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:48.120]   Geography matters.
[00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:52.440]   Geography matters to your daily experience of life.
[00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:54.520]   I've tried to emphasize how important that is.
[00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:57.600]   If you like living a beach lifestyle, choose a beach place to live.
[00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:01.200]   If you like a mountains lifestyle, choose a mountains lifestyle to live.
[00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:04.120]   But geography also matters to economics.
[00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:09.200]   This is why all over the world, the trend is for people to move from rural regions into
[00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:10.200]   cities.
[00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:15.000]   As far as I can tell, the continued growth of mega cities is inevitable.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:23.420]   I guess inevitable is too much of a word, but it's a very strong chance that the cities
[00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:25.520]   are going to continue to grow.
[00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:28.960]   Doesn't mean that all cities are going to continue to grow everywhere, but on the whole,
[00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:34.120]   speaking globally, mega cities and very large cities, as I see it, are going to continue
[00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:40.600]   to grow because what they offer is a very, very compelling set of benefits.
[00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:41.960]   Now there may be difficulties.
[00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:47.120]   New York City might be in a difficult place right now.
[00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:50.920]   San Francisco might be in a very difficult place right now.
[00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:54.760]   I think there's good reasons to believe that the difficulties in these particular cities
[00:26:54.760 --> 00:27:00.000]   will continue, but I don't expect Mexico City to continue to be in a difficult space.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:05.040]   I don't expect Istanbul to face those same trends.
[00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:08.920]   There are some unique trends, I think, about certain things that are happening in the US
[00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:11.560]   culture that are going to continue, but at the end of the day, New York is still going
[00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:14.880]   to continue to be attractive to many people.
[00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:20.440]   On a global basis, some of the other global mega cities have some benefits that a city
[00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:23.600]   like a New York City doesn't have.
[00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:27.800]   I think this trend is going to continue.
[00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:32.560]   So if you were living out in the country and you wanted to get yourself in the way of a
[00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:37.840]   beta trend, you're going to find it easier to build wealth, to get a good job, if you
[00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:43.600]   move from a little podunk town in the middle of nowhere to a city.
[00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:46.960]   There are going to be more economic opportunities, which is why millions and millions of people
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:49.720]   all around the world are doing this.
[00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:52.080]   If it's not right for you, you don't want to live in a city, it doesn't mean you have
[00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:55.240]   to, especially today.
[00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:59.040]   You can make a fortune in the country, but you should be aware that if you don't have
[00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:04.560]   any better ideas, you can probably increase your earning power by moving to a city.
[00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:06.520]   But let's talk about globally.
[00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:10.120]   This to me seems obvious.
[00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:17.640]   I personally am convinced that most of the West, specifically Western Europe and North
[00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:26.840]   America, most of these countries are in either malaise or decline.
[00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:29.880]   I don't think that they will be in precipitous decline.
[00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:33.320]   I think what's more personally more likely is a general sense of malaise.
[00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:36.560]   Where I'm most familiar, of course, the United States, I think you see this.
[00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:40.240]   You see just this general sense of lack of optimism for the future.
[00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:43.920]   You see incredible levels of discontent, of discord in the society.
[00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:48.600]   You don't get a sense of a people bursting with energy and a vision for the future.
[00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:51.440]   You don't get a sense of collaboration.
[00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:52.640]   Now what can change this?
[00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:53.720]   I don't know.
[00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:57.560]   Maybe some amazing leader could come along and re-inspire it.
[00:28:57.560 --> 00:29:00.280]   Maybe a JFK could say, "We're going to the moon."
[00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:02.440]   And all of a sudden everyone said, "Yes, we're going to the moon."
[00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:04.320]   I love to watch Apollo 13.
[00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:10.200]   I love to see a movie like that and imagine what it was like to be living in a time when
[00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:11.640]   you do that.
[00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:15.360]   You have some of that pride when they land a rover on Mars.
[00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:17.680]   I have some of that pride when I watch SpaceX launches.
[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:20.840]   I really enjoy watching SpaceX launches with my children.
[00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:27.920]   I gain some kind of glimmer of that sense of nationalistic pride again.
[00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:28.920]   So maybe it happens again.
[00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:29.920]   It could.
[00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:34.800]   But in general, I think there's good reasons to believe that these areas are in decline.
[00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:38.800]   I'll give some examples just so that you can consider for yourself.
[00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:43.840]   In my observation, there are probably three big things that – maybe four – that really
[00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:49.360]   hinder the West generally, Western Europe, North America.
[00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:52.260]   I'll just speak mostly about the United States.
[00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:56.840]   One of the most obvious ones is population decline.
[00:29:56.840 --> 00:30:03.760]   Most Western countries have birth rates far below replacement rates.
[00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:10.920]   So you don't have a stable sense of population, but you have declining population.
[00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:15.600]   Now this is generally being offset right now with immigration.
[00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:20.040]   You have a country like Canada, this relatively small country that's importing hundreds of
[00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:25.440]   thousands of immigrants every year to try to lead to economic growth and seems to be
[00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:29.460]   successful, at least in some measures, things like real estate marketplaces, et cetera.
[00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:32.400]   But it's primarily happening through immigration.
[00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:35.080]   Immigration brings its own unique set of challenges.
[00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:37.000]   You see this all around the world.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:41.080]   In my experience, I've never traveled a place where there's just been total complete
[00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:44.840]   peace and harmony between large numbers of immigrants.
[00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:46.620]   You see this in Western Europe.
[00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:52.280]   You see general sense of societal unease relating to immigrants from Africa.
[00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:57.360]   You see this in North America with immigrants from all over, but in the United States especially
[00:30:57.360 --> 00:30:59.120]   from Central America.
[00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:03.240]   And so you see this general sense of tension happening across the society, at least a political
[00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:05.800]   strife, et cetera.
[00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:07.200]   Why?
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:09.040]   And does that change?
[00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:10.440]   I don't put my opinion.
[00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:11.440]   I don't think it changes.
[00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:17.680]   Number one, the cultural trend seems to be against having children, which means declining
[00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:19.280]   population.
[00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:22.840]   And while I think that most of these countries with declining populations are going to have
[00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:28.000]   to massively increase their immigration perspectives, at this point in time, I don't think that
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:35.880]   there's a solid enough home country culture to lead to successful assimilation of immigrants.
[00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:39.280]   And so I think we're going to see more and more balkanization, so to speak, more and
[00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:45.840]   more separation, where instead of having immigrants being able to be assimilated into a strong
[00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:52.400]   central culture, you'll see various groups of immigrants retaining their own local identity
[00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:55.360]   rather than grasping the central identity.
[00:31:55.360 --> 00:32:00.560]   You see this right now in France with the French government seeking to pass laws requiring
[00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:07.400]   the French Muslim community to integrate more fully into the community.
[00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:11.880]   And this is especially, I think, challenging in secular cultures like you see in France,
[00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:16.480]   because my personal opinion, I don't think secularism has the foundation to do that.
[00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:21.640]   I personally think that you'll see much – a massive growth of Islam throughout Western
[00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:26.160]   Europe rather than a growth of secularization we'll see in the coming years.
[00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:30.000]   But this point of population growth is a major factor.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.360]   Now what does this matter?
[00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:34.600]   Well, it ties into the second time, the second thing.
[00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:38.360]   When you look at a culture like the United States, you see that it is burdened by the
[00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:41.160]   decisions and the promises of the past.
[00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:47.800]   So you had a previous very robust, very healthy economy, very healthy country.
[00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:50.000]   You had growing populations.
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   You had economic growth.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.200]   It seemed like the sky was the limit.
[00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:55.880]   And so then you had people come out and pass all of these ideas.
[00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:57.120]   We're going to have Medicare.
[00:32:57.120 --> 00:32:58.520]   We're going to have Social Security.
[00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:00.840]   We're going to have social safety nets.
[00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:02.040]   We can borrow money to expand.
[00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:03.040]   It's all going to be great.
[00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:05.560]   It's going to be fantastic.
[00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:10.720]   But then when you have a declining population, all of a sudden now those promises don't
[00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:12.280]   work anymore.
[00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:17.140]   And yet the society is still burdened under the weight of these things.
[00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:20.720]   So you see the political instability in the United States.
[00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:26.680]   You see this whipsaw effect between a George W. Bush and then a snapping all the way over
[00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:32.300]   to a Barack Obama, then a snapping from a Barack Obama to a Donald Trump, then a snapping
[00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:34.680]   from a Donald Trump to a Joe Biden.
[00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:36.120]   And then we'll see what's next.
[00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:37.120]   Why?
[00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:43.920]   Well, you have this government that is laden by decades and decades of promises, but those
[00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:45.840]   promises weren't paid for.
[00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:51.480]   And so it's very easy for a politician to identify the problems and with skillful public
[00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:54.960]   rhetoric to rile people up to vote for him.
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:59.080]   But then when he comes into office, there's virtually nothing he can do because there's
[00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:05.460]   this immense bureaucracy whose hands and feet are all tied by all of these promises.
[00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:11.320]   And the US president elected in 2020 can only affect a tiny percentage of the budget compared
[00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:14.240]   to a US president elected in 1920.
[00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:15.320]   Why?
[00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:21.640]   Because 75% of the budget goes to Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and military spending.
[00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:27.400]   So you have a country that's mired in these decisions of the past and these expectations
[00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:32.000]   that were built for a society that no longer exists.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.080]   And this leads to a sense of malaise, a sense of frustration.
[00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:37.400]   In the same way, so I'll finish it.
[00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:44.240]   And then you have a world in which you have a flattening occur.
[00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:48.960]   And many of the geographical features, many of the technological features where you had
[00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:56.440]   US American superiority, well, those areas of superiority are no longer as clear.
[00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:59.160]   So you have a massive empire that's difficult to maintain.
[00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:05.000]   And it seems to me, I don't see a lot of room for things to run personally.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:08.880]   So when I think about where are things likely to be in the West in the coming years, where
[00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:13.080]   are things likely to be in the United States economically 30 years from now, 50 years from
[00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:16.160]   now, again, could be wrong.
[00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:22.080]   But to me, it seems pretty obvious that without a massive level of bankruptcy to clear the
[00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:30.400]   old debt, that a society like the United States is going to be pretty well mired in malaise
[00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:34.520]   for quite a while.
[00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:37.760]   Let's use a personal finance example.
[00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:42.800]   Imagine a guy, maybe a 55-year-old guy.
[00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:46.860]   He's been really successful, very successful.
[00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:52.440]   But the reality is he's more tired at 55 than he was at 25.
[00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:57.960]   And imagine that he built his whole life thinking that he was going to be as energetic at 55
[00:35:57.960 --> 00:35:59.600]   as he was at 25.
[00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:04.280]   And he made all these decisions to borrow lots and lots and lots of money to sign himself
[00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:06.880]   up for all kinds of obligations.
[00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:09.680]   And so his financial life became very, very heavy.
[00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:16.240]   And now at 55, he's trying to maintain the image of being the guy who still got it all
[00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:17.240]   together.
[00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:21.120]   But the reality is he's not as vigorous or as productive as he used to be.
[00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:23.480]   It's kind of how I picture the United States.
[00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:27.480]   It's not that the 55-year-old guy is going to die today.
[00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:31.400]   It's just that he's really burdened down, right?
[00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:33.960]   He's got a lot of debt.
[00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:35.280]   He's not as young as he once was.
[00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:37.080]   He doesn't have the advantages he once was.
[00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:41.840]   He can't move his fingers on his iPhone screen as quickly as his 15-year-old son can.
[00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:47.400]   And yet he's living in a world in which that iPhone screen is a ticket to wealth for many
[00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:48.400]   15-year-olds.
[00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:50.600]   It's not to say he's not powerful, right?
[00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:52.520]   The 55-year-old guy has connections.
[00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:53.520]   He has power.
[00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:55.680]   He's got all of the legacy that he has.
[00:36:55.680 --> 00:37:03.920]   But he's aging and he's burdened.
[00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:13.420]   So now compare that kind of society with some other societies.
[00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:15.280]   Compare it with Asia.
[00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:21.600]   Now the birth rate story in Asia is not strictly clear.
[00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:22.640]   Asia is a very big place.
[00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:27.040]   You have a place like Japan that's had negative birth rates for 40 years.
[00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:33.660]   But that would be compared with a place like Thailand or Vietnam or Cambodia where there's
[00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:38.040]   much more of a sense of energy and there's much more of a growth.
[00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:39.880]   I think birth rates matter massively.
[00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:44.280]   You can see when you see a culture that's expanding, there's a sense of optimism and
[00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:47.320]   growth and that youthful energy can bring a lot of instability, right?
[00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:48.320]   You see that.
[00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:53.440]   You see a society where there's a lot of young people but low employment and it can be very
[00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:54.440]   unstable.
[00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:56.920]   But it can also bring tremendous economic growth.
[00:37:56.920 --> 00:37:58.640]   You go back to the baby boom in the United States.
[00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:04.220]   It made a massive difference in terms of the economic growth of the nation.
[00:38:04.220 --> 00:38:06.820]   So birth rates, population makes a big difference.
[00:38:06.820 --> 00:38:07.820]   But what's more important?
[00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:13.780]   Well, many of these societies in Asia are not burdened down by the debt, the promises,
[00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:14.780]   right?
[00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:19.480]   The decades and decades of promises that a place like the United States is.
[00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:23.720]   I think what's also very important is when you look at the relative level of poverty
[00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:25.220]   versus wealth.
[00:38:25.220 --> 00:38:34.400]   In my mind, the economic opportunities for Asia, Africa, South America, they're clearly
[00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:38.440]   bigger because there's clearly more room to go.
[00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:40.640]   There's clearly more opportunities.
[00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:47.040]   It's very hard I think to look at a wealthy nation, to look at Singapore, right?
[00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:49.040]   That's a spectacular success story in itself.
[00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:51.000]   But let's just look at the United States, right?
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:55.160]   It's very hard to look at a nation like the United States and say on the whole, how do
[00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:58.760]   standards of living increase significantly?
[00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:01.900]   Generally when people think about increasing standard of living in the United States, they
[00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:07.960]   think about making things easier and less expensive rather than having more, right?
[00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:13.960]   They think about saying, "Well, let's have government-provided health care programs because
[00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:17.800]   that makes life easier for you and removes a burden of providing for your own health
[00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:18.800]   needs.
[00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:20.840]   Let's provide some kind of income.
[00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:24.920]   Let's give more money to poor people and provide poor people with more."
[00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:28.600]   But when you come to actual standard of living as measured by consumption, it's hard to see
[00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:34.120]   how you get a lot more consumption across the board.
[00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:38.960]   And when you have an economy that's built on consumption, it's hard to see where the
[00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:41.160]   massive growth comes from.
[00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:42.820]   Maybe there's a new technology, right?
[00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:47.240]   Maybe you saw this in telecommunications and some things over the last few decades.
[00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:50.660]   Maybe there'll be a new technology that we just don't see right now.
[00:39:50.660 --> 00:39:56.240]   But even if there is a new technology, it's hard for me personally to see how that results
[00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:59.080]   in a massively growing economy.
[00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:05.320]   But when you go to a place like China and you think about 30 years ago what the average
[00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:11.560]   person was living in versus today, it's just night and day.
[00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:17.120]   When you go to Mexico and you look at the broader Mexican population and you think about
[00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:21.520]   the consumer goods and the lifestyle choices and whatnot that many Mexicans would like
[00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:28.240]   to have, the beta, meaning the opportunity to rise, seems so much stronger in my opinion.
[00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:34.280]   Because you have people that want a lot of the luxury goods that you see in some other
[00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:35.280]   economies.
[00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:39.680]   So to me it just seems fairly obvious that a simple decision like that would make all
[00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:41.680]   the difference in the world.
[00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:44.920]   Jim Rogers had a famous quote, or had a quote, I don't know if it's famous or not, but it's
[00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:48.920]   something that's always stuck with me since I read his book when I was in high school.
[00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:52.240]   He wrote this book called, I think it was Adventure Capitalist.
[00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:54.240]   I think that was the one with him and his car.
[00:40:54.240 --> 00:41:00.600]   Jim Rogers was a stock fund guy, a mutual fund manager, maybe a hedge fund guy, I can't
[00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:01.600]   remember.
[00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:02.920]   Very successful trader.
[00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:07.200]   And I got interested in him, stumbled across his book in the library because he had this
[00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:11.280]   book of this yellow car that was built on a four-wheel drive chassis.
[00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:12.920]   And I grabbed it and I just thought it was so interesting.
[00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:13.920]   I read his story.
[00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:19.280]   And what happened was he took a Mercedes, he had made a lot of money, decided he wanted
[00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:20.280]   to travel around the world.
[00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:24.920]   Younger in his life, I think in the 80s, he had motorcycled across China and that had
[00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:26.800]   changed his perspective of the world.
[00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:30.200]   And then he had made a lot of money and he and his wife, I think his third wife at the
[00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:35.520]   time, or maybe second, I don't remember, but he bought a Mercedes G-Wagon, a Glenda Wagon,
[00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:39.520]   Glenda Wagon, and Wagon, I guess, a G-Wagon.
[00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:44.360]   And he had them take the body off of it and he had them put the Mercedes convertible body
[00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:47.120]   onto it, which they adjusted.
[00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:50.360]   And so he had this wacky looking car and then he made a little trailer for it and he proceeded
[00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:52.880]   to drive around the world visiting all these countries.
[00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:57.120]   So I read his book and I don't remember if it was in that book or later, but he had this
[00:41:57.120 --> 00:42:07.400]   saying where he said that a wealthy, or sorry, a smart man in 1800 would have moved to London.
[00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:12.000]   And what I would add is a smart man in 1800 would have moved to London and had his fortune
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   made.
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:16.960]   A smart man in 1900 would have moved, I think he said to New York City, maybe San Francisco,
[00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:20.020]   I can't remember, but would have moved to New York City or San Francisco.
[00:42:20.020 --> 00:42:23.340]   And I would add, would have had his fortune pretty well made.
[00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:27.600]   Just the simple fact of moving to New York City or moving to San Francisco in 1900 would
[00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:30.840]   have put you in contact with so much opportunity.
[00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:35.000]   A smart man in 2000 would have moved to Singapore.
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:39.800]   One fifth of every resident or citizen of Singapore is a millionaire today.
[00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:43.240]   It's one of the most incredible success stories of the 21st century.
[00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:47.080]   It's an amazing story.
[00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:51.560]   And I think if you think about that, you can see how being in the right place where there's
[00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:56.800]   this social growth, where there's this growth of economy, growth of opportunity can put
[00:42:56.800 --> 00:43:01.860]   you where you can see the opportunities more easily.
[00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:05.840]   If you're living in Poughkeepsie, Illinois, is that a place?
[00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:16.200]   Or I don't know, Polk County, Florida, or rural Kansas or rural South Dakota or something
[00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:20.820]   like that, it's very hard to imagine what's happened in Singapore.
[00:43:20.820 --> 00:43:25.000]   But if you had gone to Singapore and seen it and observed it, it would have opened your
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   eyes.
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:30.300]   I mean, for me, the most eye-opening experience I had from this perspective was the first
[00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:32.080]   time I went to Hong Kong.
[00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:34.080]   As I remember, I think it was in college at the time.
[00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:35.940]   I think it was 2005.
[00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:39.040]   It was the time when – maybe it was 2004.
[00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:45.520]   It was the time when they had the tsunami in Indonesia and Thailand.
[00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:48.200]   I was in Hong Kong when that happened at Christmas.
[00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:49.800]   And I went to Hong Kong.
[00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:52.400]   And when I had been in high school, I had gone to New York City and I'd always been
[00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:53.400]   impressed with New York City.
[00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:54.400]   I thought it was great.
[00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:56.920]   And then I went to Hong Kong.
[00:43:56.920 --> 00:44:01.640]   And I arrived in Hong Kong and I looked around and I couldn't believe my eyes.
[00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:05.360]   I spent days walking around the city by myself with no purpose.
[00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:06.360]   I walked through Kowloon.
[00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:08.440]   I walked through Hong Kong Island.
[00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:09.880]   I spent time in the new territories.
[00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:14.800]   I would wander in and out of random shops and wandering out of restaurants and bars
[00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:16.800]   and just wandering around.
[00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:20.480]   And it was just the most overwhelming thing I'd ever seen.
[00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:26.160]   I thought never in my life will I ever think that New York City is a world-class city compared
[00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:29.160]   to Hong Kong.
[00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:30.160]   That was my experience.
[00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:33.520]   It was what started to open my eyes when you start to see, wait a second, this is totally
[00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:36.880]   different.
[00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:39.440]   So I personally think, to me, it's the most obvious thing.
[00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:45.280]   It's fairly obvious that the growth in the next couple of decades is going to come from
[00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:48.440]   Asia, possibly from Africa.
[00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:51.040]   Why?
[00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:57.440]   Uncertain growth, no debt, no empire, no decades of promises that have to be bankrupted
[00:44:57.440 --> 00:45:01.800]   their way out of, which is going to create intense instability in the society.
[00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:06.900]   In the coming years and years when the United States starts to fulfill fewer and fewer of
[00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:11.380]   its promises, it's going to create more and more instability, unhappiness, because people
[00:45:11.380 --> 00:45:13.760]   are going to depend on that.
[00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:18.480]   So unless there's some unexpected massive economic wave, which I don't know where it's
[00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:24.320]   going to come from, it's going to create instability in the society.
[00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:33.720]   And then you've got the opportunity for standards of living to rise much farther in Laos or
[00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:42.120]   Cambodia than you have in Munich or in Paris.
[00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:47.280]   So to me, it seems obvious.
[00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:51.780]   Now there are industries in that place where I went a little long on kind of countries,
[00:45:51.780 --> 00:45:55.920]   but the point is that just being in a physical geographic location can make a big difference
[00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:58.320]   for you.
[00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:06.280]   Physical geographic location, industry selection, and then career or job within an industry,
[00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:09.040]   these are things that make a big difference.
[00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:14.920]   Now, thus far, I went a little longer and deeper on careers than I meant to, but this
[00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:19.400]   is the biggest ticket for most people, be it your career or job or be it your career
[00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:20.800]   or business.
[00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:23.200]   If you can get a business where you can serve people, you can do it.
[00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:26.360]   So back to an example of a dying industry.
[00:46:26.360 --> 00:46:29.680]   I have tried several times to get several of my friends who are real estate agents in
[00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:33.760]   the United States to leave the United States and to go and set up a real estate agency
[00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:37.480]   in other countries, many other countries around the world.
[00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:38.480]   Why?
[00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:42.880]   Well, I think that you can take something that, in my opinion, is a dying industry or
[00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:48.240]   career profession or a profession that has dim prospects, at least in the way that it's
[00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:53.400]   currently done, in a place like the United States, and you can take it to another place
[00:46:53.400 --> 00:46:59.200]   and it can be a tremendously valuable profession in another place.
[00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:06.040]   You can take your real estate business in the United States and go to Central or South
[00:47:06.040 --> 00:47:11.560]   America, and if you'll take the same level of service, the same level of efficiency,
[00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:18.000]   the same level of sales training, customer service, et cetera, you can possibly build
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:25.160]   a national empire in a way that allows you to have major competitive advantages and allows
[00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:31.680]   you to serve your customers and build a much more powerful system.
[00:47:31.680 --> 00:47:36.860]   So a geographic change is one tool, but it's not the only tool.
[00:47:36.860 --> 00:47:40.720]   There are many other tools to look at, to think about where can I grow this.
[00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:46.080]   So if you're in something that's declining, think about how you can adapt, adjust, change.
[00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:51.040]   And remember, you're only ever a few years away from a brand new life.
[00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:59.480]   You could be today a truck driver, a truck driver, long haul trucking across Canada,
[00:47:59.480 --> 00:48:00.560]   and you say, "You know what?
[00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:03.960]   I think my job has a relatively short lifespan.
[00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:09.200]   I think that self-driving trucks are probably going to be making their presence known very
[00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:11.280]   intensively within five or 10 years.
[00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:13.720]   I need to be thinking about this."
[00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:22.160]   And in three or four or five years, you can be completely retooled, reeducated, re-equipped
[00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:24.400]   for a brand new career.
[00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:30.000]   You could be the world's leading cryptocurrency programmer or the world's leading cryptocurrency
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:32.480]   expert within a few years.
[00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:36.200]   You could grab yourself, spend your time in your truck studying everything there is to
[00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:39.400]   know about cryptocurrency, thinking through the issues, thinking about how to organize
[00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:42.720]   them, understanding the applications for blockchain technology.
[00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:46.080]   At night, instead of watching movies in the cab of your truck, you're sitting there spending
[00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:49.320]   time studying the companies, understanding the innovators.
[00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:51.660]   You take your time off to go to the conferences.
[00:48:51.660 --> 00:48:54.260]   You start a web program, a podcast.
[00:48:54.260 --> 00:48:58.380]   You start a thing that gets you in front of all these people all around the world.
[00:48:58.380 --> 00:48:59.880]   You become known as the go-to guy.
[00:48:59.880 --> 00:49:03.600]   You go ahead and get that master's degree from the University of Malta.
[00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:07.200]   It costs you 10,000 euros, by the way, for the whole thing.
[00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:10.840]   Get the master's degree from the University of Malta in blockchain technology.
[00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:16.520]   And five years from now, you can be one of the world's most sought-after pundits or practitioners
[00:49:16.520 --> 00:49:22.360]   in the world of blockchain technology, investing your money with the winners along the way.
[00:49:22.360 --> 00:49:27.120]   We're all three, four, five, maybe 10 years at the maximum away from a completely different
[00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:28.280]   lifestyle.
[00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:34.840]   So don't be sad if your career is not lining up with where there's an opportunity for really
[00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:36.800]   good beta.
[00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:42.000]   Just recognize that this is a fact and I need to change and adjust.
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:43.000]   What about investments?
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:48.920]   Well, I think with investments, I have less to say here, but I would say that with investments,
[00:49:48.920 --> 00:49:52.600]   you need to focus on beta before you focus on alpha.
[00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:57.320]   For example, I think this is why in real estate do you have the saying, "Location, location,
[00:49:57.320 --> 00:49:58.320]   location, location."
[00:49:58.320 --> 00:50:04.960]   Well, because if you buy the best house in a bad neighborhood, you're going to lose your
[00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:10.920]   shirt from an investment perspective versus buying the worst house in the best neighborhood.
[00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:11.920]   Why?
[00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:16.640]   Well, that has to do with location, the things that people find desirable.
[00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:21.840]   If you have a walkable apartment in a downtown area in a major city, that's going to be forever
[00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:26.280]   more desirable than a place kind of out on the fringes.
[00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:28.800]   If you're dealing at the upper end of the market, you're serving the wealthy.
[00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:30.680]   That's generally going to be more insulated.
[00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:31.680]   Why?
[00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:36.400]   Because wealthy people suffer less during economic instability.
[00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:38.200]   There's many other ways to apply it.
[00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:42.800]   I don't know how you apply this in the stock market.
[00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:46.320]   For example, I'm not saying you should just sell all your index funds and go and buy real
[00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:47.320]   estate in Bangkok.
[00:50:47.320 --> 00:50:50.940]   I don't think that would be a good idea.
[00:50:50.940 --> 00:50:55.160]   One of the nice things that you are engaged in, and one of the wonders of the modern financial
[00:50:55.160 --> 00:51:00.960]   world, when you own well-run investments, when you own companies on the New York Stock
[00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:05.640]   Exchange, those companies are every day strategizing about how to earn their income from these
[00:51:05.640 --> 00:51:07.200]   growing markets.
[00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:13.920]   Coca-Cola Corporation is every day looking and saying, "How do we sell more Coke products?"
[00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:18.360]   Apple Computers is saying, "How do we sell more Apple products all around the world?"
[00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:20.520]   Samsung, every single one.
[00:51:20.520 --> 00:51:26.040]   You can benefit, even if you own a stock that is publicly traded in the United States or
[00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:31.680]   London or wherever, that stock can still be benefiting from the growth around the world.
[00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:38.320]   So while I think that the US economy is in a malaise, it doesn't by definition mean that
[00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:41.760]   the US stock market is going to have the same experience.
[00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:46.480]   You might find it much more exciting and a much better experience to go and be involved
[00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:51.160]   in something on the frontier markets, but you might not.
[00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:54.440]   So I don't know how to guide you on that.
[00:51:54.440 --> 00:51:55.440]   I have some ideas.
[00:51:55.440 --> 00:51:58.320]   I'm investing my money in areas where I think there's growth.
[00:51:58.320 --> 00:52:02.200]   I guess maybe one obvious example would be something like cryptocurrency.
[00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:07.080]   You've seen this amazing run-up in cryptocurrency, supercharged this last week with the announcement
[00:52:07.080 --> 00:52:12.600]   that more and more large US companies are devoting large holdings to Bitcoin.
[00:52:12.600 --> 00:52:17.520]   There was just the announcement a couple of days ago, the first DeFi index fund, which
[00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:20.380]   is kind of an exciting development as well.
[00:52:20.380 --> 00:52:24.800]   So if you think that there's a future of cryptocurrency, if you think that there's a future of blockchain,
[00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:31.440]   I do personally, then just simply allocating some of your money to it can put you in line
[00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:36.680]   with the beta, even if you don't necessarily have the solution for what's going to be the
[00:52:36.680 --> 00:52:37.680]   winner.
[00:52:37.680 --> 00:52:41.000]   Do I know whether Bitcoin is going to be the currency of choice 20 years from now?
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:42.000]   I don't know.
[00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:44.120]   I don't know.
[00:52:44.120 --> 00:52:45.120]   Do I know?
[00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:46.120]   I don't know.
[00:52:46.120 --> 00:52:53.600]   Ethereum or Bitcoin Cash or Share Ring or Dogecoin, I don't know.
[00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:54.600]   What's going to be the winner?
[00:52:54.600 --> 00:52:57.200]   I don't know.
[00:52:57.200 --> 00:53:00.080]   But you can start to expose yourself to the beta.
[00:53:00.080 --> 00:53:03.080]   I think that these places, these are going to, my personal opinion, these are going to
[00:53:03.080 --> 00:53:06.480]   be around and they're going to be a very, very large growth industry.
[00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:07.480]   Why?
[00:53:07.480 --> 00:53:13.240]   Because it solves some significant problems for people, which is exciting.
[00:53:13.240 --> 00:53:20.520]   So in conclusion, think about the beta in your life.
[00:53:20.520 --> 00:53:28.400]   Think about, am I positioned to gain a benefit from beta?
[00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:34.840]   You don't have to, if you see everyone going out to California for a gold rush, you don't
[00:53:34.840 --> 00:53:37.760]   have to strike it rich on a particular claim.
[00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:42.600]   You can just say, everyone's moving to California and you can go and start selling them their
[00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:44.880]   shovels.
[00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:50.560]   I've tried to use as many historical examples as I can think of, but historical examples
[00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:55.400]   are easy because you can see them in the hindsight, but they're harder in the present because
[00:53:55.400 --> 00:53:56.800]   you can get it wrong.
[00:53:56.800 --> 00:54:04.080]   What I'll tell you is that in my life personally, the more time that I spend just simply analyzing
[00:54:04.080 --> 00:54:09.400]   things and going with my gut and thinking, no, I'm not going to buy this line that somehow
[00:54:09.400 --> 00:54:14.920]   I'm incapable of outperforming the market in the wrong way that I did when I was younger.
[00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:16.960]   Rather, I'm a smart guy.
[00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:18.600]   I can look around, I can see the world.
[00:54:18.600 --> 00:54:21.440]   I can understand that most people are just about like me.
[00:54:21.440 --> 00:54:22.880]   We're all pretty similar, right?
[00:54:22.880 --> 00:54:24.440]   Maybe 90% similar.
[00:54:24.440 --> 00:54:29.080]   We all have similar desires, et cetera, and I can see the long ranging trends and I don't
[00:54:29.080 --> 00:54:35.800]   have to get it perfectly right to benefit from the general trend.
[00:54:35.800 --> 00:54:40.320]   I don't have to get it perfectly right to benefit from the general trend.
[00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:45.200]   And then if you'll incorporate the safety of what I talked about in the last show of
[00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:53.240]   ratios, of thinking through your positions, of spreading things around based upon a way
[00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:57.680]   that makes sense to you, and I'll make sure that I'm just cautious and I don't take a
[00:54:57.680 --> 00:55:03.240]   wipe out risk, now I think you've got a winning formula.
[00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:06.840]   I hope that you'll share this show with young people.
[00:55:06.840 --> 00:55:09.960]   I hope that you'll teach them these concepts because these are some of the concepts that
[00:55:09.960 --> 00:55:12.720]   I wish that somebody had taught me.
[00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:15.920]   And I feel sometimes I feel like I'm 20 years too late.
[00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:20.520]   Like if I had just known this at 15 years old, man, I would have finally had done that.
[00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:23.680]   At 15 years old, I would have just been so much more successful.
[00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:27.040]   Well, unfortunately that was then and this is now.
[00:55:27.040 --> 00:55:31.520]   But the point is I can still apply these things today and so can you.
[00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:32.840]   Thank you for listening to today's show.
[00:55:32.840 --> 00:55:37.000]   In closing, I guess I should just share with you that you should check out my career and
