[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:25.120]   I'm here with Duncan, as we are each week. We get a lot of questions from people. A lot
[00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.940]   more tax questions this week, so we're going to break back on Bill Sweet. We've actually
[00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:33.400]   got a lot of follow-up questions, if you remember. Our email here is askthecompoundshow@gmail.com.
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.960]   Today's show is sponsored by Liftoff, our automated investing platform, powered by Betterment.
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.960]   Duncan, one of the cool things about Liftoff, I was looking at the asset allocation for
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.880]   my kids. When I started their accounts, it signed up. I said, "Go aggressive," and I
[00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.800]   think it gave me like a 90/10 split. I thought about this recently. I was looking at it,
[00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.100]   and I said, "You know what? This doesn't make any sense. They need to be 100% in stock.
[00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.860]   Let's make a change." One of the cool behavioral nudges that they have on their system is,
[00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.440]   you go to make an allocation change. Before you do it, it says, "Wait, wait, wait. Let's
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.120]   think about this. What are the tax implications?" Because this is a taxable account. I like
[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.300]   how they just give you that little nudge. I'm not going to name any names. Some other
[00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:14.640]   platforms would like you to make those changes no matter what. They pop champagne bottles
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.680]   and confetti every time you make a trade. Liftoff and Betterment are not like that.
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.000]   They want you to be thoughtful about making changes you propose. If you want to check
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:30.320]   it out, talk to one of our advisors. Take a look. Liftoffinvest.com. All right. Let's
[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.840]   do it. First question.
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:38.800]   Okay. Wow. Diving right in. I got nothing. I was in Miami this week.
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.760]   I thought you were going to have some jokes or something you came back from Miami with.
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:44.760]   Nothing?
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:50.760]   The only joke on me is, there's a lot of money there. How's that?
[00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:51.760]   Seems like it.
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:52.760]   Yes. No.
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.440]   I hear everyone always says, when you talk about Miami, everyone says something about
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.260]   Brickell. Should I say an obligatory, "Oh, did you go to Brickell?"
[00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.280]   That's the Brooklyn of Miami, I guess?
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.400]   I have no idea. I've never been.
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.600]   It makes me question my life decisions every time I go somewhere warm when I come back
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:14.320]   and there's snow on the ground and it's 14 degrees, but there's trade-offs here. One
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.120]   of these days, Miami is going to be wiped off the map by a hurricane. This is a trade-off
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.120]   you make.
[00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.120]   That's the give and take, right.
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.120]   Yeah.
[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.120]   All right.
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.120]   Let's do it.
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.800]   Up first, I've just come across your blog post from 2016 called "Deconstructing 30-Year
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:33.480]   Stock Market Returns." Thank you for that. It was about exactly what I was looking for,
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.520]   and I wonder if you've updated your findings since then. Also, have you run the analysis
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.880]   for other time periods? 10-year and 20-year rolling averages would also be interesting.
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.800]   So, we're digging deep, going back in your library.
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.120]   Yeah. So, Matthew McConaughey did his book tour a couple of years ago. Someone asked
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.160]   him about his writing process, and he said, "I don't write to remember. I write to forget."
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.900]   I guess it's kind of the way -- so, he's like, "I want to journal so I know how I'm feeling
[00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.520]   at any particular moment, and I can kind of go back and see where I was at that time."
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.880]   I guess I feel kind of the same way about blogging. I never thought I would compare
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.520]   myself to Matthew McConaughey, but here we are. All right, all right, all right. I'm
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.520]   not going to do it.
[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.160]   So, I've written a lot of blog posts, and I kind of forgot about this one. So, I looked
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:20.160]   back at it. It was in 2016. John, pull up the blog post if you can. Maybe we didn't
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:26.040]   have that. So, what I did at the time was, I looked at the data on rolling 30-year annual
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.840]   returns for the stock market. I have data going back to 1926 from our friends at Dimensional
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.160]   Fund Advisors, and their Returns 2.0 database. So, I'm happy to update this one, because
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.440]   it's been a while. 2016 was a while ago. So, I'm happy to do the 10- and 20-year numbers
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.720]   too, right? Because this is kind of my thing. I like looking at long-run data for the stock
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.240]   market, provide that context. So, let's look at the 10-year numbers, John. So, this is
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:53.160]   rolling 10-year returns, 1926 through January 2023. The best 10-year return of all time,
[00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.520]   these are using monthly returns, a little more than 21% per year for 10 years, ending
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:04.000]   in 1959. That's a total return of 600%, call it. Pretty good. Worst 10-year return, the
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.800]   10 years ending August 1939. The stock market was down 5% per year almost. That's a total
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:14.240]   return of a loss of about 40%. The 1930s were no joke, obviously. You still can see, though,
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:19.160]   even in the 10-year return numbers, a decade is a long time to invest. There's still a
[00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.040]   lot of variation in here, right? Between really great and really poor numbers. Let's look
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.240]   at the 20-year returns, see if that does a little better. Alright, 20-year returns. Now,
[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.040]   we're looking a little better, because there's nothing in the red here. There has been no
[00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.880]   20-year period in the U.S. stock market with losses, right? So, these dates at the bottom
[00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:41.600]   are the ending dates, right? Best 20-year return, a little more than 18%. That was at
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:46.640]   the peak of the market in early 2000, right? Starting in the early 1980s through March
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:53.080]   of 2000, 18% per year. Pretty good. Worst 20-year return, a little less than 2% per
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:58.480]   year. That's the 20 years ending in the summer of 1949. Makes sense, because you're talking
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:02.200]   about the Great Depression and World War II. So, if you have really poor returns, that
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.840]   seems like the time that would make sense. But again, no times where you had a 20-year
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.720]   period with a loss. That's pretty good. Alright, last one, 30-year. This is one of my favorite
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:15.760]   all-time long-term charts. You can see, the variation is compressed here. Best 30-year
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:21.800]   return since 1926, almost 15% per year. It's the 30 years ending in 1968, which kind of
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.120]   makes sense, because it coincides. The start of that period was when the worst 10-year
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:31.160]   return ended in 1939. So, you go from the worst 10-year return to the best 30-year return.
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:36.200]   Not bad. Now, here's one of my favorite long-term stats about the market. Worst 30-year return
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:41.200]   of all time, 7.8% per year, starting in September 1929. So, you top-tick the Great Depression.
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:45.780]   John, you can do a chart off here. Duncan, that 7.8% per year over 30 years. Maybe I've
[00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:49.680]   shared this with you before. Wait, that's the worst? The worst annual return. What's
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:55.800]   that on a total return basis over 30 years? So, the worst total return you've ever experienced
[00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:04.000]   in the U.S. stock market over 30 years? I don't know. All right. 850%, including dividends.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.480]   So, that's the worst 30-year return you've ever got. Obviously, usual caveats apply here.
[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:15.520]   I didn't take taxes into account, or fees, or any of that stuff. Out of the way. But
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:20.360]   still, that's pretty darn good, right? I take that. I mean, you had to live through that
[00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:23.440]   time period. You had to live through the Great Depression, and World War II, and all this
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:29.040]   other bad stuff going on. Deflation, all this stuff. The most recent 30-year return through
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:36.320]   January 2023. Gain of 9.8% annually. 20-year return through then, 10.3%. 10 years was 12.7%.
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:40.480]   Pretty good numbers if you ask me, right? I don't know what long-term returns will be
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:45.560]   in the future. In a recent show, I argued they could be lower. It wouldn't surprise
[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:50.840]   me. But in that 2016 PETA, I looked at three non-overlapping 30-year periods. Because these
[00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:53.560]   are rolling, so some of them aren't going to have the same returns, right? So, you think,
[00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:56.440]   what if we just broke them in and they're not overlapping at all? So, I looked at like
[00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:07.640]   1926-1955, 1956-1985, 1986-2015. And the respective returns were like 10.7%, 9.6%, and 10% for
[00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:13.120]   those 30-year returns, right? And all of these periods had really nasty stuff going on. So,
[00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:17.560]   again, the '30s to the '50s had the Great Depression, stock market crash of more than
[00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:22.600]   80%, World War II, Korean War, four recessions. The next 30-year period had Civil Rights Movement,
[00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:27.240]   the Vietnam War, one president was assassinated, one president was forced to resign, oil price
[00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:33.180]   shock, double-digit inflation, huge interest rates, six recessions. And that '86-2015 period
[00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:39.680]   had Black Monday, 1987, saving and loans crisis, Desert Storm, 9/11, Iraq-Afghanistan Wars,
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:42.860]   Great Financial Crisis, and three recessions, right? You can point to really bad stuff in
[00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:45.800]   all those periods. Just think about what's transpired since then, since I wrote this
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:50.480]   in 2016. We had an insurrection at the Capitol, a global pandemic, oil prices went below zero,
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:54.560]   inflation at 40-year highs, all that stuff. Returns have still been pretty good, right?
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:58.600]   So, obviously we're not going to be promised anything going forward. I don't know what's
[00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:02.680]   going to happen in the future. But it's hard to look at these numbers and not be optimistic
[00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:05.640]   about the future. I think if you're betting against human progress, do so at your own
[00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:07.320]   peril. That's my general take.
[00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:08.480]   Yeah, well said.
[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:12.320]   And I think we're all going to have, even if you're approaching retirement, we've talked
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:17.960]   about this in the past, you could still have a 20- or 30-year period ahead of you. As always,
[00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:20.340]   I think the long run almost always wins. Undefeated.
[00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:28.520]   And that's why we weather up so much, right? Just kidding, just kidding. Definitely don't
[00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:29.520]   do that.
[00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:30.520]   All right, let's do another one.
[00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:31.960]   Okay, up next we have a question from --
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:34.640]   Oh, wait, hang on, before we get to this. Someone in the comments said you wanted Miami
[00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:37.680]   take. Someone asked, "How many Miami vices did Ben have?" I think before we got in here
[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:40.360]   I said I had three, by the pool, right?
[00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:42.840]   That's the best poolside drink there is.
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:46.000]   Can you drink one anywhere else? I mean, it pretty much has to be by a pool, right?
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.560]   You have to have sun and you have to have -- yeah, it's the when in Rome thing, when
[00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:50.560]   in Miami, you have to do it.
[00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:54.000]   Like, I can't go in a cellar bar in Brooklyn and get a Miami vice.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.360]   No, no, no. If you're ordering a drink from a guy with a mustache and high-waisted pants,
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:01.080]   then no, you can't order Miami vice.
[00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:02.800]   Right, right. And suspenders, yeah.
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:03.800]   Next one.
[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:09.240]   Okay. Up next we have a question from Will, a young viewer, a student. I'd love to see
[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:13.140]   that. We love to see that we have students watching. Huge fan of the show. I'm a finance
[00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:17.200]   student at Michigan State and I have a question about bonds. I know the bond market is on
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:20.880]   fire right now and I'm wondering how to get in. Listening to your channel has truly paid
[00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:25.440]   dividends towards my education and I recommend it to anyone trying to break into finance.
[00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:28.840]   That second part was immaterial but I left it in because we like compliments.
[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:32.400]   Yeah, we'll take it. Not to brag. Will, good for you for paying attention to this stuff
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:36.520]   when you were in college. I'm not even sure I realized the stock market existed until
[00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:40.280]   I was maybe a senior in college and I had to figure out what I want to do with my life.
[00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:44.480]   I couldn't have told you what a bond was. None of that. I was more interested in extracurriculars,
[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:48.160]   which explains the Miami vices. I have to say, this is the first time we've ever heard
[00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:53.900]   anyone clamoring to get into the bond market, right? And I guess with interest rates much
[00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:57.120]   higher now and more interest in fixed income, I thought it would be a good idea, especially
[00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:01.240]   for someone like Will, but our regular listeners too, let's do a good bond primer for everyone.
[00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:07.280]   I want to look at the different risks of investing in bonds. So first one is interest rate risk.
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:10.800]   So this one, one of those important things to understand about bonds, bond prices and
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:15.360]   interest rates are inversely related, right? When rates move up, bond prices go down. When
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:19.760]   rates fall, bond prices rise. This makes sense when you consider if you have a 5% bond that
[00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:24.020]   you're holding, Duncan, and rates go to 4%, your bond should be worth more. If rates go
[00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:27.880]   to 6%, your bond should be worth less. The other important factor to understand about
[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:32.260]   interest rates is that bonds typically provide a good estimate, the starting yields typically
[00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:35.720]   provide a good estimate of your long-term return on bonds. John, do a chart on here
[00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:41.360]   of the five-year Treasuries. This is the starting yield of the blue line. Orange line is your
[00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:46.000]   subsequent five-year annual return. Those are pretty close, right? The correlation between
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.980]   the starting yield and the ensuing five-year return is 0.92. So that's a strong to quite
[00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:56.000]   strong relationship. Now, it may seem obvious that a five-year bond would have a yield that
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.800]   the starting yield matches its five-year return, but this works for other maturities, too.
[00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:03.260]   I've done this for five-year, seven-year, ten-year. Pick a return over the long-term.
[00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:08.020]   You're starting to yield on bonds. Less some sort of default/credit risk, which we're going
[00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:12.080]   to get into, and that's kind of where you end up. So, duration risk is probably the
[00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:17.000]   next thing. So, duration is a good proxy for how sensitive your bonds are to changes in
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.480]   rates. It's a number that's expressed in years because it basically tells you how long it'll
[00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:25.200]   take to get your whole money back, right? Principal plus the yield. So, it's a little
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:29.400]   less than the maturity. The good rule of thumb here is, the longer your maturity, the higher
[00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:33.560]   your duration, and thus the more volatility you experience to changes in rates. So, the
[00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:37.860]   other rule of thumb is, the decent approximation is, your duration will tell you how much your
[00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:42.200]   bond will move relative to a 1% moving interest rate. So, let's say you have a bond with a
[00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:47.400]   duration of 3.5 years. If rates go up 1%, you should expect your bond to drop 3.5%.
[00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:54.080]   If rates go down 1%, you should expect your bond to gain 3.5%, right? Those numbers aren't
[00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:57.880]   precise because there's this thing called convexity where bonds tend to lose less money
[00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:58.880]   than they gain.
[00:11:58.880 --> 00:11:59.880]   Yes, convexity.
[00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:05.820]   Yeah, sorry, close enough. The other one is, we talk a lot about government bonds. We won't
[00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:11.520]   even get into convexity, Duncan. It's not worth it. Credit risk is the other one. So, if you
[00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:15.920]   have corporate bonds or mortgage bonds or asset-backed bonds, you could have a downgrade.
[00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:19.500]   Why do bonds drop on a credit downgrade? Most likely it's because a lot of times they're
[00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:23.800]   just sold. Institutional buyers or ETFs or mutual funds can't hold them anymore because
[00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:28.120]   of their investment mandates. So, if you had a corporate bond that went from a high credit
[00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:33.000]   rating that was quality credit to high yield, a lot of ETFs and institutional investors
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.520]   probably can't hold those anymore if they have a mandate that they can't hold high-yield
[00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:41.680]   bonds. So, default risk is the next one. The long-term default risk for a high-yield junk
[00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:45.600]   bond is 3-4%. You can't really take your yield and high yield and say, "I'm going to get
[00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:48.760]   that going forward." You have to kind of lop off some for default. Obviously, that number
[00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:51.960]   is different depending on the economic environment that we're in, but you should take that number
[00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:56.360]   into account when having those expectations. Finally, the last one is inflation risk. This
[00:12:56.360 --> 00:13:00.600]   is the biggie. So, I looked at the numbers before for long-term bonds. This is just to
[00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:04.640]   illustrate a point here. From 1946 to 1980, long-term government bonds in the U.S. returned
[00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:10.680]   about 2% per year nominally. Not bad considering rates went from like 2% to 15% in this timeframe.
[00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:15.440]   So, people really worry about interest rates rising. That wasn't really that big of a deal,
[00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:19.200]   but inflation was almost 4.5% over this period. So, that means you lagged bigly on a real
[00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:23.040]   basis. How bad? Duncan, I'm not going to make you guess again. On an inflation-adjusted
[00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:28.800]   basis, long-term bonds were down 60% from 1946 to 1980. You just got crushed by inflation.
[00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:32.840]   This is an extreme example, but it goes to show you that, again, rising rates aren't
[00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:38.080]   as big of a deal for investors as high inflation or rising inflation. Rising rates, eventually,
[00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:41.680]   you pick up those higher yields, and that'll kind of help you a little bit. That's what's
[00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:44.960]   happening now. You had a really bad year, but now rates are higher, so investors are
[00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:49.340]   in a better place for bonds. So, listen, as a young person in college, I'm not sure you
[00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:52.800]   really need to worry about missing out on the bond market by any means. Bonds are still
[00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:56.880]   far more boring than the stock market. I mean, at least you can earn some higher yield, but
[00:13:56.880 --> 00:14:00.240]   if I was a young person, I'd be far more concerned with the stock market, because bonds can help
[00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:03.780]   with short-term, intermediate-term goals, but the stock market is still your best bet
[00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:07.440]   against hedging inflation. So, I'd still pay more attention to the stock market if I'm
[00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:10.200]   a young person. If you want to understand the bond market more, I'm sure you'll learn
[00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:14.720]   about it a little bit. But that was Ben's primary on bonds. How'd I do?
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:18.780]   That was good. I'm not going to lie, though. You still lost me a little bit there. Bonds
[00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:20.880]   are one of the most confusing topics to me as a non-finance person.
[00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:23.440]   What's the confusing part to you? Tell me the confusing part to you.
[00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:28.560]   Just like when you're saying, "If rates go up by this much, then it means that you're
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:34.080]   going to go down by the percent." It loses me as soon as I start hearing about that.
[00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:40.960]   Okay. So, if your duration is 10 and rates go up 1%, 1% is the key here, right? If rates
[00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:45.360]   go up 1%, you're going to go down 10% if your duration is 10. If rates go down 1%, you're
[00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:51.920]   going to go up 10%. Now, if rates go down 50 basis points, you're going to go up 5%.
[00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:54.820]   If rates go up 50 basis points, you're going to go down. See? That's the relationship.
[00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:58.200]   It's not exactly one-to-one, but it's pretty darn close.
[00:14:58.200 --> 00:14:59.200]   I got it.
[00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:03.560]   So, the longer your maturity, that makes sense that you have more volatility to changes in
[00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:06.760]   rates because there's so much more that can happen in that time frame. Rates can change
[00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:10.960]   more. Inflation can change more. Economic growth can change more. And so, it makes sense
[00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:13.760]   that shorter-term bonds have a lower duration than longer-term bonds.
[00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:17.080]   Right, right. Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:23.800]   So, Oatly has a duration of 974, give or take.
[00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:28.640]   Yeah, sure. It's looking good year-to-date. I think so, maybe.
[00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:30.640]   Let's do another question.
[00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:37.160]   Okay. Up next, we have a question from Dave. Have any of the Rihls tax bills -- and for
[00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:42.120]   those of you that are listening and are new to the show, these are people bills, not tax
[00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:47.520]   bills -- but have any of the Rihls tax bills encountered an online calculator for determining
[00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:54.740]   the RMDs, Required Minimum Distribution Rate, for a non-spousal IRA beneficiary, so-called
[00:15:54.740 --> 00:16:01.840]   inherited IRAs? I'd sure like access to one. It would help, I think, if the IRS updated
[00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:09.840]   Notice 2022-53 in the form of a proposed or, better yet, a final regulation so that taxpayers
[00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:15.040]   know if they will have a penalty tax if they don't take an RMD in 2023.
[00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:21.040]   This is from Dave. Dave went deep here. We're going to bring over our tax bills. We have
[00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:26.720]   a high concentration of bills in our tax department. Here's Mr. Bill Sweet. Bill, a lot of jargon
[00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:33.880]   going on here. I don't know where you want to start. Dave is locked in here. The IRS
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:40.820]   regulation notice, that's a first, so way to go, Dave. Dave is in the chat right now,
[00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:41.820]   I think.
[00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:44.280]   It goes right to the tax code. It's beautiful.
[00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:47.960]   So help me sort out this mess here. What's going on here?
[00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:52.600]   Yeah, so I came in late to the back show because I was working on some ribs, Duncan. I grew
[00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:57.480]   these from a pig and they are delicious. I got to tell you that. But John said, "Bill,
[00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:02.040]   your light's coming in hot," but it's not because Dave is coming in hot, citing IRS
[00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:06.880]   notices here. That was beautiful. The backstory here, the IRS changed the rules on us, right?
[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:11.280]   Really Congress did, excuse me. The old rules, Ben, used to be, what? You needed to take
[00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:15.800]   an IRA distribution within five years for an inherited IRA, right, if you inherit your
[00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:20.240]   uncle, your dad's IRA. But the old rule also allowed you to do what over your lifetime?
[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:26.800]   Do you remember? The good old days? Nothing? All right, stretch IRAs. So stretch IRAs.
[00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:27.800]   Stretch, okay.
[00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:28.800]   Yeah, do you remember the stretch IRA?
[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:29.800]   Right, right, stretch Armstrong.
[00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:33.600]   Stretch Armstrong. Okay, cool, cool, cool. So what Dave's referring to is the IRS when
[00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:34.600]   they rolled out-
[00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:36.360]   We needed a crickets thing there.
[00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:40.800]   Dave knew what I was talking about. When the IRS rolled out the Secure Act, they moved
[00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:44.380]   the RMD age up, which was great. But then they said, "Look, there's no more RMDs for
[00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:48.240]   inherited IRAs, but you need to take them all within 10 years," right? So now there's
[00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:53.800]   this 10-year window for anybody who inherits an IRA after 2020, and that includes this
[00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:57.120]   year. There was a gigantic freak-out from the people. They were like, "What about the
[00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:03.080]   kids and what about this?" The IRS came out, they changed the rules again, allowed eligible
[00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:07.840]   designated beneficiaries. And then last year, but still for the 10 years, they said, "No
[00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:12.520]   RMDs required. Don't worry about it, guys. Everybody's cool." But then last year, the
[00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:18.100]   IRS said, "Guess what? We researched the tax law a little bit more, and there are actually
[00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:23.700]   RMDs due for these 10-year RMDs, inherited IRAs, for a certain class of folks, for somebody
[00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:29.820]   who died after they started their RMD during their life time." This is a giant confusing
[00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:30.820]   mess.
[00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:33.400]   And it's kind of crazy that they don't just grandfather people into the old rules and
[00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:36.340]   say the new rules are going to start in five years or something.
[00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:40.220]   Yeah. Well, I guess they did, because if you inherited an IRA three years ago, you still
[00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:44.500]   are playing by the old rules. But what Dave's getting at, this is a mess. And his question
[00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:49.660]   is, "How do I sort this out?" I would go to a trusted custodian. I think that ultimately
[00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:54.460]   is the place to go. WeCustody, Bennett, at Schwab, at TD, at Fidelity, these are trusted
[00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:58.860]   third parties. They're the best in the business. I find Schwab's calculator to be very, very
[00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:02.860]   useful. We don't need to do a segment here on the differences of the rules, but basically
[00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:06.460]   they ask you a bunch of questions about your age, how old was the person you inherited
[00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:10.380]   the IRA from, when did they die, what type of IRA it is. You spit that all out, and it'll
[00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:14.580]   tell you, "Here's your RMD for this year. This is what you should do." Or, "There's
[00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:19.780]   no RMD required until year 10." I find Schwab's calculator to be roughly the best, and I would
[00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:23.140]   encourage anybody else to check it out and use it.
[00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:28.780]   Once again, we have job security for you, because it's a mess, right?
[00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:29.780]   Yeah. People...
[00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:30.780]   Trying to understand this stuff.
[00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:34.060]   Like I've said before, people hate paying taxes more than they like making money, Ben.
[00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:37.500]   And I think ultimately, if you understand nothing about what I just said, and you're
[00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:41.740]   dealing with an inherited IRA, you're right. This is a perfect advertisement, Dave, for
[00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:45.460]   the services of a certified financial planner. Ritholtz Wealth are among them. Just make
[00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:48.460]   sure they're an investment fiduciary, they're not a life insurance salesman, and they're
[00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:49.940]   trying to help you solve this problem.
[00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:53.100]   I don't know. Dave knows the IRS tax codes. Maybe he's going to find it on the calculator
[00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:54.320]   and do it himself.
[00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:58.620]   Can I comment, though, on his last part, which is, why haven't they finalized this? It is
[00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:03.660]   insane. And this, unfortunately, is the world we live in of below competence all of a sudden.
[00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:08.940]   But yes, just putting an IRS notice out saying, "Hey, you actually might be subject to RMDs.
[00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:12.300]   Sorry we didn't tell you for two years. You probably need to do something for the end
[00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:16.740]   of the year," and not even making that guidance final, I think this is a problem of governance.
[00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:20.140]   And I'm with Dave. It's a mess, and God save us all.
[00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:24.300]   Duncan, what was harder to understand, this one or the bond stuff?
[00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:25.300]   This one.
[00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:26.300]   I hope so.
[00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:30.020]   I mean, they both involve a lot of convexity.
[00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:34.100]   Convexity. Maybe I should show up to the meeting on time, right? So I'd be better prepared.
[00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:37.020]   But Dave, good luck to you. Send us an email if we can give you a hand.
[00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:38.020]   All right, next one.
[00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:42.180]   Thanks, Dave. Dave's always in the chat and always writing in good questions, so I'm glad
[00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:43.180]   we got to use one.
[00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:44.180]   Big ups to Dave.
[00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:48.940]   OK, so up next-- and I made my screen larger, so now I can actually read, so I won't stumble
[00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:51.060]   over this one as much, hopefully.
[00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:56.460]   All right, this question is from Sam. Do you think a backdoor Roth IRA is worth it? Assume
[00:20:56.460 --> 00:21:01.020]   that other tax-advantaged vehicles are maxed out and no traditional IRAs, so not concerned
[00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:05.660]   about the pro-rata rule. No idea what that means. I think if everything is maxed out
[00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:10.640]   and a higher earner wants to save more, options are backdoor Roth or brokerage account. Personally,
[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:15.160]   I feel like buying index ETFs in a brokerage account would be way easier, but not sure
[00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:19.400]   how to quantify the benefit of a backdoor Roth. So, your favorite topic here, backdoor
[00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:19.900]   Roth.
[00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:25.220]   Bill does like Roth IRAs. I'm kind of with Sam here on a lot of stuff. My first question
[00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:31.620]   is always, is it worth it? Is it worth the hassle and the paperwork? And even if I could
[00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:36.540]   make 25 basis points more per year over the long term, is it just easier for me to just
[00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:41.580]   take the easy route and stick it in index funds in a taxable account and call it a day?
[00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:42.580]   Bill, what say you?
[00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:47.140]   It's a great question. Sam, a very strong name. I named my firstborn son Sam, so I'm
[00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:53.540]   a big, big fan. My question for Sam is, do you like tax-free distributions? Is that something
[00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:58.900]   that would appeal to you? And I think the thought process is, if you have $6,500 to
[00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:03.180]   invest, and that's what we're talking about here, that's the IRA contribution limit for
[00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:08.740]   this year, would you rather get that back after it's grown? Rule of seven, $6,000 grows
[00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:14.740]   to $12,000 over 10 years, $24,000 over 20 years, $48,000 over 30 years. I mean, we're
[00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:19.940]   not talking about small bits of money if we're dealing with a 30-year, 40-year timeline.
[00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:24.740]   Do you want all of that investment gain, that $40,000 of gain, to come to you tax-free?
[00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:29.180]   Or do you want to pay tax on it? And that's the question. Is it worth it or not? So to
[00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:35.060]   quantify it, it's probably worth about $8,400 of tax. And so again, that is more than your
[00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:40.400]   initial contribution, assuming that you get a 7%, 8% return over the next 30 years. Do
[00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:44.820]   I think it's worth it? I think so. But like everything else, there's pros and cons. One
[00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:47.340]   of my famous charts here, there are pros and cons.
[00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:51.420]   I know, Duncan's already spit his water out all over. He's getting it right every time.
[00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:54.860]   Ultimately, there are pros and cons, right? So do you like tax-free distributions? We
[00:22:54.860 --> 00:23:00.240]   just talked about that. The cons of a taxable brokerage account are tax, tax, and tax. Tax
[00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:05.420]   number one, you have to pay tax every time a dividend hits that account, right? And Ben,
[00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:08.940]   where are yields today versus where they were two, three years ago, right? I mean, they're
[00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:09.940]   not nothing.
[00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:11.660]   We're probably talking, yeah, 2% dividend, maybe a little less.
[00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:15.820]   Yeah, OK for dividends. But maybe you have a balance of fixed income, like you can get
[00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:19.900]   4%, maybe 5% from a short-term treasury right now. Ultimately, you're going to give back
[00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:23.540]   about a third of that to taxes right along the way. And that decreases the compounding
[00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:25.300]   effect of your gains.
[00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:28.740]   Second tax, like I discussed, about $8,000. Assuming you wait for 30 years, you're going
[00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:33.620]   to pay $8,000 in income tax from a brokerage account versus nothing from a tax-free Roth
[00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:39.300]   IRA distribution. And finally, there's the tax on rebalancing. And that's a significant
[00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:44.380]   effect. If I move from a 60/40 to a 40/60 or whatever it is in an IRA, nothing happens
[00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:47.420]   tax-wise. It's only in the distribution that gets taxed.
[00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:51.700]   If I have a brokerage asset, Ben, if I don't pick my mutual fund wisely, if I want to move
[00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:55.920]   from mutual funds or ETFs, I need to eat that tax along the way with a brokerage account.
[00:23:55.920 --> 00:24:00.180]   So my question to you, Sam, do you want to pay tax on the gains or don't you? And the
[00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:03.540]   trade-off there is flexibility, right? For a Roth IRA, you really can't mess with it
[00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:06.180]   until you're 59 and 1/2.
[00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:09.720]   If we did the cage match between you and Nick Majulie, Nick has said-- he's made the argument
[00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:14.500]   before that you shouldn't max out your 401(k) because a brokerage account gives more flexibility
[00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:16.980]   if you're going to buy and hold a low-cost index fund.
[00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:22.160]   If, and if is a key question. And if you don't rebalance along the way, and if you don't
[00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:27.020]   like tax-free distributions, I don't think it's an either/or. I think it's a how much,
[00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:31.800]   right? And ultimately, what you want to have in your 60s and your 70s or 80s is diversification.
[00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:32.800]   You want tax diversification.
[00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:37.900]   And if this person is already maxing out retirement vehicles, they obviously like-- they like
[00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:42.060]   to have tax-deferred accounts, right? So they-- you'd think it would maybe would make sense
[00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:43.060]   for them.
[00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:44.060]   Yep. Exactly.
[00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:46.900]   Do you think-- do people like have a little party when they turn 59 and 1/2 because they
[00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:47.900]   can access this?
[00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:48.900]   I mean, I did for my dad.
[00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:53.580]   This is funny. It seems like my children who are eight years and younger, they still like
[00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:57.920]   to like kind of like celebrate their half birthday. Like, "Hey, I'm 5 and 1/2 now."
[00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:00.780]   So the only other time you do that is when you turn 59 and 1/2, I guess.
[00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:05.600]   Yeah, it's a big deal, Duncan. Yeah, you get the penalty and you get tax-free Roth distributions.
[00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:08.300]   Why wouldn't you want that, Sam? I say go for it.
[00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:11.260]   It's like when a young person talks about their, like, six-month anniversary or something,
[00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:12.820]   you know? And you're like, "Oh, that's--"
[00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:13.820]   Or dating.
[00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:14.820]   Sweet.
[00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:15.820]   You know, those cute little couples you're dating.
[00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:16.820]   Call me in 10 years.
[00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:17.820]   Yeah.
[00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:18.820]   All right.
[00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:19.820]   Exactly.
[00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:20.820]   Last question.
[00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:22.540]   Last but not least, we have a question from Eric. I really like this question a lot, and
[00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:23.900]   I'm curious to hear the answers.
[00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:27.140]   I just wanted to let Bill know, we've received multiple questions on this. This was the best
[00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:28.460]   one, but we've seen a lot of questions on this.
[00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:29.460]   Oh, OK. Let's do it.
[00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:30.460]   Right. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:34.940]   OK. So Eric writes, "I have two follow-up questions regarding the Roth 401(k) employer
[00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:39.380]   match topic you discussed a few weeks ago. How do taxes work on this portion? Say your
[00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:43.700]   employer matched 5% of your salary of $100,000. Would that mean that you end up with $5,000
[00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:49.020]   in your 401(k) as a Roth amount, or would that $5,000 be subject to income tax and leave
[00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:55.540]   you with less? Number two, do you need to contribute to your 401(k) as a Roth contribution
[00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:57.900]   in order to have your employer match be Roth?"
[00:25:57.900 --> 00:26:02.620]   OK, so just a reminder, we talked about this a few weeks ago with Bill, that now you have
[00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:08.620]   the ability to not only have a Roth 401(k), but get your company match in that 401(k)
[00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:12.900]   in the form of a Roth. I didn't know how this worked before, that if you had a Roth 401(k),
[00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:17.500]   you put your money in the Roth, but then your match with the company would be in a traditional
[00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:21.060]   401(k). Now, this year, it's changed, right? So, all right, Bill, I didn't think about
[00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:23.180]   the tax implications on me. Explain to me how this works.
[00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:27.260]   Yeah. And may I cope on my side? I made a mistake on the last program. I was thinking
[00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:33.660]   in my head about FICA income tax. A 5% matching Roth IRA contribution is going to be taxable
[00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:38.140]   income in the year that you receive it, right? That gets dumped into your account. But again,
[00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:42.260]   one last famous chart, so don't confuse. The question is, do you want to pay tax now or
[00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:45.660]   do you want to pay tax later, right? And so, it's the same dynamic.
[00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:49.620]   The addition to Bill's Roth IRA tattoo on the back is going to say, it's like a dragon
[00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:52.460]   tail. It's going to be like, "Do you like tax-free distributions?"
[00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:57.580]   Yeah. Well, that is the question. So, yeah, so then that matching contribution, it is
[00:26:57.580 --> 00:27:02.020]   taxable in the year received. What does not get taxed, though, is on FICA. You do not
[00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:09.060]   have to pay employment taxes on the matching contribution to a Roth 401(k) or a traditional
[00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:13.260]   401(k). So, that was a mistake I made last time. No, yes, there is income tax on the
[00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:18.700]   contribution. There is no FICA. And so, that creates a level playing field. And again,
[00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:22.540]   the question is, where's my tax rate going to be now versus where's my tax rate going
[00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:26.660]   to be in distribution? It's different for everybody. I think, while young, matching
[00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:32.980]   Roth contribution sounds absolutely peachy. So, this is essentially kind of like a backdoor
[00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:37.340]   Roth that you're doing in your 401(k), right? Yeah. Yeah, exactly. And so, their second
[00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:44.460]   question was, where is it? I forget. Oh, yeah. Do you need to contribute on a Roth in order
[00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:49.940]   to get the matching Roth? God's honest answer is, we don't know. Also, you contribute to
[00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:52.980]   a traditional, but then your match is in a Roth. Correct. Can you mix and match? Can
[00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:56.220]   you flip the switch? That's what I would want. Yeah, I mean, it sounds super cool, right?
[00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:59.420]   Best of both worlds. The honest answer is, we don't know. And the reason that we don't
[00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:04.120]   know is, the law just changed in December, right, for this year. It said immediately
[00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:08.820]   on passing the law December 27th, custodians, most custodians haven't rolled out the program
[00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:12.740]   on how to actually handle this. There's no IRS guidance that I'm aware of. Our custodian
[00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:17.220]   has not updated our plan. And I don't believe that Fidelity or anyone else has. So ultimately,
[00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:20.100]   this is something, these are answers that are coming. I would direct that question to
[00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:23.680]   your custodian. And it's very possible that they might interpret the rules a little bit
[00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:30.020]   differently than another plan. But again, I think it's awesome to have different choices.
[00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:34.140]   Ultimately, Congress wins because they're getting the taxable income now, right? And
[00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:37.940]   we have a massive budget hole. So why wouldn't you want to tax that income now? And you as
[00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:42.060]   an investor, you can pick and choose based on your situation. And again, I think for
[00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:45.900]   young people with a long time period to compound, it's very difficult.
[00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:49.460]   That's a good point about Congress getting the tax dollars now. I see people a lot of
[00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:51.700]   times over the years have asked me, don't you think eventually they're going to come
[00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:57.500]   after Roths? But no, the tax has already been paid. They already got it up front. They got
[00:28:57.500 --> 00:28:58.500]   it down payment.
[00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:00.100]   But what if they could tax it again?
[00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:04.820]   Right. So it is very possible. But I think it's rational just to plan on the tax code
[00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:10.820]   more or less staying the same, right? Yeah, it'd be catastrophic if Canada invaded and
[00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:14.580]   took over the U.S. and said, no more taxes at all. Like, great. Like you can go to these
[00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:15.580]   hypothetical rules.
[00:29:15.580 --> 00:29:18.240]   The tradeoff there is we get more Tim Hortons though.
[00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:19.240]   And maple syrup, Molsons.
[00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:22.460]   Yeah, you get ham sandwiches with donuts.
[00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:27.380]   Fim du Monde, just a classic. But back to Roth, I just think the more dollars you can
[00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:33.540]   cram into long-term compounding tax-free money, why would you not take that option early in
[00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:37.820]   your career and then switch that later on as you make more and more money in your career?
[00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:38.820]   Bill, you sold me.
[00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:41.060]   Great. I think I did about two years ago.
[00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:45.580]   I have one follow-up. For our Capitol Hill audience watching, what's your pitch? What
[00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:48.540]   would you ask them to do to make all this easier?
[00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:53.540]   Oh, we talked about it on the last show. TSP, open this thing to the masses. Like, why are
[00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:58.260]   401(k)s tied to employers? I don't want my employer making my investment decisions for
[00:29:58.260 --> 00:29:59.260]   me.
[00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:03.020]   Give us one limit. Make it $60,000 or whatever you're going to make it. It includes HSAs.
[00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:07.700]   It includes 529s. It includes 401(k). Put it all in the same bucket. Make it easy.
[00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:13.180]   I actually kind of like having Bill Sweet make my investment decisions for me.
[00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:17.620]   Flattery will get you everywhere. But yeah, TSP for the masses. The program exists. It's
[00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:21.580]   fantastic. And why not just make those contributions to payroll the same way you pay your payroll
[00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:24.060]   tax? You don't have to think about it, right? Wouldn't that be awesome?
[00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:29.260]   Perfect. I think Bill's other job security here on this show is we get an endless amount
[00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:33.820]   of Roth IRA questions every week. Honestly, taxes are taking over our inbox just along
[00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:34.820]   with bonds.
[00:30:34.820 --> 00:30:35.820]   Keep them coming.
[00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:38.780]   Because Duncan, I got a question from the stream here. People want to know, is the Fed
[00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:42.220]   shirt coming back? I got my Fed godfather shirt. People want to know if it's coming
[00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:43.820]   back to the store.
[00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:47.100]   Maybe if there's enough demand. I think Josh said that we might bring it back when they
[00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:53.580]   cut. But if you want to see it before then, let us know.
[00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:56.800]   Quick announcement here. No show next week. I'll be out of town because apparently spring
[00:30:56.800 --> 00:31:00.300]   break is not enough. Our kids now have to have a winter break. Or a mid-winter break.
[00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:01.300]   Get out of here.
[00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:02.300]   Yeah, so we're going somewhere.
