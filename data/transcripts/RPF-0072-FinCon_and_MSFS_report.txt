[00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.520]   3,200 mile road trip for about 600 bucks
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.280]   Hope you like it
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:23.080]   There's been a couple of weeks now since I've been here sitting in front of the microphone
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.000]   So today I'm gonna catch you up on my lessons learned from the last couple of weeks
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.240]   If this is your first time listening to the show feel free to stick on stick here and join us
[00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.360]   But this is gonna be a somewhat personal show
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.520]   Trying to just share with some of my friends in the audience some of the lessons that I've learned over the last couple of weeks
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:46.460]   If you're if you're not interested in this kind of stuff check back tomorrow for some more of our kind of mainstream content
[00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.680]   I am bringing you this information. However, though not just to talk to hear myself talk and hear myself
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.160]   Tell my stories I can do that with other people
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.400]   I'm gonna just share with you some of the lessons that I've learned over the last two two weeks and
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:04.360]   Because they are specifically related to finance. I think you'll find them interesting or at least I hope you find them interesting and
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.840]   So it's been a busy couple of weeks of travel
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.160]   And so I'm going to share with you the lessons from FinCon in New Orleans
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.160]   Which was two weeks ago
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.360]   Then the lessons from completing my residency requirement for my master's degree in financial planning
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.480]   From the American College up in Pennsylvania and then as a teaser to keep you with me
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:29.800]   I am going to share with you how I hacked this trip as kind of one of my personal fun
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:36.900]   Experiments to push the limits a little bit. We don't call the show radical personal finance for nothing. So let's start with FinCon
[00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:43.280]   FinCon started off. I think it was four or five years ago as something called the financial bloggers conference
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.840]   I think I first became aware of it a couple of years ago and
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:55.440]   Pat excuse me, Philip Taylor who has who runs it has since changed it to be FinCon to kind of be more inclusive than
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.440]   just financial bloggers I
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.840]   Last year wanted very much to go because I've always felt a real affinity for the financial blogging world
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.480]   But I wasn't able to go simply because I was in them
[00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.000]   You know, I was working for a broker-dealer wasn't able to get out from behind that and there was no point in my going
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.840]   At that time. So this year I was excited to be able to go and it was really it was really awesome
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:23.600]   It was really awesome. Now going into the trip. I was a little bit concerned about how it was gonna work out schedule wise. I
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:33.000]   Actually made a mistake when I was booking the trip and I didn't look at my calendar closely enough. I had previously scheduled to be in
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.560]   Pennsylvania I was in a town called Bryn Mawr, which I guess is just on the outside of Philadelphia
[00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.560]   And I had scheduled to be there to you know
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:48.760]   I've been scheduled for this for six months that for this residency requirements only offered twice a year once in April once in September
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.320]   and so I've been scheduled to go to that and then I saw FinCon and I scheduled to go to that and it was only
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:58.560]   Then that I looked at my calendar after I'd you know purchased tickets for both of them and kind of made arrangements
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.960]   It was only then that I looked at my calendar and figured out that
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:08.400]   That they were one day apart. So FinCon actually finished on Friday evening. Excuse me Saturday evening and
[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.640]   Then at about seven o'clock or so, although there was an after-party that I didn't go to but it finished about
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.320]   Yeah, Saturday evening and then on Monday morning at 8 a.m
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:25.280]   I was scheduled to be in class in Pennsylvania and this is important because I had planned and wanted to drive. I
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:31.680]   Could have flown obviously that's what most, you know, sane people would do but I particularly don't enjoy flying
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.240]   Not because I have any problem with flying. I actually like the flying part
[00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:41.080]   It's all the rest of it that I don't love and I like driving when it's a reasonable distance now my definition of reasonable
[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:47.360]   Distance is different than many people's definitions of reasonable distance
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:55.640]   Most people would not consider Florida to Louisiana to Pennsylvania a reasonable distance for a road trip, but I considered it so
[00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:00.760]   and I'll give you more details on that in a minute when I talk about kind of how I
[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:04.080]   Hacked this trip and in my own unique
[00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.920]   experimental way
[00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:10.400]   My wife and I have a constant ongoing
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:15.080]   Discussion over what is a reasonable distance to drive and what is a reasonable distance to fly?
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:20.840]   She would almost always choose to fly and I would almost always choose to drive. So we we have to work that out
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:26.840]   But this was surprising to me because I had planned to take my family with me and I had planned to make an event out
[00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.760]   Of FinCon. I'd never been in New Orleans. I figured I'd go a few days early
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:34.080]   I would you know get the lay of the land. We would do some tourist stuff. I'd hang out in Louisiana
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:39.280]   I eat some good Cajun food maybe go in the swamps or do something fun and and take my you know
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.280]   meander my way home again and
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.360]   Then I figured you know, I'd go to Pennsylvania haven't been to Philadelphia in a long time
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.480]   I figured I would make it into a fun trip and
[00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:55.080]   But when I looked at the schedule it just didn't happen so I wound up going by myself and and just simply
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:02.400]   Making it a quick trip mainly just focusing on business, but had an awesome experience at FinCon and it was really unique to me
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.560]   I've been to a lot of conferences. I guess maybe that's a little bit
[00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:11.160]   Excessive I've been to some conferences. I've been to many conferences. I like going to conferences. I learn a lot
[00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:15.600]   I find they're very very valuable. I find they're just I always get a lot out of them
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:19.600]   But FinCon was one of the most unique where I felt
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:24.000]   It's hard to say figure out how to say it. I felt more welcomed
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.200]   I felt like more of kind of like I belonged
[00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:34.280]   Because a bunch of oddball weird people who are all interested in finance and I like oddball weird people who are interested in finance
[00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:38.600]   That's my kind of gang. And so it really just felt incredibly comfortable right from the beginning
[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:45.400]   It just felt like I fit in many ways with this weird oddball community of financial people
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:50.440]   Trying to figure out how to change the world basically one day at a time and that was a unique experience
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:07:00.080]   It's been a while since I was able to enjoy such a community of people
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:05.520]   And the most interesting thing about it was the sheer variety of people
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:08.320]   As the conference has grown if my memory is right
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:14.200]   It was something like 600 people maybe a little under 600 people this year as the conference has grown there have been
[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:17.800]   There's been a development of
[00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:25.720]   Attendees so, you know started as financial bloggers and and financial bloggers, you know a few years ago
[00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:30.840]   There were just a few big ones and then some starting up and now the world of financial blogging is so massive
[00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:36.080]   and there's so many little niche blogs that that writers cover these little interesting topics and and
[00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:42.160]   So that's just interesting from the sheer variety, you know in the back in the day when I first started reading financial blogs
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:45.520]   I think maybe there was you know, here's some smart things to do with money
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:49.920]   I remember, you know lazy man and money and get rich slowly and
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:56.880]   The simple dollar I think those were the big big ones at that time the consumer commentary
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:01.800]   What were some of there were some other ones at that time back in the back in you know in those days?
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:05.560]   That were just basically I would call them just mainstream financial blogs
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:10.480]   But now I mean it's hard to get a mainstream financial blog like that to really work now
[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:17.000]   There's so many interesting niche blogs. You got guys and gals blogging about couponing and you got guys and gals blogging about
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.800]   You know getting out of getting out of debt and got guys and gals blogging about being multi millionaires
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:26.760]   You got all these interesting niches and so that makes for an interesting group of people
[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:30.920]   But even better than that is now the financial media world is not
[00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:34.920]   Confined to just blogging so I'm there
[00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:39.120]   I don't really have a blog other than the fact that it's necessary to have you know
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:44.200]   To set up an RSS feed to distribute this show, but for me my entire focus is on audio
[00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:47.040]   I'm trying to serve you the audience who is
[00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:51.160]   perhaps listening to me as you commute or drive or out on a run or
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:56.160]   Doing something where maybe working on something where you're not able to look at a screen
[00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:01.840]   So I'm not really interested in doing a lot of writing right now. I'm trying to serve you from an audio perspective
[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:05.560]   That's why sometimes if you're wondering that's why sometimes I choose to read
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.720]   Lengthier passages then and not just say we'll go to the link it always annoys me when podcasters will say go to the link
[00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:14.760]   And I'm need to think don't you realize I'm driving down the road here
[00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:18.360]   And I can't just go to the link and I'm not gonna do it and then when I get home
[00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:20.580]   I'm gonna be busy, and I'm not gonna have time to sit at the computer
[00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:22.560]   So I don't know whether you like it or not
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:27.960]   but I always like it when a podcaster will actually read the article or read enough of a
[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:32.960]   Selection that I can get the context for whatever it is that they're talking about
[00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:37.040]   So I'm trying to serve an audio audience and then you get into the world of video and YouTube
[00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:43.640]   And there's just so many people doing interesting things and it just makes for an awesome community of people. I felt like I was continually
[00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:47.240]   sticking my hand out and doing my how are yous and who are yous and
[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:55.080]   Feeling like wow what what an interesting person and what an interesting story look look how cool this person is setting out to change
[00:09:55.080 --> 00:10:00.420]   You know this person is changing the world what an awesome story, and I felt like it was that way for the whole week
[00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:02.680]   I went I started on Wednesday
[00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:07.520]   I was there for a total of four days because I went a little early for this camp thing they did and it just it
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:08.520]   Was awesome
[00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:12.540]   By the way if you're listening to this and you're interested in going to the camp in the future
[00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:17.320]   I thought camp would have been really helpful for bloggers, but since I don't really write a lot of it was about writing
[00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:21.240]   I didn't really I didn't really get much out of it from the perspective of writing
[00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:27.200]   I did really enjoy it however as far as having the opportunity to really connect with some people before the conference
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:33.640]   And I'm glad I went for that purpose because I made some really real friends those first couple days when there was only a hundred
[00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:35.240]   or so people around and
[00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:39.840]   Those friendships kind of carried on through the coming days, so I'm really glad I went really enjoyed it and
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:46.280]   if you're a writer if you're a financial writer or a blogger of some kind then go ahead and and
[00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:50.680]   Consider going in the future. I'll probably I don't know maybe I'll go next time. Maybe I won't who knows I
[00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:54.760]   Had an opportunity just to meet so many people that I've read their work
[00:10:54.760 --> 00:11:00.480]   That was one of the most exciting things was just meeting somebody and looking at their name tag and recognizing that I knew their work
[00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:07.160]   And I really loved having the opportunity to tell them just face to face how much I've appreciated their work as a
[00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:13.800]   Podcaster I've only just recently realized the impact of the positive encouragement from an email
[00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:19.200]   I always have assumed people writing blogs and doing podcasts are busy enough without trying to read my email
[00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:21.200]   So I'm usually I in the past
[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:24.520]   I never really reached out to people but now being on the other side of the microphone
[00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:27.560]   It's I've really learned to appreciate it
[00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:33.800]   It means a lot to get an email and to get a note from somebody so I was able to do that in a face-to-face
[00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:37.320]   Perspective I met some people for example
[00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:39.700]   I'm involved with a group called the XY planning network
[00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:42.540]   And I had the opportunity to meet about six or seven of those guys and gals
[00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:45.620]   We're trying to work together to build a new
[00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:50.380]   Model for financial planning which I'll go over at some point in a future show
[00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:56.800]   But it was nice because we've done so much work virtually we've talked to each other virtually and had Google Hangouts and things like that
[00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:58.880]   But it was fun to actually get to meet meet the people
[00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:02.920]   I learned a lot from doing the shows that I did while I was there. I did a live show
[00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:10.880]   Which was they had a podcasting table set up up by the registration and that was where I recorded recorded the live show with the
[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:13.160]   question from the listener
[00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:19.040]   who asked about should I get a CFP designation or some other financial planning designation for my own personal knowledge and
[00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:22.280]   Wow was that tough
[00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:29.600]   That was probably the toughest public event that I have ever done and I'd never been to one of these conferences
[00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:30.520]   I never I don't know
[00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:35.980]   I didn't know what I should expect and I wasn't expecting people to listen to me while I recorded the show
[00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:43.080]   But I underestimated how challenging it would be to speak to a crowded room of people that can hear me
[00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:47.360]   But aren't really listening to me looking back on it next time if I have an opportunity like that
[00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:54.520]   I'm doing doing an interview show. I'm doing a conversation because it was just tough because I did that show by myself and it's weird
[00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:57.040]   There's in podcasting
[00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:01.280]   You know, I'm sitting here at my desk. I've got my computer screen in front of me
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:05.700]   I've got a notebook and a pen and and the calculator over to my side and a coffee cup and that's it
[00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:10.720]   And so when I'm speaking with you, I'm really you know, I don't look much at my notes
[00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:13.480]   I just kind of think about trying to communicate with you and
[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:22.960]   No one can hear me other than the on the recording and so it's easy to really focus on trying to
[00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:27.680]   Do my best effort to communicate the concepts that I'm looking to communicate
[00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:30.040]   in a speech
[00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:31.680]   But speech is very different
[00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:36.080]   So if you're hot if you're giving a speech to a room and a room of people is standing there looking at you
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:41.980]   That is very different and the nice thing about a speech though is everyone is yet generally listening to you
[00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:45.320]   If they're not listening to you shut your speech down and go go on
[00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:51.000]   Which by the way tip for those of you I'm gonna interrupt myself before I make my point
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:57.340]   Tip for those of you who are faced with speaking to people and who are faced with introducing people
[00:13:57.340 --> 00:14:01.560]   One of the things that I think a lot about it in our society
[00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:07.960]   Is how challenging it is to keep people's attention now and there were several instances even at FinCon
[00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:13.000]   Where there was you know a lunch speech or something like that a lunch speech?
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.160]   It was being delivered and the room of people wasn't really listening that closely
[00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:22.120]   First of all, if you're ever introducing somebody I think it is the person who is introducing a speaker
[00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:28.740]   It is our job to get the attention of the room. It's very difficult if you're a speaker to ask for attention
[00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:33.400]   So let's say that in a setting where which is very difficult to speak at it's something like a lunch crowd
[00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:36.520]   Or a breakfast crowd where people are eating and kind of paying attention
[00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:39.960]   We've all been to those events where people are eating they're gathered around their table
[00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:41.560]   They're not really looking at you, but they're kind of listening
[00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:44.480]   But they're sort of kind of talking with their neighbor or something like that
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:50.200]   If you're introducing somebody for a speech like that get the crowds attention and get the crowd quieted down
[00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:54.680]   When you are making the introduction you have the opportunity
[00:14:54.680 --> 00:15:00.640]   To ask for the attention of the audience and it's and it's able you're able to do it in a polite way
[00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:04.180]   But in a demanding way to tell them audience quiet down
[00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:08.240]   It's time for the speeches and you can wrap the glass. You can tap the mic
[00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:13.360]   You can say hey shut up and listen to me. Whatever it is that you want to do. You can get the audience's attention
[00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:18.520]   It's very difficult as a speaker to be able to do that because generally as a speaker
[00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:23.160]   You're launching right into your talk and for you to have to stop and demand
[00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:28.280]   The attention of the crowd is more challenging because it's it's a little demeaning
[00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:32.040]   It's a little hard to demand the attention of the crowd. You want the crowd to want to hear what you're saying
[00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:34.160]   So if you're introducing somebody
[00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:38.480]   Get the attention of the crowd do your job. It's not just about reading the script
[00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:42.580]   It's about taking control and command of the room so that you can
[00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:46.480]   Set up the
[00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:49.600]   Speaker to really have a strong start
[00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:53.520]   so just remember that if you're making the introduction if you're a speaker and
[00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:57.080]   I've been in this situation and I'm kind of reminding myself
[00:15:57.080 --> 00:16:00.600]   Get control of the room
[00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:04.600]   We are still polite enough in our society that you know
[00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:10.120]   If you're standing up front speaking you've been invited to be there get control of the room and a lot of times new public
[00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:11.920]   Speakers are scared to do this
[00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:14.480]   But even if you don't know how to do it in an elegant way
[00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:20.460]   At least just simply ask for the audience's attention and there are more elegant ways to do it
[00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:25.880]   Maybe you can make a study of that if you're if you are I don't want to go into that because it's something I'm interested
[00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:28.720]   In about I mean I made a note to kind of make a study of practicing
[00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:32.840]   what would I do if I'm having a room of people that's not really paying attention to me and
[00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:35.340]   But get control of the room
[00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:40.960]   It's really hard for those of us who are trying to listen to you to hear and we can't do anything in the crowd really
[00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:42.920]   To help you get control
[00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:48.720]   But if you take command of the stage and one simple and easy way to do it if there's a microphone pick it up
[00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:51.840]   most people when you watch them speak
[00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:54.520]   They're scared of the microphone
[00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:59.460]   And if and I used to when I was a kid I used to run an audio board at my school
[00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:02.780]   just kind of for fun mainly because I didn't like sitting in the crowd and
[00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:05.640]   Listening is easier to go run the audio sound system
[00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:11.360]   And people are scared to pick up the microphone and speak into it because they're concerned about being too loud now
[00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:17.620]   When I'm recording a show I need to learn some good mic usage so for example
[00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:22.960]   I usually don't get up here and talk like this because it was just a little bit too much and you can hear every sound
[00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:24.960]   I make I
[00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:27.040]   Usually pull back a little bit like this
[00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:32.120]   but if I sit back like this you can totally hear just the difference in the sound if I do something like this and
[00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:38.840]   The difference between this my normal speaking tone of voice is where I'm talking to you like this and this
[00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:41.120]   Where I'm right here
[00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:45.840]   That's a total difference of about eight inches and how I speak in the microphone and you can hear in your ears
[00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:50.240]   You can hear the difference so little rant here. Just speak into the microphone
[00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:55.600]   Pretend you're kissing it frankly let the audio people cut your audio
[00:17:55.600 --> 00:18:01.600]   But if in several of these situations if you have a room where the people aren't really paying attention to you
[00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:08.220]   At least if you're loud those are the people who are those who are interested in hearing you can
[00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:12.520]   Can hear you they can hear you over the the roar of the crowd?
[00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:15.880]   But if you're sitting back here like this, and there's just a general
[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:21.480]   There's just a general noise in the room, then it's just the worst of both worlds
[00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:26.320]   So don't be scared of the microphone kiss the microphone while you're talking and let the sound people
[00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:33.320]   Adjust your volume and then finally just a tip like get control the room speak into the microphone be loud and have something
[00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:39.280]   Interesting to say is really the big thing make sure that you have something interesting to say that's going to be appropriate for
[00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:43.400]   The crowd know your crowd before you're going in and have something
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   Interesting to say to say
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:52.560]   Sorry that just bothered me in the last one if you're in the crowd try to help the speaker
[00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:57.840]   I mean, I really think it's so tough to be a speaker and so many people are not accustomed to it
[00:18:57.840 --> 00:18:59.840]   We're not accustomed to
[00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:06.320]   How to do these things and you know when you're nervous about giving a speaker it's gonna be about giving a speech
[00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:11.940]   It's so much more challenging to take control of the room help the speaker out try to shush your table if you can be polite
[00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:16.440]   Just bothers me. I know it's just personal pet peeve. So
[00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:19.560]   There's a rant I got off track. Let me get back on track
[00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:24.400]   Hopefully, that'll just be a helpful tip I don't mean it to be a
[00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:28.620]   Hopefully that will help some of you. I've been in that situation. I'm sure I'll be there again
[00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:33.200]   So hopefully that will help some of you back to recording the show. So a speech is
[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:36.420]   Really, even though one person is talking
[00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:41.760]   It's very much two-way communication. So when you're speaking to a crowd you're watching
[00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:43.480]   the
[00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:50.760]   Feedback you're watching how the crowd is engaging and you're adjusting your speech to how the crowd is responding and how the crowd is reacting
[00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:54.720]   So in a speech even though one person's talking it's two ways
[00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:59.080]   And so that's really great because you can see what's working. What's not you can watch the crowd
[00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:04.080]   You can see whether you're having the effect that you want or whether you're not and and you can adjust accordingly
[00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:06.680]   but podcasting
[00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:14.020]   Because instead of me being able to visualize you in my head as listening
[00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:17.820]   I had to see the people in front of me, but instead of listening to
[00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:23.240]   Instead of listening. They're not listening. They're kind of hear you but you're just part of the general noise
[00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:28.960]   so if you hated that show forgive me as far as the live show that was a tough show to record and
[00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:35.320]   I'm gonna do it totally different next time never been in that situation before I almost feel like I owe the
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:41.760]   Listener who asked the question a completely new answer and who knows maybe I'll do it because thinking back on it
[00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:44.280]   I was so struggling to say am I getting my point across?
[00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:47.160]   I was distracted and all over the place even though I had careful notes
[00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:54.320]   It just didn't flow for me like it usually did so I enjoyed that very I mean it was challenging
[00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:56.840]   I enjoyed the challenge, but it was challenging
[00:20:56.840 --> 00:21:01.320]   So if you're a podcaster and you're listening to this that would be or you have the opportunity in the future
[00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:03.640]   Maybe that would be one tip that would be helpful for you
[00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:09.960]   The other show that I recorded that I released was the interview with Steve Stewart from the money plant SOS podcast
[00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:11.960]   and we talked about the Dave Ramsey show and
[00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:17.100]   Or we talked about financial broadcasting with a focus on Dave Ramsey
[00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:23.440]   I'll tell you I was very nervous about releasing that show, but I've received nothing but positive feedback on it
[00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:28.360]   And I thank you for those of you who have both commented on the show and who have sent me private emails
[00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:31.840]   I thank you for the feedback. It has been very encouraging
[00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:38.120]   I was shocked at this conference and I spoke about this with several other people who are involved in the financial media
[00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:40.920]   I was shocked at the level of
[00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:44.840]   Not gonna say animosity
[00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:46.360]   but at the
[00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:48.720]   criticisms leveled towards Dave and
[00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:54.000]   Frankly after the fact I wonder if I wondered if he deserved it because I think Dave's a great guy
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.960]   He's probably a guy that he and I would get along famously if we knew each other
[00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:00.720]   Maybe we'll get the chance someday, but you know
[00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:07.640]   it I was it was like you're walking through the hallways and you constantly heard people being critical of of
[00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:10.720]   Dave and you constantly heard people
[00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:16.280]   Just making comments and making comments and making comments and I have this sense in this
[00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:24.000]   Impression that he has helped and inspired so many financial broadcasters whether that's again podcasters bloggers
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:29.680]   You know financial media. He's inspired so many of us. I mean he inspired me to do the show
[00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:33.960]   I give him full credit for that not necessarily the the steps in the last couple of years
[00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:37.240]   But because of his work in financial media
[00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:41.360]   I got inspired by what I could do and tried to see what I could learn and
[00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:47.600]   But Wow was the criticism through the hallways of people that's always said man. He does a great job
[00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:53.960]   He you know, he's really great at this but some of the personality so I was not expecting that
[00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:58.400]   I was expecting something different and it just it taught me a couple of lessons of a
[00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:01.240]   Be careful when you're on top
[00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:06.760]   Because you're only gonna be on top for a small amount of time and if I'm ever on top
[00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:09.120]   I'm not even sure if I want to be but if I'm ever on top
[00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:16.240]   If you're my friend remind me to be careful because man the weight of responsibility that comes on your shoulders in that situation
[00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:21.520]   And the number of people gunning for you is is is gonna be massive
[00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:26.760]   It also just reminded me that we don't teach people really well how to deal with fame and we don't teach people very well
[00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:31.340]   How to be disliked and to be judged and to be critical
[00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:37.040]   I often remind myself about president presidential candidates and presidents that they are
[00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:40.100]   You know some of the most hated people
[00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:46.520]   By half the country and some of the most loved people maybe by the other half of the country and how fickle the public opinion
[00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:48.080]   is so
[00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:56.280]   I'm you know, I've been nervous to go forward little by little by little and kind of becoming more in the public space
[00:23:56.840 --> 00:24:02.320]   But I've had to recognize to learn and observe and as I said in the Dave Ramsey show
[00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:09.840]   I have a level of respect for Dave that I never had before starting this podcast and it has made me really just
[00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:13.440]   Consider some of my opinions about many other things
[00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:20.880]   many other aspects for example politics things like that just recognizing that what my experience is as a
[00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:27.740]   An onlooker or bystander it's gonna be very different than the experience of somebody who's actually in the race working
[00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:29.800]   and
[00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:36.640]   That's a useful lesson to keep throughout my lifetime and I share that with you as well in case that may be useful for you
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:42.880]   Now I am NOT gonna go out there and be critical of other broadcasters or even be critical of Dave
[00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:48.700]   I'm done. I don't care to be I have no interest in being negative or critical toward anybody
[00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:54.360]   My philosophy is just about all of us are probably doing the best that we can and if there's something that is dangerous
[00:24:54.360 --> 00:25:00.740]   Then I believe that we have a responsibility to point that out and that was why I felt that I could release that show
[00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:06.200]   but I'm done I've said my piece and I don't intend to to revisit it and
[00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:12.120]   Just because there's no need there's no need it's better to it's easier to just simply
[00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:19.120]   Lead with what you want to do rather than criticizing what other people are doing and if we would do more of that
[00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:21.760]   Someone coined the word one time
[00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:30.160]   Duocracy and I love that word that if more of us would just simply start correcting the wrongs that we see
[00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:32.400]   Whatever those wrongs would be
[00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:37.680]   That's what we need more of so less crit less critique of other people and more
[00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:41.800]   Just simply correcting the wrongs that we see I am
[00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:47.120]   Incredibly optimistic about the future of financial media. I never realized I mean I
[00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:51.440]   Had realized this a little bit but just being at FinCon
[00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:53.960]   completely
[00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:55.520]   reinforced this
[00:25:55.520 --> 00:26:01.800]   Opinion that I have I am so optimistic about our ability to learn more in the future
[00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:05.560]   The the key change that's happening and I observed this
[00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:13.960]   A couple, you know, I've observed this in the abstract a few years ago, but it was just really reinforced. Is that the walls are
[00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:18.760]   Obliterated the wall between person and person is obliterated
[00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:24.080]   so whether you look back at the media events whether it's the the the so-called Arab Spring with
[00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:30.360]   you know the connection of Twitter and Facebook and BlackBerry private messaging and just the ability for people to connect if you look at the
[00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:36.760]   ability of stars to connect with their fan base and to get discovered with their YouTube music and to
[00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:42.560]   Meet their fan base on Twitter. If you just look at this the walls are obliterated and in the financial media
[00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:44.560]   This is the best trend of all time
[00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:47.240]   this is awesome because people
[00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:51.360]   you can now access people that are like you and
[00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:57.080]   You can find people that speak to you. You can find people that
[00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:02.200]   That are appropriate to that click with you, you know
[00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:07.660]   So like there are comments there were comments on that Dave Ramsey show about well, you know, I was he's
[00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:12.160]   His heart the hardcore conservative Christian, you know thing didn't work for me
[00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:17.480]   Fine, you know, there's a soft core liberal
[00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:19.800]   atheist
[00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:25.200]   Financial show just waiting somewhere on the internet for you to go listen to and that's what's so cool
[00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:28.040]   is that people can find people who are accessible to them and
[00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:35.320]   One of the things that might is my personal challenges one of my own personal moral challenges is I find it easy
[00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:40.700]   To be jealous of people. I find it easy to be jealous of people who have experienced
[00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:45.300]   More success than I have who seem to be more capable and more gifted than I am
[00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:49.880]   Who seem to have things come more easily to them and even in the financial media space?
[00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:53.120]   it was the toughest thing for me was over the year of
[00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:58.640]   Kind of starting the show and recognizing that I liked it and then having to pull it off the air having to sit back and watch
[00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:02.320]   show after show after show after show get started and
[00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:04.920]   I was
[00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:08.840]   You know, it was tough for me because when I started I'm looking around and saying
[00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:14.520]   Wow, there's you know, there's not much great, you know, there's a couple good ones, but there's not anything really great here
[00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:19.920]   Maybe I could fit this need and then some people that are really admired and really respected fired up their shows and all of a
[00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:22.680]   Sudden I felt like wow, what do I have to contribute?
[00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:24.800]   but
[00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:25.920]   what I
[00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:33.520]   the the different approach that is just reinforced in my mind is just to see how different people will speak to
[00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:37.280]   different hosts of podcasts different writers of
[00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:42.520]   blogs or of books will speak to different people at different points in their journey and
[00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:45.760]   That is the the awesome thing to
[00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:47.800]   To keep in mind
[00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:52.520]   it's so easy at a financial media event to see all of the
[00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:58.000]   Interconnections and and it seems sometimes like like you have the same speakers at the same events
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.040]   It's like if you write a book and if you're known in the online new media space
[00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:05.040]   You're all of a sudden booked for 15 conferences where you're gonna go speak and it's the same thing
[00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:12.120]   Well, that is so it's such a danger also for bloggers and podcasters and things like that that you know
[00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:18.240]   Everyone gloms on to the same person for an interview and you feel like you're in this just this tiny little circle and maybe there's
[00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:21.920]   Somebody who's a celebrity in this tiny little circle. I mean most of you listening to
[00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:28.520]   to my voice it most of many of you will know who Jacob Lundfisker is or many of you will know who
[00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:32.160]   You know, mr. Money mustache is or many of you will know who?
[00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:36.120]   They're the big ones, but you know, JD Roth is things like that
[00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:43.120]   But the reality is is that the circle is so much bigger like these many celebrities within this little tiny niche
[00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:46.040]   It's awesome. I love the work that they're doing all of them
[00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:50.000]   I admire all of them, but the circle needs to be so much wider and
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:56.360]   And the key thing is is that as different people from different backgrounds start the different shows
[00:29:56.360 --> 00:30:02.200]   They appeal to people at different stages of their journey, and I keep reminding myself, you know, frankly
[00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:03.920]   The reason why I'm doing the show right now
[00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:06.720]   I'm excited about it and the feedback has been awesome
[00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:11.640]   But I don't really expect it to be all that much of anything for at least a couple years
[00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:16.920]   Simply because of two things number one is I have to learn the skills that I've never before acquired
[00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:19.800]   To be really excellent at this and that takes time
[00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:24.580]   Hopefully I'm getting better those of you who have been around since the beginning or who've gone back and listened to shows
[00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:30.460]   I think I'm getting better, but I still view myself as giving it, you know, my goal in my mind
[00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:33.840]   I'm giving it a couple years and I've talked about the thousand shows, but I don't really expect to be good
[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:35.840]   Until I don't show 500
[00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:42.320]   And so I just view this as putting in my time practicing focusing learning reading
[00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:46.500]   You know going back and I listen to my shows and I think Joshua. Why did you say that?
[00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:51.080]   How did you not tighten that up? Why did you repeat yourself? Why did you stumble there? Why didn't you think?
[00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:55.320]   Before you talked why did you stick your foot in your mouth that kind of thing?
[00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:58.740]   And so I just view this as partly just as preparation now
[00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:03.620]   I'm so honored that there are so many of you who are along on the journey with me and that is exciting
[00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:08.380]   but in many ways this is I view what I'm doing now as simply
[00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:12.640]   preparation for what I hope is the is the prime time in the future and
[00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:20.520]   You know what today that's what today is actually national podcast day today or yesterday or national podcasting day
[00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:24.680]   Somebody made up this holiday and you know, congratulations, whatever happy podcasting day
[00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:29.200]   But the reality is is that still almost nobody knows what a podcast is and almost nobody
[00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:31.720]   Can knows how to access one
[00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:36.960]   But that's gonna change and to me that is the key thing is that you know
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:43.120]   If you're a financial podcaster pay attention to the fact that the tiny little market of people who are listening to podcasts is valuable
[00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:48.680]   but the most valuable is to reach the general public who's not currently being reached and
[00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:55.160]   That week that's the that's the the audience that we can impact and think of how we can encourage
[00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:58.880]   Those people and educate the people who aren't listening today
[00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:04.840]   So thank you for being an early adopter and for being here if you're here if you're listening to this voice and if you're involved
[00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:07.920]   In the financial media space. I would just say pay attention to the fact that
[00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:09.760]   that
[00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:14.280]   The the primary audience is going to be the audience that's going to find podcasting over the next five years
[00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:17.600]   That's where the audience is going to be
[00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:24.280]   So if you are feeling like I have felt you're jealous of somebody else's success or or you see someone else
[00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:27.960]   That seems to have an easier time. Don't worry about that. Just simply focus on
[00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:33.760]   Doing your own thing and serving the the people that you are able to serve
[00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:36.600]   I would love it if my show
[00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:40.920]   Appealed to everyone I really would because that would feed my ego
[00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:46.820]   But I've recognized that my show is simply not going to appeal to everyone and there are some shows that I listen
[00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:50.560]   I've listened to recently. I tried to break my not listening to financial podcasting
[00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:52.960]   Rule just to kind of get a lay of the land
[00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:56.920]   There are some shows that I listen to that I would never be interested in listening to
[00:32:57.240 --> 00:33:03.520]   but I've heard from some of the fans of those shows where the hosts just really speak to them and it's accessible and
[00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:06.800]   That really
[00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:10.040]   to me encourages me because all through our
[00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:15.600]   Society all through the world and this is not a US American thing
[00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:19.600]   this is all throughout the world the monopoly and stranglehold of
[00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:26.600]   Corporatism I'm not sure the right word I would say the monopoly and stranglehold of
[00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:28.240]   of
[00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:32.640]   Crony corporatism and that the big the big guns is steadily being broken
[00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:39.120]   Especially as generations grow up people often talk when I talk with generations that are older than me
[00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:46.120]   People often talk about the people that they know and that they that they always admired whether it was the in the US
[00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:50.620]   It was the NBC and the CBS and they the what's the other one ABC
[00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:55.520]   I guess is the third big network that would used to be around and Walter Cronkite
[00:33:55.760 --> 00:34:02.120]   Cronkite and Dan Rather and Peter was the guy that the I don't even know that the Peter
[00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:07.960]   What's his name Jennings? I don't know those big broadcasters that everyone knew every night and
[00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:11.400]   You know, I don't even have any clearly
[00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:17.800]   Clearly I don't have any concept of those people don't pay any attention now part of that is due to my
[00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:21.120]   intentional isolation and insulation from TV
[00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:28.360]   But still the the big media outlets are quickly losing losing ground as as the independent small people
[00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:36.520]   Gain ground. So this is just the best. This is the best trend in the world for freedom brings with it a whole host of problems
[00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:43.120]   But there is room for people who don't know a thing to just simply jump in and learn
[00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:47.560]   Again that's hard for me to take because I have this old-fashioned idea
[00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:50.600]   I got to go out and I got to become the expert and I'm gonna go and I'm gonna learn
[00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:54.760]   Boo boo boo boo boo and I'm gonna learn everything and then I'm gonna start and I think that is valuable
[00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:59.240]   I mean, obviously that's what I've done. So, of course, I think it's valuable, but I think that's valuable
[00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:04.600]   But I'm just shocked by how there's room for people who don't know a thing to just start and that's why I think
[00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:08.320]   Frankly, all of us should have a financial blog. I should have a financial blog
[00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:12.320]   Just to track what we're learning and share our lessons and we can help
[00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:17.520]   We can help one another and the best way to learn is to teach and now you're gonna get some stuff wrong
[00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:21.560]   And that's where there's a whole host of problems with a lot of people who aren't real experts
[00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:28.480]   In sharing things, but then there's some of us who like to think we may have learned some hard lessons
[00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:30.480]   Who might want to step in and help?
[00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:33.680]   so it's
[00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:41.360]   There's a bright day in the future. The future is incredibly incredibly bright one trend that I noticed in the
[00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:43.680]   FinCon however
[00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:49.640]   And I spent some time talking with a couple people who were at the conference it is getting tougher and tougher
[00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:57.000]   however for an individual to really on their own to kind of this this individualized approach to
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.480]   blogging financial blogging
[00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:01.160]   podcasting even
[00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:04.760]   I'm stretched to capacity. I'll talk in a few minutes at the end
[00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:09.720]   about just you know, what's going on with my show and kind of what I'm working on, but
[00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:14.400]   it's tough to do it as an individual because what's happening is that the
[00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:17.120]   quote-unquote new media is
[00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:20.200]   being transformed and
[00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:23.880]   People are learning the benefits of collaboration
[00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:30.600]   Taking the team approach to really growing things more than as individuals. So there are some massive changes
[00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:33.000]   going on
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   Going on even in our industry
[00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:41.040]   Great some great speakers. I went to a few of the keynotes and a couple of the small
[00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:48.360]   Smaller breakout sessions and as usual all this into the sessions later when they release the recordings and
[00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:50.080]   Just was inspired again
[00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:56.720]   You know I went to go and see my friend money mustache his talk and I was struck again of how you got to just
[00:36:56.720 --> 00:37:02.280]   Do your own thing and ignore the competition ignore what other people are doing and do your own thing. This is hard for me
[00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:06.600]   Because you know, I mean it's easy for me to go and scope out what other people are doing
[00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:12.480]   But if I say to see that someone is quote-unquote, you know stolen the topic that I had planned it makes me frustrated
[00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:18.760]   So I'm actually done with I'm going on the back under my rock and I'm just gonna work focus on my knitting and try to
[00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:23.200]   Serve all of you and in the interest of serving you I'm done talking about FinCon
[00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:26.160]   Hopefully there were some interesting lessons that was there
[00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:27.540]   I don't again
[00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:30.160]   I'm only sharing because I want you to have value from
[00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:33.560]   Some of what I'm learning because I feel like we're friends and so from time to time
[00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:36.280]   I'll do one of these shows where you're sharing what I'm learning
[00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:45.520]   MSFS the MSFS I went to was was awesome the MSFS if this is your first time is it stands for master
[00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:51.320]   Masters of science and financial services basically it's a master's degree in financial planning and it's hosted by the American College
[00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:54.080]   which is a small college primarily with
[00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:56.320]   distance learning
[00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:58.960]   opportunities that is exclusively focused on
[00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:00.960]   financial services education
[00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:06.440]   they host a number of advanced designations and and they have their master's degree program and I
[00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:11.840]   Was interested in doing it a I was halfway there with a bunch of the classes I'd taken for other designations
[00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:17.400]   B I just I've always thought it would be cool to go and teach college as as my retirement plan
[00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:18.440]   Well, even when I was a kid
[00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:24.880]   I always learned that I really enjoyed teaching and I viewed kind of the perfect life as being a college professor
[00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:27.840]   You know you teach what three four or five classes a week
[00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:32.880]   you know depending and you got to prep for those and you get to research stuff that you that you like to research and you
[00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:39.640]   Get to write about stuff that you're interested in and you have this awesome schedule with semesters and summers off and the pay is okay
[00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:42.700]   thus the PhD glut and the
[00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:46.560]   Underemployment in the in the college world because of that now
[00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:52.000]   I think those trends are changing and I'm gonna talk about them more in depth as far as some of the trends I see
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:53.320]   but
[00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:56.080]   But I always thought that was because I always think well at least do a master's degree
[00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:58.880]   And so just became it was easy for me. I wanted to get it done
[00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:04.600]   I learned so much from doing the program and I learned so much from this residency and
[00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:09.160]   This residency we had two classes. We spent the first two days talking about
[00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:12.920]   advanced retirement strategies and this was
[00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:18.240]   Pretty hardcore pretty in-depth, you know real technical financial stuff. It was we talked about
[00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:21.440]   Distribution strategies we talked about
[00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:28.960]   Social-security strategies pretty pretty hardcore pretty in-depth things and then the second two days was ethics and I was
[00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:34.880]   Shocked by how fun the ethics class was I expected ethics to be boring if you're in the financial services business
[00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:37.920]   You know what a compliance meeting is. I expected it to be a two-day
[00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:46.360]   Compliance meeting basically where everyone is just done, you know after about 30 minutes, but it wasn't it was an awesome awesome class
[00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:52.400]   The best thing about it. However was the group in the academic terms
[00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:57.120]   They would call it the cohort and there were 15 other advisors there in addition to me
[00:39:57.120 --> 00:39:59.880]   I think there were a total of 16 of us in the class and
[00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:03.520]   It was some it was one of the most knowledgeable
[00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:08.120]   experienced group of financial advisors that I've ever had the the
[00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:14.560]   Privilege of being in a room with and we ranged from the oldest among us and with the most experience
[00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:22.440]   Was a gentleman from New York who was he said he was 75 years old and he had been working in financial services for
[00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:23.640]   45 years
[00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:28.640]   There were a number of people there with 35 years of experience 30 years of experience
[00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:35.720]   many with 15 years of experience and then there was all the way down to one young man who had
[00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:39.320]   was two years out of college he had an undergraduate degree in
[00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:43.000]   financial planning and he was two years out of college and
[00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:50.000]   Was just finishing his master's degree and I was just so reminded that how different
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:53.760]   Adult learning is with X with people who were
[00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:59.520]   Experienced and knowledgeable and who want to be there versus some of the experiences in child
[00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:07.080]   education and child learning the adult learning was awesome and most of I wish actually for more of this in my life because most of my
[00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:14.000]   Education has been self self educated, you know, I've done I'm I'm I do better on just studying
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:15.680]   stuff on my own and
[00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:19.680]   You know all the classes I did just self study. I get the book. I read the book, you know
[00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:22.800]   I get the get the book read the book and take the test. That's it
[00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:26.240]   that's the formula and that that comes easily to me, but
[00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:34.640]   the I was so benefited from the conversation and from the discussions and it really wound up being such a
[00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:36.480]   cool
[00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:42.080]   juxtaposition or I guess as they would say as we would say today a smash-up such a cool smash-up of
[00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:50.240]   Of these two worlds of the first week being in the personal finance world of super enthusiastic
[00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:56.140]   Personal finance bloggers talking about personal finance bloggers and podcasters
[00:41:56.140 --> 00:42:01.000]   Some of whom have had some experience in the financial with a formal quote-unquote financial world
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:07.040]   but many of whom have not and then to one day later be there with a group of
[00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:16.440]   Incredibly seasoned advisors and just to see how similar our conversation was in many ways, but then how different our
[00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:19.640]   Conversation was I learned so much and
[00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:24.040]   We talked a lot about trends. What's it's interesting to me
[00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:28.200]   there are a lot of people in the financial blogging space who are very critical of
[00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:33.000]   Financial services and in many cases rightly so I'm very critical of
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:36.640]   the financial services industry in many ways and
[00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:42.000]   Rightly, so and what was interesting to me, however that all 16 of us
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:48.200]   Were very critical of the financial services industry
[00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:52.000]   So I'm sitting here saying we're on earth though
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:56.240]   I go find the people who are not critical or the people who were being critical of
[00:42:56.240 --> 00:43:01.560]   but I learned two important lessons is I learned lesson number one was
[00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:06.080]   the lesson of experience and qualifications I
[00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:12.240]   Am increasingly it's gonna sound a little bit silly since I've spent so much time studying
[00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:16.880]   I am increasingly convinced of the necessity of
[00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:23.320]   advanced financial planning knowledge and advanced financial planning designations in an
[00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:26.040]   advisor in your advisor
[00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:30.760]   All of us were from different companies there were only yet
[00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:35.800]   There wasn't one person actually who was from the same company of the 16 attend classmates of mine
[00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:41.200]   Or rather in the 15 classmates plus me the 16 of us we were all from different firms
[00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:46.240]   But all of us had advanced knowledge all I mean
[00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:53.840]   Everyone had at least two or three designations, you know CFP a CLU a CHFC. What you know, we see ma
[00:43:53.840 --> 00:44:00.600]   we all had at least a couple designations and the caliber of advisor that it takes to be
[00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:03.760]   You know to study is very different
[00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:08.360]   It was interesting because all of us no matter the firm and many of us came from
[00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:12.400]   respected firms and some of us came from firms that frankly
[00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:17.440]   I've not had a high opinion of just because some of the reps that I've met and we all shared the same
[00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:21.360]   woes we the same criticism of
[00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:24.160]   young advisors who
[00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:26.360]   who are
[00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:33.440]   I'm not sure how to express it advisors who don't care enough about their job to actually learn something
[00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:37.120]   but rather it's just about how much money can I make in a short period of time and
[00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:43.160]   There are some major challenges in the business because we don't know how like how do you get those people out?
[00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:48.280]   Well, well, the good thing is is that the market forces I believe are forcing them out
[00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:54.360]   I think we're gonna see some major changes in the professional world of financial advice and I think very soon
[00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:59.200]   Just because of the competition the best thing that's happened
[00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:04.080]   and this is actually my second point on what I wanted to share with you about a the
[00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:10.040]   common the common complaint of advisors, but be that the market forces that are going on in
[00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:12.720]   the industry
[00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:16.920]   the best thing that has happened to this industry my industry is
[00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:21.600]   the intense market competition and if you don't think
[00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:28.080]   market economics matters just look at the financial advice industry and if you look at the
[00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:30.880]   development of
[00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:33.440]   the financial markets in the financial industry
[00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:41.000]   The development of at first not really a very fragmented market, you know, very fragmented markets you were all everything was private investment the
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:43.480]   beautiful
[00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:47.600]   pastoral scene of Wall Street originally where traders came to to
[00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:50.080]   buy and sell shares of their company
[00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:53.520]   Under the tree that was there at the square or whatever
[00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:56.160]   There's a famous painting that if you pay any attention to financial history
[00:45:56.160 --> 00:46:03.920]   You see the development of the markets kind of the mania of the markets the stock brokerage business the stock brokerage business being decimated
[00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:05.800]   by
[00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:07.640]   the fund industry
[00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:14.960]   And then the stock brokerage business being decimated by technology online trading very few people these days have a stock broker
[00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:17.000]   Nobody even remembers that world
[00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:23.480]   then now you've seen the fund industry utterly decimated by indexing and
[00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:29.920]   In the last five years Vanguard has gone from this tiny not tiny they were
[00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:35.520]   Not tiny, excuse me. They were like the number two or number three, you know largest firm, but a
[00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:42.280]   family of mutual funds like American funds was number one and they were on the hill for a long time and then
[00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:45.920]   completely decimated in the last few years and
[00:46:46.520 --> 00:46:53.160]   I mean Vanguard is this is this is this behemoth it is massive and it is hard to find
[00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:59.080]   It's hard to find any financial literature that doesn't just simply assume indexing is a fact
[00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:05.600]   And it's so interesting because that has that so so that's destroyed fund expenses. You've seen a dramatic
[00:47:05.600 --> 00:47:12.600]   decrease if you study industry statistics of sales commission sales load internal expenses on funds just
[00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:20.000]   Dramatic dramatic decrease and that pressure is only continuing to intensify and so that's bringing down expenses and the margins
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:23.680]   Have become slimmer and slimmer and slimmer for advisors
[00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:29.800]   We talked a lot about this with some of the advisors that the pressure the intense pressure that is there on the margins
[00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:34.920]   For the average advisor is is it's intense. The pressure is intense
[00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:42.040]   It's it's it's a strong strong pressure and this is great for the consumer because it's driving costs down
[00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:48.440]   Now the interesting thing however is while all of us agreed that I and so I'll just give you my opinion
[00:47:48.440 --> 00:47:56.280]   There has never been a time in the history of the world where I can imagine it being more difficult for an individual to
[00:47:56.280 --> 00:48:00.760]   navigate through the swampy waters filled with
[00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:06.540]   Alligators that is the financial business that is the choice the financial choices
[00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:12.320]   You know the tax code is more complex than it's ever been the investment options are more complex than they've ever been
[00:48:12.320 --> 00:48:15.720]   the insurance choices are more complex than they've ever been and
[00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:24.160]   The decisions are more complex than they've ever been now. These can be dramatically simplified. They really can be I admire and want to
[00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:27.400]   venerate the people who talk about
[00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:31.000]   the simplest approaches to finance and
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:33.440]   I
[00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:35.960]   Am I'm a what's the word?
[00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:38.320]   Minimalist
[00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:44.200]   I'm a fan of simplicity and minimalism and I believe simplicity is is is key
[00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:49.120]   But the problem is is that the world that we live in generally there's this there's this difference between
[00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:56.080]   Simplicity is how it's expressed in a short article and the actual ability to be simple
[00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:59.800]   I mean sit down and read your homeowner's insurance contract. Have any of you ever done that?
[00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:03.840]   That document is not simple and yet that's one of the most straightforward
[00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:10.480]   Simple types of insurance documents you can get sit down and read your your car insurance contract. We don't even get those
[00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:13.600]   Sit down and read we don't you know, think of what that's like
[00:49:13.600 --> 00:49:19.880]   So there are more room for mistakes than there has ever been and there are more options available than has ever been
[00:49:19.880 --> 00:49:25.400]   so the interesting thing however is I see this incredible change is that the the
[00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:29.480]   incredible pressure on mediocre financial advisors is
[00:49:30.440 --> 00:49:34.640]   Driving margins down and is driving people out of the business and I think that is wonderful
[00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:41.040]   Get the the scumbags out of the business now if you are a well-meaning person and you are willing to be
[00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:46.680]   Intellectually honest and you're willing to be a person of integrity then that's fine. Stay in the business and learn
[00:49:46.680 --> 00:49:49.240]   but the
[00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:53.280]   price of good advice is the demand for good advice is
[00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:58.760]   Is going up it's going through the roof, you know, I thought frankly
[00:49:58.760 --> 00:50:01.960]   I thought that some of the ideas and the price levels that I think
[00:50:01.960 --> 00:50:07.160]   Financial planning should be should be billed at we're kind of high and I get a little bit nervous about how
[00:50:07.160 --> 00:50:13.520]   strongly I feel about good financial planning advice, but when I listen to some of the fees that that
[00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:16.760]   We talked about some of the fees that some of my classmates
[00:50:16.760 --> 00:50:23.840]   Charge, it was just it was amazing to me to just to think and I even had trouble just conceiving of myself ever
[00:50:24.920 --> 00:50:28.840]   Charging that much money for a plan and and just feeling like I was worth that much
[00:50:28.840 --> 00:50:34.680]   But once you see the value that you can make I mean, it's it's amazing. So it's a very interesting world
[00:50:34.680 --> 00:50:39.560]   I'm thrilled with I'm thrilled with the developments. I'm thrilled with the competition. I'm thrilled with the
[00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:42.400]   transparency, I'm thrilled with the
[00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:50.680]   I'm thrilled with it. It's it's I mean, I believe in market economies. I hate saying I shouldn't have said that
[00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:53.320]   I don't like it when people say I believe in something
[00:50:53.320 --> 00:50:58.880]   I think that the market economy is the great equalizer and I like that
[00:50:58.880 --> 00:51:04.800]   You see that happening right now in the financial planning business. I think it's an excellent excellent development and
[00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:12.680]   I see so many people really honing in on the great value that financial planners can provide and
[00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:15.640]   really learning how to
[00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:21.440]   Articulate that in a better way and I'm glad because there have been a lot of lies told by some people in the financial services
[00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:26.920]   businesses over the last few decades and yet that doesn't mean that everyone involved in financial services is a liar and a crook
[00:51:26.920 --> 00:51:31.840]   It just means that there are a lot of liars and crooks and there's a lot of people who are not.
[00:51:31.840 --> 00:51:34.760]   I have a
[00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:41.200]   Newfound respect for the importance of advanced planning knowledge and advanced planning designations. Frankly
[00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:44.240]   I think I think my friend Michael Kitsis has it right in his writing
[00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:48.320]   I don't think that he is the one who pioneered this idea
[00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:53.120]   but he's probably one of the more well-known people within the financial services industry and
[00:51:53.120 --> 00:52:00.080]   very quickly the you know a certified financial planner designation is very quickly going to be a minimum standard and
[00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:04.280]   If your financial advisor does is not a CFP certificate
[00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:09.120]   You should be asking him why not if they don't have any letters behind their name
[00:52:09.120 --> 00:52:13.840]   You should be asking them why not and what they're studying for and the reason may be very simple
[00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:21.280]   For example, the CFP board will not let you will not allow you to use your designation until you've had three years of industry experience
[00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:27.360]   So the young man who is in the class who has an undergraduate degree in financial planning has passed the CFP exam
[00:52:27.360 --> 00:52:29.920]   But can't use the designation that would be the reason why not
[00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:35.120]   But and it takes time to do all this stuff. It really does but if
[00:52:35.120 --> 00:52:41.160]   If your advisor doesn't isn't knowledgeable, I think you ought to be asking him why not
[00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:48.440]   And you ought to not saying fire him. I believe strongly there are some advisors who are incredibly knowledgeable
[00:52:48.440 --> 00:52:53.520]   Incredibly knowledgeable who have never you know, who never
[00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:57.840]   Never bothered just to go out and sit for an exam
[00:52:57.840 --> 00:53:05.800]   But I would encourage you as a consumer of financial advice pressure your providers because I do not want
[00:53:05.800 --> 00:53:09.460]   I'm a bit of a libertarian as you probably figured out by now
[00:53:10.240 --> 00:53:12.800]   I am I do not want to
[00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:23.200]   Have it forced that the government has to come in and and bring in more regulation because that is just is a disaster the market
[00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:24.560]   forces work
[00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:31.280]   We don't need more regulations the most over regulated business in the world and it doesn't the regulation doesn't do anything to reduce
[00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:33.960]   to reduce cheating
[00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:38.360]   It doesn't do anything. It just smart people just work their way around laws
[00:53:38.360 --> 00:53:42.480]   But when the market forces come to bear that makes a difference really does
[00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:47.520]   It was interesting because I thought I was I thought I was done with studying
[00:53:47.520 --> 00:53:51.220]   I've said or I'm like, I don't want to read these boring financial planning books anymore
[00:53:51.220 --> 00:53:56.440]   but I got to talking with the the staff and the team at American College about their PhD program and and
[00:53:56.440 --> 00:53:58.480]   It's very interesting
[00:53:58.480 --> 00:54:04.600]   One of these days I may start working on that who knows I realized that I actually am very interested in the theoretical side of financial
[00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:09.200]   Planning and some of the work that some of the research side and that's the primary reason to get a PhD
[00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:11.600]   I think is is if you're interested in the research side
[00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:17.680]   but there is such some awesome research going on right now to really advance the science of financial planning and
[00:54:17.680 --> 00:54:22.320]   So who knows maybe one of these days I'll I'll start studying again
[00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:28.440]   I I don't know but it was interesting just to kind of look through and recognize how much I enjoy studying some of the
[00:54:28.440 --> 00:54:31.800]   Some of the content who knows we can get this show going
[00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:34.440]   Maybe I'll have the time to if we can get the show making me any money
[00:54:34.440 --> 00:54:37.580]   Maybe I'll have the time to do that a couple quick things on the show
[00:54:37.580 --> 00:54:42.680]   And I'm gonna tell you how I did this two-week road trip for 600 bucks. I think you'll you'll find this a
[00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:44.960]   little bit
[00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:52.900]   Interesting. I was a little bit. I wasn't sure about about sharing it, but I decided you know what my podcast audience of my friends
[00:54:52.900 --> 00:54:54.900]   I'm gonna share it with you guys
[00:54:56.720 --> 00:55:02.400]   The fascinating thing about going to these two things was just simply the old max and that exposure creates opportunity I
[00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:10.280]   Had wound up with actually three distinct and different business opportunities that came out of simply this trip
[00:55:10.280 --> 00:55:15.760]   None of them expected all of them that could be awesome businesses can't do all three of them
[00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:21.260]   But it was just reminded me exposure creates opportunity if you're if you're not getting involved in your industry
[00:55:21.440 --> 00:55:27.680]   Just consider it because it's a lot better to have opportunities fall in your lap when you're not looking for them than to be out
[00:55:27.680 --> 00:55:30.520]   You know sending resumes off into the dead end
[00:55:30.520 --> 00:55:34.680]   You know into the trash bin that is the the address that you send those resumes off to
[00:55:34.680 --> 00:55:38.140]   As far as the show shows going well, I just reminded while I was
[00:55:38.140 --> 00:55:45.040]   While I was at FinCon that I've got to figure out an upgrade a little bit and figure out some of what I'm doing
[00:55:45.840 --> 00:55:51.640]   With the show and how to build it as far as build some of the you know to earn a little bit of money
[00:55:51.640 --> 00:55:54.400]   Off the show frankly. I don't know how I'm gonna do that and
[00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:56.840]   I've not been
[00:55:56.840 --> 00:55:58.160]   I've not kept it a secret
[00:55:58.160 --> 00:56:01.800]   I'd like to earn a living from doing this show because I really enjoy doing it
[00:56:01.800 --> 00:56:07.040]   If I weren't able to if I'm not able to earn a living from the show it would have to I would have to reduce
[00:56:07.040 --> 00:56:09.200]   The amount of time that I put into preparing for it
[00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:14.680]   and I don't want to do that because I've received such an amazing feedback from you the audience and and
[00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:17.000]   just the emails and the
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:18.960]   comments about how much some of the
[00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:25.280]   Content has helped and I thank each and every one of you for those comments and those emails that really makes a huge difference
[00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:27.960]   So there are a few different models
[00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:30.080]   And I'm not sure exactly what I'm gonna do
[00:56:30.080 --> 00:56:34.680]   The as far as how to earn a little bit of revenue on the show at this point in time
[00:56:34.680 --> 00:56:38.560]   Let's see for September we wound up with about sixty four thousand downloads
[00:56:39.040 --> 00:56:45.880]   For the month of September total and wound up being I guess about we're up to about 2,500 downloads a day, which is pretty exciting
[00:56:45.880 --> 00:56:47.960]   That's awesome for the third month of the show
[00:56:47.960 --> 00:56:52.260]   That's really thrilling to know that there's a couple thousand of you guys listening to me
[00:56:52.260 --> 00:56:54.880]   And I'm hearing from many of you and I thank you for being there
[00:56:54.880 --> 00:56:59.640]   Thank you for those of you who are mentioning the show to other people. I really appreciate that
[00:56:59.640 --> 00:57:05.640]   That has been awesome. My issues with some of the compensation models. I just don't like some of them
[00:57:06.120 --> 00:57:08.120]   For example, I could accept advertising
[00:57:08.120 --> 00:57:14.440]   But the problem is that I view advertising as a personal endorsement and it's so difficult to me
[00:57:14.440 --> 00:57:17.600]   I'm so skeptical and frankly suspicious of I
[00:57:17.600 --> 00:57:25.720]   Guess I'm a hard sell in a lot of the companies that are commonly advertising in the financial world
[00:57:25.720 --> 00:57:32.560]   And I know enough about the details of the financial world to be careful. There are some companies I guess that could advertise
[00:57:33.600 --> 00:57:37.400]   That I could go and and I could feel really good about advertising
[00:57:37.400 --> 00:57:40.200]   Accepting them as an advertiser for the show
[00:57:40.200 --> 00:57:47.240]   But then I think well am I watering down the content? Do I really want to feel like I'm working for someone?
[00:57:47.240 --> 00:57:49.400]   I want to be free to be able to
[00:57:49.400 --> 00:57:52.160]   express my opinion without fear of
[00:57:52.160 --> 00:57:57.880]   Controlling it once you've gotten free of having to worry about the corporate image
[00:57:57.880 --> 00:58:02.000]   I mean, it's it's hard to for me to consider going back. I do shows with tax cheats
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:06.520]   I mean, how awesome is that? I sit here and I talk with people who you know, and I mean
[00:58:06.520 --> 00:58:12.600]   I specifically use the pejorative word tax cheat, you know to illustrate it's like how looked down are you?
[00:58:12.600 --> 00:58:15.360]   Oh, we don't pay my taxes. I think that's that's fascinating
[00:58:15.360 --> 00:58:22.160]   I do all these radical crazy nuts shows and if I had to worry about a certain advertiser being a you know
[00:58:22.160 --> 00:58:25.240]   Worried that I'm gonna do a show on dumpster diving
[00:58:25.240 --> 00:58:31.240]   You know, I like talking about that stuff. So it's hard for me to figure out who would be willing to
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:34.680]   Sully their their corporate image
[00:58:34.680 --> 00:58:38.960]   Show
[00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:46.440]   The more common, you know way to make money off of a show like this would be
[00:58:46.440 --> 00:58:49.720]   What are they called referral fees and or?
[00:58:49.720 --> 00:58:57.160]   Affiliates affiliate commissions, but half of the affiliates that are commonly bandied about I got issues with half of them
[00:58:57.160 --> 00:59:00.720]   Do so I really don't do myself any favors
[00:59:00.720 --> 00:59:02.360]   in
[00:59:02.360 --> 00:59:07.000]   Ticking off everyone who listens to the show. All right, not taking everyone who listens to show
[00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:11.940]   I don't do myself any favors by being as suspicious as I am of different companies
[00:59:11.940 --> 00:59:13.940]   So we'll figure it out as time goes on. I got a few ideas
[00:59:13.940 --> 00:59:18.520]   Pursuing a couple of options. I could just simply go with a listener support model
[00:59:18.520 --> 00:59:20.280]   but then I
[00:59:20.280 --> 00:59:24.280]   Can't stand it when NPR does their their like begging drives
[00:59:24.280 --> 00:59:29.580]   And so I could set up a model where if you enjoy the show you kick in a couple bucks a month something like that
[00:59:29.580 --> 00:59:35.760]   but I I just despise it when they go and beg for money on NPR and
[00:59:35.760 --> 00:59:39.080]   so that makes so I basically
[00:59:39.080 --> 00:59:46.840]   Sit here and I think huh? What am I gonna do? I'm not exactly sure so we'll figure that it was out as time goes on
[00:59:46.840 --> 00:59:50.440]   All right wrap up here and I am going to share with you
[00:59:50.440 --> 00:59:53.160]   the weird
[00:59:53.160 --> 00:59:57.440]   Experiment that I did on this on this trip and share with you how I did this this trip for so cheap
[00:59:57.440 --> 01:00:02.480]   I was a little bit slow to talk about it because even just still dealing with the social stigma
[01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:05.640]   But I decided it would be fun to do an experiment. I'll give you the backstory. I
[01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:11.960]   was when I wanted to go to I can't stand going to conferences and staying at the hotels because I just
[01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:17.840]   I've gone to so many of these conferences and you wind up spending a thousand bucks on hotel fees for the weekend and
[01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:26.160]   You know, you're there for three days and they completely just you know, they take advantage of the fact that there's a big conference
[01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:32.420]   I used to go to the Northwestern mutual annual meeting every year in Milwaukee and every hotel in the city is sold out and it's
[01:00:32.420 --> 01:00:36.800]   Like 300 bucks a night 200 200 300 bucks a night for a not very nice room
[01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:40.880]   And I just that bothers me so I never could quite figure it out one year
[01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:46.300]   I tried to find an Airbnb place to stay to avoid the hotel fees and that
[01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:50.400]   That didn't work out because I couldn't find an Airbnb place who would take me
[01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:53.540]   Couldn't figure out why I made my profile wasn't complete enough
[01:00:53.540 --> 01:00:56.500]   But like and also not having a car is problematic
[01:00:56.500 --> 01:00:59.720]   And so I mean the really the easiest thing to do is to stay at
[01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:03.000]   Stay at the hotel at the conferences at and so
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:07.400]   But this one when I originally planned to take my family with me, I thought it would be fun
[01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:09.860]   We would do a camping trip. I like to I like to go car camping
[01:01:09.860 --> 01:01:12.840]   And so I thought it'd be fun. I would camp out there
[01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:17.400]   I looked and I found a really beautiful park near the college in Philadelphia
[01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:22.320]   I figured we'd be there for a couple extra days and then I found a really beautiful park in Louisiana
[01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:26.640]   So that was my original plan. Well, then when I found out my scheduling kerfuffle
[01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:31.260]   Then I realized well, that's not gonna work. I can't my family
[01:01:31.260 --> 01:01:34.960]   I can't take stick my one-year-old son in the car and expect him to be able to get from
[01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:38.940]   New Orleans to Philadelphia in one day and force my you know
[01:01:38.940 --> 01:01:42.960]   My wife and son to do a 16 or 17 hour drive in about 30 hours, basically
[01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:48.140]   Because I had Friday night to Monday morning. So I decided that wasn't fair
[01:01:48.140 --> 01:01:49.100]   So I decided to go alone
[01:01:49.100 --> 01:01:53.740]   Which I didn't want to do because one of the goals of my life is I would like to have my family
[01:01:53.740 --> 01:01:58.620]   Integrated in everything I'm doing so I'd like to take my kids with me to a conference and and I want to teach them
[01:01:58.620 --> 01:02:01.700]   how to I want to teach them how to
[01:02:01.700 --> 01:02:07.140]   Interact in the business world and interact with other people and how to learn and how to be exposed to different things
[01:02:07.140 --> 01:02:12.340]   I would much rather my 10 year old learn his social skills by being at a FinCon with me
[01:02:12.340 --> 01:02:16.880]   Than that he learn it from a you know, a bunch of other 10 year old monkeys in a classroom
[01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:22.460]   That's where you know people talk about socialization of kids. That's that's how you teach social skills in my opinion
[01:02:22.460 --> 01:02:29.120]   the 10 year old in the classroom are guaranteed to doom your you know, your kid to a lifetime of you know being a kid but
[01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:33.180]   If you and he takes him 10 or 15 years to recover
[01:02:33.380 --> 01:02:39.460]   Maybe from that out of you know, when he finally hits the adult world and really learns how to be an adult
[01:02:39.460 --> 01:02:43.820]   I guess I don't need to be so inflammatory, but I do feel strongly about that
[01:02:43.820 --> 01:02:47.100]   So I want my family to be engaged with me and to be involved with me
[01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:50.300]   So I was disappointed when I recognized that it wasn't fair to to do that
[01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:53.780]   So I went ahead and I was gonna book a room for the for the hotel
[01:02:53.780 --> 01:02:58.580]   But by then I was gonna book a room and I was like, I don't want to pay this money
[01:02:59.140 --> 01:03:02.060]   For this for this thing. So I decided I had such a good experience
[01:03:02.060 --> 01:03:06.860]   Staying in the Prius when I was on the where it was, Texas when I went to Texas
[01:03:06.860 --> 01:03:07.140]   I
[01:03:07.140 --> 01:03:10.980]   camped in the Prius on the way there then stayed with a friend and then camped in the Prius on the way back and I'd
[01:03:10.980 --> 01:03:15.180]   Read about that online and I thought I thought it was such a cool idea
[01:03:15.180 --> 01:03:16.540]   I tried it out. It worked awesome
[01:03:16.540 --> 01:03:21.260]   And if you didn't hear that show the idea is basically that in the Prius you can put the seats flat
[01:03:21.260 --> 01:03:27.300]   So you put the passenger seat all the way back and then you flip the back seat forward and you've got basically a flat
[01:03:27.740 --> 01:03:29.940]   space that you can lie down in and
[01:03:29.940 --> 01:03:34.540]   You put your head at the back of the car and your feet at the front and it's not quite flat where your feet are
[01:03:34.540 --> 01:03:39.060]   but it's good enough and you put a little pad down like a thermo rest something like that and
[01:03:39.060 --> 01:03:42.040]   You put the pad down and it would
[01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:44.940]   And then you have a fairly comfortable
[01:03:44.940 --> 01:03:48.800]   Situation and because the Prius is a hybrid you can leave the AC on all night
[01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:52.940]   And it'll run the AC for you. You can leave the car on with the AC on all night
[01:03:52.940 --> 01:03:54.620]   It'll run mainly off the battery
[01:03:54.620 --> 01:03:59.380]   But every 15 minutes 20 minutes something like that kicks the car on recharge the battery then turns itself off
[01:03:59.380 --> 01:04:03.780]   So I had tried it on the way to Texas worked awesome. So I said, I wonder if I could do it
[01:04:03.780 --> 01:04:05.460]   So I read that I read that book
[01:04:05.460 --> 01:04:07.340]   I'd never done it prior to
[01:04:07.340 --> 01:04:09.580]   with the exception of one camping trip where
[01:04:09.580 --> 01:04:12.980]   My wife and I camped in the back of a car because we didn't have a tent
[01:04:12.980 --> 01:04:18.060]   In the back of my SUV at that time and that was where it was nice and cold
[01:04:18.060 --> 01:04:18.740]   I'd never done it
[01:04:18.740 --> 01:04:20.740]   so I decided it would be fun to kind of try it and
[01:04:20.940 --> 01:04:24.580]   I was a little bit embarrassed about it because I felt like I didn't want to
[01:04:24.580 --> 01:04:27.220]   You know, I was worried about I
[01:04:27.220 --> 01:04:31.860]   Wasn't doing it because I didn't have the money to pay the hotels. I was doing it because I'm just I
[01:04:31.860 --> 01:04:35.540]   Didn't want to pay the money for the hotels. I want to try something else
[01:04:35.540 --> 01:04:41.500]   So I didn't actually tell anyone I only told one person while I was in New Orleans that I was doing this
[01:04:41.500 --> 01:04:46.180]   But I tried it on the way out there and then when I got there it worked. It worked awesome
[01:04:46.180 --> 01:04:50.620]   I stayed in the car and I felt like a total I felt
[01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:55.100]   I felt a little bit of empathy for you know, the people who live in their cars
[01:04:55.100 --> 01:04:59.180]   I read these books again by these people who live in their cars. I felt a little empathy and I
[01:04:59.180 --> 01:05:04.700]   And I I just but I tried it and it was awesome
[01:05:04.700 --> 01:05:05.260]   I
[01:05:05.260 --> 01:05:10.420]   stayed in the car and I actually wound up staying in the car for two weeks with the exception of one night in Washington DC
[01:05:10.420 --> 01:05:11.780]   on the way home
[01:05:11.780 --> 01:05:16.980]   With stayed with a friend and my rule was that I said I'm gonna do this as a fun experiment
[01:05:17.180 --> 01:05:24.020]   but if it becomes too much I'm going to immediately stop and I'm just gonna get you know, I didn't have a I didn't have a
[01:05:24.020 --> 01:05:27.020]   of a
[01:05:27.020 --> 01:05:33.160]   You know a time limit that I was committed to I was willing to go and get a hotel anytime I needed one
[01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:38.700]   So I thought okay. I'll go ahead as long as I can go to get a hotel anytime
[01:05:38.700 --> 01:05:43.540]   I feel like this isn't work. I'll give it a shot and part of this was just wanted to try to stretch my boundaries
[01:05:43.540 --> 01:05:45.900]   I like the idea from I
[01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:49.500]   Guess it's probably more of stoic philosophy is probably the original
[01:05:49.500 --> 01:05:51.300]   originator of that
[01:05:51.300 --> 01:05:53.500]   It's as far back as I know to trace it
[01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:59.620]   But basically the idea of put yourself in difficult situations so that you don't need to be caught to be coddled
[01:05:59.620 --> 01:06:07.200]   Challenge yourself with difficult situations. So I figured one of the for example, I've always done car camping. I've never done backpack camping
[01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:11.580]   So someday I'd like to go out and do ultra light backpack camping because I'm scared of it
[01:06:11.580 --> 01:06:14.820]   I don't I'm scared of what would I do if I didn't have all the equipment that I can carry in my car
[01:06:14.980 --> 01:06:16.780]   So I try to challenge myself with the stuff
[01:06:16.780 --> 01:06:20.780]   So I wound up doing that and I stayed in the car and the first first night was fine
[01:06:20.780 --> 01:06:25.300]   I stayed at a rest stop kind of got got comfortable with it second night. I get to New Orleans
[01:06:25.300 --> 01:06:29.820]   I don't know what to do and and so here was how I kind of hacked the New Orleans parking
[01:06:29.820 --> 01:06:32.740]   I don't know if hacked. I don't know if I deserve the word hacked, but I thought it was a
[01:06:32.740 --> 01:06:38.980]   Good try I couldn't you know, basically in downtown, New Orleans. There's you got to pay for parking like crazy
[01:06:38.980 --> 01:06:43.300]   It's like 40 bucks a day for parking. So I said I wonder if there is a another option
[01:06:43.300 --> 01:06:46.540]   So I asked some of the valets and one of the valets suggested
[01:06:46.540 --> 01:06:55.440]   the casino so to cut this short because we're at an hour and eight minutes six minutes here to cut this short at the casino they
[01:06:55.440 --> 01:07:00.480]   Have an option where if you play if you gamble for at least 30 minutes
[01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:04.940]   They give you 24 hours of free parking and this is plastered all over the place. So I decided to try it
[01:07:04.940 --> 01:07:07.460]   so I went to the casino and I
[01:07:08.540 --> 01:07:13.900]   Signed up for their membership program and then I paid I figured out that you couldn't do card games table games
[01:07:13.900 --> 01:07:18.080]   I enjoy card games sometime but slots seem to be the most efficient way
[01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:24.940]   And so I would would play the penny slots as long as I paid the plenty penny penny slots for 30 minutes. I
[01:07:24.940 --> 01:07:26.860]   saved my
[01:07:26.860 --> 01:07:29.260]   my $40 a day a parking fee and
[01:07:29.260 --> 01:07:33.420]   That was cool 80 bucks an hour. That's not a bad wage
[01:07:33.860 --> 01:07:39.040]   To save to save the money and then number two I wanted to stay in in the casino garage the whole time
[01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:44.460]   I found an out-of-the-way place to park and I stayed in the casino garage and I had it figured out to where
[01:07:44.460 --> 01:07:46.740]   It was fairly private and it worked great
[01:07:46.740 --> 01:07:50.020]   So then Pennsylvania was easier because instead of being in a downtown
[01:07:50.020 --> 01:07:53.860]   There was lots of great parking lots and things like that and I had you know
[01:07:53.860 --> 01:07:57.780]   I had a hotel lined up that was a lot cheaper in Pennsylvania that I was gonna stay at if I needed to but I
[01:07:57.780 --> 01:07:59.780]   Had so much fun doing it
[01:07:59.780 --> 01:08:01.460]   that I
[01:08:01.460 --> 01:08:03.900]   Just thought it'd be it was it was it was a fun adventure
[01:08:03.900 --> 01:08:06.460]   I don't know that I care that much to ever do it again
[01:08:06.460 --> 01:08:09.260]   I really don't because it was it was a little bit of a pain
[01:08:09.260 --> 01:08:13.260]   To not have the biggest pain of it was not having a place to go that you could just relax
[01:08:13.260 --> 01:08:15.700]   So if you have a hotel room, you can set up your computer
[01:08:15.700 --> 01:08:17.940]   You can get some work done. You feel like you have a place that you belong
[01:08:17.940 --> 01:08:21.340]   When you're in the car because you you're so used to
[01:08:21.340 --> 01:08:27.620]   Being in the car and going places. It's kind of hard just to hang out in the car. That's a little weird
[01:08:27.620 --> 01:08:30.220]   So I wound up and I was working a lot while I was there
[01:08:30.220 --> 01:08:33.980]   So I wound up I went up hanging out with people or you know
[01:08:33.980 --> 01:08:38.900]   Go to the library and working from the library or something like that. So it was an interesting social experiment
[01:08:38.900 --> 01:08:41.900]   I thought I learned a lot from you know with people
[01:08:41.900 --> 01:08:46.500]   There's a lot of news over the last few years of people losing their jobs and living in their cars
[01:08:46.500 --> 01:08:51.980]   I wondered what it would be like and now I think I have a little bit of a little more empathy for what it's like
[01:08:51.980 --> 01:08:58.980]   Really not that bad in many ways, but also a little different. You definitely don't have quite the same sense of belonging
[01:08:59.700 --> 01:09:01.100]   I
[01:09:01.100 --> 01:09:03.100]   definitely if you were a single person
[01:09:03.100 --> 01:09:09.020]   Get man doing the Prius and getting 50 miles per gallon while you're driving across the country and camping in the car
[01:09:09.020 --> 01:09:12.180]   I think I can work awesome for a single person. I would have no
[01:09:12.180 --> 01:09:17.140]   Problem doing that again. I think I would definitely if I were in certain, you know, beautiful locations
[01:09:17.140 --> 01:09:18.260]   I wouldn't want to be stuck in the car
[01:09:18.260 --> 01:09:21.700]   I want to have a tent to go out and you know set up in the
[01:09:21.700 --> 01:09:26.460]   Beautiful mountain stream next to the pat, you know, the beautiful pasture in the mountain valley
[01:09:27.260 --> 01:09:31.420]   but as far as getting there and having a place to stay just it takes all of the
[01:09:31.420 --> 01:09:37.180]   Hassle of finding a hotel while you're on the road right out of the picture knowing that you can just pull over anywhere any rest
[01:09:37.180 --> 01:09:39.180]   stop any truck stop any just
[01:09:39.180 --> 01:09:44.260]   Grocery store parking lot and spend the night takes a lot of hassle out of doing a road trip
[01:09:44.260 --> 01:09:49.980]   So it was a cool experience if I were single, excuse me, if you were a single person traveling alone
[01:09:49.980 --> 01:09:52.620]   I think it works awesome. I saved at least
[01:09:53.900 --> 01:09:59.660]   See I was gone for two weeks. So let's call it 14 days minimum 100 bucks average
[01:09:59.660 --> 01:10:05.300]   So let's call it it was actually more like 150 probably because the places I was at was expensive
[01:10:05.300 --> 01:10:09.060]   So let's say I saved two grand doing it man. Put that two grand aside
[01:10:09.060 --> 01:10:14.820]   Let's run some math for you live on air 2,000 bucks. Let's see how much money I wound up with present value
[01:10:14.820 --> 01:10:21.220]   Let's run a 40 years, you know, let's run 12% for fun. So, let's see that 2,000 bucks 40 years for now
[01:10:21.220 --> 01:10:26.060]   I have 186 thousand extra dollars because of camping in the car for two weeks
[01:10:26.060 --> 01:10:30.180]   Not gonna work with two people by the way, not nearly enough room
[01:10:30.180 --> 01:10:34.020]   You have no room for stuff if you were two people so don't think that this is gonna be I mean try it
[01:10:34.020 --> 01:10:37.140]   Maybe you can but at least do a minivan if you're gonna be two people
[01:10:37.140 --> 01:10:42.340]   So that's my report for you from my trip. I think I've covered everything I wanted to cover. I
[01:10:42.340 --> 01:10:45.060]   Told you about FinCon told you what I learned
[01:10:45.060 --> 01:10:48.700]   I told you about my MSFS class told you some of the things I've learned
[01:10:48.780 --> 01:10:51.220]   I'm gonna be bringing some of the professors that I've worked with
[01:10:51.220 --> 01:10:53.900]   at the at
[01:10:53.900 --> 01:10:58.540]   The American College on the show here just to talk about some of the topics that we covered
[01:10:58.540 --> 01:11:03.600]   I mean, there's really really doing some excellent work tomorrow actually is an interview with dr. Wade Fowell
[01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:07.080]   he is a retirement researcher there at the
[01:11:07.080 --> 01:11:13.100]   American College and really does some in-depth research on retirement. I think you'll enjoy that
[01:11:13.300 --> 01:11:20.300]   So I will release that show tomorrow and then Thursday. I will probably assuming that the the interview goes off
[01:11:20.300 --> 01:11:23.540]   I've got an interview lined up with a young couple
[01:11:23.540 --> 01:11:28.820]   they have a family and that he's actually living in a bus while they build a house and
[01:11:28.820 --> 01:11:33.940]   What I'm interested in talking with them is I've read their site their website
[01:11:33.940 --> 01:11:38.040]   And it sounds like some things about it are really great and some things about it are not so great
[01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:41.740]   So I'm excited about bringing you that interview and that would be should be Thursday
[01:11:41.740 --> 01:11:48.220]   I've received a bunch of questions from you a few on the voicemail line and a bunch of questions via email for Q&A shows
[01:11:48.220 --> 01:11:53.700]   So I will do that probably on Friday and then release some, you know, some more next week. We'll see
[01:11:53.700 --> 01:11:55.700]   I haven't fully set out the agenda
[01:11:55.700 --> 01:12:02.540]   Thank you for listening to today's show. I'm not gonna close out with my normal music. I'm going to close out with a
[01:12:02.540 --> 01:12:08.660]   Fun song that I just want you to hear it's actually it's the FinCon
[01:12:09.060 --> 01:12:13.540]   2014 official song probably it's called can't get enough and
[01:12:13.540 --> 01:12:15.740]   this song
[01:12:15.740 --> 01:12:18.460]   The background on it. It was written as a rap
[01:12:18.460 --> 01:12:22.820]   It's a rap song is written by a man named Matt Giovannese
[01:12:22.820 --> 01:12:27.800]   And he is one of the guys that blogs and podcasts over at listen money matters
[01:12:27.800 --> 01:12:33.540]   Does a good job. They have a very different show than mine. Go check it out
[01:12:33.540 --> 01:12:35.460]   You'll see what I mean if you're interested
[01:12:35.460 --> 01:12:38.940]   They have a very different show than mine, but they do they do a good job with their with their stuff
[01:12:38.940 --> 01:12:47.100]   So he wrote this song produced it and then they did a crowd sourced rap video with it with some of the people at at FinCon
[01:12:47.100 --> 01:12:53.420]   Lip-syncing with this video and I thought he did an awesome job with it
[01:12:53.420 --> 01:12:56.820]   And so I'm gonna close with that song send you out with it. Enjoy
[01:12:56.820 --> 01:13:02.620]   It's this this show is not gonna become all about the financial podcasting business

[01:13:40.900 --> 01:13:45.260]   It's like a field of dreams and it seems that everybody networking try to make them green
[01:13:45.260 --> 01:13:52.060]   Yo, we all prolific about money specific. We've got a head spinning like we're doing with it. Uh, it's just what we do
[01:13:52.060 --> 01:13:54.780]   So let's tell them what we all go through. Oh
[01:13:54.780 --> 01:13:58.780]   Wait, stop eight o'clock and I got writers block, but I'm on my fifth
[01:13:58.780 --> 01:14:04.460]   So, you know, I can't stop put my fingers to the keys and I start to write when I finish I can edit just to
[01:14:04.460 --> 01:14:09.660]   Make it tight then I hit submit. Yeah, that's legit sit back and watch all the shares
[01:14:09.660 --> 01:14:15.460]   I get I check Facebook and Twitter. It's only getting bigger. I'm getting mad likes till I hit seven figures
[01:14:15.460 --> 01:14:21.780]   I'm gonna bring a more credible link to me thinks that after that I deserve some drinks celebrate till I'm wasted
[01:14:21.780 --> 01:14:24.060]   I spend all of my dough. I never worry about
[01:14:24.940 --> 01:14:30.180]   Like a cheetah straight chasing down these algorithms I'm not to give a normal nerd an aneurysm
[01:14:30.180 --> 01:14:34.340]   It's just a matter of time until I start to rank and laugh all the way to the back
[01:14:34.340 --> 01:14:36.980]   Cuz I check my stats like every day
[01:14:36.980 --> 01:14:40.700]   Hey, even though nothing ever goes my way cuz I can't get enough
[01:14:40.700 --> 01:14:50.660]   And I'm just obsessed gotta refresh Google Analytics, so he's got me stressed cuz I can't get enough
[01:14:50.660 --> 01:14:52.660]   Oh
[01:14:52.660 --> 01:14:59.980]   It used to be so easy spinning content now it sounds so sleazy
[01:14:59.980 --> 01:15:03.260]   Keeping up with my blog roll cuz that's how we roll
[01:15:03.260 --> 01:15:07.620]   We live in the four rooms cuz that's how we throw we used to cheat the system
[01:15:07.620 --> 01:15:12.380]   Hunting us down, but they always missing and ever since then in the way back when
[01:15:12.380 --> 01:15:15.220]   It's harder than it's ever been now
[01:15:15.220 --> 01:15:19.740]   I'm begging for my lips comments and various tweets and every time I sell a book I hear them calling me thief
[01:15:19.740 --> 01:15:22.220]   And when I see a new subscriber, it's a sign of relief
[01:15:22.220 --> 01:15:25.340]   But when I see that leave my lips, it's always causing me grief. Oh, man
