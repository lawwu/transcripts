[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.480]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.160]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.200]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.800]   Today, I have the pleasure of introducing Dr. Anna Lemke.
[00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.560]   Dr. Lemke is a psychiatrist
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.280]   and the chief of the Addiction Medicine
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:23.600]   Dual Diagnosis Clinic
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.240]   at Stanford University School of Medicine.
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.640]   She's a psychiatrist who treats patients
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.580]   struggling with addiction.
[00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.620]   She has successfully treated patients
[00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:35.920]   dealing with drug addiction, alcohol addiction,
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.620]   and behavioral addictions,
[00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.020]   such as gambling and sex addiction,
[00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.360]   as well as other types of addiction.
[00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.720]   In fact, during our discussion,
[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.560]   I learned that there are a huge range of behaviors
[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.960]   and substances to which people can become addicted to,
[00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.900]   and that there is a common biological underpinning
[00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.740]   of all those addictions.
[00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.340]   I also learned that there's a common path
[00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.040]   to the treatment and recovery
[00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.200]   from essentially all addictions.
[00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.320]   Dr. Lemke explained that to me
[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.620]   and explained how to think about and conceptualize
[00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.020]   our own addictions,
[00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.120]   as well as the addictions of other people
[00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.920]   who are struggling to get treatment,
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.280]   move through treatment,
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.320]   and stay sober from their addictions.
[00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.680]   In addition to treating patients,
[00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.160]   Dr. Lemke is an author
[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.120]   and was featured in the 2020 Netflix documentary,
[00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.980]   "The Social Dilemma."
[00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.560]   I'm excited to tell you that she has a new book coming out
[00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.280]   called "Dopamine Nation,
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.760]   Finding Balance in the Age of Indulgence."
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.860]   The book comes out August 24th
[00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.160]   and is an absolutely fascinating read into addiction
[00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.000]   and ways to treat various types of addiction.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.080]   I've read the book cover to cover,
[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.620]   and all I'll tell you is that at the very first chapter
[00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.600]   and throughout, you're going to be absolutely blown away.
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.240]   The stories about her patients are extremely engaging.
[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.080]   It brings forward the real struggle of addiction
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.680]   and the incredible, I think it's fair to say,
[00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.720]   heroic battles that people fight
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.760]   in order to get through addictions of various kinds.
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.060]   And all of that is woven through with story,
[00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.080]   with science, and ways that make it very accessible
[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.140]   to anyone, whether or not you have a science background
[00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.500]   or not, I can't recommend it highly enough.
[00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.740]   So again, the book is "Dopamine Nation,
[00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.800]   Finding Balance in the Age of Indulgence."
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.240]   It comes out August 24th of this year, 2021,
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.000]   and you can pre-order that book by going to Amazon.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.920]   We will provide a link to that in the show caption.
[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.560]   Before we begin, I just want to mention that this podcast
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.560]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.740]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.480]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.320]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.400]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.280]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.360]   Our first sponsor is Roca.
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.340]   Roca makes sunglasses and eyeglasses
[00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.040]   that are of the absolute utmost quality.
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.620]   Founded by two all-American swimmers from Stanford,
[00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.740]   everything about the sunglasses and eyeglasses
[00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.660]   that Roca makes was designed with performance in mind.
[00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.620]   First of all, they're very lightweight.
[00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.520]   You don't even really notice that they're on your face.
[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.640]   Second of all, even if you get sweaty, they don't slip off.
[00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.560]   In fact, they were designed to be worn at work
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.440]   or around the house, but also if you're running or biking.
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.900]   So you can move seamlessly between different activities
[00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.860]   without having to change your sunglasses or eyeglasses.
[00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.880]   In addition, the lenses are designed
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.480]   with the science of the visual system in mind.
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:21.560]   I've spent my career working
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:22.960]   on the science of the visual system,
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.160]   and I can tell you that it's not trivial to build a lens
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.280]   that allows you to see with perfect clarity
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.720]   whether or not you're in bright sunshine
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.180]   and then move into shadows,
[00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.300]   but the Roca glasses allow you to do that.
[00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.560]   You always see things with absolute clarity.
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.720]   Another terrific thing about Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:39.900]   is the aesthetic.
[00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.080]   A lot of so-called performance sunglasses and eyeglasses,
[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.280]   they're not really built with the best aesthetic,
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.600]   and they kind of make people look like cyborgs.
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.400]   With Roca, they have a lot of different styles
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.620]   to choose from, but all those styles are of the sort
[00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.780]   that you could wear out to dinner or to work
[00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.400]   or when engaging in physical activity.
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.880]   If you'd like to try Roca glasses,
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.760]   you can go to Roca, that's R-O-K-A.com,
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.760]   and enter the code Huberman at checkout.
[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.980]   And if you do that, you'll get 20% off your first order.
[00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.320]   Today's podcast is also brought to us by InsideTracker.
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.800]   InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.420]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:15.960]   to help you better understand your body
[00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.720]   and reach your health goals.
[00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.180]   I'm a big believer in getting regular blood work done,
[00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:21.700]   and I've been doing that for a number of years
[00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.140]   for the simple reason that most, if not all of the factors
[00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.660]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.640]   can only be analyzed in detail with a quality blood test.
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.040]   And now with the advent of modern DNA tests,
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.840]   you can get further insight into what's going on
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.360]   beneath the hood, so to speak.
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.960]   The problem with a lot of blood and DNA tests, however,
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.240]   is you get numbers back,
[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.880]   you get the levels back of various things,
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.120]   and you find out if certain things are too high or too low
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.360]   or right on target,
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.240]   but there are no directives about how to move those numbers
[00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.400]   in the direction that you would want them to go.
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.180]   With InsideTracker, they have a dashboard
[00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:54.840]   that makes all of that very easy,
[00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.960]   and that dashboard takes your numbers
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.060]   and can help direct you towards particular lifestyle factors,
[00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.560]   nutrition factors, exercise, supplementation, et cetera,
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:04.920]   that can help you bring those numbers
[00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.220]   into the ranges that are right for you.
[00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.160]   If you'd like to try InsideTracker,
[00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.180]   you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman,
[00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:13.020]   and if you do that,
[00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.900]   you'll get 25% off any of InsideTracker's plans.
[00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.340]   Just use the code Huberman at checkout.
[00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.420]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Headspace.
[00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:23.000]   Headspace is a meditation app
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.060]   that's backed by 25 published peer review studies
[00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:29.760]   and has over 600,000 five-star reviews.
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.700]   I've been meditating for a very long time.
[00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:33.900]   I'm 45 years old now, almost 46,
[00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.500]   and I started meditating when I was about 15 years old.
[00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.380]   The problem, however, is keeping up a meditation practice.
[00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:41.820]   I've experienced this myself.
[00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.100]   I've had periods of time where I'm meditating regularly
[00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:45.980]   and then periods of time where I just kind of
[00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:49.320]   fall off the rails and I'm just not doing it at all.
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.780]   There's now tons of evidence,
[00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:55.180]   evidence from neuroscience, evidence from psychology,
[00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.120]   evidence from areas of biology focused on stress
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.260]   and the immune system that a meditation practice,
[00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.820]   when done regularly, is extremely beneficial
[00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:04.740]   for mental and physical health
[00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.740]   and things like focus and creativity.
[00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:10.000]   However, you have to do the meditation practice,
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.700]   and so if you're not doing it regularly,
[00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:12.820]   that's a serious problem,
[00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:15.100]   and if you are doing it regularly, great.
[00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.060]   With Headspace, I find that I can stick
[00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:19.940]   to a meditation practice very easily.
[00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:21.360]   In fact, that's why I started using it
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.020]   and that's why I continue to use it.
[00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:25.980]   I try and get a meditation practice in every day,
[00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:27.380]   but sometimes that requires
[00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:29.420]   that it be a brief meditation practice.
[00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:31.060]   With Headspace, they have a huge range
[00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:33.380]   of different meditations of different durations,
[00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:36.260]   and so that's really helpful in building and maintaining
[00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.500]   these powerful meditation practices.
[00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:39.640]   If you want to try Headspace,
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:42.760]   you can go to headspace.com/specialoffer,
[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:45.100]   and if you do that, you'll get a free one-month trial
[00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:47.700]   with Headspace's full library of meditations.
[00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:49.380]   This is the best deal offered by Headspace.
[00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:51.320]   Basically, you get access to everything they've got
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:53.460]   completely free for a one-month trial,
[00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:54.420]   so if you'd like to try that,
[00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:57.720]   go to headspace.com/specialoffer.
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:01.780]   And now for my discussion with Dr. Anna Lemke.
[00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:04.720]   All right, great to have you here.
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:05.640]   - Thank you for having me.
[00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:07.060]   I'm excited to be here.
[00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:08.580]   - Yeah, I have a lot of questions for you.
[00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:13.520]   I and many listeners of this podcast
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:17.720]   are obsessed with dopamine, and what is dopamine?
[00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:18.560]   How does it work?
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:20.660]   We all hear that dopamine is this molecule
[00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:22.740]   associated with pleasure.
[00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:25.660]   I think the term dopamine hits,
[00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:27.500]   like I'm getting a dopamine hit from this,
[00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:30.580]   from Instagram or from likes or from praise
[00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:35.040]   or from whatever, is now commonly heard.
[00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:39.720]   What is dopamine, and what are maybe some things
[00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.980]   about dopamine that most people don't know
[00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:44.820]   and probably that I don't know either?
[00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:47.220]   - So dopamine is a neurotransmitter,
[00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:49.440]   and neurotransmitters are those molecules
[00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:52.740]   that bridge the gap between two neurons.
[00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:55.040]   So they essentially allow one neuron,
[00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.740]   the presynaptic neuron,
[00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:59.700]   to communicate with the postsynaptic neuron.
[00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:03.260]   Dopamine is intimately associated
[00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.580]   with the experience of reward,
[00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:06.900]   but also with movement,
[00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:08.320]   which I think is really interesting
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:10.940]   because movement and reward are linked, right?
[00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:14.540]   If you think about early humans,
[00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:18.660]   you had to move in order to go seek out the water
[00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:21.620]   or the meat or whatever it was.
[00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:24.420]   And even in the most primitive organisms,
[00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:27.540]   dopamine is released when food is sensed in the environment,
[00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:31.700]   for example, sea elegance, a very primitive worm.
[00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:36.780]   So dopamine is this really powerful,
[00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:39.860]   important molecule in the brain
[00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:43.360]   that helps us experience pleasure.
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:46.120]   It's not the only neurotransmitter involved in pleasure,
[00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:48.380]   but it's a really, really important one.
[00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:51.420]   And if you wanna think about something
[00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:53.260]   that most people don't know about dopamine,
[00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:54.740]   which I think is really interesting,
[00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:57.920]   is that we are always releasing dopamine
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:00.700]   at a kind of tonic baseline rate,
[00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:04.240]   and it's really the deviation from that baseline
[00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:06.980]   rather than hits of dopamine in a vacuum
[00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:08.180]   that make a difference.
[00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:10.180]   So when we experience pleasure,
[00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:12.980]   our dopamine release goes above baseline,
[00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:16.980]   and likewise, dopamine can go below that tonic baseline,
[00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:19.940]   and then we experience a kind of pain.
[00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:22.420]   - Interesting, so is it fair to say
[00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:24.940]   that one's baseline levels of dopamine,
[00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:27.860]   how frequently we are releasing dopamine
[00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:31.560]   in the absence of some, I don't know, drug or food
[00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:34.580]   or experience just sitting, being,
[00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:38.260]   is that associated with how happy somebody is,
[00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:41.620]   their kind of baseline of happiness or level of depression?
[00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:46.220]   - There is evidence that shows that people who are depressed
[00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:51.220]   may indeed have lower tonic levels of dopamine.
[00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:53.840]   So that's a really reasonable thought,
[00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:57.680]   and there's some evidence to suggest that that may be true.
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:58.920]   The other thing that we know,
[00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:03.920]   and this is really kind of what the book is about,
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:08.740]   is that if we expose ourselves chronically
[00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:11.240]   to substances or behaviors
[00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:15.580]   that repeatedly release large amounts of dopamine
[00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:17.140]   in our brain's reward pathway,
[00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:20.180]   that we can change our tonic baseline
[00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:22.500]   and actually lower it over time
[00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:26.200]   as our brain tries to compensate for all of that dopamine,
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:31.200]   which is more really than we were designed to experience.
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:34.020]   - Interesting, and is it the case
[00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:35.940]   that our baseline levels of dopamine
[00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:39.100]   are set by our genetics, by our heredity?
[00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:41.140]   - Well, I think if you think about
[00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:44.460]   sort of the early stages of development in infancy,
[00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:45.920]   certainly that is true.
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:48.740]   You're kind of born with probably
[00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:50.280]   whatever is your baseline level,
[00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:54.620]   but obviously your experiences can have a huge impact
[00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:59.620]   on where your dopamine level ultimately settles out.
[00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:05.300]   - So if somebody's disposition is one of constant excitement
[00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:08.340]   and anticipation or easily excited,
[00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:10.300]   these are, I think, about the kind of people where you say,
[00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:12.180]   hey, do you want to check out this new place for tacos?
[00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:13.420]   And they're like, yeah, that'd be great.
[00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:16.640]   And other people are a little more cynical,
[00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:19.280]   harder to budge, like my bulldog Costello.
[00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:23.200]   Very, very stable low levels of dopamine
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:24.960]   with big inflections in his case.
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:31.660]   Do you think that's set in terms of our parents
[00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:34.960]   and obviously nature and nurture interact,
[00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:39.080]   but is dopamine at the core of our temperament?
[00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:42.940]   - I don't really think we know the answer to that,
[00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:46.800]   but I will say that people are definitely born
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:49.100]   with different temperaments,
[00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:53.320]   and those temperaments do affect their ability
[00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:55.660]   to experience joy.
[00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:57.880]   And we've known that for a long time,
[00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:00.380]   and we describe that in many different ways.
[00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:02.740]   One of the ways that we describe that in the modern era
[00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:05.160]   is to use psychiatric nomenclature,
[00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.940]   like this person has a dysthymic temperament,
[00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:11.480]   or this person has chronic major depressive disorder.
[00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:14.260]   In terms of looking specifically
[00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.420]   at who's vulnerable to addiction,
[00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:19.720]   that's an interesting sort of mixed bag,
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:22.140]   because when you look at the research
[00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:24.140]   on risk factors for addiction,
[00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:26.900]   so what kind of temperament of a person
[00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:29.100]   makes them more vulnerable to addiction,
[00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:31.220]   you see some interesting findings.
[00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:33.900]   First, you see that people who are more impulsive
[00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:35.420]   are more vulnerable to addiction.
[00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:37.020]   So what is impulsivity?
[00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:39.900]   That means having difficulty putting space
[00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:42.860]   between the thought or desire to do something
[00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:44.140]   and actually doing it.
[00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:47.200]   And people who have difficulty putting a space there,
[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:51.460]   who have a thought to do something and just do it impulsively
[00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:53.920]   are people who are more vulnerable to addiction.
[00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:55.420]   - Interesting.
[00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:57.020]   In terms of impulsivity,
[00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:59.300]   is this something that relates literally
[00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:01.080]   to the startle reflex?
[00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:03.660]   Like I, for instance, as a lab director,
[00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:05.180]   I'm familiar with walking around my lab,
[00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:08.260]   and when I decide, deciding I'm going to talk to my people,
[00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:09.460]   of course, when they knock on my door,
[00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:11.900]   it's always like, "Wait, why am I being bothered right now?"
[00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:12.980]   Even though I love to talk to them,
[00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:14.820]   but I walk around my lab from time to time,
[00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:18.380]   and some people I notice I'll say, "Do you have a moment?"
[00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:20.740]   And they'll slowly turn around and say, "Yeah,"
[00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:22.400]   or "No," in some cases.
[00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:26.120]   And other people will jump the moment I say their name.
[00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:30.700]   They actually have a kind of a heightened startle reflex.
[00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:32.320]   Is that related to impulsivity
[00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:35.100]   or is what you're referring to an attempt
[00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:38.880]   to withhold behavior that's very deliberate
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:40.480]   under very deliberate conditions?
[00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:43.200]   - Yeah, so I don't think that that startle reflex
[00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:45.360]   is necessarily related to impulsivity.
[00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:47.360]   That can be related to anxiety.
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:49.100]   So people who are high anxiety,
[00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:52.160]   people will tend to have more of a startle reflex.
[00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:54.200]   Impulsivity is a little bit different.
[00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:57.940]   And by the way, impulsivity is not always bad, right?
[00:13:57.940 --> 00:14:01.780]   Impulsivity is that thing where
[00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:04.580]   there's not a lot of self-editing
[00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:07.800]   or worrying about future consequences.
[00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:10.980]   You know, you have the idea to do something and you do it.
[00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:13.980]   And of course, we can imagine many scenarios
[00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:16.180]   where that's absolutely wonderful.
[00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:18.940]   You know, there can be a sort of,
[00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:23.940]   let's say, intimate interactions between people
[00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:25.600]   where you wouldn't really want to be
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:27.060]   super inhibited about it, right?
[00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:30.640]   You would want to be disinhibited and impulsive.
[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:35.020]   I can also imagine like sort of fight or flight scenarios,
[00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:36.760]   like battle scenarios, right?
[00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:39.660]   Where it would really be good to be impulsive
[00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:41.420]   and just go, rah, you know, just go.
[00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:43.040]   - Where hesitation can cost you your life.
[00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:44.900]   - Right, yes, that's right, that's right.
[00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:47.880]   But, you know, and I think this brings up a really,
[00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:50.980]   something that I've come to believe
[00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:54.240]   after 25 years of practicing psychiatry
[00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:57.460]   is that what we now conceptualize
[00:14:57.460 --> 00:15:02.460]   in our current ecosystem as mental illness
[00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:06.500]   are actually traits that in another ecosystem
[00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:08.580]   might be very advantageous.
[00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:11.580]   They're just not advantageous right now
[00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:13.300]   because of the world that we live in.
[00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:18.180]   And I think impulsivity is potentially one of those, right?
[00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:20.540]   'Cause we live in this world that's sort of like
[00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:25.540]   you have to constantly be thinking sort of rationally
[00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:29.580]   about the consequences of X, Y, or Z.
[00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:32.580]   And it's such a sensory rich environment, right?
[00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:36.100]   That we're being bombarded with all of these opportunities,
[00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:37.660]   these sensory opportunities,
[00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:39.620]   and we have to constantly check ourselves.
[00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:43.720]   And so impulsivity is something that right now
[00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:45.580]   can be a difficult trait,
[00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:48.540]   but isn't in and of itself a bad thing.
[00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:49.380]   - I see. - Yeah.
[00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:51.140]   - Yeah, and it's, I'm beginning to realize
[00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:53.860]   it's a fine line between spontaneity and impulsivity.
[00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:54.700]   - Yeah.
[00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:59.720]   - What is pleasure and how does it work
[00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:03.420]   at the biological level and if it feels right
[00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:05.100]   at the psychological level?
[00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:09.180]   I think we, and if you don't mind painting a picture
[00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:12.500]   of sort of the range of things
[00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:16.740]   that you have observed in your clinic or in life
[00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:18.480]   that people can become addicted to.
[00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:20.460]   But just to start off really simply,
[00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:23.140]   what is this thing that we call pleasure?
[00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:25.580]   - Well, I think it's actually really hard
[00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:29.080]   to define pleasure in any kind of succinct way,
[00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:32.660]   because certainly there is the seeking out of high
[00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:39.060]   or a euphoria or I think the kind of experience
[00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:42.900]   that most anybody would associate with the word pleasure.
[00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:47.580]   But also the seeking out of those same substances
[00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:51.660]   and behaviors is often a way to escape pain.
[00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:55.360]   So for example, when I talk to people with addiction,
[00:16:55.360 --> 00:17:01.920]   sometimes their initial foray into using a drug
[00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:05.500]   is to get pleasure, but very often it's a way
[00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:09.260]   to escape their suffering, whatever their suffering may be.
[00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:12.820]   And certainly as people become addicted,
[00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:15.940]   even those who initially were seeking out pleasure
[00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:20.460]   are ultimately just trying to avoid the pain of withdrawal
[00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:23.660]   or the pain of the consequences of their drug use.
[00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:28.660]   So I think it's very hard to actually define it
[00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:32.360]   as this unitary thing, and it's certainly not
[00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:33.880]   just getting a high.
[00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:36.840]   There are so many ways in which people
[00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:39.800]   sort of want to escape, which is not the same thing
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:43.640]   as sort of this hedonic wanting to feel pleasure.
[00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:46.540]   - So someone could decide that they want to go out and dance
[00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:49.020]   or get up and dance because of the pleasure of dancing.
[00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:50.160]   I can imagine that.
[00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:56.140]   And maybe it's very difficult for them to stay seated
[00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:59.220]   when a particular song comes on, for instance.
[00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:03.620]   But seeking what we would call pleasure
[00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:05.380]   in order to eliminate pain,
[00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:07.340]   that evokes a different picture in my mind.
[00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:11.360]   That evokes a picture of somebody that feels lost
[00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:13.480]   or depressed or underwhelmed.
[00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:17.400]   I definitely want to get into the precise
[00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:20.060]   and general description of addiction and what that is.
[00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:22.020]   But in a previous conversation we had,
[00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:23.660]   you said something that really rung in my mind,
[00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:27.900]   which is that many people who become addicted to things,
[00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:31.540]   let's call them addicts, have this feeling
[00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:35.280]   that normal life isn't interesting enough,
[00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:39.040]   that they are seeking a super normal experience
[00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:42.300]   and that the day-to-day routine, balance,
[00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:44.340]   which is actually in the title of your book,
[00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:47.280]   Dopamine Nation, Finding Balance in the Age of Indulgence,
[00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:51.460]   that the word balance itself can sometimes be a bit
[00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:54.860]   of an aversive term for people.
[00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:59.140]   And I'm struck by this idea,
[00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:00.540]   and the reason I want to explore it
[00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:03.380]   is because so much of what I see online
[00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:06.760]   is about generating a lack of balance,
[00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:10.700]   about being tilted forward at all times,
[00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:13.820]   really leaning into life hard, experiencing life,
[00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:15.660]   living a full life.
[00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:18.340]   Even the commencement speech given by Steve Jobs
[00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:22.580]   on this campus was really about finding passion, digging.
[00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:25.240]   That's so much in the narrative now.
[00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:28.480]   So maybe you could just tell us a little bit
[00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:31.580]   about your experience with this association,
[00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:32.420]   if it really exists,
[00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:35.580]   between people's sense of the normalcy
[00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:38.020]   or maybe even how boring life can be
[00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:40.680]   and their tendency to become addicts of some sort.
[00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:46.780]   - Yeah, well, I mean, I think that life for humans
[00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:49.980]   has always been hard,
[00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:54.980]   but I think that now it's harder in unprecedented ways.
[00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:59.340]   And I think that the way that life is really hard now
[00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:02.120]   is that it actually is really boring.
[00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:03.660]   And the reason that it's boring
[00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:07.860]   is because all of our survival needs are met, right?
[00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:10.620]   I mean, we don't even have to leave our homes
[00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:13.260]   to meet every single physical need,
[00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:17.420]   as long as you're of a certain level of financial wellbeing,
[00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:22.420]   which frankly, we talk so much about the income gap,
[00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:24.360]   and certainly there is this enormous gap
[00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:25.500]   between rich and poor,
[00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:28.300]   but that gap is smaller than it's ever been
[00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:30.900]   in the history of humans.
[00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:35.660]   Even the poorest of the poor have more excess income
[00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:36.960]   to spend on leisure goods
[00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:40.140]   than they ever have before in human history.
[00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:42.700]   If you look at leisure time, for example,
[00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:45.740]   so people without a high school education
[00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:50.740]   have 42% more leisure time than people with a college degree.
[00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:56.840]   So my point here is that life is hard now
[00:20:56.840 --> 00:21:00.700]   in this really weird way
[00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:04.580]   in that we don't really have anything that we have to do.
[00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:08.420]   So we're all forced to make stuff up,
[00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:13.420]   whether it's being a scientist or being a doctor
[00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:18.620]   or being an Olympic athlete or climbing Mount Everest,
[00:21:18.620 --> 00:21:23.820]   and people really vary in their need for friction.
[00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:26.300]   And some people need a lot more than others.
[00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:29.660]   And if they don't have it, they're really, really unhappy.
[00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:32.780]   And I do think that a lot of the people that I see
[00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:35.620]   with addiction and other forms of mental illness
[00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:38.860]   are people who need more friction.
[00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:40.940]   Like they're unhappy,
[00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:43.020]   not necessarily because there's something wrong
[00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:43.860]   with their brain,
[00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:47.200]   but because their brain is not suited to this world.
[00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:49.620]   - And do you think they have that sense,
[00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:51.340]   my brain isn't suited to this world,
[00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:55.780]   or they simply feel a restlessness
[00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:58.600]   and they're constantly seeking stimulation?
[00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:00.280]   - I think that's right.
[00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:04.420]   Yeah, I think it's not really knowing what's wrong with me,
[00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:08.300]   and why am I unhappy, how can I be happier?
[00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:11.100]   And of course, as you talk about what's so pervasive
[00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:12.700]   in our narrative now is like,
[00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:17.700]   find your passion, find your whatever it is
[00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:18.540]   to save the world.
[00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:20.340]   And in a way that's good,
[00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:23.580]   because it has people out in the world and seeking.
[00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:27.980]   But in a way, it can also be misleading in the sense
[00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:31.780]   that I think people aren't entirely aware
[00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:36.340]   that the world is a hard place and that life is hard
[00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:40.780]   and that we're all kind of making it up.
[00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:41.740]   Do you know what I mean?
[00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:44.380]   - Yeah, well, there's a book by Cal Newport.
[00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:45.800]   I don't know if you know Cal Newport's work,
[00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:49.980]   but you guys are very symbiotic in your messages.
[00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:52.720]   He's a professor of computer science at Georgetown.
[00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:54.740]   Yes, at Georgetown.
[00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:58.080]   And wrote a book some years ago, really ahead of its time,
[00:22:58.080 --> 00:22:59.640]   called "So Good They Can't Ignore You,"
[00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:04.640]   which is about not meditating or doing much work
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:08.340]   to try and figure out what one's passion is by thinking,
[00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:11.100]   but rather go out and acquire skills
[00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:14.220]   and develop a sense of passion for something
[00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:16.260]   by your experience of hard work
[00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:18.060]   and getting better and feedback.
[00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:19.300]   A little bit of the growth mindset
[00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:21.000]   thing of our colleague, Carol Dweck.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.060]   But he's gone on to write books, "Deep Work,"
[00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:27.540]   which is all about removing yourself from technology
[00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:29.060]   and doing deep work.
[00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:32.580]   And he's been a big proponent of the evils of context
[00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:35.100]   switching too often throughout the day
[00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:36.600]   for sake of productivity, mostly.
[00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:39.500]   His new book is called "A World Without Email."
[00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:41.820]   I'm beginning to realize as I cite off these books
[00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:43.820]   and your book, "Dopamine Nation,"
[00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:45.980]   finding balance in the age of indulgence,
[00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:48.180]   that maybe the reason why you two don't know
[00:23:48.180 --> 00:23:49.900]   about one another is because neither of you
[00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:50.940]   are on social media.
[00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:51.780]   - That's it, that's it. - Right.
[00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:54.020]   And yet you're two of the most productive people
[00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:56.660]   that I know, including productive authors.
[00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:58.140]   So that's a discussion unto itself.
[00:23:58.140 --> 00:23:59.900]   But I find this fascinating.
[00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:04.700]   So let's talk about the pleasure, pain, balance,
[00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:06.040]   and addiction.
[00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:10.800]   And I've heard you use this seesaw or balance scale analogy
[00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:13.440]   before, and I think it's a wonderful one
[00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:18.440]   that really, for me, clarified what addiction is,
[00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:20.600]   at least at the mechanistic level.
[00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:24.200]   - Yeah, so to me, one of the most significant findings
[00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:26.360]   in neuroscience in the last 75 years
[00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:29.400]   is that pleasure and pain are co-located,
[00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:31.100]   which means the same parts of the brain
[00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:34.040]   that process pleasure also process pain.
[00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:35.880]   And they work like a balance.
[00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:38.660]   So when we feel pleasure, our balance tips one way.
[00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:41.740]   When we feel pain, it tips in the opposite direction.
[00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:44.940]   And one of the overriding rules governing this balance
[00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:46.520]   is that it wants to stay level.
[00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:48.340]   So it doesn't want to remain tipped very long
[00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:49.900]   to pleasure or to pain.
[00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:52.420]   And with any deviation from neutrality,
[00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:55.900]   the brain will work very hard to restore a level balance,
[00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:58.420]   or what scientists call homeostasis.
[00:24:58.420 --> 00:25:00.260]   And the way the brain does that
[00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:03.340]   is with any stimulus to one side,
[00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:06.460]   there will be a tip an equal and opposite amount
[00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:07.740]   to the other side.
[00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:09.660]   - It's like you have principal laws of physics.
[00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:11.040]   - Yes, right, right.
[00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:13.220]   So I like to watch YouTube videos.
[00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:16.300]   When I watch YouTube videos of "American Idol,"
[00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:18.180]   it tips to the side of pleasure.
[00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:20.940]   And then when I stop watching it,
[00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:22.300]   I have a comedown, right,
[00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:25.700]   which is a tip to the equal and opposite amount
[00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:26.600]   on the other side.
[00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:28.500]   And that's that moment of wanting to watch
[00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:30.140]   one more YouTube video, right?
[00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:33.120]   - Yeah, and I just want to interject there.
[00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:37.700]   So this moment of wanting to watch another
[00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:40.620]   that is associated with pain, I think,
[00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:43.560]   is are we always aware of that happening?
[00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:46.340]   Because you just described it in a very conscious way.
[00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:49.800]   But when I indulge in something I enjoy,
[00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:52.940]   I'm usually thinking about just wanting more of that thing.
[00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:56.140]   I don't think about the pain, I just think about more.
[00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:58.580]   - Right, so really excellent point,
[00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:00.660]   because we're mostly not aware of it.
[00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:02.420]   And it's also reflexive.
[00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:05.600]   So it's not something that consciously happens
[00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:06.560]   or that we're aware of
[00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:09.720]   unless we really begin to pay attention.
[00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:12.660]   And when we begin to pay attention,
[00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:15.940]   we really can become very aware of it in the moment.
[00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:18.160]   Again, it's like a falling away,
[00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:20.600]   like you're on social media
[00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:23.340]   and you get a good tweet of something,
[00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:26.080]   and then you can't stop yourself,
[00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:28.760]   because there's this awareness, a latent awareness,
[00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:31.420]   that as soon as I disengage from this behavior,
[00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:34.440]   I'm going to experience a kind of a pain,
[00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:37.820]   a falling away, a missing that feeling,
[00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:39.820]   a wanting more of it.
[00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:42.180]   And of course, one way to combat that
[00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:45.160]   is to do it more and more and more and more.
[00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:48.860]   So I think that is really what I want people to tune into
[00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:50.780]   and get an awareness around,
[00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:53.740]   because once you tune into it, you can see it a lot.
[00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:55.500]   And then when you begin to see it,
[00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:58.660]   you have, and if you keep the model of the balance in mind,
[00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:03.660]   I think it gives people kind of a way to imagine
[00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:07.260]   what they're experiencing on a neurobiological level
[00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:08.540]   and understand it.
[00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:11.700]   And in that understanding, get some mastery over it,
[00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:13.740]   which is really what this is all about,
[00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:17.080]   because ultimately we do need to disengage, right?
[00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:21.160]   We can't live in that space all the time, right?
[00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:23.140]   We have other things we need to do.
[00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:25.860]   And there are also serious consequences
[00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:30.280]   that come with trying to repeat and continue that experience
[00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:31.580]   or that feeling.
[00:27:31.580 --> 00:27:33.560]   - Yeah, so if I understand this correctly,
[00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:37.420]   when we find something or when something finds us
[00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:41.820]   that we enjoy, that feels pleasureful, social media,
[00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:46.120]   food, sex, gambling, whatever happens to be in,
[00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:48.480]   we will explore the full range of these.
[00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:50.260]   There's some dopamine release
[00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:52.360]   when we engage in that behavior.
[00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:55.260]   And then what you're telling me is that very quickly.
[00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:56.100]   - Yes.
[00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:58.260]   - And beneath my conscious awareness,
[00:27:58.260 --> 00:28:01.560]   there's a tilting back of the scale
[00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:05.220]   where pleasure is reduced by way of increasing pain.
[00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:06.340]   - Right.
[00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:07.780]   - And I've heard you say before
[00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:12.780]   that the pain mechanism has some competitive advantages
[00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:16.260]   over the pleasure mechanism,
[00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:19.140]   such that it doesn't just bring the scale back to level.
[00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:22.520]   It actually brings pain higher than pleasure.
[00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:25.220]   Could you tell us a little bit more about that?
[00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:28.420]   - Yeah, yeah, so what happens again,
[00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:31.900]   so the hallmark of any addictive substance or behavior
[00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:34.140]   is that it releases a lot of dopamine
[00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:35.840]   in our brain's reward pathway, right?
[00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:38.600]   Like broccoli just doesn't release a lot of dopamine,
[00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:40.380]   just doesn't, right?
[00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:42.460]   - I'm trying to imagine, I was about to say maybe,
[00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:46.160]   and I stopped myself because no, broccoli is good.
[00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:49.940]   It can be really good, but broccoli is never amazing.
[00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:52.660]   - Right, broccoli is never amazing.
[00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:54.980]   - Honestly, we can probably find somebody on the planet
[00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:56.060]   for whom broccoli is amazing.
[00:28:56.060 --> 00:28:59.180]   And of course, if I'm starving, broccoli is amazing.
[00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:01.220]   - Rich Roll, Rich Roll is big on plants,
[00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:03.980]   and he has a good relationship to plants.
[00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:07.540]   Rich, tell us how to make broccoli amazing.
[00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:08.980]   If anyone could do it, it'd be rich.
[00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:13.060]   - Yeah, yeah, but what happens right after I do something
[00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:15.540]   that is really pleasurable and releases a lot of dopamine
[00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:18.440]   is again, my brain is going to immediately compensate
[00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:21.060]   by down-regulating my own dopamine receptors,
[00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:24.820]   my own dopamine transmission to compensate for that, okay?
[00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:27.940]   And that's that come down or the hangover,
[00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:30.500]   that after effect, that moment of wanting to do it more.
[00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:34.160]   Now, if I just wait for that feeling to pass,
[00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:36.100]   then my dopamine will re-regulate itself
[00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:38.060]   and I'll go back to whatever my chronic baseline is.
[00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:40.260]   But if I don't wait, and here's really the key,
[00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:43.160]   if I keep indulging again and again and again,
[00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:48.160]   ultimately I have so much on the pain side, right?
[00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:51.740]   That I've essentially reset my brain to what we call
[00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:56.000]   like an anhedonic or lacking in joy type of state,
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.400]   which is a dopamine deficit state.
[00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:01.800]   So that's really the way in which pain
[00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:05.360]   can become the main driver is because I've indulged so much
[00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:08.480]   in these high reward behaviors or substances
[00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:10.720]   that my brain has had to compensate
[00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:13.240]   by way down-regulating my own dopamine,
[00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:16.400]   such that even when I'm not doing that drug,
[00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:18.040]   I'm in a dopamine deficit state,
[00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:20.000]   which is akin to a clinical depression.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.680]   I have anxiety, irritability, insomnia, dysphoria,
[00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:25.440]   and a lot of mental preoccupation with using again
[00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:26.600]   or getting the drug.
[00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:28.280]   And so that's the piece there.
[00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:32.840]   There's the single use, which easily passes,
[00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:36.800]   but it's the chronic use that can then reset
[00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:38.720]   really our dopamine thresholds.
[00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:41.680]   And then nothing is enjoyable, right?
[00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:45.760]   Then everything sort of pales in comparison to this one drug
[00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:47.040]   that I want to keep doing.
[00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:50.080]   And that one drug could be a person, right?
[00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:52.080]   I mean, I know people in my life
[00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:56.120]   that are still talking about this one relationship,
[00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:58.960]   this one person that was just so great
[00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:01.440]   despite all the challenges of that thing,
[00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:04.280]   that it's almost like they're addicted to the narrative.
[00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:07.840]   They were maybe or still are addicted to the person.
[00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:09.520]   So it could be to any number of things,
[00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:12.420]   video games, sex, gambling, a person, a narrative.
[00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:17.340]   To me, and because of the way you described this mechanism,
[00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:18.860]   this pleasure pain balance,
[00:31:18.860 --> 00:31:24.240]   that all speaks to the kind of generalizability
[00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:26.680]   of our brain circuitry.
[00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:28.840]   And this is something that fascinates me,
[00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:30.400]   and I know it fascinates you as well,
[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:34.400]   which is that nature did not evolve
[00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:35.720]   20 different mechanisms
[00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:38.240]   for 20 different types of addiction.
[00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:41.760]   Just like anxiety is a couple of core sets of hormones
[00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:43.240]   and neurotransmitters and pathways.
[00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:46.800]   And one person is triggered by social interactions,
[00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:50.240]   another person is triggered by spiders,
[00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:52.880]   but the underlying response is identical.
[00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:54.720]   It sounds like with addiction as well,
[00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:56.520]   there may be some nuance,
[00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:59.120]   but that they're sort of a core set of processes.
[00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:01.320]   So it doesn't really matter
[00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:03.360]   if it's gambling or video games or sex
[00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:07.340]   or a narrative about a previous lover or partner or whatever.
[00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:11.100]   It's the same addictive process underneath that.
[00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:11.940]   Is that correct?
[00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:13.280]   - Yes, exactly.
[00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:16.320]   And that's where this whole idea of cross-addiction comes in.
[00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:18.860]   So once you've been addicted to a substance,
[00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:19.880]   severely addicted,
[00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:22.220]   that makes you more vulnerable to addiction
[00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:23.520]   to any substance.
[00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:26.240]   - And when you say substance does the same,
[00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:28.000]   is what you just said also true for behavior?
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.240]   - Yes, so when I use the word drug,
[00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:32.880]   I'm talking about substances and behaviors really.
[00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:36.160]   And I'm talking about behaviors like gambling, sex,
[00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:41.040]   gaming, porn, absolutely, shopping, work.
[00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:43.140]   - You've accused me, just for the record,
[00:32:43.140 --> 00:32:47.020]   Anna, Dr. Lemke has accused me, not accused me,
[00:32:47.020 --> 00:32:50.240]   has diagnosed me outside the clinic
[00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:51.940]   in a playful way of being work addicted.
[00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:53.260]   You're probably right.
[00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:54.860]   The first thoughts I have when I wake up
[00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:56.120]   are typically about work,
[00:32:56.120 --> 00:32:59.240]   certainly within 50 milliseconds or so of waking.
[00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:01.180]   And probably the last thoughts I have,
[00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:02.580]   I would hope are not about work,
[00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:04.280]   but yeah, I work constantly.
[00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:06.080]   I don't, I do other things,
[00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:08.420]   but I have to actively turn that off.
[00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:10.160]   - Yes, that's exactly right.
[00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:12.520]   And you're certainly not alone in that.
[00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:13.360]   And of course-
[00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:14.200]   - At Stanford, no, no, no, no.
[00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:15.680]   - Right, I mean, here in Silicon Valley,
[00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:16.900]   it's highly rewarded, right?
[00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:18.020]   So that kind of addiction.
[00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:20.840]   - It's embedded in the culture, absolutely, yeah.
[00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:22.400]   And there's this other city,
[00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:23.480]   I think it's called New York,
[00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:25.360]   where they also work a lot out here
[00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:26.840]   and it's heavily rewarded.
[00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:30.960]   I once said, and I'm sure
[00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:32.620]   that I'm not the first person to say it,
[00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:34.780]   but I was thinking about addiction
[00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:36.520]   and I was thinking about the underlying circuits
[00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:40.760]   and I posted something to social media,
[00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:43.320]   which said that addiction is a progressive narrowing
[00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:45.240]   of the things that bring you pleasure.
[00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:47.080]   That was the way that I kind of crystallized
[00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:48.000]   the literature in my mind.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.220]   And then we met and you of course came
[00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:52.200]   and gave these amazing lectures
[00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:54.680]   in the neuroanatomy course for the medical students
[00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:56.560]   and the rest is history.
[00:33:56.560 --> 00:34:01.560]   But I tossed out a kind of mirroring statement
[00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:07.540]   for that as well, which was a bit overstepping, I admit,
[00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:10.000]   which I said, "Addiction is a progressive narrowing
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.280]   "of the things that bring you pleasure."
[00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:14.300]   And I said, dare I say,
[00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:16.600]   "Enlightenment is a progressive expansion
[00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:17.960]   "of the things that bring you pleasure."
[00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:20.160]   Not that anybody knows what enlightenment is,
[00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:22.400]   but it was my attempt to take a little bit of a jab
[00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:23.720]   at the fact that nobody knows.
[00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:25.280]   And so why not, why wouldn't I throw
[00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:26.680]   a neurobiological explanation?
[00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:28.800]   Just to kind of sample the waters.
[00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:32.580]   And people had varying levels of response.
[00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:37.260]   But the reason I bring that up is that I would imagine
[00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:41.040]   that being able to derive pleasure from many things
[00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:43.660]   would be a wonderful attribute.
[00:34:43.660 --> 00:34:48.280]   We know people like this that can experience pleasure
[00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:51.180]   in little things and in big events,
[00:34:51.180 --> 00:34:54.200]   not just the big milestones of life,
[00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:59.000]   but also the subtle, like the yogis would say,
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.560]   the subtle ripples of life.
[00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:04.820]   So if such an ability exists,
[00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:06.380]   do you think that that reflects
[00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:09.680]   a healthily tuned dopamine system?
[00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:13.000]   One that can engage and enjoy, but then disengage?
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:14.860]   Is that what we should be seeking?
[00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:18.180]   And to underscore, I know nothing about enlightenment,
[00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:20.140]   meditation, or any of it.
[00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:23.140]   I just, I use these as opportunities to explore.
[00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:26.460]   - Yeah, so it's a great question.
[00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:29.860]   And I understand the question as,
[00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:32.260]   so what should we be striving for, right?
[00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:34.720]   Where should we settle out?
[00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:39.720]   And in my book, I really hold out people in recovery
[00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:44.220]   from severe addiction as sort of modern day profits
[00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:47.140]   for the rest of us, because I do think that people
[00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:50.780]   who have been addicted and then get into recovery
[00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:55.780]   do have a hard-won wisdom that we can all benefit from.
[00:35:56.580 --> 00:36:01.580]   And the wisdom, I guess, you know, to distill it down,
[00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:03.940]   I mean, it's many things.
[00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:08.180]   But in terms of, you know, dopamine,
[00:36:08.180 --> 00:36:13.020]   the wisdom is there are adaptive ways to get your dopamine,
[00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:16.860]   and there are less than adaptive ways.
[00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:21.220]   And in general, you could describe the adaptive ways
[00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:26.220]   as not too potent, so not tipping that balance too hard,
[00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:28.740]   or too fast to the side of pleasure.
[00:36:28.740 --> 00:36:31.320]   - So does that mean never allowing myself
[00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:34.540]   to be absolutely in complete bliss?
[00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:36.200]   Or does it mean not allowing myself
[00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:38.180]   to stay in that state too long?
[00:36:38.180 --> 00:36:40.220]   - The latter, I think the latter.
[00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:42.420]   So, and then that gets to temperament.
[00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:43.660]   So I'm going to get that to a second.
[00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:48.660]   So in general, what we want is some kind of flexibility
[00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:50.740]   in that balance and the ability
[00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:53.220]   to easily reassert homeostasis.
[00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:55.060]   We don't want to break our balance,
[00:36:55.060 --> 00:36:57.320]   which is possible if we overindulge
[00:36:57.320 --> 00:37:00.500]   for enough period of time and end up with a balance tip
[00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:02.660]   to the side of pain, this dopamine deficit state
[00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:03.880]   we've been talking about.
[00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:07.620]   We want a flexible, resilient balance, right?
[00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:09.620]   Which can be sensitive to things going on
[00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:12.300]   in the environment, which can experience pleasure
[00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:16.340]   and approach, which can experience pain and recoil, right?
[00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:19.780]   This is all adaptive and healthy and necessary and good.
[00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:22.740]   We would never want a balance that doesn't tilt, right?
[00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:23.900]   That would be a disaster.
[00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:26.300]   We wouldn't be human and we wouldn't want that.
[00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:28.060]   It'd be really, really boring.
[00:37:28.060 --> 00:37:29.980]   On the other hand, what people in recovery
[00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:33.220]   from addiction talk about is to some extent
[00:37:33.220 --> 00:37:37.740]   having to learn to live with things being a little boring
[00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:39.440]   a lot of the time, right?
[00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:42.500]   So trying to avoid some of this intensity
[00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:46.280]   and thrill seeking and escapism
[00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:49.220]   that really is at the core of addictive tendencies.
[00:37:49.220 --> 00:37:51.700]   - Sorry to interrupt, but when you say boring,
[00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:53.860]   can we add stressful and boring?
[00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:54.700]   - Yes.
[00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:57.380]   - Because there are days where I'm not,
[00:37:57.380 --> 00:37:59.340]   I'm one of these people, I have to remind myself
[00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:02.460]   to have fun because I sort of forgot what the term means
[00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:04.780]   because I like to think that I experience
[00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:06.020]   a lot of pleasure in little things,
[00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:08.140]   but I'm a pretty hard driving guy.
[00:38:08.140 --> 00:38:10.460]   I like goals and big milestones, all that stuff.
[00:38:10.460 --> 00:38:15.460]   Anyway, the point being that many days I'm not bored
[00:38:15.460 --> 00:38:18.380]   thinking, oh, there's nothing to do,
[00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:21.460]   but I am kind of overwhelmed by the number of things
[00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:25.380]   that are really not pleasureful that I have to do.
[00:38:25.380 --> 00:38:26.620]   I won't mention what they are
[00:38:26.620 --> 00:38:29.380]   'cause I don't want my colleagues to be like,
[00:38:29.380 --> 00:38:32.700]   so that's why you don't respond to emails.
[00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:33.840]   No, just your emails.
[00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:36.860]   Not yours, Anna, but theirs.
[00:38:36.860 --> 00:38:40.340]   In any event, so anxiety and boredom
[00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:42.340]   can hang out together, right?
[00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:43.660]   Am I correct in-
[00:38:43.660 --> 00:38:44.500]   - Oh, for sure.
[00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:47.580]   I mean, actually boredom is highly anxiety provoking.
[00:38:47.580 --> 00:38:48.780]   - Okay, that's good to know
[00:38:48.780 --> 00:38:50.020]   'cause I think people hear boredom
[00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:53.060]   and they think like, oh, there's nothing to do here.
[00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:55.820]   I feel like we have a ton to do,
[00:38:55.820 --> 00:38:57.980]   we just don't really want to do it
[00:38:57.980 --> 00:38:59.980]   as opposed to something that we're excited to do.
[00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:02.380]   - Right, okay, so this gets to sort of
[00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:05.260]   some of the core things also we were talking about earlier
[00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:06.540]   about finding your passion.
[00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:08.920]   So I'm going to try to link it all together.
[00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:11.100]   But basically is boredom,
[00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:14.780]   first of all, boredom is a rare experience for modern humans
[00:39:14.780 --> 00:39:17.480]   because we're constantly distracting ourselves
[00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:18.500]   from the present moment
[00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:22.740]   and we have an infinite number of ways to do that, right?
[00:39:22.740 --> 00:39:24.780]   But boredom is really, I think,
[00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:28.260]   an important and necessary experience.
[00:39:28.260 --> 00:39:32.340]   But it is scary because when you allow yourself to be bored,
[00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:33.780]   and let's say you had that list
[00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:34.620]   of all the things you hate to do
[00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:36.600]   and you actually got them all done.
[00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:40.340]   Imagine that and you got your forthcoming book done
[00:39:40.340 --> 00:39:42.860]   and you did all your interviews and then-
[00:39:42.860 --> 00:39:45.180]   - It could happen, lightning could strike.
[00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:47.740]   - And you walked your dog and you cleaned your house
[00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:49.700]   and you went shopping.
[00:39:49.700 --> 00:39:51.060]   Imagine that for a moment.
[00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:53.240]   You would be sitting in your house
[00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:56.620]   and my guess is you would be terrified
[00:39:56.620 --> 00:40:01.060]   because wow, what am I supposed to do now, right?
[00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:03.180]   There's nothing I really have to do.
[00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:05.140]   And that is really, really scary.
[00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:06.780]   That can feel like free fall.
[00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:09.500]   And yet that's really an important
[00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:11.100]   and good experience to have.
[00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:13.880]   And I think that is an experience out of which
[00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:18.020]   we can have a lot of creative initiative,
[00:40:18.020 --> 00:40:20.760]   but also really consider our priorities and values.
[00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:23.620]   Okay, here I am on planet earth.
[00:40:23.620 --> 00:40:26.020]   What the hee-haw am I gonna do with my life?
[00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:27.100]   What do I really care about?
[00:40:27.100 --> 00:40:29.040]   How do I really wanna spend my time
[00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:33.240]   when I'm not distracting myself in order to spend it?
[00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:36.460]   And then this gets back to our conversation
[00:40:36.460 --> 00:40:38.720]   a little bit earlier about finding your passion.
[00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:41.740]   So I think that one of the big problems now
[00:40:41.740 --> 00:40:45.160]   that's very misguided about this idea of finding your passion
[00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:48.000]   it's almost as if people are looking to fit the key
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:51.340]   into the lock of the thing that was meant for them to do.
[00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:52.420]   - Right, and then everything will feel
[00:40:52.420 --> 00:40:53.260]   like a natural progression.
[00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:55.180]   - Right, and then everything will be wonderful.
[00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:57.540]   - I can attest to the fact that is not how it works
[00:40:57.540 --> 00:40:59.080]   in any endeavor. - Yeah, right.
[00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:01.620]   And that you'll have all this great success.
[00:41:01.620 --> 00:41:06.260]   And here's where I really think the answer lies.
[00:41:06.260 --> 00:41:07.840]   And I really, really believe this.
[00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:11.100]   Stop looking for your passion.
[00:41:11.100 --> 00:41:15.500]   And instead look around right where you are.
[00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:18.040]   Stop distracting yourself.
[00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:20.340]   Look around right where you are
[00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:23.380]   and see what needs to be done.
[00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:25.840]   So not what do I want to do,
[00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:28.820]   but what is the work that needs to be done?
[00:41:28.820 --> 00:41:29.640]   And more importantly,
[00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:32.260]   it doesn't have to be some grandiose work.
[00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:35.780]   Like does the garbage need to be taken out, right?
[00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:38.580]   Is there some garbage on your neighbor's lawn
[00:41:38.580 --> 00:41:40.980]   that someone threw there that you could actually bend over
[00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:44.620]   and pick up and put into the garbage can?
[00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:46.500]   Look around you.
[00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:49.580]   There is so much work that needs to be done
[00:41:49.580 --> 00:41:53.460]   that nobody wants to do that is really, really important.
[00:41:53.460 --> 00:41:55.620]   And if we all did that,
[00:41:55.620 --> 00:41:58.140]   I really think the world would be a much better place.
[00:41:58.140 --> 00:42:00.900]   And this is what people who have severe addiction
[00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:02.580]   who get into recovery realize.
[00:42:02.580 --> 00:42:06.460]   They're like, it's not about me and my will
[00:42:06.460 --> 00:42:09.900]   and what I'm going to will in my life or in the world.
[00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:13.220]   It's about looking around what needs to be done.
[00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:17.900]   What is the work that I am called to do in this moment?
[00:42:17.900 --> 00:42:19.960]   Which also is incredibly freeing
[00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:22.700]   because I don't have to search for the perfect thing.
[00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:24.980]   There's a lot of burden now on young people
[00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:26.760]   that they have to find that perfect thing.
[00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:28.220]   And until they've found that perfect thing,
[00:42:28.220 --> 00:42:29.560]   they're going to be miserable.
[00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:31.140]   You don't have to do that.
[00:42:31.140 --> 00:42:32.820]   Look at the life you were given.
[00:42:32.820 --> 00:42:34.580]   Look at the people around you.
[00:42:34.580 --> 00:42:37.860]   Look at the jobs that present themselves to you
[00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:42.860]   and do that job simply and honorably one day at a time
[00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:44.620]   with a kind of humility.
[00:42:44.620 --> 00:42:47.140]   I think this is really what's so striking to me
[00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:49.380]   about the wisdom of people in recovery.
[00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:51.620]   There's this incredible humility
[00:42:51.620 --> 00:42:53.300]   that comes out of that experience.
[00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:55.940]   You feel so broken, so ashamed,
[00:42:55.940 --> 00:42:58.940]   but you pick yourself up one day at a time
[00:42:58.940 --> 00:43:03.500]   and you build a life that's around what can I do
[00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:06.760]   right in this moment that might benefit another person
[00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:09.340]   and thereby benefit me.
[00:43:09.340 --> 00:43:11.900]   - Yeah, it's a really important point.
[00:43:11.900 --> 00:43:14.380]   And if you're willing,
[00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:17.900]   I'd like to actually stay on this issue of passion
[00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:22.900]   because I think the dopamine systems,
[00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:24.900]   if I understand them correctly,
[00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:29.520]   the dopamine systems merge with this work
[00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:30.360]   that you're referring to,
[00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:32.520]   this immediacy of things calling to us
[00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:33.780]   like taking out the trash,
[00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:35.700]   which sounds frankly really boring.
[00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:40.160]   To be honest, I hate taking out the trash, but I do it
[00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:41.240]   'cause I like a clean home
[00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:43.160]   and I like a home that smells good
[00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:46.580]   or at least doesn't smell bad.
[00:43:46.580 --> 00:43:50.200]   So we do these things and not that we want to offer
[00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:54.260]   some larger carrot as a consequence of doing those things,
[00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:56.660]   but if I understand correctly, what you're saying is
[00:43:56.660 --> 00:44:01.320]   in the act of looking at one's immediate environment,
[00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:03.820]   acting on that immediate environment,
[00:44:03.820 --> 00:44:08.820]   we cultivate a relationship to these circuits in our brain
[00:44:08.820 --> 00:44:13.040]   about action and reward that, at least to my mind,
[00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:16.640]   span the range of small things being rewarding
[00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:19.000]   and then lead us to bigger things being rewarding.
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:20.200]   It's not like all we're going to do
[00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:22.280]   is take out trash and tend to house.
[00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:23.640]   We eventually will venture out
[00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:27.440]   and we eventually will find careers and work on those.
[00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:28.420]   But if I understand correctly,
[00:44:28.420 --> 00:44:31.640]   you're talking about getting into a sort of functional
[00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:34.060]   or adaptive action step.
[00:44:34.060 --> 00:44:37.180]   And it's the action step that these days we tend to overlook
[00:44:37.180 --> 00:44:39.860]   because most of our mindset is in things
[00:44:39.860 --> 00:44:43.140]   that are truly outside of our immediate reality.
[00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:44.200]   Do I have that correct?
[00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:45.640]   - Yeah, that was beautifully said.
[00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:47.440]   And I would just add to that.
[00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:50.800]   I see a lot of young people who, for example,
[00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:53.660]   spend most of their waking hours playing video games
[00:44:53.660 --> 00:44:56.860]   and they come to me and they say, "I'm anxious and depressed.
[00:44:56.860 --> 00:44:58.700]   "I'm majoring in computer science.
[00:44:58.700 --> 00:44:59.540]   "I hate it.
[00:44:59.540 --> 00:45:01.220]   "I thought I would like it.
[00:45:01.220 --> 00:45:02.920]   "If I could only find that thing
[00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:06.380]   "that I was really meant to do, my life would be better."
[00:45:06.380 --> 00:45:10.580]   And my first intervention for the many, many people like that
[00:45:10.580 --> 00:45:14.240]   that I see in clinical care is you have it backwards.
[00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:16.000]   I don't say it quite like that.
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:18.780]   You were waiting for that thing to pull you out
[00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:22.160]   of the video game world and you're never going to find it
[00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:24.020]   as long as you're playing video games.
[00:45:24.020 --> 00:45:27.520]   'Cause video games are so powerfully dopaminergic
[00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:31.400]   that you have this distorted sense of really pleasure
[00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:34.380]   and pain and you will not be able to find that thing
[00:45:34.380 --> 00:45:35.280]   that you enjoy.
[00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:37.300]   And so of course the intervention is abstain
[00:45:37.300 --> 00:45:40.120]   from video games, reset your reward pathways,
[00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:42.160]   start with a level balance.
[00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:44.360]   And what invariably happens, and I've just seen it
[00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:47.140]   over 20 years, so many times, I've become really
[00:45:47.140 --> 00:45:49.140]   a believer in this.
[00:45:49.140 --> 00:45:51.920]   All of a sudden it's like, "Oh wow,
[00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:56.000]   "my computer science class is interesting this quarter."
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:58.080]   It's like, "Okay."
[00:45:58.080 --> 00:46:02.560]   You have a receptivity then to experiencing pleasure
[00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:04.920]   and reward in a way you just don't have
[00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:06.980]   when you're bombarding your reward pathways
[00:46:06.980 --> 00:46:08.680]   with these high dopamine drugs.
[00:46:08.680 --> 00:46:10.200]   - Very interesting.
[00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:13.140]   And just to underscore this notion that tending
[00:46:13.140 --> 00:46:16.520]   to the immediate things can lead to super performance.
[00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:20.220]   I may have mentioned it earlier this episode,
[00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:22.800]   but if I didn't, I'll mention now, which is,
[00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:25.240]   I have the great privilege of having some close friends
[00:46:25.240 --> 00:46:26.820]   that were in the SEAL teams and doing some work
[00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:27.660]   with those communities.
[00:46:27.660 --> 00:46:30.200]   And it's a remarkable community for reasons
[00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:31.780]   that I think most people don't understand.
[00:46:31.780 --> 00:46:33.920]   People think they see the images carrying logs
[00:46:33.920 --> 00:46:35.600]   down the beach and all the blowing stuff on,
[00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:38.200]   all the stuff that's fun for guys like that.
[00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:42.260]   But all of the guys I know who are in the SEAL teams
[00:46:42.260 --> 00:46:46.160]   have this sense of duty about immediate things.
[00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:48.720]   And not just holding the door and helping with the dishes
[00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:49.700]   and moving things around.
[00:46:49.700 --> 00:46:52.180]   They are constantly scanning their environment
[00:46:52.180 --> 00:46:53.900]   for what can be done.
[00:46:53.900 --> 00:46:56.960]   They essentially conquer every environment they're in.
[00:46:56.960 --> 00:47:00.780]   They are also some of the most competitive human beings
[00:47:00.780 --> 00:47:01.620]   in the world.
[00:47:01.620 --> 00:47:04.680]   And they do it unless they're in the act of war fighting,
[00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:06.400]   which is their real job.
[00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:10.420]   They do it in every environment in a very benevolent way.
[00:47:10.420 --> 00:47:14.080]   And it's a remarkable thing because I think it's what
[00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:16.340]   is part of what they're selected for.
[00:47:16.340 --> 00:47:18.700]   And there's a range there.
[00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:20.820]   But I think when we hear about tending
[00:47:20.820 --> 00:47:24.080]   to the immediate things or this phrase,
[00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:25.700]   how you do one thing is how you do anything.
[00:47:25.700 --> 00:47:28.000]   That's a tricky one for me because there are certain things
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:29.060]   I just don't do well.
[00:47:29.060 --> 00:47:32.000]   But should we always be trying?
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:36.220]   I think that the tending to setting the horizon in closely
[00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:39.640]   and tending to things in one's immediate environment
[00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:42.060]   I think is very powerful and translates.
[00:47:42.060 --> 00:47:44.320]   Because again, I think the nervous system,
[00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:46.800]   it performs algorithms, it has action steps.
[00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:49.920]   The brain doesn't evolve to do one thing.
[00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:52.660]   It evolves to be able to use the same approach
[00:47:52.660 --> 00:47:53.880]   to doing lots of different things.
[00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:55.160]   - Yes.
[00:47:55.160 --> 00:47:56.880]   I just want to add, so even beyond that,
[00:47:56.880 --> 00:47:58.960]   'cause that totally resonates for me
[00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:01.620]   and is very consistent with people in recovery
[00:48:01.620 --> 00:48:04.880]   from addiction who learn to take it one day at a time,
[00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:09.000]   which is one of the standard lingo from Alcoholics Anonymous
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:10.360]   and other 12 step groups.
[00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:12.560]   But I think also, as you say,
[00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:16.460]   our brain is really wired for the 24 hour period.
[00:48:16.460 --> 00:48:20.960]   We're not very good at sort of the 10 year, 20.
[00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:22.500]   I mean, we have these huge frontal lobes
[00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:24.500]   and yes, we're great planners and we can,
[00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:27.680]   but if we live too much in that space,
[00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:30.540]   we can really get very anxious and depressed and lost
[00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:33.240]   and either catastrophize or get grandiose.
[00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:36.320]   But if you can chunk it down to a day,
[00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:38.260]   what people in recovery talk about
[00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:41.360]   is how if I can just do today right,
[00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:44.420]   then I will get a chain of days
[00:48:44.420 --> 00:48:48.960]   that seem insignificant in their individual units.
[00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:51.780]   But after six months or a year or two years
[00:48:51.780 --> 00:48:55.900]   of those good days, I've got two very good years, right?
[00:48:55.900 --> 00:48:56.880]   And I look back and it's like,
[00:48:56.880 --> 00:48:59.600]   oh wow, I guess I did all that.
[00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:01.800]   But I think that's really one of the keys
[00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:03.400]   is really taking it one day at a time,
[00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:06.160]   which your seals and also this connecting
[00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:07.440]   with the environment, right?
[00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:10.440]   So being awake and alert to your environment
[00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:12.240]   and connecting with your environment,
[00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:13.720]   not trying to escape it.
[00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:16.600]   And of course, escapism is what we all want and desire,
[00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:18.420]   that experience of non-being.
[00:49:18.420 --> 00:49:20.900]   And we get it from the internet or from drugs
[00:49:20.900 --> 00:49:23.940]   or whatever it is, but it's the booby prize
[00:49:23.940 --> 00:49:27.480]   because ultimately it takes you further and further away
[00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:28.560]   from your immediate environment,
[00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:30.780]   which is where we really have to connect
[00:49:30.780 --> 00:49:33.520]   to get that sense of groundedness and authenticity
[00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:36.580]   and like of being in our own lives.
[00:49:36.580 --> 00:49:37.920]   - Well, I think the unit of the day
[00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:40.100]   is something that comes up again and again
[00:49:40.100 --> 00:49:42.640]   of in my discussions with colleagues
[00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:45.200]   who are extremely successful
[00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:47.640]   and who also have balanced lives.
[00:49:47.640 --> 00:49:49.240]   This actually came up in the discussion
[00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:53.880]   with Carl Deisseroth, who is also a successful scientist
[00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:56.920]   and clinician and manages a family, et cetera.
[00:49:56.920 --> 00:49:59.820]   So the unit of the day I think is fundamental
[00:49:59.820 --> 00:50:02.280]   and those stack up as you mentioned.
[00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:05.200]   So along those lines, I've heard you say
[00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:08.480]   that in order to reset the dopamine system,
[00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:12.240]   essentially in order to break an addictive pattern,
[00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:17.240]   to become unaddicted, 30 days of zero interaction
[00:50:17.240 --> 00:50:22.680]   with that substance, that person, et cetera, is that correct?
[00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:25.840]   - Yeah, and 30 days is in my clinical experience,
[00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:28.140]   the average amount of time it takes for the brain
[00:50:28.140 --> 00:50:31.040]   to reset reward pathways for dopamine transmission
[00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:32.760]   to regenerate itself.
[00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:34.740]   There's also a little bit of science
[00:50:34.740 --> 00:50:36.780]   that suggests that that's true.
[00:50:36.780 --> 00:50:39.640]   Some imaging studies showing that our brains
[00:50:39.640 --> 00:50:43.000]   are still in a dopamine deficit state two weeks
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:44.800]   after we've been using our drug.
[00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:47.580]   And then a study by Schuck, Hitt and Brown,
[00:50:47.580 --> 00:50:51.160]   which took a group of depressed men
[00:50:51.160 --> 00:50:53.680]   who also were addicted to alcohol,
[00:50:53.680 --> 00:50:57.420]   put them in a hospital where they had received
[00:50:57.420 --> 00:50:58.440]   no treatment for depression,
[00:50:58.440 --> 00:51:01.160]   but they had no access to alcohol in that time.
[00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:04.640]   And after four weeks, 80% of them no longer met criteria
[00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:06.400]   for major depression.
[00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:10.000]   So again, this idea that by depriving ourselves
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:14.520]   of this high dopamine, high reward substance or behavior,
[00:51:14.520 --> 00:51:17.080]   we allow our brains to regenerate its own dopamine
[00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:18.720]   for the balance to really correlate,
[00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:19.920]   and then we're in a place
[00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:22.600]   where we can sort of enjoy other things.
[00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:24.720]   - So that progressive narrowing
[00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:27.400]   of what brings one pleasure eventually expands.
[00:51:27.400 --> 00:51:30.760]   So I'd like to dissect out that 30 days a little more,
[00:51:30.760 --> 00:51:35.400]   finally, and I also want to address
[00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:38.480]   how does one stop doing something for 30 days
[00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:40.680]   if the thing is a thought?
[00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:43.900]   So we'll kind of put that on the shelf for a moment.
[00:51:43.900 --> 00:51:45.700]   So days one through 10,
[00:51:45.700 --> 00:51:50.080]   I would imagine will be very uncomfortable.
[00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:52.840]   They're going to suck, basically, to be quite honest,
[00:51:52.840 --> 00:51:56.240]   because the way you describe this pleasure pain balance,
[00:51:56.240 --> 00:52:00.240]   to my mind says that if you remove
[00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:02.280]   what little pleasure one is getting,
[00:52:02.280 --> 00:52:05.320]   or a lot of pleasure from engaging in some behavior,
[00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:08.820]   that's gone, the pain system is really ramped up,
[00:52:08.820 --> 00:52:11.680]   and nothing is making me feel good.
[00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:13.240]   I'll just use myself as an example.
[00:52:13.240 --> 00:52:14.720]   I'm not in recovery,
[00:52:14.720 --> 00:52:19.240]   but that 10 days is going to be miserable.
[00:52:19.240 --> 00:52:23.520]   Anxiety, trouble sleeping, physical agitation
[00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:28.360]   into the point where maybe impulsive, angry,
[00:52:28.360 --> 00:52:30.820]   should one expect all of that?
[00:52:30.820 --> 00:52:34.080]   Should the family members of people expect all of that?
[00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:36.240]   - Yeah, so what I say to patients,
[00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:39.160]   and it's a really important piece of this intervention,
[00:52:39.160 --> 00:52:42.720]   is that you will feel worse before you feel better.
[00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:43.560]   - For how long? - Yeah.
[00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:45.680]   - This is probably the first question they ask, right?
[00:52:45.680 --> 00:52:49.080]   - And I say, usually in my clinical experience,
[00:52:49.080 --> 00:52:50.800]   you'll feel worse for two weeks,
[00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:53.600]   but if you can make it through those first two weeks,
[00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:56.240]   the sun will start to come out in week three,
[00:52:56.240 --> 00:52:57.600]   and by week four,
[00:52:57.600 --> 00:53:00.840]   most people are feeling a whole lot better than they were
[00:53:00.840 --> 00:53:03.200]   before they stopped using their substance.
[00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:07.160]   So yeah, you have to, it's a hard thing.
[00:53:07.160 --> 00:53:09.120]   Like you have to sign up for it.
[00:53:09.120 --> 00:53:10.340]   And I will say, obviously,
[00:53:10.340 --> 00:53:12.860]   there are people with addictions that are so severe
[00:53:12.860 --> 00:53:16.040]   that as long as they have access to their drug or behavior,
[00:53:16.040 --> 00:53:17.740]   they're not able to stop themselves.
[00:53:17.740 --> 00:53:20.440]   And that's why we have higher levels of care
[00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:21.740]   or residential treatment.
[00:53:21.740 --> 00:53:24.120]   So this is not going to be for everybody, this intervention,
[00:53:24.120 --> 00:53:26.500]   but it's amazing how many people
[00:53:26.500 --> 00:53:31.320]   with really severe addictions to things like heroin, cocaine,
[00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:33.960]   very severe pornography addictions.
[00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:36.760]   I posit this, and I do it as an experiment.
[00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:39.480]   I said, you know what, let's try this experiment.
[00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:41.220]   I'm always amazed, number one,
[00:53:41.220 --> 00:53:42.400]   how many of them are willing,
[00:53:42.400 --> 00:53:45.020]   and number two, how many of them are actually able to do it?
[00:53:45.020 --> 00:53:46.600]   They are able to do it.
[00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:50.040]   And so that little nudge is sort of just what they need.
[00:53:50.040 --> 00:53:53.160]   And the carrot is, you know,
[00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:54.880]   there's a better life out there for you,
[00:53:54.880 --> 00:53:58.080]   and you'll be able to taste it in a month.
[00:53:58.080 --> 00:54:00.860]   You really will be able to begin to see
[00:54:00.860 --> 00:54:04.200]   that you can feel better and that there's another way.
[00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:09.200]   - So the way you describe it seems like it's hard,
[00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:12.800]   but it's doable for most people, not everybody.
[00:54:12.800 --> 00:54:15.920]   And we'll return to that category of people
[00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:17.600]   who can't do that on their own.
[00:54:17.600 --> 00:54:24.380]   Well, then days 21 through 30, people are feeling better.
[00:54:24.380 --> 00:54:27.900]   The sun is starting to come out, as you mentioned,
[00:54:27.900 --> 00:54:30.420]   which translates in the narrative we've created here.
[00:54:30.420 --> 00:54:32.400]   And supported by biology,
[00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:34.840]   that dopamine is starting to be released
[00:54:34.840 --> 00:54:38.160]   in response to the taste of a really good cup of coffee.
[00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:39.560]   - Yes, exactly.
[00:54:39.560 --> 00:54:44.240]   - Whereas before it was only to insert addictive behavior.
[00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:45.300]   - Right, that's right.
[00:54:45.300 --> 00:54:46.140]   - Whichever it happens to be.
[00:54:46.140 --> 00:54:47.240]   - Of course coffee can be addictive too,
[00:54:47.240 --> 00:54:48.760]   but we'll leave that aside.
[00:54:48.760 --> 00:54:50.360]   - Yeah, I feel like coffee
[00:54:50.360 --> 00:54:54.120]   has a kind of consumption limiting mechanism built in
[00:54:54.120 --> 00:54:58.120]   where at some point you just can't ingest anymore,
[00:54:58.120 --> 00:54:59.380]   but maybe that's wrong.
[00:54:59.380 --> 00:55:03.720]   Sorry to give lift to the caffeine addicts out there
[00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:07.060]   as I clutch my mug.
[00:55:07.060 --> 00:55:09.880]   So days 21 through 30.
[00:55:09.880 --> 00:55:14.280]   I've seen a lot of people go through addiction
[00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:15.240]   and addiction treatment.
[00:55:15.240 --> 00:55:18.360]   I've spent a lot of time in those places actually,
[00:55:18.360 --> 00:55:19.560]   looking at it, researching.
[00:55:19.560 --> 00:55:20.960]   I've got friends in that community.
[00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:22.700]   I'm close with that community.
[00:55:22.700 --> 00:55:26.040]   One thing I've seen over and over again,
[00:55:26.040 --> 00:55:28.360]   sadly, often in the same individuals,
[00:55:28.360 --> 00:55:33.300]   is they get sober from whatever.
[00:55:33.300 --> 00:55:35.060]   They're doing great.
[00:55:35.060 --> 00:55:36.580]   These are people with families.
[00:55:36.580 --> 00:55:39.480]   These are people that you discard your normal image
[00:55:39.480 --> 00:55:44.140]   of an addict and insert the most normal, typical,
[00:55:44.140 --> 00:55:46.140]   whatever healthy person you can imagine.
[00:55:46.140 --> 00:55:49.920]   'Cause a lot of these people you wouldn't know were addicts.
[00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:52.880]   And then all of a sudden you get this call.
[00:55:52.880 --> 00:55:55.800]   So-and-so's back in jail.
[00:55:55.800 --> 00:55:57.840]   So-and-so's wife is going to leave him
[00:55:57.840 --> 00:56:01.080]   because he drank two bottles of wine
[00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:05.160]   and took a Xanax at 7 a.m., crashed his truck into a pole.
[00:56:05.160 --> 00:56:06.400]   He's got two beautiful kids.
[00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:09.600]   How did this happen again?
[00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:12.160]   To the point where by the fourth and fifth time,
[00:56:12.160 --> 00:56:14.680]   people are just done.
[00:56:14.680 --> 00:56:15.960]   I mean, maybe people,
[00:56:15.960 --> 00:56:17.820]   you might be able to detect the frustration in my voice.
[00:56:17.820 --> 00:56:20.080]   I'm dealing with this with somebody that's like,
[00:56:20.080 --> 00:56:22.760]   I don't even know that I want to help this time.
[00:56:22.760 --> 00:56:25.160]   It's been so many times.
[00:56:25.160 --> 00:56:27.520]   To the point where I'm starting to wonder,
[00:56:27.520 --> 00:56:29.520]   is this person just an addict?
[00:56:29.520 --> 00:56:32.680]   This is just kind of what they do and who they are.
[00:56:32.680 --> 00:56:34.460]   And you never want to give up on people,
[00:56:34.460 --> 00:56:37.000]   but, and I'm hanging in there for them,
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:41.740]   but I will say that many people have given up on them.
[00:56:41.740 --> 00:56:44.580]   And so what I'd like to talk about in this context is
[00:56:44.580 --> 00:56:47.960]   what sorts of things help other people
[00:56:47.960 --> 00:56:49.320]   that we know that are addicted?
[00:56:49.320 --> 00:56:51.480]   What really helps?
[00:56:51.480 --> 00:56:56.040]   Not what could help, but what really helps.
[00:56:56.040 --> 00:57:01.040]   And are there certain people for whom it's hopeless?
[00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:03.580]   I mean, I don't like to hold the conversation that way,
[00:57:03.580 --> 00:57:06.240]   but I wouldn't be close to the real life data
[00:57:06.240 --> 00:57:08.520]   if I didn't ask, is it hopeless?
[00:57:08.520 --> 00:57:11.780]   Are there people who just will not be able
[00:57:11.780 --> 00:57:16.200]   to quit their substance use or their addictive behavior,
[00:57:16.200 --> 00:57:19.280]   despite, I have to assume, really wanting to?
[00:57:19.280 --> 00:57:20.160]   - Yeah.
[00:57:20.160 --> 00:57:23.640]   - Yeah, so there are people who will die
[00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:25.520]   of their disease of addiction.
[00:57:25.520 --> 00:57:29.480]   I think conceptualizing it as a disease is a helpful frame.
[00:57:29.480 --> 00:57:31.740]   There are other frames that we could use,
[00:57:31.740 --> 00:57:36.000]   but I do think given the brain physiologic changes
[00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:40.360]   that occur with sustained heavy drug use
[00:57:40.360 --> 00:57:42.800]   and what we know happens to the brain,
[00:57:42.800 --> 00:57:47.160]   it is really reasonable to think of it as a brain disease.
[00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:52.160]   And for me, the real window of, let's say,
[00:57:52.560 --> 00:57:55.960]   being able to access my compassion around people
[00:57:55.960 --> 00:57:57.660]   who are repeat relapses,
[00:57:57.660 --> 00:57:59.720]   even when their life is so much better,
[00:57:59.720 --> 00:58:00.560]   when they're- - Oh, yeah.
[00:58:00.560 --> 00:58:03.080]   - Yeah, it's like a no-brainer, right?
[00:58:03.080 --> 00:58:05.440]   Is to conceptualize this balance
[00:58:05.440 --> 00:58:06.840]   and the dopamine deficit state
[00:58:06.840 --> 00:58:09.840]   and a balance tilted to the side of pain.
[00:58:09.840 --> 00:58:13.120]   And to imagine that for some people,
[00:58:13.120 --> 00:58:16.940]   after a month or six months, or maybe even six years,
[00:58:16.940 --> 00:58:20.140]   their balance is still tipped to the side of pain,
[00:58:20.140 --> 00:58:24.140]   that on some level, that balance has lost its resilience
[00:58:24.140 --> 00:58:26.620]   and its ability to restore homeostasis.
[00:58:26.620 --> 00:58:28.140]   - It's almost like the hinge on that balance
[00:58:28.140 --> 00:58:30.140]   is messed up. - Yes, exactly.
[00:58:30.140 --> 00:58:33.460]   And so, I mean, for someone who's never experienced
[00:58:33.460 --> 00:58:35.060]   addiction like yourself,
[00:58:35.060 --> 00:58:37.420]   maybe one way to conceptualize it is-
[00:58:37.420 --> 00:58:38.360]   - Well, I didn't say that.
[00:58:38.360 --> 00:58:39.200]   - Oh, okay.
[00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:42.900]   - No, I was not, to be clear, I was not referring to myself,
[00:58:42.900 --> 00:58:45.260]   but in this example I was given,
[00:58:45.260 --> 00:58:49.780]   if I were, I would come clean, I would reveal that.
[00:58:49.780 --> 00:58:52.020]   But I think that, especially after hearing
[00:58:52.020 --> 00:58:54.520]   some of your lectures and descriptions
[00:58:54.520 --> 00:58:56.460]   of the range of things that are addictive,
[00:58:56.460 --> 00:58:58.580]   I think I've been fortunate
[00:58:58.580 --> 00:59:00.680]   I don't have a propensity for drugs or alcohol.
[00:59:00.680 --> 00:59:01.520]   - Right, okay.
[00:59:01.520 --> 00:59:04.140]   - I'm lucky in that way that, frankly,
[00:59:04.140 --> 00:59:05.820]   if they remove all the alcohol from the planet,
[00:59:05.820 --> 00:59:07.820]   I'll just be relieved because no one will offer it to me.
[00:59:07.820 --> 00:59:08.660]   - Right, right.
[00:59:08.660 --> 00:59:12.260]   - So don't send me any alcohol, it won't go to me.
[00:59:12.260 --> 00:59:16.360]   But I don't have that,
[00:59:17.560 --> 00:59:20.280]   I like to think I have the compassion,
[00:59:20.280 --> 00:59:25.080]   but I don't have that empathy for
[00:59:25.080 --> 00:59:29.620]   taking a really good situation
[00:59:29.620 --> 00:59:33.000]   and what from the outside looks to be throwing it
[00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:33.840]   in the trash. - Right, right.
[00:59:33.840 --> 00:59:35.400]   Yeah, so okay, so is that let me,
[00:59:35.400 --> 00:59:36.920]   and this is really, I think, important
[00:59:36.920 --> 00:59:40.980]   because I also had to come to an understanding of this
[00:59:40.980 --> 00:59:43.520]   and I feel that I have in my 20 years
[00:59:43.520 --> 00:59:45.060]   of seeing these patients.
[00:59:45.060 --> 00:59:47.220]   And of course, addiction is a spectrum disease, right?
[00:59:47.220 --> 00:59:49.420]   And so you've got the severe end of things.
[00:59:49.420 --> 00:59:54.840]   Imagine that you had an itch somewhere on your body, okay?
[00:59:54.840 --> 00:59:56.500]   And it was, I mean, we've all had that,
[00:59:56.500 --> 00:59:59.980]   like whatever the source, it was super, super itchy.
[00:59:59.980 --> 01:00:03.900]   You can go for, if you really focus,
[01:00:03.900 --> 01:00:06.860]   you could go for a pretty good amount of time
[01:00:06.860 --> 01:00:08.260]   not scratching it.
[01:00:08.260 --> 01:00:12.660]   But the moment you stopped focusing on not scratching it,
[01:00:12.660 --> 01:00:13.500]   you would scratch it.
[01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:16.340]   And maybe you do it while you were asleep, right?
[01:00:16.340 --> 01:00:21.340]   And that is what happens to people with severe addiction.
[01:00:21.340 --> 01:00:24.380]   That balance is essentially broken.
[01:00:24.380 --> 01:00:26.380]   Homeostasis does not get restored
[01:00:26.380 --> 01:00:28.900]   despite sustained abstinence.
[01:00:28.900 --> 01:00:33.380]   They're living with that constant specter of that pull.
[01:00:33.380 --> 01:00:35.080]   It never goes away.
[01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:36.740]   So let me say there are lots of people with addiction
[01:00:36.740 --> 01:00:37.940]   for whom that does go away.
[01:00:37.940 --> 01:00:40.260]   And it goes away at four weeks for many of them.
[01:00:40.260 --> 01:00:45.260]   But in severe cases, that's always there and it's lingering.
[01:00:45.300 --> 01:00:49.100]   And it's the moment when they're not focusing on not using,
[01:00:49.100 --> 01:00:50.140]   it's like a reflex.
[01:00:50.140 --> 01:00:51.880]   They fall back into it.
[01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:53.140]   It's not purposeful.
[01:00:53.140 --> 01:00:55.200]   It's not because they want to get high.
[01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:57.020]   It's not because they value using drugs
[01:00:57.020 --> 01:00:58.600]   more than they do their family.
[01:00:58.600 --> 01:00:59.440]   None of that.
[01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:04.440]   It's that really they cannot not do it
[01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:07.540]   when given the opportunity and that moment
[01:01:07.540 --> 01:01:08.900]   when they're not thinking about it.
[01:01:08.900 --> 01:01:09.740]   Does that make sense?
[01:01:09.740 --> 01:01:10.820]   - That's a great description.
[01:01:10.820 --> 01:01:12.420]   And actually in that description,
[01:01:12.420 --> 01:01:16.860]   I can feel a bit of empathy because the way you describe
[01:01:16.860 --> 01:01:18.460]   scratching an itch in your sleep,
[01:01:18.460 --> 01:01:21.020]   I've done that with mosquito bites.
[01:01:21.020 --> 01:01:22.340]   In summer, you're scratching and you're like,
[01:01:22.340 --> 01:01:26.300]   oh, you wake up scratching that mosquito bite.
[01:01:26.300 --> 01:01:31.300]   And I also have to admit that I've experienced
[01:01:31.300 --> 01:01:33.580]   not feeling like I want to pick up my phone
[01:01:33.580 --> 01:01:36.780]   because it's so rewarding, but just finding myself doing it.
[01:01:36.780 --> 01:01:37.620]   - Yes, of course.
[01:01:37.620 --> 01:01:38.700]   - Like I'm not going to use this thing.
[01:01:38.700 --> 01:01:40.140]   I'm not going to use this thing.
[01:01:40.140 --> 01:01:41.620]   And then just finding myself doing it.
[01:01:41.620 --> 01:01:43.020]   Like, what am I doing here?
[01:01:43.020 --> 01:01:45.780]   Sort of the, how did I get back here again?
[01:01:45.780 --> 01:01:49.400]   And I know enough about brain function to understand
[01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:53.460]   that we have circuits that generate deliberate behavior
[01:01:53.460 --> 01:01:55.500]   and we have circuits that generate reflexive behavior.
[01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:58.340]   And one of the goals of the nervous system
[01:01:58.340 --> 01:02:01.080]   is to make the deliberate stuff reflexive
[01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:02.380]   so you don't have to make the decision
[01:02:02.380 --> 01:02:06.180]   because decision-making is a very costly thing to do.
[01:02:06.180 --> 01:02:08.300]   Decision-making of any kind.
[01:02:08.300 --> 01:02:09.760]   So that does really help.
[01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:15.160]   And the, I want to just try and weave together
[01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:20.160]   this dopamine puzzle, however, because if by week,
[01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:25.560]   so first phase of this 30 or 40 day detox,
[01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:28.000]   it's like a dopamine fast, right?
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.480]   Okay, first 10 days are miserable.
[01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:32.980]   Middle 10 days, the clouds are out.
[01:02:32.980 --> 01:02:35.080]   There may be some shards of sunlight coming through
[01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:38.040]   and then all of a sudden sun starts to come out.
[01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:39.720]   It gets brighter and brighter.
[01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:42.640]   Why is it then that people will relapse,
[01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:44.920]   not just after getting fired from a job
[01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:45.880]   or their spouse leaving them,
[01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:48.040]   but when things are going really well?
[01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:50.680]   Is it this unconscious mechanism?
[01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:53.960]   'Cause I've seen this before is they have a great win.
[01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:57.680]   I have a friend who's a really impressive creative.
[01:02:57.680 --> 01:03:00.400]   I don't want to reveal any more than that,
[01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:05.340]   and relapsed upon getting another really terrific opportunity
[01:03:05.340 --> 01:03:07.640]   to create for the entire world.
[01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:09.160]   And I was like, how can that happen?
[01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:10.440]   But now I'm beginning to wonder,
[01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:13.160]   was it the dopamine associated with that win
[01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:16.720]   that opened the spigot on this dopamine system?
[01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:19.340]   Because it happened in a phase
[01:03:19.340 --> 01:03:22.240]   of a really great stretch of life.
[01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:23.860]   - Yeah, right.
[01:03:23.860 --> 01:03:27.640]   Yeah, so you raised that great point about triggers, right?
[01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:30.880]   And triggers are things that make us want
[01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:32.960]   to go back to using our drug.
[01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:35.300]   And the key thing about triggers, whatever they are,
[01:03:35.300 --> 01:03:39.020]   is they also release a little bit of dopamine, right?
[01:03:39.020 --> 01:03:43.260]   So just thinking about whatever the trigger is
[01:03:43.260 --> 01:03:45.200]   that we associate with drug use,
[01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:47.200]   or just thinking about drug use,
[01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:50.000]   can already release this anticipatory dopamine,
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:51.180]   this new little mini spike.
[01:03:51.180 --> 01:03:53.680]   But here's the part that I think is really fascinating.
[01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:57.200]   That mini spike is followed by a mini deficit state.
[01:03:57.200 --> 01:03:59.760]   So it goes up and then it doesn't go back down to baseline.
[01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:02.520]   It goes below baseline tonic levels,
[01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:04.440]   and that's craving, right?
[01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:08.520]   So that anticipation is immediately followed
[01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:11.140]   by wanting the drug.
[01:04:11.140 --> 01:04:12.860]   And it's that dopamine deficit state
[01:04:12.860 --> 01:04:16.760]   that drives the motivation to go and get the drug.
[01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:18.020]   So many people talk about dopamine
[01:04:18.020 --> 01:04:19.580]   as not really about pleasure,
[01:04:19.580 --> 01:04:22.180]   but about wanting and about motivation.
[01:04:22.180 --> 01:04:24.420]   And so it is that deficit state
[01:04:24.420 --> 01:04:27.280]   that then drives the locomotion to get it.
[01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:29.140]   - And earlier, your description of dopamine
[01:04:29.140 --> 01:04:31.340]   being involved in the desire for more,
[01:04:31.340 --> 01:04:33.540]   giving the sense of reward, but also movement.
[01:04:33.540 --> 01:04:34.380]   - Right.
[01:04:34.380 --> 01:04:35.300]   - I have to assume that those things
[01:04:35.300 --> 01:04:37.400]   are braided together in our nervous system
[01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:41.000]   for the specific intention of when you feel something good,
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.680]   then you feel the pain, maybe you don't notice it.
[01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:44.580]   And then the next thing you know,
[01:04:44.580 --> 01:04:46.520]   you're pursuing more of the thing that you're looking for.
[01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:48.240]   - And I love the way you use the word braided together.
[01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:49.080]   That's beautiful.
[01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:50.800]   And let me also just say something
[01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:54.200]   that I find also fascinating in my work with patients,
[01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:55.620]   and I see this all the time.
[01:04:55.620 --> 01:04:59.000]   There are people for whom bad life experiences,
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:03.540]   loss in any form, stress in many different forms,
[01:05:03.540 --> 01:05:04.380]   that's a trigger.
[01:05:04.380 --> 01:05:07.420]   But there are absolutely people for whom
[01:05:07.420 --> 01:05:09.920]   the trigger is things going well.
[01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:11.700]   And the things going well
[01:05:11.700 --> 01:05:13.580]   can be like the reward of the things going well,
[01:05:13.580 --> 01:05:15.500]   but very often what it is
[01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:18.600]   is the removal of the hypervigilant state
[01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:21.380]   that's required to keep their use in check.
[01:05:21.380 --> 01:05:24.620]   So it's this sense of, I wanna celebrate,
[01:05:24.620 --> 01:05:26.820]   or I wanna, this reward happened,
[01:05:26.820 --> 01:05:29.380]   I wanna put more reward on there.
[01:05:29.380 --> 01:05:31.200]   And it's really, really fascinating
[01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:34.120]   because when people come to that realization
[01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:35.520]   about themselves,
[01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:40.020]   that they're most vulnerable when things are going well,
[01:05:40.020 --> 01:05:41.820]   that's really a valuable insight
[01:05:41.820 --> 01:05:43.840]   because then they can put some things in place
[01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:46.160]   or barriers in place or go to more meetings
[01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:50.320]   or whatever it is that they do to protect themselves.
[01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:53.880]   - Along those lines, I have a friend, 40 years sober,
[01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:56.020]   who was a severe drug and alcohol addict
[01:05:56.020 --> 01:05:58.020]   from a very young age, a really impressive person,
[01:05:58.020 --> 01:06:00.960]   does a lot of important work in the kind of at-risk
[01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:02.800]   youth community out in Hawaii.
[01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:03.840]   And he said something to me.
[01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:06.980]   He said, as former addicts often do,
[01:06:06.980 --> 01:06:09.300]   they got these great sayings,
[01:06:09.300 --> 01:06:11.220]   but I think it fits very well with what you're describing.
[01:06:11.220 --> 01:06:14.360]   He said, "No matter how far you drive,
[01:06:14.360 --> 01:06:17.300]   you're always the same distance from the ditch."
[01:06:17.300 --> 01:06:19.860]   And I said, "Well, that's kind of depressing."
[01:06:19.860 --> 01:06:23.060]   And he said, "No, that's actually what gives me peace."
[01:06:23.060 --> 01:06:25.680]   Because what would happen is for so many years
[01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:30.140]   of relapsing and relapsing and recovering and relapsing,
[01:06:30.140 --> 01:06:33.220]   he felt like it was hopeless.
[01:06:33.220 --> 01:06:36.800]   And then somehow conceptualizing that the vigilance
[01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:41.620]   can never go away instead of making him feel burdened,
[01:06:41.620 --> 01:06:43.000]   it made him feel relieved.
[01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:46.080]   So I often think about that statement,
[01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:47.280]   no matter how far you drive,
[01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:48.840]   you're always the same distance from the ditch.
[01:06:48.840 --> 01:06:50.680]   Because in my mind, I conceptualize that as,
[01:06:50.680 --> 01:06:53.740]   gosh, that's a tough way to drive down the road.
[01:06:53.740 --> 01:06:57.400]   But actually on a road where you know where the ditch is
[01:06:57.400 --> 01:06:59.240]   and where you know where the lane lines are,
[01:06:59.240 --> 01:07:00.960]   it's actually a pretty nice drive.
[01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:02.560]   It's when you don't know where the shoulder is
[01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:04.220]   that you constantly have to be looking around.
[01:07:04.220 --> 01:07:07.700]   So there's this, we're speaking now in analogies
[01:07:07.700 --> 01:07:11.400]   and imagery and science.
[01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:14.280]   But one of the things I find so incredible
[01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:16.280]   about this community of 12-step,
[01:07:16.280 --> 01:07:18.720]   and there are a variety of them,
[01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:22.380]   are the communities that they create for themselves
[01:07:22.380 --> 01:07:24.760]   and some of these sayings,
[01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:27.220]   which I do believe link back
[01:07:27.220 --> 01:07:29.080]   to really core biological mechanisms.
[01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:30.320]   - Yes, yes.
[01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:32.440]   - I do want to ask about those communities.
[01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:36.680]   I have a question which might be a little bit controversial.
[01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:37.520]   - Great.
[01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:38.360]   - Which is,
[01:07:38.360 --> 01:07:42.960]   is it possible that people who were addicted to drugs
[01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:46.000]   or alcohol or some gambling or some other behavior
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:49.160]   get addicted to the addiction community?
[01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:53.440]   Because one thing that I think I observe over and over
[01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:56.520]   is that there's some circuit in the brain of human beings
[01:07:56.520 --> 01:07:59.080]   that has to tell you about the dream
[01:07:59.080 --> 01:08:01.280]   they had the night before, for whatever reason.
[01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:02.540]   [laughing]
[01:08:02.540 --> 01:08:06.120]   There's another circuit that leads people to wake you up
[01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:07.440]   if they themselves can't sleep.
[01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:08.900]   I don't know what the circuit is.
[01:08:08.900 --> 01:08:10.320]   I'm being facetious here.
[01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:13.080]   But there does seem to also be a circuit
[01:08:13.080 --> 01:08:16.360]   in the brain of addicts to discuss
[01:08:16.360 --> 01:08:21.360]   and want to kind of talk about their recovery a lot.
[01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:23.880]   And I mentioned this not to poke at them,
[01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:25.280]   but rather the opposite,
[01:08:25.280 --> 01:08:29.120]   because I think that one thing that is challenging,
[01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:30.720]   at least for me and having friends
[01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:33.540]   that have a propensity for drug or alcohol addiction,
[01:08:33.540 --> 01:08:35.480]   not all of them, but certainly some of them,
[01:08:35.480 --> 01:08:37.480]   is when they're talking about their recovery,
[01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:40.760]   I feel like it's all they talk about.
[01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:42.760]   This meeting, that meeting, that meeting.
[01:08:42.760 --> 01:08:46.920]   How are we, so what I'm really asking here is,
[01:08:46.920 --> 01:08:51.520]   is that some, can we become addicted to sobriety?
[01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:53.680]   - Right.
[01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:55.460]   So this is a great question.
[01:08:55.460 --> 01:08:56.960]   And it links into some of the other things
[01:08:56.960 --> 01:08:59.640]   we've been talking about having to do with
[01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:01.620]   where do we settle out?
[01:09:01.620 --> 01:09:04.520]   What is the way to live between pleasure and pain?
[01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:07.140]   And I implied earlier that ultimately
[01:09:07.140 --> 01:09:08.620]   we want a resilient balance
[01:09:08.620 --> 01:09:10.200]   that's sensitive to pleasure and pain,
[01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:14.240]   but that can easily restore homeostasis after we indulge,
[01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:16.220]   even when we indulge greatly.
[01:09:16.220 --> 01:09:18.880]   But the truth of the matter is that
[01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:21.560]   people with severe addiction, I believe,
[01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:25.200]   temperamentally want those extremes.
[01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:28.480]   And they're wired for that kind of intensity
[01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:31.360]   that is more than just these slight adjustments
[01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:32.500]   around the fulcrum, right?
[01:09:32.500 --> 01:09:35.160]   It's like, they want the big highs and the big lows.
[01:09:35.160 --> 01:09:36.520]   - They'll say, "Great meeting."
[01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:37.360]   - Yeah, right.
[01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:38.180]   - They're like, "That was such an amazing meeting."
[01:09:38.180 --> 01:09:41.360]   Or they find a group, they find a group in a location.
[01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:43.920]   Like we see, this is almost an inside joke
[01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:44.740]   in those communities.
[01:09:44.740 --> 01:09:45.800]   Again, I'm not reporting,
[01:09:45.800 --> 01:09:47.360]   I'm not talking about a "friend" in quotes,
[01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:48.400]   this isn't me reporting.
[01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:52.120]   Well, they'll talk about how attractive people are
[01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:54.720]   at a given meeting or how bonded they feel
[01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:55.840]   to people at a given meeting,
[01:09:55.840 --> 01:09:59.360]   that the meetings themselves become their own form
[01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:00.600]   of dopamine hit.
[01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:01.440]   - Yes, yes.
[01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:02.880]   - And again, I'm not being disparaging,
[01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:04.840]   I just, I want to understand this.
[01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:08.480]   - Right, so yes, so a lot of times patients will say to me,
[01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:11.160]   "Oh, you know, I don't want to go to AA, it's a cult."
[01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:12.860]   And my response to that is,
[01:10:12.860 --> 01:10:18.560]   because it's a cult is exactly why it works, okay?
[01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:21.900]   Because yes, it is much better for you
[01:10:21.900 --> 01:10:24.800]   to be addicted to AA and to recovery
[01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:28.440]   than almost any other addiction I could think of.
[01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:30.260]   And we know from Rob Malenka's work,
[01:10:30.260 --> 01:10:31.640]   who's here at Stanford,
[01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:35.520]   that oxytocin is the hormone that's involved
[01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:39.920]   in human pair bonding and relationships and love.
[01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:42.520]   And it directly links to dopamine neurons
[01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:44.000]   and causes the release of dopamine.
[01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.680]   So yes, when we connect with other humans,
[01:10:46.680 --> 01:10:49.460]   especially in a kind of transcendent spiritual way,
[01:10:49.460 --> 01:10:51.000]   that's a huge dopamine hit.
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.960]   And it does replace the dopamine that people get from drugs.
[01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:58.400]   And for people who have this addiction temperament,
[01:10:58.400 --> 01:11:00.760]   they need it on a more intense level.
[01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:03.880]   They're not going to be generally satisfied
[01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:08.160]   with kind of, you know, a sort of acquaintanceship, right?
[01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:11.900]   They want that intensity of the intimacy that you get
[01:11:11.900 --> 01:11:15.080]   with people when you're cathartically exposing,
[01:11:15.080 --> 01:11:16.560]   you know, warts and all.
[01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:19.160]   So yes, people can get addicted to recovery
[01:11:19.160 --> 01:11:22.400]   and good for them, go for it, you know?
[01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:25.560]   And of course, this can be disruptive for friendships
[01:11:25.560 --> 01:11:28.600]   and relationships where the one person is not in recovery.
[01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:30.280]   Like you're going to so many meetings,
[01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:31.960]   you're always talking about recovery, but you know what?
[01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:34.500]   Much better than them being intoxicated, right?
[01:11:34.500 --> 01:11:37.000]   I mean, so although you may tire of your friends
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000]   talking about their, you know, meetings all the time,
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:40.880]   I'm sure you would rather have them do that
[01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:43.040]   than, you know, be in their addiction.
[01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:44.280]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[01:11:44.280 --> 01:11:46.360]   And this is now the second time you've done this
[01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:48.380]   during this discussion, but now I have empathy
[01:11:48.380 --> 01:11:51.240]   because the way you describe their enthusiasm
[01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:54.320]   about meetings is probably the way that people feel
[01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:57.880]   about me and your work and in neuroscience.
[01:11:57.880 --> 01:12:00.880]   I mean, I've been getting up in front of the class
[01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:02.360]   since I was eight years old
[01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:04.160]   and talking about things I read over the weekend.
[01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:07.440]   Now I just happen to have this thing called a podcast.
[01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:08.400]   I've been doing it since I was little,
[01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:11.080]   and it annoys a lot of people, right?
[01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:12.680]   I've learned to suppress it a little bit.
[01:12:12.680 --> 01:12:16.520]   Some people like it, but I'm poking fun at myself
[01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:20.080]   just to say that I now can understand
[01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:21.760]   that the way I feel about their reports
[01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:23.640]   about yet another amazing meeting,
[01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:27.560]   or for, there's a different form of this,
[01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:29.560]   but there are some people for which
[01:12:29.560 --> 01:12:32.080]   they just love intense experiences.
[01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:35.160]   They're always like trying to pull me off to Bali
[01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:37.560]   because they're talking about how sensual it is all the time.
[01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:39.100]   I'm sure Bali's wonderful,
[01:12:39.100 --> 01:12:41.180]   but there's this kind of ratcheting up.
[01:12:41.180 --> 01:12:43.900]   It's like seeking Burning Man all year long.
[01:12:43.900 --> 01:12:44.880]   I've never been to Burning Man,
[01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:46.440]   no desire to go to Burning Man.
[01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:51.360]   But inside of academia,
[01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:54.320]   I mean, if I were to just turn the mirror at myself,
[01:12:54.320 --> 01:12:58.600]   inside of academia or here in Silicon Valley, work,
[01:12:58.600 --> 01:13:01.680]   and the pursuit of more success,
[01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:04.500]   even if money is kind of divorced from that,
[01:13:04.500 --> 01:13:05.800]   sometimes it is, sometimes it isn't,
[01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:09.640]   academic work is for sake of pursuit of knowledge.
[01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:12.000]   It sounds to me like the same mechanism.
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:16.280]   In fact, it feels to me very much like the same mechanism.
[01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:18.240]   - So Andrew, here's what I love about you.
[01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:21.120]   First of all, you're willing to bring your own flaws
[01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:22.560]   and foibles to this conversation.
[01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:23.760]   - Well, they're everywhere.
[01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:26.720]   - Well, you know what, it's wonderful.
[01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:29.280]   And then you're really open and curious
[01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:31.220]   and wanting to understand,
[01:13:31.220 --> 01:13:33.560]   'cause I can't tell you how many people I have met
[01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:37.080]   who really see addiction as some kind of otherness,
[01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:39.840]   but the truth is we're all wired for addiction.
[01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:41.400]   And if you're not addicted yet,
[01:13:41.400 --> 01:13:43.400]   it's just, it's right around the corner.
[01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:44.500]   Do you know what I mean?
[01:13:44.500 --> 01:13:47.780]   Especially with the incredible panoply of new drugs
[01:13:47.780 --> 01:13:49.780]   and behaviors that are out there.
[01:13:49.780 --> 01:13:53.200]   So I love that you're willing to take a moment
[01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:55.660]   and really try to understand this
[01:13:55.660 --> 01:13:58.400]   because it is, we can all relate
[01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:00.000]   and you're relating it to your,
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:03.780]   essentially your work addiction is right and apt.
[01:14:03.780 --> 01:14:05.440]   You just happen to be addicted to something
[01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:07.940]   that is really socially rewarded.
[01:14:07.940 --> 01:14:10.020]   You know, you figured that out at an early age.
[01:14:10.020 --> 01:14:12.840]   Oh, when I do X, Y, and Z, all these people go,
[01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:15.360]   look at that smart kid or whatever it is, you know.
[01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:16.880]   - For me, it made me feel safe.
[01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:17.720]   - Okay.
[01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:21.900]   - I felt like, yeah, I just felt like this,
[01:14:21.900 --> 01:14:24.600]   and I paused there 'cause it's like, it's like peace.
[01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:27.560]   I'm like, I can relax for a moment.
[01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:28.980]   - When you're talking about neuroscience.
[01:14:28.980 --> 01:14:33.040]   - No, or just when I feel like I'm on the right path
[01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:34.200]   and I'm onto something,
[01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:36.840]   or if I see something that I'm excited about,
[01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:41.020]   I'm like, I feel filled with, it must be dopamine.
[01:14:41.020 --> 01:14:44.420]   I feel flooded with pleasure, literally from head to toe.
[01:14:44.420 --> 01:14:46.420]   And then my next thought is more.
[01:14:46.980 --> 01:14:47.820]   [laughing]
[01:14:47.820 --> 01:14:51.220]   - So true, you're a true addict, you are.
[01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:53.340]   You are, but you just got really,
[01:14:53.340 --> 01:14:55.660]   you really got lucky with the fact
[01:14:55.660 --> 01:15:00.660]   that what you're drawn to is adaptive essentially, you know.
[01:15:00.660 --> 01:15:04.180]   And then your challenge is going to be
[01:15:04.180 --> 01:15:06.340]   that your life doesn't get too out of balance
[01:15:06.340 --> 01:15:08.800]   in the sense that you're 24/7 work
[01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:11.800]   and you don't stop and do some other things
[01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:12.640]   or think about it.
[01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:15.140]   - And my life admittedly is somewhat asymmetric.
[01:15:15.140 --> 01:15:17.300]   I mean, it has other components of physical health, et cetera,
[01:15:17.300 --> 01:15:21.660]   but it is somewhat asymmetric, which is why I got a dog.
[01:15:21.660 --> 01:15:24.420]   Although I talk about him an awful lot, so.
[01:15:24.420 --> 01:15:27.180]   - But the dog is good because that draws you out of yourself
[01:15:27.180 --> 01:15:28.700]   and a little bit away from the work.
[01:15:28.700 --> 01:15:30.820]   But again, you know, I think the key here is
[01:15:30.820 --> 01:15:31.940]   for people who feel like they don't,
[01:15:31.940 --> 01:15:33.140]   they've never experienced addiction
[01:15:33.140 --> 01:15:34.500]   or they don't know anybody with addiction,
[01:15:34.500 --> 01:15:35.980]   or if they do, they don't get it.
[01:15:35.980 --> 01:15:38.160]   Just think of that one thing
[01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:41.100]   that is the most important thing in your life that you do
[01:15:41.100 --> 01:15:43.460]   that gives you pleasure and meaning and purpose.
[01:15:43.460 --> 01:15:46.080]   And then imagine if you couldn't do it.
[01:15:46.080 --> 01:15:47.740]   - Oh yeah, let's not talk about that.
[01:15:47.740 --> 01:15:50.120]   [both laughing]
[01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:51.300]   - Right.
[01:15:51.300 --> 01:15:53.020]   - Well, I appreciate the feedback
[01:15:53.020 --> 01:15:54.880]   and you can send me a bill at the end.
[01:15:54.880 --> 01:16:01.280]   What is the most ridiculous sounding addiction
[01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:04.060]   that you've ever witnessed
[01:16:04.060 --> 01:16:07.340]   that was actually a real addiction along these lines?
[01:16:07.340 --> 01:16:11.900]   Because I think we all know the standard heroin pill.
[01:16:11.900 --> 01:16:13.900]   You've been very, I should mention,
[01:16:13.900 --> 01:16:16.660]   because it's important in your previous book,
[01:16:16.660 --> 01:16:18.860]   and we will probably have a link to that as well,
[01:16:18.860 --> 01:16:20.580]   focused on the opioid crisis
[01:16:20.580 --> 01:16:23.980]   and what we thought was medication
[01:16:23.980 --> 01:16:26.740]   turned out to be just as bad, if not worse,
[01:16:26.740 --> 01:16:29.380]   than a lot of so-called street drugs.
[01:16:29.380 --> 01:16:31.300]   So we understand those, you know,
[01:16:31.300 --> 01:16:33.340]   gambling, sex addiction, porn addiction.
[01:16:33.340 --> 01:16:35.660]   Now, video games, we'll talk about social media
[01:16:35.660 --> 01:16:40.060]   a little bit more in depth, but what's the most like, wow,
[01:16:40.060 --> 01:16:42.920]   I didn't realize people could get addicted to that.
[01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:45.420]   - Water.
[01:16:45.420 --> 01:16:46.980]   - Really?
[01:16:46.980 --> 01:16:49.940]   - Really, so I had a very lovely patient
[01:16:49.940 --> 01:16:52.860]   who had a severe alcohol addiction,
[01:16:52.860 --> 01:16:56.660]   and she got into recovery from her alcohol addiction
[01:16:56.660 --> 01:17:00.980]   for many years, but she kind of had a sort of a polydipsia
[01:17:00.980 --> 01:17:04.420]   or an urge to be drinking something a lot.
[01:17:04.420 --> 01:17:08.620]   And so she drank a lot of water and slowly over time,
[01:17:08.620 --> 01:17:10.860]   she realized that if she drank enough water,
[01:17:10.860 --> 01:17:13.680]   she could become hyponatremic and delirious
[01:17:13.680 --> 01:17:14.940]   and be out of herself.
[01:17:14.940 --> 01:17:15.780]   - You can die from it, right?
[01:17:15.780 --> 01:17:17.660]   - Right, which is, she just wanted
[01:17:17.660 --> 01:17:19.220]   to be out of her own head.
[01:17:19.220 --> 01:17:23.500]   And so she would periodically intentionally overdose
[01:17:23.500 --> 01:17:28.500]   on water in order to, I know it was so sad, so sad.
[01:17:28.500 --> 01:17:30.900]   - What happened to her?
[01:17:30.900 --> 01:17:33.020]   - She eventually took her own life.
[01:17:33.020 --> 01:17:34.180]   - Wow. - Yeah, it was really.
[01:17:34.180 --> 01:17:35.020]   - That's rough.
[01:17:35.020 --> 01:17:37.580]   - She was a lovely woman, she was so bright,
[01:17:37.580 --> 01:17:40.020]   she had so many interests and passions,
[01:17:40.020 --> 01:17:44.640]   and of course it was very sad when she died.
[01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:48.740]   But that was a wow to me, it was like, wow,
[01:17:48.740 --> 01:17:51.140]   if you have this disease of addiction,
[01:17:51.140 --> 01:17:53.020]   you can even get addicted to water.
[01:17:53.020 --> 01:17:55.280]   - Wow, and I think it just underscores
[01:17:55.280 --> 01:17:58.540]   the generalizability of these circuits.
[01:17:58.540 --> 01:17:59.380]   - Right.
[01:17:59.380 --> 01:18:01.500]   - There isn't a brain circuit for addiction to water
[01:18:01.500 --> 01:18:02.460]   that she happened to have,
[01:18:02.460 --> 01:18:04.660]   there's a brain circuit for pleasure and pain
[01:18:04.660 --> 01:18:08.260]   and addiction and water plugged into that circuit.
[01:18:08.260 --> 01:18:09.320]   - Right, right.
[01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:11.240]   - Wow, that's intense.
[01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:14.620]   In your book, "Dopamine Nation,"
[01:18:14.620 --> 01:18:19.420]   you also describe some amazing paths to recovery.
[01:18:19.420 --> 01:18:23.900]   People that, you know, from reading it,
[01:18:23.900 --> 01:18:25.740]   I won't say which ones and who,
[01:18:25.740 --> 01:18:28.100]   'cause there's some great surprises in the book too,
[01:18:28.100 --> 01:18:32.420]   both tragic and triumphant, as they say.
[01:18:32.420 --> 01:18:35.660]   You've often described your patients as your heroes.
[01:18:35.660 --> 01:18:36.500]   - Yeah.
[01:18:36.500 --> 01:18:38.180]   - Yeah, tell us a little bit more about that.
[01:18:38.180 --> 01:18:41.420]   - You know, when you think about how hard it is
[01:18:41.420 --> 01:18:44.220]   to give up a drug or a behavior that you're addicted to,
[01:18:44.220 --> 01:18:45.980]   how much courage that takes,
[01:18:45.980 --> 01:18:49.660]   and fortitude and discipline and stick-to-itiveness,
[01:18:49.660 --> 01:18:52.540]   these people are really amazing people.
[01:18:52.540 --> 01:18:55.640]   I mean, that's, I don't know that I could do it,
[01:18:55.640 --> 01:18:58.980]   what they do, you know, it's,
[01:18:58.980 --> 01:19:01.940]   and like, you know, we talked a little bit about,
[01:19:01.940 --> 01:19:05.860]   you know, just the constant, ever-present urge to use,
[01:19:05.860 --> 01:19:09.200]   even after sustained periods of abstinence for some people.
[01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:10.760]   That's really, really hard.
[01:19:10.760 --> 01:19:14.100]   And of course, then you double down on the shame
[01:19:14.100 --> 01:19:16.420]   that they feel because of that urge,
[01:19:16.420 --> 01:19:18.660]   even when their lives are so much better.
[01:19:18.660 --> 01:19:22.260]   I mean, these people are really, really remarkable.
[01:19:22.260 --> 01:19:24.920]   And you take their remarkable accomplishment,
[01:19:24.920 --> 01:19:27.840]   and then you imagine the world that we live in now,
[01:19:27.840 --> 01:19:31.540]   where we are constantly invited and tempted,
[01:19:31.540 --> 01:19:34.380]   and really bombarded with opportunities
[01:19:34.380 --> 01:19:35.580]   to become addicted at every turn.
[01:19:35.580 --> 01:19:37.100]   - It's like you're feeling an itch everywhere.
[01:19:37.100 --> 01:19:38.680]   - Oh yeah, I mean, you can't escape it.
[01:19:38.680 --> 01:19:40.020]   You know, you cannot escape it,
[01:19:40.020 --> 01:19:41.780]   that you'll get an email in your inbox
[01:19:41.780 --> 01:19:43.580]   inviting you to do X, Y, or Z.
[01:19:43.580 --> 01:19:45.260]   And if you're addicted to that thing, you know,
[01:19:45.260 --> 01:19:47.580]   you tried to like delete all your apps and not go here,
[01:19:47.580 --> 01:19:49.440]   all of a sudden your work inbox, you're, you know,
[01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:51.780]   you're getting those images, let's say,
[01:19:51.780 --> 01:19:54.060]   really, really, really hard.
[01:19:54.060 --> 01:19:56.420]   And yet these people find a way to do it.
[01:19:56.420 --> 01:19:58.080]   I think it's absolutely amazing.
[01:19:58.080 --> 01:20:00.100]   And they're really wise people.
[01:20:00.100 --> 01:20:02.100]   They have so much wisdom to offer.
[01:20:02.100 --> 01:20:03.200]   They've taught me a lot.
[01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:04.340]   You know, as I talk about in my book,
[01:20:04.340 --> 01:20:05.480]   I have my own addictions,
[01:20:05.480 --> 01:20:07.980]   and I really just like took a page right out of there,
[01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:09.620]   but I was like, okay, what do I do now?
[01:20:09.620 --> 01:20:10.820]   All right, what did this patient do?
[01:20:10.820 --> 01:20:12.660]   Okay, I'm going to try that.
[01:20:12.660 --> 01:20:15.660]   - It is an amazing community of the people
[01:20:15.660 --> 01:20:17.860]   that are very sage.
[01:20:17.860 --> 01:20:21.460]   I wanted to just touch on something that you mentioned,
[01:20:21.460 --> 01:20:23.580]   which is the shame.
[01:20:23.580 --> 01:20:25.380]   You know, you can't go to a meeting
[01:20:26.860 --> 01:20:30.660]   or talk to addicts without detecting
[01:20:30.660 --> 01:20:34.500]   or hearing about like lies, shame, et cetera.
[01:20:34.500 --> 01:20:38.340]   I heard you say in an interview with somebody else recently
[01:20:38.340 --> 01:20:42.460]   that truth telling and secrets
[01:20:42.460 --> 01:20:45.400]   are sort of at the core of recovery.
[01:20:45.400 --> 01:20:48.740]   And yeah, tell us more about that.
[01:20:48.740 --> 01:20:51.060]   - Yeah, so one of the things that I found
[01:20:51.060 --> 01:20:54.420]   really fascinating about working with people in recovery
[01:20:54.420 --> 01:20:58.500]   was how telling the truth, even about the merest detail
[01:20:58.500 --> 01:21:01.520]   of their lives was central to their recovery.
[01:21:01.520 --> 01:21:03.440]   And I became really curious about that.
[01:21:03.440 --> 01:21:06.100]   Like why would truth telling be so important?
[01:21:06.100 --> 01:21:07.620]   And of course there is the obvious thing
[01:21:07.620 --> 01:21:09.060]   that when people are in their addiction,
[01:21:09.060 --> 01:21:10.980]   they're lying about using, you know,
[01:21:10.980 --> 01:21:13.780]   so part of getting into recovery
[01:21:13.780 --> 01:21:16.220]   is to stop lying to the people they care about
[01:21:16.220 --> 01:21:17.360]   about their use.
[01:21:17.360 --> 01:21:19.260]   But it's really more than that
[01:21:19.260 --> 01:21:21.700]   because what people in recovery have taught me
[01:21:21.700 --> 01:21:25.580]   is that it's not even just not lying about using drugs.
[01:21:25.580 --> 01:21:28.100]   I have to not lie about anything.
[01:21:28.100 --> 01:21:30.660]   I can't lie about why I was late to work this morning,
[01:21:30.660 --> 01:21:31.500]   which we all do.
[01:21:31.500 --> 01:21:32.340]   Oh, I hit traffic.
[01:21:32.340 --> 01:21:33.340]   No, I didn't hit traffic.
[01:21:33.340 --> 01:21:35.580]   I wanted to spend two more minutes reading the paper
[01:21:35.580 --> 01:21:37.660]   and drinking my coffee, right?
[01:21:37.660 --> 01:21:39.900]   Or just lying about, you know,
[01:21:39.900 --> 01:21:41.760]   I don't know where I had dinner.
[01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:44.420]   Like, so people with addiction will get into, you know,
[01:21:44.420 --> 01:21:46.700]   the lying habit where they're lying about random stuff
[01:21:46.700 --> 01:21:48.940]   'cause they're sort of in the habit of lying.
[01:21:48.940 --> 01:21:53.640]   And how recovery is really about telling the truth,
[01:21:53.640 --> 01:21:54.900]   you know, in all ways.
[01:21:54.900 --> 01:21:57.980]   And so one of the things that I had a lot of fun with
[01:21:57.980 --> 01:22:00.060]   in writing the book is sort of exploring
[01:22:00.060 --> 01:22:04.860]   the neuroscience around why truth telling is important
[01:22:04.860 --> 01:22:06.420]   to leading a balanced life.
[01:22:06.420 --> 01:22:09.160]   And we know like every religion since the beginning of time
[01:22:09.160 --> 01:22:10.260]   is all about telling the truth.
[01:22:10.260 --> 01:22:11.340]   Well, why, right?
[01:22:11.340 --> 01:22:14.460]   And there's really interesting neuroscience behind it
[01:22:14.460 --> 01:22:17.640]   that suggests that when we tell the truth,
[01:22:17.640 --> 01:22:19.860]   we actually potentially strengthen
[01:22:19.860 --> 01:22:22.540]   our prefrontal cortical circuits
[01:22:22.540 --> 01:22:24.760]   and their connections to our limbic brain
[01:22:24.760 --> 01:22:26.080]   and our reward brain.
[01:22:26.080 --> 01:22:28.360]   And of course, these are the circuits that get disconnected
[01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:29.900]   when we're in our addiction, right?
[01:22:29.900 --> 01:22:32.540]   Our balance in our reward pathway, our limbic brain,
[01:22:32.540 --> 01:22:34.180]   our emotion brain is doing one thing.
[01:22:34.180 --> 01:22:37.040]   And our cortical circuits are completely disengaged
[01:22:37.040 --> 01:22:38.420]   from that ignoring what's happening,
[01:22:38.420 --> 01:22:40.400]   which is easy to do because it's reflexive.
[01:22:40.400 --> 01:22:42.700]   We don't need to think about that balance
[01:22:42.700 --> 01:22:44.460]   for the balance to be happening.
[01:22:44.460 --> 01:22:47.800]   But we have to re-engage those circuits,
[01:22:47.800 --> 01:22:51.300]   anticipate future consequences, think through the drink,
[01:22:51.300 --> 01:22:54.000]   not just how am I gonna feel now if I use,
[01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.560]   but how am I gonna feel tomorrow or six months from now?
[01:22:56.560 --> 01:23:00.440]   And that telling the truth is in fact a way to do that,
[01:23:00.440 --> 01:23:02.360]   to make these connections stronger.
[01:23:02.360 --> 01:23:04.040]   And I talk about some studies in my book
[01:23:04.040 --> 01:23:06.740]   that kind of indirectly show that.
[01:23:06.740 --> 01:23:08.080]   So I find that really fascinating.
[01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:12.280]   Plus just that like being open and honest with people
[01:23:12.280 --> 01:23:16.520]   really does create very intimate connections.
[01:23:16.520 --> 01:23:20.400]   And those intimate connections create dopamine.
[01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:23.120]   So we were talking a little bit about how you know
[01:23:23.120 --> 01:23:26.160]   a bunch of people who need like intensity in their lives.
[01:23:26.160 --> 01:23:31.080]   For me, I need a lot of intensity in my human connections.
[01:23:31.080 --> 01:23:34.120]   Like I'm really not interested in and bored by
[01:23:34.120 --> 01:23:39.120]   and made anxious by casual interactions.
[01:23:39.120 --> 01:23:41.920]   But like having this kind of discussion with you
[01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:46.320]   that's very intense and also intimate and self disclosing
[01:23:46.320 --> 01:23:47.840]   is very rewarding for me.
[01:23:47.840 --> 01:23:49.480]   So that's an important source of dopamine.
[01:23:49.480 --> 01:23:51.360]   Thank God I became a psychiatrist.
[01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:52.200]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[01:23:52.200 --> 01:23:53.820]   - Like I can't disclose all my stuff,
[01:23:53.820 --> 01:23:55.880]   but I am quite transparent with my patients,
[01:23:55.880 --> 01:23:57.700]   which is a slightly unorthodox.
[01:23:57.700 --> 01:24:00.080]   But you know, when I think it's right,
[01:24:00.080 --> 01:24:01.520]   I'm also transparent with them.
[01:24:01.520 --> 01:24:03.960]   So that's a source of dopamine too,
[01:24:03.960 --> 01:24:06.160]   when we're honest and we disclose
[01:24:06.160 --> 01:24:08.360]   and that you think people are gonna run away from you
[01:24:08.360 --> 01:24:10.480]   if you tell them about all like your weird neuroses,
[01:24:10.480 --> 01:24:11.820]   but really they don't.
[01:24:11.820 --> 01:24:12.660]   What they're like is,
[01:24:12.660 --> 01:24:14.920]   "Oh, thank God, I'm not the only one," right?
[01:24:14.920 --> 01:24:16.120]   - Well, what I love about,
[01:24:16.120 --> 01:24:17.780]   I love many things about your book.
[01:24:17.780 --> 01:24:19.320]   I read it in one sweep.
[01:24:19.320 --> 01:24:20.160]   - Oh, thank you.
[01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:21.320]   - And I was like, wow.
[01:24:21.320 --> 01:24:27.140]   I was pleasantly surprised, but I was like,
[01:24:27.140 --> 01:24:29.480]   wow, she's really opening up in this book
[01:24:29.480 --> 01:24:30.720]   from the very beginning.
[01:24:30.720 --> 01:24:33.960]   And I don't want to give it away,
[01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:38.720]   but it's, yeah, you're very open where it's appropriate.
[01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:44.220]   And also, I think that this question about truth telling,
[01:24:44.220 --> 01:24:47.660]   I always think about like, tell the truth,
[01:24:47.660 --> 01:24:50.260]   be 100% about the truth,
[01:24:50.260 --> 01:24:52.820]   but there's also this element about,
[01:24:52.820 --> 01:24:57.280]   do you report previous lies, right?
[01:24:57.280 --> 01:24:59.600]   Like what about prior behavior?
[01:24:59.600 --> 01:25:01.060]   And I'm fascinated by this,
[01:25:01.060 --> 01:25:03.460]   'cause to me, telling the truth has many facets,
[01:25:03.460 --> 01:25:08.000]   but the three sides of this thing in my mind are,
[01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.800]   one is reporting everything accurately.
[01:25:10.800 --> 01:25:12.560]   The other is, what do you withhold,
[01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:14.300]   what do you not withhold, right?
[01:25:14.300 --> 01:25:15.920]   Because some people will say,
[01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:17.760]   tell the truth or at least don't lie.
[01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:18.580]   That's sort of a-
[01:25:18.580 --> 01:25:20.040]   - Lies of omission, right?
[01:25:20.040 --> 01:25:22.160]   - That's a lies of omission.
[01:25:22.160 --> 01:25:23.560]   Lies of omission.
[01:25:23.560 --> 01:25:28.040]   And then there's what I have to assume for most people
[01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:31.460]   is a small to enormous batch of things
[01:25:31.460 --> 01:25:33.640]   that they lied about in the past
[01:25:33.640 --> 01:25:36.280]   that still thread into the future.
[01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:38.640]   So how important is it for the addict
[01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:41.480]   or the every person really to,
[01:25:41.480 --> 01:25:43.260]   'cause it sounds like cultivating the circuitry
[01:25:43.260 --> 01:25:45.240]   between prefrontal cortex and the dopamine system
[01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:46.960]   would be great for anybody,
[01:25:46.960 --> 01:25:49.140]   since we're all addicts, everyone should do it.
[01:25:49.140 --> 01:25:50.480]   But in all seriousness,
[01:25:50.480 --> 01:25:53.320]   it sounds like a good thing for everybody to do.
[01:25:53.320 --> 01:25:58.320]   How much work needs to be done on all the priors,
[01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:01.340]   all the stuff we've hidden?
[01:26:01.340 --> 01:26:02.840]   And I mean, not me,
[01:26:02.840 --> 01:26:05.160]   but all the stuff that everybody else has hidden.
[01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:06.920]   (both laughing)
[01:26:06.920 --> 01:26:11.920]   - Yeah, so the steps of the 12 Steps of Alcoholics Anonymous,
[01:26:11.920 --> 01:26:17.660]   a good number of those steps are about that very thing,
[01:26:17.660 --> 01:26:20.920]   the past, the ways that we've harmed people in the past.
[01:26:20.920 --> 01:26:25.680]   And the fourth step is about making amends
[01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:30.360]   by admitting the ways in which that we've contributed
[01:26:30.360 --> 01:26:33.640]   to harming others.
[01:26:33.640 --> 01:26:36.560]   And it is a really big piece of recovery.
[01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:39.920]   So how important, so for people with addiction,
[01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:43.160]   it's really, really important to go back and make amends.
[01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:48.160]   And the key idea there is you just go back
[01:26:48.160 --> 01:26:50.600]   and you apologize.
[01:26:50.600 --> 01:26:53.920]   And you don't have to get any particular kind of response
[01:26:53.920 --> 01:26:55.480]   or you don't need to be forgiven.
[01:26:55.480 --> 01:27:00.480]   It's the act itself of apologizing about the ways
[01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:04.720]   in which we've harmed or lied to people in the past
[01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:07.640]   that is cathartic and renewing
[01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:09.880]   and allows us to kind of shed this skin
[01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:12.560]   and be new in our lives and begin again,
[01:27:12.560 --> 01:27:16.560]   sort of absolved of past sins, so to speak.
[01:27:16.560 --> 01:27:19.420]   So it is really important.
[01:27:19.420 --> 01:27:23.120]   Are there situations when it's maybe not a good idea
[01:27:23.120 --> 01:27:26.240]   because of that person or the nature?
[01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:28.680]   Sure, there are always gonna be,
[01:27:28.680 --> 01:27:31.040]   it doesn't have to be like, it's not, we're talking about
[01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:33.040]   not like Kant's idea about like, never lie,
[01:27:33.040 --> 01:27:36.160]   but robbers in your house and you're stowaway.
[01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:37.200]   You can't lie even about that.
[01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:39.520]   It's like, no, there are probably situations where-
[01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:43.060]   - Absolutely, for sake of other people's safety,
[01:27:43.060 --> 01:27:44.480]   children's safety, sure. - Right, right, right.
[01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:46.880]   I mean, you can think of a million scenarios.
[01:27:46.880 --> 01:27:51.500]   But in general, when we're taking stock,
[01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:52.560]   because I don't know about you,
[01:27:52.560 --> 01:27:55.040]   but I have a lot of regrets and guilt
[01:27:55.040 --> 01:27:57.480]   about a lot of things in my life.
[01:27:58.480 --> 01:28:02.060]   And they kind of haunt me.
[01:28:02.060 --> 01:28:05.040]   You know, and sometimes I'll have nightmares, right?
[01:28:05.040 --> 01:28:07.000]   And I think that's true for most people.
[01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:08.680]   I mean, I occasionally will meet somebody who's like,
[01:28:08.680 --> 01:28:11.280]   oh, I don't have any regrets, and I'm like, wow.
[01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:14.480]   Like, I cannot relate to that at all.
[01:28:14.480 --> 01:28:20.160]   So, you know, this idea of like catharsis and well,
[01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:22.560]   I mean, in the 12 steps, it's telling God
[01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:25.260]   or your higher power, telling another human being
[01:28:25.260 --> 01:28:26.900]   the ways in which you've wronged others,
[01:28:26.900 --> 01:28:28.840]   considering your own character defects
[01:28:28.840 --> 01:28:29.900]   and how those have contributed.
[01:28:29.900 --> 01:28:31.540]   To me, that's a really important piece
[01:28:31.540 --> 01:28:35.040]   and something that we don't do enough in our current culture,
[01:28:35.040 --> 01:28:36.520]   especially in psychiatry, frankly,
[01:28:36.520 --> 01:28:40.320]   where there's a lot of eternally empathizing with patients,
[01:28:40.320 --> 01:28:41.940]   but not a whole lot of likes going,
[01:28:41.940 --> 01:28:44.300]   well, you know, actually you kind of messed that up.
[01:28:44.300 --> 01:28:47.600]   Or like, that was really bad on you, you know?
[01:28:47.600 --> 01:28:50.520]   And in my work, I don't necessarily use that language,
[01:28:50.520 --> 01:28:52.860]   but, you know, patients may say like,
[01:28:52.860 --> 01:28:55.340]   I really feel badly about this thing.
[01:28:55.340 --> 01:28:57.340]   And I'll be like, yeah, I get it.
[01:28:57.340 --> 01:28:59.080]   I understand that you feel-
[01:28:59.080 --> 01:29:00.560]   - Well, guilt is a- - Right.
[01:29:00.560 --> 01:29:01.920]   - There's a circuit for that too.
[01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:04.360]   - Right, and it's important, right?
[01:29:04.360 --> 01:29:07.520]   And it's also important to recovery
[01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:09.360]   and to not becoming addicted, you know,
[01:29:09.360 --> 01:29:12.760]   experiencing a certain amount of appropriate shame
[01:29:12.760 --> 01:29:14.720]   for things that we have done.
[01:29:14.720 --> 01:29:18.660]   And, you know, feeling the pain that comes with shame,
[01:29:18.660 --> 01:29:21.180]   which is an incredibly painful emotion, right?
[01:29:21.180 --> 01:29:23.040]   And I think that may be the one that we all try to avoid
[01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:27.580]   more than any other is like that shame of not being liked
[01:29:27.580 --> 01:29:29.860]   or not being accepted or not being celebrated.
[01:29:29.860 --> 01:29:32.920]   - Or that the thing that we did is really despicable.
[01:29:32.920 --> 01:29:34.740]   - Right, it's really, yeah, like, oh my God,
[01:29:34.740 --> 01:29:36.740]   I did that horrible thing, right, right.
[01:29:36.740 --> 01:29:39.300]   And then, so, I mean, I've done horrible things
[01:29:39.300 --> 01:29:43.180]   that I haven't gone back and said I did this horrible thing,
[01:29:43.180 --> 01:29:45.580]   but maybe I've tried to pay it forward.
[01:29:45.580 --> 01:29:47.940]   Like I've told my kids, you know, when I was younger,
[01:29:47.940 --> 01:29:50.940]   I did this horrible thing and it still haunts me.
[01:29:50.940 --> 01:29:54.080]   So if you're ever tempted to do something like what I did,
[01:29:54.080 --> 01:29:55.980]   you might think about my situation.
[01:29:55.980 --> 01:29:57.780]   So, you know, some kind of way,
[01:29:57.780 --> 01:30:00.900]   but I think wrestling with that is important.
[01:30:00.900 --> 01:30:03.160]   - I think it's a really important element to all this.
[01:30:03.160 --> 01:30:06.480]   And there's not, I love that there's neuroscience
[01:30:06.480 --> 01:30:09.640]   being done on truth-telling and the value of truth-telling.
[01:30:09.640 --> 01:30:14.640]   I think if I were to predict a new and truly exciting area
[01:30:14.640 --> 01:30:17.540]   that people are going to be really curious about
[01:30:17.540 --> 01:30:20.540]   and in this huge sphere we call neuroscience,
[01:30:20.540 --> 01:30:22.840]   I hope they'll continue to do more work.
[01:30:22.840 --> 01:30:24.240]   Also speaks, I'm so glad to hear
[01:30:24.240 --> 01:30:26.300]   that's happening here at Stanford.
[01:30:26.300 --> 01:30:30.020]   - No, well, the literature that I look at
[01:30:30.020 --> 01:30:33.820]   isn't Stanford work, but there's work.
[01:30:33.820 --> 01:30:35.340]   There might be people at Stanford.
[01:30:35.340 --> 01:30:37.140]   - Great, regardless of where it's happening,
[01:30:37.140 --> 01:30:39.660]   more of that and all the rest, please.
[01:30:39.660 --> 01:30:45.500]   I want to ask you about using drugs to treat drug addiction.
[01:30:45.500 --> 01:30:47.580]   These days, there's a growing interest
[01:30:47.580 --> 01:30:50.020]   or at least discussion about Ibogaine,
[01:30:50.020 --> 01:30:52.060]   people going out of country,
[01:30:52.060 --> 01:30:55.180]   because I think it's still illegal here or is illegal here,
[01:30:55.180 --> 01:30:57.140]   going out of country to, I don't know,
[01:30:57.140 --> 01:31:00.960]   either inject it or smoke it or whatever it is,
[01:31:00.960 --> 01:31:04.860]   or people going and doing ayahuasca journeys or MDMA,
[01:31:04.860 --> 01:31:07.500]   which is still an illegal drug in this country,
[01:31:07.500 --> 01:31:08.540]   but there are clinical trials.
[01:31:08.540 --> 01:31:11.740]   There are people on this campus doing experimental studies.
[01:31:11.740 --> 01:31:12.820]   I don't know of clinical trials,
[01:31:12.820 --> 01:31:16.060]   but at Johns Hopkins there are clinical trials, et cetera.
[01:31:16.060 --> 01:31:19.360]   So this is a vast area, right?
[01:31:19.360 --> 01:31:21.120]   Different chemistries for different drugs
[01:31:21.120 --> 01:31:22.140]   and different purposes,
[01:31:22.140 --> 01:31:25.360]   but the rationale, as I understand it,
[01:31:25.360 --> 01:31:29.320]   is take people who are in a pattern of addiction,
[01:31:29.320 --> 01:31:33.620]   launch them into a experience
[01:31:33.620 --> 01:31:35.760]   that's also chemical and extreme,
[01:31:35.760 --> 01:31:40.760]   often of the extreme serotonin and/or extreme dopamine type.
[01:31:40.760 --> 01:31:44.180]   So MDMA, ecstasy, for instance, tons of serotonin dumped,
[01:31:44.180 --> 01:31:47.900]   tons of dopamine dumped, how neurotoxic, if neurotoxic,
[01:31:47.900 --> 01:31:51.400]   debatable, et cetera, et cetera, not a topic for now,
[01:31:51.400 --> 01:31:52.880]   but a lot.
[01:31:52.880 --> 01:31:55.360]   And then somehow that extreme experience
[01:31:55.360 --> 01:31:59.160]   wrapped inside of a supported network in there,
[01:31:59.160 --> 01:32:01.000]   whether or not there's just someone there
[01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:02.420]   or whether or not they're actively working
[01:32:02.420 --> 01:32:04.580]   through something with the patient,
[01:32:04.580 --> 01:32:08.500]   is supposed to eject the person into a life
[01:32:08.500 --> 01:32:13.500]   where drug use isn't as much of interest.
[01:32:14.160 --> 01:32:17.940]   This violates, at a rash, purely rational level,
[01:32:17.940 --> 01:32:20.060]   this violates everything we've talked about
[01:32:20.060 --> 01:32:21.840]   in terms of dopamine biology.
[01:32:21.840 --> 01:32:25.700]   It would, if this arrangement is the way I described it,
[01:32:25.700 --> 01:32:30.120]   cause more addiction, is anything but a dopamine fast,
[01:32:30.120 --> 01:32:31.600]   it's a dopamine feast.
[01:32:31.600 --> 01:32:36.400]   So we hear about successful transitions through this,
[01:32:36.400 --> 01:32:39.700]   at least anecdotally, and maybe some clinical say,
[01:32:39.700 --> 01:32:43.020]   "What is going on?" [laughing]
[01:32:43.020 --> 01:32:44.220]   "What is going on?"
[01:32:44.220 --> 01:32:45.680]   Doesn't make any sense to me.
[01:32:45.680 --> 01:32:49.480]   Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:32:49.480 --> 01:32:52.480]   So I think it's good that you're skeptical.
[01:32:52.480 --> 01:32:54.740]   I think we all should be skeptical.
[01:32:54.740 --> 01:32:59.740]   Having said that, there are clinical studies showing,
[01:32:59.740 --> 01:33:02.340]   you know, and these are small studies
[01:33:02.340 --> 01:33:05.840]   and they're short duration, small number of subjects,
[01:33:05.840 --> 01:33:07.500]   but, you know, taking people, for example,
[01:33:07.500 --> 01:33:12.420]   who are addicted to alcohol and then having them have this,
[01:33:12.420 --> 01:33:14.100]   let's say, psychedelic experience
[01:33:14.100 --> 01:33:16.160]   in a very controlled setting.
[01:33:16.160 --> 01:33:18.660]   - So either, typically it's a high dose psilocybin
[01:33:18.660 --> 01:33:22.940]   or three dose, as I saw it for the MAP study of MDMA,
[01:33:22.940 --> 01:33:23.780]   of ecstasy. - Right.
[01:33:23.780 --> 01:33:25.460]   - Those are sort of the, seem to be the kind of-
[01:33:25.460 --> 01:33:27.160]   - The typical. - The kind of bread and butter
[01:33:27.160 --> 01:33:28.500]   of this kind of work. - Right, right.
[01:33:28.500 --> 01:33:31.080]   But the thing to really keep in mind is that
[01:33:31.080 --> 01:33:36.080]   this is completely interwoven with regular psychotherapy
[01:33:36.080 --> 01:33:39.300]   and that these are highly selected individuals.
[01:33:39.300 --> 01:33:40.820]   - And clinical trials. - Right, right.
[01:33:40.820 --> 01:33:43.100]   - We're referring to legal clinical trials.
[01:33:43.100 --> 01:33:46.860]   - And so, you know, I think the metaphor
[01:33:46.860 --> 01:33:49.260]   that helps me think about this is
[01:33:49.260 --> 01:33:51.500]   there are many ways to the top of the mountain
[01:33:51.500 --> 01:33:54.120]   and these are sort of like taking the gondola
[01:33:54.120 --> 01:33:55.980]   instead of walking up.
[01:33:55.980 --> 01:33:59.660]   It's sort of, instead of doing like a year of psychoanalysis
[01:33:59.660 --> 01:34:01.420]   where you're sitting on the couch every week,
[01:34:01.420 --> 01:34:05.260]   reflecting on your life, it's a condensed version
[01:34:05.260 --> 01:34:09.380]   of psychoanalysis or psychotherapy plus, you know, MDMA,
[01:34:09.380 --> 01:34:11.060]   which gets you there faster.
[01:34:11.060 --> 01:34:13.540]   - Creates the intimacy, presumably, because of this-
[01:34:13.540 --> 01:34:16.420]   - Well, I think the main thing that happens
[01:34:16.420 --> 01:34:21.020]   when it's beneficial is it just allows the person
[01:34:21.020 --> 01:34:26.020]   to get outside of their own head and look at their lives
[01:34:26.020 --> 01:34:31.220]   on a much broader sweep and to consider themselves
[01:34:31.220 --> 01:34:36.220]   not mired in the quotidian sort of details of their life,
[01:34:37.180 --> 01:34:42.180]   but rather as a human on the large planet Earth
[01:34:42.180 --> 01:34:43.940]   in the vast universe.
[01:34:43.940 --> 01:34:47.880]   So I think it takes, it's like when it works,
[01:34:47.880 --> 01:34:50.260]   it's a transformational experience
[01:34:50.260 --> 01:34:54.800]   because it gives the person another lens
[01:34:54.800 --> 01:34:57.820]   through which to view their lives,
[01:34:57.820 --> 01:35:02.020]   which I think for some people is positive and powerful
[01:35:02.020 --> 01:35:04.460]   because they can come back from that and be like,
[01:35:04.460 --> 01:35:08.340]   oh my gosh, I care about my family
[01:35:08.340 --> 01:35:10.900]   and I want X, Y, or Z for them
[01:35:10.900 --> 01:35:12.700]   and I realize that my continuing to drink
[01:35:12.700 --> 01:35:15.380]   is not going to achieve that.
[01:35:15.380 --> 01:35:20.020]   So it's almost like a spiritual or values-based.
[01:35:20.020 --> 01:35:21.860]   So I think it can be very powerful.
[01:35:21.860 --> 01:35:25.620]   But having said that, I truly am quite skeptical
[01:35:25.620 --> 01:35:29.180]   because addiction is a chronic relapsing
[01:35:29.180 --> 01:35:30.120]   and remitting problem.
[01:35:30.120 --> 01:35:32.340]   It's hard for me to imagine that there's something
[01:35:32.340 --> 01:35:34.640]   that works very quickly short-term
[01:35:34.640 --> 01:35:37.080]   that's going to work for a disease
[01:35:37.080 --> 01:35:38.980]   that's really long lasting.
[01:35:38.980 --> 01:35:40.280]   - Yeah, the two addicts I know
[01:35:40.280 --> 01:35:43.460]   that did MDMA-assisted psychotherapy
[01:35:43.460 --> 01:35:46.660]   as part of this thing both got worse.
[01:35:46.660 --> 01:35:48.220]   - Yeah.
[01:35:48.220 --> 01:35:51.720]   - But the people I know who had severe trauma,
[01:35:51.720 --> 01:35:53.900]   who did this, who took this approach
[01:35:53.900 --> 01:35:55.140]   seemed to be doing better.
[01:35:55.140 --> 01:35:55.980]   - Okay, interesting.
[01:35:55.980 --> 01:36:00.540]   - And so I think that the discussion as we hear it now
[01:36:00.540 --> 01:36:02.160]   is just sort of psychedelics,
[01:36:02.160 --> 01:36:05.540]   which is a huge category that includes many different drugs
[01:36:05.540 --> 01:36:07.240]   and compounds with different effects.
[01:36:07.240 --> 01:36:11.460]   And we hear about trauma and addiction lumped together.
[01:36:11.460 --> 01:36:14.900]   And I think that I'm a splitter, not a lumper,
[01:36:14.900 --> 01:36:16.160]   as we say in science.
[01:36:16.160 --> 01:36:22.500]   And I think it's going to be important for people to know
[01:36:22.500 --> 01:36:27.500]   that this is definitely not a one-size-fits-all kind of thing
[01:36:27.500 --> 01:36:30.140]   but it sounds like it may have some utility
[01:36:30.140 --> 01:36:31.660]   under certain conditions.
[01:36:31.660 --> 01:36:32.820]   - Yeah, I think so.
[01:36:32.820 --> 01:36:35.340]   I think I'm trying to be very open-minded
[01:36:35.340 --> 01:36:38.440]   about its potential utility for certain individuals.
[01:36:38.440 --> 01:36:40.400]   But I can tell you in my clinical work,
[01:36:40.400 --> 01:36:43.960]   what is a very concerning unintended consequence
[01:36:43.960 --> 01:36:47.340]   of this narrative is I have a lot of people
[01:36:47.340 --> 01:36:49.620]   who are looking for some kind of spiritual awakening
[01:36:49.620 --> 01:36:52.060]   who on their own, not in the context
[01:36:52.060 --> 01:36:55.060]   of any kind of therapeutic psychological work,
[01:36:55.060 --> 01:37:00.060]   microdose or want to try psilocybin or MDMA
[01:37:00.060 --> 01:37:01.540]   with a friend or wherever,
[01:37:01.540 --> 01:37:03.740]   so they can have this spiritual experience
[01:37:03.740 --> 01:37:05.340]   that they can figure out their lives.
[01:37:05.340 --> 01:37:09.180]   That's a disaster and almost never works out well.
[01:37:09.180 --> 01:37:11.200]   And I've then had people who literally,
[01:37:11.200 --> 01:37:14.460]   supposedly you can't get addicted to psychedelics
[01:37:14.460 --> 01:37:16.460]   because something with the biochemistry,
[01:37:16.460 --> 01:37:17.460]   which I don't fully understand
[01:37:17.460 --> 01:37:18.900]   'cause it doesn't make any sense to me,
[01:37:18.900 --> 01:37:22.140]   but I have patients clinically who definitely are addicted
[01:37:22.140 --> 01:37:24.840]   to MDMA, to microdosing.
[01:37:24.840 --> 01:37:27.220]   So that's very concerning to me
[01:37:27.220 --> 01:37:30.160]   'cause like Pollan's "How to Change Your Mind,"
[01:37:30.160 --> 01:37:34.580]   I respect that work, but on the other hand,
[01:37:34.580 --> 01:37:36.600]   it's penetrated the culture- - Michael Pollan's book.
[01:37:36.600 --> 01:37:39.120]   - Yeah, yeah. - Well, and I don't know him
[01:37:39.120 --> 01:37:43.220]   and so I don't have a problem taking a stance.
[01:37:43.220 --> 01:37:47.020]   So I'll just say my stance on that is the narrative
[01:37:47.020 --> 01:37:52.020]   of popular authors can expand and wick out so fast
[01:37:52.020 --> 01:37:54.700]   that pretty soon people are essentially taking
[01:37:54.700 --> 01:37:56.800]   their mental health into their own hands.
[01:37:56.800 --> 01:38:00.920]   And I actually have great optimism for this business
[01:38:00.920 --> 01:38:05.920]   of clinical use of psychedelics, including MDMA.
[01:38:05.920 --> 01:38:08.720]   Matthew Johnson at Johns Hopkins
[01:38:08.720 --> 01:38:10.640]   is doing fabulous work on this.
[01:38:10.640 --> 01:38:13.780]   And there are others too, of course,
[01:38:13.780 --> 01:38:16.020]   but those are controlled settings.
[01:38:16.020 --> 01:38:17.980]   And the pharmacology is being tuned up.
[01:38:17.980 --> 01:38:20.500]   And one thing that I think is coming,
[01:38:20.500 --> 01:38:22.620]   there are several papers published recently
[01:38:22.620 --> 01:38:25.680]   in great journals like "Nature" and "Science," et cetera,
[01:38:25.680 --> 01:38:30.100]   where there are scientists who are removing
[01:38:30.100 --> 01:38:33.260]   the hallucinogenic components of these drugs
[01:38:33.260 --> 01:38:38.660]   and finding that they still have the antidepressant effects.
[01:38:38.660 --> 01:38:42.540]   And so the experience of a psychedelic
[01:38:42.540 --> 01:38:45.000]   and the long-term effects of the psychedelic
[01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.460]   might actually be dissociable.
[01:38:47.460 --> 01:38:50.260]   And so I, again, and I'm always careful to say,
[01:38:50.260 --> 01:38:53.300]   I'm neither for something or against it.
[01:38:53.300 --> 01:38:58.300]   I just think that treading carefully is what's important.
[01:38:58.300 --> 01:39:00.120]   - I agree with you.
[01:39:00.120 --> 01:39:03.320]   And I can just tell you that the downstream effect
[01:39:03.320 --> 01:39:08.320]   for the average person, many of whom present in our clinic,
[01:39:08.320 --> 01:39:12.700]   is that they've misconstrued the data
[01:39:12.700 --> 01:39:16.400]   on the use of psychedelics for mental health conditions
[01:39:16.400 --> 01:39:19.400]   to this idea that they're safe
[01:39:19.400 --> 01:39:21.560]   or that anybody can take them in any circumstance
[01:39:21.560 --> 01:39:23.440]   and have this kind of awakening.
[01:39:23.440 --> 01:39:26.500]   And that's not what the data show, right?
[01:39:26.500 --> 01:39:29.460]   The data are these highly controlled settings,
[01:39:29.460 --> 01:39:32.440]   carefully selected patients.
[01:39:32.440 --> 01:39:34.740]   So that's my worry.
[01:39:34.740 --> 01:39:35.580]   - Sure.
[01:39:35.580 --> 01:39:38.000]   And I'm going to be sitting down with Matthew Johnson
[01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.040]   at some point and we'll discuss this.
[01:39:40.040 --> 01:39:45.000]   And I think that that care and that cocoon
[01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:49.440]   of real clinical care does seem to be an important component.
[01:39:49.440 --> 01:39:50.880]   Well, I'm glad we could touch on it.
[01:39:50.880 --> 01:39:53.800]   And, you know, I'm sure I'll get a bunch of comments
[01:39:53.800 --> 01:39:58.300]   telling me that, you know, but I think it is important
[01:39:58.300 --> 01:39:59.800]   to explore things from all sides.
[01:39:59.800 --> 01:40:02.200]   And that's what we do as scientists.
[01:40:02.200 --> 01:40:05.600]   And if Michael Pollan wants to chat, we can do that too.
[01:40:05.600 --> 01:40:06.440]   That's fine.
[01:40:06.440 --> 01:40:08.840]   I very much enjoyed the book, actually.
[01:40:08.840 --> 01:40:12.160]   But I think that people run with ideas.
[01:40:12.160 --> 01:40:13.000]   - That's right.
[01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:14.560]   - They don't walk with them, they sprint.
[01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:16.160]   - Right, yeah.
[01:40:16.160 --> 01:40:19.860]   - There are a couple other things I just want to touch on,
[01:40:19.860 --> 01:40:21.980]   but they all relate to social media.
[01:40:21.980 --> 01:40:22.820]   - Okay.
[01:40:22.820 --> 01:40:25.200]   - You were featured in "The Social Dilemma."
[01:40:25.200 --> 01:40:26.280]   It was a powerful movie.
[01:40:26.280 --> 01:40:28.280]   I think many people avoided seeing that movie
[01:40:28.280 --> 01:40:32.120]   because it reflects back on us just how addicted we all are
[01:40:32.120 --> 01:40:33.960]   and how manipulated we all are.
[01:40:33.960 --> 01:40:34.800]   - Yes.
[01:40:34.800 --> 01:40:37.700]   - But it doesn't seem to have changed behavior much.
[01:40:37.700 --> 01:40:41.560]   I have to say that the movie changed my understanding
[01:40:41.560 --> 01:40:44.500]   and my perception, but not my behavior too much.
[01:40:44.500 --> 01:40:48.640]   If we look at addiction as a maladaptive thing,
[01:40:48.640 --> 01:40:50.660]   something that's making our lives worse
[01:40:50.660 --> 01:40:54.860]   or us less functional at work and in relationships,
[01:40:54.860 --> 01:40:57.120]   I could imagine a version of social media
[01:40:57.120 --> 01:40:59.780]   where it's making me more connected.
[01:40:59.780 --> 01:41:01.620]   I mean, this is a podcast after all.
[01:41:01.620 --> 01:41:02.760]   I post videos.
[01:41:02.760 --> 01:41:04.060]   This will show up on YouTube
[01:41:04.060 --> 01:41:08.020]   and elements of it on Instagram as well.
[01:41:08.020 --> 01:41:12.400]   So much like sugar or other things,
[01:41:12.400 --> 01:41:15.220]   I have to imagine that we need to regulate,
[01:41:15.220 --> 01:41:18.340]   not necessarily eliminate this behavior.
[01:41:18.340 --> 01:41:20.720]   So I want to talk about what that looks like.
[01:41:20.720 --> 01:41:23.720]   And I want to talk about what you've referred to
[01:41:23.720 --> 01:41:26.900]   as this narcissistic preoccupation
[01:41:26.900 --> 01:41:28.740]   that social media is creating,
[01:41:28.740 --> 01:41:33.540]   that we are all far more keenly aware of how we look
[01:41:33.540 --> 01:41:36.860]   and how we sound and how we are being perceived
[01:41:36.860 --> 01:41:39.800]   than we were 10 years ago.
[01:41:39.800 --> 01:41:40.640]   - Right.
[01:41:40.640 --> 01:41:42.420]   - So first of all, social media,
[01:41:42.420 --> 01:41:46.000]   how addicting is it really?
[01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:50.300]   And what is healthy social media behavior?
[01:41:50.300 --> 01:41:56.240]   - So the first message I would want to get across
[01:41:56.240 --> 01:42:00.160]   about social media is that it really is a drug
[01:42:00.160 --> 01:42:01.980]   and it's engineered to be a drug.
[01:42:01.980 --> 01:42:07.920]   And it's based on potency, quantity, variety,
[01:42:07.920 --> 01:42:10.180]   the bottomless bowls, the likes,
[01:42:10.180 --> 01:42:12.760]   the way that it's enumerated, all of that,
[01:42:12.760 --> 01:42:16.160]   which doesn't mean that we can't use it,
[01:42:16.160 --> 01:42:19.460]   but we need to be very thoughtful about the way we use it,
[01:42:19.460 --> 01:42:20.800]   just like we need to be thoughtful
[01:42:20.800 --> 01:42:22.980]   about the way we use any drug.
[01:42:22.980 --> 01:42:27.080]   And so that means with intention
[01:42:27.080 --> 01:42:30.720]   and in advance, planning our use, right?
[01:42:30.720 --> 01:42:35.600]   And trying to use it as a really awesome tool
[01:42:35.600 --> 01:42:38.200]   to potentially connect with other people
[01:42:38.200 --> 01:42:42.960]   and not to be used by it or get lost in it.
[01:42:42.960 --> 01:42:45.480]   And of course, people are gonna come
[01:42:45.480 --> 01:42:49.520]   with different propensities for addiction to any drug.
[01:42:49.520 --> 01:42:51.060]   And that's true for social media too.
[01:42:51.060 --> 01:42:54.720]   Some people will have no problem using it in moderation
[01:42:54.720 --> 01:42:56.400]   or using it in a way that's adaptive.
[01:42:56.400 --> 01:43:00.280]   And other people will immediately get sucked in.
[01:43:00.280 --> 01:43:02.040]   And the key thing about getting addicted
[01:43:02.040 --> 01:43:05.280]   is when it's happening, nobody who's getting addicted
[01:43:05.280 --> 01:43:06.500]   thinks they're getting addicted, right?
[01:43:06.500 --> 01:43:09.200]   Let's face it, it's only after the fact that we go,
[01:43:09.200 --> 01:43:11.280]   "Whoops, what was that about?"
[01:43:11.280 --> 01:43:12.620]   - Well, remember texting and driving?
[01:43:12.620 --> 01:43:14.420]   There were all these books about texting and driving,
[01:43:14.420 --> 01:43:15.560]   how terrible it was.
[01:43:15.560 --> 01:43:16.400]   - Yeah.
[01:43:16.400 --> 01:43:18.540]   - Even the governments have largely given up.
[01:43:18.540 --> 01:43:21.620]   You see these billboards, like don't text and drive
[01:43:21.620 --> 01:43:24.600]   or any texts can wait or not worth dying for,
[01:43:24.600 --> 01:43:25.940]   but everybody's texting and driving.
[01:43:25.940 --> 01:43:28.140]   - Right, and if you look at young people today, teenagers,
[01:43:28.140 --> 01:43:30.740]   I mean, they're basically cybernetically enhanced.
[01:43:30.740 --> 01:43:33.780]   The phone is there, it's like they're talking to you
[01:43:33.780 --> 01:43:36.320]   and texting 12 friends at the same time.
[01:43:36.320 --> 01:43:37.920]   And there's no stopping it.
[01:43:37.920 --> 01:43:40.600]   I mean, the genie is out of the bottle.
[01:43:40.600 --> 01:43:42.440]   We're not going back.
[01:43:42.440 --> 01:43:47.440]   So we do need to figure out how to make this tool
[01:43:47.440 --> 01:43:51.120]   something that's gonna be good for us
[01:43:51.120 --> 01:43:52.920]   and not ultimately harmful.
[01:43:52.920 --> 01:43:55.200]   And I don't have all the answers
[01:43:55.200 --> 01:43:57.540]   by any stretch of the imagination,
[01:43:57.540 --> 01:44:01.200]   but I do think some of the wisdom that we have learned
[01:44:01.200 --> 01:44:05.200]   from using other drugs also applies to social media,
[01:44:05.200 --> 01:44:07.780]   which is to say that we have to, again,
[01:44:07.780 --> 01:44:11.900]   put barriers in place that allow us to remain in control
[01:44:11.900 --> 01:44:14.640]   of our use, which means not too much,
[01:44:14.640 --> 01:44:17.740]   not too often, not too potent.
[01:44:17.740 --> 01:44:19.480]   - Do you think in going back to this idea
[01:44:19.480 --> 01:44:23.420]   of the unit of the day being a good tractable unit,
[01:44:23.420 --> 01:44:25.920]   a manageable unit of time for most people?
[01:44:25.920 --> 01:44:29.740]   So you're saying in advance, so allocating two hours
[01:44:29.740 --> 01:44:32.640]   in which you're going to allow yourself
[01:44:32.640 --> 01:44:35.360]   to have free rein use of the phone and all its apps
[01:44:35.360 --> 01:44:38.400]   and all its things, or even more restricted than that,
[01:44:38.400 --> 01:44:41.120]   meaning, okay, I'm only going to allow myself
[01:44:41.120 --> 01:44:43.440]   30 minutes a day to post and comment,
[01:44:43.440 --> 01:44:46.680]   and then that's a closeout completely.
[01:44:46.680 --> 01:44:49.180]   - Yeah, so I think it depends on the person
[01:44:49.180 --> 01:44:50.080]   and sort of a combination.
[01:44:50.080 --> 01:44:51.880]   We talked earlier about having an itch
[01:44:51.880 --> 01:44:53.540]   and scratching yourself at night.
[01:44:53.540 --> 01:44:55.280]   We've gotten to a point with smartphones.
[01:44:55.280 --> 01:44:56.880]   People are pulling them out
[01:44:56.880 --> 01:44:59.280]   and they are utterly unconscious of doing so.
[01:44:59.280 --> 01:45:02.000]   Pulling them out, a couple texts, a couple,
[01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:02.840]   they don't know they're doing it.
[01:45:02.840 --> 01:45:06.640]   - I have a friend who works and delivers babies,
[01:45:06.640 --> 01:45:11.640]   and many pregnant mothers won't actually deliver
[01:45:11.640 --> 01:45:14.440]   without their phone in hand.
[01:45:14.440 --> 01:45:15.720]   And this used to be the hand
[01:45:15.720 --> 01:45:17.000]   that was connected to their spouse.
[01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:20.960]   This may be a comment on spouses more than on phones,
[01:45:20.960 --> 01:45:25.960]   but it sounds like it's a kind of a security blanket.
[01:45:25.960 --> 01:45:29.120]   - Right, like a transitional object, yeah.
[01:45:29.120 --> 01:45:33.660]   - Actually, that reminds me, you've referred to the phone.
[01:45:33.660 --> 01:45:34.600]   I think it's the phone,
[01:45:34.600 --> 01:45:38.540]   but maybe it's our online persona or ourselves
[01:45:38.540 --> 01:45:42.200]   as we've become sort of infantile in our need for it.
[01:45:42.200 --> 01:45:44.040]   It's like a baby in a bottle.
[01:45:44.040 --> 01:45:46.720]   And so I do wonder if we have regressed,
[01:45:46.720 --> 01:45:48.480]   and I do think we've regressed a bit
[01:45:48.480 --> 01:45:51.880]   in terms of our online behavior,
[01:45:51.880 --> 01:45:54.000]   our inability to act like...
[01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:55.400]   I saw an adult was somebody
[01:45:55.400 --> 01:45:56.800]   that couldn't control their behavior.
[01:45:56.800 --> 01:45:58.400]   That's the difference between a baby and an adult.
[01:45:58.400 --> 01:45:59.900]   You don't have to be a developmental neurobiologist
[01:45:59.900 --> 01:46:01.720]   for very long to understand that a young organism
[01:46:01.720 --> 01:46:04.440]   can't control its behavior and an older one can.
[01:46:04.440 --> 01:46:08.000]   So to me, a mature organism, mature in years,
[01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.440]   organism that can't control its behavior is a baby.
[01:46:10.440 --> 01:46:13.440]   It's an immature version of itself.
[01:46:13.440 --> 01:46:16.360]   And there's neuroscience to support that statement.
[01:46:16.360 --> 01:46:19.760]   I look at my own behavior with the phone sometimes,
[01:46:19.760 --> 01:46:23.440]   and I think, "I'm a grown man.
[01:46:23.440 --> 01:46:25.000]   What is the problem here?"
[01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:28.200]   I don't eat baby food,
[01:46:28.200 --> 01:46:31.580]   but I'm acting like a baby with the phone, all right?
[01:46:31.580 --> 01:46:35.520]   In the sense that I'm reflexively picking it up,
[01:46:35.520 --> 01:46:39.520]   I'm not being intentioned and deliberate with it.
[01:46:39.520 --> 01:46:41.560]   Do I need a full 30 days, Anna?
[01:46:41.560 --> 01:46:43.080]   - So, yes.
[01:46:43.080 --> 01:46:43.920]   - 30 days away from my phone?
[01:46:43.920 --> 01:46:45.400]   - As you know, that's my recommendation,
[01:46:45.400 --> 01:46:47.160]   the full 30 days to reset.
[01:46:47.160 --> 01:46:50.900]   If you're severely addicted, I recommend the 30 days,
[01:46:50.900 --> 01:46:54.000]   but if you're just a little bit addicted, like most of us,
[01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:55.280]   you probably don't need 30 days.
[01:46:55.280 --> 01:46:58.960]   In fact, a single day not only would be challenging,
[01:46:58.960 --> 01:47:02.200]   but probably maybe sufficient.
[01:47:02.200 --> 01:47:05.360]   - My phone is off for substantial segments of the day.
[01:47:05.360 --> 01:47:06.280]   - Okay, that's great.
[01:47:06.280 --> 01:47:08.000]   - And it drives other people crazy.
[01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:13.000]   People expect me to respond, but I don't care.
[01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:14.360]   I really don't. - Yeah, right, right.
[01:47:14.360 --> 01:47:16.860]   - And I actually take a little bit of pleasure
[01:47:16.860 --> 01:47:18.000]   in the fact that, well,
[01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:19.840]   because I think the point I'm trying to make
[01:47:19.840 --> 01:47:22.040]   is the right one, which is that it's not just right for me,
[01:47:22.040 --> 01:47:26.920]   but like why, I don't see a clause on text messages
[01:47:26.920 --> 01:47:30.240]   or emails that say must be responded to
[01:47:30.240 --> 01:47:34.360]   within X amount of time or else, or else.
[01:47:34.360 --> 01:47:38.240]   So I take the liberty of replying when I'm able to.
[01:47:38.240 --> 01:47:39.080]   - Yeah, that's right.
[01:47:39.080 --> 01:47:39.920]   - Or want to.
[01:47:39.920 --> 01:47:41.480]   - Yeah, right, but which touches
[01:47:41.480 --> 01:47:44.760]   on one of the big challenges about social media
[01:47:44.760 --> 01:47:47.200]   is that as more and more of us are spending
[01:47:47.200 --> 01:47:49.220]   more and more time on social media,
[01:47:49.220 --> 01:47:53.160]   we're divesting our libidinous energies, et cetera,
[01:47:53.160 --> 01:47:55.260]   from real life interactions.
[01:47:55.260 --> 01:47:58.140]   So that means even when we want to choose
[01:47:58.140 --> 01:48:00.480]   to not be online connecting,
[01:48:00.480 --> 01:48:02.900]   we go outside and there's no there there, right?
[01:48:02.900 --> 01:48:04.720]   There's nobody else there.
[01:48:04.720 --> 01:48:07.820]   So I think our collective challenge,
[01:48:07.820 --> 01:48:10.100]   and it should be our mission,
[01:48:10.100 --> 01:48:13.320]   is to make sure that we are preserving
[01:48:13.320 --> 01:48:18.320]   and maintaining offline ways to connect with each other.
[01:48:18.480 --> 01:48:19.940]   'Cause if we don't do that,
[01:48:19.940 --> 01:48:23.920]   then we'll be very lonely, right, if we were not online.
[01:48:23.920 --> 01:48:27.940]   But if you have a tribe of folks that you can be with,
[01:48:27.940 --> 01:48:31.660]   none of whom are on their phones while you're together
[01:48:31.660 --> 01:48:32.920]   for that discrete amount of time,
[01:48:32.920 --> 01:48:36.240]   then it's wonderful and liberating and nobody's distracted.
[01:48:36.240 --> 01:48:38.920]   And I think that's really the key.
[01:48:38.920 --> 01:48:41.860]   And I think young people are figuring that out.
[01:48:41.860 --> 01:48:44.440]   They're trying to create these spaces or try to,
[01:48:44.440 --> 01:48:47.200]   let's say instead of doing a dopamine fast by yourself,
[01:48:47.200 --> 01:48:49.060]   do it with your friends, right?
[01:48:49.060 --> 01:48:51.720]   Then there's the FOMO is less, if you're missing out,
[01:48:51.720 --> 01:48:54.600]   because, oh, you're all doing the dopamine fast together.
[01:48:54.600 --> 01:48:57.440]   So these are some of the tricks that we can come up with,
[01:48:57.440 --> 01:48:58.280]   but- - I like that.
[01:48:58.280 --> 01:48:59.280]   - Yeah, okay, good. - I like that.
[01:48:59.280 --> 01:49:02.740]   I don't allow, I have a home gym and I love working out.
[01:49:02.740 --> 01:49:04.520]   I just enjoy it and I always have.
[01:49:04.520 --> 01:49:08.520]   And I don't allow my phone in my gym anymore.
[01:49:08.520 --> 01:49:11.140]   And I live in an area where I don't get any reception,
[01:49:11.140 --> 01:49:13.040]   like two meters outside my door.
[01:49:13.040 --> 01:49:15.200]   So all my dog walks now are just-
[01:49:15.200 --> 01:49:16.640]   And they were boring as hell.
[01:49:16.640 --> 01:49:18.160]   I also have a bulldog, he doesn't like to walk.
[01:49:18.160 --> 01:49:19.380]   It's really slow.
[01:49:19.380 --> 01:49:23.160]   And it was so boring for a while,
[01:49:23.160 --> 01:49:24.640]   'cause I was so used to taking calls
[01:49:24.640 --> 01:49:26.500]   while I walk and it's super efficient.
[01:49:26.500 --> 01:49:27.600]   Why wouldn't I do that?
[01:49:27.600 --> 01:49:32.300]   The walks now are some of my favorite part of the day.
[01:49:32.300 --> 01:49:34.120]   Because, and if the phone were,
[01:49:34.120 --> 01:49:35.680]   if I were to get a call on one of those
[01:49:35.680 --> 01:49:37.040]   and they brought reception to the area,
[01:49:37.040 --> 01:49:38.740]   I would be very dismayed.
[01:49:38.740 --> 01:49:39.860]   So I can attest to this.
[01:49:39.860 --> 01:49:42.600]   And I don't think I'm a phone addict,
[01:49:43.480 --> 01:49:46.800]   but I do put work into regulating my-
[01:49:46.800 --> 01:49:48.080]   - Yes, so this is the key.
[01:49:48.080 --> 01:49:50.200]   You have to, with intention,
[01:49:50.200 --> 01:49:52.460]   prior to being in that situation,
[01:49:52.460 --> 01:49:55.860]   think of literal physical and metacognitive barriers
[01:49:55.860 --> 01:49:59.120]   that you can put between yourself and your phone
[01:49:59.120 --> 01:50:00.880]   or whatever your drug is,
[01:50:00.880 --> 01:50:03.380]   to create these intentional spaces
[01:50:03.380 --> 01:50:06.500]   where you're not constantly interrupting yourself,
[01:50:06.500 --> 01:50:08.020]   essentially, and distracting yourself.
[01:50:08.020 --> 01:50:09.580]   Because I really do think,
[01:50:09.580 --> 01:50:12.820]   I think we talked just before we started with the interview,
[01:50:13.560 --> 01:50:15.960]   you know, we're losing the ability
[01:50:15.960 --> 01:50:18.860]   to have a sustained thought, right?
[01:50:18.860 --> 01:50:20.260]   I mean, we get so far.
[01:50:20.260 --> 01:50:23.220]   And then you get to that point in the thought
[01:50:23.220 --> 01:50:26.640]   where it's a little bit hard to know what's coming next.
[01:50:26.640 --> 01:50:30.900]   And it's very easy to check your phone or check your email
[01:50:30.900 --> 01:50:34.540]   or look something up on the internet.
[01:50:34.540 --> 01:50:36.980]   And then you never get that opportunity
[01:50:36.980 --> 01:50:38.620]   to finish that thought,
[01:50:38.620 --> 01:50:41.180]   which is really the source of creative energy
[01:50:41.180 --> 01:50:42.720]   and an original thought, right?
[01:50:42.720 --> 01:50:44.560]   You're not just reacting to what's coming at you.
[01:50:44.560 --> 01:50:46.620]   - And something that could contribute to the world.
[01:50:46.620 --> 01:50:48.020]   - That's right.
[01:50:48.020 --> 01:50:51.500]   - I'm a big believer that you're either consuming
[01:50:51.500 --> 01:50:53.660]   or you are creating.
[01:50:53.660 --> 01:50:56.800]   And there is, I should mention, it's important.
[01:50:56.800 --> 01:50:58.140]   I do believe in neutral time.
[01:50:58.140 --> 01:50:59.340]   I think sleep is great.
[01:50:59.340 --> 01:51:00.700]   I'm a big proponent of sleep
[01:51:00.700 --> 01:51:02.540]   and I've talked a lot about it on the podcast.
[01:51:02.540 --> 01:51:04.740]   I care a lot about sleep
[01:51:04.740 --> 01:51:06.040]   and not just for sake of performance.
[01:51:06.040 --> 01:51:07.820]   I actually just really like sleep.
[01:51:08.980 --> 01:51:13.980]   I think that being a constant consumer of visual information
[01:51:13.980 --> 01:51:16.860]   and information of all kinds can be a problem,
[01:51:16.860 --> 01:51:18.980]   but there's some really great sources
[01:51:18.980 --> 01:51:20.300]   of information on the internet.
[01:51:20.300 --> 01:51:24.380]   And I certainly benefit from the fact
[01:51:24.380 --> 01:51:26.120]   that those channels exist.
[01:51:26.120 --> 01:51:29.220]   Narcissistic preoccupation.
[01:51:29.220 --> 01:51:31.260]   Am I a narcissist?
[01:51:31.260 --> 01:51:34.420]   - First of all, there's healthy-
[01:51:34.420 --> 01:51:36.820]   - Or is the fact that I asked, does that take me out of,
[01:51:36.820 --> 01:51:38.540]   would a narcissist never ask that question?
[01:51:38.540 --> 01:51:41.140]   - Oh yes, a highly sophisticated narcissist
[01:51:41.140 --> 01:51:41.980]   would know to do that. - Oh, I see.
[01:51:41.980 --> 01:51:42.820]   Well, I'm not very sophisticated.
[01:51:42.820 --> 01:51:44.820]   (both laughing)
[01:51:44.820 --> 01:51:46.940]   - So there's healthy narcissism,
[01:51:46.940 --> 01:51:50.360]   which means that we all invest our personal energies
[01:51:50.360 --> 01:51:52.240]   into things that we care about.
[01:51:52.240 --> 01:51:54.940]   And if our competence in that arena is threatened,
[01:51:54.940 --> 01:51:57.300]   we would all experience a narcissistic injury
[01:51:57.300 --> 01:52:00.060]   and that's normal and healthy.
[01:52:00.060 --> 01:52:04.340]   But we are living in a narcissistic culture.
[01:52:04.340 --> 01:52:05.600]   I mean, that's not news.
[01:52:05.600 --> 01:52:08.820]   This preoccupation with individual achievement
[01:52:08.820 --> 01:52:12.840]   and individual self-worth and individual self-confidence.
[01:52:12.840 --> 01:52:17.840]   And I think all of that is just fueled by social media
[01:52:17.840 --> 01:52:19.760]   where we're not just seeing ourselves,
[01:52:19.760 --> 01:52:21.880]   but we're seeing people's reactions to ourselves
[01:52:21.880 --> 01:52:24.740]   and every single thing we say or do,
[01:52:24.740 --> 01:52:26.800]   we get likes and this and that.
[01:52:26.800 --> 01:52:28.580]   It's really insidious.
[01:52:28.580 --> 01:52:30.000]   And it contributes, I think,
[01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:33.080]   ultimately to a lot of personal shame
[01:52:33.080 --> 01:52:36.740]   because we're not really meant to be individuals
[01:52:36.740 --> 01:52:39.980]   bouncing around in the universe, we're social animals.
[01:52:39.980 --> 01:52:42.960]   And we're probably generally happiest
[01:52:42.960 --> 01:52:45.700]   even for natural contrarians among us
[01:52:45.700 --> 01:52:48.180]   when we're part of a tribe, right?
[01:52:48.180 --> 01:52:51.260]   And if we do too much to kind of separate ourselves
[01:52:51.260 --> 01:52:56.260]   from that tribe, I think that the brain's natural
[01:52:56.260 --> 01:52:59.120]   and instinctive corrective mechanism against that
[01:52:59.120 --> 01:53:01.400]   is self-loathing and shame.
[01:53:01.400 --> 01:53:06.180]   So it's so ironic because the culture tells us
[01:53:06.180 --> 01:53:08.760]   if we just achieve more, we'll like ourselves more.
[01:53:08.760 --> 01:53:11.200]   But the truth is actually the opposite
[01:53:11.200 --> 01:53:14.000]   that I think when people get these pinnacles
[01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:15.600]   of personal achievement,
[01:53:15.600 --> 01:53:18.720]   you have things like the imposter syndrome or whatever.
[01:53:18.720 --> 01:53:21.360]   - Where you just, we're at Stanford
[01:53:21.360 --> 01:53:23.660]   after a lot of high achievers here, right?
[01:53:23.660 --> 01:53:26.640]   Some phenomenal, amazing people like yourself
[01:53:26.640 --> 01:53:29.280]   and other colleagues of mine that just, I'm always in awe.
[01:53:29.280 --> 01:53:30.400]   Like, it's just amazing.
[01:53:30.400 --> 01:53:32.240]   Like the mean is shifted so high.
[01:53:32.240 --> 01:53:35.740]   And also people who have amazing paths to get here
[01:53:35.740 --> 01:53:38.460]   coming from very little accomplishing so much.
[01:53:38.460 --> 01:53:41.600]   But it's also the pressure, right?
[01:53:41.600 --> 01:53:45.200]   The way that this career was described to me
[01:53:45.200 --> 01:53:47.880]   the day I got my job was one colleague of mine,
[01:53:47.880 --> 01:53:50.480]   the late Ben Baris said, "Welcome to schizophrenia
[01:53:50.480 --> 01:53:52.800]   'cause you're never going to be able to complete anything
[01:53:52.800 --> 01:53:53.960]   without getting interrupted."
[01:53:53.960 --> 01:53:56.320]   That was partially true, although I've created buffers.
[01:53:56.320 --> 01:53:59.880]   And the other one, very successful scientist,
[01:53:59.880 --> 01:54:03.020]   a member of the National Academy, et cetera, said to me,
[01:54:03.020 --> 01:54:06.760]   "Just remember it's pinball, you never win.
[01:54:06.760 --> 01:54:09.360]   The best you can do is just keep playing."
[01:54:09.360 --> 01:54:13.840]   And I thought, wow, okay, okay.
[01:54:13.840 --> 01:54:15.360]   And then you just go.
[01:54:15.360 --> 01:54:18.540]   But I think that as we achieve more,
[01:54:18.540 --> 01:54:21.680]   not just academics, of course, but as anyone achieves more,
[01:54:21.680 --> 01:54:24.520]   there's the relishing and the accomplishment.
[01:54:24.520 --> 01:54:26.760]   There's often the desire for more,
[01:54:26.760 --> 01:54:28.560]   but there's also the pressure of,
[01:54:28.560 --> 01:54:31.260]   well, now I have to do this for the next 30 years,
[01:54:31.260 --> 01:54:32.100]   even though I love it.
[01:54:32.100 --> 01:54:34.720]   It's the pressure of, well, if the mountain is this high,
[01:54:34.720 --> 01:54:37.140]   then how do I get here and here and here?
[01:54:37.140 --> 01:54:38.640]   And then you start shoveling more dirt on
[01:54:38.640 --> 01:54:39.520]   so you can keep climbing.
[01:54:39.520 --> 01:54:41.180]   And it's a lot of work.
[01:54:41.180 --> 01:54:44.560]   And I think that the perception of success
[01:54:44.560 --> 01:54:48.100]   is that there's a roar of the crowd and you cruise.
[01:54:48.100 --> 01:54:50.680]   You don't cruise, they just give you more to do.
[01:54:50.680 --> 01:54:52.600]   Or you give yourself more to do.
[01:54:52.600 --> 01:54:56.600]   - Well, what I think is, at least in my life experience,
[01:54:56.600 --> 01:54:59.560]   and I've heard this from other people as well,
[01:54:59.560 --> 01:55:03.000]   it's that prize that we're going for,
[01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:07.720]   that if we get it is so unsatisfying.
[01:55:07.720 --> 01:55:11.080]   And it's the prize that we never imagined
[01:55:11.080 --> 01:55:13.920]   that we kind of go, well, how did that happen?
[01:55:13.920 --> 01:55:16.560]   But gee, that feels good.
[01:55:16.560 --> 01:55:18.280]   And so I'm very, it's curious, what's the deal?
[01:55:18.280 --> 01:55:20.720]   - It's like a mirage in the one case.
[01:55:20.720 --> 01:55:25.720]   And it's like a, yeah, it's almost like dopamine
[01:55:26.240 --> 01:55:30.080]   can create these mirages, that there's some place there.
[01:55:30.080 --> 01:55:30.920]   - That's right.
[01:55:30.920 --> 01:55:33.280]   And if I just, it's that pot of gold, right?
[01:55:33.280 --> 01:55:34.480]   - Constant dopamine.
[01:55:34.480 --> 01:55:36.520]   - Right, that's right, that's right.
[01:55:36.520 --> 01:55:39.200]   And I think this really, I think,
[01:55:39.200 --> 01:55:41.880]   is related to our discussion earlier
[01:55:41.880 --> 01:55:43.480]   about this taking it one day at a time
[01:55:43.480 --> 01:55:46.800]   or paying attention to that 24-hour period
[01:55:46.800 --> 01:55:48.560]   in your environment.
[01:55:48.560 --> 01:55:50.840]   I am absolutely fascinated by the ways
[01:55:50.840 --> 01:55:55.840]   in which we accumulate success when we do that
[01:55:56.200 --> 01:56:00.720]   totally independent of the desire for success.
[01:56:00.720 --> 01:56:02.960]   It's really process-oriented.
[01:56:02.960 --> 01:56:06.480]   It's like, where am I today?
[01:56:06.480 --> 01:56:09.600]   How can I make today a good and meaningful day
[01:56:09.600 --> 01:56:14.600]   a little bit better or as good as some other days I've had?
[01:56:14.600 --> 01:56:18.680]   Constantly tweaking and experimenting with this experiment
[01:56:18.680 --> 01:56:21.640]   that we call our human existence.
[01:56:21.640 --> 01:56:25.440]   And when we do that in a way that's authentic
[01:56:25.440 --> 01:56:28.880]   and paying attention and value-driven,
[01:56:28.880 --> 01:56:32.440]   whatever our values are informed by,
[01:56:32.440 --> 01:56:34.780]   it is very, very interesting how those days,
[01:56:34.780 --> 01:56:37.240]   again, accumulate and you find,
[01:56:37.240 --> 01:56:40.000]   well, I guess I contributed something of value there,
[01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:43.040]   but I wasn't trying to do that.
[01:56:43.040 --> 01:56:44.880]   I think that's really, I mean,
[01:56:44.880 --> 01:56:47.720]   what I'm so amazed by is like 20 years ago
[01:56:47.720 --> 01:56:50.360]   when I went to Stanford Medical School 25 years ago,
[01:56:50.360 --> 01:56:55.200]   I was happy to just be a good doctor.
[01:56:55.200 --> 01:56:58.000]   I was like, I guess I'm just gonna try to figure out
[01:56:58.000 --> 01:56:58.920]   how to be a good doctor.
[01:56:58.920 --> 01:56:59.760]   I'm here to learn that.
[01:56:59.760 --> 01:57:02.100]   And now I see these medical students and they're wonderful.
[01:57:02.100 --> 01:57:05.460]   They're brilliant and they're well-intentioned, all that.
[01:57:05.460 --> 01:57:09.980]   But they're like, how can I write the great American novel,
[01:57:09.980 --> 01:57:14.360]   do my startup, go to Africa, apply for that grant?
[01:57:14.360 --> 01:57:15.480]   It's like, really?
[01:57:15.480 --> 01:57:17.660]   I was just trying to learn how to be a doctor.
[01:57:17.660 --> 01:57:20.680]   And as you say, it's a lot of pressure on them.
[01:57:20.680 --> 01:57:24.600]   And it's also kind of a weird leapfrogging
[01:57:24.600 --> 01:57:29.480]   of the real way to accomplish something,
[01:57:29.480 --> 01:57:31.980]   which isn't about like, oh, how can I accomplish something?
[01:57:31.980 --> 01:57:36.920]   It's like, what can I do today that would be of service?
[01:57:36.920 --> 01:57:39.960]   And then finding that of trying to be of service
[01:57:39.960 --> 01:57:43.320]   and not really going for recognition
[01:57:43.320 --> 01:57:46.180]   can sometimes lead to what people call success,
[01:57:46.180 --> 01:57:47.920]   although that wasn't what you were aiming for.
[01:57:47.920 --> 01:57:49.240]   - And it's all the more beautiful
[01:57:49.240 --> 01:57:50.320]   when it's not what you're aiming for.
[01:57:50.320 --> 01:57:52.560]   - Oh, so much better, so much better.
[01:57:52.560 --> 01:57:57.560]   - I'm a big believer that when one can align
[01:57:57.560 --> 01:58:01.120]   their compulsion with some greater good,
[01:58:01.120 --> 01:58:04.080]   a service to humanity or the planet or animals,
[01:58:04.080 --> 01:58:09.080]   whatever it is, that's where the really good stuff emerges.
[01:58:09.080 --> 01:58:11.680]   Because there's a lot of reciprocity there.
[01:58:11.680 --> 01:58:14.880]   The world starts to, you're supporting the world
[01:58:14.880 --> 01:58:16.400]   and then it starts to support you
[01:58:16.400 --> 01:58:17.800]   in a way that feels very fluid.
[01:58:17.800 --> 01:58:19.120]   - And that comes back, right.
[01:58:19.120 --> 01:58:22.160]   And I mean, that speaks to your generosity to me,
[01:58:22.160 --> 01:58:24.280]   vis-a-vis my book.
[01:58:24.280 --> 01:58:25.120]   And I have to say-
[01:58:25.120 --> 01:58:26.680]   - Well, I love the book.
[01:58:26.680 --> 01:58:28.840]   There's like, we're not in a business deal, folks.
[01:58:28.840 --> 01:58:31.680]   It's just purely that I heard Anna lecture in my course.
[01:58:31.680 --> 01:58:33.160]   I wanted to learn more about dopamine.
[01:58:33.160 --> 01:58:35.040]   She taught me, I asked her if she would come on the podcast.
[01:58:35.040 --> 01:58:36.720]   Turned out she wrote this amazing book.
[01:58:36.720 --> 01:58:38.840]   She sent me a man's copy of the book.
[01:58:38.840 --> 01:58:39.980]   I read it in one sweep.
[01:58:39.980 --> 01:58:41.700]   It's incredible and I love it.
[01:58:41.700 --> 01:58:45.260]   So just like the eight-year-old version of me,
[01:58:45.260 --> 01:58:48.200]   now the 45 version of myself,
[01:58:48.200 --> 01:58:50.520]   I can't stop blabbing about the things I love.
[01:58:50.520 --> 01:58:52.520]   - Well, it's awesome, but I have to say,
[01:58:52.520 --> 01:58:56.700]   I have been surprised by your generosity.
[01:58:56.700 --> 01:59:01.700]   It's not something I've encountered frequently at Stanford,
[01:59:01.700 --> 01:59:03.160]   which is a wonderful place.
[01:59:03.160 --> 01:59:08.160]   But there is a general sense that if I give away
[01:59:08.160 --> 01:59:14.220]   to somebody else, I've lost something,
[01:59:14.220 --> 01:59:18.320]   which is not the right way to think about it,
[01:59:18.320 --> 01:59:21.600]   not how you are, and also not how the world works.
[01:59:21.600 --> 01:59:24.200]   'Cause when we give away to other people,
[01:59:24.200 --> 01:59:29.200]   we get back so much more, but it takes a long time
[01:59:29.200 --> 01:59:31.920]   and it might not come through that path.
[01:59:31.920 --> 01:59:34.940]   - I never think about reciprocity,
[01:59:34.940 --> 01:59:38.780]   but I was weaned by good advisors.
[01:59:38.780 --> 01:59:40.000]   - That's very nice, yeah.
[01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:41.760]   - I think I just sort of got drilled into me
[01:59:41.760 --> 01:59:46.460]   that the more you give, the better your immediate life is.
[01:59:46.460 --> 01:59:48.460]   But I also don't have a long-term vision.
[01:59:48.460 --> 01:59:52.820]   I'm just excited about the book.
[01:59:52.820 --> 01:59:55.340]   I'm excited that people are learning
[01:59:55.340 --> 01:59:57.440]   about the brain and dopamine.
[01:59:57.440 --> 02:00:00.440]   I have to admit, having grown up in neuroscience,
[02:00:00.440 --> 02:00:02.640]   essentially, I did not understand that pleasure
[02:00:02.640 --> 02:00:05.340]   and pain were orchestrated the way that they are.
[02:00:05.340 --> 02:00:07.180]   I'm very mindful of it now.
[02:00:07.180 --> 02:00:08.020]   - Oh, good.
[02:00:08.020 --> 02:00:10.720]   - And it's changed a number of my behaviors.
[02:00:10.720 --> 02:00:12.620]   I know a number of people are going to have questions
[02:00:12.620 --> 02:00:14.240]   and want to get in contact with you.
[02:00:14.240 --> 02:00:16.200]   You are not on social media.
[02:00:16.200 --> 02:00:17.440]   - That's correct, yes.
[02:00:17.440 --> 02:00:20.420]   - You are true to your ideology.
[02:00:20.420 --> 02:00:21.680]   That's great.
[02:00:21.680 --> 02:00:22.940]   - And the reason for that is just,
[02:00:22.940 --> 02:00:25.080]   I wouldn't be able to control myself.
[02:00:25.080 --> 02:00:26.920]   I mean, that really would be my drug.
[02:00:26.920 --> 02:00:28.260]   People are my drug.
[02:00:28.260 --> 02:00:31.880]   Intimacy is my drug, and I wouldn't be able to manage it.
[02:00:31.880 --> 02:00:35.460]   And so it was just easier for me to not do it at all
[02:00:35.460 --> 02:00:37.180]   rather than try to moderate it.
[02:00:37.180 --> 02:00:39.580]   - Well, the book, as you mentioned before,
[02:00:39.580 --> 02:00:42.260]   and as I can attest to, is it has a certain intimacy.
[02:00:42.260 --> 02:00:43.780]   People get to know you through the book.
[02:00:43.780 --> 02:00:46.260]   So definitely check out the book.
[02:00:46.260 --> 02:00:48.780]   If you have questions about the book, et cetera,
[02:00:48.780 --> 02:00:50.420]   you're welcome to send them my way.
[02:00:50.420 --> 02:00:52.500]   I will buffer you from all those questions.
[02:00:52.500 --> 02:00:53.500]   I'll filter them.
[02:00:53.500 --> 02:00:57.960]   Anna, Dr. Lemke, I should be a formal,
[02:00:57.960 --> 02:00:59.300]   forgive me, I've been referring to you
[02:00:59.300 --> 02:01:00.700]   the whole way through. - No, no, that's fine.
[02:01:00.700 --> 02:01:01.540]   - 'Cause we're colleagues,
[02:01:01.540 --> 02:01:04.580]   but thank you so much for sharing this information.
[02:01:04.580 --> 02:01:06.820]   And I know I learned a ton,
[02:01:06.820 --> 02:01:09.200]   and I know everyone else is going to learn a lot more
[02:01:09.200 --> 02:01:12.220]   about addiction and the good side of dopamine.
[02:01:12.220 --> 02:01:13.420]   - That's right.
[02:01:13.420 --> 02:01:14.380]   Thank you for having me.
