[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.000]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now, while
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.240]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.240]   My name is Joshua Sheets.
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.240]   I'm your host.
[00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.480]   And today I want to talk with you about New Year's resolutions, goal setting.
[00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.160]   I want to talk with you about how awesome it is to set goals.
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.940]   I want to encourage you to establish New Year's resolutions.
[00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.160]   And I want to give you some thoughts and ideas that will help you to be more accomplished
[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.180]   and effective at doing that for yourself.
[00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.020]   One thing I've noticed throughout my lifetime is that it's generally considered to be quite
[00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.020]   hip to bash New Year's resolutions.
[00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.860]   I don't know why that is.
[00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:52.180]   I could come up with some reasons why I think that is, but I do not think that New Year's
[00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.220]   resolutions should be derided or mocked in any way.
[00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.220]   New Year's resolutions are fantastic.
[00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.000]   They are wonderful.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.800]   The New Year is a fantastic time to sit down and consider your life and imagine the future.
[00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.260]   It's just such a beautiful marker in the sand for you to consider where you're going and
[00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:12.700]   how you want to get there.
[00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:18.840]   I genuinely believe that New Year's resolutions and New Year goal setting is awesome.
[00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.900]   And I am convinced that the only people who will ever criticize you for setting goals
[00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.900]   or for making New Year's resolutions are losers.
[00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:34.680]   Losers are the only people who criticize you for trying to better yourself because losers
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.640]   and leeches around you want to pull you down.
[00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.700]   And if you are going to embark upon a program of self-improvement, of lifestyle enhancement,
[00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.620]   of going after a bigger and better life, you better get used to the fact that most people
[00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:53.560]   around you don't actually want to see you succeed because most people live in a world
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:59.100]   filled with envy and greed and they want what other people have and they're not willing
[00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.880]   to be happy for other people and then put in their own work.
[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.860]   They want to take from other people.
[00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.700]   And unfortunately, it seems to me that we live in an era in which this envy is rewarded
[00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.080]   on many, many levels.
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.960]   So recognize that if you set out on a program of New Year's resolutions and self-improvement,
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.100]   get used to the idea of other people trying to tear you down.
[00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:27.380]   But the people who have what you want, the people who have accomplished what you want
[00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.180]   to accomplish, I don't think those people are ever going to pull you down.
[00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.500]   Winners will congratulate you.
[00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.300]   Winners will encourage you.
[00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.620]   And winners will share their strategies with you.
[00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:46.880]   For example, just imagine that you are a 10-year-old boy and you have a dream of someday playing
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:47.880]   in the NBA.
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.660]   A classic dream for a young 10-year-old boy.
[00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:57.980]   Well, if you go to the circle around you, which is probably not in any way filled with
[00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:03.940]   NBA players, and you share that dream with lots of people, they may indulge you, but
[00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:09.660]   they will very quickly start talking to you about practicality and setting practical goals.
[00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.380]   And some people will start to tear you down.
[00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:18.340]   But if you're sitting in a room full of NBA players and you start sharing your dream of
[00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:24.020]   someday playing in the NBA, you're not going to hear a negative word from any NBA player.
[00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.260]   You're not going to hear anybody say, "It can't be done."
[00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.320]   You're going to hear each and every one of them encourage you and then start to share
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:37.620]   with you strategies of what you can do now at the age of 10 so that at the age of 20
[00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.220]   you are potentially prepared to play in the NBA.
[00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.300]   A lot of life works like this.
[00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.700]   You want to be very careful who you share your goals with.
[00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.340]   You want to be very careful who you share your resolutions with.
[00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.500]   It's fine to share them with nobody at all.
[00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.720]   But if you do share your goals or if you do share your resolutions, recognize that the
[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:05.820]   only people who are going to criticize you for establishing resolutions for yourself
[00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:10.840]   or goals for yourself are losers who want to pull you down.
[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:16.700]   So if you are concerned about setting goals for the year or setting resolutions for the
[00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.900]   year, if you're thinking that, "Oh, maybe it's not hip for me to set goals for myself
[00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:27.100]   or maybe it's not hip for me to establish New Year's resolutions," abandon that thinking.
[00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.660]   Winners are going to congratulate you.
[00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.300]   They're going to encourage you.
[00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.580]   And then they're going to share the strategies that have been effective for them.
[00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.540]   They're going to share their fine-tuning strategies to help you.
[00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:43.680]   And that's my goal in today's podcast episode is to share some of the strategies that I
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.660]   think that have been effective for me and some ideas that I hope will help you.
[00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.060]   But this isn't a one-stop shop.
[00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.980]   Goal setting is a skill.
[00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.260]   It's a skill that has to be developed.
[00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:02.540]   And every step along that path, every experience that you have, every win and every loss, every
[00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:10.500]   positive experience, every negative experience, every success and every failure, this is all
[00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:15.460]   data that becomes part of skill development.
[00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:20.420]   There's not a person out there who has been successful from the start.
[00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:23.420]   There's not a person out there who has been able to keep every New Year's resolution that
[00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:24.420]   he's ever set.
[00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:25.740]   It doesn't exist.
[00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:30.180]   So in this episode, I'm going to share with you some detailed strategies and ideas to
[00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:35.660]   help you effectively set goals so that you can accomplish all of the things that you
[00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:39.620]   set out for yourself in this coming new year in 2023.
[00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:46.260]   I want your resolutions to be exciting and motivating, and I want you to exceed in them.

[00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:21.060]   To begin with, I want to establish a metaphor.
[00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:24.540]   We're going to use a couple of metaphors in this discussion.
[00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:30.020]   And I believe that metaphors are very, very useful for us in a subject like this, because
[00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:35.020]   you're going to have to fill in all of the specifics of your personal goals.
[00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:40.220]   And to accomplish your personal goals, you're going to need quite a lot of specific knowledge.
[00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:46.120]   I can't talk generally about your specific goals, but what I can do is I can share the
[00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:49.180]   helpful metaphors that we can all relate to.
[00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:55.940]   And my favorite metaphor to use when talking about goal setting is to compare goal setting
[00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:58.980]   to travel.
[00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:02.980]   We can all understand the concept of travel.
[00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:07.020]   We have all traveled to some extent and we can understand it.
[00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:09.700]   And it's a perfect metaphor to use with goal setting.
[00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:11.780]   To begin with, setting a goal.
[00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:12.900]   What is a goal?
[00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:19.420]   I think of a goal as a dream destination, a place that you want to go.
[00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:20.420]   It's a destination.
[00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:26.440]   So let's say that we're going to imagine the places that you're going to travel this year.
[00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:30.900]   You start by thinking about your dream destinations.
[00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:34.920]   I want you to pause for a moment and think about this.
[00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:41.620]   If you were going to list three destinations that you would like to travel to this year,
[00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:44.980]   what would they be?
[00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:49.220]   Make a list of those destinations, three of them.
[00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:54.260]   What are your three dream destinations?
[00:07:54.260 --> 00:08:02.860]   Now, keep that list of three dream destinations in mind as I talk about some of the destinations
[00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:05.900]   that you could choose.
[00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:11.980]   The first thing to notice is that you will choose your dream destinations quite naturally.
[00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:16.600]   And your dream destinations will be different than mine.
[00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:22.140]   Some people have a dream destination that is quite close to home.
[00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:26.000]   Some people have a dream destination that's far away.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.780]   Some people have a dream destination that has a certain feature to it.
[00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:32.780]   Ask a surfer what his dream destination is.
[00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:37.820]   He's going to list a specific wave that he wants to surf or a specific region of the
[00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:39.900]   world that he wants to surf.
[00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:43.860]   Ask a diver, a scuba diver, what his dream destination is.
[00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:48.900]   He might list a certain reef or a certain country that has features that he wants to
[00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:50.320]   surf.
[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:53.220]   Ask a traveler what his dream destination is.
[00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:56.280]   And he might list a certain set of features.
[00:08:56.280 --> 00:09:00.780]   Ask somebody who has more normal life experience.
[00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:04.660]   And his dream destination might be closer to home.
[00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:10.300]   Notice that there is nothing inherently right or wrong about any of these dream destinations.
[00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:14.940]   If your dream destination is to go and take a hike through a beautiful national forest
[00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:21.440]   that's 100 miles away from your home, that's just as valid of a dream destination as the
[00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:25.900]   guy who says, "I want to fly across the world and see the ancient pyramids."
[00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:30.780]   It's just as valid to say, "I want to go to Indonesia and surf around Indonesia," as it
[00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:36.400]   is to say, "I want to go and see the Vatican City."
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:41.420]   It's just as valid to say, "My dream destination is to sit at home in this beautiful place
[00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:44.380]   where I live, but to tour every museum in my city."
[00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:50.060]   It's just as valid to say that as to say, "I want to go on some far-flung expensive
[00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:51.060]   destination."
[00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:58.540]   So you're going to choose and establish your dream destinations based upon your experience,
[00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:01.980]   your exposure, what you think is interesting to you.
[00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:05.300]   This is why we all wind up setting different goals.
[00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:09.140]   For some people, it's interesting to travel across the world.
[00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:10.840]   For other people, it's not.
[00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:13.700]   They don't want to deal with foreign languages, foreign cultures.
[00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:16.500]   It's interesting to them to travel around their home country.
[00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:20.900]   For some people, travel is not in any way interesting.
[00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:28.580]   So envision your destination and recognize that whatever destination you choose in life,
[00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:29.860]   that's fine.
[00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:33.460]   You don't have to choose other people's destinations.
[00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:41.660]   Now when you envision your destination, there are going to be certain features and attributes
[00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:47.540]   that come along fairly automatically with how to accomplish that destination.
[00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:50.020]   I'll give you an example.
[00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:55.380]   I'm born and raised in South Florida, on the coastline of South Florida.
[00:10:55.380 --> 00:11:01.060]   And so for me, beaches generally have had very little appeal because I've grown up all
[00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:04.100]   my life around beaches.
[00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:07.060]   Disney World has virtually no appeal.
[00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:09.540]   I've gone to Disney World a handful of times.
[00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:15.620]   I don't have any emotional connection to Disney characters or to the Disney world, meaning
[00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:17.900]   the world of their characters and whatnot.
[00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:20.740]   I've been to Disney enough times to know, "Eh, I don't enjoy it.
[00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:21.740]   It's not fun.
[00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:23.740]   I have no interest in going."
[00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:30.300]   So if you talk to me about dream destinations, I'm usually going to come up with things that
[00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:33.020]   are different than what I have experienced.
[00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:35.020]   So I'm going to list three destinations.
[00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:37.780]   First, I like mountains.
[00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:42.100]   And so I like to ride motorcycles and I like mountains.
[00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:47.060]   And one of the things that is fairly common is that motorcyclists often like riding through
[00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:48.060]   the mountains.
[00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:54.660]   There's a very famous road in Tennessee called Tail of the Dragon, where motorcyclists like
[00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:57.100]   to go and ride their motorcycles.
[00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:01.500]   It makes just a very windy road where people enjoy all the curves.
[00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:05.260]   That would be an example of a dream destination for someone like me.
[00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:09.020]   I enjoy the mountains because it's different than the flat beaches where I'm from.
[00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:10.700]   I enjoy the cool weather, et cetera.
[00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:11.700]   I like Tennessee.
[00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:14.260]   I like that region of the country.
[00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:18.580]   And if I like motorcycling and I want to set a destination, if I want to go and motorcycle
[00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:26.340]   to the Tail of the Dragon, I think it's Deagles Gap, Tennessee, then this is a great dream
[00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:27.340]   destination.
[00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:28.340]   There's a great trip involved with that.
[00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:30.700]   That would be one example.
[00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:36.180]   Another example for me of a dream destination is that I've always had a dream to take a
[00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:39.500]   year off and take my children all around the United States.
[00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:43.900]   When I was a young boy, I traveled a lot around the country.
[00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:44.900]   We always camped.
[00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:48.100]   We stayed in national parks and state parks.
[00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:49.100]   We learned a lot.
[00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:51.740]   I really enjoyed that time of family togetherness.
[00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:53.700]   I also really enjoy history.
[00:12:53.700 --> 00:13:01.260]   I feel that one of the valuable gifts that we can give to children is to expose our children
[00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:09.020]   to history and to experience, to a diverse array of experience and sites and cultures,
[00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:12.780]   et cetera, so that they can understand some of the options that they have to choose from
[00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:13.780]   in life.
[00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:18.220]   They have a sense of confidence in themselves to be able to choose, and they have a wider
[00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:20.100]   board of options.
[00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:25.500]   For me, a dream trip or a dream destination is that someday, when it's appropriate with
[00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:31.060]   my children's learning, I will take a year off and I will travel around the United States
[00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:37.100]   in an RV so that we can really enjoy being in those places that I like to be.
[00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:44.300]   A third dream destination for me is to take my family to mainland China.
[00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:48.140]   I'm fascinated with Chinese culture, and I'd like to take my children.
[00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:50.340]   I'd like to show them the Great Wall of China.
[00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:52.180]   I'd like to take them to the Forbidden Palace.
[00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:53.260]   I've seen these things.
[00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:54.260]   I've been there.
[00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:59.100]   I've done it, but I would like them to get an idea of this great world power and some
[00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:02.020]   of the features and attributes that it holds.
[00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:04.100]   Those are three that are for me.
[00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:08.820]   I'll list one more just as an example, but this one's not appropriate to me.
[00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:09.940]   Some people might have the idea.
[00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:13.940]   Let's say you're from Denver, Colorado or Chicago, Illinois, and you've always dreamed
[00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:15.380]   of the beaches.
[00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:23.020]   You've seen the videos and the pictures of all these beautiful beaches around the world,
[00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:28.700]   and you dream of sailing around the Pacific Islands with your family and with your children.
[00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:32.940]   If we describe these three simple goals, goal number one would be take a motorcycle trip
[00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:34.980]   to Deals Gap, Tennessee.
[00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:40.940]   Goal number two is take a year off and travel with my children around the United States.
[00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:48.500]   Goal number three, take my family to mainland China and explore some of the famous Chinese
[00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:52.860]   heritage things, the Forbidden Palace, the Great Wall of China, and many of the other
[00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:57.740]   national heritage sites that are there, the UNESCO World Heritage Sites that are located
[00:14:57.740 --> 00:14:58.740]   in China.
[00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:02.380]   By the way, did you know that I think China and Italy are the two countries with the most
[00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:04.460]   world heritage sites now?
[00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:06.660]   China's been working hard at improving their numbers.
[00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:10.060]   So lots of historical and interesting things to see there.
[00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:16.300]   Now, when you envision your trip or envision your destination, it will basically set most
[00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:21.660]   things in order for you to accomplish it.
[00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:27.700]   If you envision a goal, you can see that some goals could be accomplished in the short term,
[00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:32.780]   some goals could be accomplished in the longer term, some goals will require more planning
[00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:35.660]   and more preparation.
[00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:41.100]   And once you envision the goal, most of your work is done.
[00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:43.580]   Now it's just a matter of taking the steps.
[00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:48.180]   If we compare the motorcyclist's dream of taking a trip to Tale of the Dragon to ride
[00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:53.300]   this famous stretch of road in Tennessee, now we know some certain things, right?
[00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:55.620]   I don't have a motorcycle.
[00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:56.620]   I don't...
[00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:57.620]   Do I want to go alone?
[00:15:57.620 --> 00:15:58.620]   I'm going to need a motorcycle, right?
[00:15:58.620 --> 00:15:59.620]   That's the first thing.
[00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:02.420]   The second thing is, am I going to go alone or am I going to go with buddies?
[00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:05.840]   Most motorcyclists have friends that ride motorcycles and a lot of motorcyclists enjoy
[00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:06.980]   being together.
[00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:10.820]   So I need to get some buddies to get their motorcycles and kind of pick out a time.
[00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:13.820]   But the accomplishment of that goal is fairly simple and straightforward.
[00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:17.500]   If I don't have a motorcycle, I'm either going to need to buy one or rent one.
[00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:18.740]   I'm going to need to make a date.
[00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:21.980]   I'm going to need to save the necessary money to get there and I'm going to put it on the
[00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:24.380]   calendar and go and accomplish it.
[00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:26.980]   And many important goals are just like this.
[00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:29.300]   They can be achieved very, very quickly.
[00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:32.620]   They might require a little bit of money, a little bit of forethought, a little bit
[00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:37.200]   of planning, but they don't take much.
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:39.420]   These goals are perfectly valid.
[00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:43.840]   There's no reason to have all of your goals be huge and monstrous things.
[00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:48.420]   They can just be simple things that you want to accomplish, feelings you want to have,
[00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:49.420]   etc.
[00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:51.060]   They can also be larger.
[00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:55.660]   So the biggest of the goals that I described is the goal of traveling around the United
[00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:56.660]   States.
[00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:58.100]   Like I said, take a year off.
[00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:01.460]   That's a much more substantial goal.
[00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:03.140]   It requires a lot more planning.
[00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:04.420]   I have to think about my money.
[00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:08.620]   I have to be able to not earn money for a year or have to have some form of income that's
[00:17:08.620 --> 00:17:10.460]   going to come in while I'm traveling.
[00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:12.340]   I need a lot more infrastructure.
[00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:14.500]   I might need an RV if I'm going to RV.
[00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:15.500]   What kind of RV?
[00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:17.520]   There's going to be a whole lot of planning involved with that.
[00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:20.840]   How am I going to make this work with my children and their school schedules and all of these
[00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:21.840]   other things?
[00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:22.840]   Where are we going to go?
[00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:24.180]   What's our trip going to be like?
[00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:28.900]   The United States is a huge place to see the whole country in a year is not possible in
[00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:29.980]   any reasonable way.
[00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:32.580]   So what's going to be the organizing principle of our trip?
[00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:37.420]   Are we going to travel to all 50 states so we can check the box and say we did that?
[00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:41.780]   Are we going to travel to all the national parks so we can check the box and say we did
[00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:42.780]   that?
[00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:44.700]   Are we going to focus on historical areas?
[00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:47.740]   We could go to many regions of the United States and spend months there.
[00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:53.060]   Are we going to focus on natural beauty, on environmental changes, or geography, or cultural
[00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:54.240]   distinctions?
[00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:58.580]   So we're going to have to envision more details and there's going to be a lot more planning
[00:17:58.580 --> 00:17:59.580]   involved.
[00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:02.940]   But there's a different set of planning than going to China.
[00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:05.620]   Going to China means I'm not going to take an RV.
[00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:06.620]   I'm not even going to take a car.
[00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:09.440]   I can't overland in China.
[00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:13.020]   It's very hard for individual travelers, even if they have their own vehicle, to come into
[00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:16.580]   China and bring their own vehicle into China.
[00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:20.860]   And so if I go into China, it's naturally going to involve airplanes, maybe train travel
[00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:23.060]   on the ground there, although I could train travel.
[00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:27.780]   Let's say I wanted to start in London and take the trains to China, I can do that.
[00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:31.860]   It's going to take me some weeks to do that, especially difficult right now because all
[00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:35.860]   the Russian border crossing for trains are basically closed.
[00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:38.820]   But in normal times, then I would be able to take the trains.
[00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:39.900]   That would be a cool adventure.
[00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:42.100]   Or am I going to fly directly into Beijing?
[00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:43.260]   What am I going to do?
[00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:48.820]   And so my point in describing these is that when you envision a destination, then you
[00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:51.580]   start to think about what you're going to do with that destination, what you're going
[00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:52.740]   to mean at that destination.
[00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:56.860]   That destination kind of sets in place the requirements.
[00:18:56.860 --> 00:19:01.000]   And then now you've got to say, do I want to actually do this?
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.180]   Because there's a cost involved with all of these things.
[00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:06.640]   Goal setting is not free.
[00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:11.380]   And so you have to understand the cost that you're going to pay to accomplish a goal.
[00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:15.940]   And as you think about that, think about, do I really want to do this?
[00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:21.620]   Should I really take a year off, spend $100,000 traveling around the United States, not save
[00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:22.860]   money for my retirement?
[00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:25.260]   Is that really something I'm going to do?
[00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:26.900]   Well, for me, yes.
[00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:29.140]   For you, maybe no.
[00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:31.820]   You might have a totally different perspective on this thing.
[00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:33.380]   You just have a different goal.
[00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:43.220]   So recognize that once you've envisioned the goal, and once the goal is fully formed, fully
[00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:52.500]   envisioned, it will guide you in and of itself.
[00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:53.860]   That's the reason we set goals.
[00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:56.780]   Goals keep us on track while we're on our way to their achievement.
[00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:59.700]   They guide us kind of like a GPS does.
[00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:00.980]   The classic example is this.
[00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:06.140]   If you set out from Miami, Florida, and you program in your destination that you're going
[00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:13.420]   to drive to Manhattan, then as you go, you're going to have directions.
[00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:16.860]   And along the way, you're going to meet stumbling blocks, you're going to meet road closures,
[00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:18.620]   you're going to meet all kinds of issues.
[00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:22.340]   But the GPS has programmed in it that we're going to go to Manhattan.
[00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:27.500]   And whether it takes you 19 hours to drive there, or 17 hours to drive there, or 27 hours
[00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:32.180]   to drive there, whether you do it in one day going straight through, or whether you do
[00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:38.660]   it in 10 days going along the way slowly, or whether you get stopped along the way,
[00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:41.620]   whether your car breaks down, et cetera, all of these things are going to happen.
[00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:45.340]   But at the end of the day, if that GPS is programmed that I'm going to Manhattan, it's
[00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:47.300]   going to guide you at every turn.
[00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:50.860]   If the car breaks down, we fix the car and we press on.
[00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:53.460]   If we want to stop along the way, that's fine.
[00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:55.660]   We stop along the way, but we can't press on.
[00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:58.660]   If the road is closed, we take a different turn.
[00:20:58.660 --> 00:20:59.660]   And that's what goals are.
[00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:02.820]   The goal keeps us on track and it orders our life decisions.
[00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:05.300]   We know we want to accomplish this thing.
[00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:07.700]   We want to have this result.
[00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:13.300]   And every obstacle we face is just a normal part of the trip.
[00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:15.020]   There's going to be obstacles.
[00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:16.980]   That's how life is.
[00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:18.860]   Setbacks are normal.
[00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:20.600]   Don't let them detour you.
[00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:22.660]   Don't let them stop you.
[00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:24.940]   Recognize this is normal.
[00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:28.780]   Just like on a trip, you have problems, setbacks, et cetera, it's normal.
[00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:30.540]   The goals keep you on track.
[00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:31.860]   That's why we set them.
[00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:37.340]   So we can make sure that over time, we'll be able to look back and appreciate our progress.
[00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:38.940]   More on that in a little bit.
[00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:43.300]   Your goals should always be exciting to you.
[00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:46.980]   Whatever they are, they should be things that are important to you.
[00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:48.780]   Exciting sometimes is too strong of a word.
[00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:51.020]   Some people connect really strongly with emotion.
[00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:52.020]   Some people don't.
[00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:53.420]   I myself am more emotional.
[00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:57.740]   So I tend to think in terms of excitement and passion and enthusiasm, et cetera.
[00:21:57.740 --> 00:21:59.300]   Some people are not.
[00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:02.700]   Many people have much more calm, sanguine personalities.
[00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:03.820]   Totally fine.
[00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:08.220]   Just choose things that you care about, things that are important to you.
[00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:09.740]   Your life is very short.
[00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:13.460]   Why should you spend it working on things that aren't important to you?
[00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:17.820]   Spend it focusing on things that are important to you.
[00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:20.140]   Back to New Year's resolutions.
[00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:24.900]   One of the common jokes that people make about New Year's resolutions is about how the majority
[00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:30.740]   of New Year's resolutions are not kept.
[00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:33.780]   And people don't like to be failures.
[00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:39.220]   One significant reason people don't set goals is because they're afraid of failure.
[00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:44.300]   There are other reasons, but I want to talk about this.
[00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:51.660]   Failure in reaching goals is no big deal.
[00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:53.340]   In fact, it's more than that.
[00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:54.340]   It's expected.
[00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:55.940]   It's inevitable.
[00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:57.620]   Failure is inevitable.
[00:22:57.620 --> 00:23:00.140]   It's no big deal.
[00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:03.100]   Now let's start with some basic ground rules.
[00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:11.300]   To begin with, I am convinced that if your mind can conceive and believe a goal, it can
[00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:13.060]   achieve it.
[00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:20.860]   If you can conceive and believe a goal, I believe you can achieve it.
[00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:27.620]   The restriction here is not on what's possible for everyone in the world.
[00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:33.340]   The restriction here is on what you believe is possible for you, on what you conceive
[00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:34.860]   and what you believe.
[00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:41.060]   Let me give you the best examples I can come up with.
[00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:47.340]   It is impossible for me to be the world's greatest horse jockey.
[00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:49.860]   It is impossible.
[00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:56.540]   I am far too large, far too heavy, and have zero experience riding horses.
[00:23:56.540 --> 00:24:04.300]   For me, at my age, to set a goal of being a horse jockey would be to set a goal of something
[00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:07.700]   that's completely impossible.
[00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:13.820]   But the good thing is I have zero interest in being a winning horse jockey.
[00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:19.420]   My mind has never conceived and believed of that as being a goal that I want.
[00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:21.900]   Have no interest in it.
[00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:25.700]   Now if there were something else related to horses, certainly I could achieve that.
[00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:28.460]   If I wanted to own a horse, I could achieve that.
[00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:32.300]   If I wanted to be a skilled horseman, I could achieve that.
[00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:38.000]   All of those distinctions about me, my age, I could take lessons.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.260]   No reason I couldn't learn to ride.
[00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:40.260]   Lots of people learn to ride.
[00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:44.940]   My size, I'll buy a Clydesdale and have that for a saddle horse.
[00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:45.980]   Many people have done it.
[00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:46.980]   No big deal.
[00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:51.020]   So I can solve for anything that my mind can conceive and believe.
[00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:54.260]   I've never conceived and believed being a horse jockey.
[00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:58.660]   So if you're worried about your ability to conceive and believe a goal and you say, "Well,
[00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:00.140]   not everybody can achieve everything."
[00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:05.060]   Of course not everybody can achieve everything, but you can achieve any goal that you conceive
[00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:08.200]   of and believe in.
[00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:14.180]   Your brain is not going to feed you a goal that is beyond your capacity to reach it.
[00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:20.380]   Your brain is automatically going to filter your personal goals and ambitions by your
[00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:26.420]   experience, your exposure, your resources, et cetera.
[00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:31.860]   And you're not going to be bothered in the least by the things that you can't achieve
[00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:39.580]   if you're focused on the things you're excited to achieve.
[00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:41.620]   Goal setting is a skill.
[00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:49.380]   As you conceive of and believe the goals that you can set now, and as your skill of accomplishing
[00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:56.980]   those goals increases, then the size of the goals that you can conceive of and believe
[00:25:56.980 --> 00:26:03.220]   will be bigger and you'll be able to move towards those things.
[00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:10.280]   So if you can conceive of and if you can believe in a goal that you want to set for yourself,
[00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:13.740]   I'm convinced you can achieve it.
[00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:20.940]   Now on that basis, if you can conceive and believe a goal, there are no unrealistic goals,
[00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:24.660]   but there are unrealistic timelines.
[00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:28.900]   And I think this is the key factor that derails most goal setting.
[00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:35.120]   There are no unrealistic goals, but there are unrealistic timelines.
[00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:43.440]   As human beings, we tend to think so short term that we ignore the progress we can make
[00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:47.440]   if we add just a little bit more time.
[00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:50.420]   Conceive and believe in your goals.
[00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:55.100]   Put them on a timeline, and if you don't reach it, don't give up on the goal.
[00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:59.300]   Just ask yourself, "Did I set a realistic timeline?"
[00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:03.740]   This has been my biggest failure throughout life in reaching my goals.
[00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:09.220]   I've often been good at conceiving and believing goals.
[00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:10.500]   Goals that were right for me.
[00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:12.100]   Goals that I chose.
[00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:15.540]   Goals that I truly was capable of accomplishing.
[00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:19.100]   I just seem to never hit them on time.
[00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:21.980]   I'm always a little bit after the goal setting.
[00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:25.260]   And then I would get frustrated, or a little bit after the deadline that I set.
[00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:28.660]   Then I get frustrated and annoyed and I say, "But I set this goal and I really wanted to
[00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:29.660]   accomplish it."
[00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:33.780]   And I wake up a few months later or a few years later, and I did accomplish it.
[00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:42.420]   I just didn't accomplish it by the hyper-aggressive deadline that I had set for myself.
[00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:47.660]   This is why you need to always make sure that you're looking forward to the process of achieving
[00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:50.220]   the goal.
[00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:56.140]   One of the lessons I have learned that I'm sharing to help you is that when I was younger
[00:27:56.140 --> 00:28:02.220]   I thought that the reason to set goals was to accomplish the goals.
[00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:09.220]   But then I accomplished the goals that I set and I realized that the high, the emotional
[00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:16.540]   high was a very temporary phenomenon.
[00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:18.820]   Think about your own life.
[00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:27.980]   Every goal that you've set was a temporary phenomenon, meaning the emotional experience.
[00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:33.180]   The best almost universal example I would give is something like high school graduation.
[00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:39.740]   You spend 12 years in the US system, 12 years looking forward to this thing called high
[00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:41.920]   school graduation.
[00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:45.500]   You're told that if you don't graduate from high school you're guaranteed to be a loser
[00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:46.860]   in life.
[00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:48.700]   You're told it's a big deal.
[00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:52.260]   You spend all your time thinking about your grades and keeping your grades up and going
[00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:57.620]   through this pre-planned curriculum that someone has laid out for you.
[00:28:57.620 --> 00:29:00.580]   Along the way somebody tells you that the reason you're graduating high school is so
[00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:03.940]   you can go to college, but you still understand that this is a big deal.
[00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:07.160]   I got to graduate high school.
[00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:10.140]   And then for most of us, we did it.
[00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:11.740]   We graduated high school.
[00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:15.900]   I can remember that euphoria of finishing classes.
[00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:17.460]   My senior year I went on a senior class trip.
[00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:20.960]   So we got to finish classes several weeks earlier than we went on a big senior class
[00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:21.960]   trip.
[00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:26.860]   Finished up our senior class trip, came back, had all of our senior week excitement and
[00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:30.700]   joy and then the graduation ceremony and you have all these parties and you're going to
[00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:32.860]   your friend's parties, et cetera.
[00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:36.940]   You accomplish it.
[00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:37.940]   And then what?
[00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:43.140]   A couple of weeks later you're on to the next thing.
[00:29:43.140 --> 00:29:50.100]   The emotional high fades away and you realize that the graduation was in some ways totally
[00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:52.540]   meaningless.
[00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:53.540]   How was it meaningless?
[00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:58.740]   Well, for most of us, that graduation was just necessary to tick the box to go on to
[00:29:58.740 --> 00:30:01.620]   what our real goal was going to be, to get a college degree, right?
[00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:03.660]   Because now you're going to be a loser if you don't get a college degree.
[00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:08.220]   That's why I went to college, my opinion at that time.
[00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:09.300]   Only losers didn't go to college.
[00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:11.020]   I wasn't a loser so I was going to go to college.
[00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:15.220]   Of course, it was just an automatic thing.
[00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:17.540]   Question was not if I went to college or not.
[00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:20.560]   The question was simply where to go to college and what to study.
[00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:25.340]   So you realize, oh, that goal was just necessary to get me on to the next goal.
[00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:33.100]   What's interesting is you look back in hindsight, not a single time have I ever given any evidence
[00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:36.740]   of any kind of my having a high school diploma.
[00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:37.740]   Not once.
[00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:40.340]   No job interview has ever come up.
[00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:43.460]   No, I've never submitted my high school diploma.
[00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:48.860]   I've never gone and gotten my high school transcript in any way.
[00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:52.540]   I guess in theory maybe I must have gotten it for my college admission.
[00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:53.540]   So maybe that was wrong.
[00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:54.540]   I must have submitted that.
[00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:58.580]   But since then, the point, like what I mean is in the real world, quote unquote, the job
[00:30:58.580 --> 00:31:03.900]   world, et cetera, I think it's just always been assumed that I had a high school diploma.
[00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:08.580]   And so it really has not, other than getting into college, which didn't, the high school
[00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:09.580]   diploma wasn't necessary.
[00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:11.140]   It's just never been that big of a factor.
[00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:13.940]   So you can look at your goals, accomplishment, you say that was such a big deal.
[00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:15.700]   Now it's not a big deal.
[00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:18.980]   But you're going to flip it on the other side and you say, well, it was a step on the way.
[00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:21.580]   So the next one is we go on and get to college.
[00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:23.980]   Okay, got to get to college.
[00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:24.980]   Get into college.
[00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:26.260]   I get my SATs up.
[00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:29.940]   Got to make sure I get my college acceptance, you know, my accepted into the college I want.
[00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:30.940]   Then you get into college.
[00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:32.340]   Got to make sure I study what I want.
[00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:33.340]   Got to graduate college.
[00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:34.980]   And again, the same kind of thing.
[00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:38.940]   Going on to this goal accomplishment.
[00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:40.220]   And then you get to graduation.
[00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:41.220]   You get your diploma.
[00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:42.220]   Boom, I did it.
[00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:43.220]   I went to college.
[00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:44.700]   But then there's another goal.
[00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:48.700]   And you have that euphoria and then that loss of euphoria.
[00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:54.380]   Doesn't have to be a negative thing, but you have euphoria and then loss of euphoria.
[00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:56.200]   This happens with everything.
[00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:58.060]   After college, it's getting a job.
[00:31:58.060 --> 00:32:00.660]   Once you get one job, you got to get another job.
[00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:03.660]   Once you get a job, want to get married or you want to buy a house or you want to get
[00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:07.700]   a dog or you want to get out of debt or you want to make $100,000 or you want to make
[00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:11.100]   a million dollars or you want to save $100,000 or you want to save a million dollars or you
[00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:12.860]   want to save $10 million.
[00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:22.280]   At every single stage, the goals have a momentary high of achievement followed by the elimination
[00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:27.300]   of that high very, very quickly.
[00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:33.820]   So once you go through this for a while, you got to recognize that the accomplishment,
[00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:43.180]   the certification of accomplishment cannot be the goal.
[00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:51.900]   The journey and the process has to be the goal.
[00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:57.640]   With that insight, the way that I frame goal setting for myself and my children is not
[00:32:57.640 --> 00:33:05.460]   in accomplishing a certain thing, but in becoming a certain kind of person.
[00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:06.460]   Why do we do school?
[00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:07.460]   Why do we study?
[00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:15.500]   Well, I need to transform my children into learners, into students, into effective learners
[00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:17.180]   and students.
[00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:22.980]   I need to give them the basic skills that they need to teach themselves the things that
[00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:25.260]   they need to know in life.
[00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:28.540]   That's the purpose of school.
[00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:30.860]   Then why do I need those tools?
[00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:36.780]   Because with those tools, any dream that they want to accomplish, they will be able to teach
[00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:42.820]   themselves the necessary things in order to accomplish their goals and their dreams.
[00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:49.540]   And we use certifications along the way as markers that indicate that we're making progress
[00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:54.100]   on this pathway.
[00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:56.940]   Why is the goal of getting out of debt important?
[00:33:56.940 --> 00:34:04.580]   Well, if someone is in debt, very frequently they're in debt because of financial mismanagement.
[00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:12.180]   And so the process of getting out of debt is necessary in order for someone to go from
[00:34:12.180 --> 00:34:18.620]   someone who manages money poorly to someone who manages money effectively.
[00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:23.980]   And if you can accomplish that transformation of someone who manages money, going from someone
[00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:29.420]   who manages money poorly to someone who manages money effectively, then in the fullness of
[00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:35.780]   time, that skill set will allow you to reach the very heights of wealth.
[00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:39.620]   And by the way, this thinking applies to basically everything.
[00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:43.220]   What if somebody is not in debt because of poor financial mismanagement, but because
[00:34:43.220 --> 00:34:44.220]   of poor earnings?
[00:34:44.220 --> 00:34:45.900]   It happens a lot.
[00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:48.460]   Someone goes into debt because I just don't earn enough money.
[00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:54.980]   Well, setting the goal of getting out of debt will necessarily require you to build a skill
[00:34:54.980 --> 00:35:00.900]   of earning higher money in order to accomplish the goal of getting out of debt.
[00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:04.460]   And so the certification is useful and is important because the certification is what
[00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:06.320]   we can envision.
[00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:12.020]   The certification is how we know we've done it, but we need to look forward to the process
[00:35:12.020 --> 00:35:13.660]   of becoming the person.
[00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:22.600]   And then the best goals are those in which the journey itself is exciting.
[00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:26.900]   The journey is the important part of the goal.
[00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:31.860]   Let me share my biggest area of failure and what I've learned from it.
[00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:37.280]   My biggest area of failure has always been being fat.
[00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:40.200]   And it's plagued me since I was in middle school.
[00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:41.300]   I was fat then.
[00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:42.520]   I've been more fat.
[00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:43.600]   I've been less fat.
[00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:45.040]   I've been very fat.
[00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:46.520]   I've been skinny fat.
[00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:50.600]   I've been various ranges of fat along the way.
[00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:56.640]   I've gained and lost weight about a bazillion times in many different ways, et cetera.
[00:35:56.640 --> 00:36:04.360]   But the failure, the single biggest failure for me in goal setting about not being fat
[00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:11.320]   has been not understanding how to enjoy the journey and setting end destinations that
[00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:15.960]   weren't truly my end destinations.
[00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:21.320]   And I think this is common to most fat people.
[00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:28.360]   One of the big distinctions between fat people and non-fat people, I guess there are probably
[00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:34.360]   a few that are common, but the couple that are the most important revolve around food
[00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:38.280]   and exercise or movement.
[00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:45.120]   Fat people often view food as a reward.
[00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:51.080]   Non-fat people have a lesser or a different connection to food.
[00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:53.960]   They don't all, right?
[00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:58.920]   You'll see lots of people who are very fit who will say, "Well, I work out so I can eat
[00:36:58.920 --> 00:36:59.920]   brownies."
[00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:00.960]   Okay, maybe it's true.
[00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:06.960]   But somewhere along the way, fit people have figured out how to use food as fuel or not
[00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:09.520]   to see it as the ultimate reward.
[00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:12.640]   Whereas fat people often see food as the reward.
[00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:15.940]   A lot of times we're conditioned that way.
[00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:17.960]   We see, "Hey, you did a great job.
[00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:18.960]   Here's a cookie.
[00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:20.680]   Here's a cake," et cetera.
[00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:24.640]   My biggest fear in life is having fat children.
[00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:30.480]   This is going to be an extravagant statement, but I mean it, but it's hyperbole.
[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:31.480]   Hyperbole alert, right?
[00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:37.680]   I should add a tone to that.
[00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:48.960]   I am persuaded that having fat children is a form of child abuse.
[00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:50.840]   Maybe a mild form of child abuse.
[00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:55.280]   Obviously I'm being hyperbolic, but I am persuaded that that's how it should be thought of.
[00:37:55.280 --> 00:38:00.960]   Having fat children is a form of child abuse.
[00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:05.520]   Because I was a fat kid, I understand that firsthand and I have watched it and observed
[00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:08.680]   it firsthand, secondhand my entire life.
[00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:11.520]   My biggest fear as a parent is having fat children.
[00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:13.800]   I think a lot about this question.
[00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:15.600]   How do I avoid having fat children?
[00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:18.480]   One way is change your relationship with food.
[00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:19.480]   Food is not a reward.
[00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:21.600]   I'm not going to give every food as a reward.
[00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:23.760]   It's just food.
[00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:28.120]   The other aspect is movement.
[00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:29.840]   There's skill development here.
[00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:36.800]   Fit people generally find movement to be a rewarding thing, whereas fat people don't
[00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:40.120]   find movement to be a rewarding thing.
[00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:44.200]   For fat people, movement is a chore.
[00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:45.200]   It's a hard thing.
[00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:46.400]   It's a difficult thing.
[00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:48.240]   It's not something that they like.
[00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:52.600]   There's no aspect of what they like.
[00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:56.680]   Because they don't like it, they don't build skill around movement.
[00:38:56.680 --> 00:39:00.400]   Because they don't have skill around movement, they don't like it because they're not good
[00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:02.080]   at it.
[00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:08.040]   Whereas fit people, because they have skill around movement, they're good at it and it
[00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:12.480]   feels good when they move and they do active things.
[00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:13.480]   It feels good.
[00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:14.480]   They do more of it, et cetera.
[00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:17.960]   They get in this positive feedback loop.
[00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:24.200]   If you think about this issue that fat people face, you have to basically figure out strategies
[00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:27.720]   to where they look forward to the journey.
[00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:33.000]   You have to figure out how do I change the relationship with food and how do I change
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:38.520]   the relationship with movement so that I can become a different person.
[00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:46.000]   When I've reflected on years of failure in this area, I've realized that these are the
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:47.840]   essentials.
[00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:54.160]   I now think if working with fat people and you're trying to help fat people become less
[00:39:54.160 --> 00:40:00.800]   fat, then the first thing you have to do is not take away food but to add food.
[00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:07.200]   I think you have to focus primarily on adding food, on adding good food, on adding rich
[00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:10.840]   food, on adding delicious food.
[00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:16.920]   If you start with that, you can develop an appropriate pleasure center.
[00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:24.200]   For example, I personally think that it's probably the case that a calorie is a calorie.
[00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:30.120]   All the best academic research I can find is basically, even though people fight about
[00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:34.480]   it, I'm personally mostly convinced that a calorie is a calorie.
[00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:37.720]   If you want to lose weight, it's calories in, calories out.
[00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:41.680]   The problem is that all calories in are not created equal.
[00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:50.680]   Diets that have people eating luxurious foods as a lifestyle are diets that have a higher
[00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:54.000]   kind of stickiness for fat people.
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:58.960]   If I'm coaching me or I'm coaching someone else on weight loss, what I want to focus
[00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:04.080]   on is how can we add really high quality nutrition that's very satiating.
[00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:10.400]   This is where steaks, high fat foods, high protein foods, luxurious foods, steak, butter,
[00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:16.160]   eggs, things that are satiating, I think are really effective, maybe not for all people
[00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:19.640]   but for many people because you're focusing on what you can add in.
[00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:25.480]   Then you start to add in nutrition, higher foods with more nutrition, starts to solve
[00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:27.280]   deficiencies, et cetera.
[00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:29.700]   Don't worry about calorie excess for a while.
[00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:35.280]   Calorie excess can be solved down the road when you have a focus on what I can eat rather
[00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:37.200]   than what I can't eat.
[00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:42.080]   When you tell a fat person, "Here's what you can't do, you can't avoid these foods," that
[00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:46.640]   fat person has gotten dopamine hit from those foods forever.
[00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:50.800]   You've got to retrain the dopamine system and get a person focused on what they can
[00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:55.240]   eat and have them looking forward to eating and cause the change over time.
[00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:58.560]   I didn't mean to go into this so deep but of course, New Year's resolution for a lot
[00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:00.760]   of people is lose weight.
[00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:04.200]   I believe it's important to focus on the journey.
[00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:12.200]   What I'm intending to emphasize is that having a journey that seems pleasurable to you is
[00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:13.640]   the most important part of the goal.
[00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:16.840]   Let me finish it out with movement and then we'll go back to a couple of other examples.
[00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:19.600]   Same thing with movement.
[00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:22.480]   Fat people are unskilled with movement.
[00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:25.000]   They don't like to move.
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:27.240]   Walking is not pleasurable.
[00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:29.280]   Running hurts.
[00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:34.920]   Weightlifting makes them feel uncomfortable, etc.
[00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:41.440]   One of the keys is, can I find a movement that is appealing to a fat person?
[00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:42.440]   Sometimes you can.
[00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:45.920]   Some people might want to go walk on the beach.
[00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:47.340]   Walking for me is motivating.
[00:42:47.340 --> 00:42:49.640]   I like to walk.
[00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:53.640]   I'm a competent walker and I like the things that I can get with walk.
[00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:56.400]   I like how I can bring walking into socialization.
[00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:59.360]   I like how I can walk and listen to audio.
[00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:02.160]   I like how I can walk and think.
[00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:04.280]   Walking is good for me.
[00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:07.120]   Sometimes people can't walk effectively.
[00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:09.120]   Sometimes people can't work out.
[00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:12.680]   Then you just have to say, "What can you bear?
[00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:14.280]   What can you deal with?"
[00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:17.440]   And find the minimum effective dose of what you can deal with.
[00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:20.680]   And then over time, skill will build and you can build pleasure over time.
[00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:25.400]   But you got to find things where the journey is not so onerous that you're not going to
[00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:26.400]   want to do it.
[00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:31.320]   And the best goals, the goals that you're almost certain to hit, are the goals where
[00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:37.240]   you're excited about accomplishing the thing and where you're excited about the process
[00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:38.240]   of it.
[00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:41.080]   Let me go back to college for a second.
[00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:46.960]   I believe that the people who should go to college are those who are academically capable.
[00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:51.480]   And one of the greatest problems of college statistics is that many people who are not
[00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:56.640]   academically capable have been conditioned to think that they need to go to college in
[00:43:56.640 --> 00:43:58.000]   order to succeed.
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:01.120]   And they go and they try and they try and they try and then they quit.
[00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:04.840]   The people who do well in college are people who enjoy studying because they're skilled
[00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:05.840]   at it.
[00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:06.840]   I study for fun.
[00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:08.440]   I enjoy it.
[00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:11.800]   I enjoy the process of making my brain work.
[00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:14.760]   And that's an effective thing.
[00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:18.600]   Athletes enjoy the process of making their bodies work.
[00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:22.280]   So you've got to focus on setting goals where the journey is exciting to you.
[00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:24.120]   You talk to travelers.
[00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:28.060]   Travelers enjoy people who go to every country in the world or travel just constantly.
[00:44:28.060 --> 00:44:29.680]   They enjoy the process of travel.
[00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:31.360]   I'll speak as a traveler.
[00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:34.000]   I love being on airplanes.
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   I enjoy it.
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   It's not to say that there's no stress involved.
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:40.200]   Certainly you get to the end of a 15-hour flight, you're ready to get off the plane.
[00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:44.400]   But every time I drive past an airport, every time I see airplanes on the tarmac, I wish
[00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:45.680]   I were on them.
[00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:48.280]   When I see a train, I wish I was on it.
[00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:51.960]   When I see a car, I think about how many countries I could take that car to.
[00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:55.880]   I'm drawn to the journey, not the destination.
[00:44:55.880 --> 00:44:58.080]   The destination is just an excuse.
[00:44:58.080 --> 00:45:00.080]   I'm drawn to the journey.
[00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:05.460]   And you'll find that the goals that you'll accomplish the most easily are those in which
[00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:10.160]   you're drawn to the journey of their accomplishment.
[00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:16.820]   And if you're setting a goal that's not a natural fit for you, you've got to re-engineer
[00:45:16.820 --> 00:45:23.000]   and come back and say, "Am I excited about the journey, about the process of accomplishing
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:24.000]   it?"
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:30.200]   This is one of the reasons I'm so opposed to early retirement in the current iteration
[00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:31.200]   that was super popular.
[00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:35.060]   I've noticed its popularity waning a little bit, and I've noticed a little bit of my message
[00:45:35.060 --> 00:45:39.040]   that has been a bit countercultural to the FIRE community for the last 10 years.
[00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:42.520]   I've noticed that my message seems to be a little bit more mainstream now.
[00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:43.860]   So I'm glad about it.
[00:45:43.860 --> 00:45:49.520]   But when I got excited about the FIRE movement myself, it was because I didn't like my job.
[00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:52.440]   And I thought, "Oh, I'll just go and I'll work a job I don't—I'll work this job I
[00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:56.220]   don't like, I'll live like a miser, I'll make a lot of money, and I'll be financially independent
[00:45:56.220 --> 00:45:57.220]   in no time.
[00:45:57.220 --> 00:46:00.840]   Then I'll accomplish my goal."
[00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:03.520]   That's what I got excited about.
[00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:06.560]   But I failed at that.
[00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:10.000]   Because I realized it was a stupid way to approach it.
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:16.280]   The people who achieve financial independence are generally people who enjoy working.
[00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:18.140]   They enjoy making money.
[00:46:18.140 --> 00:46:19.980]   They enjoy their life.
[00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:23.020]   And financial independence is not the end result.
[00:46:23.020 --> 00:46:25.840]   It's just a natural thing that happens because of having those things.
[00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:32.240]   And I realized that the goal of finding a job you enjoy is much more achievable than
[00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:36.920]   the goal of working a job you hate, living a lifestyle you hate for five years or 10
[00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:48.280]   years or something just muscling through so that you can accomplish a certain thing.
[00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:56.840]   Don't commit yourself to a goal whose journey of accomplishment is not exciting to you in
[00:46:56.840 --> 00:46:59.160]   and of itself.
[00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:05.640]   I think that's a sign that either this goal is not for me, this goal is not for me now,
[00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:10.440]   or this goal is for me and is for me now, I just need to spend more time being careful
[00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:14.120]   and intelligent about how I accomplish it.
[00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:16.400]   Because accomplishing the goal is not the end result.
[00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:18.840]   The goal is to become a different person.
[00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:22.520]   And if you can become a different person, then the achievement of the goal will just
[00:47:22.520 --> 00:47:27.000]   feel like one more step along the process.
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:30.400]   And you'll already be excited about moving on to the next bigger goals.
[00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:36.960]   Now, if you fail at achieving your goal, so what?
[00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:39.480]   So what?
[00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:45.980]   Why can I, in front of tens of thousands of people, so easily admit that I have failed
[00:47:45.980 --> 00:47:47.480]   at unfatting myself?
[00:47:47.480 --> 00:47:52.280]   Well, it doesn't make me proud.
[00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:55.640]   But so what?
[00:47:55.640 --> 00:47:58.200]   So what?
[00:47:58.200 --> 00:48:01.960]   It's fine to assess your progress towards your end goal, but it's more important to
[00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:05.440]   assess your progress from where you began.
[00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:12.520]   And if I had never set the goal of not being fat, I would never have accomplished all that
[00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:15.040]   I have accomplished.
[00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:16.120]   Let's give an example.
[00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:19.560]   Let's say that you set a New Year's resolution to go to the gym in the next year.
[00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:25.040]   You sign up for classes, you make a schedule, you go to the gym 15 times in January, you
[00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:30.880]   go to the gym 15 times in February, then you quit.
[00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:31.880]   This is common in gyms, right?
[00:48:31.880 --> 00:48:34.480]   This is how gyms make their money.
[00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:36.640]   Is that failure?
[00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:37.640]   I don't think so.
[00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:39.520]   I think you redefine it.
[00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:43.080]   You got in 30 workouts.
[00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:44.080]   I don't think that's a failure.
[00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:45.800]   You worked out 30 times.
[00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:48.040]   You learned some new skills.
[00:48:48.040 --> 00:48:52.520]   You collected data about what works for you and what doesn't work for you.
[00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:56.440]   You exercised your mental muscles to move you in the direction of your goals.
[00:48:56.440 --> 00:49:00.040]   You exercised courage to believe that you could be the kind of person who could go to
[00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:03.200]   a gym and do work while you're there.
[00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:05.680]   You're better off than you were before.
[00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:12.240]   And so when I look back at where I started from, I know loads more today about health
[00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:13.240]   and nutrition.
[00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:15.640]   I know loads more about exercise.
[00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:18.000]   I've put in thousands of miles.
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:21.200]   I've put in hundreds and hundreds of workouts.
[00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:22.600]   I've lifted thousands of pounds.
[00:49:22.600 --> 00:49:25.640]   I've built skills in many ways.
[00:49:25.640 --> 00:49:30.080]   Just because I haven't achieved my ultimate goal doesn't mean that I haven't been improved
[00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:33.520]   by the process of working towards it.
[00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:39.080]   I just didn't yet develop all the skills necessary to accomplish that ultimate goal.
[00:49:39.080 --> 00:49:42.600]   But I'm still in the game.
[00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:46.920]   And the only way that you fail is if you quit.
[00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:54.800]   The only way it's possible to fail at reaching your goals is when you quit.
[00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:56.960]   And for me, I don't quit.
[00:49:56.960 --> 00:50:03.560]   So I'd rather talk about my failures and learn from them than deal with the idea of being
[00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:06.200]   a quitter.
[00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:10.240]   Because my success in life is not tied to the number of pounds reflected on the scale
[00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:13.520]   or the size of my love handles.
[00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:15.560]   These are reflective of other things.
[00:50:15.560 --> 00:50:21.240]   I just haven't yet built the skills, the routines necessary to accomplish it.
[00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:24.520]   By the way, if you're worried about it, I'm making great progress.
[00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:25.520]   I've got a coach.
[00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:26.520]   I'm making great progress.
[00:50:26.520 --> 00:50:29.080]   I've got great streaks going.
[00:50:29.080 --> 00:50:31.680]   Every indicator is in the right direction.
[00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:35.000]   But I have had to learn over the years from all of these failures.
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:37.760]   And you try something, learn from it.
[00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:38.760]   Try, learn.
[00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:39.760]   Try, learn.
[00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:42.200]   Try, learn.
[00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:51.840]   No matter what, any goal that you set and you work towards, that's success.
[00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:56.160]   Because you're exercising the muscle.
[00:50:56.160 --> 00:51:00.480]   Accomplishing the goal is not the only acceptable outcome.
[00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:03.600]   There are many other acceptable outcomes.
[00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:07.040]   Working towards a goal is a perfectly acceptable outcome.
[00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:12.080]   Let's say that you set a lifetime goal that's very large and you're working towards it systematically.
[00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:16.320]   Let's say that you're a golfer and you say, "I'm going to golf the top 100 golf courses
[00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:17.320]   in the world."
[00:51:17.320 --> 00:51:19.320]   You print out the list from your golf magazine.
[00:51:19.320 --> 00:51:20.760]   You staple it to your wall.
[00:51:20.760 --> 00:51:21.760]   You start checking them off.
[00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:23.760]   You say, "I'm going to do two a year."
[00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:25.800]   That's a great goal for a golfer.
[00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:27.360]   You do two a year.
[00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:29.640]   It gives you an organizing principle to your life.
[00:51:29.640 --> 00:51:31.680]   This is going to organize my vacations.
[00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:34.320]   I'm going to go to two golf courses a year.
[00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:36.280]   It's probably a very enjoyable thing.
[00:51:36.280 --> 00:51:37.280]   You want to play well.
[00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:38.920]   So now you've got a focus to your practice.
[00:51:38.920 --> 00:51:40.400]   You're improving your technique.
[00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:41.800]   It's a wonderful social goal.
[00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:43.560]   You probably have some buddies that you're working towards.
[00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:45.520]   A great organizing financial goal.
[00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:46.680]   You're going to need to save for this.
[00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:50.040]   If you become a saver and you're working towards these golf vacations, that's going to help
[00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:51.040]   you transform your finances.
[00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:53.840]   You're going to earn more money so you can afford the more expensive fees.
[00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:56.880]   You're going to meet fancier people if you need to get into a certain private club or
[00:51:56.880 --> 00:51:58.560]   get an invitation somewhere, etc.
[00:51:58.560 --> 00:51:59.800]   This is a great goal.
[00:51:59.800 --> 00:52:03.360]   Let's say that you set that lifetime goal that's very large and you're working towards
[00:52:03.360 --> 00:52:04.360]   it systematically.
[00:52:04.360 --> 00:52:13.240]   Then all of a sudden you up and die at 50 and half your list is unaccomplished.
[00:52:13.240 --> 00:52:18.440]   Imagine what all those people are going to say at your funeral.
[00:52:18.440 --> 00:52:20.200]   They're going to come to your funeral.
[00:52:20.200 --> 00:52:24.120]   They're going to stand up at the microphone and they're going to say, "What a sucker Joe
[00:52:24.120 --> 00:52:25.120]   was.
[00:52:25.120 --> 00:52:30.960]   Joe set a goal of going to 100 golf courses and that loser only got to 50 and then he
[00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:31.960]   up and died.
[00:52:31.960 --> 00:52:36.240]   What a sucker that dude was.
[00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:37.240]   Loser Joe.
[00:52:37.240 --> 00:52:38.240]   Oh man."
[00:52:38.240 --> 00:52:42.760]   Of course not.
[00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:45.840]   Of course not.
[00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:48.920]   Every single one of your friends is going to talk about the good times.
[00:52:48.920 --> 00:52:52.520]   They're going to tell the story of when you golfed at Pebble Beach or you were at, I don't
[00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:54.760]   even know all the famous golf clubs, not my deal.
[00:52:54.760 --> 00:52:58.240]   But they're going to tell the stories of where you went.
[00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:02.600]   They're going to tell how you fell in the water when you hit the ball wrong.
[00:53:02.600 --> 00:53:05.520]   They're going to tell of when you ran from the alligator in South Florida.
[00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:08.400]   They're going to tell of when you froze golfing in Scotland.
[00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:12.000]   They're going to laugh about how you drank too many beers at the 19th hole and you had
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:13.760]   to sleep at the clubhouse.
[00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:18.960]   They're just going to tell all the stories about your life and enjoy talking about it.
[00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:25.480]   They're going to admire you that you were working on this list of 100 goals or 100 courses.
[00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:30.520]   It's the same for every kind of goal.
[00:53:30.520 --> 00:53:36.040]   Life is not a binary yes or no, win or lose kind of thing.
[00:53:36.040 --> 00:53:37.720]   It's a journey.
[00:53:37.720 --> 00:53:43.720]   Big goals that are exciting to you, that transform you, so you don't reach them.
[00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:48.000]   You're better off just working towards them.
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:52.120]   Let's pretend that I never have a six pack.
[00:53:52.120 --> 00:53:55.640]   I never grace the cover of a men's magazine.
[00:53:55.640 --> 00:54:03.440]   It's very unlikely, but am I not better off for being out there exercising?
[00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:08.880]   Am I not better off for the hundreds and thousands of miles walked with my wife and the time
[00:54:08.880 --> 00:54:10.360]   that we spend together?
[00:54:10.360 --> 00:54:14.080]   Am I not better off for the time with my children out hiking in the woods?
[00:54:14.080 --> 00:54:17.440]   Am I not better off for going to the beach and playing in the sunshine?
[00:54:17.440 --> 00:54:20.600]   Am I not better off for going to the gym and working it out?
[00:54:20.600 --> 00:54:23.400]   Am I not better off for the time spent with my coaches?
[00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:27.560]   Am I not better off for improving my diet and maximizing everything that I can, even
[00:54:27.560 --> 00:54:32.040]   if I never have a six pack?
[00:54:32.040 --> 00:54:37.120]   Am I not better off for learning from my issues with food, from when I was a fat kid and ate
[00:54:37.120 --> 00:54:41.600]   all the junky food and then helping my children to avoid that and sharing the lessons with
[00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:42.600]   them?
[00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:46.560]   Am I not better off for talking to you and to the many fat people in my audience who
[00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:50.160]   want to lose weight and saying and sharing some of the things that I've learned?
[00:54:50.160 --> 00:54:53.920]   Am I not better off for the compassion that I've gained along the way for the things that
[00:54:53.920 --> 00:54:56.600]   don't come easily to me?
[00:54:56.600 --> 00:54:58.320]   Imagine if I just had everything great, right?
[00:54:58.320 --> 00:55:00.140]   My brain works pretty well.
[00:55:00.140 --> 00:55:03.680]   Never struggled with anything involving intelligence.
[00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:09.720]   I have a lot of abilities, but what if I didn't have an area where I wasn't great?
[00:55:09.720 --> 00:55:11.360]   Imagine the ego and the pride.
[00:55:11.360 --> 00:55:14.940]   Imagine how hard that would make it for me to relate to.
[00:55:14.940 --> 00:55:19.980]   But I've always had sympathy on fat people and ugly people, on handicapped people, et
[00:55:19.980 --> 00:55:24.580]   cetera, because of my life experience.
[00:55:24.580 --> 00:55:28.480]   So don't judge it and say to yourself, "I'm not going to have the courage to press forward."
[00:55:28.480 --> 00:55:40.020]   Recognize that if you set a goal of reaching 100 and you get to 20 and then you're done.
[00:55:40.020 --> 00:55:45.660]   The people at your funeral are not going to laugh at you.
[00:55:45.660 --> 00:55:50.980]   They're going to be proud of you because you set out an ambitious goal and you work towards
[00:55:50.980 --> 00:55:54.180]   it.
[00:55:54.180 --> 00:55:56.740]   What are some other ways of not achieving a goal?
[00:55:56.740 --> 00:55:59.340]   Well, what if you change your goals?
[00:55:59.340 --> 00:56:05.300]   It's one of the best things that can happen to you.
[00:56:05.300 --> 00:56:09.620]   You set a goal, you start working towards it.
[00:56:09.620 --> 00:56:13.140]   Then you realize, "I don't want this goal."
[00:56:13.140 --> 00:56:16.980]   I'll give you a couple of examples from my life, little and big.
[00:56:16.980 --> 00:56:20.740]   When I was younger and I first started setting goals, one of the goals I had was I wanted
[00:56:20.740 --> 00:56:22.820]   a black Harley Davidson.
[00:56:22.820 --> 00:56:23.820]   I wrote it out every day.
[00:56:23.820 --> 00:56:27.140]   I forget the model now, but I printed it out, had it on my vision board, wrote it out every
[00:56:27.140 --> 00:56:28.140]   day.
[00:56:28.140 --> 00:56:32.540]   I'm going to have this Harley Davidson, this Harley Davidson, this Harley Davidson.
[00:56:32.540 --> 00:56:36.580]   As part of the process, one weekend I went and I rented one.
[00:56:36.580 --> 00:56:37.580]   I enjoyed it.
[00:56:37.580 --> 00:56:38.580]   I loved it.
[00:56:38.580 --> 00:56:41.020]   I had a great time.
[00:56:41.020 --> 00:56:44.140]   Came away from renting that, a buddy of mine went and rode all weekend together.
[00:56:44.140 --> 00:56:46.780]   I said, "I don't care anymore.
[00:56:46.780 --> 00:56:48.300]   I don't want a Harley Davidson.
[00:56:48.300 --> 00:56:50.300]   I'm not going to ride it enough for it to matter.
[00:56:50.300 --> 00:56:52.020]   I don't want to ride it on a daily basis.
[00:56:52.020 --> 00:56:53.020]   Not going to enjoy it.
[00:56:53.020 --> 00:56:56.580]   It was fun to ride it on a rental bike, but I don't enjoy it."
[00:56:56.580 --> 00:57:00.420]   I crossed it off my list and I went on with my life.
[00:57:00.420 --> 00:57:04.340]   It was not a materialistic goal that was important to me anymore.
[00:57:04.340 --> 00:57:08.220]   Did I fail at achieving that goal?
[00:57:08.220 --> 00:57:10.420]   Not in any way.
[00:57:10.420 --> 00:57:14.460]   I just realized it wasn't that important to me.
[00:57:14.460 --> 00:57:18.700]   Another one was when years ago I first got involved with financial independence.
[00:57:18.700 --> 00:57:22.900]   I would write down every day my number.
[00:57:22.900 --> 00:57:25.080]   Here was my number, 4% rule number.
[00:57:25.080 --> 00:57:26.080]   This is my net worth.
[00:57:26.080 --> 00:57:27.080]   This is my net worth.
[00:57:27.080 --> 00:57:28.080]   This is my net worth.
[00:57:28.080 --> 00:57:29.080]   This is my net worth.
[00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:30.660]   I would write that number down every day and I would imagine it.
[00:57:30.660 --> 00:57:33.100]   I would plan how am I going to accomplish it.
[00:57:33.100 --> 00:57:40.420]   After about 8 months or a year, I realized there is no plan between here and that number
[00:57:40.420 --> 00:57:43.740]   that is exciting to me in the moment.
[00:57:43.740 --> 00:57:45.620]   I don't really care about this goal.
[00:57:45.620 --> 00:57:48.820]   What I want to do is not be financially independent.
[00:57:48.820 --> 00:57:51.940]   What I want to do is I want to live a life that I enjoy.
[00:57:51.940 --> 00:57:55.100]   The simplest and easiest way to get there is to build more freedom into my life and
[00:57:55.100 --> 00:57:56.820]   that's what I did.
[00:57:56.820 --> 00:58:03.180]   Now I'll eventually be financially independent but I don't even write it down regularly.
[00:58:03.180 --> 00:58:08.100]   I still have a number but it's not a major goal for me because it's not really material
[00:58:08.100 --> 00:58:09.100]   to my life.
[00:58:09.100 --> 00:58:11.420]   I'm not going to change anything different when I achieve it or not.
[00:58:11.420 --> 00:58:13.860]   It's just a sign of the progress that I'm on.
[00:58:13.860 --> 00:58:17.860]   I'm more interested in spending more money now than I am down the road.
[00:58:17.860 --> 00:58:20.100]   I'm not that frugal.
[00:58:20.100 --> 00:58:24.420]   I'm frugal on things that don't matter to me and I'm not frugal on things that do matter
[00:58:24.420 --> 00:58:25.420]   to me.
[00:58:25.420 --> 00:58:30.660]   So, changing your goals is fine.
[00:58:30.660 --> 00:58:31.660]   It's normal.
[00:58:31.660 --> 00:58:32.900]   It's expected.
[00:58:32.900 --> 00:58:36.580]   You don't have to set out a goal and say I'm going to go to all 50 states and then go and
[00:58:36.580 --> 00:58:37.900]   accomplish it.
[00:58:37.900 --> 00:58:42.300]   You can go to 15 states and have all that you need.
[00:58:42.300 --> 00:58:44.720]   I think in terms of travel terms.
[00:58:44.720 --> 00:58:48.980]   If you are a traveler, there is no possible way that you can travel to everywhere in the
[00:58:48.980 --> 00:58:49.980]   world.
[00:58:49.980 --> 00:58:51.060]   It's not possible.
[00:58:51.060 --> 00:58:55.380]   You can travel to your list but you can't travel to every possible list in the world.
[00:58:55.380 --> 00:59:00.540]   You can't travel to every country in the world and every TCC country in the world and every
[00:59:00.540 --> 00:59:06.340]   no man mania region in the world and every top hotel in the world and every top beach
[00:59:06.340 --> 00:59:10.140]   in the world and every world heritage site and every state and every world's...
[00:59:10.140 --> 00:59:15.860]   I mean I'm making things up in the world of travel but you can't do it.
[00:59:15.860 --> 00:59:20.620]   So at some point in time you got to realize there's a limit and you don't have to accomplish
[00:59:20.620 --> 00:59:24.300]   everything that's out there to accomplish.
[00:59:24.300 --> 00:59:28.540]   So it's fine to change your goals and adjust them.
[00:59:28.540 --> 00:59:35.500]   So what I hope I've accomplished by now is to share with you some ideas that if you will
[00:59:35.500 --> 00:59:41.340]   pursue your goals, have courage and set them out, they will order your life in a way that
[00:59:41.340 --> 00:59:42.340]   you can enjoy.
[00:59:42.340 --> 00:59:46.240]   And if you'll just make sure that you enjoy the journey and that you're not just arbitrarily
[00:59:46.240 --> 00:59:55.260]   picking things, then this year can be an exciting year.
[00:59:55.260 --> 00:59:56.260]   There was a...
[00:59:56.260 --> 00:59:59.020]   I think it was W Clement Stone, although it may have been Oz Guinness, there's this famous
[00:59:59.020 --> 01:00:03.300]   quote that I don't even know who to cite it to, I could look it up, but it's the quote
[01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:05.460]   that I find so helpful.
[01:00:05.460 --> 01:00:11.380]   "Happiness is the progressive realization of a worthy ideal."
[01:00:11.380 --> 01:00:14.820]   Happiness is the progressive realization of a worthy ideal.
[01:00:14.820 --> 01:00:18.220]   And I think that that is such a powerful statement.
[01:00:18.220 --> 01:00:25.340]   That achieving goals, meaning actually accomplishing them, finishing them, ticking the box, is
[01:00:25.340 --> 01:00:28.180]   not going to bring you happiness.
[01:00:28.180 --> 01:00:33.620]   But the process of working toward goals that matter to you and then systematically making
[01:00:33.620 --> 01:00:36.540]   progress is the key.
[01:00:36.540 --> 01:00:41.860]   So how do you achieve happiness while you're working towards goals?
[01:00:41.860 --> 01:00:47.660]   The most important way is not to gauge your level of success by your distance from the
[01:00:47.660 --> 01:00:56.420]   goal, but to gauge your level of success by your distance from where you began.
[01:00:56.420 --> 01:00:59.100]   Goals are like a mirage.
[01:00:59.100 --> 01:01:02.780]   It's something out there that you want, but as you get closer to it, it's going to just
[01:01:02.780 --> 01:01:04.020]   move down the road.
[01:01:04.020 --> 01:01:06.740]   You're pressing towards it, you're pressing towards it, you're pressing towards it, it's
[01:01:06.740 --> 01:01:08.480]   just going to move.
[01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:12.100]   And I promise you, every goal that you have is just going to move.
[01:01:12.100 --> 01:01:14.660]   The biggest goal you set, "I'm going to have $5 million."
[01:01:14.660 --> 01:01:17.980]   You're going to get to $5 million, you're going to say, "Oh, that's probably not enough.
[01:01:17.980 --> 01:01:18.980]   I need more."
[01:01:18.980 --> 01:01:19.980]   You get to $20 million.
[01:01:19.980 --> 01:01:20.980]   "Okay, I got $20 million.
[01:01:20.980 --> 01:01:23.940]   Ah, maybe it's not enough."
[01:01:23.940 --> 01:01:28.300]   And even if it is enough, you realize, "Ah, it was never about the money."
[01:01:28.300 --> 01:01:31.060]   And you got to set something else.
[01:01:31.060 --> 01:01:34.540]   You go and say, "I'm going to run an Ironman triathlon."
[01:01:34.540 --> 01:01:36.500]   Or you're going to accomplish it.
[01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:38.600]   Then you're going to say, "Yeah, but I could have done it faster.
[01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:39.600]   So let me do another one."
[01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:42.860]   And then you're going to want to say, "Well, I want to be the first one to do one."
[01:01:42.860 --> 01:01:45.100]   On every continent, right?
[01:01:45.100 --> 01:01:47.520]   You start going bigger and bigger.
[01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:54.560]   So you have to recognize that goals are always going to be pushed out.
[01:01:54.560 --> 01:02:00.720]   And so if you measure your happiness or your success, or if you use as a metric the distance
[01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:08.000]   from your goal as a measure of your happiness, you're destined for a life of misery as an
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:12.320]   overachiever who's never happy and never satisfied.
[01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:16.480]   Rather, turn around.
[01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:20.240]   Look forward at your goal as something exciting that's pulling you forward, and then turn
[01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:25.000]   around and reflect on how far you've come.
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:29.100]   Take pleasure in every single step that you have made.
[01:02:29.100 --> 01:02:31.000]   Celebrate yourself.
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:34.680]   Rejoice over the progress that you've made.
[01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:38.560]   Be excited about how far you've come.
[01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:41.320]   And every goal has that.
[01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:44.820]   Enjoy the person that you are because of this.
[01:02:44.820 --> 01:02:48.040]   Even in your greatest failures—that's why I try to share about failures, probably too
[01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:53.240]   much sometimes—but even in your greatest failures, you can celebrate yourself as the
[01:02:53.240 --> 01:03:03.800]   kind of person who had the courage to set goals, who had the courage to try.
[01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:10.100]   Always assess your progress from where you began, and then take your sense of satisfaction
[01:03:10.100 --> 01:03:21.200]   and happiness from that distance, not from how far away you are from your end destination.
[01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:25.780]   The only way it's possible for you to fail at reaching your goals is to quit.
[01:03:25.780 --> 01:03:28.500]   Set goals that matter to you.
[01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:32.560]   Think carefully about the process and make sure you're excited about the journey.
[01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:36.140]   If you've had a string of failures, wonderful!
[01:03:36.140 --> 01:03:41.820]   Learn from those failures about how to set smarter goals.
[01:03:41.820 --> 01:03:47.620]   I haven't given tons of examples of this, but if you will, let's use exercise for a
[01:03:47.620 --> 01:03:48.620]   moment.
[01:03:48.620 --> 01:03:55.100]   I said a number of years ago that one of the great reasons I was failing with exercise
[01:03:55.100 --> 01:04:01.860]   is that I hadn't discovered a form of movement that I enjoyed, that worked for me, that was
[01:04:01.860 --> 01:04:04.820]   something that I could deal with.
[01:04:04.820 --> 01:04:06.920]   And so I set a different goal.
[01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:12.500]   The goal is, how can I discover a form of regular movement, something that's good for
[01:04:12.500 --> 01:04:16.380]   me, keeps my heart healthy, keeps my body strong, etc., that I enjoy?
[01:04:16.380 --> 01:04:17.940]   And that became my goal.
[01:04:17.940 --> 01:04:23.300]   Well now, trying things and quitting them is just part of the journey of discovering
[01:04:23.300 --> 01:04:24.300]   it.
[01:04:24.300 --> 01:04:25.300]   And you can go through your list.
[01:04:25.300 --> 01:04:26.380]   Imagine that you set that goal.
[01:04:26.380 --> 01:04:27.380]   You might try tennis.
[01:04:27.380 --> 01:04:29.020]   No, that wasn't for me.
[01:04:29.020 --> 01:04:30.020]   You might try surfing.
[01:04:30.020 --> 01:04:31.020]   No, not so much.
[01:04:31.020 --> 01:04:32.020]   You might try hiking in the mountains.
[01:04:32.020 --> 01:04:33.020]   Yeah, that's a winner.
[01:04:33.020 --> 01:04:34.740]   Oh, no, that's not a winner.
[01:04:34.740 --> 01:04:36.500]   What about walking on a treadmill?
[01:04:36.500 --> 01:04:38.340]   Well, maybe that's a winner.
[01:04:38.340 --> 01:04:40.420]   No, what about riding a bike?
[01:04:40.420 --> 01:04:41.500]   There's any number of things.
[01:04:41.500 --> 01:04:44.060]   The world of movement is huge.
[01:04:44.060 --> 01:04:45.740]   There's tons of things that can be done.
[01:04:45.740 --> 01:04:49.060]   And your goal now is just to discover a form of movement that you enjoy, that fits your
[01:04:49.060 --> 01:04:51.660]   body's strengths, etc.
[01:04:51.660 --> 01:04:53.860]   And so I think I've said enough.
[01:04:53.860 --> 01:04:56.140]   I hope that these ideas help you.
[01:04:56.140 --> 01:05:00.700]   I hope that they encourage you and they give you some ideas.
[01:05:00.700 --> 01:05:08.880]   But this next year, today is all you got.
[01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:14.500]   For all you and I know, this time next year, you're dead.
[01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:16.820]   I'm dead.
[01:05:16.820 --> 01:05:17.820]   One of us is dead.
[01:05:17.820 --> 01:05:21.420]   Millions of people are going to die this year.
[01:05:21.420 --> 01:05:26.460]   So don't be stupid about your goal setting.
[01:05:26.460 --> 01:05:31.460]   Learn from your mistakes, from your experiences, from your wins and your successes.
[01:05:31.460 --> 01:05:33.060]   Analyze those things.
[01:05:33.060 --> 01:05:36.640]   Choose goals that are important to you for your own reasons.
[01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:39.700]   Not other people's goals for your life, your goals.
[01:05:39.700 --> 01:05:40.700]   Lay them out.
