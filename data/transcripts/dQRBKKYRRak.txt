[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   Ladies and gentlemen, Alexandra Botes.
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   Good seats, good seats.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Zach, can you go to the middle?
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Is this me?
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   This is you?
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   OK.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   What is this red thing for?
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   It's a clock.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   It's a clock?
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   Don't worry, you won't need to use it for very long.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   Oh, Alan.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   Oh, Alan.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   [MUSIC - "DON'T GO IN THE RING"]
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   Don't let your winners ride.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   Rain Man David Sackman.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   I'm going, I'm going all in.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   And it said--
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   We open sourced it to the fans, and they've
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   just gone crazy with it.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   Love you, guys.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   I mean, queen of quinoa.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   I'm going all in.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   She's a globally recognized chess player,
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   one of the most followed chess commentators online,
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   with about 2 million followers.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   I think that's more than we have, isn't it?
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   Totally.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   We're kind of lagging.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   She was a five-time Canadian National Girls Champion.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   She won the US Girls Nationals at age 15.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   She achieved her highest FIDE Elo rating of 2092
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   back in March 2016.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   She began streaming online chess content in 2016
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   as a student at Stanford, where she studied
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   international relations.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   And she and her younger sister, Andrea--
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   or is it Andrea?
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   Did I pronounce that right?
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   Andrea, yeah.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   And she's in the audience somewhere.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   She's in the audience.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   Where are you?
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   Hi, Andrea.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   Anyway, they manage the popular Botez Live Twitch and YouTube
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   channels together.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   And I've watched it from time to time.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   So very entertaining.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   She'll take a selfie with you later, after she beats you.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   And so we're about to do a four-game simultaneous here.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   Do you want to just explain the rules to the audience?
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   Yes.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   And maybe before we get started, thank you guys
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   all for coming to a chess talk.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   I appreciate it.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   How many of you guys know how to play chess?
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   Raise your hand, please.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   Whoa.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   OK, that's very impressive.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   Smart crowd.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   You guys have a great audience.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   So the way it's going to work, I'm
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   going to be playing all four of them at the same time.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   Yeah.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   If you guys saw the betting line at the betting
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   lobby in the front, it's 50 to 1 for any of us
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   to even have a shot at winning.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   Sacks, you must have a shot.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   Sacks is actually pretty good.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Before I explain the rules, maybe you tell them
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   what your chess rating is.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   And we can all talk about the chess experience of it.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   I'm about a 1,600.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   It's not that good, though.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   Can you explain the Elo rating for folks?
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   1,600, he's probably in the 65th percentile.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   So he's kind of like club player type rating.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   Chamath, you've never played before, right?
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   I know the rules, but I've never played.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   OK.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   I'm a zero.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   Technically, I'm a zero.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   OK, are you better than Jekyll, though?
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   Well, I'm smarter than Jekyll.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Maybe.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   I can still beat you at chess and poker.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   I think I did end up doing better in poker
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   than you did, though.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   Oh.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   I think you were on 30.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   I won only 12.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   Pretty good.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   You won a Prius, and I won a first class ticket
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   to anywhere in the world.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Not bad.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   Not bad.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   And David, you also are pretty decent at chess.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   No, no, I'm setting expectations.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   I'm a zero.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   No, what is your actual rating on chess.com?
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   I don't know my rating.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   I'm not going to talk about that right now.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   We're not talking about it.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Why are you such a sandbagger?
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   I peaked at 1,200.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   Stop sandbagging.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   What is it?
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   I peaked at 1,200.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   So you were basically misdirecting us
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   to think you couldn't play.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Yes.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   No, I really do suck.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   I'll be direct.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   He's insecure.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   I'm insecure at chess.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   OK, but--
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   He has a problem with women.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   Why can't you make eye contact?
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   I don't want to talk about anything right now.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   I'm just really nervous about this.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   OK, well, I love that you guys are already trash talking.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   I've got to be honest.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   This session is like my fucking nightmare
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   because I'm so frustrated with chess.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   I've got to be honest.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   I get beat by a girl.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   I've not been able to get back in my score.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   Just sitting here and getting embarrassed in front of everyone
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   and putting it on the fucking internet.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   It's like--
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   It's OK to get beaten by a girl.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   It's not about being beaten by a girl.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   It's seeing how dumb I am.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   It's like, let's go.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   So I think--
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   He's not faking it.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   It's true.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   We're out of here.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   Go, beat us, beat us.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   OK, so let me explain the rules really quickly.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   Also, I know it's hard for you guys,
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   but it's actually good if you're going to work together here
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   because we are only--
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   That doesn't work, ever.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   No.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   No.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   That hasn't worked in 145 episodes.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   No, no, no.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   It's impossible.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   These two idiots are the two that cannot work together.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   David and I have worked together for years.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   So we'll be fine.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   We're going to collaborate over here.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   I feel like this is a group therapy session instead of chess.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   So I'm going to explain the rules now.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   20 called me dumb.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   Well, no.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   I mean, you know what podcasting means to men, right?
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   Group therapy.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   No, that makes sense.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   That makes sense.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   We don't do therapy.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   So five minutes on the clock.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   Everybody playing only has five minutes.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   I have five minutes.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   They have five minutes.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   If anybody runs out of time, the game is over.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   So if they manage to stall me enough and they're just running my clock on one board,
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   I can lose.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   Every time they make a move, they get an extra two seconds increment.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   This is just so that if I only have 10 seconds on one clock,
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   I can at least run there, not lose on time.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   And the way it works is they can make moves at any point.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   I think we're going to have a little eval bar on the screen behind.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   So if you don't play chess, you can kind of look at that.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   There we go.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   [Applause]
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   There we go.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   So you can look at that.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   If the eval bar, you could see more of white than black.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   Alex, mine doesn't work.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   That means I'm -- it's because that's an illegal move.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   Oh, okay.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   That's okay.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   [Laughter]
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   It will work.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   Don't worry.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   I'll come back.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   [Laughter]
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   All right.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   And don't worry.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   If you don't know chess, I will let you know if they make a good move
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   or if they make a bad move.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   I will call it out just so that everybody can follow.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   It will be better.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   That would be funny.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   Okay.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   All right.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   Let's get started.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   [Applause]
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   All right.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   Are you ready?
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   No, I'm not.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   Good luck.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   Good luck.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   Okay.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   D4.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   I think I'm just going to do the same first move.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   Actually, no, I'm trying to checkmate you in four.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   Yes!
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   Get him!
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   [Laughter]
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   Good luck.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   There we go.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   And you are the strongest of them all.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   I'm not going to try to checkmate you in four.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   I'm just going to play simple openings here.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   I knew you'd be speedy.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   When do I go?
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   Uh-oh.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   Do I go?
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   Okay.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   Here we go.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   We're running.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   What do I do?
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   What do I do?
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   What do I do?
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   Yeah!
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   Get him, David!
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   Get her!
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   Wait.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   You're not letting me checkmate him?
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   I didn't know you were going to help everyone.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   Hold on.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   I know what's about to happen here.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   Okay.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   Let's go here.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   Also, the clock near the board is their time.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   The clock near the outside is mine.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   Okay.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   Where's my moves, guys?
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   Oh, no, it's there.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   All right.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   Well, I can't -- oh, the timer didn't start.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   Sorry, Alex.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   No, that's okay.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   I'll reset it.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   Oh.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   You know what?
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   For fun, I guess let's just do three minutes on this clock.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   [Laughter]
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   There we go.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   I only count in increments of 12 minutes.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   Okay.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   It's my turn.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   There we go.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   So you actually can try to flag me faster.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   Okay.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   I am going to -- David, what do I do?
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   [Laughter]
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   I've got to concentrate on the game here for a second.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   What are you going to do?
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   I'm standing here to intimidate you.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   Are you going to develop that knight?
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   It's working.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   Yeah!
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   I came up with this myself.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   I can tell.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   [Laughter]
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   I can tell you didn't get assistance on that one.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   Take it.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   Take it.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   Yeah, take it.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   I didn't know that David Sax would be doing a simul of his own here, but I guess it works.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   It was actually a pretty good move.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   I didn't know you could go backwards.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   What have you done?
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   What have you done?
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   I'm going to go like this.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   Why do you keep saying it's okay?
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   Why not -- it's nice.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   [Laughter]
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   I'm going to have to play faster.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   I'm starting to only get three minutes on each board, and nobody has been checkmated yet.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   Okay.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   Check.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   What?
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   [Laughter]
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   The fuck?
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   [Laughter]
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   All right.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   You asshole.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   [Laughter]
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   What?
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   No.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   Check's not a big deal.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   Okay, not a big deal.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   I'm going to move this person here.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   Look.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   Hey, hey.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   I'm moving this person to here to block her.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   Yes?
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   Okay, good.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   Okay.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   Oh, my God.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   She did two moves, and now I get two moves.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   She's got more play time than I do.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   What?
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   Take your knight out.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   You've got to get castled.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   What?
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   You've got to get castled.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   What the fuck does that mean?
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   Okay, you've survived.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   I'm proud of you.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   [Laughter]
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   Fuck.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   Why did I not be speaking a different language?
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   Did I move?
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   Huh.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   Okay.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   Easy move for you.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   Easy -- David.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   Oh, okay.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   Wait, did I miss a move, or no?
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   Or am I good?
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   I think you just castled.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   I castled.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   Yeah, yeah, you're good.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   David, look, I'm doing this little tip-sitting over here.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   Okay.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   I can tell he's not paying attention to you anymore.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   He doesn't care.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   Alex, take that!
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   Okay, I think I need to bully the weakest link,
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   and then focus on the other boards.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   What the fuck?
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   There we go.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   Okay, so he just lost a piece.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   He's lost, but now he can try to stall me on the clock.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   Stall, stall, stall.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   Okay.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   What does this thing want to do here?
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   Here?
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   Hold on, I am confused.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   Hmm.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   Okay, I'm starting to get two minutes on the clock
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   on most of the boards.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   I'm going to cast a spell.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   Okay.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   I'm going to cast a spell.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   I'm going to cast a spell.

[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   I'm going to cast a spell.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.360]   So far, they're actually-- he just put a queen on the board.
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:14.360]   I can tell.
[00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:15.360]   It's a different color than the other queen.
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:16.360]   I want to.
[00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:17.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:18.360]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:19.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:20.360]   Oh, fuck.
[00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:21.360]   She forked me.
[00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:22.360]   OK, there you go.
[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:23.360]   I'm forked.
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:24.360]   I'm fucked.
[00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:25.360]   She forked me.
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:26.360]   So Sax's position is even right now,
[00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:27.360]   and he's up a minute on the clock.
[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.360]   So he has the best chance so far.
[00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:29.360]   Shemoth hasn't gotten checkmated.
[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:30.360]   The other two have been able to get a little bit of a break.
[00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:31.360]   So he's up a minute on the clock.
[00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:32.360]   So he has the best chance so far.
[00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:33.360]   Shemoth hasn't gotten checkmated.
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:34.360]   The other two have been able to get a little bit of a break.
[00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:36.360]   So he has the best chance so far.
[00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:38.080]   Shemoth hasn't gotten checkmated.
[00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:39.080]   So let's round of applause.
[00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:40.080]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:41.080]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:42.080]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:43.080]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:44.080]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:46.200]   And this position is actually pretty even also.
[00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:47.200]   And I only have two minutes.
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.240]   So I'm going to just have to do more cardio at some point
[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:52.520]   and take out Jkal very soon, because he's managed to lose
[00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:53.600]   many of his pieces.
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:54.600]   So he's in big trouble.
[00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:55.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:56.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:57.600]   OK, OK.
[00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:58.600]   Nice, nice, nice.
[00:10:58.600 --> 00:10:59.600]   I'll be faster.
[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:00.600]   [SIGHS]
[00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:01.600]   Hmm.
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:02.600]   Huh.
[00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:03.600]   Hmm.
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:04.720]   OK.
[00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:06.960]   I think what I need to do is I need to take them out
[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:08.720]   and then focus on you individually, because you're
[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:10.720]   playing very well here.
[00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:11.720]   Uh-oh.
[00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:12.720]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:13.720]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:14.720]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:15.720]   Hmm.
[00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:16.720]   And you're in second place.
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:17.720]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:18.720]   OK, let's try this.
[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:19.720]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:20.720]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:21.720]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:22.720]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:23.720]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:24.720]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:25.720]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:26.720]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:27.720]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:28.720]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:29.720]   OK.
[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:30.720]   I'm trying.
[00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:31.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:32.720]   Hmm.
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:33.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:34.720]   All right.
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:35.720]   We're going to just do--
[00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:36.720]   That's what I'm talking about.
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:37.720]   OK.
[00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:38.720]   I only have a minute on that board, because I accidentally put
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:39.720]   three minutes instead of five.
[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:40.720]   I give you an extra minute if that's what you want.
[00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:41.720]   No, I don't need excuses.
[00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:42.720]   This is competitive.
[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:43.720]   Come on.
[00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:44.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:45.720]   That is actually a good move.
[00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:46.720]   Oh, my God.
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:47.720]   I blundered a pawn.
[00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:48.720]   Oh, God.
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:49.720]   Or did I?
[00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:50.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:51.720]   OK.
[00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:52.720]   Hmm.
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:53.720]   What is she doing?
[00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:54.720]   Every time I come here, I feel like I'm doing something
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:55.720]   completely different.
[00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:56.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:57.720]   OK.
[00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:58.720]   Hmm.
[00:11:58.720 --> 00:11:59.720]   Uh.
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:00.720]   What is she doing?
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:01.720]   Every time I come here, I feel like I'm doing something
[00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:02.720]   completely different.
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:03.720]   Every time I come here, I can't tell if you've made a move,
[00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:04.720]   because your position is so bad.
[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:05.720]   It takes me an extra second.
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:06.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:07.720]   OK.
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:08.720]   I have a minute on this board.
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:09.720]   This is getting really dangerous, so I need to focus on Friedberg.
[00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:10.720]   Otherwise, I might flag.
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:11.720]   And I also have a minute here.
[00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:12.720]   So we're just going to have to make fast moves.
[00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:13.720]   How much do I have here?
[00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:14.720]   Two minutes?
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:15.720]   OK.
[00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:16.720]   We're going to do that.
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:17.720]   He's giving me free pieces.
[00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:18.720]   This is helping.
[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:19.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:20.720]   I did?
[00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:21.720]   Check.
[00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:22.720]   I appreciate it.
[00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:23.720]   Thank you.
[00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:24.720]   Check.
[00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:25.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:26.720]   OK.
[00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:27.720]   We're trying now.
[00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:28.720]   Three minutes here.
[00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:29.720]   Plenty of time.
[00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:30.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:31.720]   Actually, I have a better chance to flag JCal than they do to flag me, so I'm looking forward
[00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:32.720]   to it.
[00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:33.720]   Check.
[00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:34.720]   Oh, sorry.
[00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:35.720]   You didn't move yet.
[00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:36.720]   Oh, wait.
[00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:37.720]   You did.
[00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:38.720]   You just didn't press your clock.
[00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:39.720]   So now it's on you.
[00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:40.720]   50 seconds here.
[00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:41.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:42.720]   OK.
[00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:43.720]   I'm going to try to get this done.
[00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:44.720]   I'm going to try to get this done.
[00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:45.720]   I'm going to try to get this done.
[00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:46.720]   I'm going to try to get this done.
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:47.720]   I'm going to try to get this done.
[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:48.720]   I'm going to try to get this done.
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:49.720]   I'm going to try to get this done.
[00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:50.720]   I'm going to try to get this done.
[00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:51.720]   I'm going to try to get this done.
[00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:52.720]   I'm going to try to get this done.
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:53.720]   I'm going to try to get this done.
[00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:54.720]   I'm going to try to get this done.
[00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:55.720]   I'm going to try to get this done.
[00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:56.720]   I'm going to try to get this done.
[00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:57.720]   I'm going to try to get this done.
[00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:58.720]   I'm going to try to get this done.
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:12:59.720]   I'm going to try to get this done.
[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:00.720]   I'm going to try to get this done.
[00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:01.720]   I'm going to try to get this done.
[00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:02.720]   I'm going to try to get this done.

[00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:57.720]   I'm going to try to get this done.
[00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:58.720]   I'm going to try to get this done.
[00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:04.720]   I'm going to try to get this done.
[00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:05.720]   Oh, this is tricky.
[00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:06.720]   Oh, my God.
[00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:07.720]   I'm going to lose on time.
[00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:08.720]   I have only eight seconds here.
[00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:09.720]   I don't know how I'm going to do this.
[00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:10.720]   Okay, check.
[00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:11.720]   17 seconds.
[00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:12.720]   That's a good move, actually.
[00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:13.720]   I saw the audience yelling.
[00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:14.720]   I need to try not to flag here.
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:15.720]   I don't know if I can pull it off.
[00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:16.720]   Take a shot.
[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:17.720]   I'm going to try to get this done.
[00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:18.720]   I'm going to try to get this done.
[00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:19.720]   I'm going to try to get this done.
[00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:20.720]   I'm going to try to get this done.
[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:21.720]   I'm going to try to get this done.
[00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:22.720]   I'm going to try to get this done.

[00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:46.440]   >> And that's in memory chunking, and that's where people confuse maybe intuition with
[00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:49.840]   actually pattern recognition or chunks of moves.
[00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:53.360]   And that is the best way, from what I understand, to get really good at chess is to understand
[00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:57.280]   those sort of situational chunks of moves like when you hit me with a knife fork and
[00:35:57.280 --> 00:35:58.280]   I lost my rook.
[00:35:58.280 --> 00:35:59.280]   >> Yeah, exactly.
[00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:00.280]   Exactly.
[00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:03.920]   And Magnus, the best player in the world, he's extremely good at end games because,
[00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:06.560]   again, he knows the foundation of end games really well.
[00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:07.560]   He's had a lot of practice.
[00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:10.880]   And he also just has crazy natural talent at figuring them up.
[00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:15.360]   >> So speaking of Magnus, there was a chess scandal that we talked about on the pod some
[00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:20.960]   ways back involving Hans Niemann, a player who has kind of kicked off chess.com and maybe
[00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:23.840]   some other places, too, for alleged cheating.
[00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:25.520]   Magnus said he wouldn't play with him.
[00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:29.160]   Now I guess there was a statement that chess.com is allowing him back.
[00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:30.760]   Magnus said he will play with him.
[00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:34.720]   Can you give us an update on what the chess world thinks happened there?
[00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:35.720]   >> Yeah.
[00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:40.120]   So I'll give some general background a little bit more so the audience has it, too.
[00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:44.040]   Basically the best chess -- and I know they talked about it on the pod, but just in case.
[00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:47.520]   So the best chess player in the world was playing against a talented junior.
[00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:52.840]   He was in the top 50 of all players in the world, top 10 for all juniors.
[00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:57.280]   And he was this chess player who had risen really quickly, like 100 to 200 points, which
[00:36:57.280 --> 00:37:00.240]   was unheard of for his skill level.
[00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:01.960]   And he ended up beating Magnus.
[00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:05.760]   And Magnus the next day withdrew from the tournament, which is the first time Magnus
[00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:07.040]   has ever done anything.
[00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:10.680]   And it basically led to Magnus accusing him of cheating.
[00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:14.400]   And Hans coming out with a public interview saying he's never cheated on the board, but
[00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:18.440]   he has cheated online when he was, you know, 16 or very young.
[00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:22.720]   Chess.com saw this, and because he said that information about cheating on their site,
[00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:24.400]   they wanted to correct the information.
[00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:28.480]   So they came out and they said, actually, he's cheated online in hundreds of games,
[00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:31.200]   including events that were for money.
[00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:34.800]   And then he got uninvited from some larger tournament.
[00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:40.080]   And basically what ended up happening is it blew up into this giant controversy where
[00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:44.600]   people on Hans' side were saying they haven't been able to prove the cheating over the board.
[00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:47.080]   He admitted to online, that's very different.
[00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:51.280]   And then people on Magnus' side were just saying, you know, if the best person in the
[00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:54.220]   world thinks he cheated, he has really good intuition.
[00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:58.800]   This was recently resolved, where Hans has been able to get back onto chess.com.
[00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:02.040]   I spoke to them the day he got back on the website.
[00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:05.480]   The way they saw it is, we just want the world to move forward.
[00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:07.640]   We don't want there to be drama in any sport.
[00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:10.840]   Somebody can get a penalty, but they should be allowed to come back in.
[00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:13.800]   And Magnus agreed to play him back over the board.
[00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:18.680]   And then just a day ago, another world chess champion accused him of cheating and made
[00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:20.080]   a YouTube video on it.
[00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:23.760]   For what it's worth, he accused him of cheating because his timing was really weird in an
[00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:24.980]   online game.
[00:38:24.980 --> 00:38:29.880]   But this 19-year-old was like changing music, talking to his chat, so that's probably why.
[00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:33.600]   But because of computers, it's just really easy to be suspicious now.
[00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:36.920]   But didn't some of the cheating occur in person and they were thinking he might have had some
[00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:40.280]   sort of signal and somebody was, you know, maybe an issuer or something like that.
[00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:44.000]   Maybe he could talk to that because that seems, yeah.
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:45.960]   That's what Magnus was accusing him.
[00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:50.360]   Even when the chess.com report came out, chess.com said they found no evidence of cheating over
[00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:55.340]   the board and there still has been no cheating, no evidence of cheating over the board.
[00:38:55.340 --> 00:38:57.160]   So that hasn't been proven.
[00:38:57.160 --> 00:39:01.360]   That being said, it's extremely difficult to catch people who cheat because it could
[00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:05.720]   be as simple as an arbiter you're working with scratching their head when you have a
[00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:07.460]   winning move and that's it.
[00:39:07.460 --> 00:39:09.040]   So it's really hard to catch.
[00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:12.680]   Not saying that he did cheat, but that's the difficulty of catching cheating at a league
[00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:13.680]   chess.
[00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:16.740]   At tournaments, are they now going to do them like in a sealed room so that nobody can be
[00:39:16.740 --> 00:39:19.840]   watching and present in order to keep the integrity of the game?
[00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:24.520]   I mean, they do metal detectors and all of the arbiters now, you know, they check them
[00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:25.520]   a lot.
[00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:26.880]   They're doing statistical analysis.
[00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:28.480]   They look over their game and things like that.
[00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:31.480]   So they're doing all of the tools that they can.
[00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:34.760]   Alexandra, thank you for bringing chess to the world.
[00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:35.760]   I think you've been an amazing ambassador.
[00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:36.760]   Amazing.
