[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.800]   We come, as I was hinting this evening, to consider the last verse in the sixth chapter
[00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.600]   of Paul's epistle to the Romans, the twenty-third verse.
[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:19.920]   "For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life, through Jesus Christ
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:20.920]   our Lord."
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:31.720]   Well, here, as I say, is the last verse of this great chapter, and it is a verse that
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:39.720]   comes as a very fitting end to this great and momentous chapter.
[00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:46.340]   We are looking at the chapter for the twenty-second time, and I think that we have every reason
[00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:52.640]   to congratulate ourselves on having been able to deal, in the way we have dealt with it,
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:01:01.200]   with such a chapter in twenty-two sessions only, for it is, as we have seen, one of these
[00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:07.160]   great pivotal chapters, not only in this epistle, but in the whole of the Christian doctrine
[00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.120]   and the Christian way of salvation.
[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:17.800]   There is certainly no more important chapter than this, and the measure of the extent to
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:23.720]   which we have been following it and understanding it is the measure in which we are rejoicing
[00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:30.880]   in Christ Jesus and in the liberty wherewith he has made and set us free.
[00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:38.460]   And I do trust that there is nobody here who is still in bondage, for this is the chapter
[00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.560]   of all chapters that shows us the way to true liberty.
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.920]   Now this last verse comes, as the very word "for" at the beginning suggests, as a kind
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.440]   of conclusion to something that has gone before it.
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:01.040]   And it is the conclusion of the immediate argument in which the apostle has been concerned.
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:07.840]   He started an argument in verse twenty, and the argument is that he gives us reasons for
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.360]   paying heed to the exhortation of verse nineteen.
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.560]   The exhortation of verse nineteen is this, "As you have yielded your members, servants,
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:23.760]   to uncleanness and to iniquity, and to iniquity, even so now yield your members, servants,
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.080]   to righteousness and to holiness."
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.080]   Why should we do this?
[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:33.920]   Well, he tells us in verses twenty to twenty-three, he has given us, as we have seen, reasons.
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.820]   He has presented us with arguments.
[00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:41.760]   When you were the servants of sin, you were entirely outside the realm of righteousness,
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.040]   a terrible state to be in, free from righteousness.
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.480]   Not only that, it was a fruitless life.
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.400]   What fruit had he then in those things of which he is now ashamed?
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.400]   Shameful life.
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.440]   Sin is a total loss.
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:01.280]   The life of sin is a complete loss, with nothing whatsoever to redeem it.
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.600]   And the end of all that is death.
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.720]   But then on the other side, positively, he says, "But now, having been made free from
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:15.800]   sin, and having become servants or slaves to God, you have your fruit, and to holiness,
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.640]   and the end everlasting life."
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:25.980]   Four, he is now summing up that particular argument that he has been developing in verses
[00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.280]   twenty, twenty-one, and twenty-two.
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.280]   He winds it up.
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:39.220]   He brings it to a conclusion by emphasizing this last point about the end in the two cases.
[00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:46.600]   Very well, this verse winds up the particular local argument, but it does more than that.
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:52.520]   It also winds up and ends the argument of the whole chapter, because this chapter is
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.880]   an argument from the beginning to the end.
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.800]   He stated at the beginning that it's a sort of parenthesis.
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.680]   He breaks off at the end of verse twenty-one in chapter five.
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:08.200]   He'll take that up again in the first verse, or perhaps the fifth, we'll argue that when
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.880]   we come to that, in the eighth chapter.
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:17.240]   But certainly, chapter six and seven are a part of a great parenthesis, in which he takes
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.320]   up an argument.
[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:25.840]   So we can say that this last verse is in many ways a summary of the argument that he has
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:32.160]   been deploying and developing throughout the whole chapter, and the business of the argument
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:40.560]   is to refute this monstrous suggestion, which he puts before us in verses one and fifteen.
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:41.560]   What then?
[00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.760]   Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound?
[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:45.760]   What then?
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:50.080]   Shall we sin because we are not under the law, but under grace?
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.000]   You see, having put before us his great doctrine of justification by faith only, and the things
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.440]   that result from it immediately and of necessity, he takes up this charge that had been so frequently
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:06.440]   brought against him and the other preachers of this glorious gospel.
[00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:11.160]   This charge which has been brought against this true preaching of justification by faith
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.320]   ever since in the long history of the Christian church.
[00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:19.760]   He takes it up, and his whole object is, I say, to refute it, and to show how utterly
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:27.560]   monstrous and inconceivable it is for anybody who truly understands this doctrine of justification
[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:28.560]   by faith only.
[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:29.560]   Very well.
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:34.200]   So it sums up the entire argument of the whole chapter.
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:38.160]   But we can say one other thing about it, and it's this.
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:42.280]   Verse twenty-three, this last verse of chapter six, is virtually a repetition of the last
[00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:43.800]   verse of chapter five.
[00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.160]   He's back to the point of departure.
[00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:53.520]   Here's verse twenty-one of chapter five, "That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:06:00.680]   grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord."
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:04.960]   Now, it's good that we should observe the Apostle's great method.
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:10.480]   There is no question at all, the best comparison which we can use to show his method is that
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:14.800]   of the musical composer.
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:20.360]   There is something about these massive minds which is similar, irrespective of their particular
[00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.360]   realm.
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:26.920]   I remember hearing the late Sir Walford Davies once describe Beethoven as the Shakespeare
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:30.840]   of music, and I think there was a good deal to be said for his definition.
[00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:35.920]   Well, he meant by that that they've got the same sort of mind, and the Apostle Paul certainly
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.640]   has a similar mind.
[00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:42.720]   I would say a very much greater one, but it's the same type of mind, the same order of mind,
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.720]   and he seems to use the same method.
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:51.040]   You've noticed it in Beethoven, in his sonatas, and in his symphonies.
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:59.000]   He makes a statement, then he takes up a subsidiary statement in the statement, and he works it
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.160]   out for a while, then he takes up another one, and he works that up for a while, and
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:06.680]   you may feel that he's forgotten his original first statement.
[00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:07.680]   Never.
[00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.440]   He always comes back to it.
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:13.240]   He'll work it out, and he'll follow it, and he seems to be going right away, but he comes
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.040]   back to the point of departure.
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:18.640]   Now, the Apostle does that very selfsame thing here.
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:22.360]   He's made his basic statement in chapter 5, verse 21.
[00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:28.160]   Then he takes up this opposition along two main lines, follows them out, but he sees
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:33.820]   to it that in winding up his argument, he's back at the exact point from which he originally
[00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:34.820]   set out.
[00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:41.840]   So this verse is, I say, in many ways a repetition of the last verse of chapter 5, and it's like
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:46.720]   it, as you've observed, even down in details.
[00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:49.880]   One other thing we can say in general about this verse is this.
[00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:58.240]   It is one of these great statements of the gospel of salvation.
[00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:01.280]   The Apostle is very fond of doing that, as we've seen.
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:06.040]   He likes every now and again to state the whole of the gospel in one verse.
[00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:11.800]   He summarizes the whole thing, puts it, as it were, in a nutshell, and he obviously greatly
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:14.280]   enjoyed doing so.
[00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:18.840]   And I trust that we derive the same sort of enjoyment as we look at a verse like this.
[00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:21.640]   Well, now then, what does he say here?
[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:28.120]   Well, there are some three things, once more, that stand out on the very surface of this
[00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:31.760]   verse before we come to analyze it in detail.
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:36.160]   This is, of course, true of his presentation of the gospel always.
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:40.400]   It's true of every other presentation of the gospel in the New Testament.
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:46.480]   These are the things—one, there are two possibilities facing every person who comes
[00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:49.920]   into this world, and there are only two.
[00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:52.040]   They're in this, aren't they?
[00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:56.800]   Wages of sin is death, gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
[00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:58.600]   It's either that or that.
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:03.040]   You see, you're back again, once more, to your house on the sand or the house on the
[00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:04.040]   rock.
[00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:09.280]   You're looking once more to the broad, the wide gate or the straight and narrow gate,
[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:15.400]   whether the broad way or the narrow way, it's man and/or God, or inevitable, it's one or
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:20.600]   the other, and there are only two possibilities.
[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:24.600]   That is something which might very well detain us, but we mustn't allow it to do so.
[00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:26.480]   Let's be clear about this.
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:33.360]   All the non-Christian views confronting mankind this evening belong to the one category.
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:38.240]   The world makes a great deal, of course, about the minor differences, but from the standpoint
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:42.440]   of this book and of salvation, they're all one.
[00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:47.680]   They're divided up into nationalities, they're divided up by iron curtains and bamboo curtains,
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:52.440]   they're divided politically, socially, and in many other respects, they're all irrelevant,
[00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:54.000]   absolutely irrelevant.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.960]   Those divisions don't matter in the light of eternity at all.
[00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:07.960]   This is the only division, and it's one or the other, only two possibilities, no more.
[00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:13.840]   Secondly, these two possibilities are completely different from one another.
[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:17.320]   Now, I emphasize the word "completely."
[00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:22.320]   They are all together and entirely different, as we shall see in a moment.
[00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:25.400]   We've already seen that many times as we've been working through this chapter.
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:28.280]   Yes, he's summarizing it all up here at the end.
[00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:32.040]   There is nothing in common between these two views.
[00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:35.720]   You don't gradually shade off from one to the other.
[00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:38.900]   There is no gray in the spiritual realm.
[00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:44.360]   Everything here is black or white, and you don't gradually tail off.
[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:46.280]   Nothing like a spectrum here.
[00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:52.080]   Stark differences, absolute contrasts, all together different.
[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:54.420]   We must never cease to emphasize that.
[00:10:54.420 --> 00:11:00.480]   There is nothing in common between the Christian and the non-Christian in a spiritual sense,
[00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:01.480]   nothing at all.
[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:06.240]   It's absolutely different, and we must emphasize that repeatedly.
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:12.040]   This is new life, and it's absolutely different from that other position.
[00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:16.560]   And that brings me to my third and last general point, which is this, that each of these two,
[00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:22.440]   which are so different, has its own internal consistency.
[00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:24.400]   Each one is consistent with itself.
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:28.600]   It's absolutely different from the other, yes, but it's consistent within itself.
[00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:32.120]   Or if you prefer it, I'll put that in a different way.
[00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:42.920]   Each one of these two leads inevitably, and by an inexorable law, to ends which are, I
[00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:46.480]   say, quite inevitable.
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:50.640]   Start on the one road, and you're bound to arrive at a given destination.
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:55.720]   Start on the other road, and you're bound to arrive at a different destination.
[00:11:55.720 --> 00:12:00.240]   There is this inward consistency within the two, though they're so essentially different.
[00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:05.420]   Now here, of course, the Apostle is particularly concerned to emphasize the difference in the
[00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:06.420]   end.
[00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:12.400]   He's been bringing up the other differences in verses 20, 21, and 22, and we've been
[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:15.200]   working our way through them.
[00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:21.400]   But you see, he mentioned the end at the close of verse 22, "Now being made free from sin
[00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:27.480]   and become servants to God, you have your fruit unto holiness and the end everlasting
[00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:28.480]   life."
[00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:31.920]   Ah, he feels, I must underline this end.
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:35.240]   He'd mentioned in verse 21 that the end of the other was death.
[00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:38.360]   Oh, this is so tremendous, he seems to say.
[00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:42.480]   I'm going to say that again, and I'll underline it, I'll re-emphasize this thing.
[00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:51.600]   So this verse is particularly concerned with the differing ends of these two ways of life.
[00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:56.680]   Now then, in the light of all that, let us come and look at his contrasts.
[00:12:56.680 --> 00:13:02.040]   I've attempted to classify the contrasts under these headings.
[00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:07.800]   First, the master we serve.
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:10.440]   The analogy he's been using, you remember, is one of slavery.
[00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:11.440]   Very well.
[00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:16.000]   But the first contrast we see is between these two possibilities confronting every soul
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.760]   that is born into this world.
[00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:22.040]   The first contrast is the master whom we serve.
[00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:26.520]   And here it is again, as I say, only two possibilities.
[00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:30.340]   It's either sin or else it's God.
[00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:33.240]   The wages of sin, there's the one master.
[00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:36.280]   The gift of God, there's the other master.
[00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:38.120]   You see, he'd brought us to that, hadn't he?
[00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:49.360]   But now being made free from sin and become slaves to God, it's either sin or God.
[00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:55.120]   And everybody in the world at this moment is either a slave to sin or else is a slave
[00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:56.120]   of God.
[00:13:56.120 --> 00:14:02.680]   There's no neutrality in the spiritual realm, there's no no man's land in the spiritual
[00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:04.120]   realm.
[00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:09.160]   You cannot serve God and man, we've been seeing that repeatedly.
[00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:12.400]   This is the one thing that matters.
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:13.400]   Who are we serving?
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:15.640]   Who's our master?
[00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:22.040]   And this is the point, you see, at which once more we see that all the talk about morality
[00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:28.960]   and ethics and conduct and doing good and all the rest of it is completely irrelevant.
[00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:33.480]   The only thing to know about a man is this, not how much good does he do, not what are
[00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:37.320]   his ideals, how philanthropic is he, no, no, that's not the question to ask.
[00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:41.800]   The only question you need ask about any man is this, who's his master?
[00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:46.040]   To whom is he a slave?
[00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:50.520]   And though he may be apparently the paragon of all the virtues, and though he may be a
[00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:54.680]   man who does a tremendous lot of good, and though he may be a most moral and ethical
[00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:59.840]   man, and though he may appear at first sight to be a very much better man than most people
[00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:04.520]   who are members of Christian churches, though he never goes to a church at all, I say that's
[00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:08.560]   not the thing to look at, that's not the thing to discover.
[00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:18.200]   The one question the Bible wants to know about every one of us is this, whom do you serve?
[00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:20.200]   For whom are you living?
[00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:24.380]   Who's your master?
[00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:28.880]   Is it sin, or is it God?
[00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:36.040]   Now, I am emphasizing this for this reason, that it is the essential fight of the Christian
[00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:39.160]   gospel, I feel today, to bring out just this very point.
[00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:41.280]   I've been saying this quite a lot recently.
[00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:43.560]   I'm simply repeating what the apostle says.
[00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:46.960]   It isn't that I want to, but he makes me say it because he says it.
[00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:50.440]   Now, I say this is the great fight for the Christian faith today.
[00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:55.600]   People are so impressed by these wonderful men, they say, handsome to look at and who
[00:15:55.600 --> 00:16:01.720]   speak so nicely on the television and they do so much good and they talk so learnedly
[00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:06.640]   and they talk so much about doing good and ethics and so on, they say, fine men, that's
[00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:07.640]   the word.
[00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:15.160]   Well, it doesn't matter how fine a man a man may be, if he isn't doing it all for God.
[00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:16.520]   He's a slave of sin.
[00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:21.960]   Now, the apostle not only says that here, he says it in a most interesting manner in
[00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:27.320]   the second epistle to the Corinthians in chapter 11, where he puts it like this.
[00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:32.280]   He says, you know people, there are some people, he says, who are troubling you, good Corinthians,
[00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:38.600]   and he's concerned that he should deliver them from these false apostles, these specious
[00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:39.600]   persons.
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:45.800]   He says, what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them which desire
[00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:50.080]   occasion, that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we.
[00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:57.800]   For such, verse 13, 11th chapter, 2nd Corinthians, for such, he says, are false apostles, deceitful
[00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:04.000]   workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:10.680]   And no marvel, for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.
[00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:17.280]   Therefore, it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness.
[00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:21.320]   Now, there it is once and forever.
[00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:23.520]   These people appear to be the ministers of righteousness.
[00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:28.280]   Ah, yes, says the apostle, but you shouldn't be deluded by that.
[00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:32.840]   You shouldn't be deceived by that, as Eve was deceived by the serpent there in the garden
[00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:34.460]   of Eden.
[00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:40.200]   You should realize that they're able to transform themselves into angels of light and into men
[00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:44.380]   that appear as if they were Christians, the apostles of Christ.
[00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:47.860]   But it's all false, they're serving the devil.
[00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:52.600]   And you shouldn't be surprised at this, says Paul, because as their master does this, well,
[00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:57.580]   it's not very surprising that they themselves should imitate him and try to do the same
[00:17:57.580 --> 00:17:58.580]   thing.
[00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:05.120]   Now, the upshot of all this is this, that we mustn't judge men by the good they do,
[00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:08.980]   nor by the good and nice things they say.
[00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:17.240]   There is only one question, is all this done for the glory of God?
[00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:25.360]   Because if it isn't, it is all done in slavery to sin and to Satan.
[00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:31.100]   Very well, good Christian people, don't be frightened as you hear these men praised and
[00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:33.560]   people point at them and look at them.
[00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:38.200]   See, that's quite irrelevant, that's not the thing I'm concerned about.
[00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:44.600]   If they are not living to the glory of God and the Lord Jesus Christ, well, they're in
[00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:51.160]   exactly the same category as the vilest and the foulest sinners that are in the world
[00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:52.880]   this evening.
[00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:58.340]   And all their righteousness is but a filthy rag.
[00:18:58.340 --> 00:19:01.720]   Let's say that, let's assert it.
[00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:04.880]   Let's not be deceived by this appearance.
[00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:08.360]   It is the master whom you serve that determines what you are.
[00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:11.400]   Now, the apostle has said all that, hasn't he, in verse 16?
[00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:13.840]   But he says it again here, you see, in the last verse.
[00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:17.680]   So that enables us to go on to the second point, which is this.
[00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:23.160]   There we see the complete contrast in the masters.
[00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:28.360]   Now let us look at the complete contrast that is to be observed in the contracts, or in
[00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:32.280]   the conditions under which we serve.
[00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:37.960]   The masters which we serve are quite different, yes, so are the conditions or the contracts
[00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:43.160]   under which we serve under these masters are absolutely different, nothing in common.
[00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:47.560]   On the one hand it is wages, on the other hand it is a gift.
[00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:50.680]   Now, let's look at these.
[00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:54.360]   The wages of sin is death.
[00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:59.000]   It's generally agreed that a better translation might be the rations.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:04.360]   The word the apostle used was the word that was used about the rations that were given
[00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:09.120]   out to the soldiers and the slaves in imperial Rome.
[00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:13.920]   They were made to work as slaves and then they were given a ration of food, and perhaps
[00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:16.640]   some certain amount of money.
[00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:19.080]   A ration was doled out.
[00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:21.840]   They were in utter slavery, but they were given their rations.
[00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:27.360]   That's what the apostle says, the rations of sin.
[00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:30.920]   It's something earned, in other words, it's something that you deserve, it's something
[00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:35.560]   that you merit, you've rendered service for it.
[00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:40.640]   But a question arises, who decides, or what decides, as to the rations that are to be
[00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:44.200]   given to these slaves of sin?
[00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:47.680]   The answer is, of course, the law.
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:50.320]   It's the law that decides that.
[00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:55.320]   The law has laid it down perfectly, plainly, and clearly what the result of such a life
[00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:57.920]   and such a conduct is going to be.
[00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:01.920]   In other words, he reminds us here at the very end of something that he's been reminding
[00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:11.080]   us of since we were dealing with verse 20 in chapter 5, that sin and law always go together.
[00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:18.640]   Here it is, "Moreover, the law entered that the offence might abound, but where sin abounded,
[00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:20.520]   grace did much more abound."
[00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:23.000]   There it was there.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:29.200]   But we'd already seen the same thing in chapter 4 and in verse 15, where he says, "Because
[00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:35.160]   the law worketh wrath."
[00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:37.360]   You see, law and sin go together.
[00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:43.400]   And when we get to chapter 8, we shall find that he puts it like this in verse 2, "For
[00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:48.960]   the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and
[00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:49.960]   death."
[00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:53.520]   Here it is, perfectly explicit, law of sin and death.
[00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:56.840]   Law, sin, death, they all go together.
[00:21:56.840 --> 00:22:02.120]   He's very fond of saying this, you see, he says it at the end of 1 Corinthians 15, "The
[00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:07.080]   sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the law."
[00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:08.080]   These are against us.
[00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:14.520]   Very well, then, it is the law that decides that the rations paid to the man who's been
[00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:17.800]   a slave of sin is death.
[00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:18.800]   The law decides that.
[00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:23.720]   Now, there's a very good statement of this principle in the epistle to the Hebrews in
[00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:27.360]   the 2nd chapter and the 2nd verse, Hebrews 2.2.
[00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:36.920]   It puts it like this, "For if the words spoken by angels were steadfast, and every transgression
[00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:43.240]   and disobedience received a just recompense of reward."
[00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:48.560]   Now, the word spoken by angels, of course, was the word of the law.
[00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:53.520]   He's referring to the law as given to Moses and mediated by angels.
[00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:55.120]   That's what he's talking about.
[00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:59.320]   The word spoken by angels is the law, and what the law does is this.
[00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:08.400]   It says that every transgression and disobedience should receive a just recompense of reward.
[00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:13.560]   For service is rendered, that's the just recompense of reward.
[00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:16.980]   And as he tells us, it is death.
[00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:24.720]   So on the one hand, you've got wages, rations, determined by the law in a strictly legal
[00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:25.720]   manner.
[00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:30.760]   The soul that dieth it, the soul that sinneth it, shall die.
[00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:32.280]   That's the prescription of the law.
[00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:36.320]   That's the ration it says is going to be given, and it is given.
[00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:38.920]   That's a matter of rations.
[00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:46.200]   But on the other hand, you see, we have a gift, and it means a free gift.
[00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:55.320]   This isn't earned, this isn't merited, this isn't a just recompense, it's altogether different.
[00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:57.840]   It's the complete antithesis.
[00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:03.640]   This is solely the result of God's goodness and God's grace.
[00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:10.200]   This is unmerited favor, kindness shown to someone who doesn't deserve any kindness at
[00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:11.200]   all.
[00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:18.920]   It is the free gift of God to people who are utterly undeserving of him.
[00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:24.120]   Now that is true of the whole of the Christian life, from beginning to end.
[00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:30.120]   It is the part of the great contrast between sin and grace, which is put before us in chapter
[00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:36.840]   5, verse 21, "that a sinneth reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness
[00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:40.800]   unto eternal life."
[00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:44.680]   It refers to the whole of the Christian life, from beginning to end.
[00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:49.280]   It is true of the entire method of salvation.
[00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:55.120]   It is the thing that had made the apostles say, in verse 16 of chapter 1, "I am not ashamed
[00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:56.600]   of the gospel of Christ."
[00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:57.600]   Why?
[00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:03.160]   Oh, it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth, to the Jew first
[00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:08.280]   and also to the Greek, for therein a righteousness of God, from God, by faith.
[00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:12.680]   This is the thing, God's free gift, this wonderful grace.
[00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:17.840]   And he bursts out in the same way when he comes to the 21st verse of chapter 3 and brings
[00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:24.400]   it out explicitly, remember, in verse 24, "being justified freely by his grace through
[00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:27.840]   the redemption that is in Christ Jesus."
[00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:31.560]   How he rejoices in repeating these wonderful statements.
[00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:35.000]   Well, there is the second contrast.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.320]   The two masters are different.
[00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:44.520]   The terms of service in the two cases are again a complete contrast and altogether different.
[00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:52.840]   And thirdly, and lastly, the end to which each one leads is absolutely and altogether
[00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:55.680]   different.
[00:25:55.680 --> 00:26:01.960]   And as I say, this verse is particularly concerned to emphasize the difference in the end.
[00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:07.600]   Now, the apostle here is not concerned to tell us so much as to how we arrive at that
[00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:08.600]   end.
[00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:11.320]   He has already told us that.
[00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:22.160]   In the case of sin, he says that these are the steps, disobedience, unrighteousness,
[00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:24.520]   uncleanness, iniquity.
[00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:26.920]   Those are the steps.
[00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:31.160]   The servant, the slave of sin, is always led along that line.
[00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:33.000]   Didn't it happen there in the garden?
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.960]   Adam and Eve had been living a life of obedience to God.
[00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:36.960]   The devil comes in.
[00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:37.960]   What's his first suggestion?
[00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:40.520]   That they should disobey.
[00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:42.760]   That they should do what God had told them not to do.
[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:43.760]   That's disobedience.
[00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:47.080]   That's the first step—disobedience.
[00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:50.200]   And the moment you've done that, you become guilty of unrighteousness.
[00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:58.120]   And that, in turn, leads to uncleanness, as we saw, you remember, in verse 19.
[00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:04.320]   And that, in turn, leads to iniquity, unto iniquity.
[00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:06.000]   Those are the steps.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.280]   The steps on the other side we have also seen.
[00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:11.960]   He starts saying it in verse 16.
[00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:15.320]   You're led, first of all, to obedience.
[00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:22.800]   And obedience leads to righteousness, and righteousness, as we've seen, leads to holiness.
[00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:24.760]   What a wonderful difference once more.
[00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:31.440]   All right, but the apostles' concern here, I say, is to emphasize the difference in the
[00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:40.300]   ends at which we arrive in the two slaveries along those various lines.
[00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:51.120]   In the case of the end to which sin leads us, it is death.
[00:27:51.120 --> 00:28:02.280]   If you are a slave of sin, you will be led by sin along those horrible steps, and at
[00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:03.280]   the end, death.
[00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:04.280]   What does he mean by this?
[00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:06.440]   What does he mean by saying that the wages of sin is death?
[00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:10.400]   Well, it means death in every form.
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:17.360]   The moment man disobeyed, he died spiritually—spiritual death, separation from God.
[00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:21.280]   But we realize also that it included physical death.
[00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:25.800]   Man was never meant to die, either spiritually or physically.
[00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:33.120]   But as the result of disobedience and sin, he has died spiritually and physically.
[00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:40.440]   But here the apostle is not so much looking at the proximate results of slavery to sin
[00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:47.580]   as the final result, the final outworking of it, the ultimate destiny.
[00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:50.200]   And what is that?
[00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:52.520]   The wages of sin is death.
[00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:55.600]   That's the end at which it arrives.
[00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:59.880]   In the meantime, as he's been telling us, it leads to uncleanness and iniquity and to
[00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:01.040]   iniquity and so on.
[00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:04.120]   Ah, yes, but he says, "What's the final end of it all?"
[00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:05.480]   Well, that's death.
[00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:07.080]   What does this mean?
[00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:11.440]   The best answer to that is to take you again to that term which we encountered more than
[00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:16.360]   once in the reading at the beginning in the twentieth chapter of the book of Revelation.
[00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:19.880]   It is the second death.
[00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:26.560]   The wages of sin, the end to which sin brings you is the second death.
[00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:29.160]   Did you notice how there John drew this distinction?
[00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:32.680]   You see, those who are written in the Lamb's Book of Life, they don't take part in the
[00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:36.280]   second death, but all the others do.
[00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:39.880]   The wages of sin is death, this second death.
[00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:41.560]   What does it mean?
[00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:55.880]   Well, it means a final and irreversible separation from God, and from the face of God, and from
[00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:58.240]   the life of God.
[00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:08.240]   It means to be eternally outside God's life with all the consequent misery and all the
[00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:11.040]   consequent suffering.
[00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:14.040]   That's the second death.
[00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:22.680]   That is the ultimate fate of the ungodly, to be eternally outside the life of God and
[00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:29.560]   all its beneficent and loving and noble and holy and pure influences.
[00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:36.280]   It is to be left in your uncleanness and your iniquity unto iniquity, and that getting worse
[00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:46.440]   and ever worse without relief, altogether shut off and cut off, finally, from God.
[00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:52.720]   The second death, to be cast into that lake, as the imagery puts it there at the end of
[00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:59.220]   the twentieth chapter of Revelation, the lake that burns with fire and brimstone, into which
[00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:07.160]   death and Hades are cast, and the beast and the image and the devil, and there to be everlastingly
[00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:11.280]   outside the life of God.
[00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:15.920]   What's the end if you're a slave of sin?
[00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:18.960]   But what is the end if you're a slave of God?
[00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:21.640]   Oh, what a contrast.
[00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:29.040]   The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life.
[00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:30.040]   What's eternal life?
[00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:35.200]   Well, it doesn't merely mean everlasting existence.
[00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:40.240]   It does mean that you continue everlastingly, as the other does, but it doesn't only mean
[00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:41.240]   that.
[00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:45.040]   Indeed, that is the least significant thing about it.
[00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:53.960]   Eternal life essentially means this, knowledge of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:59.800]   It's our Lord himself who defines it like that in John's Gospel, chapter 17, verse 3.
[00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:02.280]   This is life eternal.
[00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:06.200]   He says that God has sent him to give eternal life to as many as he had given him, and this
[00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:16.920]   is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou
[00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:17.920]   hast sent.
[00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:21.400]   That's eternal life, the knowledge of God.
[00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:22.400]   That is life.
[00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:27.560]   You see, death means not to know him and to be shut out from all his presence and his
[00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:29.720]   glory and all his blessings.
[00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:31.880]   So eternal life is the exact opposite.
[00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:37.280]   It is to know God, not to know about God, but to know him, and to know him, as we are
[00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:42.320]   dealing here with the ultimate end, absolutely perfectly.
[00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:46.440]   It means, therefore, all blessedness.
[00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:50.800]   It means unalterable and spotless holiness.
[00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:53.600]   It means imperishable glory.
[00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:56.760]   That's what eternal life means.
[00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:58.840]   It doesn't merely mean that you and I will go on existing.
[00:32:58.840 --> 00:32:59.840]   No, no.
[00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:02.640]   We shall go on living in the presence of God.
[00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:04.080]   We shall see God.
[00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:08.720]   We will live in the presence of God and in the light of the Lamb, and we shall be absolutely
[00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:09.720]   holy.
[00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:12.040]   We shall be like God, because we are his children.
[00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:16.960]   It will be, I say, unalterable and spotless holiness, imperishable glory.
[00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:18.480]   We shall be glorified.
[00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:20.900]   We shall be like him.
[00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:26.760]   The apostle elsewhere says that it means that we shall receive a crown.
[00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:30.880]   Do you remember how he puts it, in writing his last letter, the last letter of all that
[00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:31.880]   he wrote?
[00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:35.120]   It's the second letter to Timothy, chapter 4, verse 8.
[00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:36.120]   Listen.
[00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:40.400]   "Henceforth," he says, "henceforth," he's looking to the end, "there is laid up for
[00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:47.480]   me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, shall give me in that
[00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:48.480]   day.
[00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:49.480]   And not to me only."
[00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:53.880]   Thank God he went on to say this, otherwise we might feel, "Ah yes, he was a great man
[00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:56.120]   and a wonderful saint, and he deserved it."
[00:33:56.120 --> 00:34:00.960]   "Not to me only," he says, "but unto all them that love is appearing.
[00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:04.880]   You and I shall receive this crown of righteousness."
[00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:07.560]   In other words, it is perfection.
[00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:11.560]   We shall be without spot or wrinkle or any such thing.
[00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:15.240]   We shall be enjoying the beatific vision.
[00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:19.520]   We shall be enjoying the glory which God will have given us.
[00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:21.880]   The glory that he gave to his Son, he's going to give to us.
[00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:27.680]   We shall be glorified, entirely so, completely saved in every respect.
[00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:36.280]   That's what eternal life means, sharing and enjoying the life of God to all eternity without
[00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:41.120]   the slightest suspicion of an admixture of sin or evil.
[00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:45.680]   There will be no sin there, there will be no sighing, there will be no sorrow, there
[00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:48.920]   will be no tears, there will be no partings.
[00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:56.360]   It is all glory, unmixed, absolute glory, the perfection of God himself which he will
[00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:57.560]   have put upon us.
[00:34:57.560 --> 00:35:07.840]   That's what it means, full life in every respect, body, mind, and spirit, the whole
[00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:18.080]   person entirely delivered from every vestige or relic of sin and completely glorified.
[00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:23.400]   It will be something that even Adam didn't enjoy.
[00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:29.680]   Adam was perfect, Adam was innocent, but he didn't have eternal life.
[00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:33.960]   Because if you have eternal life, you see, you can't lose it, you can't die, and Adam
[00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:34.960]   did.
[00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:41.180]   No, no, in him, in Christ, in him, the tribes of Adam boast more blessings than their father
[00:35:41.180 --> 00:35:42.640]   lost.
[00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:46.360]   Adam would have gone on to this, had he continued in obedience, but he didn't.
[00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:50.360]   If he had continued in obedience, he would have had this eternal life.
[00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:55.000]   This is the thing which the Lord is giving us as the end of our salvation.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   Now, Peter, I've quoted the apostle Peter there.
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:06.400]   In his first epistle, first chapter, in verse 9, he says, "Receiving the end of your salvation,"
[00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:08.200]   and this is what he means.
[00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:09.720]   It is the same thing.
[00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:17.040]   Well, now then, this is the position, this eternal life, of course, begins here.
[00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:19.000]   We are given eternal life immediately.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:23.840]   We believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, yes, but the apostle here is concerned about the
[00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:25.320]   ultimate end of it.
[00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:27.920]   We've got it, yes, but we're going to receive it also.
[00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:32.280]   Have you noticed that apparent contradiction in the scriptures?
[00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:34.160]   Here he's talking about the end.
[00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:38.400]   We are already saved, but Peter says you're going to receive your salvation as an end.
[00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:39.960]   That's what it means.
[00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:41.800]   We are only given a foretaste here.
[00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:43.640]   We are only given a first installment.
[00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:48.080]   We are only given a little sample, but the thing itself awaits us.
[00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:54.400]   Henceforth, as Paul says, there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness.
[00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:55.400]   That's the end.
[00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:59.480]   The crowning day is coming by and by for us.
[00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:02.560]   He's going to give us this crown of righteousness.
[00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:09.080]   We shall be finally glorified and perfect and entire and complete.
[00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:18.280]   There then are the three contrasts, the two masters, the two terms of service, the two
[00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:24.760]   ends at which we arrive.
[00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:26.520]   And there it is, isn't it?
[00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:28.160]   He's finished the contrasts.
[00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:34.720]   Yes, but he hasn't finished the verse.
[00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:38.560]   He never leaves it like that.
[00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:43.880]   He said all he's got to say, you know, about the contrasts, masters, terms of service,
[00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:44.880]   ends.
[00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:47.200]   What more is there?
[00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:54.320]   The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life.
[00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:59.560]   And then he seems to say, how has this become possible?
[00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:01.800]   How can this have happened?
[00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:13.260]   And he tells us once more, he brings in the blessed name through Jesus Christ, our Lord.
[00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:14.560]   He couldn't leave that out.
[00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:15.560]   He never leaves it out.
[00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:20.120]   Do you remember how he ended chapter 5, "That a sin hath reigned unto death, even so might
[00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:26.840]   grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life"?
[00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:32.920]   By Jesus Christ, our Lord, he never misses it.
[00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:38.560]   Take verse 11 in this sixth chapter, "Likewise reckon ye yourselves to be dead indeed unto
[00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:41.920]   sin, but alive unto God."
[00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:43.360]   That's the thing he was out to say.
[00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:51.760]   Ah, yes, but he can't stop through Jesus Christ, our Lord.
[00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:52.760]   He couldn't stop.
[00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:55.840]   He never fails to go on to add this.
[00:38:55.840 --> 00:39:00.920]   He never fails to remind us of the way in which it has all come to us and all has been
[00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:03.840]   made possible.
[00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:09.720]   Do you and I feel like him, or do you and I stop with our neat classifications and forget
[00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:14.500]   the Lord who has brought it all to us and without whom we'd have nothing at all?
[00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:17.560]   The whole of your life, my dear friend, is in Christ.
[00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:21.600]   It's through or in Jesus Christ, our Lord.
[00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:26.400]   Everything is from him and without him there is nothing at all.
[00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:33.560]   This blessed thing which is offered us and promised us, it is all in and through Jesus
[00:39:33.560 --> 00:39:37.020]   Christ, our Lord.
[00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:42.880]   It is in him and because of him that we are justified freely by God.
[00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:47.940]   We receive our justification as a result of his work, his spotless life of obedience,
[00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:51.800]   his atoning sacrificial death, where he received our punishment.
[00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:56.480]   We are justified, says Paul in one place, you remember in chapter 5 in verse 9, by his
[00:39:56.480 --> 00:40:05.560]   blood delivered for our offenses, raised again for our justification.
[00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:13.500]   It's in Jesus Christ, incarnation, life, obedience, agony, death, burial, grave, resurrection,
[00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:16.260]   ascension, return, seating on the right hand.
[00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:20.740]   It's through Jesus Christ, our Lord, and without him we have nothing.
[00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:30.300]   Oh yes, it is because of him that God declares us to be righteous and imputes to us the righteousness
[00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:34.700]   of Jesus Christ, but he doesn't leave it at that, he joins us to him.
[00:40:34.700 --> 00:40:38.140]   That's what we have been considering in this chapter, isn't it?
[00:40:38.140 --> 00:40:43.860]   Know we not, he says, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ, were baptized
[00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:48.380]   into his death, therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death, that like us Christ
[00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:53.180]   was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should live, should
[00:40:53.180 --> 00:40:58.500]   walk in newness of life, planted together in the likeness of his death.
[00:40:58.500 --> 00:41:01.500]   We shall also be in the likeness of his resurrection.
[00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:07.900]   We are joined to him, that's the great theme of the chapter, we are in him.
[00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:12.140]   And because of that, you see, he's drawn these deductions, hasn't he?
[00:41:12.140 --> 00:41:17.140]   Because we are in Christ and joined to him, we have been set free from sin.
[00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:18.900]   We are dead to sin.
[00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:22.700]   It has no more power or authority or rule or reign over us.
[00:41:22.700 --> 00:41:28.580]   And secondly, we are alive unto God and the exceeding greatness of his power to us that
[00:41:28.580 --> 00:41:32.420]   believe, I am open to that.
[00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:35.820]   I am in the plan and the purpose of God.
[00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:37.900]   He has set his affection upon me.
[00:41:37.900 --> 00:41:40.580]   He has known me before the foundation of the world.
[00:41:40.580 --> 00:41:44.540]   I am in this great plan and scheme of redemption.
[00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:47.660]   Christ's life is in me as I am in him.
[00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:49.980]   He is divine and I am the branch.
[00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:55.180]   He is the head and we are the members of the body.
[00:41:55.180 --> 00:41:58.180]   And because of him we have received the Spirit.
[00:41:58.180 --> 00:42:01.100]   The Spirit that dwelt in him dwells in us.
[00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:06.660]   And it is this Holy Spirit that leads us and guides us and directs us, brings to us the
[00:42:06.660 --> 00:42:13.580]   scripture, opens our understanding and opens the word to us, causes us to sow to the Spirit.
[00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:19.460]   It is the Spirit that produces our sanctification and it's progressive and it goes on and on.
[00:42:19.460 --> 00:42:24.680]   But we have received the Spirit through Jesus Christ because we are in him and joined to
[00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:25.680]   him.
[00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:28.860]   That's what he's saying.
[00:42:28.860 --> 00:42:33.660]   If you like we can put it all like this as I close.
[00:42:33.660 --> 00:42:39.740]   God's purpose is to bring us to glory.
[00:42:39.740 --> 00:42:47.380]   It became him, it behoved him, says Hebrews 2.10, of whom are all things and for whom
[00:42:47.380 --> 00:42:54.700]   are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect
[00:42:54.700 --> 00:42:55.700]   through suffering.
[00:42:55.700 --> 00:43:03.020]   Here's the object, you see, bringing many sons to the glory that I've been trying
[00:43:03.020 --> 00:43:04.640]   to describe to you.
[00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:06.760]   That is God's purpose.
[00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:12.260]   The whole object of salvation is to bring us to that glory where we shall be perfect
[00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:18.260]   and spotless and sinless, no wrinkle nor any such thing, absolutely holy and perfect in
[00:43:18.260 --> 00:43:19.700]   the presence of God.
[00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:24.740]   That is God's purpose, to bring us there.
[00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:29.940]   Is there anything, therefore, which can be so utterly monstrous and idiotic and foolish
[00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:36.460]   and irrational as to suggest that such preaching is preaching that leads people to say this,
[00:43:36.460 --> 00:43:43.300]   "Shall we continue in sin then that grace may abound or shall we sin because we are
[00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:47.180]   not under the law but under grace?"
[00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:50.540]   Monstrous lunatics, says the apostle in effect.
[00:43:50.540 --> 00:43:55.980]   Can't you see that the whole object of the thing is to bring us to glory, this end of
[00:43:55.980 --> 00:43:58.460]   eternal life?
[00:43:58.460 --> 00:44:04.580]   How can such a program, such a purpose and such a way ever be any sort of encouragement
[00:44:04.580 --> 00:44:05.580]   to sin?
[00:44:05.580 --> 00:44:08.820]   That is how he finally ridicules it, you see.
[00:44:08.820 --> 00:44:12.740]   The purpose of God is the exact opposite of sin.
[00:44:12.740 --> 00:44:16.700]   All God teaches us is the exact opposite of sin.
[00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:21.180]   Christ to whom we are joined is the exact opposite of sin.
[00:44:21.180 --> 00:44:26.140]   He was perfect, sin apart, tempted in all points like as we are, sin apart, without
[00:44:26.140 --> 00:44:27.140]   sin.
[00:44:27.140 --> 00:44:32.140]   He was holy, he was unblameable, he was undefiled, and we are joined to him.
[00:44:32.140 --> 00:44:35.660]   It is the antithesis, the exact opposite of sin.
[00:44:35.660 --> 00:44:41.060]   What a suggestion that such preaching should encourage people to go on sinning.
[00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:45.320]   So that leaves us with a final question, doesn't it?
[00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:50.420]   What is it in any man that can ever make him misunderstand such a gospel?
[00:44:50.420 --> 00:44:54.180]   What was it that made these critics of Paul say, "Oh, this preaching of this man on
[00:44:54.180 --> 00:44:59.620]   justification by faith is an enticement and an incitement to sin."
[00:44:59.620 --> 00:45:05.540]   How can men say such a thing face-to-face with such statements and such a gospel?
[00:45:05.540 --> 00:45:11.180]   Oh, I want to ask another question.
[00:45:11.180 --> 00:45:18.180]   What is it that accounts for the fact that men and women who have heard this gospel ever
[00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:25.260]   deliberately prefer to live a life of sin, with all its uncleanness and all its iniquity,
[00:45:25.260 --> 00:45:29.180]   and though they are told it is going to lead to that second death, which will be endless
[00:45:29.180 --> 00:45:35.580]   suffering, a life that is unprofitable, a life that is unclean, and that leads to such
[00:45:35.580 --> 00:45:37.580]   an eternal end?
[00:45:37.580 --> 00:45:42.580]   What is it in man, I say, that makes him, when he hears this, deliberately reject it
[00:45:42.580 --> 00:45:46.300]   and think he is clever in doing so, and deliberately choose the other?
[00:45:46.300 --> 00:45:50.300]   What is it?
[00:45:50.300 --> 00:45:55.420]   What is it that accounts for the fact that any man who has ever heard the gospel and
[00:45:55.420 --> 00:46:00.420]   its offer of the free gift of salvation can refuse it?
[00:46:00.420 --> 00:46:05.220]   There is only one answer, my friend.
[00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:10.660]   Such people are spiritually dead.
[00:46:10.660 --> 00:46:14.300]   They are slaves of Satan.
[00:46:14.300 --> 00:46:20.460]   They have been blinded by the God of this world.
[00:46:20.460 --> 00:46:22.880]   Can there be any other explanation?
[00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:28.660]   As you look at the two types of life, in every respect, from beginning to end, the masters,
[00:46:28.660 --> 00:46:32.820]   the type of life lived, the things it leads to, and the ultimate end, as you look at the
[00:46:32.820 --> 00:46:38.340]   two and see people rejecting the glory and deliberately choosing the other and boasting
[00:46:38.340 --> 00:46:41.260]   of it and gloating in it, I say, what explains it?
[00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:47.500]   There is only one explanation—they are dead in trespasses and sins.
[00:46:47.500 --> 00:46:53.560]   They are the slaves of sin and Satan.
[00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:59.820]   They are blinded by the God of this world.
[00:46:59.820 --> 00:47:05.020]   What is it that explains, then, that any one of us is a Christian?
[00:47:05.020 --> 00:47:11.260]   Because we were all like that, we are all born like that, what makes any man a Christian?
[00:47:11.260 --> 00:47:18.060]   Oh, 'tis grace, 'tis wondrous grace!
[00:47:18.060 --> 00:47:27.340]   There is no other explanation, a debtor to mercy alone, of covenant mercy, I sing.
[00:47:27.340 --> 00:47:31.620]   Nothing else, nothing of which we can boast.
[00:47:31.620 --> 00:47:37.000]   It is all God's infinite kindness and compassion.
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:42.300]   It is because of the exceeding riches of his grace.
[00:47:42.300 --> 00:47:45.660]   It is because of his abundant mercy.
[00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:51.220]   It is because God is love.
[00:47:51.220 --> 00:48:02.260]   Oh, may this love, this grace, possess us all and so deal with us that we shall feel
[00:48:02.260 --> 00:48:09.820]   that the exhortations that we have met in this chapter, in verses twelve and thirteen,
[00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:20.300]   and in verse nineteen, is something that comes to us as the height of reasonableness.
[00:48:20.300 --> 00:48:24.220]   We mustn't yield our bodies.
[00:48:24.220 --> 00:48:30.380]   We mustn't allow sin to reign in our mortal flesh or yield our instruments and our members
[00:48:30.380 --> 00:48:35.940]   as servants and implements of unrighteousness and sin.
[00:48:35.940 --> 00:48:44.140]   Seeing this, we must gladly obey the exhortation and yield our every faculty and all we have
[00:48:44.140 --> 00:48:57.720]   and are as instruments and servants and vehicles and implements of righteousness unto holiness
[00:48:57.720 --> 00:49:02.220]   and to the praise of our glorious God.
[00:49:02.220 --> 00:49:15.260]   The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our
[00:49:15.260 --> 00:49:16.260]   Lord.
[00:49:16.260 --> 00:49:19.660]   Do you already possess the installment?
[00:49:19.660 --> 00:49:23.740]   Do you know that the first stirrings are within you?
[00:49:23.740 --> 00:49:33.540]   Do you look with anticipation at the glory which is coming, at the crown of righteousness
[00:49:33.540 --> 00:49:38.080]   which God himself will place upon your brow?
[00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:47.900]   Do you meditate upon this bliss, this wonder that is awaiting us to be with Christ, to
[00:49:47.900 --> 00:49:56.020]   be basking in the sunshine of God's glory, to be glorified ourselves and to spend our
[00:49:56.020 --> 00:50:00.140]   eternity in that glorious condition?
[00:50:00.140 --> 00:50:01.420]   Amen.
[00:50:01.420 --> 00:50:15.340]   O Lord, our God, we know not how to come to thank thee for this amazing, wondrous grace.
[00:50:15.340 --> 00:50:17.820]   We humbly bow before thee.
[00:50:17.820 --> 00:50:27.860]   Lord, thou knowest our hearts, how we realize that we owe all unto thee and to thy matchless
[00:50:27.860 --> 00:50:28.860]   grace.
[00:50:28.860 --> 00:50:38.340]   O God, grant that we may so see it, that we shall hate sin with a deadly hatred and live
[00:50:38.340 --> 00:50:48.340]   only to thy glory, live only to be used of thee and to tell forth thy prayers.
[00:50:48.340 --> 00:50:55.220]   Grant that we may so see it, that we shall learn more and more to look to the glory that
[00:50:55.220 --> 00:51:00.540]   awaits us, that we may be able to say with thy servant of old, while we look not at the
[00:51:00.540 --> 00:51:05.460]   things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen, for the things which are seen
[00:51:05.460 --> 00:51:09.340]   are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal.
[00:51:09.340 --> 00:51:13.900]   Grant that we may so see it, that whatever hardship may come to meet us, however great
[00:51:13.900 --> 00:51:20.140]   the trials may be, we shall be able to say, down in the depth of our being, our light
[00:51:20.140 --> 00:51:30.740]   affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight
[00:51:30.740 --> 00:51:31.740]   of glory.
[00:51:31.740 --> 00:51:40.140]   O God, grant unto us such glimpses of it, that we shall set our affections on things
[00:51:40.140 --> 00:51:44.740]   above, not on things which are on the earth.
[00:51:44.740 --> 00:51:51.340]   O God, we bless thy name, that this salvation is thine, that we are thy slaves, that we
[00:51:51.340 --> 00:51:53.180]   are in thy hands.
[00:51:53.180 --> 00:51:59.620]   We gladly leave ourselves there and pray that thou wouldst go on with thy glorious work
[00:51:59.620 --> 00:52:08.300]   within us, changed from glory into glory, till in heaven we take our place, till we
[00:52:08.300 --> 00:52:17.300]   cast our crowns before thee, lost in wonder, love, and prayer.
[00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:22.460]   And now, may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship and
[00:52:22.460 --> 00:52:28.940]   the communion of the Holy Spirit, abide and continue with us, now this night, throughout
[00:52:28.940 --> 00:52:36.900]   the remainder of this our short and certain earthly life and pilgrimage, and until we
[00:52:36.900 --> 00:52:41.780]   arrive in the glory.
[00:52:41.780 --> 00:52:43.080]   Amen.
