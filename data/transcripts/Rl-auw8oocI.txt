[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Pastor John's new book is about the precious doctrine of God's providence.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   The title is simply "Providence." God governs over all that
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   he has created. He reveals this to us in a thousand
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   texts. More than a thousand texts in the Bible. It's all over the place.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   And by welcoming us into this incredible revealed reality,
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   God calls us to see and savor this truth for ourselves.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   He wants us to treasure his providence so much that it brings
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   tangible change to how we live our lives. To that end,
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   we are setting aside Wednesdays on the podcast to look at a few of the implications.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   There are ten of them in the series. Last time, in episode 1583,
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   we looked at how the providence of God protects us from the trivializing
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   effects of contemporary culture and from the widespread habit
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   of trifling with everything, even the great
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   things of God. That was implication number four.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   Here now with implication number five is Pastor John to explain.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   I suppose, Tony, that among all the
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   challenges that characterize our lives and the lives of
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   those who write to us, the frustrations of ordinary
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   life and how to cope with them are
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   right near the top of our concerns. In other words, things
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   come into our lives that are unplanned, unexpected,
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   either very frustrating or sometimes
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   very painful. And the question is,
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   is it possible to be patient with all
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   the unexpected, frustrating things that come into our lives?
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   And that's where this fifth real-life
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   benefit of seeing and savoring the all-pervading
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   providence of God, the purposeful sovereignty
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   of God, comes into play.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   And it is this. Believing the providence of God,
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   embracing the providence of God, enables us
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   to be patient and faithful in
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   the long, dragged-out, often unexpected
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   trials of life amidst the most inexplicable
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   circumstances, detours,
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   delays that from our limited viewpoint make
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   no sense. Believing the providence of God
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   transforms that experience.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   James, in his book, in the New Testament,
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   points us to the connection between God's providence and our
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   patience. James 5, 7, "Be patient,
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   brothers, until the coming of the Lord.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   Behold, the farmer waits for the precious
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   produce of the soil, being patient about it until he
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   gets the early and late rains. You too, be
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   patient as an example, brothers, of
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   suffering and patience." You have heard of Job
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   and the endurance of Job
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   and have seen the outcome of the Lord's dealings,
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   that the Lord is full of compassion
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   and is merciful. So James
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   says that our patience in life
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   as we, like a farmer, sow our seed
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   faithfully in the spring and then wait and wait
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   and the summer months are long and they're hot and we don't know
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   if the seed is growing the way we want. Our patience
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   as we wait will be strengthened
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   and sustained if we look at the story of Job
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   and take special notice of his endurance
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   and God's passion and love and care.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   He calls it "merciful purpose" in it all,
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   which is amazing because it's a very painful story.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   Satan gets permission from God in chapter 1 of Job
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   and God permits Satan to actually kill
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   all 10 of Job's children and Job meets the news
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   by falling on his face in verses 20 and 21 of
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   chapter 1 and worshipping the Lord instead of hating God
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   for taking his children and says, "Blessed
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   be the Lord. The Lord gave and the Lord has taken
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   away." Satan then returns to God
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   again and he gets permission to go afflict Job
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   with boils from the top of his head to the bottom
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   of his feet and his wife tells him, "Look, just curse
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   God and die." And Job responds again
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   with patience and endurance in faith in God's providence
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   and says, "Shall we receive good at the hand of the
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   Lord and not receive evil?" And at the end
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   of the book in chapter 42, Job expresses
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   one of the most sweeping and powerful statements
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   of God's providence in all the Bible when he says,
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   "I know that you can do all things and that no
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   purpose of yours can be thwarted."
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   And for that faithfulness, God
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   had mercy on Job and restored his fortunes
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   including his children and James says
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   that lesson in providence from the book of Job
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   is the foundation of the patience of our
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   life. So, saturate your mind
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   with such scriptures day after day. Be exposed
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   to God's utterly unexpected ways in
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   the Bible until you become accustomed
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   to trust him in the dark because of what he's shown you
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   in the light, especially the light of his word. Isaiah
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   55, 8 says, "My thoughts are not your thoughts,
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   neither are your ways. My ways, declares the Lord."
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   And then let's immerse ourselves
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   in the biblical portrayals of his providence.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   If we do that, we become less vulnerable to panic,
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   less vulnerable to perplexity and dread because
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   God has shown us again and again and again
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   that things are not what they seem and that he is always
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   weaving something wise out of the painful
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   perplexing threads that look like a tangle
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   in our lives. Think, just think of this. This has
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   moved me so much. Think what practical
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   effect it would have on our lives for
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   wonderful counterintuitive patience if we believed
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   that our frustrating delay at the red traffic light
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   was God's keeping us back from an accident about to happen.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   Or if we believed that getting our leg broken
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   in the accident was God's way of revealing
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   an early cancer in our leg
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   that because it's discovered would save our lives for
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   another 50 years instead of dying
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   within a year. Would we be angry that he ordained
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   the breaking of our leg if that was the case? Or if we
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   believed that the frustrating middle of the night phone call that made us
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   so angry that we were awakened was only to help us smell the smoke
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   in the basement and keep our house from being burned down.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   God says in his word that's what he's doing
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   in every one of our frustrations. Yes, he is.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   The key to patience is faith
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   in the all-embracing, all-guiding, all-wise, all-
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   gracious providence of God to transform all the interruptions
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   of his children into rewards.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   Can we not then write in big letters
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   as a heading over our lives and over every frustration
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   "Satan, you meant that for evil. God meant
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   it for good." Is the great Romans 8:28
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   really true? Can it be believed that owing to
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   God's all-pervading, all-embracing, all-wise, all-gracious
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   providence, God is working everything together for
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   our good as his children?
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   One closing story. Benjamin Warfield was a world-renowned
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   theologian who taught at
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   Princeton Seminary for almost 34 years until his death in 1921.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   Many people are aware of his famous
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   book, The Inspiration and Authority of the Bible, but
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   what most people don't know is that in 1876
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   at the age of 25 he married Annie Pierce Kincade,
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   took a honeymoon to Germany, and during a storm
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   Annie was struck by lightning and
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   permanently paralyzed on their honeymoon.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   After caring for her patiently
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   for 39 years,
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   Warfield laid her to rest in 1915 and there was no
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   Job-like restoration at the end of that story,
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   only death into the arms of Jesus and someday a new
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   body. Because of Annie's extraordinary needs,
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   Warfield almost never left his
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   home for more than two hours at a time for
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   39 years. But when Warfield
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   came to write his thoughts on Romans 8:28,
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   this is what he wrote, "The fundamental thought
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   is the universal government of God, providence.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   All that comes to you is under
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   his controlling hand. The secondary thought
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   is the favor of God to those that love him.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   If he governs all, then nothing but
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   good can befall those to whom
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   he would do good. He will so govern
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   all things that we shall reap only good
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   from all that befalls us."
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   That is the root and power
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   of beautiful patience
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   and steadfastness in Job, in Warfield,
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   and in you. So the fifth
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   real-life effect of seeing and savoring
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   the providence of God is the amazing power to be
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   patient and faithful through the most
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   inexplicable circumstances of life.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   So let's sing with William Cooper, "Judge not
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   the Lord by feeble sense, but trust him for his
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   grace behind a frowning providence.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   He hides a smiling face."
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   Beautiful patience. That's how we get it, through seeing and savoring the providence
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   of God. That's incredible. Thank you, Pastor John. It's pretty sobering to stand
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   over the matching graves of Benjamin Warfield and his bride Annie
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   off by themselves, side by side, in the Princeton Cemetery.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   If you live near Princeton, New Jersey, you can go and see them and witness a sort of
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   monument to love and patience that comes from treasuring God's
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   providence. It's really moving. We return Friday to hear from a
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   heartbroken father of a teenage daughter who is living in sin.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   She is sexually active. The father is hurting and wants to know
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   what to do next. Pastor John will weigh in and try to help
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   this dad. That's next time. On Friday, I'm Tony Rehnke, your host, and we will
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   see you then. Thanks for listening.
