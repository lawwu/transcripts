[00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:05.320]   Hi, Cal.
[00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:06.280]   My name is Jeff.
[00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.320]   I work as a chief of staff in the R&D org
[00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.400]   at a large tech firm.
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.480]   In my role, I take many, many meetings each week
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.720]   with a wide range of stakeholder teams and individuals
[00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.520]   and leads.
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.480]   Many of these meetings recur over time,
[00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.680]   so I maintain agenda documents to help
[00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.680]   me come to those meetings prepared, capture notes,
[00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.480]   as well as action items.
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.720]   Ultimately, this adds up to a pretty decent amount
[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.240]   of overhead, and I'm not sure it's an optimal way
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.960]   to approach agendas and notes for future reference
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.880]   and the capturing of action items
[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.840]   that eventually flow into my main system.
[00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.440]   I'd love any thoughts you have on how you approach meeting
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.960]   prep, how you capture notes or decide whether notes are worth
[00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.480]   capturing over time, and any takeaways when
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.640]   you work with so many different collaborating teams
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.080]   and stakeholders.
[00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.440]   Thanks so much for the podcast and all the terrific books
[00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.520]   and articles that you've authored over the years.
[00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.800]   They've been both inspirational and a really big help
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.400]   to me personally.
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.240]   Well, when it comes to a meeting-heavy schedule,
[00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.000]   I tend to believe that processing is actually
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.080]   a more important and more efficient way of making
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.600]   sense of meetings than prep.
[00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.800]   So let's put these two things in the contrast.
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.240]   Prep is about what you do in advance.
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.280]   Let's put together these agenda documents.
[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.320]   Let's have all the information, this document.
[00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.360]   We can then be the place where the notes ultimately reside,
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.080]   et cetera.
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.400]   Let's make sure that we come into the meetings
[00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.280]   and what we're going to talk about.
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.440]   That's important.
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.640]   But we often, I think, neglect the time
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.680]   after the meeting to make sense of everything that happened.
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.040]   And so to me, if you had to choose just one thing
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.480]   to add to your meeting schedule to help keep your arms around
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.360]   all of these things, it would be this rule
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.960]   that I've talked about often that when you schedule
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.360]   a meeting, as part of that meeting,
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.600]   you schedule immediately after it time for processing it.
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.120]   And that goes right on your calendar,
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.480]   so that time is now captured.
[00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.880]   So if you have a meeting from 1 to 1:30,
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.000]   you schedule 1 to 1:45.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.720]   And you delineate on your calendar 1:30 to 1:45
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.560]   is for processing.
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.600]   So now that time is taken.
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.360]   No one can take that with another meeting.
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.280]   You're not available to 1:45.
[00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.640]   Now, in that processing time, you
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.720]   say, I need to close every single loop that
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.720]   was opened in this meeting.
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.360]   Now you're flexible.
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.160]   Some meetings, you just need to get things
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.880]   into your existing systems.
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.280]   You don't need an extra infrastructure here
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.800]   of shared agenda documents where notes and tasks go.
[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.680]   Because I'll tell you what, the other people
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.360]   aren't going to look at them.
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.680]   Unless they work for you and you force them,
[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:37.760]   they're not going to look at those things.
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.160]   So you might just be putting this into your systems.
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.960]   Reminder on my calendar, a task in my task list,
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.560]   update my weekly plan, et cetera.
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.360]   When you do have systems, maybe there's
[00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.960]   particular types of meetings that happen recurringly,
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.500]   and you have some sort of task board
[00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.760]   for keeping track of what's going on with this project.
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:55.260]   That's fine.
[00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.200]   You can update those systems then
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.040]   after that meeting is done.
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.040]   So prep is important.
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.120]   And I think we put a lot of attention on prep.
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.760]   We hear a lot of stories like Bezos at Amazon
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.280]   requiring you to write these really to-the-point memos
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.120]   before he will attend a meeting where it's incredibly clear,
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.880]   this is what this meeting is about.
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.680]   This is why we need to have a meeting here,
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.020]   the decisions that need to be made.
[00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:20.320]   Here's all the relevant information
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.600]   that you can read beforehand.
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.060]   I think that's all great, and where that's relevant, do that.
[00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.600]   But we don't spend nearly enough time
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.480]   on how do you close those loops.
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.240]   Because the thing that's going to kill you
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.000]   is if you go from meeting to meeting to meeting,
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.120]   don't get a close to loop from one before you start the next.
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.000]   It all piles up, and it becomes very stressful and very anxiety
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.040]   producing.
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.940]   And you lose things, and they get jumbled,
[00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.280]   and your energy gets lost, and your effectiveness
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.040]   as an executive is going to plummet.
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.000]   So remember, a meeting has two parts.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.640]   The part that everyone knows about,
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.280]   because everyone's in the same space
[00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.160]   for a certain period of time, and the part that immediately
[00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.360]   follows, where you are by yourself making sense
[00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.120]   of everything that was just discussed.
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.400]   Don't neglect that second part.
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.040]   I think you're going to find that you're
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.240]   able to handle these meetings with much more
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.280]   cognitive agility.
