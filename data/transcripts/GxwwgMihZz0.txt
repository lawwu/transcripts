[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.840]   O Lord our God, have mercy upon us.
[00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:12.320]   Forgive us especially, we pray Thee, again for our folly, for our foolish talking about
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:19.560]   our century and the modern men, as if anything had changed.
[00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:26.240]   Awaken us, we pray Thee, and bring us to see that Thy method is still the same, that the
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:34.980]   truth remains unchanged and unchanging, and that the power of the blessed Holy Spirit
[00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.340]   is in no sense diminished.
[00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:48.440]   Lord hear us, revive Thy work, O Lord, Thy mighty arm make bare.
[00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:57.200]   Speak with a voice that wakes the dead and make the people hear, and unto Thee, and unto
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:06.000]   Thee alone shall we give all the praise and the honor and the glory, both now and forever.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   Amen.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:17.320]   I should like to call your attention this evening to the first four verses in that second
[00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:23.760]   chapter of the epistle to the Hebrews, which was read to us at the beginning.
[00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:30.920]   "Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest
[00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.280]   at any time we should let them slip.
[00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:44.760]   For if the word spoken by angels was steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:54.360]   a just recompense of reward, how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation, which
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:02.720]   at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:03.720]   him?
[00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:12.120]   God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles and gifts
[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.040]   of the Holy Ghost according to his own will."
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.860]   But I want in particular to call attention to that great question which is put to us
[00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.800]   at the beginning of the third verse.
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:33.600]   How shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation?
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:44.320]   Now here you notice the author of this epistle is addressing this first word of exhortation
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.880]   to these Hebrew Christians to whom he was writing.
[00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:56.480]   And he tells us at once what his entire object was in writing the whole epistle.
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:03.000]   It was to remind them of the things that they were tending to let slip.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.800]   We ought, he says, to give them an earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.880]   at any time we should let them slip.
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:17.280]   Some of these authorities say a better translation would be lest we slip away from them.
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.880]   They say it's the picture of a ship tending to slip away from her moorings.
[00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.200]   However, it comes to the same thing.
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:32.320]   The trouble with these people was that they were tending to forget the things they'd heard,
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:37.120]   and tending to do so to such an extent that some of them were even looking back to their
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.080]   old Jewish religion.
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:48.680]   And so he calls them back to this, exhorting them to give them an earnest heed to this,
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:56.840]   and to be very careful that they never drifted away from this great and glorious message.
[00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:02.200]   Well now, I call attention to it tonight because I feel that many of us who are Christians
[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:07.200]   need this same exhortation in this hour, day, and generation.
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.960]   That's one object which I have in mind in directing your attention to this.
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:17.600]   Another is this, that should there be anyone here tonight who doesn't claim to be a Christian
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:23.720]   and who's not a member of the Christian church, let me give you a good reason for believing
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.000]   this gospel.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.760]   Let me put it even like this.
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.600]   Why should we go on with this business of the Christian church?
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.680]   What's the point of a conference like this?
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.600]   Why should the Christian church continue?
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:43.440]   There are many in the world today who are saying that the church has become a kind of
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:49.160]   anachronism and that we might as well shut the doors, and that it's almost an insult
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.480]   to the modern men to ask him to consider this message.
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:58.920]   Well now, let's remind ourselves this evening in this conference as to why we should go
[00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:07.280]   on preaching the gospel and doing this primary work which has been allocated to the Christian
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.280]   church.
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:13.040]   Here we have it in this way that this man puts it to us.
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.960]   We invite the world to listen to us.
[00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.560]   Why do we do so?
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:26.200]   It is because we are preaching to it so great a salvation.
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.840]   This is our message.
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.340]   That's why we should hold on to it.
[00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:36.680]   That is why everybody else should listen to it and receive it.
[00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.400]   Well now, let's look at this statement.
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.800]   Is the man justified in describing it in this way?
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.620]   What is the message of the Christian church?
[00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.060]   Let me ask that again.
[00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:50.280]   We can never ask this question too frequently at the present time.
[00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:56.400]   There is this terrible confusion as to what the message of the Christian faith really
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:57.400]   is.
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:03.280]   And this man reminds us at once that it is a message of salvation.
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:14.200]   It is deliverance, emancipation, healing, liberty, health, vigor, power, salvation.
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:20.680]   This is the character of this message which we have been given to proclaim.
[00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:28.580]   But you notice that this man is not content with merely describing it as a salvation.
[00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:33.140]   He describes it as so great a salvation.
[00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:36.120]   And of course he does that quite deliberately.
[00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:41.040]   These foolish Hebrew Christians have been tending to lose sight of this.
[00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:45.800]   Their whole trouble really was that they had not realized as they should have done the
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:50.040]   greatness of this so great salvation.
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:52.800]   So he reminds them of it at once.
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:59.360]   That it is the biggest and the greatest thing that the world has ever known or ever can
[00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:01.140]   know.
[00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:05.800]   And it is to this aspect that I want to direct attention in particular tonight.
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:13.000]   The greatness of this salvation of ours in Christ Jesus.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:20.880]   Now you will know, those who are still familiar with their scriptures, that the Bible itself,
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:29.880]   the New Testament in particular, always describes this salvation in these superlative terms.
[00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:35.060]   The very picture which is given to us always of this salvation in the New Testament is
[00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:39.440]   its greatness, its grandeur, its largeness.
[00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:47.080]   Take the Apostle Paul for instance in the second chapter of his epistle to the Ephesians.
[00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:51.480]   Language seems almost to fail him.
[00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:55.280]   He talks about grace, but he is not content with that.
[00:07:55.280 --> 00:08:00.960]   He talks about the exceeding riches of God's grace.
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:05.080]   His kindness toward us and his love.
[00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:12.160]   Indeed in the third chapter of that same epistle he talks about the unsearchable riches of
[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:13.160]   Christ.
[00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.200]   It is so big.
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:23.100]   He talks then later on about the love of Christ which passeth knowledge.
[00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:24.100]   These are his terms.
[00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:31.260]   "Unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we can ask or think."
[00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:39.020]   You see these are the characteristic ways in which this great salvation is described
[00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:41.260]   by the great Apostle himself.
[00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.500]   And this is characteristic of all the other writers.
[00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:50.420]   No man can read the New Testament with his eyes open in a spiritual sense without getting
[00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:56.820]   this impression that this is something tremendous and magnificent.
[00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:05.060]   But that way of thinking of it and describing it is by no means confined to the New Testament.
[00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:09.900]   The really great hymns always do the same thing.
[00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:13.260]   Now there are, you know, hymns and hymns.
[00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.460]   We've been singing great ones tonight.
[00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:16.820]   Thank God for that.
[00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:20.660]   But all the hymns in this book and other books are not great hymns.
[00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:27.260]   There are sentimental ditties that were mostly composed about the middle of the last century.
[00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:33.760]   But when you get the great hymns, namely the hymns of the 18th century, you'll find that
[00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:39.060]   they always bring out this element of bigness and of greatness.
[00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:41.700]   Take a man like Isaac Watts.
[00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:50.180]   When he looks at the cross, this is what he says, "When I survey the wondrous cross."
[00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:54.900]   The cross is not something that you can take a fleeting glance at.
[00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:56.660]   It's too big for that.
[00:09:56.660 --> 00:10:02.340]   It's like a man standing on top of a mountain and viewing some great panorama that stretches
[00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:04.540]   out before him almost endlessly.
[00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:08.500]   "When I survey the wondrous cross."
[00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:12.380]   The bigness, you see, the greatness of it all.
[00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:14.860]   Or take Charles Wesley again.
[00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:18.460]   This is how Charles Wesley puts it in another hymn.
[00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:26.980]   "Oh," he says, "for a thousand tongues to sing my great Redeemer's praise."
[00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:29.260]   What's the use of one tongue?
[00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:30.620]   What's the use of ten tongues?
[00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:32.460]   What's the use of a hundred tongues?
[00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:39.380]   "Oh, for a thousand tongues to sing my great Redeemer's praise."
[00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:46.460]   You see, he got a glimpse of this greatness, this bigness, this vastness of this so great
[00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:47.460]   salvation.
[00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:53.220]   And I could quote you many other great hymns which say exactly the same thing.
[00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:57.460]   But again, this is not confined even to the hymn books.
[00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:03.100]   When you turn to the realm of art, you've got a glimpse that some of the greatest masterpieces
[00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:09.520]   in art have been inspired by this salvation, this gospel.
[00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:15.560]   You can see some of these great paintings on the ceilings of buildings in Italy and
[00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:16.560]   in other places.
[00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:22.920]   It was but an attempt on the part of these artists to express this greatness.
[00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:25.020]   You get it even in architecture.
[00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:29.620]   Look at those great cathedrals on the continent of Europe.
[00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:31.900]   You people are fond of coming over to have a look at them.
[00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:34.300]   The ruins even are worth looking at.
[00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:35.700]   And these other great cathedrals.
[00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:39.740]   Well, now some of us perhaps don't believe in cathedrals, but at Emirate we've got a
[00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:45.900]   grant this, that the object and the intention of the men who put up those magnificent edifices
[00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:47.540]   was this.
[00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:51.240]   With their great vaults and headroom, what were they doing?
[00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:58.340]   They were trying to give an impression of the bigness, the exalted character, the magnificence
[00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:03.320]   of this great salvation that was being preached in the building.
[00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:09.820]   So you see, even in architecture, you get it in sculpture and in almost every other
[00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:11.060]   respect.
[00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:19.000]   If you are interested in oratory and in eloquence, and that's not to be despised, you must agree
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:25.480]   again that some of the most eloquent orations that have ever been delivered in this world
[00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:28.940]   have been delivered by preachers.
[00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:33.260]   Great preaching, great oratory, and great eloquence.
[00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:36.100]   The modern world knows little about this.
[00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:40.900]   But I believe I'm right in saying, and I've studied a little bit of your history, that
[00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:46.860]   probably the greatest preacher that this continent has ever known was a man of the name of Samuel
[00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:52.420]   Davis, who lived just over 200 years ago.
[00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:59.340]   The man who wrote that hymn, again expressing exactly the same thing, "Great God of wonders,
[00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:07.020]   all thy ways are God-like, matchless and divine, but the fair glories of thy grace more wondrous
[00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:09.580]   and unrivaled shine."
[00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:10.580]   The same thing.
[00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:14.560]   Well, I am saying, if you're interested in oratory and eloquence, you'll find that this
[00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:20.780]   gospel has produced some of the most eloquent orations that the world has ever known.
[00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:25.800]   And when we come to the realm of music, nobody can dispute this.
[00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:32.380]   Probably the greatest single piece of music that's ever been composed was Handel's Messiah.
[00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:34.880]   What a magnificent piece of work it is.
[00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:36.720]   But what produced it?
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:39.460]   What led Handel to write the Messiah?
[00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:42.740]   Fortunately for us, Handel himself has told us.
[00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:49.340]   He tells us that during that extremely short period of time in which he composed that great
[00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:55.720]   masterpiece, he said, "I did feel as if I were lifted up into the heavens and did see
[00:13:55.720 --> 00:14:00.380]   something of the glory of the great God."
[00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:03.460]   That's the explanation of the Hallelujah Chorus.
[00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:09.480]   Not musical genius, but that he'd had a glimpse of the glory of the great God.
[00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:15.440]   So you get your Hallelujah Chorus, "Worthy is the Lamb," the mightiest music that the
[00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:18.080]   world has ever known.
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:28.000]   All is just expressive of the greatness and the magnificence of this so great salvation.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.840]   Very well, my friends, I make no apology for putting a question to you before we go any
[00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:33.980]   further.
[00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:39.080]   Do you habitually think of this gospel in that way?
[00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:43.600]   Do you habitually think of your own salvation in that way?
[00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:48.680]   Do you think of it as the greatest and the biggest thing that you know, and the most
[00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:51.440]   wonderful thing that has ever happened to you?
[00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:54.760]   But I'll ask a yet more serious question.
[00:14:54.760 --> 00:15:00.040]   Do you give your neighbors the impression that you've got the greatest and the biggest
[00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:01.640]   thing in the world?
[00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:03.240]   I've said it before this week.
[00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:05.400]   I repeat it again tonight.
[00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:11.360]   I have a terrible fear that many people are outside the Christian church because so many
[00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:18.120]   of us give them the impression that what we've got is something very small, very narrow,
[00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:21.180]   very cramped and confined.
[00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:26.040]   We haven't given them the impression that by not being Christian, they are missing the
[00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:32.880]   biggest, the grandest, the most glorious thing in the entire universe.
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:34.840]   That's what this man is claiming for it.
[00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:40.600]   The whole trouble with these Hebrew Christians was they'd lost sight of this greatness.
[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:43.720]   And so they were going back to something else.
[00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:46.440]   Well now then, here's the question.
[00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:49.960]   Is this man just indulging in hyperbole?
[00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:58.880]   Or is he justified in describing this salvation as so great salvation?
[00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:02.840]   In what senses is it right to describe it in this way?
[00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:06.120]   I'm going to answer the question for you in his own terms.
[00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:07.760]   It's his answer, not mine.
[00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:10.000]   I'm simply expounding what he says.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.800]   In what sense is this legitimately described as so great a salvation?
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:23.680]   Well the first answer is that it is great in its authorship, great in its origin, great
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:26.600]   in its genesis.
[00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:35.520]   Now you judge the greatness, don't you, of any work, any written book.
[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:41.560]   You judge its greatness generally in terms of the authorship.
[00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:46.560]   When you go to your public library to borrow a book, how do you decide what book to borrow?
[00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:53.880]   Well, I suggest that generally we do so in terms, do we not, of the author, whom we regard
[00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:54.880]   as a great author.
[00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:59.640]   It doesn't matter very much what he may have written as long as it's written by him.
[00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:05.760]   The author establishes the value of the book in our estimate, and that's quite right.
[00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:10.200]   A very good way, indeed there is probably none better, of estimating the value of anything
[00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:13.180]   is in terms of the authorship.
[00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:16.040]   This applies not only, of course, to books.
[00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:17.960]   It's equally true of art.
[00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:23.160]   Let me give you a simple illustration to prove this and to establish this.
[00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:31.440]   I remember reading in our papers in London about five or six years ago of something that
[00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:38.120]   had happened in a sale room the night before, one of our great sale rooms, Sotheby's.
[00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:43.560]   And this received quite a good deal of prominence in the press, and this was the story.
[00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:53.040]   A painting had been sold the previous night in Sotheby's sale for £136,000, multiply
[00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:56.160]   that roughly by three and you've got it in dollars.
[00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:59.320]   Well, you say, what was the excitement about that?
[00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:03.280]   These paintings often fetch tremendous prices these days.
[00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:07.520]   Well, they went on to tell the story, and the story was this.
[00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:15.320]   The man who'd sold that painting the night before for £136,000 had bought it himself
[00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:20.720]   some years previously for something less than £100.
[00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:28.040]   Well, the story was that he was in an antique shop one day and rummaging round, not looking
[00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:29.760]   for anything in particular.
[00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:34.080]   He suddenly saw a painting in a corner, and something about it attracted his attention.
[00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:35.120]   He pulled it out.
[00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:40.440]   It was covered with dust, but he just dusted it a bit and looked at it, and he liked it.
[00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:44.360]   So he asked how much it was, and it was something under £100.
[00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:46.140]   He bought it and he took it home.
[00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:47.280]   He cleaned it up.
[00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:52.720]   He put a nice new frame on it, and he put it on the wall with his other paintings.
[00:18:52.720 --> 00:19:00.240]   Years later, a friend of his, who was a well-known artist, happened to call to visit him, and
[00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:05.720]   this man was proudly showing his collection of pictures to this artist, and the artist
[00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:08.760]   began looking at them and looked at one and went on to the other.
[00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:10.320]   Then he suddenly came to this one.
[00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:12.320]   "Wait a minute," he said.
[00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:14.680]   "Do you know what you've got here?"
[00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:16.240]   "Well, no," said the man.
[00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:21.360]   "All I know is that I like it very much myself," and he told him the story of how he'd bought
[00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:24.560]   it and how it constantly pleased him.
[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:26.240]   He was never tired of looking at it.
[00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:30.160]   "Oh, yes, I know," says the artist, "but do you realise what you've got here?"
[00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:32.160]   "Well, no," says the man.
[00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:35.000]   "I've never known who exactly painted this."
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.080]   "Well, unless I'm very greatly mistaken," said the artist.
[00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:44.520]   "This is a painting by El Greco, the great Spanish master."
[00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:48.400]   And he was so sure of it that they got the biggest experts down from London.
[00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:52.440]   They treated it with chemicals, they x-rayed it, they did all the things that are being
[00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:58.600]   done today, and the experts were unanimous in saying that this was undoubtedly a painting
[00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:01.320]   by El Greco.
[00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:07.600]   You see what happens when you don't know who's painted it less than a hundred pounds, when
[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:12.680]   you know that it's painted by El Greco, one hundred and thirty-six thousand pounds.
[00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:15.320]   It's still the same painting, remember?
[00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:22.800]   You estimate the value, you see, by the painter, by the author, by the one who has produced
[00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:23.800]   it.
[00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:26.840]   That's exactly the argument that this man is employing here.
[00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:27.840]   Listen.
[00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:33.720]   "How shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation, which at the first began to be
[00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:36.920]   spoken by the Lord?"
[00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:38.520]   That's the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:43.840]   "And was confirmed unto us by them that heard him, God also bearing them witness,"
[00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:49.280]   that's God the Father, "both with signs and wonders, and with diverse miracles and gifts
[00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:55.880]   of the Holy Ghost, the third person in the blessed Holy Trinity."
[00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:58.800]   Why is this so great a salvation?
[00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:01.160]   Here's the first answer.
[00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:06.800]   It is something that has been produced by the blessed Holy Trinity.
[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:08.640]   That's why you and I should hold on to it.
[00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:12.080]   That's why we should ask the whole world to listen to it.
[00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:14.840]   Look at the world in its terrible trouble.
[00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:17.760]   They have listened to the speeches of statesmen.
[00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:22.880]   They have listened to the philosophers, the scientists, the sociologists, the educationists.
[00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:24.080]   They have listened to everybody.
[00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:26.240]   The world goes from bad to worse.
[00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:28.240]   What is our challenge to the world tonight?
[00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:29.240]   It's this.
[00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:34.740]   Come to church and listen to what God has got to say about it all.
[00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:37.200]   This isn't the word of men.
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:39.840]   This is the word of God.
[00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:40.840]   Listen to it.
[00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:43.920]   This man was so full of this, you see, that he can't contain himself.
[00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:49.000]   He doesn't even have trouble to write a preliminary salutation as he writes this letter to these
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   people.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.600]   He bursts upon them with their message.
[00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:56.920]   And this is what he says, "God, who at sundry times and in diverse manners spake in times
[00:21:56.920 --> 00:22:03.840]   past unto the fathers by the prophets, hath in these last days spoken unto us in his Son."
[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:06.120]   It's God speaking.
[00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:08.640]   This is the greatest word in the world.
[00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:14.600]   Here is the explanation of the state of the modern world, the predicament of the individual
[00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:16.340]   and the whole of society.
[00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:18.320]   This is man's diagnosis.
[00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:21.880]   It's God's diagnosis and God's remedy for it.
[00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:27.000]   It is the authorship that makes it so great.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:34.320]   The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit cooperated together to use the theological term as a
[00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:40.320]   kind of economic trinity to produce this so great salvation.
[00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:42.760]   Well, there is your first reason.
[00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:45.040]   And indeed, you know, that's enough.
[00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:48.680]   In many senses, I might as well stop now and pronounce the benediction.
[00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:53.360]   But we're all like these Hebrews, dull of hearing, so perhaps I'd better go on and give
[00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:54.920]   you some further reasons.
[00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:58.560]   But that, you know, ought to be enough and more than enough for us.
[00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:03.120]   It is the word of God and not the words of men.
[00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:06.440]   But listen, he's got a second reason.
[00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:19.120]   He says this is so great a salvation because it saves us from a great and a terrible calamity.
[00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:25.440]   How shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation?
[00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:31.360]   You measure the greatness of the salvation by measuring the greatness of the calamity
[00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:33.520]   from which it saves us.
[00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:38.520]   Now we are familiar with calamities these days, are we not?
[00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:45.720]   But these are nothing compared with the calamity that faces the soul that doesn't accept and
[00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:48.200]   believe this gospel.
[00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:51.520]   How shall we escape?
[00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:54.600]   The calamity is so terrible, so terrifying.
[00:23:54.600 --> 00:24:00.320]   Let me again bring out this point by using a simple illustration.
[00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:06.320]   How do you estimate the value of a drug?
[00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:10.360]   Drugs that are prescribed by doctors, how do you estimate their value?
[00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:14.000]   Well, I suggest that you do so like this.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.840]   Take a little drug known as aspirin.
[00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:18.840]   Very useful little drug.
[00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:22.120]   If you've got a headache, take aspirin.
[00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:25.080]   Aches and pains, take aspirin.
[00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:26.660]   Wonderful little drug.
[00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:28.120]   But it's very cheap, isn't it?
[00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:31.800]   You can buy many tablets of aspirin for very little money.
[00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:32.800]   Why?
[00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:38.360]   Well, you see, it only deals with aches and pains and headaches and things like that.
[00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:41.720]   But there are other drugs which are very expensive.
[00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:45.400]   They've sometimes been called miracle drugs.
[00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:46.720]   These are wonderful drugs.
[00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:47.720]   Why?
[00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:54.280]   Well, because these drugs can cure not only headaches and aches and pains, they can cure
[00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:57.240]   the most terrible diseases.
[00:24:57.240 --> 00:25:06.000]   I remember 40 years ago and even after that, a time when if a doctor diagnosed a disease
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:11.560]   like tubercular meningitis, he might as well have sat down immediately and write out the
[00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:12.560]   death certificate.
[00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:13.560]   Why?
[00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:18.520]   Well, because tubercular meningitis was invariably fatal.
[00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:20.680]   It was a lethal disease.
[00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:22.320]   Nobody could cure it.
[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:24.640]   Nothing could affect it in any way at all.
[00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:25.640]   It always killed.
[00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:31.120]   Do you know they've got drugs now that can cure tubercular meningitis?
[00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:34.080]   And they call them miracle drugs.
[00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:35.080]   They're highly expensive.
[00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:36.080]   Why?
[00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:39.440]   Well, you see, they can cure these lethal diseases.
[00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:46.240]   You arrive at an assessment of the value of the drug by considering the lethal character
[00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:48.640]   of the disease which it cures.
[00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:53.200]   Now, that's the very principle that this man is employing here.
[00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:58.320]   How shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation?
[00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:00.480]   And you notice how he brings it home to them?
[00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:02.960]   Listen to the argument of verse 2.
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:08.320]   If the words spoken by angels were steadfast, what's he talking about?
[00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:16.420]   Well, he's talking about the law that God gave to Moses through the mediation of angels.
[00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:18.160]   This is the Mosaic law.
[00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:27.160]   If the words spoken by angels were steadfast and every transgression and disobedience received
[00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:31.360]   a just recompense of reward, how much more?
[00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:33.520]   What he's saying is this.
[00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:39.880]   The law of God has outlined the calamity and has defined it for us.
[00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:45.780]   It talks about its transgressions and its disobedience and the punishment that God has
[00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:53.320]   already announced he's going to put upon such sins and transgressions and acts of disobedience.
[00:26:53.320 --> 00:27:00.400]   The soul that sinneth it shall die in the day wherein the weakest thereof and so on.
[00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:03.280]   The wages of sin is death.
[00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:06.820]   The law has pronounced this.
[00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:11.160]   And this is the great message, of course, of the whole of the Old Testament which these
[00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:14.840]   people knew in a superficial sense.
[00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:19.520]   The law was the schoolmaster to bring us to Christ.
[00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:25.640]   The law was added because of transgressions that the exceeding sinfulness of sin might
[00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:29.120]   be brought to light and be made manifest.
[00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:35.040]   Now the law has described all this and has shown it, but he says the gospel shows it
[00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:37.100]   yet more.
[00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:42.020]   But taking it even at the level of the law, this is the message that is needed, you see,
[00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:44.200]   by the modern world.
[00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:49.200]   Why is the world in general not interested in the gospel of Christ this evening?
[00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:53.240]   There's only one answer to that question.
[00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:58.560]   They've never seen their plight and predicament as they are without it.
[00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:02.820]   They think as long as they've got an affluent society and as long as they've got plenty
[00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:07.800]   of money and can enjoy themselves that all is well, they never stop to think of death
[00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:10.440]   and the judgment beyond it.
[00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:14.720]   And so they're uninterested and they see no need for it.
[00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:21.400]   They never see the calamity, the awfulness, the last judgment, and an eternity of misery
[00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:26.280]   and wretchedness outside the life of God.
[00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:31.800]   But that is the destiny of men and women who die in their sins and without believing on
[00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:33.160]   the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:35.760]   The law has already established this.
[00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:38.340]   Our Lord has repeated this.
[00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:44.320]   He said that he had come to seek and to save that which is lost.
[00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:46.680]   He and he alone can do it.
[00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:50.120]   Nothing else can save, and that is this man's whole argument.
[00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:55.560]   The law itself seemed to be enough, but now Christ has come, the only way of salvation.
[00:28:55.560 --> 00:29:03.720]   If you neglect this, all the terror, the awfulness of the calamity and the fate that awaits you.
[00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:07.460]   Well, there is a second reason, isn't it?
[00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:15.740]   For regarding this as so great a salvation, it not only saves you from hurricanes and
[00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:21.060]   tornadoes and from floods and earthquakes and illnesses.
[00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:30.820]   Here is something that can save you from everlasting and eternal misery and wretchedness and deadness
[00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:33.220]   outside the life of God.
[00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:41.100]   The most awful calamity and fate conceivable, it can save you even from that.
[00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:44.740]   That is his second argument for calling it so great.
[00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:48.020]   But now that is negative.
[00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:51.840]   And he is concerned to put it positively as well.
[00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:54.820]   So let me put that to you positively.
[00:29:54.820 --> 00:30:00.660]   This is a great salvation not only because of the greatness of what it saves us from.
[00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:07.940]   It seems to be still greater when you notice what it saves you to, what it saves you for.
[00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:12.440]   Not only what it rescues you from, but that to which it brings you and that to which it
[00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:13.440]   gives you.
[00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:18.420]   And indeed, as you noticed in the reading at the beginning, that is the subject matter
[00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:22.340]   of the remainder of this chapter.
[00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:23.860]   What does this gospel give us?
[00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:28.060]   A man may say, "Why should I believe that gospel?"
[00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:30.620]   Well listen to this man's answer.
[00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:33.220]   This is the first thing that it gives you.
[00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:37.500]   It gives you pardon and forgiveness of sins.
[00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:39.780]   Did you notice that last verse part one?
[00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:45.700]   "Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might
[00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:52.060]   be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation
[00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:54.300]   for the sins of the people."
[00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:55.300]   Reconciliation.
[00:30:55.300 --> 00:31:04.620]   There is nothing in the whole world tonight that is as valuable as this, to be reconciled
[00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:05.620]   to God.
[00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:12.180]   To know that my sins are forgiven, the money of the universe can't purchase it.
[00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:14.860]   There is nothing more valuable than this.
[00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:19.900]   I am tempted to tell you a story of a man who once came to see me in London.
[00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:23.540]   I had never met the man, but he asked if he could come and see me.
[00:31:23.540 --> 00:31:28.100]   I noticed the address on his note paper that he was obviously a man prominent in the great
[00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:34.060]   city of London in the financial world, and eventually he came to see me.
[00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:39.180]   I couldn't make out why he'd come, but he told me he'd actually been advised to come
[00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:42.180]   by a physician.
[00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:45.980]   And the man had been attending on this great physician who happened to be one of the royal
[00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:50.260]   physicians, and this great physician could do nothing for him.
[00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:51.260]   What was the matter with the man?
[00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:58.060]   Well, he'd been suffering from insomnia, suffering from odd pains in different parts
[00:31:58.060 --> 00:31:59.060]   of his body.
[00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:03.820]   He'd been to his local doctor, he'd gone to the consultants, and none of them could
[00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:04.820]   do anything for him.
[00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:11.720]   He'd actually taken a world cruise twice over, but he was none the better, if anything worse.
[00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:15.700]   And on and on he was going, and getting into a bad state, couldn't do his work properly,
[00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:16.980]   and so on.
[00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:19.340]   What was the matter with the man?
[00:32:19.340 --> 00:32:22.220]   Well he told me what it was.
[00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:23.220]   This was his trouble.
[00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:30.020]   Twenty years before, in order to make a lot of money quickly, he had done something that
[00:32:30.020 --> 00:32:32.580]   was wrong and dishonest.
[00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:34.540]   It hadn't worried him at the time at all.
[00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:39.780]   He thought he was rather clever, and he had made a lot of money, and he'd gone on enjoying
[00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:42.060]   it, and all was well.
[00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:47.300]   Until five years ago, fifteen years after he'd done this thing, suddenly this thing
[00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:48.680]   came back to him.
[00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:49.700]   He didn't know why.
[00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:51.940]   He suddenly began to think about it.
[00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:53.100]   Something had resurrected it.
[00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:56.500]   There it was, and he couldn't get rid of it.
[00:32:56.500 --> 00:33:02.660]   And so he began to develop these physical symptoms, these functional conditions of the
[00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:05.060]   body, and nobody could help him.
[00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:06.060]   World cruises couldn't help.
[00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:07.060]   He'd got the money.
[00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:10.620]   If it was a question of paying for physicians or world tours, he'd got it.
[00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:11.620]   He could do anything.
[00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:13.820]   All the money that was necessary.
[00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:16.680]   But he couldn't find peace.
[00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:19.940]   Peace of conscience, peace of mind, peace of heart.
[00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:24.140]   He couldn't put his head on the pillow at night and go to sleep, the sleep of the innocent.
[00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:29.920]   This was his trouble, annoying, condemning conscience.
[00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:36.220]   And all the money of the world and all the libraries of the universe couldn't help him.
[00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:41.500]   But thank God a little preacher could help him, because he could tell him of a way whereby
[00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:46.860]   he could know for certain that his sins were forgiven.
[00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:52.340]   He could tell him about one, the Son of God, who'd come down from heaven to earth to deal
[00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:54.400]   with his very problem.
[00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:59.100]   And if he but believed in him as Paul and Silas said to the Philippian jailer, "Believe
[00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:05.340]   in the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved," he could know that his sins were forgiven,
[00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:07.820]   blot it out.
[00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:13.580]   And he could put his head on the pillow and go to sleep like a newborn babe.
[00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:16.220]   Reconciliation?
[00:34:16.220 --> 00:34:19.860]   It's more precious than the whole universe.
[00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:22.500]   Some of you millionaires even commit suicide.
[00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:23.940]   You can't buy happiness.
[00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:27.100]   You can't buy peace of conscience and of mind and of heart.
[00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:30.980]   You can't face death triumphantly.
[00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:37.060]   There is only one way whereby that can happen, and it is through this so great salvation.
[00:34:37.060 --> 00:34:41.020]   That's the first thing that it does, but that is only the first.
[00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:47.420]   Having reconciled us to God and having given us pardon and forgiveness of our sins, it
[00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:53.100]   then goes on, you know, to do something which is almost incredible.
[00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:57.420]   It actually makes us children of God.
[00:34:57.420 --> 00:35:02.060]   We are not merely introduced to God and enabled to speak to him.
[00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:04.980]   God adopts us into his family.
[00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:05.980]   Did you notice that?
[00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:09.500]   Have you noticed the greatness of the statements in this chapter?
[00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:10.500]   Listen.
[00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:16.300]   "For it became him," he says in verse 10, "for whom are all things and by whom are all
[00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:23.500]   things in bringing many sons unto glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect
[00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:24.500]   through sufferings."
[00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:25.500]   Now listen to this.
[00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:33.420]   "For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one, for the which
[00:35:33.420 --> 00:35:40.980]   cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren, saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren.
[00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:44.860]   In the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee, and again I will put my trust in
[00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:49.700]   him, and again behold I and the children which God hath given me."
[00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:52.260]   But the amazing statement is in verse 11.
[00:35:52.260 --> 00:36:01.500]   "Both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one."
[00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:02.500]   What's it mean?
[00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:05.380]   "He that sanctifieth," the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:08.140]   Who are they that are sanctified?
[00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:10.020]   You and I who believe in him.
[00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:11.460]   This is what we are told.
[00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:15.780]   He that sanctifies and they that are sanctified are all of one.
[00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:17.100]   One what?
[00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:19.220]   One nature.
[00:36:19.220 --> 00:36:21.120]   One nature.
[00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:22.600]   We are born again.
[00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:24.860]   We are born of the Spirit.
[00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:28.420]   We are partakers of the divine nature.
[00:36:28.420 --> 00:36:32.100]   Christ is not ashamed to call us brethren.
[00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:38.100]   My dear friends, that's why this man calls this so great a salvation.
[00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:43.340]   You're not only pardoned and forgiven, you're adopted into the royal family of heaven.
[00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:45.340]   You become a child of God.
[00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:50.140]   You belong to the heavenly family.
[00:36:50.140 --> 00:36:57.060]   There are people in London who pay large sums of money in order to get an entree into some
[00:36:57.060 --> 00:36:59.220]   exclusive club.
[00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:04.260]   They want to mix with great people and they want to join these clubs.
[00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:08.620]   And there was a time when the thing to do was to be presented to the Queen.
[00:37:08.620 --> 00:37:13.660]   And it used to cost thousands of pounds to be presented to the Queen.
[00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:17.900]   And they'd pay the money in order just that they might have the privilege of shaking hands
[00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:20.540]   with the Queen of England.
[00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:25.220]   But after they'd paid the thousands and after they'd shaken hands with Her Majesty, they
[00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:27.100]   were still the same people.
[00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:28.620]   They were still commoners.
[00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:30.860]   They were not taken into the royal family.
[00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:32.540]   They were not adopted.
[00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:38.060]   But here you see, this is what the gospel offers you, and for nothing, that you will
[00:37:38.060 --> 00:37:42.020]   become a child of God.
[00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:51.900]   You become with the Lord Jesus Christ, one of whom is not ashamed to be called your brother.
[00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:58.780]   Oh, the greatness of this salvation, the dignity of the position into which it puts us.
[00:37:58.780 --> 00:38:01.980]   But on he goes, not only that.
[00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:06.060]   While you're still left in this world, you're a child of God, but you've still got to fight
[00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:08.900]   the world and the flesh and the devil.
[00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:13.700]   And temptations are powerful and hot and strong, and how can you deal with them?
[00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:16.060]   The great salvation still answers.
[00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:22.940]   For in that he himself has suffered being tempted, he is able to succor them that are
[00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:23.940]   tempted.
[00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:29.620]   He's not only dealt with the problem of the guilt of sin, he deals with the problem of
[00:38:29.620 --> 00:38:33.620]   the power of sin.
[00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:39.220]   And so, believing in him in the heat of temptation, you can turn to him and say, "I need thee
[00:38:39.220 --> 00:38:40.380]   every hour.
[00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:41.940]   Stay thou nearby."
[00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:47.220]   Temptations lose their power when thou art nigh.
[00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:49.620]   He deals not only with the guilt, but with the power.
[00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:54.500]   "Cleanse me from its guilt and power," says the hymn writer.
[00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:56.200]   And he's right, and he does it.
[00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:58.900]   This is a part of the great salvation.
[00:38:58.900 --> 00:38:59.900]   He will be with you.
[00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:00.900]   He will lead you.
[00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:01.900]   He will guide you.
[00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:04.580]   He has said, "I will never leave thee nor forsake thee."
[00:39:04.580 --> 00:39:09.340]   He'll go through with you, through all the trials and the troubles and the calamities,
[00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:13.340]   right away through your earthly course.
[00:39:13.340 --> 00:39:17.940]   These are some of the things that this so great salvation gives us.
[00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:20.380]   But he doesn't even stop at that.
[00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:25.700]   In many ways, the greatest thing of all is the thing that he describes in verses 5 to
[00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:26.700]   8.
[00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:27.700]   Listen.
[00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:34.460]   "For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come whereof we speak."
[00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:37.220]   And then he goes on to quote the eighth psalm.
[00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:41.740]   Now this is an unfortunate translation here in the King James Version.
[00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:46.820]   He says, "For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come of which
[00:39:46.820 --> 00:39:49.220]   we speak."
[00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:50.660]   What he means is this.
[00:39:50.660 --> 00:39:52.340]   He says, "Listen.
[00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:58.540]   The world to come of which I have spoken to you, and of which you've heard in the preaching,
[00:39:58.540 --> 00:40:03.700]   is not being prepared and reserved for angels, but for us."
[00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:08.860]   You see, in the last verse of the first chapter, in dealing with the angels, he has said, "What
[00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:09.860]   are angels?
[00:40:09.860 --> 00:40:17.300]   Are they not all ministering spirits sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs
[00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:18.300]   of salvation?"
[00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:20.700]   That's what he's talking about.
[00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:27.580]   And the salvation ultimately is this world to come of which he's speaking.
[00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:28.580]   What's it mean?
[00:40:28.580 --> 00:40:34.420]   This to me today is the most glorious aspect of all of our great and glorious Christian
[00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:35.420]   faith.
[00:40:35.420 --> 00:40:37.820]   We are living in such an uncertain world.
[00:40:37.820 --> 00:40:40.220]   We are here today, we may be gone tomorrow.
[00:40:40.220 --> 00:40:47.380]   Not only hurricanes, not only tornadoes, but the bombs and the other horrible possibilities.
[00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:49.020]   How long has the world gone to last?
[00:40:49.020 --> 00:40:50.020]   Nobody knows.
[00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:52.220]   But it's an insecure, it's an uncertain world.
[00:40:52.220 --> 00:40:56.460]   You can't base anything of a surety on anything.
[00:40:56.460 --> 00:40:57.460]   Everything is shaking.
[00:40:57.460 --> 00:41:00.540]   The whole world is uncertain.
[00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:07.500]   And to me, this is the most wonderful thing of all, that as a child of God, I already
[00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:11.500]   belong to this world to come.
[00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:14.300]   Our citizenship is in heaven.
[00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:18.860]   We are only strangers and pilgrims here, as this man puts it later on.
[00:41:18.860 --> 00:41:25.180]   Here we know continuing city, but we seek one to come.
[00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:29.420]   We are like Abram, and what he tells us in chapter 11 about Abram is this.
[00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:36.820]   He was looking for a city which has foundations, whose builder and maker, architect and artificer
[00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:38.780]   is God himself.
[00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:44.700]   A city with foundations, not a city that can be suddenly demolished by a hurricane or by
[00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:52.380]   bombs or anything, but the city of God that is eternal, the eternal city, the world to
[00:41:52.380 --> 00:41:55.020]   come of which we speak.
[00:41:55.020 --> 00:41:57.260]   It's not being prepared for angels.
[00:41:57.260 --> 00:41:59.420]   It's being prepared for us.
[00:41:59.420 --> 00:42:06.500]   Or as Peter, or as Paul puts it in Romans 8, "If children, then heirs, heirs of God
[00:42:06.500 --> 00:42:10.460]   and joint heirs with Christ."
[00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:15.740]   And again he says in 1 Corinthians 6, "Know ye not that he shall judge the world?
[00:42:15.740 --> 00:42:18.620]   Know ye not that he shall judge angels?"
[00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:23.580]   This glorious world which is to come, it's for us.
[00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:30.940]   And we are given this and made heirs of this all for nothing by this so great and glorious
[00:42:30.940 --> 00:42:31.940]   salvation.
[00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:35.900]   It is the free gift of God's grace to us.
[00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:37.940]   That is what it saves you to.
[00:42:37.940 --> 00:42:39.780]   It saves you from hell.
[00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:47.700]   It saves you for this everlasting and eternal glory which we shall enjoy with Father, Son
[00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:54.260]   and Holy Spirit and all the spirits of just men made perfect and angels and archangels
[00:42:54.260 --> 00:42:59.580]   and cherubims and all the heavenly hosts forever and forever.
[00:42:59.580 --> 00:43:02.900]   That's why it's so great a salvation.
[00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:07.460]   The greatest thing in the universe.
[00:43:07.460 --> 00:43:13.300]   But you know, I haven't mentioned yet the greatest thing of all.
[00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:16.820]   I reserve this to the end.
[00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:22.700]   It is great in its authorship, great in what it saves us from, great in what it saves us
[00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:24.340]   to.
[00:43:24.340 --> 00:43:29.840]   But if you really want to know its greatness, you've got to understand the way in which
[00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:33.500]   it has ever been made possible for us.
[00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:37.020]   How it's ever come into being.
[00:43:37.020 --> 00:43:40.660]   And this is the thing that this man elaborates.
[00:43:40.660 --> 00:43:47.420]   The point of the whole epistle in a sense is just to do this, to show us the pre-eminence
[00:43:47.420 --> 00:43:49.580]   of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:43:49.580 --> 00:43:50.580]   And he does it here.
[00:43:50.580 --> 00:43:56.820]   Now, we are living in an age when people are very fond of drama.
[00:43:56.820 --> 00:43:59.220]   This is the great thing, isn't it?
[00:43:59.220 --> 00:44:04.700]   I'm told people in this country, as in my own country, no longer go to places of worship
[00:44:04.700 --> 00:44:10.380]   on Sunday night because they're home, at home, looking at the television.
[00:44:10.380 --> 00:44:14.860]   The drama, the play, wonderful.
[00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:16.740]   And they look at it.
[00:44:16.740 --> 00:44:19.540]   And they then talk to one another about it.
[00:44:19.540 --> 00:44:22.140]   And they go to their theaters and they do the same thing.
[00:44:22.140 --> 00:44:24.220]   And this is what you hear them say.
[00:44:24.220 --> 00:44:26.620]   You hear one describing it to the other.
[00:44:26.620 --> 00:44:29.780]   You know, they say, "It was most moving.
[00:44:29.780 --> 00:44:30.780]   There was a man there.
[00:44:30.780 --> 00:44:33.420]   He was a great man.
[00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:34.420]   Came of a great family.
[00:44:34.420 --> 00:44:36.980]   Got a great name, great wealth.
[00:44:36.980 --> 00:44:42.580]   You know, in order to help other people, he pretended that he was a nobody.
[00:44:42.580 --> 00:44:44.140]   He dressed badly.
[00:44:44.140 --> 00:44:46.180]   He missed with the ordinary people.
[00:44:46.180 --> 00:44:47.180]   He suffered indignities.
[00:44:47.180 --> 00:44:49.980]   Suffered even the need of food.
[00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:54.380]   He did all this in this great self-abasement and sacrifice.
[00:44:54.380 --> 00:44:56.540]   There's nothing he wouldn't do from them."
[00:44:56.540 --> 00:44:59.060]   And they get eloquent as they describe it.
[00:44:59.060 --> 00:45:00.900]   They say, "You know, I was weeping.
[00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:03.780]   I was moved to tears as I watched it.
[00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:08.700]   It was all so marvelous and so wonderful and so moving and so loving.
[00:45:08.700 --> 00:45:14.540]   There was only one thing wrong with the drama and the play, and that was it was too short.
[00:45:14.540 --> 00:45:16.260]   It had ended too soon.
[00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:19.660]   They wished it had gone on."
[00:45:19.660 --> 00:45:21.340]   Drama.
[00:45:21.340 --> 00:45:24.540]   Are you really interested in drama?
[00:45:24.540 --> 00:45:32.860]   Well, if you are, let me, in a few sentences, hold before you the greatest drama that the
[00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:36.020]   world ever has known or ever can know.
[00:45:36.020 --> 00:45:38.020]   It's all described here.
[00:45:38.020 --> 00:45:39.140]   Drama.
[00:45:39.140 --> 00:45:40.140]   What is it?
[00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:44.820]   Well, listen to this man as he puts it in the ninth verse.
[00:45:44.820 --> 00:45:47.780]   "We see Jesus."
[00:45:47.780 --> 00:45:50.700]   It's a drama about one called Jesus.
[00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:58.220]   "Who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory
[00:45:58.220 --> 00:46:03.700]   and honor, that he, by the grace of God, should taste death for every man?"
[00:46:03.700 --> 00:46:05.900]   But who is Jesus?
[00:46:05.900 --> 00:46:09.540]   Here's the great question.
[00:46:09.540 --> 00:46:12.020]   Who is Jesus?
[00:46:12.020 --> 00:46:14.860]   He's already described him in the third verse.
[00:46:14.860 --> 00:46:15.860]   The Lord.
[00:46:15.860 --> 00:46:20.900]   Jesus, the man, Jesus of Nazareth, the carpenter.
[00:46:20.900 --> 00:46:23.980]   Jesus, yes, but the Lord.
[00:46:23.980 --> 00:46:26.260]   He's already said it, hasn't he, in the first chapter.
[00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:28.100]   As I say, he couldn't contain himself.
[00:46:28.100 --> 00:46:29.980]   He's amazed at these Hebrew Christians.
[00:46:29.980 --> 00:46:31.540]   What, turning back?
[00:46:31.540 --> 00:46:33.660]   Going back to the old Jews' religion?
[00:46:33.660 --> 00:46:36.420]   You haven't understood who Jesus is.
[00:46:36.420 --> 00:46:37.420]   Listen.
[00:46:37.420 --> 00:46:42.700]   "God, who at sundry times and in diverse manners speak in time past unto the fathers by the
[00:46:42.700 --> 00:46:43.700]   prophets."
[00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:46.100]   He's not derogating from the greatness of the prophets.
[00:46:46.100 --> 00:46:47.100]   They were great men.
[00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:50.180]   All right, but put him by the side of this one.
[00:46:50.180 --> 00:46:51.180]   He's nobody.
[00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:54.460]   "Hath in these last days spoken unto us in his son?"
[00:46:54.460 --> 00:46:55.460]   Who is he?
[00:46:55.460 --> 00:47:00.460]   "The one whom he has appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds."
[00:47:00.460 --> 00:47:01.900]   Well, who is Jesus?
[00:47:01.900 --> 00:47:02.900]   Listen.
[00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:07.900]   "Who being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person and upholding
[00:47:07.900 --> 00:47:11.300]   all things by the word of his power."
[00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:12.780]   Jesus.
[00:47:12.780 --> 00:47:13.780]   This is who he is.
[00:47:13.780 --> 00:47:16.580]   This is what he was from all eternity.
[00:47:16.580 --> 00:47:19.180]   The express image of God's person.
[00:47:19.180 --> 00:47:22.860]   The effulgence of God's eternal glory.
[00:47:22.860 --> 00:47:25.460]   The express image of it all.
[00:47:25.460 --> 00:47:29.340]   "There is the one through whom all things are made.
[00:47:29.340 --> 00:47:32.860]   He sustains all things by the word of his power."
[00:47:32.860 --> 00:47:36.100]   Yes, he created everything, even angels.
[00:47:36.100 --> 00:47:41.940]   The rest of chapter 1 goes on to tell you how the angels have been made by him.
[00:47:41.940 --> 00:47:45.220]   He's the author of life.
[00:47:45.220 --> 00:47:47.260]   And yet, listen.
[00:47:47.260 --> 00:47:55.260]   We see Jesus, this glorious, blessed person by whom the angels and everything else were
[00:47:55.260 --> 00:47:56.300]   made.
[00:47:56.300 --> 00:48:03.740]   We see Jesus who was made a little lower than the angels.
[00:48:03.740 --> 00:48:06.940]   Here's the drama.
[00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:14.740]   Though he was equal with God, though he was in the form of God, he counted it not robbery
[00:48:14.740 --> 00:48:22.820]   to be equal with God, but humbled himself and made himself of no reputation.
[00:48:22.820 --> 00:48:30.380]   The Lord of glory is born as a helpless babe.
[00:48:30.380 --> 00:48:36.020]   He who gives the law is made of a woman made under the law.
[00:48:36.020 --> 00:48:37.980]   Here's the drama.
[00:48:37.980 --> 00:48:46.020]   The incarnation, the drama of dramas, the divesting himself of the insignia of his eternal
[00:48:46.020 --> 00:48:47.020]   glory.
[00:48:47.020 --> 00:48:50.260]   He couldn't divest himself of the glory, nor of the deity.
[00:48:50.260 --> 00:48:57.580]   All he divested himself of was the signs, the trappings, the external manifestations.
[00:48:57.580 --> 00:49:02.340]   But he did that in order to take unto him human nature.
[00:49:02.340 --> 00:49:05.100]   Now this man, he goes into detail over this.
[00:49:05.100 --> 00:49:07.980]   Listen to him putting it later on like this.
[00:49:07.980 --> 00:49:12.940]   He says, "For verily he took not unto him the nature of angels, but he took unto him
[00:49:12.940 --> 00:49:14.300]   the seed of Abraham."
[00:49:14.300 --> 00:49:18.900]   Translate it if you like by saying that he didn't stretch out a helping hand to angels,
[00:49:18.900 --> 00:49:20.220]   but to the seed of Abraham.
[00:49:20.220 --> 00:49:21.540]   But it comes to the same thing.
[00:49:21.540 --> 00:49:24.020]   He did take unto him human nature.
[00:49:24.020 --> 00:49:27.340]   He was truly man and still truly God.
[00:49:27.340 --> 00:49:33.380]   But he humbled himself in order to do this, made himself of no reputation, and not only
[00:49:33.380 --> 00:49:37.260]   became a man, but became also a servant.
[00:49:37.260 --> 00:49:38.980]   Here's the drama.
[00:49:38.980 --> 00:49:45.220]   And then as he goes on to tell us, "God, you know, not only cannot tempt anybody, he
[00:49:45.220 --> 00:49:47.300]   cannot be tempted.
[00:49:47.300 --> 00:49:54.060]   But here is one who himself hath suffered being tempted," as he puts it in chapter
[00:49:54.060 --> 00:49:58.700]   4, "tempted in all points like as we are.
[00:49:58.700 --> 00:50:06.300]   Sin apart, yet without sin, but try to conceive of this, that this blessed holy person, this
[00:50:06.300 --> 00:50:11.500]   holy thing that was born of Mary, this one who had looked eternally into the eyes of
[00:50:11.500 --> 00:50:20.740]   his father and to whom sin was utterly abhorrent, literally tempted in all points like as we
[00:50:20.740 --> 00:50:21.740]   are."
[00:50:21.740 --> 00:50:24.140]   He's humbled himself to this.
[00:50:24.140 --> 00:50:26.620]   But wait a minute, we haven't finished.
[00:50:26.620 --> 00:50:33.260]   We see Jesus who was made a little love and the angels, why did he do all this?
[00:50:33.260 --> 00:50:35.900]   What's the meaning of the incarnation?
[00:50:35.900 --> 00:50:38.700]   Did he come merely to teach us or to give us an example?
[00:50:38.700 --> 00:50:40.180]   No, no.
[00:50:40.180 --> 00:50:47.900]   Made a little love and the angels for the suffering of death, that he by the grace of
[00:50:47.900 --> 00:50:52.300]   God might taste death for every man.
[00:50:52.300 --> 00:50:53.980]   Drama.
[00:50:53.980 --> 00:51:00.540]   From the highest courts of heaven to the cross of deepest woe.
[00:51:00.540 --> 00:51:08.260]   The author of life being put to death.
[00:51:08.260 --> 00:51:11.340]   This is the drama of dramas.
[00:51:11.340 --> 00:51:15.180]   Nothing is worth talking about side by side with this.
[00:51:15.180 --> 00:51:22.700]   From the very height of glory, he not only came into the world but went to the death,
[00:51:22.700 --> 00:51:27.740]   in the death of the cross, and he died.
[00:51:27.740 --> 00:51:33.100]   And they took down his body and they buried it in a grave.
[00:51:33.100 --> 00:51:39.180]   The author of life, the sustainer of the universe, buried in a grave.
[00:51:39.180 --> 00:51:41.980]   But thank God it isn't the end.
[00:51:41.980 --> 00:51:42.980]   Here's the drama.
[00:51:42.980 --> 00:51:47.940]   It starts in heaven, it comes down to earth, it goes down to the grave, to Hades as it
[00:51:47.940 --> 00:51:48.940]   were.
[00:51:48.940 --> 00:51:57.180]   And then, listen, we see Jesus who was made a little love and the angels for the suffering
[00:51:57.180 --> 00:52:01.840]   of death, crowned with glory and honor.
[00:52:01.840 --> 00:52:04.100]   He burst us under the bands of death.
[00:52:04.100 --> 00:52:06.160]   He arose triumphant over the grave.
[00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:07.780]   He couldn't be held by death.
[00:52:07.780 --> 00:52:12.180]   He arose bringing life and immortality to life through his gospel.
[00:52:12.180 --> 00:52:16.420]   He ascended and he took his seat at the right hand of God.
[00:52:16.420 --> 00:52:20.940]   He said it all in the third verse of the first chapter, "Who being the brightness of his
[00:52:20.940 --> 00:52:25.740]   glory and the express image of his person and upholding all things by the word of his
[00:52:25.740 --> 00:52:33.080]   power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the majesty
[00:52:33.080 --> 00:52:34.080]   on high."
[00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:40.300]   And there he is this night, from heaven down to the depths, back again to the glory.
[00:52:40.300 --> 00:52:45.180]   And there he lives and reigns and history is in his hands.
[00:52:45.180 --> 00:52:50.680]   And he's but waiting until his enemy shall be made his footstool and he'll come again
[00:52:50.680 --> 00:53:00.700]   riding the clouds of heaven to judge the world, surrounded by all the holy angels, in all
[00:53:00.700 --> 00:53:07.100]   the penoply of his eternal glory, in all the majesty of his glorious deity.
[00:53:07.100 --> 00:53:12.260]   He will come and every eye shall see him.
[00:53:12.260 --> 00:53:21.060]   But those who believe with him will rise to be with him and will share in his glory and
[00:53:21.060 --> 00:53:30.820]   enjoy his presence and the indescribable blessings of the eternal kingdom forever and forever.
[00:53:30.820 --> 00:53:41.260]   My dear friends, all that he did, that you and I might be saved from the calamity of
[00:53:41.260 --> 00:53:49.500]   hell, that we might be reconciled to God, that we might become the children of God,
[00:53:49.500 --> 00:54:02.220]   that we might share the glory with God throughout the countless ages of eternity.
[00:54:02.220 --> 00:54:04.060]   Great salvation!
[00:54:04.060 --> 00:54:07.100]   Is there anything else worth talking about?
[00:54:07.100 --> 00:54:10.220]   Do you apologize for being a Christian?
[00:54:10.220 --> 00:54:13.340]   Do you attend the house of God grudgingly?
[00:54:13.340 --> 00:54:16.860]   Are you giving people the impression that you've got something small and narrow?
[00:54:16.860 --> 00:54:18.220]   Shame on you!
[00:54:18.220 --> 00:54:28.820]   If it is so, it is simply because you've never seen the greatness of this so great salvation.
[00:54:28.820 --> 00:54:36.620]   My dear friends, don't we all need that eye itself about which the Lord himself spoke
[00:54:36.620 --> 00:54:39.420]   to the church at Laodicea?
[00:54:39.420 --> 00:54:41.340]   You can get it for nothing.
[00:54:41.340 --> 00:54:42.780]   Pray for it.
[00:54:42.780 --> 00:54:50.220]   Pray that the Holy Spirit may enlighten the eyes of your understanding, that you may see
[00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:59.380]   this so great salvation, and especially the Savior himself, the Lord of glory, who came
[00:54:59.380 --> 00:55:04.980]   down and endured such shame, that you and I might live.
[00:55:04.980 --> 00:55:12.340]   The Son of God, as John Calvin put it, became the Son of men, that the sinful sons of men
[00:55:12.340 --> 00:55:16.780]   might be made the sons of God.
[00:55:16.780 --> 00:55:19.620]   So great salvation!
[00:55:19.620 --> 00:55:23.700]   What can we say as we look at it?
[00:55:23.700 --> 00:55:26.660]   There's only one thing to say.
[00:55:26.660 --> 00:55:33.540]   Crown him with many crowns, the Lamb upon his throne.
[00:55:33.540 --> 00:55:40.420]   Hark, how the heavenly anthem drowns all music but its own.
[00:55:40.420 --> 00:55:42.820]   And then do you want to say this?
[00:55:42.820 --> 00:55:56.220]   Awake, my soul, and sing of him who died for thee, and crown him as thy matchless or glorious
[00:55:56.220 --> 00:56:01.460]   king throughout eternity.
[00:56:01.460 --> 00:56:05.780]   Have you seen the greatness, the glory of it all?
[00:56:05.780 --> 00:56:16.100]   Give yourself no rest nor peace until you find yourselves lost in wonder, love, and
[00:56:16.100 --> 00:56:29.220]   praise at so great a salvation, and especially as you look at him and fall at his feet and
[00:56:29.220 --> 00:56:36.860]   look forward to the day when you'll cast your crown before him.
[00:56:36.860 --> 00:56:37.860]   Let us pray.
[00:56:37.860 --> 00:56:48.020]   O Lord, our God, we again beseech thee to have mercy upon us for our smallness, for
[00:56:48.020 --> 00:56:50.820]   our ignorance, for our folly.
[00:56:50.820 --> 00:57:00.500]   O God, but above all for the harm we do to the gospel with our small notions and ideas,
[00:57:00.500 --> 00:57:09.140]   and our tettiness and our concern with small immaterial things.
[00:57:09.140 --> 00:57:12.820]   Open our eyes, we humbly pray thee.
[00:57:12.820 --> 00:57:21.820]   Give us a glimpse of him, the Lord of glory, who so loved us that he gave himself for us.
[00:57:21.820 --> 00:57:30.540]   Open our eyes, O Lord, our God, that we may ever live to the praise of the glory of thy
[00:57:30.540 --> 00:57:32.980]   grace.
[00:57:32.980 --> 00:57:37.060]   We ask it in his most holy name.
[00:57:37.060 --> 00:57:38.820]   Amen.
[00:57:38.820 --> 00:57:42.740]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
