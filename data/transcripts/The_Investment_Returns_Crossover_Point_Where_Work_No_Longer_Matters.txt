[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.440]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai.
[00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:07.700]   And in this episode, we're going to talk about investment returns versus active income.
[00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:13.080]   And what happens when investment returns beat your active income every year.
[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.280]   So I don't know about you folks, but I'm pretty tired.
[00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:21.960]   And I know a lot of people who are growing more and more apathetic to work, because they're
[00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.320]   tired, but also because their investment returns have been so good.
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.600]   We've been in a bull market technically since 2009.
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:37.040]   So that's about 12 years of generally upward momentum, except for what 2018, maybe one
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.520]   more year, not so good.
[00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.020]   But in general, we've been making money every single year.
[00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.360]   And you might find that one day, your investment returns are greater than your annual active
[00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.400]   income.
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.960]   And you're going to feel giddy and excited.
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.520]   But you're probably not going to quit your job just yet, just in case it was a fluke.
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.680]   However, after several years of investment returns surpassing your active income, you'll
[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.640]   develop a lot more courage to do something new.
[00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.780]   You might finally ask for that well-deserved sabbatical without fear of your year-end bonus
[00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.220]   getting slashed.
[00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:15.120]   You won't fear as much not getting that promotion because you got the investment returns.
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.400]   So who cares if the company screws you?
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.880]   Well, of course you will care because you obviously want to get what you deserve.
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.160]   But once those investment returns surpass your active income, it becomes harder and
[00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.600]   harder to care as much about your career.
[00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.320]   And it becomes harder and harder to get as motivated.
[00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.040]   So that's where I find myself, folks, as I transition back to retirement by 2022, when
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.760]   there's hopefully herd immunity, although who knows, I've been trying to justify my
[00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:48.640]   decision to no longer work so much, you know, no longer write as much do business development
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.520]   deals, all that stuff that I promised I would do once the lockdowns began because, hey,
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.640]   you're stuck at home, I'm stuck at home, why not try to make some money?
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.600]   As a father of two young children, not working feels like a sin.
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.600]   It really does.
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.840]   It is very hard not to feel responsible for your family.
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.760]   You know, if you're a parent, work is part of what you need to do.
[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.940]   You need to make money, you need to stay healthy so you can live a long enough time before
[00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.160]   your kids become adults, and so forth.
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:25.040]   However, my investment returns have been greater than my active income returns for the majority
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.240]   of years since 2012.
[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.520]   Now that's relatively easy to do when you don't have a day job.
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.400]   But of course, I've got financial samurai revenue coming in, and the site has grown
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.880]   over time.
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:42.240]   But I will say that since 2012, the majority of the years, my investment returns have been
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.920]   greater than my last year of working in finance.
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.000]   As a result, I've really begun to question whether it's worth spending any time to make
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.760]   any active income.
[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:58.600]   I've spoken to friends who make from $50,000 to 10 plus million dollars a year, and a lot
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:04.080]   of them are becoming more and more apathetic to work, partly because their investment returns
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.280]   are grading a greater and greater amount.
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.860]   And so they're also thinking to themselves, why bother working so hard?
[00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.860]   In addition, the active income I do make doesn't do much to stem any losses.
[00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.040]   For example, let's say I lose 10% on a $5 million portfolio.
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.200]   That's a $500,000 loss.
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.200]   Ouch.
[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.200]   Yikes.
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.840]   Even if I worked really, really hard, however, for the next several months to make, let's
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:34.240]   say $50,000 online, I'd still be down $450,000.
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:41.600]   Losing $450,000, at least on paper, feels the exact same as losing $500,000.
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.520]   It's a terrible feeling.
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:50.040]   I would say the breakpoint would be maybe around, I think losing $200,000 would feel
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.680]   better than losing $500,000.
[00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.540]   But anything after $200,000, it just feels bad.
[00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:57.540]   It's about the same.
[00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:03.000]   Therefore, if I spend any time trying to make money, that precious time to make the extra
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.720]   $50,000 online, I think it would make the situation worse because I would still feel
[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:14.200]   bad about losing $450,000, and yet I would also have spent precious time trying to make
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.960]   that $50,000, which I could have used to do something more enjoyable with my life or spend
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:20.340]   time with my family.
[00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:25.600]   And then on the flip side, let's say I return 20% on a $5 million portfolio in one year.
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.800]   It's feasible because in 2020, that's almost what happened.
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:35.260]   And in 2021, the markets are up about 20% and it's only September 1st about.
[00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.880]   So that's a $1 million gain, which is amazing.
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.760]   Now even if I take on some consulting projects to make, let's say $100,000 over the next
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:50.520]   several months, a $1.1 million gain doesn't do anything to change our happiness or our
[00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.600]   lifestyle one bit.
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:57.080]   And the reason is we comfortably live on much less each year.
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.420]   I don't know what to do with that extra money if I ever had that.
[00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:04.800]   Maybe I'd buy a fancy car, maybe a Lamborghini.
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:05.800]   Probably not.
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.280]   I live in San Francisco and the hills are hilly.
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.040]   Would I go on an awesome luxury cruise?
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.840]   I would if there wasn't any COVID, but I'm not going to get on a cruise with my family
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.660]   during the time of COVID.
[00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:22.000]   So I'd probably just reinvest it and it would make no difference to the quality of our lives
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   and our happiness.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:29.460]   Therefore, there has to be some sort of crossover point where spending any amount of time making
[00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.860]   active income becomes a waste of time.
[00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:36.860]   So the only way you would spend time making active income is if you truly love your work.
[00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:41.900]   So I truly love writing and now podcasting on Financial Samurai.
[00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:47.300]   If I didn't, then you wouldn't see me writing random posts about things that would make
[00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:48.300]   me no money.
[00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:52.220]   You know, the post on if you want to naturally be nicer, get richer.
[00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.100]   That's not going to make me any money.
[00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:59.220]   Posts that are going to make me money are sponsored posts or if I do a review on some
[00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:03.200]   new product, which you see a lot of other personal finance blogs do, is because that
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:04.900]   focuses on making money.
[00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:10.860]   My focus is on writing and connecting and discussing important real life topics that
[00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:12.300]   we all experience.
[00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:16.540]   And that's one of the reasons why I want to write my book with Penguin Random House because
[00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:22.280]   I'm going to cover some of the big life scenarios that we all will face or most of us will face
[00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:23.400]   at some point.
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:28.420]   And I want to decide between help you decide between this choice or that choice.
[00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:32.020]   So let's talk about the investment returns crossover point.
[00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:37.380]   I believe there are two conditions an investor must achieve before they can drop active income
[00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:39.060]   due to investment returns.
[00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:46.160]   And I want to point out that we are talking about investment returns, not investment income.
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:50.900]   Investment income is passive income that I've been trying to build to live off.
[00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:55.460]   But thinking about investment returns is a different way of thinking about trying to
[00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.940]   retire with the money you have.
[00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:03.500]   So investment returns is about what your portfolio will return every single year to pay for your
[00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:04.980]   desired living expenses.
[00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:09.180]   So the condition number one is at least three years of outperformance.
[00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:13.740]   If your investment returns are greater than your active income for at least three years
[00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:19.140]   in a row, or four years out of the last five years, I think you have the green light to
[00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:24.700]   take things down a notch, retire early, change careers, work at a job that doesn't pay well
[00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:26.020]   because you love it.
[00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:32.300]   Now, three years helps minimize the chances that your investment returns are not a fluke.
[00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:35.980]   We just don't want to confuse our brains with a bull market.
[00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:36.980]   We're in a bull market.
[00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:41.980]   So of course, it's easier to make money in our stocks and bonds and real estate investments
[00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:43.120]   and so forth.
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:48.580]   And given bear markets, which are defined as a 20% plus sell off, happen every about
[00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:54.780]   four years, I use the benchmark of four years out of five years to account for a couple
[00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:57.020]   of potentially bad years.
[00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:03.540]   The second condition is investments equal to at least 10 times your annual active income.
[00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:07.400]   So in order for your investment returns to generate more than your active income for
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:13.380]   three years or longer, you likely need a sizable investment portfolio that is 10 times or greater
[00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:15.700]   than your annual active income.
[00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:19.980]   And it's really fun how to analyze this because you just run the numbers and you can realize
[00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:23.500]   that 10x really is kind of the key benchmark.
[00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:28.740]   Let's say you make $100,000 a year, you would likely need at least a $1 million portfolio
[00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:32.740]   for a chance to generate $101,000 a year.
[00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:37.220]   So that's where your investment returns beat your annual active income.
[00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:43.180]   To generate $101,000 in investment returns on a $1 million portfolio would require a
[00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:45.880]   10.1% return.
[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:53.100]   And that is bang in line with the historical S&P 500 average of about 10.2% since about
[00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:54.660]   1926.
[00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:58.860]   So if your entire portfolio is in the S&P 500 and the S&P 500 returns its historical
[00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:01.420]   average, you've made it.
[00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:06.140]   However, the caveat is investment returns could be much lower in the future.
[00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:11.300]   So Vanguard in August 2021 came out with their 10-year return assumptions for stocks and
[00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:14.380]   bonds and it's very low.
[00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:20.020]   Vanguard is assuming a 4.02% return in stocks and even less in bonds.
[00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:26.460]   So if Vanguard's return assumptions come true, you're probably going to need at least 20x
[00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:29.980]   your annual income until you no longer have to work.
[00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:34.900]   And there is this debate between what metric to use as a multiple.
[00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:36.940]   A lot of people use expenses.
[00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:38.540]   I think that's fine.
[00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:43.340]   But I like to use annual income as a multiple for net worth targets because it's harder
[00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:46.620]   and it allows you to focus more.
[00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:51.860]   When you use your annual expenses as a multiple, it's easy to just cut costs and cheat so you
[00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:54.620]   don't have to save and invest so much.
[00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:57.380]   But if you use the income, you just can't cheat.
[00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:59.360]   You just have to go with the flow.
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:04.300]   And since most people make more money over time, using the income will keep you disciplined
[00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:05.860]   as you make more money.
[00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:10.820]   So the next obvious question is how long will it take investment returns to surpass active
[00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:11.820]   income?
[00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:16.580]   Now, the length of time will depend on your saving rate and your rate of return.
[00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:20.540]   Obviously, the higher your saving rate and higher your rate of return, the greater your
[00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:22.580]   chance of succeeding.
[00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:26.780]   Given I believe your capital needs to reach about 10x your annual gross income in order
[00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:32.220]   for your investment returns to regularly have a chance to surpass your active income, let's
[00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:34.060]   use two examples.
[00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:36.860]   The first example is using a 20% saving rate.
[00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:42.540]   If you start with nothing and save 20% of your annual gross income each year, in 18
[00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:48.180]   years, one eight, at a 10% compound annual return, you will have accumulated 10x your
[00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:49.180]   annual income.
[00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:54.220]   In the 19th year, if you continue to get a 10% return, your investment return will have
[00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:57.100]   surpassed your static annual income.
[00:10:57.100 --> 00:11:03.180]   Now, if your rate of return is only 5%, then you will accumulate 10x your annual income
[00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:05.340]   in 25 years.
[00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:10.060]   If a 5% rate of return continues, then you're really going to have to work about 36 years
[00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:14.340]   to finally see your investment returns surpass your annual income.
[00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:19.420]   The second example, if you use a 50% savings rate, which I think is the ideal savings rate
[00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:23.620]   everyone should shoot for, eventually, I think you're going to have to try to get there if
[00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:27.820]   you want to retire early or retire very, very comfortably.
[00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:35.820]   With a 50% annual gross income each year and 10% compound annual return, you'll reach 10x
[00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:39.820]   in about 11 years, and then on the 12th year, you'll succeed.
[00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:45.060]   Now, if the rate of return is only 5%, then you will accumulate 10x your annual income
[00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:49.140]   in 14 years, again, with a 50% savings rate.
[00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:54.060]   And if a 5% rate of return continues, then you will have to save and work for 22 years
[00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:58.420]   to finally see your investment returns surpass your annual income.
[00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:05.740]   Therefore, in conclusion, with a 20 to 50% saving rate and a 5% to 10% annual return
[00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:12.300]   assumption, it will likely take between 11 to 25 years until your investment returns
[00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:15.100]   steadily surpass your active income.
[00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:21.500]   Personally, it took me about 15 years to start regularly earning a greater return from my
[00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:22.500]   investments.
[00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:29.220]   So, the fun part about Financial Samurai is that I'm writing out this analysis using basic
[00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:32.540]   math and assumptions, but I'm also living it.
[00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:39.140]   I'm living it, folks, and I'm using my situation to double check whether the numbers are reasonable.
[00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:45.460]   And I do think it'll take 11 to 25 years for the average person if they save 20 to 50%
[00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:47.360]   of their annual gross income.
[00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:51.900]   And I do want to differentiate again between investment income and investment returns.
[00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:56.140]   In normal times, I think generating enough investment income to cover your desired living
[00:12:56.140 --> 00:13:01.900]   expenses may be harder than generating high enough investment returns to cover your living
[00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:02.900]   expenses.
[00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:04.660]   Let's just do the math again.
[00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:07.500]   Let's say we're in a raging bull market.
[00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:11.900]   You've got a $1 million portfolio and it's returning 25% a year.
[00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:15.860]   So that's $250,000 in investment returns.
[00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:25.580]   To get $250,000 in investment income at a 2% yield requires a $12.5 million portfolio.
[00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:29.680]   And obviously, if you withdraw at 4%, it requires half that amount.
[00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:32.960]   But still, that's a lot more money than $1 million.
[00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:39.860]   So the reality is investment income and investment returns are intricately tied together.
[00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:44.140]   And the logical thing many people do who no longer want to work is change their investment
[00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:50.560]   composition towards less risky, more stable, higher income producing investments once they've
[00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:53.300]   achieved their ideal number of retirement.
[00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:55.140]   And that's different for everyone.
[00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:58.540]   It all depends on your lifestyle desires.
[00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:05.420]   And let me conclude by saying there is a dangerous level of capital where if you get that amount,
[00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:06.800]   nothing matters.
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:13.100]   You might completely check out and lose all interest in any type of money making endeavor.
[00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:14.740]   And it could be a little dangerous.
[00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:16.580]   It could be a little dangerous.
[00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:21.860]   And that level, I believe, starts at when your net worth is equal to over 20 times your
[00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:26.380]   annual income or over 50 times your annual expenses.
[00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:31.940]   The apathy starts really creeping in and taking over.
[00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:37.020]   And then once your net worth gets to over 40 times your annual income or 100 times your
[00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:41.500]   annual expenses, I think that's when you start completely checking out.
[00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:46.940]   And I found myself thinking a lot just in my head like, "F this BS.
[00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:47.940]   Screw this.
[00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:51.980]   I'm not going to do this because I just don't care anymore."
[00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:52.980]   And so that's dangerous.
[00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:56.820]   So if you want to stay motivated, let's say you have children to take care of.
[00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:59.400]   Let's say you want to be very productive in society.
[00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:00.820]   You want to produce something.
[00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:03.720]   I'm in the middle of writing a book and I got to stay motivated.
[00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:07.480]   You might ironically have to keep inflating your lifestyle.
[00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:13.500]   So instead of the base model car, you might want to get the luxury supreme model car.
[00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:18.340]   Instead of flying economy class, maybe you'll live it up and fly first class.
[00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:19.980]   Maybe you're going to go private.
[00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:24.520]   Whatever the case may be, you can always spend more if you want to stay more motivated.
[00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:26.900]   Or you can just give more money away and help other people.
[00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:29.640]   And of course, you can do both.
[00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:33.640]   So there's a big interesting phenomenon going on right now.
[00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:39.300]   And that is the greater the investment returns, the more apathetic workers get, or at least
[00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:41.520]   investment workers get.
[00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:47.160]   So if the strong returns and risk assets continue, eventually productivity will decline.
[00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:51.720]   And in that case, the only people left to do the work will be non-investors and new
[00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:52.720]   graduates.
[00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:58.320]   So I'd love to hear your thoughts on how to use investment returns, if at all, as a
[00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:02.600]   gauge to how much you should work and how long you should work.
[00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:07.380]   I'm also curious to hear from you whether you are getting demotivated as well.
[00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:12.520]   And if you don't agree with my multiples, I'd love to hear what your multiples are and
[00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:13.520]   why.
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:15.520]   All right, that's it for this episode, folks.
[00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:16.920]   I hope you enjoyed it.
[00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:20.760]   And if you liked it, please leave a positive review and share it with all your friends.
