[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.040]   I should like to call your attention this afternoon to that incident in the life and
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:16.280]   the history of the early church, which is recorded in the twelfth chapter of the book
[00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:23.240]   of the Acts of the Apostles, which has been read to us. It is, of course, one complete
[00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:31.640]   incident in itself, but if you want one particular verse to concentrate on, I would select verse
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:41.120]   5. Peter, therefore, was kept in prison, but prayer was made without ceasing of the church
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:50.600]   and to God for him. What we have here, of course, is an account of the persecution,
[00:00:50.600 --> 00:01:01.280]   one of the early persecutions, suffered, endured by the infant Christian church. That in itself
[00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:08.200]   is something of very great significance and importance. There are people who, because
[00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:17.640]   of their ignorance, imagine that Christianity had been in favor with the vast majority of
[00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:25.360]   mankind until this present century. That, of course, is a complete fallacy. The church
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:33.560]   and her message were persecuted right from the very beginning. There is nothing new in
[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:43.040]   opposition to the church and to the Christian faith. Here, then, I say we have something
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:50.860]   that should give a real message to all of us who are concerned about the state of the
[00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:58.840]   church and her future at this present time. You see, here the church was fighting for
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:08.000]   her very life, and I believe that that is the case once more. In spite of certain notable
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:16.120]   exceptions, the cause of Christ, the cause of the church, is in great jeopardy at the
[00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:25.080]   present time, speaking generally of the whole world. There are forces and powers which hate
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:32.600]   our Lord and hate his cause and are doing their utmost to exterminate it and to put
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:39.520]   an end to it. And so the great question for us is to discover what have we got to do at
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:49.080]   a time like this? How is the church to comport and to conduct herself in such a situation?
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:56.920]   And what is true, of course, of the church is equally true of the individual Christian
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:03.040]   as a member of the church. It is not easy to be a Christian today. Any Christian will
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:09.980]   of necessity receive a good deal of persecution, doesn't matter what you are, what your work,
[00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:17.280]   what your profession may be. The true Christian is always persecuted. The Apostle Paul reminds
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:27.720]   Timothy, saying, "Yea, all that are godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution."
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:36.960]   So here I say we have an answer to our modern problem. How are we to face these forces that
[00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:45.440]   are set against us? What is the church to do to maintain a witness and to go on into
[00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:51.180]   the future? Well, I believe, as I am going to show you, that we are given the only true
[00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:58.800]   answer here. Unfortunately, there are many inside the church who, instead of looking
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:06.000]   at what we are told here, turn to their own ideas and devices and thoughts, and in my
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:13.720]   opinion waste a good deal of time and of energy. It's so foolish, because here we are told
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:19.000]   how the Christian church succeeded at the beginning. There she was, there were but a
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:28.040]   handful of people, nobody notable among them, just ordinary people with a great pagan world
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:35.520]   set against them and powerful forces arrayed against them. But they succeeded and they
[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:42.500]   triumphed and they prevailed and within some three centuries the despised sect became the
[00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:48.320]   official religion of the great Roman Empire. How did they do it? Surely the essence of
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:56.800]   wisdom for us is to turn back and to discover how these people who constituted the early
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:05.120]   church fought and triumphed and prevailed. And I think you'll find that at all similar
[00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:12.120]   periods in the long history of the church, she has always succeeded when she's gone back
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:19.360]   to this primitive apostolic pattern. But I say the tragedy is that many in the church
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:25.520]   are no longer doing this. They're aware of the danger, they're fearful of the future,
[00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:31.840]   so they resort to desperate means and methods to try to maintain the work and to attract
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:39.440]   the world. They turn to entertainment, more and more singing and entertainment, some of
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:48.680]   them even dancing, introducing drama, all kinds of experience designed to attract and
[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:57.360]   to win people. Well, according to this record, all that is quite wrong and doomed to certain
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:04.800]   failure. What are we to do? Well, let me put it like this to you. The first thing we have
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:13.800]   to do is to realize the character of these powers and forces that are set against us.
[00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:20.740]   That's always the first thing to do. It's always a wise thing to assess the character
[00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:28.760]   and the power of the opposition and of the enemy. A wise general or a marshal in an army
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:36.640]   always does that. Analyze the strength and the condition and the power of the enemy.
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:43.640]   And here the thing is quite plain. You notice that we are told that the trouble began in
[00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:50.000]   this way. Herod the king stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the church. Why did
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:57.720]   he do so? There was no reason at all. Nothing whatsoever should have led to this. The church
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:04.640]   consisted of harmless people, law-abiding citizens, people who were doing good. And
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:11.480]   yet this man stretched forth his hands and he killed James, the brother of John, with
[00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:17.720]   the sword. No reason whatsoever. You know, my friends, the opposition to the Christian
[00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:25.480]   faith is always irrational. Why do they make such fun of Christianity and the television
[00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:31.920]   and the wireless? Why is this considered to be clever? It's quite irrational. There
[00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:37.760]   is no reason for it, as there wasn't here at the beginning. And then we are told that
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:45.400]   because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to take Peter also. You see, subject
[00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:52.720]   to popular applause, these men who oppose Christianity, these great forces, they're
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:59.240]   powerful and they're popular and yet they're very sensitive to public applause. They want
[00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:05.480]   to please people. They want to be popular. This is always a characteristic of those who
[00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:12.240]   are opposed to the faith. And you notice this King Herod, he seems to epitomize in himself
[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:18.720]   all the characteristics of the powers and the forces that are opposed to the church
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:24.480]   today as it has been throughout the centuries. Did you notice what we were told towards the
[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:30.440]   end of the chapter? That Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon, and
[00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:36.400]   they came with one accord to him and desired peace because their country was nourished
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:43.040]   by the king's country. And then we read this, "And upon a set day Herod, arrayed in royal
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:51.560]   apparel, sat upon his throne and made an oration unto them." Now that's typical. We've seen
[00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:57.660]   that. Some of us are old enough to remember a man called Hitler, and he, in his opposition
[00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:03.760]   to the church, was always making these orations. But this is the world today that's opposed
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:10.680]   to the church. Great in pomp and circumstance, boasting of its authority, its learning, its
[00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:19.760]   power, and delivering its pompous orations, and causing people to tremble and to fear.
[00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:26.440]   But you see, my friends, instead of fearing, look at this enemy and examine him, and look
[00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:34.200]   behind the pomp and the royal apparel and all the apparent appearance of greatness and
[00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:40.920]   invincibility. And this is what you'll find. It's very interesting. These powers that seem
[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:49.440]   to be so confident against us are really very nervous of us and very frightened of us. Well,
[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:53.640]   where do you find that, sirs, and when will I find it here? We are told that because he
[00:09:53.640 --> 00:10:02.000]   saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to take Peter also. But he didn't kill him
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:08.480]   immediately. I read like this. I read in brackets, in verse 3, "Then were the days of unleavened
[00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:17.080]   bread. And when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison and delivered him to four
[00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:24.560]   quaternions of soldiers to keep him, intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people."
[00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:32.800]   Now, this is the most interesting point. This dictator, this monster, this opponent of the
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:40.080]   faith, King Herod, he'd taken James and he'd put him to death. Then he arrests Peter. Now,
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:47.040]   why didn't he kill him? Well, we are told why he didn't kill him because it was a custom
[00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:55.680]   among the Jews that during these days round about Easter, no one was to be put to death.
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:11:01.300]   That's why we are told these were the days of unleavened bread. So instead of killing
[00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:09.160]   Peter immediately, he threw him into prison, intending after Easter to bring him forth
[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:14.280]   to the people and to put him to death. But this is the interesting thing. He put him
[00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:23.600]   in prison and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him. You realize what
[00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:30.720]   that means? A quaternion of soldiers means four soldiers. And what actually happened
[00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:39.280]   was this. Peter was always guarded by four soldiers. And they did duty for a number of
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:47.080]   hours, then were replaced by another four. And indeed, he was looked after by four lots
[00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:53.080]   of four soldiers, guarding him and keeping him. And in addition, you remember, we were
[00:11:53.080 --> 00:12:01.560]   told that there were massive iron gates and that he was bound with chains to two soldiers
[00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:08.640]   and that there were keepers keeping the door of the prison. Well, now, this is what's interesting.
[00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:18.240]   Why all these precautions? Peter was an ordinary man. He was a fisherman. He wasn't a soldier.
[00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:23.960]   He'd got no sword. He'd got no armaments. He'd got nothing at all to defend himself.
[00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:30.860]   These Christians were simple, helpless people. And yet you notice the elaborate precautions
[00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:39.180]   that this king takes to keep this man and to prevent his disappearing. Now, why is this?
[00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:46.400]   Well, the answer, you see, is quite simple. He was afraid of Peter. He was afraid of Christianity.
[00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:52.240]   Though these Christians were so helpless and so weak, these mighty powers that had all
[00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:58.960]   the resources on their sides were trembling with fear. Why was it? Well, the earlier chapters
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:04.200]   answer the question. These Christians had a curious habit of disappearing out of prisons
[00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:11.360]   in a miraculous manner. And the result was that these great tyrants and opposing forces
[00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:16.320]   were afraid of them and wondering what was happening to them. And my friends, I remind
[00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:23.680]   you of this for our comfort this afternoon. The world is loud and bursting and apparently
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:30.720]   triumphant. But you know, the fact is, it's still afraid of the Christian faith. I believe
[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:36.520]   that that's why it persecutes as it does. It's afraid of us. They have a feeling within
[00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:43.440]   them that they're facing something that is greater than all their power. You remember
[00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:49.120]   how we are told that Mary, Queen of Scots, was much more frightened of the prayers of
[00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:55.640]   John Knox than she was of the English army. That's the principle. Now, let's not be afraid,
[00:13:55.640 --> 00:14:01.560]   therefore, of all that's set against us. So many timid Christians of the present time
[00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:06.840]   say, "Oh, the outlook is so terrible. What can we do? Look at the television and the
[00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:11.160]   wireless and the books and the journals and the articles and the scientists and the great
[00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:17.280]   people. They're all against us. What can we do?" Well, the first thing I say to you is
[00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:24.120]   don't be afraid of them. Don't quake. Don't tremble. Ultimately, they're afraid of you
[00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:30.520]   and they show it in most extraordinary manners. But come, let's go beyond that. That's purely
[00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:38.280]   negative. What did the Church actually do? Now, I've already said that the danger today
[00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:47.400]   is to jump in a frantic manner at all sorts and kinds of expedience. You see it happening,
[00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:51.720]   trying to make the Church popular, trying to entertain the people, trying to entice
[00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:59.880]   them. That's not the way. Our ultimate weapon is the one that we read of in verse 5. "Peter,
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:08.720]   therefore, was kept in prison, but prayer was made of the Church without ceasing, and
[00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:16.640]   to God for him." Now, we're to go on preaching. We're to go on doing our work. But our ultimate
[00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:27.240]   hope lies in prayer. This is the ultimate weapon of the Church. And until she returns
[00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:34.960]   to this, she will not succeed. In this present century, we've seen the Church doing almost
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:40.840]   everything to maintain the cause and to attract the people. But the statistics alone prove
[00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:47.760]   that it's not succeeding. There is only one way, and the Church must come back to this.
[00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:55.880]   These people had enough sense to see this. The contest was unequal. They, as I say, were
[00:15:55.880 --> 00:16:02.280]   unimportant. They were helpless, and all the powers were against them. So they didn't call
[00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:10.320]   a conference. They didn't organize some kind of opposition. They realized immediately that
[00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:15.120]   there was only one hope for them, and that was in God. So the moment they heard that
[00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:24.000]   Peter had been arrested and thrown into prison, they began to pray for him without ceasing.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.160]   Very well, but someone may say, "That's all very well. You Christian people, that's what
[00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:32.440]   you tend to do. Whenever there's a problem or a difficulty, you say, 'Let's pray about
[00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:39.960]   it.' And we do pray, and nothing happens." And so they become discouraged. And I agree,
[00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:47.760]   this question of prayer is not a simple one. It's not an easy one. There is a lot of glib,
[00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:55.160]   easy talk about prayer, which is unintelligent. Prayer is one of the greatest tasks that the
[00:16:55.160 --> 00:17:03.080]   Christian ever undertakes. Prayer can be a very difficult subject, and I want this afternoon
[00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:10.080]   just to deal with two aspects of this problem of prayer. When you talk about prayer to people,
[00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:19.920]   they generally ask two questions. The first one is this, "How does God answer prayer?"
[00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:25.600]   And the second one, "When does God answer prayer?" You've probably asked that question
[00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:32.240]   many times. You've been praying for someone or praying for yourself, and this is the question
[00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:40.200]   you ask. "How does God answer prayer?" And then, "When does God answer prayer?" I've
[00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:44.880]   been praying for a long time, you see. "When does God answer prayer?" Well, now let's look
[00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:52.360]   at these two questions briefly. How does God answer prayer? How did he answer the prayer
[00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:58.760]   of the early church when Peter was thrown into prison? And I imagine someone saying,
[00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:05.000]   "Well, it's a ridiculous question to ask. The answer is so obvious. God answered the
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:11.080]   prayer of the church by working that miracle, sending the angel, and delivering people in
[00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:18.040]   that miraculous manner." Well, of course, you're right in saying that, but before God
[00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:27.720]   did that, he did something else, which to me is equally wonderful and equally remarkable.
[00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:35.000]   And in personal experience, it's one of the most precious things of all. I wonder whether
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:40.960]   you've ever noticed it when you've read this chapter. Before the angel came and awakened
[00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:47.640]   Peter and so on, God had already partially answered the prayer of the church. "Well,
[00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:55.320]   why was that?" you say. Well, here it is. Verse 6, "When Herod would have brought him
[00:18:55.320 --> 00:19:06.560]   forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, and the
[00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:11.840]   keepers before the door kept the prison." What is the significance of that? Well, this
[00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:19.880]   is a glorious lesson, and it's as true today, my friends, as it has ever been. When Herod
[00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:27.880]   would have brought him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping, when was this? Well, the
[00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:34.880]   details we've been given have already answered the question. I've reminded you that these
[00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:42.200]   were the days of unleavened bread, and that Herod hadn't killed Peter immediately because
[00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:47.920]   of this custom, this rule, this law, that nobody was to be put to death during those
[00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:53.280]   days. So Herod had thrown him into prison and had guarded him with the four quaternions
[00:19:53.280 --> 00:20:02.160]   of soldiers, intending, after Easter, to bring him forth and to put him to death when Herod
[00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:10.240]   would have brought him forth. In other words, this night was the last night of the days
[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:18.040]   of unleavened bread. The time had now come when Herod could have brought Peter forth,
[00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:24.120]   made a public display of him, and put him to death. And what I'm told here is this,
[00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:33.760]   that that very last night, Peter was sleeping like a newborn babe between the two soldiers.
[00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:40.720]   Now, my friends, I want to ask you a simple question. It's this. Would you have behaved
[00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:47.740]   like Peter in like circumstances? You see, Peter was a Jew, and Peter, like every other
[00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:55.520]   Jew, knew perfectly well about this rule concerning the days of unleavened bread. So that Peter
[00:20:55.520 --> 00:21:02.760]   there in prison, he knew that he was still alive, simply because it happened to be the
[00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:09.000]   days of unleavened bread. And he knew as well as everybody else when the days of unleavened
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:16.640]   bread began and when they ended. So this particular night, he knew that it was the last night
[00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:21.680]   he was going to be here on earth. The next day, the king would be at liberty to take
[00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:29.680]   him forth and to put him to death. Yet in spite of knowing that, Peter was sleeping
[00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:36.840]   between the two soldiers. And indeed, we are told that when the angel came, he had to smite
[00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:44.840]   Peter on the side to wake him up. He was sleeping so soundly. Now, here's my question. If you
[00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:51.880]   knew for certain that this was your last day on earth, and that you were to die tomorrow
[00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:59.120]   morning, would you be sleeping soundly like Peter did? This is the question. But that
[00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:04.680]   leads to another question. How was Peter able to do this? And you know, my friends, there's
[00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:11.640]   only one answer. God was answering the prayer of the church. And God was giving him this
[00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:20.320]   sleep, this blessed peace. Now, the Bible, you know, is full of this kind of thing. God
[00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:27.760]   answers our prayers in apparently simple manners. It isn't always the great and the striking
[00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:33.560]   miracle. He does it in this kind of way. And the psalmists, they knew about this. Listen
[00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:39.680]   to this out of Psalm 3. "I cried unto the Lord with my voice, and he heard me out of
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:49.200]   his holy hill." Listen. "I laid me down and slept. I awaked, for the Lord sustained me."
[00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:54.640]   Now, everybody can lie down. That's not the problem, is it? We can all go to bed. But
[00:22:54.640 --> 00:23:00.000]   the problem is, can you sleep when you've gone to bed? The psalmist says, "I laid me
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:08.040]   down and I slept." Oh, this is God. This is God. And then, you see, he becomes still more
[00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:19.040]   bold in Psalm 4. He says, "I will both lay me down in peace and sleep, for thou, Lord,
[00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:28.000]   only makest me dwell in safety." Now, this is how God acts. "Thou givest thy beloved
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:34.920]   sleep," or "Thou givest thy beloved in sleep." God can enable us to sleep. He can give us
[00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:42.400]   this amazing peace. And you remember the story of those great Protestant martyrs, Latimer
[00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:48.200]   and Ridley. The same thing happened to them. We are told that the morning when Latimer
[00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:53.640]   and Ridley were brought forth to be burnt at the stake, they were sleeping so soundly
[00:23:53.640 --> 00:24:00.480]   that they, in the same manner, had to be awakened. This is God giving us this peace and this
[00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:06.520]   rest. Now, my dear friends, we are living in difficult and in trying days. The whole
[00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:11.440]   world is against us, and the whole world is collapsing round and about us. Or you may
[00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:17.920]   have some personal problem, some grievous burden that you're bearing, and it's a strain
[00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:23.200]   on you, and on your nerves, and you can't sleep. The answer to that, the antidote to
[00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:30.920]   that is to pray to God. The Apostle Paul puts it like this, "In nothing be anxious," and
[00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:39.160]   it's an all-inclusive word. "In nothing be anxious, but in all things," again comprehensive,
[00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:49.200]   "though hell be against you, in all things, with prayer and supplication and thanksgiving,
[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:55.160]   let your requests be made known unto God." What's the answer? Well, it isn't always the
[00:24:55.160 --> 00:25:00.980]   particular answer you required and expected, but an invariable answer is this. If you do
[00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:10.480]   what Paul says, then the peace of God that passeth all understanding shall keep your
[00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:16.320]   heart and mind in the knowledge of Christ Jesus your Lord. You're not told that you'll
[00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:23.320]   have the particular answer, but you are promised that you'll know a peace that passeth all
[00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:29.960]   understanding. You'll be amazed at yourself. I remember reading a few years back about
[00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:35.400]   one of the generals of the Salvation Army. I think it was General Carpenter. He and his
[00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:42.200]   wife had only had one child, a daughter, a beautiful, a lovely girl, and in her teens
[00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:49.640]   she was taken desperately ill. And they, of course, began to pray for her recovery. And
[00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:55.700]   they went on praying, and the doctors came, and the report was worse almost every visit.
[00:25:55.700 --> 00:26:03.840]   She was obviously dying, and they went on praying intensely and earnestly for her recovery.
[00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:09.760]   And this had gone on for months. One morning they both got up and they knelt by the side
[00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:19.040]   of the bed to pray again. And suddenly they both felt that they could no longer pray for
[00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:27.160]   her recovery. They were aware of a peace that they'd never known in their lives, and a rest,
[00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:33.740]   and a tranquility. And at first they wondered what it was. Were they overtired? Were they
[00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:39.560]   exhausted? Were they losing their faith? But suddenly they came to the realization, and
[00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:44.360]   I believe it was Mrs. Carpenter who said to the general, she said, "You know what it is?"
[00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:48.400]   He said, "No." She said, "This is the peace of God that passeth all understanding." They
[00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:54.480]   didn't know. The girl was taken. She went to her eternal home. But they were enjoying
[00:26:54.480 --> 00:27:02.560]   perfect rest and peace. That's what we read here, in this simple manner. Never skip any
[00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:07.320]   details in your Bibles, my dear friends. Though the thing may be in brackets, "Then were the
[00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:13.040]   days of unleavened bread." It's put in because it's got a message there. There's a purpose
[00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:18.720]   in recording this, and this is what it's telling us. That though Peter knew for certain in
[00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:24.920]   his own mind that this was to be his last night on the face of this earth, he was sleeping
[00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:32.040]   like a newborn babe. And the angel has to arouse him before he can take him to liberty.
[00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:39.040]   Do you know anything about the peace of God that passeth all understanding? Pray to God.
[00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:43.880]   Now this is the beginning of the answer to the prayer of the early church. But then,
[00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:49.640]   of course, we go on to this very dramatic and miraculous happening. How the angel came
[00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:56.320]   and awoke Peter, and Peter got up and put on his sandals and so on, and marches out
[00:27:56.320 --> 00:28:01.680]   of the prison to liberty. But wait a minute. There are some very interesting and important
[00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:07.320]   details here again. We tend to stop at the miracle, don't we, and just remember this
[00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:12.040]   miraculous happening. But there are some other very interesting side lights here. You ask
[00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:19.920]   the question, "How does God answer prayer?" Well, my first answer is this. When God answers
[00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:27.240]   prayer, he does it in a manner that even an apostle is shocked and can't believe it.
[00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:33.480]   Let me read the words to you. "The angel said unto Peter, 'Gird thyself and bind on thy
[00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:38.680]   sandals,' and so he did. And he saith unto him, 'Cast thy garment about thee, and follow
[00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:45.000]   me.' And he went out, and followed him, and wist not that it was true which was done by
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:51.880]   the angel, but thought he saw a vision." There is Peter walking down the corridor behind
[00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:56.520]   that angel, and what's he saying to himself? Well, what he's saying is this. He said, "Of
[00:28:56.520 --> 00:29:01.760]   course, this is not actually happening to me. I am not literally at liberty and walking
[00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:06.760]   down a corridor behind an angel. That can't happen. It's impossible. I'm guarded by four
[00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:11.680]   quaternions of soldiers. I'm chained to a soldier on each side. I must be seeing things.
[00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:21.000]   I must be having a vision." He thought he saw a vision. When God answers prayer, he
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:28.240]   even amazes a leading apostle. He shocks him. You know, our troubled Christian people is
[00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:34.360]   we don't believe in God. We say we do, but we don't really believe in Him. If you really
[00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:41.740]   believe in God, nothing is impossible. But to Peter, this was apparently impossible.
[00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:49.360]   He wist not, but thought he saw an angel. He couldn't believe it. It was so marvelous.
[00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:55.080]   But let's be fair to Peter. He was not the only one who was shocked and taken in unbelief.
[00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:59.760]   Let me go on with the record. I read here that, "When they were past the first and the
[00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:04.840]   second ward, they came into the iron gate that leadeth unto the city, which opened to
[00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:08.880]   them of his own accord." Yes, this is all miraculous. "And they went out and passed
[00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:13.880]   through one street, and forthwith the angel departed from him. And when Peter was come
[00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:20.760]   to himself, at last he realized that it was true. Now I know of a surety that the Lord
[00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:24.840]   hath sent His angel, and hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the
[00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:30.760]   expectation of the Jews." At last, he realized that it was true, and that he'd been guilty
[00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:35.880]   of lack of faith and of unbelief. But go on. "When he had considered the thing, he came
[00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:40.600]   to the house of Mary, the mother of John, whose surname was Mark, where many were gathered
[00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:45.600]   together praying. And as Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a damsel came to hearken
[00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:52.840]   named Rhoda. And when she knew Peter's voice, she opened not the gate for gladness, but
[00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:57.640]   ran in and told how Peter stood before the gate. She ran into the church that was praying
[00:30:57.640 --> 00:31:06.960]   for Peter. And they said unto her, Thou art mad." They thought the poor girl had become
[00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:12.840]   mad. She said, "Peter's knocking at the gate." They said, "You're mad. It's impossible."
[00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:18.560]   But she constantly affirmed that it was even so. Then said they, "It is His angel."
[00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:24.200]   Now, this is what we've got to grasp. These people to whom Rhoda gave the report were
[00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:28.720]   the early church that were praying for Peter. These are the people, we are told in verse
[00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:34.600]   5, that began to make prayer for Him without ceasing. And yet, when they're told that Peter
[00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:41.360]   is at the gate, they can't believe it. They say, "You're mad," or "You must have seen
[00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:47.960]   His angel." But then, you see, she, but Peter, continued knocking. And they, when they had
[00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:59.600]   opened the door and saw Him, were astonished. This is how God answers prayer. He answers
[00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:07.440]   it in such a manner that His best praying people simply cannot believe it. Now, I could
[00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:13.120]   tell you stories of how this has been exemplified in the long history of the church throughout
[00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:20.200]   the running centuries. My dear friends, our greatest need is to have faith in God. We
[00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:25.240]   are so frightened of these people that are against us, frightened of all these isms that
[00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:30.360]   are around and about us, that we don't believe in the living God, the acting God, the God
[00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:37.560]   who intervenes, the God who can rout our enemies and cause them to vanish like the morning
[00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:44.920]   mist. So, the message for us, I believe, is this. We've already been singing it in the
[00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:55.320]   hymn of John Newton, "Thou art coming to a king, large petitions with thee bring, for
[00:32:55.320 --> 00:33:03.640]   His grace and power are such. None can ever ask too much." Have you got this faith in
[00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:09.440]   God? People say, "Oh, well, I've read about revivals in past centuries, but surely that
[00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:15.240]   can't happen now, in the 20th century. With all our sophistication and learning, that
[00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:21.660]   can't happen now." God is still the same, my friend. He cannot change. Have faith in
[00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:30.240]   God. Believe in the impossible. Well, I've already partly quoted what was said by that
[00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:41.240]   great originator, in a sense, of the whole missionary movement. Ask great things of God.
[00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:48.720]   Expect great things of God. Are you so fearful about the present condition, the dwindling
[00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:53.360]   congregations, the powers that are against us, that you just wring your hands and feel
[00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:57.560]   it's all hopeless? Do you agree with these people who say we're living in the post-Christian
[00:33:57.560 --> 00:34:06.200]   era and that the church is virtually finished? The answer to all that is, expect great things
[00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:14.560]   from God. Expect the impossible from God. William Carey reminds you of that. Expect
[00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:24.120]   great things from God and then ask Him and expect them. With God, nothing shall be impossible.
[00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:30.680]   This is how the church succeeds. Until we come back to this, there is no hope. We must
[00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:37.680]   realize that our God is the God of the impossible. But let me say just a word about the second
[00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:46.400]   aspect of the question. When does God answer prayer? This again has perplexed many people,
[00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:53.480]   as I've already said. I've been praying for so long, many a person says, but nothing seems
[00:34:53.480 --> 00:35:00.520]   to happen. When does God answer prayer? I'm only going to give one answer this afternoon.
[00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:07.660]   It's the one that's in this chapter. Sometimes God doesn't answer prayer until the very last
[00:35:07.660 --> 00:35:15.280]   moment. The very last moment. Here is our story. Peter is arrested, he's thrown into
[00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:25.920]   prison. And the moment that happened, the church began to pray for him. And they went
[00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:35.360]   on praying. But Peter, you see, was not delivered until the very last moment. When Herod would
[00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:43.760]   have brought him forth, it was then that the miracle happened and Peter was delivered.
[00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:50.800]   So we're entitled to ask a question with reverence. Why did God behave in this manner? God could
[00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:56.840]   have brought Peter to liberty the very first night. The God who delivered him at the last
[00:35:56.840 --> 00:36:02.500]   moment could have delivered him at the first moment. But He didn't do so. And you'll find
[00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:07.860]   as you read the history of the Bible that this is very often the case. That nothing
[00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:12.860]   happens until you are almost at the point of despair and almost at the point of giving
[00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:20.060]   in and giving up, then God acts. But not until then. Why does He do this? Well, I think there
[00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:29.260]   are many answers to that question. One is that God is concerned about training us and
[00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:37.940]   developing us and developing our faith. You know, God is our Father and He behaves with
[00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:44.960]   respect to us as a natural father does with regard to a little child. If you always carry
[00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:50.540]   that infant child of yours, he'll never be able to walk. The day comes when you've got
[00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:55.860]   to put him on his feet and allow him to stumble and perhaps to fall and pick him up. That's
[00:36:55.860 --> 00:37:01.900]   the way his muscles are strengthened and he learns to coordinate his movements. And God
[00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:10.140]   is like that with us. God tests us. We like to see our children developing and we test
[00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:16.380]   them. And God tests us. You see, it's one thing when everything is going well and the
[00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:21.380]   sun is shining and your family is with you and you're enjoying good health. It's one
[00:37:21.380 --> 00:37:27.340]   thing then to make bold statements and you seem to have great faith. But the question
[00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:33.420]   is have you got equal faith when things begin to go wrong? Have you got the same faith when
[00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:38.500]   you're lying on your back in bed in a hospital? Have you got the same faith when you know
[00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:43.180]   you're going to have an operation out of which you may not recover the next morning? This
[00:37:43.180 --> 00:37:50.340]   is when the test of faith comes. It's very easy to speak of it and to speak boldly. But
[00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:57.740]   it is the test that shows the value and the strength of our faith. And God does test us.
[00:37:57.740 --> 00:38:04.380]   There is no question of this. Take the classical example of Job. God allowed the devil to tempt
[00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:11.340]   Job. The devil said, "Oh, this man is a godly man and he believes in you because everything
[00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:16.860]   is going so well. He's a wealthy man. He's got a number of children and he's very prosperous.
[00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:22.940]   You just take away his children and his goods and his possession and you'll soon find that
[00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:28.580]   he hasn't got much belief in you." So God allowed the devil to test him, even to the
[00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:34.740]   extent of giving him that horrible disease of his skin, you remember. God tests us in
[00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:40.260]   order that our faith may be examined. And it's all for our good. Our faith does need
[00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:47.040]   to be examined. And as I say, in addition to testing us, he's concerned about developing
[00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:54.420]   us and strengthening us. And it's when you pass through experiences like this, your faith
[00:38:54.420 --> 00:39:00.820]   begins to grow. You prove God. You discover that what he said is true, that these are
[00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:06.500]   not idle fairy tales, but that the Word of God is sure, that his promises are always
[00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:12.260]   sure. It's as you discover these things in experience that your faith grows and develops
[00:39:12.260 --> 00:39:19.660]   and increases and you end by believing the very impossible itself. Well, these are some
[00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:27.580]   of the reasons. But you know, I believe that the particular, the special reason in this
[00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:34.820]   particular case that we're dealing with in Acts 12, I believe the explanation here was
[00:39:34.820 --> 00:39:40.540]   something slightly different. And it's of great encouragement at this present time.
[00:39:40.540 --> 00:39:48.700]   Why didn't God release Peter the first night? Why does he wait until the end of the days
[00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:56.260]   of unleavened bread, the very morning when Peter was to be brought forth to death? And
[00:39:56.260 --> 00:40:05.460]   there's only one answer. It was that God might make the discomfiture of this cruel tyrant
[00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:13.560]   plain and clear and obvious to everybody. Look at it like this. I like to imagine and
[00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:20.540]   to think of what was happening in the court of King Herod this last night when Peter was
[00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:28.020]   sleeping so soundly between the two soldiers. And this is what I see happening. The king
[00:40:28.020 --> 00:40:36.040]   had made a great banquet and there were gathered together all the courtiers and the sycophants
[00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:42.260]   and of course at a given point in the banquet the king got up and delivered one of his famous
[00:40:42.260 --> 00:40:49.220]   orations to them. What was the theme of the oration on this occasion? Well, it was undoubtedly
[00:40:49.220 --> 00:40:55.820]   this matter. You see, these Christians had come into being. This so-called sect of the
[00:40:55.820 --> 00:41:02.780]   Nazarenes, these ridiculous little people, these ignoramuses that believed that a man
[00:41:02.780 --> 00:41:11.260]   called Jesus of Nazareth, a carpenter, was the eternal son of God. This ridiculous nonsense.
[00:41:11.260 --> 00:41:16.940]   These people believed that when that felon was crucified and died on a cross in a place
[00:41:16.940 --> 00:41:24.100]   called Calvary, that this somehow was making atonement for people's sins. This nonsensical
[00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:29.820]   teaching that this Jesus who thus had died a felon's death and had been buried in a
[00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:36.700]   grave had literally risen in the body from the grave. This nonsense that only credulous,
[00:41:36.700 --> 00:41:42.140]   ignorant, contemptible people could possibly believe. But they were a nuisance because
[00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:46.300]   other ignorant people were listening to them and were following them and the number was
[00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:51.500]   increasing and the church was growing and developing. The time has come, he said, for
[00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:56.180]   us to put this to an end. And then he said he'd got a great and an important announcement
[00:41:56.180 --> 00:42:00.620]   to make for them. He said, "Recently, you know, I arrested one of them, a man called
[00:42:00.620 --> 00:42:07.180]   James, and I put him to death. But now, listen," he said, "I've now got the real ringleader,
[00:42:07.180 --> 00:42:13.420]   a man called Peter. I've arrested him. I couldn't put him to death because of the days of unleavened
[00:42:13.420 --> 00:42:18.860]   bread. But as you know, they all end tonight. Tomorrow morning, I'm going to bring him forth
[00:42:18.860 --> 00:42:24.180]   to you. Now, we are going to put an end to this nonsense once and forever. Here is the
[00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:29.940]   leader, the ringleader. He's a bold fellow. He's bolder than all the rest. Peter, I'm
[00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:35.780]   going to bring him out tomorrow morning in the sight of the whole populace. I'll send
[00:42:35.780 --> 00:42:40.940]   my men to make the announcement and gather the crowd together, and we'll show him this
[00:42:40.940 --> 00:42:46.380]   supposed leader, this child of God, this one who says he believes in a person who's risen
[00:42:46.380 --> 00:42:51.780]   from the dead, this one who says that he believes in a God who answers prayer. We'll see the
[00:42:51.780 --> 00:42:58.460]   value of all this." And he waxed eloquent. And I can hear the cheering and the loud and
[00:42:58.460 --> 00:43:03.780]   prolonged applause. They probably rose to their feet, as they do in these modern conferences,
[00:43:03.780 --> 00:43:09.180]   and gave him a great acclamation. They'd never heard such an oration. Marvelous. The end
[00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:16.740]   of Christianity. God allowed him to do all that. He allowed him to inflate the balloon
[00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:24.780]   until it was almost filling the world. And then, when it had reached its maximum, God
[00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:33.300]   simply pricked the bubble, and the whole thing collapsed. You know, this is what I call divine
[00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:42.820]   humor. This is the way that God ridicules these infidels and skeptics. "Upon a set day
[00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:49.140]   herald arrayed in royal apparel, said this was the end of his story, sat upon his throne
[00:43:49.140 --> 00:43:54.860]   and made an oration unto them. And the people gave a shout, saying, 'It is the voice of
[00:43:54.860 --> 00:44:01.260]   a God, and not of a man.' And he received the adulation and the acclamation. He was
[00:44:01.260 --> 00:44:06.260]   ready to be regarded as a God, like modern man does. Man doesn't need God, because he's
[00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:12.580]   so wonderful. And God allows these enemies to inflate themselves. They said, 'It is
[00:44:12.580 --> 00:44:22.500]   the voice of a God, and not of a man.' And he was there swelling with pride. And immediately,
[00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:31.380]   the angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not God the glory. And he was eaten of
[00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:41.460]   worms and gave up the ghost." That's the end of him. Notice the contrast? But the Word
[00:44:41.460 --> 00:44:49.380]   of God grew, and multiplied. The enemy is disgraced, he's humbled, he's humiliated
[00:44:49.380 --> 00:44:58.260]   before his own admirers, the ones who laugh and scoff in derision at this blessed message,
[00:44:58.260 --> 00:45:06.580]   are thus brought to naught. God sometimes delays the answer in order that the final
[00:45:06.580 --> 00:45:15.500]   defeat and exposure and discomfiture of the arrogant enemy may be exposed before the whole
[00:45:15.500 --> 00:45:22.300]   world and brought to nothing. That's the answer. That's what happened at the resurrection.
[00:45:22.300 --> 00:45:26.860]   That's what's been happening throughout the running centuries. I started by saying that
[00:45:26.860 --> 00:45:33.140]   we're living in dark and difficult days for the Christian Church. And we are. And there
[00:45:33.140 --> 00:45:39.140]   are many poor Christians who are filled with pessimism and hopelessness and despair. My
[00:45:39.140 --> 00:45:45.380]   dear friend, read your Bible. Read the history of the Christian Church. This isn't the first
[00:45:45.380 --> 00:45:53.020]   time things have been like this. Go back and read of the state of the Church and the world
[00:45:53.020 --> 00:46:01.020]   immediately prior to the Protestant Reformation. Roman Catholicism was in full sway. The Gospel
[00:46:01.020 --> 00:46:05.900]   was completely hidden. The people were in ignorance. And Christianity seemed to be coming
[00:46:05.900 --> 00:46:15.260]   to an end suddenly, unexpectedly. God raised up one man, Martin Luther, and shook that
[00:46:15.260 --> 00:46:23.540]   church and she's still shaking. And a great reformation and revival came into being. About
[00:46:23.540 --> 00:46:30.860]   250 years ago, the state of this country from the Christian and religious standpoint was
[00:46:30.860 --> 00:46:39.780]   almost hopeless. Here in Wales and in England, the churches were empty. You had drunken parsons
[00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:49.060]   and so on. It was gross darkness. It was the gin age. Vice was rampant. Drunkenness, alcoholism.
[00:46:49.060 --> 00:46:56.980]   There it was. And the cause of Christianity seemed to be completely hopeless. Suddenly,
[00:46:56.980 --> 00:47:04.420]   when all was finished, God raised a man like Howell Harris, in a little hamlet called Rebecca,
[00:47:04.420 --> 00:47:12.700]   or Daniel Rowland in Llangaether. And a great and a mighty revival came. And so it was in
[00:47:12.700 --> 00:47:18.900]   England with Whitefield and the Westies. So it has continued to be throughout the running
[00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:26.220]   centuries. My friends, this is the way we face the present position. We mustn't use
[00:47:26.220 --> 00:47:32.580]   our own cleverness and ingenuity and think that by dancing before people or miming the
[00:47:32.580 --> 00:47:38.640]   gospel or having drama. We mustn't believe this modern idea that man is incapable of
[00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:44.460]   receiving the Word of God. He is by nature, but the Spirit can enlighten him. And what
[00:47:44.460 --> 00:47:51.340]   we need is the Spirit of enlightening. We must pray God to shower his Spirit upon us.
[00:47:51.340 --> 00:47:57.540]   And in the power of the Spirit, the ignoramuses will be able to believe. And the Church will
[00:47:57.540 --> 00:48:06.260]   revive. And great and amazing and glorious things will yet happen in the Church of God.
[00:48:06.260 --> 00:48:14.620]   Well now, that's the message of this chapter. It's a perfect parallel with our present position.
[00:48:14.620 --> 00:48:23.940]   So I end by repeating the same words again. Have faith in God. Do this for the Church
[00:48:23.940 --> 00:48:33.660]   in general. Do this with regard to your own personal problem. God has pledged to answer
[00:48:33.660 --> 00:48:40.540]   our petitions. Not always in the way we expect, but he will answer. It may be that your answer
[00:48:40.540 --> 00:48:45.660]   will be that which came to General Carpenter and his wife, or that which Peter had when
[00:48:45.660 --> 00:48:51.460]   he was still in prison. But there's nothing more glorious in this world than the peace
[00:48:51.460 --> 00:48:58.420]   of God which passeth all understanding. If you have that, though hell is let loose against
[00:48:58.420 --> 00:49:07.740]   you, though you're dying, it doesn't matter. You will know this blessed, perfect peace
[00:49:07.740 --> 00:49:16.180]   which the world can neither give nor ever take away. Have faith in God, my dear friends.
[00:49:16.180 --> 00:49:22.180]   The arm of flesh will fail you, however you use it. With your cleverness, your organization,
[00:49:22.180 --> 00:49:28.580]   your psychological understanding of the modern man, it'll all fail you. This is God's way.
[00:49:28.580 --> 00:49:35.020]   It's God's Church and he maintains it in his own power and in his own way. And our first
[00:49:35.020 --> 00:49:43.700]   duty is to pray to God without ceasing, for a mighty revival and reawakening. And I have
[00:49:43.700 --> 00:49:50.220]   little doubt that when it does come, we will be the first people to be surprised, even
[00:49:50.220 --> 00:49:55.820]   as Peter was, and as the early Church was. It doesn't matter. In spite of our ignorance
[00:49:55.820 --> 00:50:02.220]   and our lack of faith and our frailty, God will vindicate his own cause. And it'll go
[00:50:02.220 --> 00:50:12.660]   on until all his people are safely gathered in, and Christ will come and will reign from
[00:50:12.660 --> 00:50:22.540]   shore to shore, and we shall know and enjoy that everlasting glory which God has prepared
[00:50:22.540 --> 00:50:33.980]   for his people. Let us pray. O Lord our God, we pray thee to pardon our unbelief, our little
[00:50:33.980 --> 00:50:43.180]   faith. We are amazed, O Lord, at thy patience with us. But we rest on this knowledge that
[00:50:43.180 --> 00:50:50.940]   the Church is thine, thou wilt never forsake her, and thou wilt bring thy purposes to pass.
[00:50:50.940 --> 00:50:57.580]   We thank thee for these shocks thou dost administer to us individually and collectively, from
[00:50:57.580 --> 00:51:04.660]   time to time. We thank thee, looking back, O Lord, even for the delays in the answer.
[00:51:04.660 --> 00:51:11.100]   We thank thee for every lesson thou wast ever taught us, by keeping us waiting. O God, increase
[00:51:11.100 --> 00:51:21.380]   our faith, enlarge our expectation, and may the day come when we shall indeed be shocked
[00:51:21.380 --> 00:51:30.260]   and amazed at the glory and the might of thy power. Great God, we worship thee, we bow
[00:51:30.260 --> 00:51:37.500]   before thee, and we ascribe unto thee and unto thee alone all praise and honor and glory
[00:51:37.500 --> 00:51:45.340]   in the name of thy dear Son, our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen.
