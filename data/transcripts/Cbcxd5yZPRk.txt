[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   All right, Jesse, what's our first question here?
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.260]   - All right, first question is from
[00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:06.260]   Little Better Than Average.
[00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:08.120]   In the era of quiet quitting,
[00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.740]   the new normal is to just do the bare minimum.
[00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.860]   Does this mean that showing even a little bit
[00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.500]   of initiative and willingness to do more important work
[00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.460]   can now set you apart from others?
[00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.680]   - I have two parts to my answer here.
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.780]   I mean, first, let me just address this idea
[00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:26.920]   that we're in an era of quiet quitting,
[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.880]   where quiet quitting is so ubiquitous
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.140]   that it's just assumed that most people around you
[00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.260]   are doing this.
[00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.300]   That, of course, is nonsense.
[00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.760]   The thing about internet movements
[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.500]   is that because they're leveraging
[00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.700]   the amplification effects of internet distributed
[00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:43.920]   and algorithmic curation,
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.780]   they have a way for those who are plugged into it,
[00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.700]   they have a way of making internet trends
[00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.000]   seeming universal.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.360]   Everyone is doing this.
[00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.380]   Everyone is feeling this.
[00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.460]   We see this on topic after topic, right?
[00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.780]   So, like, you're plugged into,
[00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.920]   let's say you're plugged into med Twitter
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.280]   during the COVID pandemic.
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.920]   Suddenly in your mind, like, all of these
[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.960]   particular possible terrible things around COVID
[00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.240]   are happening everywhere.
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.320]   And it's only by the grace of God
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.520]   you've survived being outside for 10 minutes
[00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.480]   because the internet makes these things seem totalizing.
[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.640]   Let's say you're in political Twitter,
[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.920]   you're really plugged in the conservative Twitter,
[00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.780]   and it makes it feel like, or independent Twitter,
[00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.580]   it makes it feel like essentially 80% of the populace
[00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:33.860]   has been canceled.
[00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.780]   And there's almost no one left,
[00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.020]   and there's marauding bands of cancelers,
[00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.220]   and you're a day away from it,
[00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:40.060]   'cause it totalizes.
[00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.900]   It makes it seem like this is happening everywhere.
[00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.140]   Well, same thing for a trend like quiet quitting.
[00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.140]   I'm sure the actual number of people
[00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.460]   who would say, "I am doing this,
[00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:50.500]   "I'm purposely pulling back,"
[00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.300]   is a relatively small percentage,
[00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.180]   and has no real large effect on,
[00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.320]   let's say, the dynamics of your particular workplace.
[00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.120]   But the internet, if you're plugged into,
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.960]   let's say, TikTok,
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.120]   makes it seem like everyone is doing this.
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.640]   So that's just a side commentary on internet movements.
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.600]   That's not to say, by the way, that it's not important.
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.080]   I think internet movements play a good signaling purpose.
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.240]   Like quiet quitting's importance is not that,
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.600]   "Oh my God, everyone's doing this now.
[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.080]   "What's gonna happen to the economy?"
[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.880]   Because of course, that's not what's happening.
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.120]   It's importance is there's a real signal
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.800]   that's being amplified here.
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.960]   So there's an actual unease or dis-ease
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.180]   that this particular generation is having with work
[00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.160]   as they're trying to figure out
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.460]   the role of work in their life.
[00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:28.900]   That signal's important,
[00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.820]   and it's important to amplify that signal.
[00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.680]   So that's where internet movements are important,
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.260]   is that they amplify signals that might be meaningful
[00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.020]   to shifts happening in the culture,
[00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.100]   but we have to be careful
[00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.780]   because the tendency or human wiring
[00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.060]   is to receive it as if this thing is happening universally.
[00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.020]   So you can be worried about COVID
[00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.860]   without thinking that you're probably
[00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.860]   gonna be the last person alive in your town.
[00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.940]   You can be worried about things like cancellation,
[00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.220]   without also having to believe
[00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.340]   that you're like one day away from it,
[00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.940]   and most universities have lost
[00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.460]   half of their faculty to canceling.
[00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.940]   So this is the tension of internet movements.
[00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.920]   They can amplify messages,
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.480]   but that amplification mechanism
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.480]   can deceive us in the feeling like these trends
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.060]   are way more universal than they really are.
[00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.220]   This is a bit of a divergence,
[00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.780]   but just a little bit of internet culture chat.
[00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.480]   So what about this particular question though?
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.980]   If people are average,
[00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.980]   do I have to do just a little bit more to stand out?
[00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:24.980]   Yes, this is true.
[00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.060]   And we don't need quiet quitting
[00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.440]   for this to be an effective dynamic.
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.780]   This is something I've talked about for years,
[00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.660]   especially if you are entry level
[00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.860]   in a knowledge work setting.
[00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:40.040]   You do not have to be a superstar on a national scale
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.980]   to quickly get ahead.
[00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.580]   You have to just be a little bit better
[00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.240]   than the other young employees at your same employer.
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.340]   And that's not as hard as you think.
[00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:50.940]   And in particular, there's two things you can do
[00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.460]   that will almost always make you stand out.
[00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.340]   One, deliver.
[00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.340]   So people trust you not to drop the ball.
[00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.300]   If they ask you to do something, you do it.
[00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:01.220]   And you get it done by the time
[00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:02.060]   you said it's gonna get done.
[00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:03.660]   And they don't have to worry about bothering you
[00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.940]   and sending you follow up messages and saying,
[00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.580]   sometimes Cal does this, sometimes Cal doesn't.
[00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.300]   They trust you're gonna get things done.
[00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.700]   It's not that hard to do, but it's pretty rare.
[00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.660]   And that gets noticed.
[00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.740]   A quick test about whether or not you're succeeding
[00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:20.520]   on that particular property.
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:24.420]   Do the people you work for send lots of follow up emails
[00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:26.500]   or chats after they ask you to do something like,
[00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:27.340]   hey, how's this going?
[00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:28.160]   Have you done this yet?
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.460]   If so, that means they don't really trust you.
[00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.320]   If they don't, then you're probably doing this right.
[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.700]   Number two, exceed expectations.
[00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.500]   You don't need to be a perfectionist,
[00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.300]   but just when you get a task,
[00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.740]   think like, what do they really need here?
[00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:44.660]   What are they really looking for?
[00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.940]   Let me make sure I get them what's really gonna help them.
[00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.560]   Like, what is the,
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.860]   why did they want me to pull out these quotes?
[00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.500]   Oh, they're trying to put together this marketing message.
[00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.620]   My boss is putting together this whatever.
[00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.060]   And so what would really make that succeed?
[00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.780]   Well, let me pull out some better, let me call up a client.
[00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.480]   I know what he needs.
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:02.740]   And so let me make sure that like,
[00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.740]   I'm really meeting those expectations.
[00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:05.660]   You don't have to be perfectionist.
[00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.580]   It's not like you're knocking down the park.
[00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.020]   It's just that we know when Cal turns something in,
[00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.360]   it's gonna be what we need.
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:12.200]   It's gonna be good.
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.460]   It's not gonna be, hey, I did the task, man.
[00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:15.300]   Why are you on my back?
[00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.260]   Like, technically I put some quotes down.
[00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:18.560]   You know, like this guy did,
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.840]   this client did ask me where the bathroom is.
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.760]   That is technically a quote.
[00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.680]   Get off my back, quiet quitting.
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.040]   I'm worth more than my labor.
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:28.120]   I'm a human being.
[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.700]   Just meet the expectations you're looking for.
[00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:33.400]   You do these two things,
[00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.640]   in about one year, you're gonna,
[00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:39.680]   your path is going to angle upwards much quicker.
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.840]   It's not hard, but it's rare.
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.400]   Of course, the question is why,
[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.640]   like why bother advancing quickly when you're new to a job?
[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.060]   I mean, isn't that just playing into, you know,
[00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:53.300]   the sort of exploitative dynamic of capitalism
[00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:54.200]   or something like that?
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.180]   The reason is, is because when you advance quickly,
[00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:57.360]   you build career capital.
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.140]   Career capital is what gives you control over your career.
[00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:02.140]   Career capital is what's gonna set you free.
[00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:03.860]   Career capital is what's going to allow you
[00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.700]   to decide what you want your working life to be like,
[00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:09.260]   mold it towards what resonates and away from what doesn't.
[00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:13.740]   It is the only way to make your job work for you
[00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.800]   and not the other way around.
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.800]   The things that make great work great is appealing.
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:20.960]   It's in demand.
[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.800]   You have to have something to offer in return.
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:27.940]   So if you don't like aspects of work,
[00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:31.400]   you don't like this thing or this boss or these hours,
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.760]   you can't complain your way out of it.
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.900]   You usually can't quit your way out of it,
[00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:37.740]   but you can career capital your way out of it.
[00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:39.520]   You become so good, you can't be ignored.
[00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:41.580]   And then you use those skills as leverage and say,
[00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:43.360]   not today, now I'm doing this.
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:44.280]   Now I'm doing that.
[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.240]   I'm going over here.
[00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:46.060]   I'm freelancing.
[00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:47.280]   I'm renegotiating my contract.
[00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.440]   I'm going to this company that just specialize on this,
[00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.840]   fully remote, and I only check in once a week.
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.840]   All of those types of things that you could use
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.120]   to take control of your career
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:58.400]   are returns on investment of career capital
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.640]   gathered by you being good and advancing quickly.
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:02.400]   This is the quickest way to get to career capital
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.000]   if you're new.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.760]   Be reliable, don't drop the ball,
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:07.260]   deliver past expectations.
[00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.200]   Do those things for a year.
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:11.160]   Your trajectory goes fast.
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.920]   Just remember, as you build your capital,
[00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:14.520]   don't wait too long to invest it.
[00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:18.400]   I actually have an article,
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.200]   might be out by the time this comes out,
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:23.240]   of a quiet quitting article I wrote for The New Yorker
[00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:26.920]   that we were fact checking it and copyediting it.
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:27.760]   So I think it's ready.
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:29.400]   So it's probably, it's kind of like a year
[00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:30.360]   in review style article.
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:31.600]   So probably, I don't know,
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.900]   but probably by the time you hear this podcast,
[00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:35.920]   I'll have a quiet quitting article
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:36.760]   you can find at The New Yorker.
[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:37.800]   And if not, then, you know,
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:40.320]   it'll be like in the new year or something.
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.440]   I've been thinking a lot about quiet quitting recently.
[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:45.020]   (upbeat music)
[00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:47.600]   (upbeat music)
