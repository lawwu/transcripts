[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.720]   Hello, this is Pastor John. I get to start this episode by talking about another Pastor
[00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:16.440]   John, John Newton. Newton was a key leader in England in the 18th century, as you know,
[00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:23.280]   the author of the incredibly popular hymn Amazing Grace. Newton was a former captain
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:29.920]   of a slave trading ship and was dramatically converted from this life of sin and eventually
[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:35.880]   helped William Wilberforce in the British slave trade. So I wanted to take a moment
[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.240]   to introduce you to a new book about a part of Newton's life that goes overlooked. His
[00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:49.720]   40 plus years in pastoral ministry and the amazing ministry of writing letters to people
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:56.080]   in need. The book is written by Tony Reinke, the host of this podcast. Tony calls his book
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:02.640]   Pastoral Synthesis. He wants you to be pastored by John Newton. And so he gathered up all
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:09.360]   of Newton's many published letters, about a thousand of them in various collections,
[00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.960]   many of them preserved in old, rare, fragile volumes in libraries around the world. He
[00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:22.340]   found them, studied them, and then identified Newton's key answers to the perennial questions
[00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:29.360]   of the Christian life. And then Tony wrote all his findings into a guided tour of Newton's
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:37.640]   thought. It's a kind of Ask Pastor John Newton. The book releases this week. It's titled
[00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:43.680]   Newton on the Christian Life to Live as Christ. I commend it very highly.
[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:57.460]   Well, it's not easy to find examples of Christians who got the tough and tender balance
[00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:03.220]   just right in the Christian life. Jesus is of course the supreme example of this. Another
[00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:08.940]   example of fallen example comes from England in the 18th century and a pastor named John
[00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:15.500]   Newton. John Piper explained in his 2001 message to pastors titled, "John Newton, the Tough
[00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.900]   Roots of His Habitual Tenderness." Here's what he said.
[00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:28.820]   John Newton was born July 24, 1725 in London, 1725, so picture yourself now how long ago
[00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:37.420]   that was, to a godly mother and an irreligious seafaring father. She died when he was six,
[00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:45.020]   left mainly to himself. He became a debauched sailor, a miserable outcast on the west coast
[00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:54.300]   of Africa for a couple of years, a slave trading sea captain until an epileptic seizure ended
[00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:06.660]   his sea going career, a well-paid surveyor of tides in Liverpool, a devoted and loved
[00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:15.220]   pastor of two congregations in Olney and London for a total of 43 years, a devoted husband
[00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:23.100]   to Mary for 40 years until she died in 1790, and last of all, the writer of the most famous
[00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:29.220]   hymn in the English language, "Amazing Grace," which you heard and sang exactly as he wrote
[00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:39.060]   it, not with that wonderful last verse which we love and he did not write. And he died
[00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:49.140]   in 1807 at 82. So why am I interested in this man? What's my agenda before you this morning?
[00:03:49.140 --> 00:04:00.180]   I'm interested in him because of my great desire to see Christian pastors be as strong
[00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:09.780]   and durable as redwood trees and as tender and fragrant as a field of clover. I want
[00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:18.780]   to see you become rugged in the defense and confirmation of the truth and relentlessly
[00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:26.180]   humble and patient and merciful in dealing with people.
[00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:31.540]   Ever since I came to Bethlehem in 1980, I've had this vision of what I want to be and what
[00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:39.260]   I want to be the means of others becoming because in the early 1980s, I read Matthew
[00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:48.180]   and Mark in my Greek Testament, writing in the margin, T.E. and T.O. beside every tender
[00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:56.620]   thing Jesus said or did and every tough thing Jesus said or did. And when I got done, the
[00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:05.500]   mixture was amazing. No man ever spoke, no man ever lived like this man spoke and lived.
[00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:12.340]   There's nobody like Jesus pastoring today. And I want to be more like that. And I want
[00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:18.620]   you to be more like that. And therefore, as I look at pastors in history and around and
[00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:25.060]   I find one who got something that we need, then I bank on it for a while. And that's
[00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:32.340]   what I've been doing since July with Newton. And I know that this drunk peasant who can't
[00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:40.580]   stay on the donkey is where we all are. Everybody in this room is falling off the horse on one
[00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:47.620]   side or the other on this matter of toughness and tenderness. And so it's risky business
[00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:56.660]   in this room to say what I'm going to say. There are a lot of us who are wimping out
[00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:03.540]   on truth when we ought to be lionhearted. And there are a lot who are wrangling with
[00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:09.900]   anger when we ought to be weeping. And so I know I'm going to say some things that are
[00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:20.100]   not what some of you should hear. Some of you need a good, tender kick in the pants
[00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:29.260]   to be more courageous with truth. And some of you need to realize that courage is not
[00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:37.380]   what William Cooper, Newton's good friend, called a furious and abusive zeal. Oh, how
[00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:49.060]   rare are the pastors who speak with a tender heart and have theological backbones of steel.
[00:06:49.060 --> 00:07:00.420]   Oh, how rare it is. And not to be rare. And I don't want it to be rare. Theological truth,
[00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:11.660]   biblical backbones of steel and as soft as clover so that children come to you and broken
[00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:16.060]   people come to you and homosexuals come to you.
[00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:22.820]   Amen. That was from John Piper's 2001 message to pastors titled John Newton, the tough roots
[00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:29.060]   of his habitual tenderness. Special thanks to cellist Patricia White for her rendition
[00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:34.540]   of Amazing Grace off her album, Be Still My Soul, which we are using in this episode.
[00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:37.740]   And thank you to Pastor John for promoting my new book here and for writing the forward
[00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:45.620]   to it. You can read us forward and find more information online at desiringgod.org/newton.
[00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:49.740]   We return tomorrow with Pastor John to answer a perplexing question about how we read our
[00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:53.540]   Bibles. I'm your host Tony Ranke. Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
