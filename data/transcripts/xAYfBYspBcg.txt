[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160]   The general consensus, standard, societal, cultural definition of wealth has always just
[00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.160]   been money.
[00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.440]   In my view, it's really because money is so measurable.
[00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.820]   Peter Drucker, the management theorist, says, "What gets measured gets managed."
[00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.640]   And the reality is, a feature of money is that it is so measurable.
[00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:20.920]   You can place a single number next to your name and determine your entire life worth.
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.180]   Unfortunately, while money is useful as a tool for a whole lot of things in our life,
[00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.240]   it is not the singular thing that contributes to a life of meaning and a life of fulfillment
[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.240]   and happiness.
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.360]   There are many other things.
[00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.960]   That is really what this book is about, the five types of wealth, financial wealth being
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:36.960]   one of them.
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.600]   So I am very much not saying that money doesn't matter and that you should go live off in
[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.160]   the Himalayas meditating 12 hours a day and drinking warm broth.
[00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.880]   If you want to, by all means, go do that.
[00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.240]   I just won't be joining you.
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.560]   But it is a life built around these other four things in addition to money.
[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.220]   those other four are time wealth, social wealth, mental
[00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:56.400]   wealth and physical wealth.
