[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.880]   So that's the deep dive we want to do today.
[00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:06.880]   Today's deep question is, are smartphones bad for kids?
[00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:11.020]   And if so, how do we know that?
[00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:12.120]   That's what I want to get into.
[00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.000]   So I have some of my slides here from my talk.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.560]   So, you know, if you're listening,
[00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.600]   you might want to consider watching.
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.200]   This is episode 246.
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.920]   You can find it at youtube.com/calnewportmedia
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.160]   or at thedeeplife.com if you don't like YouTube.
[00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.280]   Episode 246.
[00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.360]   I'll explain what I'm saying.
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.000]   You don't have to watch it, but I'm just saying,
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.840]   if you want to see some of these graphs I'm referencing,
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.880]   watching the video version of this might be suggested.
[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.760]   So as I looked into this question
[00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.580]   of when did researchers become concerned
[00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.400]   about kids and phones and why,
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.080]   the whole story seemed to break up into three acts.
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.940]   That's why I called this in my talk, a saga in three acts.
[00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.120]   The first act we can start,
[00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.120]   I'm gonna call it roughly 2012 to 2017.
[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.260]   That's the first act of the story.
[00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.920]   I call it an alarm is sounded.
[00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.000]   So this is the period where people
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.480]   first began to notice warning signs.
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.460]   This was actually the period in which
[00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.280]   the potential issues with smartphones
[00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.560]   and young people was first brought to my attention.
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.800]   So I remember as a young professor at Georgetown,
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.980]   this would have been in 2012,
[00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.140]   I was giving a talk somewhere on campus
[00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.140]   and I was walking to the talk with someone
[00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.740]   who was involved with the student mental health center
[00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.340]   at Dartmouth, it's called, or not Dartmouth, Georgetown.
[00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.700]   It's called CAPS and if you're watching on the screen,
[00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.660]   you see a picture of the counseling center.
[00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.940]   And I remember smartphones and tech in general
[00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.060]   was not in my portfolio in 2012 as a writer.
[00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.060]   So we were just having conversation
[00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.340]   and this person mentioned to me, she said,
[00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.560]   "There's been a big change recently.
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.740]   "The number of students that we are now treating
[00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.840]   "with mental health counseling here at Georgetown
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.340]   "has jumped up."
[00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:04.780]   And not only has it jumped up,
[00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.300]   but it has disproportionately jumped up
[00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.540]   to be anxiety or anxiety related disorders.
[00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:12.380]   So we're seeing a lot more overall students
[00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.340]   and a much bigger proportion of the students we see
[00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.980]   are here for anxiety.
[00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:17.820]   I thought that was interesting.
[00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.100]   She said, "Oh, what's going on?"
[00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.520]   She didn't skip a beat.
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.540]   She said, "Smartphones."
[00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.340]   And that caught me off guard at the time.
[00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:25.340]   Smartphones, what do you mean?
[00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.180]   She said, "Oh, it's really clear to me anecdotally
[00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.240]   "that the first group of students to arrive on campus
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.880]   "having had smartphones during their adolescence
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.200]   "were showing up way more anxious
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.840]   "than we'd ever seen before."
[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.200]   We can now look back retrospectively
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.160]   and see that this was not an isolated anecdote
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.480]   happening at just one university.
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.820]   I have a chart on the screen here
[00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:47.760]   for those who are watching.
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.840]   This is from the American College Health Association
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.120]   annual survey.
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.640]   It's showing percentage of US undergraduates
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.080]   diagnosed with a mental illness.
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.200]   And what do we see?
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.520]   At 2012 forward, a very sharp uptick
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:02.880]   in anxiety and depression,
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.680]   which are of course quite interlinked by anxiety.
[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.720]   So the dark vertical line, if you're watching this online,
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.460]   is 2012.
[00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.360]   So what this one person at Georgetown was noticing
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.920]   was actually a nationwide trend,
[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.680]   that something changed around 2012.
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:18.680]   Keep that date in mind.
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:19.920]   It's gonna come up again.
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.640]   I think the issue got brought
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.980]   to the public's attention writ large.
[00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.480]   So it expanded from individual educators
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.700]   and mental health professionals being worried
[00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.340]   to the culture writ large being worried
[00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.140]   about maybe smartphones are causing an issue.
[00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.320]   I think Jean Twenge really helped make this
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.880]   a national issue in her 2017 cover article
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.800]   for The Atlantic that was titled,
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.860]   "Have Smartphones Destroyed a Generation?"
[00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.560]   Now the thing about Twenge is that her expertise
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.580]   is in studying differences between demographic generations.
[00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:58.620]   That's what she does.
[00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.500]   How is this generation different than that generation?
[00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.100]   She's very good at teasing out what's real and what's not.
[00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:05.300]   And as she said in this article,
[00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.380]   and I have it on the screen as well,
[00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.940]   she'd been doing this for 25 years.
[00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.420]   And she says, "Typically the characteristics
[00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.240]   "that come to define a generation appear gradually
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.340]   "and along a continuum.
[00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.600]   "But then I began studying Gen Z.
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.320]   "Around 2012, I noticed abrupt shifts
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.220]   "in teen behaviors and emotional states.
[00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:24.660]   "The gentle slopes of the line graphs
[00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.460]   "became steep mountains and sheer cliffs,
[00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:28.900]   "and many of the distinctive characteristics
[00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.100]   "of the millennial generation began to disappear.
[00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.400]   "In all of my analyses of generational data,
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.920]   "some reaching back to the 1930s,
[00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.980]   "I had never seen anything like it."
[00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:42.620]   So this demographer was thrown by how different Gen Z was,
[00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:47.620]   and not just Gen Z in general, but Gen Z starting in 2012.
[00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.580]   She began to make the connection
[00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.440]   that I think this has to do with smartphones.
[00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.160]   Here's another, I think, culture-defining moment.
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.760]   This was also 2017.
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.600]   A big article in the New York Times Magazine
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.700]   written by Benoit-Denisette Luz.
[00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:03.860]   The article is titled,
[00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:05.840]   "Why are more American teenagers than ever
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.840]   "suffering from severe anxiety?"
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.560]   And it's important because Benoit goes into this article,
[00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.400]   it's clear from the tone of the article
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.320]   that he is not very hospitable
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:17.840]   to the technology hypothesis.
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.600]   He was seeing this as a standard
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.160]   moral panic-type argument, the same thing we always say,
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.400]   rock and roll music is gonna corrupt the teens' brains,
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.280]   video games are gonna corrupt teens' brains,
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.400]   and he came into it with that frame.
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.280]   But there's a key point in this article
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.420]   where he talks to actual anxious teenagers.
[00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:38.840]   And I'm quoting him here.
[00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:43.080]   "To my surprise, anxious teenagers tended to agree."
[00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.120]   They didn't say, "Hey, old man, leave our phones alone."
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.620]   They said, "Yeah, these things are a problem."
[00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:53.160]   So by 2017, we've gone from spot reports of,
[00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.840]   wait a second, something is changing here.
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.800]   These young people, there's something different going on.
[00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.520]   And by 2017, we were openly debating,
[00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.340]   is it phones causing these issues?
[00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:09.240]   All right, this brings us to the second act, the data wars.
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:13.680]   This takes place roughly between 2017 and 2020.
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.960]   This is when researchers begin to seriously try
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:19.280]   to gather or study the data to get a stronger,
[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:22.120]   more data-driven conclusion on this question
[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.480]   of is smartphones somehow involved in these increases
[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.300]   in anxiety that we're seeing?
[00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.280]   This was a period of both proposals and critiques,
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:30.120]   which is good.
[00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.960]   This is how new sciences emerge,
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.360]   especially in social psychology,
[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.520]   which is, by definition, a complicated field
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.580]   that rarely has super strong signals.
[00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:41.160]   There was proposals and critiques
[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:42.380]   or responses to the critiques,
[00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:44.440]   and so that's why I call this the data wars.
[00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:47.480]   This was the period in which almost any New York Times
[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:50.840]   article on this issue would say with big caveats,
[00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:53.640]   there is some data, but it's contested.
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:54.880]   It's 'cause this data war period
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.960]   is when the science was actually happening.
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.680]   Let me talk about two troubling streams of data
[00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:00.760]   that came out of this period,
[00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:03.080]   the critiques and the responses to the critiques.
[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:05.400]   So the first bit of troubling evidence that emerged
[00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:06.960]   as we got more serious about this question
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:11.560]   was simply the timing, that 2012.
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:15.000]   That was a really, it's circumstantial evidence,
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.800]   but a really strong pointer towards smartphones at play,
[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:18.880]   and here's why.
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:22.680]   There's lots of different reasons you could come up for,
[00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:25.120]   come up with for why young people,
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:29.700]   between 2012 and 2020, were becoming more anxious.
[00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:32.360]   The world felt like an anxious place.
[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.080]   We had the financial crisis,
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:36.940]   we had the financial insecurity that that caused,
[00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:39.720]   we had the extreme partisanship and unrest
[00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:42.440]   that followed in the Trump era,
[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:44.280]   and so it did seem like a period
[00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:45.760]   of lots that were going on.
[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:49.400]   The problem is none of this fit 2012 in particular.
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:52.760]   The financial crisis was 2006 to 2009.
[00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:54.480]   The financial insecurity was felt strongly
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:55.880]   by the millennial generation,
[00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:58.480]   we were entering the job force then, not Gen Z.
[00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:00.440]   By the time Gen Z was entering the job force,
[00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.660]   that was largely in the rear view mirror.
[00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:05.240]   There was a lot of political partisanship and unrest
[00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:08.520]   that arose later in the 2010s,
[00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:11.280]   but that was after 2012.
[00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:15.680]   2012 was the Barack Obama, Mitt Romney election.
[00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:18.040]   There was not an increase in partisanship there
[00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:20.720]   as compared to, let's say, even just a 2008 election
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:23.980]   in which we had Sarah Palin involved in that movement,
[00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:26.320]   compared to the Contract for America,
[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:28.520]   Newt Gingrich in the Clinton era,
[00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:29.440]   that type of partisanship.
[00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:31.880]   There wasn't something new that happened in 2012
[00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:34.200]   that wasn't also there in 2009,
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:36.540]   wasn't also there in 1999.
[00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:39.220]   The populist revolutions of Trump, et cetera,
[00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:41.980]   that didn't really pick up speed until '15 or '16,
[00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:44.620]   so that explanation doesn't quite fit it.
[00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:46.960]   Also, as we got more data,
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.240]   we saw these anxiety rises among young people
[00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:51.180]   happening in many, many countries,
[00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:56.180]   so we could not pin this on particular American dynamics.
[00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:58.900]   So what did fit this?
[00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:01.300]   Well, here's Gene, oh, let me just show,
[00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:02.300]   let me show a couple of graphs here.
[00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:04.460]   These are just a couple other graphs
[00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:07.420]   that are showing 2012 being a big deal.
[00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:11.180]   So we see female, especially with female reports
[00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:16.180]   of sadness and hopelessness between 2011 and 2021,
[00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:21.600]   we see a significant increase from 36% to 57%.
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.700]   I'm also showing US teens with major depression,
[00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:26.780]   especially with girls, we see 145% increase
[00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:29.660]   as we move from 2012 to 2020.
[00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:31.380]   So these are just examples of lots of things
[00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:34.080]   were pivoting on 2012.
[00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:36.620]   Here's Gene Twenge.
[00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:41.220]   She said, okay, what does match 2012?
[00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:43.060]   It was exactly the moment when the proportion
[00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:46.580]   of Americans who owned a smartphone surpassed 50%.
[00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:47.940]   That's what's changed then.
[00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:51.700]   After that point, you were much more likely
[00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:53.500]   as an adolescent to have a smartphone.
[00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:55.980]   Before that point, it was much less likely.
[00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:58.280]   None of these other potentially anxiety-producing trends
[00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:00.940]   match that date nearly as well.
[00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:02.980]   All right, so this was the first bit
[00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:04.540]   of troubling evidence to emerge, right?
[00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:05.820]   It's circumstantial.
[00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:06.820]   And there's critiques.
[00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:07.980]   I would say one of the big critiques,
[00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:10.020]   and I'm showing this on the screen in example now,
[00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:12.680]   was this idea that, no, no, no, we agree with you
[00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:15.880]   that there's not world events or cultural events
[00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:18.740]   that match the 2012 outside of smartphones,
[00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:21.060]   but the thing that really changed in 2012
[00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:22.720]   was not smartphones, this critique says.
[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:25.300]   It was that this new generation was coming of age
[00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:29.220]   and they're more comfortable talking about mental health.
[00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:31.060]   They're like, "That's," so this was a big critique
[00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:32.900]   in the early part of the data wars.
[00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:35.060]   You see rises in depression and anxiety
[00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:37.820]   because more people are willing to say,
[00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:40.360]   "I'm anxious," or, "I have depression."
[00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:42.640]   This quote from the New York Times in 2018
[00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:44.380]   is sort of typical of this period.
[00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:46.020]   Here's Richard Friedman writing the Times.
[00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:47.540]   He says, "Look, there are a few surveys
[00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:49.260]   "reporting increased anxiety in adolescents,
[00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.260]   "but they're self-reported measures
[00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:52.440]   "from kids or their parents,
[00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:54.720]   "and they're overestimating rates of discords
[00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:56.340]   "because they're detecting mild symptoms,
[00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:58.720]   "not clinically significant syndromes.
[00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:01.120]   "This was claimed a lot during the early period
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:02.700]   "of the data wars."
[00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:04.420]   So as good science does, it said,
[00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:08.660]   "Well, how can we look into this counter hypothesis?"
[00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:10.940]   And the right way to look into this counter hypothesis
[00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:14.540]   is to say, "Let's find stronger proxies for anxiety
[00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:17.560]   "that have nothing to do with self-reporting."
[00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:19.540]   And in particular, I put two charts on the screen here,
[00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:20.820]   and these are both tragic,
[00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:22.640]   but they also give us deep insight.
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:27.060]   The first chart is US teens admitted to hospitals
[00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:30.660]   for non-fatal self-harm, ages 10 to 14.
[00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:33.320]   This gets around the self-reporting process.
[00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:35.160]   These are people who tried to harm themselves
[00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:37.860]   due to anxiety, and these are from hospital records.
[00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:40.300]   Look at girls.
[00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:45.300]   188% increase between 2010 to 2020,
[00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:50.280]   with the increase getting particularly stark around 2012.
[00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:52.640]   Even more tragically, we look to the right,
[00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:55.660]   we see suicides among US teens.
[00:11:55.660 --> 00:12:00.660]   2012 jumps up, 134% increase among girls
[00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:03.500]   starting around that 2012 point.
[00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:06.380]   So it was a reasonable hypothesis that,
[00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:08.700]   well, maybe around 2012,
[00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:11.780]   we just got more comfortable talking about anxiety,
[00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:14.340]   and we were just picking up mild self-reported symptoms.
[00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:17.180]   Unfortunately, the hospital records show
[00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:19.540]   these indications rose at the exact same rate.
[00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:21.140]   So there really was an increase here.
[00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:23.980]   Kids are, and starting around this period,
[00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:25.500]   having worse mental health.
[00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:28.780]   The second strand of troubling evidence
[00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:31.060]   was the correlational studies.
[00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:33.100]   So social psychologists often will work
[00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:34.740]   with these giant data sets,
[00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:36.660]   these giant data sets where researchers will go out
[00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:38.260]   and talk to tens of thousands of people
[00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.500]   and ask them about everything.
[00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:43.180]   And then after the fact, you can come back as a researcher
[00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:46.660]   and look for all sorts of connections within this data.
[00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:50.260]   If you wanna know if people who like the color red
[00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:51.880]   as their favorite color are more likely
[00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:55.660]   to have had back surgery in the last six months,
[00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:57.220]   you can just go and look at this data
[00:12:57.220 --> 00:13:00.300]   and find those things and look for correlations, et cetera.
[00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:01.140]   So they did this.
[00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:02.460]   They said, "Let's start looking at this data.
[00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:03.700]   "We'll look at young people,
[00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:04.840]   "and we'll look at correlations
[00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:08.820]   "between these technologies and negative outcomes."
[00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:10.840]   And they began to find lots of strong connections.
[00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:12.340]   Here's just one of many, many graphs
[00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:13.980]   that were produced in this period.
[00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:16.940]   This particularly one looked at UK adolescents
[00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:19.640]   with clinically relevant depressive symptoms.
[00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:24.640]   The X-axis is number of hours per weekday on social media.
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:27.340]   The Y-axis is percentage of teens
[00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:28.460]   who used that much social media
[00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:31.420]   that were diagnosed as depressed.
[00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:33.340]   And as you see, when you increase
[00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:36.740]   from no time on social media to five plus hours,
[00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:38.860]   you get a significant increase
[00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:42.940]   in percentage of teens that are depressed.
[00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:45.260]   This is particularly high for girls,
[00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:49.520]   where you go from a 11% depression rate
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:51.480]   for girls who don't use social media
[00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:53.920]   to almost a 40% depression rate
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:57.280]   for girls who use four to five hours of social media.
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:00.300]   All right, so we saw a lot of studies of this type.
[00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:02.420]   This generated critiques.
[00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:03.960]   So other researchers came along and said,
[00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:05.180]   "Yeah, you're finding these correlations,
[00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:08.780]   "but it's easy to find correlations between things.
[00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:10.920]   "The effect sizes are small."
[00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:13.120]   And perhaps the most famous of these papers
[00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:18.120]   was published in 2019 by Przybylski and Amy Orbin.
[00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:20.160]   This is known by researchers in the field
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:23.320]   colloquially as the Potato Study.
[00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:25.320]   They went in and looked at one of these big datasets
[00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:27.420]   and said, and I'll read them here,
[00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:31.320]   the connection is negative but teeny,
[00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:34.440]   indicating a level of harmfulness so close to zero
[00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:36.920]   that it is roughly the same size as they find
[00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:38.400]   for the association of mental health
[00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:41.100]   with eating potatoes or wearing eyeglasses.
[00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:42.480]   So they said, "Look, we looked and found
[00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:46.360]   "these, yeah, you use more digital technology,
[00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:48.480]   "you're less happy, but the effect is the same we found
[00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:50.880]   "for eating potatoes on your happiness
[00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:52.440]   "or wearing eyeglasses on your happiness."
[00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:54.280]   Their point being, these are so small
[00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:55.480]   that they're basically arbitrary.
[00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:57.740]   You're finding artifacts in the data.
[00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:01.420]   This article, the potato article was cited a lot.
[00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:04.940]   Even until very recently, you would see major newspapers
[00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:07.400]   like the New York Times often saying,
[00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:09.100]   because this was very influential,
[00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:12.680]   studies show a potential connection
[00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:16.080]   between these technologies and negative mental health,
[00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:18.080]   but the effects are small.
[00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:20.800]   This is the type of paper that caused that.
[00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:23.960]   So as good science does, we looked at this.
[00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:26.680]   Now here's a response to the potato paper
[00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:29.400]   co-authored by Gene Twenge and John Haidt.
[00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:32.840]   It was published in Nature, Human Behavior,
[00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:36.240]   and it was called Underestimating Digital Media Harm.
[00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:40.720]   In this article, Haidt looked at Przybylski and Orban
[00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:43.280]   and said, "Well, wait a second, wait a second,"
[00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:44.960]   and I'm gonna read his words here.
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:48.960]   "The first issue to note is that the potatoes comparison
[00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:53.160]   "was what they reported for all digital media use,
[00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:55.700]   "not for social media use specifically.
[00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:58.160]   "Digital media includes all screen-based activities,
[00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:00.700]   "including watching TV or Netflix videos with a sibling,
[00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:02.360]   "which are not harmful activities.
[00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:04.260]   "In their own published report,
[00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:07.660]   "when you zoom in on social media only,
[00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:11.240]   "the relationship is between two and six times larger
[00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:13.240]   "than for digital media.
[00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:15.880]   "Also crucial is that Orban and Przybylski
[00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:17.960]   "lumped together all teens, boys and girls,
[00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:19.940]   "while many studies have found that the correlations
[00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:21.600]   "with harm are larger for girls."
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:24.960]   So Haidt is saying it's almost like you're intentionally
[00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:29.480]   trying to reduce the negative impact.
[00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:30.780]   You're only showing the connection
[00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:33.140]   between all possible digital media use
[00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:34.340]   and negative social harms,
[00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:35.960]   even though your dataset you were using
[00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:37.640]   had social media broken out,
[00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:40.380]   and all the discussion has been about social media.
[00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:41.560]   And Haidt and Twenge said,
[00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:43.320]   "So we looked at your same dataset
[00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:44.880]   "and just looked at social media,
[00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:47.140]   "and you had a much, much bigger response,
[00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:48.960]   "a response that, especially if you break out girls,
[00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:50.940]   "was six times worse than eating potatoes,
[00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:53.360]   "a very significant response."
[00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:54.720]   So I say here on the slide,
[00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:57.080]   this is John Haidt being polite,
[00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:00.000]   because when you really read this critique,
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.800]   you're wondering how is there any other explanation
[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:04.980]   for the potato paper other than a set of researchers
[00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:07.360]   who are saying, "We want to report
[00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:09.800]   "there's not really a difference here."
[00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:12.920]   It's otherwise hard to explain why they would
[00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:15.520]   choose what they chose and not talk about
[00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:17.320]   these other aspects to their paper
[00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:18.820]   if they were really just trying to understand
[00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:19.760]   is there harm here.
[00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:23.940]   All right, so let's get to the third act of this story,
[00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:26.520]   this research story on smartphones and kids.
[00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:30.100]   I call this third act, "A Consensus Begins to Emerge."
[00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:32.680]   This covers the period of 2020 to 2023.
[00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:34.080]   So until today.
[00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:36.920]   Essentially what has happened in the past two or three years
[00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:40.240]   is the critiques have largely fallen away,
[00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:43.400]   and a consensus is emerging in the field that yes,
[00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:47.280]   especially for girls, there is a strong negative connection
[00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:49.660]   between these technologies and mental health.
[00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:52.520]   The reason why this consensus emerges,
[00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:55.320]   first of all, the critiques as we talked about before,
[00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:57.240]   the main critiques during the data war
[00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:59.960]   were pretty thoroughly debunked.
[00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:02.220]   After the potato paper, it's not like there was a lot
[00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:03.860]   of more stronger papers that said,
[00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:05.360]   really made a strong case that there wasn't
[00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:06.320]   a strong connection there.
[00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:08.760]   And the timing argument really seems to have been one
[00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:10.560]   for the people who are worried about smartphones.
[00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:12.880]   So that happened, but then what we began to get,
[00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:15.000]   and this is how a lot of emerging literatures
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.760]   begin to coalesce around a consensus,
[00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:20.960]   we began to get multiple other independent sources
[00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:23.760]   of investigation that pointed towards the same conclusion.
[00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:25.840]   When you have multiple different types of threads
[00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:28.080]   that all begin to weave around the same answer,
[00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:30.720]   that's often what happens in complex literatures
[00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:32.300]   that points it towards a conclusion.
[00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:35.020]   And that really began to happen in the last couple of years.
[00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:38.440]   So one of the threads was natural experiments.
[00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:41.280]   Here's a cool paper written by an economist, Elaine Gu.
[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:45.600]   And she looked at, in Canada, I believe,
[00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:47.800]   the arrival of high-speed wireless internet
[00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:50.760]   in a given province from town to town.
[00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:53.480]   When high-speed wireless internet arrived,
[00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:55.480]   heavy social media use became possible.
[00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:56.540]   Then you could have a smartphone
[00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:58.300]   and you could use it on the app.
[00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:01.420]   And so she looked at, if we have nearby towns,
[00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:04.360]   demographically and culturally very similar,
[00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:06.740]   but we end up in this natural experiment situation
[00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:09.100]   where one town gets wireless high-speed internet
[00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:11.100]   before the other, can we compare what's happening
[00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:12.660]   with teenage mental health in these two towns
[00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:14.060]   and see if there's a change?
[00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:15.100]   Yes, there was.
[00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:19.140]   Girl, teen girls, severe mental health diagnoses
[00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:24.100]   increased by 90% when the wireless internet arrived.
[00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:25.980]   So it was a nice, natural experiment.
[00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:28.500]   We also had some direct randomized
[00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:29.660]   control trials experiments.
[00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:32.540]   Here's a good paper by Melissa Hunt et al.
[00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:34.360]   They just took 143 undergraduates
[00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:39.360]   and randomly assigned them to either stop using social media
[00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:41.160]   or keep using it as normal.
[00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:44.700]   So it's a randomized prospective control trial.
[00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:46.020]   What did they find?
[00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:48.220]   The group that was told to limit their social media use
[00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:52.220]   showed significant reductions in loneliness and depression
[00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:55.140]   as compared to the control groups.
[00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:57.340]   So that's interesting.
[00:19:57.340 --> 00:20:02.140]   I think maybe one of the strongest forces
[00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:05.940]   in helping a consensus come together was self-reporting.
[00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:09.100]   Just talking to teenagers themselves.
[00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:12.340]   So when Francis Hagan leaked all of those data
[00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:14.140]   from Meta a couple years ago,
[00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:15.740]   what was known as the Facebook files,
[00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:17.340]   that's what the Wall Street Journal called it,
[00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:20.180]   one of the big interesting findings
[00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:22.320]   in these leaked documents from Meta
[00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:25.660]   was the fact that they had done survey on teens
[00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:27.820]   and had found, and I'm quoting here,
[00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:30.100]   "Teens blame Instagram for increases
[00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:32.140]   "in the rate of anxiety and depression.
[00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:33.500]   "This reaction was unprompted
[00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:35.280]   "and consistent across all groups."
[00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:36.660]   So the teenagers themselves are saying,
[00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:38.780]   yeah, this is why we're more anxious and depressed.
[00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:41.140]   This app, these phones.
[00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:43.460]   Other data began to find the same thing.
[00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:46.580]   I put on the slide, put up here a slide
[00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:48.180]   from research out of Australia.
[00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:49.900]   These are Australian teens.
[00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:51.820]   By far, the number one reason they give
[00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:53.260]   for why they think youth mental health
[00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:54.940]   is getting worse is social media.
[00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:58.340]   I think this was the final smoking gun
[00:20:58.340 --> 00:20:59.940]   is the teens themselves are saying,
[00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:02.140]   this is hurting me.
[00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:03.860]   This is causing a problem.
[00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:07.540]   It is really hard to be a potato study style skeptic
[00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:09.520]   in the face of the teens themselves saying,
[00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:11.260]   yes, this is causing me harm.
[00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:15.060]   We're not teasing out subtle epidemiological effects,
[00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:17.780]   a slight increase in the background cancer rate
[00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:19.760]   for the towns that were using a different type of pipe
[00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:21.700]   in their water, or the individuals themselves
[00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:23.620]   have no way of detecting this change.
[00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:24.480]   This is not that.
[00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:29.020]   This is a huge, loud, self-observable macro signal.
[00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:30.940]   This thing is making me uncomfortable.
[00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:32.380]   That ultimately is the big difference
[00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:35.940]   between this and past moral panics
[00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:37.840]   around youths and technologies.
[00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:40.600]   When my grandparents, let's say they were upset
[00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:42.420]   that my mom was listening to the Beatles
[00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:45.580]   in the late 1960s, if they went to my mom and said,
[00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:46.900]   stop listening to those Beatles,
[00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:48.660]   it's going to warp your mind,
[00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:50.480]   my mom would have said, get out of here.
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:52.140]   What she would not have said is,
[00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:54.920]   I agree, these records are making me
[00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:56.280]   and my friends incredibly anxious.
[00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:59.040]   I wish I didn't have to listen to them.
[00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:00.680]   That would have been a very different situation.
[00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:02.240]   So this is why I think this analogy
[00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:05.560]   to past concerns about youth technology
[00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:06.880]   really begins to fall apart.
[00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:08.760]   Data aside, the teens tell you,
[00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:10.220]   yeah, I know this is making me anxious.
[00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:12.080]   I don't like that I have to be on it.
[00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:15.520]   So why does it do this?
[00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:17.560]   So let's look in particular at social media first,
[00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:19.400]   and then we'll broaden out the smartphones.
[00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:21.360]   Why do researchers think social media
[00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:25.000]   is causing these negative impacts on mental health?
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.620]   There's a few reasons to come up.
[00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:27.880]   One is loneliness.
[00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:30.680]   Now readers of my book, "Digital Minimalism,"
[00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:32.880]   this will sound familiar because I talk about this
[00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:34.240]   in "Digital Minimalism."
[00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:35.920]   It's paradoxical at first,
[00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:39.040]   but using these social technologies more
[00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:42.640]   will actually lead you to feel less social.
[00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:45.280]   And what's going on here is young people
[00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:48.640]   replace in-person interaction with texting
[00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:50.980]   and social media back and forth.
[00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:53.740]   But this purely linguistic communication,
[00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:55.840]   just sending texts back and forth to each other
[00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:58.500]   or commenting on each other's post
[00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:01.520]   is not interpreted by the social circuits of our brain
[00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:02.860]   as being all that social.
[00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:05.240]   There's no voice modulation.
[00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:06.240]   There's no body language.
[00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:07.920]   You're not in the presence of another person
[00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:08.920]   in the same room.
[00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:11.040]   So you're in your room as a 14-year-old
[00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:12.440]   all day on text messages,
[00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:14.360]   and you tell yourself, wow, I'm so social
[00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:16.040]   because all I've been doing is talking to people.
[00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:17.640]   But as far as your brain is concerned,
[00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:18.560]   you're incredibly lonely
[00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:20.520]   because you haven't seen anyone all day.
[00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:23.960]   Social psychologists call this social snacking.
[00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:26.740]   Lightweight, easy, digital socialization.
[00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:28.340]   We do that instead of having the real meal
[00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:29.800]   and we end up more lonely.
[00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:30.980]   We see this in the data.
[00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:33.220]   I have two charts up on the screen now.
[00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:36.020]   One shows loneliness among teenagers.
[00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:39.920]   And you see again, 2012, whoosh, goes right up.
[00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:42.820]   The other chart shows daily average time
[00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:46.740]   spent with friends starting in 2012
[00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:50.060]   for the ages 15 to 24 goes straight down.
[00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:53.220]   More time on the phone
[00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:55.820]   meant less time interacting in person,
[00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:57.620]   meant loneliness went up.
[00:23:57.620 --> 00:23:59.100]   There's an interesting observation, by the way,
[00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:00.520]   that John Haidt makes.
[00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:02.780]   This got underway around 2012,
[00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:06.140]   and it was so pronounced by the time the pandemic came along
[00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:08.020]   that change wasn't even that big.
[00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:09.820]   And we can see this on this chart.
[00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:12.740]   I mean, certainly we continue to have a steep,
[00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:15.460]   we have a steep fall in 2020,
[00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:18.980]   but we were having a steep fall from 2018 to '19 as well.
[00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:21.660]   So he pointed this out in a newsletter article
[00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:23.820]   he wrote earlier this spring.
[00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:27.420]   These effects of isolation were already so pronounced
[00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:29.340]   because of smartphones among American teens
[00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:33.940]   that the difference of adding isolation through lockdowns
[00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:35.460]   actually didn't even make that big of a difference.
[00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:37.220]   We were already on that trajectory.
[00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:40.340]   Another issue here is performativity,
[00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:43.380]   especially with social media, especially with girls.
[00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:45.780]   Let me read something here from Jean Twenge.
[00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:48.060]   Girls use social media more often,
[00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:49.700]   giving them additional opportunities
[00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:51.180]   to feel excluded and lonely
[00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:52.660]   when they see their friends or classmates
[00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:54.700]   getting together without them.
[00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:56.860]   Social media levy a psychic tax
[00:24:56.860 --> 00:24:58.980]   on the teen doing the posting as well,
[00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:01.160]   as she anxiously awaits the affirmation
[00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:03.860]   of comments and likes.
[00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:05.580]   So you're constantly worried about
[00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:06.500]   what other people are doing
[00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:08.080]   and how people are perceiving you.
[00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:09.820]   Combine that with a teenage brain.
[00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:13.800]   Come on, no way that's gonna be positive.
[00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:14.820]   The final thing I wanna mention here
[00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:17.540]   is the amplification of harmful behaviors.
[00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:19.940]   Online communities, for all their good,
[00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:22.020]   also have the dark side of it allows,
[00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:23.800]   especially vulnerable teenagers
[00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:25.200]   who are trying to find themselves
[00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:27.460]   and are open to suggestions and are feeling vulnerable
[00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:29.780]   and full of all these different chemicals.
[00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:33.500]   It's very easy to get caught in online communities
[00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:35.860]   that will then amplify harmful behaviors
[00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:38.100]   that will directly reduce your mental health,
[00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:40.480]   and in a lot of cases, also your physical health.
[00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:43.420]   We're beginning to see more lawsuits along these lines.
[00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:44.740]   I have a headline up here right now
[00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:46.780]   about a family suing Meta
[00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:48.900]   'cause they blame Instagram
[00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:51.760]   for encouraging their daughter's eating disorder
[00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:53.320]   and self-harm.
[00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:54.840]   There's all sorts of cases like this.
[00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:56.940]   So this is another source of this connection
[00:25:56.940 --> 00:26:01.060]   between reduced mental health and social media use
[00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:02.740]   is there's a lot of traps on there.
[00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:04.940]   You end up in a community that is cheering on something
[00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:07.740]   that in the end is gonna make you feel much worse.
[00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:11.920]   All right.
[00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:15.020]   Social media is not the whole story.
[00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:17.100]   A lot of this data is looking at social media.
[00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:19.100]   Some of it's looking at smartphones in general.
[00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:20.220]   I wanna just briefly mention
[00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:23.300]   that even if you aren't using social media on a smartphone,
[00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:24.120]   if you're a teenager,
[00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:25.980]   there's other harms we know are there.
[00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:28.660]   Impeded thinking skills is critical.
[00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:32.200]   I talked about this in a somewhat recent episode
[00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:33.820]   of the podcast.
[00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:36.860]   It's talking about Marianne Wolfe's work
[00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:38.580]   on the development of young minds
[00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:40.300]   when they spend more time on screens.
[00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:44.280]   The short version of this is deep critical thinking skills
[00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:46.020]   require training.
[00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:49.060]   Training requires things like reading analog books
[00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:49.940]   that you struggle with.
[00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:51.460]   You can take time to pause
[00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:54.260]   and make sense of what you just read before moving on.
[00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:56.000]   Training requires self-reflection,
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.100]   the ability to hold thoughts in your working memories
[00:26:58.100 --> 00:26:59.780]   and work on it, having that time alone
[00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:01.620]   and that familiarity with it.
[00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:04.340]   Smartphones get in the way of that training
[00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:07.300]   because it teaches your brain to instead move very quick.
[00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:09.900]   Look like a L-shaped skim
[00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:11.620]   for things that are gonna give you in text
[00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:14.720]   a quick hit of dopamine or excitement.
[00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:16.440]   Flee boredom.
[00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:18.040]   If you have any moments of downtime,
[00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:20.600]   have something right on your screen.
[00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:23.640]   I was watching, Jesse, I was watching this on the flight.
[00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:25.840]   It's not my flight to San Francisco,
[00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:28.320]   it was my flight to Utah a few weeks ago.
[00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:32.880]   I mean, like a 20 year old guy sitting a row up in the aisle.
[00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:34.880]   I was watching him use TikTok.
[00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:35.720]   I mean, it was crazy.
[00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:37.580]   It's like, 'cause he had his phone out.
[00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:39.360]   They'll just be like some weird video.
[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:41.160]   He was watching on average six seconds
[00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:43.200]   and then he'd swipe and another video would come up.
[00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:45.240]   Then he'd swipe and another video would come up.
[00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:46.600]   That's just all he was doing.
[00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:47.440]   - The whole time?
[00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:48.260]   - The whole time.
[00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:49.100]   Well, I don't know, the whole time for a while.
[00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:49.940]   - Yeah.
[00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:51.200]   - And I was watching over his shoulder.
[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:55.120]   Like, man, glad I'm reading my Alan Lightman book
[00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:57.520]   about transcendentalism and the human brain
[00:27:57.520 --> 00:27:58.360]   made me feel good.
[00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:00.000]   But you know, the point is,
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.800]   it's so rewarding in the moment
[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:04.440]   that you don't do the activities
[00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:06.600]   that would otherwise give you critical thinking skills
[00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:08.600]   and so you're just not good at thinking deeply
[00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:10.540]   and that's a huge harm.
[00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:12.560]   Sleep deprivation is a big deal
[00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:14.400]   for teenagers and these smartphones.
[00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:16.440]   Look, you give a 13 year old boy a smartphone,
[00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:18.820]   they're gonna YouTube until four in the morning.
[00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:20.760]   When I gave this talk, someone in the audience said,
[00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:22.440]   there was a lot of middle schoolers there
[00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:24.080]   and one of the middle schoolers was talking about
[00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:26.620]   how all of her friends who have these smartphones
[00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:27.920]   are on them all night.
[00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:30.600]   And then they come in the class, they're completely tired.
[00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:31.460]   They can't function.
[00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:33.520]   They're doing really poorly on their tests,
[00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:34.800]   but they can't help themselves
[00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:37.720]   because if you have this, it's hard to turn it off.
[00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:40.420]   So teenagers are having a huge sleep deprivation issue.
[00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:45.420]   It's YouTube, video games and social media scrolling.
[00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:47.540]   Solitude deprivation is another issue.
[00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:50.220]   I talked about this in digital minimalism as well.
[00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:53.260]   Our mind is not meant to constantly be processing
[00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:55.520]   information generated by another mind.
[00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:57.900]   We need time alone with our own thoughts to recharge
[00:28:57.900 --> 00:29:00.020]   and to make sense of our world.
[00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:03.220]   Smartphones can eliminate that entirely from your existence
[00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:06.040]   because any moment where before you might've just been alone
[00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:09.900]   with your own thoughts, you can now pull out the thing.
[00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:11.260]   Over time that makes us anxious.
[00:29:11.260 --> 00:29:14.420]   It also harms self-development at an age where we need it.
[00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:16.940]   14, you're trying to figure yourself out.
[00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:18.180]   You're 15, you're trying to figure yourself out.
[00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:20.460]   You need time alone with your own thoughts.
[00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:21.460]   Your brain needs it.
[00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:24.900]   And finally, we have this issue that smartphones in general
[00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:27.240]   minimize quality leisure.
[00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:28.980]   So the thing you're doing on the phone gets in the way
[00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:30.980]   of the things you should be doing.
[00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:33.060]   It gets in way of the things that's gonna be more meaningful
[00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:35.020]   or quality or sustainable or connect you more
[00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:37.180]   to your friends or your community or build skills
[00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:38.180]   or give you confidence.
[00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:42.200]   It's easier just to look at the phone and to watch Twitch.
[00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:45.980]   And so it gets in the way of something that could be better.
[00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:47.780]   This is often missed when we think about smartphones
[00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:51.100]   and teens will hone in on the exact activity and say,
[00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:52.980]   well, my son isn't on social media.
[00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:54.220]   He's not doing performativity.
[00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:56.460]   He doesn't have to worry about online bullying.
[00:29:56.460 --> 00:29:58.500]   The thing he's looking at is really harmless.
[00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:01.340]   In fact, maybe there's like some science content in it.
[00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:03.540]   The issue there is not that what he's looking at
[00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:05.560]   is a problem, is that because he's looking at it all day,
[00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:07.420]   he's not doing the things to be good.
[00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:11.380]   So we've got harms with unrestricted smartphone access
[00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:13.740]   for young people that go beyond just the specific stuff
[00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:16.000]   that social media can do.
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.840]   All right, so where is this all headed?
[00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:22.440]   At the national scale, it's an interesting question.
[00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:26.420]   Is there gonna be some sort of legislative shift
[00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:27.980]   that's gonna come out of this data
[00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:29.460]   now that the consensus has emerged?
[00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:34.460]   It's clear that this consensus has been understood
[00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:37.860]   and intaked by legislative bodies and policy makers.
[00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:42.500]   I think it's now accepted that unrestricted smartphone use,
[00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:44.500]   especially for prepubescent kids,
[00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:48.300]   especially for prepubescent girls is very dangerous.
[00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:50.060]   I think this has all been accepted now.
[00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:51.180]   So where's this gonna head?
[00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:52.940]   I'm not quite sure,
[00:30:52.940 --> 00:30:54.980]   but here's one thing I would keep an eye on.
[00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:57.980]   Here's the Surgeon General earlier this year.
[00:30:57.980 --> 00:31:00.500]   He said, "Wait until your kids are 16
[00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:02.420]   "to let them use social media."
[00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:04.900]   This conclusion, I think,
[00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:07.260]   is something that a lot of researchers are coming to.
[00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:08.580]   I talked to John Haidt about this,
[00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:10.940]   and he agreed with that as well.
[00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:13.020]   If you've made it through puberty,
[00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:14.800]   the development as an individual,
[00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:16.260]   as well as the social development
[00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:17.680]   and everything that happens during that period,
[00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:19.960]   if you've made it through all of that
[00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:21.700]   before you then get unrestricted access
[00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:23.860]   to the internet and social media,
[00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:26.760]   you're in a much better position to succeed
[00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:28.820]   because you know who you are, who your friends are,
[00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:30.560]   what you're interested in, what you're about.
[00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:31.980]   You've done all that work.
[00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:34.580]   And now if you get exposed to this,
[00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:36.940]   it's gonna have a much less negative impact
[00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:40.660]   than if you get it at 12 or you get it at 13.
[00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:42.020]   So if you can wait till 16,
[00:31:42.020 --> 00:31:44.020]   this seems to be an emerging consensus.
[00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:46.420]   This might possibly be made into legislation.
[00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:48.180]   One of the relevant things to keep an eye on here
[00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:51.380]   is the 1998 Children's Online Privacy Protection Act,
[00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:52.360]   or COPA.
[00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:58.460]   This act implicitly already encodes 13
[00:31:58.460 --> 00:32:00.340]   as the minimum age that you can sign up
[00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:01.980]   for a social media service.
[00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:03.460]   Now, of course, these social media services
[00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:04.820]   didn't exist in 1998.
[00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:07.780]   The actual wording here is 13 is the minimum age
[00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:10.980]   at which you can consent to give up your data privacy,
[00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:13.640]   which of course you do when you sign up
[00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:17.180]   for an attention economy platform like social media.
[00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:19.640]   The original version of this act had 16 in there.
[00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:24.300]   Tech lobbyists in DC got that pushed down to 13.
[00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:26.560]   There's calls now to amend it back to 16.
[00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:28.780]   So that could happen.
[00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:31.940]   There's other legislative avenues that are being pursued.
[00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:35.540]   It's tricky, but this is one to keep an eye on.
[00:32:35.540 --> 00:32:37.340]   What would happen if that law was changed?
[00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:41.540]   It's not that this would make it really hard
[00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:42.720]   for individual young people
[00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:44.420]   to get access to social media, right?
[00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:46.260]   It's not super enforceable,
[00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:51.020]   but what it would give is a metaphorical chair
[00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:53.940]   to parents that are trying to tame this metaphorical lion.
[00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:55.860]   When you have your 13-year-old again and again saying,
[00:32:55.860 --> 00:32:56.860]   "All my friends have this.
[00:32:56.860 --> 00:32:57.700]   "I want this.
[00:32:57.700 --> 00:32:58.520]   "Why can't I have it?
[00:32:58.520 --> 00:32:59.360]   "All my friends have this.
[00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:00.200]   "I want it.
[00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:01.020]   "Why can't I have it?"
[00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:01.860]   For the parent to be able to say,
[00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:05.980]   "Because it's illegal," is a very strong defense.
[00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:08.420]   And you're not putting these parents in a situation
[00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:10.100]   of having to be social psychology researchers
[00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:10.980]   and understand this literature.
[00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:11.820]   They can say, "It's against the law.
[00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:13.220]   "I'm not gonna break the law.
[00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:15.860]   "You'll just have to learn not to have those friends,
[00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:16.700]   "I guess."
[00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:18.880]   I mean, it would be helpful.
[00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:21.400]   So something like that may happen.
[00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:23.820]   Now, what do I conclude from all of this?
[00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:28.240]   I mean, to me, I would say that 16 age limit
[00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:29.260]   is a smart one.
[00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:32.780]   I think this is good.
[00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:35.100]   I think the data is pointing towards your safest bet,
[00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:37.340]   especially if we're talking about young girls,
[00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:42.340]   is 16 is the age below which you do not want to give a child
[00:33:42.340 --> 00:33:46.140]   unrestricted access to the internet.
[00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:47.660]   If you give a young person a smartphone,
[00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:49.900]   you are giving them unrestricted access to the internet.
[00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:52.120]   You can do some parental controls, they'll get around them.
[00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:53.740]   They're better at it than you.
[00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:56.380]   This is the thing about kids, right?
[00:33:56.380 --> 00:34:01.040]   If we ever went to war, cyber war with China,
[00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:03.840]   and we needed in a sort of ender's game style,
[00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:05.720]   brilliant kids that like help save us,
[00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:08.380]   here's how we would win the cyber hacking war.
[00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:09.960]   Just tell a bunch of 13 year olds
[00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:12.980]   that if you bring down China's whatever infrastructure,
[00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:16.360]   you will get unlimited access to Mr. Beast videos.
[00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:21.360]   Because these kids become Dennis Nidry style hackers
[00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:24.280]   when it comes to trying to get access to these things.
[00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:27.020]   The same kids that can't even motivate themselves
[00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:28.000]   to take the garbage out.
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.440]   If they think they can access YouTube
[00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:30.960]   on their school's Chromebook,
[00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:32.720]   they're in there with soldering irons.
[00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:36.000]   You know, all right, I'm bypassing the main CPU logic here
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.420]   and I'm hacking the main security grid
[00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:41.200]   by getting right to the op code lookup table in the ROM.
[00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:43.960]   They become expert computer hackers
[00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:46.480]   if there's a video game they can access
[00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:49.320]   or Snapchat lays just beyond those protections.
[00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:50.440]   So you give a smartphone to a kid,
[00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:52.280]   you're giving them unrestricted internet access.
[00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:53.460]   You give them unrestricted internet access,
[00:34:53.460 --> 00:34:55.260]   they can use social media.
[00:34:55.260 --> 00:34:56.640]   Even the definition of social media
[00:34:56.640 --> 00:34:58.300]   is getting a little bit hazy now.
[00:34:58.300 --> 00:35:00.360]   A lot of the actual performative socialization
[00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:03.320]   has shifted from social media onto group text messages.
[00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:06.000]   So it gets a little bit, it gets a little bit hazy.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.160]   And we have all these other harms
[00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:08.400]   that surround the smartphones,
[00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:10.320]   the sleep deprivation, the solitude deprivation.
[00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:13.880]   So it really seems like 16 is the safe time to say,
[00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:14.960]   okay, you can just have a phone
[00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:18.200]   and I'm not gonna care too much what you're doing anymore.
[00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:20.700]   Does that mean that's the only age
[00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:22.640]   where you can have any type of device like this?
[00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:24.800]   Well, again, I actually asked John Heid about this as well.
[00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:29.640]   And his thought was, when you functionally need a phone,
[00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:30.920]   okay, because I don't know,
[00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:32.640]   I'm commuting to school on the city buses
[00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:34.500]   like a lot of kids do at my kid's school.
[00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:37.440]   And you need an ability to maybe text your parents
[00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:39.080]   if there's an emergency or call your parents
[00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:41.120]   if the bus routes cancel or something like that.
[00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:42.800]   When they functionally need a phone,
[00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:45.240]   you can get them a phone that doesn't have internet.
[00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:48.880]   So when you get to an age where I'm independent enough
[00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:51.000]   that having communication ability with me
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.200]   is gonna enable this independence,
[00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:55.780]   then get them some sort of communication device,
[00:35:55.780 --> 00:35:57.540]   but one without internet.
[00:35:57.540 --> 00:35:59.860]   16 is when you can give them a smartphone that has everything
[00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:01.700]   that seems to be the emerging consensus.
[00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:03.160]   I think five to 10 years from now,
[00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:04.960]   that will just be accepted.
[00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:07.080]   If you have a child right now
[00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:09.060]   and your oldest child is two,
[00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:10.420]   you're not gonna have to think about this
[00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:13.580]   when they become 12, the cultural have shifted.
[00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:16.120]   You won't be giving an iPhone to your 12 year old,
[00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:17.240]   that will just be accepted.
[00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:20.880]   We're right now in this intermediate transition period
[00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:22.440]   where parents still have to make these decisions
[00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:23.800]   on their own.
[00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:27.520]   As far as I can tell, that's my best read of the literature.
[00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:29.120]   When it becomes, they're independent enough
[00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:30.320]   to functionally communication,
[00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:32.800]   give them a phone like a light phone, which looks great
[00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:34.700]   and can text well, but has no internet.
[00:36:34.700 --> 00:36:36.640]   Wait till 16 to give them unrestricted access
[00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:38.480]   so you can't have your own iPad or your own smartphone
[00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:40.020]   till you're 16.
[00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:42.760]   They will yell and gnash their teeth, but come on.
[00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:43.920]   Everything in the history of the world
[00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:46.060]   that teenagers have wanted that their parents don't want,
[00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:48.000]   the teenagers have said, all my friends are doing it,
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:49.480]   you have to give it to me.
[00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:51.080]   This is not necessarily different.
[00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:52.740]   So I think that's where we're heading.
[00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:54.720]   Obviously there's lots of caveats here.
[00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:56.320]   Some kids have a much easier experience
[00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:58.240]   with these technologies than others.
[00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:01.360]   Parents clearly know their own kids.
[00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:05.040]   The one thing I'll also point out is I've heard before
[00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:07.560]   when I've been on the road or talked about my book
[00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:12.560]   is often sort of socially elite people have the storyline
[00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:17.320]   that less socially elite or less economically elite people
[00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:23.600]   need these technologies and it's somehow classist
[00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:26.560]   to talk about this, that somehow having a 14 year old
[00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:28.680]   not use a smartphone is like a yoga thing.
[00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:29.520]   It's like a luxury thing.
[00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:32.520]   And I can say, having worked with lots of different groups
[00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:35.900]   from lots of different backgrounds on this issue,
[00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:38.320]   they would say nonsense to that.
[00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:40.280]   Everyone is worried about the kids with this.
[00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:41.280]   Kids are worried about this
[00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:42.540]   in all sorts of different backgrounds,
[00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:44.040]   all sorts of different economic classes.
[00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:46.120]   So I don't think this is a yoga issue.
[00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:48.620]   It's just like a teen smoking issue.
[00:37:48.620 --> 00:37:50.300]   No teen should smoke.
[00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:52.240]   So we said you should wait till you're 18 to do it.
[00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:55.320]   I think it's closer to that than it is to,
[00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:57.400]   it would be nice to do meditation
[00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:59.320]   if you have the time for it.
[00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:00.720]   So we'll see.
[00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:03.440]   But Jesse, that seems to be where the data is right now.
[00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:04.920]   And it looks like the policy makers
[00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:06.440]   are trying to get behind that.
[00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:08.080]   So we're getting close to a point where parents
[00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:09.140]   aren't gonna have to figure this all out
[00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:09.980]   on their own anymore.
[00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:11.320]   There'll be some more of these consensuses.
[00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:14.680]   But I think that like you're 12, here's your smartphone,
[00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:17.220]   give us another five years.
[00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:18.520]   That's gonna be considered something,
[00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:20.080]   ooh, wow, don't do that.
[00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:23.480]   - So will they still go on social media on their desktop?
[00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:26.600]   - Well, yeah, but desktops are controlled.
[00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:28.900]   Here's the family laptop, you use it in the kitchen,
[00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:30.720]   I can see what you're doing.
[00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:31.920]   Much different situation.
[00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:33.840]   I mean, there's a lot of great stuff to do on the internet,
[00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:36.240]   but doing it through the family laptop,
[00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:40.260]   you know, like we know a kid who's really into sports.
[00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:42.160]   And so their family got them a subscription
[00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:43.120]   to the athletic.
[00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:43.940]   Like, this is great.
[00:38:43.940 --> 00:38:46.320]   Like if I was really into sports and I was 13,
[00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:47.160]   to be able to,
[00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:48.880]   one of the activities I was able to do
[00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:50.280]   was like to go on the family computer
[00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:51.840]   and get super in-depth sports coverage.
[00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:52.680]   That's great.
[00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:54.240]   It's feeding an interest that the kid really has.
[00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:55.540]   You know, another kid who's really into chess
[00:38:55.540 --> 00:38:58.120]   and they can do, you know, these chess games online.
[00:38:58.120 --> 00:38:58.960]   All that's great.
[00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:00.780]   But if all that's done through the family computer,
[00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:02.240]   it's like watching TV.
[00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:04.320]   You can't watch TV all the time, right?
[00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:05.720]   The parents say, no TV now,
[00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:07.100]   the TV is in the living room, they're in charge of it.
[00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:08.960]   But you're gonna watch a fair amount of TV and it's nice.
[00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:10.060]   And like, that's what the internet should be
[00:39:10.060 --> 00:39:10.900]   for a 13 year old.
[00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:14.320]   There's all these cool things on here that you can do,
[00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:16.040]   just like there's cool TV shows you could watch,
[00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:19.280]   but you can do them during times when it's appropriate
[00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:21.000]   on a machine where we kind of see what's going on.
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:22.340]   - Yep.
[00:39:22.340 --> 00:39:24.000]   And even if they have school issued laptops
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:25.360]   that like some of the private schools around here,
[00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:27.140]   there's probably some controls on that as well.
[00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:28.360]   - Yeah, they all get around them.
[00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:29.200]   - Yeah.
[00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:30.020]   - They all get around them.
[00:39:30.020 --> 00:39:31.600]   Yeah, the school, it's funny.
[00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:34.840]   We had a six, one of the neighbors who's always over,
[00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:39.160]   one of the neighbors is I think seven, maybe eight,
[00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:41.060]   hacked into YouTube on the Chromebook.
[00:39:41.060 --> 00:39:44.280]   I'm telling you, these kids
[00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:48.440]   that'll like stare at you for an hour
[00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:50.880]   if you ask them to do a fraction,
[00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:53.200]   if they could get access to YouTube,
[00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:57.080]   they are building a quantum processor
[00:39:57.080 --> 00:40:00.640]   to break the encryption based on whatever.
[00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:05.240]   But like good news, I have a 128 qubit quantum processor
[00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:08.580]   I packed together in the playground
[00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:11.160]   and we're able to break the public key encryption
[00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:14.880]   that was keeping us out of Mark Rober videos.
[00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:15.880]   They become hackers.
[00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:18.200]   Anyways, all right.
[00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:19.640]   So that's some thoughts.
[00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:22.200]   That's where I think the research lies right now.
[00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:24.920]   I think that's where we're roughly heading.
[00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:27.500]   (upbeat music)
[00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:28.940]   (upbeat music)
