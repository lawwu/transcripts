[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.020]   What are the core mechanics of value-based decision making as it relates to outcomes
[00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:10.020]   and time?
[00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:11.020]   Yeah.
[00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:16.180]   So we – I think we understand this system pretty well at this point.
[00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.180]   So the last 25, 30 years have been enormously productive.
[00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.660]   So we have a good sketch of the circuitry that does this and essentially what happens
[00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.680]   is you're confronting a situation and it doesn't really matter whether – it seems
[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.120]   to be the same process, no matter whether you're trying to decide between eating a
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:37.960]   donut or an apple or buying this house versus renting an apartment or marrying this person,
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.440]   you know, proposing or not.
[00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.400]   It's sort of all the same system.
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:49.680]   And what happens is you come to the situation and your brain takes in evidence about the
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.720]   alternatives.
[00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.320]   What are the options that are available to me?
[00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.560]   What do I know about them from their stimulus properties and from, you know, maybe prior
[00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.880]   encounters or just other information?
[00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:05.320]   And it takes that evidence and it weighs it against stored information about things you'd
[00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.040]   done in the past, other decisions you'd made, and then begins to assign value, computes
[00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:16.680]   the expected value of those different options in terms of what it will return to you.
[00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:23.840]   And then essentially that is the basis along which that decision gets made.
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:30.520]   So it's, you know, it's a soft max function as we say, so it's not like a hard deterministic
[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:31.520]   one.
[00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.040]   So there's some statistical noise in there for some, you know, we could talk about what
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.440]   that reason might be.
[00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.160]   You make a choice and whenever you make a choice in any behavior that you're engaging
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:46.160]   in, your brain is making a forecast of what's going to happen next as a result of that.
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:52.520]   And your brain then determines, computes, that things go exactly as predicted, right?
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.200]   Is it better than predicted or is it worse than predicted?
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.640]   And then that signal gets fed back into the system to update it so that it hopefully performs
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.800]   that job better in the future, right?
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.040]   So like, "Oh, actually that was—it went way better than expected.
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:12.280]   You should assign that a higher value and do that thing."
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.160]   And this process of weighing up the evidence takes time.
[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.800]   And that's why we have this speed-accuracy trade-off in decision-making where we observe
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.160]   that the faster you go, the more mistakes you tend to make.
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.160]   Been there.
[00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.160]   Exactly.
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.120]   We've all made split-second decisions that we regretted later.
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.160]   Oh, yeah.
[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.160]   Or slightly sleep-deprived.
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.560]   Sleep-deprived, exactly.
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.920]   The more time you take, the more evidence you can accumulate.
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.920]   And when you have to recognize that the data your brain is taking in from the environment
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.720]   is noisy, right?
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:48.720]   It's not perfect.
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.680]   It's noisy because of the environment.
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:56.520]   It's noisy because the wetware of the brain is statistical and biological.
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:03.520]   So you can make the wrong choice by virtue of the noise dominating the signal.
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.320]   And that happens when you go too quickly, right?
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.520]   And one of the things that's – so there's a good mantra from that, which is if you want
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.720]   to make really good decisions or if it's really important, you kind of have to decide
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.160]   ahead of time, like, "Do I need to be accurate or do I need to be fast?"
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.240]   And if accuracy is important, you need to slow down.
[00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.240]   Take your time.
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:29.300]   Take as much time as needed to get the most information that you can.
[00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:36.500]   And even in the moment that doing, like, simple strategies like breathing or having, you know,
[00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.020]   a mantra that says, like, you know, it's not what matters – you know, every little
[00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.160]   decision is not what counts, but it's the long run.
[00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.400]   That helps to turn – we've talked about arousal a lot here.
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.400]   And that turns down arousal.
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.460]   One of the things you think of arousal as doing when you keep talking about volume knobs,
[00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:57.980]   it's like a volume knob for the stuff that's coming into your brain that could be signal
[00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.380]   or noise.
[00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.620]   So it can turn up noise too.
[00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:09.540]   So you could count as evidence toward the value of an option something that is not actually,
[00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.420]   you know, evidence, and then you make the wrong decision.
[00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:20.900]   So by turning down arousal, slowing down, you're relying more on evidence than on noise.
[00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.260]   Does increasing arousal increase the likelihood of false positives, that is, thinking something
[00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:31.020]   is there that's not, generally speaking, as well as false negatives, you know, thinking
[00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.300]   that something's absent when actually it's present?
[00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:39.900]   I haven't thought about it that way before, but it seems to me like that's – yeah,
[00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.620]   that seems consistent with my understanding.
[00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:48.180]   Just by way of example, one of the things that's been really different for me in the
[00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:55.780]   last few years is how quickly you move to publication when you podcast or when you're
[00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:01.260]   doing social media, you just click, it's out in the world versus, you know, the way
[00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.180]   I was weaned was, you know, spend two, three, four years on a project.
[00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.460]   Maybe it doesn't go anywhere, maybe it does, goes to multiple papers, gets reviewed.
[00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:13.260]   So by the time it comes out, you know, it's been proofread and you've read the proof.
[00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:19.420]   So it's been vetted by a number of hopefully expert sources, usually really good sources
[00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:25.780]   of feedback, as opposed to nowadays where you can just kind of move immediately to publication.
[00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:32.300]   And I used to have this saying, which was in the lab, because sometimes, you know, you
[00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.140]   have two months to do a revision or something, it's never really two months, it always
[00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:41.100]   takes five times as long, I used to say, "I go as fast as I carefully can," and I used
[00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:44.380]   to tell my students in postdocs that, "We go as fast as we carefully can because the
[00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:48.100]   moment you start going fast, you start making mistakes, you start making mistakes, you definitely
[00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:49.100]   pay for it later."
[00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:53.580]   And the mistakes that I've made podcasting were a product of going fast and/or fatigue
[00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:57.940]   and the two things kind of relate to one another.
[00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:02.020]   Or occasionally somebody will highlight conflicting evidence and then nowadays you can go back
[00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:08.220]   and repair things with AI, you can, you know, you put things in, but I feel like so much
[00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:14.100]   of life in terms of decision-making is trying to make decisions when most of the time we
[00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:18.580]   think we don't have more time, but most of the time we do have more time, unless somebody's
[00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:21.740]   hemorrhaging, we usually have more time.
[00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:27.120]   But then there are some real things where we don't always have more time, I mean, we
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:32.980]   are biological aging machines and there is such a thing as too late.
[00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:39.660]   So how do you think these systems change as a function of, you know, playing a game for
[00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:45.620]   some money in the lab or we can get caught up in it, but there's this like tremendous
[00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:50.100]   backdrop of context, you know, $100 might be fun for one person, might be the difference
[00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:54.660]   between making rent and not making rent for another person.
[00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:58.900]   You know, the decision to stay in a relationship or leave a relationship when you're in your
[00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:05.540]   teens or 20s is fundamentally different than when somebody's, for instance, near the transition
[00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:08.660]   zone of having versus losing their fertility.
[00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:14.820]   I mean, these are like, yeah, and those change all sorts of, these pressures are so real
[00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:19.340]   and yet if we only have one system in the brain that handles this similarly to the reward
[00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:29.020]   system, it seems like we ought to learn in school how to, like, work with and update
[00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:34.540]   our decision-making process based on immediate term, short term, like all the different timescales.
[00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:37.500]   To be able to do that seems really important.
[00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:39.220]   Are there any ways to train that up?
[00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:45.580]   Yeah, I think it's a, so there's a few things in here that I think are worth unpacking.
[00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:52.540]   I mean, one is what you brought up about fatigue, which I think is really critical.
[00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:56.620]   We did some work with the wrestling team at Penn.
[00:07:56.620 --> 00:08:00.540]   Coach came to us, and I had had a few of the wrestlers working in my lab, and he said,
[00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:04.540]   you know, we're having this problem, which is that, and I don't know if you've ever wrestled,
[00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:06.580]   I wrestled, my middle son...
[00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:07.580]   One match.
[00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:09.020]   It's the worst six minutes of your life.
[00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:12.060]   Well, I didn't quit because I lost that match, and I did lose that match, it was seventh
[00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:13.060]   grade.
[00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:18.940]   I didn't quit because my dad gave me a choice, I could either continue to wrestle or I could
[00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:21.820]   play this other sport that I really wanted to play.
[00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:26.500]   He said you can't do both because it was going to impact my grades negatively, and so I opted
[00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:28.120]   for the other sport.
[00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:29.120]   What was the other sport?
[00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:30.120]   Soccer.
[00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:31.120]   Okay.
[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:32.120]   Yeah.
[00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:33.120]   Okay.
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:34.120]   Yeah.
[00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:35.120]   And it just, yeah.
[00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:36.120]   And I love soccer.
[00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:37.120]   Yeah.
[00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:38.120]   And, but, you know, losing that one wrestling match was informative.
[00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:42.060]   The guy just dead fished on me the whole time, and he deserved to win, like, it was a really
[00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:43.060]   good strategy.
[00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:44.060]   He just, like, dead fished on me.
[00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:45.060]   Plopped on top of you.
[00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:46.060]   Yeah.
[00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:47.860]   You know, and I, like, couldn't gum me out of there.
[00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:50.660]   But it is the worst six minutes of your life.
[00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:53.300]   You're exhausted within, like, 30 seconds.
[00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:54.300]   Yeah.
[00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:55.300]   It's incredibly grueling.
[00:08:55.300 --> 00:09:02.060]   And what the coach observed was that their guys, it was the men's wrestling team, was
[00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:05.420]   they were performing very well in the first two periods, and they got to the third period
[00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:08.940]   and they start making really dumb mistakes, bad decisions.
[00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:11.180]   And so we, so he said, "What's going on?"
[00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:14.180]   I said, "Well, it's about the speed accuracy trade-off, but we have to investigate how
[00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:16.580]   it's related to fatigue."
[00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:18.900]   So what we did, this was a really fun experiment.
[00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:22.100]   So we go to the wrestling room and we wire these guys up.
[00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:25.580]   They got wearable EEG, heart rate monitors, the whole nine yards.
[00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:30.940]   And what we do, we gave them, like, this simple little decision-making/impulse control task.
[00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:32.900]   It's just, like, a controlled response task.
[00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:34.860]   Here's a, you know, a trade-off.
[00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:37.680]   If you go too fast and you make mistakes, okay?
[00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:40.380]   So it's like, there's, it's like a go/no-go.
[00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:42.260]   And so they do it.
[00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:46.140]   Then we run them through two minutes of CrossFit exercises, really brutal.
[00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:47.980]   Then they come back off and they have to do the same thing again.
[00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:50.020]   And we do that three times and then they have to wrestle each other.
[00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:51.740]   - Oh, so it's cognitive and physical.
[00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:52.740]   - Yeah, cognitive and physical.
[00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:54.700]   - Not on, like, chess boxing, which is not a sport I recommend.
[00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:55.700]   Have you seen this?
[00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:56.700]   - I have.
[00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:59.980]   - Where they play around, they play some chess and then they literally fight and then they,
[00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:00.980]   it's crazy.
[00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:02.820]   It's like switching between these two very different states of mind.
[00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:05.820]   - Yeah, it's insane, but also somehow really appealing, you know?
[00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:07.800]   It's like- - Well, I think for the neuroscientist in
[00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:11.700]   you and me, and I think we're all neuroscientists to some extent, we want to understand the
[00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:13.260]   brain in ourselves.
[00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:21.500]   This notion of very disparate behaviors, boxing and playing chess, being associated with very
[00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:28.740]   disparate sort of types of arousal and how those map onto one another, I think is interesting.
[00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:37.760]   - I think the confluence of chess boxing is fencing, which is very much like chess.
[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:40.340]   My youngest son fenced for a number of years.
[00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:43.940]   And so mentally it's like that, but it has the physicality.
[00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:44.940]   - Or jiu-jitsu.
[00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:48.140]   My friends who do Brazilian jiu-jitsu tell me that it's like, there's an infinite number
[00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:54.540]   of options that become constrained in certain dynamics and yeah, very similar.
[00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:59.860]   So this was really cool because what we found was that speed-accuracy trade-off, the more
[00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:07.700]   fatigue they got, the more calories they spent, the faster they would slide down to emphasizing
[00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:08.900]   speed over accuracy.
[00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:13.020]   They just started like, just got to get done.
[00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:14.020]   Just got to get...
[00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:19.140]   I don't know what they were feeling, but that they were just not deliberating, not really
[00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:20.140]   being focused.
[00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:23.780]   They just lost the capability of doing that.
[00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:28.660]   And aside from, like you say, well, we could help you guys, you could become more physically
[00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:29.660]   fit.
[00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:32.260]   Maybe you wouldn't fatigue as fast, but they're about as fit as they could be.
[00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.340]   We said, well, why don't we do this?
[00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:39.380]   Why don't we offload the decision in the third period to the coach?
[00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:45.780]   As soon as you, in the third period, you're going to just look at the coach at some cadence
[00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:49.820]   or whenever he's going to yell at you to look and you do what the coach tells you.
[00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:53.900]   So I think this is really interesting because you think about it in like other contexts,
[00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:55.740]   like in a business context or something.
[00:11:55.740 --> 00:12:00.380]   When if somebody is really fatigued or your unit's fatigued, maybe you have an external
[00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:09.420]   person then who takes over making the decision that you just execute in a sense, right?
[00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:12.820]   The other thing I wanted to say about this all too, which I think it's to your point
[00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:16.420]   about, well, in the lab, it's like, you know, it's one thing.
[00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:22.540]   You've got an undergraduate gambling for 10 bucks over an hour and how well does that
[00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:25.780]   map on to the real world where there are all these other things going on?
[00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:29.620]   And I think that that's the challenge.
[00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:34.380]   When I teach business school or in classes, MBA students or executives and through exec
[00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:39.900]   ed, they all want to know like, give me the five-step formula.
[00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:41.940]   It's like, that's supposed to apply.
[00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:46.220]   How do I take into all-- and it's like, well, we mostly know about one-- this dimension
[00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:50.740]   or that dimension or that dimension and not how in the real world, you know, in a real
[00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:54.740]   complex environment to put that all together.
[00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:56.860]   So that is a-- I think that's a gap.
[00:12:56.860 --> 00:13:02.700]   That's a-- and one that we're trying to fill, which is to study decision making, whether
[00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:07.260]   it's individual or collective decision making in real world environments, right, to where
[00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:14.700]   all of these factors, you know, context and the various priorities that are coming in
[00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:18.060]   are more, you know, more natural, they're not controlled.
[00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:23.420]   And how then-- I mean, we think we know how that works, but we haven't really proven it
[00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:23.820]   yet.
