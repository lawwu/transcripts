[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.200]   Let's just make sure.
[00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:07.400]   There's always a 20-second delay where
[00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.360]   I'm freaking out if I miss the setting or something.
[00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:17.680]   Awesome, we're live.
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:18.360]   Hey, everybody.
[00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.320]   This is a surprise announcement.
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.640]   As you can see, we are with the legend, Hedzo Tales,
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.480]   the legendary Tattletail master, all of our heroes
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.920]   for storytelling, data analysis, and many more things,
[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.360]   if I just keep talking about that,
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.840]   it'll take me an hour, which it did,
[00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.600]   because I've already interviewed--
[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.480]   I've had the opportunity to interview him
[00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:38.680]   on "Chai Time Data Science."
[00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.360]   I won't go into that.
[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.920]   We're here to talk about the Kaggle Hidden Gems
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.600]   competition, which Martin will be telling us more about.
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.120]   And I'm also curious to ask a few questions around that.
[00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.280]   So I'll ask Martin to please share
[00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.400]   why are we doing a competition, and why have you been doing
[00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.960]   the Hidden Gems for so long?
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:00:59.880]   Thank you, Sania.
[00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:00.400]   Thank you.
[00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.760]   Thank you so much for having me.
[00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.560]   This is very, very exciting.
[00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.520]   This is kind of the first time I'm doing an event like this.
[00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.680]   And it's just amazing, all around amazing.
[00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.440]   So the background is that I have been doing this weekly series
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.040]   of Hidden Gems for a good two years now.
[00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.720]   And every week, I pick three notebooks
[00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.280]   out of the large set of notebooks
[00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.720]   that are being published every day on Kaggle,
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:30.960]   every week on Kaggle.
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.280]   And because there are so many people on Kaggle,
[00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.920]   such a large community now, we're
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.640]   coming up to 10 million registered users, which is a lot.
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.520]   And not all the notebooks get the attention
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.920]   that they deserve.
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.040]   Not all the notebooks get the views, the feedback
[00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.920]   from the community, and the upvotes
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.120]   that their quality would deserve.
[00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.640]   And I'm trying my little bit to rectify that situation.
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.680]   So I'm going through the notebooks on Kaggle,
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.400]   and I'm picking three notebooks every week, which
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:10.920]   I think are underrated, which have one or several aspects
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.200]   of quality, like narration or great data visualizations,
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.520]   interesting insights, new angles, new ideas.
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.120]   And I'm trying to highlight those in my weekly posts.
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.560]   And I'm trying to get those notebooks and those authors
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.560]   the attention that they deserve.
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.880]   And I've been quite happy, I think, with the way it went.
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.840]   So I started it pretty much out of a whim about two years ago.
[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.080]   And I was publishing one episode every week
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.440]   without fail, which wasn't always easy.
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.360]   But it worked.
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.760]   So we're at 100 episodes today.
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.320]   Today, the 100th episode of Hidden Gem
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.760]   was published, which means 300 notebooks in total.
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.240]   And that's a very interesting data set overall
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.080]   that I want people to look at and to study
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.200]   in this kind of meta take on Kaggle and the Kaggle
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.520]   community in this notebooks competition.
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.400]   May I ask you--
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.480]   you're, of course, very knowledgeable and I'm sure very
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:13.960]   busy.
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:18.840]   Why are you spending so much time just for the community?
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.000]   I know it's a sillier job doing the podcast,
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.720]   but the consistency really tends to be annoying.
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.640]   And you have to do it over some time
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.600]   because you have to commit to it and then see it through.
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.760]   So what made you keep doing it for so long?
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.760]   Well, I could ask the same question to you, right?
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.840]   Why do you keep doing the things that you're doing?
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.560]   And I'd be interested in your answer after my answer.
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.120]   So I found when I joined Kaggle, one
[00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.480]   of the things that immediately gave me
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.640]   a large boost in learning and in kind of discovering
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:54.640]   the notebooks.
[00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.160]   And I got very involved in the notebooks, which,
[00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.640]   back in the time, were called kernels.
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:05.120]   And I still like to call them kernels for old times' sake.
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.640]   And I really dove into the notebooks.
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.360]   I was quite successful there.
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.360]   I became a brand master.
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.840]   And over time, I had the impression
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.120]   that there were a lot of people who
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.560]   were publishing great content.
[00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.680]   And a lot of those people got recognition.
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:24.880]   They got the upvotes.
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.040]   They got recognition from the community.
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.040]   They got lots of engagement on their notebooks.
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.760]   But every now and then, I would stumble across a notebook that
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.600]   was really a hidden gem.
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.960]   It was maybe attached to a secure data set.
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.480]   It didn't get that much engagement.
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.920]   But the author had gone through a great deal of work
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.960]   to make this notebook really engaging, really fun,
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.400]   and really insightful.
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.480]   I'm sorry, could you please adjust your mic settings?
[00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.720]   I think it's a bit far away.
[00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:56.920]   Can you see it?
[00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:57.760]   It's perfect now.
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:58.280]   Yeah.
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.000]   Is it better now?
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.680]   You were cutting off, sorry.
[00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:01.640]   I'm sorry for that.
[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.920]   You were saying that you kept finding hidden gems literally
[00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.920]   while going through notebooks.
[00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.640]   Yes, I kept finding these hidden gems.
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:14.960]   And the way that I thought of it is
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.960]   that I had been quite fortunate in the feedback
[00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:23.440]   and the engagement that I got from the community,
[00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.680]   for whichever reasons, I don't know.
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.280]   And other people who were producing
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:31.560]   great content for other reasons weren't that fortunate.
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.640]   So I thought that there's a lot of great content
[00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:41.600]   hidden within the Kaggle data sets or in other Kaggle events.
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:45.880]   And I thought to myself, it would be great
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:51.040]   if there was a way to bring that content to the forefront
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.800]   and to make it accessible to other people,
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.480]   because there's a lot that you can learn from it.
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:59.960]   And one of the great strengths of the Kaggle community
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:04.040]   is the very wide range of people from different backgrounds,
[00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.680]   very diverse set of community members
[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.160]   that bring in new ideas and bring in new angles.
[00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.400]   And sometimes some of those might be hidden
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:12.640]   and you have to look for them.
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:14.880]   And I wanted to make it easier to look for them.
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:21.240]   And since I was quite successful and quite happy
[00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.440]   with the notebooks, so the notebooks were something
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.800]   that came relatively natural to me,
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:29.800]   I thought the Kaggle community has given me so much.
[00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.720]   This is a way for me to give back to it.
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:40.880]   This is a way for me to use the modest reputation that I have
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:45.240]   and use my expertise when it comes to notebook design
[00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.520]   and when it comes to visuals and everything
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:50.200]   to highlight these hidden treasures
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:52.760]   and to make them available to the rest of the community,
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:55.160]   which kind of enriches the community overall
[00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:58.400]   and hopefully also gives some motivation
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:02.840]   to these authors of the gems to keep producing great content
[00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.440]   and keep coming back to Kaggle.
[00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:09.160]   That's awesome.
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:13.960]   Just for the audience, Martin was the first Colonel's
[00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:15.360]   Grandmaster, as I understand.
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.680]   And there's also an absolutely legendary video
[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:18.960]   that Kaggle made with him.
[00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:20.440]   I think it's pinned on his Twitter,
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.160]   so you can go check that out and learn more about his journey
[00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:23.660]   as well.
[00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:28.120]   You were curious about my answer.
[00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:30.160]   I'll try to keep it short because I talk too much.
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:33.880]   But it's the same experience for me, just general gratitude
[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:36.440]   for how awesome the Kaggle community is.
[00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:40.360]   People like yourself, many other legends, share so much.
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:43.040]   And for me, it's like an obligation
[00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:45.120]   almost to share your journeys and make sure
[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:47.280]   it reaches to new Kagglers like myself
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:50.120]   so that we can copy your style and hopefully get
[00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:53.880]   to at least some level of where you are.
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:56.920]   I'll ask one more question before requesting
[00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:59.720]   you to start sharing how we can get started.
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:01.720]   How are you finding these hidden gems?
[00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:03.200]   Is there a process around it?
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:05.320]   Because I'm sure it takes a lot of work.
[00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:07.720]   So how are you navigating the platform
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:11.280]   or any process around that?
[00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:12.760]   Yeah, that's a good question.
[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:17.280]   I mean, the process, I have to admit, is a little bit chaotic.
[00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:22.120]   Sometimes I just blindly go through interesting notebooks
[00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:25.120]   that show up on my feed even.
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:29.200]   So I don't know how other people use this kind of this Kaggle
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:33.240]   news feed that comes up when you just go to the main page.
[00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:35.040]   But I use it for that.
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:40.080]   Sometimes I'm kind of falling down rabbit holes almost
[00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:44.640]   on Kaggle, or I'm looking for specific aspects
[00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:48.400]   or for specific tools, like data visualization tools,
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:51.800]   or clustering, or time series, or something like this.
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:53.840]   And I'm looking for interesting notebooks that have
[00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:56.000]   been published on those topics.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.480]   And then very often, there are some gems in there.
[00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:06.360]   So they are the ones that are at the top of the listing, which
[00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:08.960]   are great and which are popular for a good reason.
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:11.920]   But then further down, if you sort by votes
[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:16.960]   or if you sort by the infamous hotness,
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:19.840]   then you find other content that's great
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:23.160]   but has been relatively overlooked so far.
[00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:28.760]   And sometimes things come up on Twitter, sometimes on LinkedIn
[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:30.400]   as well, that somebody says, hey, I
[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:33.840]   published my first Kaggle notebook or something
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:34.360]   like this.
[00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.120]   And it's really fun.
[00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:39.480]   And then I just bookmark that and then come back to it
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:42.800]   like a week or two later and see what has happened to that.
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:44.840]   And sometimes there's not much engagement
[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:50.880]   because the people haven't been a part of the community
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:51.920]   for that long.
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:55.160]   And I try to give them a little boost and encouragement
[00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.600]   if I find that their content is great.
[00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:59.920]   I can be a little bit picky from time to time.
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:04.360]   So I do admit that I look at many more notebooks than the
[00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:07.840]   three that end up in the list every week.
[00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:09.720]   I'm sure.
[00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:16.920]   And yeah, and there are some kind of relatively easy tweaks
[00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:19.160]   that you can make to almost any notebook
[00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:22.920]   to make it more interesting to the reader
[00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:25.920]   and more accessible, which in the end
[00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:30.680]   is a huge factor when it comes to, I think,
[00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:33.520]   the success of any notebook or of any report, right?
[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:35.680]   So we talked about this a little bit in the past,
[00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:36.920]   I think, on your show as well.
[00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:40.320]   I think that being able to communicate
[00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:43.480]   your insights and your work and your process
[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:46.360]   as a data scientist and a machine learning practitioner
[00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:50.560]   is a highly important but very underrated skill overall.
[00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:56.000]   Yeah, totally.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.440]   I still have a lot to learn, so I won't comment on that.
[00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:01.200]   But I'll request you to please start telling us
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:06.040]   what's the competition about and how can everyone get started?
[00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:16.240]   Right, so let me share the post that started it all.
[00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:22.280]   So this is the page of the data set itself.
[00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:26.160]   A little bit of background here, this data set
[00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:31.000]   contains all the past Hidden Gems episodes,
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.240]   so from episode number one all the way down to episode 100.
[00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:39.160]   So you can keep scrolling here, and it keeps refreshing.
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.640]   And that's something that I had put together
[00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:46.920]   for the anniversary episode 50.
[00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:49.840]   So about a year ago, I decided that, OK, this
[00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:51.600]   seems to be interesting to people.
[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:55.840]   So let's go with the usual Kaggle style
[00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:57.560]   and put everything into a data set
[00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:59.600]   so that people can have access to it.
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:02.120]   And in this data set, you find the date--
[00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:03.840]   Can you please zoom in a bit?
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:08.040]   Oh, yes, absolutely.
[00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:08.720]   That's perfect.
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:10.560]   Thank you.
[00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:13.880]   All right, so in this data set, you
[00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:17.320]   find the date when the episode was published.
[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:20.440]   So it's kind of a frequency of a week.
[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:22.200]   And I publish it in the general forum.
[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:25.120]   I publish it on Twitter as well, so there's a link for that.
[00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:27.400]   Then the link to the notebook itself,
[00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:32.480]   about that's what it's all about, the name of the author,
[00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:35.720]   or the user ID of the-- or username of the author
[00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:37.920]   on Kaggle, the title of the notebook.
[00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:40.520]   And then I write these short reviews
[00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:45.000]   that explain why I picked this notebook for the Hidden Gems
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.040]   series and a couple of interesting aspects about it.
[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:53.920]   So here it's about the comprehensive documentation.
[00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:56.600]   Others have some interactive maps
[00:12:56.600 --> 00:13:01.600]   that I want to highlight, visualize transitions
[00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:03.160]   between generative images.
[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:05.640]   So there's a large kind of range of what's
[00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:08.440]   interesting about specific notebooks.
[00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:14.200]   And then we have the name of the author,
[00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:18.240]   the way they put it on their profile,
[00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:20.280]   and their social links.
[00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:23.040]   So I have the Twitter link, the LinkedIn link, which can
[00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:24.640]   be put on a profile as well.
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:28.400]   And I just kind of read them manually
[00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:30.240]   and put them in every week.
[00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:33.720]   And some of the episodes have special notes.
[00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:38.120]   And this is kind of a column that
[00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:39.760]   was more important at the beginning
[00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:44.120]   when there were these kind of community episodes,
[00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:47.280]   every 10 episodes.
[00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:48.760]   So you can check this out as well,
[00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:51.160]   see if there's some residual information in there.
[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:53.680]   But overall, those are the main features.
[00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:58.320]   So a post would look like this.
[00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:00.200]   This is today.
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:02.120]   I posted this in the morning.
[00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:08.120]   And this is for our anniversary episode, number 100.
[00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:11.000]   There are the three notebooks.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.640]   And then there's the short description,
[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:13.600]   what I like about them.
[00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:18.240]   Here about this one, detailed exploratory analysis.
[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:21.280]   It's a very strong narration, clean data wrangling,
[00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:25.920]   which is also important that you clearly
[00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:28.520]   explain how you get the data into the shape
[00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:31.680]   that you're then presenting, and really, really great data
[00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:33.520]   visuals.
[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:39.920]   And all of that is contained in this data set.
[00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:44.240]   And the competition is all about exploring this data set.
[00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:47.520]   So this is the post.
[00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:50.640]   And the post-- so we have this little poster
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:53.600]   that we made for it, and it has all the important information.
[00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:57.080]   It's a competition that will run for four weeks from today
[00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:59.640]   until the beginning of May.
[00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:05.680]   And we have some great, great judges from the community,
[00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:08.040]   including yourself and--
[00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:12.520]   I wouldn't count myself on this, on the great list.
[00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:13.520]   Well, I would.
[00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:21.000]   And I'm in charge here, so I count you in there.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.480]   And we have Laura, we have Rob, we have Andrada, we have Paoul,
[00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:28.080]   we have Abhishek, and then we have some special guests
[00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:28.960]   as well.
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:32.080]   And some of those special guests we can already reveal,
[00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:33.440]   and some of those special guests,
[00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:37.680]   they might appear throughout the competition.
[00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:39.400]   So what is it all about?
[00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:42.720]   What is a notebooks competition to begin with?
[00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:45.640]   It's different from your usual Kaggle competition.
[00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:47.360]   What usually happens on Kaggle is
[00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:53.120]   that your challenge is to predict something,
[00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:55.120]   train your model on a train set, and then
[00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:56.200]   predict on a test set.
[00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:59.840]   And then there's a leaderboard that ranks those predictions.
[00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:04.160]   And the top finishers on the leaderboard
[00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:06.040]   get a prize in the end.
[00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:07.360]   And that's very exciting, right?
[00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:09.280]   That's one of the main reasons why we're here.
[00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:11.880]   And those machine learning competitions are great.
[00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:15.200]   This is a slightly different take on a competition.
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:21.200]   Here, what you do is you publish a notebook that explores
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:24.240]   and analyzes this data set.
[00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:27.480]   And this notebook, ideally, will discover
[00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:30.640]   some interesting insights, will look at specific aspects,
[00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:34.320]   have some great data visuals, have some strong narration
[00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:36.440]   and explanation.
[00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:41.240]   And on all those criteria, your work
[00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:47.600]   is then being evaluated by our panel of judges, who, again,
[00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:54.800]   are those really stellar pillars of the community that
[00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:59.560]   graciously have agreed to help me with this task of judging
[00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:00.680]   the contributions.
[00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:05.200]   So you see that there are lots of names
[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:07.960]   that you will recognize, and there are lots of names that
[00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:12.440]   have been an integral part of the community for a long time.
[00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:14.360]   And I'm really, really happy that they
[00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:20.600]   agreed to generously devote some of their time
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:24.200]   to this competition and to the judging itself.
[00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:28.880]   So in a nutshell, you write a notebook.
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:34.480]   You find some interesting insights on the hidden gems,
[00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:36.160]   on the authors, on the notebooks,
[00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:37.920]   or whichever aspect you like.
[00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:39.280]   You publish this notebook.
[00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:42.080]   You make it very interesting, engaging for the readers.
[00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:46.040]   And then you get judged by the panel.
[00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:48.840]   And your notebook gets a great score,
[00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:51.080]   and you win some cool prizes.
[00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:54.640]   This is what's happening here.
[00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:55.160]   Awesome.
[00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:57.680]   I recognize all of the names on there,
[00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:00.200]   and I'm super stoked about the judge panel
[00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:03.840]   and what the audience will do.
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:07.400]   Yes, and have you seen the little Easter egg?
[00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:10.760]   So one of our special guests, which I can already reveal
[00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:16.480]   today, is that we have the co-founder and the CEO
[00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:20.440]   of Kaggle itself, Mr. Anthony Goldbloom,
[00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:25.160]   who will do part of the judging in this competition.
[00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:32.040]   So if you're doing really well and if your notebook gets
[00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:34.800]   really high marks from our judge panel,
[00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:37.920]   then Anthony himself will look at your notebook
[00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:41.240]   and will tell you how great you are.
[00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:47.000]   I can't expect a higher bar for anyone else
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.840]   to get praise from the CEO of Kaggle himself.
[00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:51.120]   That's super exciting.
[00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:54.960]   Awesome.
[00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:59.360]   So maybe if it's OK, we can give some ideas
[00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:00.800]   on how to get started, maybe just
[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:04.640]   through your starter notebook or just broad ideas,
[00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:06.600]   if you'd like.
[00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:09.840]   Yes, we can absolutely do that.
[00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:16.800]   So there is a starter notebook, which I have to find,
[00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:18.080]   which is here.
[00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:20.520]   So it's linked in the data set, and it's also linked--
[00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:21.400]   I'm sorry?
[00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:23.640]   Sorry, I was just going to remind the audience
[00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:26.400]   that they can find the discussions on this link.
[00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:32.640]   I've made a short URL, which is 1db.me/hidden-gems-comp.
[00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:37.160]   If you go there, you'll find the discussions inside the data set.
[00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:40.080]   And on there, you can find the thread to get started,
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:43.280]   more resources, resources on getting started with symbiosis,
[00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:44.880]   which I just talked about.
[00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:47.400]   You can find all this info on this one small link.
[00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:50.640]   So go there if you don't know where to find this info.
[00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:51.920]   Sorry, please continue.
[00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:53.600]   Sorry to interrupt.
[00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:54.160]   No problem.
[00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:55.880]   It's very important information.
[00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:59.000]   Since we want lots of people to participate,
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:04.040]   and we want all of them to know how to get started.
[00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:08.600]   And one way to get started is to look at this starter notebook
[00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:09.160]   that I made.
[00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:12.040]   And I made this already for episode 50.
[00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:16.200]   So this is something that has been there for quite a while.
[00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:20.800]   So this is not something that you
[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:24.440]   should expect to put together within a week or a day or so.
[00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:25.000]   Maybe a week.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:25.800]   I don't know.
[00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:28.040]   But it's been there for a while.
[00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:31.960]   And everything else in this competition
[00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:35.520]   will kind of hopefully gradually grow around it
[00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:41.640]   and spiral off around it to all sorts of interesting directions.
[00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:45.240]   And one of the aspects that this notebook contains
[00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:49.400]   is a full table of all the hidden gems.
[00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:52.480]   And this notebook is written in R.
[00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:56.720]   And I know that R has become rarer and rarer
[00:20:56.720 --> 00:21:00.840]   on this platform, which is kind of more and more leaning
[00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:03.960]   towards machine learning.
[00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:05.760]   But when it comes-- or more and more
[00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:08.440]   towards kind of deep learning with PyTorch and TensorFlow
[00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:08.920]   and so on.
[00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:12.440]   But when it comes to specifically data visualization
[00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:15.960]   and tabular data wrangling and analysis,
[00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:18.800]   then R has some very powerful tools,
[00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:22.600]   both from the aspect of analyzing the data
[00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:26.520]   and also from the aspect of communicating the data.
[00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:30.160]   But then, of course, something you can do is to look at the way
[00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:35.200]   that I do things in R and then translate that, or parts of it,
[00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:41.160]   to Python, which is absolutely an option for you to learn.
[00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:45.400]   So here's a table that contains all the episodes.
[00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:47.280]   And I'm going to scroll very quickly.
[00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:48.560]   And it's not going to be pretty.
[00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:52.000]   But I want to end up here at volume 100.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.240]   So it's up to date.
[00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:55.960]   It has the name of the number of the episode.
[00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:56.760]   It has the date.
[00:21:56.760 --> 00:22:00.080]   And it has the link to the notebook itself
[00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:05.160]   and to the profile of the author on Kaggle.
[00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:10.240]   And this is kind of the input that you're working with.
[00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:13.760]   And already from that, you can do some overview visuals.
[00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:19.280]   Excuse me.
[00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:21.200]   So you can look at the notebook titles, right?
[00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:23.720]   Which kind of words come up on those titles?
[00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:25.200]   How long are the titles?
[00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:26.960]   What are the shortest and the longest?
[00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:29.680]   So if you're using Kaggle, you might
[00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:32.680]   know that there is a kind of limitation
[00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:35.160]   in terms of how short and how long
[00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:36.400]   a title of a notebook can be.
[00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:39.080]   It's between 5 and 50 characters.
[00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:43.080]   And we haven't really had a title
[00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:45.400]   that's only five characters in the hidden gems yet,
[00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:48.000]   but plenty that go up to 50.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.320]   And this one, the very kind of cleverly named
[00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:55.120]   Afrika.ai, remains the shortest title so far
[00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:57.960]   with seven characters.
[00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:00.120]   Yeah, seven.
[00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:01.960]   And that's interesting, right?
[00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:06.520]   So people kind of gravitate towards longer titles
[00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:07.720]   for their notebooks.
[00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:10.280]   But is that something that's useful?
[00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:14.440]   Is that maybe that contributes to those notebooks being
[00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:17.320]   overlooked because people think, OK, the titles are too long
[00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:18.800]   or something like this?
[00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:20.480]   That's an interesting aspect.
[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:24.000]   And then you can look at the authors themselves, right?
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.040]   One interesting thing that came up
[00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:28.880]   is that on your Kaggle profile, you
[00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:39.080]   can link your socials like this.
[00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:43.520]   I have both my LinkedIn and my Twitter on there.
[00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:46.360]   And you can also link your GitHub, if you like,
[00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:50.080]   and some other kind of personal web pages.
[00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:54.520]   And interestingly enough, only about half of people,
[00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:57.440]   half of the authors in our kind of hidden gems,
[00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:59.120]   they have their LinkedIn on there
[00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:01.320]   or they have a LinkedIn in the first place.
[00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:05.480]   But more than 90% have their--
[00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:07.240]   I did it wrong again.
[00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:10.240]   Only half have their Twitter or have a Twitter account
[00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:11.080]   in the first place.
[00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:12.720]   And more than 90% have their LinkedIn,
[00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:17.520]   which gives you an interesting insight into how people use
[00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:22.000]   that Kaggle profile possibly and what kind of information
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.920]   they find important to put on there.
[00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:27.280]   May I just throw a note, suggestion out there?
[00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:28.240]   Maybe you've thought about this.
[00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:29.200]   Maybe the audience will.
[00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:31.120]   But I'd also be curious to see how
[00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:35.480]   are people who are really doing well on non-GEM kernels,
[00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:38.480]   so whose kernels have higher ports,
[00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:41.280]   and do they have a different split?
[00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:43.080]   I'd be curious to check out.
[00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:44.880]   That's why it's a hidden gem.
[00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:46.480]   Maybe they should be sharing on Twitter
[00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:49.400]   or some other platform.
[00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:50.720]   Yeah, maybe.
[00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:51.280]   Yeah.
[00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:54.240]   Maybe it's more likely general, that kind of notebooks
[00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:56.200]   that are getting a lot of engagement.
[00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:58.040]   The authors have Twitter accounts
[00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:00.040]   and they're sharing their work on Twitter.
[00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:01.160]   That's entirely possible.
[00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:03.080]   And these kind of ideas--
[00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:08.240]   so I'm always a big advocate in when
[00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:11.440]   you're putting a visual like this to document
[00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:13.440]   your insights from it.
[00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:16.480]   And this is what I'm doing consistently
[00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:17.720]   in the starter notebook.
[00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:20.880]   And I wrote down after 50 episodes the insights
[00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:21.600]   that I found.
[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:24.680]   And then I also wrote down after 100 episodes.
[00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:29.040]   And then-- this is interesting for this competition--
[00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:32.640]   I always include some suggestions for further
[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:35.240]   analysis and further steps.
[00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:37.560]   And that includes some of the ideas
[00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:40.200]   that we just talked about, or includes
[00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:42.720]   other common features among the Twitter users.
[00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:46.120]   And what's the percentage of LinkedIn users among them?
[00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:49.840]   How do they compare, which is what we just touched on?
[00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:52.920]   How do you compare to the Kaggle community as a whole?
[00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:55.800]   And maybe there's a difference by the tiers,
[00:25:55.800 --> 00:26:00.080]   like expert and master and grandmaster.
[00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:04.120]   So all the kind of visuals that I have in this notebook,
[00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:07.320]   they have these suggestions for further analysis
[00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:09.840]   attached to them, which I think are
[00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:13.800]   kind of a great stepping stone for getting started
[00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:15.160]   with your own analysis.
[00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:18.680]   And then I can guarantee you that if you're
[00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:21.120]   starting to look at the data, if you start to follow
[00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:23.320]   these hints and ideas, then you'll
[00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:25.560]   get more ideas of your own.
[00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:30.320]   And you get more thoughts about which aspects to follow
[00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:32.680]   and which aspects to study more deeply.
[00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:36.440]   And this will then determine the direction of your analysis.
[00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:40.280]   And some of the authors are kind of--
[00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:44.640]   they are featured more than once in my Hidden Gems series,
[00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:46.960]   which I kind of--
[00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:52.120]   I think it's fine, because they have put out a lot of content.
[00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:55.400]   And if even after multiple mentions,
[00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:57.880]   the other notebooks are still underrated,
[00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:02.000]   then I think those other notebooks
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:03.800]   deserve mention as well.
[00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:07.240]   And again, there's some ideas how you can follow this up.
[00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:10.360]   And then ultimately, there are my reviews,
[00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:12.920]   so the kind of the brief explanations
[00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:16.600]   that I put together as to why I'm picking this notebook
[00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:17.880]   for the Hidden Gems.
[00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:22.240]   And you see that some certain kind of words
[00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:24.360]   occur very frequently in my reviews.
[00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:28.000]   Like, I'm a big fan of visuals and of exploration.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.040]   Data and Calculus, of course, they are kind of my favorites.
[00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:34.040]   Exploration, Data and Calculus, of course, they are--
[00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:36.360]   narration is important to me.
[00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:39.880]   And I think that kind of appears as well.
[00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:41.680]   A very clean analysis is something
[00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:45.960]   that's useful, structured, and exploration, interpretation.
[00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:49.680]   So those shouldn't be too surprising,
[00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:54.000]   that those are the names that I'm bringing up in my reviews
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:59.280]   when I'm talking about why I included these notebooks.
[00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:03.520]   And then, after we looked at the data set itself,
[00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:06.800]   there is a very interesting connection
[00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:12.760]   to the larger body of data that exists on Kaggle,
[00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:15.560]   on the contributions that Kagglers are making.
[00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:19.840]   And this is the Meta Kaggle data set.
[00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:22.960]   And maybe we can have a little dialogue about it.
[00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:27.240]   Tell me, Sanyam, what do you know about Meta Kaggle?
[00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:32.080]   I know it's used to check for a lot of flaggy activity as well.
[00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:33.720]   So legends use it for that.
[00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:36.120]   But I know you can do a lot of interesting stuff there.
[00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:38.120]   So I know people in the Chai competition
[00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:41.840]   figured out how many grandmasters
[00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:44.320]   I've interviewed on the podcast using Meta Kaggle.
[00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:46.480]   You can do different stuff, like figure out
[00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:48.200]   how active people are.
[00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:55.440]   So it's really all the info on different Kagglers you can find.
[00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:57.880]   Yes, and it's really fantastic.
[00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:00.320]   And it's really comprehensive.
[00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:03.480]   So Kaggle is kind of true to its form
[00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:09.160]   here as a great platform for data scientists and machine
[00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:10.520]   learning practitioners.
[00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:15.840]   Collects all the data on what we all do on the platform, right?
[00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:20.800]   Data on competitions, data on which data sets are published,
[00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:23.880]   on forum activity, on the notebooks
[00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:28.560]   themselves, which warms my heart that they are still
[00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:35.920]   called kernels here, which is great, and on the users,
[00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:41.200]   right, on all of us on this platform, what our progression
[00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:44.680]   was through the tiers and what our achievements are, right?
[00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:50.800]   So it's also a history of all of our journey
[00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:53.400]   here on Kaggle, which is great.
[00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:56.200]   And this Meta Kaggle data set now
[00:29:56.200 --> 00:30:02.200]   allows us to widen and deepen our analysis of the gems
[00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:02.920]   considerably.
[00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:07.240]   So the gem data set itself, it has these 300 notebooks.
[00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:10.440]   And it already has quite a lot of interesting insights.
[00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:14.760]   You can kind of think of it as a swimming pool that's
[00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:16.640]   next to the ocean, right?
[00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:18.880]   So you can do some great stuff in there.
[00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:22.160]   You can do some swimming techniques.
[00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:24.080]   And you can practice this and that.
[00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:27.960]   And then Meta Kaggle kind of opens up the pool
[00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:29.320]   into the ocean itself.
[00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:31.880]   And you can go anywhere.
[00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:38.120]   You can kind of explore the different fish that
[00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:39.400]   live in the ocean.
[00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:42.000]   Maybe there's a coral reef or so.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:45.040]   That's very exciting.
[00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:48.400]   So it's a very healthy and well-populated ocean,
[00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:49.680]   is what I'm saying.
[00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:54.880]   And it allows you to kind of go anywhere with your analysis,
[00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:55.600]   really.
[00:30:55.600 --> 00:31:02.440]   And this is something that I've touched on in my notebook,
[00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:04.760]   wherever it is here.
[00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:08.880]   So we can now enrich those gems with all the information
[00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:10.360]   from Meta Kaggle.
[00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:12.480]   So we can look at the authors.
[00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:17.720]   We can look at this user's CSV file, which we had--
[00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:19.480]   no, it's one of the two.
[00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:23.080]   But it's not shown by default, which is here.
[00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:33.400]   And we can pull that in to get the user tiers of the authors.
[00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:36.240]   So Kaggle is arranged from novice to grandmaster.
[00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:37.800]   And then we have a special category
[00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:40.280]   for the Kaggle team itself.
[00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:44.440]   And we can see how those contributed over time
[00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:46.040]   through the hidden gems.
[00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:49.240]   And I'm quite happy with the way that this plot looks like.
[00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:51.680]   We have more than 10% contributions
[00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:54.160]   from novices, which is something that I'm aiming for,
[00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:56.720]   is to kind of highlight people who might just
[00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:59.160]   be making their first steps into Kaggle
[00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:01.760]   and already contributing something great.
[00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:05.800]   And not overweigh the masters and the grandmasters,
[00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:10.920]   but also not discount their hidden contributions
[00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:12.040]   if they--
[00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:15.160]   discard the hidden contributions if they occur.
[00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:18.200]   And the user's data set also includes the date
[00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:21.640]   at which somebody joined Kaggle.
[00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:24.000]   So we can plot that as well.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:27.760]   And we can see that Kaggle has seen a lot of growth
[00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:29.560]   over the last couple of years.
[00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:34.640]   And we see that the single largest cohort of gem authors,
[00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:37.120]   they joined in 2020.
[00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:40.800]   So they are pretty recent.
[00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:45.840]   And all that information you can get by joining onto MetaKaggle.
[00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:48.120]   And then there are some other suggestions
[00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:49.120]   for further analysis.
[00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:51.960]   You can look at the notebook metrics themselves, right?
[00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:58.720]   So there is a table called Kernel Languages that
[00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:02.560]   unsurprisingly tells you about the programming languages
[00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:04.840]   that certain kernels were using.
[00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:08.400]   And here is a kind of breakdown between Python and R
[00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:12.600]   that is 75% and 25%.
[00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:15.640]   And I think this is a larger R percentage
[00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:17.760]   than in the overall Kaggle.
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:19.680]   I was going to say that.
[00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:20.400]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:23.280]   Maybe it's because of your bias towards R.
[00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:24.080]   I might be.
[00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:25.880]   I'm very open about my bias.
[00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:31.240]   I like R. But then also, when it comes to data presentation
[00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:36.920]   and data visualization, R still has an edge in many aspects.
[00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:40.520]   And I think this is the way that people are using it.
[00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:42.440]   And this is the way that I really
[00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:47.360]   want more people who have fun working with R
[00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:53.720]   to join the Kaggle community and to start sharing their R
[00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:59.000]   skills with us and show us what the most recent developments
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:04.240]   are and show us what R can do for interesting data sets
[00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:07.680]   and for interesting questions.
[00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:10.000]   So I'm absolutely supporting that.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.640]   And I don't dislike Python.
[00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:13.320]   I like Python.
[00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:14.360]   I think it's a great language.
[00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:15.200]   And I'm using both.
[00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:18.200]   So personally, I'm using both R and Python.
[00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:22.040]   And I think it's always a good thing
[00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:26.680]   not to limit yourself too narrowly to just one thing.
[00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:29.800]   And maybe it doesn't have to be Python and R.
[00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:33.560]   It could be Python and Rust or R and Julia.
[00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:35.560]   Or there are a lot of things out there
[00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:37.760]   that could be interesting and that
[00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:41.360]   can give you new ideas and fresh ideas
[00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:43.600]   about your favorite programming language itself.
[00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:47.960]   So don't be too narrow.
[00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:51.520]   And yeah, we can look also at the metals.
[00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:53.200]   So this is now about the notebooks,
[00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:58.440]   which is this kernels CSV that we just talked about.
[00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:02.000]   And we can look at the metals.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.920]   This information is in metakaggle.
[00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:07.600]   The views and the votes is in metakaggle as well.
[00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:11.040]   As well as the creation date and the number of comments
[00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:12.840]   that the notebook received.
[00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:16.760]   And there's a lot of information there
[00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:19.080]   that could tell us something maybe about what
[00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:22.720]   makes a gem a gem and could even allow
[00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:26.920]   some small predictive model that somebody could
[00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:32.120]   build to help me find and explore and pick future gems.
[00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:37.120]   So this might be a potential topic for a notebook.
[00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:42.000]   And then you can go as meta as you like, really.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:47.320]   Because now the metakaggle also contains this data
[00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:50.320]   set called forum topics.
[00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:57.200]   And forum topics contains the hidden gems posts.
[00:35:57.200 --> 00:36:02.080]   So this post, for instance, is contained in forum topics.
[00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:05.080]   So within the hidden gems data set,
[00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:07.720]   we now have the hidden gems--
[00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:09.840]   or within the hidden gems analysis,
[00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:15.560]   we now have the data about the gems.
[00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:17.360]   So you see, it gets a little kind
[00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:21.040]   of Inception-like mind-bending.
[00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:25.560]   But you can now see the engagements
[00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:28.360]   that the hidden gems posts got over time.
[00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:32.960]   So all the 100 posts are on here, almost all of them,
[00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:37.800]   from the first one through the time through today.
[00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:42.920]   And you can study what kind of circumstances
[00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:47.520]   might bring more engagement to a post
[00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:50.400]   and what could lead to a post getting less engagement.
[00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:52.560]   Because essentially, the posts always
[00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:53.520]   have the same structure.
[00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:56.480]   It's three notebooks that I'm publishing.
[00:36:56.480 --> 00:37:00.880]   And they have the reviews attached to them.
[00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:05.120]   And the structure itself doesn't really change that much.
[00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:07.440]   And that is it, really.
[00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:12.760]   So this, I really intend this to be
[00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:16.000]   kind of a jumping board, a starting point for lots
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.680]   of people to look through, to get ideas about what they can
[00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:22.640]   do with this data set and what they can do when they combine
[00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:24.680]   this data set with metakaggle.
[00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:28.800]   And just go crazy, go wild.
[00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:31.560]   Explore what you find interesting
[00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:33.520]   and share your explorations with us.
[00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:38.280]   And then maybe win a prize.
[00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:41.880]   Do you have any general suggestions of things
[00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:43.680]   people could start off?
[00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:47.480]   I know it's a hard question, because I was trying to think--
[00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:49.720]   looking back, I was trying to think of similar things.
[00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:51.560]   And I was trying to host a chat competition.
[00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:52.840]   And I just didn't have ideas.
[00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:55.380]   And Kaggle, of course, blew me away with the analysis.
[00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:58.480]   But maybe you have any suggestions for people
[00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:01.440]   to look into?
[00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:04.960]   Well, like I said, there are suggestions.
[00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:08.240]   There are ideas throughout this notebook.
[00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:11.520]   So Kernel's data set contains the date
[00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:13.240]   that the medal was awarded.
[00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:17.200]   So you could be comparing that date
[00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:21.960]   to the date at which the Hidden Gems episode was published.
[00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:27.240]   And then see whether this episode being published
[00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:29.480]   had an impact and how much of an impact
[00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:33.480]   it might have on the vote count and on the medals,
[00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:39.520]   on the engagement in general that the notebook got.
[00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:43.640]   Then another thing is what distinguishes
[00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:45.240]   the Python and the R notebooks.
[00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:49.200]   Notebooks have tags attached to them.
[00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:52.720]   You maybe can get the number of visuals or something like this.
[00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:56.080]   Are there any-- other than the language itself,
[00:38:56.080 --> 00:39:00.480]   are there any substantial, significant differences?
[00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:03.720]   And then I also have some suggestions and ideas.
[00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:08.840]   Ultimately, I want you to just surprise us.
[00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:11.440]   Pick an aspect of the gems that interest you
[00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:14.320]   and just follow it down at Robert Hall
[00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:19.240]   and surprise us with great insights
[00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:23.160]   and interesting and creative presentations.
[00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:26.640]   Did the style of the Hidden Gems change over time?
[00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:28.120]   This is a very meta thing here.
[00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:33.360]   How many gems authors interacted with my posts about them?
[00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:34.960]   This is no judgment.
[00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:38.280]   Either way, as a gems author, you can do whatever you like.
[00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:43.040]   But it would be interesting to see how many people came back
[00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:46.920]   and commented in the post something.
[00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:49.920]   Are there maybe distinct categories of gems?
[00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:52.880]   Do they cluster around certain aspects
[00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:54.360]   that are particularly interesting?
[00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:56.400]   And I actually don't know the answer to that.
[00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:59.280]   I have a very intuitive approach to them.
[00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:03.240]   And do you want to explore all the links to MetaKaggle?
[00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:04.640]   Yeah, just do it.
[00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:08.400]   Do you maybe want to build an NLP bot that
[00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:10.760]   helps me write my reviews?
[00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:11.520]   Sure.
[00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:13.920]   If you share it with me afterwards,
[00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:17.240]   things could get much simpler for me.
[00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:21.360]   And maybe you could even create a model to predict future gems.
[00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:25.120]   And we talked a little bit about this, not the two of us,
[00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:28.920]   but within the comments of the gems,
[00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:30.920]   somebody occasionally would bring up,
[00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:33.280]   maybe you could just train a machine learning model
[00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:35.080]   to find those gems.
[00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:37.400]   And you don't have to do it yourself.
[00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:40.920]   And I want it to be even easier for me.
[00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:44.720]   I want you, the participants, to train such a model
[00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:46.680]   so that I don't have to do it myself.
[00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:50.160]   But any of these aspects, any of these approaches,
[00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:52.320]   are possible and anything beyond.
[00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:54.400]   But here's some ideas.
[00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:57.280]   Here's some suggestions for you to get started.
[00:40:57.280 --> 00:41:00.800]   And you can take them or leave them.
[00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:03.040]   Just surprise us.
[00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:04.720]   Let's automate heads or tails.
[00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:07.720]   And let's create a bot that finds gems every week.
[00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:12.280]   You can run it weekly on a Kaggle kernel.
[00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:12.800]   Awesome.
[00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:13.720]   I don't see any questions.
[00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:14.920]   People are just joining in.
[00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:17.600]   And they're quite excited about the competition.
[00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:19.080]   That's what the chat's been saying.
[00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:22.000]   Again, as a reminder to everyone,
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:26.400]   bondb.me/hidden-gems-comp is where
[00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:29.760]   you want to go to find all of these details.
[00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:32.040]   Anything else you want to highlight, Martin,
[00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:36.080]   before I give an intro to Weights and Biases?
[00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:38.000]   Tell us about Weights and Biases.
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:38.800]   Awesome.
[00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:42.440]   Let me share my screen and point everyone to the discussion post
[00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:45.080]   and go from there.
[00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:46.600]   So while you were giving the demo,
[00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:48.060]   I was on the scratch pad and trying
[00:41:48.060 --> 00:41:51.640]   to put something together for how people can get started.
[00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:55.160]   So just on a very two-minute note,
[00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:58.000]   you can pip install the WANDB API.
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:01.600]   And you can import it as a Python framework.
[00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:03.200]   And from there, you can do two things.
[00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:05.840]   If you're running your code interactively,
[00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:10.200]   you could either log in via the prompt that shows up.
[00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:14.000]   Or Kaggle has this neat secret feature, which I can show.
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:16.320]   And I can later delete this value.
[00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:18.160]   I don't have to, because it's already hidden.
[00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:19.280]   So that's nice.
[00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:20.880]   But you can add your secrets here,
[00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:25.080]   where I can add in my API and import it like so,
[00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:27.880]   which means whatever logging I do here
[00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:29.400]   will go to my dashboard.
[00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:31.920]   So why would you want to do this in the first place?
[00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:33.600]   I'll show some examples.
[00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:35.800]   But broadly speaking, Weights and Biases
[00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:39.160]   is a tool designed to make your life easier as a machine
[00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:40.240]   learning practitioner.
[00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:41.440]   And it goes beyond that.
[00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:44.320]   As well, as you can see, this is an analysis competition.
[00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:46.880]   And I'll show some really nice examples, not by me.
[00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:48.520]   People much smarter than me.
[00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:50.920]   Some of them are on the judging panel
[00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:53.120]   that have created really nice analysis.
[00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:54.800]   So we also allow that.
[00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:59.600]   And let me show the examples and maybe prove to you
[00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:01.440]   why this can be helpful.
[00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:04.960]   So as part of this competition, we're also sponsoring a track.
[00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:07.040]   You can find the details in Martin's post.
[00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:08.880]   But I'll show some examples now.
[00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:11.480]   And Radha, who is also on the judging panel,
[00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:15.560]   created this really nice H&M notebook.
[00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:18.880]   Let me post the link to that in the YouTube chat
[00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:21.520]   so everyone can also go check it out.
[00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:23.040]   Make sure to check out this kernel.
[00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:26.480]   It's really one of my recent favorites.
[00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:30.040]   But with Kaggle kernels, you can, of course,
[00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:32.720]   do a really good job at storytelling.
[00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:36.800]   I think there's some scope of creating a polished dashboard
[00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:41.400]   as well where you just give the analysis or just the info
[00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:42.320]   upfront.
[00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:45.120]   That's what I think--
[00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:48.080]   and Radha's dashboard kind of fills in here.
[00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:51.040]   So as you can see, she's done all of these analysis.
[00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:54.680]   And just by looking at this dashboard,
[00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:57.680]   I can see that how many orders are going
[00:43:57.680 --> 00:44:02.080]   through for that competition, how many customer IDs are there.
[00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:05.440]   I can scroll down and see some custom charts.
[00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:10.760]   So like I said, it's, to me, in some ways,
[00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:12.920]   data analysis on steroids because now I
[00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:16.000]   have this detailed info, which is quite interactive.
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:17.840]   So I can go in there, play around
[00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:20.800]   with all of these values, rearrange these graphs,
[00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:21.520]   add panels.
[00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:24.160]   So if, like me, you don't like scrolling through documentation,
[00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:27.080]   you can just quite easily click through here,
[00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:31.400]   create all of these plots, fix the range instead of really
[00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:34.520]   running into 50 different errors.
[00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:40.440]   So the long story short version is as you create your analysis,
[00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:43.360]   you can also create a nice dashboard which just gives
[00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:46.640]   the information in one quick scroll.
[00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:49.560]   That's how Weights and Biases can help in this competition.
[00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:51.520]   Of course, if you want to track your experiments
[00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:54.600]   and if you train any NLP models, you can do that as well.
[00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:56.680]   You can track all of those.
[00:44:56.680 --> 00:45:01.080]   But for here, I think this is my bias, a bias that I am bringing.
[00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:04.200]   But I believe people could track in their experiments
[00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:07.080]   and also showcase a lot of analysis,
[00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:08.520]   like so in the dashboard.
[00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:12.360]   So you can find these links in the Getting Started thread
[00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:15.880]   I've created inside of the discussions post.
[00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:19.360]   I think that's all I wanted to give us
[00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:22.280]   a very, very quick introduction to the platform.
[00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:26.600]   Yes, thank you.
[00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:30.120]   And of course, if you're using Weights and Biases
[00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:35.680]   in your notebook, then there are special prizes for you to win.
[00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:38.440]   Would you like to share those prizes?
[00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:40.080]   I was waiting for your post.
[00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:42.480]   I think it will be announced over the next few days
[00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:43.800]   how these will be distributed.
[00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:46.760]   But the prize pool-- and again, it's up to Martin.
[00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:48.840]   So he'll tell us how those are distributed.
[00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:52.360]   You could win up to $1,000 in GPU credits.
[00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:57.120]   And also, I think, five Weights and Biases swag pieces.
[00:45:57.120 --> 00:45:58.640]   Again, Martin will decide the rules.
[00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:01.240]   But that is the prize pool that all of you can win.
[00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:02.440]   So you can take more models.
[00:46:02.440 --> 00:46:04.800]   You can win some Weights and Biases swag
[00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:06.000]   if you'd like that.
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:18.440]   Yes, we'll distribute it according to participation.
[00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:23.040]   So we're still going to see what the participation were.
[00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:25.680]   But what we're thinking of is to have
[00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:30.400]   three prizes for $500, $300, and $200 of credits
[00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:36.240]   for the first, second, and third notebook in this category.
[00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:38.880]   So this is if you're using Weights and Biases
[00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:44.800]   tools in your notebook, you are eligible for this prize.
[00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:49.040]   And you can get a very nice boost on your heavy model
[00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:51.600]   training with top GPUs.
[00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:57.200]   And then we have different prize ranking categories here.
[00:46:57.200 --> 00:46:59.440]   So let's cover those as well.
[00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:04.240]   In this competition, everybody's going to be ranked.
[00:47:04.240 --> 00:47:06.360]   Or everybody's going to be judged in the same way.
[00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:09.040]   And everybody will get points in the same way.
[00:47:09.040 --> 00:47:11.080]   But then for the prizes, the ranking
[00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:14.360]   will be done in different categories.
[00:47:14.360 --> 00:47:17.960]   One of the categories will include the Kaggle tiers
[00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:19.120]   novice to expert.
[00:47:19.120 --> 00:47:22.560]   And another one will include the tiers master to grandmaster.
[00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:26.160]   So the master and grandmaster Kagglers,
[00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:29.200]   they are competing in one category.
[00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:33.640]   And the novices and the contributors and the experts,
[00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:36.200]   they are contributing in another category.
[00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:38.880]   And in addition to that, we will also
[00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:42.280]   have a category for a newcomer prizes,
[00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:45.120]   for people who want to join the platform
[00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:48.720]   and who are already here and who haven't
[00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:51.000]   written a notebook yet and who want to write their very
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:52.560]   first Kaggle notebook.
[00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:53.680]   This is for you.
[00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:57.640]   This is the chance for you to win a newcomer prize
[00:47:57.640 --> 00:48:02.120]   and to show your outstanding skills
[00:48:02.120 --> 00:48:05.400]   and your outstanding contributions to the community.
[00:48:05.400 --> 00:48:09.040]   And we really, really hope that you'll do this
[00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:12.400]   and that you'll share your insights and your creativity
[00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:15.280]   with us.
[00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:18.600]   So those are the three categories.
[00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:20.360]   And then we have the fourth category,
[00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:22.960]   which is the Weights and Biases prize, which
[00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:25.920]   is for the best notebooks that make use of the Weights
[00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:27.720]   and Biases integration.
[00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:31.840]   And all of those four, they will be awarded
[00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:33.720]   at the end of the competition.
[00:48:33.720 --> 00:48:37.760]   So after four weeks, we'll do the judging
[00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:40.560]   and we'll award the prizes accordingly.
[00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:44.600]   And in addition to that, we also have a weekly prize.
[00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:47.200]   So we're going to run for four weeks.
[00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:49.840]   And every four weeks, every Tuesday,
[00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:54.960]   we will be awarding one prize to one outstanding notebook
[00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:55.840]   of the week.
[00:48:55.840 --> 00:48:58.120]   So you don't have to wait.
[00:48:58.120 --> 00:49:00.600]   If you're a very kind of impatient person
[00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:03.760]   and you're putting out a great, great notebook,
[00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:05.800]   you don't have to wait until the very end
[00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:07.240]   to be rewarded for that.
[00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:10.160]   You can already win a notebook of the week
[00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:13.440]   within the Hidden Gems competition.
[00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:18.000]   And then Sanyam already touched on it, what can you win?
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:24.760]   So we have the GPU credits for the fantastic JavaSlab AI
[00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:27.680]   platform, which are sponsored by Weights and Biases,
[00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:30.760]   for this category four, for the notebooks with Weights
[00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:32.280]   and Biases integration.
[00:49:32.280 --> 00:49:36.920]   And then for the other categories, we have swag.
[00:49:36.920 --> 00:49:42.840]   And the many kind of Kaggle aficionados, I think,
[00:49:42.840 --> 00:49:46.440]   will agree that swag is really--
[00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:47.760]   that's where it's at, right?
[00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:48.480]   Those are the most--
[00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:53.760]   those are the prizes that everybody wants, really.
[00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:58.320]   So if you're thinking about the Grandmaster hoodies
[00:49:58.320 --> 00:50:03.640]   or about a Kaggle mug, which is there,
[00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:06.360]   you might be able to see it on the shelf.
[00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:08.000]   These kind of things--
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:09.320]   I was able to spot it.
[00:50:09.320 --> 00:50:12.000]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:17.120]   These kind of things is really what many people that I've
[00:50:17.120 --> 00:50:19.280]   met over the years in Kaggle, this
[00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:21.240]   is what they're really interested in, right?
[00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:25.120]   Or a Kaggle sticker or something like this, or a t-shirt.
[00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:27.400]   There are lots of cool swag prizes out there.
[00:50:27.400 --> 00:50:31.440]   And we have swag sponsored generously by Kaggle
[00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:34.520]   and also sponsored generously by Weights and Biases.
[00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:41.320]   And you can win a swag prize from this prize pool,
[00:50:41.320 --> 00:50:43.080]   which is great.
[00:50:43.080 --> 00:50:46.320]   There are some kind of tangible prizes that you can win.
[00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:48.080]   But then, of course, you can also
[00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:53.080]   win the recognition of the community.
[00:50:53.080 --> 00:50:59.640]   And I'm sure that we'll be doing some kind of interviews
[00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:03.240]   or some highlights of the winners in some form or shape
[00:51:03.240 --> 00:51:04.920]   after the competition.
[00:51:04.920 --> 00:51:09.520]   So if you want to make a name within the Kaggle community
[00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:12.920]   and if you want to show us all the great stuff that you
[00:51:12.920 --> 00:51:16.880]   can build, this is the time for you as well.
[00:51:16.880 --> 00:51:20.760]   Yeah, as I've been telling you offline as well,
[00:51:20.760 --> 00:51:22.280]   I've been really excited about this.
[00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:24.200]   I was trying to help Martin while on the road.
[00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:27.120]   So I was maybe a bit slow at times, but we both--
[00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:30.600]   and I'm sure many other people who've been making this happen
[00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:31.640]   have been really excited.
[00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:34.320]   And I think that the prizes just speak to that,
[00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:38.000]   because this is a community effort by someone who
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:39.520]   wants to give back to the community
[00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:41.080]   and the community is coming together
[00:51:41.080 --> 00:51:42.920]   to help more people in the community,
[00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:45.320]   to join the Kaggle community.
[00:51:45.320 --> 00:51:47.960]   So there's this inception happening.
[00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:51.400]   But I'm really excited to learn more from people
[00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:52.600]   as they go about this.
[00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:57.640]   And I'm really looking forward to everyone's contributions.
[00:51:57.640 --> 00:51:58.520]   Yeah, me too.
[00:51:58.520 --> 00:52:03.720]   I'm absolutely stoked to see what you will all build
[00:52:03.720 --> 00:52:07.200]   and what you all will contribute and what your ideas are.
[00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:10.920]   And I'm sure there are tons of aspects of the hidden gems
[00:52:10.920 --> 00:52:13.480]   and of the connection to MetaKaggle
[00:52:13.480 --> 00:52:16.920]   or any other connections that I haven't thought of yet.
[00:52:16.920 --> 00:52:21.800]   And I'm really, really curious what all of you will discover.
[00:52:21.800 --> 00:52:23.040]   Awesome.
[00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:25.800]   Any final words before we wrap up?
[00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:34.080]   Just surprise us.
[00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:39.600]   Join the competition and just surprise us and blow us away
[00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:42.200]   with your creativity, with your insights,
[00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:46.720]   and with your passion for data science.
[00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:49.560]   Data scientists have proven Chai improves data analysis skills
[00:52:49.560 --> 00:52:50.640]   by 500%.
[00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:52.520]   Don't quote me on that.
[00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:55.640]   But remember to have Chai before creating your notebooks.
[00:52:55.640 --> 00:52:56.680]   And good luck, everyone.
[00:52:56.680 --> 00:53:00.240]   And thank you again, Martin, for joining us
[00:53:00.240 --> 00:53:01.360]   for the kickoff livestream.
[00:53:01.360 --> 00:53:03.640]   And thanks for everyone who's watching this live
[00:53:03.640 --> 00:53:06.200]   and for watching the recap.
[00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:08.000]   Thank you for all your help, Sanyam.
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:10.320]   I really appreciate it.
[00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:17.720]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
