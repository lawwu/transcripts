[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.200]   Welcome back everyone.
[00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.000]   This is part four in our series on presenting your work.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.240]   This is the final screencast in the series.
[00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.120]   We're going to be talking about giving talks,
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.000]   especially the talk that you might give
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.480]   at an NLP workshop or conference.
[00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.800]   I should say at the start that I'm going to give
[00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.280]   a lot of advice about how to give effective talks,
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.640]   but the only advice that I feel really confident in
[00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.120]   is that you should cultivate your own style as a speaker,
[00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.320]   and you should do that by giving talks and then really
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.480]   and truly reflecting on how it went,
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.280]   looking for ways you could do better,
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.240]   and then heading off in that direction.
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.040]   The precise direction that you go is highly individual.
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.680]   This will depend on your goals and your preferences
[00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.760]   and the style you're cultivating.
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.240]   But I can promise that if you do this act of self-reflection,
[00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.120]   you will become a better speaker.
[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.880]   It can be painful, but it is very productive.
[00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.120]   This also means that the advice that you do here about giving
[00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.240]   effective talks should always be filtered
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:04.320]   through this highly personal thing that you're trying to do.
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.640]   That said, let's dive in.
[00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.920]   I'm going to offer a bunch of advice.
[00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.400]   The first piece of advice I think
[00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.520]   is pretty straightforward.
[00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.600]   For the kind of academic talks that we're talking about,
[00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.520]   it's a good default to assume that the talk structure should
[00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.920]   mirror the paper structure, but the talk
[00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.560]   needs to be much simpler.
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.840]   You absolutely cannot convey all the detail
[00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.280]   that you packed into a paper.
[00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.240]   It's just the wrong mode for that.
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.680]   So what you can really hope for is
[00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.000]   that you find a way of talking about the ideas that
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.520]   conveys their essence, teaches the core lessons,
[00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.000]   and entices people to actually invest in all of the details
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.320]   that are in your paper.
[00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:40.760]   To do that, just as with the paper,
[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.160]   I think you should open with context setting.
[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.840]   What problem are you solving?
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.400]   Why is it important?
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.560]   And what's been tried before?
[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.000]   And why does it fall short?
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.040]   And if you do this context setting right,
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.080]   the audience will be really well set up
[00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.280]   to understand the essence of the talk.
[00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.720]   That's the middle part.
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.960]   You should do concrete details like what are the data, what
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.680]   are the metrics, things like that.
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.000]   What's the task structure?
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.560]   But really what you want to do is
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.600]   make sure that you convey the essence of your idea.
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.520]   What is your approach?
[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.320]   If it's a model or a metric or a task structure or something
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.440]   else, this is where you really shine a light on those ideas.
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.600]   And that should feel like the essence of the talk,
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.280]   the ideas behind your work.
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.480]   Having done that, you can kind of
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.760]   add some quantitative results to support what you did.
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.720]   You can talk about ablation studies
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.280]   and do error analyses and so forth.
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.560]   It can kind of branch out from there,
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.960]   assuming that you've done the job of really conveying
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.240]   the approach.
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.040]   And then finally, at the end, you'll
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.120]   want to quickly summarize.
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.360]   But also think ahead to the future.
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.760]   This is your opportunity to convey to people
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.000]   how they might build on the ideas, what
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.880]   the important open questions are,
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.400]   and why the work was ultimately significant.
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.840]   [TYPING]
[00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.120]   Jeff Pullum has what he calls golden rules for giving talks.
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.720]   He says there are five of them, but there are actually six.
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:01.760]   I like all these rules.
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.440]   I especially like five and six, but I
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.800]   thought I would offer all of them to you.
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.240]   The first one is don't ever begin with an apology.
[00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.360]   I think this is reasonable.
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.680]   I think the concern here is that if you start
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.560]   by apologizing for how bad the talk is going to be because you
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.200]   didn't prepare or whatever, people might believe you.
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.480]   Their impression of you might be that, in fact, you're
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.600]   about to give a very bad talk, and that
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:23.880]   could cause them to check out.
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.320]   And it could certainly shape their opinions
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.000]   of the talk they do here.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.160]   So start strong instead of starting with an apology.
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.920]   Don't ever underestimate the audience's intelligence.
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.600]   I think the spirit of this is that we've already
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.680]   baked in that we're going to give a simple version
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.160]   of the ideas we're trying to teach a core lesson.
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.880]   And with that in mind, you want to approach the audience
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.080]   as peers, people who might surprise you with new ideas,
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.720]   but certainly people who are equipped to understand
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:51.880]   what you're trying to do.
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.960]   And if you're in that mode, I think everyone
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:56.760]   will feel good and feel connected around what
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.880]   you're trying to do.
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.000]   Respect the time limits.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.400]   This is nice and concrete, and this is absolutely crucial.
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.080]   It is tragic when people use up all their time doing context
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.920]   setting, and they never get to describe their idea.
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.880]   The way to respect the time limits
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.560]   is to do a lot of practice.
[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.480]   I think there is no shortcut here.
[00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:16.400]   You should practice.
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.440]   You should watch yourself practicing,
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.560]   and you should find a way to fit the ideas in in a way that
[00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.040]   does what you want to do.
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.600]   If you don't practice, you are at serious risk
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.840]   of going way past the time limits.
[00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.400]   Don't survey the whole damn field.
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.000]   This aligns well with the advice I gave before.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.080]   What you want to do is provide context for your ideas,
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.640]   but it should be just the context
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.920]   we need in order to understand the essence of what
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:40.760]   you've done.
[00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.640]   And if you cast the net too widely, people will get lost,
[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.920]   and you might simply run out of time.
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.560]   And this one I really like.
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.160]   Remember that you're an advocate, not the defendant.
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.840]   The spirit of this is like you're a lawyer,
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.840]   and you're defending the ideas.
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.720]   You're invested in doing a good job,
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.360]   but you yourself are not on trial in any sense.
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.560]   And so this is like the right level of investment.
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.800]   It's not so personal, but you are, of course,
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.720]   trying to do the best thing that you can by the ideas
[00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.600]   that you're presenting.
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.160]   And then finally, expect questions that will floor you.
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.560]   On the assumption that you're talking to peers,
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.920]   very intelligent people, you've prepared
[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.080]   for the discussion section.
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.520]   We'll talk about that a bit later.
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.640]   But even having done that, surprising things can happen.
[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.720]   That's part of the reason that we're giving talks
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.720]   for the exploratory aspect, to learn new things.
[00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.080]   So you should expect questions that
[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.560]   are surprising and hard to resolve,
[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.840]   maybe questions that even terrify you.
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:41.200]   That should be considered part of the exploratory educational
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.000]   thing that you are doing.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   On top of all of that, I really like
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.760]   to return to Patrick Blackburn's fundamental insight
[00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:49.840]   about talks.
[00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.160]   I mentioned this before in the context of writing.
[00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.160]   Blackburn intended it to be about talks.
[00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:56.640]   It applies everywhere.
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.040]   He asks, where do good talks come from?
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:00.640]   And he says, honesty.
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.520]   A good talk should never stray far
[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:05.120]   from simple, honest communication.
[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.800]   I like to think of this in the context of education.
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.120]   The goal of the talk is not to broadcast ideas
[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.200]   or to advertise, but rather to educate.
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:17.520]   And if you approach it from the perspective of genuinely trying
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.760]   to teach your ideas to your audience,
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.640]   I think you'll be in the right place.
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.000]   You'll connect with them.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.920]   And they'll take those further steps
[00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:28.160]   of checking out the paper and more deeply understanding
[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.320]   what you've done.
[00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.320]   People joke about PowerPoint.
[00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:36.160]   And they worry about the kind of distorting effects
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.800]   that it can have on the way we present our ideas.
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.720]   I think it's reasonable to be a bit worried.
[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.160]   But obviously, I'm not too worried
[00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.040]   because this entire course is based in screencasts
[00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:49.920]   where I'm using slides, PowerPoint-style things.
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:53.440]   But we do need to be thoughtful about how we use this device.
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:56.680]   As you read about advice for talks,
[00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:00.400]   you see kind of two camps emerge, the minimalist
[00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:01.880]   and the comparative.
[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:03.800]   The minimalist view is that your slide
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.280]   should be as spare as possible.
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:08.480]   The audience should spend most of the time
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:11.200]   listening to you and looking at you.
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.640]   Individual slides don't stay up for long.
[00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:15.960]   And they don't get used in more than one way.
[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:19.320]   They're kind of just punctuation to the talk track.
[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:21.960]   You could compare that with the comparative view.
[00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:23.920]   Your slide should be as full as possible
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:26.000]   without sacrificing clarity.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.360]   Your talk should make it easy for people to spend time
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.080]   studying your slides.
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:32.440]   Individual slides stay up for a long time
[00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:35.160]   and get used to make multiple comparisons
[00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:38.080]   and establish numerous connections.
[00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:40.040]   I'll talk a little bit in a second
[00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:43.200]   about how I think these approaches compare to each other,
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:45.800]   how this relates to style and to your goals.
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:48.920]   The one thing I will say here now
[00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:52.040]   is that whatever your camp is, this slide
[00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:54.480]   is making a colossal mistake.
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:57.520]   The mistake it makes is that I put all the information up
[00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:58.280]   all at once.
[00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:01.120]   And I know that that means that for the most of the time
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:04.000]   that I was talking, a lot of you were reading around
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:04.680]   on the slide.
[00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.600]   And we got disconnected.
[00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.360]   What I should have done is show you
[00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:10.920]   the information in the order I presented it
[00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:14.400]   so that you were with me as I was giving my talk track.
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:17.200]   Whether the slide is simple or complex,
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:19.240]   I feel like that has to be good advice,
[00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:24.240]   because this is a lot about joint attention.
[00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:26.800]   But whether you're a minimalist or a comparativist
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:29.320]   is really going to be a personal matter.
[00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:32.520]   The minimalist view seems right to me for telling a story.
[00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:34.880]   It's often the best mode when time is of the essence
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:37.880]   and the audience is mainly there to learn at a high level
[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:40.080]   about what your paper contains.
[00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:43.760]   Whereas the comparative view seems right to me for teaching.
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:47.360]   It's the closest slides come to a full, well-organized chalk
[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:47.880]   board.
[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:50.040]   Good advice for a chalk board is that you never
[00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:52.800]   erase things until you absolutely have to,
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:54.600]   because you might need them later.
[00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:55.680]   Same thing with a slide.
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:57.800]   If you can get a lot of information up there
[00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:59.560]   when it's still perspicuous, then you'll
[00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:02.960]   have lots of chances to do comparisons, answer questions,
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:06.080]   and fundamentally to educate.
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:08.080]   Find the style that works for you, though.
[00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:10.040]   As long as you think long and hard about what
[00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:11.680]   it will be like to listen to your talk
[00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:13.600]   and you make adjustments, you'll shine.
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:16.480]   You will become a better speaker in whatever mode
[00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:20.160]   you feel is a good way for you.
[00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.440]   Guiding audience attention is crucial, though.
[00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:25.440]   That's the joke that I made before about my over-full slide
[00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:26.960]   with no overlays.
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:30.000]   Use overlays to fill a slide while still keeping
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   the audience with you.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.200]   This is how you can be a comparativist while not losing
[00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:36.480]   the attention of the audience.
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:39.160]   Color used systematically to create distinctions
[00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:42.040]   is wonderful, as long as you're sure that the colors really
[00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:45.720]   do create contrast that will survive color blindness
[00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.920]   from your audience members and also really poor projectors,
[00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:50.840]   which can be quite a problem.
[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:54.160]   Size is great to draw attention to things.
[00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:58.160]   Boxes, arrows, and other devices help people navigate plots,
[00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:01.320]   especially model diagrams, long prose statements,
[00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:02.360]   and so forth.
[00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:04.960]   It's incredibly helpful to put boxes
[00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:07.160]   around the part of a results table
[00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:09.800]   or the part of a model diagram that you are talking about
[00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:13.160]   in the order that you talk about it so that people know exactly
[00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:15.960]   where to look as you make your crucial points.
[00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:18.160]   These devices are absolutely wonderful.
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:20.520]   In the minimalist mode, I guess you would say,
[00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:24.760]   overlays, color, size, boxes, arrows.
[00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:27.800]   I honestly find this really hard to track
[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:28.840]   a lot of the time.
[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:31.080]   I understand that it's kind of dynamic feeling,
[00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:33.000]   but you can tell in the way I'm talking
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.520]   that I am more of a comparativist
[00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:38.440]   than a minimalist when it comes to slides.
[00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:40.840]   Let's wrap up with some more mundane things.
[00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:45.000]   Turn off notifications that might appear on your screen.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.880]   If you get up in front of thousands of people
[00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:50.880]   at an ACL conference to give an important talk,
[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:52.080]   it's your moment to shine.
[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:54.120]   You do not want personal messages
[00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:57.200]   flashing by as notifications in the upper corner
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:57.880]   of your screen.
[00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:59.600]   Shut those down.
[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:02.080]   Make sure your computer is out of power save mode
[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:05.000]   so that the screen doesn't shut down while you're talking.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.520]   The most tragic thing here is that you step away
[00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:10.040]   from the computer to make a point.
[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:12.800]   You're doing that long enough that the screen shuts down,
[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:15.080]   and then the projector won't come back,
[00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:18.080]   and you lose many minutes of your allotted time
[00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:20.640]   just trying to get the projector to cooperate.
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:21.640]   So sad.
[00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:23.440]   Just make sure your screen doesn't do that,
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:25.200]   and you'll be better off.
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:27.720]   Shut down running applications that might get in your way.
[00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:29.760]   They could eat up memory and cause problems,
[00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:32.920]   or they could just start to ask that you update them
[00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:35.520]   or some other needy thing right in the middle of the talk,
[00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:36.920]   and it could distract everyone.
[00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:39.360]   And you might not notice the little bouncing icon
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:43.960]   that everyone is now studying instead of listening to you.
[00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:46.320]   Make sure your desktop is clear of files and notes
[00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:48.040]   that you wouldn't want the world to see.
[00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:51.120]   Again, imagine you're up in front of thousands of people.
[00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:52.720]   They are definitely going to study
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:55.600]   whatever they can see of your desktop as they sit idly
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:57.040]   waiting for your talk to start
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:58.720]   or whatever else is happening.
[00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:00.000]   Make sure that's information
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.360]   that you want everyone to be looking at.
[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:06.200]   And if you're using PowerPoint or Keynote or Google Slides
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:07.560]   or some specialized software
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.760]   that might depend on having net access,
[00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:13.400]   make a PDF backup so that it's there just in case.
[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:16.400]   And really the ultimate in survival here,
[00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:17.600]   projectors can fail,
[00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:20.760]   so you should be prepared to give the talk
[00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:22.120]   without any slides.
[00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:24.920]   The audience will be on your side if you have to do this.
[00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:27.040]   It's a real opportunity to shine.
[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:31.560]   Be ready to do it as a talk track alone.
[00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:33.880]   And then finally, the discussion period.
[00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:36.200]   This is often the most anxiety-producing part
[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:37.640]   of giving any talk.
[00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:39.520]   It's very important.
[00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:41.600]   It should be the chance for the audience
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:44.280]   to gain a deeper understanding of your ideas.
[00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:47.240]   And when that is the spirit of the audience,
[00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:48.640]   this is wonderful.
[00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:50.280]   You really feel like you're engaged
[00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:53.720]   in a new kind of exploration and education.
[00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:56.760]   Sometimes, though, other things do happen.
[00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:59.880]   Hostile questioners, confused questioners,
[00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:01.680]   people who won't give up the floor,
[00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:06.120]   all of that other stuff that can be so anxiety-producing.
[00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:07.840]   You have to live with that.
[00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:09.200]   When people ask questions,
[00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:11.480]   my standard advice is to pause for a second
[00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:15.040]   before answering each one, if you can possibly help it.
[00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:17.040]   That will make sure that they're done talking,
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:19.160]   and it will also make you appear deliberative.
[00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:20.360]   And I think that's always good
[00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:23.360]   in terms of honoring the contributions people make.
[00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:25.880]   I grant that you've thought about the ideas forever.
[00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:27.680]   You might know what answer you want to give
[00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:29.640]   from word one from this person,
[00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:31.520]   but at least keep up the pretense
[00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:33.040]   that you are actively listening.
[00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:34.680]   You might be surprised,
[00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:37.920]   and also you want to honor the contributions of these people.
[00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:42.040]   Avoid saying, "I have no idea," and leaving it at that.
[00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:44.520]   You can probably get away with doing that once
[00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:46.800]   if it's a really blazing insight.
[00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:48.520]   But ideally, you say something like,
[00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:51.680]   "I have no idea, but let's think in this direction,"
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:54.160]   or, "Let's meditate on this possible extension,"
[00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:56.680]   or whatever it is to create a discourse again,
[00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:59.360]   'cause that's, after all, the goal of these things.
[00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:03.280]   Most questions won't make total sense to you.
[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:04.920]   You've thought about the ideas a lot.
[00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:07.000]   Your questioner may be entirely new to them,
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.640]   and they might be struggling as part of their question
[00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:12.640]   to figure out exactly how to come to grips with the ideas.
[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:13.920]   So you have to work with that
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:16.720]   and find a way for this to feel productive.
[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:20.080]   You'll be a hit if you can warp every question,
[00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:22.440]   whether confused or not, hostile or not,
[00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:25.040]   whatever it is, into one that makes sense
[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:26.640]   and leaves everyone with the impression
[00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:29.400]   that the questioner raised an important issue.
[00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:31.360]   Then everyone will feel validated.
[00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:33.440]   You'll feel like you've connected with people,
[00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:36.240]   and they'll feel like they connected with you.
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:38.720]   Notice that I have called this the discussion period.
[00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:41.280]   It's often called the Q&A period.
[00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:42.880]   I think that's a misnomer.
[00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:44.960]   It's really not about question and answer.
[00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:46.080]   It's about discussion.
[00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:47.520]   And if you ease into that mode,
[00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:50.000]   I think you'll overall feel more satisfied
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.880]   by these experiences,
[00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:54.000]   recognizing, though, that sometimes
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.840]   they kind of do go off the rails.
[00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:58.440]   (upbeat music)
[00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:00.500]   you
