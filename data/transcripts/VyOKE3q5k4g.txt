[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.900]   In the last podcast, in episode 65, you explained and defined strong feminine
[00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.540]   womanhood. It seems like theology plays a really important role in this strength.
[00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.680]   Explain that more, Pastor John, what role does theology play in cultivating strong
[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:26.200]   biblical womanhood? Absolutely. I did preach on that one time, thank you Nancy
[00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:33.760]   DeMoss for having me, and my theme was "Wimpy Theology Makes Wimpy Women," and I
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:39.520]   believe that with all my heart. When I, over the time that I've preached here at
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:45.560]   Bethlehem, 32 years, one of the deeply gratifying things for me is that
[00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:53.520]   alongside a spiritually mature, biblically informed, humble, Christlike
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:05.760]   male eldership, there has risen up an army of intelligent, articulate, mature,
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:14.120]   Bible-saturated, God-centered, Christ-exalting, strong women who partner
[00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:20.080]   with the men of the Church to get the ministry of family and society done. And
[00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:27.880]   that happens because we don't think in terms of men should be taught
[00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.040]   deep, rich, solid, life-transforming theology, and women, they should be taught
[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:40.360]   something else. No way! They both should be thinking, meditating, reading, and
[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.680]   growing. They both have brains. Women's brains are usually, I want to say, sharper
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.080]   than men's brains, at least in my experience. I have zero reason to think
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.120]   they're anything otherwise. I mean, I tell the little story that in high school, I
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:02.480]   think I was 19th in my class, and all the people in front of me, grade-wise, were
[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:10.480]   women. Girls, I called girls, but women. And then I went to Wheaton, and the curve in
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:14.480]   all the classes was slaughtered by the women, because they were all so smart. It's
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.440]   harder for a woman to get into Wheaton than for a guy, so they're all smarter than
[00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:23.640]   guys. And so all my life, my mom, I think, was smarter than my dad, and all the, you
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.720]   know, the girls in my high school class were smarter than me, and
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.080]   then at Wheaton, it was the girls who wrecked everything. So as far as mental
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:39.320]   capacity for grasping theology, there is zero reason why we shouldn't seek for
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:46.120]   the women of our Church to be as fully taught and as articulate and intelligent
[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.880]   in their grasp of God's glory as the men. Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for
[00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.880]   listening to this podcast. You can find Pastor John's message, "The Ultimate
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.240]   Meaning of True Womanhood," from the 2008 True Woman Conference online at
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.360]   DesiringGod.org. And I'll finish out this podcast with a 40-second clip from
[00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:13.440]   that message. Thanks for listening. Wimpy theology does not give a woman, a God, big
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:20.600]   enough, strong enough, wise enough, good enough to handle the realities of life
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:28.120]   in a way that enables her to magnify Him and His Son all the time. It's not big
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:34.760]   enough. Wimpy theology doesn't have a granite foundation of God's sovereignty
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:40.760]   underneath. It doesn't have the steel structure of a great God-centered purpose
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:46.760]   for all of human existence, including the worst of it.
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.520]   (Thanks for watching)
