[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.520]   The following historic recording by Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones
[00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:08.720]   dates from the earliest days of tape recording and was actually recorded on paper tape.
[00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:14.160]   However, it has been digitally restored and although the quality is not to modern standards,
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.880]   we hope that you will find it to be a great blessing.
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:23.200]   As with all Dr. Lloyd-Jones sermons, its relevance for these modern times is undiminished.
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.680]   What we said on that occasion, because it is essential
[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.080]   as an introduction to what we are going to do this morning,
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.760]   we suggested that there are many people who fail in the Christian life because
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.880]   they have never yet awakened to the fact that they are involved in a spiritual warfare.
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:46.000]   The writer of the hymn we have just been singing understood that well,
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.600]   he starts off, "Therefore, Christian, seek not yet repose; cast thy dreams of ease away."
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.520]   So many think that the moment you are converted or take some kind of decision,
[00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.440]   that that is the end, you have finished, the things happen to you, and from there on,
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:11.680]   it is going to be a perfectly easy and eventful life, everything happens for you and everything
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:17.520]   is done for you, you recline on your bank or bed of roses and there are no more problems.
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.760]   Ease. And we considered why people sometimes have that notion of the Christian life,
[00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.680]   fundamentally, of course, it is due to an ignorance of the scriptures.
[00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.200]   No man who has read the scriptures could ever hold that view,
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.880]   for the scriptures tell us everywhere, as they tell us here, that we are involved
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:44.720]   and are participators in a tremendous spiritual conflict. All these forces that the apostle
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:51.840]   mentions here are arrayed against the forces of God and of his Christ, and their one concern is
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:58.560]   to defeat Christians. And obviously, if a Christian is not aware of this spiritual realm and this
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.880]   spiritual subtlety, he is already defeated. A man who does not even know this, a man who is not
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.120]   aware that he is in a fight, is a man who is defeated, so defeated that he is blind, he does
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:16.720]   not know. So we emphasize that, and then we emphasize the terrible subtlety of the conflict.
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:26.320]   The wiles of the wicked one, the way he misleads us and trips us and fools us and gets us down
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:31.440]   without our knowing that anything has happened at all. Oh, everything we are told about the devil
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:37.040]   in the Bible emphasizes this element of subtlety, his ingratiating character. Indeed, he can come
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.920]   as an angel of light, he can quote scripture, he can encourage us to do Christian work, as long as
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:47.360]   he is keeping us where he wants us in some other respect. He often does so, so that people go on
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.000]   happy that everything is right because they are active in Christian work and not aware of some
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.920]   terrible sin that is in their lives at that very moment. He can transform himself into an angel of
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:06.720]   light. His subtlety, his ingenuity, his malignity are beyond description. Here the apostle warns
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:13.760]   us against all that. But thank God he does not stop at mere warning. He goes on to tell us that
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.560]   there is a way of victory. That is why he writes, he would not have written but for that.
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:24.800]   Finally, my brethren, he says, be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might.
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:31.760]   You need not be defeated, he says. There is a way of overcoming him. There is a way to be
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:39.200]   victorious. And again I say, many fail because they do not realize that. There are those who
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.160]   think of the Christian life as a life for which it can be said that you just live perpetually to
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:51.680]   scorn delights and live laborious days. It is not that. That is quite wrong again. It is as
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:58.320]   wrong as that first misconception of reclining on the bank of Rosiots. No, no, there is a victory
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:05.280]   possible. But it is in the Lord and in the power of his might, the energy, the vigor of his strength.
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:14.400]   And then we ended on this note, that perhaps the most frequent cause of failure of all is this,
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:21.040]   is our failure to understand exactly how that strength and might become ours.
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:28.880]   How we can avail ourselves of the strength of the Lord and the power of his might. Now that
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:34.160]   in particular, as I understand this paragraph, is the thing that it emphasizes most of all.
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:41.280]   I put it like this in a closing word. So often when you talk to people about these difficulties,
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.400]   about this spiritual conflict, about the assaults and the attacks of the devil,
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:52.320]   which I described in detail last Sunday morning, we took it as he attacks the body, as he attacks
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:57.440]   the mind, and as he attacks the heart and the will. He attacks us everywhere and there is no
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:04.000]   limit to it. Now I was suggesting that perhaps our main trouble is due to the fact that we do not
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:11.760]   know how to avail ourselves of this power. And when you discuss these various problems and forms
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.680]   of attacks with people, and you say to them, "Well now, what does the one do about this?"
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:22.000]   Almost invariably the answer you'll be given is just this. They say, "All you need to do is to
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.240]   pray about it. Pray about it." But you see, that isn't what the Apostle Paul says.
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:34.000]   The Apostle Paul does mention prayer, but you noticed where it came, didn't you? It came at
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.640]   the end of the paragraph, not at the beginning. Paul, in helping these Ephesians, doesn't say,
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:43.200]   "Well now, you've got great problems. All you need to do is to go on praying." No, before he tells
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:49.600]   them to pray, the Apostle tells them to take unto themselves the whole armor, the full panoply
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:56.880]   of God, the armor that God provides. And indeed, he isn't content even with a general statement
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:03.280]   there. He takes the trouble to take us through it piece by piece and bit by bit and tell us how to
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:10.320]   put it on. Now, I'm suggesting that there are large numbers of people who are in great trouble and
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:16.000]   distress simply because they've either never read this paragraph, or if they've read it, they haven't
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.320]   looked at it. They've assumed that they needn't pay attention to it, that as long as they're
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:26.400]   praying, all is well, and they've never done this. And yet, you see, this is how the Apostle tells us
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:30.080]   that the strength and the might of the Lord becomes available to us.
[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:37.520]   In other words, let me put it like this. In this conflict, in this battle,
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:43.360]   there are two things that are absolutely essential. The first is that we must have
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:48.960]   this strength and power that the Lord alone can give us. But in addition to that, we need to be
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:55.280]   clothed with this armor. Or, if you like it the other way around, it's equally good. The armor of
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:07:01.840]   God will be valueless to us unless we have the strength and the power that he alone can give
[00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:08.720]   to enable us to use it. So, you see, it isn't praying only, it isn't the armor only, it's
[00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:15.920]   putting on the armor with prayer. The hymn puts it, "Put on the gospel armor, each piece put on
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:22.880]   with prayer." That's it. And our tragedy always is that we are either/or instead of both/and.
[00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:30.560]   It isn't only praying, it's all this as well. But it isn't this alone, there must be the prayer
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:36.640]   that links us to him and gives us the power to use the armor. Well now then, that seems to me to be
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:44.000]   the way in which the Apostle tells us that we can not only fight in this spiritual conflict with all
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:50.640]   its devilish, fiendish subtlety, and oh how evident and rampant it is at this present time,
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:55.680]   how easily duped God's people are, satisfied by one side forgetting the other,
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:08:02.800]   not looking at themselves as a whole. Now then, I say the way to overcome and the way to be
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:09.520]   triumphant is to heed carefully the Apostle's teaching and his advice. And this morning I
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:16.240]   want in particular to look at this question of the armor, the whole armor of God, and to try to
[00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:22.800]   understand together what he means by it. Now the controlling principle it seems to me in expounding
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:31.920]   this armor is that we must always forget that it is the whole armor of God. It isn't something human.
[00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:37.280]   I mustn't digress, but let me indicate in a passing hurried word what I mean by this.
[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:45.600]   It seems to me that the whole error of what we may describe as the Catholic conception of holiness
[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:49.520]   is due to the fact that they've never paid heed to this particular paragraph.
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:55.840]   How do the Roman Catholics and other Catholics fight this battle, this problem of sin within
[00:08:55.840 --> 00:09:01.280]   and without? Well, you notice their method generally is the method of monasticism,
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:07.760]   going out of the world, giving up certain things, isolating yourself. You've got to be religious,
[00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:12.800]   as they say, and they mean by that a technical term. You go out of business and its affairs,
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:19.520]   and you give your whole life to being religious. Or it may include feast days and fast days and
[00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:24.880]   the observance of Lent and things like that. That's their method. Now that's not the apostle's
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:29.840]   method. Indeed, this apostle denounces that method, you remember, in the second chapter of
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:37.360]   his epistle to the Colossians. Those people, he says, who observe days and new moons and
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:43.840]   fastings and things like that, "Let no man beguile you," he says, "of your reward in a voluntary
[00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:49.040]   humility and worshipping of angels, including into those things which he hath not seen,
[00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:54.880]   and not holding the head from which the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered
[00:09:54.880 --> 00:10:01.040]   and knit together increaseth with the increase of God." Therefore, he says, "If he be dead with
[00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:05.840]   Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are he subject to
[00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:11.520]   ordinances, touch not, taste not, handle not, which all are to perish with the using, after the
[00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:17.600]   commandments and doctrines of men." Now, he says, that kind of thing has a show of wisdom in will
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:24.800]   worship and in humility and in neglecting the body. But it's not God's way at all. Now, that
[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:30.320]   is to fight this battle in an earthly and in a human manner. That isn't the apostle's way.
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:39.040]   His method is, I say, to take unto us the whole armor of God. Now then, let's look at it.
[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:45.440]   The first thing, obviously, we must emphasize is this word "whole." We need it all.
[00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:54.560]   We need every part of it. We can't afford to neglect a single piece. That's why I say he
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:58.240]   goes into these details. He says, "The whole," and then, in order to make certain that we take
[00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:02.640]   the whole, he says, "You take this, that, and the other. The whole armor of God."
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:09.840]   Am I conveying, I wonder, the sense of urgency to you? Are you aware, my friend, of the danger in
[00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:14.480]   which you are at this very moment, simply because you're a Christian? The moment you become a
[00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:20.480]   Christian, you become a special object of the devil's attack, if he can mar and ruin and spoil
[00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:25.120]   and ridicule the work of Christ, how pleased he is. So, the moment you become a Christian,
[00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:32.080]   all this is played upon you and focused upon you. And therefore, I say, we should all realize
[00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:38.000]   this tension, this state of warfare, and realize that we need nothing less
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:46.080]   than the whole armor of God. It means the armor that God provides.
[00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:54.880]   And that is, again, another very vital principle. You read the great commentators on this section,
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:12:00.320]   and you'll find that they disagree over certain parts, as I'm going to show you in a moment.
[00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:04.960]   And it seems to me that the disagreement is generally due to the fact that some of them
[00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:12.960]   have not observed that it is the whole armor of God. Something that is provided for us by God in
[00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:18.720]   its entirety, from beginning to end, all you and I do is to put it on. It isn't something we've
[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:25.680]   produced or manufactured. It is presented to us, it's offered us, it's given. And we put it on,
[00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:32.400]   and we use it by the strength that he supplies us. Well, now then, having dealt with it in that way,
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:38.720]   let us have a look at some of these portions and pieces of the armor. What is the first thing?
[00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:45.840]   Well, here he is, he's coming to details. "Stand, therefore," he says, and you won't be able to
[00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:52.880]   stand if you haven't got this armor on. "Stand, therefore, having your lines," that's the first
[00:12:52.880 --> 00:13:03.120]   thing, "girt about with truth." Now, you read about this ancient armor, and you'll find they're
[00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:09.360]   all agreed in saying that you must start with the part that goes upon the girdle. It was the
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:15.200]   first thing to do. It's there that the clothing is held together, and everything is kept in position,
[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:21.600]   so that if the girdle isn't right, nothing's going to be right. You must start with the foundation,
[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:30.400]   with the basic thing. And here it is. Now, it seems to me that you can classify this
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:38.480]   description of this armor very conveniently into three groups. There is, first of all,
[00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:47.520]   what I would kind of describe as the general basis. If you like, the integument, that which
[00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:55.040]   actually is upon your body. And there are three pieces there. The part that goes about the line,
[00:13:55.040 --> 00:14:05.440]   and the breastplate, and the covering of the feet. Then the second group consists of two things,
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:16.240]   which are more specifically weapons of defense. The shield and the helmet. And finally, there is
[00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:21.840]   a weapon which is more or less offensive, and that is the sword. Now, bearing that general
[00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:32.000]   classification in mind, we start, I say, with the lines girded with truth. Now, this is obviously
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:38.320]   something which is quite basic and fundamental. If this isn't right, says Paul, and if this isn't in
[00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:43.120]   position, it's no use putting on the other pieces. They won't hold their positions. And when you need
[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:49.280]   them in a subtle moment, they'll fall off from you. You must put the foundation on. All the other
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:54.400]   clothing is going to fit onto this, and to be held in position by it. So you must take exceptional
[00:14:54.400 --> 00:15:01.440]   care with this. What is it, then? Well, he says, it is truth. Now, then what does he mean by this?
[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:08.720]   This girdle of truth? Well, at this point, you'll find that some of the commentators will tell you
[00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:18.000]   that it means sincerity. It means our truthfulness. They then go on, of course, to explain that in
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.920]   the Christian life, everything is vain if we are not honest, if we are not sincere, if we are not
[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:28.640]   truthful. They say you can't begin to fight the enemy if you've got a lie in your heart, or if
[00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:34.480]   there's a contradiction in you. No, no, they say the first thing is absolute truthfulness, sincerity,
[00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:40.960]   and honesty. Well, of course, we agree entirely that sincerity and truthfulness and honesty are
[00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:46.080]   absolute essentials. But it seems to me abundantly clear that the apostle didn't mean that.
[00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:52.160]   Because all that is something that I'm responsible for. That is something that I produce.
[00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:58.560]   Whereas Paul is talking about the armor of God, the armor that God supplies, something that's
[00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:04.160]   given to me by God. It isn't some inward state or condition of mine. Again, I say, let's be
[00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:10.240]   truthful. We must be, and sincere. But if you're relying upon your own sincerity to defend yourself
[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:15.360]   against the devil, well, I assure you, you'll be defeated immediately. Thank God it isn't that.
[00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:22.640]   Well, what is it then? Well, here it seems to me quite inevitably that the apostle is referring
[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:32.960]   to the truth. The truth. And especially to my appropriation of the truth.
[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:41.840]   Very well, then, what he's saying is this. That in our battle and our conflict with the devil,
[00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:52.000]   the first thing that is absolutely essential is that I should accept the revealed truth of God.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.840]   For without it, I am already defeated.
[00:16:55.840 --> 00:17:04.480]   The whole basis of my standing and my position is that I base my whole outlook on life
[00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:10.400]   upon the revelation of God's truth, which I've got in this world. I put it on.
[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:15.440]   Now, what does he mean by that? Well, he means something like this, doesn't he?
[00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:21.520]   It's not enough that I've had a certain experience.
[00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:28.720]   Oh yes, experiences are valuable, they're essential. And we must have experience. If we've
[00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:33.440]   got nothing experimental in our lives, we're not Christians. Yes, but if you think it's only
[00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:39.680]   experience, well, then you're in the most dangerous position conceivable. You may feel happy as a
[00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:44.160]   result of an experience, but as certainly as you feel happy in our day will come when you'll not be
[00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:48.880]   happy. The devil will see to that. And if you're relying upon an experience or your feelings,
[00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:55.280]   you're bound to go down. My friend, the basis of defense against the devil is truth.
[00:17:55.280 --> 00:18:05.200]   The revealed truth of God. What is this? Well, it means the whole truth. Not portions of truth,
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:12.240]   but the whole truth. In other words, I've got to base my whole life and my activity in life
[00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:20.400]   upon the right view of God, in his holiness, in his righteousness, in all his perfections. Yes,
[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:26.640]   in his wrath, in all his glory. God. And I know nothing about God apart from this revelation,
[00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:34.800]   which I have in this book. I accept the revelation. Truth. And then the truth about myself.
[00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:44.560]   The truth about sin. And again, you see, I don't know these things apart from the revelation,
[00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:51.680]   which I have in this book. By nature, I think I'm a good fellow. I can explain my deficiencies
[00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:57.600]   and my shortcomings away. It's only when I come to this revealed truth that I'm given to understand
[00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:04.240]   that in me, that is to say, in my flesh dwelleth no good. Who can know it? That man in sin is
[00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:10.880]   a vile creature and that he's like that because of the fall. Now I need to know all that. How can
[00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:16.720]   I possibly fight the devil unless I realize that the devil is as powerful as this, that he went to
[00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:21.600]   the first men who'd been created in the image of God and who was perfect and got him down.
[00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:29.200]   And if he got down that perfect men who would come out of the hands of God in all his glory,
[00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:35.280]   how much more easily can he get me down who I'm born in sin and shapen in iniquity.
[00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:40.560]   My friends, you must know the truth if you want to fight the devil. It's basic,
[00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:45.440]   it's foundational, it's fundamental. Without this truth, you can't stand.
[00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:49.680]   And then we must go on to the way of salvation
[00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:55.040]   and realize that it was only possible in Christ.
[00:19:57.040 --> 00:20:02.960]   That the problem of sin, the problem of the control and the dominion of Satan is so profound
[00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:07.360]   that he took the son of God himself to come into the world from heaven before it could be solved.
[00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:12.400]   So that the problem of sin is not an easy one, it's a tremendously difficult one,
[00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:16.000]   as difficult as that. Now it's only truth that enables me to know that.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:21.760]   It's only by knowing truth that I measure the might and the power of the devil. In other words,
[00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:27.840]   what we need, my friend, is doctrine. The doctrines of the Bible, the things we're not interested in.
[00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:31.760]   And it's because we're not interested in doctrines, we're all failing as we are.
[00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:37.280]   But it's truth, and this is truth. These great foundational,
[00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:41.760]   fundamental doctrines of the Christian faith. Then go on to judgment.
[00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:46.960]   And remember that judgment must begin at the house of God.
[00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:53.440]   We're all clear about the judgment of the ungodly, but judgment must begin at the house of God.
[00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:59.120]   "Let him that thinketh, he standeth; take heed, lest he fall."
[00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:05.680]   How often do we consider this aspect of truth? We preach judgment to the ungodly outside,
[00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:10.480]   how often do we preach it to ourselves? We must all appear before the judgment throne of Christ
[00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:13.520]   and give an account of the deeds done in the body, every one of us.
[00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:25.680]   And heaven and hell, and all the great foundational doctrines of this most holy faith of ours.
[00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:33.120]   Now what the apostle says is this, that there must be no hesitation at all in us with respect
[00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:40.080]   to these doctrines. We must accept them fully, we must commit ourselves to them essentially.
[00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:45.200]   They must be the controlling factor in the whole of our life.
[00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:50.640]   Guard yourselves, get the lines fixed and established with truth.
[00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:56.480]   I could very easily keep you for the remainder of the time in showing you how the scriptures
[00:21:56.480 --> 00:22:00.800]   in various places teach us plainly that it's because men don't realize this they fall.
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:06.560]   Did you notice what Peter said in that third chapter of his second epistle which we read just
[00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:16.000]   now? He is referring to these great epistles of Paul and he's reminding these people that the
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.080]   apostle has dealt with these great problems and he wants them to read them. He says, "I know
[00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:23.520]   that there are certain things in them which are difficult to understand."
[00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:30.160]   Because truth, you know, can be difficult. You've got to have a spiritual mind and you've got to be
[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:35.200]   diligent and you've got to give yourself to it if you want to grasp it. And Peter says, "There are
[00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:38.560]   many things therefore in the epistles of Paul which are very hard to be grasped and to be
[00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:47.840]   understood, which the unlearned and unstable rest, as they do the other scriptures also,
[00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:53.520]   to their own destruction." You can rest the scriptures to your own destruction.
[00:22:53.520 --> 00:23:00.800]   You can misuse truth and it'll be your damnation. You'll give yourself an ease and a peace which
[00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:06.240]   isn't true because you're twisting the scriptures and you rest it to your own destruction. But you
[00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:12.000]   notice the way in which he puts it. Who are the people who do this? He says, "They are the
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:20.320]   unlearned." And the people who are always unstable are the unlearned. The type of Christian who's
[00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:26.560]   carried about by every wind of doctrine, who runs after the latest craze or the latest fashion,
[00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:31.280]   he's always an ignorant Christian. They are the people who are carried about by
[00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:35.440]   every wind of doctrine and the cunning craftiness and the slight of men.
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:39.760]   "They're unstable," says Peter. Why? "Well, they're unlearned. They don't know the truth."
[00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:46.080]   And it is because so many Christians in this age are unlearned and are not interested in truth
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:50.160]   in this vital sense, are just content with what they wanted. They want peace of conscience and
[00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:58.880]   want no more. And they're unstable because they're unlearned. And they're therefore dupes and victims
[00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:06.160]   of Satan. Oh, our Lord himself had said it before Peter even thought of it. He said, "If he continue
[00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:14.000]   in my word, then are he my disciples indeed." Who is he talking to? He's talking to people who've
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   just expressed belief in him. They just said that they believed in him. As he spake these words,
[00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:26.800]   many believed in him. Then said he unto them that believed in him, "If he continue in my word,
[00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:34.720]   then are he my disciples indeed. And he shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free."
[00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:40.800]   It's the truth that frees, frees from the assaults of the devil and from everything
[00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:47.040]   that cripples us in our battle against it. But if we don't know the truth, how can we be free?
[00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:51.360]   And the very people to whom he uttered those words didn't accept that truth. And he in a few
[00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:57.680]   moments is referring to them as, "Ye are of your father the devil." Though they thought they
[00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:03.920]   believed in him. It's the truth, my friends, that makes us free. Well, you know, this is a trouble
[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:09.840]   which one finds constantly in the scriptures. Take the church at Corinth, for instance.
[00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:16.880]   Paul has to write that first epistle to them. Some of them were even beginning to doubt the
[00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:22.880]   actuality of the resurrection. They were becoming shaky about doctrines. Like many a modern man,
[00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:27.920]   they were saying doctrines don't matter as long as you're a Christian, and so on. But the apostle
[00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:32.320]   writes that great 15th chapter of the first epistle to them. And this is what he says,
[00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:41.680]   "Evil communications corrupt good manners." Evil communications, wrong doctrine. False ideas,
[00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:47.040]   wrong teaching. "This isn't trivial," says Paul. "If you believe in wrong teaching,
[00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:52.000]   your life is soon going to show it. Evil communications corrupt good manners."
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:57.280]   So it's vital that you should be clear, he says, about these doctrines. You can't say,
[00:25:57.280 --> 00:26:00.720]   "Well, it doesn't matter what a man believes as long as he lives the life." You can't live the
[00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:06.160]   life if you don't believe correctly. And then take the author of the epistle to the Hebrews. He says
[00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:12.560]   exactly the same thing. Here are these Hebrew Christians in trouble, some of them even looking
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:17.920]   back with longing eyes on Judaism, wondering whether they hadn't been a bit precipitate in
[00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:23.040]   believing in Christ and leaving that old religion. They were looking back, they were shaky, they were
[00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:28.960]   all in a very terribly dangerous position on the edge of a precipice. Now what's the matter with
[00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:34.720]   them? Well, the apostle tells us at the end of the fifth chapter that the real trouble with them was
[00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:41.920]   this, that they hadn't exercised their senses. They hadn't been studying the truth. He says,
[00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:47.440]   "You, I've got to give you the first principles again. You haven't grown, you haven't made use
[00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:52.320]   of your faculties, you haven't studied the truth. And the result is you're shaking, you don't know
[00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:56.880]   where you are. And still worse," he says, "I can't give you the greatest consolation of all,
[00:26:56.880 --> 00:27:01.120]   which is the picture of Christ as the high priest after the order of Melchizedek.
[00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:09.120]   I can't give it to you," says the writer, "because you're not fit for this strong meat. I've got to
[00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:14.080]   give you the preliminary, the beginning again. You don't grow, and you see you need to be strong in
[00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:20.320]   order to take strong meat." It was because they hadn't exercised their faculties that they were
[00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:26.560]   in the terribly dangerous condition. Well, very well, I say this is the thing with which we start.
[00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:35.760]   The loins must be girded about with truth, the whole truth. I'm not talking about a superficial
[00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:40.400]   reading of the Bible or a hurried classification. I'm not asking you to study it as a literary
[00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:45.360]   document. I say we must get down beyond the words to the doctrines, the principles,
[00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:52.400]   and have them ever in our minds and meditate upon them and live daily by them and put them
[00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:59.680]   ever into practice. Truth! And without it, we are already defeated, we are already lost.
[00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:06.560]   Let me hurry on to the second thing. The second thing he tells us that we need is the breastplate
[00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:13.680]   of righteousness. I needn't emphasize this, need I? The breastplate covers
[00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:20.560]   what is perhaps the most important part of the body, the thorax. It covers the heart,
[00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:28.400]   and these vital organs without which we can't live. So obviously, a breastplate is
[00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:36.240]   of extreme importance judged from any angle whatsoever. And the apostle tells us, therefore,
[00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:42.560]   put on the breastplate of righteousness. What's he mean? Well, again, you'll find the same type
[00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:48.880]   of expositor to whom I've already referred saying that this means, of course, our ethical righteousness.
[00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:56.640]   They say that he means here you must live a good life. You must protect the vitals by
[00:28:56.640 --> 00:29:05.040]   living a good life, avoiding sin, and doing good ethical righteousness. But again, it seems to me
[00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:10.960]   to be an utterly inadequate and impossible suggestion. That is something that you and I
[00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:16.480]   are responsible for. That is something that you and I produce. Whereas the apostle tells us to
[00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:23.360]   put on the whole armor of God, strong in the strength that God supplies, this armor that God
[00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:31.760]   gives us. It can't be our ethical righteousness for this good reason also. That the devil in a
[00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:37.920]   moment can pierce our ethical righteousness. Haven't we all discovered that already?
[00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:43.520]   When you tend to be a bit pleased with yourself because you're such a good Christian and so active
[00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:48.400]   and so busy, and you think that you've got on your breastplate of righteousness, and suddenly you
[00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:55.920]   find that the devil has pierced and penetrated, of course. If he felt competent to tempt even the son
[00:29:55.920 --> 00:30:02.880]   of God, if he could attack a man like David and all these Old Testament saints and get him down,
[00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:10.160]   what is your righteousness and mine? Why, our Lord tells us that after we've done everything we are
[00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:17.440]   supposed to do, we are still unprofitable servants. We've nothing more of to boast. Our own righteousness,
[00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:24.400]   if we rely upon it, is but a filthy wretch. It's no good. No, no, thank God. It isn't your
[00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:30.080]   righteousness and mine. It isn't your ethical behavior and mine. What is it then? Well, my
[00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:38.480]   friends, this is nothing but the righteousness of God in Jesus Christ. That's the breastplate.
[00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:43.200]   If you like it in more doctrine or form, this is justification by faith only.
[00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:52.000]   This is the righteousness that God supplies to me and asks me to put it on. And I need this
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:58.720]   particular righteousness to defend myself. Why? Well, because the enemy attacks me in this kind of way.
[00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:03.600]   He comes and makes us doubt whether we are Christian at all.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:10.480]   He comes at times and says, "Now, you've always regarded yourself as a Christian.
[00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:16.560]   Are you quite sure that you're a Christian?" And he puts his questions, he raises his doubts
[00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:19.760]   and his difficulties. We considered that on a previous Sunday morning.
[00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:27.760]   And then sometimes he does it in this way. He reminds us of our past sins. He resurrects it.
[00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:33.280]   We'd forgotten it 20, 30 years ago. Suddenly the whole thing is there in front of us and we see
[00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:39.840]   ourselves doing it and you can't get rid of it. Do you know anything about that? The devil does
[00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:48.000]   that sort of thing. He'll resurrect your past sins. Or he will show us our failure to be what we ought
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:54.160]   to be. You may be reading an excellent biography of some great saint and you're enjoying it,
[00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:59.680]   but suddenly the thought is insinuated into your mind by the devil. Are you like that?
[00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:04.400]   You know, if you're not like that, you're not a Christian at all. Every Christian is like that
[00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:09.120]   and you are not like that. Therefore, you're not a Christian. That's the kind of thing he does.
[00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:15.840]   Shows us what we ought to be, shows us our failures and our shortcomings. And of course, especially
[00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:23.280]   should we fall into sin, he will come to us and he'll say, "Well, of course,
[00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:30.000]   there you are. Before your conversion, you sinned. It was all right and God could forgive you because
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:36.240]   you didn't have the light then. But no, you've had the light and you've known the light. You're
[00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:41.360]   a Christian man and you've sinned deliberately against the light and you've sinned against the
[00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:46.560]   Holy Ghost and there's no forgiveness for you. You've just sinned yourself out of God's love.
[00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:54.560]   That's where you are." Those are some of the fiery dots of the evil one.
[00:32:57.040 --> 00:33:01.120]   And I tell you at this point, my friend, there's only one protection that is adequate and
[00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:07.840]   sufficient. It is the breastplate of the righteousness of God in Jesus Christ.
[00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:12.000]   There is only one answer I have at that point and it's just to say this.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:21.600]   Christ loved me and gave himself for me. He died for my sins, past, present, and future.
[00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:29.760]   I am in Christ and I belong to him and what is true of him is true of me. I have been crucified
[00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:34.160]   with him. I have died with him. I'm buried with him. I'm risen with him. I'm a new man in Christ.
[00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:40.320]   Yes, I've sinned, but Christ has covered my sin. The blood of Jesus Christ, his Son,
[00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:46.480]   still cleanseth from all sin and unrighteousness. The breastplate of righteousness.
[00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:52.480]   I know many Christian people who are unhappy because they're not absolutely clear about this.
[00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:57.680]   I think they believe it, but you know, they don't know how to put on this breastplate.
[00:33:57.680 --> 00:34:02.720]   They don't know how to use it. They don't know how to apply it. They believe it, I know, and yet,
[00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:06.720]   you see, when the devil comes and attacks them, he makes them shaky about it. "Put on the breastplate,
[00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:12.240]   my friend. Are you clear about this? Let me put it once more very simply, even thus in a Sunday
[00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:25.040]   morning service. You and I and all others who are Christians are saved entirely and only and solely
[00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:36.080]   and utterly by the Lord Jesus Christ and what he's done. Nothing that is true of you and of me comes
[00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:45.440]   into it at all. Christ is my righteousness. The only righteousness is the righteousness of God
[00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:54.000]   in Jesus Christ, the righteousness that he gives, which is this. All our sins, every one of them,
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:59.920]   were laid and have been laid upon the Son of God.
[00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:07.440]   When he died upon that cross, he was bearing the punishment of your sins. You were not born then,
[00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:13.280]   but he's born them all. Not only the sins you've committed in the past, all your sins that you may
[00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:18.000]   commit in the future as well. "Oh," says someone, "that's a very dangerous thing to say. Aren't you
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:22.080]   encouraging people to sin?" I am not, because if you're a Christian, that won't encourage you to
[00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:27.600]   sin. You'll be so amazed at the love of God, it'll keep you from sin. If you take license out of
[00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:36.000]   that, I say you don't really believe the truth. All sins of believers were dealt with when he died
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:46.080]   upon the cross. Quite right. Amen. It's the most glorious truth of all. But not only that,
[00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:54.960]   God takes the righteousness of his own Son, which is absolutely perfect, his obedience to God's law,
[00:35:54.960 --> 00:36:02.000]   his obedience to his Father's will in everything, his perfect life, and you know, he gives that to
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:08.960]   you and to me. He clothes us with the righteousness of Christ, so that not only am I forgiven,
[00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:16.080]   I am made positively righteous by Christ. That's the best bit of righteousness, to believe that,
[00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:23.200]   and to be certain of that, and to rely upon that, and to hold on to that, and whatever the devil
[00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:28.400]   may say to you at any point, over anything you may have done or not, confront him by the
[00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:35.280]   righteousness of Christ, and he can't touch you. Whether it's past sins, whether it's a sin you've
[00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:39.920]   just committed, whether it's what you haven't done, whether it's anything, you're entirely
[00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:46.320]   dependent upon Christ. That is justification by faith only. That is the righteousness of God.
[00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:50.880]   It's got nothing to do with the law, it's got nothing to do with my activity, it's Christ and
[00:36:50.880 --> 00:37:00.000]   what he's done, what he is. And my salvation is entirely in him and of him. Put on the breastplate
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:07.520]   of righteousness. It will protect you at your most vital point. Let me say just a word about
[00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:11.200]   the last, which I'm going to deal with this morning, the third in this first section.
[00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:15.680]   Having your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace,
[00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:27.600]   is it foolish to say, as I feel constrained to say at this moment, isn't the scripture marvelous?
[00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:33.120]   Your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace. What's he mean?
[00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:40.720]   What does preparation mean? It means preparedness, quickness, swiftness, and also
[00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:47.280]   sure-footedness. You see the picture, don't you? Here am I, and there's my enemy.
[00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:54.480]   And there's nothing more characteristic of him than his subtlety, his quickness. He comes here,
[00:37:54.480 --> 00:38:00.080]   he comes there. I've got to keep watching. Our hymn has told us that, watching unto prayer,
[00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:04.880]   watch and pray. You've got to watch. The apostles always saying it, "Quit you like men, watch ye,
[00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:10.880]   stand fast in the faith." This enemy, so subtle, he moves quickly. With all his brilliance and his
[00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:16.160]   power, I never know which way he's coming. And you see, unless I'm equally quick in my movements,
[00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:20.800]   and ready at any point, he'll get me down, he'll attack me in the back before I know where I am.
[00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:26.240]   So I've got to have my feet shod with the preparation, the preparedness, the quickness,
[00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:31.360]   the agility, the swiftness, the movement, which is essential in the handling of this armor and
[00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:39.840]   all that God has provided for me. My reactions must be quick in every sense. Well now, why does
[00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:48.320]   he say that what I need in that respect is the preparation of the gospel of peace? Why did he
[00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:53.200]   put it like that, you think? Was that just saying something? The word "peace" offered itself to him
[00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:58.320]   and he put it down? Not at all. He means precisely and exactly what he says. This is what he means.
[00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:07.440]   He says you will never be quick in your movements and in your ability to deal with this enemy and to
[00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:13.920]   hold him back and to perhaps slash him with a sword if he should come too near. You'll never
[00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:22.480]   be quick like this until you're in a state of absolute peace within with regard to your whole
[00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:27.520]   relationship to God and with regard to your salvation. This is, in other words, assurance
[00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:36.880]   of salvation. Isn't it obvious? Take a person, take a Christian who's being attacked by the enemy.
[00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:47.760]   And alas, this poor Christian is indeed already unhappy. He or she is a little bit doubtful about
[00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:52.400]   salvation. You see, there's a war going on within before the devil comes at all.
[00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:57.040]   And if you're fighting a civil war within, how can you fight the enemy that's outside? You can't.
[00:39:57.040 --> 00:40:03.360]   It's impossible. If we are to fight this enemy, there must be complete freedom within. There must
[00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:07.600]   be freedom of action so that when he comes, I don't have to look at my defences and begin to
[00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:11.840]   wonder where I am and what I'm doing. I'm all right and I'm ready for him. I can be altogether
[00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:21.520]   objective. That's what he means. It is the kind of objectivity that results from peace of conscience,
[00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:30.880]   peace with God, peace within and peace with others. If there's something nagging at you
[00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:35.280]   inside, if you're unhealthy, if you're ill, if you're diseased spiritually, how can you fight
[00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:41.520]   the enemy? It's impossible. There must be peace within. And the way he puts that is,
[00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:48.480]   you see, to put it in terms of this picture of having our feet shod with the preparation
[00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:57.520]   of the gospel of peace. It's a terrible thing for a country. When she's fighting another country
[00:40:57.520 --> 00:41:03.040]   to have problems inside, I have no doubt that one of the main factors which enabled us to win our
[00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:10.560]   victory in the last war was that this country was virtually 100% united. But if there's conflict
[00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:16.400]   within the nation, how can you fight the enemy outside? No, no. The condition of success is
[00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:20.320]   a unified nation and it's exactly the same with an individual personality.
[00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:30.240]   And the apostle, you see, goes on in a perfect sequence. Truth. The particular truth about
[00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:35.040]   righteousness and justification. And once you're clear about that, well, you'll have this peace.
[00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:40.320]   But it's so important that he must emphasize it. He says you must know how to deal with the doubts
[00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:46.160]   that lurk, with all the questions that arise within, and all the kind of fifth column that's
[00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:54.480]   in you yourself. Get rid of it. Get rid of it. That's putting on the sandals, the footwear,
[00:41:54.480 --> 00:42:03.040]   which is the preparation of the gospel of peace. Well, my friends, our time has gone.
[00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:09.840]   And I can take you no further this morning. But we have taken these things in detail and
[00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:15.280]   we've tarried with them because it is so vital and essential that we should do so.
[00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:19.440]   These are the things, you see, you actually put on your body.
[00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:27.120]   God willing, we'll go on to look next Sunday at the shield, the helmet, and the sword.
[00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:35.440]   But these things that we've tarried with this morning are absolutely essential. These are the
[00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:43.680]   basic, fundamental things, without which the others that remain would be of no final value to us.
[00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:51.920]   Very well, my dear friends. As the enemy comes and attacks you and hurls his fiery darts at you
[00:42:51.920 --> 00:43:00.960]   to inflame your passions and what remains in you of that old nature in your body and in your flesh,
[00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:05.280]   as he comes to your mind, as he attacks your heart, as he comes in every way,
[00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:14.400]   realize that this and this alone is the way to meet him. Strong in the strength that God supplies,
[00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:25.040]   through his eternal Son, and clothed with the full panoply of God's honor. And with this,
[00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:31.600]   victory is assured and we need not be afraid. Amen.
[00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:36.560]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
