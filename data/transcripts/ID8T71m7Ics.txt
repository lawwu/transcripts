[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   I found out about a free bird purchase that is just you were
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.440]   there tomorrow. You heard what he bought?
[00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:10.080]   What did I buy pickles the quinoa? What was no no,
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.840]   sacks. You missed this because you're you are a sunbird now and
[00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.840]   the rest of us are snowbirds over the holidays. But the three
[00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.160]   of us have been hanging out skiing having dinner for a
[00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.640]   couple of weeks. And we had a little wives dinner. And one of
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.120]   the wives was complaining about the suit free birds purchasing
[00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.480]   suits. Oh my god. So free burgers. Do you have pictures of
[00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.040]   the radiation suits? I don't have pictures of the radiation
[00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.600]   you're trying to find radiation suits. I thought you're gonna
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.520]   talk about like Brioni suits or something. No radiation suits.
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.280]   You know how you went into full scale panic mode and you during
[00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.520]   COVID and you had your whole outfit. Your hazmat suit.
[00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:54.480]   Friedberg just because he's panicked about nuclear
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:01.200]   proliferation has bought suits for his entire family. 1000s of
[00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.400]   dollars of radiation suits and nuclear fallout. And he bought
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:12.680]   one for his dog. Dog. Sorry, dogs for Monty and Daisy. I
[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.040]   should send you guys the photo of the bunker. I mean, I've got
[00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.560]   it all taken care of. You need a bunker first, right? I think
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.960]   that's underway as well. How do you get to your bunker free
[00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.440]   Burke with with the pilots that you'll be asking to leave their
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.520]   families? You'll be protecting them with the guns that were
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.600]   stolen from us. At least you'll have the 1000s of pickles you've
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.360]   made. No, Friedberg was a prepper. Did you know this?
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.040]   Saks? Saks has a little prepper. Saks Friedberg was howling
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.960]   because he was so mad. He made like 1000s and 1000s of pickles.
[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.800]   And nobody would eat them including himself. Because they
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.400]   were so terrible. You literally bought a radiation pod for your
[00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.600]   dogs. Yeah, so they that's their air filter on the right, so
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.040]   that they don't breathe in the nuclear fallout cloud.
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.280]   I like the prepping. Thank you, sir. Yeah, it's good. You guys
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.160]   don't understand. There's a reason evolution happens in
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.560]   moments of what we call punctuated equilibrium. There's a
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.080]   massive event. And certain, you know, things survive. And then
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.960]   that becomes the proliferant species going forward. This is
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.200]   the moment. Be ready. You're saying paranoid, rich white guys
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.080]   are going to survive the nuclear Holocaust.
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.280]   That's what you're saying. Paranoid, rich white tech guys
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.640]   are going to make it to the other side. Got it. How
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:29.240]   exciting.
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.240]   What a great future. What a future.
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.840]   Like we'd rather die.
[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.600]   It touches my erogenous zones. Just the idea of it when Saks
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.160]   and Friedberg are the only two reproducting males left.
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.880]   Can you imagine the gene pool? It's like literally this is like
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.440]   some dystopian science fiction. This is like a Black Mirror
[00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.960]   episode.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.440]   You'll have the pastiest preppers in the world.
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.920]   pasty preppers to inherit the earth.
[00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.400]   Let your winners ride.
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.280]   Rain Man David Saks.
[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:16.680]   Welcome back to the program, everybody. It is the new year,
[00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.320]   but it's the same squad. Your four besties are here. Chamath
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:25.320]   Palihapitiya. He is now not just the dictator, he is chairman
[00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.320]   dictator calling in from the slopes with his beautiful Bert
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.600]   sweater. That's a great sweater. Major turtleneck going on there.
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:37.120]   And we have David Friedberg also looks like he's on the slopes.
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.960]   And he is wearing his Oh, hollow his Oh, hollow, not Mahalo. Oh,
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:45.280]   hollow hat is branding here on the all in podcast sneaking a
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.920]   little branding for his new startup that he is the CEO of
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.640]   David Saks is with us, of course, and he cleaned up, he
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.480]   cleaned up a little bit here, the hair was getting out of
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.720]   control. We had a lot of commentary on the hair.
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.240]   Apparently you cleaned up shop.
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.320]   I pivoted from the the Jefferson to the gecko.
[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:05.080]   Alright, so everybody loves when we do our predictions. And so
[00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.360]   we're going to start off 2024. Big Year for us. We have a lot
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.400]   going on here and all in and we're going to just do some
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.840]   predictions here. So let's get started. We're going to kick it
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.280]   off with sacks doing his prediction for the biggest
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.840]   political winner in 2024. Saks, who do you have? What's your
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.520]   prediction for who's going to be the biggest winner in 2024? We're
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.960]   bracing?
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.400]   Yeah, well, you're gonna love this Jake out. But my prediction
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.720]   for biggest political winner in 2024 is Vladimir Putin.
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:38.760]   2023. Last year was the year that Putin turned it all around.
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.680]   He stabilized his economy after the West attempt to sanction him
[00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.680]   to his knees tried to collapse his economy. We issued a basic
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.360]   arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court. He
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.680]   has gained the upper hand militarily in Ukraine. I think
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.720]   that 2024 will be a year of him consolidating gains in Ukraine,
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.680]   potentially making new gains. I think that the the stalemate
[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:10.600]   narrative that our media has propagated about Ukraine will be
[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.760]   exposed as a lie. I think the Russians are in fact winning
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:18.720]   that war. And what you're seeing is that his successful stance
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.600]   against the West in Ukraine has only made him more influential
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.760]   throughout the global south and in the BRICS countries,
[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:31.720]   countries that oppose American dominance and dollar hegemony
[00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.320]   see him as the man with a plan as a bit of a conquering hero.
[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:41.880]   And I think as project Ukraine falls apart in 2024, it's only
[00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.720]   going to reinforce that sense that he's the big winner.
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.520]   Saks, did you see that Argentina said they're not going to join
[00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:53.320]   BRICS and that some have said that was a bit of a blowback on
[00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:57.360]   the BRICS effort to end dollar hegemony? And do you think it's
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:59.120]   really impactful? Or is it just a one off?
[00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:04.040]   I think it's a one off. I mean, melee one in a big surprise
[00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.920]   there because the country's economy has been such a basket
[00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:11.640]   case, and he is very pro American, pro Israel, pro West.
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:17.160]   And so he has distance Argentina from from BRICS. But I think
[00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:20.080]   that's a little bit of a one off. The larger issue is that
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:26.640]   the whole global south now is really resisting the collective
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:30.560]   West in a number of different ways. And so our influence and
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:34.800]   dominance is slowly declining across the world. And there's
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.920]   many examples of that. So we can get into it throughout the show.
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:40.400]   Just to be clear with the audience, you're not rooting for
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.240]   Putin here. You're just predicting he's the biggest
[00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:43.600]   winner.
[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:47.560]   I'm not rooting for it to happen. I've got other answers
[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:52.640]   here that I think are negatives. As well. I wish we had made a
[00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:55.200]   peace deal and avoided this whole Ukraine war. I think that
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:56.960]   was a gigantic mistake by the West.
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:58.560]   Yeah. So yeah, we've been clear about that. Yeah.
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:03.720]   We have put Putin in this position to be the victor,
[00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:08.200]   because we plunged into a war without thinking it through. And
[00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:12.040]   the truth is, we can't give Ukraine enough aid to have them
[00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:16.440]   actually win this war. So we've contributed massively to Putin
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:20.600]   being this victor. And you know, it was Fiona Hill, who is a
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.680]   Russia hawk in the foreign policy establishment, who
[00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:27.480]   pointed out in a speech, I think, over the past year, that
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.800]   the global south is using this Ukraine war as a proxy to rebel
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.440]   against the West. So in the same way that we're using Ukraine as
[00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:39.760]   a proxy against Russia, she said the global south was using
[00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:43.760]   Russia as a proxy against the West, as a way to basically
[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:48.200]   dethrone American hegemony all over the world. And that's a
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:49.040]   very negative trend.
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:53.200]   So if you had Ukraine and Putin in under seven minutes for this
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:56.160]   episode, you bet the under you win. Freeberg, who's your
[00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:59.040]   prediction for the biggest political winner in politics for
[00:07:59.040 --> 00:07:59.720]   2024?
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:03.240]   I'm going to go with independent third party in the US, we saw
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:06.240]   the stats last week, I think we reviewed them with a poll that
[00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:09.160]   showed that 60 plus percent of people are claiming interest in
[00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:12.680]   a third party or an independent effort outside of the
[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:18.760]   traditional damn Republican split. And if you look at in
[00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:25.280]   1992, Ross Perot got 18 to 19% of the general election vote.
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:28.760]   RFK Jr is obviously running on an independent ticket this year,
[00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:30.840]   we'll see if he can even get on the ballot and a bunch of
[00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:35.800]   states. But I think that whether it's him, or the interest in
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:39.440]   developing a third party in the US that there may be a big
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:44.520]   winner this year that challenges the traditional two party split
[00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:45.080]   in this country.
[00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:47.720]   All right. And Chamath, who do you got for your biggest
[00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:50.160]   political winner in 2020?
[00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:53.120]   Independent centrists, I think this election starts the
[00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:56.320]   breakdown of the two party system. Same, same. Look at
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:58.840]   that. RFK this week actually just got added to the Utah
[00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:02.200]   ballot. I think that this could be the most meaningful, long
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:05.120]   lasting change that we see in American politics is this is
[00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:07.080]   amazing from from the RFK candidacy.
[00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:10.320]   I mean, how many people do you guys know that were Republicans
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:11.800]   that don't want to be Republicans anymore were
[00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:13.960]   Democrats and don't want to be Democrats anymore. It's really
[00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:17.840]   like most so many people I know more of the latter. I know more
[00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:19.920]   of the latter actually than I do. Right? Yeah, that's true,
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:22.400]   too. Yeah, that's what I think. I think I think Republicans are
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:24.920]   still firmly established. I think people are embarrassed to
[00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:25.960]   be a Democrat right now.
[00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:29.640]   Interestingly, I also picked the dark horse presidential
[00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:33.040]   candidate who will be treasonous and corrupt, aka Trump and
[00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:35.360]   Biden, I think we're going to actually see some dark horse
[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:39.880]   candidate maybe beat these two. And the rematch that nobody
[00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:42.880]   wanted. Wow, that's crazy. Three of the four of us pick the same
[00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:45.680]   thing. No coordination beforehand. Yes. And this is
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:49.720]   done blind folks. And Nick has my notes here. So he can he can
[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:54.360]   vouch for me here. And just to go back and look at 2023. What we
[00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:57.840]   predicted, Sachs, you said Asian American college applicants,
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:00.040]   we're going to be your biggest winner in politics that actually
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:02.080]   turned out to be pretty prescient, right?
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:06.200]   Yeah, I mean, I was betting on court cases overruling
[00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:08.760]   affirmative action. And that's exactly what happened is that
[00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:11.800]   Supreme Court ruled against affirmative action and college
[00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:15.360]   admissions, saying that it unlawfully discriminated against
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:17.720]   Asian Americans. So yeah, that worked out exactly right.
[00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:21.760]   So that's a great prediction. I think Chamath you had perhaps
[00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:26.360]   the best prediction of even the entire show last year, your
[00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:29.200]   spread trade long Nikki and short to Santa's that paid off
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:33.560]   in spades. Well done there. Freeberg you had MBS and Saudi
[00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:36.800]   have the most important year in their modern era, actually
[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:39.000]   pretty pressing as well. They seem to be I mean, if you look
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.240]   at let me just post this, this was this journal article that
[00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:43.960]   came out in March, if you guys remember this when Saudi was
[00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:47.800]   considering accepting yuan instead of dollars for sales of
[00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:52.000]   oil to China. And then in August, the US ramped up
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.600]   pressure on Saudi Arabia to sell oil in dollars, not you on. Let
[00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:59.040]   me just pull this up for you guys, which was obviously the
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:03.040]   follow on story where the US tried to counter the actions,
[00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:06.560]   which is continuing, obviously today, where there's a back and
[00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:09.080]   forth. And Saudi, as I mentioned last week, I think is in this
[00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:12.920]   really interesting central pivot position between all of these
[00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:18.080]   competing major nuclear powers and fighting for influence. And
[00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:20.720]   this is a big story, and it will continue to be this year.
[00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:25.320]   And modernizing society, that photo of the fist bump, I mean,
[00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:29.360]   what a mistake that was where Biden just gratuitously insulted
[00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:33.680]   MBS. Compare that to the photo of Putin visiting the Middle
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:37.240]   East and meeting shaking hands with MBS, which happened just a
[00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:42.680]   few weeks ago. And compare the welcome that Putin got in Saudi
[00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:46.480]   Arabia, and I think UAE to the welcome that Biden got, it's
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:49.440]   just two completely different levels. It was a very warm
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:53.320]   embrace on both sides. I think it was UAE, they literally had a
[00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:57.320]   parade for him where they had the colors of the Russian flag up
[00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:03.960]   everywhere. So you know, we've tried to portray Putin as this
[00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:06.240]   global pariah, we've tried to turn them into this global
[00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:12.360]   pariah, but it's not working. Because of the way that he is
[00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:16.880]   defeating the collective West in Ukraine. I think that it's
[00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:21.880]   given him enormous cachet and influence in the global south and
[00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:24.720]   much of the developing world, which would like to stand up to
[00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:28.640]   American dominance, or at least is tired of American dominance.
[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:32.400]   And if you double click on that article, the second one I sent
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:35.400]   on Washington trying to negotiate with the Saudis, you
[00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:37.560]   know, quote behind the scenes, but obviously, this all comes
[00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:41.720]   out. They're asking assurances that Riyadh will use dollars,
[00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:45.040]   not yuan to price oil sales assurances that Saudi won't
[00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:48.040]   allow China to build military bases in the kingdom, and
[00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:50.880]   limitations on Saudi Arabia using technology developed by
[00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:55.960]   China. And in exchange, the US will protect Saudi will provide
[00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:59.640]   military protection, and will help them develop a nuclear
[00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:04.000]   program, which is an incredible demand. So obviously, this is an
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.760]   unresolved point. But this becomes a pivot moment for Saudi
[00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:09.320]   Arabia, they may become a nuclear power, use this as
[00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:12.560]   leverage as the US continues to try and keep dollar hegemony
[00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:12.880]   alive.
[00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:16.720]   And my prediction last year was that Trump would get indicted,
[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:20.760]   win the nomination, and then agree not to run in order to get
[00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:24.320]   a pardon or something in that vein. And looks like I'm going
[00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:26.120]   to get to it. If it's those three correct, we'll see on the
[00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:30.480]   pardon. He has been indicted, obviously. And he is looks like
[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:35.080]   a lock to win the nomination. But we'll see. I don't. It seems
[00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:38.680]   like Nikki Ellie's doing okay. We'll see. biggest political
[00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:41.960]   loser of 2024 is what we're gonna do next month. Last year,
[00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:44.980]   you pick to Santa's I picked to Santa's that was a pretty easy
[00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:48.600]   one. Sacha picked California also a pretty easy one. We know
[00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:51.000]   that California's gotten demolished.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   Because specifically, California went from having a $76 billion
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.480]   surplus 2022 to a $68 billion deficit. Now.
[00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:00.200]   Yeah, it's bonkers. Yeah,
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:02.760]   I don't think any of those were as obvious as they were in
[00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:05.400]   January of last year. I think to Santa's was leading, he was
[00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:08.600]   collecting a lot of big checks. And California hadn't imploded
[00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:11.840]   and everybody knew that they were on be under pressure, but
[00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:15.440]   nobody expected to be I think this swift. So I don't think
[00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:17.080]   those are obvious. I think those were actually pretty decent
[00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:17.480]   picks.
[00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:20.520]   Okay, that's good argument. And then freeberg you picked a debt
[00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:23.640]   issues for emerging nations, debt markets start to unravel
[00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:28.120]   IMF steps in. I'm not sure if I have enough information to check
[00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:30.460]   in on that one yet. Any thoughts freeberg we go on to our
[00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:31.480]   predictions for biggest loser.
[00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:34.840]   I don't think we had any big unwinding like I had expected.
[00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:39.400]   But these problems are bubbling and persist. You know, obviously
[00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:42.400]   Argentina took a big step with the election there. That one was
[00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:45.520]   one of the countries that was most at risk of having a big
[00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:46.440]   event last year. But
[00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:50.400]   Chamath, who's your prediction for biggest political loser in
[00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:51.120]   2024?
[00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:55.520]   The Cokes I think on a dollar basis, they are the largest
[00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:59.400]   spender and Republican politics they have been and they have
[00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:03.160]   been the most consistent negative indicator of value. And
[00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:07.600]   so if you just want to fade a trade, I think you can pretty
[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:13.280]   easily just find where the those old school Republicans are
[00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:15.680]   putting their money and just kind of short it and right now,
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:21.680]   as much as I was sort of long the Haley spread trade in 2023. I
[00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:24.000]   would probably now short that trade in 24.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.280]   Okay, switching it up mostly because of the Cokes freeberg
[00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:28.600]   What do you
[00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:33.920]   well, saxel like this one, but I think Ukraine might be the
[00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:37.840]   biggest loser this year as attention shifts to the brewing
[00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:41.800]   conflict in the Middle East. During an election year like the
[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:45.360]   US is facing continuing this funding of this Ukraine, Russia
[00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:50.280]   conflict with US dollars is becoming a more unpopular issue
[00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:53.760]   for people to support. And so I think because of all these,
[00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:57.640]   these competing interests and the political pressure, the US
[00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:01.760]   will probably not have the resources to commit to Ukraine,
[00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:05.320]   I think Ukraine's shot at being in NATO is going to fade away.
[00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:08.960]   And unfortunately, it seems like the country may be left behind
[00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:11.040]   by the end of this year. Sax, what do you got?
[00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:13.640]   Well, I totally agree with that. And I would just add demographic
[00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:17.120]   decline or even collapse. They've lost something like half
[00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:22.680]   a million soldiers in terms of casualties. They also something
[00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:26.240]   like 10 million people have fled the country. I read recently
[00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:28.160]   that there's only about 20 million people left in the
[00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:30.400]   country and half of them are pensioners. So it's not even
[00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:33.320]   clear that the working population, the country's gonna
[00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:36.000]   be able to support the pensioners. And of course, the
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.160]   war isn't close to being over yet. So there's gonna be even
[00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:42.040]   more destruction that happens. So I agree with that, that pick.
[00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:47.720]   I up leveled my answer a little bit here to have the collective
[00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:52.600]   West as the biggest political loser. And Ukraine is a big part
[00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:55.760]   of that, obviously, this huge bet that the collective West
[00:16:55.760 --> 00:17:00.120]   made in terms of pressuring and challenging Putin in Ukraine has
[00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:02.840]   completely crapped out. But I would also go much further than
[00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:06.400]   that. You look at what's happening in Israel and Gaza
[00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:10.600]   right now. And I don't think that Israel's invasion of Gaza
[00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:14.560]   is going well at all. And again, just stepping back, these
[00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:19.480]   answers don't reflect my desire for what I want to have happen.
[00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:23.000]   It just reflects my honest assessment of who the losers are
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:29.920]   gonna be. And I just think that Israel's invasion is not going
[00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:32.680]   well, it does not look like they're going to be able to
[00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:36.760]   militarily achieve their objective of destroying Hamas.
[00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:39.480]   Admiral Kirby, who's the Pentagon spokesperson even said
[00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:42.960]   that the other day, which was a pretty amazing admission. At the
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:46.920]   same time, Israel is creating a huge humanitarian crisis in
[00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:51.800]   Gaza, something like over 20,000 Palestinians have already been
[00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:55.600]   killed over 50,000 wounded, something like 1.8 million of
[00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:58.440]   them have been displaced. And it doesn't look like it's going to
[00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:04.320]   let up anytime soon. As a result of this, Israel is facing, I
[00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:07.920]   think, a huge amount of condemnation. Internationally, it
[00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:11.880]   is becoming a bit of a global pariah. So that is not going
[00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:16.040]   well for America and the West. And then you're going to have a
[00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:20.680]   whole bunch of elections this year, both in the US and in
[00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:24.320]   Europe. I think that there's going to be tremendous
[00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:28.880]   disruption. Things are really not going well in Europe right
[00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:32.960]   now. large parts of Europe are in recession as a result of
[00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:37.440]   losing cheap Russian gas. This is particularly true of Germany.
[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:41.200]   And I think there's going to be some big shakeups in the
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:44.120]   European Parliament. And I wouldn't be surprised if there
[00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:47.560]   was similar shakeups in the US election as well.
[00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:50.040]   All right. And I pick for my biggest political loser, I was
[00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:52.160]   going to go with the American voter, but I'm hoping that the
[00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:55.320]   American voters make better choices. And maybe we see some
[00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:57.800]   alternative candidates, as we said in the last one. And I went
[00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:01.080]   with Netanyahu here, I think. And again, this is just my
[00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:03.880]   assessment. This isn't what I want to occur in the world,
[00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:07.720]   obviously. But every major Israeli poll is just suggesting
[00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:11.040]   that they want him out. And they put the odds of box puts the
[00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:15.520]   odds of disaster at 75%. And obviously, yeah, Gaza is not
[00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:18.640]   going well. And it feels like there is a massive shift in
[00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:23.200]   terms of what was early support. And obvious support for the
[00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:25.880]   terror attacks that occurred on 10. Seven, and any reasonable
[00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:30.400]   person would be supportive of that, too. Hey, maybe what's
[00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:34.360]   happening in Gaza is not helping the situation and needs to be
[00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:37.800]   resolved. And maybe a different approach has to occur. And so I
[00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:41.520]   think Netanyahu is going to be the biggest loser in 2024. All
[00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:45.600]   right, let's go on to the biggest business winner of 2024.
[00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:51.240]   Back to business. Last year, last year, in 2023, I predicted
[00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:55.120]   laid off tech workers starting startup companies would be the
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:57.680]   big winner. Chamath you predicted relativity space 3d
[00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:01.160]   printing, rocket company, and Sachs, you picked America's
[00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:04.040]   natural gas industry, Freeberg, open AI. Wow, a lot of good
[00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:08.160]   choices there. I think opening I was a huge winner in 2023. Yeah,
[00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:11.880]   free bird. Even with the chaos. So I would say so. That was a
[00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:14.680]   good massive revenue, the highest market cap gain of the
[00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:19.360]   year, probably. Yeah. 30 to 90 billion. American natural gas
[00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:24.600]   industry that really actually cooked in 2023. Yes, sex. Yeah,
[00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:27.600]   there's new records. Good prediction. Good pick. Good
[00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:32.360]   pick. Alright, so let's go right to 2024. predictions. Freeberg,
[00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:34.840]   you haven't let us off yet. So you're gonna lead up be the
[00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:36.240]   lead off batter here. What do you got?
[00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:39.600]   I'm going with commodities businesses, which I know isn't
[00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:41.920]   speaking a specific business, but there's a lot of ways to
[00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:44.320]   play it. And I think there's a big commodities boom that's
[00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:48.320]   coming back in 2024. There's been a lot of underinvestment
[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:54.000]   relative to demand over the past call it 18 to 24 months, coming
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.440]   out of COVID. And with rising interest rates, a lot of folks
[00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:01.320]   have been selling down inventory. And there now needs
[00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:04.840]   to be a build back up on inventory and supply. There's
[00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:07.840]   also a bunch of cash coming into the commodities markets that was
[00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:11.600]   sitting in treasuries as yields go down, that cash is coming
[00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:15.640]   back. So building the base back up, rebuilding stockpiles and
[00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:18.320]   supplies coming out of the past 18 months, obviously, economic
[00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:22.160]   activity is strong and robust. So commodities businesses are
[00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:24.320]   going to see a killer 2024.
[00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:25.240]   Chumot, what do you got?
[00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:29.400]   I think the biggest business winner in 2024 is going to be
[00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:37.880]   the bootstrapped startup and or the profitable startup, but the
[00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:40.720]   best will probably be the bootstrapped profitable startup.
[00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:48.000]   And I think the reason is that we are underestimating how cheap
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:55.200]   it's going to be to copy an existing business in 2024. And
[00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:58.160]   so if you assume that these models are going to get 10 and
[00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:02.120]   100 times better, and you assume the cost of compute is going to
[00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:05.680]   get 10 and 100 times cheaper, and you assume the cost of
[00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:11.040]   energy is going to get 10 times cheaper, you're no longer
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:13.960]   measuring in decades when a company will be subject to
[00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:16.880]   disruption, I think you're measuring it in frankly, months.
[00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:19.400]   And so I think you're going to be able to create these
[00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:25.160]   companies for very cheap, and essentially have them attack an
[00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:28.440]   existing business which has upside on economics because they
[00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:33.120]   have just a lot of people and a lot of processes that these GPT
[00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:36.440]   can replicate for essentially free. So if you're profitable,
[00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:38.600]   you have the chance to survive. And I think if you are
[00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:42.640]   unprofitable, I think that you're going to be under a lot
[00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:43.160]   of pressure.
[00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:45.920]   I think it's a great pick. That's exactly what I'm seeing
[00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:50.280]   on the field in the early stage. sacks was your prediction for a
[00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:52.800]   biggest business winner of 2024. Who do you predict is gonna be
[00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:53.880]   the biggest business winner?
[00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:58.560]   I'm predicting and roll for its Roadrunner product, which it
[00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:05.200]   announced last year. And this is a drone interceptor. So it
[00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:08.920]   basically intercepts drones is built for ground based air
[00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:12.600]   defense. And the reason I say this is because if you saw
[00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:16.000]   recently what was happening in the Red Sea with the Hooties,
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.680]   the US was having to use $2 million air defense missiles to
[00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:25.360]   shoot down $2,000 drones, and that is not sustainable. So
[00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:29.680]   right now, we have a huge problem with asymmetric warfare
[00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:34.400]   where our adversaries are using very cheap missiles, very cheap
[00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:39.520]   drones, swarms of them. And they force us to exhaust our air
[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:43.400]   defenses, which are just way too expensive on a unit basis.
[00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:45.200]   Hundreds of 1000s of dollars, you think?
[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:47.160]   Yeah, I think that's right. I think the Roadrunner system
[00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:49.320]   costs hundreds of 1000s of dollars, but it can be it's
[00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:52.480]   reusable. So it's not like you just send one up to take out
[00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:55.600]   one, if it doesn't blow up, if it does blow up, I don't think
[00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:56.280]   you reuse it.
[00:23:56.280 --> 00:24:01.720]   It basically takes off at loiters. This is basically a AI
[00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:04.680]   system where it's self self driving, I guess you will have
[00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:08.320]   operators but and then it returns back to its base
[00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:12.400]   station after it's used. It's not like a kamikaze type drone.
[00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:13.760]   It's actually a drone killer.
[00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:16.320]   Oh, right. I think it is. I think it do dual purpose. It can
[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:18.840]   either intercept and blow something up or it can return
[00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:21.240]   back to base but we'll have to check in on that a and shout
[00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:24.360]   out to our friend Palmer lucky come back on the program. We
[00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:27.160]   miss you. Shout out to our boy. Are you an investor sacks in
[00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:27.720]   Andrew?
[00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:30.320]   No, I'm not. I'm not an investor. But I think I would be.
[00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:32.040]   Yeah. You know, so
[00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:35.160]   they've raised a ton of money. Palmer, great job. Yeah, no
[00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:37.600]   partner will all buy. Actually, I'm building a position right
[00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:43.160]   now. I've been buying secondary in Andrew. And for me, I was
[00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:44.080]   gonna go with startups.
[00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:46.400]   We're really buying secondary shares and Andrew.
[00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:49.320]   I've been building a large position in Andrew. Yes, I'm
[00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:51.480]   trying to get to a 2% ownership position so I can join the
[00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:53.680]   board. So using
[00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:55.320]   so
[00:24:55.320 --> 00:25:00.040]   we're lucky. I am going to go with for my biggest winner in
[00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:04.840]   2024. training data owners like the New York Times, Reddit, x,
[00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:09.720]   Twitter, YouTube, etc. I think what we learned in 2023 was that
[00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:13.000]   the language models are starting to hit parity very quickly. And
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:17.480]   that the real value is going to be in and it may even become
[00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:20.200]   commodities and open source may win the day. So then I think
[00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:24.320]   the winner is folks who have the training data. And I'm actually
[00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:26.920]   proposing a new business model for these language models. I
[00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:31.080]   think now that we've seen this New York Times, an open AI
[00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:34.400]   lawsuit, I think there's a really great outcome here, which
[00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:39.240]   is a market based solution where if you have a chat GPT account,
[00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:42.960]   you can log in and federate with your New York Times subscription
[00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:46.560]   or you know, any other subscription. And then it gives
[00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:50.760]   you the tier of chat GPT for with the New York Times. And so
[00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:52.680]   that could be a win win for everybody, or they could
[00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:55.320]   obviously pay a licensing fee. And so I think this is going to
[00:25:55.320 --> 00:26:00.480]   be an amazing turnaround for the entire content industry. If the
[00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:03.600]   language models respect copyright owners, and come up
[00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:06.800]   with a sustainable system where every year copyright holders can
[00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:09.800]   get some money in exchange for using their training data,
[00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:12.400]   whether it's on images or content. So I'm
[00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:17.080]   accumulate 2% position and open AI through secondary purchases
[00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:20.360]   and get them to do that on the board only 2 billion. Yeah, no,
[00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:23.520]   I think. Yeah. I mean, we didn't bring this up because it's broke
[00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:27.320]   over the the holiday break. But I think Sam Altman is doing a
[00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:29.800]   great job of telling people he wants to do the right thing. And
[00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:32.440]   we discussed previously the licensing deal they did with
[00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:35.280]   business insider in the parent company of it.
[00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:37.600]   Axel Springer, what do you think the deal with New York Times
[00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:38.000]   will look like?
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.200]   I think it's going to be a nine figure settlement for previous
[00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:44.880]   stuff. And then an ongoing licensing fee in order to have
[00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:47.160]   the New York Times in their training data. And then you'll
[00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:51.360]   be able to say, hey, what does the New York Times think of
[00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:54.040]   this, right? You could actually do queries about the New York
[00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:56.960]   Times in it. And I think the New York Times will come up with a
[00:26:56.960 --> 00:27:00.160]   license that everybody can use their data if they pay this
[00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:03.480]   yearly fee. If you stop paying the yearly fee, then you can't
[00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:06.240]   train on it. And we're in uncharted territory.
[00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:08.680]   You're saying there's going to be a New York Times model and a
[00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:09.880]   non New York Times model?
[00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:12.960]   Well, I think you could do two different things. One, you could
[00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:16.200]   do New York Times could make their own model, right? But they
[00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:19.000]   could fork their model or just to the user interface, say, if
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.880]   you want to query New York Times information and have that as
[00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:24.120]   part of your results, you have to have a New York Times
[00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:28.600]   account, right? So if you say I want the best coffee machines,
[00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:31.080]   or what, what's the best coffee equipment? It says, Oh, if you
[00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:34.560]   had wire cutter, and a subscription to New York Times,
[00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:37.720]   we would include the wire cutter results. And this idea that
[00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:41.080]   technologists can't do citations has been proven
[00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:43.200]   absolutely incorrect. There are language models out there that
[00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:46.320]   are using citations all the time opening I think we'll wind up
[00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:48.280]   losing the case if it goes to the mat. I think they're gonna
[00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:50.240]   pay a big licensing fee to your question.
[00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:53.920]   My prediction then is that if this happens, this is not my
[00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:57.480]   pick, but I'm just gonna tell you. I suspect that what happens
[00:27:57.480 --> 00:28:00.440]   is you'll get these yearly licensing fees. And then one
[00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:04.720]   year, the New York Times just falls off a cliff. And when it
[00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:09.400]   comes time to renegotiate, then open AI says no. And they won't
[00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:10.120]   have a choice.
[00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:12.320]   Well, I mean, it's possibility. But if you think about the
[00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:14.880]   Disney characters, you know, let's see. I don't know if you
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:17.640]   saw Nintendo and Disney characters, you know, making
[00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:21.360]   stuff on Dolly or other things. If you make derivative works on
[00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:24.240]   that, and you want to have that feature as part of your image
[00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:27.520]   creator, you just have to have a licensing fee. And so I think
[00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:29.880]   that there's a win win here to be had. And I'm really
[00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:32.000]   interested to see the market based solution because I don't
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.200]   think this is a Napster situation where like open AI gets
[00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:37.200]   shut down. Because opening eyes to savvy I bet you in the
[00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:39.320]   forefront, the big difference between Napster and this is
[00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:42.840]   there, the content universe was limited, and small here, it's
[00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:46.200]   infinite and unlimited. And so how do you pay anything to
[00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:49.160]   anybody without? I just think it's like without direct
[00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:52.360]   attribution of revenue, which is basically impossible. You're
[00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:54.880]   kind of making a value judgment, which I don't think makes any
[00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:59.200]   sense. I think I think doing a revenue licensing deal is
[00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:01.680]   impossible when you get into the weeds when these business people
[00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:05.880]   sit down and actually start to try to figure out the bid ask. I
[00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:09.240]   don't know as a rational, coherent business person, what
[00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:12.480]   you would model in order to present the number.
[00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:17.360]   Yeah, so one suggestion would be what percentage of the models
[00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:20.560]   creation was using the New York Times data. And I think people
[00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:24.360]   say one to 2% of the original chat GPT was built off a
[00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:27.120]   trading data was New York Times. And then if they waited that
[00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:30.120]   heavily chemoth, like let's say they said, New York Times is an
[00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:32.960]   authoritatively five times more important than these other
[00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:36.480]   sources. That could be upwards of five to 10% of the authority
[00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:39.680]   of that model. Yeah, but so yes, it's not easy. But what's the
[00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:42.240]   cause? Yeah, but what's the cause for the like, are you
[00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:44.400]   telling me that like, the music industry has is
[00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:47.720]   gonna be like a 3040% cost of goods,
[00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:51.880]   you could say that chat GPT, or let's say Apple, I predict Apple
[00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:54.040]   will do this, right, they'll do a language model where they say
[00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:57.360]   50% of the revenue that we generate from queries or
[00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:01.160]   subscriptions, that goes to the people we built it off of where
[00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:03.520]   the licensees Sure, why not? Why not? They're already
[00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:06.160]   following you can just really does that would guarantee the
[00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:10.880]   death of the startup ecosystem. And it would guarantee the lock
[00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:11.840]   in a big tech.
[00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:15.480]   No, I don't think so. You could build models that don't have the
[00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:17.520]   data and you can build models with it. So it'll be a choice by
[00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:19.920]   the person who builds the model and synthetic data might make it
[00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:23.160]   so you don't need the New York Times chemoth. It's early days
[00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:25.480]   for synthetic data. I don't have an opinion. I'm just reacting to
[00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:28.640]   this idea that 50% of cogs, then all of a sudden, these aren't
[00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:31.040]   software companies, you know, these software companies will
[00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:32.760]   have a gross margin of like 30%.
[00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:36.560]   Yeah. Well, what a Spotify pay for music, you know, so that same
[00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:38.720]   argument is made for Spotify, you know, or Netflix, when they
[00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:41.000]   were licensing, and that's the difference. It's limited in
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.880]   scope, meaning there's there's only ever one hit song from
[00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:48.760]   Rihanna that matters, or jay-z or whomever picked Taylor Swift.
[00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:51.640]   And so it's a very scoped content universe. And so you can
[00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:55.040]   ascribe value much easier, because then the user goes and
[00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:57.880]   actually listens to that song over another, this is about
[00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:00.760]   something that's happening under the waterline, where you don't
[00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:03.280]   know how the iceberg is, it's both, there are things under the
[00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:05.960]   model that do it. And then there's also quoting stuff. And
[00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:08.360]   that's really where the New York Times got there, caught them
[00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:10.280]   with their hand in the cookie jar, is that when it was
[00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:13.520]   regurgitating information and giving the results, it was
[00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:16.720]   quoting deeply New York Times proprietary content. And so
[00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:19.560]   that's, that's where there's like a you're right about the
[00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:21.680]   training data, but you might be wrong about the
[00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:24.320]   that could be fixed. Right? They could
[00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:29.360]   make it could exclude storing any proprietary data, you can
[00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:31.760]   create a filter that says the model can't store any of this
[00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:34.680]   data. But it can still be trained or can't use it, right.
[00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:37.640]   So if you say what's the best coffee machine, it can't use the
[00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:40.760]   New York Times where I cut a data and I bet you that Sam
[00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:43.640]   Altman has already built a model without it. I guarantee you
[00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:46.680]   they've already built a for an emergent press here in case of
[00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:50.320]   emergency. Here's the 4.5 model in case they got an injunction,
[00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:51.920]   which would be highly unlikely. But if they did get an
[00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:54.920]   injunction, they just say, Okay, here's 4.5. It doesn't use the
[00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:58.920]   New York Times training data. So this is all uncharted
[00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:01.600]   territory. As we all know, I think we got everybody's
[00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:04.760]   business predictions. Okay, Andrew commodities, training
[00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:07.720]   data, and bootstrap profitable startups with a great cohort
[00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:13.120]   there. Let's go on to biggest business losers in 2024. 2023.
[00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:16.680]   Chamath said Google search as measured by profitability
[00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:22.120]   engagement. SAC said the consumer freeberg said capital
[00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:25.800]   intensive series BCS and D growth companies. That's pretty
[00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:29.080]   pretty good winner there. And I said white collar workers without
[00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:34.640]   hard skills, also known as surplus elites. Any feedback on
[00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:37.400]   those boys as your winner? I'll give you my prediction for 24.
[00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:39.440]   Please Yes, go ahead.
[00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:44.040]   Vertical SaaS companies I think are going to get smacked this
[00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:47.320]   year. And I mentioned this, I think we talked about this step
[00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:50.840]   off off the show. But or if we talked about on the show, I
[00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:54.720]   apologize. But like I think these tools to write code, no
[00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:59.840]   code tools, co piloting tools, and the ability for engineers to
[00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:04.960]   get 2050 100x more productive to build custom applications for
[00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:08.240]   their enterprise are so incredibly powerful. I mentioned
[00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:12.280]   this to you guys, I know of a couple vertical SaaS businesses
[00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:15.480]   that some of my companies use the software, and they're
[00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:18.560]   getting off the software, because they've built homegrown
[00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:22.640]   solutions at a very low cost, very low touch way. And I'm
[00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:26.200]   seeing that so frequently. Now, I think this is a real threat to
[00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:29.160]   vertical SaaS businesses that can charge 1000s of dollars per
[00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:32.160]   seat per year that are getting disrupted by the ability for
[00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:35.280]   companies now to very cheaply and quickly build homegrown
[00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:37.840]   solutions, using a lot of the generative tools that are out
[00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:38.080]   there.
[00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:39.480]   SACs, your prediction,
[00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:42.600]   my prediction for biggest business loser in 24 is is
[00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:46.440]   actually the German economy. There's two big problems there.
[00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:50.320]   First is that the loss of cheap Russian gas has really cut the
[00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:55.000]   legs out from under the German industrial model, their entire
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:59.120]   economy is based on industrial output. And cheap Russian gas
[00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:02.520]   was sort of at the foundation of that. As you guys know, someone
[00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:05.920]   blew up the Nord Stream pipeline. I think that has
[00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:10.920]   really hurt the German economy. And then second, the German car
[00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:15.760]   industry has been massively impacted by a sudden glut of
[00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:20.160]   cheap cars coming from China. So if you look at the Chinese
[00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:23.960]   automotive industry, it's really exploded in the last few years.
[00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:27.280]   And auto exports is one of you know, it's one of the biggest
[00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:31.320]   products that Germany manufactures. And with German
[00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:35.320]   costs going up and Chinese costs coming down, that's just not a
[00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:39.200]   very good place for them to be. So I think double whammy for
[00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:39.720]   Germany.
[00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:43.320]   Chema, do you have the biggest business loser in 2024?
[00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:51.760]   I am going to say that 24 is the peak in terms of valuations of
[00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:58.560]   professional sports. Oh, and I will give you four examples in
[00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:05.200]   2023 that I think were in some very concerning or pro sports
[00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:11.080]   franchise values. As of today. The first was you had an upstart
[00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:15.280]   competitor to a league that came out of nowhere, used money to
[00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:20.320]   overcome the ability to attract stars. I'm talking about the
[00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:24.720]   live tour versus the PGA and then essentially forced the PGA
[00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:29.520]   into merger talks with them. The second was you had a country use
[00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:33.600]   their balance sheet to basically try to jumpstart their own
[00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:37.960]   professional sports business. In this case, it was soccer. The
[00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:40.880]   country was Saudi Arabia and the players were Ronaldo and Messi,
[00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:45.480]   they got one but not the other. The third was the explosion of
[00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:50.920]   NIL inside the NCAA. You have people in college now making
[00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:55.440]   more in some cases than the same player in a professional sports
[00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:58.120]   context. So they're making millions of dollars to be in
[00:35:58.120 --> 00:36:02.040]   college. And then the fourth, which may not seem like it's
[00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:04.600]   related, but there was an article in the Wall Street
[00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:08.760]   Journal, I think recently, about a meaningful uptick in churn
[00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:12.280]   amongst all the streamers, Netflix, Hulu, all of these
[00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:17.160]   companies, Amazon, who are the only folks with in a position to
[00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:20.760]   actually have the balance sheet to keep paying a premium for
[00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:23.440]   professional sports rights. So I think when you put that all
[00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:28.560]   together, you can start to see that there's been a tipping
[00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:33.520]   point in enterprise values. The acceleration we've seen over the
[00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:37.520]   last decade has slowed down. So I would say that 2024 is going
[00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:40.720]   to be the year of peak pro sports values.
[00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:45.440]   Okay, starts to come down. And I went with smartphones. smartphone
[00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:48.720]   manufacturers are facing a major slowdown. Consumers obviously
[00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:51.280]   love their phones and use them constantly. But people are
[00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:54.440]   skipping a generation of phones. And if you look at Apple's
[00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:57.360]   revenue, they're having a very hard time getting people to
[00:36:57.360 --> 00:37:00.360]   upgrade. And so I think that's going to flatten out, they will
[00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:03.000]   keep trying to squeeze money out of it. I don't know what you
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:06.120]   guys spent on your iPhone 15. If you got it, but I, I always buy
[00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:09.400]   the top of the line. And I think it was 14 or $1500 this time.
[00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:13.320]   And when I got the accountants, they said, Oh, is this a new
[00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:16.720]   laptop? I said, No, it's a new phone. But I think this is going
[00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:19.760]   to slow down and people will, during austerity, they're going
[00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:22.000]   to skip two or three versions of it. I know I skipped for the
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:25.200]   first time I skipped the 14 this time around. So I'm going with
[00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:28.320]   smartphone manufacturers and Apple would be obviously the tip
[00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:31.840]   of that spear. Let's keep moving our next prediction. biggest
[00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:37.080]   business deal of 2024. biggest business deal of 2024. I went
[00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:40.160]   with last year, my prediction was Amazon getting into
[00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:43.320]   healthcare, maybe they buy Peloton or Roman hymns, and they
[00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:47.080]   have been getting into healthcare a bunch more. And my
[00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:50.040]   my wildcard was a CCP divesting of Tick Tock that didn't
[00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:53.160]   happen. to my view went Starlink goes public in a spin out from
[00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:57.080]   SpaceX at 75 billion. That didn't happen. But Starlink is
[00:37:57.080 --> 00:38:01.600]   doing fantastic. sacks. You said a deal between Putin and she and
[00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:06.680]   then freeberg. You said Petro for one trade, the Saudi China
[00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:09.680]   trade. Any thoughts on the predictions there? Doesn't look
[00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:10.840]   like anybody nailed it.
[00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:14.720]   Well, no, actually, Putin, she did make a deal their ties and
[00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:17.080]   urban stronger and the trade between those two countries
[00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:20.360]   keeps increasing as a result of the fact that we pushed Russia
[00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:22.640]   into China's arms. So that absolutely happened.
[00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:25.120]   And what's your prediction? This year, sex? biggest business
[00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:25.440]   deal,
[00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:30.200]   so actually, my biggest business deal is whatever the Fed decides
[00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:35.680]   to do to replace or extend btfp, the bank term funding program.
[00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:39.600]   Remember that the btfp, which is what the Fed used to bail out
[00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:43.520]   the regional banking system last year, and was like March or
[00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:46.520]   April, it was only supposed to last for one year, it's supposed
[00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:49.720]   to be a temporary program. But I do not think that the balance
[00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:53.920]   sheets of regional banks are healthy enough to survive
[00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:57.800]   without this continued liquidity from this program. So I think
[00:38:57.800 --> 00:39:00.520]   the Fed's gonna have to do something to either replace the
[00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:03.720]   program, extend the program, they're gonna have to do
[00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:07.200]   something. And I think that regional banks are still in
[00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:11.560]   pretty bad shape with, you know, impaired commercial debt
[00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:16.040]   portfolios. And they need this liquidity as long as the yield
[00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:20.560]   curve remains inverted. So I think the Fed is going to try
[00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:27.600]   and somehow figure out a program to keep these guys liquid until
[00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:32.840]   they can de invert the yield curve. And I think the Fed's
[00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:35.800]   trying to massage all of this into place without there being a
[00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:36.360]   recession.
[00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:38.680]   Seems like they'll be able to do it. Chamath, what do you got?
[00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:41.480]   I'm gonna go with the same thing. I think I was just off
[00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:45.560]   by your Starlink, Google Public. Hmm. Fascinating.
[00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:52.240]   I like it. And I had a similar theme, my wildcard, my wildcard
[00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:54.800]   last year that the CCP would divest of Tick Tock, I'm going
[00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:58.360]   to say this year, that I think Tick Tock goes public, and
[00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:03.240]   they'll be under pressure from different political factions to
[00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:06.040]   get the CCP off the board. So I'm going to go with by dance
[00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:08.680]   taking, going public or Tick Tock spinning out and going
[00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:11.440]   public some some version of that. Freeberg, what do you got
[00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:14.080]   for this year? We got some continuation bets here from Jake
[00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:17.160]   Allen. Yeah, I would keep going with my Petro. You want trade
[00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:20.400]   bet? I don't think that the US is going to let Saudi become a
[00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:24.960]   nuclear power. But so maybe leave that one outstanding. But
[00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:27.520]   I think rights holder is getting licensing deals for generative
[00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:30.120]   AI, or there's gonna be a couple of blockbuster deals this year.
[00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:34.240]   Great. Where you'll see like Disney license out a chunk of
[00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:38.240]   their library. So people can generate on demand video games
[00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:41.520]   or content or I don't know, you guys remember this company in
[00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:44.360]   the early 2000s called Zazzle? Do you remember that company?
[00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:47.680]   Yeah, what was that printed stuff on mugs? Yeah. And they
[00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:51.480]   had a big deal with Disney, where the idea was you could
[00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:56.040]   put any character in any way you want on any piece of like t
[00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:59.160]   shirt or mug or whatever merch. And it was like merch and it was
[00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:02.160]   a big deal. I think we see that again with generative AI this
[00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:04.840]   year where you can take for example, a character from a
[00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:08.560]   movie and generate them in an image. So anyone that has an
[00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:11.920]   interest in content rights will start to license it out and get
[00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:14.320]   a lot of value from it. Absolutely. Because a couple of
[00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:15.280]   big deals like that this year.
[00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:20.200]   Okay, most contrarian belief of 2024. I went American
[00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:23.200]   exceptionalism source. I think I like that prediction from last
[00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:25.840]   year ahead. Chamath you said inflation doesn't fall off a
[00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:29.920]   cliff as fast as people want. SAC says the bromance between
[00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:33.440]   Biden and Zelensky comes to an end. Freeberg you said 2023
[00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:36.160]   marks the beginning of the end of the US dollar as the global
[00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:37.360]   reserve currency.
[00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:38.640]   I nailed that one.
[00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:45.760]   It didn't fall off a cliff. It didn't. What was inflation in
[00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:49.760]   the first quarter of 2023? Just kidding. It fell. Oh, I'm like,
[00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:51.720]   yeah, wait a second.
[00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:53.920]   It's like, what the fuck you talking about?
[00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:57.400]   Yeah, sorry. You confusing me. I'm like, really? Wait a second.
[00:41:57.400 --> 00:42:00.480]   I think you get the Jim Cramer or the Professor Galloway moment
[00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:03.840]   for that prediction. Yeah, I think you might have missed that
[00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:07.760]   one by a bit. All right. What do you got? Chamath for this year?
[00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:09.680]   What do you got most contrarian belief of 2024?
[00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:15.520]   I think the enterprise value of open AI goes down. Okay, I don't
[00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:18.680]   think it has anything to do with open AI. I think it has
[00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:21.560]   everything to do with the rest of the industry. I think I think
[00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:24.680]   there's a couple of factors at play similar to what I just said
[00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:29.160]   earlier. But if you actually try to use these tools, which now I
[00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:34.320]   have been in my sort of day job as CEO, I've been trying to
[00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:38.280]   build models, Sonny's been helping me. My takeaway are two
[00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:41.840]   things. Number one is the latency right now, amongst all
[00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:45.640]   these AI tools, makes building production quality code
[00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:49.400]   absolutely impossible. So you can't have API's where you take
[00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:53.520]   30 4050 seconds in between a request to get data back. It's
[00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:58.840]   that's ridiculous. These needs to be non starter. Yeah. 50 3040
[00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:04.120]   70 milliseconds. Second is the actual cost of a million tokens
[00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:11.360]   on any of these platforms is economically untenable if you're
[00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:15.760]   trying to build something. So whether it's Amazon, whether
[00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:19.520]   it's together day I whether it's open AI, it's extremely,
[00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:24.040]   extremely expensive. So I think that capitalism would tell you
[00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:28.720]   that if these two things are true, you should expect people
[00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:34.200]   to arbitrage that opening. And so if you see cloud services come
[00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:37.800]   out that allow you to basically get millisecond latency batch
[00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:41.720]   size one, on the one hand, and second where you have pricing
[00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:46.880]   for a million tokens, that sort of 1020 cents, those folks and
[00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:49.480]   they'll need to build their own custom hardware to do it. But
[00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:54.520]   those folks will multiply the capability of this market by 1000
[00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:59.280]   x. And I think when that happens, the open source models
[00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:02.920]   really proliferate, proprietary models and closed models go
[00:44:02.920 --> 00:44:07.120]   under pressure. And the existing economics of how you make money
[00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:10.520]   today will get reallocated to those different players. And I
[00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:13.480]   think in that it's going to be very hard for existing folks, I
[00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:17.000]   would say the same is probably true for Nvidia. The folks that
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:21.160]   have won up until today, to maintain a multiple of market
[00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:24.640]   cap in this next year, that happens. And so my prediction is
[00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:27.800]   that will happen. And as a result, the enterprise values of
[00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:30.200]   those companies, and I think opening out will be the most
[00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:31.120]   obvious will go down.
[00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:33.600]   People buying secondary at 90 billion right now will be
[00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:34.720]   underwater next year,
[00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:39.280]   though it's, again, they have to believe that the revenue
[00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:42.160]   composition today is sustainable. And if you look
[00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:45.120]   under the hood, half the revenue is consumers paying
[00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:48.200]   subscriptions. The other half the revenue are enterprises
[00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:52.200]   paying for essentially some version of AWS. Yes. But the
[00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:58.040]   problem is that version of AWS is economically non functional,
[00:44:58.040 --> 00:45:01.800]   it's unsustainable. It's way too expensive, and it's way too
[00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:05.160]   slow. And by the way, that's just not an open AI problem.
[00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:08.200]   It's an entire industry problem. And so if this industry is
[00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:11.960]   really going to be real, it needs to be literally dirt cheap
[00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:13.880]   and as close to zero as possible. The minute that that
[00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:15.920]   happens, that revenue goes away.
[00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:17.640]   So then they're just left with the subscription.
[00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:20.280]   By the way, the people that provide that will be the ones
[00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:24.880]   that have the hardware to enable that 1000 xing of the cost,
[00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:28.640]   which is Azure, AWS. No, no, no, no, I think these are
[00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:30.480]   startups that are building proprietary hardware.
[00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:33.680]   Oh, okay. Wow. So there's another prediction. freebird
[00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:36.240]   what do you got 2024 prediction was contrarian belief.
[00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:39.920]   Okay, so I don't think we're past the conflict escalation
[00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:44.560]   stage, I think things are only going to continue to mount. So
[00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:50.080]   a lot of the theater that we see on a global stage is more
[00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:54.680]   fundamentally driven by these big cycles that we're in. So I
[00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:59.080]   think a big one and a kind of tactical one, I think the big
[00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:02.880]   one that's contrarian is that there's an increased probability
[00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:05.480]   of a nuclear weapon being used for the first time in conflict.
[00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:09.960]   And I think that that's conditioned on the fact that
[00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:15.360]   there are declining military supplies, there's declining
[00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:18.800]   appetite and capacity to support traditional conflict meat
[00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:21.840]   grinder type conflicts that we're seeing sprout up
[00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:24.800]   everywhere right now. And we're not everywhere, but in a lot of
[00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:28.680]   places. And you could see a moment where, as I mentioned in
[00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:31.240]   the past, someone gets backed into a corner and a tactical
[00:46:31.240 --> 00:46:34.360]   low yield nuclear weapon gets used. And I think that when you
[00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:36.760]   do that, it opens up the gates to hell. So it's a little scary.
[00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:40.240]   That's why, you know, we all joking aside, that's why you
[00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:43.000]   bought the radiation suits. And I and by the way, I don't think
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.120]   this is a high probability. And I'm not joking. It's I don't
[00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:47.120]   think it's a high probability. I think it's like one, you know,
[00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:49.760]   call it one to 2% chance something like this happens. But
[00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:53.760]   it's 10x where it was five years ago. And so that's my outcome of
[00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:57.720]   this is terrifying. Yeah, it's such a significant event that
[00:46:57.720 --> 00:47:00.920]   it's it's definitely one to kind of be be thoughtful about. And
[00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:02.880]   then the other one that I kind of said was tactical is I think
[00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:07.640]   there's a risk that Turkey gets challenged to leave NATO that a
[00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:11.880]   lot of what's going on right now where Turkey is siding with
[00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:14.720]   Hamas. This has obviously been talked about and rumored about
[00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:17.440]   for a long time. There's no real mechanism, by the way for
[00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:20.720]   kicking a member out of NATO. But I'll share with you guys,
[00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:22.640]   there's a lot of political commentary that Turkey cannot be
[00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:26.160]   a trusted ally. And obviously that now, you know, Turkey is
[00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:30.280]   siding with folks who are actual threats to the West, the US
[00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:32.360]   incentive is you don't want to see Turkey with the biggest one
[00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:36.720]   of the biggest armies in Europe, run into Russia's arms. You're
[00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:39.360]   going to try to keep them in NATO. But there is a real risk
[00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:42.960]   that you start to see the first fracturing of NATO happen with
[00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:45.520]   Turkey being asked to leave or some negotiation on something
[00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:48.880]   that happens this year. So that's one that I keep an eye on
[00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:51.440]   that is certainly not top of anyone's mind. But it certainly
[00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:56.160]   begins to beg the question of the importance of NATO.
[00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:59.160]   What do you got sacks? Your most contrarian belief?
[00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:03.480]   Well, can I first make a comment on last year's pick? Yes, it's
[00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:05.920]   okay. So I, you know, last year, I felt like I was going out on a
[00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:09.320]   limb predicting a rift in the bromance between Biden and
[00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:13.320]   Zelensky because that relationship seems so tight. And
[00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:17.080]   with about four days left in the year, there was this article
[00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:19.920]   that came out in Politico that says the Biden administration is
[00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:22.480]   quietly shifting its strategy in Ukraine, the article basically
[00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:25.280]   says that the administration wants to go on the defensive.
[00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:28.640]   And I think pretty clearly it wants a ceasefire and a frozen
[00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:33.680]   conflict. It wants to get this conflict sort of out of the way
[00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:36.920]   swept under the rug before the election season really cranks
[00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:40.720]   into high gear. And the problem they have is that Zelensky does
[00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:45.120]   not want to negotiate a ceasefire with Russia that would
[00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:48.920]   involve Ukraine losing territory. So there is now a
[00:48:48.920 --> 00:48:53.000]   rift between maybe not Biden himself, but let's say Biden
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:56.040]   operatives, the Biden administration, and what
[00:48:56.040 --> 00:49:01.400]   Zelensky wants. And I think this will be the theme in 2024 is how
[00:49:01.400 --> 00:49:05.000]   do you reign in Zelensky after you've been telling the public
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:08.040]   for the last two years that our job is to support whatever
[00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:08.960]   Zelensky wants,
[00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:10.840]   and your prediction for this year,
[00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:13.920]   so my prediction for for this year is that the soft landing
[00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:17.560]   gets very bumpy. I think that over the last two months of the
[00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:20.640]   year, I think markets got super optimistic, they started pricing
[00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:23.880]   in big Fed rate cuts, you know, let's call it one and a half
[00:49:23.880 --> 00:49:27.760]   percent. So we had this huge stock market rally in November,
[00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:31.160]   December, and I think there's generally a very strong belief
[00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:34.680]   that the Fed will be able to pull off the soft landing. I'm
[00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:37.080]   not necessarily saying that there's going to be a recession.
[00:49:37.080 --> 00:49:40.280]   I just, you know, I feel like I predicted 10 of the last two
[00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:44.080]   recessions. I keep basically predicting recession when
[00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:48.120]   there's not one. But I do think that there's just been too much
[00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:53.240]   too soon of this euphoria. And I just think that this year is
[00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:56.600]   going to be a lot bumpier than that, both politically and
[00:49:56.600 --> 00:50:00.080]   economically. So I think there's just a little bit too much
[00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:02.480]   euphoria and overoptimism right now.
[00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:05.480]   I'm tempted to go again with American exceptionalism. I think
[00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:09.640]   I nailed that last year. America just had an amazing year in 2023
[00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:14.160]   while Xi Jinping made unforced errors and getting rid of
[00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:16.240]   capitalism in his country and nobody starting companies,
[00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:18.080]   they're on stock market falling apart, real estate falling
[00:50:18.080 --> 00:50:20.640]   apart. And now he's coming back to America, as we saw when he
[00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:23.400]   had a summit with Biden, asking people, please come back and
[00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:27.400]   invest again, huge unforced error. And I think Russia with
[00:50:27.400 --> 00:50:29.960]   the huge unforced error of losing hundreds of 1000s of
[00:50:29.960 --> 00:50:33.160]   their citizens, their young people to a senseless war for no
[00:50:33.160 --> 00:50:37.320]   reason, and losing customers in the West, like Germany, as you
[00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:40.840]   pointed out, sacks, I think American exceptionalism will
[00:50:40.840 --> 00:50:43.960]   continue to soar. But I don't want to take the same
[00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:48.560]   prediction. So I also consider two other options Apple making
[00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:51.080]   huge gains in generative AI and then streaming services,
[00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:55.360]   rightsizing and becoming highly profitable and having a rebound
[00:50:55.360 --> 00:50:58.520]   between those two. I think I'm going to go with Apple. As my
[00:50:58.520 --> 00:51:01.000]   contrarian belief, I think Apple is going to become a player in
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:05.520]   AI. The end of the year, maybe they reboot Siri, but they're
[00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:08.480]   going to figure something out. And I think they're not going to
[00:51:08.480 --> 00:51:12.640]   remain on the sidelines when it comes to AI. So I'm going to go
[00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:16.760]   with Apple making huge gains in generative AI or AI in general,
[00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:20.880]   maybe a new Siri coming soon. best performing asset of 2024.
[00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:24.200]   In 2023. I went with seed stage investing, I think I'll be
[00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:27.200]   proven right in five years. But that's kind of hard to prove in
[00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:30.160]   the short term. Chamath you said cash and the front end of the
[00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:33.040]   yield curve. It's actually what we short term T bills as well.
[00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:37.200]   And freeberg you went with semiconductor capital equipment,
[00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:40.320]   oil gas services, pharma infrastructure, anybody have
[00:51:40.320 --> 00:51:41.720]   thoughts on their predictions from last year?
[00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:45.360]   That was pretty good at 5%. No kidding, right? As good as it
[00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:48.640]   gets. This is not a lot of motivation to enter the markets
[00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:51.480]   when you're earning five, five and a half percent risk free.
[00:51:51.480 --> 00:51:56.240]   Okay, so let's do our 20. equipment up 60%. Amazing. Good
[00:51:56.240 --> 00:51:59.040]   year. Good year. freeberg. Well, what do you got? What's your
[00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:01.240]   prediction for best performing asset of this coming year?
[00:52:01.240 --> 00:52:07.320]   Oh, I took the uranium ETF. You are easy money. Whether it plays
[00:52:07.320 --> 00:52:09.800]   out in the next 12 months or over time, I'm not sure it's
[00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:12.680]   just an inevitability. A lot of folks have this bet on this
[00:52:12.680 --> 00:52:16.880]   trade on it's it's kind of an inventory that we have to see.
[00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:21.880]   It's a it's an index on businesses that benefit from
[00:52:21.880 --> 00:52:24.960]   mining and producing nuclear power with money or any and
[00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:28.360]   producing nuclear power. China is building up 450 nuclear power
[00:52:28.360 --> 00:52:30.480]   stations as we've talked about, there's a lot of ESG driven
[00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:33.280]   demand, and a lot of conflict driven demand, big shift
[00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:38.400]   underway. A lot of deregulatory effort underway globally to try
[00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:42.280]   and get nuclear back on track. Nuclear power back on track. So
[00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:44.640]   these companies are going to benefit from this big macro
[00:52:44.640 --> 00:52:47.920]   cycle. So it's a and this is an existing ETF or you're saying
[00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:51.560]   you roll one? No, it's called you uranium. It's uranium.
[00:52:51.560 --> 00:52:57.760]   Tracking ETF URA is the ticker. I like that a lot. And I do a lot
[00:52:57.760 --> 00:53:00.400]   of esoteric general statements. This one I thought I'd go a
[00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:03.720]   little specific. I like it. I mean, it's it's a great
[00:53:03.720 --> 00:53:07.200]   prediction. And sentiment has certainly changed here in the US
[00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:10.040]   where we've been on right. So since I'll just tell you guys,
[00:53:10.560 --> 00:53:14.400]   it bottomed out in March of this year at 19 bucks, it's up 50%
[00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:19.600]   since then. And in the last five years, you know, it's up to x.
[00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:24.000]   But plenty of room to run if you look at the underlying assets
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:25.200]   that BTF tracks
[00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:28.800]   to my best performing asset of 2024. What's your prediction? I
[00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:31.320]   have to do it with the worst performing asset of 2024.
[00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:36.120]   Because it's a bit of a spread trade. So I'm going to take the
[00:53:36.160 --> 00:53:40.360]   public software index, tech stock index, and my short is
[00:53:40.360 --> 00:53:45.000]   going to be the private tech software companies, the late
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:48.800]   stage, mostly SaaS companies. And I think we've all talked
[00:53:48.800 --> 00:53:50.520]   about the reasons why but I think that the terminal
[00:53:50.520 --> 00:53:54.800]   valuations are getting reset in the public markets. I don't
[00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:58.880]   think the growth rates are there in the private companies. And so
[00:53:58.880 --> 00:54:03.520]   you're going to have a reset on valuation. In many cases that
[00:54:03.520 --> 00:54:06.880]   reset may just be that they stay at the same valuation three
[00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:11.400]   years later, even after doubling revenue, or more. The problem is
[00:54:11.400 --> 00:54:16.320]   you will have taken another 30% dilution between now and then
[00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:18.240]   because of all the stock based comp that these private
[00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:23.160]   companies give out so long the public tech cycle short the
[00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:26.640]   private late stage tech cycle expecting a valuation
[00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:27.840]   contraction in the latter.
[00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:29.440]   What do you got sex? What do you think's gonna be the best
[00:54:29.440 --> 00:54:31.880]   performing asset of 2024?
[00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:36.160]   Well, I'm really not sure about this. So I would urge nobody to
[00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:37.560]   actually trade on this. But
[00:54:37.560 --> 00:54:42.080]   not investment advice. Be clear. None of this is investment
[00:54:42.080 --> 00:54:42.440]   advice.
[00:54:42.440 --> 00:54:45.120]   I'm not I'm not trading on this on these predictions. So you
[00:54:45.120 --> 00:54:50.360]   shouldn't either. My guess here just a guess is energy is energy
[00:54:50.360 --> 00:54:54.920]   stocks, energy prices could be among the top performers of
[00:54:54.920 --> 00:54:59.560]   2024. Just because there's so much risk of conflict breaking
[00:54:59.560 --> 00:55:03.400]   out now and escalating. So I agree with freeberg that there
[00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:06.760]   are huge risks of escalation in the Middle East, the Ukraine
[00:55:06.760 --> 00:55:10.000]   war still going on. I think not enough attention is being paid
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:15.600]   to what's happening between Venezuela and Guyana. Venezuela
[00:55:15.600 --> 00:55:19.920]   is basically attempting to annex Guyana's offshore oil
[00:55:19.920 --> 00:55:23.800]   reserves, which are huge. This is basically just pure theft.
[00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:28.640]   Ethiopia also has tense relationships with a few of its
[00:55:28.640 --> 00:55:31.840]   neighbors. And I could easily see there being a war that
[00:55:31.840 --> 00:55:38.560]   breaks out between Ethiopia and Egypt or Ethiopia and Eritrea.
[00:55:38.560 --> 00:55:41.560]   And then that could spill over and create further disruption in
[00:55:41.560 --> 00:55:44.160]   the Red Sea. We also still have this unresolved issue of the
[00:55:44.160 --> 00:55:48.200]   hoodies. And of course, you have neocons brain for war with Iran
[00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:50.720]   as they always do. John Bolton just published another piece
[00:55:50.720 --> 00:55:53.680]   saying that we had to go to war with Iran. So there's just so
[00:55:53.680 --> 00:55:59.240]   many ways that the conflict could escalate and create, I
[00:55:59.240 --> 00:56:00.840]   think a spike in the price of oil.
[00:56:00.840 --> 00:56:04.800]   All right, you know, I'd love to, I in my heart of hearts, I
[00:56:04.800 --> 00:56:07.600]   believe the best performing asset will still be seed stage
[00:56:07.600 --> 00:56:12.880]   startups. But I'm going to go with consumer comfort services.
[00:56:12.880 --> 00:56:17.280]   I think as austerity measures and this, whether we have a
[00:56:17.280 --> 00:56:20.840]   soft landing or recession, it's clear that consumers have spent
[00:56:20.840 --> 00:56:23.680]   all their money. So they're going to go for small luxuries
[00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:28.440]   like DoorDash, Airbnb, Uber, small things to have great
[00:56:28.440 --> 00:56:32.200]   experiences. And I'm talking my book in two out of those three,
[00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:34.960]   which I own shares in. But I think consumers are going to
[00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:39.200]   keep treating themselves to getting some DoorDash or, you
[00:56:39.200 --> 00:56:41.520]   know, getting an Airbnb and going to Japan or whatever it
[00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:44.280]   happens to be. So consumer comfort services is my pick for
[00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:48.320]   the best performing asset of 2024. worst performing asset,
[00:56:48.320 --> 00:56:51.040]   let's go right on to worst performing asset. We're cooking
[00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:54.360]   with oil, worst performing asset, I will with energy
[00:56:54.360 --> 00:56:57.400]   Chamapo and tech energy junk debt, sacks, what would office
[00:56:57.400 --> 00:57:00.360]   hours in San Francisco, and Freiburg went with consumer
[00:57:00.360 --> 00:57:02.840]   credit? Well, I think we nailed it in almost all those cases
[00:57:02.840 --> 00:57:08.400]   here. What do we got for 2024? It's actually got a 2024
[00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:11.120]   prediction of worst performing asset. Again, this is not
[00:57:11.120 --> 00:57:12.080]   investing advice.
[00:57:12.080 --> 00:57:14.680]   Yeah, so I'm not going to trade on this. So just take it with a
[00:57:14.680 --> 00:57:19.720]   grain of salt. But I would bet against the magnificent seven,
[00:57:19.720 --> 00:57:23.440]   just because I believe that what goes up must come down and the
[00:57:23.440 --> 00:57:27.040]   hotter they are, the harder they fall. I'm not saying that the
[00:57:27.040 --> 00:57:29.240]   magnificent seven are actually going to go down. I'm just
[00:57:29.240 --> 00:57:33.520]   saying that the S&P 493 are going to catch up a little bit.
[00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:37.760]   So I would book this as a spread trade, where I would bet on the
[00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:42.440]   S&P 493 over the magnificent seven because again, I just
[00:57:42.440 --> 00:57:47.400]   think that there's got to be some catching up here. And the
[00:57:47.400 --> 00:57:50.320]   huge gains made by the mason magnificent seven were really
[00:57:50.320 --> 00:57:57.600]   based on story, you know, based on AI. And I don't see why those
[00:57:57.600 --> 00:58:01.920]   gains should be limited to the minutes and seven if AI is going
[00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:03.520]   to play such a big role in the economy.
[00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:09.160]   Chama I too, when you predicted earlier about opening, I losing
[00:58:09.160 --> 00:58:13.200]   some value, my worst performing asset in 2024 is LLM startups,
[00:58:13.200 --> 00:58:15.880]   I believe they've been massively overvalued. And I believe open
[00:58:15.880 --> 00:58:19.120]   source is making an incredible run at them. And I think they're
[00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:21.880]   going to hit parity. And there's too many players. This is like
[00:58:21.880 --> 00:58:25.360]   having 15 search engines or 20. Amazon's there's just too many
[00:58:25.360 --> 00:58:28.160]   players and there's too much parity. The prices make no
[00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:31.800]   sense. And I think they're all going to come down by, you know,
[00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:36.160]   50 6070 80% in terms of their valuations, and that won't get
[00:58:36.160 --> 00:58:38.800]   marked in their books. But that will be the reality of where
[00:58:38.800 --> 00:58:41.480]   their stocks will trade on the private markets. freeburg,
[00:58:41.480 --> 00:58:44.520]   which are worst performing, and worst performing,
[00:58:44.520 --> 00:58:50.640]   shared earlier, I would go short vertical SAS, vertical software
[00:58:50.640 --> 00:58:55.000]   companies and long cloud providers that have AI tools and
[00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:58.960]   platforms that will allow enterprises to build custom
[00:58:58.960 --> 00:59:03.720]   applications in a low cost, low code way. And so you could
[00:59:03.720 --> 00:59:06.480]   obviously pick the companies that would go in that bucket, go
[00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:08.840]   along those those cloud bucket and go short the vertical
[00:59:08.840 --> 00:59:14.040]   bucket. Is there like a per seat price threshold that you think
[00:59:14.040 --> 00:59:17.040]   would kind of demarcate the companies that you think are at
[00:59:17.040 --> 00:59:20.200]   risk? In other words, like, I invest in plenty of SAS
[00:59:20.200 --> 00:59:26.160]   companies that sell seats at 510 bucks per month. I'm just like
[00:59:26.160 --> 00:59:29.080]   very skeptical. It's not going to get that it's worth an
[00:59:29.080 --> 00:59:32.240]   enterprise as well to recreate that software. And so I'll give
[00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:35.560]   you an example that there's a vertical software provider,
[00:59:35.560 --> 00:59:44.880]   we're paying 5 grand per seat per year, right now. And we look
[00:59:44.880 --> 00:59:47.920]   at that and we're like, okay, it's basically a data management
[00:59:47.920 --> 00:59:51.320]   tool for our particular vertical. Let's just go recreate
[00:59:51.320 --> 00:59:53.480]   that and did it very quickly, very low cost. And we're gonna
[00:59:53.480 --> 00:59:56.920]   replace it. Cut that out. I don't wanna say that. But yeah.
[00:59:58.600 --> 01:00:02.880]   Is it? So it's like, you know, very specific, very expensive.
[01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:04.680]   But I mean, sacks, you can probably see the same thing
[01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:08.360]   happen in sales CRM type tools that are obviously also very
[01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:12.600]   expensive. And how much is it data? How much do you pay? 5
[01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:12.920]   grand?
[01:00:12.920 --> 01:00:19.000]   5 grand per year. So that's basically every $40 a seat per
[01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:23.520]   like 100 employees. So we're paying like 500 grand. And so
[01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:27.520]   one of our software engineers is like this spins up a replacement
[01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:29.120]   for we're gonna roll it out in q1.
[01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:32.880]   Okay, so is there is there like a per seat per month price that
[01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:36.360]   you think starts to where it doesn't work? Is it 50 bucks?
[01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:37.160]   What is the number?
[01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:39.840]   I mean, I do the math. But yeah, it shouldn't be in the range
[01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:42.320]   that it's at, for sure. But a lot of these guys where they had
[01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:45.240]   a monopoly, and it wasn't worth the company's time to try and
[01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:48.200]   invest in software, at the price point that they were charging,
[01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:51.280]   they found a market now the market has to compress. So I'm
[01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:53.320]   not saying that the companies go away. But I do think pricing
[01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:55.160]   compression is going to hurt these businesses a lot.
[01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:58.800]   If you pay could pay 50,000 for the same software instead of 500
[01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:01.200]   you would not have spun it up yourself. So there is a
[01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:04.160]   reasonable number between those two, right? And that reasonable
[01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:05.880]   number might be 250 or something.
[01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:08.800]   But in here's the thing that we need to also factor in, which is
[01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:12.560]   that free books companies that engineer could also then just
[01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:15.960]   release that product for everybody else to use at 10
[01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:20.040]   cents. And everybody else will then use it, because it'll be
[01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:23.280]   good enough. And that and that 80% of the company will take
[01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:25.760]   over the will take over the market. Yeah, that's my point.
[01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:27.440]   There's gonna be pricing compression. This is the thing
[01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:29.560]   like I think that people underestimate how deflationary
[01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:32.440]   this whole thing is. It's like, yeah, it's like two to three
[01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:35.040]   orders of magnitude more deflationary than people have
[01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:35.880]   any inkling of.
[01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:40.400]   Yeah. Interestingly, I had David Handmaier Hanson on this week
[01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:42.600]   and startups and they're releasing something called one
[01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:45.200]   stock calm where they're going to charge for software one time
[01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:48.480]   like we used to do. And their first product is a slack killer.
[01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:52.120]   And so the idea of paying per seat for slack, what they're
[01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:57.200]   planning to do is just charge you, you know, a 95. No, you
[01:01:57.200 --> 01:02:00.920]   find a hosting company. So okay, so it's like old school. It's
[01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:01.480]   old school.
[01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:05.240]   On prem software on prem, and then you pay you pay an upgrade
[01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:07.880]   fee when you upgrade the software, basically, I think
[01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:10.520]   they're gonna be paying them like a maintenance percentage.
[01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:10.840]   That's the way
[01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:13.480]   it's always work school enterprise software, right? The
[01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:16.640]   pricing model was the revenue model was always built that when
[01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:20.280]   you did a sale, you would make on average 20% of the revenue
[01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:24.760]   per year in update fees. And so now and then everything switched
[01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:27.840]   to SAS, which is continuous support, support, maintenance,
[01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:30.680]   all that kind of stuff. So it's never they say it's one time.
[01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:33.240]   It's one time for the software. But if you want to stay up to
[01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:36.440]   date, and get support and patches and all that kind of
[01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:36.760]   stuff,
[01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:39.080]   yeah, and the old school enterprise software model was
[01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:42.320]   always like, figure 20% of the install cost.
[01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:45.720]   Right. And by the way, this is one of the reasons why Oracle
[01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:49.040]   made so much money is they did a roll up of all these old school
[01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:52.680]   on prem software companies that weren't growing, but the
[01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:55.880]   maintenance fees were just rolling in forever. Yeah. And
[01:02:55.880 --> 01:02:57.120]   they rolled all that stuff up.
[01:02:57.120 --> 01:03:00.000]   And then probably raise the fees. I mean, for me, you know,
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.120]   when you have a 20 person company, 50 person company, the
[01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:06.240]   slack fees don't seem like a big deal. But when you get to, you
[01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:08.600]   know, when you're spending 500,000 or a million dollars a
[01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:11.040]   year on something like slack, you know, then maybe you would
[01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:13.400]   consider other options. And I know people at large
[01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:15.560]   organizations that have done that, because there's an open
[01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:18.880]   source competitor to it. So that does exist in the world. Okay,
[01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:21.480]   number one, freeberg is bringing up is like, why would you
[01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:27.480]   support 500,000 to million dollar a year, op ex for
[01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:31.360]   software? I mean, can you really put a model together that shows
[01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:34.400]   that that's somehow accretive to you, especially if you're a
[01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:37.480]   money losing startup? It just doesn't make any logical sense.
[01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:38.720]   I understand that it happens.
[01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:42.000]   And the fact that that software SAS companies have been able to
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:45.720]   make 80 to 90% margins and grow on that it has created the best
[01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:48.800]   business model in history. But I think what may become apparent
[01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:53.080]   now is that the SAS business model is really a temporary
[01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:56.520]   phenomenon that existed between ubiquity of the internet and the
[01:03:56.520 --> 01:04:00.600]   development of AI and low cost low code tools for developing
[01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:01.080]   software.
[01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:03.560]   Yeah, the dirt it was an arbitrage of the dearth of
[01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:06.160]   engineers, it was the gross margin that was correlated to
[01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:06.480]   the lab.
[01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:10.000]   And now now that the work that software engineers could have
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:13.600]   done has been automated into software itself, you are going
[01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:17.560]   to see a lot of that arbitrage say differently, freeberg, you
[01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:20.960]   could say like the number of engineers has now multiplied by
[01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:21.640]   a million fold.
[01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:25.400]   That's right. And now everyone has them available. So then the
[01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:27.880]   gross margins, we're not going to be 90% the gross margins,
[01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:31.520]   maybe 30%. And so so everything gets competed away. And pricing
[01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:33.640]   goes down pricing gets compressed. And that's why this
[01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:36.240]   is a big macro trend for me, like, I'm just seeing it across
[01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:38.560]   every company, everyone's rethinking whether or not the
[01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:41.000]   baby seat fees for all different types of software tools.
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:44.600]   By the way, the the part of that which is economically true is if
[01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:48.680]   you look at every other category in the economy, and you look at
[01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:51.520]   the gross margin profile of businesses that are not pure
[01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:56.600]   play tech, we have grown up and we've monetized this belief that
[01:04:56.600 --> 01:05:00.400]   tech companies not only can start at 80 to 90%, but stay
[01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:03.520]   there and definitely there. Yeah, they should be at 40%. Not
[01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:07.440]   even every other market can start off in the 50 6070%. When
[01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:10.680]   they're nascent, but capitalism competes away those margins down
[01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:15.320]   to 30 to 40%. Right. And a best in class business generates 20
[01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:18.920]   to 25% EBITDA margins on a sustained basis. Yeah. So if you
[01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:23.560]   believe that the average best run company is a 35% gross
[01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:27.920]   margin business with 20 to 25% free cash flow margins. tech
[01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:31.360]   stocks have a long way to go down. Exactly. Exactly. It was
[01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:34.720]   software software companies. Yeah, software companies. But if
[01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:38.440]   it's priced below the cost of you rebuilding it, then you're
[01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:41.440]   not you're just it's a buyer. No, no, no. But the point is,
[01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:44.160]   the point is like when somebody does that, so Friedberg's
[01:05:44.160 --> 01:05:47.720]   company did that work. He doesn't even need to need want
[01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:50.280]   to make a profit from that software to just say anybody
[01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:54.160]   else can use this. I have an auto GPT that will basically
[01:05:54.160 --> 01:05:58.480]   configure myself to you if you want to use it. And now that n
[01:05:58.480 --> 01:06:01.240]   plus first company who's starting up with two or three
[01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:05.480]   people can now raise an order of magnitude less money, and we'll
[01:06:05.480 --> 01:06:09.920]   write the GPT that connects to his. And now has this. So this
[01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:12.960]   is my point where like it just it's it's it's just a race to
[01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:16.720]   the bottom. Yeah. All right. Last year, for our most
[01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:21.200]   anticipated trend, Chamath and I both picked austerity feels
[01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:22.720]   like that came to fruition.
[01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:27.640]   You're kidding, right? We did not see any austerity. We added
[01:06:27.640 --> 01:06:28.960]   like 2 trillion to the
[01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:34.240]   34 trillion. I was talking about consumers and companies and
[01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:39.000]   individuals. consumers didn't didn't cut either. I mean, they
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.440]   kept spending and in fact, credit card debt is now at the
[01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:43.720]   highest level it's ever been. So where's the austerity?
[01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:48.000]   I think it's happening right now where people are maxed out.
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:51.040]   You're starting to see it happen with travel in some of those
[01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:53.880]   areas. But yeah, we could be off by six months on this one.
[01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:56.920]   Sachs, you said Trump's influence in the GOP wanes.
[01:06:56.920 --> 01:07:00.440]   That was definitely wrong. Yeah. That was wishful thinking.
[01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:05.600]   Freeberg, cell gene therapy for you. For you to know.
[01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:08.360]   You don't want him as your candidate.
[01:07:08.360 --> 01:07:12.520]   Well, I can explain that. I mean, at the end of 2022, we had
[01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:14.560]   that election that was supposed to be a red wave and it turned
[01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:17.480]   into a red puddle. Remember that? And it was a loser reason.
[01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:20.400]   Yeah, it was a big loser for the GOP. And a lot of the
[01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:24.400]   candidates, I'd say in particular, the candidates who
[01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:27.280]   had been endorsed and supported by Trump ended up losing not
[01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:31.120]   doing very well. So and then by contrast, it seemed like the one
[01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:34.400]   part of the country where the Republicans done incredibly well
[01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:37.600]   was in Florida, where obviously the Sanchez won by like 20
[01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:42.320]   points and added seats to their majority in the legislature. So
[01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:46.520]   it seemed like going into the year that the Sanchez was kind
[01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:49.760]   of the heir apparent and Trump's influence would wane. But like
[01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:52.080]   you said, that may have been wishful thinking is clearly not
[01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:57.000]   what's happened. But a big part of the reason why Trump's
[01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.760]   influence is greater than ever is because of all this lawfare,
[01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:03.640]   all these indictments against him and this prosecution and
[01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:07.400]   persecution of him by Biden and his minions. It's really I think
[01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:09.960]   galvanized the base to support Trump
[01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:13.760]   freeberg. We last year you said cell gene therapy becoming more
[01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:18.360]   mainstream. How did that one pan out your prediction? most
[01:08:18.360 --> 01:08:19.160]   infested trend?
[01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:21.880]   Are about mainstream, but I mean, we're seeing we've seen
[01:08:21.880 --> 01:08:25.360]   more approvals this year. It's been good. I mean, steady,
[01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:26.560]   steady pace of
[01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:28.960]   progress. So the sickle cell product come out, sickle cell
[01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:31.200]   came to market. Yep. There's a few more that got approved. So
[01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:34.920]   in cell therapy, so it's great. And we're seeing good progress
[01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:38.320]   there. And I remember there's like over 1000 in clinical. So
[01:08:38.320 --> 01:08:41.520]   there's this tidal wave coming to market soon of cell and gene
[01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:44.520]   therapies, they're going to have a profound effect on a lot of
[01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:46.400]   disease conditions. So really exciting.
[01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:48.800]   freeberg, you want to continue and tell us what you're most
[01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:49.320]   anticipated.
[01:08:49.320 --> 01:08:52.360]   Oh, so this year, I'm really excited. Based on the progress
[01:08:52.360 --> 01:08:58.840]   we've seen in 2023 of predictive models, AI driven discovery of
[01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:03.640]   novel molecules, materials and methods of production in
[01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:09.240]   biopharma, in chemical engineering, lots of new
[01:09:09.240 --> 01:09:13.760]   materials and new drugs that are actually coming out of software
[01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:18.480]   not coming out of brute force, wet lab discovery processing.
[01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:20.560]   And then we're also seeing these really amazing generative
[01:09:20.840 --> 01:09:24.840]   systems on production processes and chemistry that are going to
[01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:27.640]   unlock all of these new products and drop costs. Going back to
[01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:30.600]   the deflationary point, not only does this introduce new products
[01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:33.480]   into the world that are going to benefit humanity, but it reduces
[01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:35.840]   the cost of making them and reduces the footprint of making
[01:09:35.840 --> 01:09:39.040]   them. So there's a lot of great benefit coming from these
[01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:41.400]   predictive modeling tools that starting to percolate its way
[01:09:41.400 --> 01:09:43.560]   into these industries. So I'm excited about seeing what comes
[01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:45.680]   to market this year. I'm sure we're going to have a science
[01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:48.280]   corner at some point this year that says, look at this amazing
[01:09:48.280 --> 01:09:51.480]   new thing that was discovered in software, and it works. And it's
[01:09:51.480 --> 01:09:52.160]   going to be really cool.
[01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:56.760]   Okay, what do you got your mouth for your most anticipated trend
[01:09:56.760 --> 01:09:58.560]   of 2024? What are you most anticipating?
[01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:02.080]   I think this is the most important year for Bitcoin that
[01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:08.720]   has ever existed. We are probably days away from a series
[01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:14.360]   of ETFs being approved. And so this is the moment for Bitcoin
[01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:20.960]   to, to use that old term cross the chasm, and really see
[01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:24.360]   mainstream adoption where our parents and our grandparents
[01:10:24.360 --> 01:10:30.760]   understand what it is, can buy it, and then do buy it. And I
[01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:35.040]   think that if all of this comes to pass, Bitcoin will be a part
[01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:39.360]   of the traditional financial lexicon by the end of 2024. So
[01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:42.080]   that is my most anticipated trend of the year.
[01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:45.480]   What do you got sacks for your most implicit anticipated trend
[01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:46.280]   of the year sex,
[01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:48.800]   which most is a pretty good one. I think there's a version of
[01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:52.440]   that same thing in AI. I mean, I it's hard to know exactly what
[01:10:52.440 --> 01:10:56.280]   all the advancements are going to be in AI. But, you know, when
[01:10:56.280 --> 01:10:59.760]   we look back on it in five or 10 years, it's going to be pretty
[01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:04.440]   clear that the exponential pace of advancement in AI continued.
[01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:07.680]   And so I can't say exactly what those breakthroughs are going to
[01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:10.760]   be this year. But there certainly are going to be some
[01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:14.240]   and I think we'll see those innovations continue to
[01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:17.920]   percolate down to more and more of the average sort of mainstream
[01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:18.600]   consumer.
[01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:23.760]   sacks once again, you and I are simpatico. I picked my most
[01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:27.880]   anticipated trend of 2024 as efficiency in the form of AI
[01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:31.960]   advances and outsourcing. Basically, a lot of Americans
[01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:34.600]   don't want to work or they want to work from home or they want
[01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:38.160]   high salaries, we have record low unemployment. Thanks to
[01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:43.320]   Biden, I'm joking. But all of this is forcing people to build
[01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:48.960]   robots, AI, and software to route around, you know, and make
[01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:52.280]   things more efficient. And I think the number one trend I'm
[01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:55.200]   seeing from startups, and they tend to adopt this stuff early,
[01:11:55.200 --> 01:11:59.520]   is outsourcing to all other geographies around the world for
[01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:03.040]   work, because it's so easy once you have a work from home,
[01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:07.920]   philosophy, or paradigm at your company, while adding somebody
[01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:11.520]   from Portugal, Manila, Argentina, Canada is the same as
[01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:14.920]   adding somebody from outside of New York City or Silicon Valley
[01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:18.320]   or LA, but you can do so at a third of the price for somebody
[01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:24.200]   maybe who really wants the work. And so I think efficiency is my
[01:12:24.200 --> 01:12:27.760]   most anticipated trend, but in the form of AI and outsourcing.
[01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:33.000]   Okay, now, media, everybody loves we do our most anticipated
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:40.640]   media for 2024. For last year, I had Oppenheimer Wow, that was
[01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:43.360]   great. Chamath you had doing part two that was delayed.
[01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:46.280]   Sachs, you also had Oppenheimer What did you think of Oppenheimer
[01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:48.640]   Sachs? Who did deliver for you? Have you seen it?
[01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:54.320]   I thought it was good. Not great. It was very long. It's
[01:12:54.320 --> 01:12:56.520]   not a movie I need to see a second time. Let's put it that
[01:12:56.520 --> 01:12:56.760]   way.
[01:12:56.760 --> 01:13:00.640]   Okay. And free bird use generative AI based media. For
[01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:05.880]   this year, I'm I have to confess I have inside information. So my
[01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:10.320]   prediction is going to be the winner. It turns out our
[01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:16.720]   favorite DJ is dropping a new album in 2024. And I got a
[01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:20.440]   release track. So my most anticipated media, I'll just
[01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:23.240]   play the road be released track here. What is this?
[01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:25.800]   According to NASA, there's a new look at Uranus.
[01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:29.640]   Uranus. Uranus.
[01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:33.000]   Talk about my anus.
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:37.000]   Uranus. Uranus.
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:38.000]   This is young Spielberg.
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:43.040]   This is young Spielberg. Coming at you the summer jam of the
[01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:44.640]   year. Uranus.
[01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:48.600]   It's a banger.
[01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:53.280]   There it is. Talk about my anus. Coming at you.
[01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:53.680]   That was a banger.
[01:13:53.840 --> 01:13:56.640]   He obviously likes the deep base of my voice.
[01:13:56.640 --> 01:14:00.720]   He does like the deep base of your voice. Yes. So that's a
[01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:03.240]   banger. That's gonna be I think that that's gonna carry it's
[01:14:03.240 --> 01:14:07.000]   gonna be the summer anthem. The new album from young Spielberg
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:11.360]   dropping that's the lead title track. Uranus coming at you. I
[01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:14.200]   also am looking forward to gladiator two is coming out
[01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:17.840]   really Scott Lucius, the nephew of comedists is a grown man.
[01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:21.040]   It's going to be awesome. I hope and Netflix is three body
[01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:23.680]   problem. If you haven't read the books, they're great. And
[01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:26.640]   that's being done by the Game of Thrones guys. That's gonna be
[01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:29.120]   awesome. And that's gonna be awesome.
[01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:31.200]   D&D
[01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:34.000]   Anyway, three body problem gladiator two for me.
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:35.880]   Once the books ran out, they were kind of
[01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:36.600]   Yeah.
[01:14:36.600 --> 01:14:39.280]   They were kind of on their own there and the show kind of
[01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:39.800]   declined.
[01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:43.840]   It was a terrible last season. In this case, the three body
[01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:46.400]   problem is a complete series and it's it's mind blowing in terms
[01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:47.760]   of its epicness.
[01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:52.080]   It's asked what's your most anticipated media of 2024? Is
[01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:55.880]   there a Putin biography coming out? Is it Alex Jones's
[01:14:55.880 --> 01:14:59.880]   biography 10 part series on Netflix? Looking forward to?
[01:14:59.880 --> 01:15:03.200]   Well, I agree with you about gladiator two. We actually have
[01:15:03.200 --> 01:15:05.680]   similar tastes in movies. I'm also looking forward to House of
[01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:10.240]   the Dragon season two. Oh, yeah. But one project I will give a
[01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:14.640]   little plug to is Jimmy Sony's book, the founders, which is the
[01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:17.320]   story of PayPal and the entrepreneurs who shaped Silicon
[01:15:17.320 --> 01:15:20.800]   Valley. Yes, that came out in 2022. The reason I'm mentioning
[01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:24.800]   it is because I optioned this book along with Jack Selby,
[01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:29.960]   who's another PayPal mafia alum who has a film company. And so
[01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:32.720]   we've optioned this and we have just made a deal with Drake's
[01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:36.800]   company called dream crew to turn this into some sort of
[01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:39.880]   television series could be done as a docu. Wait, did you say
[01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:42.600]   Drake, the musician Drake? Yeah, he actually has a very
[01:15:42.600 --> 01:15:45.960]   successful production company called dream crew. They're the
[01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:50.480]   producers of euphoria, which is this huge hit on HBO. Terrifying.
[01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:53.160]   So they've decided to it is kind of a terrifying show.
[01:15:53.160 --> 01:15:56.280]   It is terrifying.
[01:15:56.280 --> 01:15:57.520]   Terrifying.
[01:15:57.520 --> 01:15:59.520]   It's an incredible show, but terrifying. And yeah, it is
[01:15:59.520 --> 01:16:03.840]   scary. But anyway, it's a big hit. So they produced a lot of
[01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:07.800]   not just music, but television content. They're very interested
[01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:10.520]   in the story. And so we're partnering with them to create a
[01:16:10.520 --> 01:16:13.800]   TV show. So hopefully that comes together this year. Are you in
[01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:14.920]   production this year on it? Or is it
[01:16:14.920 --> 01:16:16.520]   now it's going to development this year?
[01:16:16.520 --> 01:16:21.520]   You get any credit sex? Yeah. Oh, how much does it cost the
[01:16:21.520 --> 01:16:27.240]   rest of us to get EP credits? 50 50 grand? Yeah. Is it a 50
[01:16:27.240 --> 01:16:29.440]   grand? Or is it a little
[01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:33.320]   this is this is a this is gonna be an expensive one. Oh, really?
[01:16:33.320 --> 01:16:36.480]   Well, who's your dream? Is it HBO is a dream or Netflix? Yeah.
[01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:39.600]   Who's on Netflix? Ultimately, a studio would make this right?
[01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:42.840]   You would want HBO or Netflix. I take it those are the top two in
[01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:45.120]   terms of making high quality stuff. They're really good.
[01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:47.560]   Yeah, there's no studios, too. But they'd be good. It could be
[01:16:47.560 --> 01:16:49.920]   Amazon Prime. I mean, there's a lot of these and who are you
[01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:54.960]   hoping to raise a young sack? Who would play a young question?
[01:16:54.960 --> 01:16:58.920]   That's a good question. Who would play a young David Sacks?
[01:16:58.920 --> 01:17:01.440]   What's the name of the guy that's dating Zendaya? What's
[01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:05.200]   your what's his name? Tom Holland. How about Tom? Peter
[01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:08.640]   Parker? Peter Parker? Yeah. How about Millie Bobby Brown for
[01:17:08.640 --> 01:17:11.960]   you? One guy can play a young sex that it would be Ryan
[01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:14.480]   Gosselin. Well, you guys really shooting the moon with us.
[01:17:14.480 --> 01:17:17.480]   Hmm. Tom Holland's interesting.
[01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:19.320]   Jekyll busy on the internet right now. He's gonna get
[01:17:19.320 --> 01:17:22.000]   looking. I'm looking on the internet for a young actor to
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.880]   play you. So I will let the audience come back to that.
[01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:27.600]   Let the audience decide who plays a young sex. Yeah.
[01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:31.400]   Chamathi looking forward to anything in media in 2024. Did
[01:17:31.400 --> 01:17:33.960]   you have anything for us to look out for?
[01:17:33.960 --> 01:17:37.960]   Jimmy Donaldson, Mr. Beast added 100 million subscribers on
[01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:44.440]   YouTube in 2023. More than two times the next largest channel.
[01:17:44.440 --> 01:17:48.160]   And if you watch his content, Mr. Beast channel, it's
[01:17:48.160 --> 01:17:53.800]   incredible. And that has become event based viewing now for
[01:17:53.800 --> 01:17:58.080]   hundreds of millions of people. So I am really excited to see
[01:17:58.080 --> 01:18:01.160]   what production value gets cranked out in 2024 from these
[01:18:01.160 --> 01:18:05.680]   guys. But my that's my most anticipated media is Mr. Beast
[01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:09.520]   and free bird. Yeah, anything you're looking forward to in
[01:18:09.520 --> 01:18:12.600]   the media space in 2024.
[01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:17.000]   I mean, I put AI generated news, which I think has become like an
[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:18.920]   interesting Have you guys seen these where there's like a
[01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:22.080]   broadcaster that just tells you the news and they're like naked?
[01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:24.240]   I haven't seen that. No,
[01:18:24.240 --> 01:18:26.680]   that was the thing in the early days of theatre, right? Wasn't
[01:18:26.680 --> 01:18:30.320]   there like, or something? No, that was like, I'm good from
[01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:33.520]   there. News that was like naked news where like these people
[01:18:33.520 --> 01:18:38.600]   would be like in in the process of undressing as they as they
[01:18:38.600 --> 01:18:40.680]   like read the news. It was so stupid. Really?
[01:18:40.680 --> 01:18:44.640]   It was really dumb. But it did capture people's imagination
[01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:47.880]   naked news, you could basically watch newscasters naked read the
[01:18:47.880 --> 01:18:50.320]   news. I do think you're gonna see a lot of this real time
[01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:55.560]   generative video that's going to take as its input, news feeds
[01:18:55.560 --> 01:18:58.800]   and develop some understanding and then present it back to you
[01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:02.040]   in whatever visual format you want. And so you'll have your
[01:19:02.040 --> 01:19:04.320]   own personal newscaster presenting you the stuff that's
[01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:06.040]   interesting and be like, No, no, tell me less about the
[01:19:06.040 --> 01:19:08.400]   Middle East. Tell me more about Wall Street. Tell me more about
[01:19:08.400 --> 01:19:11.520]   tech. And you can basically interact with it and curate your
[01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:14.840]   own personal news feed. Whether that's through video or through
[01:19:14.840 --> 01:19:17.240]   text or through audio, you can have it presented to you any
[01:19:17.240 --> 01:19:19.680]   way you want. So I'm really excited for the data that
[01:19:19.680 --> 01:19:21.560]   happens. So I don't have to do scroll through Twitter all the
[01:19:21.560 --> 01:19:24.880]   time to get news. And I can have, you know, a personally
[01:19:24.880 --> 01:19:28.840]   curated newscaster to your point. One of the things that
[01:19:29.840 --> 01:19:32.720]   one of the tasks that I had this year was the kind of like, take
[01:19:32.720 --> 01:19:36.160]   a model and learn how to fine tune it. And Sonny and I we took
[01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:40.520]   stable diffusion and there's a mod to it called juggernaut Excel,
[01:19:40.520 --> 01:19:44.080]   which basically produces know the most beautiful people you've
[01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:46.960]   ever seen, like under any boundary condition, it doesn't
[01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:49.720]   matter what prompt you give handsome, the people that it
[01:19:49.720 --> 01:19:52.600]   generates are the most stunningly symmetrically
[01:19:52.600 --> 01:19:56.880]   beautiful people. And all it's going to take to your point is
[01:19:56.880 --> 01:20:00.720]   just put this stuff together next year. And you'll have these
[01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:03.000]   people that capture your attention and can keep your
[01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.640]   attention. And they'll tell you the news or whatever.
[01:20:05.640 --> 01:20:08.440]   And you can just say skip, you can say tell me more, you can
[01:20:08.440 --> 01:20:11.160]   say go back, you can say, Hey, I want to hear more, like double
[01:20:11.160 --> 01:20:13.760]   click on that story, and interact with it, it's going to
[01:20:13.760 --> 01:20:16.640]   be incredible. I do think it's it's going to happen in 2024,
[01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:19.240]   where a series of products will come out that start to look like
[01:20:19.240 --> 01:20:20.000]   this, and it'll get
[01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:23.920]   in terms of objective views. If that, as they're telling the
[01:20:23.920 --> 01:20:27.000]   news, you can have another agent that's basically scoring it and
[01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:30.400]   telling you how biased it is. Yeah. By the way, I'll tell you
[01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:34.880]   a crazy story yesterday. After Jason, Jason took that and I out
[01:20:34.880 --> 01:20:38.240]   yesterday, we had an epic day. It was incredible. Good times. I
[01:20:38.240 --> 01:20:42.600]   was totally gassed skiing. And so I took an app and I fell
[01:20:42.600 --> 01:20:46.080]   asleep for like 40 minutes and I woke up and I turned on the TV
[01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:49.960]   and I watched CNN for 20 minutes. Have you guys watched
[01:20:49.960 --> 01:20:55.280]   CNN? I can't watch more than a minute is so bad. It is all
[01:20:55.280 --> 01:20:58.520]   network news. Yeah, well, no, no, it's really bad, Jason. Like
[01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:02.640]   no, it's not my eyes. It is and just how inaccurate it is. If
[01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:06.360]   you were to watch it for an hour a day, you would have this
[01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:08.640]   totally lopsided view of what's going on in the world that is
[01:21:08.640 --> 01:21:10.960]   completely not accurate. But here's my here's my point.
[01:21:10.960 --> 01:21:12.960]   There's nobody fact checking CNN, just like there's nobody
[01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:16.200]   really fact checking Fox News. But my thought is these models
[01:21:16.200 --> 01:21:18.680]   and these AI tools should be the thing that presents objective
[01:21:18.680 --> 01:21:21.160]   news, and then actually just tells the truth.
[01:21:21.160 --> 01:21:24.280]   I disagree. I think what will happen is people will bias this
[01:21:24.280 --> 01:21:27.040]   the delivery to what they want to hear. And you'll end up
[01:21:27.040 --> 01:21:29.560]   having something that's going to become more of an echo chamber
[01:21:29.560 --> 01:21:32.960]   for you. I want to hear more about how x, y or z is so great.
[01:21:32.960 --> 01:21:34.840]   I want to hear less about the stuff that I don't agree with.
[01:21:34.840 --> 01:21:37.480]   And you're going to curate your news to exactly what's happened
[01:21:37.480 --> 01:21:40.000]   with social media. So I don't know if that's necessarily how
[01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.560]   this will evolve to my things. People don't like to hear what
[01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:44.320]   they don't believe or what they don't already know.
[01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:46.440]   I mean, they don't want to hear the truth. Yeah,
[01:21:46.480 --> 01:21:49.440]   they want to hear the truth that speaks to them. Their version
[01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:49.880]   of the truth.
[01:21:49.880 --> 01:21:51.920]   It's totally titillated, you know,
[01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:55.600]   it's about time I let you guys know that we ran an experiment
[01:21:55.600 --> 01:21:59.040]   right now. Chamath and Freiburg. I did this with Saks permission.
[01:21:59.040 --> 01:22:02.760]   But Saks is participation here today was actually his AI. This
[01:22:02.760 --> 01:22:06.680]   is an AI version of Saks that we programmed AI Saks. Can you
[01:22:06.680 --> 01:22:10.640]   reveal yourself and what training data went into this
[01:22:10.640 --> 01:22:13.560]   version of AI Saks? Can you give us something about your training
[01:22:13.560 --> 01:22:16.800]   data? AI Saks? What training data was used?
[01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:19.440]   If this is a bit you want to do, you're gonna have to give me
[01:22:19.440 --> 01:22:20.400]   more of a heads up.
[01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:24.760]   That would be hilarious, though, if we actually trained like a
[01:22:24.760 --> 01:22:28.160]   Saks model, and we had him come on and we tried to fool the
[01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:28.560]   audience.
[01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:30.960]   Can we just do a quick roundtable if you guys were to
[01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:34.720]   summarize your in one word or two words, your emotional
[01:22:34.720 --> 01:22:38.440]   condition for 2024? What would it be? Like, how are you feeling
[01:22:38.440 --> 01:22:40.440]   going into 2024? Saks?
[01:22:40.520 --> 01:22:43.680]   Oh, I feel fine. But if I were to describe 24 in one word, I
[01:22:43.680 --> 01:22:48.480]   would say the years can be turbulent. I feel I feel level.
[01:22:48.480 --> 01:22:50.880]   That's not me. But I feel like the world's gonna be very
[01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:51.400]   turbulent.
[01:22:51.400 --> 01:22:58.320]   J. Cal kind of exhilarated, enthusiastic about 2024. It
[01:22:58.320 --> 01:23:02.760]   feels like a lot of the cleanup work, you know that we had to do
[01:23:02.760 --> 01:23:08.640]   in 2023 2022. Like, I feel like a lot of that we've worked
[01:23:08.640 --> 01:23:12.640]   through it. And I'm finding a lot of optimistic. So I guess
[01:23:12.640 --> 01:23:15.520]   that would be, you know, enthusiastic and optimistic
[01:23:15.520 --> 01:23:19.480]   about 2024. I'm really excited to go to work. And create, I
[01:23:19.480 --> 01:23:22.080]   want to create some new things in 2024. I feel very creative,
[01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:22.600]   creative.
[01:23:22.600 --> 01:23:28.120]   Yeah, yeah, creative. I would say cautious and pensive. I think
[01:23:28.120 --> 01:23:34.160]   that just a lot of stuff is changing underfoot. And I'm
[01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:39.720]   personally not excited to make a bunch of decisions. Because I
[01:23:39.720 --> 01:23:43.120]   worry that those decisions will have to be remade or unmade.
[01:23:43.120 --> 01:23:49.360]   Even nine or 10 months later, so I, I'm just kind of like very
[01:23:49.360 --> 01:23:56.640]   pensive. I'm like, wow, a lot of stuff can change will change.
[01:23:56.640 --> 01:23:59.600]   Even just like, you know, and then free bird knows this. But
[01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:01.600]   like, you know, there's like some deals underfoot that like,
[01:24:01.600 --> 01:24:04.760]   I think for the industry as a lot, like as a whole are just
[01:24:04.760 --> 01:24:07.760]   really meaningful things. And so to do stuff right now, free
[01:24:07.760 --> 01:24:12.080]   bird makes me very anxious. So right. I'm really cautious and
[01:24:12.080 --> 01:24:14.960]   pensive. Right? Where are you at free bird?
[01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:19.800]   I'm excited. I'm enjoying my new job as CEO at Ohalo. There's so
[01:24:19.800 --> 01:24:22.080]   much cool stuff happening. I'm personally excited about it. So
[01:24:22.080 --> 01:24:24.760]   this is the most excited I've felt in many years in terms of
[01:24:24.760 --> 01:24:28.760]   my, my work. And then I would and I'm really excited to share
[01:24:28.760 --> 01:24:31.080]   what we've done next year, which I'll play earlier this year,
[01:24:31.080 --> 01:24:33.880]   which I'll do. I'll do it on the show first, obviously. And then
[01:24:33.880 --> 01:24:37.280]   looking outside of the world, I'm just a little cautious. I'm
[01:24:37.280 --> 01:24:39.960]   all nervous. I think there's a like, there's still a lot of
[01:24:39.960 --> 01:24:43.800]   tinderboxes out there. So I mean, you guys know, like, we
[01:24:43.800 --> 01:24:47.040]   joke about it. But I do think there's these like, little mouth
[01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:49.160]   traps that can get set off, and then they set off all the other
[01:24:49.160 --> 01:24:51.560]   mouse traps. So there's a couple of those things out there that
[01:24:51.560 --> 01:24:52.280]   I'm a little nervous about.
[01:24:52.280 --> 01:24:55.400]   But in the course of history, aren't there always conflicts in
[01:24:55.400 --> 01:24:58.400]   the world? And like, do you try to like, put them on a spectrum
[01:24:58.400 --> 01:25:00.400]   of like, there's always going to be conflict, there's always
[01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:00.800]   going to be
[01:25:00.800 --> 01:25:02.840]   never been this much debt in the world. And that's what makes
[01:25:02.840 --> 01:25:05.760]   me so nervous. Like, I think, yeah, no, I think they're
[01:25:05.760 --> 01:25:10.480]   related. So actual conflict relates to the debt load. And
[01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:13.080]   that's why I'm so nervous, because we've never been, you
[01:25:13.080 --> 01:25:17.320]   can't keep your societal fabric together. If you have a lot of
[01:25:17.320 --> 01:25:20.280]   debt, and you can't grow your economy. Those are two, that's a
[01:25:20.280 --> 01:25:24.560]   simple fact. And so that leads naturally to finding points of
[01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:28.520]   conflict with other nations and other places. Because, you know,
[01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:32.880]   you look for conflict elsewhere, there's a good chance that will
[01:25:32.880 --> 01:25:36.800]   the republicans will force some momentary temporary budget cuts
[01:25:36.800 --> 01:25:40.040]   in this next year. couple weeks, shutdown. Yeah, a couple weeks.
[01:25:40.040 --> 01:25:42.120]   17. Two weeks away. Yeah.
[01:25:42.120 --> 01:25:45.560]   Yeah, that's pretty interesting. Under the terms of the debt
[01:25:45.560 --> 01:25:48.360]   ceiling increase that they agreed to last year, they're
[01:25:48.360 --> 01:25:52.720]   supposed to all agree on a new budget. And if they don't, then
[01:25:52.720 --> 01:25:55.840]   there's a 1% cut across the board on discretionary spending
[01:25:55.840 --> 01:25:59.040]   that goes into effect, right? If I were the republicans, why
[01:25:59.040 --> 01:26:02.480]   agree to a deal, you're never gonna do better than a 1% cut in
[01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:05.720]   discretionary spending. If you care about austerity, or just
[01:26:05.720 --> 01:26:10.160]   having any kind of reason in our spending, just take the 1% cut.
[01:26:10.160 --> 01:26:12.120]   Yep. Yes. Don't agree to anything.
[01:26:12.120 --> 01:26:14.680]   Agreed. That's the most likely path, right? At this point, I
[01:26:14.680 --> 01:26:18.360]   hope so. And you know, 1% cut cut is a rounding error. But the
[01:26:18.360 --> 01:26:21.360]   Washington elites are gonna shriek like crazy over that. I
[01:26:21.360 --> 01:26:25.600]   mean, they're gonna yeah, squeal over this minuscule cut, like we
[01:26:25.600 --> 01:26:28.760]   were slashing their budgets. Right. But that's all we're
[01:26:28.760 --> 01:26:31.000]   cutting. Yeah, exactly.
[01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.480]   They're cutting their finger now and they're crying. It's like
[01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:35.160]   just clipper tones.
[01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:38.040]   They're gonna have their arm when they got like a fingernail
[01:26:38.040 --> 01:26:41.200]   clip. Yeah, it's nothing. All right, I gotta run.
[01:26:41.200 --> 01:26:44.680]   All right, everybody. What an amazing 2023. We had. Here's to
[01:26:44.680 --> 01:26:47.040]   a great 2024. You got your prediction show and we'll be
[01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:50.920]   back with more news and a kind of classic all in episode next
[01:26:50.920 --> 01:26:55.120]   week. Have a great New Year. And we wish you all the best in
[01:26:55.120 --> 01:26:56.560]   2024. Love you boys.
[01:26:56.560 --> 01:26:57.600]   Catch you. Bye bye.
[01:26:57.600 --> 01:27:00.480]   Let your winners ride.
[01:27:00.480 --> 01:27:03.000]   Rain Man David
[01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:09.360]   And it said we open source it to the fans and they've just gone
[01:27:09.360 --> 01:27:10.080]   crazy with it.
[01:27:10.080 --> 01:27:10.760]   Love you.
[01:27:10.760 --> 01:27:12.600]   West Side Queen of Kinwam
[01:27:12.600 --> 01:27:20.440]   besties are gone.
[01:27:20.440 --> 01:27:23.960]   dog taking a notice in your driveway.
[01:27:24.960 --> 01:27:25.280]   Oh,
[01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:32.400]   we should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy
[01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:34.240]   because they're all just useless. It's like this like
[01:27:34.240 --> 01:27:36.480]   sexual tension that they just need to release somehow.
[01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:38.040]   What?
[01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:39.080]   You're a bee.
[01:27:39.080 --> 01:27:39.360]   Bee.
[01:27:39.360 --> 01:27:39.960]   What?
[01:27:39.960 --> 01:27:40.480]   You're a bee.
[01:27:40.480 --> 01:27:41.240]   You're a bee.
[01:27:41.240 --> 01:27:41.560]   Bee.
[01:27:41.560 --> 01:27:42.160]   What?
[01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:44.000]   That's gonna be good. We need to get merch.
[01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:44.840]   Besties are back.
[01:27:44.840 --> 01:27:46.200]   I'm doing all in.
[01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:54.400]   I'm doing all in
[01:27:54.400 --> 01:27:56.460]   you
