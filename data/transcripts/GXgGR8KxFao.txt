[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.500]   The United States has 1,770 nuclear weapons deployed,
[00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.900]   meaning those weapons could launch in as little as 60 seconds
[00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.240]   and up to a couple minutes.
[00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.380]   Some of them on the bombers might take an hour or so.
[00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.980]   Russia has 1,674 deployed nuclear weapons.
[00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.140]   Same scenario, their weapon systems are on par with ours.
[00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.220]   That's not to mention the 12,500 nuclear weapons
[00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.540]   amongst the nine nuclear armed nations.
[00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.840]   The sucking up into the nuclear stem, 300 mile an hour winds,
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.540]   you're talking about people miles out getting sucked up
[00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:45.460]   into that stem.
[00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.420]   When you see the mushroom cloud, Lex, that would be people.
[00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.580]   30, 40 mile wide mushroom cloud blocking out the sun.
[00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.340]   And that speaks nothing of the radiation poisoning
[00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:58.100]   that follows.
[00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.100]   In addition to the launch on warning concept,
[00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.660]   there's this other insane concept
[00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.100]   called sole presidential authority.
[00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.740]   And you might think, in a democracy, that's impossible.
[00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.900]   You can't just start a war.
[00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.780]   Well, you can just start a nuclear war
[00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.380]   if you are the commander in chief, the president
[00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.680]   of the United States.
[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.100]   In fact, you're the only one who can do that.
[00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.580]   We are one misunderstanding, one miscalculation away
[00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.060]   from nuclear Armageddon.
[00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.620]   No matter how nuclear war starts,
[00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.100]   it ends with everyone dead.
[00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.340]   The following is a conversation with Annie Jacobson,
[00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.700]   an investigative journalist, Pulitzer Prize finalist,
[00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.740]   and author of several amazing books on war, weapons,
[00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.780]   government secrecy, and national security,
[00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.740]   including the books titled Area 51, Operation Paperclip,
[00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.700]   The Pentagon's Brain, Phenomena, Surprise Kill Vanish,
[00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.660]   and her new book, Nuclear War.
[00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.820]   This is a Lex Friedman podcast.
[00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.700]   To support it, please check out our sponsors
[00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:08.940]   in the description.
[00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.460]   And now, dear friends, here's Annie Jacobson.
[00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:19.180]   Let's start with an immensely dark topic, nuclear war.
[00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.520]   How many people would a nuclear war between the United States
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.500]   and Russia kill?
[00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.420]   So I'm coming back at you with a very dark answer
[00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.380]   and a very big number.
[00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.460]   And that number is 5 billion people.
[00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.980]   You go second by second, minute by minute, hour by hour.
[00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:47.980]   What would happen if the nuclear war started?
[00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.340]   So there's a lot of angles on which
[00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.260]   I would love to talk to you about this.
[00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.900]   First, how would the deaths happen
[00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.500]   in the short term and the long term?
[00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.460]   So to start off, the reason I wrote the book
[00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:10.340]   is so that readers like you could see in appalling detail
[00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.620]   just how horrific nuclear war would be.
[00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.500]   And as you said, second by second, minute by minute.
[00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.900]   The book covers nuclear launch to nuclear winter.
[00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.300]   I purposely don't get into the politics that
[00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.860]   lead up to that or the national security maneuvers
[00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.180]   or the posturing or any of that.
[00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:36.340]   I just want people to know nuclear war is insane.
[00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.220]   And every source I interviewed for this book,
[00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:44.700]   from Secretary of Defense, all retired nuclear sub force
[00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.540]   commander, STRATCOM commander, FEMA director,
[00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.460]   on and on and on, nuclear weapons engineers,
[00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:55.820]   they all shared with me the common denominator
[00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:58.700]   that nuclear war is insane.
[00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.460]   First millions, then tens of millions,
[00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:03.260]   then hundreds of millions of people
[00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:08.100]   will die in the first 72 minutes of a nuclear war.
[00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.020]   And then comes nuclear winter, where the billions
[00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.300]   happen from starvation.
[00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.820]   And so the shock power of all of this
[00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:25.180]   is meant for each and every one of us to say, wait, what?
[00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.620]   This actually exists behind the veil of national security.
[00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.500]   And I don't know--
[00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.380]   most people do not think about nuclear war on a daily basis.
[00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.100]   And yet, hundreds of thousands of people
[00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.660]   in the nuclear command and control
[00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.460]   are at the ready in the event it happens.
[00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.660]   But it doesn't take too many people to start one.
[00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.380]   In the words of Richard Garwin, who
[00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.460]   was the nuclear weapons engineer who
[00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.100]   drew the plans for the Ivy Mike thermonuclear bomb,
[00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:02.460]   the first thermonuclear bomb ever exploded in 1952,
[00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.180]   Garwin shared with me his opinion
[00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.700]   that all it takes is one nihilistic madman
[00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:14.180]   with a nuclear arsenal to start a nuclear war.
[00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.820]   And that's how I begin the scenario.
[00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:19.220]   What are the different ways it could start?
[00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.660]   Like, literally, who presses a button?
[00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.020]   And what does it take to press a button?
[00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:28.700]   So the way it starts is in space,
[00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:33.820]   meaning the US Defense Department has a early warning
[00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.380]   system.
[00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.740]   And the system in space is called SIBRS.
[00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.560]   It's a constellation of satellites
[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:44.060]   that is keeping an eye on all of America's enemies
[00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:49.540]   so that the moment an ICBM launches,
[00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:51.060]   the satellite in space--
[00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.860]   and I'm talking about 1/10 of the way to the moon.
[00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:57.860]   That's how powerful these satellites are in geosync.
[00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:04.380]   They see the hot rocket exhaust on the ICBM
[00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:07.380]   in a fraction of a second after it launches,
[00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:09.940]   a fraction of a second.
[00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:14.500]   And so there begins this horrifying policy
[00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.100]   called launch on warning, right?
[00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:21.340]   And that's the US counterattack, meaning the reason
[00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:25.860]   that the United States is so ferociously watching
[00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:28.320]   for a nuclear launch somewhere around the globe
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:34.580]   is so that the nuclear command and control system in the US
[00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:37.180]   can move into action to immediately
[00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:39.220]   make a counterstrike.
[00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:41.700]   Because we have that policy, launch
[00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:44.060]   on warning, which is exactly like it says.
[00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:46.540]   It means the United States will not
[00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:50.620]   wait to absorb a nuclear attack.
[00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:53.300]   It will launch nuclear weapons in response
[00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:57.860]   before the bomb actually hits.
[00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:02.620]   So the president, as part of the launch on warning policy,
[00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:05.140]   has six minutes.
[00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:06.980]   I guess can't launch for six minutes,
[00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:12.340]   but at six minute mark from that first warning,
[00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:15.700]   the president can launch.
[00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:19.660]   And that was one of the most remarkable details
[00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:21.780]   to really nail down for this book
[00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:24.660]   when I was reporting this book and talking to Secretary
[00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:26.140]   of Defenses, for example, who are
[00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:29.100]   the people who advise the president on this matter.
[00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:31.140]   You say to yourself, wait a minute,
[00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:32.540]   how could that possibly be?
[00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:34.340]   And so let's unpack that.
[00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:37.680]   So in addition to the launch on warning concept,
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:40.220]   there's this other insane concept
[00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:43.660]   called sole presidential authority.
[00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:47.300]   And you might think, in a democracy, that's impossible.
[00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.460]   You can't just start a war.
[00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:51.360]   Well, you can just start a nuclear war
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.940]   if you're the commander in chief, the president
[00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:55.260]   of the United States.
[00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:58.420]   In fact, you're the only one who can do that.
[00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:01.300]   And we can get into later why that exists.
[00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:03.940]   I was able to get the origin story of that concept
[00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:04.860]   from Los Alamos.
[00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:08.900]   They declassified it for the book.
[00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:14.060]   But the idea behind that is that nuclear war
[00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:17.900]   will unfold so fast, only one person
[00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:19.700]   can be in charge, the president.
[00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:23.420]   He asks permission of no one, not the Secretary of Defense,
[00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:26.000]   not the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.080]   not the US Congress.
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:31.240]   So built into that is this extraordinary speed
[00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:33.160]   you talk about, the six-minute window.
[00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:35.480]   And some people say, oh, that's ridiculous.
[00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:37.400]   How do we know that six-minute window?
[00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:40.960]   Well, here's the best sort of hitting
[00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:43.120]   the nail on the head statement I can give you,
[00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:47.240]   which is in President Reagan's memoirs,
[00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:49.360]   he refers to the six-minute window.
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:53.240]   And he calls it irrational, which it is.
[00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:56.720]   He says, how can anyone make a decision
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:01.200]   to launch nuclear weapons based on a blip on a radar scope,
[00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:04.800]   his words, to unleash Armageddon?
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:08.320]   And yet, that is the reality behind nuclear war.
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:13.280]   Just imagine sitting there, one person,
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:17.880]   because the president is a human being, sitting there,
[00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:20.000]   just got the warning that Russia launched.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.240]   You have six minutes.
[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:27.200]   You know, I meditate on my mortality every day,
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:31.880]   and here you would be sitting and meditating,
[00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:34.040]   contemplating not just your own mortality,
[00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:37.560]   but the mortality of all the people you know, loved ones.
[00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:40.040]   Just imagining, what would be going through my head
[00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:45.040]   is all the people I know and love, like personally,
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:48.920]   and knowing that there'll be no more, most likely.
[00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:53.120]   And if they somehow survive, they will be suffering
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:54.440]   and will eventually die.
[00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:59.280]   I guess the question that kept coming up is,
[00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:00.820]   how do we stop this?
[00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:03.660]   Is it inevitable that it's going to be escalated
[00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:06.920]   to a full-on nuclear war that destroys everything?
[00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:09.920]   And it seems like it will be.
[00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:11.640]   It's inevitable.
[00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:12.880]   In the position of the president,
[00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:16.320]   it's almost inevitable that they have to respond.
[00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:18.360]   - I mean, one of the things I found shocking
[00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:22.160]   was how little, apparently, most presidents know
[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:24.280]   about the responsibility
[00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:26.160]   that literally lays at their feet, right?
[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:29.160]   So you may think through this six-minute window.
[00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:32.080]   I may think through this six-minute window.
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:35.480]   But what I learned, like for example,
[00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:38.080]   former Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta
[00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:40.400]   was really helpful in explaining this to me,
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:42.880]   because before he was SECDEF,
[00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:47.880]   he served as the Director of the CIA.
[00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:52.320]   And before that, he was the White House Chief of Staff.
[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:54.960]   And so he has seen these different roles
[00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:58.380]   that have been so close to the president.
[00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:00.640]   But he explained to me that when he was
[00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:03.700]   the White House Chief of Staff for President Clinton,
[00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:08.680]   he noticed how President Clinton didn't want
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:11.300]   to ever really deal with the nuclear issue,
[00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:13.800]   because he had so many other issues to deal with.
[00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:20.180]   And that only when Panetta became Secretary of Defense,
[00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:25.200]   he told me, did he really realize the weight of all of this?
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:28.800]   Because he knew he would be the person
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.640]   that the president would turn to
[00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:35.880]   were he to be notified of a nuclear attack.
[00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:37.760]   And by the way, it's the launch on warning.
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:42.200]   It's the ballistic missile
[00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:44.880]   seen from outer space by the satellite.
[00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:49.180]   And then there also must be a second confirmation
[00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:51.560]   from a ground radar system.
[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:55.260]   But in that process, which is just a couple minutes,
[00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:58.140]   everyone is getting ready to notify the president.
[00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:01.680]   And one of the first people that gets notified by NORAD
[00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:05.620]   or by STRATCOM or by NRO,
[00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:08.460]   these different parties that all see
[00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:10.620]   the early warning data,
[00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:12.220]   one of the first people that's notified
[00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:13.580]   is the Secretary of Defense,
[00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:15.760]   as well as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:20.260]   because those two together are going to brief the president
[00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:25.260]   about, "Sir, you have six minutes to decide."
[00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:30.420]   And that's where you realize the immediacy of all of this
[00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:35.420]   is so counter to imagining the scenario
[00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:39.140]   and again, all the presidents come into office,
[00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:42.860]   I have learned understanding the idea of deterrence,
[00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:45.780]   this idea that we have these massive arsenals
[00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:48.740]   of nuclear weapons pointed at one another,
[00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:53.300]   ready to launch so that we never have nuclear war.
[00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:56.900]   But what we're talking about now is what if we did?
[00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:57.740]   What if we did?
[00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:01.740]   And what you've raised is like this really spooky,
[00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:05.300]   eerie subtext of the world right now,
[00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:10.300]   because many of the nuclear armed nations
[00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:14.340]   are in direct conflict with other nations.
[00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:16.980]   And for the first time in decades,
[00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:21.620]   nuclear threats are actually coming out of the mouths
[00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:24.700]   of leaders, this is shocking.
[00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:29.700]   - So deterrence, the polite implied assumption
[00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:33.020]   is that nobody will launch,
[00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:36.220]   and if they did, we would launch back
[00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:38.180]   and everybody would be dead.
[00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:41.220]   But that assumption falls apart completely,
[00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:43.620]   the whole philosophy of it falls apart
[00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:45.860]   once the first launch happens.
[00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:46.700]   - Absolutely.
[00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:48.140]   - Then you have six minutes to decide,
[00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:51.100]   "Wait a minute, are we going to hit back
[00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:53.160]   "and kill everybody on earth?
[00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:55.220]   "Or do we turn the other cheek
[00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:57.620]   "in the most horrific way possible?"
[00:13:57.620 --> 00:13:59.260]   - Well, when nuclear war starts,
[00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.820]   there's no like battle for New York or battle for Moscow,
[00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:05.740]   it's just literally, it was called
[00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:07.620]   in the Cold War, push button warfare,
[00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:10.620]   but in essence, that is what it is.
[00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:13.700]   Let's get some numbers on the table if you don't mind,
[00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:15.340]   because when you're saying like,
[00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:18.860]   "Wait a minute, we're just hoping that it holds,
[00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:22.280]   "let's just talk about Russia and the US,
[00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:24.400]   "the arsenals that are literally pointed
[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:26.180]   "at one another right now."
[00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:32.060]   So the United States has 1,770 nuclear weapons
[00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:37.260]   deployed, meaning those weapons could launch
[00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:43.900]   in as little as 60 seconds and up to a couple minutes.
[00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:47.020]   Some of them on the bombers might take an hour or so.
[00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:52.020]   Russia has 1,674 deployed nuclear weapons,
[00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:55.780]   same scenario, their weapon systems are on par with ours.
[00:14:55.780 --> 00:15:00.860]   That's not to mention the 12,500 nuclear weapons
[00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:04.300]   amongst the nine nuclear armed nations.
[00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:06.700]   But when you think about those kind of arsenals
[00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:09.580]   of just between the United States and Russia,
[00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:12.460]   you realize everything can be launched
[00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:14.740]   in seconds and minutes.
[00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:18.380]   Then you realize the madness of Matt,
[00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:22.700]   that this idea that no one would launch
[00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:25.820]   because it would assure everyone's destruction.
[00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:28.500]   Yes, but what if someone did?
[00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:32.260]   And in my interviews with scores of top tier
[00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:36.140]   national security advisors, people who advise the president,
[00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:38.260]   people who are responsible for these decisions
[00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:41.580]   if they had to be made, every single one of them
[00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:44.500]   said it could happen.
[00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:47.020]   They didn't say this would never happen.
[00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:52.780]   And so the idea is worth thinking about
[00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:57.780]   because I believe that it pulls back the veil
[00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:03.740]   on a fundamental security that if someone were to use
[00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:06.140]   a tactical nuclear weapon, oh, well,
[00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:08.220]   it's just an escalation.
[00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:09.460]   It's far more than that.
[00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:13.420]   - So to you, the use of a tactical nuclear weapon,
[00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:15.580]   maybe you can draw the line between a tactical
[00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:20.580]   and a strategic nuclear weapon that could be a catalyst.
[00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:23.660]   Like that's a very difficult thing to walk back from.
[00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:25.220]   - Oh my God, almost certainly.
[00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:28.500]   And again, every person in the national security environment
[00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:30.620]   tells, we'll agree with that, right?
[00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:32.220]   Certainly on the American side.
[00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:39.060]   Strategic weapons, those are like big weapons systems.
[00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:41.140]   America has a nuclear triad.
[00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:46.140]   We have our ICBMs, which are the silo-based missiles
[00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:50.340]   that have a nuclear warhead in the nose cone.
[00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:52.660]   And they can get from one continent to the other
[00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:54.860]   in roughly 30 minutes.
[00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:58.700]   Then we have our bombers, B-52s and B-2s
[00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:00.220]   that are nuclear capable.
[00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:04.180]   Those take travel time to get to another continent.
[00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:05.620]   Those can also be recalled.
[00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:09.820]   The ICBMs cannot be recalled or redirected once launched.
[00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:12.220]   - That one is a particularly terrifying one.
[00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:16.660]   So land-launched missiles, rockets with a warhead
[00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:18.940]   can't be recalled.
[00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:21.620]   - Cannot be recalled or redirected.
[00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:25.540]   And speaking of how little the president generally know,
[00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:27.220]   as we were talking a moment ago,
[00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:30.940]   President Reagan in 1983 gave a press conference
[00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:34.620]   where he misstated that submarine-launched
[00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:36.500]   ballistic missiles could be recalled.
[00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:38.300]   They cannot be recalled.
[00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:41.620]   So that gives you, here's the guy in charge of the arsenal
[00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:43.340]   if it has to get let loose.
[00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:47.340]   And he doesn't even know that they cannot be recalled.
[00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:50.660]   So this is the kind of misinformation and disinformation
[00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:55.660]   and UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres
[00:17:55.660 --> 00:18:00.300]   recently said when he was talking about the conflicts
[00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:02.140]   rising around the world, he said,
[00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:05.340]   "We are one misunderstanding,
[00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:10.340]   "one miscalculation away from nuclear Armageddon."
[00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:13.700]   - So just to sort of linger on the previous point
[00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:15.500]   of tactical nukes.
[00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:17.580]   So you're describing strategic nukes,
[00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:21.860]   land-launched bombers, submarine-launched,
[00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:23.420]   what are tactical nukes?
[00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:24.940]   - So that's the triad, right?
[00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:29.220]   And we have the triad and Russia has the triad.
[00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:32.820]   Tactical nuclear weapons are smaller warheads
[00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:36.460]   that were designed to be used in battle.
[00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:41.100]   And that is what Russia is sort of threatening
[00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:42.300]   to use right now.
[00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:46.940]   That is this idea that you would make a decision
[00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:51.220]   on the battlefield in an operational environment
[00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:53.100]   to use a tactical nuclear weapon.
[00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:55.380]   You should sort of upping the ante.
[00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:59.140]   But the problem is that all treaties are based
[00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:01.900]   on this idea of no nuclear use, right?
[00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:03.740]   You cannot cross that line.
[00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:07.860]   And so the what would happen if the line is crossed
[00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:12.300]   is so devastating to even consider.
[00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:15.700]   I think that the conversation is well worth having
[00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:19.980]   among everyone that is in a power of position.
[00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:25.780]   As the UN Secretary General said, this is madness, right?
[00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:26.620]   This is madness.
[00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:28.340]   We must come back from the brink.
[00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:29.700]   We are at the brink.
[00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:34.780]   - Can we talk about some other numbers?
[00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:36.980]   So you mentioned the number of warheads.
[00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:40.780]   So land-launched, how long does it take to travel
[00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:46.180]   across the ocean from the United States to Russia,
[00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:47.380]   from Russia to the United States,
[00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:52.220]   from China to the United States, approximately how long?
[00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:55.980]   - When I was writing an earlier book on DARPA,
[00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:58.580]   the Pentagon Science Agency,
[00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:04.900]   I went to a library down in San Diego
[00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:08.740]   called the Giesel Library to look at Herb York's papers.
[00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:11.220]   Herb York was the first chief scientist
[00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:14.700]   for the Pentagon for DARPA, then called ARPA.
[00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:16.620]   And I had been trying to get the number
[00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:20.500]   from the various agencies to answer,
[00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:23.180]   like what is the exact number and how do we know it?
[00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:24.380]   And like, does it change?
[00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:27.660]   And as technology advances, does that number reduce?
[00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:28.940]   All these kinds of questions,
[00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:32.260]   and no one will answer that question on an official level.
[00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:34.300]   And so much to my surprise,
[00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:39.300]   I found the answer in Herb York's dusty archive of papers.
[00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:42.900]   And this is information that was jealously guarded.
[00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:46.740]   I mean, it's not necessarily classified,
[00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:48.500]   but it certainly wasn't out there.
[00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:53.220]   And I felt like, wow, Herb York left these behind
[00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:57.140]   for someone like me to find, right?
[00:20:57.140 --> 00:20:59.620]   And what the process,
[00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:02.700]   he wanted to know the answer to your question,
[00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:04.620]   and as the guy in charge of it all.
[00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:07.460]   So he hired this group of scientists
[00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:09.980]   who then and still are in many ways
[00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:13.700]   like the supermen scientists of the Pentagon,
[00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:15.380]   and they're called the Jason scientists.
[00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:18.180]   Many conspiracies about them abound.
[00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:19.860]   I interviewed their founder
[00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:21.780]   and have interviewed many of them.
[00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:26.180]   But they whittled the number down to seconds, okay?
[00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:29.260]   Specifically for Herb York, and it goes like this,
[00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:32.900]   'cause this is where my jaw dropped and I went, wow, okay?
[00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:37.300]   So 26 minutes and 40 seconds
[00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:42.300]   from a launch pad in the Soviet Union to the East Coast.
[00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:44.940]   And it happens in three phases, very simple,
[00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:46.180]   and interesting to remember,
[00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:49.620]   'cause then suddenly all of this makes more sense.
[00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:54.620]   Boost phase, mid-course phase, and then terminal phase, okay?
[00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:58.340]   Boost phase, five minutes.
[00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:00.180]   That's when the rocket launches.
[00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:03.780]   So you just imagine a rocket going off the launch pad
[00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:05.220]   and the fire beneath it.
[00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:07.860]   Again, that's why the satellites can see it, okay?
[00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:09.100]   Now it's becoming visual.
[00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:11.740]   Now it makes sense to me, right?
[00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:16.060]   Five minutes, and that's where the rocket can be tracked.
[00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:18.980]   And then imagine learning, wait a minute,
[00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:19.940]   after five minutes,
[00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:22.380]   the rocket can no longer be seen from space.
[00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:25.780]   The satellite can only see the hot rocket exhaust.
[00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:29.500]   Then the missile enters its mid-course phase, 20 minutes.
[00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:31.340]   And that's the ballistic part of it,
[00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:33.820]   where it's kind of flying up
[00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:38.140]   at between 500 and 700 miles above the earth,
[00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:41.020]   and moving very fast, and with the earth,
[00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:44.420]   until it gets very close to its target.
[00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:47.900]   And the last 100 seconds are terminal phase.
[00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:52.220]   It's where the warhead re-enters the atmosphere
[00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:53.580]   and detonates.
[00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:58.060]   26 minutes and 40 seconds.
[00:22:58.060 --> 00:23:02.540]   Now, in my scenario, I open with North Korea
[00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:07.540]   launching a one megaton nuclear warhead at Washington, DC.
[00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:11.020]   That's the nihilistic madman maneuver.
[00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:13.020]   That's the bolt out of the blue attack
[00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:17.340]   that everyone in Washington will tell you they're afraid of.
[00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:21.900]   And North Korea has a little bit different geography.
[00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:26.540]   And so I had MIT professor emeritus, Ted Postel,
[00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:31.540]   do the math, 33 minutes from a launch pad in Pyongyang
[00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:34.820]   to the East Coast of the United States.
[00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:37.620]   You get the idea, it's about 30 minutes.
[00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:40.940]   But hopefully now, that allows readers
[00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:43.980]   to suddenly see all this as a real,
[00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:47.500]   you almost see it as poetry,
[00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:49.140]   as terrible as that may sound.
[00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:52.340]   You can visualize it, and suddenly it makes sense.
[00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:55.420]   And I think the sense-making part of it
[00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:57.420]   is really what I'm after in this book
[00:23:57.420 --> 00:23:59.580]   because I want people to understand,
[00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:02.660]   on the one hand, it's incredibly simple.
[00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:05.820]   It's just the people that have made it so complicated.
[00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:08.860]   - But it's one of those things that can change
[00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:11.780]   all of world history in a matter of minutes.
[00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:13.780]   We just don't, as a human civilization,
[00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:15.140]   have experience with that.
[00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:20.620]   But it doesn't mean it'll never happen.
[00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:23.540]   It can happen just like that.
[00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:26.740]   I mean, I think what you're after,
[00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:28.260]   and I couldn't agree more with,
[00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:33.260]   is why is this fundamentally annihilating system,
[00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:39.620]   a system of mass genocide,
[00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:43.540]   as John Rubell in the book refers to it,
[00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:45.900]   why does it still exist?
[00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:51.500]   We've had 75 years since there've been two superpowers
[00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:52.620]   with the nuclear bomb.
[00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:56.060]   So that threat has been there for 75 years,
[00:24:56.060 --> 00:24:59.620]   and we have managed to stay alive.
[00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:03.620]   One of the reasons why so many of the sources
[00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:05.140]   in the book agreed to talk to me,
[00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:08.500]   people who had not previously gone on the record
[00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:09.420]   about all of this,
[00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:14.020]   was because they are now approaching the end of their lives.
[00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:16.780]   They spent their lives dedicated
[00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:20.620]   to preventing nuclear World War III.
[00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:23.300]   And they'll be the first people to tell you
[00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:27.260]   we're closer to this as a reality than ever before.
[00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:30.260]   And so the only bright side of any of this
[00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:33.740]   is that the answer lies most definitely in communication.
[00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:37.820]   - So there's a million other questions here.
[00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:41.580]   I think the details are fascinating
[00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:42.980]   and important to understand.
[00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:47.900]   So one, you also say nuclear submarines.
[00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:51.820]   You mentioned about 30 minutes, 26, 33 minutes,
[00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:54.340]   but with nuclear submarines,
[00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:56.780]   that number can be much, much lower.
[00:25:56.780 --> 00:26:00.300]   So how long does it take for a warhead to a missile
[00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:03.060]   to reach the East Coast of the United States
[00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:04.220]   from a submarine?
[00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:06.260]   - Just when you thought it was really bad,
[00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:08.460]   and then you kind of realize about the submarines.
[00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:10.460]   I mean, the submarines are what are called
[00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:12.100]   second strike capacity, right?
[00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:16.380]   And, you know, submarines were described to me this way.
[00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:18.620]   They are as dangerous to civilization.
[00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:22.620]   And let me say a nuclear armed, nuclear powered submarine
[00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:27.620]   is as dangerous to civilization as an asteroid, okay?
[00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:29.300]   They are unstoppable.
[00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:31.540]   They are unlocatable.
[00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:35.980]   The former chief of the nuclear submarine forces,
[00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:38.740]   Admiral Michael Connor told me,
[00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:43.740]   it's easier to find a grapefruit sized object in space
[00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:47.420]   than a submarine under the sea, okay?
[00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:50.540]   So these things are like hell machines.
[00:26:50.540 --> 00:26:55.100]   And they're moving around throughout the oceans,
[00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:59.620]   ours, Russia's, China's, maybe North Korea's, constantly.
[00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:02.300]   And we now know they're sneaking up
[00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:04.820]   to the East and West Coast of the United States
[00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:06.380]   within a couple hundred miles.
[00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:07.220]   How do we know that?
[00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:08.180]   Why do we know that?
[00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:11.140]   Well, I found a document inside of a budget
[00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:14.540]   that the defense department was going to Congress
[00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:16.180]   for more money recently,
[00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:20.380]   and showed maps of precisely where these submarines,
[00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:22.980]   how close they were getting to the Eastern seaboard.
[00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:23.820]   - So wait, wait, wait.
[00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:27.420]   So nuclear subs are getting within 200 miles?
[00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:28.620]   - Couple hundred miles, yes.
[00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:29.820]   They weren't precise on the number,
[00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:31.020]   but when you look at the map. - Couple hundred.
[00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:32.300]   - Yep.
[00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:35.420]   And that's when you're talking about under 10 minutes
[00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:37.380]   from launch to strike.
[00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:38.580]   - Undetectable.
[00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:39.700]   - And they're undetectable.
[00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:41.980]   The map making is done after the fact
[00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:45.060]   because of a lot of underwater surveillance systems
[00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:46.540]   that we have.
[00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:51.540]   But in real time, you cannot find a nuclear submarine.
[00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:54.700]   And just the way a submarine launches,
[00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:57.180]   goes 150 feet below the surface
[00:27:57.180 --> 00:27:59.740]   to launch its ballistic missile.
[00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:02.300]   I mean, it comes out of the missile tube
[00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:07.300]   and with enough thrust that the thrusters,
[00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:10.260]   they ignite outside the water,
[00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:12.100]   and then they move into boost.
[00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:16.060]   And so the technology involved is just stunning and shocking
[00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:18.620]   and again, trillions of dollars spent
[00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:21.300]   so that we never have a nuclear war.
[00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:22.860]   But my God, what if we did?
[00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:26.380]   - As you write,
[00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:30.020]   they're called the handmaidens of the apocalypse.
[00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:33.140]   What a terrifying label.
[00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:38.140]   I mean, one of the things you also write about,
[00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:40.660]   so for the land launched ones,
[00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:43.620]   they're presumably underground.
[00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:46.980]   So the silos, how long does it take to go
[00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:49.020]   from like pressing the button
[00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:52.060]   to them emerging from underground for launch?
[00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:55.480]   And is that part detectable or it's only the heat?
[00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:57.180]   - So what's interesting about the silos,
[00:28:57.180 --> 00:28:59.540]   America has 400 silos, right?
[00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:00.500]   We've had more.
[00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:03.980]   But we have 400 and they're underground
[00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:06.980]   and they're called minute men, right?
[00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:08.820]   After the revolutionary war heroes.
[00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:12.100]   But the sort of joke in Washington
[00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:14.220]   is they're not called minute men for nothing
[00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:16.820]   because they can launch in one minute, right?
[00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:20.980]   So the president orders the launch of the ICBMs,
[00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:25.180]   ICBM stands for Intercontinental Ballistic Missile.
[00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:28.420]   He orders the launch and they launch 60 seconds later.
[00:29:28.420 --> 00:29:30.460]   And then they take 30 some odd minutes
[00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:32.580]   to get to where they're going.
[00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:37.500]   The submarines take about 14 or 15 minutes
[00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:40.780]   from the presidential, from the launch command
[00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:43.020]   to actually launching.
[00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:44.780]   And that has to do, I surmise,
[00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:48.380]   with the location of the submarine, its depth.
[00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:51.620]   Some of these things are so highly classified
[00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:55.620]   and others, other details are shockingly available
[00:29:55.620 --> 00:29:58.540]   if you look deep enough or if you ask enough questions
[00:29:58.540 --> 00:30:01.820]   and you can go from one document to the next to the next
[00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:03.540]   and really find these answers.
[00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:05.260]   - Not to ask top secret questions,
[00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:08.860]   but to what degree do you think the Russians
[00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:12.700]   know the locations of the silos in the US and vice versa?
[00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:15.300]   - Lex, you and I can find the location
[00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:16.820]   of every silo right now. - Oh no.
[00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:17.660]   - They're all there.
[00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:20.060]   And before they were there on Google,
[00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:22.820]   they were there in maps because we're a democracy
[00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:25.000]   and we make these things known, okay?
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:29.700]   Now what's tricky is that Russia and North Korea
[00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:33.700]   rely upon what are called road mobile launchers, right?
[00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:36.780]   So Russia has a lot of underground silos.
[00:30:36.780 --> 00:30:38.900]   All of the scenario takes you through
[00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:41.460]   these different facilities that really do exist
[00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:43.940]   and they're all sourced with how many weapons they have
[00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:46.300]   and their launch procedures and whatnot.
[00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:49.960]   But in addition to having underground silos,
[00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:52.780]   they have road mobile launchers.
[00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:56.500]   And that means you just have one of these giant ICBMs
[00:30:56.500 --> 00:31:01.500]   on a 22 axle truck that can move
[00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:04.340]   stealthily around the country
[00:31:04.340 --> 00:31:08.540]   so that it can't be targeted by the US Defense Department.
[00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:10.260]   We don't have those in America
[00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:13.540]   because presumably the average American
[00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:17.420]   isn't gonna go for like the ICBM road mobile launcher
[00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:21.240]   driving down the street in your town or city,
[00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:25.300]   which is why the Defense Department will justify
[00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:28.380]   we need the second strike capacity capability,
[00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:30.340]   the submarines, right?
[00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:34.100]   Because, you know, I mean, the wonky stuff
[00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:36.020]   that is worth looking into as a,
[00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:38.860]   if you really dig the book and are like, wait a minute,
[00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:41.460]   it's all footnoted where you can learn more
[00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:45.040]   about how these systems have changed over time
[00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:48.140]   and why more than anything,
[00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:52.700]   it's very difficult to get out of this catch-22 conundrum
[00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:56.500]   that, you know, we need nuclear weapons to keep us safe.
[00:31:56.500 --> 00:31:59.460]   That is the real enigma
[00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:03.100]   because the other guys have them, right?
[00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:05.860]   And the other guys have sort of more sinister ways
[00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:08.820]   of using them, or at least that's what the nomenclature
[00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:10.900]   out of the Pentagon will always be
[00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:12.100]   when anyone tries to say,
[00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:16.500]   we just need to really think about full disarmament.
[00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:19.180]   - You've written about intelligence agencies.
[00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:21.820]   How good are the intelligence agencies on this?
[00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:26.380]   How much does CIA know about the Russian launch sites
[00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:31.380]   and capabilities and command and control procedures
[00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:33.820]   and all of this and vice versa?
[00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:36.140]   - I mean, all of this, because it's decades old,
[00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:38.620]   is really well-known.
[00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:41.900]   If you go to the Federation of American Scientists,
[00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:45.060]   they have a team led by a guy called Hans Christensen
[00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:47.820]   who runs what's called the Nuclear Notebook.
[00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:50.680]   And he and his team every year are keeping track
[00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:52.340]   of this number of warheads
[00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:54.060]   on these number of weapon systems.
[00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:55.680]   And because of the treaties,
[00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:57.980]   the different signatories to the treaty
[00:32:57.980 --> 00:32:59.900]   all report these numbers.
[00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:02.780]   And of course, the different intelligence community,
[00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:06.380]   people are keeping track of what's being, you know,
[00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:09.980]   revealed honestly and reported with transparency
[00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:11.420]   and what is being hidden.
[00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:15.460]   The real issue is the new systems
[00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:17.560]   that Russia is working on right now.
[00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:20.160]   And that will lead us, you know,
[00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:22.940]   we are kind of moving into an era
[00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:27.940]   whereby the threat of actually having new weapon systems
[00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:31.540]   that are nuclear capable is very real
[00:33:31.540 --> 00:33:35.260]   because of the escalating tensions around the world.
[00:33:35.260 --> 00:33:36.860]   And that's where the CIA, I would guess,
[00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:38.660]   is doing most of its work right now.
[00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:41.640]   - So most of your research is kind of looking at
[00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:44.540]   the older versions of the system.
[00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:47.940]   And presumably there's potentially secret development
[00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:50.140]   of new ones, hopefully.
[00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:51.520]   - Which violates treaties.
[00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:54.640]   So yes, that is where the intelligence agencies,
[00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:58.080]   but you know, at a point it's overkill,
[00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:00.880]   literally and figuratively, right?
[00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:03.440]   People are up in arms about these hypersonic weapons.
[00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:06.180]   Well, we have a hypersonic weapons program,
[00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:08.760]   you know, Falcon, Google Blackswift, right?
[00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:12.280]   This is Lockheed's doing, you know,
[00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:17.280]   DARPA exists to create the vast weapon systems of the future.
[00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:19.720]   That is its job.
[00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:23.640]   It has been doing that since its creation in 1957.
[00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:28.480]   I would never believe that we aren't ahead of everyone.
[00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:31.280]   Call me, you know, over-informed or naive,
[00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:33.840]   one or the other, that would be my position
[00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:36.700]   because DARPA works from the chicken or the egg scenario,
[00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:40.640]   you know, that like once you learn about something,
[00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:43.080]   once you learn Russia's created this, you know,
[00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:46.480]   typhoon submarine, which may or may not, you know,
[00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:50.600]   be viable, it's too late if you don't already have one.
[00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:52.960]   - We'll probably talk about DARPA a little bit.
[00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:56.960]   One of the things that makes me sad about Lockheed,
[00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:59.360]   many things make me sad about Lockheed,
[00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:02.180]   but one of the things is because it's very top secret,
[00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:05.180]   you can't show off all the incredible engineering
[00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:06.300]   going on there.
[00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:09.760]   The other thing that's more philosophical, DARPA also,
[00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:14.080]   is that war seems to stimulate most of our,
[00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:18.920]   not most, but a large percent of our exciting innovation
[00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:23.520]   in engineering, and so, but that's also the pragmatic fact
[00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:28.520]   of life on Earth, is that the risk of annihilation
[00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:32.880]   is a great motivator for innovation,
[00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:34.320]   for engineering, and so on.
[00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:39.320]   But yes, I would not discount the United States
[00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:42.960]   in its ability to build the weapons of the future,
[00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:45.880]   nuclear included, again, terrifying.
[00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:50.480]   Can you tell me about the nuclear football, as it's called?
[00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:53.200]   - I think Americans are familiar with the football,
[00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:54.720]   at least anyone who sort of, you know,
[00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:56.640]   follows national security concepts,
[00:35:56.640 --> 00:35:59.500]   because it's a satchel, it's a leather satchel
[00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:02.880]   that is always with a military aid,
[00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:06.640]   in Secret Service nomenclature, that's the MIL-AID,
[00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:11.440]   and he's trailing around the president 24/7,
[00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:15.440]   365 days a year, and also the vice president, by the way,
[00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:18.660]   with the ability to launch nuclear war
[00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:22.080]   in that six-minute window all the time, okay?
[00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:27.120]   That is also called the football,
[00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:29.360]   and it's always with the president.
[00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:30.720]   To report this part of the book,
[00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:32.760]   I interviewed a lot of people in the Secret Service
[00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:35.180]   that are with the president and talk about this,
[00:36:35.180 --> 00:36:37.800]   and the director of the Secret Service,
[00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:41.040]   a guy called Lou Merletti, told me a story
[00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:45.200]   that I just really found fascinating.
[00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:47.680]   He was also in charge of the president's detail,
[00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:49.760]   President Clinton this was,
[00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:51.760]   before he was director of the Secret Service,
[00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:55.120]   and he told me the story about how, he said,
[00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:58.840]   "The football is with the president at all times, period."
[00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:00.080]   Okay?
[00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:02.900]   They were traveling to Syria,
[00:37:02.900 --> 00:37:06.000]   and Clinton was meeting with President Assad,
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:09.440]   and they got into an elevator,
[00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:11.760]   Clinton and the Secret Service team,
[00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:14.600]   and one of Assad's guys was like, "No,"
[00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:17.820]   like about the mill aid, and Lou said,
[00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:20.960]   "It was like a standoff, because there was no way
[00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:24.180]   "they were not going to have the president
[00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:27.000]   "with his football in an elevator."
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:31.300]   And it kind of sums up, for me anyways,
[00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:34.520]   you realize what goes into
[00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:37.160]   every single one of these decisions.
[00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:40.800]   You realize the massive system of systems
[00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:44.880]   behind every item you might just see
[00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:46.900]   in passing and glancing on the news,
[00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:49.140]   as you see the mill aid carrying that satchel.
[00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:51.160]   Well, what's in that satchel?
[00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:55.960]   I really dug into that to report this book.
[00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:57.040]   What is in that satchel?
[00:37:57.040 --> 00:37:59.760]   Okay, so, well, okay, first of all,
[00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:01.080]   that is, you know, people always say,
[00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:02.840]   "It's incredibly classified."
[00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:04.520]   I mean, people talk about UFOs.
[00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:07.240]   "It's incredibly," I mean, come on, guys,
[00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:08.920]   that is nothing burger, right?
[00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:10.880]   You wanna know what's really classified?
[00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:12.280]   What's in that football, right?
[00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:13.620]   What's in that satchel?
[00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:17.360]   But the PEDE, Presidential Emergency Action Directives,
[00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:19.800]   right, those have never been leaked.
[00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:21.600]   No one knows what they are.
[00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:24.480]   What we do know from one of the mill aides
[00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:26.920]   who spoke on the record, a guy called Buzz Patterson,
[00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:30.200]   he describes the president's orders, right?
[00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:32.200]   So if a nuclear war has begun,
[00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:36.160]   if the president has been told there are nuclear missiles,
[00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:38.020]   one or more coming at the United States,
[00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:41.320]   you have to launch in a counter-attack, right?
[00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:42.660]   The red clock is ticking,
[00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:46.040]   you have to get the blue impact clock ticking.
[00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:49.800]   He needs to look at this list to decide
[00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:54.800]   what targets to strike and what weapon systems to use.
[00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:58.760]   And that is what is on, according to Buzz Patterson,
[00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:02.520]   a piece of like sort of laminated plastic,
[00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:05.400]   he described it like a Denny's menu.
[00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:10.400]   And from that menu, the president chooses targets
[00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:12.620]   and chooses weapon systems.
[00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:16.160]   - And it's probably super old school,
[00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:20.000]   like all top secret systems are,
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.120]   because they have to be tested over and over and over
[00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:23.280]   and over and over.
[00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:24.820]   - Yes, and it's non-digital.
[00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:25.920]   - Non-digital.
[00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:29.240]   - It might literally be a Denny's menu from hell.
[00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:31.240]   - Right, and there's a, meanwhile,
[00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:33.880]   I learned this only in reporting the book.
[00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:37.360]   There is a identical black book
[00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:42.360]   inside the STRATCOM bunker in Nebraska, okay?
[00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:45.520]   So let me, three command bunkers are involved
[00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:47.320]   when nuclear war begins, right?
[00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:49.520]   There's the bunker beneath the Pentagon,
[00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:53.880]   which is called the National Military Command Center, okay?
[00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:57.240]   Then there is the bunker beneath Cheyenne Mountain,
[00:39:57.240 --> 00:40:00.160]   which everyone has, many people have heard of
[00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:02.280]   because it's been made famous in movies, right?
[00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:04.480]   That is a very real bunker.
[00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:06.160]   And then there is a third bunker,
[00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:08.560]   which people are not so familiar with,
[00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:12.880]   which is the bunker beneath Strategic Command in Nebraska.
[00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:15.600]   And so it's described to me this way,
[00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:20.240]   the Pentagon bunker is the beating heart.
[00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:24.040]   The Cheyenne Mountain bunker is the brains.
[00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:27.420]   And the STRATCOM bunker is the muscle.
[00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:32.520]   The STRATCOM commander will receive word
[00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:34.960]   from the president, launch orders,
[00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:39.960]   and then directs the 150,000 people beneath him,
[00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:45.480]   what to do, okay, from the bunker beneath STRATCOM.
[00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:48.840]   That's before he runs, you know, he gets the orders,
[00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:50.200]   then he has to run out of the building
[00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:53.160]   and jump onto a, what's called the doomsday plane.
[00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:54.320]   We'll get into that in a minute.
[00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:56.760]   Let me just finish the, I mean, but again,
[00:40:56.760 --> 00:41:00.200]   these are the details, this is like,
[00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:05.080]   these are the systematic sequential details
[00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:07.680]   that happen in seconds and minutes.
[00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:11.840]   And reporting them, I never cease to be amazed
[00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:15.640]   by what a system it is, you know?
[00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:19.640]   A follows B, you know, it's just numerical, right?
[00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:22.160]   - Yeah, but as we discuss this procedure,
[00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:25.200]   each individual person that follows that procedure
[00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:27.500]   might lose the big picture of the whole thing.
[00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:34.520]   I mean, especially when you realize what is happening,
[00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:38.760]   that almost out of fear, you just follow the steps.
[00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:40.680]   - Yep, or okay, so imagine this,
[00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:43.080]   imagine being the president, you got that six minute win.
[00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:48.080]   You have to, you're looking at your list of strike options.
[00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:49.840]   You're being briefed by your chairman
[00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:52.600]   of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and your SACDF.
[00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:56.920]   And this other really spooky detail,
[00:41:56.920 --> 00:41:59.300]   in the STRATCOM bunker,
[00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:02.640]   in addition to the nuclear strike advisor
[00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:05.240]   who can answer very specific questions,
[00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:06.440]   if the president's like, wait a minute,
[00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:08.680]   why are we striking that and not that?
[00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:11.320]   There's also a weather officer.
[00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:14.320]   And this is the kind of human detail
[00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:15.840]   that kept me up at night.
[00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:19.420]   Because that weather officer is in charge
[00:42:19.420 --> 00:42:23.800]   of explaining to the president really fast
[00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:26.120]   how many people are going to die
[00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:31.120]   and how many people are going to die in minutes,
[00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:37.340]   weeks, months, and years from radiation fallout.
[00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:41.040]   - Because a lot of that has to do with the weather system.
[00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:43.720]   - Yes, yes.
[00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:47.200]   And so these kinds of, the humanness,
[00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:53.320]   balanced out with the mechanization of it all,
[00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:58.080]   is, it's just really grotesque.
[00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:01.240]   - So the Doomsday Plane from STRATCOM,
[00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:03.480]   what's that, where is it going?
[00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:04.320]   What's on it?
[00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:06.240]   - Right, it's, okay, ready?
[00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:07.600]   It's gonna fly in circles.
[00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:09.760]   That's where it's going.
[00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:14.360]   It's flying in circles around the United States of America
[00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:19.360]   so that nuclear weapons can be launched from the air
[00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:24.880]   after the ground systems are taken out
[00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:26.520]   by the incoming ICBMs
[00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:30.520]   or the incoming submarine-launched ballistic missiles.
[00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:33.540]   This has been in play since the '50s.
[00:43:33.540 --> 00:43:37.920]   This is, these are the contingency plans
[00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:40.080]   for when nuclear war happens.
[00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:44.060]   So again, going back to this absurd paradox,
[00:43:44.060 --> 00:43:46.360]   nuclear war will never happen.
[00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:48.200]   You know, mutual assured destruction,
[00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:49.880]   that is why deterrence will hold.
[00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:54.880]   Well, I found a talk that the deputy director of STRATCOM
[00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:58.200]   gave to a very close-knit group
[00:43:58.200 --> 00:44:00.600]   where he said, yes, deterrence will hold,
[00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:03.560]   but if it fails, everything unravels.
[00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:05.960]   And think about that word, unravels, right?
[00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:08.200]   And the unraveling is, you know,
[00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:09.740]   the doomsday plane launches.
[00:44:09.740 --> 00:44:12.760]   The STRATCOM commander jumps in, he's in that plane,
[00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:15.000]   he's flying around the United States,
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.440]   and he's making decisions
[00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:20.020]   because the Pentagon's been taken out.
[00:44:20.020 --> 00:44:25.280]   At 9/11, by the way, Bush was in the doomsday plane.
[00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:29.080]   - And Bush had to make decisions quickly,
[00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:31.160]   but not so quickly, not as quickly
[00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:33.000]   as he would have needed, have done
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:35.200]   if there's a nuclear launch.
[00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:37.600]   - I mean-- - Six minutes.
[00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:39.400]   - It basically happens in three acts.
[00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:44.400]   There's the first 24 minutes, the next 24 minutes,
[00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:47.260]   and the last 24 minutes.
[00:44:47.260 --> 00:44:51.200]   And that is the reality of nuclear weapons.
[00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:58.920]   - What is the interceptor capabilities of the United States?
[00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:01.420]   How many nuclear missiles can be stopped?
[00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:06.680]   - I was at a dinner party with a very informed person,
[00:45:06.680 --> 00:45:09.680]   right, like somebody who really, you know,
[00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:10.680]   should have known this.
[00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:14.280]   And this is when I was considering writing
[00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:17.080]   and reporting this book, and he said to me,
[00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:19.960]   "Oh, Annie, that would never happen
[00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:24.960]   "because of our powerful interceptor system, okay?"
[00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:26.080]   Well, he's wrong.
[00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:28.960]   Let me tell you about our powerful interceptor system.
[00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:32.920]   First of all, we have 44 interceptor missiles,
[00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:35.080]   total, period, full stop.
[00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:38.340]   Let me repeat, 44, okay?
[00:45:38.340 --> 00:45:43.340]   Earlier, we were talking about Russia's 1,670
[00:45:43.340 --> 00:45:45.360]   deployed nuclear weapons.
[00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:49.980]   How are those 44 interceptor missiles gonna work, right?
[00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:55.880]   And they also have a success rate of around 50%,
[00:45:55.880 --> 00:45:58.080]   so they work 50% of the time.
[00:45:58.080 --> 00:46:00.760]   There are 40 of them in Alaska,
[00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:02.800]   and there are four of them
[00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:06.120]   at Vandenberg Air Force Base in Santa Barbara, okay?
[00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:09.360]   And they are responsible at about nine minutes
[00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:11.460]   into the scenario, right,
[00:46:11.460 --> 00:46:14.600]   after the ICBM has finished
[00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:16.760]   that five-minute boost phase we talked about.
[00:46:16.760 --> 00:46:19.120]   Now it's in mid-course phase,
[00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:24.080]   and the ground radar systems have identified,
[00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:28.520]   yes, this is an incoming ICBM.
[00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:32.240]   And now the interceptor missiles have to launch, right?
[00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:34.720]   It's essentially shooting a missile with a missile.
[00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:38.600]   Inside the interceptor, which is just a big giant rocket,
[00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:42.200]   in its nose cone, it has what's called
[00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:47.200]   the aptly named exoatmospheric kill vehicle, okay?
[00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:49.480]   There's no explosives in that thing.
[00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:54.480]   It's literally just going to take out the warhead,
[00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:57.560]   ideally, with force.
[00:46:57.560 --> 00:47:01.200]   So one of them is going like Mach 20.
[00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:05.240]   I mean, the speeds at which these two moving objects
[00:47:05.240 --> 00:47:08.700]   hurtling through space are going is astonishing.
[00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:12.720]   And the fact that interception is even possible
[00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:13.780]   is really remarkable,
[00:47:13.780 --> 00:47:15.980]   but it's only possible 50% of the time.
[00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:19.560]   - Is it possible that we only know about 44,
[00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:20.760]   but there could be a lot more?
[00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:22.720]   - No, impossible.
[00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:24.320]   That I would be willing to bet.
[00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:26.840]   - And how well tested are these interceptors?
[00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:28.480]   - Well, that's where we get the success rate
[00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:30.800]   that's around 50%, because of the test, right?
[00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:33.320]   And actually, the interceptor program is,
[00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:34.160]   are you ready for this?
[00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:37.760]   It's on strategic pause, right, right now.
[00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:39.880]   Meaning the interceptor missiles are there,
[00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:43.160]   but developing them and making them more effective
[00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:44.440]   is on strategic pause,
[00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:47.720]   because they can't be made more effective, right?
[00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:49.180]   People have these fantasies
[00:47:49.180 --> 00:47:52.040]   that we have a system like the Iron Dome,
[00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:54.400]   and they see this in current events,
[00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:56.800]   and they're like, "Oh, our interceptors would do that."
[00:47:56.800 --> 00:47:58.580]   It's just simply not true.
[00:47:58.580 --> 00:48:01.280]   - Why can't an Iron Dome-like system
[00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:03.880]   be constructed for nuclear warheads?
[00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:06.400]   - We have systems I write about called the THAAD system,
[00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:07.520]   which is ground-based,
[00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:10.720]   and then the Aegis system, which is on vessels.
[00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:15.600]   And these are great at shooting down some rockets,
[00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:19.280]   but they can only shoot them sort of one at a time.
[00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:22.260]   You cannot shoot the mother load as it's coming in.
[00:48:22.260 --> 00:48:23.960]   Those are the smaller systems, right?
[00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:25.360]   The tactical nuclear weapons.
[00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:28.840]   And by the way, our THAAD systems are all deployed overseas,
[00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:31.160]   and our Aegis systems are all out at sea.
[00:48:31.160 --> 00:48:34.040]   And again, reporting that, I was like, "Wait, what?"
[00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:35.720]   You know, you have to really hunker down.
[00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:37.360]   Are we sure about this?
[00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:39.120]   People really don't wanna believe this.
[00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:40.480]   It's an actual fact.
[00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:44.920]   After 9/11, Congress considered putting Aegis missiles
[00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:46.080]   and maybe even THAAD systems
[00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:47.940]   along the West Coast of the United States
[00:48:47.940 --> 00:48:49.840]   to specifically deal with the threats
[00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:51.980]   against nuclear-armed North Korea,
[00:48:51.980 --> 00:48:53.440]   but it hasn't done so yet.
[00:48:53.440 --> 00:48:54.880]   And again, you have to ask yourself,
[00:48:54.880 --> 00:48:57.280]   "Wait a minute, this is insanity."
[00:48:57.280 --> 00:49:01.320]   One nuclear weapon gets by any of these systems,
[00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:03.960]   and it's full-out nuclear warfare.
[00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:07.400]   So that's not the solution.
[00:49:07.400 --> 00:49:09.600]   More nuclear weapons is not the solution.
[00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:14.140]   - I'm looking for a hopeful thing here about North Korea.
[00:49:14.140 --> 00:49:17.560]   How many deployed nuclear warheads does North Korea have?
[00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:21.920]   So does the current system, as we described it,
[00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:23.720]   the interceptors and so on,
[00:49:23.720 --> 00:49:27.820]   have a hope against the North Korean attack,
[00:49:27.820 --> 00:49:31.000]   the one that you mentioned people are worried about?
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:35.440]   - So North Korea has 50,
[00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:39.000]   let's say 50 nuclear weapons right now.
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:42.640]   Some NGOs put it at more than 100.
[00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:44.040]   It's impossible to know
[00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:47.020]   because North Korea's nuclear weapons program
[00:49:47.020 --> 00:49:48.800]   has no transparency.
[00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:51.720]   They're the only nuclear-armed nation
[00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:55.560]   that doesn't announce when they do a ballistic missile test.
[00:49:55.560 --> 00:49:56.680]   Everyone else does.
[00:49:56.680 --> 00:49:59.600]   No one wants to start a nuclear war by accident, right?
[00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:02.040]   So if Russia's gonna launch an ICBM, they tell us.
[00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:03.160]   If we're gonna launch one,
[00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:05.080]   and I'm talking test runs here,
[00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:06.360]   you know, with a dummy warhead,
[00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:09.600]   we tell them, not North Korea.
[00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:11.200]   That's a fact, okay?
[00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:15.080]   So we're constantly up against the fear of North Korea.
[00:50:15.080 --> 00:50:16.120]   In this scenario,
[00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:20.480]   I have the incoming North Korean one megaton,
[00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:22.120]   you know, weapon coming in,
[00:50:22.120 --> 00:50:26.720]   and the interceptor system tries to shoot it down.
[00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:29.160]   So there's not enough time,
[00:50:29.160 --> 00:50:32.120]   and this, by the way, I ran through by all, you know,
[00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:35.200]   generals from the Pentagon who run these scenarios
[00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:36.720]   for NORAD, right?
[00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:38.640]   And confirmed all of this as fact.
[00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:41.960]   This is not, this is the situation, right?
[00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:46.960]   So in this scenario, I have the nuclear ICBM coming in.
[00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:49.880]   The interceptor missiles try to shoot down the warhead.
[00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:53.920]   The capability is not like what's called shoot, you know,
[00:50:53.920 --> 00:50:54.760]   and look.
[00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:57.360]   They can't, there's not enough time to go like,
[00:50:57.360 --> 00:50:58.760]   and we're gonna try to get it.
[00:50:58.760 --> 00:50:59.600]   We missed it.
[00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:00.880]   Okay, let's go for another one.
[00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:03.680]   So you have to go poof, poof, poof, poof, right?
[00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:06.120]   So in my scenario, we fire off four,
[00:51:06.120 --> 00:51:08.800]   which is about what I was told would, one to four,
[00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:10.120]   because you're worried about the next one
[00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:11.160]   that's gonna come in.
[00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:13.860]   You're gonna use up 10% of your missile force,
[00:51:13.860 --> 00:51:17.080]   of your interceptor force on one, and all four miss,
[00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:18.540]   and that's totally plausible.
[00:51:18.540 --> 00:51:20.500]   - Right.
[00:51:20.500 --> 00:51:25.760]   How likely are mistakes, accidents, false alarms,
[00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:28.600]   taken as real, all this kind of stuff in this picture?
[00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:31.660]   So like you've, we've kind of assumed
[00:51:31.660 --> 00:51:33.660]   the detection works correctly.
[00:51:33.660 --> 00:51:36.680]   How likely is it possible?
[00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:39.760]   Like anywhere, you described this long chain of events
[00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:41.200]   that can happen.
[00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:43.080]   How possible is it just to make a mistake,
[00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:45.760]   a stupid human mistake along the way?
[00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:49.720]   - There've been at least six known like absolute,
[00:51:49.720 --> 00:51:52.440]   like, oh my God, close calls,
[00:51:52.440 --> 00:51:56.360]   how, thank God this happened type scenarios.
[00:51:56.360 --> 00:51:58.560]   One was described to me
[00:51:58.560 --> 00:52:01.640]   with an actual personal participant.
[00:52:01.640 --> 00:52:05.640]   Secretary, former Secretary of Defense, Bill Perry, right?
[00:52:05.640 --> 00:52:09.160]   And he described what happened to him in 1979.
[00:52:09.160 --> 00:52:10.720]   He was not yet Secretary of Defense.
[00:52:10.720 --> 00:52:13.880]   He was the Deputy Director of Research and Engineering,
[00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:15.820]   which is like a big job at the Pentagon.
[00:52:15.820 --> 00:52:19.760]   And it was, the night watch fell on him essentially, right?
[00:52:19.760 --> 00:52:22.160]   And he gets this call in the middle of the night.
[00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:27.160]   He's told that Russia has launched not just ICBMs,
[00:52:27.160 --> 00:52:30.220]   but submarine-launched ballistic missiles
[00:52:30.220 --> 00:52:32.000]   are coming at the United States.
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:35.280]   And he is about to notify the president
[00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:37.440]   that the six minute window has to begin.
[00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:41.360]   When he learns it was a mistake.
[00:52:41.360 --> 00:52:44.480]   The mistake was that there was a training tape
[00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:47.800]   with a nuclear war scenario, right?
[00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:50.560]   We haven't even begun to talk about the nuclear war scenarios
[00:52:50.560 --> 00:52:51.680]   that the Pentagon runs.
[00:52:51.680 --> 00:52:56.680]   An actual VHS training tape had been incorrectly inserted
[00:52:57.600 --> 00:53:00.420]   into a system at the Pentagon.
[00:53:00.420 --> 00:53:05.340]   And so this nuclear launch showed up
[00:53:05.340 --> 00:53:07.340]   at that bunker beneath the Pentagon
[00:53:07.340 --> 00:53:09.940]   and at the bunker beneath STRATCOM,
[00:53:09.940 --> 00:53:13.300]   because they're connected, as being real.
[00:53:13.300 --> 00:53:14.880]   And then it was like, oh, whoops,
[00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:17.620]   it's actually a simulation test tape.
[00:53:17.620 --> 00:53:21.720]   And Perry described to me what that was like,
[00:53:21.720 --> 00:53:25.940]   the pause in his spirit and his mind and his heart
[00:53:25.940 --> 00:53:28.940]   when he realized, I'm about to have to tell the president
[00:53:28.940 --> 00:53:30.500]   that he needs to launch nuclear weapons.
[00:53:30.500 --> 00:53:32.260]   And he learned just in the neck of time
[00:53:32.260 --> 00:53:33.780]   that it was an error.
[00:53:33.780 --> 00:53:36.020]   And that's one of five examples.
[00:53:36.020 --> 00:53:39.540]   - Can you speak to maybe, is there any more color
[00:53:39.540 --> 00:53:41.620]   to the feelings he was feeling?
[00:53:41.620 --> 00:53:43.380]   Like, what's your sense?
[00:53:43.380 --> 00:53:45.860]   And given all the experts you've talked to,
[00:53:45.860 --> 00:53:53.500]   what can be said about the seconds that one feels
[00:53:53.540 --> 00:53:56.900]   once finding out that a launch has happened,
[00:53:56.900 --> 00:54:00.060]   even if that information is false information?
[00:54:00.060 --> 00:54:02.780]   - For me personally, that's the only firsthand story
[00:54:02.780 --> 00:54:05.940]   that I ever heard, because it's so rare and it's so unique.
[00:54:05.940 --> 00:54:10.340]   And most people in the national security system,
[00:54:10.340 --> 00:54:13.340]   at least in the past, have been loath
[00:54:13.340 --> 00:54:15.060]   to talk about any of this, right?
[00:54:15.060 --> 00:54:18.300]   It's like the sacred oath, it's taboo.
[00:54:18.300 --> 00:54:22.680]   It's taboo to go against the system of systems
[00:54:22.680 --> 00:54:26.380]   that is making sure nuclear war never happens.
[00:54:26.380 --> 00:54:30.340]   Bill Perry was one of the first people who did this.
[00:54:30.340 --> 00:54:32.660]   And a lot of it, I believe,
[00:54:32.660 --> 00:54:36.140]   at least in my lengthy conversations with him,
[00:54:36.140 --> 00:54:38.700]   we had a lot of Zoom calls over COVID
[00:54:38.700 --> 00:54:40.020]   when I began reporting this.
[00:54:40.020 --> 00:54:43.580]   And he had a lot to do with me feeling
[00:54:43.580 --> 00:54:48.020]   like I could write this book from a human point of view
[00:54:48.020 --> 00:54:51.000]   and not just from the mechanized systems.
[00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:53.700]   Because, and I only lightly touch upon this
[00:54:53.700 --> 00:54:56.100]   because it's such a fast sweeping scenario,
[00:54:56.100 --> 00:54:59.380]   but Perry, for example, spent his whole life
[00:54:59.380 --> 00:55:02.220]   dedicated to building weapons of war,
[00:55:02.220 --> 00:55:06.980]   only later in life to realize this is madness.
[00:55:06.980 --> 00:55:11.900]   And he shared with me that it was that idea
[00:55:11.900 --> 00:55:16.900]   about one's grandchildren inheriting these nuclear arsenals
[00:55:18.260 --> 00:55:23.060]   and the lack of wisdom
[00:55:23.060 --> 00:55:27.540]   that comes with their origin stories, right?
[00:55:27.540 --> 00:55:30.060]   When you're involved in it in the ground up,
[00:55:30.060 --> 00:55:32.740]   apparently it has,
[00:55:32.740 --> 00:55:35.980]   perhaps you're a different kind of steward
[00:55:35.980 --> 00:55:40.460]   of these systems than if you just inherit them
[00:55:40.460 --> 00:55:44.100]   and they are pages in a manual.
[00:55:44.100 --> 00:55:46.820]   - People forget.
[00:55:46.820 --> 00:55:49.660]   You mentioned the kind of nuclear war scenarios
[00:55:49.660 --> 00:55:51.220]   that the Pentagon runs.
[00:55:51.220 --> 00:55:53.540]   I'd love to, what do you know about those?
[00:55:53.540 --> 00:55:56.460]   - I mean, again, they are very classified, right?
[00:55:56.460 --> 00:56:00.260]   I mean, it was interesting coming across levels
[00:56:00.260 --> 00:56:02.100]   of classification I didn't even know existed,
[00:56:02.100 --> 00:56:04.140]   like ECI, for example,
[00:56:04.140 --> 00:56:08.100]   is exceptionally controlled information, right?
[00:56:08.100 --> 00:56:13.300]   But the Pentagon nuclear war gaming scenarios,
[00:56:13.300 --> 00:56:15.300]   they're almost all still classified.
[00:56:15.300 --> 00:56:17.980]   One of them was declassified recently,
[00:56:17.980 --> 00:56:19.820]   if you can call it that.
[00:56:19.820 --> 00:56:21.620]   I show an image of it in the book
[00:56:21.620 --> 00:56:26.620]   and it's just basically like almost entirely redacted
[00:56:26.620 --> 00:56:28.740]   and then like there'll be a date,
[00:56:28.740 --> 00:56:31.420]   or it'll say like phase one.
[00:56:31.420 --> 00:56:33.900]   And that one was called Proud Prophet.
[00:56:33.900 --> 00:56:35.140]   But what was incredible
[00:56:35.140 --> 00:56:37.540]   about the declassification process of that
[00:56:37.540 --> 00:56:39.500]   is it allowed a couple of people
[00:56:39.500 --> 00:56:41.660]   who were there to talk about it, okay?
[00:56:41.660 --> 00:56:43.940]   And that's why we have that information.
[00:56:43.940 --> 00:56:45.780]   And I write about Proud Prophet in the book
[00:56:45.780 --> 00:56:48.700]   because it was super significant in many ways.
[00:56:48.700 --> 00:56:51.300]   One, it was happening right,
[00:56:51.300 --> 00:56:56.300]   in 1983, it was an insane moment in nuclear arsenals.
[00:56:56.300 --> 00:57:00.420]   There were 60,000 nuclear weapons.
[00:57:00.420 --> 00:57:02.100]   Right now there's 12,500.
[00:57:02.100 --> 00:57:04.300]   So we've come a long way, baby, right?
[00:57:04.300 --> 00:57:06.900]   In terms of disarmament, but there were 60,000.
[00:57:06.900 --> 00:57:08.900]   And by the way, that was not the ultimate high.
[00:57:08.900 --> 00:57:12.260]   The ultimate high was 70,000, okay?
[00:57:12.260 --> 00:57:13.860]   This is insane.
[00:57:13.860 --> 00:57:16.020]   And Ronald Reagan was president
[00:57:16.020 --> 00:57:19.300]   and he orders this war game called Proud Prophet.
[00:57:19.300 --> 00:57:24.060]   And everyone that mattered was involved.
[00:57:24.060 --> 00:57:25.700]   They were running the war game scenarios.
[00:57:25.700 --> 00:57:28.620]   And what we learned from his declassification
[00:57:28.620 --> 00:57:31.620]   is that no matter how nuclear war starts,
[00:57:31.620 --> 00:57:33.020]   there was a bunch of different scenarios
[00:57:33.020 --> 00:57:35.580]   with NATO involved, without NATO,
[00:57:35.580 --> 00:57:37.620]   with all different scenarios,
[00:57:37.620 --> 00:57:42.620]   no matter how nuclear war starts, it ends in Armageddon.
[00:57:43.540 --> 00:57:45.780]   It ends with everyone dead.
[00:57:45.780 --> 00:57:50.940]   I mean, this is shocking when you think about
[00:57:50.940 --> 00:57:55.540]   that coupled with the idea that all that has been done
[00:57:55.540 --> 00:57:58.180]   in the 40 some odd years since is,
[00:57:58.180 --> 00:58:01.980]   okay, let's just really lean in even harder
[00:58:01.980 --> 00:58:06.620]   to this theoretical phenomena of deterrence.
[00:58:06.620 --> 00:58:07.620]   'Cause that's all it is.
[00:58:07.620 --> 00:58:09.940]   It's just a statement, Lex.
[00:58:09.940 --> 00:58:13.140]   Like deterrence will hold.
[00:58:13.140 --> 00:58:15.540]   Okay, well, what if it doesn't?
[00:58:15.540 --> 00:58:20.300]   Well, we know from Proud Prophet what happens if it doesn't.
[00:58:20.300 --> 00:58:23.180]   - That almost always, there's no mechanisms
[00:58:23.180 --> 00:58:26.340]   in the human mind and the human soul that stops it
[00:58:26.340 --> 00:58:28.940]   in the governments they've created.
[00:58:28.940 --> 00:58:31.420]   It just keep, the procedure escalates always.
[00:58:31.420 --> 00:58:34.740]   - I mean, here's a crazy nomenclature jargon thing
[00:58:34.740 --> 00:58:35.980]   for you, ready?
[00:58:35.980 --> 00:58:37.900]   Escalate to deescalate.
[00:58:37.900 --> 00:58:39.500]   That's what comes out of it.
[00:58:39.500 --> 00:58:41.100]   Think about what I just said.
[00:58:41.100 --> 00:58:42.860]   Escalate to deescalate.
[00:58:42.860 --> 00:58:45.540]   Okay, so someone strikes you with a nuclear weapon,
[00:58:45.540 --> 00:58:47.540]   you're gonna escalate it, right?
[00:58:47.540 --> 00:58:50.260]   General Hyten recently said, he was STRATCOM commander,
[00:58:50.260 --> 00:58:53.460]   you know, he was sort of saber rattling
[00:58:53.460 --> 00:58:55.300]   with North Korea during COVID and he said,
[00:58:55.300 --> 00:58:58.300]   "They need to know if they launch one nuclear weapon,
[00:58:58.300 --> 00:58:59.220]   "we launch one.
[00:58:59.220 --> 00:59:01.900]   "If they launch two, we launch two."
[00:59:01.900 --> 00:59:03.260]   But it's actually more than that.
[00:59:03.260 --> 00:59:06.460]   They launch one, we launch 80, okay?
[00:59:06.460 --> 00:59:09.260]   That's called escalate to deescalate.
[00:59:09.260 --> 00:59:12.180]   Like pound the you know what out of them
[00:59:12.180 --> 00:59:13.580]   to get them to stop.
[00:59:13.580 --> 00:59:19.620]   - But I mean, there is, to make a case for that,
[00:59:19.620 --> 00:59:23.540]   there is a reason to the madness
[00:59:23.540 --> 00:59:28.540]   because you want to threaten this gigantic response.
[00:59:28.540 --> 00:59:32.260]   But when it comes to it, the seconds before,
[00:59:32.260 --> 00:59:36.660]   there is still a probability that you'll pull back.
[00:59:36.660 --> 00:59:40.380]   - Which brings us to the most terrifying facts
[00:59:40.380 --> 00:59:41.980]   that I learned in all of that.
[00:59:41.980 --> 00:59:46.460]   And that has to do with errors, right?
[00:59:46.460 --> 00:59:49.180]   Not just, not errors of like we spoke about a minute ago
[00:59:49.180 --> 00:59:51.140]   with, you know, a simulation test tape.
[00:59:51.140 --> 00:59:56.140]   I'm talking about if one madman, one nihilistic madman
[00:59:56.140 --> 00:59:59.580]   were to launch a nuclear weapon, as I write in the scenario.
[00:59:59.580 --> 01:00:03.380]   And we needed to escalate to deescalate.
[01:00:03.380 --> 01:00:05.020]   We needed to send nuclear weapons
[01:00:05.020 --> 01:00:08.340]   at let's say North Korea, as I do in my scenario.
[01:00:08.340 --> 01:00:13.220]   Well, what is completely unknown to 98% of the planet
[01:00:13.220 --> 01:00:18.220]   is that not only do the Russians
[01:00:18.220 --> 01:00:21.100]   have a very flawed satellite system
[01:00:21.100 --> 01:00:24.060]   so that they cannot interpret what is happening properly,
[01:00:24.060 --> 01:00:28.820]   but there is a absolutely existential flaw in the system,
[01:00:28.820 --> 01:00:33.180]   which Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta confirmed with me,
[01:00:33.180 --> 01:00:38.180]   which is that our ICBMs do not have enough range.
[01:00:38.180 --> 01:00:43.700]   If we launch a counter-attack against say North Korea,
[01:00:43.700 --> 01:00:47.720]   our ICBMs must fly over Russia.
[01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:51.760]   They must fly over Russia.
[01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:56.340]   So imagine saying, oh no, no, these 82, you know,
[01:00:56.340 --> 01:01:00.020]   warheads that are gonna actually strike
[01:01:00.020 --> 01:01:04.260]   the Northern Korean Peninsula are not coming for you, Russia,
[01:01:04.260 --> 01:01:05.500]   our adversary right now
[01:01:05.500 --> 01:01:08.640]   that we're sort of saber-rattling with, just trust us.
[01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:14.100]   And that is where nuclear war unfolds into Armageddon.
[01:01:14.100 --> 01:01:18.420]   And that hole in national security is shocking.
[01:01:18.420 --> 01:01:21.240]   And as Panetta told me, no one wants to discuss it.
[01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:27.420]   - And if one nuclear weapon does reach its target,
[01:01:27.420 --> 01:01:32.420]   I presume communication breaks down completely.
[01:01:32.420 --> 01:01:36.100]   Or like there's a high risk of breakdown of communication.
[01:01:36.100 --> 01:01:37.640]   - Well, let's back up.
[01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:40.260]   We are both presumptuous to assume
[01:01:40.260 --> 01:01:42.700]   that communication could even happen prior to,
[01:01:42.700 --> 01:01:45.380]   and let me give you a very specific example.
[01:01:45.380 --> 01:01:47.760]   During the Ukraine war, okay?
[01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:52.440]   If perhaps you remember, I think it was in November of 2022,
[01:01:53.580 --> 01:01:58.580]   news reports erroneously stated that a Russian rocket,
[01:01:58.580 --> 01:02:02.700]   a Russian missile had hit Poland, a NATO country, right?
[01:02:02.700 --> 01:02:05.380]   It turned out to be a mistake, but for several hours,
[01:02:05.380 --> 01:02:07.340]   this was actually the information
[01:02:07.340 --> 01:02:10.120]   that was all over the news, breaking news, okay?
[01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:15.960]   36 hours later, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
[01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:19.700]   General Mark Milley, gave a press conference
[01:02:19.700 --> 01:02:21.780]   and talked about this and admitted
[01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:25.660]   that he could not reach his Russian counterpart
[01:02:25.660 --> 01:02:27.940]   during those 36 hours.
[01:02:27.940 --> 01:02:30.420]   He could not reach him.
[01:02:30.420 --> 01:02:34.780]   How are you going to not have an absolute
[01:02:34.780 --> 01:02:40.800]   Armageddon-like Fuhrer with nuclear weapons in the air
[01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:47.020]   if people can't get on the phone during a ground war?
[01:02:48.580 --> 01:02:53.580]   I'd like to believe that there's people in major nations
[01:02:53.580 --> 01:02:58.940]   that don't give a damn about the bullshit of politics
[01:02:58.940 --> 01:03:01.580]   and can always just pick up the phone,
[01:03:01.580 --> 01:03:05.060]   sort of very close to the top, but not at the very top,
[01:03:05.060 --> 01:03:07.940]   and just cut through the bullshit of it
[01:03:07.940 --> 01:03:09.900]   in situations like this.
[01:03:09.900 --> 01:03:11.020]   I hope that's true.
[01:03:11.020 --> 01:03:13.260]   I doubt it is, and let me tell you why.
[01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:16.420]   Most, and neither you nor I are political
[01:03:16.420 --> 01:03:17.420]   from what I gather, right?
[01:03:17.420 --> 01:03:19.500]   So I just write about POTUS,
[01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:21.580]   President of the United States.
[01:03:21.580 --> 01:03:25.100]   You have no idea what my politics are
[01:03:25.100 --> 01:03:26.180]   because they shouldn't matter.
[01:03:26.180 --> 01:03:28.620]   No one should be for nuclear war,
[01:03:28.620 --> 01:03:32.100]   or no one should be for national insecurity.
[01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:34.260]   Yes, you want to have a strong nation,
[01:03:34.260 --> 01:03:36.460]   but once you get into politics,
[01:03:36.460 --> 01:03:38.260]   then you're talking about sycophants.
[01:03:38.260 --> 01:03:43.260]   And the more a political leader becomes divisive,
[01:03:43.580 --> 01:03:48.340]   becomes polemic, the more his platform is predicated
[01:03:48.340 --> 01:03:49.820]   on hating the other side,
[01:03:49.820 --> 01:03:51.580]   either within his own country
[01:03:51.580 --> 01:03:55.660]   or with alleged enemy nations,
[01:03:55.660 --> 01:03:57.620]   the more you surround yourself,
[01:03:57.620 --> 01:04:00.340]   as we see in the current day, with sycophants,
[01:04:00.340 --> 01:04:02.060]   with people who will tell you
[01:04:02.060 --> 01:04:04.940]   not only what they think you want to hear,
[01:04:04.940 --> 01:04:08.540]   but will help them to hold onto power.
[01:04:08.540 --> 01:04:10.820]   So you don't have wise decision-makers.
[01:04:10.820 --> 01:04:13.660]   Long gone are the days where we had presidents
[01:04:13.660 --> 01:04:18.660]   who had advisors on both sides of the aisle.
[01:04:18.660 --> 01:04:21.340]   That's really important
[01:04:21.340 --> 01:04:25.180]   because you want to have differing opinions.
[01:04:25.180 --> 01:04:29.220]   But as things become more viperous,
[01:04:29.220 --> 01:04:31.860]   both here in the United States
[01:04:31.860 --> 01:04:34.580]   and in nuclear-armed nations,
[01:04:34.580 --> 01:04:36.700]   all bets are off at whether your advisors
[01:04:36.700 --> 01:04:38.340]   are going to give you good advice.
[01:04:38.340 --> 01:04:39.980]   - Who are the people around the President
[01:04:39.980 --> 01:04:41.260]   of the United States
[01:04:41.260 --> 01:04:44.380]   that give advice in this six-minute window?
[01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:46.100]   How many of them,
[01:04:46.100 --> 01:04:48.500]   just maybe you could speak to the detail of that,
[01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:52.100]   but also to the spirit of the way they see the world,
[01:04:52.100 --> 01:04:53.660]   how many of them are warmongers?
[01:04:53.660 --> 01:04:56.660]   How many of them are kind of big picture,
[01:04:56.660 --> 01:04:59.380]   peace, humanity type of thinkers?
[01:04:59.380 --> 01:05:01.580]   - Well, again, we're talking about that six-minute window.
[01:05:01.580 --> 01:05:03.740]   So it's not exactly like you can,
[01:05:03.740 --> 01:05:05.420]   let me put a pot of coffee on
[01:05:05.420 --> 01:05:06.540]   and really tell me what you think,
[01:05:06.540 --> 01:05:07.900]   and we can strategize here, right?
[01:05:07.900 --> 01:05:10.420]   You have your SECDEF and your chairman,
[01:05:10.420 --> 01:05:12.220]   maybe the vice chairman.
[01:05:12.220 --> 01:05:15.140]   And okay, we haven't even begun to talk about the fact
[01:05:15.140 --> 01:05:16.100]   that at the same time,
[01:05:16.100 --> 01:05:20.420]   these advisors also have a parallel concern,
[01:05:20.420 --> 01:05:23.260]   and that's called continuity of government, okay?
[01:05:23.260 --> 01:05:24.980]   So while they're trying to advise
[01:05:24.980 --> 01:05:27.660]   on the nuclear counter-strike
[01:05:27.660 --> 01:05:30.540]   in response to the incoming nuclear missile,
[01:05:30.540 --> 01:05:32.420]   they have to be thinking,
[01:05:32.420 --> 01:05:35.020]   how are we going to keep the government functioning
[01:05:35.020 --> 01:05:38.260]   when the missiles start hitting,
[01:05:38.260 --> 01:05:39.860]   when the bombs start going off?
[01:05:39.860 --> 01:05:44.860]   And that is about getting yourself out of the Pentagon,
[01:05:44.860 --> 01:05:45.740]   let's say,
[01:05:45.740 --> 01:05:48.540]   getting yourself to one of these nuclear bunkers
[01:05:48.540 --> 01:05:50.420]   that I write about at length in the book.
[01:05:50.420 --> 01:05:53.460]   So how much can you ask of a human, right?
[01:05:53.460 --> 01:05:54.660]   'Cause it comes down to a human.
[01:05:54.660 --> 01:05:56.780]   The secretary of defense is a human.
[01:05:56.780 --> 01:06:01.900]   And imagine that job while trying to advise the president.
[01:06:01.900 --> 01:06:04.420]   And then there's also a really interesting term,
[01:06:04.420 --> 01:06:07.500]   which I learned about called jamming the president,
[01:06:07.500 --> 01:06:09.780]   which is often understood in Washington
[01:06:09.780 --> 01:06:12.380]   that the military advisors would,
[01:06:12.380 --> 01:06:13.740]   we don't know if this is legit,
[01:06:13.740 --> 01:06:15.460]   we've never seen it put to the test,
[01:06:15.460 --> 01:06:18.940]   but jamming the president means the military advisors
[01:06:18.940 --> 01:06:22.700]   are gonna push for a really aggressive
[01:06:22.700 --> 01:06:24.620]   counter-attack immediately.
[01:06:24.620 --> 01:06:27.980]   And again, you're the president
[01:06:27.980 --> 01:06:30.140]   who's not really been paying attention to this
[01:06:30.140 --> 01:06:33.060]   because he has many other things to deal with.
[01:06:33.060 --> 01:06:36.700]   Speed is not conducive to wisdom.
[01:06:36.700 --> 01:06:38.220]   - Can you speak to the jamming the president?
[01:06:38.220 --> 01:06:43.220]   So your sense is the advisors would, by default,
[01:06:43.220 --> 01:06:46.300]   be pushing for aggressive counter-attack.
[01:06:46.300 --> 01:06:49.980]   - That is a term in sort of the national security,
[01:06:49.980 --> 01:06:54.580]   nuclear command and control, historical documentation,
[01:06:54.580 --> 01:06:56.500]   that many of the people that you might call
[01:06:56.500 --> 01:07:01.460]   the more dovish type people are worried about,
[01:07:01.460 --> 01:07:05.820]   that the more hawkish people are going to,
[01:07:05.820 --> 01:07:07.660]   the military advisors, right,
[01:07:07.660 --> 01:07:09.740]   are gonna be jamming the president
[01:07:09.740 --> 01:07:13.300]   to make these decisions about which targets,
[01:07:13.300 --> 01:07:15.300]   not if, but what. - Right, which targets.
[01:07:15.300 --> 01:07:17.140]   The argument will be about which targets,
[01:07:17.140 --> 01:07:19.220]   not about if. - Yes, yes.
[01:07:19.220 --> 01:07:24.220]   - I hope that even the warmongers would, at this moment,
[01:07:24.220 --> 01:07:29.380]   because what underlies the idea of you wanting to go to war?
[01:07:30.220 --> 01:07:33.500]   It's power, it's like wanting to destroy the enemy
[01:07:33.500 --> 01:07:35.920]   and be the big kid on the block.
[01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:39.700]   But with nuclear war, it just feels like that falls apart.
[01:07:39.700 --> 01:07:42.180]   Do you think warmongers actually believe
[01:07:42.180 --> 01:07:43.640]   they can win a nuclear war?
[01:07:43.640 --> 01:07:46.840]   - Well, you've raised a really important question
[01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:49.960]   that we look to the historical record for that answer, right?
[01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:54.260]   Because astonishingly, all of this began,
[01:07:54.260 --> 01:07:59.260]   like when Russia first got the bomb in 1949,
[01:08:00.260 --> 01:08:03.500]   the powers that be, and I write about them in the book
[01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:07.420]   as in a setup for the moment of launch, right?
[01:08:07.420 --> 01:08:10.300]   Like it's called how we got here, right?
[01:08:10.300 --> 01:08:14.620]   And you see, and I cite declassified documents
[01:08:14.620 --> 01:08:18.820]   from some of these early meetings
[01:08:18.820 --> 01:08:22.420]   where nuclear war plans were being laid out.
[01:08:22.420 --> 01:08:25.420]   And absolutely, back in the 1950s,
[01:08:25.420 --> 01:08:27.860]   the generals and the admirals that were running
[01:08:27.860 --> 01:08:29.620]   the nuclear command and control system
[01:08:29.620 --> 01:08:34.620]   believed that we could fight and win a nuclear war
[01:08:34.620 --> 01:08:37.820]   despite hundreds of millions of people dying.
[01:08:37.820 --> 01:08:40.820]   This was the prevailing thought.
[01:08:40.820 --> 01:08:45.820]   And only over time did the kind of concept come into play
[01:08:45.820 --> 01:08:51.300]   that no, we can never have a nuclear war.
[01:08:51.300 --> 01:08:55.780]   It's the famous Gorbachev and Reagan joint statement.
[01:08:55.780 --> 01:09:00.060]   A nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.
[01:09:00.060 --> 01:09:05.060]   But before that, many people believed that it could be won
[01:09:05.060 --> 01:09:07.540]   and they were preparing for that.
[01:09:07.540 --> 01:09:11.420]   - Not to be political and not to be ageist,
[01:09:11.420 --> 01:09:15.660]   but do cognitive abilities and all that kind of stuff
[01:09:15.660 --> 01:09:17.060]   come into play here?
[01:09:17.060 --> 01:09:19.540]   So if so much is riding on the president,
[01:09:19.540 --> 01:09:24.100]   is there tests that are conducted?
[01:09:24.100 --> 01:09:27.260]   Is there regular training procedures on the president
[01:09:27.260 --> 01:09:28.300]   that you're aware of?
[01:09:28.300 --> 01:09:29.940]   Do you know?
[01:09:29.940 --> 01:09:32.300]   - I don't think that has anything to do with ageism.
[01:09:32.300 --> 01:09:33.540]   I think it has to do with,
[01:09:33.540 --> 01:09:37.340]   I think it's an earnest question, a really powerful one.
[01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:41.380]   And if people were to ask that question of themselves
[01:09:41.380 --> 01:09:44.580]   or their sort of dinner party guests
[01:09:44.580 --> 01:09:47.340]   or their family around the dinner table guests,
[01:09:47.340 --> 01:09:49.180]   you might come to a real good conclusion
[01:09:49.180 --> 01:09:51.100]   about how bad our political system is
[01:09:51.100 --> 01:09:53.420]   and how bad our presidential candidates are.
[01:09:53.420 --> 01:09:56.980]   Because why on earth there would be two candidates,
[01:09:56.980 --> 01:09:58.900]   one of whom has cognitive problems
[01:09:58.900 --> 01:10:02.100]   and the other of whom has judgment problems.
[01:10:02.100 --> 01:10:06.060]   These are the two biggest issues with a nuclear launch,
[01:10:06.060 --> 01:10:07.820]   judgment and cognition.
[01:10:07.820 --> 01:10:12.100]   And so where's the young-ish,
[01:10:12.100 --> 01:10:16.980]   thoughtful, forward-looking,
[01:10:16.980 --> 01:10:22.940]   wise, dedicated, civil servant?
[01:10:23.940 --> 01:10:24.980]   Running for president.
[01:10:24.980 --> 01:10:27.860]   I know that sounds, you know,
[01:10:27.860 --> 01:10:32.180]   fantastical, but I wish it weren't.
[01:10:32.180 --> 01:10:34.540]   - So that's one of the things that you really think about
[01:10:34.540 --> 01:10:36.660]   when voting for president,
[01:10:36.660 --> 01:10:39.940]   is this scenario that we've been describing,
[01:10:39.940 --> 01:10:41.820]   these six minutes.
[01:10:41.820 --> 01:10:44.900]   Imagine the man or woman sitting there six minutes
[01:10:44.900 --> 01:10:46.420]   waiting for the pot of coffee.
[01:10:46.420 --> 01:10:49.580]   - But I think about that issue
[01:10:49.580 --> 01:10:53.820]   with any war, right?
[01:10:53.820 --> 01:10:57.780]   I mean, prior to writing "Nuclear War Scenario,"
[01:10:57.780 --> 01:11:01.380]   I previously wrote six books
[01:11:01.380 --> 01:11:06.300]   on military and intelligence programs
[01:11:06.300 --> 01:11:08.820]   designed to prevent nuclear war.
[01:11:08.820 --> 01:11:12.780]   And I believe the president as commander-in-chief
[01:11:12.780 --> 01:11:18.180]   should be of the highest character possible
[01:11:18.180 --> 01:11:22.660]   because the programs, the wars that we have fought
[01:11:22.660 --> 01:11:24.980]   since World War II have all been,
[01:11:24.980 --> 01:11:28.380]   you know, how many octogenarian sources have I interviewed?
[01:11:28.380 --> 01:11:31.780]   I'm talking about Nobel Laureates and weapons designer
[01:11:31.780 --> 01:11:35.180]   and spy pilots and engineers in general.
[01:11:35.180 --> 01:11:38.860]   They've all said to me with great pride, you know,
[01:11:38.860 --> 01:11:43.660]   we prevented World War III, nuclear World War III, right?
[01:11:43.660 --> 01:11:45.620]   But that idea that the commander-in-chief
[01:11:45.620 --> 01:11:49.820]   and everyone within the national security apparatus
[01:11:49.820 --> 01:11:53.300]   should be making really good decisions about war,
[01:11:53.300 --> 01:11:55.660]   it's the oldest cliche in the world that, you know,
[01:11:55.660 --> 01:11:58.300]   the wars are fought by the young kids.
[01:11:58.300 --> 01:12:01.740]   And that is, it's not a cliche, it's true.
[01:12:01.740 --> 01:12:04.100]   And so the character part about the president
[01:12:04.100 --> 01:12:08.140]   should be in play, whether we're thinking about nuclear war
[01:12:08.140 --> 01:12:10.140]   or any war, in my opinion.
[01:12:10.140 --> 01:12:14.340]   - Well, I agree with you, first of all,
[01:12:14.340 --> 01:12:17.700]   but it feels like when nuclear war,
[01:12:17.700 --> 01:12:21.860]   one person becomes like exponentially more important.
[01:12:21.860 --> 01:12:25.220]   With a regular war, the decision to go to war or not,
[01:12:25.220 --> 01:12:30.820]   advisors start mattering more, there's judgment issues.
[01:12:30.820 --> 01:12:35.820]   You can start to make arguments for sort of more leeway
[01:12:35.820 --> 01:12:39.420]   in terms of what kind of people we elect.
[01:12:39.420 --> 01:12:41.340]   It seems like with nuclear war, there's no leeway.
[01:12:41.340 --> 01:12:45.660]   It's like one person can resist this,
[01:12:45.660 --> 01:12:50.300]   the jamming the president force, the warmongers,
[01:12:50.300 --> 01:12:55.220]   the use, like all the calculation involved
[01:12:55.220 --> 01:12:57.220]   in considering what are the errors, the mistakes,
[01:12:57.220 --> 01:12:59.500]   the missiles flying over Russia,
[01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:03.460]   the full dynamics of the geopolitics going on in the world.
[01:13:03.460 --> 01:13:06.300]   Consider all of humanity, the history of humanity,
[01:13:06.300 --> 01:13:09.340]   the future of humanity, your loved,
[01:13:09.340 --> 01:13:12.700]   all of it just loaded in to make a decision.
[01:13:12.700 --> 01:13:14.420]   Then it becomes much more important
[01:13:14.420 --> 01:13:17.660]   that your cognitive abilities are strong
[01:13:17.660 --> 01:13:22.660]   and your judgment abilities against powerful, wise people,
[01:13:22.660 --> 01:13:27.580]   just as a human being are strong.
[01:13:27.580 --> 01:13:30.700]   So I think that's something to really, really consider
[01:13:30.700 --> 01:13:32.220]   when you vote for president.
[01:13:32.220 --> 01:13:35.740]   But to which degree is it really on the president
[01:13:35.740 --> 01:13:37.700]   versus to the people advising?
[01:13:37.700 --> 01:13:39.580]   Oh no, it's on the president.
[01:13:39.580 --> 01:13:40.940]   The president has to make the call.
[01:13:40.940 --> 01:13:44.100]   And that six minute window happens so fast.
[01:13:44.100 --> 01:13:47.300]   I mean, the president is gonna be being moved
[01:13:47.300 --> 01:13:48.220]   for part of that time.
[01:13:48.220 --> 01:13:52.380]   The secret service is gonna be up against STRATCOM,
[01:13:52.380 --> 01:13:54.980]   STRATCOM saying, "We need the launch orders."
[01:13:54.980 --> 01:13:56.540]   And the secret service is gonna be saying,
[01:13:56.540 --> 01:13:58.360]   "We need to move the president."
[01:13:58.360 --> 01:14:01.180]   So it's not as much that he's delegating the issues,
[01:14:01.180 --> 01:14:03.700]   it's more like the issue is being postponed
[01:14:03.700 --> 01:14:05.580]   because there is only one issue,
[01:14:05.580 --> 01:14:08.040]   for the president to say these targets,
[01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:11.620]   for him to choose from the Denny's like menu,
[01:14:11.620 --> 01:14:13.100]   "Okay, this is what we're gonna go with."
[01:14:13.100 --> 01:14:15.940]   And then this astonishing thing happens.
[01:14:15.940 --> 01:14:19.020]   The president takes out his wallet.
[01:14:19.020 --> 01:14:22.500]   He has a card in it that's colloquially called the biscuit.
[01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:25.900]   And that card with the codes matches up an item
[01:14:25.900 --> 01:14:30.060]   in the briefcase, in the football,
[01:14:30.060 --> 01:14:33.580]   that then is received by an officer
[01:14:33.580 --> 01:14:37.180]   underneath the Pentagon in that bunker.
[01:14:37.180 --> 01:14:39.380]   It's a call and response Lex.
[01:14:39.380 --> 01:14:42.140]   It's like, you know, alpha zeta, right?
[01:14:42.140 --> 01:14:43.100]   That's it.
[01:14:43.100 --> 01:14:48.100]   And then back so that the individual in the bunker realizes
[01:14:48.100 --> 01:14:53.920]   they are getting the command from the president.
[01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:58.240]   And then that order is passed to STRATCOM.
[01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:03.300]   And STRATCOM, the commander of STRATCOM,
[01:15:03.300 --> 01:15:06.660]   and I interviewed a former commander of STRATCOM.
[01:15:06.660 --> 01:15:10.420]   Commander of STRATCOM then follows orders,
[01:15:10.420 --> 01:15:15.420]   which is he delivers the launch orders to the nuclear triad.
[01:15:15.420 --> 01:15:18.740]   And what's done is done.
[01:15:18.740 --> 01:15:21.940]   - What would you do if you were the commander of STRATCOM
[01:15:21.940 --> 01:15:22.940]   in that situation?
[01:15:22.940 --> 01:15:23.780]   What would you do?
[01:15:23.780 --> 01:15:25.500]   'Cause I think my gut reaction right now,
[01:15:25.500 --> 01:15:28.180]   if you just throw me in there, I would refuse orders.
[01:15:28.180 --> 01:15:30.980]   - Okay, so good question.
[01:15:30.980 --> 01:15:35.460]   I asked that exact question to one of my
[01:15:35.460 --> 01:15:39.620]   very helpful sources on the book, Dr. Glenn McDuff,
[01:15:39.620 --> 01:15:44.620]   who is at Los Alamos and who for a while was the classified,
[01:15:44.620 --> 01:15:49.260]   they have a museum that's classified within the lab.
[01:15:49.260 --> 01:15:51.420]   And he was the historian in charge of it, right?
[01:15:51.420 --> 01:15:52.740]   So he's a nuclear weapons engineer.
[01:15:52.740 --> 01:15:54.740]   He worked on Star Wars during the Reagan era.
[01:15:54.740 --> 01:15:56.640]   And he does a lot having to do
[01:15:56.640 --> 01:15:58.500]   with the history of Los Alamos.
[01:15:58.500 --> 01:16:03.500]   And the, by the way, the Oppenheimer movie really,
[01:16:03.500 --> 01:16:07.940]   'cause I've reported on nuclear weapons for 12 years now.
[01:16:07.940 --> 01:16:11.740]   And Oppenheimer movie had a very, to me,
[01:16:11.740 --> 01:16:16.140]   positive impact on Los Alamos's transparency
[01:16:16.140 --> 01:16:17.620]   with people like me.
[01:16:17.620 --> 01:16:20.540]   They had a real willingness to share information.
[01:16:20.540 --> 01:16:23.100]   I think before perhaps they were on their heels
[01:16:23.100 --> 01:16:26.220]   feeling they needed to be on the defensive,
[01:16:26.220 --> 01:16:28.040]   but now they're much more forthcoming.
[01:16:28.040 --> 01:16:30.060]   They were super helpful.
[01:16:30.060 --> 01:16:31.900]   I can tell you the origin story of the football,
[01:16:31.900 --> 01:16:34.260]   which they declassified for the book.
[01:16:34.260 --> 01:16:37.180]   But I asked this question to Dr. Glenn McDuff, right?
[01:16:37.180 --> 01:16:39.980]   Like in a different manner, I said,
[01:16:39.980 --> 01:16:44.380]   "Is there a chance that the STRATCOM commander
[01:16:44.380 --> 01:16:47.660]   "would defy orders?"
[01:16:47.660 --> 01:16:51.700]   And he said, "Annie, you have a better chance
[01:16:51.700 --> 01:16:53.040]   "winning Powerball."
[01:16:53.040 --> 01:16:57.300]   Why do you think, what's his intuition behind that?
[01:16:58.080 --> 01:17:00.880]   You don't wind up a STRATCOM commander
[01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:03.820]   unless you are someone who follows orders.
[01:17:03.820 --> 01:17:07.960]   You follow orders.
[01:17:07.960 --> 01:17:10.760]   - You don't think there's a deep humanity there?
[01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:14.880]   Because his intuition is about everything we know so far,
[01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:17.120]   but this situation has never happened
[01:17:17.120 --> 01:17:18.300]   in the history of Earth.
[01:17:18.300 --> 01:17:19.140]   - Well, this is true.
[01:17:19.140 --> 01:17:20.880]   And all right, so you're raising a really tricky,
[01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:22.720]   interesting conundrum here.
[01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:27.260]   Because during COVID, when President Trump
[01:17:27.260 --> 01:17:30.960]   and the leader of North Korea were kind of locked
[01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:35.180]   in various relationships with one another,
[01:17:35.180 --> 01:17:38.300]   good, bad, threatening, non-threatening, friendly,
[01:17:38.300 --> 01:17:42.700]   just bananas, you might say, like not presidential behavior.
[01:17:42.700 --> 01:17:47.300]   If you were someone watching C-SPAN, like I do,
[01:17:47.300 --> 01:17:50.980]   nerding out on what STRATCOM was actually saying
[01:17:50.980 --> 01:17:55.600]   about all this, you noticed that STRATCOM commanders
[01:17:55.600 --> 01:18:00.000]   were speaking out publicly to Congress
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:03.160]   more so than I had ever seen before.
[01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:07.280]   And this issue came up, would you defy presidential order?
[01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:10.440]   So the caveat, I would say, to McDuff's answer
[01:18:10.440 --> 01:18:13.040]   of easier to win the Powerball, right,
[01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:20.100]   is that if the commander of STRATCOM
[01:18:21.060 --> 01:18:26.060]   interpreted the president's behavior to be unreliable,
[01:18:26.060 --> 01:18:32.940]   to be non-presidential, then dot, dot, dot.
[01:18:32.940 --> 01:18:39.900]   But now you're into some really radical territory.
[01:18:39.900 --> 01:18:44.580]   - Well, I mean, fundamentally,
[01:18:44.580 --> 01:18:48.820]   it feels like just looking at all the presidents
[01:18:48.820 --> 01:18:51.300]   of the United States in my lifetime,
[01:18:51.300 --> 01:18:53.700]   it feels like none of them are qualified
[01:18:53.700 --> 01:18:55.400]   for the six minutes.
[01:18:55.400 --> 01:19:00.400]   So I could see as being the commander of STRATCOM,
[01:19:00.400 --> 01:19:06.180]   being like, this guy, basically respecting no president.
[01:19:06.180 --> 01:19:08.740]   I know you're supposed to be commander-in-chief,
[01:19:08.740 --> 01:19:12.820]   but in this situation, saying, I mean, everybody,
[01:19:12.820 --> 01:19:17.820]   Bush, Obama, Trump, Biden, if I was a commander-in-chief,
[01:19:18.380 --> 01:19:20.020]   commander of STRATCOM, I'd be like,
[01:19:20.020 --> 01:19:22.180]   what does this guy know about any of this?
[01:19:22.180 --> 01:19:25.920]   I would defy orders.
[01:19:25.920 --> 01:19:27.140]   I mean, in this situation,
[01:19:27.140 --> 01:19:31.860]   when the future of human civilization hangs in the balance,
[01:19:31.860 --> 01:19:36.860]   I mean, to be the person that says yes, launch,
[01:19:36.860 --> 01:19:41.980]   no matter what, I just can't see a human being on Earth
[01:19:41.980 --> 01:19:45.400]   being able to do that in the United States of America.
[01:19:45.400 --> 01:19:47.420]   That's a hell of a decision.
[01:19:47.420 --> 01:19:49.660]   Like, this is it, that's it.
[01:19:49.660 --> 01:19:52.360]   - Well, but now you've raised a great, important,
[01:19:52.360 --> 01:19:55.580]   presentation essentially,
[01:19:55.580 --> 01:19:58.860]   because what you're saying is people be aware, right?
[01:19:58.860 --> 01:20:01.100]   Be aware of like why you're voting
[01:20:01.100 --> 01:20:04.660]   or why certain individuals are being escalated
[01:20:04.660 --> 01:20:07.380]   to even being able to run for president.
[01:20:07.380 --> 01:20:08.300]   What does that mean?
[01:20:08.300 --> 01:20:10.940]   Why are people in America not more involved as citizens?
[01:20:10.940 --> 01:20:12.620]   Do we have a responsibility for that?
[01:20:12.620 --> 01:20:15.540]   Because you've opened up the door for people to understand,
[01:20:15.540 --> 01:20:19.220]   okay, the ultimate thing is the nuclear launch decision.
[01:20:19.220 --> 01:20:21.960]   So, if a person can't be trusted with that,
[01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:26.300]   you know, everything unravels from there.
[01:20:26.300 --> 01:20:27.220]   - Also, I want to look up
[01:20:27.220 --> 01:20:29.020]   who's the commander of STRATCOM now.
[01:20:29.020 --> 01:20:33.100]   Speaking of which,
[01:20:33.100 --> 01:20:35.820]   you've interviewed a lot of experts for this book.
[01:20:35.820 --> 01:20:40.820]   Is there some commonalities about the way,
[01:20:40.820 --> 01:20:42.980]   you've talked about this a little bit,
[01:20:42.980 --> 01:20:45.380]   but in the way they see this whole situation,
[01:20:45.380 --> 01:20:50.380]   what like scares them the most about this whole system
[01:20:50.380 --> 01:20:54.340]   and the whole possibility of nuclear war?
[01:20:54.340 --> 01:20:57.300]   - I first learned about nuclear weapons
[01:20:57.300 --> 01:21:00.220]   from a guy called Al O'Donnell,
[01:21:00.220 --> 01:21:02.660]   who appears in my earlier books,
[01:21:02.660 --> 01:21:04.960]   because I interviewed him
[01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:06.780]   for over a period of four and a half years,
[01:21:06.780 --> 01:21:09.660]   because he was an engineer
[01:21:09.660 --> 01:21:13.420]   who actually wired nuclear bombs in the 1950s.
[01:21:13.420 --> 01:21:16.780]   He was a member of the Manhattan Project in 1946,
[01:21:16.780 --> 01:21:19.020]   worked on Operation Crossroads,
[01:21:19.020 --> 01:21:24.020]   the first explosions of nuclear bombs after the war ended,
[01:21:24.020 --> 01:21:25.380]   after World War II ended,
[01:21:25.380 --> 01:21:29.900]   and went on to arm, wire, and fire
[01:21:29.900 --> 01:21:34.900]   186 out of the 200-some-odd atmospheric nuclear tests
[01:21:34.900 --> 01:21:39.060]   that the United States did before this was banned.
[01:21:39.060 --> 01:21:44.060]   And so I learned from him the power of these weapons, right?
[01:21:44.060 --> 01:21:49.540]   And I learned from him this very almost nationalistic idea
[01:21:49.540 --> 01:21:53.780]   about how important it was to have nuclear weapons.
[01:21:53.780 --> 01:21:55.960]   And while I learned a lot about his human side,
[01:21:55.960 --> 01:21:58.540]   I also saw the side of him
[01:21:58.540 --> 01:22:01.940]   that was very Cold War warrior, right?
[01:22:01.940 --> 01:22:04.200]   And then, so he was kind of the first,
[01:22:04.200 --> 01:22:06.540]   and then, I don't know, there've been a hundred people
[01:22:06.540 --> 01:22:09.460]   that have been directly involved in nuclear weapons
[01:22:09.460 --> 01:22:10.940]   along the way, Billy Waugh,
[01:22:10.940 --> 01:22:15.900]   who was my subject of my main sort of central figure
[01:22:15.900 --> 01:22:18.580]   in a book I wrote about the CIA's paramilitary
[01:22:18.580 --> 01:22:21.300]   called "Surprise, Kill, Vanish."
[01:22:21.300 --> 01:22:26.300]   And Waugh halo-jumped a tactical nuclear weapon
[01:22:26.300 --> 01:22:30.280]   into the Nevada test site with a small team,
[01:22:30.280 --> 01:22:32.500]   almost unknown to anyone, right?
[01:22:32.500 --> 01:22:34.180]   Only recently declassified.
[01:22:34.260 --> 01:22:36.220]   And so his position was like,
[01:22:36.220 --> 01:22:40.380]   tactical nuclear weapons may end up being used.
[01:22:40.380 --> 01:22:44.340]   So I'm trying to speak here to the scope
[01:22:44.340 --> 01:22:48.180]   of different people I have interviewed over the years,
[01:22:48.180 --> 01:22:49.140]   right?
[01:22:49.140 --> 01:22:52.700]   And what has happened is as I've gotten closer
[01:22:52.700 --> 01:22:55.660]   to the present day, you know, in arrears,
[01:22:55.660 --> 01:22:59.220]   there seems to be a growing movement
[01:22:59.220 --> 01:23:01.140]   from some of these Cold Warriors
[01:23:01.140 --> 01:23:05.940]   off the position of nuclear weapons make us great
[01:23:05.940 --> 01:23:10.940]   and strong toward something must be done
[01:23:10.940 --> 01:23:16.620]   to reduce this threat.
[01:23:16.620 --> 01:23:22.860]   - How much do you know in the same way
[01:23:22.860 --> 01:23:24.600]   that you know about the United States?
[01:23:24.600 --> 01:23:26.580]   How much do you know about the Russian side?
[01:23:26.580 --> 01:23:31.020]   Maybe the Chinese side, India and Pakistan,
[01:23:31.020 --> 01:23:33.140]   that all of this, like what,
[01:23:33.140 --> 01:23:35.220]   how their thinking differs perhaps?
[01:23:35.220 --> 01:23:38.140]   - Yes, well, for that, you wanna go to the experts, right?
[01:23:38.140 --> 01:23:41.140]   So in, for Russia, for example,
[01:23:41.140 --> 01:23:44.860]   there's a guy called Pavel Podvig,
[01:23:44.860 --> 01:23:49.700]   who is probably the West's top expert
[01:23:49.700 --> 01:23:53.180]   on Russian nuclear forces.
[01:23:53.180 --> 01:23:55.860]   He works in parallel with the UN.
[01:23:55.860 --> 01:23:59.160]   He also studied in Moscow and he interviewed,
[01:23:59.160 --> 01:24:01.240]   so my information comes from him, right?
[01:24:01.240 --> 01:24:04.960]   Like you do all the footwork to know what questions to ask,
[01:24:04.960 --> 01:24:08.500]   and then you take the very specific questions to him.
[01:24:08.500 --> 01:24:12.280]   And I learned from him about how the Russian command
[01:24:12.280 --> 01:24:13.760]   and control goes down.
[01:24:13.760 --> 01:24:18.760]   And it's very similar to ours because America and Russia
[01:24:18.760 --> 01:24:22.320]   have been at sort of nuclear dueling with one another
[01:24:22.320 --> 01:24:24.740]   for 75 years now.
[01:24:24.740 --> 01:24:27.500]   And so everything we have, they have, right?
[01:24:27.500 --> 01:24:30.800]   With the exception of we have a great satellite system
[01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:32.080]   and they have a super flawed one.
[01:24:32.080 --> 01:24:33.140]   Theirs is called Tundra.
[01:24:33.140 --> 01:24:36.720]   And even Pavel Podvig admitted
[01:24:36.720 --> 01:24:39.280]   that there are serious flaws in Tundra.
[01:24:39.280 --> 01:24:41.980]   The Russian satellite system, for example,
[01:24:41.980 --> 01:24:45.200]   can mistake sunlight for flames,
[01:24:45.200 --> 01:24:48.440]   can mistake clouds for a nuclear launch.
[01:24:48.440 --> 01:24:50.600]   This is a fact, okay?
[01:24:50.600 --> 01:24:54.760]   And what was interesting in interviewing him
[01:24:54.760 --> 01:24:59.600]   was also this recent very, very dangerous shift
[01:24:59.600 --> 01:25:02.480]   in Russian nuclear policy, which is this.
[01:25:02.480 --> 01:25:05.660]   Many Russian experts will tell you
[01:25:05.660 --> 01:25:07.440]   that Russia has always maintained
[01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:10.280]   that it never had a launch on warning policy.
[01:25:10.280 --> 01:25:12.540]   Now, I don't know if I believe that's true,
[01:25:12.540 --> 01:25:14.280]   but I'm just telling you what they say.
[01:25:14.280 --> 01:25:16.360]   And this is coming from the generals,
[01:25:16.360 --> 01:25:18.840]   the Cold War generals in Soviet Russia saying,
[01:25:18.840 --> 01:25:20.720]   "Oh, no, no, no, we would wait."
[01:25:20.720 --> 01:25:22.800]   They were kind of playing the noble warrior.
[01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:26.640]   "We would wait to absorb a nuclear attack
[01:25:26.640 --> 01:25:28.600]   "until we launched, okay?"
[01:25:28.600 --> 01:25:31.040]   So many Americans, experts will tell you
[01:25:31.040 --> 01:25:33.560]   that that's just posturing and propaganda.
[01:25:33.560 --> 01:25:35.040]   But that was their official position.
[01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:37.860]   And that changed just two years ago
[01:25:37.860 --> 01:25:40.040]   when Putin gave a speech.
[01:25:40.040 --> 01:25:43.920]   And he said that their position had changed,
[01:25:43.920 --> 01:25:46.280]   that they will no longer wait to absorb an attack,
[01:25:46.280 --> 01:25:50.600]   that once they learn of, how did he phrase it?
[01:25:50.600 --> 01:25:54.160]   He called it like the trajectory of the missiles, right?
[01:25:54.160 --> 01:25:56.880]   Which is a way of sort of talking about parody,
[01:25:56.880 --> 01:26:00.360]   the same way we see the missile coming over in mid-course.
[01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:04.320]   Putin made that same statement and said we would launch.
[01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:06.040]   - What do you know of the way Putin thinks
[01:26:06.040 --> 01:26:09.640]   about nuclear weapons and nuclear war?
[01:26:09.640 --> 01:26:13.800]   Is it just something to allude to in a speech?
[01:26:13.800 --> 01:26:15.320]   Or do you think he contemplates
[01:26:15.320 --> 01:26:17.020]   the possibilities of nuclear war?
[01:26:17.020 --> 01:26:20.140]   - I don't know, but if I had to guess,
[01:26:20.140 --> 01:26:21.080]   it would go like this.
[01:26:21.080 --> 01:26:22.560]   I would look at his background,
[01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:25.200]   and he comes from the intelligence world, right?
[01:26:25.200 --> 01:26:29.360]   So my experience in interviewing old timers
[01:26:29.360 --> 01:26:31.840]   who've spent decades working for the CIA,
[01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:36.360]   or even NRO, or NSA, I know the way they think
[01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:39.160]   from having spent hundreds of hours interviewing them.
[01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:44.160]   And then I know the way that military men think,
[01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:47.040]   and it's very different, right?
[01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:50.380]   So Putin's not a military person per se.
[01:26:50.380 --> 01:26:52.440]   He's an intelligence officer.
[01:26:52.440 --> 01:26:54.820]   So what would concern me there,
[01:26:54.820 --> 01:26:56.980]   if I had to guess about his mindset,
[01:26:56.980 --> 01:26:59.140]   has to do with paranoia, right?
[01:26:59.140 --> 01:27:03.900]   Most intelligence officers must have a degree
[01:27:03.900 --> 01:27:08.620]   of healthy paranoia, or they're gonna wind up dead, right?
[01:27:08.620 --> 01:27:11.740]   And so that's not a great quality to have.
[01:27:11.740 --> 01:27:14.380]   - You would be more trigger-happy, perhaps.
[01:27:14.380 --> 01:27:19.380]   So you would be more prone to respond to erroneous signals.
[01:27:19.380 --> 01:27:22.380]   - And you'd be suspicious, and you can see that now.
[01:27:22.380 --> 01:27:27.380]   There's such a, you know, incredible distrust,
[01:27:27.380 --> 01:27:33.040]   and sort of real conflict between Russia,
[01:27:33.040 --> 01:27:39.600]   between its leader and NATO,
[01:27:39.600 --> 01:27:42.480]   between its leader and all of the West.
[01:27:42.480 --> 01:27:47.280]   And then that is fueled by his closest advisors.
[01:27:47.280 --> 01:27:52.680]   Kind of, you know, they seem to be,
[01:27:52.680 --> 01:27:54.400]   from the statements they have made
[01:27:54.400 --> 01:27:56.080]   that I've read in translation,
[01:27:56.080 --> 01:27:58.460]   they seem to be fostering that same idea,
[01:27:58.460 --> 01:28:03.300]   that, you know, NATO really has it in for Russia.
[01:28:03.300 --> 01:28:05.840]   America really has it in.
[01:28:05.840 --> 01:28:09.760]   And that is so dangerous and disheartening.
[01:28:09.760 --> 01:28:11.160]   - And perhaps makes it less likely
[01:28:11.160 --> 01:28:14.080]   that the president would pick up the phone
[01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:15.680]   and talk to the other president.
[01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:18.120]   - And/or that the close advisors
[01:28:18.120 --> 01:28:20.420]   near the president would make that happen.
[01:28:20.420 --> 01:28:24.200]   - You were talking about the procedure with the football.
[01:28:24.200 --> 01:28:27.480]   Is there any concern for cyber attacks,
[01:28:27.480 --> 01:28:32.480]   for sort of security concerns of, at every level here,
[01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:37.480]   false signals, errors, shutting down
[01:28:37.480 --> 01:28:40.160]   the channels of communication through cyber attacks,
[01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:41.600]   all that kind of stuff?
[01:28:41.600 --> 01:28:43.920]   - So to answer those questions,
[01:28:43.920 --> 01:28:45.440]   I interviewed a number of people,
[01:28:45.440 --> 01:28:48.800]   but most specifically General Tuhill,
[01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:52.160]   who was Obama's cyber chief.
[01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:56.280]   And he was actually America's first cyber chief.
[01:28:56.280 --> 01:29:01.280]   And the nuclear command and control system,
[01:29:01.280 --> 01:29:06.400]   and really the triad, functions on analog systems.
[01:29:06.400 --> 01:29:09.720]   It functions on old school systems
[01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:12.200]   if there's not digital interface,
[01:29:12.200 --> 01:29:14.160]   you can't hack into it, right?
[01:29:14.160 --> 01:29:17.880]   So most of the issues that I raise in the book
[01:29:17.880 --> 01:29:22.880]   have to do with what happens to cyber
[01:29:22.880 --> 01:29:25.320]   after a nuclear attack, right?
[01:29:25.320 --> 01:29:29.760]   What happens to cyber in the minutes after a bomb,
[01:29:29.760 --> 01:29:33.080]   a nuclear weapon strikes America,
[01:29:33.080 --> 01:29:36.880]   and how that impacts the ability
[01:29:36.880 --> 01:29:38.880]   for people to communicate with one another.
[01:29:38.880 --> 01:29:42.700]   And that's when chaos takes control.
[01:29:42.700 --> 01:29:46.080]   - Well, let's talk about it.
[01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:51.080]   So, God forbid, if a nuclear weapon reaches its target,
[01:29:51.080 --> 01:29:54.900]   what happens?
[01:29:54.900 --> 01:29:58.400]   What, perhaps you could say,
[01:29:58.400 --> 01:30:01.240]   what you think would be the first target hit,
[01:30:01.240 --> 01:30:02.480]   would it be the Pentagon?
[01:30:02.480 --> 01:30:07.000]   - I was told by many people I interviewed
[01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.720]   that the biggest fear in Washington, D.C.
[01:30:09.720 --> 01:30:12.480]   is what's called a bolt-out-of-the-blue attack.
[01:30:12.480 --> 01:30:16.360]   That's an unwarned nuclear attack against Washington, D.C.
[01:30:16.360 --> 01:30:17.920]   The target would be the Pentagon.
[01:30:17.920 --> 01:30:20.920]   And that's what I begin the scenario with, you know?
[01:30:20.920 --> 01:30:25.920]   And I reported in graphic, horrifying detail what happens,
[01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:28.680]   because I don't know what's worse,
[01:30:28.680 --> 01:30:30.000]   me writing that all out,
[01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:33.400]   or the fact that it's all documented
[01:30:33.400 --> 01:30:36.160]   by the Defense Department.
[01:30:36.160 --> 01:30:39.000]   I mean, they have been documenting the effect
[01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:43.040]   of nuclear weapons on people and animals and things
[01:30:43.040 --> 01:30:47.040]   since the earliest days of the Cold War.
[01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:51.400]   And all of the details I pull are from these documents
[01:30:51.400 --> 01:30:54.040]   like the effects of nuclear weapons.
[01:30:54.040 --> 01:30:59.160]   And again, this document was the original information,
[01:30:59.160 --> 01:31:00.560]   the original data in this document
[01:31:00.560 --> 01:31:03.280]   come from Hiroshima and Nagasaki, right?
[01:31:03.280 --> 01:31:04.600]   It was all classified.
[01:31:04.600 --> 01:31:06.040]   And then it was built upon
[01:31:06.040 --> 01:31:11.040]   by those 200-some-odd atmospheric nuclear weapons tests.
[01:31:11.040 --> 01:31:12.040]   We did.
[01:31:12.040 --> 01:31:16.320]   And, you know, we're talking about like millimeters
[01:31:16.320 --> 01:31:18.440]   and inches, we're talking about the Defense Department
[01:31:18.440 --> 01:31:22.240]   knowing that, oh, seven and a half miles out,
[01:31:22.240 --> 01:31:25.800]   the upholstery on cars will spontaneously combust.
[01:31:25.800 --> 01:31:27.840]   The pine needles will catch on fire.
[01:31:27.840 --> 01:31:30.760]   They will start more fires, you know?
[01:31:30.760 --> 01:31:35.720]   You have all kinds of mayhem and chaos happening
[01:31:35.720 --> 01:31:42.760]   based on reported facts from observations.
[01:31:42.760 --> 01:31:48.040]   And this is really shocking and grotesque at the same time.
[01:31:48.040 --> 01:31:53.840]   - So one warhead reaches the Pentagon,
[01:31:53.840 --> 01:31:57.280]   everybody in the Pentagon perishes.
[01:31:57.280 --> 01:32:00.960]   180 million degrees.
[01:32:00.960 --> 01:32:05.680]   The fireball on a one megaton nuclear weapon
[01:32:05.680 --> 01:32:09.280]   is 19 football fields of fire.
[01:32:09.280 --> 01:32:10.480]   Think about that.
[01:32:10.480 --> 01:32:13.880]   Nothing remains, nothing remains.
[01:32:13.880 --> 01:32:18.880]   - And there's then a radius where people die immediately.
[01:32:18.880 --> 01:32:23.760]   And then there's people that are dead when found.
[01:32:25.280 --> 01:32:28.840]   - And then there's people that will die slowly.
[01:32:28.840 --> 01:32:31.200]   - Yes. - The centric rings.
[01:32:31.200 --> 01:32:34.320]   - And again, rings defined by defense scientists.
[01:32:34.320 --> 01:32:36.640]   But before that, you know, the bomb goes off.
[01:32:36.640 --> 01:32:39.000]   Then there's this blast wave
[01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:42.320]   that's like several hundred miles an hour
[01:32:42.320 --> 01:32:46.920]   pushing out like a bulldozer, knocking everything down.
[01:32:46.920 --> 01:32:49.160]   Bridges, buildings.
[01:32:49.160 --> 01:32:53.280]   I mean, you can read FEMA manuals
[01:32:53.280 --> 01:32:55.200]   about what the rubble will be like.
[01:32:55.200 --> 01:32:59.960]   You're talking about 30 feet deep rubble
[01:32:59.960 --> 01:33:01.360]   as the buildings go over.
[01:33:01.360 --> 01:33:04.080]   Six, seven, eight, 10 miles out.
[01:33:04.080 --> 01:33:09.400]   That speaks nothing of the megafires that will then ensue.
[01:33:09.400 --> 01:33:11.280]   So once all these people die
[01:33:11.280 --> 01:33:13.440]   and third degree radiation burns,
[01:33:13.440 --> 01:33:15.080]   did you even know there was such a thing
[01:33:15.080 --> 01:33:17.480]   as fourth degree radiation burns, right?
[01:33:17.480 --> 01:33:20.880]   We're talking about the wind ripping the skin
[01:33:20.880 --> 01:33:23.440]   off people's faces many miles out.
[01:33:24.960 --> 01:33:28.840]   And then you have a sucking action, right?
[01:33:28.840 --> 01:33:31.360]   Everyone is, or many people are familiar
[01:33:31.360 --> 01:33:34.000]   with what the nuclear mushroom cloud looks like.
[01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:37.360]   And its stem is actually creates,
[01:33:37.360 --> 01:33:39.360]   and again, this is from physicists
[01:33:39.360 --> 01:33:42.240]   who advise the defense department on this.
[01:33:42.240 --> 01:33:45.840]   The sucking up into the nuclear stem,
[01:33:45.840 --> 01:33:47.960]   300 mile an hour winds.
[01:33:47.960 --> 01:33:49.720]   You're talking about people miles out
[01:33:49.720 --> 01:33:51.560]   getting sucked up into that stem.
[01:33:51.560 --> 01:33:53.800]   When you see the mushroom cloud, Lex,
[01:33:53.800 --> 01:33:56.720]   that is in a nuclear war, that would be people.
[01:33:56.720 --> 01:34:01.440]   Those are like the remnants of people and of things
[01:34:01.440 --> 01:34:06.440]   in the cloud, 30, 40 mile wide mushroom cloud
[01:34:06.440 --> 01:34:10.080]   blocking out the sun.
[01:34:10.080 --> 01:34:12.840]   And that speaks nothing of the radiation poisoning
[01:34:12.840 --> 01:34:14.040]   that follows.
[01:34:14.040 --> 01:34:16.360]   And then the power grid goes out.
[01:34:16.360 --> 01:34:22.400]   Basically everything we rely on in terms of systems
[01:34:22.400 --> 01:34:24.520]   in our way of life goes out.
[01:34:24.520 --> 01:34:27.040]   You write, quote, "Those who somehow managed
[01:34:27.040 --> 01:34:30.080]   "to escape death by the initial blast, shockwave,
[01:34:30.080 --> 01:34:33.280]   "and firestorm suddenly realize an insidious truth
[01:34:33.280 --> 01:34:38.280]   "about nuclear war, that they're entirely on their own."
[01:34:38.280 --> 01:34:41.780]   Here begins a, quote, "Fight for food and water."
[01:34:41.780 --> 01:34:48.640]   I mean, that is a wake-up call on top of a wake-up call,
[01:34:51.240 --> 01:34:56.240]   that we go back to a kind of primitive fight for survival,
[01:34:56.240 --> 01:34:57.840]   each on their own.
[01:34:57.840 --> 01:35:00.880]   And by the way, those details were given to me
[01:35:00.880 --> 01:35:04.360]   by Obama's FEMA director, Craig Fugate,
[01:35:04.360 --> 01:35:09.360]   who was in charge of, so FEMA is the agency in America
[01:35:09.360 --> 01:35:13.000]   that plans for nuclear war, okay?
[01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.080]   And what Fugate said to me was,
[01:35:15.080 --> 01:35:17.400]   "You know, Annie, we plan for asteroid strikes.
[01:35:17.400 --> 01:35:20.840]   "These are called low-probability,
[01:35:20.840 --> 01:35:23.760]   "but high-consequence events."
[01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:27.000]   And FEMA is the organization that, you know,
[01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.880]   when there's a hurricane or an earthquake or a flood,
[01:35:29.880 --> 01:35:32.080]   FEMA steps in, and they do what's called
[01:35:32.080 --> 01:35:34.360]   population protection planning, right?
[01:35:34.360 --> 01:35:35.680]   They take care of people.
[01:35:35.680 --> 01:35:39.700]   And what Fugate told me is, after a nuclear strike,
[01:35:39.700 --> 01:35:42.920]   after a bolt out of the blue attack, he used those terms,
[01:35:42.920 --> 01:35:45.580]   there is no population protection.
[01:35:45.580 --> 01:35:47.440]   Everyone's dead, right?
[01:35:47.440 --> 01:35:48.720]   And he means that metaphorically,
[01:35:48.720 --> 01:35:50.640]   but also kind of more literally,
[01:35:50.640 --> 01:35:53.480]   because he just said, at that point,
[01:35:53.480 --> 01:35:57.080]   you just hope that you stalked Pedialyte.
[01:35:57.080 --> 01:36:01.240]   - What do you think happens to humans?
[01:36:01.240 --> 01:36:03.920]   Like, how does human nature manifest itself
[01:36:03.920 --> 01:36:05.320]   in such conditions?
[01:36:05.320 --> 01:36:07.600]   Do you think, like, brutality will come out?
[01:36:07.600 --> 01:36:11.160]   Like, people will, just for survival,
[01:36:11.160 --> 01:36:13.880]   will steal, will murder, will?
[01:36:14.840 --> 01:36:16.380]   - I can't imagine that not happening.
[01:36:16.380 --> 01:36:18.380]   I think that's why people love
[01:36:18.380 --> 01:36:21.140]   post-apocalyptic television shows and films,
[01:36:21.140 --> 01:36:22.140]   because they see that.
[01:36:22.140 --> 01:36:23.580]   And then, of course, there's always
[01:36:23.580 --> 01:36:25.820]   one great charismatic person
[01:36:25.820 --> 01:36:27.860]   who's trying to restore morality.
[01:36:27.860 --> 01:36:30.680]   And these are great narratives that people like
[01:36:30.680 --> 01:36:33.500]   to tell themselves in the world of science fiction.
[01:36:33.500 --> 01:36:36.020]   But what we're dealing with is science fact
[01:36:36.020 --> 01:36:41.020]   in this scenario, and it is meant to terrify people
[01:36:41.020 --> 01:36:43.100]   into realizing, wait a minute,
[01:36:43.100 --> 01:36:47.360]   this is a conversation that absolutely should be have had,
[01:36:47.360 --> 01:36:50.920]   while it can still be had.
[01:36:50.920 --> 01:36:52.380]   Because the reality is,
[01:36:52.380 --> 01:36:56.360]   when you have the director of FEMA telling you this,
[01:36:56.360 --> 01:36:57.500]   it's a real wake-up call.
[01:36:57.500 --> 01:37:00.400]   And by the way, Craig Fugate was so
[01:37:00.400 --> 01:37:03.960]   transparently human with me,
[01:37:03.960 --> 01:37:05.600]   and I quote him directly in the book,
[01:37:05.600 --> 01:37:08.720]   but he spoke about, you asked me earlier about,
[01:37:08.720 --> 01:37:10.700]   like, what would be going through the president's mind,
[01:37:10.700 --> 01:37:12.520]   and we don't know, I don't know.
[01:37:12.520 --> 01:37:14.840]   But Craig Fugate told me
[01:37:14.840 --> 01:37:16.240]   what would be going through his mind.
[01:37:16.240 --> 01:37:19.040]   And he said, along the lines, I'm paraphrasing,
[01:37:19.040 --> 01:37:23.040]   like, it's almost something you couldn't even comprehend.
[01:37:23.040 --> 01:37:26.680]   You would just, it would just, like, ruin you.
[01:37:26.680 --> 01:37:29.520]   You know, his words are really powerful.
[01:37:29.520 --> 01:37:32.680]   And of course, the FEMA director in the scenario
[01:37:32.680 --> 01:37:36.000]   is notified in that first window
[01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:37.440]   while the launch, you know,
[01:37:37.440 --> 01:37:39.360]   while the ballistic missile is on its way,
[01:37:39.360 --> 01:37:41.040]   and no one in America yet knows.
[01:37:41.040 --> 01:37:42.960]   And I have the FEMA director
[01:37:42.960 --> 01:37:44.200]   pull over to the side of the road
[01:37:44.200 --> 01:37:46.400]   and jump in a helicopter that's sent for him
[01:37:46.400 --> 01:37:48.560]   to take him to the bunker that FEMA goes to,
[01:37:48.560 --> 01:37:50.080]   which is called Mount Weather.
[01:37:50.080 --> 01:37:52.360]   And so he's aware that,
[01:37:52.360 --> 01:37:54.120]   Fugate was aware that as FEMA director,
[01:37:54.120 --> 01:37:57.400]   you would likely be taken to a safe place
[01:37:57.400 --> 01:38:01.040]   however many hours you're gonna be safe,
[01:38:01.040 --> 01:38:04.160]   or days, or maybe weeks, or maybe months.
[01:38:04.160 --> 01:38:07.480]   But as I also learned from the cyber people I interviewed,
[01:38:07.480 --> 01:38:10.460]   that, you know, there's a complete fallacy
[01:38:10.460 --> 01:38:13.360]   that these military bases can continue functioning.
[01:38:13.360 --> 01:38:15.720]   They run on diesel fuel.
[01:38:15.720 --> 01:38:17.860]   And when the fuel stops pumping,
[01:38:17.860 --> 01:38:19.360]   there's no more generators.
[01:38:19.360 --> 01:38:21.900]   - Electricity's gone.
[01:38:21.900 --> 01:38:28.120]   Communication lines are all gone.
[01:38:28.120 --> 01:38:31.360]   The food supply, all of it,
[01:38:31.360 --> 01:38:33.280]   all the supply chain is gone.
[01:38:33.280 --> 01:38:37.080]   It's terrifying.
[01:38:37.080 --> 01:38:40.780]   And that's just in the first few days,
[01:38:40.780 --> 01:38:41.980]   first few hours.
[01:38:41.980 --> 01:38:45.580]   In part five,
[01:38:45.580 --> 01:38:50.020]   you described the 24 months and beyond.
[01:38:50.020 --> 01:38:52.580]   After this first hour we've been talking about.
[01:38:52.580 --> 01:38:54.940]   So what happens to Earth?
[01:38:54.940 --> 01:38:56.140]   What happens to humans?
[01:38:56.140 --> 01:38:59.640]   If a full-on nuclear war happens?
[01:38:59.640 --> 01:39:02.260]   - So for that,
[01:39:03.340 --> 01:39:07.520]   I was super privileged to talk to Professor Brian Toon,
[01:39:07.520 --> 01:39:10.080]   who is one of the original five authors
[01:39:10.080 --> 01:39:11.920]   of the nuclear winter theory.
[01:39:11.920 --> 01:39:15.920]   And that theory was developed,
[01:39:15.920 --> 01:39:19.540]   was published in the early 1980s.
[01:39:19.540 --> 01:39:23.040]   One of Professor Toon's professors was Carl Sagan,
[01:39:23.040 --> 01:39:25.360]   who was sort of the most famous author
[01:39:25.360 --> 01:39:27.280]   of the nuclear winter theory.
[01:39:27.280 --> 01:39:29.800]   And, you know,
[01:39:29.800 --> 01:39:31.560]   there were all kinds of controversies about it
[01:39:31.560 --> 01:39:33.480]   when it came out, including the defense department
[01:39:33.480 --> 01:39:37.040]   saying it was Soviet propaganda, which it wasn't.
[01:39:37.040 --> 01:39:41.080]   And what the nuclear winter author,
[01:39:41.080 --> 01:39:44.800]   authors conceded back in the '80s
[01:39:44.800 --> 01:39:48.080]   was that their modeling was just the best it could be
[01:39:48.080 --> 01:39:50.320]   based on what they had at the time.
[01:39:50.320 --> 01:39:54.780]   And so now flash forward to where we are in 2024,
[01:39:54.780 --> 01:39:56.560]   and talking to Professor Toon,
[01:39:56.560 --> 01:39:58.000]   who's been working on this issue
[01:39:58.000 --> 01:39:59.840]   for all these decades since,
[01:39:59.840 --> 01:40:04.840]   he shared with me how the climate models today
[01:40:04.840 --> 01:40:07.640]   with the systems we have, the computer systems,
[01:40:07.640 --> 01:40:12.240]   reveal that actually nuclear winter is worse, right?
[01:40:12.240 --> 01:40:15.240]   So to answer your questions,
[01:40:15.240 --> 01:40:17.280]   the bombs stopped falling.
[01:40:17.280 --> 01:40:21.060]   In my scenario, 72 minutes after they first launch.
[01:40:21.060 --> 01:40:22.880]   The bombs stopped falling.
[01:40:22.880 --> 01:40:25.340]   And then the mega fires begin.
[01:40:25.340 --> 01:40:27.440]   Each nuclear weapon will have,
[01:40:27.440 --> 01:40:29.280]   according to the defense department,
[01:40:29.280 --> 01:40:31.480]   a mega fire that will burn between
[01:40:31.480 --> 01:40:33.600]   100 and 300 square miles.
[01:40:33.600 --> 01:40:37.520]   So 1,000 weapons, 1,500 weapons,
[01:40:37.520 --> 01:40:39.440]   think about those mega fires.
[01:40:39.440 --> 01:40:42.800]   Everything is burning, forests, cities.
[01:40:42.800 --> 01:40:45.960]   Think about the pyrotoxins in all the cities,
[01:40:45.960 --> 01:40:48.080]   you know, high-rises burning.
[01:40:48.080 --> 01:40:52.180]   And all of this soot gets lofted into the air,
[01:40:52.180 --> 01:40:57.180]   according to Toon, some 300 billion pounds of soot.
[01:40:59.120 --> 01:41:00.400]   And what happens?
[01:41:00.400 --> 01:41:02.800]   It blocks out the sun.
[01:41:02.800 --> 01:41:06.520]   And without sun, we have nuclear winter.
[01:41:06.520 --> 01:41:11.520]   We have a situation whereby ice sheets form.
[01:41:11.520 --> 01:41:15.320]   You're talking about bodies of water
[01:41:15.320 --> 01:41:19.160]   in places like Iowa being frozen for 10 years.
[01:41:19.160 --> 01:41:20.840]   - So temperature drops.
[01:41:20.840 --> 01:41:23.680]   - Temperature plummets, right?
[01:41:23.680 --> 01:41:25.280]   And there are all kinds of papers
[01:41:25.280 --> 01:41:27.040]   that have been written about this,
[01:41:27.040 --> 01:41:31.140]   using modern, you know, systems.
[01:41:31.140 --> 01:41:33.600]   And the numbers vary,
[01:41:33.600 --> 01:41:37.720]   but the bottom line is agriculture fails.
[01:41:37.720 --> 01:41:40.360]   - Food obviously dies.
[01:41:40.360 --> 01:41:44.460]   So the agriculture system completely shuts down.
[01:41:44.460 --> 01:41:45.960]   So the food sources shut down.
[01:41:45.960 --> 01:41:49.080]   So there's no food, there's no sun,
[01:41:49.080 --> 01:41:51.400]   temperature drops completely, no electricity.
[01:41:51.400 --> 01:41:54.720]   - And we haven't even spoken of radiation poisoning,
[01:41:54.720 --> 01:41:58.560]   because, you know, the radiation poisoning kills many people
[01:41:58.560 --> 01:42:02.200]   in the aftermath of the nuclear exchange.
[01:42:02.200 --> 01:42:06.880]   But after the nuclear freeze ends, after nuclear winter,
[01:42:06.880 --> 01:42:08.780]   you know, after the sun starts to come back,
[01:42:08.780 --> 01:42:11.340]   let's say eight, nine, 10 years,
[01:42:11.340 --> 01:42:13.140]   now you have no ozone layer,
[01:42:13.140 --> 01:42:15.400]   or you have a severely depleted ozone layer.
[01:42:15.400 --> 01:42:18.680]   And so the sun's rays are now poisonous.
[01:42:18.680 --> 01:42:20.760]   So you have people living underground,
[01:42:20.760 --> 01:42:22.480]   and you have this great thawing.
[01:42:22.480 --> 01:42:26.040]   And with that great thawing comes pathogens and plague.
[01:42:26.040 --> 01:42:28.160]   And you have this, you know,
[01:42:28.160 --> 01:42:30.840]   system where the small bodied animals,
[01:42:30.840 --> 01:42:33.600]   the insects and whatnot, begin reproducing really fast.
[01:42:33.600 --> 01:42:36.000]   And the larger body animals, like you and me,
[01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.080]   begin to go extinct.
[01:42:38.080 --> 01:42:39.700]   Professor Toon said it to me this way.
[01:42:39.700 --> 01:42:42.920]   You know, he said, 66 million years ago,
[01:42:42.920 --> 01:42:46.540]   an asteroid hit earth, killed all the dinosaurs,
[01:42:46.540 --> 01:42:50.480]   and wiped out 70% of the species.
[01:42:50.480 --> 01:42:53.200]   A nuclear war would likely do the same.
[01:42:53.200 --> 01:42:55.480]   And so here we are talking about this
[01:42:55.480 --> 01:42:57.720]   because there is a difference.
[01:42:57.720 --> 01:42:59.920]   There's nothing you can do about an asteroid,
[01:42:59.920 --> 01:43:02.760]   but there is something you can do about a nuclear war.
[01:43:02.760 --> 01:43:05.480]   - Do you think it's possible
[01:43:05.480 --> 01:43:08.700]   that some humans will survive all of this?
[01:43:08.700 --> 01:43:11.880]   So if we look, I mean, how long would it be,
[01:43:11.880 --> 01:43:15.620]   would it be decades, would it be centuries
[01:43:15.620 --> 01:43:19.280]   before the, you start to have,
[01:43:19.280 --> 01:43:25.260]   earth starts to have the capacity to grow food again?
[01:43:25.260 --> 01:43:27.540]   - Carl Sagan talked about that in his,
[01:43:27.540 --> 01:43:28.820]   this amazing book that he wrote
[01:43:28.820 --> 01:43:32.540]   with two scientist colleagues called "The Cold and the Dark."
[01:43:32.540 --> 01:43:34.660]   And they have, there's a bunch of essays
[01:43:34.660 --> 01:43:36.180]   about exactly this, right?
[01:43:36.180 --> 01:43:38.840]   Like how, what would happen and how long would it take?
[01:43:38.840 --> 01:43:40.260]   It's really interesting.
[01:43:40.260 --> 01:43:41.860]   It's dated, you know, it's from the '80s,
[01:43:41.860 --> 01:43:43.820]   but man, is it shocking.
[01:43:43.820 --> 01:43:46.980]   And you think about that where, okay,
[01:43:46.980 --> 01:43:49.220]   so men return to sort of the worst,
[01:43:49.220 --> 01:43:51.940]   most base versions of themselves.
[01:43:51.940 --> 01:43:53.860]   Civilization is gone, right?
[01:43:53.860 --> 01:43:56.580]   Meaning, you know, civil society.
[01:43:56.580 --> 01:43:58.940]   There's no rule of law, it's just fend for yourself.
[01:43:58.940 --> 01:44:00.940]   There's, you know, people fighting over
[01:44:00.940 --> 01:44:02.820]   what little resources there are.
[01:44:02.820 --> 01:44:05.300]   Man returns to a hunter-gatherer state.
[01:44:05.300 --> 01:44:07.220]   And to really think about this idea,
[01:44:07.220 --> 01:44:11.260]   I looked at the oldest known archeological site
[01:44:11.260 --> 01:44:15.420]   in the world in Turkey, which is called Göbekli Tepe.
[01:44:15.420 --> 01:44:17.960]   And it's really fascinating to me
[01:44:17.960 --> 01:44:21.380]   because I interviewed one of the two archeologists
[01:44:21.380 --> 01:44:24.380]   who first found this site in the early '90s.
[01:44:24.380 --> 01:44:28.380]   And the lead archeologist was a guy named Klaus Schmidt,
[01:44:28.380 --> 01:44:30.700]   and Michael Morsh was the young graduate student
[01:44:30.700 --> 01:44:31.540]   who was with him.
[01:44:31.540 --> 01:44:36.540]   And Morsh's description of like coming upon this
[01:44:36.540 --> 01:44:39.320]   like rumored to be site,
[01:44:39.320 --> 01:44:41.660]   there was something called a wishing tree on the site,
[01:44:41.660 --> 01:44:44.180]   which I just found so human and perfect
[01:44:44.180 --> 01:44:45.900]   that it was this magical place.
[01:44:45.900 --> 01:44:48.940]   And it was locatable because there was a wishing tree
[01:44:48.940 --> 01:44:52.140]   on a hill and it's where people went to wish
[01:44:52.140 --> 01:44:54.300]   and to hope that their wishes came true.
[01:44:54.300 --> 01:44:57.260]   I mean, how human is that, right?
[01:44:57.260 --> 01:44:59.780]   And that is where beneath the wishing tree,
[01:44:59.780 --> 01:45:01.580]   kind of like in the shadow of the wishing tree,
[01:45:01.580 --> 01:45:03.560]   there was a tep, which is a hill.
[01:45:03.560 --> 01:45:08.900]   And beneath that, there is the oldest known civilization
[01:45:08.900 --> 01:45:09.740]   in the world.
[01:45:09.740 --> 01:45:12.560]   12,000 years ago, a group of hunter gatherers
[01:45:12.560 --> 01:45:14.600]   built this site.
[01:45:14.600 --> 01:45:16.520]   Why? We don't know.
[01:45:16.520 --> 01:45:18.960]   But I imagined when through Morsh's descriptions
[01:45:18.960 --> 01:45:21.880]   of coming upon, like, you know, he tripped on a rock,
[01:45:21.880 --> 01:45:23.320]   he told me, right?
[01:45:23.320 --> 01:45:26.360]   He tripped over a stone that turned out to be
[01:45:26.360 --> 01:45:31.360]   the top part of a 12,000 year old sculpted man,
[01:45:31.360 --> 01:45:35.280]   giant pillar, right?
[01:45:35.280 --> 01:45:37.560]   And he talked about coming upon that.
[01:45:37.560 --> 01:45:41.280]   And then no one knows really what Gobekli Tepe was for.
[01:45:41.280 --> 01:45:46.280]   And that makes my mind try and answer the question
[01:45:46.280 --> 01:45:48.800]   you asked me internally, right?
[01:45:48.800 --> 01:45:50.840]   Just as like a human who's here on earth
[01:45:50.840 --> 01:45:52.020]   for the amount of time I'm here.
[01:45:52.020 --> 01:45:55.780]   Like, if there were a nuclear war, what would it be like?
[01:45:55.780 --> 01:45:59.040]   What would it be like when someone in the future,
[01:45:59.040 --> 01:46:01.960]   would we become archeologists one day?
[01:46:01.960 --> 01:46:03.720]   Would civilization rebuild?
[01:46:03.720 --> 01:46:04.960]   Would we develop computers?
[01:46:04.960 --> 01:46:05.880]   Who knows?
[01:46:05.880 --> 01:46:06.920]   It's interesting to think about.
[01:46:06.920 --> 01:46:08.360]   I hope we never have to.
[01:46:08.360 --> 01:46:10.760]   - What would we remember about this time?
[01:46:10.760 --> 01:46:15.040]   It is terrifying to think that most of it
[01:46:15.040 --> 01:46:16.080]   will be forgotten.
[01:46:16.080 --> 01:46:19.720]   Everything we kind of assume will not be forgotten.
[01:46:19.720 --> 01:46:21.760]   We think maybe some of the technological developments
[01:46:21.760 --> 01:46:23.000]   will be forgotten.
[01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:26.600]   But we assume like some of history won't be forgotten.
[01:46:26.600 --> 01:46:30.920]   But realistically, especially the,
[01:46:30.920 --> 01:46:34.520]   us descending into primitive survival,
[01:46:34.520 --> 01:46:37.240]   probably everything since the industrial age
[01:46:37.240 --> 01:46:38.400]   will be forgotten.
[01:46:38.400 --> 01:46:40.120]   Like everything.
[01:46:40.120 --> 01:46:44.400]   Maybe some religious ideas will persist.
[01:46:44.400 --> 01:46:47.120]   Some stories and myths will persist.
[01:46:47.120 --> 01:46:49.960]   But like all the wisdom we've gathered,
[01:46:49.960 --> 01:46:54.560]   higher level sort of technological wisdom would be gone.
[01:46:54.560 --> 01:46:57.640]   That's terrifying to think about.
[01:46:57.640 --> 01:47:01.920]   And like, maybe even as you touch on
[01:47:02.840 --> 01:47:05.520]   the very fact of nuclear war might be forgotten.
[01:47:05.520 --> 01:47:09.840]   Like the lessons of nuclear war might be forgotten.
[01:47:09.840 --> 01:47:11.640]   That there are these weapons,
[01:47:11.640 --> 01:47:15.640]   sort of the obvious elephant in the room
[01:47:15.640 --> 01:47:18.800]   would be one of the things that's completely forgotten.
[01:47:18.800 --> 01:47:22.560]   Or become so vague in the recollection of humans
[01:47:22.560 --> 01:47:26.480]   that our understanding will change.
[01:47:26.480 --> 01:47:28.960]   It's almost as if a God descended on earth
[01:47:28.960 --> 01:47:30.040]   and destroyed everything.
[01:47:30.040 --> 01:47:31.920]   Maybe that's how it will persist.
[01:47:31.920 --> 01:47:34.360]   Sort of like mythological interpretation
[01:47:34.360 --> 01:47:36.880]   of what nuclear weapons are.
[01:47:36.880 --> 01:47:38.360]   That's terrifying.
[01:47:38.360 --> 01:47:40.280]   'Cause then it could repeat again.
[01:47:40.280 --> 01:47:45.680]   - But I think for me, the idea of the,
[01:47:45.680 --> 01:47:50.800]   what is buried becomes very interesting and very human.
[01:47:50.800 --> 01:47:54.480]   And in a strange way, optimistic and positive.
[01:47:54.480 --> 01:47:57.200]   Because if you can visualize that wishing tree,
[01:47:57.200 --> 01:47:59.280]   and I have a picture of it in the book
[01:47:59.280 --> 01:48:02.280]   from one of the archeologists who work on that, right?
[01:48:02.280 --> 01:48:04.840]   You think, what were they wishing?
[01:48:04.840 --> 01:48:07.080]   What were they wishing for, right?
[01:48:07.080 --> 01:48:08.560]   And then you think of your own self,
[01:48:08.560 --> 01:48:10.400]   what do I wish for in this world, right?
[01:48:10.400 --> 01:48:14.400]   Because, I do think all things
[01:48:14.400 --> 01:48:18.000]   come from what happens,
[01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:21.200]   metaphorically around the dinner table, right?
[01:48:21.200 --> 01:48:24.200]   Like what people put their eyes on
[01:48:24.200 --> 01:48:26.680]   becomes interesting and expands.
[01:48:26.680 --> 01:48:28.080]   What people talk about.
[01:48:28.480 --> 01:48:33.480]   And ultimately, when you think about the long arc of time
[01:48:33.480 --> 01:48:35.440]   in human civilization,
[01:48:35.440 --> 01:48:39.840]   it does kind of make you wanna communicate more
[01:48:39.840 --> 01:48:42.840]   with your enemies, with your adversaries.
[01:48:42.840 --> 01:48:45.800]   And I think about the quote,
[01:48:45.800 --> 01:48:47.680]   what Einstein is said to have said,
[01:48:47.680 --> 01:48:50.640]   which is that he was asked,
[01:48:50.640 --> 01:48:55.320]   what weapons World War III would be fought with?
[01:48:55.320 --> 01:48:58.880]   And he said, I don't know,
[01:48:58.880 --> 01:49:01.520]   but I know that World War IV
[01:49:01.520 --> 01:49:03.720]   will be fought with sticks and stones.
[01:49:03.720 --> 01:49:07.760]   - Let me ask you about the great filter.
[01:49:07.760 --> 01:49:12.560]   When you look up into our galaxy,
[01:49:12.560 --> 01:49:15.920]   into our universe, look up at the sky,
[01:49:15.920 --> 01:49:20.820]   do you think there's other alien civilizations
[01:49:20.820 --> 01:49:23.720]   that are contending with some similar questions?
[01:49:23.720 --> 01:49:28.360]   And perhaps the reason we have not definitively
[01:49:28.360 --> 01:49:32.000]   seen alien civilizations is because
[01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.880]   the others have failed to find a solution
[01:49:34.880 --> 01:49:37.940]   to this great filter, something like nuclear weapons.
[01:49:37.940 --> 01:49:43.600]   - I'm not sure, I'm gonna have to think about that question.
[01:49:43.600 --> 01:49:49.320]   But what does come to mind is an answer
[01:49:49.320 --> 01:49:52.560]   that was given to me similarly, right?
[01:49:52.560 --> 01:49:57.400]   By a man, by Ed Mitchell who went to the moon, right?
[01:49:57.400 --> 01:50:02.240]   And he was the sixth man to walk on the moon.
[01:50:02.240 --> 01:50:05.760]   And so his opinion, I think might count
[01:50:05.760 --> 01:50:07.680]   a little more than mine on that subject
[01:50:07.680 --> 01:50:12.640]   because his lens is so much greater, right?
[01:50:12.640 --> 01:50:17.640]   And Mitchell was vilified when he got back from the moon
[01:50:19.760 --> 01:50:22.500]   because it became known that he believed
[01:50:22.500 --> 01:50:25.640]   in things like extrasensory perception
[01:50:25.640 --> 01:50:31.520]   and this kind of mystical, metaphysical way
[01:50:31.520 --> 01:50:33.460]   of looking at the world.
[01:50:33.460 --> 01:50:36.120]   And he really suffered from that.
[01:50:36.120 --> 01:50:37.820]   I mean, he was ridiculed and he lost a lot
[01:50:37.820 --> 01:50:40.540]   of his career and his friends.
[01:50:40.540 --> 01:50:43.200]   But what he said to me in our interview
[01:50:43.200 --> 01:50:48.160]   about his trip home from the moon,
[01:50:49.600 --> 01:50:52.120]   answers that great filter question, I think,
[01:50:52.120 --> 01:50:55.080]   in a way I might wanna adopt, right?
[01:50:55.080 --> 01:51:00.080]   Which is this, that he said that as they were returning
[01:51:00.080 --> 01:51:06.240]   from the moon to earth, he looked down at the earth
[01:51:06.240 --> 01:51:09.440]   and I'm paraphrasing him, I write all this
[01:51:09.440 --> 01:51:11.300]   in "Phenomena," an earlier book.
[01:51:11.300 --> 01:51:15.200]   But the paraphrasing is that he looked down from the earth
[01:51:15.200 --> 01:51:19.220]   and it was 1971 and he thought about all the conflict
[01:51:19.220 --> 01:51:23.320]   going on down below, particularly the Vietnam War
[01:51:23.320 --> 01:51:25.440]   where many of his friends were.
[01:51:25.440 --> 01:51:30.440]   And then he looked behind him into the great vast galaxy
[01:51:30.440 --> 01:51:36.320]   and he had a moment, he says, that was like an epiphany,
[01:51:36.320 --> 01:51:38.020]   like not a near death experience,
[01:51:38.020 --> 01:51:40.220]   but a sort of near life experience, right?
[01:51:40.220 --> 01:51:45.120]   Where he believed that the human consciousness,
[01:51:45.120 --> 01:51:47.800]   which is where so much of this thoughtfulness
[01:51:47.800 --> 01:51:52.800]   about metaphysics and ESP perhaps come from,
[01:51:52.800 --> 01:51:59.560]   Mitchell's theory was that human consciousness,
[01:51:59.560 --> 01:52:03.240]   the way to understand it had something to do
[01:52:03.240 --> 01:52:06.720]   with realizing that man's inner life
[01:52:06.720 --> 01:52:10.000]   and man's outer life are deeply connected
[01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:14.720]   in the same way that man is connected to the galaxy.
[01:52:14.720 --> 01:52:17.160]   And he said it much more eloquently,
[01:52:17.160 --> 01:52:19.560]   but you kinda get the idea that,
[01:52:19.560 --> 01:52:23.880]   and I think it's why humans have always loved to look up,
[01:52:23.880 --> 01:52:28.120]   right, that there's more there.
[01:52:28.120 --> 01:52:29.320]   And it's a bit like the wish,
[01:52:29.320 --> 01:52:32.160]   it's like the big version of the wishing tree, you know?
[01:52:32.160 --> 01:52:35.040]   What do I wish for for myself?
[01:52:35.040 --> 01:52:40.040]   And what is maybe perhaps the realignment of thinking
[01:52:40.040 --> 01:52:42.840]   for those of us in search of happiness, right?
[01:52:42.840 --> 01:52:44.940]   And rather instead of war is,
[01:52:45.820 --> 01:52:50.820]   you know, what does it mean to have a conscience,
[01:52:50.820 --> 01:52:54.740]   to have consciousness?
[01:52:54.740 --> 01:52:56.640]   What does it mean to be a thinking person?
[01:52:56.640 --> 01:52:59.820]   What does it mean to be on this earth,
[01:52:59.820 --> 01:53:02.980]   to be born, to live, to die?
[01:53:02.980 --> 01:53:04.300]   And then there is legacy.
[01:53:04.300 --> 01:53:08.240]   And so all of those ideas are,
[01:53:08.240 --> 01:53:14.040]   I think, foster the kind of conversation
[01:53:14.040 --> 01:53:17.100]   that de-escalates conflict.
[01:53:17.100 --> 01:53:21.060]   - Yeah, so in some deep way,
[01:53:21.060 --> 01:53:22.500]   so the mysteries of what's out there
[01:53:22.500 --> 01:53:24.100]   when we look out to the stars
[01:53:24.100 --> 01:53:30.020]   are the same mysteries that we find
[01:53:30.020 --> 01:53:32.260]   in when trying to understand the human mind.
[01:53:32.260 --> 01:53:36.140]   And they're coupled in some way.
[01:53:36.140 --> 01:53:40.060]   For me, thinking about alien civilizations out there
[01:53:40.060 --> 01:53:42.220]   is really the same kind of question,
[01:53:43.460 --> 01:53:45.120]   which is, what are we?
[01:53:45.120 --> 01:53:46.020]   What is this?
[01:53:46.020 --> 01:53:48.000]   What are we doing here?
[01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:49.240]   How do we come here?
[01:53:49.240 --> 01:53:52.520]   Why does it seem to be so magical
[01:53:52.520 --> 01:53:55.000]   and beautiful and powerful?
[01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:56.520]   Now, where's it going?
[01:53:56.520 --> 01:53:59.880]   Because it feels like we're really,
[01:53:59.880 --> 01:54:04.640]   perhaps for the first time in history,
[01:54:04.640 --> 01:54:07.400]   are in a moment where we can destroy ourselves.
[01:54:07.400 --> 01:54:12.400]   And so naturally you ask, well, where's others like us?
[01:54:13.320 --> 01:54:17.840]   Is it perhaps, are we inevitably
[01:54:17.840 --> 01:54:21.580]   going to a place where we'll destroy ourselves?
[01:54:21.580 --> 01:54:24.380]   Is it basically inevitable that we destroy ourselves?
[01:54:24.380 --> 01:54:29.140]   We become too powerful and insufficiently wise
[01:54:29.140 --> 01:54:30.880]   to know what to do with that power.
[01:54:30.880 --> 01:54:38.340]   But like you said, probably the answers to that are in here.
[01:54:38.340 --> 01:54:40.000]   We don't need to look out there.
[01:54:41.040 --> 01:54:45.620]   - I'd love to ask you about the extrasensory perception.
[01:54:45.620 --> 01:54:48.360]   You've written, like you said, the book "Phenomena"
[01:54:48.360 --> 01:54:52.400]   on the secret history of the US government's investigations
[01:54:52.400 --> 01:54:56.520]   into extrasensory perception and psychokinesis.
[01:54:56.520 --> 01:55:00.160]   What are some of the more interesting extrasensory abilities
[01:55:00.160 --> 01:55:02.300]   that were explored by the government?
[01:55:02.300 --> 01:55:04.600]   And maybe just in general, ESP, what is it?
[01:55:04.600 --> 01:55:07.960]   What do you know of it?
[01:55:07.960 --> 01:55:09.720]   - The book was so interesting to report
[01:55:09.720 --> 01:55:12.300]   because I spend so much time dealing
[01:55:12.300 --> 01:55:16.440]   with like mechanized systems, machines, war machines.
[01:55:16.440 --> 01:55:19.640]   And yet the military and intelligence were
[01:55:19.640 --> 01:55:22.680]   and continue to be incredibly interested
[01:55:22.680 --> 01:55:25.420]   in the human mind, in consciousness.
[01:55:25.420 --> 01:55:28.840]   And so if one is called hard science,
[01:55:28.840 --> 01:55:31.680]   what we're talking about now is called squishy science.
[01:55:31.680 --> 01:55:34.560]   And it was really interesting to delve into that world.
[01:55:34.560 --> 01:55:39.560]   It just couldn't be farther from weapons and war.
[01:55:39.920 --> 01:55:40.880]   Or could it, right?
[01:55:40.880 --> 01:55:42.760]   And then I really began thinking,
[01:55:42.760 --> 01:55:46.680]   well, before science and technology,
[01:55:46.680 --> 01:55:51.680]   sort of the supernatural ruled the world.
[01:55:51.680 --> 01:55:55.560]   The Oracle of Delphi in Greece exists
[01:55:55.560 --> 01:56:00.560]   for the pre, before the common error rulers to go
[01:56:00.560 --> 01:56:05.000]   and beg to learn from the powers that be
[01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:06.800]   what was going to happen, right?
[01:56:06.800 --> 01:56:11.800]   So all ESP programs, I think,
[01:56:11.800 --> 01:56:14.360]   pull from that origin story, right?
[01:56:14.360 --> 01:56:16.960]   The leaders desire to know.
[01:56:16.960 --> 01:56:21.920]   And so I really found it amazing
[01:56:21.920 --> 01:56:24.240]   that many people think these systems
[01:56:24.240 --> 01:56:26.400]   or rather these programs started in the '70s.
[01:56:26.400 --> 01:56:31.320]   I learned they actually began right after World War II.
[01:56:31.320 --> 01:56:36.140]   And that was because, and here, in my reporting,
[01:56:36.140 --> 01:56:38.680]   I find all things sort of always circle back
[01:56:38.680 --> 01:56:40.560]   to the Third Reich, to the Nazis.
[01:56:40.560 --> 01:56:45.000]   The Nazis had a massive occult program,
[01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:50.000]   an ESP program, psychokinesis program, astrology.
[01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:53.760]   Both Hitler and Himmler were deeply interested
[01:56:53.760 --> 01:56:56.360]   in these occult concepts.
[01:56:56.360 --> 01:57:00.120]   And after, I learned from records at the National Archives
[01:57:00.120 --> 01:57:03.240]   that after the war, you know,
[01:57:04.400 --> 01:57:06.660]   half of everything went to the Soviet Union.
[01:57:06.660 --> 01:57:08.760]   And I'm talking about the trove of Nazi documents
[01:57:08.760 --> 01:57:11.240]   from which the superpowers were then going to learn
[01:57:11.240 --> 01:57:12.780]   to fight future wars.
[01:57:12.780 --> 01:57:14.640]   And half of them went to the United States.
[01:57:14.640 --> 01:57:19.640]   And so we got this trove of documents about all of this
[01:57:19.640 --> 01:57:21.740]   and the Soviets got the other.
[01:57:21.740 --> 01:57:24.520]   And so it set off a kind of psychic arms race,
[01:57:24.520 --> 01:57:28.460]   which in a weird way paralleled the nuclear arms race,
[01:57:28.460 --> 01:57:30.140]   which we've been talking about,
[01:57:30.140 --> 01:57:32.860]   in as much that it led one side
[01:57:32.860 --> 01:57:36.300]   to constantly wonder what the other side had.
[01:57:36.300 --> 01:57:41.440]   Have they been able to find anything interesting
[01:57:41.440 --> 01:57:46.080]   in this squishy science analysis
[01:57:46.080 --> 01:57:47.920]   of trying to see how the human mind
[01:57:47.920 --> 01:57:49.220]   could be used as a weapon?
[01:57:49.220 --> 01:57:53.480]   The CIA most definitely believed
[01:57:53.480 --> 01:57:55.540]   from my reading of the documents
[01:57:55.540 --> 01:58:00.120]   that there was something very legit, shall we say,
[01:58:00.120 --> 01:58:01.240]   about ESP.
[01:58:01.240 --> 01:58:04.220]   It couldn't, it was uncontrollable, it was unreliable,
[01:58:04.220 --> 01:58:05.800]   but nonetheless it existed.
[01:58:05.800 --> 01:58:08.780]   And being the intelligence agency that they are,
[01:58:08.780 --> 01:58:11.580]   they cared less about why it worked.
[01:58:11.580 --> 01:58:14.180]   They just wanted to know how they could use it.
[01:58:14.180 --> 01:58:17.180]   And then it got into all kinds of elements
[01:58:17.180 --> 01:58:20.360]   of placebo effect and this, you know.
[01:58:20.360 --> 01:58:22.800]   And, you know, when the military stepped in
[01:58:22.800 --> 01:58:24.900]   and got involved in the programs,
[01:58:24.900 --> 01:58:27.880]   that was a complete disaster in my opinion,
[01:58:27.880 --> 01:58:30.320]   because the military needs to control everything
[01:58:30.320 --> 01:58:32.700]   in a mechanized, systematic way.
[01:58:32.700 --> 01:58:34.500]   And so they started, for example,
[01:58:34.500 --> 01:58:36.620]   teaching people to be psychic,
[01:58:36.620 --> 01:58:39.700]   which is a really, really, really bad idea.
[01:58:39.700 --> 01:58:43.540]   I mean, and, you know,
[01:58:43.540 --> 01:58:45.260]   flash forward to where we are today,
[01:58:45.260 --> 01:58:46.720]   these programs still exist.
[01:58:46.720 --> 01:58:50.860]   There's a Navy program, which is working on,
[01:58:50.860 --> 01:58:52.580]   based on a lot of data that came back
[01:58:52.580 --> 01:58:56.700]   from the war on terror with certain soldiers,
[01:58:56.700 --> 01:59:00.400]   knowing, you know, wait, don't walk down that path.
[01:59:00.400 --> 01:59:02.320]   There is an IED there.
[01:59:02.320 --> 01:59:04.000]   And they call this the spidey sense.
[01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:07.400]   And they actually have a program that works from this.
[01:59:07.400 --> 01:59:09.160]   So these things never go away.
[01:59:09.160 --> 01:59:12.040]   They kind of circle around in terms of, you know,
[01:59:12.040 --> 01:59:14.440]   being made fun of and then taken seriously
[01:59:14.440 --> 01:59:17.000]   and a little of this and of that.
[01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:19.640]   My biggest takeaway from writing that book
[01:59:19.640 --> 01:59:23.560]   was a quote that I referenced in the beginning,
[01:59:23.560 --> 01:59:25.600]   which is the Thomas theorem.
[01:59:25.600 --> 01:59:30.600]   And it says, "If men define situations as real,
[01:59:30.600 --> 01:59:33.220]   "they are real in their consequences."
[01:59:33.220 --> 01:59:35.200]   - Yeah.
[01:59:35.200 --> 01:59:37.700]   I mean, placebo, as you've mentioned,
[01:59:37.700 --> 01:59:39.800]   is a fascinating concept.
[01:59:39.800 --> 01:59:41.760]   By the way, a short plug.
[01:59:41.760 --> 01:59:42.840]   I started listening to it.
[01:59:42.840 --> 01:59:46.240]   Andrew Huberman just released a podcast
[01:59:46.240 --> 01:59:49.200]   on placebo, the placebo effect.
[01:59:49.200 --> 01:59:51.840]   - Does he know the origin story of placebo?
[01:59:51.840 --> 01:59:52.720]   We'll have to ask him.
[01:59:52.720 --> 01:59:53.560]   - We'll have to ask him, yeah.
[01:59:53.560 --> 01:59:54.380]   - But are you ready for this?
[01:59:54.380 --> 01:59:55.220]   - Yes.
[01:59:55.220 --> 01:59:58.040]   - For the CIA, okay?
[01:59:58.040 --> 02:00:01.040]   And not only that, I can tell you that Dr. Henry Beecher,
[02:00:01.040 --> 02:00:05.300]   Harvard, I think he was also at MIT for a bit,
[02:00:05.300 --> 02:00:08.480]   he came up with that term.
[02:00:08.480 --> 02:00:10.800]   And you might even say for the CIA.
[02:00:10.800 --> 02:00:14.920]   - Does that trouble you that so much of this
[02:00:14.920 --> 02:00:17.400]   is coming from the CIA first?
[02:00:17.400 --> 02:00:19.120]   - You mean the placebo concept or the--
[02:00:19.120 --> 02:00:21.480]   - The placebo concept, but a lot of the sort of
[02:00:22.940 --> 02:00:24.740]   scientific investigations?
[02:00:24.740 --> 02:00:28.980]   - Listen, I have such mixed feelings about the CIA
[02:00:28.980 --> 02:00:29.820]   as one should.
[02:00:29.820 --> 02:00:31.220]   I think you should have mixed feelings
[02:00:31.220 --> 02:00:33.500]   about anything that you cover as a reporter
[02:00:33.500 --> 02:00:35.420]   or as a human, because,
[02:00:35.420 --> 02:00:39.540]   and maybe change that from mixed to conflicting, right?
[02:00:39.540 --> 02:00:42.820]   Because there are really positive elements
[02:00:42.820 --> 02:00:46.060]   of every organization within the federal government.
[02:00:46.060 --> 02:00:49.420]   I mean, my first learning about the CIA
[02:00:49.420 --> 02:00:53.160]   came from the work I did on the Area 51 book
[02:00:53.160 --> 02:00:55.600]   about their aerial reconnaissance programs,
[02:00:55.600 --> 02:00:59.320]   which were set up, again, to prevent World War III, right?
[02:00:59.320 --> 02:01:00.320]   Nuclear World War III.
[02:01:00.320 --> 02:01:03.600]   It was this idea that information was king.
[02:01:03.600 --> 02:01:07.440]   The U-2 spy plane was developed out at Area 51,
[02:01:07.440 --> 02:01:10.640]   and I interviewed Hervey Stockman,
[02:01:10.640 --> 02:01:14.520]   the first man to fly over the Soviet Union in a U-2,
[02:01:14.520 --> 02:01:18.480]   gathered all this intelligence, prevented wars.
[02:01:18.480 --> 02:01:22.900]   Later, I wrote a book about the CIA's paramilitary,
[02:01:22.900 --> 02:01:24.300]   Surprise, Kill, Vanish.
[02:01:24.300 --> 02:01:26.140]   So like, just when I was thinking,
[02:01:26.140 --> 02:01:29.380]   wow, the CIA is doing all this amazing, you know,
[02:01:29.380 --> 02:01:31.980]   non-kinetic activity with aerial reconnaissance,
[02:01:31.980 --> 02:01:35.180]   then you learn about their kill programs,
[02:01:35.180 --> 02:01:38.460]   and that's a whole different set of issues.
[02:01:38.460 --> 02:01:40.060]   - It turns out, as you write in that book,
[02:01:40.060 --> 02:01:44.940]   that the CIA assassinates people sometimes,
[02:01:44.940 --> 02:01:46.780]   and we'll talk about it.
[02:01:46.780 --> 02:01:51.080]   But anyway, like you said, conflicting feelings.
[02:01:51.080 --> 02:01:54.160]   - I mean, I work with sources to report my books,
[02:01:54.160 --> 02:01:58.120]   and so put yourself in my shoes, right?
[02:01:58.120 --> 02:02:03.120]   I interview for dozens or hundreds of hours
[02:02:03.120 --> 02:02:04.680]   my primary sources.
[02:02:04.680 --> 02:02:08.540]   In the case of the Surprise, Kill, Vanish book,
[02:02:08.540 --> 02:02:10.200]   I traveled with Billy Waugh,
[02:02:10.200 --> 02:02:13.000]   the longest-serving CIA operator,
[02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:15.000]   back to the scene of the crime.
[02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:16.800]   You know, back to the battle, we went to Hanoi,
[02:02:16.800 --> 02:02:18.080]   we went to Havana.
[02:02:18.080 --> 02:02:22.020]   And you really get to know someone,
[02:02:22.020 --> 02:02:23.760]   and that's when I say conflicting.
[02:02:23.760 --> 02:02:28.760]   You know, I work with sources on a real trust basis, right?
[02:02:28.760 --> 02:02:30.600]   And sometimes people will tell me things.
[02:02:30.600 --> 02:02:32.840]   They'll say, "Annie, this is off the record.
[02:02:32.840 --> 02:02:37.260]   "This is for you to know about me on deep background
[02:02:37.260 --> 02:02:40.560]   "because I want you to know who I am."
[02:02:40.560 --> 02:02:41.760]   And that's powerful.
[02:02:41.760 --> 02:02:44.040]   And a lot of times, it's personal, right?
[02:02:44.040 --> 02:02:44.960]   It's personal.
[02:02:44.960 --> 02:02:46.560]   It's about their personal life.
[02:02:46.560 --> 02:02:48.760]   And they don't want that,
[02:02:48.760 --> 02:02:51.800]   and it isn't apropos to what I'm writing about,
[02:02:51.800 --> 02:02:52.920]   but I need to know that.
[02:02:52.920 --> 02:02:56.740]   And that's where it gets conflicted, in a good way,
[02:02:56.740 --> 02:03:00.240]   because you realize where we're all such creatures
[02:03:00.240 --> 02:03:03.440]   of our personal lives, right?
[02:03:03.440 --> 02:03:06.240]   So you have a professional life
[02:03:06.240 --> 02:03:09.460]   where your national security are in your hands.
[02:03:09.460 --> 02:03:11.560]   I don't know what that is like.
[02:03:11.560 --> 02:03:13.640]   - I wonder if you could just speak to that.
[02:03:13.640 --> 02:03:16.240]   You've interviewed so many powerful people,
[02:03:16.240 --> 02:03:18.360]   so many fascinating people.
[02:03:18.360 --> 02:03:23.360]   And as you've spoken about, trust is fundamental to that.
[02:03:23.360 --> 02:03:27.840]   So they open up and really show you into their world.
[02:03:27.840 --> 02:03:30.840]   What does it take to do that?
[02:03:30.840 --> 02:03:36.100]   - I think willingness.
[02:03:36.100 --> 02:03:39.160]   We were talking about trust earlier.
[02:03:39.160 --> 02:03:42.880]   Like, you have to trust that there's, I have to trust
[02:03:42.880 --> 02:03:44.400]   that there's a reason I find myself
[02:03:44.400 --> 02:03:46.600]   in a certain situation, right?
[02:03:46.600 --> 02:03:51.560]   Otherwise, it would just be a constant doubt paradox, right?
[02:03:51.560 --> 02:03:52.380]   Why am I here?
[02:03:52.380 --> 02:03:53.220]   What am I doing?
[02:03:53.220 --> 02:03:59.160]   And so I trust that I'm going to learn something of value.
[02:03:59.160 --> 02:04:03.720]   And so I'm willing to listen.
[02:04:03.720 --> 02:04:05.560]   I really am willing to listen, right?
[02:04:05.560 --> 02:04:11.600]   Because, and so far, it's always proven,
[02:04:12.440 --> 02:04:14.960]   you know, the expectations I might have
[02:04:14.960 --> 02:04:18.680]   going into something are dwarfed by the outcome
[02:04:18.680 --> 02:04:21.080]   because people are so interesting.
[02:04:21.080 --> 02:04:24.080]   And because the people that I interview,
[02:04:24.080 --> 02:04:25.880]   because I write about war and weapons
[02:04:25.880 --> 02:04:28.240]   and national security and government secrets,
[02:04:28.240 --> 02:04:31.600]   and the people I interview are at the heart of all of this,
[02:04:31.600 --> 02:04:34.640]   I mean, they are really capable people,
[02:04:34.640 --> 02:04:38.980]   intellectually brilliant, physically capable.
[02:04:38.980 --> 02:04:43.220]   They go so far out on the limb to do their jobs.
[02:04:43.220 --> 02:04:44.860]   And by the way, the reason they're talking to me
[02:04:44.860 --> 02:04:46.980]   is 'cause they're still alive.
[02:04:46.980 --> 02:04:49.380]   And so many of their colleagues are dead.
[02:04:49.380 --> 02:04:54.260]   So it gives them also a wisdom about, you know, life,
[02:04:54.260 --> 02:04:59.260]   about sacrifice, not in cliched sort of nationalistic,
[02:04:59.260 --> 02:05:01.700]   jingoistic terms whatsoever.
[02:05:01.700 --> 02:05:06.700]   I'm talking like real, real, what is their real truth?
[02:05:07.780 --> 02:05:10.420]   You know, when I went to Vietnam with Billy Wah,
[02:05:10.420 --> 02:05:14.660]   I mean, so much of it was, the details are just,
[02:05:14.660 --> 02:05:16.360]   you know, every detail, right?
[02:05:16.360 --> 02:05:21.300]   I mean, starting with the fact that he showed up at my house
[02:05:21.300 --> 02:05:26.060]   with a giant suitcase and a bunch of clothes,
[02:05:26.060 --> 02:05:30.980]   dry cleaning, pressed clothes in plastic hangers,
[02:05:30.980 --> 02:05:31.800]   carrying them.
[02:05:31.800 --> 02:05:34.580]   I'm like, Billy, we're going to Vietnam
[02:05:34.580 --> 02:05:36.660]   and we're going back into the jungle
[02:05:36.660 --> 02:05:38.620]   to find the Oscar eight battle site.
[02:05:38.620 --> 02:05:42.620]   Like, what are you carrying, right?
[02:05:42.620 --> 02:05:43.820]   And he got really mad at me,
[02:05:43.820 --> 02:05:45.540]   did not like anyone correcting him.
[02:05:45.540 --> 02:05:47.820]   And I got my husband on the job, like, Kevin,
[02:05:47.820 --> 02:05:48.980]   you got to sort this out, right?
[02:05:48.980 --> 02:05:51.300]   And what transpired was that Billy Wah
[02:05:51.300 --> 02:05:56.260]   had never taken a trip for personal reasons.
[02:05:56.260 --> 02:05:59.060]   He operated, I think, in 62 countries
[02:05:59.060 --> 02:06:01.220]   every single time for the CIA.
[02:06:01.220 --> 02:06:02.900]   And it would go like this, Billy,
[02:06:02.900 --> 02:06:05.020]   go to there and get to there, right?
[02:06:05.020 --> 02:06:05.860]   And that's what he would do.
[02:06:05.860 --> 02:06:09.380]   When he arrived, whatever he needed, he would just get,
[02:06:09.380 --> 02:06:11.380]   you know, it's not a fashion trip, right?
[02:06:11.380 --> 02:06:14.780]   So he had no idea how to pack for an overseas trip.
[02:06:14.780 --> 02:06:16.260]   This was like, oh my God,
[02:06:16.260 --> 02:06:17.880]   how can you not have the hugest smile
[02:06:17.880 --> 02:06:19.260]   on your face going into this?
[02:06:19.260 --> 02:06:20.980]   I'm with a guy who's 89 years old.
[02:06:20.980 --> 02:06:23.020]   He's got eight bullet, you know,
[02:06:23.020 --> 02:06:27.420]   he's had eight Purple Hearts from Vietnam, right?
[02:06:27.420 --> 02:06:30.100]   I mean, he operated against Osama bin Laden
[02:06:30.100 --> 02:06:32.180]   10 years before 9/11.
[02:06:32.180 --> 02:06:35.480]   He went after bin Laden in Afghanistan when he was 72.
[02:06:35.480 --> 02:06:38.620]   And he went after Qaddafi during the Arab Spring
[02:06:38.620 --> 02:06:39.860]   when he was 82.
[02:06:39.860 --> 02:06:42.500]   And now here he is with me going to Hanoi, you know?
[02:06:42.500 --> 02:06:46.340]   The details, those human details.
[02:06:46.340 --> 02:06:49.500]   But my husband repacked his bag
[02:06:49.500 --> 02:06:51.900]   and, you know, like got him a proper suitcase
[02:06:51.900 --> 02:06:54.340]   that was carryable and small and didn't have the hangers,
[02:06:54.340 --> 02:06:56.880]   you know, he wasn't trailing the hangers.
[02:06:56.880 --> 02:07:01.880]   But it was the trip home in the taxi
[02:07:01.880 --> 02:07:03.740]   that I got at this really big reveal.
[02:07:03.960 --> 02:07:08.000]   And Billy reached into that small suitcase
[02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:09.780]   my husband had given him
[02:07:09.780 --> 02:07:13.560]   and pulled out a rolled up American flag.
[02:07:13.560 --> 02:07:17.120]   And he had taken this flag,
[02:07:17.120 --> 02:07:19.160]   'cause I had tried to help him pack and he wouldn't let me.
[02:07:19.160 --> 02:07:21.060]   And I just thought it was like an old guy being stubborn,
[02:07:21.060 --> 02:07:22.860]   but he didn't want me to see
[02:07:22.860 --> 02:07:24.980]   that he was bringing an American flag to Vietnam,
[02:07:24.980 --> 02:07:26.200]   which is not legal.
[02:07:26.200 --> 02:07:29.420]   And he wanted to bring that flag
[02:07:29.420 --> 02:07:31.940]   and take it around everywhere with him,
[02:07:31.940 --> 02:07:33.240]   as he explained to me later,
[02:07:33.240 --> 02:07:37.160]   to honor all of his friends who died there 50 years ago.
[02:07:37.160 --> 02:07:39.600]   And then when the trip was finished,
[02:07:39.600 --> 02:07:42.480]   he gave me that flag and it's in my office.
[02:07:42.480 --> 02:07:45.160]   And that's the kind of relationship
[02:07:45.160 --> 02:07:47.800]   that you can develop with people as a reporter,
[02:07:47.800 --> 02:07:49.960]   if you're willing to go the extra mile with them,
[02:07:49.960 --> 02:07:53.120]   to trust them, that they'll tell you things of value.
[02:07:53.120 --> 02:07:56.680]   And to me, something like that is as a value,
[02:07:56.680 --> 02:07:59.440]   as any, you know, secret mission,
[02:07:59.440 --> 02:08:01.540]   I'm able to get declassified,
[02:08:01.540 --> 02:08:03.660]   because we are a nation of people.
[02:08:03.660 --> 02:08:05.960]   - And probably there's a bunch of human details
[02:08:05.960 --> 02:08:08.460]   that you can't possibly express in words,
[02:08:08.460 --> 02:08:11.720]   things left unspoken, but you saw in the silence,
[02:08:11.720 --> 02:08:14.020]   exchange between the two of you, the sadness,
[02:08:14.020 --> 02:08:18.240]   maybe you could see in his face,
[02:08:18.240 --> 02:08:23.160]   looking back at memories of the people he's lost,
[02:08:23.160 --> 02:08:24.160]   all that kind of stuff.
[02:08:24.160 --> 02:08:25.420]   - All that kind of stuff.
[02:08:25.420 --> 02:08:29.180]   - You mentioned you wrote a book on Area 51.
[02:08:30.180 --> 02:08:32.620]   For people who don't know,
[02:08:32.620 --> 02:08:37.580]   you've written a lot about security,
[02:08:37.580 --> 02:08:42.100]   the military, secrets, all this kind of stuff.
[02:08:42.100 --> 02:08:46.900]   So Area 51 is one of the legendary centers
[02:08:46.900 --> 02:08:50.020]   of all of these kinds of topics.
[02:08:50.020 --> 02:08:54.400]   So high level first is, what is Area 51?
[02:08:54.400 --> 02:08:58.980]   As you understand it, as you've written about,
[02:08:58.980 --> 02:09:00.700]   the lore and the reality.
[02:09:00.700 --> 02:09:03.900]   - I think everybody wants to know about Area 51,
[02:09:03.900 --> 02:09:07.120]   because it kind of, it's like this American enigma,
[02:09:07.120 --> 02:09:09.060]   you know, it's like to some people,
[02:09:09.060 --> 02:09:12.380]   it's the Shangri-La of, you know,
[02:09:12.380 --> 02:09:14.940]   test bed aerospace programs, right?
[02:09:14.940 --> 02:09:18.020]   And to others, it's the place of captured aliens, right?
[02:09:18.020 --> 02:09:19.860]   And everything in between.
[02:09:19.860 --> 02:09:23.880]   I had the great fortune of interviewing 75 people
[02:09:23.880 --> 02:09:25.540]   who lived and worked at that base
[02:09:25.540 --> 02:09:28.160]   for extended periods of time,
[02:09:28.160 --> 02:09:30.780]   mostly leading up to the '90s,
[02:09:30.780 --> 02:09:32.780]   because everything since then is classified, right?
[02:09:32.780 --> 02:09:35.460]   So things get declassified after decades,
[02:09:35.460 --> 02:09:36.660]   not everything, but some,
[02:09:36.660 --> 02:09:39.620]   and that allows you to piece together stories.
[02:09:39.620 --> 02:09:42.220]   - So you've talked to a lot of people that work there.
[02:09:42.220 --> 02:09:45.660]   What can you describe as the sort of the history
[02:09:45.660 --> 02:09:47.980]   of technological development that went on there?
[02:09:47.980 --> 02:09:50.180]   - I mean, Area 51 is huge, by the way.
[02:09:50.180 --> 02:09:51.620]   And it's, you know, it's a secret,
[02:09:51.620 --> 02:09:54.060]   it's a top secret military facility
[02:09:54.060 --> 02:09:57.060]   inside a top secret military facility,
[02:09:57.060 --> 02:10:00.040]   inside the Nevada Test and Training Range,
[02:10:00.040 --> 02:10:03.960]   which is this massive, not secret facility, right?
[02:10:03.960 --> 02:10:05.900]   So you're just talking about layers,
[02:10:05.900 --> 02:10:08.360]   talk about peeling the onion in reverse.
[02:10:08.360 --> 02:10:12.140]   And it began as a place to test the U-2 spy plane.
[02:10:12.140 --> 02:10:17.720]   And literally the CIA set up shop there
[02:10:17.720 --> 02:10:22.720]   to build this plane away from the public eye.
[02:10:24.320 --> 02:10:28.640]   And then that led to another espionage platform
[02:10:28.640 --> 02:10:30.920]   called the A-12 Oxcart, which is, you know,
[02:10:30.920 --> 02:10:35.500]   anyone who's seen the X-Men movies knows about the SR-71.
[02:10:35.500 --> 02:10:37.520]   But, and that's a two-seater, right?
[02:10:37.520 --> 02:10:40.000]   And before that, there was the A-12 Oxcart.
[02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:43.880]   And that was the CIA's stealth Mach 3 spy plane.
[02:10:43.880 --> 02:10:46.380]   You know, think about that in the early 1960s.
[02:10:46.380 --> 02:10:48.220]   It's astonishing.
[02:10:48.220 --> 02:10:50.320]   And I interviewed the pilots who flew it.
[02:10:50.320 --> 02:10:52.420]   - What did they say about it?
[02:10:52.420 --> 02:10:54.020]   - Oh my God.
[02:10:54.020 --> 02:10:58.420]   I mean, you know, look, I describe in detail in Area 51,
[02:10:58.420 --> 02:11:01.860]   but also the amazing thing, Lex, about that was that,
[02:11:01.860 --> 02:11:03.820]   and you know, I just look back on that with such fondness.
[02:11:03.820 --> 02:11:07.220]   This is like in 2009 when I was reporting that.
[02:11:07.220 --> 02:11:10.220]   And all, many of the guys who were in their 80s and 90s
[02:11:10.220 --> 02:11:14.180]   were World War II heroes, like serious World War II heroes,
[02:11:14.180 --> 02:11:17.300]   like Colonel Slater, who was the commander of Area 51.
[02:11:17.300 --> 02:11:20.420]   He flew the U-2 on the missions
[02:11:20.420 --> 02:11:25.420]   called the Black Cat missions over China in the early 1960s
[02:11:25.420 --> 02:11:28.780]   to see about their Lop Nur nuclear facility, right?
[02:11:28.780 --> 02:11:31.340]   So all of these things tie in
[02:11:31.340 --> 02:11:35.280]   when you're reporting on military and intelligence programs.
[02:11:35.280 --> 02:11:38.740]   But these guys had been World War II heroes,
[02:11:38.740 --> 02:11:43.300]   and then were given this cushy job out at Area 51, you know?
[02:11:43.300 --> 02:11:45.020]   And it just came with all these perks.
[02:11:45.020 --> 02:11:48.580]   Colonel Slater told me this one perk I just love so much.
[02:11:48.580 --> 02:11:52.480]   They all had a hankering for lobster one day, right?
[02:11:52.480 --> 02:11:54.940]   And here they are in the middle of the desert in Nevada,
[02:11:54.940 --> 02:11:57.940]   and they have these really fast planes, you know?
[02:11:57.940 --> 02:12:00.540]   And they literally called, like they arranged,
[02:12:00.540 --> 02:12:02.860]   they didn't take the ox cart out for that one,
[02:12:02.860 --> 02:12:06.740]   but they got some lobsters from Massachusetts,
[02:12:06.740 --> 02:12:08.900]   like delivered to them in like record time.
[02:12:08.900 --> 02:12:11.240]   They didn't even need to put them on ice, you know?
[02:12:11.240 --> 02:12:13.620]   And again, those are these details where you're like,
[02:12:13.620 --> 02:12:17.060]   thank God, at least for me, thank God I got these details.
[02:12:17.060 --> 02:12:19.100]   These guys are all past now.
[02:12:19.100 --> 02:12:20.620]   - Yeah.
[02:12:20.620 --> 02:12:22.300]   So there's a lot of incredible
[02:12:22.300 --> 02:12:24.160]   technological work going on there.
[02:12:24.160 --> 02:12:27.280]   So the legend, the lore, like you said, aliens.
[02:12:27.280 --> 02:12:32.860]   Were there ever aliens in Area 51, as you understand it?
[02:12:32.860 --> 02:12:36.980]   - So I've interviewed hundreds of people.
[02:12:36.980 --> 02:12:38.260]   - That worked there.
[02:12:38.260 --> 02:12:39.620]   - Well, not just at Area 51,
[02:12:39.620 --> 02:12:41.500]   but in all the different national security
[02:12:41.500 --> 02:12:44.580]   and military intelligence and intelligence programs.
[02:12:44.580 --> 02:12:49.540]   And I personally have no reason to believe
[02:12:49.540 --> 02:12:52.300]   that aliens have ever visited Earth.
[02:12:52.300 --> 02:12:53.760]   That's just me personally.
[02:12:53.760 --> 02:12:55.140]   - Visited Earth, period.
[02:12:55.140 --> 02:13:00.140]   - I have no information that causes me to conclude
[02:13:00.140 --> 02:13:01.140]   that's the case.
[02:13:01.140 --> 02:13:05.460]   Now, with that said, many of the primary players
[02:13:05.460 --> 02:13:08.560]   in this present day, you know,
[02:13:08.560 --> 02:13:11.400]   there are aliens among us narrative,
[02:13:11.400 --> 02:13:13.380]   are in my phenomena book.
[02:13:13.380 --> 02:13:16.140]   I continue to communicate with a lot of these people.
[02:13:16.140 --> 02:13:18.740]   I'm talking about astrophysicists
[02:13:18.740 --> 02:13:23.380]   who fundamentally believe that there are aliens among us.
[02:13:23.380 --> 02:13:24.820]   Right?
[02:13:24.820 --> 02:13:28.080]   So we beg to differ on that issue.
[02:13:28.080 --> 02:13:32.660]   - But for you, in terms of doing research
[02:13:32.660 --> 02:13:38.780]   on government agencies that do top secret military work,
[02:13:40.500 --> 02:13:43.380]   I mean, they would know, right?
[02:13:43.380 --> 02:13:46.520]   So you have interviewed a lot of people that have,
[02:13:46.520 --> 02:13:48.620]   at every layer of the onion,
[02:13:48.620 --> 02:13:56.780]   you don't see evidence or a reason to believe
[02:13:56.780 --> 02:14:00.540]   that there was ever aliens or UFOs captured
[02:14:00.540 --> 02:14:02.020]   from out of this world.
[02:14:02.020 --> 02:14:02.980]   - That is correct.
[02:14:02.980 --> 02:14:05.500]   And even perhaps more important,
[02:14:05.500 --> 02:14:07.620]   and perhaps this colors my thinking,
[02:14:07.620 --> 02:14:12.100]   but I am uniquely familiar with disinformation programs
[02:14:12.100 --> 02:14:14.980]   put forth by the CIA or the agency,
[02:14:14.980 --> 02:14:17.340]   as it's called by insiders, right?
[02:14:17.340 --> 02:14:21.080]   And I've learned firsthand about these programs
[02:14:21.080 --> 02:14:23.580]   or rather learned from firsthand participants
[02:14:23.580 --> 02:14:26.360]   in strategic deception campaigns
[02:14:26.360 --> 02:14:30.380]   that the CIA has engaged in beginning with area 51.
[02:14:30.380 --> 02:14:33.740]   You know, the idea that all these reports
[02:14:34.620 --> 02:14:39.620]   of this U2 spy plane, this giant long wind,
[02:14:39.620 --> 02:14:43.760]   long winged aircraft flying 70,000 feet up,
[02:14:43.760 --> 02:14:46.500]   people didn't think airplanes could fly that high.
[02:14:46.500 --> 02:14:48.620]   And it's, you know, the sun shining off of it,
[02:14:48.620 --> 02:14:51.380]   it looked like a UFO and all the reports coming in.
[02:14:51.380 --> 02:14:56.380]   And the CIA opened up a UFO disinformation campaign office
[02:14:56.380 --> 02:15:01.220]   headed by a guy named Toto Otorenko,
[02:15:01.220 --> 02:15:03.400]   you know, specifically for this reason.
[02:15:03.400 --> 02:15:06.140]   Now, does that mean that every UFO sighting
[02:15:06.140 --> 02:15:08.200]   in the world has been a U2?
[02:15:08.200 --> 02:15:13.200]   No, but I come from it, from that lane of thinking.
[02:15:13.200 --> 02:15:17.540]   And there are so many strategic deception campaigns.
[02:15:17.540 --> 02:15:19.160]   And as I look over the decades
[02:15:19.160 --> 02:15:21.540]   of how these same UFO stories,
[02:15:21.540 --> 02:15:24.300]   and again, this is just my opinion based on my reporting,
[02:15:24.300 --> 02:15:27.500]   this narrative that keeps reoccurring,
[02:15:27.500 --> 02:15:30.900]   it seems to me like a very large catch-all
[02:15:30.900 --> 02:15:34.320]   to keep the public's attention on that, not on that.
[02:15:34.320 --> 02:15:36.960]   - So, to you,
[02:15:36.960 --> 02:15:41.560]   like sexy stories like UFOs
[02:15:41.560 --> 02:15:45.720]   are going to be leveraged by the CIA
[02:15:45.720 --> 02:15:47.360]   for strategic deception?
[02:15:47.360 --> 02:15:48.200]   - A hundred percent.
[02:15:48.200 --> 02:15:50.120]   I mean, Google Paul Benowitz.
[02:15:50.120 --> 02:15:52.840]   I'm always amazed that Paul Benowitz's story
[02:15:52.840 --> 02:15:55.060]   is not more widely spoken of.
[02:15:55.060 --> 02:15:58.400]   And I think that's because people,
[02:15:58.400 --> 02:16:00.060]   there's like the sort of ufologists
[02:16:00.060 --> 02:16:02.680]   or the people who are like absolutely convinced
[02:16:02.680 --> 02:16:04.800]   that aliens are among us.
[02:16:04.800 --> 02:16:07.360]   And I use that term loosely, but you know what I mean.
[02:16:07.360 --> 02:16:09.320]   And then there's the quote-unquote skeptics.
[02:16:09.320 --> 02:16:13.240]   And the skeptics tend to be sort of like self-righteous.
[02:16:13.240 --> 02:16:15.240]   And I would never want to be self-righteous.
[02:16:15.240 --> 02:16:17.000]   So I'm not a skeptic.
[02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:20.440]   I'm just, you know, agnostic, I suppose.
[02:16:20.440 --> 02:16:22.800]   But Google Paul Benowitz,
[02:16:22.800 --> 02:16:25.080]   and you can learn the story of that man
[02:16:25.080 --> 02:16:28.960]   who thought he saw a UFO in the '70s, early '80s,
[02:16:28.960 --> 02:16:30.160]   and the Air Force,
[02:16:30.160 --> 02:16:33.240]   because the Air Force intelligence community
[02:16:33.240 --> 02:16:36.160]   works hand-in-glove with CIA a lot.
[02:16:36.160 --> 02:16:37.920]   And some of the other intelligence agencies,
[02:16:37.920 --> 02:16:40.920]   of course, they're 17, not just the CIA.
[02:16:40.920 --> 02:16:44.140]   And they destroyed Paul Benowitz.
[02:16:44.140 --> 02:16:46.080]   They sent him to a mental institution
[02:16:46.080 --> 02:16:50.080]   by pulling a massive strategic deception campaign
[02:16:50.080 --> 02:16:52.560]   against him because they didn't want him to know
[02:16:52.560 --> 02:16:54.100]   about the technology that he was seeing
[02:16:54.100 --> 02:16:56.300]   at Kirkland Air Force Base.
[02:16:56.300 --> 02:16:59.140]   So look that up, and then you go, oh my God.
[02:16:59.140 --> 02:17:00.500]   And, you know, to my eye,
[02:17:00.500 --> 02:17:04.300]   you can apply any of these other names,
[02:17:04.300 --> 02:17:06.860]   substitute in Paul Benowitz,
[02:17:06.860 --> 02:17:09.060]   or any of the current individuals, you know,
[02:17:09.060 --> 02:17:13.300]   who really become convinced of X, Y, or Z
[02:17:13.300 --> 02:17:15.660]   when in fact there is a strategic deception campaign
[02:17:15.660 --> 02:17:16.660]   going on.
[02:17:16.660 --> 02:17:19.500]   - Yeah, there's a lot of incentive for the CIA
[02:17:19.500 --> 02:17:21.580]   and other intelligence agencies
[02:17:21.580 --> 02:17:23.940]   to get you to look the other way
[02:17:23.940 --> 02:17:26.240]   on whatever is happening.
[02:17:26.240 --> 02:17:30.820]   Plus, from a enemy perspective,
[02:17:30.820 --> 02:17:32.820]   whenever two nations are at war,
[02:17:32.820 --> 02:17:35.660]   to try to create hysteria in the other.
[02:17:35.660 --> 02:17:37.500]   - But then you have the Thomas theorem
[02:17:37.500 --> 02:17:39.340]   that becomes applicable there too.
[02:17:39.340 --> 02:17:42.020]   If men define situations as real,
[02:17:42.020 --> 02:17:44.980]   they are real in their consequences, right?
[02:17:44.980 --> 02:17:49.980]   So this idea of, like, UFOs and we're being lied to,
[02:17:51.740 --> 02:17:55.660]   it becomes real to many people.
[02:17:55.660 --> 02:17:59.280]   And then that creates a whole subset of problems
[02:17:59.280 --> 02:18:03.040]   to the point where things are spiraling out of control
[02:18:03.040 --> 02:18:05.980]   and there is no center anymore, right?
[02:18:05.980 --> 02:18:10.000]   So a lot of people that are briefed on programs
[02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:14.140]   maybe aren't even aware of their position
[02:18:14.140 --> 02:18:15.700]   within a greater campaign.
[02:18:15.700 --> 02:18:21.300]   Or I'm wrong and there are aliens among us.
[02:18:21.300 --> 02:18:24.620]   - Right, so I appreciate the possibility
[02:18:24.620 --> 02:18:27.700]   of acknowledging that you might be wrong.
[02:18:27.700 --> 02:18:31.180]   From everything you know about the US government,
[02:18:31.180 --> 02:18:33.820]   if there was an alien spacecraft,
[02:18:33.820 --> 02:18:35.020]   like, what do you think would happen?
[02:18:35.020 --> 02:18:37.580]   Would they be able to hold on to those secrets
[02:18:37.580 --> 02:18:39.680]   for decades?
[02:18:39.680 --> 02:18:43.740]   Like, would they want to hold on to those secrets?
[02:18:43.740 --> 02:18:46.380]   Like, what would they do?
[02:18:46.380 --> 02:18:47.440]   What's your sense?
[02:18:48.260 --> 02:18:53.260]   - I can't imagine that kind of exciting situation
[02:18:53.260 --> 02:18:58.020]   not becoming public information, right?
[02:18:58.020 --> 02:19:00.180]   And the counter to that is this, right?
[02:19:00.180 --> 02:19:02.540]   Which is, this is a very strong argument
[02:19:02.540 --> 02:19:05.740]   for why this is a big strategic deception campaign, right?
[02:19:05.740 --> 02:19:10.740]   Think about the defense department and the air,
[02:19:10.740 --> 02:19:17.000]   think about how jealously they guard its airspace, right?
[02:19:18.100 --> 02:19:20.300]   I mean, you had a Chinese balloon flying over
[02:19:20.300 --> 02:19:22.900]   and the whole world went crazy, right?
[02:19:22.900 --> 02:19:24.980]   It was front page news.
[02:19:24.980 --> 02:19:28.700]   So the fact that one element or a couple people
[02:19:28.700 --> 02:19:31.140]   in the defense department have made this statement,
[02:19:31.140 --> 02:19:34.040]   "We've lost control of our airspace
[02:19:34.040 --> 02:19:39.040]   over this UFO, alleged UFO craft that they can't explain."
[02:19:39.040 --> 02:19:43.100]   I don't buy that at all, zero.
[02:19:43.100 --> 02:19:45.340]   - Of course it's possible that, you know,
[02:19:45.340 --> 02:19:49.140]   it is alien spacecraft, if it is that,
[02:19:49.140 --> 02:19:52.700]   and they operate under a very different set
[02:19:52.700 --> 02:19:56.500]   of technological capabilities, in theory.
[02:19:56.500 --> 02:19:58.180]   - In my interviews with Jacques Vallée,
[02:19:58.180 --> 02:20:01.780]   who is the kind of grandfather of all ufology,
[02:20:01.780 --> 02:20:03.380]   and he's such an interesting person
[02:20:03.380 --> 02:20:06.100]   and has such a really unique origin story
[02:20:06.100 --> 02:20:08.060]   about how he came into all of this,
[02:20:08.060 --> 02:20:09.500]   and he's such a scientist, right?
[02:20:09.500 --> 02:20:12.500]   And he is profoundly dedicated to this issue
[02:20:12.500 --> 02:20:15.100]   and stands completely on the opposite end
[02:20:15.100 --> 02:20:17.060]   of the spectrum from me and knows a lot more
[02:20:17.060 --> 02:20:18.740]   and has studied this for decades more.
[02:20:18.740 --> 02:20:21.480]   But what he said to me is the most interesting thing,
[02:20:21.480 --> 02:20:23.740]   which is that it's not a military problem,
[02:20:23.740 --> 02:20:25.700]   it's an intelligence problem.
[02:20:25.700 --> 02:20:27.740]   Because Jacques believes that this is some kind
[02:20:27.740 --> 02:20:29.680]   of intelligence, right?
[02:20:29.680 --> 02:20:32.700]   Which really, the closest I can do
[02:20:32.700 --> 02:20:36.580]   to wrapping my head around that takes me to consciousness,
[02:20:36.580 --> 02:20:39.660]   right, the idea of what is consciousness.
[02:20:39.660 --> 02:20:41.900]   And I think that's where it becomes very interesting.
[02:20:41.900 --> 02:20:44.980]   I think the government is hiding bodies
[02:20:44.980 --> 02:20:48.300]   and crafts is very Paul Benoist, read it.
[02:20:48.300 --> 02:20:50.260]   Google it, look into it, right?
[02:20:50.260 --> 02:20:53.940]   - Yeah, yeah, I think this kind of flying saucer thing
[02:20:53.940 --> 02:20:58.360]   is a trivialization of what kind of,
[02:20:58.360 --> 02:21:00.260]   if there's alien civilizations out there.
[02:21:00.260 --> 02:21:02.900]   - Trivialization, that's a great word.
[02:21:02.900 --> 02:21:05.500]   Trivialization, that's, I agree with you.
[02:21:05.500 --> 02:21:08.900]   - I tend to believe that there's like a very large number
[02:21:08.900 --> 02:21:11.140]   of alien civilizations out there.
[02:21:11.140 --> 02:21:15.780]   And I believe we would have trouble comprehending
[02:21:15.780 --> 02:21:18.420]   what that even looks like, were they to visit.
[02:21:18.420 --> 02:21:21.140]   I tend to believe they are already here,
[02:21:21.140 --> 02:21:23.560]   have visited, and we're too dumb
[02:21:23.560 --> 02:21:25.780]   to understand what that even means.
[02:21:25.780 --> 02:21:27.500]   And they certainly would not appear
[02:21:27.500 --> 02:21:32.500]   as flying objects that defy gravity
[02:21:32.500 --> 02:21:36.700]   for brief moments of time on a low-resolution video.
[02:21:36.700 --> 02:21:40.460]   I tend to have humility about all this kind of stuff.
[02:21:40.460 --> 02:21:42.500]   But I think radical humility is required
[02:21:42.500 --> 02:21:43.900]   to even like open your eyes
[02:21:43.900 --> 02:21:46.860]   to what an alien intelligence would actually look like.
[02:21:46.860 --> 02:21:51.260]   And to me, it's beyond military applications.
[02:21:51.260 --> 02:21:54.020]   It's like the basic human question of like,
[02:21:54.020 --> 02:21:55.300]   what is even this thing?
[02:21:55.300 --> 02:21:57.460]   Like you mentioned consciousness that's going on.
[02:21:57.460 --> 02:21:58.840]   Like, where's this come from?
[02:21:58.840 --> 02:22:00.340]   Why is it so powerful?
[02:22:00.340 --> 02:22:02.300]   Is it unique in the universe?
[02:22:02.300 --> 02:22:04.740]   I tend to believe not.
[02:22:04.740 --> 02:22:08.140]   Of course, I hang out a bunch with other folks,
[02:22:08.140 --> 02:22:11.180]   like Elon, who believe we are alone.
[02:22:11.180 --> 02:22:15.620]   But I think that belief, just like you said,
[02:22:15.620 --> 02:22:21.500]   has power because it actually manifests itself in reality.
[02:22:21.500 --> 02:22:26.540]   So if you believe that we're alone in this universe,
[02:22:26.540 --> 02:22:28.580]   that's a great motivator to build rockets
[02:22:28.580 --> 02:22:31.020]   and become multi-planetary and save ourselves,
[02:22:31.020 --> 02:22:32.900]   especially in the case of nuclear war.
[02:22:32.900 --> 02:22:36.340]   Because otherwise, whatever this special sauce,
[02:22:36.340 --> 02:22:40.220]   this flame of consciousness will go out
[02:22:40.220 --> 02:22:41.820]   if we destroy ourselves on this earth.
[02:22:41.820 --> 02:22:45.560]   And for people like Elon, it's too high of a probability
[02:22:45.560 --> 02:22:47.660]   that we destroy ourselves on earth,
[02:22:47.660 --> 02:22:50.920]   not to try to become multi-planetary.
[02:22:50.920 --> 02:22:54.740]   In your book on Area 51, you propose an explanation
[02:22:54.740 --> 02:22:57.800]   that I think some people have criticized at the very end,
[02:22:57.800 --> 02:23:02.900]   that this might've been a disinformation campaign
[02:23:02.900 --> 02:23:07.900]   from, I guess, Stalin, that the Roswell incident
[02:23:07.900 --> 02:23:10.780]   was a remotely piloted plane
[02:23:10.780 --> 02:23:14.940]   with a, quote, "grotesque child-sized aviator."
[02:23:14.940 --> 02:23:18.340]   Just looking back at all that now, years later,
[02:23:18.340 --> 02:23:20.140]   what's the probability that it's true?
[02:23:20.140 --> 02:23:21.820]   What's the probability it's not?
[02:23:21.820 --> 02:23:26.980]   - So you know I've never revealed who that source is?
[02:23:26.980 --> 02:23:27.820]   - Yes. - Did you know that?
[02:23:27.820 --> 02:23:29.060]   - I know. - Want me to tell you?
[02:23:29.060 --> 02:23:30.420]   - With the source? - Yeah.
[02:23:30.420 --> 02:23:32.120]   - Okay, who is the source?
[02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:36.400]   - So before I say anything on that,
[02:23:36.400 --> 02:23:40.680]   let me speak to the question that you asked, right?
[02:23:40.680 --> 02:23:44.320]   So you asked me what's the probability
[02:23:44.320 --> 02:23:47.960]   that that is still standing as an idea
[02:23:47.960 --> 02:23:50.440]   12, 13, 14 years later, right?
[02:23:50.440 --> 02:23:52.760]   So I continued to work with that source
[02:23:52.760 --> 02:23:54.080]   for years afterwards.
[02:23:54.080 --> 02:23:55.160]   We talked about this.
[02:23:55.160 --> 02:24:00.160]   Look, I mean, his whole family knew it was him,
[02:24:00.480 --> 02:24:03.520]   and I knew his family 'cause I was an integral part of,
[02:24:03.520 --> 02:24:05.420]   you know, I was at his house,
[02:24:05.420 --> 02:24:09.040]   met all his kids, grandkids, and--
[02:24:09.040 --> 02:24:11.360]   - And we should say the source
[02:24:11.360 --> 02:24:14.640]   is the main expert advisor behind the story
[02:24:14.640 --> 02:24:16.660]   that it was, maybe you can explain what the story is
[02:24:16.660 --> 02:24:17.960]   that you're reporting in the book,
[02:24:17.960 --> 02:24:22.800]   that it was a disinformation campaign created by Stalin
[02:24:22.800 --> 02:24:25.880]   to cause mass hysteria in the United States.
[02:24:25.880 --> 02:24:26.800]   - Yes. - The very kind
[02:24:26.800 --> 02:24:28.920]   that we've been speaking about with the CIA and so on.
[02:24:28.920 --> 02:24:31.280]   - Yes, predicated on the narrative
[02:24:31.280 --> 02:24:33.840]   of the War of the Worlds, right?
[02:24:33.840 --> 02:24:34.800]   And the War of the Worlds,
[02:24:34.800 --> 02:24:36.720]   when it was a radio program in the United States,
[02:24:36.720 --> 02:24:37.660]   made people go crazy.
[02:24:37.660 --> 02:24:39.360]   Oh my God, we're being invaded by aliens.
[02:24:39.360 --> 02:24:41.960]   Well, the government was always interested in this story,
[02:24:41.960 --> 02:24:43.280]   and Joseph Stalin was too.
[02:24:43.280 --> 02:24:46.080]   We know that from declassified documents, right?
[02:24:46.080 --> 02:24:51.000]   And so the source told me that the reason for this program
[02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:53.000]   and that the real Roswell crash remains
[02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:58.000]   were, in fact, it was a black propaganda hoax
[02:24:58.080 --> 02:25:02.320]   infiltrated or rather predicated at this idea
[02:25:02.320 --> 02:25:03.680]   that you were gonna overwhelm
[02:25:03.680 --> 02:25:06.120]   America's early warning air defense system,
[02:25:06.120 --> 02:25:08.920]   cause mayhem, and maybe be able to attack the United States.
[02:25:08.920 --> 02:25:09.760]   That was the plan.
[02:25:09.760 --> 02:25:12.420]   And Stalin was also messing with the United States,
[02:25:12.420 --> 02:25:15.880]   messing with Truman, who sort of turned his back on him,
[02:25:15.880 --> 02:25:17.720]   right, at Potsdam.
[02:25:17.720 --> 02:25:21.720]   And so this idea was,
[02:25:21.720 --> 02:25:23.520]   and the reason that the source is important,
[02:25:23.520 --> 02:25:27.400]   and unlike a lot of people, I saw this, I saw that,
[02:25:27.400 --> 02:25:29.800]   I learned that, was according to the source,
[02:25:29.800 --> 02:25:36.360]   once it was determined that this was a hoax
[02:25:36.360 --> 02:25:39.080]   and that Stalin was able to get a craft
[02:25:39.080 --> 02:25:41.640]   over the United States and it crashed,
[02:25:41.640 --> 02:25:43.920]   and it had people inside of it,
[02:25:43.920 --> 02:25:47.600]   they were people that were sort of deformed
[02:25:47.600 --> 02:25:52.040]   and meant surgically altered to look like aliens,
[02:25:52.040 --> 02:25:54.700]   the United States government decided
[02:25:54.700 --> 02:25:58.620]   that it needed to know what on earth that was all about,
[02:25:58.620 --> 02:26:00.920]   and if it was possible for us to have the same program.
[02:26:00.920 --> 02:26:03.620]   This is according to the source, right?
[02:26:03.620 --> 02:26:06.220]   And so it sounds preposterous.
[02:26:06.220 --> 02:26:08.180]   And if it was just someone saying,
[02:26:08.180 --> 02:26:09.800]   you might say, well, it's ridiculous,
[02:26:09.800 --> 02:26:12.060]   tell me and get them onto another subject.
[02:26:12.060 --> 02:26:14.740]   But the difference was, is this source,
[02:26:14.740 --> 02:26:16.360]   who was very well-placed and friends
[02:26:16.360 --> 02:26:18.780]   with all of the other 75 people,
[02:26:18.780 --> 02:26:22.620]   told me this as a confession, right?
[02:26:22.620 --> 02:26:24.660]   A real tearful confession,
[02:26:24.660 --> 02:26:27.180]   because what he said is he was involved
[02:26:27.180 --> 02:26:29.940]   in the American program to do the same thing.
[02:26:29.940 --> 02:26:30.940]   And people died,
[02:26:30.940 --> 02:26:33.900]   because there were human experiments that went on.
[02:26:33.900 --> 02:26:36.740]   And I write about this in the last 12 pages of Area 51.
[02:26:36.740 --> 02:26:39.660]   It was an explosive revelation,
[02:26:39.660 --> 02:26:42.060]   and I felt very confident in writing this,
[02:26:42.060 --> 02:26:43.780]   because the source wanted it written.
[02:26:43.780 --> 02:26:44.620]   Why?
[02:26:44.620 --> 02:26:48.020]   Because he said, I'm dedicated to my country.
[02:26:48.020 --> 02:26:51.780]   I know about being committed to national security,
[02:26:51.780 --> 02:26:53.700]   and this kind of thing must never happen.
[02:26:53.700 --> 02:26:55.260]   And if you give people too much power,
[02:26:55.260 --> 02:26:57.180]   they will take advantage of it.
[02:26:57.180 --> 02:26:59.500]   And he wanted it on the record.
[02:26:59.500 --> 02:27:02.300]   And his wife of 60 years did not know
[02:27:02.300 --> 02:27:04.180]   until after the book published,
[02:27:04.180 --> 02:27:05.700]   nor did his children, okay?
[02:27:05.700 --> 02:27:07.520]   So after the book published,
[02:27:07.520 --> 02:27:11.700]   I was called to his house and sat there with his family.
[02:27:11.700 --> 02:27:13.940]   And they said, tell us this isn't true.
[02:27:13.940 --> 02:27:15.500]   And he said, it is true, right?
[02:27:15.500 --> 02:27:20.540]   Now that source is Al O'Donnell,
[02:27:20.540 --> 02:27:23.060]   who is the nuclear weapons engineer
[02:27:23.060 --> 02:27:28.060]   who armed, wired, and fired 186 nuclear weapons, okay?
[02:27:28.060 --> 02:27:33.460]   So if you want to talk about something,
[02:27:33.460 --> 02:27:35.500]   you're the first person I've told that on the record,
[02:27:35.500 --> 02:27:36.900]   but it's kind of about time.
[02:27:36.900 --> 02:27:38.700]   - Wow.
[02:27:38.700 --> 02:27:45.480]   Well, you received a lot of criticism over this story,
[02:27:45.480 --> 02:27:47.620]   and it confused me, why?
[02:27:47.620 --> 02:27:50.900]   Because it's, given the context
[02:27:50.900 --> 02:27:53.260]   of everything you've described with the CIA
[02:27:53.260 --> 02:27:55.000]   and other intelligence agencies,
[02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:58.640]   it is reasonable that such an action would be taken.
[02:27:58.640 --> 02:28:05.020]   - And the source is extraordinarily credible, right?
[02:28:05.020 --> 02:28:07.420]   If you wanted to take the position,
[02:28:07.420 --> 02:28:09.420]   well, that person isn't very reliable,
[02:28:09.420 --> 02:28:11.140]   then you have to ask yourself,
[02:28:11.140 --> 02:28:14.860]   why did they have top secret clearances
[02:28:14.860 --> 02:28:18.680]   that are higher than any in the United States whatsoever?
[02:28:18.680 --> 02:28:22.140]   Because he was responsible for arming nuclear bombs.
[02:28:22.140 --> 02:28:24.060]   He was called the trigger man.
[02:28:24.060 --> 02:28:24.900]   And by the way,
[02:28:24.900 --> 02:28:28.460]   he told me that I could tell the world who he was.
[02:28:28.460 --> 02:28:32.700]   There's a lot of details that are really dark
[02:28:32.700 --> 02:28:34.820]   involving that program.
[02:28:34.820 --> 02:28:37.580]   And when is it appropriate, right?
[02:28:37.580 --> 02:28:39.400]   Well, it feels appropriate now, first of all,
[02:28:39.400 --> 02:28:41.180]   'cause you and I have been talking for several hours.
[02:28:41.180 --> 02:28:44.860]   So this is what is truly a long form conversation,
[02:28:44.860 --> 02:28:49.860]   and it's the outcome of a very long time of my reporting
[02:28:49.860 --> 02:28:55.120]   and also being judicious about closing the loop on that.
[02:28:55.120 --> 02:28:59.200]   Because I do think it's important for people to know
[02:28:59.200 --> 02:29:04.200]   that sources have revelations.
[02:29:04.200 --> 02:29:08.800]   - And like you said, the programs,
[02:29:08.800 --> 02:29:13.660]   both on the Soviet side and the American side,
[02:29:14.640 --> 02:29:17.840]   conflicting, I think, is the term we used previously,
[02:29:17.840 --> 02:29:22.220]   ethically, morally, on all fronts.
[02:29:22.220 --> 02:29:27.360]   People have done some horrible things
[02:29:27.360 --> 02:29:28.660]   in the name of security.
[02:29:28.660 --> 02:29:35.060]   In your book, "Surprise, Kill, Vanish,"
[02:29:35.060 --> 02:29:37.220]   you write about the CIA
[02:29:37.220 --> 02:29:40.520]   and the so-called president's third option.
[02:29:40.520 --> 02:29:43.100]   It turns out, so first of all,
[02:29:43.100 --> 02:29:45.500]   the first option being diplomacy,
[02:29:45.500 --> 02:29:48.500]   and second option being war.
[02:29:48.500 --> 02:29:50.180]   So when diplomacy is inadequate
[02:29:50.180 --> 02:29:53.900]   and war is a terrible idea, we'll go to the third option.
[02:29:53.900 --> 02:29:57.860]   And this third option is about covert action,
[02:29:57.860 --> 02:30:01.060]   and it's about assassination.
[02:30:01.060 --> 02:30:03.320]   So how much of that does the CIA do?
[02:30:03.320 --> 02:30:06.240]   - That is open to debate.
[02:30:06.240 --> 02:30:09.180]   We know from the historical record
[02:30:09.180 --> 02:30:12.020]   that the CIA was heavily involved in assassination
[02:30:12.020 --> 02:30:13.060]   during the Cold War.
[02:30:13.060 --> 02:30:14.500]   That's non-negotiable.
[02:30:14.500 --> 02:30:18.920]   Even the names of the programs
[02:30:18.920 --> 02:30:22.060]   that were assigned to perform assassinations
[02:30:22.060 --> 02:30:24.540]   are fascinating and now declassified,
[02:30:24.540 --> 02:30:26.740]   like Eisenhower's, for example,
[02:30:26.740 --> 02:30:28.840]   was the Health Alteration Committee.
[02:30:28.840 --> 02:30:31.300]   - Well, at least they have a sense of humor
[02:30:31.300 --> 02:30:33.220]   into this dark topic.
[02:30:33.220 --> 02:30:37.140]   - Then the more modern names are targeted killing, right?
[02:30:37.140 --> 02:30:40.500]   Executive action, targeted killing, right?
[02:30:40.500 --> 02:30:44.020]   I mean, drone striking is essentially assassination.
[02:30:44.020 --> 02:30:48.580]   And people jump up and down and say, "That's not true."
[02:30:48.580 --> 02:30:51.620]   Well, I spent quite a long time
[02:30:51.620 --> 02:30:55.300]   interviewing the CIA's lead counsel, John Rizzo.
[02:30:55.300 --> 02:30:57.260]   He died recently.
[02:30:57.260 --> 02:31:00.640]   But Rizzo was very forthcoming with me,
[02:31:00.640 --> 02:31:02.780]   of course, never sharing classified information,
[02:31:02.780 --> 02:31:06.080]   but going up to the edge of what can legally be known,
[02:31:06.080 --> 02:31:08.300]   Rizzo was thrown under the bus
[02:31:08.340 --> 02:31:12.260]   by sort of the general public for,
[02:31:12.260 --> 02:31:15.740]   he was the fall guy for the torture campaign.
[02:31:15.740 --> 02:31:19.020]   The CIA calls it enhanced interrogation.
[02:31:19.020 --> 02:31:23.140]   And so Rizzo had this long career.
[02:31:23.140 --> 02:31:24.660]   You know, he began working
[02:31:24.660 --> 02:31:27.100]   under the Carter administration, right?
[02:31:27.100 --> 02:31:29.260]   And was responsible for the torture memos,
[02:31:29.260 --> 02:31:31.820]   was responsible for legally making sure
[02:31:31.820 --> 02:31:33.640]   the president's ass was covered,
[02:31:33.640 --> 02:31:36.420]   and then got thrown under the bus.
[02:31:36.420 --> 02:31:38.040]   And so he was very forthcoming,
[02:31:38.040 --> 02:31:40.060]   not in a bitter way, but in a very earnest way
[02:31:40.060 --> 02:31:44.260]   about a lot of how these programs are made to be legal.
[02:31:44.260 --> 02:31:45.940]   Because if the president of the United States
[02:31:45.940 --> 02:31:47.900]   says they're legal, they're legal.
[02:31:47.900 --> 02:31:52.100]   Executive order 12333, you know?
[02:31:52.100 --> 02:31:53.540]   It says we don't assassinate,
[02:31:53.540 --> 02:31:55.820]   but it can be overwritten by another order.
[02:31:55.820 --> 02:31:58.020]   That's straight out of Rizzo's mouth, right?
[02:31:58.020 --> 02:32:01.580]   Also really important to keep in mind
[02:32:01.580 --> 02:32:05.380]   is that the military operates under what's called Title 50.
[02:32:05.380 --> 02:32:07.300]   It's part of the National Security Code
[02:32:07.300 --> 02:32:11.020]   that gives sort of rules and et cetera,
[02:32:11.020 --> 02:32:13.420]   how you must behave in a war theater.
[02:32:13.420 --> 02:32:15.960]   Well, the CIA is under no such rules.
[02:32:15.960 --> 02:32:18.620]   It operates under what's called Title 50.
[02:32:18.620 --> 02:32:20.700]   And it's interesting to me as a reporter,
[02:32:20.700 --> 02:32:21.940]   'cause before I wrote the book
[02:32:21.940 --> 02:32:24.280]   and reported openly about Title 50,
[02:32:24.280 --> 02:32:25.740]   it was not really discussed.
[02:32:25.740 --> 02:32:28.500]   And now you even see operators themselves on podcasts
[02:32:28.500 --> 02:32:30.980]   talking about Title 50, which is kind of great,
[02:32:30.980 --> 02:32:33.300]   because it's like the cat's out of the bag, guys.
[02:32:33.300 --> 02:32:35.640]   That's what it's called, and that's how it works.
[02:32:35.640 --> 02:32:38.600]   It means what we say goes.
[02:32:38.600 --> 02:32:40.340]   - Can you elaborate on what Title 50,
[02:32:40.340 --> 02:32:43.300]   so it basically says assassination is allowed?
[02:32:43.300 --> 02:32:45.060]   - It says what the president wants,
[02:32:45.060 --> 02:32:47.340]   the president gets, right?
[02:32:47.340 --> 02:32:50.620]   And so, I mean, the best example
[02:32:50.620 --> 02:32:53.060]   is the killing of bin Laden, right?
[02:32:53.060 --> 02:32:55.220]   We were not at war with Pakistan.
[02:32:55.220 --> 02:32:57.100]   So Title 50 doesn't apply.
[02:32:57.100 --> 02:33:00.980]   You can't have a military operation in a country
[02:33:00.980 --> 02:33:01.880]   you're not at war with.
[02:33:01.880 --> 02:33:04.060]   I mean, the lines, my God, now they've really blurred.
[02:33:04.060 --> 02:33:06.900]   But even then, they were a little more honored, right?
[02:33:06.900 --> 02:33:08.260]   And so what do you do?
[02:33:08.260 --> 02:33:10.980]   Well, Leon Panetta was the CIA director,
[02:33:10.980 --> 02:33:17.100]   and you work out a scenario whereby the SEALs,
[02:33:17.100 --> 02:33:19.580]   and by the way, it wasn't the SEAL,
[02:33:19.580 --> 02:33:23.100]   there was a rotational on that killer capture mission,
[02:33:23.100 --> 02:33:24.700]   which was really just a kill mission.
[02:33:24.700 --> 02:33:26.900]   SEALs were practicing, Delta was practicing,
[02:33:26.900 --> 02:33:29.120]   and Special Activities Division was practicing.
[02:33:29.120 --> 02:33:31.020]   They were all practicing at a secret facility
[02:33:31.020 --> 02:33:33.020]   in North Carolina, right?
[02:33:33.020 --> 02:33:35.140]   And it was just like, they're ready
[02:33:35.140 --> 02:33:36.260]   till they get the go order,
[02:33:36.260 --> 02:33:38.700]   and it just happened to be the SEALs, okay?
[02:33:38.700 --> 02:33:41.660]   So the SEALs operate under Title 10.
[02:33:41.660 --> 02:33:44.140]   So they had to get what I call sheep dip,
[02:33:44.140 --> 02:33:45.980]   because that's what the insiders call it, right?
[02:33:45.980 --> 02:33:47.700]   And that is a term that comes from,
[02:33:47.700 --> 02:33:49.780]   interestingly, Area 51.
[02:33:49.780 --> 02:33:52.080]   The U-2 pilots were Air Force pilots.
[02:33:52.080 --> 02:33:55.220]   They needed to be sheep dipped over to the CIA
[02:33:55.220 --> 02:33:59.660]   so they could do things that defied the law, okay?
[02:33:59.660 --> 02:34:01.680]   So you can see how these all entwine,
[02:34:01.680 --> 02:34:03.220]   and you become more and more informed,
[02:34:03.220 --> 02:34:05.060]   and you go, "Aha," right?
[02:34:05.060 --> 02:34:06.900]   So that's how Title 50 worked.
[02:34:06.900 --> 02:34:10.780]   So the night of that mission, it was a CIA mission,
[02:34:10.780 --> 02:34:13.740]   because the CIA is allowed to go into Pakistan
[02:34:13.740 --> 02:34:16.300]   and kill someone, and the military can't.
[02:34:16.300 --> 02:34:17.140]   - That's fascinating.
[02:34:17.140 --> 02:34:18.880]   So people talk about the Navy SEALs doing it,
[02:34:18.880 --> 02:34:21.580]   but it's really, legally speaking,
[02:34:21.580 --> 02:34:22.900]   to get the permission to do it
[02:34:22.900 --> 02:34:25.700]   within the whole legal framework of the United States,
[02:34:25.700 --> 02:34:27.020]   it was the CIA.
[02:34:27.020 --> 02:34:30.060]   - And if you look at their uniforms that they were wearing,
[02:34:30.060 --> 02:34:32.480]   and now that you know this, you'll be like, "Oh."
[02:34:32.480 --> 02:34:34.560]   You'll see there's no nomenclature on them.
[02:34:34.560 --> 02:34:35.460]   There's no, right?
[02:34:35.460 --> 02:34:37.160]   So those are, they're just meant
[02:34:37.160 --> 02:34:39.520]   to be completely untraceable.
[02:34:39.520 --> 02:34:42.120]   Were that, were they to be shot down and captured?
[02:34:42.120 --> 02:34:43.520]   It's like, wait, who are these guys?
[02:34:43.520 --> 02:34:45.880]   Oh, a bunch of rogue guys, okay?
[02:34:45.880 --> 02:34:48.400]   And this goes back, the origin story of all that
[02:34:48.400 --> 02:34:50.840]   is in Vietnam with Mac V. Sog,
[02:34:50.840 --> 02:34:52.960]   and these cross-border operations
[02:34:52.960 --> 02:34:55.640]   that I chronicle in "Surprise, Kill, Vanish,"
[02:34:55.640 --> 02:34:59.280]   which still amaze me to this day, right?
[02:34:59.280 --> 02:35:03.140]   I mean, Sog missions, they called it suicide on the ground,
[02:35:03.140 --> 02:35:04.340]   'cause that's what it was.
[02:35:04.340 --> 02:35:08.560]   And these guys had no identifiable nothing.
[02:35:08.560 --> 02:35:11.220]   I mean, they were essentially in pajamas, right?
[02:35:11.220 --> 02:35:15.340]   Even their weapons were specially designed by the CIA
[02:35:15.340 --> 02:35:18.940]   to have no serial numbers, no nothing.
[02:35:18.940 --> 02:35:22.260]   So if they were captured and they became POWs,
[02:35:22.260 --> 02:35:24.660]   I don't know who these guys are.
[02:35:24.660 --> 02:35:26.340]   - What do you think,
[02:35:26.340 --> 02:35:30.080]   and how much do they think at the highest levels of power
[02:35:30.080 --> 02:35:32.080]   about the ethics of assassination
[02:35:32.080 --> 02:35:37.840]   and about the role of that in geopolitics
[02:35:37.840 --> 02:35:40.060]   and military operations?
[02:35:40.060 --> 02:35:43.480]   Like, to you maybe also,
[02:35:43.480 --> 02:35:48.380]   does assassination make sense as a good methodology of war?
[02:35:48.380 --> 02:35:51.560]   - I mean, again, I try to remain agnostic
[02:35:51.560 --> 02:35:52.720]   on the policy part of it
[02:35:52.720 --> 02:35:55.360]   and just report the operator's perspective, right?
[02:35:55.360 --> 02:35:57.080]   Because this is what people do,
[02:35:57.080 --> 02:35:59.240]   and this is what people are asked to do.
[02:35:59.240 --> 02:36:02.560]   And it depends on the individual.
[02:36:02.560 --> 02:36:06.120]   I mean, Billy Wah went on a lot of those missions.
[02:36:06.120 --> 02:36:07.360]   I mean, the saying is like,
[02:36:07.360 --> 02:36:11.200]   "Oh, Billy Wah, he killed more people than cancer," right?
[02:36:11.200 --> 02:36:14.720]   Did Billy Wah ever tell me about direct assassinations?
[02:36:14.720 --> 02:36:17.760]   No, because they're all classified, right?
[02:36:17.760 --> 02:36:19.480]   Did he tell me about some failed ones?
[02:36:19.480 --> 02:36:20.800]   Yes, I'll give you an example.
[02:36:20.800 --> 02:36:22.000]   It's really interesting.
[02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:25.280]   He would show me these PowerPoints
[02:36:25.280 --> 02:36:26.840]   that were just fantastic.
[02:36:26.840 --> 02:36:30.200]   Late in his life, he was constantly being asked
[02:36:30.200 --> 02:36:32.800]   to go up to Fort Bragg and lecture to the young soldiers.
[02:36:32.800 --> 02:36:35.200]   And everybody loved him, you know?
[02:36:35.200 --> 02:36:38.760]   And he would drive all night to get there,
[02:36:38.760 --> 02:36:40.160]   and he would create these PowerPoints,
[02:36:40.160 --> 02:36:41.400]   and then he would show me the PowerPoints,
[02:36:41.400 --> 02:36:44.040]   and he would, all unclassified.
[02:36:44.040 --> 02:36:47.440]   But at one point, when Hugo Chavez was in power,
[02:36:47.440 --> 02:36:50.800]   Billy Wah was kind of asked, that's how it works,
[02:36:50.800 --> 02:36:53.040]   of like, if you had to think about doing something,
[02:36:53.040 --> 02:36:55.440]   what would it look like, let's just say hypothetically.
[02:36:55.440 --> 02:36:57.680]   So he took me through this PowerPoint that never happened,
[02:36:57.680 --> 02:37:01.720]   whereby he and a group of operators, agency operators,
[02:37:01.720 --> 02:37:05.840]   were gonna halo jump in to the palace and grab Chavez,
[02:37:05.840 --> 02:37:06.840]   and probably kill him,
[02:37:06.840 --> 02:37:09.080]   'cause he wouldn't allow himself to be captured.
[02:37:09.080 --> 02:37:11.840]   And, you know, what Billy, and by the way,
[02:37:11.840 --> 02:37:14.280]   halo jumping, for those of listeners who don't know,
[02:37:14.280 --> 02:37:17.720]   high altitude, low opening, right?
[02:37:17.720 --> 02:37:19.920]   So you jump out of an aircraft,
[02:37:19.920 --> 02:37:22.360]   and you go down like a pencil
[02:37:22.360 --> 02:37:25.400]   until you're really low to the deck, like 1,000 feet,
[02:37:25.400 --> 02:37:26.880]   you pull your parachute cord,
[02:37:26.880 --> 02:37:29.680]   and that way you're not picked up on radar.
[02:37:29.680 --> 02:37:31.920]   And you're also not traceable when you get to the ground,
[02:37:31.920 --> 02:37:33.320]   'cause it's so fast.
[02:37:33.320 --> 02:37:37.280]   Billy Wah took the second halo jump in history
[02:37:37.280 --> 02:37:40.920]   into a war theater in Laos during the Vietnam War, right?
[02:37:40.920 --> 02:37:42.880]   So he's like this famous halo jumper, right?
[02:37:42.880 --> 02:37:46.120]   So he and the team were gonna go in, grab Chavez,
[02:37:46.120 --> 02:37:50.800]   and he said to me a very interesting thing
[02:37:50.800 --> 02:37:52.320]   that was kind of a one moment in time
[02:37:52.320 --> 02:37:54.040]   where I saw a different side of Billy Wah,
[02:37:54.040 --> 02:37:57.720]   where he said, "I'm so glad we didn't do that,
[02:37:57.720 --> 02:38:00.680]   "even though I really wanted to at the time.
[02:38:00.680 --> 02:38:03.000]   "Because, you know, can you imagine
[02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:06.320]   "that country's problems where it is now?
[02:38:06.320 --> 02:38:10.320]   "Can you imagine how we would have been blamed?"
[02:38:10.320 --> 02:38:13.320]   And it was an interesting, rare moment
[02:38:13.320 --> 02:38:16.520]   for Billy Wah to comment on the bigger picture
[02:38:16.520 --> 02:38:18.720]   that you're asking me about, right?
[02:38:18.720 --> 02:38:21.600]   I think pretty much the operators I know,
[02:38:21.600 --> 02:38:23.600]   they just stick to the mission.
[02:38:23.600 --> 02:38:26.000]   - So in the technical difficulty of those missions,
[02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:29.240]   just your big sense, how hard is it to assassinate,
[02:38:29.240 --> 02:38:35.100]   to assassinate a target on the soil of that nation?
[02:38:35.100 --> 02:38:38.080]   - I suppose that just depends, right?
[02:38:38.080 --> 02:38:41.360]   Here's another insightful thing Billy Wah said to me,
[02:38:41.360 --> 02:38:42.740]   and I'm answering the question around,
[02:38:42.740 --> 02:38:43.680]   because I don't know.
[02:38:43.680 --> 02:38:48.080]   Because again, you know, I never had anyone say to me,
[02:38:48.080 --> 02:38:50.200]   "Here's how it went down," right?
[02:38:50.200 --> 02:38:52.000]   Because you can't, that would be,
[02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:53.720]   first of all, those are classified.
[02:38:53.720 --> 02:38:56.680]   So I'm never gonna receive classified information.
[02:38:56.680 --> 02:38:59.320]   I did hear a lot about reconnaissance missions,
[02:38:59.320 --> 02:39:01.040]   when people would be in charge of,
[02:39:01.040 --> 02:39:02.720]   you have to be able to, what's called,
[02:39:02.720 --> 02:39:05.320]   make book on the target before, right?
[02:39:05.320 --> 02:39:10.320]   And making book on the target means photographing them,
[02:39:10.520 --> 02:39:13.660]   to really, then that gets run up the chain of command,
[02:39:13.660 --> 02:39:16.220]   to make sure this is really Imad Mugnia
[02:39:16.220 --> 02:39:17.700]   we're about to kill, right?
[02:39:17.700 --> 02:39:20.620]   But I once asked Billy,
[02:39:20.620 --> 02:39:22.300]   when I was trying to get the question,
[02:39:22.300 --> 02:39:23.740]   and he wouldn't answer it, and I said,
[02:39:23.740 --> 02:39:26.060]   "So there's another person in my book named Rick Prado,
[02:39:26.060 --> 02:39:29.020]   "who's also like a legendary agency guy."
[02:39:29.020 --> 02:39:33.660]   And so, you know, he's like 20 years younger than Billy.
[02:39:33.660 --> 02:39:38.660]   And I said, "Billy, if you and Rick had to kill each other,
[02:39:39.880 --> 02:39:41.340]   "like who would win, right?"
[02:39:41.340 --> 02:39:43.260]   I was trying to imagine this like hypothetical,
[02:39:43.260 --> 02:39:44.820]   like how would that work, who would win, right?
[02:39:44.820 --> 02:39:47.580]   And I posed the question to each of them, right?
[02:39:47.580 --> 02:39:52.580]   And of course, each of them said me, right?
[02:39:52.580 --> 02:39:54.860]   But Billy, then I went back to them,
[02:39:54.860 --> 02:39:57.940]   and Billy said, "Let me tell you how I would win."
[02:39:57.940 --> 02:39:59.340]   Okay, right?
[02:39:59.340 --> 02:40:01.060]   And he said, "I'd cheat.
[02:40:01.060 --> 02:40:05.380]   "I'd show up before the duel, and I'd kill him."
[02:40:05.380 --> 02:40:06.220]   - Yeah.
[02:40:06.320 --> 02:40:10.040]   It's such a, like, you know, I have a lot of friends
[02:40:10.040 --> 02:40:13.160]   who are Navy SEALs, it's such a guy conversation.
[02:40:13.160 --> 02:40:15.400]   - Well, you would be amazed at what the women do.
[02:40:15.400 --> 02:40:16.960]   Let me just tell you that.
[02:40:16.960 --> 02:40:19.880]   Women are a part of the Special Activities Division.
[02:40:19.880 --> 02:40:22.760]   A big part of it.
[02:40:22.760 --> 02:40:24.140]   - Can you comment on that?
[02:40:24.140 --> 02:40:25.480]   - I can.
[02:40:25.480 --> 02:40:28.540]   Women can get a hell of a lot closer to a target.
[02:40:28.540 --> 02:40:32.660]   And I mean that literally.
[02:40:32.660 --> 02:40:34.080]   - The Special Operations, do you mean,
[02:40:34.080 --> 02:40:35.760]   is this part of the CIA?
[02:40:35.760 --> 02:40:37.360]   - The Special Activities Division?
[02:40:37.360 --> 02:40:40.280]   Now it's called the Special Activities Center.
[02:40:40.280 --> 02:40:43.840]   But originally, that's the umbrella agency
[02:40:43.840 --> 02:40:46.760]   that has the different paramilitary organizations
[02:40:46.760 --> 02:40:47.600]   under it, right?
[02:40:47.600 --> 02:40:50.260]   So the most lethal one is Ground Branch.
[02:40:50.260 --> 02:40:54.120]   And that's what I reported on in Surprise Kill Vanish.
[02:40:54.120 --> 02:40:57.680]   And its origins go way back to the Guerrilla Warfare Corps
[02:40:57.680 --> 02:41:02.200]   that was started in 1947 for the president.
[02:41:02.200 --> 02:41:07.200]   - So women are also a part of the alleged assassination?
[02:41:07.200 --> 02:41:10.120]   - Absolutely.
[02:41:10.120 --> 02:41:14.740]   - And you're saying they can at times be more effective?
[02:41:14.740 --> 02:41:20.900]   I'm just gonna leave that pause there.
[02:41:20.900 --> 02:41:24.880]   The reason I ask of how difficult the assassinations are,
[02:41:24.880 --> 02:41:27.240]   you know, with Bin Laden, it took a long time.
[02:41:27.240 --> 02:41:31.600]   So I guess the reconnaissance, the intelligence
[02:41:31.600 --> 02:41:36.000]   for finding the target, I imagine with Mossad,
[02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:39.560]   maybe the CIA now, the leadership of Hamas,
[02:41:39.560 --> 02:41:44.560]   of the military branch of Hamas is much wanted
[02:41:44.560 --> 02:41:46.920]   from an assassination perspective.
[02:41:46.920 --> 02:41:49.160]   So to me as an outside observer,
[02:41:49.160 --> 02:41:52.420]   it seems like it's more difficult than you would imagine.
[02:41:52.420 --> 02:41:56.400]   But perhaps that's the intelligence aspect of it,
[02:41:56.400 --> 02:42:00.200]   not the actual assassination of locating the person.
[02:42:00.200 --> 02:42:02.960]   - Well, I think it's because mostly,
[02:42:02.960 --> 02:42:06.040]   from what I understand, it's a really dirty game
[02:42:06.040 --> 02:42:08.240]   and people are covering for people, right?
[02:42:08.240 --> 02:42:09.520]   And I'll give you the example
[02:42:09.520 --> 02:42:12.820]   of Billy Wah and Imad Mugna, if I may, right?
[02:42:12.820 --> 02:42:15.740]   So Imad Mugna was the most wanted terrorist
[02:42:15.740 --> 02:42:17.240]   in the world before Bin Laden.
[02:42:17.240 --> 02:42:21.200]   Hezbollah's chief of operations.
[02:42:21.200 --> 02:42:25.160]   And he was wanted by every, you know, Mossad, John Down.
[02:42:25.160 --> 02:42:26.440]   But no one could find him.
[02:42:26.440 --> 02:42:27.720]   He was missing for 20 years.
[02:42:27.720 --> 02:42:29.960]   There wasn't even a photograph of him.
[02:42:29.960 --> 02:42:31.760]   And then he resurfaced.
[02:42:31.760 --> 02:42:36.760]   And of all places, he resurfaced in Saudi Arabia, okay?
[02:42:36.760 --> 02:42:40.960]   So what, that's when I say it's a dirty game, right?
[02:42:40.960 --> 02:42:45.960]   Hezbollah, Iran, Hezbollah, Iran, enemies with Saudi Arabia.
[02:42:45.960 --> 02:42:51.480]   Why on earth was Imad Mugna in Saudi Arabia?
[02:42:51.480 --> 02:42:53.120]   Well, that's where he was.
[02:42:53.120 --> 02:42:55.900]   There was a Navy SEAL who was doing reconnaissance on him.
[02:42:55.900 --> 02:42:57.800]   This is according to Billy Wah.
[02:42:57.800 --> 02:42:59.520]   And this is around 2005.
[02:42:59.520 --> 02:43:02.480]   So Billy's in his eighties at this point, right?
[02:43:02.480 --> 02:43:04.600]   Late seventies, eighties.
[02:43:04.600 --> 02:43:08.920]   And he gets word that the SEAL,
[02:43:08.920 --> 02:43:11.560]   who's been tracking Mugna to get photographs of him,
[02:43:11.560 --> 02:43:13.920]   to give the photographs to Mossad and CIA
[02:43:13.920 --> 02:43:15.920]   so they can do a joint operation to kill him,
[02:43:15.920 --> 02:43:18.800]   which they did with a car bomb in Damascus.
[02:43:18.800 --> 02:43:20.280]   That's the end of the story, right?
[02:43:20.280 --> 02:43:23.400]   But how we got there was we needed, you know,
[02:43:23.400 --> 02:43:24.840]   the CIA needed confirmation.
[02:43:24.840 --> 02:43:27.060]   You can't kill the wrong person.
[02:43:27.060 --> 02:43:29.640]   So the SEAL panicked according to Billy Wah
[02:43:29.640 --> 02:43:30.680]   and was just like, I'm out of here.
[02:43:30.680 --> 02:43:31.720]   This is too dangerous.
[02:43:31.720 --> 02:43:34.440]   And I do not want to wind up in a Saudi prison.
[02:43:34.440 --> 02:43:35.720]   So who do you send in?
[02:43:35.720 --> 02:43:37.680]   Billy Wah, right?
[02:43:37.680 --> 02:43:40.960]   He shows up, he's there for 24 hours.
[02:43:40.960 --> 02:43:44.080]   He finds, he knows where Mugna lives from the SEAL.
[02:43:44.080 --> 02:43:48.240]   He positions himself in a cafe across the street,
[02:43:48.240 --> 02:43:50.200]   which is run by Sudanese men.
[02:43:50.200 --> 02:43:52.320]   And of course, Wah speaks some Sudanese
[02:43:52.320 --> 02:43:54.640]   because he operated in Sudan, right?
[02:43:54.640 --> 02:43:57.300]   And he's shooting the shit with him by his own words.
[02:43:57.300 --> 02:43:58.860]   He had the most foul mouth.
[02:43:58.860 --> 02:44:01.340]   That was just absolutely delightful to listen to.
[02:44:01.340 --> 02:44:06.060]   And then in between him and Mugna's house is a dumpster.
[02:44:06.060 --> 02:44:07.740]   And Billy Wah being Billy Wah,
[02:44:07.740 --> 02:44:10.540]   who will go to any lengths to do the job,
[02:44:10.540 --> 02:44:15.540]   decides to conduct reconnaissance from inside the dumpster.
[02:44:15.540 --> 02:44:19.620]   And that is where he is when he takes the picture
[02:44:19.620 --> 02:44:24.620]   of Imad Mugna living so comfortably in Saudi
[02:44:24.620 --> 02:44:26.720]   that Mugna, according to Billy,
[02:44:26.720 --> 02:44:29.160]   came out of his apartment building
[02:44:29.160 --> 02:44:33.320]   with dry cleaner plastic bag hangers over his shoulder.
[02:44:33.320 --> 02:44:36.680]   That's how comfortable, he lived there.
[02:44:36.680 --> 02:44:38.060]   It was his neighborhood.
[02:44:38.060 --> 02:44:42.520]   Click, click, click, Billy Wah takes the photographs,
[02:44:42.520 --> 02:44:47.240]   runs them to the CIA headquarters in Saudi at the embassy.
[02:44:47.240 --> 02:44:49.940]   Oh my God, it's Mugna, get the hell out of here.
[02:44:49.940 --> 02:44:51.680]   He gets to the airport, he leaves.
[02:44:51.680 --> 02:44:54.480]   Those photographs get sent to the agency
[02:44:54.480 --> 02:44:56.860]   and then they do the operation with Mossad
[02:44:56.860 --> 02:44:58.500]   and Mugna is dead.
[02:44:58.500 --> 02:45:02.900]   Now the truth about that being a co-CIA mission
[02:45:02.900 --> 02:45:06.420]   was not reported for many years after the fact.
[02:45:06.420 --> 02:45:08.300]   It was originally, Mossad took credit
[02:45:08.300 --> 02:45:11.580]   as the CIA often likes to just give other people credit.
[02:45:11.580 --> 02:45:12.980]   They just want the job done.
[02:45:12.980 --> 02:45:15.860]   - Well, speaking of Mossad,
[02:45:15.860 --> 02:45:19.420]   what in your understanding of all the intelligence agencies,
[02:45:19.420 --> 02:45:21.220]   what are the strengths and weaknesses
[02:45:21.220 --> 02:45:25.200]   of the different intelligence agencies out there?
[02:45:25.200 --> 02:45:28.560]   CIA, Mossad, MI6,
[02:45:28.560 --> 02:45:34.340]   SVR and FSB and Chinese intelligence,
[02:45:34.340 --> 02:45:35.480]   all this kind of stuff.
[02:45:35.480 --> 02:45:38.160]   Is there some interesting differences, insights
[02:45:38.160 --> 02:45:41.440]   that you have from all your studying of CIA?
[02:45:41.440 --> 02:45:43.000]   - That's a really interesting question.
[02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:46.720]   I don't know and here's why.
[02:45:46.720 --> 02:45:49.400]   It's because I've never interviewed any intelligence officer
[02:45:49.400 --> 02:45:51.540]   with those other agencies.
[02:45:51.540 --> 02:45:57.780]   I've interviewed a couple people with Shin Bet in Israel,
[02:45:57.780 --> 02:46:02.780]   but until I speak to an actual source whose job it was,
[02:46:02.780 --> 02:46:06.940]   I don't know.
[02:46:06.940 --> 02:46:08.620]   And so the information that I'm getting
[02:46:08.620 --> 02:46:12.540]   is based on perception of others,
[02:46:12.540 --> 02:46:15.460]   which one would think would be deeply clouded
[02:46:15.460 --> 02:46:17.500]   by the idea that America is the greatest.
[02:46:18.160 --> 02:46:19.000]   - Right.
[02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:19.820]   - Right.
[02:46:19.820 --> 02:46:20.660]   (laughing)
[02:46:20.660 --> 02:46:21.580]   - Right, right.
[02:46:21.580 --> 02:46:23.220]   - We're better than them, you know?
[02:46:23.220 --> 02:46:25.460]   - Yes, well, actually the fascinating thing
[02:46:25.460 --> 02:46:29.260]   is 'cause you've spoken to a lot of people about the CIA.
[02:46:29.260 --> 02:46:30.900]   How do you know they're telling the truth?
[02:46:30.900 --> 02:46:33.660]   Like how do you, and this actually probably applies
[02:46:33.660 --> 02:46:38.660]   generally to your interviews with very secretive people.
[02:46:38.660 --> 02:46:41.340]   How do you get past the bullshit?
[02:46:41.340 --> 02:46:45.500]   - Well, that's just like multiple sourcing, right?
[02:46:45.500 --> 02:46:49.380]   So you find the story out, and then you have to,
[02:46:49.380 --> 02:46:51.980]   you go to the National Archives and you find the operation,
[02:46:51.980 --> 02:46:53.300]   and then you learn all about this,
[02:46:53.300 --> 02:46:55.920]   and then you interview other people who were there,
[02:46:55.920 --> 02:46:58.940]   and you put the story together to the best of your ability,
[02:46:58.940 --> 02:47:02.420]   and you make very specific choices with quote,
[02:47:02.420 --> 02:47:06.060]   so-and-so said, end quote, said so-and-so, right?
[02:47:06.060 --> 02:47:11.060]   And very rarely do I report on a single source,
[02:47:11.060 --> 02:47:13.380]   as I did in the end of Area 51.
[02:47:13.380 --> 02:47:18.340]   And then it says, essentially, look, dear reader,
[02:47:18.340 --> 02:47:21.380]   this is what the source told me.
[02:47:21.380 --> 02:47:23.620]   I have no way of corroborating it.
[02:47:23.620 --> 02:47:25.460]   This is legit, and here it is.
[02:47:25.460 --> 02:47:30.460]   So that's an area to make your reader comfortable
[02:47:30.460 --> 02:47:32.820]   with the information that they're being given.
[02:47:32.820 --> 02:47:35.300]   And then in all of my books,
[02:47:35.300 --> 02:47:37.380]   whether they're three or 400 pages,
[02:47:37.380 --> 02:47:39.860]   there's always 100 pages of notes at the end.
[02:47:39.860 --> 02:47:42.340]   So you can see all the sourcing,
[02:47:42.340 --> 02:47:45.420]   and you can begin to get an understanding
[02:47:45.420 --> 02:47:49.420]   of how journalism in the national security world works.
[02:47:49.420 --> 02:47:51.860]   And also, great opportunity for me to say,
[02:47:51.860 --> 02:47:54.160]   I'm often standing on the shoulders
[02:47:54.160 --> 02:47:57.940]   of journalists before me who did an incredible job
[02:47:57.940 --> 02:48:00.340]   digging into something and being able to report
[02:48:00.340 --> 02:48:01.520]   what they knew.
[02:48:01.520 --> 02:48:04.580]   Often the books are 10, 20, 30 years old,
[02:48:04.580 --> 02:48:07.300]   and so much more has come to light since.
[02:48:07.300 --> 02:48:10.740]   - And I also would just like to say that I appreciate
[02:48:10.740 --> 02:48:13.820]   that you said, great question, I don't know.
[02:48:13.820 --> 02:48:17.580]   Not enough people say, I don't know,
[02:48:17.580 --> 02:48:20.300]   and that's a sign of a great journalist.
[02:48:20.300 --> 02:48:22.700]   But speaking about things you might not know about,
[02:48:22.700 --> 02:48:24.620]   (laughing)
[02:48:24.620 --> 02:48:28.680]   let me ask you about something going on currently.
[02:48:28.680 --> 02:48:34.640]   So recently, Alexei Navalny died in prison,
[02:48:34.640 --> 02:48:38.140]   perhaps was killed in prison.
[02:48:39.060 --> 02:48:41.780]   What's your sense from looking at it?
[02:48:41.780 --> 02:48:44.840]   Do you think he died of natural causes in prison?
[02:48:44.840 --> 02:48:47.180]   Do you think it's possible he was assassinated?
[02:48:47.180 --> 02:48:52.620]   Russia, Ukraine, Mossad, CIA,
[02:48:52.620 --> 02:48:56.960]   whoever has interest in this particular war.
[02:48:56.960 --> 02:49:01.860]   - For that, I look directly to the historical record, right?
[02:49:01.860 --> 02:49:05.260]   Having written about Russian assassination campaigns
[02:49:05.260 --> 02:49:09.980]   and programs since the earliest days of the Cold War, right?
[02:49:09.980 --> 02:49:14.100]   And Russia has a long history of assassinating,
[02:49:14.100 --> 02:49:16.560]   murdering, dissidents.
[02:49:16.560 --> 02:49:21.220]   And in "Surprise, Kill, Vanish," I tell the story
[02:49:21.220 --> 02:49:26.220]   of an actual KGB assassin named Kolkoff,
[02:49:26.220 --> 02:49:32.100]   who knocked on the door of the man he was assigned to kill
[02:49:33.100 --> 02:49:35.340]   of the man he was assigned to kill.
[02:49:35.340 --> 02:49:37.100]   And by the way, this all comes from a book
[02:49:37.100 --> 02:49:38.300]   that Kolkoff wrote later, right?
[02:49:38.300 --> 02:49:39.780]   'Cause he defected to the United States.
[02:49:39.780 --> 02:49:43.080]   He knocks on the door and the guy answers the door.
[02:49:43.080 --> 02:49:45.780]   And instead of killing him, he has like this moment
[02:49:45.780 --> 02:49:49.620]   of conscious of crisis or crisis of conscience
[02:49:49.620 --> 02:49:51.500]   and says like, "I can't kill you,
[02:49:51.500 --> 02:49:53.580]   even though that's what I'm supposed to do."
[02:49:53.580 --> 02:49:57.420]   And then sits down with the guy and together decides,
[02:49:57.420 --> 02:49:59.060]   okay, we're gonna defect.
[02:49:59.060 --> 02:50:03.540]   You know, we're gonna let the Western intelligence agencies
[02:50:03.540 --> 02:50:04.860]   know what we're doing here.
[02:50:04.860 --> 02:50:06.980]   And the CIA got involved.
[02:50:06.980 --> 02:50:11.980]   But Russian assassins were able to poison Kolkoff
[02:50:11.980 --> 02:50:14.180]   with polonium.
[02:50:14.180 --> 02:50:16.740]   What happens to him is insane and it's a miracle
[02:50:16.740 --> 02:50:18.460]   he didn't die, but he doesn't.
[02:50:18.460 --> 02:50:20.660]   And then he defects to the West and he writes these books.
[02:50:20.660 --> 02:50:23.080]   And he tells lots of incredible secrets
[02:50:23.080 --> 02:50:25.460]   about the Russian assassination programs
[02:50:25.460 --> 02:50:27.340]   and their poison labs.
[02:50:27.340 --> 02:50:28.940]   And they're really, really, really interesting.
[02:50:28.940 --> 02:50:32.060]   And so to answer that question, I mean, to my eye,
[02:50:32.060 --> 02:50:34.740]   of course I don't know, but it certainly looks like
[02:50:34.740 --> 02:50:39.140]   Russia is acting in the same vein that it has always acted,
[02:50:39.140 --> 02:50:42.140]   taking care of dissidents that go against mother Russia.
[02:50:42.140 --> 02:50:46.440]   - So in the style of KGB assassinations,
[02:50:46.440 --> 02:50:51.460]   is there something you can comment on
[02:50:51.460 --> 02:50:56.700]   about the ways that KGB operates versus the CIA
[02:50:56.700 --> 02:50:59.460]   when we look at the history of the two organizations,
[02:50:59.460 --> 02:51:04.460]   the Cold War, after World War II, and leading up to today?
[02:51:04.460 --> 02:51:08.780]   - I mean, my feeling on that is always that
[02:51:08.780 --> 02:51:15.320]   there's a thread somewhere in declassified documentation
[02:51:15.320 --> 02:51:20.380]   about these programs of America working
[02:51:22.180 --> 02:51:27.180]   to maintain a semblance of democratic ideals,
[02:51:27.180 --> 02:51:31.420]   however surprising that may be, right?
[02:51:31.420 --> 02:51:36.000]   In other words, always trying to,
[02:51:36.000 --> 02:51:38.460]   I don't wanna say fight fair
[02:51:38.460 --> 02:51:40.500]   because killing people isn't fair,
[02:51:40.500 --> 02:51:45.500]   but versus a certain ruthlessness,
[02:51:47.540 --> 02:51:52.540]   a real sinister totalitarian type ruthlessness,
[02:51:52.540 --> 02:51:56.700]   certainly from Soviet Russia.
[02:51:56.700 --> 02:52:00.340]   I'm far less familiar with modern day
[02:52:00.340 --> 02:52:03.420]   Russian assassination activities,
[02:52:03.420 --> 02:52:07.540]   although we certainly know on the record that they exist.
[02:52:07.540 --> 02:52:09.840]   Some people have done great reporting on that.
[02:52:09.840 --> 02:52:17.180]   But there seems to be a kind of almost a sadism
[02:52:17.460 --> 02:52:19.100]   about the Russian programs
[02:52:19.100 --> 02:52:24.100]   that I personally have not seen in the American programs.
[02:52:24.100 --> 02:52:26.620]   - What about on the surveillance side?
[02:52:26.620 --> 02:52:31.100]   It seems like America's pretty good at mass surveillance,
[02:52:31.100 --> 02:52:33.220]   or at least has been revealed through NSA
[02:52:33.220 --> 02:52:38.220]   and all this kind of reporting and leaks and whistleblowers.
[02:52:38.220 --> 02:52:44.260]   Can you comment to the degree to how much surveillance
[02:52:44.260 --> 02:52:47.540]   is done by the US government internally and externally?
[02:52:47.540 --> 02:52:50.940]   - If you'd asked me five years ago,
[02:52:50.940 --> 02:52:52.520]   I would have had a very different answer, right?
[02:52:52.520 --> 02:52:54.700]   Because, all right, first of all,
[02:52:54.700 --> 02:52:56.300]   they're looking for a needle in the haystack,
[02:52:56.300 --> 02:52:57.500]   they're looking for the bin Laden,
[02:52:57.500 --> 02:52:59.340]   and they can't find the needle in the haystack,
[02:52:59.340 --> 02:53:01.620]   but they continue to create the haystack
[02:53:01.620 --> 02:53:04.260]   and survey the haystack, right?
[02:53:04.260 --> 02:53:07.540]   Okay, but the real problem, what has happened,
[02:53:07.540 --> 02:53:09.660]   and I write about this in my book, "First Platoon,"
[02:53:09.660 --> 02:53:11.420]   which is about a group of young soldiers
[02:53:11.420 --> 02:53:14.780]   who goes to Afghanistan and unwittingly becomes part
[02:53:14.780 --> 02:53:19.780]   of the Defense Department's efforts to capture biometrics
[02:53:19.780 --> 02:53:24.060]   on 85% of the population of Afghanistan, okay?
[02:53:24.060 --> 02:53:27.060]   Which, by the way, China then emulated
[02:53:27.060 --> 02:53:30.300]   in their own biometric surveillance program, right?
[02:53:30.300 --> 02:53:33.920]   And I think this is a terrible idea.
[02:53:33.920 --> 02:53:37.180]   But what has happened, these biometric systems
[02:53:37.180 --> 02:53:39.300]   that have been created, and biometrics are, of course,
[02:53:39.300 --> 02:53:44.300]   fingerprints, facial images, DNA, and iris scans,
[02:53:44.300 --> 02:53:50.620]   that allow you to tag, track, and locate people, okay?
[02:53:50.620 --> 02:53:54.060]   And what has happened in the five years
[02:53:54.060 --> 02:53:57.620]   since this question was first on everybody's minds
[02:53:57.620 --> 02:54:02.620]   about NSA surveillance is that the civilian sector companies
[02:54:02.620 --> 02:54:06.940]   have essentially done all the Defense Department's
[02:54:06.940 --> 02:54:09.300]   biometric surveillance job for them.
[02:54:09.300 --> 02:54:14.080]   By all of us sharing our facially recognizable images
[02:54:14.080 --> 02:54:17.020]   on Instagram and Facebook and everywhere else, X,
[02:54:17.020 --> 02:54:19.740]   by sharing information,
[02:54:19.740 --> 02:54:22.140]   by writing up narratives about ourselves,
[02:54:22.140 --> 02:54:28.020]   this information has become part of the database.
[02:54:28.020 --> 02:54:31.020]   Five years ago, when I was reporting "First Platoon,"
[02:54:31.020 --> 02:54:34.140]   I was interviewing the police chief of El Segundo,
[02:54:34.140 --> 02:54:36.180]   which is kind of like on the outskirts of LA.
[02:54:36.180 --> 02:54:37.700]   It's right near the airport.
[02:54:37.700 --> 02:54:38.700]   And why it's important is
[02:54:38.700 --> 02:54:41.380]   'cause it's like defense contractor haven, okay?
[02:54:41.380 --> 02:54:44.980]   So they have massive surveillance.
[02:54:44.980 --> 02:54:47.220]   And Chief Whalen, when I posed this question to him,
[02:54:47.220 --> 02:54:49.780]   he said to me, "Annie, let me show you something."
[02:54:49.780 --> 02:54:51.780]   And he had Clearwater AI,
[02:54:51.780 --> 02:54:55.260]   the recognition software, on his phone.
[02:54:55.260 --> 02:54:57.740]   And this was still when it was quasi not supposed
[02:54:57.740 --> 02:55:00.740]   to have that for law enforcement.
[02:55:00.740 --> 02:55:02.740]   And he said, "I want you to go down the block,
[02:55:02.740 --> 02:55:04.880]   "and I want you to just turn the corner
[02:55:04.880 --> 02:55:07.020]   "and come back toward me," right?
[02:55:07.020 --> 02:55:08.140]   Which I did.
[02:55:08.140 --> 02:55:10.660]   And he just didn't even hold up his phone.
[02:55:10.660 --> 02:55:12.700]   He just kind of looked like his hand,
[02:55:12.700 --> 02:55:14.300]   and his phone was on me.
[02:55:14.300 --> 02:55:15.120]   And he went back down.
[02:55:15.120 --> 02:55:17.300]   It was like tiniest movement.
[02:55:17.300 --> 02:55:19.100]   And when I came back to him, he went like this,
[02:55:19.100 --> 02:55:20.540]   and he showed me.
[02:55:20.540 --> 02:55:24.580]   There I was, everything about me.
[02:55:24.580 --> 02:55:29.580]   Everything about me, facts and figures and all images.
[02:55:29.580 --> 02:55:33.180]   And he knew who I was before I even got to him.
[02:55:34.180 --> 02:55:36.940]   So is that a good thing or a bad thing?
[02:55:36.940 --> 02:55:39.080]   I mean, we could have another three-hour conversation
[02:55:39.080 --> 02:55:40.720]   about that alone.
[02:55:40.720 --> 02:55:42.920]   - So you're saying more and more,
[02:55:42.920 --> 02:55:45.320]   you don't need an NSA,
[02:55:45.320 --> 02:55:48.120]   where we're giving over the data ourselves.
[02:55:48.120 --> 02:55:49.160]   - Yeah.
[02:55:49.160 --> 02:55:51.160]   - Publicly or semi-publicly.
[02:55:51.160 --> 02:55:52.000]   - Yeah.
[02:55:52.000 --> 02:55:52.900]   During the war on terror,
[02:55:52.900 --> 02:55:54.720]   people were just like incensed to learn
[02:55:54.720 --> 02:55:56.920]   that there's a drone that's flying
[02:55:56.920 --> 02:55:58.760]   at something like 20,000 feet.
[02:55:58.760 --> 02:56:00.920]   It's called Argus-Is, right?
[02:56:00.920 --> 02:56:05.100]   And it can capture the,
[02:56:05.100 --> 02:56:06.260]   it's not a license plate.
[02:56:06.260 --> 02:56:07.820]   It's like it can basically capture
[02:56:07.820 --> 02:56:09.420]   like what's written on a golf ball
[02:56:09.420 --> 02:56:12.460]   from 17,000 feet, 20,000 feet up, okay?
[02:56:12.460 --> 02:56:14.300]   And people went crazy over this.
[02:56:14.300 --> 02:56:17.740]   Like, "Oh my God, it's Big Brother."
[02:56:17.740 --> 02:56:21.340]   Well, one of the lead engineers on that, Pat Bilkin,
[02:56:21.340 --> 02:56:22.620]   is someone I talk to regularly
[02:56:22.620 --> 02:56:24.140]   because we talk about surveillance a lot
[02:56:24.140 --> 02:56:26.380]   'cause he thinks about it a lot 'cause he has kids now.
[02:56:26.400 --> 02:56:31.040]   And he has given so much thoughtful,
[02:56:31.040 --> 02:56:32.360]   really thinks about this issue
[02:56:32.360 --> 02:56:34.760]   because he believes just like you stated
[02:56:34.760 --> 02:56:37.800]   that what we are turning over about ourselves
[02:56:37.800 --> 02:56:42.000]   actually exceeds anything that Argus-Is could do from above
[02:56:42.000 --> 02:56:43.600]   because we're doing it willfully.
[02:56:43.600 --> 02:56:46.480]   And so what it's doing is it's creating an ability
[02:56:46.480 --> 02:56:49.540]   for if someone wants to know about you,
[02:56:49.540 --> 02:56:51.640]   if someone, let's say in government,
[02:56:51.640 --> 02:56:53.980]   wants to know about Lex Friedman,
[02:56:53.980 --> 02:56:56.000]   they can find out everything about you.
[02:56:56.000 --> 02:56:59.040]   And then that gets used for tagging, tracking,
[02:56:59.040 --> 02:57:02.640]   and ultimately, in the war theater,
[02:57:02.640 --> 02:57:04.320]   it was called find, fix, finish.
[02:57:04.320 --> 02:57:07.720]   Well, what do you think the finish is in that statement?
[02:57:07.720 --> 02:57:08.600]   It's not pleasant.
[02:57:08.600 --> 02:57:10.560]   It's called a drone strike.
[02:57:10.560 --> 02:57:13.760]   Find, find him with the biometric,
[02:57:13.760 --> 02:57:16.280]   fix him, meaning fix his position.
[02:57:16.280 --> 02:57:18.200]   We know he's moving in a car.
[02:57:18.200 --> 02:57:20.560]   That's him, that's him, finish him.
[02:57:20.560 --> 02:57:23.640]   Call it in, drone strike, boom.
[02:57:24.480 --> 02:57:26.980]   If we could return to nuclear war,
[02:57:26.980 --> 02:57:32.560]   you've briefly mentioned that a lot of things
[02:57:32.560 --> 02:57:36.120]   go back to the Third Reich and Hitler.
[02:57:36.120 --> 02:57:39.240]   If we go back to World War II,
[02:57:39.240 --> 02:57:42.280]   we look at Hiroshima and Nagasaki,
[02:57:42.280 --> 02:57:43.760]   the dropping of the two bombs.
[02:57:43.760 --> 02:57:47.160]   I would love to get your opinion
[02:57:47.160 --> 02:57:49.640]   on whether we should or shouldn't have done that
[02:57:49.640 --> 02:57:52.520]   and also to get your opinion on what would have happened
[02:57:52.520 --> 02:57:56.480]   if Hitler and Germany built the bomb first.
[02:57:56.480 --> 02:57:57.720]   Do you think it was possible
[02:57:57.720 --> 02:57:59.480]   he could have built the bomb first?
[02:57:59.480 --> 02:58:06.240]   In my researching Third Reich weapons
[02:58:06.240 --> 02:58:07.520]   for Operation Paperclip,
[02:58:07.520 --> 02:58:11.360]   because of course we got a lot of those scientists after.
[02:58:11.360 --> 02:58:12.520]   It's another great book
[02:58:12.520 --> 02:58:16.600]   in a terrifyingly complicated operation.
[02:58:16.600 --> 02:58:17.420]   Yes.
[02:58:18.600 --> 02:58:22.680]   At what point do the ends justify the means, right?
[02:58:22.680 --> 02:58:26.040]   But in looking at those programs,
[02:58:26.040 --> 02:58:30.180]   and we acquired Hitler's favorite weapons designers,
[02:58:30.180 --> 02:58:32.380]   and I'm talking about weapons of mass destruction
[02:58:32.380 --> 02:58:35.120]   like chemical weapons and biological weapons.
[02:58:35.120 --> 02:58:38.360]   But of course, America was ahead in the nuclear program,
[02:58:38.360 --> 02:58:42.280]   and an interesting detail reading Albert Speer's memoirs
[02:58:42.280 --> 02:58:47.280]   was Speer referring to a conversation he had with Hitler
[02:58:47.440 --> 02:58:51.280]   where Hitler said, "No, I don't wanna do that.
[02:58:51.280 --> 02:58:53.680]   "That's Jewish science."
[02:58:53.680 --> 02:58:58.680]   And so because of Hitler's own racial ethnic prejudices,
[02:58:58.680 --> 02:59:01.880]   they didn't develop the bomb, right?
[02:59:01.880 --> 02:59:05.100]   As far as should we have dropped the bombs on Hiroshima,
[02:59:05.100 --> 02:59:07.840]   I've interviewed all kinds of people
[02:59:07.840 --> 02:59:08.740]   with different opinions,
[02:59:08.740 --> 02:59:10.640]   most of them that had ended the war.
[02:59:10.640 --> 02:59:14.900]   The best interview and most meaningful perhaps
[02:59:14.900 --> 02:59:16.520]   that I ever did was with Al O'Donnell
[02:59:16.520 --> 02:59:19.200]   who was a participant in the Battle of Okinawa,
[02:59:19.200 --> 02:59:21.340]   which was like this insane,
[02:59:21.340 --> 02:59:25.240]   just to read stories about Okinawa,
[02:59:25.240 --> 02:59:28.000]   it makes your hair stand on end.
[02:59:28.000 --> 02:59:31.400]   And O'Donnell, like so many others,
[02:59:31.400 --> 02:59:36.400]   was slated to invade mainland Japan
[02:59:36.400 --> 02:59:40.700]   to his almost certain death, right?
[02:59:40.700 --> 02:59:44.840]   So somebody like that, it makes sense right from the get-go
[02:59:44.840 --> 02:59:48.880]   why he would be pro nuclear weapons.
[02:59:48.880 --> 02:59:51.320]   It saved his own personal life
[02:59:51.320 --> 02:59:55.200]   and it saved everyone that he knew that he was fighting with
[02:59:55.200 --> 02:59:57.400]   and it ended the war.
[02:59:57.400 --> 03:00:00.560]   - Do you think it sent a signal?
[03:00:00.560 --> 03:00:03.160]   Like without that, we wouldn't have known perhaps
[03:00:03.160 --> 03:00:05.480]   about the power of the weapons.
[03:00:05.480 --> 03:00:10.480]   So in the long arc of that history, 70 years plus,
[03:00:13.520 --> 03:00:17.480]   it is the reason why deterrence has worked so far.
[03:00:17.480 --> 03:00:21.760]   - Yes, that's an interesting thought.
[03:00:21.760 --> 03:00:26.760]   My thought goes to this idea that like of more, right?
[03:00:26.760 --> 03:00:28.840]   That everybody always wants more.
[03:00:28.840 --> 03:00:32.760]   It's a very dangerous, it's like more power, literally,
[03:00:32.760 --> 03:00:35.120]   not just figure it, more power, right?
[03:00:35.120 --> 03:00:39.080]   And what is more confounding to me
[03:00:39.080 --> 03:00:44.080]   beyond the fact that we dropped two atomic bombs
[03:00:44.080 --> 03:00:47.780]   on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the war ended
[03:00:47.780 --> 03:00:50.720]   is that this decision was then made
[03:00:50.720 --> 03:00:54.080]   to develop the thermonuclear bomb,
[03:00:54.080 --> 03:00:56.840]   a force that is such,
[03:00:56.840 --> 03:01:01.080]   the degree of magnitude of that power is mind boggling.
[03:01:01.080 --> 03:01:05.760]   I mean, even projects within the Manhattan Project
[03:01:05.760 --> 03:01:08.680]   defined thermonuclear weapon,
[03:01:08.680 --> 03:01:12.320]   the thermonuclear weapon as the evil thing.
[03:01:12.320 --> 03:01:15.640]   Like it was evil, it's a weapon of genocide.
[03:01:15.640 --> 03:01:19.200]   Atomic weapons destroy cities.
[03:01:19.200 --> 03:01:26.060]   Thermonuclear weapons destroy civilizations.
[03:01:26.060 --> 03:01:30.800]   - You opened the book with a Churchill quote,
[03:01:30.800 --> 03:01:34.000]   "The story of the human race is war,
[03:01:34.000 --> 03:01:37.520]   except for brief and precarious interludes,
[03:01:37.520 --> 03:01:40.280]   there has never been peace in the world.
[03:01:40.280 --> 03:01:42.600]   And before history began,
[03:01:42.600 --> 03:01:46.800]   murderous strife was universal and unending."
[03:01:46.800 --> 03:01:50.780]   Do you think there will always be war?
[03:01:50.780 --> 03:01:56.360]   Do you think that there is some deep human way
[03:01:56.360 --> 03:01:58.160]   in which we're tending
[03:01:58.160 --> 03:02:00.980]   to this kind of global war eternally?
[03:02:02.900 --> 03:02:05.640]   - Well, the optimistic answer of that would be
[03:02:05.640 --> 03:02:09.080]   that we could evolve beyond that, right?
[03:02:09.080 --> 03:02:13.060]   Because certainly if we look at our ancestors,
[03:02:13.060 --> 03:02:17.620]   they had not developed their consciousness
[03:02:17.620 --> 03:02:20.820]   as far as we have
[03:02:20.820 --> 03:02:24.600]   to be able to build the tools that we have.
[03:02:24.600 --> 03:02:29.600]   And so the hopeful answer is we will evolve beyond
[03:02:30.260 --> 03:02:34.600]   this kind of brute force, kill the other guy attitude.
[03:02:34.600 --> 03:02:39.660]   Certainly, these are questions
[03:02:39.660 --> 03:02:43.020]   that will become more obvious over time.
[03:02:43.020 --> 03:02:47.940]   I just want to play my little part in this world
[03:02:47.940 --> 03:02:51.160]   that I live in as the storyteller
[03:02:51.160 --> 03:02:54.020]   who brings information to people
[03:02:54.020 --> 03:02:58.100]   so that they can have these kinds of questions
[03:02:59.260 --> 03:03:02.740]   with themselves, with their friends, with their families.
[03:03:02.740 --> 03:03:05.820]   And I think in asking that very question,
[03:03:05.820 --> 03:03:07.620]   what you're really saying is
[03:03:07.620 --> 03:03:12.620]   why don't we evolve beyond war fighting?
[03:03:12.620 --> 03:03:17.060]   - It is very possible.
[03:03:17.060 --> 03:03:20.900]   And your book is such a stark and powerful reminder
[03:03:20.900 --> 03:03:24.920]   that human civilization as we know it ends in this century.
[03:03:26.300 --> 03:03:31.300]   Let's say it's a good motivator to get our shit together.
[03:03:31.300 --> 03:03:37.700]   - But aren't you really saying
[03:03:37.700 --> 03:03:41.440]   human civilization could end, not it ends?
[03:03:41.440 --> 03:03:44.240]   - Could end. - Could end.
[03:03:44.240 --> 03:03:49.620]   - But the power of our weapons is growing rapidly.
[03:03:49.620 --> 03:03:52.180]   So.
[03:03:52.180 --> 03:03:54.980]   - As they say, it's time to come back from the brink, right?
[03:03:54.980 --> 03:03:57.020]   And it's time to have that discussion
[03:03:57.020 --> 03:03:58.940]   while we're still talking.
[03:03:58.940 --> 03:04:02.780]   - And there's another complexity
[03:04:02.780 --> 03:04:04.420]   sneaking up into the picture
[03:04:04.420 --> 03:04:07.900]   in the form of artificial intelligence.
[03:04:07.900 --> 03:04:12.900]   And in cyber war, but also in hot war,
[03:04:12.900 --> 03:04:15.020]   the use of autonomous weapons,
[03:04:15.020 --> 03:04:18.540]   all of it starts becoming super complicated
[03:04:18.540 --> 03:04:22.660]   as we delegate some of these decisions about war,
[03:04:22.660 --> 03:04:25.620]   including nuclear war, to more and more autonomy
[03:04:25.620 --> 03:04:27.940]   and artificial intelligence systems.
[03:04:27.940 --> 03:04:30.800]   It's gonna be a very interesting century.
[03:04:30.800 --> 03:04:33.780]   Do you, just to zoom out a little bit,
[03:04:33.780 --> 03:04:36.860]   hope that we become a multi-planetary species?
[03:04:36.860 --> 03:04:38.200]   - I'm all for adventure.
[03:04:38.200 --> 03:04:44.100]   - And I too, while I'm for adventure,
[03:04:44.100 --> 03:04:47.900]   I'm all for backups in all forms.
[03:04:47.900 --> 03:04:51.300]   So I hope that humans start a civilization on Mars
[03:04:51.300 --> 03:04:53.260]   and beyond out in space.
[03:04:53.260 --> 03:04:56.300]   And if you zoom out on across all of it,
[03:04:56.300 --> 03:05:00.420]   what gives you hope about human civilization,
[03:05:00.420 --> 03:05:02.660]   about this whole thing we have going on here?
[03:05:02.660 --> 03:05:05.960]   - I mean, I am a fundamentally optimistic person.
[03:05:05.960 --> 03:05:07.780]   I must've come out of the chute that way
[03:05:07.780 --> 03:05:09.420]   because I just am, right?
[03:05:09.420 --> 03:05:12.440]   Even though I write about really grim things,
[03:05:12.440 --> 03:05:15.460]   I get inspired by them
[03:05:15.460 --> 03:05:17.860]   because I do always believe in evolution, right?
[03:05:17.860 --> 03:05:20.780]   I also have like the greatest family ever.
[03:05:20.780 --> 03:05:23.740]   Two kids, Jet and Finley, shout out to them.
[03:05:23.740 --> 03:05:26.160]   They're Lex Friedman fans, you know?
[03:05:26.160 --> 03:05:27.200]   - Oh yes.
[03:05:27.200 --> 03:05:29.700]   - And my husband.
[03:05:29.700 --> 03:05:32.900]   And you know, so what inspires me is like this idea
[03:05:32.900 --> 03:05:33.720]   of legacy.
[03:05:33.720 --> 03:05:37.060]   I think that you always wanna have your eye
[03:05:37.060 --> 03:05:40.660]   on being a good example to the best that you can.
[03:05:40.660 --> 03:05:43.780]   And so, and passing on what you know
[03:05:43.780 --> 03:05:47.340]   and believing kind of in the next generation.
[03:05:47.340 --> 03:05:49.460]   And again, that's a sentiment echoed
[03:05:49.460 --> 03:05:51.740]   by all these cold warriors I've been talking to
[03:05:51.740 --> 03:05:53.940]   because they also share that.
[03:05:53.940 --> 03:05:59.060]   That idea that, wow, look at what we have done
[03:05:59.060 --> 03:06:01.260]   as a civilization and look where we're going,
[03:06:01.260 --> 03:06:06.260]   whether it's exoplanetary travel or AI.
[03:06:06.260 --> 03:06:12.900]   It's just that the human factor of like the desire to fight,
[03:06:12.900 --> 03:06:17.900]   the desire to have conflict needs to be reconfigured
[03:06:17.900 --> 03:06:22.900]   because with all these new technologies that we have,
[03:06:22.900 --> 03:06:27.300]   the peril is growing at an accelerating pace,
[03:06:27.300 --> 03:06:31.220]   perhaps faster than the average human can keep up with.
[03:06:31.220 --> 03:06:34.700]   - Well, Annie, thank you for being a wonderful example
[03:06:34.700 --> 03:06:38.860]   of a great journalist, a great writer, a great human being.
[03:06:38.860 --> 03:06:41.000]   And I'm a big fan of yours.
[03:06:41.000 --> 03:06:43.660]   It's a huge honor to meet you, to talk with you today.
[03:06:43.660 --> 03:06:46.060]   So thank you so much for talking today.
[03:06:46.060 --> 03:06:47.960]   - Thank you for having me.
[03:06:47.960 --> 03:06:49.620]   - Thank you for listening to this conversation
[03:06:49.620 --> 03:06:51.060]   with Annie Jacobson.
[03:06:51.060 --> 03:06:52.300]   To support this podcast,
[03:06:52.300 --> 03:06:54.940]   please check out our sponsors in the description.
[03:06:54.940 --> 03:06:56.900]   And now, let me leave you with some words
[03:06:56.900 --> 03:06:58.660]   from John F. Kennedy.
[03:06:58.660 --> 03:07:03.420]   "The very word secrecy is repugnant
[03:07:03.420 --> 03:07:05.340]   in a free and open society.
[03:07:05.340 --> 03:07:07.660]   And we are, as a people inherently
[03:07:07.660 --> 03:07:10.220]   and historically opposed to secret societies,
[03:07:10.220 --> 03:07:13.780]   to secret oaths and to secret proceedings."
[03:07:13.780 --> 03:07:18.140]   Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
[03:07:18.140 --> 03:07:20.720]   (upbeat music)
[03:07:20.720 --> 03:07:23.300]   (upbeat music)
[03:07:23.300 --> 03:07:25.360]   you
[03:07:25.360 --> 03:07:33.040]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
