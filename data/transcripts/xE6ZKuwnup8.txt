[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.440]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:08.040]   I'm a resident physician in internal medicine
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.320]   at a large research institution.
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.400]   I'm struggling to make deep work part of my routine.
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.280]   For me, deep work consists of doing clinical research,
[00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:17.880]   staying up to date on the literature,
[00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.120]   and studying for board exams.
[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.400]   The structure of my days changes every two to four weeks,
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.760]   with some blocks of intensive 10 to 12-hour shifts,
[00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.320]   other blocks with a more typical 9 to 5 schedule,
[00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.440]   and very occasional, quote unquote,
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.520]   "research blocks" of unstructured time.
[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.160]   My one day off a week varies from one week to the next.
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.880]   When I'm at work, I do have unpredictable periods
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.240]   of relative quiet, but my door is open, my pager is on,
[00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.680]   and there's always the possibility
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.960]   it's truly an emergency.
[00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.920]   In order to become so good they can't ignore me,
[00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.520]   I aspire to become a productive researcher in addition
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.120]   to a skilled clinician.
[00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.240]   How should I approach this?
[00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:59.280]   Well, it's a good question.
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.160]   I get asked these type of questions a lot.
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.600]   There's a lot of concern/interest right now
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.760]   among physicians when it comes to issues of concentration
[00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.000]   and distraction.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.960]   You would be surprised, for example,
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.960]   how often I'm invited to speak at Grand Rounds.
[00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.960]   I get a bunch of these invitations,
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.080]   because doctors care a lot about this.
[00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.280]   So I want to start with that.
[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.040]   You're not alone in having this question.
[00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.520]   The second thing I want to do here is a reality check.
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.680]   Your clinical schedule setup right now, as described,
[00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:33.960]   is very demanding.
[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.960]   That is a lot of work you are doing,
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.640]   and it is difficult, cognitively demanding work.
[00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.480]   The reality is the reality.
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.520]   I don't know that it's possible for you to prepare for boards
[00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.080]   and do a significant amount of original research
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.560]   at the same time that you have such a difficult schedule.
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.000]   Because it sounds like you're doing shifts,
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.600]   these 12-hour shifts, and then you
[00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.760]   have 9 to 5 clinical hours sort of outside of those shifts,
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.240]   and you're only having one day off.
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.920]   That's actually quite a heavy load.
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.440]   So I don't know if this is good news or bad news,
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.800]   but I'm basically giving you permission to slow down here
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.360]   a little bit.
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.040]   If boards are the next thing that's coming up,
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.240]   that's what you should be focusing on.
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.280]   And then after boards, if you want to figure out
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.280]   how to do research, again, you can
[00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.680]   work with these existing research blocks
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.200]   and be highly effective in the time.
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.160]   That might work for you.
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.000]   But you might have to find a way to reconfigure your situation.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.360]   I mean, you have to keep in mind that the really killer MD
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.960]   research types that have the great academic positions
[00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.120]   at the big schools, I mean, they work a lot,
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.240]   but they probably aren't working the same schedule
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.680]   that you're talking about here.
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.400]   I mean, they have research labs.
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.480]   They have more significant time when they're just
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:44.320]   working on that research.
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.760]   You're already starting from a high point of view.
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.520]   So this is what I want to say to you here,
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.600]   is let's reality check, have a little bit more
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:51.560]   self-compassion here.
[00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.320]   You can't do all those things at the same time.
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.720]   Work on your clinical skills, pass your boards,
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.520]   figure out, OK, what's the next research thing I want to do?
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:01.800]   Do I have time for it?
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.320]   If not, are there changes I can make that would free up
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.160]   more time for it?
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.560]   And if the answer is no, the type of clinical position
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.200]   I have makes it very hard to do research, then maybe you say,
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.360]   let me just focus on killing it--
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.880]   that's probably the absolute worst adjective to use there--
[00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.560]   but killing it in my clinical work
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.440]   and doing that really well.
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.400]   Or shifting to an academic position
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.680]   in which a lot more time is given
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:25.760]   for the non-clinical work.
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.720]   But it's all about reality checks here.
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.480]   It's easy to fall into a trap where you say,
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.360]   it would be great if I could do x and y and z.
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.640]   But oftentimes, it's impossible to do x and y and z
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:39.400]   at the same time.
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.120]   Take it from someone who falls into that trap all the time
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.760]   and constantly has to step back out again,
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.680]   constantly has to re-simplify things again.
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.200]   There's only so much time you have.
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.160]   And I think it's OK.
[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.120]   I think it's OK to recognize that.
[00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.480]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.060]   (upbeat music)
