[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.140]   Hey guys, welcome to the Everyday Educator, where we explore the beauty and the challenges
[00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:15.540]   and the timeless truths of classical home education.
[00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:21.120]   I'm your host today, Lisa Bailey, and I'm really excited to spend some time with you
[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:28.580]   sharing about all the joys and all the challenges that our homeschool journey presents to us.
[00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:35.280]   Now, whether you are just considering this homeschooling possibility, or if you're deep
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.460]   into the daily delight of family learning, I think we're going to enjoy our conversation
[00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:40.980]   today.
[00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:47.300]   But I want you to remember that although our online community is awesome, you will find
[00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.740]   even closer support in a local CC community.
[00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:58.960]   So go to classicalconversations.com and find a community near you today.
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.660]   Well, guys, I'm super excited to welcome two guests today.
[00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:10.380]   We've got Courtney Bradshaw and Sarah Harrigan with us, and they are going to talk to us about
[00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.940]   something that I have always admired, but never really had to do myself.
[00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:23.560]   That is homeschool multiple children, like a large number of children.
[00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.520]   And I'm going to get them to introduce themselves and their families.
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:35.300]   And you guys prepare to be blessed because I will tell you that the Lord has led these ladies
[00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.600]   on their journey, and He continues to lead them.
[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.680]   And they're just going to share with you from the overflow of what God has provided for them.
[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.520]   Courtney, tell us a little bit about your family.
[00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.080]   Well, I'm married to a pastor, and we have seven children.
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:57.500]   Our oldest is 18, and we'll be starting her freshman year of college this year.
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.900]   And our youngest is a toddler.
[00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.240]   So you've got the spread.
[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.180]   Yes.
[00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.340]   So this is very good.
[00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.620]   Listeners, you get your pencils poised.
[00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:14.660]   That means that Courtney has insights on almost grown children and barely begun children.
[00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.420]   And so you get ready.
[00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.700]   Okay, Sarah, tell us about your family.
[00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.580]   So we're pretty close.
[00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.680]   We have eight children, and we span from 24 to three.
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.780]   And so we have graduated.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.380]   We call them our upper deck, our middle deck, and our poop deck.
[00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:41.180]   And so the two oldest have both gone through Classical Conversations, and we've launched
[00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.560]   them.
[00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:42.860]   So it is doable.
[00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.440]   And yeah, that's really great.
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.960]   So you know what it looks like from before, during, and after.
[00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.480]   So that's really good.
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.260]   Yeah.
[00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.820]   That's really good.
[00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:02.660]   Well, I think that we're all going to learn a lot from one another and from you lovely
[00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:03.040]   ladies.
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.500]   So, Courtney, you have seven children.
[00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.620]   And how many?
[00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.280]   So one is going off to college just in a week or so.
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.260]   I know.
[00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:13.600]   It's good.
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.220]   We'll come back to that.
[00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.860]   It is good.
[00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:16.900]   Keep reminding yourself.
[00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:17.560]   This is good.
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.400]   I've always been working myself out of a job, but now that I have, it's still good.
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.820]   Okay.
[00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.520]   So you are current, how many are you currently homeschooling?
[00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.720]   Because I know some of them are too little to really be formally homeschooling.
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:31.320]   Yes.
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.540]   So five of the seven will be, are currently homeschooling.
[00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.420]   The youngest of those five is turned seven yesterday.
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.940]   And so we have them, she's seven.
[00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.180]   And then we have three foundations age.
[00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.900]   And one of those will have his first year of essentials.
[00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.100]   And then we have two challenge age this year.
[00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.880]   And then just the one that's not yet schooling.
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.320]   Not yet ready to school, but ready to be involved in everything.
[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.560]   Oh, yes.
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:08.100]   And we'll talk about that too, because sometimes that's a bigger challenge than challenge is.
[00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.900]   So did, let me ask you this.
[00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.340]   Do you come from a big family yourself?
[00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.220]   Were you born into a big family?
[00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:17.800]   I have one sister.
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.080]   Okay.
[00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.880]   All right.
[00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:27.720]   So no, not a big family, nor was it something that I thought would happen or dreamed of.
[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.360]   But we had three biological children.
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:41.080]   The Lord brought three to our home through adoption and then surprised us two years ago with our little caboose.
[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.240]   Oh, that is so awesome.
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.120]   The Lord smiles upon His children and He rewards.
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.940]   And so I feel like He rewarded you with that joy.
[00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.880]   Did you always plan to homeschool?
[00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.140]   I did not.
[00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:01.860]   My mom worked full time, but she was always available for everything.
[00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:07.480]   Every, we did traditional public school and private schooling.
[00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:12.160]   And she was there for every game, every sporting event, every assembly.
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.700]   And I knew I wanted a job.
[00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.520]   I just assumed I would go into the workforce.
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.720]   I wanted a job where I could do that.
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:31.900]   But as kindergarten grew closer and I was staying home, I just, I felt that it was not right for her, for my oldest to leave.
[00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.100]   And so I wasn't ready.
[00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:35.500]   And I'm still not ready, but I'm ready.
[00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.120]   Yeah, I know.
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.240]   She might be ready.
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.900]   You're ready than she was at five.
[00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:40.500]   Yes.
[00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:40.820]   Okay.
[00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:48.000]   So you just kind of moved into homeschooling as a, we're not going to do the school thing yet.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:54.780]   And it just kept going and you kept adding to your, to your class or to your home.
[00:05:54.780 --> 00:06:08.540]   How, when you started with your five-year-old, were you homeschooling classically or you were just kind of, a lot of us start kindergarten, just hodgepodging, thinking, well, we can't really mess them up.
[00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:09.060]   They're five.
[00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:09.740]   Right.
[00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:11.160]   That was a thought in my mind.
[00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:17.640]   And we were very traditional kind of schooling and tried to just figure it out.
[00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:19.760]   I do not have an educational background.
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:24.300]   And so I'm a nurse by, I guess.
[00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:32.160]   And so I went with something scripted that I could say, you write this, you, on the board, you say this.
[00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:43.400]   And we found classical conversations when she was in second grade and kind of did a mixture of both for a couple of years.
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:47.120]   And then we transitioned as we went along.
[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:48.200]   Yeah.
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:52.400]   Did the Lord build your confidence in homeschooling as you went?
[00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:53.460]   Absolutely.
[00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:58.060]   And sometimes I'm more humbled as we move along.
[00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:10.420]   But definitely the confidence has grown as they get older and especially having been easily accepted into college, because that's what scares you sometimes, I think.
[00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:15.160]   But seeing all of those things, my confidence grew.
[00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.700]   And it wasn't long before we knew this was for us.
[00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:19.800]   Mm-hmm.
[00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:20.520]   For always.
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.280]   That's great.
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:23.100]   That's great.
[00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:30.360]   And so as you added children to your homeschool, it just became easier or harder?
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:32.060]   And we'll get specifics in a minute.
[00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:34.380]   Yes.
[00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:39.840]   And I think it depends on what you think about with easier or harder.
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:47.920]   The knowing how to teach them and what to do next and what to expect for the most part was at least familiar.
[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:50.500]   It was more familiar as we went along.
[00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:51.440]   There you go.
[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:52.500]   That's a good answer.
[00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:54.200]   I think that's true for everybody.
[00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:59.240]   The first one is always like, oh, my goodness, am I going to screw this up?
[00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:01.180]   Sarah, is that how it was for you?
[00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:07.080]   Did you come from a big family and then you just fell into having a big family?
[00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:08.880]   How did it work?
[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:10.060]   No.
[00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:12.200]   So I was the oldest of five.
[00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:13.380]   So not small.
[00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:14.260]   Pretty average.
[00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:26.380]   And then we had kind of – particularly my husband grew to be more parently and to figure out what it was like to be a dad and enjoy it.
[00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:27.940]   And so we've got a pretty big span.
[00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:28.080]   And so we've got a pretty big span.
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:30.080]   It's almost five.
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:30.080]   You do.
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:31.320]   Yeah.
[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:36.340]   And then you watch where the dam broke because then they're like 16, 18 months apart.
[00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:42.020]   And it really was this moment of why are we thinking the way we're thinking?
[00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:45.280]   And so what were we saving for?
[00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:47.160]   What was it that we were aiming for?
[00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:53.340]   And we realized that it was kind of that keeping up with the Joneses, not having enough faith.
[00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:56.480]   My husband owned a logging company at the time.
[00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:03.300]   And so it was sometimes hand-to-mouth type of provision.
[00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:05.420]   And so that kept us hostage.
[00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:15.580]   But once we opened our hand and we just said whatever the Lord brings us is what he brings us, not only did we get the blessings – and I don't believe it's for everybody.
[00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:16.700]   That was our conviction.
[00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:17.680]   Sure.
[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:25.800]   We saw the blessings and the provision just skyrocket and the benefits and the way our home was run.
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:43.420]   And so it was really that just continuing to chip away of us not even consciously knowing that we were grabbing onto things of this world and that was holding us back to finally open up and say, oh, this is what God has called us to do.
[00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:47.780]   And we're okay with whatever that looks like.
[00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:52.080]   So that's how we came to have such a large family.
[00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.640]   God did it.
[00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:54.620]   God did it.
[00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:54.940]   Absolutely.
[00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:55.520]   God brought you.
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:10:05.060]   God brought you the family he had always designed for you to have because you were open to following what he was doing.
[00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:06.480]   I think that's super cool.
[00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:15.340]   Now, did you think, you know, 25 years ago, did you think that you would be a homeschooling mom?
[00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:17.880]   No, not at all.
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:31.220]   I grew up in a very small rural town in Nebraska and there was one homeschool family and it was typical, like made their own curtain close, kind of stayed out of the sunlight.
[00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:32.900]   Very taboo homeschool.
[00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:39.720]   My daughter, when she was young, she used to call those homeschoolers painfully homeschooled.
[00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:43.720]   I would say when she went to college, have you met any other homeschoolers?
[00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:50.240]   Yes, I've found a bunch of CC people because, you know, they all recite memory work when they raise their hand to answer something in class.
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:53.360]   And she said, but there's some that are painfully homeschooled, mom.
[00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:54.680]   And that's what she meant.
[00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:55.720]   That is a great description.
[00:10:55.720 --> 00:11:03.120]   You know, they just were so sheltered or so set apart in a different way.
[00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:03.680]   Yeah.
[00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:04.040]   Yeah.
[00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:05.700]   So that was my only exposure.
[00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:10.280]   And again, going back to what my husband did, we lived on the job about nine months out of the year.
[00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:15.360]   So once my daughter became school aged, I'm like, ooh, what do I do with her?
[00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:25.620]   And so I know I've dramatized it by now, but I just remember walking down into this public school ramp and it was dark with like,
[00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:27.440]   34 kids and one adult.
[00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:31.500]   And like Lisa, I thought, I can do better than this.
[00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:32.840]   Like, I can do better.
[00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:34.700]   So I did what everybody did.
[00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:36.280]   She was a firstborn girl.
[00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:43.060]   So we did a Becca and we sat at that table and we did the worksheets and she was great.
[00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:47.780]   And then we hit, I was lonely and she was bored.
[00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:49.880]   And so I just prayed.
[00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:55.600]   I'm like, Lord, you either need to change our heart about this conviction or you need to bring something new.
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:12:01.700]   And praise God, a military family brought CeCe and we went to that information meeting.
[00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:05.000]   And I will be honest, I sat back and I hated it.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.920]   And I thought, this is the most archaic idea I've ever heard of.
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:11.460]   Was it because of all the memory work?
[00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:13.300]   Did it just seem very regimented?
[00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:15.440]   It was just so foreign to me.
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:16.140]   Yes.
[00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:20.320]   I, you know, again, my exposure was public private or Sunday school.
[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:20.940]   Yes.
[00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:25.040]   And so it was edutainment or a conveyor belt.
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:31.580]   And so this idea of memorization or investment in that way was just so foreign.
[00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:32.800]   But my husband loved it.
[00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:34.400]   And of course we jumped in.
[00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:35.260]   Yes.
[00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:38.060]   And jumped in with nothing.
[00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:41.380]   We didn't know anything, which will answer your, did I know classical?
[00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:42.780]   No, not at all.
[00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:43.280]   Yeah.
[00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:47.980]   But we were obedient and we trusted and we did it.
[00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:53.540]   And back then, you know, a lot of stuff was just paper clipped together and stapled.
[00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:57.680]   So I know we did it so poorly for the longest.
[00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:05.140]   We did it so differently because the resources, because we got in, you know, when, when my girls
[00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:06.420]   were second grade and fifth grade.
[00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:07.660]   So it was way back.
[00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:11.960]   We're talking lots of additions of the foundation's curriculum ago.
[00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:16.680]   And, and there were, you know, there was nothing online.
[00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:18.440]   There was barely an online.
[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:26.680]   And so we were just doing, like you said, doing, following the light as it was cast on
[00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:33.540]   the path right in front of where you were walking, you know, were you, Sarah, were you worried
[00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:40.720]   about being the homeschool teacher, especially as you started adding kids?
[00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:46.600]   Like, did you guys watch or read Little House on the Prairie or Anne of Green Gables where there's
[00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:54.200]   this 16 year old in a class with a bunch of kids of all different ages and, and they always
[00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:58.960]   managed to hold the attention of the children and everybody seemed to be learning the right
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:13:59.400]   thing.
[00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:05.200]   I remember thinking, I could no more have done that when I was 16 than I could have, you
[00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:07.620]   know, rode a Bucking Bronco at 16.
[00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:08.820]   I mean, what in the world?
[00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:12.400]   Did you worry about that, that you weren't equal to the task?
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:20.120]   Um, I think by the organic nature of my lineup, like I said, I had that oldest, very compliant
[00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:24.680]   and then I had a bunch of boys and then we'd be crazy.
[00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:25.780]   Yeah.
[00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:32.580]   And so that started, I mean, I still, to this day will default to what is familiar in there,
[00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:34.020]   that modern education mindset.
[00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:40.200]   But once I was able to chip away and keep it off, that gave such freedoms.
[00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:45.900]   So I think when I broke the, we have to be at the table, it has to be a work.
[00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:46.420]   Okay.
[00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:46.800]   Okay.
[00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:52.500]   It has to, like that gave such freedom to, oh, this is a relationship with knowledge.
[00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:53.820]   This is a journey.
[00:14:53.820 --> 00:15:00.400]   Then I didn't do the comparison of, am I keeping up with the public school system or the people
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:01.320]   around me?
[00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:04.500]   And everybody doing their grade level work kind of thing.
[00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:05.000]   Yeah.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:05.380]   Yeah.
[00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:12.380]   So that's, I think what opened that idea, like you're referencing of that one room schoolhouse
[00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:17.800]   for us was a, it was necessity because we needed to get the things done.
[00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:26.160]   I had, I wanted to do it well, so I needed to narrow, um, how much work I did so that the
[00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:27.220]   quality was there.
[00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:31.580]   And then finally it was, this is the way it was designed.
[00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:35.580]   It's actually backwards to the way I, it's the right way.
[00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:38.660]   I was, I was, I was trained in the wrong way.
[00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:39.400]   Right.
[00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:40.140]   Right.
[00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:40.500]   Right.
[00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:44.980]   That how we learned looking back was not the best way.
[00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:51.260]   And even like for those of us who were good students, maybe because I was one of those first
[00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:52.700]   born compliant daughters.
[00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:54.780]   So I probably would have been okay.
[00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:55.360]   Yeah.
[00:15:55.360 --> 00:16:00.520]   Courtney, no matter what it was, I was going to do the thing and do it well.
[00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:07.920]   And I just like to read and I like to learn things, but some kids, um, need to have, they
[00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:14.620]   need to be caught their love for knowledge needs to be seeded and you have to grow it
[00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:15.140]   up.
[00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:20.960]   Um, I love what you're saying, Courtney, did you find it to be true that you were just looking
[00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:26.240]   for a way to do fewer things well for your kids?
[00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:27.520]   Oh, yes.
[00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:36.000]   We, we combine a lot of things regardless of their age group, because it, I love the way
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:41.620]   that you said that Sarah, is that I need to be able to do less things, but do them well.
[00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:47.860]   Um, I need to, to have me for less, um, or else we can't get through everything.
[00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:54.540]   If we try to do every grade level at every moment, I don't have that kind of attention span.
[00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:57.020]   I don't have that kind of attention span.
[00:16:57.020 --> 00:17:05.840]   Well, I feel like that's what everybody, I talk to a lot of families, um, at practicums.
[00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:13.200]   And so I have lots of people who will come up and say, but now I have four or five or six
[00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:13.780]   kids.
[00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:19.800]   And how am I supposed to keep up with all of the fill in the blank, all of the math
[00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:23.120]   lessons, all of the books that they're reading?
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:30.240]   How do I make sure that everybody is getting, I really can't do all of fourth grade and seventh
[00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:33.940]   grade and 10th grade and 11th grade, all of that.
[00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:43.080]   And so what you ladies are saying is the, the grade construct is kind of a false thing.
[00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:51.600]   You are, you are, there are a lot of things that you can do together that are building the
[00:17:51.600 --> 00:18:02.920]   skills of learning that your children can use different books or different, um, math lessons
[00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:05.320]   to learn the same concept.
[00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:09.700]   And so you worry about the concept and then they use whatever they need.
[00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:13.880]   Is that kind of what you're, what you're saying?
[00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:16.200]   Yeah, I think absolutely.
[00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:22.900]   I think the other thing that is vitally important is once you get to a place where, um, you can
[00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:29.900]   empower your older children to help, you've got that same thing that we see in community
[00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:32.580]   with our, um, classrooms.
[00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:39.360]   You are either reflecting back, helping to remind those that maybe don't know the concept or know
[00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:46.300]   the, the answer, but it's also inspiring to where they can head and not limiting them and
[00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:48.960]   giving them a vision for, Oh, big brother does this.
[00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:55.240]   And so I'm sure we'll get into the heart issues of, of this concept as well, but that's the
[00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:57.300]   other thing that we need to say out loud.
[00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:03.540]   And I think it's applicable if you have two kiddos or if you have 10 is empowering that environment
[00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:08.520]   of learning of, yes, I am the lead learner of this group.
[00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:13.740]   I am the mother and the authoritarian and your teacher, but your big brother also can sit on
[00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:17.560]   the couch and read with you or do math flashcards.
[00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:22.640]   And it's great for him because he gets to sharpen his spelling or his reading by reading
[00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:23.580]   aloud or listening.
[00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:28.660]   And he also needs to go back to his timetables because he needs to remember this.
[00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:29.100]   Yeah.
[00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:32.400]   I know what, you know, you need to go do some basics.
[00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:32.760]   Yeah.
[00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:35.100]   I know how long it took you to factor that equation.
[00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:37.200]   Let's do the multiplication tables again.
[00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:39.740]   That's really a good point.
[00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:45.280]   I said that yesterday, my son had his very first day of challenge a, and then I needed
[00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:47.180]   to leave and I wouldn't be there today.
[00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:53.620]   And I said, your sister has had six years of planning her week with a challenge guide.
[00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:58.020]   She can sit with you and walk you through what you need to do tomorrow.
[00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:04.720]   She has read way more persuasive essays than I have.
[00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:08.600]   And she's more of an expert on that than I am.
[00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:12.360]   And so you can sit with your sister and she can help you.
[00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:15.060]   I had that conversation yesterday.
[00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:15.860]   Yeah.
[00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:22.380]   That is a, that's the beautiful part about having learners at all the stages.
[00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:23.860]   So yes, Sarah, you're right.
[00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:32.960]   You as the mom and dads too are lead learners in the home, but you have raised up lead learners
[00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:33.820]   in training.
[00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:37.120]   So they're at various stages of being good at it.
[00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:43.680]   And they are mentoring the people you're mentoring all your children, but your olders are mentoring
[00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:50.300]   your youngers and you know, your youngers are looking to say, Oh, I watched you do this
[00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:51.300]   challenge B thing.
[00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:55.060]   And I remember what was bad or what was hard.
[00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:56.540]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:20:56.540 --> 00:20:57.940]   I'm going to do this other thing.
[00:20:57.940 --> 00:20:59.620]   And so they learn from each other.
[00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:08.300]   I want y'all to think about what, what, what looks like it would be the hardest part of homeschooling
[00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:09.720]   multiple ages.
[00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:14.100]   And then what is the hardest part?
[00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:18.640]   I, I think for a lot of people, I'll be really honest.
[00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:26.160]   I think for a lot of people, it is what we've been talking about having so many into individual
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:28.400]   children with all these individual needs.
[00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:35.820]   And how can I mom, one person give all of my children, everything that they need.
[00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:38.440]   And you guys have perfectly answered that.
[00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:39.320]   Yeah.
[00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:46.620]   I mean, you can't, but you have other children and other, other trusted adults who are, who
[00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:48.920]   are speaking truth into their lives.
[00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:54.780]   So you're not giving them everything that they need, but they are getting what they need.
[00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:57.100]   What, what else have you guys heard?
[00:21:57.100 --> 00:22:01.860]   What do people say to you about your big family and homeschooling your big family?
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.180]   What do other people think is the hard part?
[00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:06.740]   The busyness.
[00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:11.720]   I think for me, everybody thinks, oh, you must be so busy all the time.
[00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:13.640]   And it is true.
[00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:17.600]   We are busy, especially as they get older.
[00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:21.720]   It's actually more busy than it is when they're really all little at the same time.
[00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:25.640]   Because they have their own interests and they want to go do things.
[00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:26.280]   Yes.
[00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:27.660]   It's different busy.
[00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:36.540]   And so most people think just, just to be a large family, regardless of homeschooling.
[00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:37.200]   Right.
[00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:39.800]   I think people think, how do you keep up with everything?
[00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:42.880]   I know you must be busy all the time.
[00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:45.780]   And yes, it is busy.
[00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:51.860]   But a lot of people, when it comes to homeschooling, I think it's the perception of schooling at home.
[00:22:52.600 --> 00:23:00.000]   But since we're not trying to recreate school at home, it's different than what they think.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.080]   It is busy.
[00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:04.200]   And when you say, what's the hardest part?
[00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:05.740]   Feeding them?
[00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:09.940]   Max all day long?
[00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:12.680]   Oh my gosh, that's so true.
[00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:14.500]   That's so true.
[00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:21.780]   I think the hardest part for me is, in a real honest moment, is the mental load of,
[00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:23.360]   When did everybody eat?
[00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:24.680]   Who needs what next?
[00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:31.280]   There are things, while we do a lot together, there are still individualized things that they need.
[00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:34.160]   Whether it is with school or not.
[00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:34.800]   Right.
[00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:38.620]   And so for that, it does take planning.
[00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:40.540]   It does take some organizing.
[00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:49.060]   I need to make sure everybody has their own little art bucket and their own school supplies that they can go get for themselves.
[00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:50.480]   I don't have to go and lay out everything.
[00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:52.200]   So you don't have to manage that.
[00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:52.700]   Right.
[00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:53.820]   And they have a list.
[00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:58.120]   We have checklists that they work through themselves and come when they need help.
[00:23:58.120 --> 00:24:05.580]   But that, it can be challenging and it can be overwhelming or, it's a high sensory.
[00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:17.340]   With all the noise and all the people and all the meals and all the crumbs and the toddler climbing on the table and, you know, that kind of thing.
[00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:20.400]   But it's, it's, yeah.
[00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:23.020]   So it's not quite what they, what people picture.
[00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:25.560]   Yes, it can be challenging.
[00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:30.200]   I mean, I think anything worth doing is hard at times.
[00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:31.040]   Right, right.
[00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:45.000]   And I imagine that you find your own ways to economize your efforts and that you find your own ways to, to band activities or needs together.
[00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:50.500]   Sarah, what do people say when you tell them you have eight children and you homeschooled all of them?
[00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:51.640]   What do they say?
[00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:53.140]   Wow.
[00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:53.520]   Okay.
[00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:56.060]   I'm going to filter a lot of what they say.
[00:24:56.060 --> 00:25:01.980]   You don't have to put names to their comments.
[00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:08.340]   So I think I definitely agree with Courtney.
[00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:11.100]   It is just, how do you juggle?
[00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:11.940]   How do you do it?
[00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:13.400]   How do you, you must be amazing.
[00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:14.980]   And, and we're not.
[00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:21.940]   Again, you become accustomed and you do, it's almost survival in some ways.
[00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:27.260]   You learn to say, this is what it takes for us to function well.
[00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:31.900]   And so for us, we're very routine just by the nature of our families.
[00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:33.600]   I wanted to ask you that.
[00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:34.340]   Yeah.
[00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:38.880]   So, you know, my 15 year old is a typical 15 year old.
[00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:42.560]   We're working on staying awake and doing some of those.
[00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:47.360]   He's a boy, you know, and his peers wake up at 10, 11.
[00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:51.280]   And that's just not how it rolls in our house.
[00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:51.820]   Nope.
[00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:56.100]   And so there are those lessons of, yes, it is chaotic.
[00:25:56.100 --> 00:26:03.120]   And yes, there are moments, but, um, there is tremendous privilege in knowing our home does
[00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:07.140]   look different and it's good for us to have those built-in routines.
[00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:13.940]   It teaches when you get a job, you will need to get up at a certain time and be on time and
[00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:16.760]   make sure you have time to dress appropriately.
[00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:24.460]   And so there's so many life things that just come in with a big family that also apply to being a
[00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:32.620]   respectful and integrous and professional adult that we are instilling that we don't even know.
[00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:38.800]   So I do agree that it's busy, but we find our way and it works differently for every family.
[00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:45.300]   Um, I think the question of what truly is hard, something that I've had to be very intentional
[00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:50.020]   about is that one-on-one time with families that are so big.
[00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:54.560]   I have my quiet wallflowers that, and, and they ebb and flow.
[00:26:54.560 --> 00:27:00.920]   We don't ever have a middle child, but you have symptoms of middle children that come in
[00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:03.700]   periodically as kind of the regime changes.
[00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:07.240]   And one kid is older and now they default to the younger.
[00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:13.360]   And, um, and so I have to be very conscious of who am I not talking to?
[00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:17.100]   Like the one that I shush a lot where I'm like, Hey, give me a minute.
[00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:21.380]   And then he just, he hangs his head and walks away.
[00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:23.500]   And I'm like, ah, dang it.
[00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:24.240]   Come back.
[00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:25.320]   I see you.
[00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:25.760]   Right.
[00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:26.220]   I see you.
[00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:26.620]   Yes.
[00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:28.100]   Maybe this was your minute.
[00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:30.020]   Maybe this needs to be your minute.
[00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:30.460]   Yes.
[00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:39.340]   But being so conscious of those, those individual moments, um, with them just takes intentionality.
[00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:40.140]   Yeah.
[00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:48.440]   I was going to ask y'all, you know, um, are there benefits to schooling a big family?
[00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:54.520]   And you alluded to some of those, Sarah, um, there are some things that just by virtue of,
[00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:56.840]   Hey, we live in a real world.
[00:27:56.840 --> 00:28:02.300]   And so everybody cannot have mama 24 seven every day.
[00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:05.580]   So you learn to, to be patient.
[00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:16.360]   You learn to solve some of your own little pieces or to go seek the advice of, of an older brother
[00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:17.120]   or sister.
[00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:23.420]   I think living in a big family teaches you mercy because it's not all about you.
[00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:25.980]   And there's always somebody who needs something.
[00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:27.380]   So it teaches you mercy.
[00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:30.340]   It teaches you to honor one another.
[00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:31.860]   There have, there are benefits.
[00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:32.980]   I like that.
[00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:39.500]   You said there are benefits like you learn to get up at a certain time, even if you don't
[00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:46.600]   want to and do things maybe on a schedule that would not be yours for the choosing for
[00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:52.560]   the greater good, because in order for us all to get out the door, we all need to start
[00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:54.160]   earlier than I wanted to.
[00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:57.760]   And so I think those are good benefits.
[00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:05.000]   Um, Courtney, what has homeschooling taught you about learning?
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:12.480]   And this might be because of a big family or just because like, it sounds like none of us
[00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:16.520]   grew up classically educated, right?
[00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:21.380]   So what has homeschooling taught you, Courtney, about learning?
[00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:27.080]   Um, I think I've learned a lot about learning.
[00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:34.240]   Um, just how we, um, develop mentally are prepared for things differently.
[00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:42.720]   And, um, but really with, with our, our span of ages and our children are very different.
[00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:51.840]   And so I have learned that there are many ways to learn and that some people, um, learn better
[00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:59.520]   differently than, than others, all of my children may be differently than you and differently than
[00:29:59.520 --> 00:29:59.820]   me.
[00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:08.560]   And then I've also come to, to learn and to trust, um, assessment with them is it doesn't look like
[00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:18.320]   a test and a grade, I can see what they have learned in a conversation much better than I can
[00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:19.440]   on paper.
[00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:24.140]   I have children with significant test anxiety and dyslexia.
[00:30:24.140 --> 00:30:30.440]   And so to regurgitate something is not easy, especially written on a piece of paper.
[00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:35.940]   So, um, but I know they understand when they can communicate with me about what they're
[00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:36.380]   doing.
[00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:44.520]   And, um, that particular thing is very different than what I thought I knew before this.
[00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:49.760]   Hey guys, I want to interrupt this show to tell you more about this semester's sponsor,
[00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:50.860]   Judson college.
[00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:55.900]   Judson college is such a perfect fit for CC students because they align with our Christian
[00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:58.380]   classical and community values.
[00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:03.180]   So as far as being Christian is concerned, Judson college equips students to give their
[00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:08.500]   lives for Christ cause, wherever he may call them, whether it's the marketplace or into official
[00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:14.280]   vocational ministry as a confessional institution rooted in scripture, the college is committed
[00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:20.300]   to providing theologically and biblically sound education, which is very important to you.
[00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:25.720]   We know, well, they also have a vibrant community and that plays a vital role in the students
[00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:27.700]   education at Judson college.
[00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:33.020]   They have small class sizes, which allow professors to intentionally invest in students, but they
[00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:39.180]   also have a house system where the students are allowed to have competitions, vibrant community
[00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:42.420]   and deep fellowship from freshman year to graduation.
[00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:47.740]   Lastly, Judson college does value classical thinking.
[00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:53.420]   They help develop critical thinkers and equip them to engage in the conversations around them.
[00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:56.180]   There's a great books course, which I think is really great.
[00:31:56.180 --> 00:31:59.620]   And it's integrated into every single one of their undergraduate degrees.
[00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:06.120]   So this provides a solid foundation in human ideas through primary texts, and they're all taught
[00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:09.400]   through a biblical worldview so that students don't just grow as scholars.

[00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:20.560]   distinctions forward slash.
[00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:21.840]   Let's get back to the show.
[00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:25.860]   That that that that's so true.
[00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:35.520]   I think and one of you alluded to it earlier that in high stress times or when we're anxious
[00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:44.480]   or worried or rushed or sometimes hungry or angry about something else in our educational at
[00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:48.540]   home, we revert back to what we know.
[00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:55.000]   It's just kind of like automatic, even if in your brain, you know, yeah, that was not that's not the
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:55.940]   best way to educate.
[00:32:55.940 --> 00:33:03.400]   It wasn't even the best way for me, but we revert back to that when we're worried or or on edge
[00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:06.220]   or fearful of something.
[00:33:06.220 --> 00:33:12.980]   And so just recognizing that there are better ways to learn and being able.
[00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:14.700]   I really admire what you said.
[00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:23.300]   You have taught yourself that there are better ways to assess the learning of your child.
[00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:31.420]   And I specifically love that you said conversation because that is the most important thing I've
[00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:37.540]   been for whatever reason, I have really been meditating on that whole idea over the last couple of
[00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:45.680]   weeks that that that community, I really do think is God's end game.
[00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:50.420]   I think community is what is is what it's about.
[00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:52.820]   And our first community is our family.
[00:33:53.100 --> 00:34:00.480]   So when we learn to look at one another and appreciate those differences, learning differences
[00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:11.720]   included and learn to serve one another's needs and to see somebody else as more important than
[00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:19.160]   ourselves and to realize that the greatest blessing of homeschooling is that we get to have a deep
[00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:26.320]   relationship with our children and that we get to feed that relationship all day, every day.
[00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:35.840]   What do you think, Sarah, that you have learned from homeschooling?
[00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:41.400]   What what has the Lord taught you, Sarah, while you, Sarah, have taught all your children?
[00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:47.060]   Um, so I am very competitive by nature.
[00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:49.080]   Oh, good to know.
[00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:51.580]   Yes, maybe not.
[00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:52.400]   At least I don't know.
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:59.220]   Um, and so I like to win and I like to know where the finish line is.
[00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:05.020]   And that's not how it works with gosh, learning and with education.
[00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:09.560]   And so again, or with children, for sure, not with children.
[00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:15.720]   And so I think there was that idea of some sort of mythical finish line of I have done
[00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:17.800]   it, you know, we've, we've launched.
[00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:24.400]   And when you, especially with my first two and coming there and not even in myself, but that
[00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:29.300]   was, like you said, that wasn't the end that actually launched us into this new relationship
[00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:31.860]   that we have been cultivating.
[00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:33.960]   That's the bummer about when they launch.
[00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:38.600]   And Courtney, I know you're feeling this now is they are such cool people that you want
[00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:39.540]   to hang out with.
[00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:40.840]   And you're like, wait a minute.
[00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:42.220]   I did all this work.
[00:35:42.220 --> 00:35:44.660]   So somebody else gets to hang out with this cool kid.
[00:35:44.660 --> 00:35:45.700]   That's right.
[00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:46.360]   That's right.
[00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:47.160]   Yeah.
[00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:54.240]   So I, I think for them, as well as for me to actually understand what it truly means that
[00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:55.280]   learning is a lifestyle.
[00:35:55.280 --> 00:36:00.020]   Now that I know I can learn anything, nothing is out of my grasp.
[00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:04.620]   That creates a hunger to learn.
[00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:10.480]   And now that I've kind of moved that finish line out and said, there isn't a finish line
[00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:12.140]   and you can learn anything.
[00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:14.880]   The world has now been opened up.
[00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:15.540]   Oh yeah.
[00:36:15.820 --> 00:36:22.460]   As a, as an adult to say, I get to do that through the vehicle of my children as I'm just
[00:36:22.460 --> 00:36:22.880]   learning.
[00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:24.180]   Cause I have insecurities.
[00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:26.400]   Math is definitely my kryptonite.
[00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:27.000]   Right.
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:31.020]   I get to hide behind that closed door and relearn it with them.
[00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:31.880]   Absolutely.
[00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:39.420]   I get to also extend that to every other subject and every other thing or person I encounter
[00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:45.460]   and say, I can look at that same thing and security or strength and look at it as an opportunity
[00:36:45.460 --> 00:36:48.860]   because I know how to learn and there's no finish line.
[00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:53.180]   It's just going on that journey through learning with other people.
[00:36:53.180 --> 00:36:54.140]   And I agree with you.
[00:36:54.140 --> 00:36:57.320]   Our family is the first place that we get to engage in and enjoy that.
[00:36:57.320 --> 00:36:57.840]   Yeah.
[00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:06.320]   Do you think, um, that you have passed that understanding on to your children?
[00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:10.900]   Do they get that learning is not done?
[00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:14.040]   Like when they graduated from high school, they're not finished.
[00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:19.340]   And when they graduate from college, they don't stop thinking about things or learning new things.
[00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:21.200]   Did you, did you pass that on to them?
[00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:21.840]   Do you think?
[00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:23.720]   Uh, absolutely.
[00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:28.560]   But I'm going to give credit to classical conversations for that because, and, and just
[00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:32.520]   the fact that it wasn't this formal bell ringing at the table.
[00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:38.140]   There wasn't, it was never told to them that there was some sort of imaginary line you crossed
[00:37:38.140 --> 00:37:38.680]   to be done.
[00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:44.560]   And so they were just going on, like both of my kids have gone into trades.
[00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:49.240]   My oldest is a professional chef and the oldest boy is a firefighter.
[00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:54.040]   And they were already moving on to the next thing before graduation even happened.
[00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:54.280]   Yeah.
[00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:56.200]   Because it was just, they had their eyes.
[00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:57.080]   Yeah.
[00:37:57.080 --> 00:37:59.280]   They're like, okay, I did that.
[00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:00.600]   And now I'd like to go learn this.
[00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:01.340]   Perfect.
[00:38:01.340 --> 00:38:03.400]   That's, that's exactly right.
[00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:04.040]   I love it.
[00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:05.360]   You, you are right.
[00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:12.500]   The, the classical conversations, the, the tools of learning and that whole idea that
[00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:20.560]   we are equipping our children to know how to learn so they can keep learning whatever piques
[00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:22.000]   their interest forever.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:26.140]   And that those skills are so applicable in the real world.
[00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:31.220]   Like my, my girls, um, are, are 28 and 32 now.
[00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:39.140]   And they, um, they have taken, it has been like one of the highlights of my life to see
[00:38:39.140 --> 00:38:43.040]   them take those skills of learning into their marriages.
[00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:50.400]   I have one daughter who says, oh yeah, her husband, they started making Annie charts when
[00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:57.080]   they would make decisions together and now he has taken Annie charts to his workplace and
[00:38:57.080 --> 00:39:03.680]   he, he, he said to makes Annie charts with his boss before they make company decisions.
[00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:12.180]   And just to know that, that they can, that they see those skills as not just academic skills,
[00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:17.560]   but life skills and that they have stayed interested in learning things.
[00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:21.720]   My daughter, my other daughter has recently decided that she wants to make bread from
[00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:22.340]   scratch.
[00:39:22.340 --> 00:39:29.460]   And she means like, daddy, will you grow some wheat on the farm so that, and I mean, so of
[00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:30.600]   course daddy did it.
[00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:37.200]   Um, and, and our, our oldest grandchild is helping him thresh the wheat with a rubber mallet.
[00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:41.380]   And so, I mean, now I'm looking for a way to grind that wheat into flour.
[00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:46.900]   I feel like the little red hen, but to think that she believed.
[00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:50.720]   That if I can think it, I can try it and I can do it.
[00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:55.020]   That lifelong learning thing is, that's a buzz.
[00:39:55.020 --> 00:39:57.400]   That's a really big buzz.
[00:39:57.400 --> 00:40:02.200]   Okay, Courtney, I know we have taught y'all, we have talked about all the things that are
[00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:03.100]   close to our hearts.
[00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:08.540]   Um, you know, what it's like to, to school a bunch of children, but we've talked a lot
[00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:11.100]   of philosophy and a lot of relational.
[00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:15.160]   I want to leave, I want to give people some really practical because there are people
[00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:17.440]   out there who are saying, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:18.560]   All that is really good.
[00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:19.460]   I believe it too.
[00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:20.260]   Conversation.
[00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:21.500]   I love my kids, big kids.
[00:40:21.500 --> 00:40:27.520]   What am I supposed to do with these little people who crawl on the table while we are trying
[00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:29.260]   to diagram sentences?
[00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:34.180]   And while I am trying to give them the four sentence purposes, what do I do with that child
[00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:36.060]   who is drawing on the wall?
[00:40:36.060 --> 00:40:42.640]   Um, so here, give us your best advice, Courtney, for littles.
[00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:49.020]   Those who aren't formally, because we know, I mean, I tell people lots of times, we homeschooled
[00:40:49.020 --> 00:40:54.260]   our children from birth because they, they were learning things even before we knew they
[00:40:54.260 --> 00:40:55.180]   were learning things.
[00:40:55.180 --> 00:41:00.660]   They were learning things, but the best advice for littles who aren't formally schooling in
[00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:04.320]   a big family, what in the world do you do with the littles, Courtney?
[00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:15.020]   The best advice I was ever given, and I'm not always the best at doing this, but is to spend
[00:41:15.020 --> 00:41:19.960]   time with them intentionally every morning before you start something else.
[00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:26.660]   Cuddle them, play with them for a few minutes, fill their cup so that they don't feel like
[00:41:26.660 --> 00:41:32.060]   they're always having to seek the attention because they started with it.
[00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:41.700]   Um, and that really, it really does help, um, for the most part, uh, I, I do, um, practically
[00:41:41.700 --> 00:41:47.720]   speaking, I try to assign different kids with the littles at times.
[00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:47.940]   Okay.
[00:41:47.940 --> 00:41:51.260]   I need you to go play with them right now.
[00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:57.420]   And, um, I need somebody to, to be on toddler duty, you know, while we do this.
[00:41:57.420 --> 00:42:06.360]   Um, I do think that have allowing them to have something that looks like what the other kids
[00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:07.360]   are doing is helpful.
[00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:13.880]   So we do a lot of dry erase markers and we'll set him in his high chair and give him dry
[00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:15.820]   erase markers to draw on the tray.
[00:42:15.820 --> 00:42:17.560]   Um, wow.
[00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:20.080]   Cause he will throw down the paper or eat it.
[00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:20.340]   Right.
[00:42:20.340 --> 00:42:23.940]   He's fine.
[00:42:23.940 --> 00:42:29.640]   And so, um, I think he's a, you know, girls are different than boys in a lot of ways.
[00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:32.380]   He's, he's, he's very active.
[00:42:32.380 --> 00:42:38.860]   So most things that used to be on shelves where even our younger kids could reach are those
[00:42:38.860 --> 00:42:43.600]   shelves, shelves are bare and everything up as he gets a little bit taller.
[00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:51.500]   Um, so you just have to be flexible and willing to adapt and it's okay to jump up.
[00:42:51.620 --> 00:42:58.640]   My kids are really used to me saying, um, just a minute and I run and grab or do, or somebody
[00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:03.760]   get him off the table or, you know, hand him that what you're using for sharing something
[00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:05.460]   that we say a lot in our house.
[00:43:05.460 --> 00:43:13.740]   Um, but yet he, he needs to be able to have something to do that looks like what they're
[00:43:13.740 --> 00:43:18.140]   doing because he loves books and he loves markers and he wants to do all the things that
[00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:18.800]   they are doing.
[00:43:19.220 --> 00:43:28.320]   But it really does help because those younger ones, because they have heard these things
[00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:32.020]   and seen these things forever for them.
[00:43:32.020 --> 00:43:32.720]   Right.
[00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:34.720]   Nothing is unfamiliar.
[00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:36.480]   The routine is not unfamiliar.
[00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:39.280]   They are able to just begin when it's their turn.
[00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:40.660]   That's really true.
[00:43:40.660 --> 00:43:42.580]   They teach themselves things.
[00:43:42.580 --> 00:43:45.300]   I mean, they're, you know, I, I had the first three.
[00:43:45.460 --> 00:43:51.220]   So the younger of those three was born the year, my oldest, the year we started homeschooling
[00:43:51.220 --> 00:43:51.520]   her.
[00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:57.000]   And so by four, he had taught himself to read and he would write his letters.
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:01.200]   I mean, his handwriting is, we'll show you now, but he would write the letters.
[00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:03.060]   He taught himself to write.
[00:44:03.060 --> 00:44:05.040]   He wanted to be a part of it.
[00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:07.920]   And he had heard those sounds his whole life.
[00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:12.700]   So, you know, so it was a little different with the next three because they didn't begin
[00:44:12.700 --> 00:44:13.940]   in our home.
[00:44:13.940 --> 00:44:21.220]   So they had some, it was like having them a first one again, but, but they, they're able
[00:44:21.220 --> 00:44:23.540]   to go farther, faster.
[00:44:23.540 --> 00:44:27.100]   Sometimes those are because they've heard it for so long.
[00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:32.080]   Yeah, I think that's back to that one room schoolhouse where, you know, the, the littlest
[00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:36.380]   ones would hear the recitations of the older ones.
[00:44:36.380 --> 00:44:41.780]   Maybe they were doing something else, but you know, you hear that enough.
[00:44:41.780 --> 00:44:48.440]   You remember, I can remember when we were memorizing Philippians with our older daughter.
[00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:53.340]   So she was four and we would, and we would put them, we did it right before bed.
[00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:55.620]   We would have stories and prayers and Bible verses.
[00:44:55.620 --> 00:45:00.200]   And so fresh out of the bath, the whole family was sitting there and the two-year-old was just
[00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:01.400]   kind of along for the ride.
[00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:05.960]   I thought until one night I said, okay, now y'all start the verses.
[00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:09.640]   And the two-year-old started the verse.
[00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:13.640]   And I thought, oh, I was not trying to teach you that.
[00:45:13.940 --> 00:45:19.640]   But like you said, Courtney, they absorb what they hear and what they see modeled.
[00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:21.100]   I really love that.
[00:45:21.100 --> 00:45:28.480]   I really, really, I hope people wrote down the idea, the wisdom about spending intentional
[00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:37.400]   time with them before your day begins, filling their cup so that they're not constantly looking
[00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:38.980]   for some filling.
[00:45:38.980 --> 00:45:40.160]   That's beautiful.
[00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:47.380]   All right, Sarah, I need your best tips for how to deal with the little people while the
[00:45:47.380 --> 00:45:53.580]   olders are getting, you know, there are times like our, our, our high schoolers, they could
[00:45:53.580 --> 00:45:59.000]   go away on their own and do some things without you starting.
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:03.700]   But then you've got those middle kids who might know what they're supposed to do, but they're
[00:46:03.700 --> 00:46:07.220]   not necessarily going to do it if you don't usher them into it.
[00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:11.020]   So what do you do when the littles are making circles around the table?
[00:46:11.020 --> 00:46:12.760]   Yeah.
[00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:17.400]   I think what I would advise is being very intentional with quiet time.
[00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:24.380]   The things that I need, I've got two essentials this year and then a foundations.
[00:46:24.380 --> 00:46:30.220]   And so I, I know, and my one is in his first tour and a boy for essentials.
[00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:36.840]   And so I'm already very strategic of the amount of time I personally need to sit with them.
[00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:43.560]   And so, you know, what that nap time usually is, is a break for me where I used to send
[00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:48.760]   them off and say, Hey, go do the flashcards or do the independent work so that I can catch
[00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:51.060]   up on the kitchen or do the things very important.
[00:46:51.060 --> 00:46:53.860]   But I'm having to rearrange to use that quiet time.
[00:46:53.860 --> 00:47:00.140]   Even those that don't nap, get them in that routine of just rest and whether you have to
[00:47:00.140 --> 00:47:04.280]   wean them on a screen for a little bit and say, Hey, you get the privilege to sit on the
[00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:09.960]   couch quietly with the screen for a few, for just 20, 30 minutes and move it to a book, you
[00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:11.400]   know, whatever your family is doing.
[00:47:11.820 --> 00:47:18.660]   But to really capitalize on those quiet pockets in your home and the things that need your
[00:47:18.660 --> 00:47:22.160]   attention with those middles to olders is when I do it.
[00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:25.360]   I also will say with my teenagers, and I am not a night owl.
[00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:27.220]   I am very much an early person.
[00:47:27.220 --> 00:47:27.780]   Yeah.
[00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:33.720]   I, I utilize, I stay up and I utilize the evening times to connect with my teenagers.
[00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:34.580]   Right.
[00:47:34.580 --> 00:47:36.040]   Because that's when they're ready.
[00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:37.020]   Yep.
[00:47:37.020 --> 00:47:37.720]   They're ready.
[00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:40.020]   The distractions are tucked in bed.
[00:47:40.420 --> 00:47:45.760]   So it's not as probably poetic and eloquent as I'm going to take Courtney's advice, but
[00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:47.280]   if you just went down and dirty.
[00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:52.320]   And then I do agree making them a part of it.
[00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:58.880]   Even if you've got babies, when they're reading aloud, have them have that baby on that 11 year
[00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:01.180]   old, 12 year old lap or next to them.
[00:48:01.180 --> 00:48:10.400]   And what a beautiful little example of having just her read out loud to that little sister.
[00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:13.560]   I mean, it'll warm your heart if you see it.
[00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:15.900]   It's just so, so beautiful.
[00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:21.660]   And so finding those other places, again, of integration and opportunity to say, yeah, I
[00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:24.600]   know they're going to squirm, but try it for five minutes.
[00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:25.400]   Just let her sit there.
[00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:26.940]   Grow into it.
[00:48:27.360 --> 00:48:27.740]   Yeah.
[00:48:27.740 --> 00:48:27.840]   Yeah.
[00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:28.140]   Yeah.
[00:48:28.140 --> 00:48:30.360]   I love that.
[00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:33.360]   Y'all have been so helpful.
[00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:38.540]   You have given us the big picture and some small practical things to try.
[00:48:38.540 --> 00:48:45.160]   I love that you didn't say, with a big family, you just have to be regimented and everybody's
[00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:47.420]   got to be on a schedule and we're going to march from thing to thing.
[00:48:47.420 --> 00:48:49.560]   I love it that it's more a rhythm.
[00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:50.820]   There's a rhythm.
[00:48:51.100 --> 00:48:56.340]   There are times where everybody knows that this is what we do first, or this is what we
[00:48:56.340 --> 00:49:02.480]   do second, or this is when we do fill in the blank, but you are respectful of the rhythms
[00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:06.100]   of your children and the ebb and flow of the home.
[00:49:06.100 --> 00:49:13.200]   And I like the way that you love on your kids and you teach them to love on and help one another.
[00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:19.200]   I got time for one more tip.
[00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:24.700]   So think really hard about your best tip.
[00:49:24.700 --> 00:49:28.200]   What is your best tip?
[00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:32.560]   And it doesn't have to be just for mothers of multiples.
[00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:41.720]   It can be your best tip for starting this homeschool year off right.
[00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:43.340]   Okay.
[00:49:43.340 --> 00:49:45.800]   So Courtney, what would you say?
[00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:52.440]   Plan, like plan a day or have a day or have a time, not a full day.
[00:49:52.440 --> 00:49:56.360]   That's to me, it's completely foreign.
[00:49:56.360 --> 00:49:57.840]   That's crazy talk there.
[00:49:57.840 --> 00:49:58.780]   That's crazy talk.
[00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:08.360]   Right now, but to have a moment where you can get ready for the week, so whatever that
[00:50:08.360 --> 00:50:13.520]   needs to look like, and that might be different for older kids and younger kids.
[00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:20.320]   But if I, if I try to sit down and there are times that I can open up something and we can
[00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:23.980]   just pull a lesson out and that is great.
[00:50:23.980 --> 00:50:32.760]   But for me, if it's going to get done, I have to have it done before and then I can open it
[00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:35.780]   up and say, hey, we're going to do this today and it's going to be fun.
[00:50:35.780 --> 00:50:42.520]   And so I'm not very fun mom at home with lessons and things like that.
[00:50:42.780 --> 00:50:51.320]   I want, I'd love to be, but I am more available to them if I have it organized ahead of time.
[00:50:51.320 --> 00:50:57.800]   So even if it's just a few minutes on a Sunday afternoon or I'll wake up sometimes Monday morning
[00:50:57.800 --> 00:51:02.600]   before they wake up and I have the week ready and we are ready to go.
[00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:09.440]   That is the thing for me, that is the most helpful because if I have to plant it on the
[00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:15.740]   fly, we're not going to do as many things as they might would like to do and to give yourself
[00:51:15.740 --> 00:51:19.260]   grace because it's going to be okay.
[00:51:19.260 --> 00:51:22.920]   The Lord will, he, he does handle these things.
[00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:29.640]   And, and I do pray that they won't remember the stressed out mom as much as they remember
[00:51:29.640 --> 00:51:35.960]   the times together sitting, um, and, but I also sometimes remember that I will remember
[00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:41.360]   that so that I can show them that grace when they are mamas and daddies, you know, um, but
[00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:46.500]   give yourself the grace you would give your best friend, you know, and say, speak to yourself
[00:51:46.500 --> 00:51:51.100]   kindly, um, um, because it, it can be difficult.
[00:51:51.100 --> 00:51:57.400]   Um, and if we are constantly criticizing ourselves, uh, then it feels really hard.
[00:51:57.400 --> 00:52:05.280]   Um, and if we're modeling that, that's not a good thing to model now, now that my babies
[00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:13.040]   have babies, I am really intentional about telling them what a good job they're doing and noticing
[00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:18.580]   the specific thing that they're doing and saying to them, you are doing a really good job of
[00:52:18.580 --> 00:52:18.900]   that.
[00:52:18.900 --> 00:52:21.620]   I think that you think nobody sees you.
[00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:26.900]   And I think we all need to know that somebody sees us.
[00:52:26.900 --> 00:52:32.060]   And the truth is that the Lord sees us and we are doing our best for him.
[00:52:32.060 --> 00:52:32.880]   And he sees us.
[00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:34.280]   I love that.
[00:52:34.280 --> 00:52:37.880]   Courtney, give yourself grace and plan a little bit.
[00:52:37.880 --> 00:52:43.400]   I mean, you know who you are, you know, I, I'm a planner too, and I have to get my mind
[00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:49.440]   straight so that I can wrap around all that stuff and then it can just flow out of me like
[00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:51.080]   it is, you know, just natural.
[00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:52.040]   It's not though.
[00:52:52.040 --> 00:52:54.720]   It's planned because I know who I am.
[00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:56.280]   So that's good advice.
[00:52:56.280 --> 00:52:56.980]   Know yourself.
[00:52:56.980 --> 00:53:03.780]   Sarah, what's your last great piece of advice for any parent starting the homeschool year off
[00:53:03.780 --> 00:53:04.060]   right?
[00:53:05.060 --> 00:53:05.480]   Okay.
[00:53:05.480 --> 00:53:08.700]   Well, first you've got to have something new.
[00:53:08.700 --> 00:53:11.120]   Like I just got my homeschool supplies.
[00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:20.140]   I love a new pack of erasers or pencils, or it does not have to be expensive, but it was
[00:53:20.140 --> 00:53:25.040]   the most fun of just like setting up those new pencils.
[00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:31.300]   It just is cathartic of we're starting over and, and we homeschool during the, most of
[00:53:31.300 --> 00:53:36.980]   us do, but I think that's the reset button is when we've got a couple new things in the
[00:53:36.980 --> 00:53:37.420]   school room.
[00:53:37.420 --> 00:53:42.920]   So whatever your budget, make a big deal about this new thing that's entering your school
[00:53:42.920 --> 00:53:44.360]   room or your dining room table.
[00:53:44.360 --> 00:53:47.640]   Cause everybody's like, okay, here we go.
[00:53:47.640 --> 00:53:50.820]   That's shot in the arm of good stuff.
[00:53:50.820 --> 00:53:54.760]   My girls used to love to go and buy notebooks.
[00:53:54.960 --> 00:53:56.440]   And so we have more binders.
[00:53:56.440 --> 00:54:01.000]   I tell everybody I know now, please do not go shop at Staples until you come to my basement.
[00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:05.100]   Cause I have 12 years time to of all the good.
[00:54:05.100 --> 00:54:08.680]   And I bought the good binders cause I got tired of the bad binders breaking.
[00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:13.060]   And because those challenge that's thick, some thick stuff there.
[00:54:13.060 --> 00:54:16.120]   And so that was really great.
[00:54:16.120 --> 00:54:17.920]   So that's a great piece of advice.
[00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:21.460]   Well, I appreciate you guys and I appreciate you listeners.
[00:54:21.460 --> 00:54:23.820]   That is a wrap on today.

[00:54:56.540 --> 00:55:05.100]   It is about cultivating wisdom and virtue and wonder with your own family and by extension
[00:55:05.100 --> 00:55:06.840]   with your larger community.
