[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.760]   I like it. All right, sounds good. All right. So we have all that coming up. Let's start. However,
[00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:11.280]   as I like to do with the deep dive, the topic I want to tackle in today's deep dive is the art of
[00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:20.000]   no. So saying no is a major part of my own professional life, because I'm someone who has
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.920]   multiple jobs with multiple demands and am somewhat in the public eye. So I have to spend
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.200]   more time saying no and thinking about how to say no and the ramifications of saying no,
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.360]   I would say than probably the average person. So it's something that I have thought a lot about.
[00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:41.200]   There's a couple observations I've always had about saying no. Number one, I think the average
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:50.240]   person creates this false binary between either you're someone who basically says yes, or you are
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:55.120]   a disagreeable person who says no. And they say, well, if those are my two choices, I don't want
[00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.320]   to be the disagreeable person. That seems stressful and emotionally taxing. So I'm just the person who
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.800]   who says yes, I kind of have to say yes, but seems at all like it would be difficult to say no.
[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:11.360]   The reality, though, is that everyone says no a lot, whether they know it or not, whether it's
[00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.520]   implicit or explicit. But if you think about it, most knowledge workers, you know, they have a
[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.480]   full schedule, usually about 20 percent more full than they want it to be, but not impossibly full.
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.480]   They're not working till 2 a.m., but maybe they're working till 6 p.m. It is highly unlikely
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:32.560]   that the exact volume of things that was put onto their plate that they said yes to just happened to
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:38.240]   exactly match an eight or nine hour day. Right. Almost certainly there is many more things coming
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.840]   at them and they had that they had to sort it through and they basically were implicitly or
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.400]   explicitly saying no, just enough to keep a day full. So we're already all saying no, even if we
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.080]   don't realize that we just do it somewhat haphazardly. And I wrote a New Yorker piece
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.600]   about this last fall where I said my theory about how most people informally handle the goal of
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.960]   saying no, they don't have a plan, they don't have an intention, they don't have a vision for what
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.320]   they're trying to accomplish. They instead wait until their level of experience stress
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:10.240]   is high enough that they feel emotionally justified turning someone down.
[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:16.560]   So it's like I am so overwhelmed right now, I feel justified saying no. And until that point,
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.160]   I don't. And what I argued in that New Yorker piece is that this is a terrible way to go about
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.120]   this because it ensures that you remain at a persistent level of elevated stress. If you have
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.880]   to be sufficiently stressed to feel comfortable saying no, then you're never gonna start saying
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.560]   no until you're sufficiently stressed. So you're gonna stay at this level of being sufficiently
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.440]   stressed, basically persistently. So when we are not intentional about how we filter what we do
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:46.480]   and don't do, we end up in this default purgatory, this productivity purgatory of having just a
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:53.040]   enough just enough on our plate that it is bearable, but uncomfortable. And we persist there.
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:59.520]   So we burn out and don't produce what we want and all the other negatives to come. So what we need
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:06.400]   to do is be more specific with ourselves about how we figure out what's a reasonable workload,
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.800]   what that workload should be made up of how we're going to go about dealing with requests to fit
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:16.880]   that load and not overload. We need to be more specific about it. That's why I was happy to see
[00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:23.440]   an article that someone sent to me, an alert listener sent to me, that appeared in a it's a
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:32.400]   column in the journal Nature. And it is written by four scientists. And it is titled, "Why Four
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:38.160]   Scientists Spent a Year Saying No" and it is an article that gets into the tactical weeds about
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:44.720]   the challenges and proper strategies for declining or turning away stuff that's going to overload
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.680]   you, turning away work. So I want to go through this article because I often harp about this,
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.360]   "Hey, you got to be more intentional about how you say yes or no," but we don't necessarily get
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:59.280]   into enough tactics about, "Well, how do I actually say no without feeling really bad
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.760]   or annoying people?" All right, so I have the article here. So those who are watching on YouTube,
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.920]   so you can find this at youtube.com/CalNewportMedia. You'll see on the screen that we have the date
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:16.800]   highlighted. This is from August 25th, so this is recent. Now the four scientists who wrote this
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:22.720]   column, their names don't show up in this version I have here, but probably relevant to this article,
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.760]   I believe all four are women. So that'll come up a little bit later. All right, so I want to
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.680]   highlight a couple things here. First, just to start, let's give the premise for what they were
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:37.680]   doing here before we get to their specific advice. So the premise is the following. "Last May," I'm
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:44.480]   quoting the article here, "Last May, facing pandemic and career burnout, this member whimsically
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:51.520]   suggested," so member of these four scientists have a group that meets regularly to discuss just
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:57.360]   their career and the challenges of being scientists. All right, so back to the quote, "A member of the
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:04.960]   group whimsically suggested we make a game out of saying no by challenging ourselves to collectively
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:13.760]   decline 100 work-related requests. Thus, we spent a year tracking and reflecting on our decisions to
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:22.320]   say no." So they started in May of 2021, they finished in March of 2022. So they got systematic
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:27.680]   about saying no and had four observations. They call them here four insights about what they learned
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:32.240]   saying no systematically 100 times over the course of a year. So let's go through these
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:40.560]   four insights real quick. All right, the first insight, "Tracking helped make no an option."
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:47.120]   So they started keeping track of all the things they said yes or no to, just a simple list. So
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.040]   this is separate from whatever other organizational system you have for organizing your time or
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:56.160]   projects. Let's just have a yes/no list. So as they pointed out, first of all, it helped them understand
[00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:03.120]   how much they'd already said yes. It's easy to forget. It also induced the gamification
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.960]   motivation of, well, how many no's do we have? I want to get a couple more no's this week. Maybe I
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:12.640]   do want to say no. What they then talked about is that once they started tracking no,
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.960]   this got them in the tracking mindset, which helped them in other ways as well. So reading
[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:26.960]   from the article here, they say, "We logged completed tasks to counteract imposter syndrome.
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:32.080]   We kept a running count of active projects and tracked how we were spending time each day." This
[00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:37.200]   is all the type of stuff I recommend. When you actually start tracking your time, your projects,
[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:40.000]   what you're doing, what you're not doing, when you actually confront what we talked about in the
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.320]   show, the productivity dragon of what's really on your plate, what you've slayed in the past,
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:49.200]   this is all very important for you getting your arms around your work and making confident plans
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:54.960]   for how you want to go forward. As long as you exist in this liminal space of emails coming in,
[00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:59.200]   you're saying yes or no, you're jumping in and out of meetings and just always scrambling,
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:03.200]   but you're not really sure, what am I doing? How much am I doing? What have I gotten done? What
[00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:07.840]   am I saying yes to? If you don't know these things, you're a fireman. You're putting out fires.
[00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:12.400]   And people who put out fires eventually get burnt. All right, number two, second thing they
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:22.320]   observed from this experiment, say no more often and to larger asks. So when they were reflecting,
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:29.200]   they said, "We declined too many little things, such as reviewing journal articles, and not enough
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:37.200]   big tasks." I think that's a good point. They were saying, you can rack up the no's
[00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:42.240]   quicker if you're aiming on the little things, the things that might take you a couple hours
[00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:46.960]   of the afternoons, but they're noting the things that caused the most stress were the big asks.
[00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:53.040]   And they give some examples here, leadership opportunities, the chance to help write large
[00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:59.600]   grant proposals, et cetera. By the way, all of this is giving me cold sweats because this is
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:06.160]   too close to home. Jesse knows this. Okay, so what they ended up doing is coming up with a series of
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:15.600]   questions to help evaluate when to say yes and when not. So here's their questions. They have
[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:19.920]   five of them. This is what they started asking to try to figure out, okay, is this something I should
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:24.720]   say yes to? One, does it fit to my research agenda and identity? Two, does it spark joy?
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:29.680]   Three, do I have time to do a good job without sacrificing extra commitments? Four, does the
[00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:36.080]   opportunity leave space for my personal life? Five, am I uniquely qualified to fill this need?
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:41.520]   Right, so that made it easier for them to say no because they had, eventually they had these
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:44.400]   criteria. So when something big would come along, they would say, look, there's two of
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:53.520]   these criteria, it doesn't pass. So now I have a reason to say no. Three, and this is an important
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:09:04.640]   one, maybe sometimes overlooked, saying no is emotional work. It really is. I have to say no a
[00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:11.360]   lot. I just earlier this week got out, you know, said no to a speaking thing that I sort of went
[00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:15.200]   down the road with it because I thought it would be interesting, but it logistically was going to be
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:21.360]   a pain. I knew I would regret it later on. And it's hard. And sometimes the other people get
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:25.120]   upset. I would say nine times out of 10 people aren't really upset. They just need an answer
[00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:29.520]   and they're moving on. But just emotionally, the lived experience of saying no, because of the way
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:36.240]   it plays on our interpersonal social network wiring in our brain, the lived experience is often quite
[00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:40.800]   stressful. This hits different people differently. So here's the authors here I'm reading.
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:46.560]   In myriad ways, we saw how our cultural conditioning as women, academics, and public
[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:52.320]   servants contributed to our difficulty with setting boundaries, tracking not just how often
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:56.800]   we said yes or no, but also our emotional responses made the emotional labor of saying
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:06.400]   no visible. We often do ignore the emotional side of some of this otherwise seemingly dry technical
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:14.560]   productivity, uh, strategy, that there is an emotional side to it. I talk about in a world
[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:21.120]   without email, there's non surprising, but well done surveys of workplace behavior that says,
[00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:25.200]   if you start to categorize what they call non-promotable behavior. So these are behaviors
[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:30.720]   that aren't directly projects, activity tasks, not directly ties you being promoted. So I will
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:38.720]   help organize the birthday party for Jesse, you know, next month, women were way more likely than
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:43.280]   men to be doing those like they're, they're disproportionately spending more hours on it.
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:48.240]   So there's these, these subtleties in terms of just the emotional exchange and saying, no,
[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:53.520]   not wanting to let someone down. Uh, women are much less likely just to be straight up jerks.
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:11:01.200]   Guys can kind of get away with that. In academia, you have a lot of guys that are barely in some
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:07.200]   fields, barely fit for social, like human social interaction. If that makes sense, you can ask my
[00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:11.360]   wife about this. She's been, she threw out grad school. I brought her to a lot of, uh, computer
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:16.480]   science parties. You get some of that. You get out of a lot of work when you don't even want to have
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:20.880]   a conversation with someone. So I think that's a good point they're pointing out. Um, so what they
[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:25.840]   say here is we need less logistical advice and more emotional advice when it comes to thinking
[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:28.640]   about yes or no. So let's acknowledge that. I think that's a very important point.
[00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:34.960]   All right. In the same piece, they pulled out. I want, there's one other thing I want to highlight
[00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:43.680]   in the same section here. They were looking, what's the terminology here? Soft no or little no.
[00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:47.760]   So they had heard something called little no, which is where like you agree to a little bit
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:52.400]   or to do a lesser thing. So it's not as emotionally taxing. And they described that strategy,
[00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:59.440]   that strategy for reducing the emotional toll of saying no to be a slippery slope that led people
[00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:04.640]   to ask for a greater commitment. Later on, they went on to say only a firm no truly reduced our
[00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:11.600]   commitments. That is so true to my experience. I, you know, I become a master of that in my time.
[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:19.040]   You can't, can't try to soften the blow. You have this sense of like, maybe there's a way I can say
[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:22.880]   no here that I'm not really saying no, but I don't have to do the work. It doesn't work. You have to
[00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:28.720]   be incredibly clear. And, you know, I I've learned this through experience where I'll say, I really
[00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:34.720]   appreciate this invitation. I'm honored. You thought of me. However, because of X, Y, Z, I have
[00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:40.080]   to say no to this request. Like you have to have that piece. It's I unfortunately are with regrets.
[00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:45.360]   I have to say no to this request. You have to have that piece. It can't just be like, yeah, I don't
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:49.120]   know. You know, I'm pretty busy. I'm not sure if this is going to work out and X, Y, and Z, and
[00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:52.080]   just hope that they're going to come back and say, you know what? You seem too busy. Don't worry
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:56.960]   about it. They won't. They, their life will be easier if you say yes, as long as there's any
[00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:01.200]   opening, they're going to keep going. You owe them and yourself clarity. So that's, you have to have
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:06.960]   in there somewhere. I've definitely learned this specifically. I am saying no period. And then you
[00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:12.720]   can add regrets and stuff like that. That's fine, but don't give any wiggle room. The other thing
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:17.680]   to say is don't say, well, I'm really busy right now. So I don't think I can do it this semester
[00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:23.040]   or this month because they will be like, great. How about January? So it has to be because of
[00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:28.800]   busyness or because of whatever I have to say no. So you can't answer back like, okay, but maybe you
[00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:33.680]   mean yes. All right. Fourth thing, they, these authors, the fourth insight practice makes no
[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:42.560]   easier as they did it more as they got closer to 100, it got easier to do. So anyways, I like that
[00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:49.920]   article. Uh, and I like the topic. You have to control what is on your plate. You are doing
[00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:55.520]   this, whether you have a plan or not, you are saying no to things, you're turning things down.
[00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:58.720]   You're probably just doing implicitly. You're probably just waiting until you're stressed
[00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:02.640]   and then lashing out randomly and trying to get out of things until people see you're so
[00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:07.520]   exhausted that maybe they stop bothering you. All right. That's not a good plan. It's a plan,
[00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:12.160]   but it's not a good plan. You need a better one. And I think this article is a, uh, a pretty good
[00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:17.840]   treatment of the topic. So get more systematic about saying no recognize the difficulty of doing
[00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:27.280]   so and it'll make your life in the long run, uh, a lot easier. I say no all the time, Jesse,
[00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:33.920]   like my whole life. Yeah. Yeah. I would imagine you get a lot of requests. I do. I do. I mean,
[00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:37.520]   it helps. I don't, this is why I don't have a general purpose way for people to reach me.
[00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:43.840]   It's why there's, there's, um, if you go to my contact page, so if you're interested in speaking,
[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:49.040]   here's my speaking agent. If you have like a publicity thing, here's my publicist. If you
[00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:52.640]   have like a question about rights or translations or something about the books, here's my literary
[00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:58.240]   agency, right? It's like your question has to get moved to someone who is not me. If you want to
[00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:03.520]   send us links, which I love, here's the address, but, uh, requests won't be answered. Like we just
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:06.400]   make that clear on the site. Like there's just too many of the messages that come through. I love
[00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:09.280]   that you guys send me things, but I can't say I can't actually respond to it. So there's not
[00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:13.840]   actually a general purpose place. I mean, and then if people make their way, sometimes people
[00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:18.240]   make their way to my Georgetown address, but then I just feel fine. Like if you're using that for a
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:23.360]   non-academic purpose, like you already know, like I don't, I'm not expecting to get a response. I
[00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:28.160]   don't respond to those. You know, it, it, it works. I mean, it's, it's hard because it's nice
[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:31.760]   to talk to people. And I used to interact with all of our, all my different readers and would
[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:37.600]   answer every email and it took all my time and then I couldn't do anything else. So it's, it's,
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:42.320]   uh, it is hard. Uh, and then I still get a lot of requests. I have to say no to, you know,
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:48.080]   I'll tell you the hard ones. Sometimes they come from friends, you know, it'll be, uh, the, the
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:53.760]   hardest ones and then, and then I'll, I'll leave it. I'll just say the hardest ones are, let's say
[00:15:53.760 --> 00:16:00.640]   it's a friend of the family or, you know, who doesn't know much about me, but just like comes
[00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:06.240]   across something and then is like, oh, I know him. Like I know his wife, I know his mom or something
[00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:10.640]   like that. And like, Hey, can you, uh, it's so exciting. I saw you like, um, can you come like
[00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:15.920]   down to our office and like, come give a talk and like, you know, come join this webinar, do this
[00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:20.560]   and that. And those are kind of the, those are the, those are the hard ones. Yeah. It's hard to say
[00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:26.320]   no, which I do, but it's just hard to do. Yeah. But you just have to, we just have to rip off the
[00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:31.600]   bandaid. Yeah. Yeah. My wife's got used to that. Just saying to people who know her and she's like,
[00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:34.880]   he just, he's not doing things right now. And she has some phrase, she says like, he's not,
[00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:38.880]   he's not taking on new things right now or something. She's got the script optimized.
[00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:52.240]   She's got the script optimized.
