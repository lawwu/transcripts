[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.300]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.320]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.200]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.680]   Today, my guest is Dr. Vivek Murthy.
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.080]   Dr. Vivek Murthy is a medical doctor
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.280]   and acting Surgeon General of the United States.
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.880]   As Surgeon General of the United States,
[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.120]   Dr. Murthy oversees more than 6,000
[00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.020]   dedicated public health officers,
[00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.920]   whose job is to protect, promote,
[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.200]   and advance our nation's public health.
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.140]   Dr. Murthy received his bachelor's degree
[00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.640]   from Harvard University and his medical degree
[00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.440]   from the Yale University School of Medicine.
[00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.480]   Today's discussion covers some of the most important issues
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.060]   in public health, not just within the United States,
[00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:50.080]   but worldwide, including nutrition and the obesity crisis,
[00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.480]   as well as food additives
[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.020]   and why certain food chemicals and additives
[00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.320]   are allowed in the United States versus in other countries.
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.380]   We also discuss mental health,
[00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:00.860]   the youth mental health crisis,
[00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.500]   the adult mental health crisis,
[00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.000]   and the global crisis of loneliness and isolation.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.100]   We also talk about corporate interests,
[00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.660]   that is whether or not big food and big pharma industries
[00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.480]   actually impact the research and/or decisions
[00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.000]   that the U.S. Surgeon General takes
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.500]   in his directives toward public health.
[00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.560]   And of course, we discuss
[00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.000]   some of the major public health events
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.960]   that occurred over the last five years,
[00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.320]   and the current and future landscape
[00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.820]   of how to restore faith both in public health officials,
[00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.920]   in public health policy, and science more generally.
[00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.280]   By the end of today's episode,
[00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.800]   you not only will have learned a tremendous amount
[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.540]   about public health and why you hear
[00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.200]   the particular public health directives that you do,
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.040]   but also how to better interpret
[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.860]   future public health directives.
[00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.760]   You'll also come to learn that as Surgeon General,
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.560]   Dr. Murthy has both an extremely challenging job,
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.540]   but one that he meets with a tremendous amount
[00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.780]   of both rigor and compassion.
[00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.780]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.420]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.520]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.400]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.400]   about science and science-related tools
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.760]   to the general public.
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:07.860]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.720]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.160]   Our first sponsor is Maui Nui Venison.
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.420]   Maui Nui Venison is the most nutrient-dense
[00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.340]   and delicious red meat available.
[00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.080]   I've spoken before on this podcast in solo episodes
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.580]   and with guests about the need to get
[00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.480]   approximately one gram of high-quality protein
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.400]   per pound of body weight each day for optimal nutrition.
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.660]   Now, there are many different ways that one can do that,
[00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.320]   but a key thing is to make sure that you're not doing that
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.600]   by ingesting excessive calories.
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.840]   Maui Nui Venison has the highest density
[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.960]   of quality protein per calorie,
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.400]   and it achieves that in delicious things
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.800]   like ground meats, venison steaks, jerky, and bone broth.
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.680]   I particularly like the ground venison.
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.980]   I make those into venison burgers.
[00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.160]   Probably five times a week or more.
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.520]   I also like the jerky for its convenience,
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.640]   especially when I'm traveling
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.440]   or I'm especially busy with work,
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.000]   and know that I'm getting an extremely nutrient-dense
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.600]   high-quality source of protein.
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.720]   If you'd like to try Maui Nui Venison,
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.120]   you can go to MauinuiVenison.com/huberman
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.380]   and get 20% off your first order.
[00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.340]   Again, that's MauinuiVenison.com/huberman to get 20% off.
[00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.160]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Roca.
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.160]   Roca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.200]   that are of the absolute highest quality.
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.940]   I've spent a lifetime working on the biology
[00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:25.780]   of the visual system,
[00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.040]   and I can tell you that your visual system has to contend
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.620]   with an enormous number of challenges
[00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.240]   in order for you to be able to see clearly
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.400]   in different environments.
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.640]   Roca understands the biology of the visual system
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.660]   and has designed their eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.240]   so that you always see with crystal clarity.
[00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.480]   Originally, their glasses were designed for performance,
[00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.080]   that is, for running and cycling and for sport,
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.180]   and indeed, they can still be used for performance.
[00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.120]   They won't slip off your face if you get sweaty.
[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.380]   They're extremely lightweight,
[00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.320]   but I should mention that Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.360]   come in some of the aesthetics more typically associated
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.680]   with performance glasses, like those cyborg-style glasses,
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.260]   but they also have a number of styles
[00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:02.680]   that you would be perfectly comfortable
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.340]   wearing out to dinner or to work.
[00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.000]   I wear readers at night or when I drive,
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.960]   and I wear sunglasses during the day
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:11.520]   if I happen to be driving into bright light or outside
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.160]   and it's just overwhelmingly bright.
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.360]   I do not wear sunglasses
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.940]   when I do my morning sunlight viewing
[00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.180]   to set my circadian rhythm,
[00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.500]   and I suggest that you do the same.
[00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.920]   If you'd like to try Roca eyeglasses or sunglasses,
[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.520]   you can go to roca, R-O-K-A, .com,
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:25.720]   and enter the code Huberman
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.880]   to save 20% off your first order.
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.220]   Again, that's Roca, R-O-K-A, .com,
[00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.800]   and enter the code Huberman at checkout.
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.240]   And now for my discussion with Dr. Vivek Murthy.
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.400]   Dr. Vivek Murthy, welcome.
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.560]   - Thanks so much, Andrew, and please call me Vivek.
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:41.840]   I'm informal. [laughs]
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.720]   - Okay, Vivek.
[00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.000]   My understanding, based on my internet search,
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.320]   is that the role of the U.S. Surgeon General
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.540]   is to provide scientific information
[00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.640]   on how to improve health
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.760]   and reduce risk of illness and injury.
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.580]   Do I have that correct?
[00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:59.580]   - That is correct.
[00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.520]   - What are some other roles that you play
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:07.520]   that perhaps would not come up in a top-hit Google search
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.340]   that I ought to be aware of
[00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.140]   and that our audience ought to be aware of?
[00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.220]   - Well, here's how I generally explain to people.
[00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:16.740]   There are two primary roles.
[00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.100]   The Surgeon General has.
[00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.820]   One is to engage with the public
[00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:22.500]   and make sure that people know
[00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.580]   about critical public health issues
[00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:25.940]   so they know what they are,
[00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:28.220]   how to protect themselves and their families.
[00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:32.020]   The second role of the Surgeon General is lesser known,
[00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:33.300]   but it's equally as important,
[00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.580]   which is to oversee one of the eight uniformed services
[00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:37.740]   in the U.S. government,
[00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.180]   and that is the United States Public Health Service.
[00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:41.700]   Many people are familiar with the Army,
[00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.820]   the Navy, the Air Force.
[00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:46.460]   We also have the U.S. Public Health Service,
[00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.040]   which is 6,000 officers.
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.800]   They include doctors, nurses, physical therapists,
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.180]   pharmacists, public health engineers,
[00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:55.580]   a whole range of healthcare folks,
[00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.640]   and their job is to protect our nation
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:59.980]   from public health threats.
[00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:04.060]   So when Ebola came on the scene in 2014
[00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:06.720]   in a major way in West Africa,
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.660]   we sent hundreds of officers to West Africa
[00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:12.140]   to set up the Monrovia Medical Unit in Liberia
[00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:15.300]   to treat people with Ebola.
[00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.460]   Domestically, when there are hurricanes or tornadoes,
[00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.220]   we dispatch officers and deploy them
[00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:23.060]   to go help strengthen the public health infrastructure,
[00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.220]   but also to provide direct care.
[00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:27.860]   We deployed thousands of officers during COVID.
[00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:30.940]   So these officers, I'm incredibly proud of them.
[00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:33.100]   They could be doing lots of stuff outside government
[00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:34.260]   in the private sector,
[00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:35.680]   probably making a whole lot more money
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.380]   and working a lot less hard,
[00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:38.780]   but they're really committed
[00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:40.540]   to protecting the public health of the nation.
[00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:42.900]   So I have the privilege of overseeing
[00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:44.160]   that service as Surgeon General,
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:48.400]   and those are the jobs that I've signed up for in this role.
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.720]   - Got it, I was not aware of that role.
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.680]   And if I understood correctly,
[00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:56.560]   these people, these public health officers
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:00.040]   that presumably are made up of physicians
[00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:03.640]   and licensed psychologists and nurses and so forth,
[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:08.100]   you said they could be making substantially higher incomes
[00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:08.940]   in the private sector,
[00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:11.140]   but the work that they're doing with you
[00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:13.520]   is their sole career at this point.
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:14.740]   They're completely devoted to that,
[00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:16.620]   or they're doing this as a side hustle?
[00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:19.500]   - No, they are full-time government employees
[00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:21.420]   and members of the Public Health Service.
[00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:24.060]   Their day job is often in public health agencies
[00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:25.700]   where they're embedded in communities,
[00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:27.660]   helping day-to-day to advance public health.
[00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:30.700]   And during times of emergency, we deploy them.
[00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:34.260]   And they're extraordinarily well-trained.
[00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.400]   They're experienced at dealing with adversity,
[00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:41.060]   but they bring a combination of skill and heart
[00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:41.900]   to their work.
[00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:45.060]   And you really need both to be effective at public health.
[00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:47.100]   - I'm glad that you mentioned the word emergency,
[00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:49.280]   because in preparing for our discussion today,
[00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:54.280]   it occurred to me that in this list of roles
[00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:56.340]   that your title assumes,
[00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:59.760]   that scientific information on how to improve health
[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:03.280]   comes first, then you mentioned emergency.
[00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:06.540]   So what I'd like to talk about first is health,
[00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:09.260]   not lack of health, but health.
[00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.980]   So often we hear about the mental health crisis,
[00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:13.340]   but what we're really talking about
[00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:16.620]   is the lack of mental health crisis, AKA mental illness.
[00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:19.260]   And rarely do we hear, for instance,
[00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.100]   what constitutes mental health.
[00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:23.700]   We hear what constitutes mental illness.
[00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:25.340]   Whereas in the domain of physical health,
[00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:26.700]   there's a lot of information out there
[00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:28.400]   about how to be more physically healthy,
[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:30.920]   cardiovascular exercise, resistance exercise,
[00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:33.780]   yoga type exercise, mobility, et cetera.
[00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:37.480]   And of course, some people have physical health ailments,
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:38.900]   and there's a lot of information
[00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:40.740]   in terms of how to deal with that as well.
[00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:43.540]   But what I would like to know before we get into
[00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:47.280]   the long list of issues that our nation confronts,
[00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:50.780]   everything from obesity to food additives
[00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:55.780]   to mental health issues, what is going well?
[00:08:55.780 --> 00:09:00.780]   In other words, in the last, let's say five to 10 years,
[00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:03.540]   have there been any areas of physical health
[00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:07.220]   and mental health improvement in the US at large
[00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:09.420]   that we can attribute to some of
[00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:12.060]   the public health initiatives directly?
[00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:14.060]   - So that's a really good question.
[00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:16.900]   And let me just also say about the very first point
[00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:19.700]   you raised, that you're absolutely right
[00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:23.780]   that we have operated primarily through an illness frame
[00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:25.000]   when we look at health.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.420]   And in my mind, that's only one half of the equation.
[00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:33.120]   So when we are talking about physical illness, for example,
[00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:35.780]   as a doctor, I learned how to diagnose and treat someone
[00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:38.060]   with diabetes or with high blood pressure
[00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:40.260]   or with coronary heart disease.
[00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.580]   But we also know that even if I don't have diabetes
[00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:46.080]   or coronary heart disease or high blood pressure,
[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:48.300]   even if I don't have any diagnosable medical condition,
[00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:51.340]   I may not be at an optimal level of physical health.
[00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:54.200]   I may not be able to, for example, walk around the block
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:55.420]   without getting short of breath.
[00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:57.100]   I may not be able to play with my kids
[00:09:57.100 --> 00:10:00.620]   'cause my physical fitness and stamina is insufficient.
[00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:02.620]   I may not be able to lift my luggage
[00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:04.720]   when I go to the airport because I don't have enough
[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:06.300]   strength in my body,
[00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:09.060]   yet I wouldn't have a diagnosable mental illness.
[00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:10.900]   So I think it's easier to understand there
[00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:12.660]   with physical health that we're not just aiming
[00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:15.180]   for lack of illness, we're aiming to optimize
[00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:16.440]   our physical health.
[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:18.420]   The same is true with mental health.
[00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:20.600]   And I think when we talk about mental health,
[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:22.780]   people think we're just, the sole goal here
[00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:26.020]   is to prevent diagnosable mental illness.
[00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:29.480]   That is one goal, to both prevent and to manage
[00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:31.660]   mental illness when it arises.
[00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:33.540]   But we also need to recognize there's a whole other half
[00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:35.340]   of the spectrum where there are people who may not have
[00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:38.500]   diagnosable mental illness but are not operating optimally
[00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:42.300]   in their lives and that's detracting from their fulfillment,
[00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:45.300]   from their functionality, like in not just at work
[00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:47.800]   but also in their communities and in their families.
[00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:50.240]   And so I think part of the conversation that I want us
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:53.180]   to have as a country is about how to optimize mental health
[00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:56.800]   and well-being and that includes preventing mental illness
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:00.140]   but it is much broader and bigger than that alone.
[00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:00.980]   - Great.
[00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:03.860]   I think it's so important that we recognize
[00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:08.860]   that treating disease is critical, obviously,
[00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:10.820]   but that there's a lot that can be done
[00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:13.540]   to improve one's health, even in the absence
[00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:15.360]   of any known disease.
[00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:17.600]   And you've got all these officers,
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:20.280]   these incredible physicians and nurses
[00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:23.620]   and people at your disposal.
[00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:25.840]   My hope is that they would also be accessible
[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:29.940]   for and currently carrying out efforts
[00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:32.180]   to transmit information to people about,
[00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:34.460]   hey, here are the things that you can do every day,
[00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:37.060]   every week, every month in order to make your life
[00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:42.060]   as healthy as possible as well as rushing in
[00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:45.780]   under conditions of public health crisis.
[00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:48.220]   - Yeah, it's a good point and it's certainly,
[00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:51.460]   many of our officers do focus on this broader rubric
[00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:54.300]   around well-being but it's part of how we need,
[00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:57.380]   I think, the broader health system and public health system
[00:11:57.380 --> 00:11:59.500]   to operate even outside of government.
[00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:03.000]   And this, I think, will require significant change
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.620]   and shift in how we think about our jobs.
[00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:06.800]   Like when I went to medical school,
[00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:10.320]   the vast majority of the focus was on diagnosing
[00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:11.980]   and treating illness.
[00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:14.060]   It was much, much less focused on thinking about
[00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:16.740]   how to enhance well-being.
[00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:20.740]   And when you talk to people in their lives,
[00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:23.020]   it becomes clear that they want to do more
[00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:25.900]   than just prevent diagnosable illness.
[00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:29.140]   They want to be able to walk their child down the aisle.
[00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:31.120]   They want to have the endurance to do that.
[00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:33.980]   They want to be able to be independent often
[00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:36.600]   and carry their groceries or carry their luggage.
[00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:40.060]   This is why I think we've got to broaden our focus
[00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:41.500]   in public health.
[00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:44.520]   And look, when I came into this role,
[00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:46.420]   by the way, I was not expecting to serve in government.
[00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:49.660]   This was not part of some five, 10, 30 year plan.
[00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:52.380]   When I was a kid, I was interested in medicine
[00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:55.180]   but I always thought I was gonna practice medicine
[00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:57.860]   like my dad did and like the clinic my mom ran.
[00:12:57.860 --> 00:12:59.420]   You know, set up, put up a shingle,
[00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:02.100]   see patients and be a primary care doctor
[00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:04.340]   and feel good about the work I was doing.
[00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:07.500]   But what happened to me along the way
[00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:09.580]   is, you know, I trained in medicine.
[00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:10.900]   I got interested in technology.
[00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:13.500]   Spent seven years building a technology company
[00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:14.740]   that was focused on health.
[00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:17.620]   I became increasingly worried about
[00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:19.740]   the way we were delivering healthcare.
[00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:21.340]   I felt like our healthcare system was broken.
[00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:23.180]   People who needed care couldn't get it.
[00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:24.820]   It was often too expensive to get care.
[00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:27.860]   We were focusing on treatment solely and not enough
[00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:28.700]   on prevention.
[00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:31.020]   So I started getting involved in advocating
[00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:32.720]   for a better healthcare system
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:34.340]   with doctors around the country.
[00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:35.860]   When despite all that, I still never thought
[00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:37.040]   I would work in government.
[00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:42.040]   But in 2013 is when President Obama's team
[00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:43.900]   had reached out to me and asked if I'd be interested
[00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:46.420]   in considering the position of Surgeon General.
[00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:49.500]   And what was interesting to me about this position
[00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:52.780]   is it's actually very different from most positions
[00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:54.460]   that are appointed by a president in government
[00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:57.180]   in that it's supposed to be an independent position.
[00:13:57.180 --> 00:14:00.440]   So my agenda, the issues I choose to take on
[00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:03.640]   are not determined by a president or a party.
[00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:06.580]   They're determined by science and the public interest.
[00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:08.500]   And that's what guides me.
[00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:11.700]   You know, and that's what guided me in that first term
[00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:14.420]   when I served and when President Biden asked me
[00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:16.360]   to come back and serve as Surgeon General a second time,
[00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:18.620]   that's what's guided me here too.
[00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:21.860]   - So Biden is not sending you notes saying,
[00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:26.740]   "Hey, could you put some effort into getting messages out
[00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:30.420]   "about COVID or could you put more effort
[00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:34.080]   "into getting your team over to Maui
[00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:38.140]   "to deal with the tragedy there?"
[00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:40.320]   Which is a long arc tragedy, right?
[00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:43.500]   We get the news in a blast of this happened
[00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:46.380]   and then the next blast comes in about something else
[00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:48.140]   and we forget that there are physical
[00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:51.900]   and mental health crises that are ongoing.
[00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:54.260]   And then I have to imagine
[00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.180]   then start to overlap with one another.
[00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:58.620]   Or is it, so is it your decision
[00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:02.780]   where and how to deploy the financial and human resources?
[00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:05.380]   Like, okay, we're gonna put 10 people on Maui.
[00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:07.980]   We're going to put, you know,
[00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:10.740]   five people in the central states, you know,
[00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:13.860]   going around talking to major organizations
[00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:16.220]   about what they need to do to prepare for this winter.
[00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:17.580]   Is that how it works?
[00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:19.300]   Or are you getting memos?
[00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:21.220]   And in other words, who's your boss?
[00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:22.740]   Everyone has a boss at some level.
[00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:26.100]   Mine are the listeners of this podcast at some level.
[00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:27.220]   I work for them.
[00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:30.260]   It used to also be my bulldog, Costello, but--
[00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.220]   - My boss, my wife, and my two kids,
[00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:34.260]   who are five and seven, I do what they tell me to.
[00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:35.900]   - Got it, got it.
[00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:37.220]   So--
[00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:38.900]   - But how we make our decisions in the office,
[00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:41.260]   actually, it's a bit different with those two roles.
[00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:43.300]   So with the second one,
[00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:46.700]   with overseeing the Commission Corps, our 6,000 officers,
[00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:50.300]   there, the decisions about how and when we deploy officers
[00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:51.340]   are collaborative, right?
[00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:54.220]   So, you know, we work with other colleagues
[00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:56.220]   throughout the Department of Health and Human Services.
[00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:59.300]   We work with people in FEMA, across the administration.
[00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:00.420]   But we also work with states.
[00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:02.580]   So sometimes states often, often,
[00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:04.180]   states will put in a request and say,
[00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:06.300]   "Hey, we need support here.
[00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:07.380]   "Can you help?"
[00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:09.300]   So we'll work with colleagues across our department
[00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:10.820]   to say, "Okay, well, we can mobilize
[00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:12.420]   "our Commission Corps officers.
[00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:13.860]   "What assets can you mobilize?"
[00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:16.740]   And then collectively, we will send a team out there.
[00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:20.540]   So, for example, we have officers helping in Maui right now,
[00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:22.300]   particularly with mental health needs,
[00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:25.060]   which are, I worry, only gonna continue to grow
[00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:27.180]   over the weeks and months ahead.
[00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:28.460]   On the other side of the house,
[00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:30.820]   when it comes to deciding which issues
[00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:32.100]   we engage with the public on,
[00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:33.860]   like, in this case, mental health
[00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:36.540]   has been a big focus area for me.
[00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:38.940]   On that front, well, we certainly, you know,
[00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:40.900]   are open to suggestions from the public.
[00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:42.100]   Members of Congress sometimes say,
[00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:44.780]   "Hey, can you help the public understand about this issue?"
[00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:46.420]   You know, a lot of people have ideas and opinions,
[00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:48.980]   but the decision about which issues to focus on,
[00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:50.500]   those are our offices.
[00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:51.820]   And to me, that's important,
[00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:54.140]   because part of the reason over time,
[00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:57.020]   I believe, the public came to have some degree
[00:16:57.020 --> 00:16:59.900]   of faith and trust in the office is because
[00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:01.540]   they hoped that the office was functioning
[00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:03.580]   the way you hope your doctor is functioning,
[00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:05.980]   which is being an independent source
[00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:08.140]   of information for you,
[00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:09.940]   and a source that has your best interest at heart,
[00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:12.820]   that's not being pulled aside by political interests
[00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:13.780]   or by other agendas,
[00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:15.340]   but the primary agenda is,
[00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:16.620]   "How can I help your health?"
[00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:18.100]   And so, for me, like,
[00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:20.060]   we have to make an independent assessment there
[00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:22.820]   and say, "Okay, where is the need, the greatest here?
[00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:24.940]   "Where can we make the biggest difference?"
[00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:27.660]   Sometimes we may not build an initiative on an issue,
[00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:29.340]   and that doesn't mean that that issue's not important
[00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:32.060]   or that it's not affecting a lot of people,
[00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:33.300]   but we have to make hard decisions
[00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:34.940]   about where to put limited resources.
[00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:36.780]   And so, when I was a surgeon general,
[00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:39.300]   the first time, one of the big areas I focused on
[00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:41.940]   was the opioid crisis that we were dealing with,
[00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:44.820]   as well as the e-cigarette use among youth,
[00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:46.980]   because we were seeing a dramatic increase
[00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:49.540]   among kids in e-cigarette use that was--
[00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:50.980]   - Can I just ask you, sorry to interrupt,
[00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:53.220]   but I think it's relevant here,
[00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:57.300]   has that increase continued or e-cigarette use,
[00:17:57.300 --> 00:17:58.260]   AKA vaping?
[00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:01.060]   - Yeah, so we still see, unfortunately,
[00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:02.300]   there's been some improvements,
[00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:04.620]   but we still see way too many kids
[00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:07.500]   who are using vaping devices early on,
[00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:09.420]   and part of what we did from our office
[00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:11.820]   is recognizing that we actually issued
[00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:14.900]   the first federal report on e-cigarettes in youth.
[00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:16.100]   We call the country's attention
[00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:17.420]   to the fact that this is a crisis.
[00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:19.460]   We worked with members of Congress
[00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:21.660]   to talk about the kind of action we needed
[00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:23.660]   from a legislative and regulatory perspective
[00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:25.420]   and worked with colleagues at the FDA
[00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:26.780]   and in government as well.
[00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:28.700]   But there are two things that are really most important
[00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:31.340]   in guiding our choice about priorities.
[00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:32.660]   One is data.
[00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:35.340]   We look at what the numbers actually tell us
[00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:37.180]   about the impact these issues are having
[00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:39.500]   on the population as well as the trajectory of rise.
[00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:41.060]   If something's getting dramatically worse
[00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:42.380]   and people don't realize it,
[00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:44.100]   might be an area for us to focus.
[00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:46.300]   But the other critical factor
[00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:48.780]   is what I hear from people on the road.
[00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:51.060]   And so I try to spend as much time as I can
[00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:52.660]   visiting communities across the country,
[00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:55.660]   doing town halls, meeting with community members,
[00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:57.460]   and just trying to, frankly,
[00:18:57.460 --> 00:19:00.300]   just listen to what's on their mind.
[00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:01.860]   And that's where I actually get
[00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:03.300]   a lot of information as well.
[00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:05.740]   That's actually how I came to focus
[00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:07.260]   on the issue of loneliness and isolation.
[00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:09.380]   It wasn't 'cause it popped up in a report
[00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:13.020]   as being the leading public health issue in the country.
[00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:15.820]   It was because everywhere I was going,
[00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:18.660]   in 2014, 2015,
[00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:20.500]   when I was talking to college students,
[00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:22.020]   talking to retired Americans,
[00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:25.100]   talking to parents in rural areas and urban areas,
[00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:26.820]   I kept hearing these stories about people
[00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:29.300]   who felt like they were all on their own
[00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:30.580]   or they felt invisible
[00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:32.540]   or they felt if they disappeared tomorrow,
[00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:33.860]   no one would even care
[00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:35.820]   or they felt like they just didn't belong.
[00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:38.780]   And it's heartbreaking to hear that from anyone.
[00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:42.060]   It's particularly heartbreaking to hear it from kids
[00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:44.460]   who you hope are entering life
[00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:46.940]   and looking forward to what comes,
[00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:48.900]   but many kids weren't feeling that way.
[00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:52.060]   - That is very useful context.
[00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:56.940]   And we will get back to the isolation crisis,
[00:19:56.940 --> 00:20:00.740]   such an important initiative that I just will thank you now
[00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:03.900]   for having put out the message on social media
[00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:06.300]   and elsewhere about that,
[00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:09.340]   because I think one of the questions I have
[00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:11.780]   in light of what you just said is,
[00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:13.920]   it's clear that you've got your ear to the ground,
[00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:15.620]   you're talking to different people.
[00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:21.020]   It's also critically important that people hear from you
[00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:23.580]   and know not just what's happening,
[00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:28.180]   but that you perhaps want to know where the issues lie
[00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:33.180]   and what the actionable steps are that people can take.
[00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:37.620]   And I think that we now live in a hyper-connected world.
[00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:40.700]   So, in fact, I'll just say that one of the reasons
[00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:42.900]   I launched this podcast is in 2020,
[00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:44.580]   I was going on podcasts talking about things
[00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:46.480]   like maintaining sleep and circadian rhythm
[00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:51.100]   and stuff from my lab related to trying to adjust anxiety
[00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:53.660]   under conditions where I think everyone was anxious
[00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:56.460]   and sleep rhythms were disrupted, et cetera.
[00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:58.140]   And I was somewhat surprised
[00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:00.740]   that I didn't get a warning on my phone.
[00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:03.460]   Hey, make sure you're getting morning sunlight.
[00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:05.180]   I'll get a flood warning.
[00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:07.440]   I'll get a warning that I might get a warning,
[00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:08.820]   but it's only a test warning.
[00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:10.940]   I'll get three of those yesterday
[00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:12.500]   living here near the coast.
[00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:16.340]   But I don't think once during the pandemic
[00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:21.340]   did I get a email or a public service announcement saying,
[00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:24.580]   if you are going to be indoors a lot,
[00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:27.060]   you're going to have to be mindful of maintaining
[00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:29.340]   your circadian rhythm because if you're not,
[00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:31.840]   I mean, we know based on hundreds of studies now
[00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:34.620]   that drifts in circadian rhythmicity
[00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:37.160]   are a precursor to mental health issues.
[00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:38.860]   I mean, in fact, there's a new idea
[00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:43.380]   that many, not all suicides are preceded
[00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:45.300]   by a period of disrupted sleep,
[00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:50.300]   which kind of makes sense and it's not causal, of course.
[00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:53.740]   But how come during the pandemic,
[00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:57.120]   we each and all as US citizens
[00:21:57.120 --> 00:22:00.980]   did not get an email or a text message saying,
[00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:04.240]   hey, these are five things that you need to do every day
[00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:07.640]   to try and stay as stable as possible
[00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:11.180]   in this very uncertain landscape that we're in?
[00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:12.500]   - Well, it's a really good question.
[00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:17.500]   And I think it's a reasonable and a very good suggestion
[00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:20.520]   to say that, hey, look, there should be
[00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:22.300]   a clear and comprehensive way
[00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:24.740]   that we can get messages out to everyone.
[00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:27.260]   Like if we were working in a hospital system
[00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:29.940]   and there was a safety issue that came up,
[00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:30.860]   there would be an email sent
[00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:32.380]   to all the hospital staff members saying,
[00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:34.520]   hey, this is something you need to be aware of, right?
[00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:37.020]   So I think it's a reasonable expectation.
[00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:38.940]   Practically, if you go back, hello,
[00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:43.940]   over the last 20, 30 years on health issues,
[00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:48.420]   there hasn't been sort of an agency or an entity
[00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:51.660]   that has sent emails out to everyone.
[00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:53.580]   First of all, how to send an email out to everyone
[00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:55.500]   in America is not a simple proposition either.
[00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:57.180]   Technically, it's challenging.
[00:22:57.180 --> 00:22:58.660]   There are some legal issues
[00:22:58.660 --> 00:22:59.780]   you'd have to deal with as well.
[00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:04.700]   - But you could do a night where you go CNN, Fox, NBC, ABC,
[00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:05.900]   New York Times, Wall Street.
[00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:08.140]   Like you could hit the right wing, the left wing,
[00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:08.980]   and everything in between.
[00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:10.480]   - Yeah, that's a really interesting suggestion.
[00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:13.260]   - But one video just where they all agree,
[00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:17.460]   like, hey, this is important information, so apolitical.
[00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:19.780]   - Yeah, so I would say that that kind of messaging,
[00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:21.820]   I would say through traditional media,
[00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:25.340]   certainly has happened, and it happened during COVID.
[00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:29.580]   It happened, for example, when in the first year of COVID,
[00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:32.280]   I was a private citizen in the prior administration,
[00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:34.820]   but I watched both then and at the beginning
[00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:36.540]   of the Biden administration,
[00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:40.180]   many officials would go out in front of cameras and say,
[00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:42.140]   here are three things you need to do
[00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:45.100]   to keep yourself safe from COVID.
[00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:46.540]   And that was a big question people had.
[00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:47.580]   How do I keep myself safe?
[00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:49.540]   Okay, here are three things you can do.
[00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:52.500]   A couple of challenges I would say here is that,
[00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:56.340]   number one, even if you hit all the major network
[00:23:56.340 --> 00:24:00.740]   and cable news shows, you're still not reaching everyone.
[00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:03.020]   Because we're living in a society
[00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:05.540]   where increasingly people are not watching TV.
[00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:08.140]   They're getting their news from other sources.
[00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:10.460]   The other thing that's important to know
[00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:13.660]   is that attention shifts quickly in traditional media,
[00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:15.260]   also from issue to issue.
[00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:19.460]   And so you might get a clip out at a certain day,
[00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:22.340]   you might get on all the Sunday shows, for example,
[00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:25.740]   but the next day, that message isn't necessarily there.
[00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:28.740]   It's gone and people's attention has also switched off too.
[00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:31.700]   So they were, I mean, I can count,
[00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:34.980]   and we've logged probably thousands of interviews
[00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:37.300]   at this point that we've done with mainstream media
[00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:40.300]   with sort of concise messages about three things
[00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:42.220]   you can do to protect yourself, et cetera.
[00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:44.820]   And I'm glad we did those, we gotta do them.
[00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:47.220]   But I think one of the things we don't have right now
[00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:49.300]   in the country, and this is I think
[00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:51.620]   a bit of a health infrastructure challenge,
[00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:54.420]   is we actually don't have a quick, efficient way
[00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:57.380]   to reach everyone in the country with a health message,
[00:24:57.380 --> 00:24:58.900]   just like what you said.
[00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:00.060]   If you wanted to get that message
[00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:02.980]   about three things to protect yourself from, let's say, COVID
[00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:05.860]   or three things to do to support your health and wellbeing
[00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:07.100]   during a time of crisis.
[00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:08.300]   - Or during a time of health.
[00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:10.620]   I mean, again, like not just the flood warning,
[00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:14.340]   but the daily, 'cause I do think that most of mental
[00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:17.900]   and physical health is the result of daily practices
[00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:20.180]   that are, you know, that build on themselves,
[00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:22.660]   sort of like compounded investments.
[00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:24.620]   And then, of course, there are acute challenges
[00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:26.300]   and chronic challenges that people face,
[00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:28.540]   but things of that sort, too.
[00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:30.780]   - I think those kind of messages in terms of health
[00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:32.660]   are absolutely important as well.
[00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:36.740]   And, you know, I think in the sort of,
[00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:39.060]   I think, fast-paced, crisis-driven environment
[00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:41.940]   that we live in, unfortunately, people are often less,
[00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:44.380]   are paying less attention to those maintenance
[00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:45.940]   or improvement messages than they are
[00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:47.820]   to managing the crisis messages.
[00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:49.700]   But I think that they're equally as important.
[00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:50.980]   But I do think that what you're pointing out
[00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:54.060]   is an infrastructure piece that needs to be built,
[00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:56.780]   which is a way for, you know, health authorities
[00:25:56.780 --> 00:25:58.100]   to reach people, you know,
[00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:00.980]   with information quickly and comprehensively.
[00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:03.980]   I'll just tell you that in the 1980s,
[00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:07.020]   when C. Everett Koop was Surgeon General,
[00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:09.180]   one thing that he had done, which was interesting,
[00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:12.500]   is he had actually sent a letter, a physical letter,
[00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:15.780]   to all households in America about HIV.
[00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:17.420]   - A physical letter. - A physical letter.
[00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:19.260]   - Some of our listeners won't know what that is.
[00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:21.420]   - Yeah. (laughs)
[00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:22.700]   This thing you read about in the history books,
[00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:24.460]   there's something shows up in your mailbox,
[00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:26.740]   and you open it, and hopefully it's something
[00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:27.580]   you want to read.
[00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:30.060]   But in this case, he was worried about HIV,
[00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:31.380]   about the fact that people didn't know about it.
[00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:35.640]   So, he worked through, and with, as I understand it,
[00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:37.140]   with a member of Congress,
[00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:41.060]   found a way to do this from a funding perspective.
[00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:44.060]   But it was a very unusual move,
[00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:47.460]   and one that was never replicated since,
[00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:48.820]   and there was never infrastructure or funding
[00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:49.740]   to do that again.
[00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:54.240]   When I was Surgeon General some years ago,
[00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:55.620]   and then this time around,
[00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:57.740]   one of the things I did do is I was able
[00:26:57.740 --> 00:27:01.060]   to send a physical letter to the medical community.
[00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:03.540]   The first time, it was about the opioid use crisis,
[00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:06.700]   and about changing our prescribing practices in medicine
[00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:10.180]   so that we expose fewer patients to the harm of opioids,
[00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:12.740]   while making sure people who needed them actually got them.
[00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:15.580]   And the second time, it was about COVID therapeutics.
[00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:18.340]   It was about making sure that when we had data
[00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:20.340]   about medicines that actually work, like Paxovit,
[00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:22.700]   that we actually offered them to patients,
[00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:24.420]   made them available to patients,
[00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:25.700]   'cause we were realizing that many people
[00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:28.060]   weren't getting offered life-saving medications,
[00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:30.220]   even though they were in high-risk groups.
[00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:32.660]   So, we were able to find, and we had to, again,
[00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:35.160]   there too, had to creatively cobble together
[00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:36.000]   resources, funding.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.280]   This is all sort of behind-the-scenes government stuff.
[00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:44.460]   But the bottom line is, what you want in an emergency,
[00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:46.620]   and what you want, I think, in the long term,
[00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:49.800]   is a simple, clear, comprehensive way
[00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:51.660]   that public health messages can get out to people.
[00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:54.240]   And to this day, what we still have to rely on
[00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:57.500]   are, one, traditional channels, like traditional media,
[00:27:57.500 --> 00:27:59.680]   to cover the initiatives we put out,
[00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:01.660]   whether it's on social media and youth mental health,
[00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:04.420]   or on loneliness, or on youth mental health more broadly.
[00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:09.300]   We have to rely on online channels, which we do as well.
[00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:11.400]   Or we have to look to creative partnerships
[00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:13.860]   that we build with people who reach different audiences,
[00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:16.220]   and then together, we try to get at messages.
[00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:18.380]   Our office does all three of these,
[00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:23.380]   but it's a patchwork, and it's not always ideal,
[00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:24.600]   but it's what we do now.
[00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:28.100]   I think part of what this reflects is a broader challenge,
[00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:31.920]   like in government, but also in society more broadly,
[00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:36.340]   which is that we have valued, historically,
[00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:39.760]   prevention and health communication, very little.
[00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:43.080]   We have put the mass majority of our resources
[00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:44.740]   into treatment strategies,
[00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:48.860]   into getting medications to people, into diagnosis,
[00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:51.320]   and that's very important, don't get me wrong.
[00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:53.080]   But we are now seeing, with mental health,
[00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:54.880]   this is one example,
[00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:58.800]   that if we only focus on expanding treatment
[00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:00.640]   and deepening our well of knowledge there,
[00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:03.480]   and we don't do anything to help people stay well,
[00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:05.600]   then we just can't keep up, right?
[00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:07.520]   - Right, because one problem feeds the other.
[00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:08.900]   - Exactly. - The kids that are,
[00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:11.640]   listen, if I had grown up in today's era,
[00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:13.380]   I'd be on my phone and tablet late at night,
[00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:14.800]   'cause I was up reading magazines
[00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:16.800]   and talking to friends on the phone late at night, right?
[00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:21.000]   So it's not a criticism, but disruptions in sleep,
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:22.560]   disruptions in circadian rhythm,
[00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:24.780]   disruptions, lack of physical activity,
[00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:27.440]   poor nutrition, social isolation,
[00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:30.120]   I mean, these are all piling the sand much higher
[00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:32.840]   on this, in this other side of what you do,
[00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:35.940]   in terms of, and here I'm obviously stating the obvious.
[00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:39.700]   You know, so it's just gonna create a mountain of issues
[00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:42.280]   on the other side, which presumably has a larger budget,
[00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:44.300]   is what I'm sensing, but doesn't,
[00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:46.040]   but there's no way that budget
[00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:47.240]   is large enough to deal with that.
[00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:49.880]   I mean, if somebody's kid, for instance,
[00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:53.060]   is trying to address the issue of whether or not
[00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:57.580]   to go on prescription medications and/or,
[00:29:57.580 --> 00:30:00.560]   by the way, folks, and/or change their dietary intake
[00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:03.380]   because they feel they might have ADHD, for instance,
[00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:04.940]   I mean, what are they gonna do?
[00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:06.980]   They're gonna Google, they're gonna listen to podcasts,
[00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:11.500]   they should be able to write first to your organization
[00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:15.780]   and say, you know, what does the highest level stringency
[00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:17.620]   data say about these issues?
[00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:21.900]   And AI should be able to tell them, accurately.
[00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:24.900]   And maybe you have somebody chime in for them.
[00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:27.820]   I mean, we all pay taxes.
[00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:30.300]   I pay federal and state taxes.
[00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:31.140]   - Me too.
[00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:34.540]   - And to some extent, happily so, right?
[00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:37.220]   'Cause it pays for public works and many,
[00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:38.820]   many important things, police officers,
[00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:40.020]   firefighters, et cetera.
[00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:44.300]   But if you don't have a channel to communicate with people
[00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:49.300]   about what they and their kids and their relatives can do,
[00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:54.900]   then to some extent, it feels like it's a cul-de-sac.
[00:30:54.900 --> 00:31:00.940]   It's like, how in the world can we get healthy again
[00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:03.180]   or healthier as a country?
[00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:06.040]   - The part that keeps me up at night is,
[00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:07.420]   and one of some of the hardest decisions
[00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:10.820]   I have to make in the office are putting aside issues
[00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:14.340]   that we know deserve a lot more time and attention,
[00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:16.940]   but we just really don't have the resources to deal with.
[00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:18.460]   You know, the issues that we have dealt with,
[00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:21.240]   I'm certainly proud of my team that we've worked hard
[00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:23.700]   to try to raise awareness of the issues we have taken on,
[00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:26.980]   whether it's around social media and youth and mental health
[00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:29.700]   or whether it's around isolation or clinician burnout
[00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:31.540]   or other issues like that.
[00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:34.540]   But the truth is that there's more that needs to be done,
[00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:36.060]   more issues that need to be tackled.
[00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:39.940]   And we have to get to a place where we can talk about
[00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:43.260]   what I think of as the core pillars of a healthy life,
[00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:47.680]   which are sleep, our nutrition, our physical activity,
[00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:49.380]   our social relationships.
[00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:52.960]   These are all vital elements to living a healthy life.
[00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:56.560]   Right now, we're not teaching kids about this in school,
[00:31:56.560 --> 00:31:59.620]   but if you think about education and school
[00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:04.620]   as a place and a force that should prep kids
[00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:08.380]   for the rest of their lives, it should lay a foundation
[00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:10.480]   for a healthy life going forward.
[00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:12.820]   These absolutely are important elements
[00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:13.660]   for kids to learn about.
[00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:16.060]   I think it's as important for kids to learn
[00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:18.620]   about how to build and maintain healthy relationships
[00:32:18.620 --> 00:32:21.160]   in their life as it is, frankly, for them to learn
[00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:22.360]   how to read and write.
[00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:23.980]   And I know that's a strong statement to make,
[00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:26.120]   but it is true in terms of its contribution
[00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:28.300]   to their happiness or fulfillment,
[00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:29.740]   their health and their success.
[00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:33.060]   - Yeah, I could not agree more.
[00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:35.760]   We have a series that's out now with a psychiatrist,
[00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:38.540]   Paul Conte, about mental health, not mental illness,
[00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:41.120]   about self-inquiry and how to use self-inquiry
[00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:44.420]   in practices that do not require a therapist
[00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:46.540]   in order to bolster mental health.
[00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:49.340]   Of course, therapists can be very useful,
[00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:51.140]   but not everyone has access.
[00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:53.600]   And not everyone feels comfortable doing that.
[00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:56.140]   But we are but one channel.
[00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:59.620]   I mean, you are the governing body for this.
[00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:04.620]   You're the Army, Navy and Marines, so to speak, of health.
[00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:08.300]   As many of you know, I've been taking AG1 daily since 2012.
[00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:10.780]   So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:13.060]   AG1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:14.820]   that's designed to meet all of your foundational
[00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:16.140]   nutrition needs.
[00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:17.760]   Now, of course, I try to get enough servings
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:20.060]   of vitamins and minerals through whole food sources
[00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:22.300]   that include vegetables and fruits every day,
[00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:24.980]   but oftentimes I simply can't get enough servings.
[00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:27.940]   But with AG1, I'm sure to get enough vitamins and minerals
[00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:29.700]   and the probiotics that I need,
[00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:32.880]   and it also contains adaptogens to help buffer stress.
[00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:35.680]   Simply put, I always feel better when I take AG1.
[00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:38.220]   I have more focus and energy and I sleep better,
[00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:40.460]   and it also happens to taste great.
[00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:42.300]   For all these reasons, whenever I'm asked,
[00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:45.020]   if you could take just one supplement, what would it be?
[00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:46.700]   I answer, AG1.
[00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:51.260]   If you'd like to try AG1, go to drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:52.860]   to claim a special offer.
[00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:54.620]   They'll give you five free travel packs
[00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:57.280]   plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:33:57.280 --> 00:34:00.940]   Again, that's drinkag1.com/huberman.
[00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:03.860]   There's lots more to explore there.
[00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:07.160]   We may have to do several of these together,
[00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:08.900]   but to touch on all of them,
[00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:11.200]   but maybe we could talk about a few of the things
[00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:15.980]   that our listeners asked about
[00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:18.880]   when I solicited for questions.
[00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:22.940]   I got more than 10,000 responses across social media
[00:34:22.940 --> 00:34:24.260]   in a very short amount of time,
[00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:26.400]   but there was some redundancy.
[00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:27.860]   One of the things that I'm very curious-
[00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:28.960]   - Can I just say on that point though?
[00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:29.800]   - Yeah, please.
[00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:31.800]   - One, I'm really glad that you asked folks
[00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:33.660]   to submit questions, and I was really excited
[00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:35.840]   to see how many people actually wrote in,
[00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:38.500]   but I think it's also just a testament
[00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:41.120]   to how you've done such an incredible job
[00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:43.740]   of building a channel that the public,
[00:34:43.740 --> 00:34:46.940]   to let people know about these topics
[00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:48.680]   that are so vital to our health and wellbeing,
[00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:51.780]   whether it's sleep or physical activity or mental health.
[00:34:51.780 --> 00:34:52.940]   And so I just want to thank you
[00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:53.960]   for all the work you're doing
[00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:56.100]   trying to help people understand more about health.
[00:34:56.100 --> 00:34:58.340]   And clearly the fact that folks are engaging,
[00:34:58.340 --> 00:34:59.300]   they're sending questions,
[00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:00.780]   and they're sending comments to you
[00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:02.300]   means that you're building a relationship there
[00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:03.140]   with a lot of folks.
[00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:04.620]   So just kudos to you for doing that.
[00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:05.580]   - Well, thank you.
[00:35:05.580 --> 00:35:08.020]   The audience of the Huberman Lab podcast
[00:35:08.020 --> 00:35:10.300]   is the only reason we do it.
[00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:13.680]   I mean, I love learning and teaching, but that's the truth.
[00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:15.440]   So they are the podcast.
[00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:16.580]   The podcast is them.
[00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:18.720]   So thank you for that.
[00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:23.340]   There were a lot of questions,
[00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:26.760]   and I also wonder about why is it
[00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:31.760]   that many food additives and preservatives
[00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:34.960]   and dyes and things of that sort
[00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:37.120]   that are not allowed in Europe
[00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:39.240]   are allowed in US food products?
[00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:41.140]   - Mm, that's a really good question.
[00:35:41.140 --> 00:35:46.140]   And decisions around food and food safety in particular
[00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:48.700]   are made by the Food and Drug Administration,
[00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:49.800]   so that's the FDA.
[00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:53.820]   It's not, it's a separate independent agency.
[00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:56.740]   It's not one that our office is involved in
[00:35:56.740 --> 00:35:59.580]   and sort of directing in any way.
[00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:01.980]   And so we're not involved in those decisions
[00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:04.420]   and don't have insight into how they're making their,
[00:36:04.420 --> 00:36:05.400]   drawing their conclusions,
[00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:08.860]   but they do it in a process that's, you know,
[00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:11.420]   guided by science, just like they do with medications,
[00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:13.160]   with devices, et cetera.
[00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:16.560]   With that said, you know, I am concerned
[00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:19.560]   that dietary practices,
[00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:22.300]   the food that many Americans are consuming,
[00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:25.480]   are in fact not supporting their health and wellbeing
[00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:27.600]   and in many ways are detracting from it.
[00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:30.780]   When we look at highly processed foods,
[00:36:30.780 --> 00:36:32.580]   one of the concerns I have there
[00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:35.340]   is we often see sodium content is very high.
[00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:38.500]   We see the sugar content is very high.
[00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:41.700]   And you know, there are certainly additives in there as well
[00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:44.460]   that I think we, I would love to have more data
[00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:46.860]   on the actual health impacts of those.
[00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:49.500]   But the bottom line is that a significant portion
[00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:54.100]   of our diet is comprised of highly processed foods
[00:36:54.100 --> 00:36:57.060]   in America and that worries me.
[00:36:57.060 --> 00:36:58.900]   The other piece of this that worries me
[00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:03.720]   are just how much refined sugars are being added
[00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:04.740]   to so much of our foods.
[00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:07.080]   And most people think that sugars are only added
[00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:09.280]   to things like desserts, et cetera.
[00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:10.720]   But you look at spaghetti sauces.
[00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:11.560]   - Salad dressings.
[00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:12.520]   - Salad dressings.
[00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:15.720]   A lot of these things which we think of as savory products
[00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:17.880]   have sugar added to them as well.
[00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:21.280]   And so we are consuming, I think,
[00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:23.940]   unhealthy levels of sugar in our diet.
[00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:26.560]   We're consuming a fair amount of additives
[00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:29.360]   given the processed food composition in our diet.
[00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:31.240]   And I think part of the reason this is happening,
[00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:32.640]   and I want to be very clear,
[00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:35.560]   I don't fault individuals out there
[00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:38.080]   for the composition of their diet necessarily
[00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:41.520]   because we have also made certain decisions
[00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:44.840]   in our country about what we subsidize,
[00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:47.360]   about what's cheaper and more expensive for people.
[00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:49.800]   And the cheapest foods, unfortunately,
[00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:51.360]   are often the most unhealthy foods,
[00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:53.280]   the most highly processed foods.
[00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:54.600]   If you are somebody who lives
[00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:56.880]   in the low-income neighborhood,
[00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:57.800]   a number of these neighborhoods
[00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:00.200]   don't even have grocery stores in them,
[00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:02.120]   which is a tragedy
[00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:04.500]   because you can't get fresh produce, et cetera.
[00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:05.840]   A lot of times your shopping,
[00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:07.680]   your grocery shopping may be done
[00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:09.640]   at a local convenience store,
[00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:13.340]   at a 7-Eleven or somewhere else
[00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:17.100]   that may not have the array of fresh fruits and vegetables
[00:38:17.100 --> 00:38:18.600]   that you and your family need.
[00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:20.840]   - I don't even think they have vegetables.
[00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:23.400]   I think they'll occasionally have some lemons or apples
[00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:25.000]   or oranges and bananas.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.380]   But when I walk into a convenience store,
[00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:29.460]   what I see is a pharmacy.
[00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:30.300]   I really do.
[00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:32.720]   I see alcohol, caffeine, energy drinks
[00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:34.360]   that have a number of different things in them
[00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:36.420]   designed to stimulate different neuromodulators
[00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:38.760]   like dopamine and serotonin.
[00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:40.960]   I see nicotine products.
[00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:43.880]   I see high sugar, highly processed foods.
[00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:45.820]   And keep in mind, I was a teenager.
[00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:47.880]   I mean, I drank my Slurpees.
[00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:49.600]   I had my Butterfingers.
[00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:51.680]   You know, I wasn't Bart Simpson-like
[00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:53.640]   in my level of Butterfingers, but I liked them.
[00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:57.440]   But it was a smaller fraction of what we ate.
[00:38:57.440 --> 00:38:58.540]   And when we were at home,
[00:38:58.540 --> 00:39:00.740]   those foods were either not available
[00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:03.100]   or we certainly weren't allowed to eat them
[00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:05.180]   and ad lib them, you know?
[00:39:05.180 --> 00:39:06.340]   - Yeah.
[00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:08.400]   - Okay, so what's clear to me is that the FDA
[00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:11.440]   makes decisions about what is safe, what's not safe.
[00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:15.400]   But for instance, okay, this last year,
[00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:16.660]   there were several papers published
[00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:18.800]   in high quality journals showing that
[00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:23.800]   if people eat just sweet and savory foods combined,
[00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:27.920]   that neural circuits in the brain rewire
[00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:29.500]   through process of neuroplasticity,
[00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:31.700]   that drives increased appetite,
[00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:34.780]   and changes the response to healthier foods
[00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:37.440]   so that they don't taste as satiating.
[00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:41.200]   Okay, that's sort of a duh to a lot of people,
[00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:43.440]   but I think it was an important set of findings
[00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:44.900]   because it said the brain actually changes
[00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:49.760]   in response to the very rich, flavorful foods
[00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:51.520]   that are associated with highly processed
[00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:53.700]   or even moderately processed foods.
[00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:58.700]   Okay, I mean, that's just a couple of studies.
[00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:02.040]   There was nothing in those studies that said
[00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:04.960]   if you eat these foods, you're going to develop cancer.
[00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:07.440]   But, you know, at some point one has to,
[00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:09.680]   as a citizen, a taxpaying citizen,
[00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:11.700]   speaking on behalf of many other taxpaying citizens,
[00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:13.720]   I have to sort of take a step back and say,
[00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:15.400]   how long do we wait, right?
[00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:17.620]   Do we have to get a randomized clinical trial
[00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:22.620]   about the 500,000 sick kids that grow into sick adults
[00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:28.960]   and then run a trial where they go on an elimination diet
[00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:31.080]   where they're eating only unprocessed vegan
[00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:32.840]   or unprocessed meat and vegetable
[00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:36.000]   or unprocessed starch and vegetable.
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.180]   I mean, then we're talking about a 30-year health crisis
[00:40:39.180 --> 00:40:40.400]   before we intervene.
[00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:43.560]   Why not, I mean, if I were in charge, which I'm not,
[00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:46.360]   and clearly I wouldn't survive in a government organization
[00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:49.000]   because, well, I've got the uniform down.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:52.240]   I always wear the same thing, a uniform,
[00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:55.240]   but I wouldn't because I would want to say, wait,
[00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:58.060]   you know, why not err on the side of caution?
[00:40:58.060 --> 00:41:00.960]   Why not send out this AI-generated text message
[00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:02.820]   that tells everybody in all the languages
[00:41:02.820 --> 00:41:04.540]   that Americans speak and can understand,
[00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:07.440]   hey, you get to make choices about what you eat,
[00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:11.020]   but you should be aware that making your diet
[00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:15.200]   comprised of more than 15 to 20% of these foods
[00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:17.800]   is potentially going to lead to serious issues down the road
[00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:20.160]   and those serious issues are extremely serious.
[00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:22.500]   I mean, the obesity crisis is really a crisis
[00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:25.760]   of both body and brain metabolic challenge
[00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:27.700]   that we can talk about.
[00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:30.600]   So, you know, who sets the thresholds?
[00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:33.560]   You know, in other words, why is it that in this country
[00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:36.960]   we have to wait until people start to get really sick
[00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:39.260]   and dying and really struggling
[00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:41.640]   before something is done in the direction of their health?
[00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:42.600]   And I'm not blaming you.
[00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:44.960]   I just want to understand because--
[00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:46.080]   - Good question.
[00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:48.420]   - The wealthy people I know
[00:41:48.420 --> 00:41:50.400]   care a lot about their food sources
[00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:52.080]   and they pay a lot of attention to it.
[00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:54.840]   And why aren't we allowing everyone the opportunity
[00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:56.380]   to make better choices?
[00:41:56.380 --> 00:41:57.840]   - So this is the right question
[00:41:57.840 --> 00:41:59.860]   and this is something I think about a lot
[00:41:59.860 --> 00:42:01.700]   because I'm conscious about what I eat,
[00:42:01.700 --> 00:42:03.520]   but I also talk to folks around the country
[00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:05.640]   and realize a lot of people don't have
[00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:08.600]   either the information or the resources
[00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:10.880]   to actually purchase healthy food, right?
[00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:12.680]   And to know what's gonna be good for them
[00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:13.980]   and for their families.
[00:42:13.980 --> 00:42:16.220]   This is why I mentioned we have a list of issues
[00:42:16.220 --> 00:42:20.240]   that we would work on if we had more resources.
[00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:22.200]   This is actually one of them because to me,
[00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:25.320]   one of the most common questions people ask is
[00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:26.200]   what should I eat?
[00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:30.220]   That's simple, but it's vexing, it's complicated,
[00:42:30.220 --> 00:42:32.200]   and it's incredibly confusing if you go online
[00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:34.400]   and just try to search for information.
[00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:37.400]   And it's a classic example of where it's important
[00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:41.160]   to have an objective scientific authority
[00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:44.280]   that can come and then speak on broad principles
[00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:46.040]   around diet, that can talk about what we know
[00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:47.120]   and don't know.
[00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:48.340]   So here's the important thing.
[00:42:48.340 --> 00:42:52.160]   I think a lot of times people may see something
[00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:55.440]   as on the market, they might read a list of ingredients,
[00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:57.760]   they don't recognize half of them 'cause they're additives,
[00:42:57.760 --> 00:42:59.800]   but they figure, well, if it's there,
[00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:02.160]   then it must have been studied for 30, 40 years
[00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:04.520]   and there must be no harmful consequences, right?
[00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:06.360]   But sometimes things are put out there
[00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:07.960]   because we have short-term data that says
[00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:10.640]   that they're okay, but there may be a need
[00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:11.520]   for more long-term data.
[00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:13.080]   Helping people understand what do we know,
[00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:14.560]   what do we not know is important
[00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:17.120]   so that people can make decisions for themselves
[00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:19.040]   based on how much risk they wanna take.
[00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:20.800]   The other thing that concerns me here, Andrew,
[00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:25.800]   is I, look, I'll tell you, I have a bias here
[00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:31.480]   and my bias is that I am worried about the additives
[00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:34.520]   and other products we have in food
[00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:36.920]   that don't have long-term data that's clear
[00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:38.120]   in terms of health risk.
[00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:40.860]   And so because of that, my bias is generally to think,
[00:43:40.860 --> 00:43:45.280]   how can we get people minimally or less processed foods
[00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:47.200]   and how can we get them more fruits and vegetables,
[00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:48.720]   how can we make sure that they have that
[00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:49.960]   more available to them?
[00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:52.020]   But we've got to not only make the information available,
[00:43:52.020 --> 00:43:55.180]   but we have to make it accessible from a cost perspective.
[00:43:55.180 --> 00:43:57.180]   If you don't have a grocery store in your community,
[00:43:57.180 --> 00:44:01.200]   if vegetables and fruits cost 3X what other foods do,
[00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:03.400]   that's gonna be a problem, right, to change diet.
[00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:05.520]   The other thing we have to keep in mind is that,
[00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:07.280]   you know, food companies, you know,
[00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:09.280]   a lot of them do a great job of actually trying
[00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:11.440]   to get healthy, nutritious food out to people,
[00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:12.960]   you know, and kudos to them.
[00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:16.520]   But I worry also that there's an incentive also
[00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:18.800]   to just try to sell more and more and more of your product.
[00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:22.140]   And one of the ways to do that is to try to hack the body
[00:44:22.140 --> 00:44:23.520]   to kind of figure out, okay, well,
[00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:27.100]   what kind of synthetic additives could I put together here
[00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:29.560]   or what kind of combination of nutrients
[00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:31.640]   could I put together that will get people coming back
[00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:32.960]   for more and more and more?
[00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:35.200]   - And we saw this in the nicotine industry.
[00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:37.280]   - You saw the nicotine industry, you also,
[00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:38.800]   I would say another, it parallels,
[00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:40.580]   you see it in social media as well,
[00:44:40.580 --> 00:44:44.720]   where the business model of the social media platforms
[00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:47.180]   is built on volume of use, right?
[00:44:47.180 --> 00:44:49.760]   How much time am I spending on the platforms?
[00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:52.600]   It's not quality of time, it's quantity of time, right?
[00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:54.080]   So if that's the business model,
[00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:55.720]   then you're going to design your platform
[00:44:55.720 --> 00:44:58.440]   to maximize how much time someone spends on them,
[00:44:58.440 --> 00:45:00.720]   regardless of whether it's detracting from sleep,
[00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:02.340]   detracting from in-person interaction,
[00:45:02.340 --> 00:45:04.740]   detracting from anything else that's healthy,
[00:45:04.740 --> 00:45:07.000]   regardless of whether that may be causing certain harms,
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.720]   right, like the business model dictates, you know,
[00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:11.660]   in many ways how these things are designed.
[00:45:11.660 --> 00:45:13.580]   And that applies, I think, to food as well.
[00:45:13.580 --> 00:45:15.720]   So which is why I think it's incumbent upon us
[00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:19.660]   to be particularly cautious with highly processed foods,
[00:45:19.660 --> 00:45:22.040]   foods that have additives, and to understand
[00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:24.040]   how is this impacting our brain?
[00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:26.580]   How is that impacting our satiety?
[00:45:26.580 --> 00:45:30.660]   How is it leading potentially to greater ingestion
[00:45:30.660 --> 00:45:33.000]   that is healthy and leading to things like obesity,
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:35.240]   which have a whole host of other medical conditions
[00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:37.440]   from cancer to arthritis to diabetes
[00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:39.700]   and heart disease associated with it?
[00:45:39.700 --> 00:45:42.540]   Those are the questions as a citizen,
[00:45:42.540 --> 00:45:44.840]   as a father of two young kids who's trying to bring them up
[00:45:44.840 --> 00:45:46.520]   with a healthy lifestyle, those are the questions
[00:45:46.520 --> 00:45:48.640]   that I would wanna know the answers to.
[00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:49.640]   And it's one of the reasons I think
[00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:51.680]   these kind of objective reports
[00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:53.320]   are so important for the public.
[00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:57.280]   - I was trying to see the scope of the problem
[00:45:57.280 --> 00:46:00.160]   and the mechanics involved in trying
[00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:02.920]   to alleviate these issues are complex.
[00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:04.800]   I see that.
[00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:06.720]   - They aren't all so, one other thing that is important
[00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:11.380]   to do, though, is you need to have authorities
[00:46:11.380 --> 00:46:14.920]   that can speak to these issues that are insulated
[00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:16.960]   from political retribution, right?
[00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:19.560]   So, and to explain this, like--
[00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:20.660]   - Amen to that.
[00:46:20.660 --> 00:46:21.660]   - Yeah, look, I--
[00:46:21.660 --> 00:46:24.000]   - I mean, listen, as somebody, forgive me for interrupting,
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:25.820]   but as somebody who, from time to time,
[00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:29.660]   will make not recommendations, but will offer information
[00:46:29.660 --> 00:46:32.720]   about potential actionable items,
[00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:34.160]   things that people could do or not do,
[00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:36.800]   according to a couple of studies that have come out.
[00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:39.920]   I mean, I've come under intense scrutiny from my colleagues
[00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:43.060]   who are like, wait, that's not a randomized controlled trial.
[00:46:43.060 --> 00:46:43.980]   How can you do that?
[00:46:43.980 --> 00:46:47.520]   And yet, I know from being in this field for a long time
[00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:49.620]   that, for instance, the emerging therapies
[00:46:49.620 --> 00:46:52.140]   for PTSD and depression that are now based
[00:46:52.140 --> 00:46:54.120]   on federal funding for things like,
[00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:55.840]   and I'm not recommending this, by the way,
[00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:57.740]   for children or for everybody, but for instance,
[00:46:57.740 --> 00:47:02.740]   the macrodosilicibin therapeutically supported legal use
[00:47:02.740 --> 00:47:06.500]   of psilocybin for major depression.
[00:47:06.500 --> 00:47:08.360]   The data there, they're not perfect,
[00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:09.980]   but they're pretty darn good compared
[00:47:09.980 --> 00:47:11.580]   to the major SSRIs.
[00:47:11.580 --> 00:47:16.040]   But for years, if an academic said the words I just said,
[00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:18.500]   they'd lose their job almost instantaneously
[00:47:18.500 --> 00:47:20.940]   'cause they're controlled substances.
[00:47:20.940 --> 00:47:23.740]   That's a to-do, but then there are a number of things
[00:47:23.740 --> 00:47:24.580]   that we're talking about here
[00:47:24.580 --> 00:47:26.820]   that are just about making better choices
[00:47:26.820 --> 00:47:28.380]   about things to avoid.
[00:47:28.380 --> 00:47:32.460]   If people understood, I think, that, is sugar poison?
[00:47:32.460 --> 00:47:34.460]   Well, some of my audience will say sugar is poison.
[00:47:34.460 --> 00:47:35.740]   It's as addictive as cocaine.
[00:47:35.740 --> 00:47:38.540]   Look, it is not as addictive as cocaine or heroin.
[00:47:38.540 --> 00:47:39.420]   It is not.
[00:47:39.420 --> 00:47:44.420]   However, if a child or adult is eating very sweet
[00:47:44.420 --> 00:47:47.600]   or very savory foods of any kind consistently,
[00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:50.000]   if those are not healthy foods
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:52.840]   or if they contain unhealthy additives,
[00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:54.500]   over time, the brain will rewire
[00:47:54.500 --> 00:47:56.780]   so that healthy foods don't taste as good.
[00:47:56.780 --> 00:47:59.420]   They won't be the choices that people make,
[00:47:59.420 --> 00:48:02.220]   and you're gonna end up with a sick individual, period.
[00:48:02.220 --> 00:48:05.780]   And I don't think we need one more clinical trial
[00:48:05.780 --> 00:48:09.540]   funded by federal tax dollars to support that statement.
[00:48:09.540 --> 00:48:12.060]   What I'm starting to gather is that you're a very rational,
[00:48:12.060 --> 00:48:13.820]   grounded, broad-thinking individual.
[00:48:13.820 --> 00:48:15.540]   I'm not just saying that 'cause you're sitting here,
[00:48:15.540 --> 00:48:17.940]   and you're trained in medicine,
[00:48:17.940 --> 00:48:19.460]   and you understand the science,
[00:48:19.460 --> 00:48:24.340]   but that you don't have the means at your disposal
[00:48:24.340 --> 00:48:25.480]   to put out a call that says,
[00:48:25.480 --> 00:48:27.640]   "Hey, folks, having some sugar every once in a while,
[00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:29.780]   "it's reading the kids to ice cream, great."
[00:48:29.780 --> 00:48:34.260]   But if 80% or more of the diet of our kids
[00:48:34.260 --> 00:48:37.340]   isn't made up of minimally or non-processed foods,
[00:48:37.340 --> 00:48:39.940]   their brains are gonna be rewired in unhealthy ways,
[00:48:39.940 --> 00:48:42.840]   and you can almost expect that they're going to have
[00:48:42.840 --> 00:48:44.700]   some health challenge in the future
[00:48:44.700 --> 00:48:49.700]   that may not be autism or schizophrenia,
[00:48:49.700 --> 00:48:53.180]   but is going to be a major health challenge.
[00:48:53.180 --> 00:48:56.060]   And that is serious, and now's the time to intervene
[00:48:56.060 --> 00:48:57.740]   by avoiding certain things.
[00:48:57.740 --> 00:48:58.700]   And if you don't wanna do it,
[00:48:58.700 --> 00:49:00.220]   look, it's a free country at that level.
[00:49:00.220 --> 00:49:01.480]   You're welcome to do it,
[00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:03.820]   but you'd be better off spending X number of dollars
[00:49:03.820 --> 00:49:06.660]   on these healthier foods, because there's also,
[00:49:06.660 --> 00:49:08.020]   and we know this from my colleague,
[00:49:08.020 --> 00:49:10.120]   Ali Krum's laboratory at Stanford,
[00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:11.820]   that even the mere knowledge
[00:49:11.820 --> 00:49:13.500]   that certain foods are nutritious
[00:49:13.500 --> 00:49:16.120]   can lead to more satiety from eating those foods
[00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:17.860]   at the level of hormone release,
[00:49:17.860 --> 00:49:19.660]   not just psychologically, you're telling yourself
[00:49:19.660 --> 00:49:23.500]   that the orange is as tasty and filling as a candy bar,
[00:49:23.500 --> 00:49:28.360]   but the understanding of the fact that it is nutritious
[00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:30.860]   actually leads to shifts in patterns
[00:49:30.860 --> 00:49:33.900]   of ghrelin secretion, et cetera,
[00:49:33.900 --> 00:49:36.960]   that change, so people can be feel better
[00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:40.420]   on a healthier, slightly lower calorie,
[00:49:40.420 --> 00:49:42.900]   nutrient-enriched diet of healthy proteins
[00:49:42.900 --> 00:49:44.920]   and fruits and vegetables.
[00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:48.940]   And it's not a mind trick, it's physiology.
[00:49:48.940 --> 00:49:53.820]   Anyway, I think I feel your pain, frankly.
[00:49:53.820 --> 00:49:55.260]   - And I'll tell you, look, sometimes people ask,
[00:49:55.260 --> 00:49:56.500]   hey, why don't you just go out and say
[00:49:56.500 --> 00:49:58.280]   a couple of statements that you just said?
[00:49:58.280 --> 00:49:59.120]   Would that be fine?
[00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:02.200]   Why is time needed to prep something like that?
[00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:03.900]   Why are resources needed, et cetera?
[00:50:03.900 --> 00:50:04.900]   Here's actually why.
[00:50:04.900 --> 00:50:06.300]   I know in today's day and age,
[00:50:06.300 --> 00:50:09.900]   it's easy to just go and rattle off off-the-cuff statements
[00:50:09.900 --> 00:50:10.740]   or shoot from the hip, et cetera.
[00:50:10.740 --> 00:50:13.440]   - You're welcome on my social media channels any time,
[00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:15.520]   really, to get their word out to millions of people.
[00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:17.800]   - No, I appreciate that, and I may take you up on that.
[00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:19.080]   But I'll tell you that one of the reasons,
[00:50:19.080 --> 00:50:20.200]   one of the things we always do,
[00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:23.000]   recognizing that when we put out statements,
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:26.640]   that people, one, they trust it's coming
[00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:29.560]   from a scientific authority and that it's been vetted, right?
[00:50:29.560 --> 00:50:32.880]   So we put the effort and time into vetting this thoroughly.
[00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:36.040]   We check sources, we look at the data, we talk to experts,
[00:50:36.040 --> 00:50:38.780]   we think about how to communicate this in the right way.
[00:50:38.780 --> 00:50:41.400]   That's the work, the behind-the-scenes work
[00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:45.000]   that we do before we put out reports and initiatives.
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:46.960]   Because we want people to have confidence
[00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:48.220]   in what they're hearing.
[00:50:48.220 --> 00:50:50.600]   We also know that when we put out initiatives,
[00:50:50.600 --> 00:50:51.960]   that other people build on them.
[00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:54.940]   Philanthropists and foundations will then think about,
[00:50:54.940 --> 00:50:57.440]   should I fund work in this area?
[00:50:57.440 --> 00:50:59.420]   Schools and workplaces will think about
[00:50:59.420 --> 00:51:00.800]   shifting some of their practice.
[00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:03.600]   Policymakers will also think about legislation
[00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:06.200]   that they may want to design based on that.
[00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:08.320]   So we want to make sure it's really solid.
[00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:10.680]   But the point I was making when I said also that
[00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:13.140]   we have to make sure that, not just our office,
[00:51:13.140 --> 00:51:17.520]   but folks who are in public health and who are in medicine,
[00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:19.600]   who are trying to speak to the public about their health,
[00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:22.800]   that they are protected from retribution and taxes.
[00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:23.640]   This is what I meant,
[00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:26.800]   which is that saying things about diet,
[00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:29.620]   saying things about tobacco,
[00:51:29.620 --> 00:51:31.880]   these can be challenging for some folks
[00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:34.400]   because there are industries built around these, right?
[00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:36.980]   Which may not always like what you have to say
[00:51:36.980 --> 00:51:40.160]   if it hurts their business model or their bottom line.
[00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:44.000]   And they may then lean on political leaders,
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:46.680]   elected leaders, others to then try to silence you
[00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:47.520]   or shut you up.
[00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:50.380]   And I'll tell you, I've experienced this in the past.
[00:51:50.380 --> 00:51:53.700]   You know, I was Surgeon General during my first term.
[00:51:53.700 --> 00:51:56.980]   I had issued two key reports.
[00:51:56.980 --> 00:51:58.900]   One was on alcohol, drugs, and health
[00:51:58.900 --> 00:52:00.860]   about the addiction crisis.
[00:52:00.860 --> 00:52:04.620]   And the other was about the e-cigarette crisis among youth.
[00:52:04.620 --> 00:52:06.400]   I will tell you that there were plenty of people
[00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:09.340]   who were very unhappy that I was issuing
[00:52:09.340 --> 00:52:12.140]   the first federal report on e-cigarettes.
[00:52:12.140 --> 00:52:15.860]   Folks who felt that, hey, this is gonna make folks unhappy.
[00:52:15.860 --> 00:52:17.960]   It's gonna create political pressure.
[00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:20.520]   It's gonna create a lot of problems.
[00:52:20.520 --> 00:52:22.640]   Similarly, with alcohol, drugs, and health,
[00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:24.240]   there are many folks who said, hey, if you do this,
[00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:26.360]   you're really gonna upset the alcohol industry.
[00:52:26.360 --> 00:52:28.240]   Do you really need to have alcohol in the report?
[00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:30.600]   Why don't you just focus on other drugs?
[00:52:30.600 --> 00:52:32.480]   Why don't you take alcohol out of the title?
[00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:35.080]   You know, all of these sort of concerns were raised--
[00:52:35.080 --> 00:52:36.360]   - Who was telling you this?
[00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:39.240]   So these are people who get paid by the alcohol industry?
[00:52:39.240 --> 00:52:40.520]   - No, these are people in government
[00:52:40.520 --> 00:52:41.740]   who are reading the tea leaves
[00:52:41.740 --> 00:52:43.600]   and who are supportive of the work we're doing
[00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:46.020]   but are saying, hey, you're gonna really upset
[00:52:46.020 --> 00:52:48.120]   a lot of people in the industry.
[00:52:48.120 --> 00:52:49.280]   - You're also gonna help a lot of people.
[00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:50.980]   - Yeah, well, this is what it comes down to.
[00:52:50.980 --> 00:52:52.920]   They say, well, and if you upset folks,
[00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:54.160]   then they're gonna try to fire you.
[00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:55.520]   They're gonna try to do all these things.
[00:52:55.520 --> 00:52:59.000]   To which, honestly, my response to a lot of these,
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:01.300]   and the reason we just put them out anyway,
[00:53:01.300 --> 00:53:04.160]   was because I said, well, the worst thing that can happen
[00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:06.400]   is I get fired, and that's okay.
[00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:09.200]   You know, if I go out knowing I did the right thing here,
[00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:10.100]   then I'm fine with that.
[00:53:10.100 --> 00:53:13.360]   I'm not looking to build a lifelong career in government.
[00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:15.680]   I'm not doing this job to get to the next thing
[00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:17.000]   on the ladder.
[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:19.700]   This is about serving for the time I can.
[00:53:19.700 --> 00:53:21.160]   I want to be able to go to sleep at night,
[00:53:21.160 --> 00:53:24.060]   look myself in the mirror, and know I did so with integrity.
[00:53:24.060 --> 00:53:25.940]   So that was an easy decision for me.
[00:53:25.940 --> 00:53:30.280]   But my point is that we have to be thoughtful
[00:53:30.280 --> 00:53:33.420]   in these issues that they're gonna be headwinds.
[00:53:33.420 --> 00:53:34.920]   I'm sure in your case, for example,
[00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:36.820]   you've probably gotten pushback from folks
[00:53:36.820 --> 00:53:38.540]   about talking about certain things
[00:53:38.540 --> 00:53:40.900]   that may have rankled folks who may have had an interest
[00:53:40.900 --> 00:53:41.820]   in those issues, and that's okay.
[00:53:41.820 --> 00:53:43.560]   You keep talking about them as you should,
[00:53:43.560 --> 00:53:45.100]   and I'm grateful for that.
[00:53:46.100 --> 00:53:48.840]   But this is especially important at a time
[00:53:48.840 --> 00:53:53.840]   where I think public trust in our institutions more broadly
[00:53:53.840 --> 00:53:56.800]   and in science and in medicine have taken a hit
[00:53:56.800 --> 00:53:58.720]   over the last few years.
[00:53:58.720 --> 00:53:59.880]   And I think it's a time
[00:53:59.880 --> 00:54:02.000]   where we have to be even more vigilant,
[00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:04.320]   those of us in medicine and public health,
[00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:07.880]   to make sure that what we do is based on data,
[00:54:07.880 --> 00:54:10.520]   that we're transparent about why we're saying
[00:54:10.520 --> 00:54:12.840]   what we're saying, that we're also clear about what we know
[00:54:12.840 --> 00:54:16.940]   and what we don't know so that if recommendations change
[00:54:16.940 --> 00:54:18.780]   over time, people recognize
[00:54:18.780 --> 00:54:20.600]   that this isn't necessarily flip-flopping.
[00:54:20.600 --> 00:54:23.980]   You should change your recommendations if the data changes,
[00:54:23.980 --> 00:54:25.260]   if the circumstances change.
[00:54:25.260 --> 00:54:28.040]   So anyway, this is all part of the work that we've got to do,
[00:54:28.040 --> 00:54:30.780]   but to me, this is a really important part of the work.
[00:54:30.780 --> 00:54:33.120]   The integrity behind our work in public health
[00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:35.300]   is not just about the issue we're taking on today.
[00:54:35.300 --> 00:54:38.140]   It's about the trust that we need to rebuild
[00:54:38.140 --> 00:54:39.500]   in the field more broadly.
[00:54:40.820 --> 00:54:45.100]   - So if I understand correctly, if you were to,
[00:54:45.100 --> 00:54:47.540]   for instance, put out a call that says,
[00:54:47.540 --> 00:54:51.000]   look, there are food additives that are allowed in the US
[00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:53.540]   that are not allowed in Europe that may be a risk.
[00:54:53.540 --> 00:54:55.320]   We don't have enough data at present
[00:54:55.320 --> 00:54:58.820]   to avoid these things, but here's a kind of a yellow zone.
[00:54:58.820 --> 00:55:00.840]   You know, green, known to be safe.
[00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:03.260]   Red, clearly known to be unsafe.
[00:55:03.260 --> 00:55:06.380]   Yellow, we just don't know yet, not enough data.
[00:55:06.380 --> 00:55:09.140]   So here's what my recommendation would be for my children.
[00:55:09.140 --> 00:55:10.940]   - Yeah.
[00:55:10.940 --> 00:55:13.300]   - It's a free country, you know?
[00:55:13.300 --> 00:55:14.700]   There are people that argue it's not,
[00:55:14.700 --> 00:55:15.940]   but at least at the level of which foods
[00:55:15.940 --> 00:55:19.320]   you want to buy with your own budget, it's a free country.
[00:55:19.320 --> 00:55:24.320]   So you're saying that you get messages
[00:55:24.320 --> 00:55:28.660]   that warnings about certain things could lead to pushback,
[00:55:28.660 --> 00:55:31.840]   but I have to imagine that there's something,
[00:55:31.840 --> 00:55:33.280]   and I'm not a conspiracy theorist,
[00:55:33.280 --> 00:55:35.780]   but there has to be, either the people that are saying,
[00:55:35.780 --> 00:55:40.780]   look, there could be problems are just friction averse.
[00:55:40.780 --> 00:55:43.520]   They just don't like anyone to be angry at anyone.
[00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:48.520]   Or there must be some incentive for things to remain quiet.
[00:55:48.520 --> 00:55:53.100]   I mean, certainly the government has not had problems
[00:55:53.100 --> 00:55:55.820]   saying to do things or to not do things
[00:55:55.820 --> 00:55:59.140]   that upset companies or shut down companies
[00:55:59.140 --> 00:56:02.140]   or elevated companies and their success.
[00:56:02.140 --> 00:56:05.740]   So I'd like to know more about the back contour
[00:56:05.740 --> 00:56:06.580]   to this.
[00:56:06.580 --> 00:56:08.420]   - Well, look, I think, and this is not too dissimilar
[00:56:08.420 --> 00:56:10.460]   for I think what happens in other industries,
[00:56:10.460 --> 00:56:13.100]   but it's, you know, whenever you do something
[00:56:13.100 --> 00:56:15.380]   and whether it's in the private sector or in government,
[00:56:15.380 --> 00:56:17.460]   people weigh what are the pros, cons,
[00:56:17.460 --> 00:56:18.540]   what's the pushback I'm gonna get?
[00:56:18.540 --> 00:56:20.860]   How do I deal with that pushback, right?
[00:56:20.860 --> 00:56:22.560]   And pushback isn't always a bad thing, right?
[00:56:22.560 --> 00:56:23.580]   If you get pushback from the public,
[00:56:23.580 --> 00:56:25.380]   people say, hey, that doesn't make sense to me, et cetera.
[00:56:25.380 --> 00:56:28.180]   You should listen to that and use it to inform your approach.
[00:56:28.180 --> 00:56:30.420]   - But that's the public who your job is to serve.
[00:56:30.420 --> 00:56:32.940]   I'm talking about pushback from companies is different.
[00:56:32.940 --> 00:56:34.960]   - Right, so when pushback comes from people
[00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:37.820]   who have a financial interest in the product
[00:56:37.820 --> 00:56:39.640]   that you may be commenting on,
[00:56:39.640 --> 00:56:42.240]   then you've gotta be, you need to know about that,
[00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:45.020]   number one, so that you know how to mitigate it.
[00:56:45.020 --> 00:56:47.080]   And while people may take different approaches to this,
[00:56:47.080 --> 00:56:50.580]   my approach as a public official, as Surgeon General,
[00:56:50.580 --> 00:56:52.460]   has been to say at the end of the day,
[00:56:52.460 --> 00:56:54.900]   like I'm happy to hear from anyone
[00:56:54.900 --> 00:56:56.820]   in terms of their concerns or pushback,
[00:56:56.820 --> 00:56:57.660]   but at the end of the day,
[00:56:57.660 --> 00:57:00.460]   what's gonna guide my decisions about what issues we take on,
[00:57:00.460 --> 00:57:03.140]   what decisions we make and what we say to the public
[00:57:04.060 --> 00:57:06.900]   is gonna be what is driven by science
[00:57:06.900 --> 00:57:07.740]   and the public interest.
[00:57:07.740 --> 00:57:10.200]   And if that means it's politically inconvenient, that's okay.
[00:57:10.200 --> 00:57:13.480]   If that means that something happens to my job,
[00:57:13.480 --> 00:57:14.500]   that's okay too.
[00:57:14.500 --> 00:57:17.000]   The bottom line is life is short.
[00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:18.320]   We don't know how much time we have here.
[00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:19.760]   We may as well make the time we have count
[00:57:19.760 --> 00:57:22.380]   and we may as well do the things that are right
[00:57:22.380 --> 00:57:23.380]   and that are gonna serve people.
[00:57:23.380 --> 00:57:25.640]   That's my simple philosophy my parents taught me
[00:57:25.640 --> 00:57:27.080]   when I was growing up.
[00:57:27.080 --> 00:57:28.920]   So that's the approach I bring to this.
[00:57:28.920 --> 00:57:31.100]   And that's why if we were to do, let's say,
[00:57:31.100 --> 00:57:32.600]   an initiative on diet,
[00:57:32.600 --> 00:57:35.080]   I have no doubt that some of the things that we would say
[00:57:35.080 --> 00:57:37.220]   would be perturbing to folks
[00:57:37.220 --> 00:57:38.780]   who had a financial interest in the industry
[00:57:38.780 --> 00:57:40.700]   'cause I don't think that the current setup in the industry
[00:57:40.700 --> 00:57:42.300]   is serving the public well.
[00:57:42.300 --> 00:57:44.800]   I think we have made unhealthy foods cheap.
[00:57:44.800 --> 00:57:45.680]   That's a problem.
[00:57:45.680 --> 00:57:47.240]   We've made healthy foods expensive.
[00:57:47.240 --> 00:57:48.080]   That's a problem.
[00:57:48.080 --> 00:57:51.760]   We put health from a dietary perspective out of reach
[00:57:51.760 --> 00:57:53.240]   for millions of Americans.
[00:57:53.240 --> 00:57:55.120]   That is a fundamental problem.
[00:57:55.120 --> 00:57:58.000]   And we've also disempowered people
[00:57:58.000 --> 00:57:59.860]   by not giving them the information
[00:57:59.860 --> 00:58:01.480]   that they need to make decisions.
[00:58:01.480 --> 00:58:03.200]   So even if you have resources,
[00:58:03.200 --> 00:58:05.720]   again, Terry, there are people listening to this podcast
[00:58:05.720 --> 00:58:06.800]   and many more people out there
[00:58:06.800 --> 00:58:09.520]   who go to the grocery store and just feel confused.
[00:58:09.520 --> 00:58:11.840]   Like what on earth should I buy?
[00:58:11.840 --> 00:58:12.680]   What's healthy?
[00:58:12.680 --> 00:58:14.400]   What's okay anymore?
[00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:15.640]   It's just hard to know.
[00:58:15.640 --> 00:58:19.100]   And so I think we've done a disservice by not doing more
[00:58:19.100 --> 00:58:23.240]   to help the public understand and access healthy foods.
[00:58:23.240 --> 00:58:25.840]   And again, it's why it's an issue that,
[00:58:25.840 --> 00:58:28.760]   it was on our list of issues that we would wanna work on
[00:58:28.760 --> 00:58:32.400]   because I think that the public health need here is immense.
[00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:34.000]   - I'd like to just take a brief break
[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:36.880]   and thank one of our sponsors, which is Element.
[00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:38.280]   Element is an electrolyte drink
[00:58:38.280 --> 00:58:40.520]   that has everything you need and nothing you don't.
[00:58:40.520 --> 00:58:44.140]   That means plenty of salt, sodium, magnesium, and potassium,
[00:58:44.140 --> 00:58:46.960]   the so-called electrolytes, and no sugar.
[00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:49.800]   Now, salt, magnesium, and potassium are critical
[00:58:49.800 --> 00:58:51.660]   to the function of all the cells in your body,
[00:58:51.660 --> 00:58:54.300]   in particular to the function of your nerve cells,
[00:58:54.300 --> 00:58:55.540]   also called neurons.
[00:58:55.540 --> 00:58:57.900]   Now, people of course have varying levels of requirements
[00:58:57.900 --> 00:59:00.900]   for sodium, so people with hypertension or prehypertension
[00:59:00.900 --> 00:59:02.880]   probably shouldn't increase their sodium.
[00:59:02.880 --> 00:59:04.820]   However, many people are surprised to find
[00:59:04.820 --> 00:59:06.720]   that by increasing their sodium intake,
[00:59:06.720 --> 00:59:09.440]   they're able to function better cognitively and physically.
[00:59:09.440 --> 00:59:10.380]   And that's because a lot of people,
[00:59:10.380 --> 00:59:12.520]   especially people who are following low carbohydrate
[00:59:12.520 --> 00:59:15.260]   or even moderate carbohydrate and really clean diets,
[00:59:15.260 --> 00:59:16.880]   oftentimes they're excreting a lot of water
[00:59:16.880 --> 00:59:18.040]   and electrolytes along with it.
[00:59:18.040 --> 00:59:20.320]   And simply by increasing their electrolyte intake
[00:59:20.320 --> 00:59:23.120]   using Element, they just feel better and function better.
[00:59:23.120 --> 00:59:25.160]   I typically drink Element first thing in the morning
[00:59:25.160 --> 00:59:27.280]   when I wake up in order to hydrate my body
[00:59:27.280 --> 00:59:29.080]   and make sure I have enough electrolytes.
[00:59:29.080 --> 00:59:31.320]   And while I do any kind of physical training,
[00:59:31.320 --> 00:59:34.160]   and certainly I drink Element in my water
[00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:36.640]   when I'm in the sauna and after going in the sauna
[00:59:36.640 --> 00:59:38.320]   because that causes quite a lot of sweating.
[00:59:38.320 --> 00:59:41.300]   If you'd like to try Element, you can go to Drink Element,
[00:59:41.300 --> 00:59:43.880]   that's lmnt.com/huberman,
[00:59:43.880 --> 00:59:46.200]   to claim a free Element sample pack with your purchase.
[00:59:46.200 --> 00:59:50.860]   Again, that's Drink Element, lmnt.com/huberman.
[00:59:50.860 --> 00:59:53.520]   - I have a question about trust in big institutions
[00:59:53.520 --> 00:59:56.380]   and public health initiatives in general.
[00:59:56.380 --> 00:59:57.900]   The question is about masks.
[00:59:57.900 --> 01:00:01.240]   Early in the pandemic, as I recall,
[01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:03.400]   we were told that masks were not necessary.
[01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:06.320]   Then we were told they are necessary.
[01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:09.680]   And I think for a lot of people,
[01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:14.080]   that flip in messaging landed like a parent
[01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:18.800]   telling their teenage kid to always wear a seatbelt,
[01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:20.780]   but then you look into the front seat
[01:00:20.780 --> 01:00:23.120]   and mom and dad aren't wearing seatbelts.
[01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:25.120]   And as anyone who's been around teenagers,
[01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:27.140]   there has been one, you make that mistake once,
[01:00:27.140 --> 01:00:29.660]   you're not making it again.
[01:00:29.660 --> 01:00:33.220]   And you may never recover from that particular example.
[01:00:33.220 --> 01:00:36.500]   In other words, the public felt like
[01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:38.380]   there was a switch of messaging.
[01:00:38.380 --> 01:00:42.420]   But what I don't recall happening was a, like a,
[01:00:42.420 --> 01:00:47.420]   hey, we got that one wrong, so sorry, on us.
[01:00:47.420 --> 01:00:48.540]   You know what?
[01:00:48.540 --> 01:00:50.420]   The new data say blank.
[01:00:50.420 --> 01:00:55.420]   What I recall was a message of don't and then do,
[01:00:55.420 --> 01:00:58.840]   but there wasn't a lot of kind of acknowledgement
[01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:00.900]   of how challenging the situation was.
[01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:04.680]   It was just a lot of top-down mandates.
[01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:08.020]   And in my opinion, and this is just my opinion,
[01:01:08.020 --> 01:01:10.520]   I think that led to a pretty rapid distrust
[01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:12.260]   of subsequent messages
[01:01:12.260 --> 01:01:15.140]   from which we still haven't really recovered.
[01:01:15.140 --> 01:01:18.340]   And so why do you think it's so challenging
[01:01:18.340 --> 01:01:21.620]   for public-facing officials to just say,
[01:01:21.620 --> 01:01:24.920]   look, doing the best we can at the moment,
[01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:28.300]   screwed up before, changing the message now,
[01:01:28.300 --> 01:01:32.480]   may change again, we're navigating this in real time,
[01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:34.780]   it's dynamic, please stay with us.
[01:01:34.780 --> 01:01:37.180]   Because it goes without saying
[01:01:37.180 --> 01:01:40.220]   there's been a huge chasm around this and related issues.
[01:01:40.220 --> 01:01:41.920]   - Yeah, and look, it's an important question.
[01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:45.180]   And look, I'm always, I wanna be thoughtful
[01:01:45.180 --> 01:01:47.960]   about how I comment on what was done
[01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:49.160]   in the first year of the pandemic.
[01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:51.920]   I was a citizen as outside government
[01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:53.860]   and I don't know what was happening inside government
[01:01:53.860 --> 01:01:56.720]   in terms of the decisions that were made there.
[01:01:56.720 --> 01:01:59.260]   But I do know sometimes from my experience in Ebola
[01:01:59.260 --> 01:02:03.340]   and in Zika, during those experiences we had as a country,
[01:02:03.340 --> 01:02:06.540]   that in the fog of war when everything's coming at you,
[01:02:06.540 --> 01:02:09.120]   sometimes it's hard to make the right decision
[01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:09.960]   all the time, right?
[01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:12.300]   So I wanna give some of those folks who were there
[01:02:12.300 --> 01:02:16.760]   in the first year of the pandemic some benefit of the doubt.
[01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:19.740]   But I do think that the important thing,
[01:02:19.740 --> 01:02:21.840]   the principle I certainly try to follow,
[01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:24.580]   but when I think that, and we can all do better,
[01:02:24.580 --> 01:02:26.460]   I can do better, certainly too.
[01:02:26.460 --> 01:02:27.820]   But I think an important principle for us
[01:02:27.820 --> 01:02:32.320]   in public health communication has to be that we're clear,
[01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:35.620]   that we're transparent about what we know
[01:02:35.620 --> 01:02:36.940]   and what we don't know,
[01:02:36.940 --> 01:02:40.540]   and that we explain the why to people.
[01:02:40.540 --> 01:02:42.940]   So if we're telling someone to do something, why?
[01:02:42.940 --> 01:02:45.580]   Is it because there's a lot of data behind it?
[01:02:45.580 --> 01:02:49.480]   Is it because it's a sort of expert agreement, best practice?
[01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:52.120]   'Cause sometimes, as you know, in medicine,
[01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:54.280]   sometimes when we don't have enough data
[01:02:54.280 --> 01:02:56.460]   to guide us on a therapeutic approach,
[01:02:56.460 --> 01:02:59.100]   but when the problem is imminent,
[01:02:59.100 --> 01:03:00.900]   then sometimes experts will get together
[01:03:00.900 --> 01:03:03.240]   and put together expert-informed guidelines
[01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:05.340]   to say, okay, look, based on our best judgment
[01:03:05.340 --> 01:03:06.460]   and the limited data we have,
[01:03:06.460 --> 01:03:08.060]   here's what we would recommend.
[01:03:08.060 --> 01:03:10.180]   And as the data evolves, we will change
[01:03:10.180 --> 01:03:11.880]   and modify those recommendations.
[01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:13.060]   We do that with hypertension, right?
[01:03:13.060 --> 01:03:14.660]   We evolve and update recommendations.
[01:03:14.660 --> 01:03:15.760]   We do that with lipids.
[01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:18.420]   Here too, I think that has to be
[01:03:18.420 --> 01:03:20.140]   like a key part of the approach.
[01:03:20.140 --> 01:03:21.500]   I think one of the challenges
[01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:24.700]   that I saw many public health officials encounter
[01:03:24.700 --> 01:03:26.060]   was even when they went out
[01:03:26.060 --> 01:03:28.460]   with comprehensive messages like that,
[01:03:28.460 --> 01:03:30.380]   which are hard to fit into a soundbite
[01:03:30.380 --> 01:03:32.440]   or into simple posts on social media,
[01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:34.920]   often a lot of that wasn't covered.
[01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:37.020]   What gets covered is the top line.
[01:03:37.020 --> 01:03:38.580]   This is what's really being recommended.
[01:03:38.580 --> 01:03:40.320]   That's what's being required, et cetera.
[01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:42.980]   All the explanation is lost, it's missing, right?
[01:03:42.980 --> 01:03:44.980]   And I think we also are living in a time
[01:03:44.980 --> 01:03:46.420]   where people are reading headlines
[01:03:46.420 --> 01:03:48.300]   like they're living busy lives, right?
[01:03:48.300 --> 01:03:51.200]   They're not necessarily always hearing
[01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:53.340]   all of the nuance that's being explained.
[01:03:53.340 --> 01:03:55.560]   But I think that that's a challenge, right?
[01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:57.860]   It was like, I know many public officials struggled with
[01:03:57.860 --> 01:04:01.160]   how do you deliver nuanced information
[01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:04.180]   at a time when there isn't a clear black and white answer
[01:04:04.180 --> 01:04:05.020]   to things.
[01:04:05.020 --> 01:04:07.180]   But I think the last piece around this is,
[01:04:07.180 --> 01:04:09.980]   I think something I was taught early in medical school
[01:04:09.980 --> 01:04:12.900]   is to approach your patients with humility,
[01:04:12.900 --> 01:04:15.780]   recognizing that even though you have more training
[01:04:15.780 --> 01:04:19.420]   than they do, you aren't living their life,
[01:04:19.420 --> 01:04:21.660]   you don't necessarily know what they're going through,
[01:04:21.660 --> 01:04:25.020]   and you shouldn't assume things about them, right?
[01:04:25.020 --> 01:04:26.580]   And so, approaching with humility means
[01:04:26.580 --> 01:04:29.500]   that you've gotta recognize
[01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:31.540]   that not everyone's gonna be able to follow your guidance,
[01:04:31.540 --> 01:04:32.520]   and if they aren't able to,
[01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:34.100]   that doesn't mean you criticize them.
[01:04:34.100 --> 01:04:36.820]   It also means recognizing that people may have ideas
[01:04:36.820 --> 01:04:39.100]   or suggestions for you that may actually improve
[01:04:39.100 --> 01:04:41.380]   your recommendations or how you communicate.
[01:04:41.380 --> 01:04:43.800]   And so, these are the principles, I think,
[01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:45.780]   that are important in public communication,
[01:04:45.780 --> 01:04:48.460]   but I think that both the challenge
[01:04:48.460 --> 01:04:50.980]   of translating nuanced arguments
[01:04:50.980 --> 01:04:52.760]   into what's actually covered,
[01:04:52.760 --> 01:04:55.140]   that was tough for many public health officials.
[01:04:55.140 --> 01:04:56.900]   I think the other thing, honestly, just on a human level,
[01:04:56.900 --> 01:04:58.520]   that became hard for many of them,
[01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:01.300]   and I am thinking particularly about local and state
[01:05:01.300 --> 01:05:03.080]   public health officials who are on the front lines
[01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:04.820]   that I talk to a lot,
[01:05:04.820 --> 01:05:08.140]   was they ended up getting attacked a lot
[01:05:08.140 --> 01:05:10.180]   and abused a lot during the pandemic.
[01:05:10.180 --> 01:05:12.340]   And I don't just mean like attacked online.
[01:05:12.340 --> 01:05:14.100]   I mean, people showing up at their houses,
[01:05:14.100 --> 01:05:16.300]   people harassing their children,
[01:05:16.300 --> 01:05:17.940]   people threatening their safety.
[01:05:17.940 --> 01:05:21.820]   And this was often people who were upset
[01:05:21.820 --> 01:05:24.180]   about some of the requirements that were being put down
[01:05:24.180 --> 01:05:26.020]   from local departments of health.
[01:05:26.020 --> 01:05:28.960]   And you can understand, look, COVID was as stressful a time
[01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:30.580]   as we've seen recently.
[01:05:30.580 --> 01:05:32.780]   People lost their jobs, people were losing loved ones.
[01:05:32.780 --> 01:05:34.920]   I mean, talk about a stressful time.
[01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:36.620]   But I think at a human level,
[01:05:36.620 --> 01:05:38.820]   public health officials who were exposed
[01:05:38.820 --> 01:05:39.660]   to that kind of abuse
[01:05:39.660 --> 01:05:42.580]   and who started to worry about their children's safety,
[01:05:42.580 --> 01:05:45.200]   many of them stepped out of the arena and said,
[01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:48.840]   "Is this really worth it to put my family at risk?"
[01:05:48.840 --> 01:05:51.420]   And that was hard because we lost
[01:05:51.420 --> 01:05:53.520]   a lot of good public health people in that respect.
[01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:56.200]   So I think in addition to having sort of these core
[01:05:56.200 --> 01:05:59.200]   principles of public health communication in place,
[01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:02.240]   then what we also need to restore is an environment
[01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:05.820]   where we, frankly, of humility and civility,
[01:06:05.820 --> 01:06:09.100]   where we don't attack people who maybe have different views
[01:06:09.100 --> 01:06:10.580]   or are coming out with recommendations
[01:06:10.580 --> 01:06:13.820]   that are not palatable to us.
[01:06:13.820 --> 01:06:17.900]   And I think it's also incumbent upon our leaders in society
[01:06:17.900 --> 01:06:21.780]   to not stoke that kind of resentment and violence as well,
[01:06:21.780 --> 01:06:23.780]   'cause that happened during the pandemic
[01:06:23.780 --> 01:06:26.140]   as COVID got increasingly politicized.
[01:06:26.140 --> 01:06:28.440]   And while that may have been at times done
[01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:31.000]   for political reasons here or there,
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:34.240]   the people who suffered were both the public health leaders
[01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:36.320]   who were trying to do the right thing for their communities
[01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:38.880]   and the public themselves who weren't able
[01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:42.100]   to have a clear, direct channel and a dialogue
[01:06:42.100 --> 01:06:44.520]   with their public health officials
[01:06:44.520 --> 01:06:47.340]   because a lot of that ended up getting closed off.
[01:06:47.340 --> 01:06:49.280]   - Yeah, I feel like there was a lot of talking down
[01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:52.440]   to the dissenters and the general public.
[01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:56.700]   And I totally agree that getting violent
[01:06:56.700 --> 01:06:59.680]   or harassing people with whom you disagree
[01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:01.360]   is totally inappropriate.
[01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:02.400]   - Andrew, the one thing just to say
[01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:04.960]   about the humility piece, and I'll give you an example here
[01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:08.600]   of where I think this could've and should've been done better
[01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:11.580]   is in an effort, for example, around masks
[01:07:11.580 --> 01:07:14.480]   to recommend that people wear masks.
[01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:16.980]   And one important thing just to know is that
[01:07:16.980 --> 01:07:19.720]   when it comes to schools requiring masks,
[01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:21.920]   those are decisions that are made on local levels.
[01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:24.560]   The federal government doesn't mandate masks in schools.
[01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:26.080]   It doesn't have the authority to do that.
[01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:28.700]   So those are local decisions.
[01:07:28.700 --> 01:07:29.680]   But at the end of the day,
[01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:31.420]   there were people who did not want their children
[01:07:31.420 --> 01:07:34.200]   to wear masks for a variety of reasons,
[01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:36.820]   some worried about their social development,
[01:07:36.820 --> 01:07:39.240]   some worried that it was adding stress to their kids.
[01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:40.580]   People had different reasons
[01:07:40.580 --> 01:07:42.100]   why they may or may not have wanted their children
[01:07:42.100 --> 01:07:43.520]   to wear masks.
[01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:45.900]   And one of the things I think that was not helpful
[01:07:45.900 --> 01:07:48.900]   was that when there were parents who made the decision
[01:07:48.900 --> 01:07:51.460]   they didn't want their kids to wear masks,
[01:07:51.460 --> 01:07:55.280]   I think some of them received a lot of criticism
[01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:57.560]   without people necessarily stopping to understand
[01:07:57.560 --> 01:08:00.000]   why they may have been making that decision.
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:03.060]   Because I'll say as a parent whose children were in school,
[01:08:03.060 --> 01:08:04.180]   my kids are five and seven,
[01:08:04.180 --> 01:08:06.380]   and in the first year of the pandemic
[01:08:06.380 --> 01:08:07.820]   they were doing preschool virtually,
[01:08:07.820 --> 01:08:09.060]   which was a nightmare.
[01:08:09.060 --> 01:08:10.660]   It was incredibly hard for us.
[01:08:10.660 --> 01:08:15.100]   Even when they got back to school in the fall of 2021,
[01:08:15.100 --> 01:08:17.380]   it was a really tough adjustment for them.
[01:08:17.380 --> 01:08:20.300]   And I could understand some of the concerns
[01:08:20.300 --> 01:08:22.800]   that parents were having wondering about,
[01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:24.420]   hey, how are these precautions
[01:08:24.420 --> 01:08:27.160]   affecting my child's experience in social development?
[01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:30.700]   So on the whole, this recommendation may still be,
[01:08:30.700 --> 01:08:33.020]   hey, improve ventilation in your classrooms,
[01:08:33.020 --> 01:08:35.940]   recommend masking, recommend testing, et cetera.
[01:08:35.940 --> 01:08:38.860]   But those recommendations I think have to be made
[01:08:38.860 --> 01:08:42.460]   in a way that acknowledges the humanity of people
[01:08:42.460 --> 01:08:44.420]   who may have a different point of view
[01:08:44.420 --> 01:08:47.260]   or may make a different decision for their child.
[01:08:47.260 --> 01:08:50.340]   And I know that when local localities made the decision,
[01:08:50.340 --> 01:08:54.420]   in many cases to require kids in their district
[01:08:54.420 --> 01:08:55.440]   to wear a mask,
[01:08:55.440 --> 01:08:57.620]   that put some parents who didn't want that,
[01:08:57.620 --> 01:08:59.820]   they put them in a hard place, right?
[01:08:59.820 --> 01:09:02.720]   But I think that our failure to actually have
[01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:06.380]   an open, honest, respectful conversation about this,
[01:09:06.380 --> 01:09:09.700]   where we didn't feel like we were each being attacked
[01:09:09.700 --> 01:09:11.300]   as parents for our decisions
[01:09:11.300 --> 01:09:14.260]   or as community members for the decisions we were making,
[01:09:14.260 --> 01:09:17.880]   I think that not only hindered, I think, the response,
[01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:20.540]   but I think it actually contributed to this division,
[01:09:20.540 --> 01:09:21.860]   the sense of black and whiteness,
[01:09:21.860 --> 01:09:24.020]   that, hey, it's us against them.
[01:09:24.020 --> 01:09:26.880]   And then suddenly if I was against one measure,
[01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:28.560]   then I was against all of them.
[01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:30.460]   Or if I was for one measure, I was for all of them
[01:09:30.460 --> 01:09:33.840]   because we just started segregating into sides.
[01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:38.620]   And this became a polarized experience at a time
[01:09:38.620 --> 01:09:40.520]   where really it should have been a crisis
[01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:43.440]   that brought us together, as messy as it was.
[01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:46.360]   And that honestly, Andrew, is what I worry about most
[01:09:46.360 --> 01:09:48.000]   for the next pandemic, right?
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000]   Like I think we've learned a lot from this pandemic
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:53.780]   about how to manufacture vaccines
[01:09:53.780 --> 01:09:56.420]   and how to develop them quickly,
[01:09:56.420 --> 01:09:59.200]   how to distribute them efficiently.
[01:09:59.200 --> 01:10:02.600]   And it was one of the, I think, most historic
[01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:04.900]   and effective vaccine distribution efforts in this country,
[01:10:04.900 --> 01:10:06.340]   even though it certainly could have been better,
[01:10:06.340 --> 01:10:09.200]   but it was historic by all measures.
[01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:12.000]   We've learned a lot about how to do vaccines, therapeutics,
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:16.260]   a lot of the nuts and bolts of a pandemic response well.
[01:10:16.260 --> 01:10:19.540]   But I worry what we are still struggling with
[01:10:19.540 --> 01:10:24.360]   is how we build trust, how we communicate with the public,
[01:10:24.360 --> 01:10:27.000]   and how we stay together as a country
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:28.780]   in the face of adversity.
[01:10:28.780 --> 01:10:32.560]   'Cause if we're divided the way we were during COVID,
[01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:35.980]   during the next pandemic or the next threat
[01:10:35.980 --> 01:10:38.520]   that may come from a foreign adversary,
[01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:41.280]   that's a huge national security issue for us.
[01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:43.300]   And so that's what keeps me up at night
[01:10:43.300 --> 01:10:46.440]   when I think about the next pandemic that may come.
[01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:48.880]   - Two questions relate to what you just said.
[01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:53.700]   First of all, as it relates to vaccines, in my opinion,
[01:10:53.700 --> 01:10:56.480]   and I think the opinion of many people out there,
[01:10:56.480 --> 01:10:59.760]   that the response to the next pandemic
[01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:03.700]   will be heavily contingent
[01:11:03.700 --> 01:11:07.780]   on at least some sort of acknowledgement
[01:11:07.780 --> 01:11:10.040]   that there are people who at least feel
[01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:12.120]   that there have been vaccine injuries, right?
[01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:17.120]   To simply say, okay, the previous round with COVID
[01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:22.640]   went this way and now there's now virus X, right?
[01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:24.200]   Let's hope not, God forbid,
[01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:27.100]   but it sounds like it's coming at some point.
[01:11:27.100 --> 01:11:30.040]   And people are going to think to the last time
[01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:33.540]   and they're going to immediately say,
[01:11:33.540 --> 01:11:37.740]   well, the last time we were told to take a vaccine,
[01:11:37.740 --> 01:11:39.720]   some people had a good experience with that,
[01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:40.940]   other people didn't.
[01:11:40.940 --> 01:11:45.600]   And in this empathy model of acknowledging
[01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:48.480]   and letting your moral compass guide
[01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:51.820]   and understanding the why behind what people are doing
[01:11:51.820 --> 01:11:52.660]   and how they're reacting,
[01:11:52.660 --> 01:11:55.220]   it seems to me that now would be the time
[01:11:55.220 --> 01:11:58.840]   to at least try and understand where they're coming from,
[01:11:58.840 --> 01:12:00.200]   even if one disagrees,
[01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:02.360]   maybe even especially if one disagrees,
[01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:07.360]   and try and get people aligned now before the next pandemic.
[01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:11.560]   And so what efforts are being made, if any,
[01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:15.100]   to try and acknowledge that some people
[01:12:15.100 --> 01:12:17.880]   really do feel as if they were harmed?
[01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:19.940]   I'm not saying they were or not,
[01:12:19.940 --> 01:12:23.480]   but clearly there are people who feel that they,
[01:12:23.480 --> 01:12:25.880]   or people they know were harmed.
[01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:29.440]   Is there an effort to present them with data,
[01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:31.040]   to have discussions with them,
[01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:34.400]   to try and get people aligned so that the next time around
[01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:35.920]   we can be more of a unified front,
[01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:38.840]   whatever the necessary response happens to be?
[01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:40.280]   - Yeah, no, it's a really important question.
[01:12:40.280 --> 01:12:43.380]   And to me, I always go back to sort of first principles
[01:12:43.380 --> 01:12:44.880]   from practicing medicine, right?
[01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:48.080]   Which is, if there is a medicine you give a patient,
[01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:50.980]   and even if it helps 99.99% of patients,
[01:12:50.980 --> 01:12:54.500]   but this one particular patient happened to be harmed by it,
[01:12:54.500 --> 01:12:56.680]   you go in, you acknowledge it, you talk about it,
[01:12:56.680 --> 01:12:59.660]   and you together trot out a path
[01:12:59.660 --> 01:13:01.000]   for how you wanna move forward.
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:02.560]   And the path forward might be,
[01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:04.000]   yes, let's get rid of that medication,
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000]   but let's use an alternative, let's try it.
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.040]   Or we can't use that medication anymore,
[01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:09.660]   here are the risks you may sustain,
[01:13:09.660 --> 01:13:11.240]   but we'll find other ways to protect you, right?
[01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:13.000]   So that's what we would do in medicine, right?
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:14.960]   That's what I've done with patients over the years.
[01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:16.180]   I think here too, similarly,
[01:13:16.180 --> 01:13:21.180]   when it comes to tracking adverse events from vaccines,
[01:13:21.180 --> 01:13:24.140]   this is an area where the CDC and the FDA
[01:13:24.140 --> 01:13:26.000]   track and collaborate.
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:29.720]   And tracking means not only collecting reports
[01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:31.680]   from the public and from clinicians
[01:13:31.680 --> 01:13:35.280]   when they see an effect that may be related to a vaccine,
[01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:36.840]   but it also involves analyzing those
[01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:38.600]   to see were they correlated
[01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:40.240]   or were there's actual causation there, right?
[01:13:40.240 --> 01:13:45.240]   Because if today, for example, I felt unwell,
[01:13:45.240 --> 01:13:48.560]   and I trace back what happened yesterday,
[01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:51.240]   and it turns out, hey, I ate this burrito
[01:13:51.240 --> 01:13:53.960]   that was out in the sun for way too long.
[01:13:53.960 --> 01:13:56.300]   The question is, am I feeling sick because of the burrito
[01:13:56.300 --> 01:14:00.320]   or did the burrito just happen to be something that happened
[01:14:00.320 --> 01:14:02.800]   but it's independent of how I'm feeling?
[01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:05.240]   Maybe it turns out somebody was actually sick
[01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:07.240]   with a GI bug around me,
[01:14:07.240 --> 01:14:09.480]   and that's the reason that I'm feeling the way I am today.
[01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:12.140]   So the analysis that needs to be done
[01:14:12.140 --> 01:14:14.580]   on cases that are reported is important,
[01:14:14.580 --> 01:14:17.320]   and it's something that the CDC and the FDA do together.
[01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:18.760]   Now, that analysis, I think,
[01:14:18.760 --> 01:14:22.600]   is essential to communicate clearly to the public.
[01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:26.160]   And whenever I engage with folks in the public,
[01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:27.000]   which we do often,
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:27.940]   and people will talk to me
[01:14:27.940 --> 01:14:30.000]   about their experiences with vaccines,
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:31.320]   I do think it's important to acknowledge
[01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:33.000]   what people have gone through.
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:34.120]   Like some people, for example,
[01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:36.620]   like when I got vaccinated for COVID, for example,
[01:14:36.620 --> 01:14:39.220]   I felt like I had mild flu-like symptoms
[01:14:39.220 --> 01:14:40.380]   for a couple of days, you know?
[01:14:40.380 --> 01:14:41.220]   It wasn't great.
[01:14:41.220 --> 01:14:42.880]   I would have preferred I didn't have those feelings,
[01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:45.540]   and then I felt better a couple of days later,
[01:14:45.540 --> 01:14:46.380]   and then I moved on.
[01:14:46.380 --> 01:14:49.740]   But I acknowledge it didn't feel good to feel that way.
[01:14:49.740 --> 01:14:52.700]   There are other people who may have had experiences
[01:14:52.700 --> 01:14:55.620]   where they felt that they had more serious side effects,
[01:14:55.620 --> 01:14:56.460]   and there may be a question,
[01:14:56.460 --> 01:14:58.240]   was that related to the vaccine or not?
[01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:00.580]   So I think we have to both hear and acknowledge those.
[01:15:00.580 --> 01:15:01.700]   I certainly try to do that.
[01:15:01.700 --> 01:15:04.060]   I know, I think, it's important to keep doing that
[01:15:04.060 --> 01:15:05.740]   across all of government.
[01:15:05.740 --> 01:15:07.740]   But I also think it's important for us
[01:15:07.740 --> 01:15:10.340]   to help people understand the process
[01:15:10.340 --> 01:15:11.180]   that we have to go through
[01:15:11.180 --> 01:15:12.880]   to understand whether those are related or not.
[01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:16.500]   If you go online, and the CDC's site
[01:15:16.500 --> 01:15:18.240]   where they collect a lot of this information,
[01:15:18.240 --> 01:15:21.300]   and you just purely look at reports that are given
[01:15:21.300 --> 01:15:24.040]   of potential adverse effects,
[01:15:24.040 --> 01:15:25.860]   you can't sort of take that and say,
[01:15:25.860 --> 01:15:28.460]   "Ah, those are all related to the vaccine.
[01:15:28.460 --> 01:15:29.560]   "Look at this rate of harm.
[01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:31.100]   "It's extraordinarily high."
[01:15:31.100 --> 01:15:32.080]   Because we don't actually do that
[01:15:32.080 --> 01:15:34.300]   with any other vaccine or medicine, right?
[01:15:34.300 --> 01:15:36.620]   We start there, we do the analysis,
[01:15:36.620 --> 01:15:38.980]   and we try to understand what's actually related or not.
[01:15:38.980 --> 01:15:41.640]   So I think that's what we've got to do here, too.
[01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:43.500]   One last thing I'll say is that it's important,
[01:15:43.500 --> 01:15:47.300]   I think, also for us to help put this in context
[01:15:47.300 --> 01:15:49.500]   of other vaccines and medicines
[01:15:49.500 --> 01:15:51.460]   and interventions that we use.
[01:15:51.460 --> 01:15:54.580]   So for example, just take Tylenol, for example.
[01:15:54.580 --> 01:15:57.860]   Most people think, "Oh, well, Tylenol, it's safe.
[01:15:57.860 --> 01:16:00.420]   "Nothing bad happens if you take Tylenol," et cetera.
[01:16:00.420 --> 01:16:05.380]   But people who track the data know that Tylenol, by and large,
[01:16:05.380 --> 01:16:07.220]   generally speaking, is safe medication,
[01:16:07.220 --> 01:16:09.620]   but there are people who experience adverse effects
[01:16:09.620 --> 01:16:14.260]   from Tylenol, liver damage, and other adverse effects.
[01:16:14.260 --> 01:16:16.600]   And that data is available.
[01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:19.440]   But what has happened in the case of that medication
[01:16:19.440 --> 01:16:22.180]   is that the risks and benefits are both analyzed,
[01:16:22.180 --> 01:16:23.980]   and then a recommendation is put forward
[01:16:23.980 --> 01:16:26.500]   about a generally safe way to use it.
[01:16:26.500 --> 01:16:27.720]   And then there's data put out
[01:16:27.720 --> 01:16:31.540]   about the side effects, common or rare, right?
[01:16:31.540 --> 01:16:33.460]   But I think sometimes we also forget
[01:16:33.460 --> 01:16:35.520]   that a lot of the medicines that we have come to take
[01:16:35.520 --> 01:16:38.140]   and just see as a normal part of our life,
[01:16:38.140 --> 01:16:39.660]   just like any other vaccine,
[01:16:39.660 --> 01:16:43.460]   like there's some rate of rare side effects that will happen.
[01:16:43.460 --> 01:16:45.980]   I say that because what I worry about
[01:16:45.980 --> 01:16:48.520]   in the black and white environment that we're living in
[01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:51.480]   is sometimes people will take an anecdote
[01:16:51.480 --> 01:16:54.420]   about a potential adverse effect
[01:16:54.420 --> 01:16:57.100]   and will portray that as the rule, right?
[01:16:57.100 --> 01:16:58.920]   And we'll say, "Well, look, I know somebody
[01:16:58.920 --> 01:17:02.080]   "who had this side effect, so nobody should take this
[01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:03.860]   "'cause this is what's gonna happen to you.
[01:17:03.860 --> 01:17:06.420]   "If we did that, nobody would ever take Tylenol.
[01:17:06.420 --> 01:17:08.040]   "No one would ever take ibuprofen.
[01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:09.280]   "No one would take NyQuil.
[01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:11.440]   "No one would take any of the common medications
[01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:14.280]   "that we pick up at the drugstore and that we commonly use."
[01:17:14.280 --> 01:17:16.960]   So that's how I think we have to approach this
[01:17:16.960 --> 01:17:20.480]   with a combination of clear communication,
[01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:23.680]   empathic listening, and data and context.
[01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:26.160]   Again, that doesn't fit neatly
[01:17:26.160 --> 01:17:28.940]   in a social media post per se,
[01:17:28.940 --> 01:17:32.000]   but I think part of what we need to do as a country
[01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.440]   is rebuild the relationship, honestly,
[01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:37.720]   between the medical and public health establishment
[01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:38.560]   and the public.
[01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:41.520]   And I think it starts with this kind of communication.
[01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:44.280]   - The other question I had about the next pandemic
[01:17:44.280 --> 01:17:49.240]   and the one we just had is why not have committees
[01:17:49.240 --> 01:17:52.340]   of people of diverse backgrounds, socioeconomic diversity,
[01:17:52.340 --> 01:17:55.200]   racial diversity, every aspect of diversity,
[01:17:55.200 --> 01:17:57.800]   rather than individuals standing there telling us
[01:17:57.800 --> 01:17:59.600]   what to do for several reasons.
[01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:03.480]   One is we are a country of many different people.
[01:18:03.480 --> 01:18:07.000]   I think there are dozens, if not hundreds,
[01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.360]   of scientific papers showing that patients
[01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:12.060]   follow the advice of doctors that look like them
[01:18:12.060 --> 01:18:17.060]   and sound like them or to whom they would aspire to be like.
[01:18:17.060 --> 01:18:19.260]   We know this.
[01:18:19.260 --> 01:18:23.800]   And yet, public health officials typically are unitary.
[01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:26.140]   One person telling us, "Do this, don't do that.
[01:18:26.140 --> 01:18:28.120]   "This is a good idea, that's a bad idea.
[01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:30.780]   "I'm but one citizen, but I'm putting up both hands,
[01:18:30.780 --> 01:18:33.560]   "both feet, and all toes," and saying committees.
[01:18:33.560 --> 01:18:38.560]   Small, but diverse committees that people can relate to
[01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:43.680]   and feel as if the messages that they're getting
[01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:46.480]   are vetted through a common understanding.
[01:18:46.480 --> 01:18:48.040]   - Yeah, so it's a really good suggestion.
[01:18:48.040 --> 01:18:49.440]   And I couldn't agree with you more
[01:18:49.440 --> 01:18:52.200]   that a diversity of voices is really important
[01:18:52.200 --> 01:18:53.740]   to get a message out.
[01:18:53.740 --> 01:18:56.080]   And during COVID, actually, that's one of the things
[01:18:56.080 --> 01:18:58.880]   that our office actually was helping to build
[01:18:58.880 --> 01:19:00.940]   was something called the community core,
[01:19:00.940 --> 01:19:03.680]   where we actually, we recognize very clearly,
[01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:06.560]   and this is something I came to see as a doctor,
[01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:08.520]   sometimes I was the right person to message to patients,
[01:19:08.520 --> 01:19:09.840]   sometimes I wasn't.
[01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:11.320]   Sometimes it was the nurse,
[01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:13.640]   sometimes it was the medical student,
[01:19:13.640 --> 01:19:16.760]   sometimes it was an administrator or the social worker
[01:19:16.760 --> 01:19:19.200]   with different background, different life experiences.
[01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:21.960]   So part of this work is knowing when to step up
[01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:23.400]   and when to step back.
[01:19:23.400 --> 01:19:25.200]   But the community core that we were building
[01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:28.960]   was a really diverse group of people.
[01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:30.720]   And a lot of them had public health backgrounds,
[01:19:30.720 --> 01:19:32.280]   but a lot of them were community leaders
[01:19:32.280 --> 01:19:33.120]   who understood health,
[01:19:33.120 --> 01:19:35.320]   even though they didn't have formal training.
[01:19:35.320 --> 01:19:37.220]   But they're people who knew their communities, right?
[01:19:37.220 --> 01:19:38.920]   And they had the trust of their communities,
[01:19:38.920 --> 01:19:40.260]   and they understood what was going on,
[01:19:40.260 --> 01:19:41.100]   they wanted to be helpful.
[01:19:41.100 --> 01:19:42.200]   So we brought them together to say,
[01:19:42.200 --> 01:19:46.000]   "Okay, look, here's what the science is telling us.
[01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.160]   "Here are the general recommendations.
[01:19:48.160 --> 01:19:49.960]   "Here's what we would provide.
[01:19:49.960 --> 01:19:51.920]   "You ask us any questions you have.
[01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:53.000]   "Like, if there's something we don't know,
[01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:54.860]   "we'll go back and look it up.
[01:19:54.860 --> 01:19:56.460]   "But you're the leaders in your community.
[01:19:56.460 --> 01:19:59.680]   "They should be hearing from you about these messages."
[01:19:59.680 --> 01:20:02.200]   And then those folks went out and actually,
[01:20:02.200 --> 01:20:04.460]   we worked closely with them, collaborated with them.
[01:20:04.460 --> 01:20:06.920]   They would design the messages for their community
[01:20:06.920 --> 01:20:08.220]   based on what they thought made sense.
[01:20:08.220 --> 01:20:09.720]   They weren't taking what we said word for word,
[01:20:09.720 --> 01:20:11.440]   and we didn't want them to.
[01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:13.420]   But to me, that kind of diverse approach
[01:20:13.420 --> 01:20:14.260]   is what we need more of.
[01:20:14.260 --> 01:20:16.740]   Now, I'll tell you what I would have liked.
[01:20:16.740 --> 01:20:19.440]   I would have liked if more media networks
[01:20:19.440 --> 01:20:23.040]   put those folks on TV and got them on the radio, right?
[01:20:23.040 --> 01:20:25.160]   Because it's important that many of them
[01:20:25.160 --> 01:20:26.520]   were showing up in their communities,
[01:20:26.520 --> 01:20:30.700]   were knocking on doors, were doing local podcasts, et cetera,
[01:20:30.700 --> 01:20:31.860]   and that was great.
[01:20:31.860 --> 01:20:33.400]   But I would have liked more of their faces
[01:20:33.400 --> 01:20:34.800]   I carried on TV, right?
[01:20:34.800 --> 01:20:38.060]   So that's a place where when we talk to media
[01:20:38.060 --> 01:20:39.720]   and when I talk to folks in media,
[01:20:39.720 --> 01:20:42.020]   one of the things I encourage them and push them to do also
[01:20:42.020 --> 01:20:44.480]   is to say, "Look, if you can take more of these
[01:20:44.480 --> 01:20:47.480]   "diverse faces and voices and put them out there,
[01:20:47.480 --> 01:20:49.320]   "that's actually good for the community."
[01:20:49.320 --> 01:20:51.480]   And it also helps people see that it's not like
[01:20:51.480 --> 01:20:53.840]   one or two people who are sort of pushing an agenda here.
[01:20:53.840 --> 01:20:56.440]   This is like, the public health community is big.
[01:20:56.440 --> 01:20:58.820]   It's broad, it's diverse, it has a lot of voices,
[01:20:58.820 --> 01:21:02.280]   and the more voices we can hear from as public,
[01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:03.920]   I think the better off we are.
[01:21:03.920 --> 01:21:04.920]   - Yeah, here, here.
[01:21:04.920 --> 01:21:10.080]   Again, I genuinely hope and pray
[01:21:10.080 --> 01:21:11.640]   that we don't have another pandemic,
[01:21:11.640 --> 01:21:14.460]   but if and when we do, I hope there will be committees
[01:21:14.460 --> 01:21:15.600]   rather than individuals.
[01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:18.720]   I know this is a thing in this country,
[01:21:18.720 --> 01:21:21.340]   we like the idea that one person's gonna save the climate,
[01:21:21.340 --> 01:21:23.020]   one person's gonna save transportation,
[01:21:23.020 --> 01:21:24.200]   one person, you know, the covers,
[01:21:24.200 --> 01:21:26.400]   the person of the year type approach.
[01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:27.240]   - I know, yeah.
[01:21:27.240 --> 01:21:29.960]   - But then we get frustrated when that person
[01:21:29.960 --> 01:21:32.100]   does things or makes decisions that we don't like
[01:21:32.100 --> 01:21:34.380]   in their public or personal life,
[01:21:34.380 --> 01:21:36.580]   and then it all seems to fall into division.
[01:21:36.580 --> 01:21:38.660]   And I just feel like, I'm not talking about groups
[01:21:38.660 --> 01:21:40.580]   of hundreds of people, but small groups.
[01:21:40.580 --> 01:21:42.080]   So I think we're aligned in that way.
[01:21:42.080 --> 01:21:44.580]   - Yeah, and look, there's, I think, a notion that,
[01:21:44.580 --> 01:21:48.140]   I think sometimes we do want the one person
[01:21:48.140 --> 01:21:50.780]   who can not only necessarily have all our trust
[01:21:50.780 --> 01:21:52.820]   and we can look to, but also who we can hold accountable.
[01:21:52.820 --> 01:21:54.740]   You know, if something doesn't quite work out
[01:21:54.740 --> 01:21:56.060]   or we don't like something.
[01:21:56.060 --> 01:21:58.340]   And while I get that sort of mentality,
[01:21:58.340 --> 01:22:00.780]   I think that in this moment,
[01:22:00.780 --> 01:22:02.460]   especially when we're trying to rebuild trust,
[01:22:02.460 --> 01:22:05.020]   I think it's important for people to know
[01:22:05.020 --> 01:22:07.580]   that what they may be hearing in terms of medical
[01:22:07.580 --> 01:22:09.740]   or public health recommendations,
[01:22:09.740 --> 01:22:12.060]   it's important for them to know how broad an audience
[01:22:12.060 --> 01:22:14.940]   that's coming from or a broader group of experts, right?
[01:22:14.940 --> 01:22:17.660]   And there was a lot more broad agreement.
[01:22:17.660 --> 01:22:22.500]   For example, during COVID and during Ebola, during Zika,
[01:22:22.500 --> 01:22:24.020]   on public health recommendations.
[01:22:24.020 --> 01:22:26.280]   But you wouldn't always know it if you turn on the TV,
[01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:28.900]   'cause you were seeing the same couple of faces.
[01:22:28.900 --> 01:22:33.520]   So I think we have to just certainly diversify that.
[01:22:33.520 --> 01:22:35.540]   One other thing I think I'll tell you that's important here
[01:22:35.540 --> 01:22:39.800]   is I think we have to also think about how we fund groups
[01:22:39.800 --> 01:22:42.380]   on the ground that are doing the hard work
[01:22:42.380 --> 01:22:44.320]   of getting public health messages out.
[01:22:44.320 --> 01:22:45.160]   Because one of the things
[01:22:45.160 --> 01:22:46.360]   that those groups often would tell me,
[01:22:46.360 --> 01:22:47.680]   and these are, I might say these groups,
[01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:50.060]   I'm talking about the community organization
[01:22:50.060 --> 01:22:53.440]   that spent years in a neighborhood getting to know families
[01:22:53.440 --> 01:22:54.860]   where folks who recognize them
[01:22:54.860 --> 01:22:56.000]   when they're walking down the street,
[01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:56.920]   they're like, "Oh yeah, that's the person
[01:22:56.920 --> 01:22:58.180]   "from organization X.
[01:22:58.180 --> 01:22:59.360]   "They understand us, they get us.
[01:22:59.360 --> 01:23:01.040]   "They're looking out for us."
[01:23:01.040 --> 01:23:04.640]   A lot of those organizations had spent their resources
[01:23:04.640 --> 01:23:06.320]   helping the community, getting to know the community,
[01:23:06.320 --> 01:23:08.720]   but they didn't have sophisticated mechanisms
[01:23:08.720 --> 01:23:10.520]   to apply for grants, for example.
[01:23:10.520 --> 01:23:11.600]   They didn't have grant writers
[01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:13.320]   who had done this a thousand times.
[01:23:13.320 --> 01:23:16.520]   So historically, those groups
[01:23:16.520 --> 01:23:18.840]   have a hard time getting support and funding.
[01:23:18.840 --> 01:23:20.920]   So I'll tell you one interesting thing my wife did,
[01:23:20.920 --> 01:23:23.200]   which I certainly was very proud of,
[01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:26.240]   is she was helping to build an effort
[01:23:26.240 --> 01:23:28.180]   and to build a nonprofit organization
[01:23:28.180 --> 01:23:29.760]   with a couple of colleagues,
[01:23:29.760 --> 01:23:33.680]   that a big organization of people who knew how to get money,
[01:23:33.680 --> 01:23:36.480]   how to apply for grants, how to get foundation support,
[01:23:36.480 --> 01:23:38.700]   but who also had the wisdom to know
[01:23:38.700 --> 01:23:40.480]   that the most important they could do
[01:23:40.480 --> 01:23:43.200]   was to give portions of that money
[01:23:43.200 --> 01:23:44.560]   to groups on the ground.
[01:23:44.560 --> 01:23:46.980]   So they saw themselves as an organization
[01:23:46.980 --> 01:23:49.680]   that channeled money to groups that had trust,
[01:23:49.680 --> 01:23:52.820]   and they executed their mission that way.
[01:23:52.820 --> 01:23:54.380]   And that was very effective,
[01:23:54.380 --> 01:23:55.800]   and I think we need more of that
[01:23:55.800 --> 01:23:57.720]   when it comes to disseminating funding.
[01:23:57.720 --> 01:24:00.760]   One thing I think many people may or may not appreciate
[01:24:00.760 --> 01:24:03.240]   is that it's actually hard from government
[01:24:03.240 --> 01:24:05.760]   to put out a lot of money at once
[01:24:05.760 --> 01:24:07.680]   and to do so quickly, right?
[01:24:07.680 --> 01:24:09.120]   Like when you've got a lot of funds
[01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:10.400]   that you need to get into communities,
[01:24:10.400 --> 01:24:11.600]   what happens is the federal government
[01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:13.320]   often will give it to states.
[01:24:13.320 --> 01:24:16.160]   States will then give it to local communities,
[01:24:16.160 --> 01:24:19.040]   to like the local department of public health potentially,
[01:24:19.040 --> 01:24:21.320]   and then they will look to distribute it to others.
[01:24:21.320 --> 01:24:22.960]   That takes time, but it also means
[01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:25.140]   if you're not connected to that network,
[01:24:25.140 --> 01:24:26.920]   if you don't know your local department of health
[01:24:26.920 --> 01:24:28.580]   or you're not connected to the state department of health,
[01:24:28.580 --> 01:24:29.960]   sometimes it can be challenging
[01:24:29.960 --> 01:24:31.320]   to figure out how to get the money.
[01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:34.000]   And so I think we need more operations
[01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:37.720]   like what my wife and others have been building
[01:24:37.720 --> 01:24:39.780]   to try to get those funds directly
[01:24:39.780 --> 01:24:42.060]   to the folks who don't necessarily have
[01:24:42.060 --> 01:24:44.260]   the most fancy grant writing operation,
[01:24:44.260 --> 01:24:45.720]   but they have their relationships.
[01:24:45.720 --> 01:24:47.360]   'Cause at the end of the day,
[01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:50.060]   it's those relationships that create the trust.
[01:24:50.060 --> 01:24:53.060]   It's a trust that allows life-saving information
[01:24:53.060 --> 01:24:56.000]   to get to people, and that's the link that's missing.
[01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:57.000]   - Very interesting.
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:01.060]   Pharma, big pharma.
[01:25:01.060 --> 01:25:05.120]   I got a lot of questions about whether or not big pharma
[01:25:05.120 --> 01:25:08.000]   is on the take for every public health initiative.
[01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:12.220]   Now, as somebody who understands a bit about
[01:25:12.220 --> 01:25:14.060]   and certainly believes in the use
[01:25:14.060 --> 01:25:15.600]   of certain prescription medications,
[01:25:15.600 --> 01:25:20.540]   I find most questions about quote unquote big pharma
[01:25:20.540 --> 01:25:24.540]   to overlook the fact that there are thousands,
[01:25:24.540 --> 01:25:26.340]   if not hundreds of thousands of medications
[01:25:26.340 --> 01:25:29.080]   that save lives and enrich people's lives
[01:25:29.080 --> 01:25:30.940]   that are prescription drugs.
[01:25:30.940 --> 01:25:33.420]   I also believe, my audience knows,
[01:25:33.420 --> 01:25:34.260]   I say it over and over again,
[01:25:34.260 --> 01:25:35.420]   that better living through chemistry
[01:25:35.420 --> 01:25:36.600]   still requires better living.
[01:25:36.600 --> 01:25:37.920]   We still have to get our sunlight,
[01:25:37.920 --> 01:25:39.580]   get our sleep, social connection,
[01:25:39.580 --> 01:25:41.480]   good nutrition, exercise, and all those things.
[01:25:41.480 --> 01:25:43.980]   There's just no pill that's going to replace those.
[01:25:43.980 --> 01:25:45.300]   - Yeah. - Okay.
[01:25:45.300 --> 01:25:48.500]   But I think it's a valid question that people are asking.
[01:25:48.500 --> 01:25:54.940]   Is there a direct relationship between big pharma
[01:25:54.940 --> 01:25:57.080]   and public health initiatives
[01:25:57.080 --> 01:25:59.300]   in a way that should have us concerned
[01:25:59.300 --> 01:26:02.900]   about the messaging that we're getting at times
[01:26:02.900 --> 01:26:07.100]   and the fact that the United States consumes
[01:26:07.100 --> 01:26:09.960]   the vast majority of drugs for mental health, for instance,
[01:26:09.960 --> 01:26:11.520]   as compared to other countries?
[01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:12.780]   So that's one question.
[01:26:12.780 --> 01:26:16.500]   And then I want to dovetail into that question.
[01:26:16.500 --> 01:26:18.780]   What are your thoughts on the fact that there's a history
[01:26:18.780 --> 01:26:23.580]   of the tobacco industry being very interdigitated,
[01:26:23.580 --> 01:26:26.080]   shall we say, with government policies
[01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:28.760]   in ways that had us basically injure,
[01:26:28.760 --> 01:26:31.160]   if not kill millions of Americans,
[01:26:31.160 --> 01:26:34.740]   and then eventually say you can't smoke near a hospital.
[01:26:34.740 --> 01:26:36.000]   You can't smoke anywhere.
[01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:37.380]   There's very few places
[01:26:37.380 --> 01:26:39.940]   where you can consume tobacco products.
[01:26:39.940 --> 01:26:44.460]   That kind of relationship and financial incentives
[01:26:44.460 --> 01:26:47.600]   and then a lot of backpedaling later,
[01:26:47.600 --> 01:26:51.300]   I think, war on people's trust.
[01:26:51.300 --> 01:26:54.040]   So how should we frame the relationship
[01:26:54.040 --> 01:26:57.620]   between the pharmaceutical industry, government,
[01:26:57.620 --> 01:26:58.780]   and public health initiatives
[01:26:58.780 --> 01:27:02.940]   in a way that is at least halfway functional?
[01:27:02.940 --> 01:27:05.220]   - Look, I understand where the concern
[01:27:05.220 --> 01:27:06.980]   and the suspicion comes from, right?
[01:27:06.980 --> 01:27:10.500]   And look, I think it's important
[01:27:10.500 --> 01:27:14.300]   that public health initiatives and medical advice
[01:27:14.300 --> 01:27:17.340]   is independent of the influence of industries
[01:27:17.340 --> 01:27:20.700]   that may seek to profit from what's being recommended
[01:27:20.700 --> 01:27:22.900]   or from medications that are being prescribed.
[01:27:22.900 --> 01:27:26.160]   And we have a history in medicine, right,
[01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:31.160]   of doctors who were given gifts and vacations
[01:27:31.160 --> 01:27:34.140]   and all kinds of fancy things by pharma companies
[01:27:34.140 --> 01:27:36.140]   in an effort to influence what they prescribe.
[01:27:36.140 --> 01:27:37.620]   That was really problematic.
[01:27:37.620 --> 01:27:39.860]   And now we're seeing a lot less of that, which is good.
[01:27:39.860 --> 01:27:41.220]   A lot of rules are being put in place
[01:27:41.220 --> 01:27:43.900]   by medical societies and professional societies
[01:27:43.900 --> 01:27:45.460]   and by academic institutions to say
[01:27:45.460 --> 01:27:48.100]   this is an unacceptable way to practice.
[01:27:48.100 --> 01:27:49.700]   And that's really important.
[01:27:49.700 --> 01:27:51.260]   'Cause I do think that human psychology
[01:27:51.260 --> 01:27:53.540]   is that sometimes we underestimate
[01:27:53.540 --> 01:27:55.560]   how much we're influenced by incentives.
[01:27:55.560 --> 01:27:57.100]   We think, eh, yeah, I'm getting that,
[01:27:57.100 --> 01:27:59.380]   but I know how to make independent decisions.
[01:27:59.380 --> 01:28:01.540]   But at the end of the day, we're human and we're influenced.
[01:28:01.540 --> 01:28:02.740]   - Or it's a great drug.
[01:28:02.740 --> 01:28:03.980]   It could be, wow, this is a drug
[01:28:03.980 --> 01:28:05.380]   that's really helping my patients.
[01:28:05.380 --> 01:28:07.420]   I'm happy to recommend it to them.
[01:28:07.420 --> 01:28:11.060]   - Yeah, so I wanna separate one thing though.
[01:28:11.060 --> 01:28:14.740]   Taking money from a pharma company as a physician
[01:28:14.740 --> 01:28:16.680]   I think is highly problematic, right?
[01:28:16.680 --> 01:28:20.220]   I think it's hard to say that it doesn't influence practice.
[01:28:20.220 --> 01:28:21.440]   Maybe it doesn't for some people,
[01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:23.940]   but it's really hard to know who those people are.
[01:28:23.940 --> 01:28:26.980]   I do think that separate from that,
[01:28:26.980 --> 01:28:30.280]   you can be a physician who prescribes medications
[01:28:30.280 --> 01:28:31.220]   'cause you believe they work.
[01:28:31.220 --> 01:28:35.540]   Look, as a doctor, I have prescribed many antibiotics
[01:28:35.540 --> 01:28:38.820]   during cases of infection that have helped my patients.
[01:28:38.820 --> 01:28:40.040]   And I would prescribe those again.
[01:28:40.040 --> 01:28:42.860]   I am glad that those exist.
[01:28:42.860 --> 01:28:44.940]   In many cases, they've saved the lives
[01:28:44.940 --> 01:28:46.820]   of patients I was caring for in the hospital.
[01:28:46.820 --> 01:28:48.940]   So that's what should drive us,
[01:28:48.940 --> 01:28:51.580]   is does the data show that they work
[01:28:51.580 --> 01:28:54.300]   and does our patient need them, right?
[01:28:54.300 --> 01:28:55.600]   That's what should drive our decisions.
[01:28:55.600 --> 01:28:57.980]   When it comes to public health recommendations,
[01:28:57.980 --> 01:28:59.840]   here too I think a similar principle holds,
[01:28:59.840 --> 01:29:03.620]   which is that I don't think that pharma money
[01:29:03.620 --> 01:29:06.760]   should be influencing our public health decisions,
[01:29:06.760 --> 01:29:08.760]   which means that it shouldn't be funding
[01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:10.240]   our public health organizations
[01:29:10.240 --> 01:29:12.020]   that are making recommendations.
[01:29:12.020 --> 01:29:14.040]   Certainly, I know this is obvious to you,
[01:29:14.040 --> 01:29:17.220]   but I'll say just to be clear for everyone who's listening,
[01:29:17.220 --> 01:29:20.700]   our office doesn't take any money from industry,
[01:29:20.700 --> 01:29:23.220]   not just pharma industry, from any industry.
[01:29:23.220 --> 01:29:26.040]   The money that we get is allocated by Congress
[01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:26.880]   at the end of the day.
[01:29:26.880 --> 01:29:29.840]   It's taxpayer money, and that's all we get.
[01:29:29.840 --> 01:29:31.580]   And that's important.
[01:29:31.580 --> 01:29:35.220]   We don't want money from pharmaceutical companies.
[01:29:35.220 --> 01:29:38.520]   But that's important because people need to know
[01:29:38.520 --> 01:29:42.320]   that these decisions are not being made for financial gain.
[01:29:42.320 --> 01:29:45.520]   With that being said, there's a broader concern
[01:29:45.520 --> 01:29:50.180]   I have, Andrew, which is I think that we have become
[01:29:50.180 --> 01:29:53.220]   a pill for every problem society,
[01:29:53.220 --> 01:29:56.020]   where we look for a quick fix of a medicine
[01:29:56.020 --> 01:29:59.280]   for every challenge that we may incur.
[01:29:59.280 --> 01:30:03.120]   And sometimes, yes, I'm a believer that if science
[01:30:03.120 --> 01:30:06.160]   helps us create medications that can help solve disease,
[01:30:06.160 --> 01:30:07.460]   we should use them appropriately.
[01:30:07.460 --> 01:30:12.460]   But I think we discount heavily the behavioral changes
[01:30:12.460 --> 01:30:14.640]   that we need to make, the more broader societal
[01:30:14.640 --> 01:30:17.460]   and environmental changes that we need to make
[01:30:17.460 --> 01:30:18.720]   that influence our health.
[01:30:18.720 --> 01:30:21.040]   Like our food environment matters for our health.
[01:30:21.040 --> 01:30:23.920]   Our decisions about how physically active we are
[01:30:23.920 --> 01:30:26.340]   matter for our health, whether or not we sleep matters
[01:30:26.340 --> 01:30:27.180]   for our health.
[01:30:27.180 --> 01:30:29.420]   And all of these impact our mental health
[01:30:29.420 --> 01:30:30.500]   and wellbeing as well.
[01:30:30.500 --> 01:30:34.260]   And so when I think about that bias,
[01:30:34.260 --> 01:30:39.100]   that to me is not always stemming from money
[01:30:39.100 --> 01:30:40.740]   that came from a pharmaceutical company,
[01:30:40.740 --> 01:30:43.860]   although I think the ads that we see all the time
[01:30:43.860 --> 01:30:45.780]   from pharma companies I think try to convince us
[01:30:45.780 --> 01:30:47.160]   that hey, just take this pill once a day
[01:30:47.160 --> 01:30:49.080]   and all your problems will go away.
[01:30:49.080 --> 01:30:51.100]   But I think it's more complex than that.
[01:30:51.100 --> 01:30:56.100]   And I think that even for in the healthcare setting,
[01:30:56.100 --> 01:31:00.860]   like if you're seeing a patient who has pain,
[01:31:00.860 --> 01:31:04.340]   who's having intense pain, it feels easier sometimes
[01:31:04.340 --> 01:31:07.260]   to prescribe a medication for that pain
[01:31:07.260 --> 01:31:11.660]   rather than trying to deal with non-medication-based
[01:31:11.660 --> 01:31:14.120]   approaches or try to get the deeper origins of the pain.
[01:31:14.120 --> 01:31:16.780]   I'm not saying that's what doctors do all the time,
[01:31:16.780 --> 01:31:19.240]   but I'm saying that we're living in an environment
[01:31:19.240 --> 01:31:22.740]   and a broader culture where we I think increasingly reach
[01:31:22.740 --> 01:31:26.760]   for something that we see as a quick, immediate fix.
[01:31:26.760 --> 01:31:28.200]   And again, don't blame people for that.
[01:31:28.200 --> 01:31:29.980]   We'd rather take a quick fix over something
[01:31:29.980 --> 01:31:31.360]   that's gonna take a long time.
[01:31:31.360 --> 01:31:35.740]   But I think it is selling us I think sometimes a false hope,
[01:31:35.740 --> 01:31:38.860]   which is that that's all we need to solve our problems.
[01:31:38.860 --> 01:31:41.060]   And I think a lot of times you need more.
[01:31:41.060 --> 01:31:42.300]   You need the behavioral changes.
[01:31:42.300 --> 01:31:44.440]   You need the environmental changes.
[01:31:44.440 --> 01:31:47.080]   That's one of my big concerns in terms of how we communicate
[01:31:47.080 --> 01:31:47.920]   about health.
[01:31:49.020 --> 01:31:52.100]   - Would a potential solution be this idea
[01:31:52.100 --> 01:31:53.060]   of small committees?
[01:31:53.060 --> 01:31:56.840]   So let's say somebody is experiencing chronic pain,
[01:31:56.840 --> 01:31:59.260]   localized or general, that they would go
[01:31:59.260 --> 01:32:02.400]   to their general practitioner, but in the room
[01:32:02.400 --> 01:32:06.900]   would also be somebody who understands somatic medicine,
[01:32:06.900 --> 01:32:09.200]   trained clinical psychologists who understand somatics
[01:32:09.200 --> 01:32:10.940]   that the body and the brain are linked
[01:32:10.940 --> 01:32:14.740]   through the nervous system and could also assess
[01:32:14.740 --> 01:32:18.860]   possible psychological roots of the issue.
[01:32:18.860 --> 01:32:22.020]   And then somebody in the room who can make behavioral,
[01:32:22.020 --> 01:32:25.960]   nutritional, maybe even supplementation-based,
[01:32:25.960 --> 01:32:27.980]   safe supplementation-based recommendations.
[01:32:27.980 --> 01:32:29.620]   And then the physician who can say,
[01:32:29.620 --> 01:32:31.660]   and in addition to that, I think the person
[01:32:31.660 --> 01:32:35.220]   should have on hand a five milligram dosage
[01:32:35.220 --> 01:32:37.700]   of a prescription drug that if they need it,
[01:32:37.700 --> 01:32:38.780]   they could take.
[01:32:38.780 --> 01:32:41.540]   And I think it would provide a lot of protections
[01:32:41.540 --> 01:32:45.780]   against potential adverse effects
[01:32:45.780 --> 01:32:48.560]   of any one of those things in isolation.
[01:32:48.560 --> 01:32:52.200]   There's great protections in having people meet in groups
[01:32:52.200 --> 01:32:53.780]   for lots of reasons.
[01:32:53.780 --> 01:32:56.960]   And the person would feel very well cared for.
[01:32:56.960 --> 01:33:00.960]   So again, small committees of people with diverse expertise
[01:33:00.960 --> 01:33:03.660]   pooling together to treat people from,
[01:33:03.660 --> 01:33:06.300]   for lack of a better word, a more holistic perspective.
[01:33:06.300 --> 01:33:07.740]   Why not?
[01:33:07.740 --> 01:33:09.120]   - I mean, you're describing the dream.
[01:33:09.120 --> 01:33:10.700]   I think that's exactly what we need,
[01:33:10.700 --> 01:33:13.940]   interdisciplinary teams that can provide integrative care,
[01:33:13.940 --> 01:33:15.740]   recognizing that in this day and age,
[01:33:15.740 --> 01:33:18.340]   there's not one person who has all the expertise
[01:33:18.340 --> 01:33:20.780]   to help us figure out how to best manage
[01:33:20.780 --> 01:33:22.440]   our health challenges.
[01:33:22.440 --> 01:33:25.600]   I think what we have not figured out are a couple things.
[01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:27.600]   Number one, who are all the right people
[01:33:27.600 --> 01:33:29.360]   who need to be in the room?
[01:33:29.360 --> 01:33:32.940]   Or the sort of virtual room, if you will.
[01:33:32.940 --> 01:33:36.180]   The second is how do we create a structure,
[01:33:36.180 --> 01:33:38.260]   a healthcare system where that can actually happen
[01:33:38.260 --> 01:33:41.460]   with efficiency, where it can be reimbursed appropriately?
[01:33:41.460 --> 01:33:42.780]   But that's what we should be doing.
[01:33:42.780 --> 01:33:45.560]   And then the third leg of that is the group experience
[01:33:45.560 --> 01:33:46.960]   for patients, right?
[01:33:46.960 --> 01:33:49.000]   And there's increasingly more clinics
[01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:50.960]   and healthcare systems around the country
[01:33:50.960 --> 01:33:53.740]   that are working on creating group experiences
[01:33:53.740 --> 01:33:55.480]   where patients who all, let's say,
[01:33:55.480 --> 01:33:59.220]   are working on their diabetes come together,
[01:33:59.220 --> 01:34:01.120]   let's say, once a week and they meet
[01:34:01.120 --> 01:34:02.620]   with the healthcare practitioner.
[01:34:02.620 --> 01:34:05.340]   That might be in addition to their individual appointments.
[01:34:05.340 --> 01:34:08.520]   But there is so much power in groups coming together,
[01:34:08.520 --> 01:34:10.480]   groups of patients who can find community,
[01:34:10.480 --> 01:34:11.320]   who can help each other,
[01:34:11.320 --> 01:34:13.680]   learn from each other's experiences.
[01:34:13.680 --> 01:34:16.380]   That's highly underutilized right now in medicine.
[01:34:17.200 --> 01:34:19.720]   But to really do this well, Andrew,
[01:34:19.720 --> 01:34:22.840]   I think means that we have to pull back
[01:34:22.840 --> 01:34:25.800]   from the model we have had for years in medicine,
[01:34:25.800 --> 01:34:29.160]   which has been a highly individual type model,
[01:34:29.160 --> 01:34:32.220]   which says, okay, you go to your doctor,
[01:34:32.220 --> 01:34:33.760]   you see your doctor one-on-one,
[01:34:33.760 --> 01:34:34.920]   you get everything you need.
[01:34:34.920 --> 01:34:36.320]   Maybe you need to go see a specialist.
[01:34:36.320 --> 01:34:37.880]   Okay, then you wait a few weeks,
[01:34:37.880 --> 01:34:39.480]   get another appointment, drive 30 miles,
[01:34:39.480 --> 01:34:40.860]   go see somebody else.
[01:34:40.860 --> 01:34:42.880]   Maybe they're connected to the electronic health system.
[01:34:42.880 --> 01:34:43.720]   Maybe they're not.
[01:34:43.720 --> 01:34:44.640]   Maybe they know what was discussed.
[01:34:44.640 --> 01:34:45.900]   Maybe they don't.
[01:34:45.900 --> 01:34:47.960]   Maybe they'll call and talk to their primary care doctor,
[01:34:47.960 --> 01:34:49.560]   but maybe they won't 'cause they're too busy.
[01:34:49.560 --> 01:34:51.480]   And then you as a patient are stuck
[01:34:51.480 --> 01:34:53.160]   trying to piece all this together.
[01:34:53.160 --> 01:34:55.160]   - While often in pain.
[01:34:55.160 --> 01:34:56.000]   - Well, yeah.
[01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.320]   - In physical and emotional anguish.
[01:34:58.320 --> 01:34:59.680]   I'm not referring to my own experience,
[01:34:59.680 --> 01:35:02.000]   although I've had mild examples
[01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:03.360]   compared to what other people have dealt with.
[01:35:03.360 --> 01:35:06.560]   But people with chronic pain are irritable
[01:35:06.560 --> 01:35:08.360]   for understandable reasons.
[01:35:08.360 --> 01:35:11.560]   I mean, it's, or maybe somebody is close,
[01:35:11.560 --> 01:35:13.700]   veering towards suicidal depression.
[01:35:13.700 --> 01:35:15.120]   Then there's the interpersonal effects.
[01:35:15.120 --> 01:35:17.940]   I mean, I feel like the crisis is one
[01:35:17.940 --> 01:35:20.880]   of a lack of efficiency and thoroughness.
[01:35:20.880 --> 01:35:23.200]   And again, I'm not throwing stones
[01:35:23.200 --> 01:35:24.460]   at the medical profession.
[01:35:24.460 --> 01:35:27.660]   I, like you, believe that it's a collection
[01:35:27.660 --> 01:35:31.340]   of mostly well-meaning people trying to do their best.
[01:35:31.340 --> 01:35:34.420]   But the specialist model and the referral model
[01:35:34.420 --> 01:35:36.500]   is incredibly cumbersome.
[01:35:36.500 --> 01:35:37.640]   - It really is cumbersome.
[01:35:37.640 --> 01:35:39.940]   And like you, look, I, having worked
[01:35:39.940 --> 01:35:41.780]   with many medical professions over the years,
[01:35:41.780 --> 01:35:44.320]   like these are colleagues who I deeply admire.
[01:35:44.320 --> 01:35:45.680]   I mean, they're there for the right reasons.
[01:35:45.680 --> 01:35:48.100]   They wanna help people alleviate suffering.
[01:35:48.100 --> 01:35:51.280]   But they too are feeling burned out and frustrated
[01:35:51.280 --> 01:35:53.240]   by the inefficiencies of the system.
[01:35:53.240 --> 01:35:55.200]   'Cause I'll tell you, one of the greatest contributors
[01:35:55.200 --> 01:36:00.160]   to burnout for doctors and nurses is a lack of self-efficacy.
[01:36:00.160 --> 01:36:03.840]   It's seeing a patient who has a problem in front of you
[01:36:03.840 --> 01:36:06.880]   and feeling like you can't get them the help that they need.
[01:36:06.880 --> 01:36:09.880]   That is the greatest paper cut, if you will,
[01:36:09.880 --> 01:36:12.120]   to the sort of spirit of clinicians.
[01:36:12.120 --> 01:36:14.440]   And many find themselves in that circumstance
[01:36:14.440 --> 01:36:16.340]   where they either find that they know what's needed,
[01:36:16.340 --> 01:36:19.760]   but the system is throwing up prior authorizations
[01:36:19.760 --> 01:36:22.000]   or other insurance hurdles in preventing their patient
[01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:23.380]   from getting that care.
[01:36:23.380 --> 01:36:25.840]   Or they are kind of at the edge of their expertise.
[01:36:25.840 --> 01:36:28.000]   This happens to pediatricians and primary care doctors
[01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.840]   more broadly all the time with mental health.
[01:36:30.840 --> 01:36:32.720]   Most of the mental health care that's delivered
[01:36:32.720 --> 01:36:36.700]   in this country is delivered in primary care offices.
[01:36:36.700 --> 01:36:39.080]   Now, primary care doctors didn't necessarily
[01:36:39.080 --> 01:36:41.220]   train specifically and only in mental health,
[01:36:41.220 --> 01:36:43.880]   yet they find themselves having to manage a lot of that,
[01:36:43.880 --> 01:36:47.620]   including increasingly complex substance use disorders
[01:36:47.620 --> 01:36:49.500]   and treatment-resistant depression.
[01:36:49.500 --> 01:36:51.700]   And they need help figuring that out.
[01:36:51.700 --> 01:36:53.900]   But if you don't have a lot of resources
[01:36:53.900 --> 01:36:56.160]   to get that referral to collaborate
[01:36:56.160 --> 01:36:58.020]   with mental health professionals,
[01:36:58.020 --> 01:37:00.080]   then you're stuck on your own figuring that out.
[01:37:00.080 --> 01:37:03.040]   And so, I think the pain is being experienced
[01:37:03.040 --> 01:37:06.820]   mostly by patients, but also very much so by clinicians.
[01:37:06.820 --> 01:37:08.300]   And that's why that overhaul is needed.
[01:37:08.300 --> 01:37:11.040]   And I think, look, a lot of this is, you know,
[01:37:11.040 --> 01:37:12.520]   I'm not a healthcare economist per se,
[01:37:12.520 --> 01:37:14.440]   but I will say that a lot of this, I think,
[01:37:14.440 --> 01:37:15.840]   is tied into the business model
[01:37:15.840 --> 01:37:17.440]   that we've built around medicine.
[01:37:17.440 --> 01:37:21.020]   The notion that we're paying individual people
[01:37:21.020 --> 01:37:23.480]   for individual services and individual procedures
[01:37:23.480 --> 01:37:24.440]   that are done.
[01:37:24.440 --> 01:37:27.480]   While that has some merit in some cases,
[01:37:27.480 --> 01:37:29.640]   what we really care about is that the person
[01:37:29.640 --> 01:37:32.200]   is getting efficient, integrated,
[01:37:32.200 --> 01:37:34.040]   multidisciplinary care overall.
[01:37:34.040 --> 01:37:36.040]   And so, when health systems, for example,
[01:37:36.040 --> 01:37:39.880]   come together and say, okay, rather than sort of focusing
[01:37:39.880 --> 01:37:42.460]   on the amount I'm getting reimbursed for every procedure,
[01:37:42.460 --> 01:37:45.020]   we're gonna take more of a value-based approach here,
[01:37:45.020 --> 01:37:47.340]   where we say, okay, we've got a certain amount of money
[01:37:47.340 --> 01:37:48.640]   to care for certain people.
[01:37:48.640 --> 01:37:51.900]   What's the most efficient way for us to provide them care?
[01:37:51.900 --> 01:37:53.340]   Recognizing if we don't do that,
[01:37:53.340 --> 01:37:55.580]   it's not only bad for them,
[01:37:55.580 --> 01:37:58.140]   but our costs in the long term will go up,
[01:37:58.140 --> 01:38:00.080]   because we're not getting reimbursed for every procedure.
[01:38:00.080 --> 01:38:02.500]   We're getting reimbursed for the care,
[01:38:02.500 --> 01:38:04.460]   overall care that we're taking for our patients.
[01:38:04.460 --> 01:38:06.760]   So, there are more of these value-based models
[01:38:06.760 --> 01:38:08.880]   that are being adopted.
[01:38:08.880 --> 01:38:12.680]   Certainly in 2010, when the Affordable Care Act was passed,
[01:38:12.680 --> 01:38:14.580]   and when other measures were taken,
[01:38:14.580 --> 01:38:16.860]   and the Obama administration in Medicare,
[01:38:16.860 --> 01:38:20.260]   that really pushed value-based payment models forward.
[01:38:20.260 --> 01:38:21.620]   And again, they're not perfect.
[01:38:21.620 --> 01:38:23.860]   But they need their own tweaks.
[01:38:23.860 --> 01:38:27.220]   But I don't think that the existing financial structure
[01:38:27.220 --> 01:38:29.020]   that we had in medicine was serving us,
[01:38:29.020 --> 01:38:32.300]   in terms of delivering the kind of multidisciplinary,
[01:38:32.300 --> 01:38:36.340]   integrated, efficient care that we increasingly need.
[01:38:36.340 --> 01:38:39.520]   - Tough problem, but through recognition of tough problems,
[01:38:39.520 --> 01:38:40.880]   comes good solutions.
[01:38:40.880 --> 01:38:41.720]   That's my belief.
[01:38:41.720 --> 01:38:43.560]   I'm an optimist at the end of the day.
[01:38:43.560 --> 01:38:45.020]   You mentioned mental health.
[01:38:45.020 --> 01:38:46.500]   Lately, you've been increasingly vocal
[01:38:46.500 --> 01:38:48.260]   about the crisis of isolation.
[01:38:48.260 --> 01:38:50.160]   - Just one second, Andrew, before we go there,
[01:38:50.160 --> 01:38:51.620]   one thing about the tough problems, right?
[01:38:51.620 --> 01:38:52.460]   You're exactly right.
[01:38:52.460 --> 01:38:55.240]   And the problem is the longer we take to acknowledge
[01:38:55.240 --> 01:38:57.060]   and address these tough problems,
[01:38:57.060 --> 01:38:59.660]   the more entrenched the interests become
[01:38:59.660 --> 01:39:01.980]   that profit from the status quo, right?
[01:39:01.980 --> 01:39:06.980]   So if you look at the private insurance industry right now,
[01:39:06.980 --> 01:39:10.260]   there are so many challenges we have right now
[01:39:10.260 --> 01:39:14.140]   with patients and clinicians saying that
[01:39:14.140 --> 01:39:17.280]   they know what care is needed, but it gets denied.
[01:39:17.280 --> 01:39:20.220]   They know what care is needed, but prior authorizations
[01:39:20.220 --> 01:39:23.020]   get thrown up there and required,
[01:39:23.020 --> 01:39:24.460]   even for a medicine that clearly
[01:39:24.460 --> 01:39:26.140]   your patient needs urgently.
[01:39:26.140 --> 01:39:30.620]   I've had the experience myself of having a family member
[01:39:30.620 --> 01:39:34.040]   who has needed a medication for an urgent situation,
[01:39:34.040 --> 01:39:36.860]   and then being told that the pharmacy will not fill it
[01:39:36.860 --> 01:39:39.260]   because it requires a prior authorization,
[01:39:39.260 --> 01:39:42.760]   but that can't be processed until the weekend is over
[01:39:42.760 --> 01:39:44.120]   because no one's in the office
[01:39:44.120 --> 01:39:46.020]   to approve the prior authorization.
[01:39:46.020 --> 01:39:48.460]   And you're thinking to yourself, does this make any sense?
[01:39:48.460 --> 01:39:50.100]   Like, this is an urgent situation.
[01:39:50.100 --> 01:39:52.500]   My family member needs this medication.
[01:39:52.500 --> 01:39:54.960]   I've also had the experience as a doctor
[01:39:54.960 --> 01:39:58.340]   of fighting for my patients who have been denied care
[01:39:58.340 --> 01:40:00.200]   by an insurance company and being on the phone
[01:40:00.200 --> 01:40:03.760]   saying, I'm sitting here in front of my patient.
[01:40:03.760 --> 01:40:05.460]   I know that they are sick.
[01:40:05.460 --> 01:40:06.920]   I know they can't go home.
[01:40:06.920 --> 01:40:08.760]   I know they need to be in rehab.
[01:40:08.760 --> 01:40:11.980]   There's nobody literally to help them at home,
[01:40:11.980 --> 01:40:15.620]   but then not having the rehab bed approved
[01:40:15.620 --> 01:40:17.820]   by somebody who's not even there, right?
[01:40:17.820 --> 01:40:21.120]   And there's also just a practice that we've seen
[01:40:21.120 --> 01:40:23.780]   time and time again where insurance companies
[01:40:23.780 --> 01:40:25.940]   will also just burden clinicians
[01:40:25.940 --> 01:40:28.200]   with more and more requests for information
[01:40:28.200 --> 01:40:31.100]   before they will agree to reimburse for services
[01:40:31.100 --> 01:40:32.300]   that have already been delivered
[01:40:32.300 --> 01:40:33.740]   for a patient who needs them,
[01:40:33.740 --> 01:40:35.440]   which is just creating more and more barriers,
[01:40:35.440 --> 01:40:38.020]   hoping that if you're a small-time doc out there
[01:40:38.020 --> 01:40:40.260]   who's got a shingle that you put up,
[01:40:40.260 --> 01:40:41.340]   you don't have a lot of resources,
[01:40:41.340 --> 01:40:43.300]   how are you gonna keep fighting all of this
[01:40:43.300 --> 01:40:44.540]   and sending more and more paperwork?
[01:40:44.540 --> 01:40:47.100]   And eventually you'll just give up.
[01:40:47.100 --> 01:40:48.660]   We have a lot of problems right there.
[01:40:48.660 --> 01:40:52.380]   In an industry that should be delivering care
[01:40:52.380 --> 01:40:54.140]   often is doing good things,
[01:40:54.140 --> 01:40:57.740]   but too often I think is allowing barriers to be put up
[01:40:57.740 --> 01:40:58.700]   to the care that's needed,
[01:40:58.700 --> 01:41:00.380]   and this is particularly true with mental health.
[01:41:00.380 --> 01:41:01.800]   I know we're gonna talk about that,
[01:41:01.800 --> 01:41:06.800]   but mental health care has just been such a difficult thing
[01:41:06.800 --> 01:41:08.540]   for people to get in our country,
[01:41:08.540 --> 01:41:10.420]   and part of the reason, there are many reasons,
[01:41:10.420 --> 01:41:13.280]   but one of them is that insurance companies historically
[01:41:13.280 --> 01:41:16.720]   did not reimburse adequately or in the same level
[01:41:16.720 --> 01:41:19.420]   for mental health care as they did for physical health care,
[01:41:19.420 --> 01:41:21.400]   or if they did, they would only reimburse
[01:41:21.400 --> 01:41:23.940]   for a limited number of sessions that you could have.
[01:41:24.820 --> 01:41:29.740]   But if you're a mom out there who sees her child struggling
[01:41:29.740 --> 01:41:31.740]   with depression, you're really worried,
[01:41:31.740 --> 01:41:35.420]   you don't wanna be told, you know what,
[01:41:35.420 --> 01:41:38.660]   you can only get three sessions, that's it.
[01:41:38.660 --> 01:41:41.300]   What are you supposed to do after three sessions, right?
[01:41:41.300 --> 01:41:44.180]   And so what has happened is that even though in 2008
[01:41:44.180 --> 01:41:47.920]   there was a law passed called the Addiction Equity
[01:41:47.920 --> 01:41:49.460]   and Mental Health Parity Law,
[01:41:49.460 --> 01:41:53.620]   even though that was passed to try to close that gap,
[01:41:53.620 --> 01:41:55.740]   there were many ways that insurance companies
[01:41:55.740 --> 01:41:56.880]   were skirting it, right?
[01:41:56.880 --> 01:41:59.580]   So one, the law wasn't even being adequately reinforced
[01:41:59.580 --> 01:42:02.300]   for many years, but two, insurance companies sometimes
[01:42:02.300 --> 01:42:04.340]   would say, okay, we're reimbursing adequately,
[01:42:04.340 --> 01:42:06.140]   but when you look in the network,
[01:42:06.140 --> 01:42:07.380]   they had very few providers,
[01:42:07.380 --> 01:42:09.620]   so you really couldn't access somebody, right?
[01:42:09.620 --> 01:42:11.380]   So that was a problem for patients.
[01:42:11.380 --> 01:42:14.020]   And then the other challenge is that they would say,
[01:42:14.020 --> 01:42:15.200]   okay, you can see somebody,
[01:42:15.200 --> 01:42:17.540]   but you've gotta complete this prior authorization,
[01:42:17.540 --> 01:42:19.780]   have that completed by your primary care doctor, et cetera,
[01:42:19.780 --> 01:42:21.740]   again, throwing up more and more barriers.
[01:42:21.740 --> 01:42:24.580]   So very recently, in fact, just a few weeks ago,
[01:42:24.580 --> 01:42:27.760]   President Biden just announced that we are,
[01:42:27.760 --> 01:42:29.940]   from as an administration, putting out a proposed rule
[01:42:29.940 --> 01:42:33.400]   to actually strengthen the Mental Health Parity Law
[01:42:33.400 --> 01:42:34.980]   to prevent some of these,
[01:42:34.980 --> 01:42:37.120]   what I think of as abusive practices,
[01:42:37.120 --> 01:42:38.700]   because they're preventing people
[01:42:38.700 --> 01:42:40.080]   who need care from getting it.
[01:42:40.080 --> 01:42:43.380]   And if you've ever been, as I know many people have been
[01:42:43.380 --> 01:42:44.200]   who are listening to this,
[01:42:44.200 --> 01:42:46.140]   if you've ever been in a situation where you
[01:42:46.140 --> 01:42:47.580]   or somebody you love has struggled
[01:42:47.580 --> 01:42:49.540]   with a mental health concern,
[01:42:49.540 --> 01:42:52.500]   what you need in that circumstance is help.
[01:42:52.500 --> 01:42:54.600]   You don't need to be filling out paperwork.
[01:42:54.600 --> 01:42:56.260]   You don't need to be waiting three months
[01:42:56.260 --> 01:42:57.700]   to actually get care.
[01:42:57.700 --> 01:42:59.220]   You don't need to show up and be told
[01:42:59.220 --> 01:43:00.680]   only you only have two more appointments.
[01:43:00.680 --> 01:43:02.820]   You need to know that help is there when you need it.
[01:43:02.820 --> 01:43:07.140]   And a lot of these denials are being issued to people
[01:43:07.140 --> 01:43:10.300]   who have done their part of the bargain.
[01:43:10.300 --> 01:43:11.900]   They've paid their premiums.
[01:43:11.900 --> 01:43:13.900]   They've held up their end of the bargain,
[01:43:13.900 --> 01:43:15.900]   and care should be there for them when they need it.
[01:43:15.900 --> 01:43:18.100]   So anyway, this is something that upsets me a lot
[01:43:18.100 --> 01:43:21.660]   because I have seen too many patients over the years
[01:43:21.660 --> 01:43:25.100]   struggle without the care that they deserve and should get
[01:43:25.100 --> 01:43:27.640]   because the barriers are being thrown up by industry.
[01:43:27.640 --> 01:43:29.680]   But I say all that just to say that
[01:43:29.680 --> 01:43:31.860]   when you take on big problems,
[01:43:31.860 --> 01:43:34.540]   you will run up against entrenched interests.
[01:43:34.540 --> 01:43:36.980]   And that's a fight we have to take on.
[01:43:36.980 --> 01:43:38.720]   We can't shy away from it.
[01:43:38.720 --> 01:43:41.340]   We can't say, this is politically too difficult.
[01:43:41.340 --> 01:43:42.620]   Like one of the things I'm very proud of
[01:43:42.620 --> 01:43:46.540]   is that we're finally negotiating on drug prices
[01:43:46.540 --> 01:43:47.820]   through the Medicare program,
[01:43:47.820 --> 01:43:50.980]   something that should have been done decades ago.
[01:43:50.980 --> 01:43:53.300]   But it's finally happening now.
[01:43:53.300 --> 01:43:55.380]   The administration just decided this has gotta happen.
[01:43:55.380 --> 01:43:56.420]   It was passed by Congress.
[01:43:56.420 --> 01:43:57.780]   This is good.
[01:43:57.780 --> 01:44:02.500]   And it makes no sense that we would pay more than we need to
[01:44:02.500 --> 01:44:07.060]   and pass the cost on to taxpayers when we can negotiate.
[01:44:07.060 --> 01:44:09.100]   And we gotta get, look,
[01:44:09.100 --> 01:44:10.660]   if you're collecting taxes as government,
[01:44:10.660 --> 01:44:12.180]   you should be doing your best to make sure
[01:44:12.180 --> 01:44:15.260]   every one of those dollars is being spent well, right?
[01:44:15.260 --> 01:44:18.300]   'Cause somebody took money out of their paycheck,
[01:44:18.300 --> 01:44:19.420]   didn't use it for their family,
[01:44:19.420 --> 01:44:20.420]   didn't use it for their kids,
[01:44:20.420 --> 01:44:21.640]   and they gave it to the government.
[01:44:21.640 --> 01:44:24.260]   For good reason, because that supports first responders,
[01:44:24.260 --> 01:44:27.140]   police officers, a whole bunch of services that we need.
[01:44:27.140 --> 01:44:28.380]   But the response to being in government
[01:44:28.380 --> 01:44:30.180]   is to make sure that money's being used well.
[01:44:30.180 --> 01:44:32.580]   And to pay more for medications than we should
[01:44:32.580 --> 01:44:34.980]   makes no sense at all,
[01:44:34.980 --> 01:44:37.300]   especially for our patients and taxpayers.
[01:44:37.300 --> 01:44:39.900]   - So clearly some steps in the right direction are occurring.
[01:44:39.900 --> 01:44:41.980]   While on the topic of mental health,
[01:44:43.360 --> 01:44:45.660]   let's talk about the isolation crisis.
[01:44:45.660 --> 01:44:48.640]   What is the isolation crisis?
[01:44:48.640 --> 01:44:51.460]   What aspects of mental and physical health is it impacting?
[01:44:51.460 --> 01:44:53.700]   And then perhaps most importantly,
[01:44:53.700 --> 01:44:56.960]   what can we each and all do about it?
[01:44:56.960 --> 01:45:02.040]   - Well, this is one of those issues that I,
[01:45:02.040 --> 01:45:04.360]   if you had told me, Andrew, 10 years ago,
[01:45:04.360 --> 01:45:05.400]   hey, you and I are gonna be sitting here
[01:45:05.400 --> 01:45:08.120]   talking about loneliness and isolation, I would have said,
[01:45:08.120 --> 01:45:10.020]   I don't think so.
[01:45:10.020 --> 01:45:12.080]   But I was really educated by people I met
[01:45:12.080 --> 01:45:14.180]   across the country about the fact
[01:45:14.180 --> 01:45:15.380]   that this is a real problem.
[01:45:15.380 --> 01:45:18.340]   And the truth is, it was familiar to me
[01:45:18.340 --> 01:45:20.460]   because of my own personal experiences.
[01:45:20.460 --> 01:45:21.820]   As a child, I struggled a lot
[01:45:21.820 --> 01:45:24.020]   with a sense of loneliness and isolation.
[01:45:24.020 --> 01:45:25.200]   I was really shy as a kid.
[01:45:25.200 --> 01:45:26.940]   I was pretty introverted.
[01:45:26.940 --> 01:45:29.740]   And I wanted to make friends and hang out with other kids,
[01:45:29.740 --> 01:45:32.460]   but it took me a while to actually build those relationships.
[01:45:32.460 --> 01:45:35.820]   So I spent a lot of time feeling left out.
[01:45:35.820 --> 01:45:40.500]   There were times when I would, like in elementary school,
[01:45:40.500 --> 01:45:42.680]   there were days where I pretended I had a stomach ache
[01:45:42.680 --> 01:45:45.160]   and so that my mom wouldn't make me go to school.
[01:45:45.160 --> 01:45:47.680]   And it wasn't 'cause I was scared of a test or a teacher
[01:45:47.680 --> 01:45:51.380]   'cause I didn't wanna walk into the cafeteria one more time
[01:45:51.380 --> 01:45:53.440]   and be scared that there was nobody to sit next to
[01:45:53.440 --> 01:45:56.360]   or that no one would want me to be at their bench.
[01:45:56.360 --> 01:45:59.000]   As I know what it feels like,
[01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:00.800]   and I also know what the shame is like,
[01:46:00.800 --> 01:46:03.380]   'cause I never told my parents about this.
[01:46:03.380 --> 01:46:05.040]   I never told anyone about that
[01:46:05.040 --> 01:46:07.760]   because even though I knew my parents loved me,
[01:46:07.760 --> 01:46:10.240]   I just felt like, hey, if I'm feeling this lonely,
[01:46:10.240 --> 01:46:11.460]   it means that something's wrong with me.
[01:46:11.460 --> 01:46:12.300]   I'm not likable.
[01:46:12.300 --> 01:46:13.800]   I'm not lovable.
[01:46:13.800 --> 01:46:16.340]   Something's gotta be, it's gotta be my fault in some way.
[01:46:16.340 --> 01:46:17.580]   It was only years later, Andrew,
[01:46:17.580 --> 01:46:19.680]   when I talked to friends from grade school
[01:46:19.680 --> 01:46:21.540]   that I realized that a lot of them
[01:46:21.540 --> 01:46:22.900]   were feeling the same thing.
[01:46:22.900 --> 01:46:25.500]   We were all struggling by ourselves.
[01:46:25.500 --> 01:46:27.320]   No one really knew it.
[01:46:27.320 --> 01:46:29.220]   And I came to see a lot of this as a doctor
[01:46:29.220 --> 01:46:31.220]   when I was taking care of patients.
[01:46:31.220 --> 01:46:33.780]   And I never took a class on loneliness in medical school.
[01:46:33.780 --> 01:46:36.320]   It wasn't part of our residency curriculum.
[01:46:36.320 --> 01:46:38.680]   Yet when I showed up in the hospital,
[01:46:38.680 --> 01:46:41.400]   I found that the patient who had come in
[01:46:41.400 --> 01:46:43.760]   with a diabetic wound infection
[01:46:43.760 --> 01:46:47.120]   or who had come in because they had had a heart attack,
[01:46:47.120 --> 01:46:49.080]   when I sat down and talked to them,
[01:46:49.080 --> 01:46:50.680]   often in the background they would talk about
[01:46:50.680 --> 01:46:52.340]   how lonely they were.
[01:46:52.340 --> 01:46:54.000]   Sometimes I would ask them,
[01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:57.200]   hey, I need to have a difficult conversation
[01:46:57.200 --> 01:46:59.080]   about your diagnosis.
[01:46:59.080 --> 01:47:00.800]   Is there somebody you'd want me to call
[01:47:00.800 --> 01:47:02.040]   to be with you during this time?
[01:47:02.040 --> 01:47:04.040]   And too often the answer was,
[01:47:04.040 --> 01:47:05.560]   I wish there was, but there's nobody.
[01:47:05.560 --> 01:47:08.520]   I'll just have the conversation by myself.
[01:47:08.520 --> 01:47:09.760]   But it was when I was surgeon general
[01:47:09.760 --> 01:47:11.100]   I realized that those experiences
[01:47:11.100 --> 01:47:13.320]   weren't limited to me and my patients,
[01:47:13.320 --> 01:47:14.520]   that they were incredibly common.
[01:47:14.520 --> 01:47:17.960]   And two things I learned when I dug into the data, Andrew,
[01:47:17.960 --> 01:47:21.340]   was number one, that loneliness is exceedingly common
[01:47:21.340 --> 01:47:23.080]   with one in two adults in America
[01:47:23.080 --> 01:47:25.480]   reporting measurable levels of loneliness.
[01:47:25.480 --> 01:47:28.640]   But the numbers are actually even higher
[01:47:28.640 --> 01:47:31.240]   among young adults and adolescents.
[01:47:31.240 --> 01:47:34.280]   The numbers among youth actually,
[01:47:34.280 --> 01:47:35.820]   depending on the surveys you look at,
[01:47:35.820 --> 01:47:38.000]   are between 70 to 80%
[01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:41.120]   who say that they are struggling with loneliness.
[01:47:41.120 --> 01:47:42.600]   So that's the first thing that I learned.
[01:47:42.600 --> 01:47:45.520]   But the second thing was how consequential loneliness was.
[01:47:45.520 --> 01:47:48.000]   I used to think loneliness was just a bad feeling.
[01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:51.220]   What I came to see in digging into the scientific literature
[01:47:51.220 --> 01:47:54.060]   was that feeling socially disconnected,
[01:47:54.060 --> 01:47:55.160]   being lonely and isolated,
[01:47:55.160 --> 01:47:58.560]   was actually associated with increased risk of depression,
[01:47:58.560 --> 01:48:02.200]   anxiety, suicide, but also an increased risk
[01:48:02.200 --> 01:48:06.040]   of cardiovascular disease, of dementia.
[01:48:06.040 --> 01:48:07.300]   And these are not small risks.
[01:48:07.300 --> 01:48:09.400]   We're talking about 29% increase
[01:48:09.400 --> 01:48:11.460]   in the risk of coronary heart disease,
[01:48:11.460 --> 01:48:14.340]   31% risk in the increased risk of stroke,
[01:48:14.340 --> 01:48:17.840]   50% increased risk of dementia among older people,
[01:48:17.840 --> 01:48:20.240]   increased risk of premature death,
[01:48:20.240 --> 01:48:23.880]   and the mortality impact of loneliness, by the way,
[01:48:23.880 --> 01:48:26.840]   and loneliness and isolation is comparable
[01:48:26.840 --> 01:48:30.440]   to the mortality impact of many other illnesses.
[01:48:30.440 --> 01:48:32.820]   In fact, it's even greater than the mortality impact
[01:48:32.820 --> 01:48:34.760]   we see associated with obesity,
[01:48:34.760 --> 01:48:36.360]   which is something we clearly recognize
[01:48:36.360 --> 01:48:37.380]   as a public health issue.
[01:48:37.380 --> 01:48:39.040]   So you put all this together.
[01:48:39.040 --> 01:48:41.940]   And for me, one of the key takeaways
[01:48:41.940 --> 01:48:45.220]   is that loneliness and isolation
[01:48:45.220 --> 01:48:47.440]   are critical public health challenges
[01:48:47.440 --> 01:48:50.180]   that are hiding behind the curtain,
[01:48:50.180 --> 01:48:52.920]   behind this wall of stigma and shame.
[01:48:52.920 --> 01:48:55.060]   And unless we talk about it and address it,
[01:48:55.060 --> 01:48:58.680]   unless we reconcile what's been happening to us
[01:48:58.680 --> 01:48:59.940]   over the last 50 years,
[01:48:59.940 --> 01:49:02.340]   where fewer and fewer people are participating
[01:49:02.340 --> 01:49:03.720]   in community organizations,
[01:49:03.720 --> 01:49:05.960]   where more and more people are feeling isolated,
[01:49:05.960 --> 01:49:08.080]   and we're not gonna be able to repair
[01:49:08.080 --> 01:49:10.360]   the fraying foundations of society,
[01:49:10.360 --> 01:49:12.280]   which are grounded fundamentally
[01:49:12.280 --> 01:49:13.980]   in our connection to one another.
[01:49:13.980 --> 01:49:17.580]   - You mentioned community organizations.
[01:49:17.580 --> 01:49:21.480]   Could you elaborate on those?
[01:49:21.480 --> 01:49:24.840]   Growing up in the '70s and '80s,
[01:49:24.840 --> 01:49:29.600]   I was exposed to community soccer teams,
[01:49:29.600 --> 01:49:31.600]   swim team, there was a community pool.
[01:49:31.600 --> 01:49:34.000]   These were all public things.
[01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:38.040]   There were churches, synagogues, and mosques.
[01:49:38.040 --> 01:49:40.560]   Are we not seeing as much participation
[01:49:40.560 --> 01:49:42.840]   in those types of organizations anymore?
[01:49:42.840 --> 01:49:45.720]   And what other types of organizations are out there
[01:49:45.720 --> 01:49:50.440]   that come to mind when you think about the isolation crisis?
[01:49:50.440 --> 01:49:52.040]   - Yeah, so there are several factors
[01:49:52.040 --> 01:49:54.720]   that have led to us being as isolated as we are.
[01:49:54.720 --> 01:49:55.840]   One of them, as you mentioned,
[01:49:55.840 --> 01:49:59.240]   is the decline in participation in community organizations.
[01:49:59.240 --> 01:50:01.280]   This isn't a recent phenomenon.
[01:50:01.280 --> 01:50:03.520]   This has been happening over the last half century
[01:50:03.520 --> 01:50:04.360]   in America.
[01:50:04.360 --> 01:50:07.640]   We've seen lower participation in faith organizations,
[01:50:07.640 --> 01:50:10.600]   in recreational leagues, in service organizations,
[01:50:10.600 --> 01:50:14.140]   and other community groups that used to bring us together.
[01:50:14.140 --> 01:50:17.280]   And I think we can talk about the reasons
[01:50:17.280 --> 01:50:19.280]   why that has been the case,
[01:50:19.280 --> 01:50:21.060]   but one of the key consequences of that
[01:50:21.060 --> 01:50:24.040]   is that people don't have places
[01:50:24.040 --> 01:50:26.120]   where they can come together and get to know one another,
[01:50:26.120 --> 01:50:28.140]   especially across differences.
[01:50:28.140 --> 01:50:29.600]   So we actually associate more and more
[01:50:29.600 --> 01:50:31.280]   with people who are like us.
[01:50:31.280 --> 01:50:33.820]   But this has also been fueled by a few other factors
[01:50:33.820 --> 01:50:35.760]   that are going on at the same time.
[01:50:35.760 --> 01:50:38.060]   One is that just from a cultural perspective,
[01:50:38.060 --> 01:50:40.320]   as modernity has arrived, not just in the U.S.,
[01:50:40.320 --> 01:50:42.400]   but in other countries,
[01:50:42.400 --> 01:50:44.380]   we've seen that people are more mobile, right?
[01:50:44.380 --> 01:50:45.360]   They move around more.
[01:50:45.360 --> 01:50:47.920]   We don't always stay in the community that we grew up in.
[01:50:47.920 --> 01:50:50.060]   We tend to, even if we move somewhere else for a school,
[01:50:50.060 --> 01:50:51.440]   we may go somewhere else for a job.
[01:50:51.440 --> 01:50:54.000]   We may change jobs and move somewhere else.
[01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.520]   We are leaving behind communities that we grew up with,
[01:50:56.520 --> 01:50:58.360]   that we went to school with, that we worked with.
[01:50:58.360 --> 01:51:00.520]   And I'm not saying that's all a bad thing, right?
[01:51:00.520 --> 01:51:03.480]   We have more opportunities, and that's a really good thing.
[01:51:03.480 --> 01:51:06.240]   But I think one thing that we have not accounted for
[01:51:06.240 --> 01:51:08.280]   is the cost of these changes, right?
[01:51:08.280 --> 01:51:10.440]   If we know what the costs are of certain actions,
[01:51:10.440 --> 01:51:11.840]   we may still take those actions,
[01:51:11.840 --> 01:51:14.400]   but we may find ways to mitigate the costs.
[01:51:14.400 --> 01:51:17.640]   We may, in this case, invest more in our relationships,
[01:51:17.640 --> 01:51:19.080]   be more conscious about reaching out
[01:51:19.080 --> 01:51:20.840]   to other people going to visit them.
[01:51:20.840 --> 01:51:25.140]   But that has been a quiet but devastating consequence.
[01:51:25.140 --> 01:51:26.960]   The other pieces with modernity
[01:51:26.960 --> 01:51:29.960]   is that we have more convenience in our life,
[01:51:29.960 --> 01:51:33.040]   which means that we also don't need to see other people
[01:51:33.040 --> 01:51:36.040]   to get certain things done, like buying groceries,
[01:51:36.040 --> 01:51:37.460]   or mailing an item out,
[01:51:37.460 --> 01:51:38.680]   or getting something from the store.
[01:51:38.680 --> 01:51:40.480]   I can sit in the comfort of my home
[01:51:40.480 --> 01:51:42.200]   and have everything just come to me.
[01:51:42.200 --> 01:51:45.220]   Now, on the one hand, that's incredibly efficient, right?
[01:51:45.220 --> 01:51:47.960]   But I think efficiency is an interesting thing,
[01:51:47.960 --> 01:51:49.280]   because it's only one factor
[01:51:49.280 --> 01:51:51.340]   we should be considering in our lives.
[01:51:51.340 --> 01:51:52.800]   There, too, we have to ask the costs.
[01:51:52.800 --> 01:51:54.400]   And one of the interesting things about COVID
[01:51:54.400 --> 01:51:56.160]   is many people, in the first year of COVID,
[01:51:56.160 --> 01:51:58.700]   when we were all separated from one another,
[01:51:58.700 --> 01:52:00.240]   when we finally came back together again,
[01:52:00.240 --> 01:52:01.200]   I had so many people who said to me,
[01:52:01.200 --> 01:52:04.220]   "You know what, I expected to miss my parents,
[01:52:04.220 --> 01:52:06.480]   "and my siblings, and my friends,
[01:52:06.480 --> 01:52:07.740]   "not being able to see them.
[01:52:07.740 --> 01:52:11.560]   "What I didn't expect was missing the strangers
[01:52:11.560 --> 01:52:13.180]   "that I saw at the coffee shop,
[01:52:13.180 --> 01:52:15.780]   "or the folks who I ran into at the grocery store,
[01:52:15.780 --> 01:52:18.780]   "or seeing neighbors as I walked down the street."
[01:52:18.780 --> 01:52:20.480]   I actually missed that more than I thought I would.
[01:52:20.480 --> 01:52:24.340]   So we have lost out on some of those interactions
[01:52:24.340 --> 01:52:25.820]   and those loose ties.
[01:52:25.820 --> 01:52:28.920]   But the final thing to keep in mind also
[01:52:28.920 --> 01:52:30.000]   is about what is happening
[01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.880]   with how we're using social media technology,
[01:52:32.880 --> 01:52:34.720]   which I think has fundamentally transformed
[01:52:34.720 --> 01:52:36.640]   how we interact with one another,
[01:52:36.640 --> 01:52:39.720]   and how we see ourselves and each other.
[01:52:39.720 --> 01:52:42.520]   And this is particularly true for young people
[01:52:42.520 --> 01:52:44.800]   who are growing up as digital natives.
[01:52:44.800 --> 01:52:46.680]   But what has happened there, I worry,
[01:52:46.680 --> 01:52:49.720]   is that, and it is thought that social media is all bad,
[01:52:49.720 --> 01:52:50.680]   just to be clear.
[01:52:50.680 --> 01:52:52.120]   Technology, look, I'm a believer
[01:52:52.120 --> 01:52:55.480]   that in technology, broadly speaking,
[01:52:55.480 --> 01:52:56.420]   a user of technology.
[01:52:56.420 --> 01:52:57.920]   I spent seven years building a tech company.
[01:52:57.920 --> 01:52:59.420]   I'm a believer in tech.
[01:52:59.420 --> 01:53:02.360]   But I think whether technology helps or hurts us
[01:53:02.360 --> 01:53:03.820]   is about how it's designed,
[01:53:03.820 --> 01:53:05.900]   and ultimately about how it ends up being used.
[01:53:05.900 --> 01:53:08.120]   And what we've seen with social media as well
[01:53:08.120 --> 01:53:10.480]   is that for many people,
[01:53:10.480 --> 01:53:13.860]   it ended up leading to in-person connections
[01:53:13.860 --> 01:53:17.160]   being replaced with online connections.
[01:53:17.160 --> 01:53:21.780]   We came to somehow value and almost seek out
[01:53:21.780 --> 01:53:24.660]   more and more followers and friends on social media,
[01:53:24.660 --> 01:53:27.680]   feeling somehow that made us more connected.
[01:53:27.680 --> 01:53:29.920]   But the nature of dialogue also changed.
[01:53:29.920 --> 01:53:32.640]   Like as human beings, we evolved over thousands of years
[01:53:32.640 --> 01:53:35.300]   to not just understand the words someone is saying,
[01:53:35.300 --> 01:53:37.120]   but to hear the tone of their voice,
[01:53:37.120 --> 01:53:38.520]   to see their facial expression.
[01:53:38.520 --> 01:53:40.080]   Like you and I are sitting across,
[01:53:40.080 --> 01:53:42.820]   and we're both processing our body language, right?
[01:53:42.820 --> 01:53:44.460]   And I'm seeing you nod your head,
[01:53:44.460 --> 01:53:45.960]   and I'm seeing your eyes focus.
[01:53:45.960 --> 01:53:48.880]   Like all of that matters to how we communicate.
[01:53:48.880 --> 01:53:52.000]   But also, like you and I are less likely
[01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.560]   to say something hurtful right now to one another
[01:53:54.560 --> 01:53:56.020]   because we can see each other.
[01:53:56.020 --> 01:53:57.420]   If I said something hurtful to you,
[01:53:57.420 --> 01:54:01.160]   like I'd probably see the pain or consternation on your face,
[01:54:01.160 --> 01:54:03.100]   and that might give me pause, right?
[01:54:03.100 --> 01:54:05.560]   When you're communicating online with other people
[01:54:05.560 --> 01:54:07.900]   without any of that information
[01:54:07.900 --> 01:54:11.140]   or without any of the sort of barriers, if you will,
[01:54:11.140 --> 01:54:13.180]   that make you pause before you hurt someone,
[01:54:13.180 --> 01:54:15.700]   it leads to a very different kind of communication,
[01:54:15.700 --> 01:54:18.680]   one that can be quite hurtful at times.
[01:54:18.680 --> 01:54:22.240]   And I also think that one thing many people don't recognize
[01:54:22.240 --> 01:54:24.440]   is that to communicate with somebody else
[01:54:24.440 --> 01:54:26.800]   and reach out and build a relationship with someone,
[01:54:26.800 --> 01:54:28.840]   it actually takes a certain amount of self-esteem
[01:54:28.840 --> 01:54:29.680]   to do that.
[01:54:29.680 --> 01:54:31.580]   You have to believe the other person's
[01:54:31.580 --> 01:54:33.020]   gonna wanna hang out with you.
[01:54:33.020 --> 01:54:35.540]   They're gonna see something valuable in you.
[01:54:35.540 --> 01:54:38.040]   And for many young people, what has happened,
[01:54:38.040 --> 01:54:40.160]   and I think frankly for many older people too,
[01:54:40.160 --> 01:54:41.580]   is their experience on social media
[01:54:41.580 --> 01:54:43.540]   has shredded their self-esteem
[01:54:43.540 --> 01:54:46.820]   as they're constantly comparing themselves to other people.
[01:54:46.820 --> 01:54:50.100]   Like when you and I were growing up in the '80s,
[01:54:50.100 --> 01:54:52.620]   we compared ourselves to other people too, right?
[01:54:52.620 --> 01:54:54.180]   People have for millennia.
[01:54:54.180 --> 01:54:56.120]   But what's fundamentally different now
[01:54:56.120 --> 01:54:58.840]   is that in a given day, you can compare yourself
[01:54:58.840 --> 01:55:01.240]   to thousands of images that you see online.
[01:55:01.240 --> 01:55:03.500]   That's actually literally what young people tell me.
[01:55:03.500 --> 01:55:05.340]   I do roundtables with college students
[01:55:05.340 --> 01:55:07.660]   and high school students all the time around the country.
[01:55:07.660 --> 01:55:09.700]   And the three things they tell me most consistently
[01:55:09.700 --> 01:55:11.200]   about their experience with social media
[01:55:11.200 --> 01:55:13.440]   is it makes them feel worse about themselves,
[01:55:13.440 --> 01:55:16.320]   worse about their friendships, but they can't get off it
[01:55:16.320 --> 01:55:17.580]   because the platforms are designed
[01:55:17.580 --> 01:55:19.860]   to maximize the amount of time they spend on them.
[01:55:19.860 --> 01:55:21.840]   So you put all of this together.
[01:55:21.840 --> 01:55:25.960]   And I think what has happened is that we're talking more,
[01:55:25.960 --> 01:55:28.240]   but we understand each other less.
[01:55:28.240 --> 01:55:30.360]   We have a lot of information,
[01:55:30.360 --> 01:55:32.920]   but we're lacking in the wisdom
[01:55:32.920 --> 01:55:36.320]   that comes from human relationships.
[01:55:36.320 --> 01:55:38.080]   And I think that that's really hurt us.
[01:55:38.080 --> 01:55:40.520]   We see it certainly in the data that tells us
[01:55:40.520 --> 01:55:42.960]   about mental and physical health outcomes,
[01:55:42.960 --> 01:55:45.840]   but there's also the human suffering component, Andrew.
[01:55:45.840 --> 01:55:49.400]   It's really heartbreaking for me to travel around the country
[01:55:49.400 --> 01:55:53.680]   to hear from people of all ages, often in quiet whispers,
[01:55:53.680 --> 01:55:56.080]   about their struggles with isolation,
[01:55:56.080 --> 01:55:58.680]   about how they feel like they just don't matter at all,
[01:55:58.680 --> 01:56:00.740]   about how they feel like they just don't have a place
[01:56:00.740 --> 01:56:01.920]   where they belong.
[01:56:01.920 --> 01:56:06.920]   And these are people on the outside look perfectly fine.
[01:56:06.920 --> 01:56:10.160]   They're posting happy things online to the folks at work.
[01:56:10.160 --> 01:56:12.520]   They're seeming like everything's going great.
[01:56:12.520 --> 01:56:14.080]   This is what I always tell people.
[01:56:14.080 --> 01:56:16.060]   Loneliness is a great masquerader.
[01:56:16.060 --> 01:56:17.880]   It can look like withdrawal and sadness.
[01:56:17.880 --> 01:56:20.120]   It can look like anger and irritability.
[01:56:20.120 --> 01:56:22.400]   It can look like aloofness as well.
[01:56:22.400 --> 01:56:26.280]   And so it's only when we stop to ask someone
[01:56:26.280 --> 01:56:28.320]   how they're doing, when we take pause for a moment
[01:56:28.320 --> 01:56:30.840]   to maybe reflect on what's happening in their life,
[01:56:30.840 --> 01:56:33.360]   that we realize that, wow, the majority of people
[01:56:33.360 --> 01:56:36.120]   in our country are actually struggling with loneliness.
[01:56:36.120 --> 01:56:39.920]   - Yeah, I'm a firm believer that our nervous system evolved
[01:56:39.920 --> 01:56:43.680]   under conditions of close interpersonal
[01:56:43.680 --> 01:56:45.820]   and direct connection.
[01:56:45.820 --> 01:56:49.720]   And to suddenly throw a technology in front of ourselves
[01:56:49.720 --> 01:56:53.020]   that deprives our nervous system of its normal development
[01:56:53.020 --> 01:56:55.180]   is clearly gonna lead bad places.
[01:56:55.180 --> 01:56:58.440]   It's also clear to me, based on what you just described,
[01:56:58.440 --> 01:57:01.120]   that when we go on social media, we see something,
[01:57:01.120 --> 01:57:02.840]   but they don't really see us.
[01:57:02.840 --> 01:57:06.700]   Hence perhaps why people get aggressive
[01:57:06.700 --> 01:57:08.040]   in the comment section.
[01:57:08.040 --> 01:57:11.080]   They wanna be heard.
[01:57:11.080 --> 01:57:11.940]   We wanna be seen.
[01:57:11.940 --> 01:57:15.560]   I think all of us wanna be seen and see other people.
[01:57:15.560 --> 01:57:19.160]   And social media doesn't allow for it so easily.
[01:57:19.160 --> 01:57:21.380]   I also know that a lot of young people
[01:57:21.380 --> 01:57:23.200]   will congregate with their friends
[01:57:23.200 --> 01:57:25.540]   to play video games online, but that's different.
[01:57:25.540 --> 01:57:28.280]   You're essentially showing up as an avatar.
[01:57:28.280 --> 01:57:31.920]   And when we were kids, we also played different characters
[01:57:31.920 --> 01:57:36.420]   in our games, but oh so different now.
[01:57:36.420 --> 01:57:39.080]   Do you think that there will be a youth rebellion movement
[01:57:39.080 --> 01:57:42.560]   against these kinds of technologies?
[01:57:42.560 --> 01:57:45.560]   I mean, there's a long history of young people rebelling
[01:57:45.560 --> 01:57:48.000]   against the stuff that's been put in front of them.
[01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:49.240]   And they're like, "Nope, no more.
[01:57:49.240 --> 01:57:50.120]   "We're gonna rebel."
[01:57:50.120 --> 01:57:52.320]   In fact, that was the way that youth overcame
[01:57:52.320 --> 01:57:56.840]   the nicotine epidemic, if you recall.
[01:57:56.840 --> 01:58:01.120]   It was the advertising pitting them against
[01:58:01.120 --> 01:58:07.160]   wealthy, cackling older men in rooms counting their money.
[01:58:07.160 --> 01:58:09.280]   That was what actually was successful
[01:58:09.280 --> 01:58:10.500]   in getting kids to not smoke,
[01:58:10.500 --> 01:58:12.920]   because kids have a rebellious streak,
[01:58:12.920 --> 01:58:13.800]   as opposed to when they were told,
[01:58:13.800 --> 01:58:15.060]   "Hey, smoking's terrible for you.
[01:58:15.060 --> 01:58:17.840]   "Your lungs are gonna fill with cancer."
[01:58:17.840 --> 01:58:19.120]   Kids didn't stop smoking.
[01:58:19.120 --> 01:58:20.980]   Teens didn't stop smoking.
[01:58:20.980 --> 01:58:24.700]   Rebellion has been baked into our nervous system
[01:58:24.700 --> 01:58:26.460]   in the adolescent and teen years.
[01:58:26.460 --> 01:58:30.680]   So do you see a rebellion against this social isolation?
[01:58:30.680 --> 01:58:32.260]   Are kids gonna start putting away their phones
[01:58:32.260 --> 01:58:35.060]   and hanging out together again, and that's gonna rescue us?
[01:58:35.060 --> 01:58:38.220]   And that's a way of saying, what can we do for them?
[01:58:38.220 --> 01:58:40.120]   What can they do for themselves?
[01:58:40.120 --> 01:58:41.180]   And what can we do as adults?
[01:58:41.180 --> 01:58:43.420]   'Cause there are a lot of, the silent suffering
[01:58:43.420 --> 01:58:45.920]   is the thing I also really worry about.
[01:58:45.920 --> 01:58:49.360]   - So it's a good question, and I think there is already
[01:58:49.360 --> 01:58:52.140]   a movement that's building among young people
[01:58:52.140 --> 01:58:57.140]   to create distance between themselves and their devices,
[01:58:57.140 --> 01:58:59.560]   and particularly social media.
[01:58:59.560 --> 01:59:02.300]   And it's cropping up in different ways.
[01:59:02.300 --> 01:59:03.980]   I'm meeting more and more.
[01:59:03.980 --> 01:59:05.560]   Some of these are organized efforts,
[01:59:05.560 --> 01:59:08.400]   but I'm also meeting more families,
[01:59:08.400 --> 01:59:10.540]   where the parents that gets together have decided
[01:59:10.540 --> 01:59:12.980]   that they're gonna delay using social media,
[01:59:12.980 --> 01:59:15.780]   and they'll pass middle school, or in some cases,
[01:59:15.780 --> 01:59:18.060]   even later, or where they're deciding
[01:59:18.060 --> 01:59:21.140]   that they're gonna draw boundaries around social media use,
[01:59:21.140 --> 01:59:22.880]   where they're gonna replace their smartphone
[01:59:22.880 --> 01:59:25.780]   with a dumb phone that allows them to do things like text
[01:59:25.780 --> 01:59:29.100]   and make phone calls and use maps and all that stuff,
[01:59:29.100 --> 01:59:31.160]   but doesn't necessarily have social media apps on it.
[01:59:31.160 --> 01:59:32.920]   That this is still a small minority.
[01:59:32.920 --> 01:59:35.800]   And we're dealing with a bit of a network effect here,
[01:59:35.800 --> 01:59:39.120]   because if you're the only one who's not on social media
[01:59:39.120 --> 01:59:41.680]   in your middle school class, then you might feel left out,
[01:59:41.680 --> 01:59:43.860]   which is why it's so important for parents
[01:59:43.860 --> 01:59:46.340]   and kids to actually do this together.
[01:59:46.340 --> 01:59:49.960]   But I do think that, to use your analogy with smoking,
[01:59:49.960 --> 01:59:53.080]   that one thing that I think many young people
[01:59:53.080 --> 01:59:58.080]   bristle against is this notion of being manipulated
[01:59:58.080 --> 02:00:02.900]   and used for the profit of a social media platform.
[02:00:03.760 --> 02:00:06.880]   And the reality is that, again, we've talked about
[02:00:06.880 --> 02:00:09.560]   how the fundamental business model is,
[02:00:09.560 --> 02:00:11.280]   or most social media platforms is built
[02:00:11.280 --> 02:00:13.960]   on how much time you spend on those platforms.
[02:00:13.960 --> 02:00:15.280]   That translates to ad revenue,
[02:00:15.280 --> 02:00:17.640]   and that translates to the bottom line.
[02:00:17.640 --> 02:00:19.680]   Whereas what I care about as a parent,
[02:00:19.680 --> 02:00:22.860]   as a surgeon general, is about how well
[02:00:22.860 --> 02:00:24.280]   that time is being spent.
[02:00:24.280 --> 02:00:26.740]   Is it actually contributing to the health and wellbeing
[02:00:26.740 --> 02:00:28.480]   of a young person, or is it not?
[02:00:28.480 --> 02:00:30.340]   Is it actually harming them?
[02:00:30.340 --> 02:00:32.240]   And this is where I think, when I go out
[02:00:32.240 --> 02:00:33.480]   and talk to young people about this,
[02:00:33.480 --> 02:00:35.460]   number one, I'm so impressed by a lot of young people,
[02:00:35.460 --> 02:00:37.280]   'cause they already have a lot of these insights.
[02:00:37.280 --> 02:00:38.760]   They're the ones living it, right?
[02:00:38.760 --> 02:00:41.440]   They're not thinking that this is all perfect
[02:00:41.440 --> 02:00:43.740]   and it's all a pure benefit here.
[02:00:43.740 --> 02:00:46.120]   They're the ones telling me that it makes them feel worse
[02:00:46.120 --> 02:00:48.600]   about themselves and their friendships.
[02:00:48.600 --> 02:00:50.680]   But they're also having a hard time getting off of it,
[02:00:50.680 --> 02:00:52.680]   because, again, of how these platforms are designed.
[02:00:52.680 --> 02:00:54.240]   So about a third of adolescents are saying
[02:00:54.240 --> 02:00:57.400]   that they're staying up 'til midnight or later on weeknights
[02:00:57.400 --> 02:01:00.000]   using their devices, and a lot of that is social media use.
[02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.440]   And this takes away from sleep, which we know,
[02:01:02.440 --> 02:01:03.960]   and you know better than anyone,
[02:01:03.960 --> 02:01:05.880]   is so critical to the mental health and wellbeing
[02:01:05.880 --> 02:01:07.840]   of all of us, but of young people in particular
[02:01:07.840 --> 02:01:11.040]   who are at a critical phase of development.
[02:01:11.040 --> 02:01:12.880]   The other thing that is very concerning to me
[02:01:12.880 --> 02:01:16.300]   is nearly half of adolescents say that using social media
[02:01:16.300 --> 02:01:19.340]   has made them feel worse about their body image,
[02:01:19.340 --> 02:01:22.080]   as they're constantly comparing themselves to others online.
[02:01:22.080 --> 02:01:24.000]   And we used to think, oh, this is just girls
[02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:24.840]   who are experiencing this.
[02:01:24.840 --> 02:01:27.360]   And yes, it is a lot of young girls
[02:01:27.360 --> 02:01:28.840]   who are experiencing these body image issues,
[02:01:28.840 --> 02:01:31.180]   but now it's increasingly boys as well.
[02:01:31.180 --> 02:01:34.120]   So this is happening across the board.
[02:01:34.120 --> 02:01:35.860]   But the other piece I think that concerns me
[02:01:35.860 --> 02:01:37.560]   thinking about mental health symptoms
[02:01:37.560 --> 02:01:40.540]   is that when you look at how much time
[02:01:40.540 --> 02:01:42.760]   kids are using social media, on average,
[02:01:42.760 --> 02:01:45.240]   adolescents are using it for three and a half hours a day,
[02:01:45.240 --> 02:01:47.540]   on average, so many-- - Just social media.
[02:01:47.540 --> 02:01:48.380]   - Just social media.
[02:01:48.380 --> 02:01:51.560]   And that means many are using it for far more than that.
[02:01:51.560 --> 02:01:52.720]   And what you're finding, though,
[02:01:52.720 --> 02:01:57.060]   is that for adolescents who use it three hours or more
[02:01:57.060 --> 02:01:59.600]   in a given day, their risk of anxiety
[02:01:59.600 --> 02:02:01.200]   or depression symptoms double.
[02:02:01.200 --> 02:02:04.240]   And if the average uses three and a half days,
[02:02:04.240 --> 02:02:07.100]   that means that millions of kids all across our country,
[02:02:07.100 --> 02:02:09.100]   the majority of our kids, are at risk here.
[02:02:09.100 --> 02:02:12.080]   And so you put all this together,
[02:02:12.080 --> 02:02:14.300]   and it paints a very concerning picture.
[02:02:14.300 --> 02:02:17.100]   Whatever benefits there may be for some kids
[02:02:17.100 --> 02:02:18.580]   of using social media, and there's some,
[02:02:18.580 --> 02:02:21.240]   and we lay out some of this in our advisory on social media,
[02:02:21.240 --> 02:02:23.000]   some kids find social media's a great way
[02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:24.960]   to express themselves, to reach other people,
[02:02:24.960 --> 02:02:27.740]   to find support, especially if they're from a community
[02:02:27.740 --> 02:02:30.700]   that doesn't have a lot of folks who are like them around.
[02:02:30.700 --> 02:02:33.600]   It can be really reassuring to connect with others.
[02:02:33.600 --> 02:02:37.160]   But we can't say that just to get those benefits,
[02:02:37.160 --> 02:02:38.620]   we have to subject our children
[02:02:38.620 --> 02:02:40.900]   to all of these other harms, right?
[02:02:40.900 --> 02:02:44.280]   Kids are experiencing exposure to harmful content,
[02:02:44.280 --> 02:02:45.820]   to harassment and bullying online.
[02:02:45.820 --> 02:02:48.260]   Six out of 10 adolescent girls are saying
[02:02:48.260 --> 02:02:50.380]   they've been approached by strangers on social media
[02:02:50.380 --> 02:02:53.100]   in ways that made them feel very uncomfortable.
[02:02:53.100 --> 02:02:57.060]   Our kids are also finding that health-promoting activities
[02:02:57.060 --> 02:02:59.020]   in their lives are being cannibalized
[02:02:59.020 --> 02:03:00.380]   by their use of social media,
[02:03:00.380 --> 02:03:02.300]   that it's detracting from time for sleep,
[02:03:02.300 --> 02:03:05.020]   in-person interaction, physical activity.
[02:03:05.020 --> 02:03:07.460]   And the erosion of self-esteem really concerns me as well,
[02:03:07.460 --> 02:03:10.600]   because you need that not just for social interaction,
[02:03:10.600 --> 02:03:14.460]   but look, as a father, I want my children to grow up
[02:03:14.460 --> 02:03:16.420]   being confident about who they are,
[02:03:16.420 --> 02:03:18.580]   being confident enough to be authentic
[02:03:18.580 --> 02:03:19.660]   as they show up in the world,
[02:03:19.660 --> 02:03:21.900]   to not feel like they need to create some brand
[02:03:21.900 --> 02:03:23.720]   that's different from who they fundamentally are
[02:03:23.720 --> 02:03:25.540]   just to sell that to the world.
[02:03:25.540 --> 02:03:27.240]   I want them to know who they are
[02:03:27.240 --> 02:03:29.300]   and to be comfortable being who they are
[02:03:29.300 --> 02:03:32.260]   and to encourage other people to do the same,
[02:03:32.260 --> 02:03:34.260]   to support them in their efforts to be authentic.
[02:03:34.260 --> 02:03:36.020]   That's what I want my kids to do.
[02:03:36.020 --> 02:03:37.100]   That's not what's happening
[02:03:37.100 --> 02:03:38.620]   to a lot of kids on social media.
[02:03:38.620 --> 02:03:42.300]   So I think we not only need more kids to understand this
[02:03:42.300 --> 02:03:46.060]   and to support them in their efforts to create space
[02:03:46.060 --> 02:03:47.820]   and sacred spaces away from social media,
[02:03:47.820 --> 02:03:49.780]   but we need to support parents here too.
[02:03:49.780 --> 02:03:52.140]   'Cause Andrew, my big concern with parents is,
[02:03:52.140 --> 02:03:56.080]   look, we've taken this technology, which is rapidly evolving,
[02:03:56.080 --> 02:04:00.380]   which we didn't grow up with as kids,
[02:04:00.380 --> 02:04:03.800]   and we've told parents, you manage it all on your own.
[02:04:03.800 --> 02:04:06.740]   We put the entire burden on parents and kids to manage this.
[02:04:06.740 --> 02:04:08.740]   When we were growing up,
[02:04:08.740 --> 02:04:10.460]   you remember that motor vehicle fatalities
[02:04:10.460 --> 02:04:12.360]   were really high in America.
[02:04:12.360 --> 02:04:15.940]   And we didn't say, okay, you know what?
[02:04:15.940 --> 02:04:18.900]   That's just the price of modern life.
[02:04:18.900 --> 02:04:20.360]   We just have to accept it
[02:04:20.360 --> 02:04:21.740]   and keep moving on with our lives.
[02:04:21.740 --> 02:04:22.980]   We said, hold on.
[02:04:22.980 --> 02:04:24.740]   We don't have to go back to horses and buggies,
[02:04:24.740 --> 02:04:26.640]   but we also don't need to accept this death rate.
[02:04:26.640 --> 02:04:29.020]   We need to make this experience safer.
[02:04:29.020 --> 02:04:30.660]   And so we put in place,
[02:04:30.660 --> 02:04:33.420]   with the advocacy and support of incredible groups
[02:04:33.420 --> 02:04:35.460]   like MADD and others across the country,
[02:04:35.460 --> 02:04:37.900]   MADD mean Mothers Against Drunk Driving,
[02:04:37.900 --> 02:04:41.100]   ultimately the government put in place safety standards
[02:04:41.100 --> 02:04:44.980]   that got us seat belts, airbags, crash testing
[02:04:44.980 --> 02:04:47.460]   to make sure the frame of cars were robust
[02:04:47.460 --> 02:04:48.500]   in the setting of an accident.
[02:04:48.500 --> 02:04:50.960]   And that helped us reduce motor vehicle accidents
[02:04:50.960 --> 02:04:52.100]   and deaths.
[02:04:52.100 --> 02:04:53.460]   And that's what we need here too.
[02:04:53.460 --> 02:04:57.020]   Like we need to have the backs of parents and kids.
[02:04:57.020 --> 02:05:00.020]   And that means from a policy perspective,
[02:05:00.020 --> 02:05:02.560]   putting in place safety standards to protect kids
[02:05:02.560 --> 02:05:04.100]   from exposure to harmful content,
[02:05:04.100 --> 02:05:06.940]   from the experience of bullying and harassment,
[02:05:06.940 --> 02:05:09.460]   and that also protect them from features
[02:05:09.460 --> 02:05:12.260]   that would seek to manipulate them into excessive use,
[02:05:12.260 --> 02:05:14.580]   which is happening far too often right now.
[02:05:14.580 --> 02:05:17.960]   We also need a policy that requires data transparency
[02:05:17.960 --> 02:05:19.000]   from the companies.
[02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:21.820]   You know, researchers tell us all the time
[02:05:21.820 --> 02:05:24.220]   that these are independent researchers.
[02:05:24.220 --> 02:05:25.480]   They tell us they are having a hard time
[02:05:25.480 --> 02:05:27.060]   getting full access to the data
[02:05:27.060 --> 02:05:28.540]   from the social media platforms
[02:05:28.540 --> 02:05:31.420]   about the full impact of the platforms
[02:05:31.420 --> 02:05:32.920]   on the mental health of kids.
[02:05:32.920 --> 02:05:34.460]   As a parent, look, I don't,
[02:05:34.460 --> 02:05:36.320]   when we bought car seats for my children,
[02:05:36.320 --> 02:05:39.940]   when they were born, we looked up the safety data.
[02:05:39.940 --> 02:05:41.780]   Like many parents, we wanted to make sure
[02:05:41.780 --> 02:05:43.500]   the car seats were safe.
[02:05:43.500 --> 02:05:45.060]   But if you had told me that, hey, you know,
[02:05:45.060 --> 02:05:46.500]   the manufacturers of these car seats
[02:05:46.500 --> 02:05:49.160]   are actually not disclosing some of the data
[02:05:49.160 --> 02:05:51.080]   on the impact on children,
[02:05:51.080 --> 02:05:52.280]   but go ahead and buy it anyway.
[02:05:52.280 --> 02:05:54.360]   You know, I'm sure other people are buying these car seats.
[02:05:54.360 --> 02:05:55.320]   You should be fine.
[02:05:55.320 --> 02:05:57.100]   I would have been very disturbed by that, right?
[02:05:57.100 --> 02:05:58.640]   No parent wants to feel that information
[02:05:58.640 --> 02:05:59.800]   is being hidden from them
[02:05:59.800 --> 02:06:02.720]   about the health impact of products on their kids.
[02:06:02.720 --> 02:06:03.760]   That's what we have right now.
[02:06:03.760 --> 02:06:05.920]   So this is a place where I think,
[02:06:05.920 --> 02:06:08.560]   while, yes, and we'll talk about some steps
[02:06:08.560 --> 02:06:10.920]   parents can take, 'cause I wanna get to practical steps
[02:06:10.920 --> 02:06:12.580]   that people who are here as parents
[02:06:12.580 --> 02:06:15.360]   or people with kids in their lives can take,
[02:06:15.360 --> 02:06:18.860]   but we need policymakers to step up
[02:06:18.860 --> 02:06:22.000]   and step into the void here and to fill the gap,
[02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:24.220]   because this is too much, again,
[02:06:24.220 --> 02:06:27.100]   to just ask parents to manage entirely on their own.
[02:06:27.100 --> 02:06:29.220]   And this isn't, again, about telling parents what to do
[02:06:29.220 --> 02:06:30.720]   and restricting them.
[02:06:30.720 --> 02:06:32.580]   This is about giving them the support they need
[02:06:32.580 --> 02:06:35.900]   so they have confidence when they see, you know,
[02:06:35.900 --> 02:06:38.300]   a technology out there, a device out there,
[02:06:38.300 --> 02:06:40.120]   a product out there for kids
[02:06:40.120 --> 02:06:43.200]   that they know it's been tested, that it's been studied,
[02:06:43.200 --> 02:06:45.640]   and that it's actually safe for their children.
[02:06:45.640 --> 02:06:48.260]   - My understanding is that in countries like China,
[02:06:48.260 --> 02:06:50.600]   there are limits as to how many hours
[02:06:50.600 --> 02:06:53.440]   kids can be on screens, period.
[02:06:53.440 --> 02:06:55.320]   And when I was a kid, we were allowed to watch TV
[02:06:55.320 --> 02:06:56.680]   for a certain number of,
[02:06:56.680 --> 02:06:58.280]   I think it was a half an hour or an hour.
[02:06:58.280 --> 02:07:00.440]   My mom was constantly kicking us out of the house.
[02:07:00.440 --> 02:07:02.080]   Like, literally, you gotta leave the house.
[02:07:02.080 --> 02:07:03.720]   You gotta go down the street and play.
[02:07:03.720 --> 02:07:06.540]   Unfortunately, I liked outdoor activities.
[02:07:06.540 --> 02:07:07.940]   Nowadays, we also have the issue
[02:07:07.940 --> 02:07:10.240]   that a lot of parents are on their phones
[02:07:10.240 --> 02:07:11.960]   at soccer games and at kids' events,
[02:07:11.960 --> 02:07:14.520]   and so the kids are modeling their parents.
[02:07:14.520 --> 02:07:16.160]   Parents are distracted as well,
[02:07:16.160 --> 02:07:18.740]   so there's a lack of social connection,
[02:07:18.740 --> 02:07:20.500]   people even in immediate family.
[02:07:20.500 --> 02:07:23.620]   People are screened in, you know, the TV.
[02:07:23.620 --> 02:07:26.320]   There's laptops, there's multiple phones, iPads.
[02:07:26.320 --> 02:07:29.480]   People are more engaged in the screen portals
[02:07:29.480 --> 02:07:32.660]   than often than their own portals.
[02:07:32.660 --> 02:07:35.440]   You go to a concert, and people are watching the concert
[02:07:35.440 --> 02:07:37.760]   through their screens so that they can send the same image
[02:07:37.760 --> 02:07:40.740]   that everyone around them is sending out to the world.
[02:07:40.740 --> 02:07:43.520]   If you think about it, it's kind of crazy,
[02:07:43.520 --> 02:07:46.680]   but I guess they wanna capture that unique experience,
[02:07:46.680 --> 02:07:48.540]   but it's not unique at all.
[02:07:48.540 --> 02:07:51.040]   That's the myth, that's the illusion.
[02:07:51.040 --> 02:07:53.300]   There's nothing unique about your post
[02:07:53.300 --> 02:07:54.580]   of something that you went to go see.
[02:07:54.580 --> 02:07:56.720]   What would be truly unique is to just experience that
[02:07:56.720 --> 02:07:58.360]   in real time, right?
[02:07:58.360 --> 02:08:00.860]   It's so wild to think about what we think of
[02:08:00.860 --> 02:08:04.260]   as our unique portal is actually not unique at all.
[02:08:04.260 --> 02:08:06.120]   It's what we do with it.
[02:08:06.120 --> 02:08:09.360]   My stance is glean and learn information online,
[02:08:09.360 --> 02:08:11.160]   and go use it in real life.
[02:08:11.160 --> 02:08:13.480]   Come back from time to time, you know,
[02:08:13.480 --> 02:08:15.760]   maybe an hour a day maximum or so.
[02:08:15.760 --> 02:08:18.860]   - Can I just underscore the two words you said, real life?
[02:08:18.860 --> 02:08:21.280]   'Cause that, I think, is a really important key here,
[02:08:21.280 --> 02:08:24.680]   which is that all of real life isn't happening
[02:08:24.680 --> 02:08:25.700]   on social media.
[02:08:25.700 --> 02:08:28.140]   There's a whole world out there, which I think is real life,
[02:08:28.140 --> 02:08:29.180]   which is happening offline.
[02:08:29.180 --> 02:08:32.960]   And what's happening online too often is distorted, right?
[02:08:32.960 --> 02:08:37.960]   It's giving us, like, even just take the images
[02:08:37.960 --> 02:08:41.040]   that we see of people, their, you know,
[02:08:41.040 --> 02:08:43.280]   their summer beach images, their, like,
[02:08:43.280 --> 02:08:45.120]   great vacation images.
[02:08:45.120 --> 02:08:47.240]   That's not representative of their entire life,
[02:08:47.240 --> 02:08:49.340]   of how they're living their life, but we see that.
[02:08:49.340 --> 02:08:51.460]   We see people's anger and their vitriol,
[02:08:51.460 --> 02:08:53.480]   and we come to believe over time
[02:08:53.480 --> 02:08:55.080]   that that's how people feel.
[02:08:55.080 --> 02:08:56.540]   That's what people are dealing with
[02:08:56.540 --> 02:08:57.560]   and experiencing in their life.
[02:08:57.560 --> 02:09:00.800]   And we've just got to get, you know, your mom,
[02:09:00.800 --> 02:09:04.200]   I love what your mom did of getting you guys outside.
[02:09:04.200 --> 02:09:06.420]   My parents did the same thing too.
[02:09:06.420 --> 02:09:09.100]   Like, I was very blessed to have two parents
[02:09:09.100 --> 02:09:10.300]   who didn't come, you know,
[02:09:10.300 --> 02:09:11.840]   they didn't have a lot of resources growing up.
[02:09:11.840 --> 02:09:14.260]   They didn't come to this country with a lot of resources.
[02:09:14.260 --> 02:09:17.140]   But one of the greatest gifts they gave us
[02:09:17.140 --> 02:09:19.440]   is that they loved us unconditionally.
[02:09:19.440 --> 02:09:21.820]   The other great gift that they gave us is they pushed us
[02:09:21.820 --> 02:09:25.660]   to just explore, to meet people, to learn about the world.
[02:09:25.660 --> 02:09:29.580]   They wanted us outside, playing, you know, experimenting,
[02:09:29.580 --> 02:09:32.800]   just discovering the world, you know,
[02:09:32.800 --> 02:09:34.940]   riding our bike around the neighborhood.
[02:09:34.940 --> 02:09:36.020]   And that's what we did.
[02:09:36.020 --> 02:09:39.020]   But right now, two critical things that kids need
[02:09:39.020 --> 02:09:41.100]   for their mental health and development
[02:09:41.100 --> 02:09:42.860]   are two important forces, I should say,
[02:09:42.860 --> 02:09:45.100]   that are impacting their mental health and development.
[02:09:45.100 --> 02:09:46.900]   One is social media, but the second also
[02:09:46.900 --> 02:09:49.980]   is the lack of unstructured playtime that kids have.
[02:09:49.980 --> 02:09:53.560]   Like, unstructured playtime is time when we, as kids,
[02:09:53.560 --> 02:09:55.900]   learn how to negotiate situations with other kids,
[02:09:55.900 --> 02:09:57.020]   how to resolve conflict,
[02:09:57.020 --> 02:10:00.660]   how to recognize what's going on in someone else's eyes
[02:10:00.660 --> 02:10:01.820]   before they say something.
[02:10:01.820 --> 02:10:04.260]   We learn how to collaborate and play with other kids.
[02:10:04.260 --> 02:10:07.820]   There's a lot you learn on the playground, as it turns out.
[02:10:07.820 --> 02:10:10.620]   But I worry that right now that we've almost somehow
[02:10:10.620 --> 02:10:13.580]   made that kind of unstructured time seem inefficient.
[02:10:13.580 --> 02:10:16.060]   You know, we've set these standards for our kids
[02:10:16.060 --> 02:10:19.100]   that they need to be, you know, getting fancy jobs
[02:10:19.100 --> 02:10:22.060]   and into fancy colleges and making X amount of money.
[02:10:22.060 --> 02:10:23.840]   And the path to doing that is, you know,
[02:10:23.840 --> 02:10:26.940]   to be enrolled in X number of activities after school
[02:10:26.940 --> 02:10:28.320]   and to do all this stuff in school.
[02:10:28.320 --> 02:10:30.300]   And their lives are so hyper-structured
[02:10:31.180 --> 02:10:34.660]   that I worry that the time to just play,
[02:10:34.660 --> 02:10:37.420]   to be creative, to reflect and think,
[02:10:37.420 --> 02:10:40.180]   to just have unstructured time with other kids
[02:10:40.180 --> 02:10:42.580]   has evaporated, and I think that that also
[02:10:42.580 --> 02:10:45.700]   is hurting the mental health and wellbeing of our children.
[02:10:45.700 --> 02:10:48.820]   - I love the idea that unstructured playtime
[02:10:48.820 --> 02:10:51.420]   could be framed in the accurate context
[02:10:51.420 --> 02:10:53.180]   of the nervous system developing
[02:10:53.180 --> 02:10:54.900]   the way it was supposed to develop.
[02:10:54.900 --> 02:10:58.580]   I mean, I would argue that success is going to be easiest
[02:10:58.580 --> 02:11:01.180]   for children that engage in the real world more.
[02:11:01.180 --> 02:11:03.120]   In fact, there's great risk to posting everything
[02:11:03.120 --> 02:11:04.480]   that you do online.
[02:11:04.480 --> 02:11:06.640]   We've seen some examples of that preventing people
[02:11:06.640 --> 02:11:09.300]   from getting into or staying in college
[02:11:09.300 --> 02:11:11.000]   based on things they said or did previously
[02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:13.260]   that they shouldn't have said or done.
[02:11:13.260 --> 02:11:16.440]   Those are kind of, you know, negative highlighted cases.
[02:11:16.440 --> 02:11:20.620]   But in general, we know that the nervous system thrives
[02:11:20.620 --> 02:11:22.480]   on diversity of types of interactions
[02:11:22.480 --> 02:11:24.080]   and social interactions in particular.
[02:11:24.080 --> 02:11:25.460]   I'm just restating what you just said.
[02:11:25.460 --> 02:11:28.180]   So if ever there was a call for kids to get out
[02:11:28.180 --> 02:11:31.220]   into non-screen life, let's call it,
[02:11:31.220 --> 02:11:34.700]   and engage their nervous system that way,
[02:11:34.700 --> 02:11:36.720]   without question is going to benefit them
[02:11:36.720 --> 02:11:40.340]   in terms of their ability to learn and retain information,
[02:11:40.340 --> 02:11:41.540]   perform well in school,
[02:11:41.540 --> 02:11:44.240]   which is not everything life's about, but let's face it,
[02:11:44.240 --> 02:11:48.260]   we still live in a society where hitting those milestones
[02:11:48.260 --> 02:11:50.820]   on a consistent basis is the best predictor
[02:11:50.820 --> 02:11:53.700]   of people being able to live self-sustained lives,
[02:11:53.700 --> 02:11:55.300]   build families, and that sort of thing.
[02:11:55.300 --> 02:12:00.000]   So you mentioned a few actionable items
[02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:02.340]   for parents as it relates to kids,
[02:12:02.340 --> 02:12:04.900]   well, not maybe, limits their screen time,
[02:12:04.900 --> 02:12:07.300]   force them outside in the safe weather
[02:12:07.300 --> 02:12:08.380]   and safe conditions, of course.
[02:12:08.380 --> 02:12:10.980]   But what about adults as well?
[02:12:10.980 --> 02:12:13.220]   I mean, what can we all do?
[02:12:13.220 --> 02:12:15.780]   Should we be restricting our screen time
[02:12:15.780 --> 02:12:18.700]   to X number of hours per day?
[02:12:18.700 --> 02:12:19.980]   I mean, you're the surgeon general.
[02:12:19.980 --> 02:12:22.960]   If you had a magic wand, which I realize you don't,
[02:12:24.180 --> 02:12:28.260]   and you could make a highly informed recommendation
[02:12:28.260 --> 02:12:32.020]   about what the thresholds for too much time
[02:12:32.020 --> 02:12:36.620]   on social media are, what would it be?
[02:12:36.620 --> 02:12:38.100]   Two hours, three hours?
[02:12:38.100 --> 02:12:40.220]   - Yeah, so it's a good question,
[02:12:40.220 --> 02:12:42.500]   and let me actually go through some of these things
[02:12:42.500 --> 02:12:44.380]   that parents can do for kids
[02:12:44.380 --> 02:12:46.120]   and that we can all do for ourselves.
[02:12:46.120 --> 02:12:47.820]   With kids in particular,
[02:12:47.820 --> 02:12:50.820]   what I would do specifically with social media is,
[02:12:50.820 --> 02:12:53.260]   and this is frankly what I'm planning to do
[02:12:53.260 --> 02:12:56.060]   with my wife for our kids as they grow up.
[02:12:56.060 --> 02:13:01.060]   Number one, I would seek to delay the use of social media
[02:13:01.060 --> 02:13:04.520]   past middle school at minimum.
[02:13:04.520 --> 02:13:06.680]   And I know that that is hard to do
[02:13:06.680 --> 02:13:08.700]   at a time when all kids are on social media
[02:13:08.700 --> 02:13:10.700]   and you don't want your child to be the only one left out
[02:13:10.700 --> 02:13:12.860]   and to be lonely as a result.
[02:13:12.860 --> 02:13:15.020]   - So that means no account of their own.
[02:13:15.020 --> 02:13:17.300]   - It means no account of their own.
[02:13:17.300 --> 02:13:21.480]   And I would make, to the best of your ability,
[02:13:21.480 --> 02:13:24.220]   see if there are other parents that you can partner with
[02:13:24.220 --> 02:13:26.900]   to do this, because it's hard to do alone as a parent,
[02:13:26.900 --> 02:13:28.220]   but it's also, if there are other parents
[02:13:28.220 --> 02:13:30.140]   you're partnering with, that means there are other kids
[02:13:30.140 --> 02:13:31.300]   who are also delaying use.
[02:13:31.300 --> 02:13:33.020]   That means your child is not alone.
[02:13:33.020 --> 02:13:34.940]   And I think if you start the conversation
[02:13:34.940 --> 02:13:36.940]   with other parents, you'll realize a lot of them
[02:13:36.940 --> 02:13:38.620]   are worried about the same things you are.
[02:13:38.620 --> 02:13:40.100]   They may have thought about delaying use,
[02:13:40.100 --> 02:13:42.020]   but they also don't want their kid to be the only one.
[02:13:42.020 --> 02:13:43.780]   So this becomes a numbers challenge,
[02:13:43.780 --> 02:13:45.300]   but partnership can help us.
[02:13:45.300 --> 02:13:47.460]   If your child's already on social media,
[02:13:47.460 --> 02:13:51.260]   what I'd recommend is to create sacred spaces
[02:13:51.260 --> 02:13:53.740]   in their lives that are technology free.
[02:13:53.740 --> 02:13:57.360]   And specifically I would think about the hour before bedtime
[02:13:57.360 --> 02:14:00.360]   and throughout the night as time that you want to protect,
[02:14:00.360 --> 02:14:03.080]   'cause kids are losing not just sleep
[02:14:03.080 --> 02:14:04.360]   because they're going to sleep later
[02:14:04.360 --> 02:14:05.940]   'cause they're on their devices,
[02:14:05.940 --> 02:14:07.840]   but they're also waking up in the middle of the night,
[02:14:07.840 --> 02:14:09.660]   maybe to use the bathroom, maybe to get some water,
[02:14:09.660 --> 02:14:11.560]   and then they get back on their devices again.
[02:14:11.560 --> 02:14:14.640]   So the quality of their sleep is being significantly
[02:14:14.640 --> 02:14:17.760]   impacted by access to those devices during the night.
[02:14:17.760 --> 02:14:20.200]   So I would protect that time, hour before bed,
[02:14:20.200 --> 02:14:21.420]   throughout the night.
[02:14:21.420 --> 02:14:26.280]   I would also make sure meal times were tech-free zones
[02:14:26.280 --> 02:14:28.600]   so that people actually, that you talk to one another,
[02:14:28.600 --> 02:14:31.320]   you see one another, and time with friends
[02:14:31.320 --> 02:14:34.200]   and family members when you're out at a birthday party,
[02:14:34.200 --> 02:14:36.080]   et cetera, make that tech-free time.
[02:14:36.080 --> 02:14:38.840]   Let them focus on their time with other people.
[02:14:38.840 --> 02:14:42.700]   Those three tech-free zones can do a world of good
[02:14:42.700 --> 02:14:44.040]   to help your child.
[02:14:44.040 --> 02:14:45.460]   And then the last thing I'd recommend here,
[02:14:45.460 --> 02:14:48.120]   the many things I think parents could do,
[02:14:48.120 --> 02:14:51.080]   is to start a dialogue with your child about their use
[02:14:51.080 --> 02:14:52.940]   of social media.
[02:14:52.940 --> 02:14:54.720]   We don't always know how social media
[02:14:54.720 --> 02:14:56.560]   is making our kids feel.
[02:14:56.560 --> 02:14:59.040]   From the, and we may realize when we talk to them
[02:14:59.040 --> 02:15:01.000]   that they actually have their own concerns.
[02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:03.500]   They might say, "Yeah, it's not making me feel really good,
[02:15:03.500 --> 02:15:05.040]   "but it's just like hard not to be on it.
[02:15:05.040 --> 02:15:07.560]   "Everyone's like texting on this, or everyone is,
[02:15:07.560 --> 02:15:10.440]   "everyone's sharing information and posting pictures on it.
[02:15:10.440 --> 02:15:12.180]   "I feel like I need to be on it."
[02:15:12.180 --> 02:15:14.880]   You can only help them start to manage that
[02:15:14.880 --> 02:15:16.800]   if you know that that's a challenge that they're having.
[02:15:16.800 --> 02:15:19.480]   So opening up a conversation so your child knows
[02:15:19.480 --> 02:15:21.120]   that you're not judging them,
[02:15:21.120 --> 02:15:22.720]   but you're trying to understand their experience
[02:15:22.720 --> 02:15:23.540]   is important.
[02:15:23.540 --> 02:15:25.160]   Also so that you can help them understand
[02:15:25.160 --> 02:15:27.300]   what is not acceptable for them to experience
[02:15:27.300 --> 02:15:28.140]   on social media.
[02:15:28.140 --> 02:15:31.360]   If they're being harassed or bullied by strangers,
[02:15:31.360 --> 02:15:32.360]   that is a problem.
[02:15:32.360 --> 02:15:36.280]   You want your child to tell you about that, to report that.
[02:15:36.280 --> 02:15:38.440]   If they see something posted online
[02:15:38.440 --> 02:15:39.600]   that's really concerning to them,
[02:15:39.600 --> 02:15:41.340]   let's say they see a friend post
[02:15:41.340 --> 02:15:42.880]   that they're thinking of taking their own life
[02:15:42.880 --> 02:15:45.400]   or harming themself in another way,
[02:15:45.400 --> 02:15:47.760]   you want them to know that that's important to flag
[02:15:47.760 --> 02:15:48.600]   and to get help,
[02:15:48.600 --> 02:15:51.240]   that they shouldn't just scroll past that.
[02:15:51.240 --> 02:15:52.960]   So that conversation is really important.
[02:15:52.960 --> 02:15:55.360]   And finally, as parents, we can lead by example.
[02:15:55.360 --> 02:15:56.440]   And this is hard,
[02:15:56.440 --> 02:15:59.160]   'cause the truth is we've been talking about social media
[02:15:59.160 --> 02:16:00.540]   in youth, and that's what the subject
[02:16:00.540 --> 02:16:02.600]   of my Surgeon General's advisory was on.
[02:16:02.600 --> 02:16:04.420]   But I have concerns about adults too.
[02:16:04.420 --> 02:16:07.440]   I see it as somebody who's had challenges in my own use
[02:16:07.440 --> 02:16:08.320]   of social media,
[02:16:08.320 --> 02:16:11.780]   finding sometimes it bleeds past my bedtime,
[02:16:11.780 --> 02:16:14.000]   and I realize, I think I'm gonna check something
[02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:16.080]   for five minutes, an hour later I'm still there,
[02:16:16.080 --> 02:16:18.280]   scrolling through something.
[02:16:18.280 --> 02:16:21.160]   And sometimes I find myself,
[02:16:21.160 --> 02:16:23.960]   over the years I find myself comparing myself also
[02:16:23.960 --> 02:16:26.480]   to posts I see online in unhealthy ways.
[02:16:26.480 --> 02:16:31.480]   Sometimes I find myself sort of pulled into content
[02:16:31.480 --> 02:16:34.320]   that ends up being angry and vitriolic
[02:16:34.320 --> 02:16:36.200]   and leaves me feeling worse at the end.
[02:16:36.200 --> 02:16:38.240]   So I've experienced this as well.
[02:16:38.240 --> 02:16:40.640]   And I think as parents, one of the hardest things to do
[02:16:40.640 --> 02:16:42.480]   is to follow this advice we're giving our kids,
[02:16:42.480 --> 02:16:44.200]   to draw those boundaries as well,
[02:16:44.200 --> 02:16:47.220]   and to put our devices away when we're around our kids.
[02:16:47.220 --> 02:16:50.440]   One experience I had which sort of I still feel bad about
[02:16:50.440 --> 02:16:52.800]   but which really helped kind of knock some sense into me
[02:16:52.800 --> 02:16:57.640]   was after my son was born, my older child,
[02:16:57.640 --> 02:16:59.680]   I was actually, I was Surgeon General at that time.
[02:16:59.680 --> 02:17:02.120]   I had a lot going on, it was a busy job, et cetera,
[02:17:02.120 --> 02:17:05.280]   but I wanted to make sure that I protected bedtimes
[02:17:05.280 --> 02:17:08.400]   and mealtimes for us to be together as a family.
[02:17:08.400 --> 02:17:10.640]   Yet one day when I came home after dinner
[02:17:10.640 --> 02:17:13.360]   when we were doing the bath time and bedtime routine
[02:17:13.360 --> 02:17:15.860]   and getting my son ready for the night,
[02:17:15.860 --> 02:17:20.120]   my wife was changing his diaper and instead of helping,
[02:17:20.120 --> 02:17:23.360]   I was just standing at the side scrolling through my inbox.
[02:17:23.360 --> 02:17:25.200]   And my wife, who has infinite patience
[02:17:25.200 --> 02:17:26.960]   and is like one of the most well-adjusted people
[02:17:26.960 --> 02:17:31.200]   that I know, just paused and she turned to me
[02:17:31.200 --> 02:17:33.880]   and Alice said, "Do you really need
[02:17:33.880 --> 02:17:35.320]   "to be doing that right now?"
[02:17:35.320 --> 02:17:38.820]   And she said it just very quietly,
[02:17:38.820 --> 02:17:42.500]   but I felt such a sense of shame when she did that
[02:17:42.500 --> 02:17:45.300]   'cause I was like, what am I doing?
[02:17:45.300 --> 02:17:49.300]   This is my infant child and the rare few hours
[02:17:49.300 --> 02:17:51.540]   I have with him during the day
[02:17:51.540 --> 02:17:54.540]   and I'm just scrolling through my inbox and my phone.
[02:17:54.540 --> 02:17:59.180]   This is terrible and look, I know that all of us do this
[02:17:59.180 --> 02:18:00.780]   and maybe in different contexts,
[02:18:00.780 --> 02:18:03.260]   but it was a wake-up moment for me
[02:18:03.260 --> 02:18:07.500]   'cause I realized one, as you know well as a neuroscientist,
[02:18:07.500 --> 02:18:11.700]   we can't really multitask, we're rapidly task switching
[02:18:11.700 --> 02:18:14.840]   and that was time when my head was in my inbox
[02:18:14.840 --> 02:18:17.820]   and my head wasn't with him and my heart wasn't with him.
[02:18:17.820 --> 02:18:20.740]   I was just distracted and so as parents,
[02:18:20.740 --> 02:18:24.820]   if we can honor those sacred times
[02:18:24.820 --> 02:18:27.420]   when we're with our children to keep our devices away,
[02:18:27.420 --> 02:18:31.840]   meal times, sleep time as well, it's not easy to do,
[02:18:31.840 --> 02:18:34.780]   but it really sets a good example for our kids.
[02:18:35.780 --> 02:18:39.060]   All behavior change that we're talking about here,
[02:18:39.060 --> 02:18:40.900]   the kind of behavior change I've worked with patients
[02:18:40.900 --> 02:18:43.620]   over the years around physical activity and diet,
[02:18:43.620 --> 02:18:46.660]   all of this is harder to do when we're doing it by ourself.
[02:18:46.660 --> 02:18:49.940]   It's a lot easier to do when we have a couple of friends
[02:18:49.940 --> 02:18:52.420]   or family members who we agree to do this with,
[02:18:52.420 --> 02:18:53.700]   we hold each other accountable,
[02:18:53.700 --> 02:18:56.180]   we encourage and support each other.
[02:18:56.180 --> 02:18:57.740]   It's how I've been able to make,
[02:18:57.740 --> 02:19:00.380]   the most successful behavior changes I've made in my life
[02:19:00.380 --> 02:19:03.620]   have come about because I have two good buddies,
[02:19:03.620 --> 02:19:06.900]   Dave and Sonny, who are part of my brotherhood
[02:19:06.900 --> 02:19:09.660]   and the three of us as brothers talk about health,
[02:19:09.660 --> 02:19:12.460]   we talk about our finances, we talk about our family
[02:19:12.460 --> 02:19:14.700]   and our friendships and our failings
[02:19:14.700 --> 02:19:16.740]   and we help keep each other accountable
[02:19:16.740 --> 02:19:19.060]   and so I would just encourage parents,
[02:19:19.060 --> 02:19:21.620]   like this sounds daunting or overwhelming,
[02:19:21.620 --> 02:19:23.400]   you don't have to do this alone.
[02:19:23.400 --> 02:19:24.780]   Think about one or two people,
[02:19:24.780 --> 02:19:26.580]   other parents who you might wanna do this with
[02:19:26.580 --> 02:19:27.900]   and I guarantee you, a lot of us
[02:19:27.900 --> 02:19:29.560]   are struggling with the same stuff
[02:19:29.560 --> 02:19:31.700]   and they would probably welcome an opportunity
[02:19:31.700 --> 02:19:34.660]   to do this in collaboration with another parent.
[02:19:34.660 --> 02:19:38.500]   - Such spectacular advice that I hope everyone will follow,
[02:19:38.500 --> 02:19:40.920]   not just for their kids but for themselves.
[02:19:40.920 --> 02:19:44.900]   I think that whether or not social media is addictive
[02:19:44.900 --> 02:19:46.820]   in the true sense of the word
[02:19:46.820 --> 02:19:49.220]   is kind of a meaningless debate at this point.
[02:19:49.220 --> 02:19:52.640]   It's at the very least a compulsive behavior for many of us
[02:19:52.640 --> 02:19:55.700]   and as you described it in the example you gave,
[02:19:55.700 --> 02:19:57.380]   it becomes reflexive.
[02:19:57.380 --> 02:20:00.060]   We're just, we're not necessarily seeking pleasure
[02:20:00.060 --> 02:20:02.660]   or looking to engage in online battles,
[02:20:02.660 --> 02:20:04.580]   it's just, it's become reflexive.
[02:20:04.580 --> 02:20:05.540]   Sort of like finding yourself
[02:20:05.540 --> 02:20:06.760]   with your hand in the refrigerator,
[02:20:06.760 --> 02:20:09.380]   just you don't even think about it, you're just doing it.
[02:20:09.380 --> 02:20:11.340]   So becoming more conscious of the use
[02:20:11.340 --> 02:20:16.020]   and thereby more conscious of the value
[02:20:16.020 --> 02:20:19.660]   of putting away the screens and social media
[02:20:19.660 --> 02:20:21.220]   for extended periods of time each day
[02:20:21.220 --> 02:20:22.320]   and certainly in the middle of the night.
[02:20:22.320 --> 02:20:24.480]   Folks, neuroplasticity, brain rewiring happens
[02:20:24.480 --> 02:20:26.060]   in the middle of the night while you're asleep
[02:20:26.060 --> 02:20:29.380]   and when you mentioned kids awake in the middle of the night
[02:20:29.380 --> 02:20:31.100]   looking at their phone, I just--
[02:20:31.100 --> 02:20:31.940]   - I saw you flinch.
[02:20:31.940 --> 02:20:33.980]   - Oh my goodness, it just pains me.
[02:20:33.980 --> 02:20:35.160]   I've looked at my phone in the middle of the night,
[02:20:35.160 --> 02:20:38.700]   I try not to but I'm certainly not in the window
[02:20:38.700 --> 02:20:40.300]   of maximum plasticity either.
[02:20:40.300 --> 02:20:41.300]   It's terrible for everybody
[02:20:41.300 --> 02:20:42.940]   but especially terrible for kids.
[02:20:42.940 --> 02:20:47.580]   What you just provided is an incredible,
[02:20:47.580 --> 02:20:51.140]   let's just call it a, I'll call it a mandate,
[02:20:51.140 --> 02:20:55.220]   you didn't say it but a suggestion of teaming up with people
[02:20:55.220 --> 02:20:57.580]   to become more like-minded around these issues
[02:20:57.580 --> 02:21:00.220]   and to really promote health.
[02:21:00.220 --> 02:21:02.720]   Along those lines, I really want to thank you.
[02:21:02.720 --> 02:21:05.380]   First of all, for the conversation today.
[02:21:05.380 --> 02:21:07.040]   You're incredibly busy, you're responsible
[02:21:07.040 --> 02:21:11.380]   for an entire country's worth of people.
[02:21:11.380 --> 02:21:13.380]   So to take time to sit down with me
[02:21:13.380 --> 02:21:16.180]   and to discuss these topics for our audience
[02:21:16.180 --> 02:21:20.460]   is incredibly appreciated by me and by them.
[02:21:20.460 --> 02:21:24.660]   I feel comfortable extending their gratitude here.
[02:21:24.660 --> 02:21:27.220]   And it's also clear based on today's conversation
[02:21:27.220 --> 02:21:29.520]   that you face an enormous number of challenges
[02:21:29.520 --> 02:21:31.460]   at the level of budgetary challenges.
[02:21:31.460 --> 02:21:33.460]   By the way, I'm going to work on that.
[02:21:33.460 --> 02:21:35.080]   It's hard to shut me up.
[02:21:35.080 --> 02:21:40.560]   As well as the huge array of issues that you confront.
[02:21:40.560 --> 02:21:43.900]   And it's clear that it's a challenge that you've embraced
[02:21:43.900 --> 02:21:47.080]   for many years now, 100 difficult conditions,
[02:21:47.080 --> 02:21:49.740]   and that you're clearly willing to get out
[02:21:49.740 --> 02:21:52.900]   and talk to people and hear their criticism,
[02:21:52.900 --> 02:21:56.320]   hear their concerns, hear and learn from them.
[02:21:56.320 --> 02:21:58.820]   And so it's been of great benefit to us
[02:21:58.820 --> 02:22:00.140]   to hear and learn from you.
[02:22:00.140 --> 02:22:03.580]   And I hope this won't be the last of our conversations.
[02:22:03.580 --> 02:22:05.000]   There's many more topics to cover,
[02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:07.140]   but I just really want to thank you.
[02:22:07.140 --> 02:22:11.460]   Thanks ever so much for the intellectual power
[02:22:11.460 --> 02:22:14.180]   and the emotional power that you put into what you do,
[02:22:14.180 --> 02:22:15.300]   'cause that is very clear.
[02:22:15.300 --> 02:22:18.020]   You're a physician first and you care about your patients
[02:22:18.020 --> 02:22:19.720]   and your patients are all of us.
[02:22:19.720 --> 02:22:21.060]   So thank you so much.
[02:22:21.060 --> 02:22:23.140]   - Andrew, that's just incredibly kind of you.
[02:22:23.140 --> 02:22:24.660]   Thank you, I appreciate that.
[02:22:24.660 --> 02:22:26.900]   And I've loved our conversation.
[02:22:26.900 --> 02:22:31.900]   And for me, what I hope most of all for my kids,
[02:22:31.900 --> 02:22:40.120]   for our country more broadly is that we can go deeper,
[02:22:40.120 --> 02:22:43.340]   like beneath these surface issues,
[02:22:43.340 --> 02:22:46.900]   I worry that we find ourselves disagreeing about
[02:22:46.900 --> 02:22:48.360]   and fighting about online.
[02:22:48.360 --> 02:22:51.640]   And recognize that there is a deeper challenge
[02:22:51.640 --> 02:22:53.520]   that we are facing that I think underlies
[02:22:53.520 --> 02:22:57.840]   a lot of the anger and the vitriol.
[02:22:57.840 --> 02:23:01.420]   And this issue around how disconnected
[02:23:01.420 --> 02:23:03.300]   we've become from one another,
[02:23:03.300 --> 02:23:04.460]   I think is at the heart of that.
[02:23:04.460 --> 02:23:05.920]   I don't think that there's any policy
[02:23:05.920 --> 02:23:07.760]   or program we can implement.
[02:23:07.760 --> 02:23:10.100]   That's gonna ultimately fix what ails society
[02:23:10.100 --> 02:23:12.240]   without fundamentally realizing that
[02:23:12.240 --> 02:23:16.140]   a lot of this is a manifestation of a society
[02:23:16.140 --> 02:23:18.300]   that has become more disconnected
[02:23:18.300 --> 02:23:21.220]   and more disinvested in one another over time.
[02:23:21.220 --> 02:23:22.860]   And that's just not who we are.
[02:23:22.860 --> 02:23:24.660]   It's not how we evolved over thousands of years.
[02:23:24.660 --> 02:23:26.940]   It's not how we're gonna thrive in the future.
[02:23:26.940 --> 02:23:28.900]   So I know that sometimes when you look
[02:23:28.900 --> 02:23:31.580]   at these big intractable problems,
[02:23:31.580 --> 02:23:34.700]   like widespread loneliness in the United States,
[02:23:34.700 --> 02:23:37.600]   that it can seem like hard to address these.
[02:23:37.600 --> 02:23:40.600]   But I do want to encourage everyone to recognize
[02:23:40.600 --> 02:23:42.260]   that when it comes to human connection,
[02:23:42.260 --> 02:23:45.520]   that it is small steps that can make a big difference.
[02:23:45.520 --> 02:23:48.140]   Because we are hardwired to connect as human beings.
[02:23:48.140 --> 02:23:51.080]   And if you just pause for a moment,
[02:23:51.080 --> 02:23:54.920]   and if you just think for a moment in your own life
[02:23:54.920 --> 02:23:58.800]   about someone who has been there for you
[02:23:58.800 --> 02:24:00.260]   during a time of great need,
[02:24:00.260 --> 02:24:03.300]   somebody who has stood up for you
[02:24:03.300 --> 02:24:06.700]   and you couldn't stand up for yourself,
[02:24:06.700 --> 02:24:08.360]   someone who's helped to remind you
[02:24:08.360 --> 02:24:11.680]   of why you're still a good person,
[02:24:11.680 --> 02:24:14.100]   why you still have worth and value to add to the world,
[02:24:14.100 --> 02:24:16.140]   even when you had lost faith in yourself.
[02:24:16.140 --> 02:24:20.220]   When you think about their faith in you,
[02:24:20.220 --> 02:24:23.520]   about their support for you, about their love for you,
[02:24:23.520 --> 02:24:26.220]   think about how healing that was.
[02:24:26.220 --> 02:24:31.800]   That's the power that we have to help each other heal.
[02:24:31.800 --> 02:24:35.900]   We are going through an identity crisis
[02:24:35.900 --> 02:24:37.660]   in many ways as a country,
[02:24:37.660 --> 02:24:41.540]   where I think we need to ask ourselves, who are we?
[02:24:41.540 --> 02:24:43.380]   Like, what defines who we are?
[02:24:43.380 --> 02:24:46.460]   What are the set of values that we want to guide us
[02:24:46.460 --> 02:24:48.320]   in our life and to guide our country?
[02:24:49.400 --> 02:24:53.620]   And I know that it feels like we're a nation of people
[02:24:53.620 --> 02:24:56.120]   who are mean, who only care about ourselves,
[02:24:56.120 --> 02:24:59.420]   who are throwing blame and anger at each other all the time,
[02:24:59.420 --> 02:25:01.440]   who are pessimistic about the future.
[02:25:01.440 --> 02:25:04.780]   But I actually don't think that's really who we are.
[02:25:04.780 --> 02:25:09.780]   I think at our heart, we are hopeful and optimistic people.
[02:25:09.780 --> 02:25:12.020]   I think in our true nature,
[02:25:12.020 --> 02:25:14.660]   we are kind and generous to one another.
[02:25:16.720 --> 02:25:20.340]   In our hearts, we're interdependent creatures
[02:25:20.340 --> 02:25:22.420]   who recognize that if someone else is suffering,
[02:25:22.420 --> 02:25:24.380]   we want to be out there to support them,
[02:25:24.380 --> 02:25:28.340]   and who want people to be there to support us as well.
[02:25:28.340 --> 02:25:29.960]   That's who we really are.
[02:25:29.960 --> 02:25:35.500]   But we have to make a clear choice here about our identity,
[02:25:35.500 --> 02:25:39.140]   you know, as individuals and as a country,
[02:25:39.140 --> 02:25:41.780]   and recognize that that choice has real implications
[02:25:41.780 --> 02:25:43.620]   for everything else that we're talking about here.
[02:25:43.620 --> 02:25:45.500]   That's the foundation.
[02:25:45.500 --> 02:25:49.680]   And when I think about my own kids growing up,
[02:25:49.680 --> 02:25:52.140]   like many parents, I worry about the world
[02:25:52.140 --> 02:25:53.560]   that they're coming into.
[02:25:53.560 --> 02:25:59.220]   I worry that they're gonna use the wrong word,
[02:25:59.220 --> 02:26:00.660]   even though their intentions are right,
[02:26:00.660 --> 02:26:03.540]   and people are gonna blame them or cast them out.
[02:26:03.540 --> 02:26:05.680]   No, I worry that they're gonna stumble and fall down,
[02:26:05.680 --> 02:26:08.600]   and people are just gonna keep walking by, not caring,
[02:26:08.600 --> 02:26:11.600]   you know, because everyone's living their own life.
[02:26:11.600 --> 02:26:13.040]   I worry that they might become someone
[02:26:13.040 --> 02:26:14.760]   who does the same thing to other people, right?
[02:26:14.760 --> 02:26:16.240]   None of which I want.
[02:26:16.240 --> 02:26:18.400]   What I want for all of our kids is for them to grow up
[02:26:18.400 --> 02:26:21.240]   in a society where we care about one another.
[02:26:21.240 --> 02:26:22.880]   We have each other's backs.
[02:26:22.880 --> 02:26:25.560]   We recognize, as that old African proverb goes,
[02:26:25.560 --> 02:26:28.240]   that we can go fast if we go alone,
[02:26:28.240 --> 02:26:31.560]   but if we really want to go far, we go together.
[02:26:31.560 --> 02:26:34.400]   And that's what I want for my kids and our country,
[02:26:34.400 --> 02:26:36.320]   but that's what we each have the power
[02:26:36.320 --> 02:26:38.060]   to create in our own lives.
[02:26:38.060 --> 02:26:40.460]   It starts with the decisions we make,
[02:26:40.460 --> 02:26:42.740]   but how we treat one another.
[02:26:42.740 --> 02:26:46.460]   Do we, for example, reach out for five minutes a day
[02:26:46.460 --> 02:26:47.680]   to someone that we care about?
[02:26:47.680 --> 02:26:49.280]   Do we pick up the phone and call them to say,
[02:26:49.280 --> 02:26:50.540]   "Hey, I'm thinking about you."
[02:26:50.540 --> 02:26:52.540]   We can all do that today.
[02:26:52.540 --> 02:26:55.540]   Do we give people the benefit of our full attention,
[02:26:55.540 --> 02:26:58.300]   recognizing that while time is scarce,
[02:26:58.300 --> 02:27:00.740]   our attention has the ability to stretch time.
[02:27:00.740 --> 02:27:03.220]   It can make five minutes feel like half an hour,
[02:27:03.220 --> 02:27:05.400]   but it's a hard thing for people to get
[02:27:05.400 --> 02:27:06.940]   'cause they're distracted by their devices,
[02:27:06.940 --> 02:27:09.620]   but do we give people the benefit of our full attention?
[02:27:09.620 --> 02:27:12.220]   And do we look for ways to serve one another,
[02:27:12.220 --> 02:27:14.940]   recognizing that it's through our acts of service
[02:27:14.940 --> 02:27:17.300]   that we actually forge powerful connections,
[02:27:17.300 --> 02:27:20.060]   but we also remind ourselves how much value
[02:27:20.060 --> 02:27:21.380]   we have to bring to the world.
[02:27:21.380 --> 02:27:24.460]   And this is important at a time when the self-esteem
[02:27:24.460 --> 02:27:26.980]   of so many of us and our young people in particular
[02:27:26.980 --> 02:27:30.480]   is being eroded, particularly by their use of social media.
[02:27:30.480 --> 02:27:33.540]   So these are the steps that we can take
[02:27:33.540 --> 02:27:36.420]   to build connection in our life.
[02:27:36.420 --> 02:27:37.900]   But the core values, I believe,
[02:27:37.900 --> 02:27:39.580]   that have to be at the heart of our identity,
[02:27:39.580 --> 02:27:42.160]   these values around kindness and generosity,
[02:27:42.160 --> 02:27:45.280]   around courage and service.
[02:27:45.280 --> 02:27:47.140]   These also have to animate the decisions
[02:27:47.140 --> 02:27:52.140]   that we make in our life about programs we advocate for,
[02:27:52.140 --> 02:27:56.140]   the policies we support, the leaders we choose.
[02:27:56.140 --> 02:27:58.600]   These should all be reflections of the values
[02:27:58.600 --> 02:28:00.040]   that we wanna see in our children
[02:28:00.040 --> 02:28:01.740]   and in society more broadly.
[02:28:01.740 --> 02:28:03.700]   'Cause I'll tell you that 90% plus
[02:28:03.700 --> 02:28:05.980]   of the decisions leaders make,
[02:28:05.980 --> 02:28:07.580]   they make behind closed doors.
[02:28:07.580 --> 02:28:09.860]   And what's guiding them in those moments are their values.
[02:28:09.860 --> 02:28:12.460]   That's true whether you're the leader of a company
[02:28:12.460 --> 02:28:16.520]   or a nonprofit organization or a leader in government.
[02:28:16.520 --> 02:28:17.680]   So those values matter.
[02:28:17.680 --> 02:28:19.700]   And I want us as a country to speak more
[02:28:19.700 --> 02:28:22.060]   about the values that we choose,
[02:28:22.060 --> 02:28:26.420]   about the identity that we want to anchor ourselves to.
[02:28:26.420 --> 02:28:29.580]   That's the way in which I feel like America
[02:28:29.580 --> 02:28:33.140]   can be an even greater beacon of hope for the world.
[02:28:33.140 --> 02:28:34.940]   Because the world is struggling with this too.
[02:28:34.940 --> 02:28:36.460]   We're not the only ones who are dealing
[02:28:36.460 --> 02:28:38.260]   with loneliness and isolation,
[02:28:38.260 --> 02:28:42.380]   who are seeing anger and resentment and vitriol bubble up
[02:28:42.380 --> 02:28:44.340]   at extraordinary levels,
[02:28:44.340 --> 02:28:47.760]   who are seeing mistrust in institutions soar.
[02:28:47.760 --> 02:28:50.540]   Many countries are experiencing this.
[02:28:50.540 --> 02:28:53.180]   I would love America to lead the way in some ways
[02:28:53.180 --> 02:28:56.740]   in showing what it's like to embrace a more human identity
[02:28:56.740 --> 02:28:59.200]   that's centered around kindness and service
[02:28:59.200 --> 02:29:01.860]   and friendship and generosity.
[02:29:01.860 --> 02:29:03.820]   Like to me, all of these values,
[02:29:03.820 --> 02:29:06.700]   ultimately, Andrew, stem from love, right?
[02:29:06.700 --> 02:29:09.540]   Love is our greatest source of power.
[02:29:09.540 --> 02:29:11.500]   It's our greatest source of healing.
[02:29:11.500 --> 02:29:14.060]   I say that as a doctor who's prescribed many medicines
[02:29:14.060 --> 02:29:17.340]   over the years, but there are few things more powerful
[02:29:17.340 --> 02:29:20.640]   than love and its ability to help us through difficult times
[02:29:20.640 --> 02:29:23.820]   and help mend the wounds seen and unseen
[02:29:23.820 --> 02:29:25.480]   that we all carry with us.
[02:29:25.480 --> 02:29:29.420]   And I think if we recognize that, we recognize that,
[02:29:29.420 --> 02:29:33.060]   you know, we don't have to have an MD after our name
[02:29:33.060 --> 02:29:35.320]   or have gone to nursing school to be healers.
[02:29:35.320 --> 02:29:38.940]   We all have the power to help each other heal.
[02:29:38.940 --> 02:29:42.580]   Like Andrew, we are not fundamentally a nation
[02:29:42.580 --> 02:29:46.360]   of bystanders who just stand by while other people suffer.
[02:29:46.360 --> 02:29:51.240]   Like we're a nation of healers and hope makers
[02:29:51.240 --> 02:29:54.180]   who can restore hope that the future can be better,
[02:29:54.180 --> 02:29:56.020]   who can create a better life for ourselves
[02:29:56.020 --> 02:29:57.780]   and the people around us right now.
[02:29:57.780 --> 02:29:59.020]   It's what we're capable of.
[02:29:59.020 --> 02:30:00.540]   It's what we're built for.
[02:30:00.540 --> 02:30:04.340]   And that's the identity that I think we now more than ever
[02:30:04.340 --> 02:30:07.020]   need to embrace.
[02:30:07.020 --> 02:30:07.860]   - Amen.
[02:30:07.860 --> 02:30:10.080]   Thank you for that.
[02:30:10.080 --> 02:30:15.580]   I agree, love is definitely the verb
[02:30:15.580 --> 02:30:17.840]   that can get us where we need to go.
[02:30:17.840 --> 02:30:20.420]   Thank you so much for your words,
[02:30:20.420 --> 02:30:24.740]   for your incredible efforts to support public health
[02:30:24.740 --> 02:30:28.660]   and hopefully to continue to support public health.
[02:30:28.660 --> 02:30:31.180]   I know you've been at this a long time
[02:30:31.180 --> 02:30:33.220]   and we have all benefited.
[02:30:33.220 --> 02:30:36.100]   And thanks for your open-mindedness,
[02:30:36.100 --> 02:30:38.140]   especially around some of the questions
[02:30:38.140 --> 02:30:39.580]   that invoke some challenge.
[02:30:39.580 --> 02:30:42.460]   And again, for your taking the time
[02:30:42.460 --> 02:30:43.820]   to come talk with us today.
[02:30:43.820 --> 02:30:46.420]   And I really also enjoyed it.
[02:30:46.420 --> 02:30:47.540]   It's been a real pleasure
[02:30:47.540 --> 02:30:49.660]   and there was a lot of learning for me.
[02:30:49.660 --> 02:30:53.980]   And like I said before, I hope it won't be the last time.
[02:30:53.980 --> 02:30:54.900]   - I hope not either.
[02:30:54.900 --> 02:30:57.800]   No, I look forward to the next time to staying in touch
[02:30:57.800 --> 02:31:00.180]   and just love this conversation.
[02:31:00.180 --> 02:31:01.260]   Thank you for what you've done
[02:31:01.260 --> 02:31:04.800]   for being this beautiful channel of information
[02:31:04.800 --> 02:31:05.640]   for the public.
[02:31:05.640 --> 02:31:08.100]   But it's most importantly, thank you for who you are.
[02:31:08.100 --> 02:31:10.900]   Like who you are, Andrew, like comes across very clearly.
[02:31:10.900 --> 02:31:14.300]   When I meet you, you just, you have a good heart
[02:31:14.300 --> 02:31:16.300]   and you have good intentions.
[02:31:16.300 --> 02:31:17.140]   You're a good man.
[02:31:17.140 --> 02:31:19.500]   And we need more people like you in the world.
[02:31:19.500 --> 02:31:20.960]   - Thank you, right back at you.
[02:31:20.960 --> 02:31:22.740]   Thank you for joining me for today's discussion
[02:31:22.740 --> 02:31:24.120]   with Dr. Vivek Murthy,
[02:31:24.120 --> 02:31:26.420]   the Surgeon General of the United States.
[02:31:26.420 --> 02:31:29.440]   I hope you found it to be as informative as I did.

[02:32:01.480 --> 02:32:04.340]   but on many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:32:04.340 --> 02:32:05.760]   we discuss supplements.
[02:32:05.760 --> 02:32:07.860]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[02:32:07.860 --> 02:32:10.020]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[02:32:10.020 --> 02:32:11.420]   for things like improving sleep,
[02:32:11.420 --> 02:32:13.660]   for hormone support, and for focus.
[02:32:13.660 --> 02:32:15.160]   The Huberman Lab Podcast has partnered
[02:32:15.160 --> 02:32:16.220]   with Momentous Supplements,
[02:32:16.220 --> 02:32:17.920]   and we did that for several reasons.
[02:32:17.920 --> 02:32:19.280]   First of all, their ingredients
[02:32:19.280 --> 02:32:21.040]   are of the very highest quality.
[02:32:21.040 --> 02:32:22.960]   Second of all, they tend to focus
[02:32:22.960 --> 02:32:24.880]   on single ingredient formulations,
[02:32:24.880 --> 02:32:27.300]   which make it easy to develop the most cost-effective
[02:32:27.300 --> 02:32:30.440]   and biologically effective supplement regimen for you.
[02:32:30.440 --> 02:32:33.040]   And third, Momentous Supplements ship internationally,
[02:32:33.040 --> 02:32:34.800]   which we realize is important
[02:32:34.800 --> 02:32:37.760]   because many of you reside outside of the United States.
[02:32:37.760 --> 02:32:40.280]   To see the supplements discussed on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:32:40.280 --> 02:32:42.720]   go to Live Momentous, spelled O-U-S,
[02:32:42.720 --> 02:32:45.800]   so it's livemomentous.com/huberman.
[02:32:45.800 --> 02:32:47.840]   If you're not already following me on social media,
[02:32:47.840 --> 02:32:50.100]   you can do so by going to Huberman Lab
[02:32:50.100 --> 02:32:51.800]   on all social media platforms.
[02:32:51.800 --> 02:32:54.660]   So that's Instagram, Twitter, now called X,
[02:32:54.660 --> 02:32:57.280]   LinkedIn, Facebook, and Threads.
[02:32:57.280 --> 02:32:58.480]   On all of those platforms,
[02:32:58.480 --> 02:33:00.280]   I cover science and science-related tools,
[02:33:00.280 --> 02:33:01.320]   some of which overlaps
[02:33:01.320 --> 02:33:03.200]   with the content of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:33:03.200 --> 02:33:05.360]   but much of which is distinct from the content
[02:33:05.360 --> 02:33:06.880]   covered on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[02:33:06.880 --> 02:33:10.380]   Again, that's Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[02:33:10.380 --> 02:33:11.520]   If you haven't already subscribed
[02:33:11.520 --> 02:33:12.740]   to our neural network newsletter,
[02:33:12.740 --> 02:33:14.040]   the neural network newsletter
[02:33:14.040 --> 02:33:15.560]   is a zero-cost monthly newsletter
[02:33:15.560 --> 02:33:18.480]   that includes podcast summaries, as well as toolkits,
[02:33:18.480 --> 02:33:21.700]   so toolkits for sleep, toolkits for learning and plasticity,
[02:33:21.700 --> 02:33:23.940]   toolkits related to dopamine regulation,
[02:33:23.940 --> 02:33:25.080]   and much more.
[02:33:25.080 --> 02:33:26.280]   Again, it's all zero-cost.
[02:33:26.280 --> 02:33:28.320]   You simply go to HubermanLab.com,
[02:33:28.320 --> 02:33:30.800]   go to the Menu tab, scroll down to Newsletter,
[02:33:30.800 --> 02:33:32.340]   and simply enter your email,
[02:33:32.340 --> 02:33:34.840]   and we do not share your email with anybody.
[02:33:34.840 --> 02:33:37.080]   Thank you once again for joining me for today's discussion
[02:33:37.080 --> 02:33:39.760]   with the US Surgeon General, Dr. Vivek Murthy.
[02:33:39.760 --> 02:33:41.880]   And last, but certainly not least,
[02:33:41.880 --> 02:33:43.700]   thank you for your interest in science.
[02:33:43.700 --> 02:33:46.280]   [upbeat music]
[02:33:46.280 --> 02:33:48.860]   (upbeat music)
