[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Well, how do I find my identity, my self-identity?
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   Directly or indirectly, we get that essential question all the time in the inbox.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   Take, for example, this email from Nick, a listener and a
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   former collegiate volleyball player. He gave his life to competitive
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   sports in college, and he discovered, as every athlete eventually does,
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   that his career would end. And it ended
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   sooner than Nick expected. And when it did, he fell
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   into a season of darkness. He had failed to achieve his
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   athletic goals, and he hadn't prepared himself for the abrupt end, unprepared
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   to be separated from the competition, from his school, and
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   from his teammates. So how does a serious athlete like Nick
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   find his self-identity now? Well, self-identity
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   was a theme in John Piper's very first message in his famous sermon series
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   on the Book of Romans. Many of you know about that sermon series.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   Pastor John preached through all of Romans in 225 sermons over the course
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   of eight years and eight months, spanning from the spring of 1998
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   to the end of 2006. All 225 of those rich messages
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   are collected under the series title, "The Greatest Letter Ever
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   Written." As we recently heard, Romans is a
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   key to his own self-identity. And in sermon number one
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   of his series, number one, he started with verse one of Romans.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   That's all he covered in the first sermon. To cover the
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   Apostle Paul's identity. And from it, our
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   identity. Here he is in 1998 reading that first
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   verse. Paul, a bond
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   servant of Christ Jesus, called as an apostle,
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   set apart for the gospel of
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   God. Now, there are three phrases there. We'll look
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   at them. And I want you to see the man. I want you to see his letter. I want you to see
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   his God. And just by way
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   of application, right off the bat, you know, sometimes you read a verse and
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   even before the exposition comes, it says a word
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   to you so personally that it sort of
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   skips over the exposition. And I just have a feeling that
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   the word that just blurts itself
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   out here is, it isn't who Paul is.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   It's whose Paul is. You see
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   that in those three phrases? Servant, one,
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   bought by another, a called one, called by
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   another, a set apart one, set apart by another. There's
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   somebody else in this verse. Right?
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   Paul looks like he's what this verse is about. This verse
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   is not about Paul. The one who bought him, the one who called him,
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   the one who set him apart, there's somebody lurking behind this man.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   The big questions in life are not, "Who am I?"
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   The big question in life is, "Whose am I?"
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   You've got to answer that question, "Whose are you?" "Whose
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   are you?" That's the issue. We get all, in the 20th century,
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   we get all bent out of shape about self-identity and stuff. "Who am
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   I and my worth and my esteem and my value and all that?"
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   Man, when you read the Bible, the huge
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   issue is right relation
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   with God and whom you belong to.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   Whose you are.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   So let that be the question hanging over this verse.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   Phrase number one, "A bondservant of
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   Christ Jesus."
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Now we religious types who read the Bible for dozens of years,
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   we've got to realize what a shocking
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   phrase that is. We've got to decide here if this man's
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   crazy. Jesus Christ, according to
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   Tacitus, secular witness, as well as all
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   the Christian witnesses, as well as Josephus, said
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   Jesus died 25 years ago.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   He's dead. He's not
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   master of anybody. And Paul says,
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   "He's my master and he's alive."
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   I am a slave
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   to the living Christ Jesus. So you've
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   got to decide now at the beginning of this book, are these the
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   rantings of a madman who thinks people die and then pop up out of the grave
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   three days later and then become masters of people?
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   Is he a crazy man? Or did possibly
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   that happen? And that's reality.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   And all the people in the world who ignore that
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   or mock that are unreality. You've got to
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   decide this. These are huge issues.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   Is he crazy to call himself
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   the bondservant of Christ Jesus?
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   What does that mean to be the bondservant?
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   It means he's bought by Jesus, owned by Jesus,
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   ruled by Jesus. I'll show you where I get that. 1 Corinthians
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   7, 23, he says, "You were bought
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   by a price, with a price. Do not become
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   slaves of men."
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   So to be a slave of somebody is to have been
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   bought by them. So he calls himself a slave or a bondservant of
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   Christ, which means Christ bought him. And that's what he says, "Christ bought
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   me. And since he bought me, he owns me."
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   If you're a Christian this morning, you are doubly owned by God.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   You are owned by virtue of creation and you are owned by virtue of
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   purchase. You are doubly your...
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   doubly not your own. Doubly his. He owns
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   you. He can do with you as he pleases.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   Which leads us to the third thing it means, namely that he
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   rules you and that what you want to do is please
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   him. Where do I get that? Galatians 1, 10.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   "Am I striving to please men?"
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   "If I were still trying to please men,"
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   Paul says, "I would not be the bondservant
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   of Christ." "If I were trying
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   to please men, I would not be the
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   bondservant of Christ. But I am the bondservant
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   of Christ, therefore I don't give a rip about pleasing
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   men unless my
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   pleasing them might lead them to please my master."
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   Which is what Romans 15 says. "Let us seek to please one another
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   for edification that we might glorify God
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   through bringing others to him." But what's driving this man is
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   a radical Christ orientation because Christ
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   bought him, owns him, and rules him now and all
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   of his thinking is, "How can I please him? How can
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   I honor him? How can I magnify him?" And what we want to create
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   in Bethlehem, and I know that the vast majority of you are with me on
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   this, what we want is a church of people who
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   are radically oriented on pleasing Christ, honoring
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   Christ, magnifying Christ, and letting the chips fall
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   where they will instead of being what most people are, namely
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   second-handers. Get that phrase from I.M. Rand
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   who wrote the novel Atlas Shrugged, who despised
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   second-handers. That is people who have no
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   vision and values of their own for which they live triumphantly
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   and are always looking over their shoulder wondering, "I wonder what they think about this, and I wonder
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   what they think about this, and I wonder what they think about this," and they live their whole lives
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   second-handedly, always trying to get into other people's
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   good graces and be liked and stroked and praised
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   and complimented and paid. It's a
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   horrible way to live. And Paul said,
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   "I am owned by another. I have
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   been bought and I am ruled, and I have one person to
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   please, Christ, and he has revealed his word
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   in me, and that's my life. Let's be like that."
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   Owned by another. Amen. The foundation of our self-identity
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   is not who am I, but whose am I.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   That was from John Piper's April 26, 1998 sermon title,
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   "The Author of the Greatest Letter Ever Written." It's a wonderful clip,
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   one that my wife found and brought to my attention. If you have a John Piper
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   sermon clip, email me your name, hometown, the sermon title, and the time stamp
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   of where the clip happens in the audio. You can tell me what stands out to you in that email
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   and put the word "clip" in the subject line and send it to me at
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org. That's our email address, askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   As you can see here, there's so much gold to
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   glean in the Bible when we study it phrase by phrase.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   So if I want to slow down and study something in my Bible with greater focus,
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   what's a good Bible commentary to use?
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   In fact, are there any good commentaries that cover the entire Bible?
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   That's a great question, and it's up next when Pastor John returns.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   What are the best whole Bible commentaries available?
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   I'm Tony Reinke. We'll see you Friday.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   [no audio]
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   [no audio]
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.780]   (Thanks for watching)
