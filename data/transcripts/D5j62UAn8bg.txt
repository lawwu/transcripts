[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.880]   So back in episode 91, which I think might have been the most popular episode of all time,
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.560]   I sat down with Bill Perkins, who wrote a book called Die With Zero.
[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:14.920]   And the general principle of the book is that you should focus on net fulfillment over net worth,
