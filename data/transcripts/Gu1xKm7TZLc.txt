[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   I recently attended a mega-conference for Christians in Media, and among the hundreds
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.480]   of booths included a huge display of costumes and props from a current TV show based on
[00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.480]   the life of Christ.
[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.480]   It was quite fascinating.
[00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.560]   All the costumes and the props and the set pieces were scattered all throughout this
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.040]   open walk-through display.
[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:32.000]   It really pulled you into first-century Jerusalem, giving you a little tangible taste of what
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   life was like in the time of Christ.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.040]   After walking through it, it made me wonder, and I think it makes a lot of people wonder,
[00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.640]   wouldn't it have been better to have lived in a generation that could have seen Christ
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.080]   with our own eyes, to know him face-to-face?
[00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.960]   I think this is one reason why we're attracted to television shows and movies about his life,
[00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.560]   because for us, we're stuck many years after his earthly ministry with just a written account
[00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.800]   of his life in the Gospels.
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.240]   So is that to our disadvantage?
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:07.520]   With a very definitive no.
[00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.040]   Pastor John explains why believers today are not at a disadvantage, and he does so by preaching
[00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:18.240]   from a great text on this very topic, 1 Peter 1, verses 8 and 9.
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.520]   Here he is in 1993, first talking about the nature of joy.
[00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.840]   Here's Pastor John.
[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.260]   You rejoice in this faith and love.
[00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:38.320]   You rejoice with a joy that is unable to be expressed, and which is literally, the word
[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:44.960]   is glorified, translated "full of glory" here in NASB.
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:51.760]   Now, I think the way we have defined joy goes a long way to helping us understand why it's
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.040]   inexpressible and why it is glorified.
[00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.440]   I'll ask this question to make the connection for you.
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.400]   Where does joy get its moral quality?
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.800]   Not just its intensity.
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.040]   We're talking about quality here.
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.600]   Inexpressible and glorified.
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.920]   Not just big, not just strong.
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.200]   There can be a lot of strong emotions without Jesus.
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:21.920]   We're talking here a joy that is not only very great, but it has a glory dimension to
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:22.920]   it.
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.720]   It's got glory on it, in it, somehow.
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:33.720]   Where does joy, let's ask the general question, where does joy, your joy, get its moral dimension?
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.680]   And the answer to that question, I believe, is your joy gets its moral quality from what
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.600]   you are enjoying.
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:48.600]   So, if you enjoy dirty jokes, you've got dirty joy and a dirty heart.
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:54.360]   If you enjoy bathroom language, that really makes you laugh.
[00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.600]   Or lewd pictures, that really makes you happy.
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.080]   You have a dirty heart and dirty joy.
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.320]   Joy gets its moral quality from what you enjoy.
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:15.200]   Or if you enjoy cruelty and arrogance and revenge, and there are a lot of movies and
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:21.800]   TV programs that cultivate that kind of joy to get you to be real happy in the revenge.
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.880]   "Oh, that felt good!"
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.360]   That's dirty.
[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:35.280]   That's the kind of heart, your heart will be shaped, you become what you crave.
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:41.480]   Where you get your joy, you get your moral dimension to joy.
[00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:50.040]   Or if you just love things, if you find your life, your joy increasingly happy in more
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:55.240]   and more material things, you know what happens inside?
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.400]   You die.
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:05.720]   Your heart was made for God and love and faith and joy, and if you find this computer
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.400]   just so satisfies me, "I have tasted that.
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.400]   Wow!
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.640]   Computers are incredible!
[00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:19.560]   Dan Lane got me this new America Online thing, which connects you up with 10 million billboards
[00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:20.560]   and stuff.
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.160]   It is absolutely addicting, at least for a week or two.
[00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.160]   It is.
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:31.440]   There is great danger from, I mean, you just name it, there are 10,000 material things
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.600]   in the world that can so enamor you and capture you, and you come to the end of the day off
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:45.360]   at the screen of this computer, and say, "I'm dead!
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.120]   I'm dead!
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.480]   Deader than I was when I started this thing.
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.440]   I'm smaller, I'm drier.
[00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:53.440]   What have I done?"
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.200]   And some people have spent their whole lives like that, and they will say that on their
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:01.360]   deathbed, unless they're so dead they can't feel it.
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:08.440]   We're made for joy and Christ and relationship and love and the big unseen realities.
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.560]   So my answer to the question, "Where does joy get its moral component?"
[00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.880]   It gets its moral component from the thing enjoyed.
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.440]   Now back to where we are.
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:30.160]   Christian joy, I would argue then, is inexpressible and glorified because the Christ who is precious
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:38.480]   to us is inexpressibly precious, and the Christ who is reliable to us is inexpressibly reliable,
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:45.640]   and even though we never attain to the maximum joy we will have someday in this life, nevertheless
[00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:51.440]   our joy is hooked in, it's tied in to an inexpressible treasure, Jesus.
[00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.880]   He is inexpressibly glorious.
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:59.800]   He is inexpressibly beautiful and reliable and precious, and if your joy is in Him, that
[00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:05.680]   preciousness, that inexpressibility comes from the thing enjoyed into you, and your
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:10.520]   joy leaps up from time to time with inexpressibility.
[00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.640]   And the same thing now with glory.
[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:21.040]   I think he is saying that in the process of loving and believing and rejoicing, the goal
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:28.400]   of that, namely salvation, is happening in part, in measure now, namely the glory of
[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:33.160]   the one we love is precious and the one we trust is reliable is streaming back through
[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:39.600]   our joy into our hearts, and our joy is in measure right now, glorious.
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:45.280]   It partakes in glory because you always participate in what you enjoy.
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:50.760]   You become what you crave in large measure.
[00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:56.960]   Final question, how can all of this happen when we don't see Him?
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:57.960]   Twice he says that.
[00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:59.800]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:09.800]   So you have not seen Him, you love Him, and now though you do not see Him, believing,
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.960]   you rejoice in Him.
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:14.360]   Why does he stress that twice?
[00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:16.800]   Evidently some people were saying something like, "But we've never seen Him."
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:19.800]   You saw Him, Peter.
[00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:25.220]   Sure, you can have that kind of joy, but we've never seen Him.
[00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:30.840]   Some people, I mean obviously most weren't, because he's saying you are rejoicing without
[00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:32.160]   seeing Him.
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.360]   Now how?
[00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:41.220]   Surely the answer is there is a seeing with the heart that is not a seeing with the eyes
[00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:46.800]   that I want to argue this morning in closing is more important than seeing with the eyes.
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:51.200]   More important than seeing with the eyes is seeing with the heart.
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:55.240]   I'll try to persuade you of that in these last few minutes.
[00:07:55.240 --> 00:08:01.800]   Paul said that his mission to unreached peoples in Romans 15-20 was this.
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:02.800]   Listen to this.
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:08.200]   These are people now out there in the Roman Empire who like us have never seen Jesus.
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:14.000]   I aspire to preach the gospel not where Christ was already named, but as it is written, "They
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:26.840]   who had no news shall see Him, and they who have not heard shall understand."
[00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:32.600]   The preaching of the gospel is the means by which those who have never seen Christ see
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:35.200]   Christ in the gospel.
[00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:40.080]   Here's another way of saying it that Paul has in 2 Corinthians 4-6.
[00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:47.800]   The God who said, "Light shall shine out of darkness," has shone into our hearts to give
[00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:57.840]   the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ.
[00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:07.440]   In your heart, the light of God goes on and you see His glory in Christ's face.
[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:11.000]   That's the moral.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.960]   There were hundreds and hundreds of people who saw Jesus during His lifetime on the earth
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:19.040]   who did not see Him.
[00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:21.120]   They didn't see Him.
[00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:22.240]   They were blanked out.
[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:23.800]   They were totally confused.
[00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:25.160]   They were totally adrift.
[00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:29.000]   They didn't know who this Jewish carpenter rabbi was.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.640]   He made no sense to them whatsoever, and they saw Him hour after hour after hour.
[00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:35.080]   Is that valuable?
[00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:38.640]   That sends to hell.
[00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:40.520]   Don't exalt seeing with the eyes.
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:44.480]   Don't begrudge that you live in the 20th century with only a Bible.
[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:47.160]   Now, listen carefully now.
[00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:50.760]   We're almost done, and this is really crucial.
[00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:57.000]   We were at a Michael Card concert on Friday night, and he sings this song about childlikeness
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.040]   that captures this paradox of seeing and not seeing.
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:13.400]   "To hear with my heart, to see with my soul, to be guided by a hand I cannot hold, to trust
[00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:19.280]   in a way I cannot see."
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:23.520]   That's what faith must be.
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:30.760]   There is a seeing with soul, or the heart, that is not a seeing with the eyes.
[00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:35.840]   And it happens through the Word of God in the Gospel, and it happens through the reading
[00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:39.320]   of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.
[00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:44.800]   When you read those Gospels - and oh, I commend the Gospels to you - read the Gospels day
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:46.400]   in and day out.
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:50.080]   They are the living Christ to you.
[00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:54.600]   Read them with an openness to Christ, and you will see Him better than Nicodemus saw
[00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:59.840]   Him, better than the Syrophoenician woman saw Him, better than the centurion saw Him,
[00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:04.800]   better than the widow of Nain saw Him, better than the thief on the cross saw Him, better
[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:09.720]   than the thronging crowds who got snatches and pieces saw Him.
[00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:11.280]   Think about this in closing.
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:12.280]   Think.
[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:17.680]   The Gospels are better than being there.
[00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:22.640]   The Gospels are better than being there.
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:24.520]   Why?
[00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:29.480]   In the Gospels, you are welcomed into the inner circle where you never could have gone
[00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:32.500]   with the apostles had you been there.
[00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:36.640]   In the Gospels, you can go with Him to Gethsemane where you couldn't have gone.
[00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:40.100]   In the Gospels, you go to Him with the trial where you couldn't have gone.
[00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:42.860]   In the Gospels, you go all the way through the crucifixion.
[00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:45.760]   In the Gospels, you go in and out of the tomb with Him.
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:49.780]   In the Gospels, you are with Him with every meeting after the resurrection.
[00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:54.440]   In the Gospels, you hear whole sermons, not just little snatches and pieces because you
[00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:57.520]   were way back there in the back of the crowd and there's a baby crying beside you and you
[00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:01.120]   couldn't figure out what was going on up there and you only heard, "Blessed are the blablabla."
[00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:02.220]   What was that?
[00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:03.560]   And you couldn't hear it.
[00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:04.560]   You got the whole thing.
[00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:11.880]   And not only do you have the whole big sermons and big discourses, you've got them with God-inspired
[00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:17.400]   contexts to give them interpretations which those poor peasants didn't have a clue about.
[00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:19.800]   They didn't know what was going on.
[00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:24.940]   You see Him in His freedom from anxiety as He has no place to lay His head.
[00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:28.060]   You see His courage in the face of opposition.
[00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:32.200]   You see His unanswerable wisdom when He's peppered with questions.
[00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:38.200]   You see Him honoring women and His tenderness with children and His compassion towards lepers
[00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:44.520]   and His meekness in suffering and His patience with Peter and His tears over Jerusalem and
[00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:49.560]   His blessing on those who cursed Him and His heart for the nations and His love for the
[00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:57.000]   glory of God and His simplicity and His devotion and His power to still storms and heal sicknesses
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.920]   and drive out demons.
[00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:03.380]   They didn't have a clue compared to what you have.
[00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:06.560]   The Gospels are better than being there.
[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:13.880]   If the Holy Spirit, who was needed just as much in that day as now, will simply open
[00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:19.880]   your eyes to see the glory on His face.
[00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:20.880]   Incredible clip.
[00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:26.400]   That is from John Piper's sermon on November 14, 1993, titled "True Christianity, Inexpressible
[00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:28.880]   Joy in the Invisible Christ."
[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:33.640]   A sermon that articulates the beautiful promises of 1 Peter 1, verses 8 and 9.
[00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:34.640]   It's great text.
[00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:36.760]   Thanks for listening to today's clip.
[00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:38.280]   Most of them are now crowdsourced.
[00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:40.320]   This is one of my favorites.
[00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:43.520]   I'm personally sharing this one with you, but if you have one, tell us what bits of
[00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:45.800]   Piper's sermons changed your life.
[00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:47.680]   And we will share that clip with the APJ audience.
[00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:49.040]   If you've got one, email me.
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:53.120]   Give me your name, your hometown, the sermon title, the timestamp of where the clip happens
[00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:54.920]   in the audio, and tell me how it impacted you.
[00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:59.600]   Put the word "clip" in the subject line of an email and send it to me at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:02.600]   That's an email address, askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:08.480]   Well, a lot of our emails come from Christians who are feeling extra pressure in life.
[00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:09.480]   And that's true.
[00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:14.840]   Next up, in an email from a young mom, "Are these new pressures of motherhood making her
[00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:18.200]   more holy or more unholy?
[00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:22.840]   And how can we tell which direction the pressures in life are pushing us, towards holiness or
[00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:23.840]   away from it?"
[00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:25.840]   This is a huge question that we all face.
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:26.840]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:30.160]   We are rejoined in studio with Pastor John for that on Friday.
[00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:30.560]   We'll see you then.
[00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:31.560]   [END]
