[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:37.080]   Today on Radical Personal Finance, we talk lifestyle design with a guy who did pretty
[00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:42.920]   well in the corporate world, had a high profile, high status job, left that to launch a dream
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.080]   of entrepreneurship, which wound up failing, then went on to run for office, political
[00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.720]   office, and then he lost.
[00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:58.680]   Wound up completely losing his shirt in that escapade, living in a garage with his in-laws,
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:05.680]   his wife and new babies, and then decided that, "Hey, actually, this low-stress life,
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.920]   even though I don't have any money, is actually pretty cool.
[00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.400]   I like being with my family, so how can I put together income from a variety of sources,"
[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.800]   he now calls it patchwork income, "in order to support myself?"
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.400]   He's gone on to do exactly that over the last few years and work his way out of debt while
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.680]   traveling the world and adventuring with his family.
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.680]   It's well worth your time.
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:45.320]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.320]   My name is Joshua Sheets.
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.320]   I'm your host.
[00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.600]   Thank you for being with me today.
[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.800]   This is the show where we work hard to figure out ways to build, live, and enjoy a rich
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:59.240]   life today while also building a plan and following it, of course, and actually doing
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.160]   it, building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:15.480]   Today's interview perfectly encapsulates both of those points.
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.360]   My guest is Clark Van Deventer.
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.480]   He is author of the book Unworking.
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.800]   Clark, through a listener of the show who had introduced us via email and reached out
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.560]   to him, it sounded like an interesting story, so I reached out to him for an interview and
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.160]   he sent me a copy of his book.
[00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.560]   The book really touched me.
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.080]   Somehow I guess it just spoke to me in one of those ways that sometimes you read a book
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.000]   and it just speaks to you at a certain time.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.800]   It's almost like you have a conversation with the author at the appropriate time.
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.720]   You may pick up a book today and it doesn't mean anything to you.
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.160]   You pick it up a year from now and it, at that time, means something to you.
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.080]   I really enjoyed his book.
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.000]   In this interview, you're going to get a chance to meet the man behind the book.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.360]   He does have that fascinating story that I shared with you right at the beginning.
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.440]   It's well worth your time.
[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.340]   I feel like this interview brings out both of those themes that are so important to me
[00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.080]   and to this show going forward.
[00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:14.640]   Both of the themes meaning living a rich life today while also building a plan for financial
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.580]   freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:23.720]   How can we enjoy the meaningful life today, not sacrifice it all on the altar of tomorrow,
[00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:30.000]   but rather how can we have it today while also continually building for the future?
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.960]   You'll hear in Clark's story exactly how he and his family are doing that.
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:39.160]   I also love interviewing people like this on the show who are doing it with family,
[00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.560]   with kids.
[00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:47.000]   I hope you find a lot of inspiration and encouragement in the episode today.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.840]   Before I play it for you, sponsor of today's show is Paladin Registry.
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.200]   Paladin Registry is a financial advisor registry service.
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.200]   What works is this.
[00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.200]   You say, "Josh, I want a good financial advisor."
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.200]   I say, "Okay.
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:07.220]   I'm going to try to give you some good information so you can know when you find one, but how
[00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.220]   do I actually tell you how to find one?"
[00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:11.220]   It's not easy.
[00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:16.240]   So Paladin is my best solution that I've come up with at least so far to answer that question,
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:22.800]   which is simply how can we find some people who can vet and research financial advisors
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.160]   in advance and search and say, "Let's weed out the good ones.
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:32.400]   Let's pull out some advisors who aren't doing such a great job and trash them and at least
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.800]   get some applicants for you."
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.520]   They're applying for the job of being your financial advisor who are screened.
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.360]   Paladin Registry does just that.
[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.080]   So if you're looking for a financial advisor, if you'd like to speak with somebody, start
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.120]   your search at Paladin Registry.
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.280]   I don't promise that you're going to find your perfect advisor through them.
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:50.920]   I really don't.
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:56.120]   But I think it's at least a good place to start and it'll help you to get some multiple
[00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.400]   opinions and diverse opinions and it'll help you to at least have a little more confidence
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.280]   that that advisor has been a little bit screened.
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:08.240]   Go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/Paladin, P-A-L-A-D-I-N.
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:13.240]   That will automatically flip you through to a landing page, which you'll put in your information,
[00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:19.000]   put in your name, your phone number, your address, the amount of assets that you have,
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   things like that.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.920]   Then Paladin will take that information and they'll match you up with a few advisors there
[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:26.440]   in your local area, as long as they have somebody there in your local area.
[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.760]   Then they'll reach out to you and you can reconnect with them and interview them and
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:34.960]   see if they might be deserving of the job.
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.840]   That's up to you, but at least we can give you a good screening starting point.
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.000]   Here's Clark.
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.040]   Clark, welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:46.720]   Hey, it's great to be on the show.
[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:47.720]   Thanks for having me on.
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.080]   All right, here's the test.
[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:53.440]   You wrote a book called Unworking, Exit the Rat Race, Live Like a Millionaire and Be Happy
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:54.440]   Now.
[00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.840]   So, are you in the rat race?
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:01.440]   Are you living like a millionaire and are you happy today as we record this?
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:02.440]   Absolutely.
[00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:07.440]   Yeah, I was certainly long out of the rat race.
[00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:08.440]   Living like a millionaire.
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:15.480]   I've been told many times by people who are millionaires that they want to have my life
[00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:18.000]   and I sure am happy.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   I really am.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   Good, good.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.640]   It's February 9, 2016 as we record this.
[00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:25.160]   Are you living your Lake Tahoe lifestyle at the moment?
[00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.120]   I sure am.
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.360]   We've been here in Tahoe.
[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:35.640]   We had had a couple of years of what I call semi-nomadic living and had been in Tahoe
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:41.080]   last winter in a vacation, but this year I've kind of settled back in and gotten lots of
[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.960]   days on the slopes so far this year.
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:48.600]   After two consecutive summers away from Tahoe, I'm looking forward to being back here in
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:49.840]   the summer again this year too.
[00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:50.840]   Awesome.
[00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:51.840]   So, I jumped into the middle of the story.
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:07:00.260]   Why don't you start back and tell us the story of how you went from a fairly mainstream existence
[00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:05.120]   to a fairly non-mainstream existence with a special emphasis on how it relates to money.
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:06.120]   Sure.
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:13.840]   Well, five years ago, a little over five years ago, I guess six years ago now, my wife and
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:21.720]   I, we were, I guess you would say, living the dream in some ways.
[00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:33.120]   I had a career with Upward Trajectory and then I mounded a campaign for Congress.
[00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:41.200]   I actually didn't know at the time what a huge risk I was taking in running for Congress.
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:50.640]   The risk was not so much cashing out my retirement to run for Congress, cashed out my retirement
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:55.160]   so that I would have money for my family to live off of to allow me to be a candidate
[00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.080]   full time.
[00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:58.920]   That was not the risk.
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:05.440]   The risk was spending a year of my life without any irons in the fire.
[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:11.600]   As someone who has been self-employed for over eight years, you constantly have to be
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:13.440]   working on your next thing.
[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:15.320]   And I spent a year without working on my next thing.
[00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:21.440]   So, when I lost my election, not only was I out of money, but I didn't have anything
[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:23.520]   that was next.
[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:29.040]   And within two months of losing my campaign for Congress, I went from, I guess, a rising
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:34.880]   political star and candidate for Congress to moving my wife and then two kids into my
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:37.120]   in-laws' garage.
[00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:43.280]   And we were just totally, not only broke, but just simply broken.
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:49.240]   And in that garage, the one thing I did have was time with my family.
[00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:51.240]   And I began thinking, "How?
[00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:53.160]   I don't want to give this up."
[00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:57.400]   You know, I don't want to give up all this time I have with my family, but I also need
[00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:02.800]   to figure out how to get us out of this garage eventually and how to get back on our feet
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:03.800]   financially.
[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:08.540]   But I began to sense that the solution was not to go get a job.
[00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:15.760]   And so, at that time, my wife and I really began to say, "How can we make the money that
[00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:23.480]   we need to make and want to make, but not give up what we've come to value in our family
[00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:24.480]   time?"
[00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:30.200]   And so, at that point, we really began building our patchwork of income.
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:36.760]   And it's really income streams that are designed around the life that we want to live instead
[00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:42.040]   of getting a job and then buying the best life possible with the money that I make.
[00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:46.920]   So, on Radical Personal Finance, we talk a lot about financial freedom and financial
[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:52.120]   independence and specifically in trying to figure out ways to get out of the rat race.
[00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:57.080]   One of those methodologies is doing what you're doing, unworking, unjobbing, basically putting
[00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:02.840]   together a series of different sources of income that may be different at different
[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:06.520]   times of the year or just simply different smaller amounts of income that come from different
[00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:09.480]   sources in order to be able to sustain your living expenses.
[00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:14.120]   And it's one of the four primary methodologies of escaping the rat race.
[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:18.760]   I want to ask, though, isn't this a whole lot more stressful?
[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:24.280]   Because I'm an entrepreneur, and I'll tell you what, there are days that all I just want
[00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:25.880]   to do is go back and get a job.
[00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:28.960]   Don't you find this a lot more stressful than just working?
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:29.960]   Yeah.
[00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:35.640]   Sometimes I do think it would be a lot easier until I think about what I'd be giving up.
[00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:40.440]   And I will say that over time, when my wife and I really began working on our patchwork
[00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:45.800]   income approach, we had lots and lots of small patches.
[00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:49.360]   And there was a couple of years ago where we said, "You know what?
[00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:51.120]   Let's simplify this a little bit.
[00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:56.680]   Let's try to grow these two patches a little bit more and focus more of our income here
[00:10:56.680 --> 00:11:02.880]   and have maybe three or four medium-sized things instead of 12 small things because
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:05.880]   that's a lot easier to manage."
[00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:10.800]   But for me, one of the big things actually goes back to the garage.
[00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:13.680]   I remember there was a really low point.
[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:19.040]   And sure, my wife and I had been talking about trying to really design a different kind of
[00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:26.960]   life, but still, I struggled with waves of depression in the garage just thinking, "What
[00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:30.040]   the heck happened to my life?"
[00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:41.320]   And in one week, I got three phone calls from three really exciting job opportunities.
[00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:45.240]   Just really interesting, cool opportunities.
[00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:48.720]   And my mind went to work about how each of these, "Oh, it'd be so cool to take this
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:53.800]   one," or, "This one would be good," or, you know, they were all interesting.
[00:11:53.800 --> 00:12:01.960]   And then, I still don't know why, but all three of those opportunities just disappeared.
[00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:03.120]   You know, I tried to call them.
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:04.600]   They wouldn't call me back.
[00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:06.400]   I don't know what happened.
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:09.400]   But I remember thinking at that time, like, "Wow."
[00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:17.760]   It was a real wake-up call because I realized that if I had taken any one of those jobs,
[00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:23.280]   that my life and my well-being was going to be in someone else's hands.
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:25.760]   And I really, I wanted to turn the tables.
[00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:29.960]   I wanted to be in charge of my own life and not be dependent on a job.
[00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:35.520]   And a lot of times, as my wife and I have built up this patchwork income, I think there's
[00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:43.080]   this false notion that we are living on the edge and it's risky.
[00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:46.980]   You know, what we're doing as entrepreneurs and living differently.
[00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:52.120]   And somehow, this idea of getting a job is the secure, safe path.
[00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:56.880]   But to me, that is completely backwards.
[00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:04.080]   If I have a job and I'm dependent on one income stream, my job, for my family's well-being,
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:07.400]   well, I could lose that job tomorrow.
[00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:13.140]   But with patchwork income and having multiple income streams, let's say something happened.
[00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:19.880]   One of my larger patches, I'm a consultant to nonprofit organizations and major gifts
[00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:20.880]   fundraising.
[00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:24.880]   I'll go back to my background prior to running for Congress.
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:31.920]   Well, if something happened and I lost all my clients and all of a sudden that money
[00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:38.480]   was gone, even if that happened, we wouldn't be destitute because we have other income
[00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:41.160]   streams that we can rely on.
[00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:46.360]   It would maybe get tight for a while, but we could rely on those other income streams
[00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:50.320]   while we work to build up new ones or rebuild old ones.
[00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:58.840]   The idea is if diversification is such a good idea for retirement investing, why isn't diversification
[00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:01.720]   for income throughout all of life a good idea?
[00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:03.120]   I think it is.
[00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:10.280]   Lee Drexel When you went from having – let me rephrase
[00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:11.280]   the question differently.
[00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:16.920]   In your book, you talk about – in a place, you talk about that you had this prestigious
[00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:18.400]   job working for the Reagan Ranch.
[00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:25.480]   You were hobnobbing with the politicians and doing the whole high consumption, high status,
[00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:27.200]   lifestyle job.
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:32.360]   You had that status in your community and you had the status when you traveled and Mr.
[00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:33.640]   Important.
[00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:38.080]   And then you quit that job with the goal of buying a cafe.
[00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:42.640]   And you write a paragraph in your book that says this, "I felt I had to quit because
[00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:46.000]   my passion for the job just wasn't there anymore.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.920]   Sticking around just to collect a paycheck twice a month didn't seem right.
[00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:54.440]   I became convinced that if I stayed, I would become a shell of a man."
[00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:59.840]   Do you – this is a very – so I'm in your same generation and I haven't told you my
[00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:05.160]   story but in many ways, I've followed a similar path.
[00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:11.280]   And the note I wrote in my book next to that paragraph was I said this is a very millennial
[00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:12.280]   attitude.
[00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:17.160]   This idea of we're just going to go out and if I'm not passionate for the job, I'm
[00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:19.600]   not going to stick to it.
[00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:20.960]   Did you struggle a little?
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:26.600]   I mean, did you struggle with the idea of doing something for the sake of doing it?
[00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:31.680]   Do you feel like everything has to be around this sense of passion that if I somehow don't
[00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:35.680]   have a passion for it that I have to do it?
[00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:40.440]   What role does character and what role does just simply fulfilling family responsibilities
[00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:42.880]   play in your thinking?
[00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:47.600]   It's secondary.
[00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:55.680]   So while financial considerations came up as I prepared to leave my job, it was secondary
[00:15:55.680 --> 00:16:01.400]   to am I doing what I'm supposed to be doing with my life.
[00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:06.620]   The night before I quit my job at the Riggin Ranch, my wife and I were talking.
[00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:10.800]   My boss was flying in from Washington DC the next day and I was going to have dinner with
[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:15.000]   him that night to let him know my decision.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.680]   And my wife and I were talking and I said, "I don't know.
[00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:20.680]   Should I do this?
[00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:23.440]   Should I go through with this?"
[00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:25.840]   And she said, "Well, what do you mean?"
[00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:29.280]   And I said, "Well, what if we can't make the money?"
[00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:34.760]   And she said, "If it's the money, quit."
[00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:39.720]   She said, "If there's other reasons you're thinking about staying, you should stay and
[00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:40.720]   sort through those.
[00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:44.160]   But if it's just the money, you should quit."
[00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:48.000]   And that was obviously a huge and powerful moment for me.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:55.520]   But I think that the world collectively is poorer than it should be because people have
[00:16:55.520 --> 00:17:02.040]   settled for less than work that they love or work that they're called to or work that
[00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:03.920]   they're passionate about.
[00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:14.200]   And I think that if more of us chose to actually pursue life calling, pursue the things that
[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:20.480]   we're most passionate about, I think the world would just be collectively so much richer.
[00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:27.000]   And so I think for me, there's a faith aspect in terms of really feeling for me at that
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:32.360]   time that God was leading me in a certain direction.
[00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:39.240]   I don't mean to go super spiritual, but I really felt like God wanted me to lead.
[00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:50.120]   I had written in my journal months earlier that I wrote that I had this increasing belief
[00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:52.680]   that I wasn't where I was supposed to be.
[00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:59.160]   And I can't imagine going back and reading that now and still being in the same place.
[00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:05.640]   I just sucked it up and continued to trudge along through life.
[00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:11.800]   And even when I was leaving my job to buy the cafe, that didn't work.
[00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:16.200]   This was right at the beginning of the financial meltdown, the Great Recession.
[00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:21.520]   And I think a good friend who worked in finance who I think understood, knew before I did
[00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:26.720]   that the cafe deal was not going to come together.
[00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:31.240]   He called me a couple of days before I quit my job and he said, "Clark, here's the deal.
[00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:35.640]   Let's just say that the cafe is not going to work out.
[00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:39.280]   Would you still quit?"
[00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:44.960]   And my answer was yes, because I really had this sense that I needed to move on.
[00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:46.640]   I needed to do something different.
[00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:56.260]   And yeah, just trudging along and putting my nose to the grindstone and all those analogies
[00:18:56.260 --> 00:19:01.520]   you could use, I felt like I was going to be a shell of a man if I just kept doing that.
[00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:02.520]   It's interesting.
[00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:09.160]   Now, I think sometimes it can be a useful exercise to go through and say, "Which bad
[00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:13.360]   option are you not okay with?"
[00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:17.760]   With my personal story, I closed a successful financial planning practice in order to start
[00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:19.840]   radical personal finance.
[00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:24.360]   And when I did that, I had thought it through and I had a lot of reasons.
[00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:33.840]   But ultimately, the question that swayed me was this question, "Would I rather try it,
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:38.600]   take this leap, make this decision that doesn't seem to be the thoughtful, careful one?
[00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:43.600]   Would I rather try it, fail, lose everything and start again?
[00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:48.040]   Or would I rather not try it, continue doing what I'm doing now, and then always wonder
[00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:49.040]   what if?"
[00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:56.920]   I came to the position where I feared the regret of not trying it more than I feared
[00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:59.920]   the pain of potential failure.
[00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:04.120]   That's such a great way of putting it.
[00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:11.320]   And the thing is, having gone through the experience and actually having lost everything,
[00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:16.040]   for me, the conclusion is, "Well, geez, losing everything wasn't that bad."
[00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:20.120]   Now, sure, there were dark moments along the way.
[00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:30.480]   But for me, the beauty of having risked it all in one turn of pitch and toss is because
[00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:40.680]   I failed and have come through, I have, in a sense, been freed from the fear of failure.
[00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:46.020]   Because I've lost everything and losing everything wasn't that bad, I feel this freedom and
[00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:54.280]   life to take risks and to go for it that I don't think I could have ever experienced
[00:20:54.280 --> 00:21:04.160]   if I hadn't, as you so well put it, realized that I would rather try and fail than to have
[00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:05.160]   not tried at all.
[00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:11.960]   What was the most difficult part of financial failure for you?
[00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:15.800]   Shame.
[00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:26.800]   Really feeling like I wasn't who I had told people I was or people had come to think of
[00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:27.800]   who I was.
[00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:35.560]   And as I talk about in my book, I really retreated from a lot of relationships.
[00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:41.400]   Many people did not know, many very good friends who had been friends for a long time, didn't
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:46.480]   know that I had lived in my in-laws' garage until well after we had moved out.
[00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:53.480]   And I had begun blogging at FamilyTrek.org and published a blog post about what had happened.
[00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:56.600]   And people were like, "I had no idea."
[00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:59.800]   Because I really just retreated.
[00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:02.960]   And that was really hard.
[00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:12.720]   You talk in the book about the impact of money on being able to build the life of your dreams.
[00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:19.200]   And by the way, I asked you a bunch of antagonistic questions, but I really have loved the book.
[00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:22.240]   I don't feel like, to me, they're not antagonistic.
[00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:23.840]   I get these questions all the time.
[00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:31.320]   I try to ask questions, difficult ones, that I think many listeners are probably thinking.
[00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:35.280]   But about 65% of the way through the book, and I found myself highlighting extensive
[00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:36.680]   passages.
[00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:42.880]   And I really resonated in many ways with your story because it expresses a lot of the lessons
[00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:47.240]   that I've learned more than probably anybody else or more than many other books.
[00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:51.440]   I just resonated with your personal path.
[00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:57.000]   But you made a comment in here that I underlined and highlighted and said – and it's this.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.280]   Most people get the highest-paying job possible and then figure out how to arrange their life.
[00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:07.280]   And then they get a job and then buy a life commensurate to their income level.
[00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:11.480]   To these people, one's lifestyle is determined by how much money they have.
[00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:18.480]   I suggest that you not arrange your life around a job, but that you arrange your life around
[00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:20.040]   what you value most.
[00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:23.840]   Get a job that fits your life, not a life that fits your job.
[00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:26.280]   Why is this such a countercultural message?
[00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:32.120]   Gosh, that's a really good question.
[00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:39.320]   It's just not the way we've been taught.
[00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:44.640]   I do think there's a change that's slowly developing.
[00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:53.160]   If you go back to our grandparents, our grandparents, if they got a job, it was assumed that they
[00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:58.280]   would have that job forever.
[00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:01.120]   The employers took care of the employees.
[00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:06.200]   Oftentimes, if there was a new baby in the family, the person would get a raise.
[00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:08.960]   And that was normal.
[00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:16.040]   If you go to our parents' generation, our parents went to work assuming that they would
[00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:18.200]   work there forever.
[00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:24.520]   And then when that didn't happen, there was a bitterness that grew.
[00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:28.680]   And I think in our parents' generation, in terms of like, they had this assumption that
[00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:32.860]   they were going to work for this company forever, be taken care of, but the employers had no
[00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:36.920]   longer viewed employees as family.
[00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:42.800]   They were really renting employees, not bringing on family.
[00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:49.680]   I think what's happening now with the, I hate the word millennial, and I'm a little, I think
[00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:51.760]   too old to be a millennial actually.
[00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:59.160]   But I think what's happening now is that employees have turned the table and they're now renting
[00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:00.160]   jobs.
[00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:04.360]   So it's actually a quite fair and even relationship.
[00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:08.600]   Employers bring employees on without any expectation that they'll be there forever.
[00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:12.520]   Employees take a job without any expectation that they'll be there forever.
[00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:17.000]   And I think you're seeing a lot of people come and go from jobs a lot more quickly because
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   of that.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:29.480]   But this way of thinking in terms of lifestyle over money is just not what our parents' generation
[00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:30.480]   thought.
[00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:37.880]   It was put your head down until you're 65 and you've saved enough money.
[00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:46.120]   And the sad thing is that that generation is turning 65 now and all the things that
[00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:50.440]   they thought they were working towards their entire life, they're not there.
[00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:55.240]   They don't have the financial security they thought they would have.
[00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:59.840]   And of course there's no guarantees that we'll even get there.
[00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:03.800]   As I talk about in my book, there's an example.
[00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:12.000]   I met with a man who I'd known for a number of years and his wife had just been diagnosed
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.520]   with Alzheimer's disease.
[00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:21.480]   And he said to me, "You know Clark, I wish I had just retired two years earlier so I
[00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:26.640]   could have had those two years with her before the disease started to take her away."
[00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:29.520]   And I just remember thinking at the time, "Two years?
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:31.640]   Are you kidding me?
[00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:34.040]   I wish I'd lived my whole life differently."
[00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:45.240]   So put aside the financial issues, there's no guarantee that even if we managed to just
[00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:53.840]   do the right thing, the dutiful thing, and work all of our life and save all this money,
[00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:55.000]   that could all happen.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:04.240]   And then your spouse could get a terrible disease or you could not make it yourself.
[00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:10.880]   And so it just seems like a backwards way of thinking to me.
[00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:19.360]   But I think that things are changing, that this younger generation is beginning to put
[00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:21.480]   priorities on some different things.
[00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:24.120]   It's definitely a major change.
[00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:27.320]   I've wondered a lot about the influences and reasons why.
[00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:31.560]   Maybe it's just that our parents probably raised this saying, "You can do whatever
[00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:32.560]   you want to do.
[00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:34.000]   You can be who you want to be."
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.560]   And some of us, I don't know why, some of us believe them.
[00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:40.760]   And then we look around and say, "Wait a second, I'm not doing what I want to do
[00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:42.760]   and I'm not being who I want to be.
[00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:44.000]   So let me make some changes."
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:55.920]   Well, I think also, my parents, I think, for example, they just think I'm crazy.
[00:27:55.920 --> 00:28:02.040]   And they, I think, wish that I were still a big, important person.
[00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:13.160]   And it's like, well, by my definition of success, I'm as or more successful than
[00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:15.560]   I was when I had the big job.
[00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:17.880]   Because I have achieved relative success.
[00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:19.160]   I'm not where I want to be.
[00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:25.200]   I've achieved relative success, though, on a path that I've chosen to go down.
[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:32.960]   And I think it's difficult for my parents to, because they want to be able to be proud
[00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:37.000]   and say, "Well, my son is the deputy director of the Reagan Ranch."
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.560]   And that sounds like a really important job.
[00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:43.680]   But they don't know what to say about me now.
[00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:49.400]   It's like, "Well, he's living in Tahoe and he skis and, you know, just, okay, what's
[00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:50.400]   his job?"
[00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:55.080]   Well, I don't even know what his job is, really.
[00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:58.960]   I think they're looking for something to hang their hat on, where I'm quite content
[00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:02.600]   to ski and take off to Thailand for three months.
[00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:08.960]   - I think the social ties and the social influences are definitely one of the biggest things that
[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:13.960]   keeps people from pursuing alternative paths of life.
[00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:17.640]   I've gone through, I guess, three major social transitions.
[00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:21.920]   Number one, in terms of the prestige of your job.
[00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:26.480]   When I graduated from college, I was working at a market research company.
[00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:31.600]   And I was basically a low and mid, lower mid-level, entry-level analyst.
[00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:37.840]   But based upon the title of my job position and based upon the projects that I was working
[00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:42.680]   on, I could certainly spin my job to sound very impressive.
[00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:46.400]   Because we worked with a lot of Fortune 500 clients and I was always working on some interesting
[00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:47.960]   work in the marketing space.
[00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:53.400]   And it would seem very, very impressive to somebody from the outside.
[00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:57.920]   But the reality of it was I was thankful to have the work, I was thankful to have the
[00:29:57.920 --> 00:29:59.440]   employment.
[00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:02.680]   But the day-to-day functioning of it was not a good fit for me.
[00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:09.040]   Pouring through Excel spreadsheets, pulling out marketing insights based upon the response
[00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:14.000]   of consumers didn't necessarily fit my idea of a great life.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.840]   But it sounded prestigious.
[00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:17.320]   It sounded impressive.
[00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:21.080]   And I would go on business trips and fly into places and you fly in and you get the little
[00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:25.120]   black car from the executive shuttle service and you feel like a big shot on some of those
[00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:26.120]   things.
[00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:30.960]   I went from that to selling life insurance, which life insurance sales is probably – life
[00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:35.800]   insurance and my buddies in the car sales business is one of the least prestigious jobs
[00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:36.800]   ever.
[00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:42.560]   But the reality of the lifestyle is far better in terms of I've got total flexibility of
[00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:47.200]   time, massive income potential, the ability to do work that I cared about.
[00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:50.560]   And so socially though, it's not an acceptable social change.
[00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:52.880]   But the reality is it was a much better change.
[00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:57.360]   Well, built that up and then I moved into the investments business and then I had all
[00:30:57.360 --> 00:31:00.640]   these letters behind my name and I had all the social prestige back again.
[00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:04.000]   I wasn't just the lowly life insurance salesperson.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:09.080]   And then I closed that to go out and do this weird internet thing.
[00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:14.040]   But I'll tell you, when it comes down to having a clear vision for your life, I'm
[00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:17.200]   living the best lifestyle I've ever lived.
[00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:22.600]   But I walked away from the BMWs and the Mercedes and all of my other financial advisors who
[00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:24.880]   said, "Joshua, what on earth are you doing?"
[00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:26.720]   And I was always kind of the odd duck.
[00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:34.240]   But to me, those things, those external factors were not important to me.
[00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:39.400]   What I wanted to do was to have my day go through – I wanted to go through my day
[00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:43.300]   based upon my own vision of how a day should run, not based upon what I needed to do to
[00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:45.260]   impress other people.
[00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:50.940]   But I'll tell you, it's hard and there are still times where those social pressures
[00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:53.780]   still press in on you.
[00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:56.200]   The social pressures are the biggest challenge that we face.
[00:31:56.200 --> 00:32:04.360]   Yeah, I think one important thing to clarify here though is that, at least for me, one
[00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:09.760]   thing I talk about in my book is, look, I'm not saying live like me.
[00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:19.840]   I'm not saying if you drive a BMW and you have all the expensive toys and all, I'm
[00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:21.840]   not saying there's anything wrong with that.
[00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:26.280]   I'm saying that most people have never thought about what they really want.
[00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:28.400]   They're not actually living by design.
[00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:30.960]   They're just following the crowd.
[00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:36.840]   And I think the important thing is to step back and go, "Does my life really line up
[00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:40.560]   with the things that I say that I value most?"
[00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:46.860]   One exercise I have in the book, a very practical one, is make a list of the four or five things
[00:32:46.860 --> 00:32:52.240]   in your life that you say are most important to you and then look at your budget.
[00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:59.360]   If the top four or five things that you say are most valuable to you don't show up as
[00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:05.920]   the top line items in your budget, that means that you're spending your life energy.
[00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:10.040]   All that money we make, we've just traded our time to get.
[00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:14.840]   So if the top items in your budget don't line up with the things that you say you value
[00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:19.000]   most, it means you're spending your life energy on things that ultimately don't matter to
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.560]   you.
[00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:27.320]   And then another way of looking at it for me is if my goal is to ski 50 days a year
[00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:33.640]   and to be able to travel extensively, it doesn't matter how much money you're going to pay
[00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:34.640]   me.
[00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:39.320]   If you want to pay me half a million dollars a year, a million dollars a year, but I have
[00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:45.640]   to move to Washington DC and I have to work 50 weeks a year and be on call and work 12
[00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:50.160]   hour days, it doesn't matter how much money you're going to pay me, that money doesn't
[00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:53.560]   help me achieve what I want in life.
[00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:57.560]   And so going back to the quote that you read from my book earlier about how most people
[00:33:57.560 --> 00:34:05.880]   just get the highest paying job possible and then buy a life with that money, no, that's
[00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:07.060]   not what we should be doing.
[00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:09.880]   We should be saying what do I want in life?
[00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:12.080]   What do I want life to look like?
[00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:17.680]   Okay now that I've figured that out, now I'll figure out how to make the money I need to
[00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:18.680]   have that kind of life.
[00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:24.800]   I got to ask, and this is one of my biggest questions throughout the book, you're describing
[00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:27.640]   a lifestyle that doesn't necessarily cost very much.
[00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:32.760]   How on earth do you afford to buy lift tickets to ski 60 days a year?
[00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:36.320]   Well you know one of the great secrets of the ski industry is that buying seats and
[00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:39.360]   passes is not expensive.
[00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:49.400]   So a season pass to, well like a Tahoe Epic Pass, so it gives you access to three incredible
[00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:52.280]   mountains, Heavenly, North Star, and Kirkwood.
[00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:57.480]   You're looking at 10,000 acres of skiable terrain.
[00:34:57.480 --> 00:35:05.760]   You can get that depending on the blackout days that you want for $450, $475.
[00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:06.760]   So let's just say it's $500.
[00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:13.200]   Well if I'm skiing 50 days a year, that's $10 a day.
[00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:17.760]   Now I always feel sorry for the people who show up and want to buy a single day lift
[00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:18.880]   ticket.
[00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:22.120]   Single day lift tickets are $119 or something.
[00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:28.280]   But yeah it's a lot cheaper to live in the mountains than it is to visit them.
[00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:33.440]   In your book you talk about the three tenets that you and your wife developed that fit
[00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:37.680]   your financial vision, which are number one, get out of debt, number two, keep our expenses
[00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:43.000]   low, and number three, only take on work that is location independent.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:48.280]   Where do those come from and why are they so key to you fulfilling your vision for your
[00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:49.280]   life?
[00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:53.560]   Well first, get out of debt.
[00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:57.160]   I know that we're in tandem on this one.
[00:35:57.160 --> 00:36:00.840]   It's an anchor, something that's holding you back.
[00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:08.680]   If you have debt, you're paying for either yesterday's visions or yesterday's mistakes.
[00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:12.520]   Getting out of debt was a big priority for us.
[00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:14.240]   I'll confess we're not there yet.
[00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:17.120]   We still have student loan debt.
[00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:21.920]   But getting out of debt was and continues to be a big priority for us.
[00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:24.680]   Second, keeping our expenses low.
[00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:27.680]   It just allows us to be nimble.
[00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:36.240]   When I was, as you said, I can't remember how you phrase it exactly, like high income,
[00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:43.760]   high expense, when I was at the Reagan Ranch, my monthly, the nut that I had to crack just
[00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:54.080]   to pay the mortgage, utilities, insurance, you know, the basic things, was $10,000.
[00:36:54.080 --> 00:37:02.400]   I had to bring in $10,000 every month before I could even think about going out for coffee.
[00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:04.400]   And I just wasn't nimble.
[00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:14.520]   Now by having our expenses low, I'm much more nimble and can turn on a dime in a way that
[00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:18.880]   I never could have when our expenses were high.
[00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:20.520]   And then third, location independent.
[00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:23.720]   We just love to travel.
[00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:25.840]   We love being in Lake Tahoe now.
[00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:33.160]   But over the past couple of years, we've taken two six-week long trips to Central America.
[00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:36.560]   We did a two-month cross-country road trip.
[00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:39.960]   We spent three months in Thailand.
[00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:43.720]   And these are life experiences that just mean a lot to us.
[00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:45.880]   It's one thing that we value.
[00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:50.080]   And if we took on work that was not location independent, we would have to give up those
[00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:51.080]   things.
[00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:58.120]   And because travel and seeing the world is a priority for us, this was one more thing
[00:37:58.120 --> 00:38:05.440]   that we had to put into our kind of, you know, the work we take on has to fit within these
[00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:06.440]   things.
[00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:08.440]   Some people may not care about travel.
[00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:13.640]   So they wouldn't have to have that, you know, as one of their tenets for income.
[00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:19.800]   Wouldn't it make more sense, you said you still have student loans and you went from
[00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:24.000]   a place of being totally broke and in debt, wouldn't it have made a lot more sense for
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:30.920]   you to have used the connections and the status and the reputation that you developed to get
[00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:37.480]   a job as a consultant, earn a lot of money for a few years, pay off your debt, save a
[00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:42.120]   lot of money and have a greater financial cushion underneath rather than to try to put
[00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:44.040]   together this patchwork income?
[00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:45.240]   Wouldn't that make more sense?
[00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:46.240]   No.
[00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:47.720]   Why not?
[00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:52.680]   Because for two reasons, number one, I don't know.
[00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:57.840]   And this may sound fatalistic or may sound dramatic, but number one, I don't know that
[00:38:57.840 --> 00:39:00.040]   I have tomorrow.
[00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:04.680]   You know, and I talk in the book about an experience my wife and I had actually in our
[00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:11.920]   first date where, you know, we very likely could have died.
[00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:20.260]   So maybe that's dramatic, but the other point is that my son is eight now.
[00:39:20.260 --> 00:39:22.600]   My three-year-old son is gone forever.
[00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:25.120]   He'll never be back.
[00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:30.080]   And I can never get these years with my kids back.
[00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:38.720]   So I have in some ways chosen, I thought, what I really came to was I would rather work
[00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:43.960]   less in these years when my kids are young and actually maybe work a little bit more
[00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:49.800]   when they're 15 or 20 years old and less dependent on me.
[00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:53.480]   Now maybe the older version of Clark will regret that decision.
[00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:55.600]   It's possible.
[00:39:55.600 --> 00:40:04.840]   But I just have this real, I had this realization that the years that my kids were young were
[00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:09.200]   fleeting and I didn't want to be absent those years.
[00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:10.200]   I wanted to be present.
[00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:14.640]   It was a big thing that hung over me when we lived in the garage.
[00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:19.520]   My son at the time was three and my daughter was six months.
[00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:24.480]   And she slept in a crib a few feet away from us.
[00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:32.000]   And I remember every morning she'd wake up and she'd be stirring and kind of trying to
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   get my attention.
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:36.640]   And every morning when I put my feet on the floor, she would clap because I was getting
[00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:37.920]   up.
[00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:42.080]   And I remember thinking I have no money and I live in my in-laws garage but my daughter
[00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:45.160]   still claps for me when I get out of bed.
[00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:50.280]   And during that time with them, I just realized I go back to the grind.
[00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:54.560]   If I just go make money, I'm going to miss this.
[00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:58.440]   And to me, it wasn't worth missing.
[00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:04.360]   Ted Keller: How did you deal with that within the context of your relationship with your
[00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:05.360]   wife?
[00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:11.560]   I know for a lot of husbands, that's a major challenge to say, "I need to support my family."
[00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:18.320]   And frankly, if I were living in a garage with my in-laws, I'd feel a little bit selfish
[00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:20.720]   about the idea of me chasing my dreams.
[00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:25.960]   At the end of the day, I didn't sign up just to live a life that was just focused on me.
[00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:32.560]   When I married, I became one with my wife and that means that it's no longer me, it's
[00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:33.560]   we.
[00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:40.280]   And so I've got to make sure that I'm taking care of the commitments that I've made and
[00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:43.960]   me living out my dreams is not the most important commitment.
[00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:46.480]   How did you deal with that in your relationship with your wife?
[00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:53.200]   David Bonilla: Well, for us, it was almost the opposite in the sense that when I was
[00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:59.240]   ready to take a job in the garage, my wife wasn't.
[00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:05.000]   I think she understood before I did that for us to build the kind of life that we really
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:11.200]   wanted to have, the solution was for me to not get a job.
[00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:17.640]   And I've always said that the great gift my in-laws gave me, it was not a garage.
[00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:22.520]   It was not just a roof over our family's head.
[00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:29.960]   The great gift they gave me was time because we were able to live with them.
[00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:37.520]   We lived in the garage for six months and then I spent another three or four months
[00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:43.680]   in a cabin in Lake Tahoe that my wife's grandfather owned rent-free.
[00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:51.800]   That time that we had, if I didn't have the family connections, I would have been forced
[00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:55.240]   to take anything.
[00:42:55.240 --> 00:43:01.040]   But because I had family supporting me, we were able to not just be desperate but to
[00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:02.960]   build by design.
[00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:08.960]   And I think this is actually a topic I want to take on in a second book.
[00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:18.080]   I think there's something to be said for these family connections in terms of supporting
[00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:26.000]   one another and empowering other people in our family to be there.
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:30.920]   Looking back at the time, moving in with my in-laws was such a shameful thing.
[00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:34.080]   And now I'm like, "It was awesome."
[00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:38.960]   And I think about my kids having lived with grandma and grandpa, what a rich time that
[00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:39.960]   was for them.
[00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:44.000]   And we still go back and spend, because we're location independent, we still go back and
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:49.800]   spend a couple of weeks or a month at a time with the in-laws.
[00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:57.480]   And I think we really need to do away with this idea that it's shameful that we go back
[00:43:57.480 --> 00:44:00.560]   and live with your in-laws.
[00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:05.800]   If you could live with your in-laws and use that time to build something meaningful and
[00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:09.040]   lasting, that shouldn't be a shameful thing.
[00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:14.720]   And my wife really was on board with that idea before I was.
[00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:19.040]   I think it was much harder for me living there than it was for her.
[00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:22.920]   And that may make sense in some ways.
[00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:29.720]   But she's always been right along with me in terms of this lifestyle design.
[00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:38.920]   And there's never been this, like I'm dragging her down this path or whatever.
[00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:40.960]   My wife and I really are partners.
[00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:47.920]   And whether it's our ideas about Pat's work income or living location independently or
[00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:53.800]   ideas about how we're raising our children or school choices we've made, sometimes people
[00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:57.000]   ask us, "Well, who had the idea first?"
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:01.360]   And my wife and I have no idea who had the idea first.
[00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:07.680]   These are decisions that we arrive at very slowly and we do it together by living a shared
[00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:12.360]   life and lots of wine.
[00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:18.000]   Good releases the tongue sometimes.
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   Yeah.
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:26.480]   I can't tell you how many long, long, long, long talks we've had.
[00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:29.240]   It's never been any animosity.
[00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:33.720]   It's just like we're constantly talking about what we want.
[00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:43.280]   And by talking together, we continue to remain close and really of one mind despite radical
[00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:49.880]   changes in our life since we were married.
[00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:55.640]   What do you actually do to earn income to support your family now?
[00:45:55.640 --> 00:45:59.080]   We have a few patches.
[00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:07.640]   One and really our biggest patch is that I'm a consultant to non-profit organizations and
[00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:08.640]   major gifts fundraising.
[00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:14.800]   So a lot of my work actually I do Skype calls with fundraisers for these organizations when
[00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:18.040]   I'm coaching them and working through these issues with them.
[00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:23.720]   And then I do travel to meet with these groups and things like that.
[00:46:23.720 --> 00:46:31.120]   So in that sense, maybe I'm not entirely location independent and then I have to jump on a plane
[00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:37.040]   to be somewhere occasionally, but it's never been an issue for us.
[00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:42.080]   So I'll fly to Washington DC and spend a week in Washington DC or something.
[00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:45.960]   We're also credit card processing reps.
[00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:53.580]   So we have a company that we work with that provide all those terminals that you see at
[00:46:53.580 --> 00:46:57.160]   your favorite restaurant and coffee shop or whatever.
[00:46:57.160 --> 00:47:06.080]   If you go into by lunch at a restaurant here in Lake Tahoe and you charge $30, my wife
[00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:09.720]   and I will make maybe 50 cents on that transaction.
[00:47:09.720 --> 00:47:11.920]   But we do that a lot.
[00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:16.400]   It's a numbers game in terms of having volume as you know, your background.
[00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:21.600]   But that is great income for us because it's both passive and residual.
[00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:28.020]   We did a lot of work up front to build up that income base and now do very little work,
[00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:30.360]   maybe a few hours a month.
[00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:33.140]   And then that money just keeps rolling in.
[00:47:33.140 --> 00:47:36.940]   And then we have some smaller patches that we are developing.
[00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:43.420]   We have a website called TahoeSkiBum.com which is all about, as you would probably imagine,
[00:47:43.420 --> 00:47:44.420]   skiing and riding.
[00:47:44.420 --> 00:47:46.420]   Lake Tahoe, we built a pretty big audience.
[00:47:46.420 --> 00:47:49.780]   We're working to monetize the site.
[00:47:49.780 --> 00:47:54.420]   It's a very small patch right now but one that we think will be bigger.
[00:47:54.420 --> 00:48:02.940]   And my wife also designs websites, does business consulting, does mobile apps, lots of little
[00:48:02.940 --> 00:48:05.900]   things sort of around e-commerce and the web.
[00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:08.860]   So those are our patches as they are right now.
[00:48:08.860 --> 00:48:15.900]   And then there's lots of smaller ones, freelance writing that I do and other things.
[00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:17.580]   But those are the big ones.
[00:48:17.580 --> 00:48:23.860]   How do you fit your kids into a location independent lifestyle?
[00:48:23.860 --> 00:48:34.100]   Well, they come with us.
[00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:38.140]   For us, our bases really are Santa Barbara and Lake Tahoe.
[00:48:38.140 --> 00:48:39.140]   That's where their friends are.
[00:48:39.140 --> 00:48:42.140]   Those are the places we keep coming back to.
[00:48:42.140 --> 00:48:50.580]   And it's great to have been on the road for three months and to come home and immediately
[00:48:50.580 --> 00:48:56.800]   fall back into the same friendships and the same routines that we were in just before.
[00:48:56.800 --> 00:49:01.860]   Our kids have been traveling really since they were born.
[00:49:01.860 --> 00:49:05.940]   So for them, this is largely normal.
[00:49:05.940 --> 00:49:15.820]   At the end, this would have been March of '14, is when we moved out of our long-term
[00:49:15.820 --> 00:49:22.300]   lease that we'd had in Lake Tahoe, put all of our stuff in storage and began traveling
[00:49:22.300 --> 00:49:26.300]   for a couple of years.
[00:49:26.300 --> 00:49:29.700]   And it was kind of interesting how that worked out.
[00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:35.660]   Really all of us at the same time, me, my wife, and our kids were all craving being
[00:49:35.660 --> 00:49:42.460]   off the road and to kind of push pause and travel and come back to Tahoe and settle in
[00:49:42.460 --> 00:49:44.940]   for a while.
[00:49:44.940 --> 00:49:49.500]   And I think that was important to the kids, but it was important to us.
[00:49:49.500 --> 00:49:52.700]   It was kind of interesting how we all arrived at that point together.
[00:49:52.700 --> 00:49:54.900]   But our kids love to travel.
[00:49:54.900 --> 00:49:57.100]   I think they'd love to be at Grandma's house more.
[00:49:57.100 --> 00:50:03.020]   But it's interesting with them, too, the sense of pride that they have when they talk
[00:50:03.020 --> 00:50:06.140]   to people about where they've been.
[00:50:06.140 --> 00:50:09.780]   If you think about it, when you're six years old and you tell someone, "Well, I've been
[00:50:09.780 --> 00:50:13.620]   to Thailand," or some other side of the world, and the reaction they get from grown-ups is
[00:50:13.620 --> 00:50:16.260]   like, "Wow, you've been to Thailand?
[00:50:16.260 --> 00:50:20.340]   What does that do for my daughter's self-esteem?"
[00:50:20.340 --> 00:50:24.820]   That's the way people react to her when she says, "Yeah, I've been to Guatemala and I've
[00:50:24.820 --> 00:50:28.820]   been to Panama," and all these other places.
[00:50:28.820 --> 00:50:33.580]   The reactions that she gets are interesting.
[00:50:33.580 --> 00:50:36.380]   How do you handle their education on the road?
[00:50:36.380 --> 00:50:42.140]   Well, we've always homeschooled our kids.
[00:50:42.140 --> 00:50:46.380]   I don't like to call it homeschool.
[00:50:46.380 --> 00:50:47.380]   It's funny.
[00:50:47.380 --> 00:50:49.380]   When my kids were born, you should have seen them.
[00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:50.380]   They didn't know anything.
[00:50:50.380 --> 00:50:53.180]   They didn't know how to talk.
[00:50:53.180 --> 00:50:56.940]   They pooped their pants.
[00:50:56.940 --> 00:50:59.820]   So we've been homeschooling them, if you will, or educating them from the day they
[00:50:59.820 --> 00:51:00.820]   were born.
[00:51:00.820 --> 00:51:08.500]   That's just continued as they've reached school age.
[00:51:08.500 --> 00:51:10.940]   We call it hack-schooling, what we do.
[00:51:10.940 --> 00:51:17.460]   There's an unschooling movement that we've been heavily influenced by, but we also bring
[00:51:17.460 --> 00:51:26.020]   in more traditional schooling elements into our education with our kids.
[00:51:26.020 --> 00:51:29.100]   It's very organic.
[00:51:29.100 --> 00:51:33.020]   What you said earlier, wouldn't it be easier to just go get a job?
[00:51:33.020 --> 00:51:35.220]   Sometimes I feel that way about school.
[00:51:35.220 --> 00:51:44.980]   So take this experience we had in Bangkok, where when we were in Bangkok, we couldn't
[00:51:44.980 --> 00:51:51.260]   get on the BTS Skytrain, their metro that goes all around the city, until a few things
[00:51:51.260 --> 00:51:52.260]   happened.
[00:51:52.260 --> 00:51:55.660]   The kids had to read the map and figure out where we were.
[00:51:55.660 --> 00:51:58.580]   At the time, the kids were six and four.
[00:51:58.580 --> 00:52:04.100]   Then we had our baby with us, but we didn't require this of her.
[00:52:04.100 --> 00:52:07.300]   But the six and four-year-old, before we could get on the train, they had to figure out where
[00:52:07.300 --> 00:52:15.180]   we were, where we were going, how much money it would cost, multiply that by four, go take
[00:52:15.180 --> 00:52:24.460]   our cash money to the attendant, get the coins, and then get the tickets that we needed.
[00:52:24.460 --> 00:52:31.900]   So a process that could have taken me all of 30 seconds would take us as a family 10
[00:52:31.900 --> 00:52:35.700]   minutes, or 20 minutes.
[00:52:35.700 --> 00:52:40.460]   And it would have been so much easier to put my kids in school and not worry about this
[00:52:40.460 --> 00:52:43.500]   moment at the BTS Skytrain in Bangkok.
[00:52:43.500 --> 00:52:44.780]   But look at what my kids did there.
[00:52:44.780 --> 00:52:45.780]   They read maps.
[00:52:45.780 --> 00:52:47.540]   They did math.
[00:52:47.540 --> 00:52:52.220]   They had to work with someone, the attendant, to accomplish their goals.
[00:52:52.220 --> 00:52:57.340]   And so this has sort of been our approach to education over the years.
[00:52:57.340 --> 00:53:02.700]   And it's incredibly fulfilling and completely exhausting.
[00:53:02.700 --> 00:53:06.780]   So even like I say, I don't like to term homeschool because it implies that we do school at home,
[00:53:06.780 --> 00:53:07.780]   which we don't.
[00:53:07.780 --> 00:53:15.100]   Yeah, in some ways, I think it would be easier if we just sat down every day and did school
[00:53:15.100 --> 00:53:19.420]   at home from 10 to 2 or whatever.
[00:53:19.420 --> 00:53:24.700]   But no, it's like for us, education is every moment of every day.
[00:53:24.700 --> 00:53:27.060]   And it can be exhausting.
[00:53:27.060 --> 00:53:31.340]   Having said all that, now that we're back in Tahoe, my daughter really wanted to go
[00:53:31.340 --> 00:53:32.500]   to kindergarten.
[00:53:32.500 --> 00:53:35.340]   So she's actually enrolled in kindergarten now.
[00:53:35.340 --> 00:53:43.620]   But my eight-year-old son and my almost three-year-old daughter now just continue to go through
[00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:44.620]   life with us.
[00:53:44.620 --> 00:53:54.540]   Do you have thoughts on whether and how they will pursue perhaps a similar career strategy
[00:53:54.540 --> 00:53:55.540]   to you?
[00:53:55.540 --> 00:54:01.420]   What I mean is there's lots of people who make very cutting-edge decisions for themselves
[00:54:01.420 --> 00:54:05.380]   and say, "I'm not going to go with the status quo.
[00:54:05.380 --> 00:54:08.300]   I'm going to go ahead and blaze a different path."
[00:54:08.300 --> 00:54:15.980]   But then many of those same people will hold before their children the same normal cultural
[00:54:15.980 --> 00:54:17.160]   norms.
[00:54:17.160 --> 00:54:19.380]   You need to make sure that you have a good education.
[00:54:19.380 --> 00:54:21.260]   You need to make sure that you have a good job, et cetera.
[00:54:21.260 --> 00:54:27.140]   Do you have some ideas or thoughts or hopes for their future in terms of avoiding that?
[00:54:27.140 --> 00:54:33.500]   It's kind of funny, all the things that I've kind of like, "Ah, it doesn't really matter."
[00:54:33.500 --> 00:54:37.060]   Those are probably going to be the things that my kids build their lives around because
[00:54:37.060 --> 00:54:43.180]   they will think that I didn't put enough emphasis on them.
[00:54:43.180 --> 00:54:48.820]   But I think for us, the key is just trying to keep options open for the kids and educate
[00:54:48.820 --> 00:54:57.420]   them on some of the pluses and minuses of different lifestyle choices or how they choose
[00:54:57.420 --> 00:54:59.620]   to design their life.
[00:54:59.620 --> 00:55:07.660]   One of my goals for my kids is that by the time they're reaching adulthood, 17, 18, 19,
[00:55:07.660 --> 00:55:14.380]   whatever that is, one of my goals for each of my kids is to have helped them and taught
[00:55:14.380 --> 00:55:23.380]   them how to make $1,000 a month in a semi-passive residual way.
[00:55:23.380 --> 00:55:26.620]   Basically make $1,000 a month online.
[00:55:26.620 --> 00:55:31.740]   I feel like if I can do that, if you're 18 years old and you're making $1,000 a month
[00:55:31.740 --> 00:55:37.700]   in online income and you figured out that, that opens a lot of doors for you.
[00:55:37.700 --> 00:55:42.900]   First of all, if they wanted to travel and you're single and you're 18, you could probably
[00:55:42.900 --> 00:55:46.740]   travel forever on $1,000 a month.
[00:55:46.740 --> 00:55:50.340]   Or maybe they say, "Well, gosh, if I figured out how to make $1,000 a month, maybe I could
[00:55:50.340 --> 00:55:53.580]   make $2,000 a month."
[00:55:53.580 --> 00:55:58.220]   So that's one goal that we have with the kids.
[00:55:58.220 --> 00:56:02.340]   But what kind of life are they going to have?
[00:56:02.340 --> 00:56:11.620]   I mean, if my kids become doctors or lawyers, these are much more high-stress jobs and high-stress
[00:56:11.620 --> 00:56:15.860]   careers than we have now.
[00:56:15.860 --> 00:56:22.100]   All we can do is try to lead them and raise them right and get them to think about these
[00:56:22.100 --> 00:56:23.100]   kinds of questions.
[00:56:23.100 --> 00:56:29.140]   And they can make their own choices in terms of what they want their life to look like
[00:56:29.140 --> 00:56:32.540]   and what they feel called to do.
[00:56:32.540 --> 00:56:35.540]   Trey Lockerbie (00:15:40): With the patchwork income, sometimes it's
[00:56:35.540 --> 00:56:37.820]   higher, sometimes it's lower.
[00:56:37.820 --> 00:56:45.300]   Have you put in any place, any strategies that have helped you to avoid or limit the
[00:56:45.300 --> 00:56:49.460]   amount of credit card debt that you get into when income is low?
[00:56:49.460 --> 00:56:57.060]   David Bonilla (00:16:02): No, we don't have credit card debt.
[00:56:57.060 --> 00:57:02.100]   I think in part because I was just in a decision to not have credit card debt.
[00:57:02.100 --> 00:57:06.740]   And so for us, it was always like, "We've got to make more money.
[00:57:06.740 --> 00:57:07.740]   What am I going to do?
[00:57:07.740 --> 00:57:11.740]   I've got to make some calls.
[00:57:11.740 --> 00:57:13.700]   I've got to book another consulting gig.
[00:57:13.700 --> 00:57:18.100]   I've got to get a freelance writing gig because we need more money than we have right now.
[00:57:18.100 --> 00:57:20.220]   So I've got to go find it."
[00:57:20.220 --> 00:57:29.900]   It was never really an option to rack up credit card debt.
[00:57:29.900 --> 00:57:34.860]   And I think that it goes back to my first tenant, get out of debt.
[00:57:34.860 --> 00:57:40.540]   So last thing I want is new debt.
[00:57:40.540 --> 00:57:46.340]   So I think it really is, you have to discipline yourself or you have to give some things up.
[00:57:46.340 --> 00:57:52.500]   Well, it goes back to the second tenant as well, having fewer expenses.
[00:57:52.500 --> 00:57:58.460]   So the money you have to bring in this month that you're obligated to bring in is just
[00:57:58.460 --> 00:58:01.420]   a lower number.
[00:58:01.420 --> 00:58:03.940]   So it's tough.
[00:58:03.940 --> 00:58:07.580]   It's worked out for us over time.
[00:58:07.580 --> 00:58:15.020]   Never been in a situation really where we had to rack up credit card debt to buy groceries
[00:58:15.020 --> 00:58:16.020]   for our family.
[00:58:16.020 --> 00:58:19.820]   We're always able to go out and find one more thing.
[00:58:19.820 --> 00:58:24.180]   Last question, Clark.
[00:58:24.180 --> 00:58:25.180]   It's easy for…
[00:58:25.180 --> 00:58:29.180]   I mean, not say it's easy.
[00:58:29.180 --> 00:58:32.460]   If I were listening to this interview, one of the questions I would be having would be
[00:58:32.460 --> 00:58:38.540]   thinking, "Oh, it's easy for somebody who's been to the heights of prestige and
[00:58:38.540 --> 00:58:44.980]   success, made a lot of money, made six figures of income, lived in a fancy house, worked
[00:58:44.980 --> 00:58:46.180]   with fancy people.
[00:58:46.180 --> 00:58:53.820]   It's easy for that person to say, 'Well, listen, being broke is not such a bad thing.'
[00:58:53.820 --> 00:58:55.540]   But what about me?
[00:58:55.540 --> 00:58:57.680]   Maybe I've never made a lot of money.
[00:58:57.680 --> 00:58:59.640]   Maybe I've always been broke.
[00:58:59.640 --> 00:59:08.100]   Maybe my family comes from a very poor, disadvantaged part of society or part of the world."
[00:59:08.100 --> 00:59:11.700]   Does your philosophy fit that type of person?
[00:59:11.700 --> 00:59:15.340]   Do you have lessons that you'd like that kind of person to consider?
[00:59:15.340 --> 00:59:20.780]   Or is your philosophy only for those who've been privileged enough to reach the pinnacles
[00:59:20.780 --> 00:59:23.940]   of success and then realize, "Well, it's not always cracked up to be, so I'm going
[00:59:23.940 --> 00:59:25.220]   to design my life differently."
[00:59:25.220 --> 00:59:34.420]   Well, remember, when we really started rebuilding, I was in a shameful position, you know, really
[00:59:34.420 --> 00:59:39.700]   only by my own standards.
[00:59:39.700 --> 00:59:43.460]   I retreated from all past relationships.
[00:59:43.460 --> 00:59:48.460]   So when we began rebuilding our life, we weren't rebuilding our life with old connections.
[00:59:48.460 --> 00:59:52.900]   You know, we were doing it ourselves.
[00:59:52.900 --> 00:59:53.900]   Can't everyone do it?
[00:59:53.900 --> 00:59:55.900]   You know, I'm asked that question a lot.
[00:59:55.900 --> 01:00:00.460]   And my answer to that question is, "I don't know."
[01:00:00.460 --> 01:00:03.380]   You know, I don't know if everyone can do it.
[01:00:03.380 --> 01:00:05.620]   The question isn't, "Can everyone do it?"
[01:00:05.620 --> 01:00:07.820]   The question is, "Can you do it?"
[01:00:07.820 --> 01:00:10.540]   You know, do you believe that you have it in you?
[01:00:10.540 --> 01:00:19.220]   And I think that if you're listening to a podcast like this, chances are you do have
[01:00:19.220 --> 01:00:20.220]   it in you.
[01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:25.940]   And, you know, when we started out, when we moved out of the garage and moved up to Tahoe,
[01:00:25.940 --> 01:00:28.060]   we made $217 that month.
[01:00:28.060 --> 01:00:31.140]   That was what our patchwork of income brought in.
[01:00:31.140 --> 01:00:35.740]   And slowly but surely, we continued to build it up.
[01:00:35.740 --> 01:00:36.740]   Can everyone do it?
[01:00:36.740 --> 01:00:37.740]   I don't know.
[01:00:37.740 --> 01:00:41.140]   I'm not willing to say everyone can do it, but that's really not the question.
[01:00:41.140 --> 01:00:43.500]   The question is, "Can you do it?"
[01:00:43.500 --> 01:00:50.660]   And I think that if we begin to say we can and we begin to try to live epically today
[01:00:50.660 --> 01:01:02.060]   and to make the most of every day, I do think that you will see that a life of your own
[01:01:02.060 --> 01:01:10.660]   design isn't something that's reserved for a few lucky or a few special people.
[01:01:10.660 --> 01:01:11.660]   Can everyone do it?
[01:01:11.660 --> 01:01:12.660]   I don't know.
[01:01:12.660 --> 01:01:18.340]   But I think it's possible for far more people than who are currently achieving it.
[01:01:18.340 --> 01:01:20.900]   Clark, thanks for coming on the show.
[01:01:20.900 --> 01:01:24.100]   Tell us about all your websites, where people can buy the book.
[01:01:24.100 --> 01:01:25.100]   Give us all of your addresses.
[01:01:25.100 --> 01:01:26.100]   Sure.
[01:01:26.100 --> 01:01:30.820]   Well, you can go to unworkingbook.com.
[01:01:30.820 --> 01:01:36.100]   You can buy the book there at unworkingbook.com, but you can also read detailed chapter descriptions,
[01:01:36.100 --> 01:01:38.900]   the introduction, the prologue.
[01:01:38.900 --> 01:01:42.860]   Actually, the book starts out with a letter to my children.
[01:01:42.860 --> 01:01:43.860]   So unworkingbook.com.
[01:01:43.860 --> 01:01:53.300]   And then I blog haphazardly on family travel and lifestyle design at familytrek.org.
[01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:59.100]   And then, gosh, I'm on Twitter @clarkvand.
[01:01:59.100 --> 01:02:01.060]   And I'm around the interwebs.
[01:02:01.060 --> 01:02:04.660]   But go to familytrek.org or unworkingbook.com.
[01:02:04.660 --> 01:02:05.660]   You can find me.
[01:02:05.660 --> 01:02:13.580]   My challenge for you today as we go is to ask you, how can you take some of the lessons
[01:02:13.580 --> 01:02:17.720]   from Clark's story and apply them to yourself?
[01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:19.420]   Can you build a little bit of patchwork income?
[01:02:19.420 --> 01:02:20.420]   Can you lower some expenses?
[01:02:20.420 --> 01:02:21.740]   Can you eliminate some debt?
[01:02:21.740 --> 01:02:25.380]   How can you take some of the good things from his experience and then just put them in your
[01:02:25.380 --> 01:02:26.380]   own situation?
[01:02:26.380 --> 01:02:27.980]   You don't have to live his lifestyle.
[01:02:27.980 --> 01:02:28.980]   I don't want to live his lifestyle.
[01:02:28.980 --> 01:02:30.460]   I'm not really that into skiing.
[01:02:30.460 --> 01:02:33.940]   I don't want to move to Lake Tahoe.
[01:02:33.940 --> 01:02:37.620]   But I can learn from it and then I can apply it in my own life.
[01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:41.820]   And that's really what we've got to do is continually learn from these things and apply
[01:02:41.820 --> 01:02:43.140]   them in our own lives.
[01:02:43.140 --> 01:02:44.580]   I hope this has been useful.
[01:02:44.580 --> 01:02:46.580]   You may check out Clark's book Unworking.
[01:02:46.580 --> 01:02:47.580]   I really enjoyed it.
[01:02:47.580 --> 01:02:51.660]   Probably the most useful thing about – well, I really enjoyed the stories in the book.
[01:02:51.660 --> 01:02:55.860]   Probably the most useful thing about it, though, he's got a bunch of great journaling prompts
[01:02:55.860 --> 01:02:58.220]   in that book, a lot of great journaling prompts.
[01:02:58.220 --> 01:03:01.780]   In fact, it's probably worth the price of admission just for those alone.
[01:03:01.780 --> 01:03:05.820]   But frankly, that's my opinion on it.
[01:03:05.820 --> 01:03:07.780]   So check it out, Unworking.
[01:03:07.780 --> 01:03:10.500]   Link in the show notes for today's show.
