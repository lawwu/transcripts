[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.800]   Welcome to a new week on the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:11.360]   Today we have a guest with us, but before we talk with him, I want to open with a short
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:17.480]   excerpt from Jordan Peterson's appearance with Cathy Newman on Channel 4 News in the
[00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.560]   UK.
[00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.760]   Here they are, Jordan Peterson and Cathy Newman, talking about gender equality in the workplace.
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:25.760]   Have a listen.
[00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.520]   Is gender equality a myth?
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.360]   I don't know what you mean by the question.
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.820]   Men and women aren't the same and they won't be the same.
[00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.860]   That doesn't mean they can't be treated fairly.
[00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.120]   Is gender equality desirable?
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.680]   If it means equality of outcome, then almost certainly it's undesirable.
[00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.120]   That's already been demonstrated in Scandinavia.
[00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.120]   Because in Scandinavia...
[00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.200]   What do you mean by that?
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.080]   Equality of outcome is undesirable?
[00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.260]   Well men and women won't sort themselves into the same categories if you leave them alone
[00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:51.560]   to do it off their own accord.
[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.560]   I've already seen that in Scandinavia.
[00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.480]   It's 20 to 1 female nurses to male, something like that.
[00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.880]   It might not be quite that extreme.
[00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.720]   And approximately the same male engineers to female engineers.
[00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.960]   And that's a consequence of the free choice of men and women in the societies that have
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.220]   gone farther than any other societies to make gender equality the purpose of the law.
[00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.400]   Those are ineradicable differences.
[00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.440]   You can eradicate them with tremendous social pressure and tyranny.
[00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.800]   But if you leave men and women to make their own choices, you will not get equal outcome.
[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.560]   Right, so you're saying that anyone who believes in equality, whether you call them feminist,
[00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.800]   call them whatever you want to call them, should basically give up because it ain't
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:29.940]   going to happen.
[00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.560]   Only if they're aiming at equality of outcome.
[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.380]   So you're saying give people equality of opportunity, that's fine.
[00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.840]   Not only fine, it's eminently desirable for everyone, for individuals and for society.
[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.080]   But still women aren't going to make it, that's what you're really saying.
[00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.760]   It depends on your measurement techniques.
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.580]   They're doing just fine in medicine.
[00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.380]   In fact there are far more female physicians than there are male physicians.
[00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.880]   There are lots of disciplines that are absolutely dominated by women.
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:55.880]   Many many disciplines.
[00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.360]   And they're doing great.
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.360]   Lively.
[00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:04.120]   No surprise the video of this debate has been viewed over 10 million times on YouTube.
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.680]   So who is Jordan Peterson?
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:06.680]   Where did he come from?
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:12.020]   And what can we learn from the Jordan Peterson phenomenon that's taking the world by storm?
[00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.840]   To answer those questions we're releasing a special long form APJ conversation today.
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.360]   It will likely go about 30 minutes or so with our guest Dr. Alistair J. Roberts.
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.080]   He is a theologian in Durham, England, a podcaster on the Mere Fidelity podcast and author of
[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.200]   two books.
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.280]   One with Andrew Wilson, Echoes of Exodus, tracing themes of redemption through scripture.
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.640]   And another one in process titled Heirs Together, a theology of the sexes.
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.040]   Lord willing forthcoming in 2019.
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.100]   I began my chat with Alistair Roberts asking him to explain the surge of interest around
[00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.680]   Jordan Peterson and how it began in the first place.
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:56.320]   It's a very good question because many people have different forms of exposure to Jordan
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.320]   Peterson.
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:03.200]   I think for many people, their first exposure was in the context of his opposition to Bill
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.640]   C-16 in Canada a few years ago.
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.320]   And he saw that as an example of compelled speech where people had to use the preferred
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:16.640]   gender pronouns of transgender persons, even in cases where they might not believe that
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.480]   those were the appropriate pronouns to use.
[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.320]   And so he opposed that quite vehemently.
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:27.360]   And for many people, that was the first introduction to him, seeing him as someone who was a figure
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:34.520]   within the culture wars, someone who was opposed to the restrictive and oppressive form that
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:40.360]   certain progressive movements have taken in recent years, and someone pushing back against
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.800]   that tendency.
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:46.480]   More recently, he's been famous for, first of all, an interview that he gave to Channel
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:54.080]   Four in the UK with Kathy Newman, where he spoke about the issue of the gender pay gap,
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.680]   other issues like that.
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.320]   And the interview hit a nerve for many people.
[00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:05.080]   He was arguing calmly, and yet the interviewer was constantly pushing back against him in
[00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:10.320]   a very aggressive way, "So you're saying that?" and then mischaracterizing his position quite
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.320]   severely.
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:16.480]   But yet, within that interview, Peterson expressed his concern for the well-being of
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.160]   young men who have formed a significant body of his followers.
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:25.720]   Now, to understand the place that Peterson has for young men, it's also important to
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.680]   understand that Peterson has not just been a figure within the culture wars.
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:36.680]   He's been someone who, behind the scenes, has amassed a considerable following as someone
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:42.680]   who's akin to a self-help guru for some, but seems to be going further than that.
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.800]   He's making some deeper claims about reality itself.
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.840]   So he's set up a YouTube channel, which many people have followed, and more recently, he's
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:58.040]   published a book, Twelve Rules for Life, which has been a wildfire bestseller in all parts
[00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:02.480]   of the world, and it's been translated into a number of different languages already, I
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:03.480]   think.
[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:09.200]   But in that book, he expresses a vision for life and for finding meaning within it, meaning
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:15.400]   in the context of chaos and disorder, but also in the context of quests for a sort of
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:20.480]   an oppressive order, the totalitarianism that many people are drawn towards.
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:25.000]   And his thought comes from a more academic position than many of the people that you
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.920]   see within the culture wars, or in the context of self-help.
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:34.360]   He's a clinical psychologist and professor at the University of Toronto.
[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:41.720]   Now he's on leave for the time being, going around the world giving speeches and talks
[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:47.840]   and filling halls and stadia just talking about his philosophy.
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:52.080]   And so many people have been attracted to this, particularly young men, and understanding
[00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:56.880]   that is complicated because some of them are coming from the culture war perspective, but
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:03.200]   a great many, perhaps the majority, are coming simply in need of meaning in their lives,
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:09.160]   a need for order, a need for a sense of purpose, and a need for a sense of reality as something
[00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:14.600]   that is a place in which they can act with weight and with significance.
[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.520]   And he speaks to that, he speaks with great compassion.
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:22.660]   He's often had interviews in which he's broken down in tears when he's talked about the plight
[00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:27.160]   of young men who have suffered with a lack of meaning and a lack of purpose.
[00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:33.760]   And he speaks to these young men not in terms of a victim mentality, but telling them that
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:39.240]   they need to, his famous phrase, "Clean your room, set your house in order before you criticise
[00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.640]   the world."
[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:47.800]   He's speaking to them in terms of responsibility, in terms of purpose, meaning, in terms of
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.500]   contribution to a society beyond themselves.
[00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:55.320]   As they set themselves in order, they will become sources of life for people around them.
[00:06:55.320 --> 00:07:02.280]   Now this has provoked considerable controversy in various quarters for a number of different
[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:04.760]   reasons, some valid, many not so valid.
[00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:06.360]   Yeah, really interesting stuff.
[00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:09.140]   A lot of different people are drawn to him, obviously.
[00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:14.080]   So how much of the Jordan Peterson phenomenon centres on him as a political figure in the
[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:20.220]   culture wars today, and how much of it centres on him as a self-help guru mentoring these
[00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:21.640]   young men towards responsibility?
[00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:23.320]   Well, it's complicated.
[00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:28.200]   I mean, Peterson didn't start off trying to reach young men, nor did he start off as a
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:29.760]   figure in the culture wars.
[00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:33.480]   He was a clinical psychologist and an academic.
[00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:41.460]   And so my first exposure to Peterson was through a talk that he gave on TEDx at the University
[00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:46.700]   of Toronto, where he was speaking about meaning and reality and talking about the way in which
[00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:52.920]   we need to move beyond a nihilist and materialist view of reality, to see reality itself as
[00:07:52.920 --> 00:08:00.600]   meaningful and weighty, and as our place within reality as something that was significant.
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:04.460]   And that is where the real source of his position lies.
[00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:07.160]   That's where everything else has arisen from.
[00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:13.640]   And he's had a particular concern with oppressive governments, particularly communism and Nazism,
[00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:18.680]   which he sees as a response to the tragic loss of meaning within following the death
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:19.760]   of God.
[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:24.840]   He's dealing with a Nietzschean reality, and the response of totalitarianism is an attempt
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:28.360]   to establish order in a situation of chaos.
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:35.720]   And so he's written and thought and spoken an awful lot about Soviet Russia, about Nazi
[00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:39.680]   Germany, and he's got a personal fascination with these things as well.
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:47.480]   His house is filled with Soviet propaganda, because he just finds it fascinating and compelling
[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:52.920]   as a subject matter, seeing exactly what leads people to follow such a belief system.
[00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:58.920]   So whereas the typical clinical psychologist is attempting to enable people to be well-adjusted
[00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:05.040]   members of society, Peterson has always had this deeper concern of getting people to engage
[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:11.280]   with reality in a meaningful and a powerful way, to recognise that reality itself is glorious,
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:16.920]   that reality has meaning, and that when we act, we should act with purpose and significance,
[00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:20.100]   and not just in a world that is bare and materialistic.
[00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:26.940]   But then he's also very concerned about the way in which society itself can become dysfunctional.
[00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:32.900]   So he's trying to form people who would be able to resist a Stalin or a Hitler, people
[00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:35.700]   who have courage and conviction.
[00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:40.920]   And so his concern about telling the truth, I've never seen anyone who writes with such
[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:45.000]   force and conviction about the importance of telling the truth.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.160]   Telling the truth for Peterson is something that has an existential significance, but
[00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:55.400]   also a political significance, because societies where lies, people become accustomed to these
[00:09:55.400 --> 00:10:02.000]   small lies, are societies where people like Hitler or Stalin rise to power.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:08.040]   And so his concern about Bill C-16 wasn't about the gender issues primarily.
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:13.600]   It was about a government that was enforcing speech, enforcing people to tell what might
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:19.300]   seem to be just little lies in order to make society run more smoothly.
[00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:25.400]   But as Peterson argues, when we start telling those little lies, the entire fabric of society
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:29.600]   is placed in jeopardy, because those little lies seldom remain little.
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:37.200]   They tend to balloon in size, and they often come at the sacrifice of the soul of society.
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:43.280]   So he'll talk about, for instance, Soviet Germany, where you have Eastern Germany and
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:49.600]   the secret police, and the way in which their power was rested in large part upon all the
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:54.120]   petty animosities between people and their neighbours.
[00:10:54.120 --> 00:11:00.640]   And so our individual issues are bound up with the structural and systemic issues of
[00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:01.640]   society.
[00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:03.680]   So we must begin by setting ourselves right.
[00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:07.900]   Now many people have criticised Peterson for not taking enough account of the structural
[00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:11.960]   and systemic injustices and dysfunctions within society.
[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:14.320]   I think that's an unfair concern.
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:19.600]   Rather, he's saying, these concerns are important, but we must begin with ourselves.
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.640]   We must set ourselves right first.
[00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:24.840]   Yeah, there is so much to commend in him.
[00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:27.520]   But how should we critically assess him?
[00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:33.240]   What would you say to Christians about how to go about discerning his works and his influence?
[00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:36.760]   Tell them to start off by recognising where he's coming from.
[00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:40.240]   He's not speaking, first of all, he's not speaking as a Christian.
[00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:47.160]   He will occasionally speak of himself as someone who holds to Christian beliefs, or is motivated
[00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:52.680]   by Christian principles, but he is not a Christian, not in any orthodox sense of the term.
[00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:58.600]   He believes in Christianity as a true myth, as a myth that has weight within the world,
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:02.800]   but not as something that actually occurred historically in the way that we would believe
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:04.520]   that it did.
[00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:11.800]   He's also speaking as someone who is a Jungian, and as a Jungian he's very much concerned
[00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:17.240]   about the collective self-conscious, about things like archetypes.
[00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:22.040]   And so his concept of chaos and order, male and female, all these sorts of things, are
[00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:27.320]   very much bound up not with primarily Christian understandings of these things, but with Jungian
[00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:28.320]   understandings.
[00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:32.880]   Now, those can be very helpful and informative, but we need to be aware, we need to understand
[00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:34.440]   where he's coming from there.
[00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:41.200]   He's a Darwinian who is very, in many ways, he's taking the concept of evolution further
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:47.280]   and dealing with it in the very context of human meaning structures, that those are evolved
[00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:52.040]   structures too, not just human physiology, but are very meaning structures.
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:56.640]   And so his Jungianism is inflected by Darwinianism.
[00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:59.480]   And so that's another thing to bear into account.
[00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:05.480]   He's a strong individualist, not in the sense of the way that we usually use that term,
[00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:10.160]   but as someone who believes that things must start with the individual, not in terms of
[00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:16.280]   self-actualisation and hedonism and indifference to the common good, but in terms of being
[00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:23.200]   responsible, in terms of seeing the individual as the source and the spring of the integrity
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:24.400]   of society.
[00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:28.680]   If individuals are not faithful, then society will crumble.
[00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:32.220]   And so that's another part of his ideology that he's working with.
[00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:36.960]   And then there's the phenomenology, which again is a way of looking at reality, framing
[00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:41.940]   reality in terms of moving beyond a subjective objective distinction.
[00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:47.360]   So when we look at the world in terms of science, we can often end up with a humanity that is
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:49.000]   detached from the world.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.400]   We stand over against the world, and the world is primarily a realm of material objects that
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:55.800]   are shorn of meaning.
[00:13:55.800 --> 00:14:01.240]   Whereas he's trying to connect the human perception with the world as a world that's lived in,
[00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:08.280]   a world that's a realm of habitation, and a realm which is inherently meaningful, where
[00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:13.960]   the realities that we encounter are not just bare objects in motion according to certain
[00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:21.680]   forces, but they are charged with meaning, beauty, glory, life, all these sorts of things.
[00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:27.600]   Now it should be clear there that there are a lot of areas with Peterson's views that
[00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:30.960]   do not square well with Christian understandings.
[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:33.280]   They will be common points of reference.
[00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:37.600]   So for instance, his Darwinianism and his Jungianism give him a strong account of human
[00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:45.880]   nature that pushes against many of the modern ideas of social constructivism and human nature
[00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:47.400]   as non-existence.
[00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:51.220]   We can make ourselves to be whatever we want ourselves to be.
[00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:55.680]   So he pushes very strongly against that, and it leads to a strong idea of differences between
[00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:57.840]   male and female and these sorts of things.
[00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:03.200]   But it's built on a different foundation from a Christian understanding, so that's important
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:05.960]   to bear in mind when we're dealing with him.
[00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:08.400]   Also, he uses scripture a lot.
[00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:12.720]   When you're reading most self-help books or books of philosophy or psychology, you don't
[00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:15.280]   expect to encounter scripture.
[00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:18.080]   Whereas within Peterson's work, it's everywhere.
[00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:24.480]   Much of his book, Twelve Rules for Life, is concerned with exegesis of a kind, but it's
[00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:31.240]   exegesis that's more akin to a sort of modern psychological allegory of scripture than to
[00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:36.860]   close exegetical and careful grammatical historical handling of the text.
[00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:41.280]   Now his understanding of scripture is something that we can learn from.
[00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:46.920]   We see that there are structures of meaning and archetypes and these sorts of things that
[00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:48.680]   are represented in scripture.
[00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:53.600]   So he comes up with a statement like this, this is in Twelve Rules, "The Bible is, for
[00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:58.320]   better or worse, the foundational document of Western civilization, of Western values,
[00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:01.360]   Western morality, and Western conceptions of good and evil.
[00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:05.640]   It's the product of processes that remain fundamentally beyond our comprehension.
[00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:10.240]   The Bible is a library composed of many books, each written and edited by many people.
[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:14.920]   It's a truly emergent document, a selected, sequenced, and finally coherent story written
[00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:18.680]   by no one and everyone over many thousands of years.
[00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:23.640]   The Bible has been thrown up out of the deep by the collective human imagination, which
[00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:30.280]   is itself a product of unimaginable forces operating over unfathomable spans of time.
[00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:35.320]   Its careful, respectful study can reveal things to us about what we believe and how we do
[00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:39.560]   and should act that can be discovered in almost no other manner."
[00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:41.480]   Now that's a striking statement.
[00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:48.520]   It shows the contradiction of Peterson's thought, or the complex character of Peterson's thought,
[00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:49.520]   for a Christian.
[00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:53.520]   Because on the one hand, he's coming to the scripture with a great respect for this document.
[00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:59.680]   This document, in the form of myth, reveals certain truths about our collective subconscious.
[00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:04.120]   It reveals something true about our nature and about our place within the world and how
[00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:08.120]   we are to find meaning and purpose and significance in the world.
[00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:13.800]   But it's not true in the way that Christians have traditionally understood it.
[00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:18.320]   And so it's not a book that's come from God in the way that we understand it to have come
[00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:19.320]   from God.
[00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:23.080]   Rather, it's thrown up out of the collective human imagination.
[00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:27.920]   Now it's a deep document from which we can learn things, but at the same time, it's not
[00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:35.640]   inspired, it's not infallible, it's not inerrant, it's not the sorts of things that we, as Christians,
[00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:39.640]   would hold as absolutely essential to an orthodox doctrine of scripture.
[00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:43.840]   Yeah, I think that point is so important and it's worth underlining as well.
[00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:47.800]   I mean, as a Jungian archetypalist, he's not seeing one author.
[00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:52.040]   The Bible is a collection of psychological allegories for him.
[00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:56.920]   In other words, scripture emerges for him from a set of universal patterns that exist
[00:17:56.920 --> 00:18:00.160]   inside the collective unconsciousness of humanity.
[00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:06.160]   Oh my, I mean, that is such a great point for us all to remember as Christians.
[00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:09.720]   Whenever we see a New York Times bestseller making good use of the Bible, often that's
[00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:10.720]   where it's coming from.
[00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:13.200]   It's a very different approach to the Bible.
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:16.160]   But Alistair, maybe the most important question I want to ask you, and it's the one that
[00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:21.280]   I want you to elaborate most on, and it's what lessons can church leaders and pastors
[00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:26.200]   take from the Jordan Peterson phenomenon and his impact on young men?
[00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:31.220]   Yeah, I think that's one of the areas where Peterson's example is most striking.
[00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:35.600]   He attracts a wide range of people, but especially young men.
[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:40.660]   And he's resonated with young men in a very powerful way that itself is a phenomenon that
[00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:42.920]   needs to be reflected upon.
[00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:47.320]   I've heard people comment that these young men's mothers have been telling them to clean
[00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:51.680]   their rooms for years, but then Jordan Peterson comes along and tells them to clean their
[00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:54.640]   room and it's deep wisdom from the dawn of time.
[00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:58.380]   And there's something about that that needs explanation.
[00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:03.440]   What is it about him that is so charismatic and magnetic for young men?
[00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:08.280]   And I think even within his own structures of thought, something like the archetype of
[00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:15.560]   the father within his Jungian perspective, I think that explains something of his impact.
[00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:23.360]   He speaks not just as an academic, not just as a general self-help guru, but he speaks
[00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:28.960]   as if a father, and people recognize in him a father figure and they respond to him as
[00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:30.380]   a father figure.
[00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:36.280]   Someone who represents a man who cares about them, who is concerned for their well-being,
[00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:39.680]   and who speaks with authority into their situation.
[00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:46.120]   Now the sorts of responses, both positive and negative, I think to Peterson are in large
[00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:50.880]   measure a response to what he represents, not just what he is saying.
[00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:56.400]   And so the negative responses are to the fact that Peterson represents a father figure.
[00:19:56.400 --> 00:20:00.960]   And for many people that's associated with the patriarchy, it's associated with male
[00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:06.840]   oppression and all these sorts of things, the ways in which men have dominated women
[00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:07.920]   within society.
[00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:09.960]   And so many people react against him.
[00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:16.240]   And the reactions against Peterson are remarkable, the vehemence with which people resist him
[00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:21.680]   and oppose him, and the way in which they write about him as this figure that's only
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:24.160]   one shade removed from Hitler himself.
[00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:29.660]   And it's very hard to understand why that is without recognizing that I think he represents
[00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:34.760]   something that's more than just an individual guy speaking certain ideas.
[00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:38.880]   He represents an archetype which people respond to.
[00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:44.960]   The other thing that pastors I think can learn from is Peterson speaks with authority, and
[00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:48.080]   people do need and value authority.
[00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:52.840]   And many pastors can beat around the bush, or they can hedge their statements, or they
[00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:59.480]   can start to approach their statements just in terms of, "This is what I've found personally."
[00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:01.660]   You can try it on for size too.
[00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:06.440]   But Peterson speaks with force and conviction into people's experience as one who cares
[00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:12.520]   about them, and as one who gives them direction as an older man to younger men.
[00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:18.400]   Now I think that's powerful, and yet many pastors fail to speak in such a manner, and
[00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:21.800]   they fail to represent that sort of figure.
[00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:26.440]   And so I would suggest that's a lesson that we can learn, that people aren't resistant
[00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:27.680]   to authority.
[00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:30.480]   When they see a good authority, they will respond to it.
[00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:36.080]   And often we think of authority as something that is a force to keep people in place, to
[00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:40.400]   make sure that they stay in line, that they don't hold false teaching or something like
[00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:41.400]   that.
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:44.400]   But authority can be an attractive force.
[00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:49.400]   People want good authority in their lives, because good authority gives you purpose and
[00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:52.120]   direction and significance and value.
[00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:55.680]   It gives you a sense of what to do, where to go.
[00:21:55.680 --> 00:22:02.040]   And if you meet someone who really cares about you, and yet can speak with clarity and wisdom
[00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:08.160]   into your situation and into your life, you will respond to that person in a way that
[00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:09.600]   you won't to many others.
[00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:12.320]   We respond to people who care about us.
[00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:16.320]   And I think that's one thing that Peterson exemplifies, that he really does care about
[00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:17.520]   these young men.
[00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:23.160]   When you see him crying, it's clear that his emotion for these young men is genuine.
[00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:28.600]   But yet it's not just about treating them as victims who need to be coddled, but as
[00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:30.800]   those who need to be given purpose and meaning.
[00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:33.480]   And so he speaks that into their situation.
[00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:40.780]   And so I think pastors have the same capacity, but often they don't show that same compassion
[00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:42.160]   for young men.
[00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:46.840]   And instead they speak in ways that just tear young men down, that blame them for things,
[00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:52.240]   that shame them, that accuse them, and constantly hold them up against a standard which they
[00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:54.560]   can't attain to without help.
[00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:59.360]   And so that's another area where I think pastors can learn from Peterson.
[00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:00.760]   Peterson also is a preacher.
[00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:05.760]   I mean, he's a psychology professor and a lecturer and all these sorts of things.
[00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:11.520]   But for the most part, his mode of discourse is akin to nothing so much as the preacher.
[00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:14.200]   And so preaching is not a dead medium.
[00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:22.000]   If people believe that a long sermon is something that is a relic of a few centuries ago, just
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:28.320]   look at the fact that people will go to YouTube and listen for two hours to a Peterson lecture.
[00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:31.760]   There can be something powerful and attractive about that.
[00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:35.720]   And so I think that's another lesson that pastors can learn.
[00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:40.840]   And finally, pastors I think can learn from the fact that Peterson's wisdom in speaking
[00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:47.920]   to people is not primarily about theory, but it's about having spent many, many years working
[00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:51.760]   with people and attending to people, listening to people.
[00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:55.640]   And hearing what they say and learning from observing people.
[00:23:55.640 --> 00:24:02.520]   And that gives you a wisdom and a capacity to speak into people's lives that mere textbooks
[00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:03.520]   won't.
[00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:09.040]   And so one of the great benefits that the pastor has is the benefit of spending time
[00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:14.700]   with people, of being a pastor, a shepherd to people, spending time with families.
[00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:18.280]   Very few people have access to families as families.
[00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:22.960]   They have access to individual people, but pastors can become part of the lives of families.
[00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:29.320]   They can become people who join with people on the pilgrimage of the Christian life over
[00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:33.240]   many, many decades and learn from that experience.
[00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:36.880]   And then they can communicate their knowledge to other people.
[00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:42.900]   And pastors I think are in danger of devaluing the importance of that time spent attending
[00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:47.560]   to people, listening to people and learning from people.
[00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:52.360]   That is something that I think Peterson exhibits that is important.
[00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:58.680]   And all of this I think goes back to something that is a very important and topical issue
[00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:02.320]   within our day and age, which is what is the nature of authority?
[00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:07.720]   Because we've had increasingly these issues within the church that have shown pastors
[00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:13.080]   and leaders who have abused authority, have used authority as a means of power over people,
[00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:17.780]   as a means of taking advantage of people, keeping them in line, preventing them from
[00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:22.260]   actually flourishing, but just making them do what they want them to do.
[00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:28.580]   But Peterson I think exhibits a form of authority that arises by means of attraction, that people
[00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:31.300]   see that and they want to become like this person.
[00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:33.260]   They want to learn from his wisdom.
[00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:38.220]   They want to learn from his example and from his words that he can speak into their situation.
[00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:43.460]   He speaks with an authority not just of some office, but with the authority of experience
[00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:50.900]   and wisdom and an authority that is based upon trust and compassion, that he actually
[00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:53.780]   cares about the people he's speaking to.
[00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:57.600]   And that gives him a practical authority in their lives.
[00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:01.560]   When people who really care about us tell us that we've done something that's really
[00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:07.040]   disappointed them, that stings in a way that nothing else quite can.
[00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:11.920]   When we know we've let down someone that we really care about and whose opinion we value
[00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:15.040]   or someone we admire, that really stings.
[00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:19.840]   And there's a sort of authority there that is based upon trust and love.
[00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:25.000]   And yet many pastors I think are in danger of seeing their authority primarily as residing
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.600]   in the fact of their office.
[00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:33.080]   Whereas the authority of a pastor who truly loves and is concerned with his congregation,
[00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:40.160]   who cares about them, who prays for them continually, someone who spends time visiting them and
[00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:44.900]   sharing their sorrows and their joys over many years, there is an authority that such
[00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:49.240]   a pastor has that no other person can really have in their life.
[00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:55.700]   And so I believe as pastors face the crisis of trust within the Church today, where people
[00:26:55.700 --> 00:27:02.360]   feel this deep distrust arising from a history of abuse, of spiritual mistreatment, of all
[00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:08.000]   these other sorts of problems, and where there are so many competing voices of authority,
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.800]   I think there's a lot to learn from this.
[00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:16.200]   The authority can work, but it really does depend upon establishing a bond of trust.
[00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:20.200]   And on that bond of trust and love, you can have the movement of truth.
[00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:23.240]   That's so helpful.
[00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:27.400]   That was Dr. Alistair Roberts from Durham, England, making his guest debut today in this
[00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:30.000]   special Long Form APJ episode.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.800]   Alistair is a theologian, a podcaster on the Mere Fidelity podcast, and author of two books,
[00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:40.120]   one with Andrea Wilson, Echoes of Exodus, tracing themes of redemption through Scripture,
[00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:47.320]   and another one in process titled Heirs Together, a theology of the sexes, forthcoming in 2019,
[00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:48.320]   Lord willing.
[00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:51.880]   Well, we're going to return on Wednesday back with John Piper in the studio.
[00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:57.400]   Pastor John recently went undercover to attend a mainline liberal church service here in
[00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:58.400]   the Twin Cities.
[00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:03.320]   I asked him about it, and he will tell us what he learned in six observations.
[00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:04.440]   That should be really interesting.
[00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:06.080]   That's next time on Wednesday when we return.
[00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:07.080]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:07.640]   We'll see you then.
[00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:09.640]   [END]
[00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:12.640]   John Piper, A Theologian, and a Podcaster
