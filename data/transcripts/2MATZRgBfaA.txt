[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.760]   [ Applause ]
[00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:13.000]   >> Well, as you noticed, that went over and it was perfectly fine.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.700]   That went over the time a lot.
[00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.180]   That was wonderful.
[00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:17.660]   Thank you so much for coming.
[00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.800]   What a great, great session to end this.
[00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.980]   I mean, it, you know, our mission at the Bogle Center is to expand John Bogle's legacy
[00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:33.180]   by promoting the principles of successful investing and financial well-being
[00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.260]   through education and community.
[00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.340]   I mean, nothing embodies it more than what you just did.
[00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:38.460]   Thank you so much for that.
[00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.120]   It was wonderful.
[00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.980]   Also, to thank people, if the volunteers could stand up,
[00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.040]   all the people who have volunteered, please stand up.
[00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:52.160]   Any local chapter coordinators out there?
[00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.060]   Local chapter coordinators?
[00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.280]   Forum monitors?
[00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.660]   Forum monitors can stand up, thank you.
[00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.020]   Board members, any board members here?
[00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:06.400]   Former board members, Alan, Alan Roth, stand up.
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.460]   Gail, please stand up.
[00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.780]   Thank you all, and anybody else who has spread the word.
[00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:13.940]   Thank you all very much.
[00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.680]   We all greatly appreciate all of your help.
[00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.340]   Several people have already approached us to, you know, how they can help going forward.
[00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.180]   And, of course, we need all types of people.
[00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.040]   And one thing I forgot to mention, because I had this conversation twice when I was
[00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.780]   in the hallway talking with people, are the visionaries, the visionaries.
[00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.560]   I mean, you have a vision for how you can create something within the Bogle Center.
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.800]   We were talking about maybe a Bogleheads fire movement of some sort.
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.020]   I mean, whatever it is that you say, hey, we should have this, this would help.
[00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.640]   You know, I could help do that.
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.240]   And so not only are we looking for, you know, workers and volunteers and people
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.500]   to help with technology, we're looking for visionaries.
[00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.980]   We're looking to grow this organization, not only in the United States, but around the world.
[00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:06.640]   So if you have a vision of where we might be able to go with this, and you are willing
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.720]   to take action on that vision, we certainly want to hear from you
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.240]   and certainly would like you to have that conversation.
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:27.780]   So, okay, so now, actually eight minutes early, the moment you have all been waiting for.
[00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.420]   Not yet.
[00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:30.000]   >> All right.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.720]   >> The moment hasn't arrived yet.
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.000]   Okay, this is the general location, not the exact location.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.480]   But think of this as where we are, are in Chicago, but we're not really in Chicago, okay.
[00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.920]   So when we pop this up on the screen of where the next Bogle Head Conference will be
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.260]   in 2023, it is the general location.
[00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.620]   And the general location is Christine.
[00:02:53.620 --> 00:03:03.380]   Washington, D.C., hey, mid-October.
[00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.880]   David Gravener, are you here, David, still?
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.780]   And there's going to be our local chapter coordinator
[00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.360]   who will be helping us pick the place and the time.
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:17.960]   So, see you all there next year.
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.040]   That's it.
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.520]   Thank you very much for coming.
