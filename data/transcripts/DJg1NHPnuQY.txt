[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.740]   When President George Bush signed it into law in the Rose Garden, he gave this speech
[00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:13.040]   about how investors were now protected and everything was great and ordinary investors
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.860]   could take comfort that the laws were meant to protect them from wrongdoing.
[00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.980]   And you compare that to the speech that President Barack Obama gave eight years later when he
[00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.980]   signed Dodd-Frank into law in the Rose Garden, and it's remarkably similar, that now ordinary
[00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.660]   investors can count on the rules and regulations keeping themselves from people who are preying
[00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.580]   on their financial well-being.
[00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:37.980]   And I don't think it's true in either case because our markets, particularly modern markets,
[00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.540]   move and evolve so quickly that the thing that's coming out of La Sille to get you is
[00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.740]   never going to be the thing you were protecting against.
