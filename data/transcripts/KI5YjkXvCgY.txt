[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   as we have taken a couple weeks off of our class
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.920]   and we'll be resuming class tonight
[00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.420]   and then also concluding our counseling exam class
[00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.400]   next week, Sunday, where we'll look at the case studies
[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.360]   of the ACBC Counseling Exam questions.
[00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.080]   But I'm so glad you joined us tonight.
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.040]   Thankful for our time together.
[00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.200]   Tonight, we're gonna be looking
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.440]   at two very important topics.
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.500]   We'll be looking at Counseling Exam number 10
[00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.880]   and Counseling Exam number 11.
[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.400]   And those are the questions dealing with church discipline
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.120]   and also the role of confidentiality
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.520]   in the counseling relationship.
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.480]   And really the two subjects go together,
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.280]   church discipline and confidentiality.
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.580]   And I think we'll see some connections tonight
[00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.260]   as we look at these topics.
[00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.560]   But I'm so glad that you joined us
[00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.640]   and trust that our study tonight
[00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.640]   will be an encouragement to you
[00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.760]   and that you will pursue further equipping
[00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.560]   in the ministry of biblical counseling.
[00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.640]   So with that said, let me pray for us.
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.200]   Let's devote our time to Lord
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.740]   and let's ask the Lord to bless our time together.
[00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:14.580]   Let's pray.
[00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.840]   Father, we thank you for our study tonight
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.480]   and thank you that we can come to your word,
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.580]   that we can seek to place ourselves
[00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.200]   underneath the authority of the scriptures.
[00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.200]   And we thank you for your gracious rule and over our lives.
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.360]   We pray that as we look tonight
[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.140]   at these very important topics
[00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.440]   that you will help us to think clearly
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.880]   about the ministry of church discipline,
[00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.260]   what it is not and what it is.
[00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.960]   And then Father, as we look at the topic of confidentiality,
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.960]   we pray that you would make us discreet counselors,
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.960]   counselors who know what to do with sensitive information
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.940]   and yet help us to understand the limitations
[00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.840]   of confidentiality so that we would be wise
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.840]   in how we handle information in the counseling ministry.
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.520]   Thank you for each of my brothers and sisters
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.420]   joining us tonight on this Zoom webinar.
[00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.180]   We pray that, Father, you would bless our study together
[00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.000]   and we ask this in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.860]   Amen.
[00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.580]   Well, as I said, we are looking tonight
[00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.700]   at counseling exam number 10,
[00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.500]   which is a exam question dealing with the subject
[00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.460]   of church discipline.
[00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.080]   And I'll go ahead and read the question.
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.460]   It says, describe the role you believe church discipline
[00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.800]   should play in biblical counseling.
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.800]   We, as biblical counselors,
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.720]   hold to a view of counseling ministry,
[00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.080]   which says that counseling is a ministry
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.080]   of the local church and therefore we place our ministry
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.440]   under the authority of the local church.
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.940]   We place our ministry in accountability
[00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.080]   to the governance structure of the local church
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.360]   and therefore we understand that the church
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.500]   is called to exercise the ministry of church discipline.
[00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.780]   Therefore, counseling ministry and church discipline
[00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.920]   do go hand in hand.
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.560]   Practically speaking, what this means is that
[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.960]   you and I in counseling ministry may be working
[00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.960]   with a counselee who is engaged in unrepentant,
[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:42.740]   ongoing, clear sin issues,
[00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.880]   and that counselee may need to be disciplined
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.600]   by the church as a means of bringing
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.440]   that person to repentance.
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.760]   Obviously, we want to exercise a lot of patience
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.080]   in this process.
[00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:02.080]   We want to exercise a great deal of biblical wisdom,
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.460]   and yet we wanna understand that
[00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:08.000]   because our counseling ministry is a ministry
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.120]   of the local church,
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.340]   that church discipline does have a relationship
[00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.500]   to the counseling ministry.
[00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.500]   Now, this is obviously in contrast to counseling ministries
[00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.540]   that are outside of the local church.
[00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.780]   It contrasts our ministry with the type of counseling
[00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.340]   that goes on in the secular world.
[00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.940]   We hold to a church-based, church-centered view
[00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.140]   of counseling ministry,
[00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:44.140]   and so we do believe that the biblical counseling ministry
[00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.320]   and the ministry of church discipline
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:51.160]   do have a relationship with one another.
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.860]   Now, how and when that church discipline process
[00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.680]   is to take place is a judgment call
[00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.700]   that must be made by the biblical counselor
[00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:04.180]   in partnership with the pastor or the elder
[00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.900]   who is overseeing that ministry,
[00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.040]   and yet we do want to see the relationship
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:15.040]   between church discipline and biblical counseling.
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.880]   And so on the first page of your handout,
[00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:22.880]   I do have listed a number of resources
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.640]   that might be helpful to you in writing this essay.
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.500]   I do wanna note that I believe
[00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.620]   this is a very straightforward essay.
[00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.100]   What you wanna do in this essay
[00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:34.900]   is give a very simple, straightforward summary
[00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:39.460]   of what you believe to be the ministry of church discipline,
[00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:43.660]   and then tie in the ministry of biblical counseling
[00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:47.900]   to the ministry of church discipline.
[00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.580]   Show how the two relate to one another.
[00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.820]   This isn't really a trick question.
[00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:56.740]   We're not asking you to do a whole lot of bells and whistles
[00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:58.480]   as you work through this essay.
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:02.100]   We're just asking you to give a straightforward summary
[00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:05.900]   of the process of church discipline,
[00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.760]   and then articulate a view of biblical counseling
[00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:10.860]   that is church-centered
[00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:14.960]   and that relates to the ministry of church discipline.
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:19.020]   Al Mohler has a very good article
[00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:21.200]   in the Southern Baptist Journal of Theology
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:23.840]   that's entitled "Church Discipline, The Missing Mark"
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:28.560]   that is free and that is available for download as a PDF,
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.020]   and I've given you the link to that
[00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:33.660]   as well as giving you a copy of that
[00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:35.480]   in your Dropbox folder.
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:39.380]   A very good summary of church discipline
[00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:43.460]   is Grace Community Church's Distinctives.
[00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:46.720]   Their handout that they have on their website
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:51.140]   gives a very good summary of church discipline
[00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:54.160]   and how it is practiced in the church.
[00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:57.760]   It really is a short and simple read,
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:01.340]   and yet one that is packed with very good information,
[00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:03.920]   and I would encourage you to read that resource
[00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:06.680]   and make use of it.
[00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:11.680]   A little bit of a broader explanation of church discipline
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:15.760]   is found in Bill Zimmer's teaching
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:20.060]   at the Shepherds Conference that is recorded on,
[00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:22.920]   I've given you the website there.
[00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:26.380]   It's entitled "How to Practice Church Discipline."
[00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:29.340]   He does have some questions and answers
[00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:33.380]   as it relates to the ins and outs of church discipline
[00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:34.660]   and how that's practiced,
[00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:39.660]   and I would invite you to make use of that resource as well.
[00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:44.580]   And then I've included in your Dropbox folder
[00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:48.520]   a copy of the Bylaws of Kindred Community Church.
[00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:52.540]   I know that not all of you attend Kindred Community Church,
[00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:56.520]   and yet this is the copy of the bylaws
[00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:59.380]   that my own counseling ministry is accountable to,
[00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:01.240]   and I just wanted to give this to you
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:04.760]   as a resource, as a reference,
[00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:07.440]   to show how, at least in one example
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:09.520]   of the Kindred Counseling Center,
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:12.440]   how we operate in accountability
[00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:15.800]   to the bylaws of our local church.
[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:19.760]   Now, your local church is gonna have its own set of bylaws,
[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:23.260]   and you are gonna have your own standards,
[00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.900]   and you might want to find out,
[00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:28.300]   get a copy of the bylaws of your church,
[00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:31.160]   but this is a copy of the bylaws
[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:32.800]   of Kindred Community Church,
[00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:36.420]   and we do have in that copy of the bylaws
[00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:40.620]   a very detailed section on church membership
[00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:45.620]   and church discipline and member removal,
[00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:48.760]   and I would just give that to you as a reference.
[00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:51.140]   For the last five years or so,
[00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:53.200]   I've taught the membership class here
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.360]   at Kindred Community Church.
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:59.140]   We walk through the bylaws of the church.
[00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:00.900]   I want prospective new members
[00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:03.640]   to understand what they are joining
[00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:06.220]   and what they are being accountable to.
[00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:09.060]   I don't want anyone coming five years from now
[00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:11.160]   and saying, Dan, you never told me
[00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:14.400]   that this is what the bylaws of our church state.
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.340]   We wanna put all that information in your hands
[00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:18.900]   before you commit in membership,
[00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:23.160]   and it is clearly stated that to become a member
[00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:26.500]   of Kindred Community Church,
[00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:28.940]   you are committing to become accountable
[00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:32.580]   to the ministry of church discipline,
[00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:34.100]   and we even have a provision there
[00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:37.200]   that says that if you are in the process
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:39.840]   of church discipline, for example,
[00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:42.580]   if you are in step two or step three
[00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:45.220]   of the church discipline process
[00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:49.840]   and are heading to step four of church discipline,
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:52.180]   then our bylaws state that you cannot,
[00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:55.800]   at that point, resign your membership.
[00:09:55.800 --> 00:10:00.200]   In other words, you are committing to be accountable
[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.160]   to the church discipline process,
[00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.260]   and you can't get halfway through that process
[00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.860]   and say, well, I don't wanna be accountable anymore,
[00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:11.120]   so I'm not gonna be a member anymore of the church.
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:13.980]   We retain the right in that instance
[00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:17.300]   to continue with the church discipline process,
[00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:20.260]   and you must be a member in good standing
[00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:25.140]   in order to resign your membership of the church.
[00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:29.740]   Now, thankfully, that provision does not come into play
[00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:34.220]   in 99% of church membership issues,
[00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:37.900]   and most of our members have a wonderful relationship
[00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:42.060]   with the church and operate in harmony with our bylaws
[00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:44.260]   and with our doctrinal statement,
[00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.180]   but we do want people to know
[00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:49.540]   that if you are becoming a member of a local church,
[00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:53.260]   what that means is you are becoming accountable
[00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:57.940]   in a public manner to live in a godly manner
[00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:02.440]   to uphold the testimony of this local church,
[00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:05.500]   and you are saying at the outset that, if God forbid,
[00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:09.340]   should I fall into unrepentant sin
[00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:13.060]   or if I should fall into severe doctrinal error,
[00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:17.020]   that I want the church to pursue me in love
[00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:21.620]   and to bring me in a process of restoration to repentance
[00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:24.620]   so that I may walk in holiness
[00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:28.020]   and in godliness before the Lord.
[00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:29.900]   Obviously, there's all sorts of caveats.
[00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:32.720]   We're not expecting perfection.
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:33.740]   We're not holding people
[00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:38.380]   to an unrealistic expectation of spiritual growth,
[00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:40.300]   but we are saying that if you fall
[00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:45.300]   into severe unrepentant sin or severe doctrinal error,
[00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:47.220]   or if you become divisive
[00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:50.660]   or cause factions within the local church,
[00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:54.120]   then we are going to pursue you in love
[00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:57.900]   and seek to bring you back into restoration,
[00:11:57.900 --> 00:11:58.980]   into the fellowship,
[00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:01.880]   and that's what it means to become a member
[00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:02.720]   of the local church.
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:06.220]   You are saying that I want this type of accountability,
[00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:08.300]   I desire this type of accountability,
[00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:11.900]   I want a plurality of elders to pursue me in love
[00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:16.180]   if, God forbid, I should fall into unrepentant sin
[00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:18.620]   or severe doctrinal error.
[00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:20.940]   And so I've given you the bylaws of our church
[00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:22.260]   just to give you an example.
[00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:25.460]   Now, I realize that your own local church
[00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:27.760]   may have a different set of bylaws,
[00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:30.560]   but I just wanna give you a reference point
[00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:34.060]   and an example of how church discipline
[00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:37.680]   is spelled out in our local church.
[00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:42.680]   So our counseling ministry operates in accountability
[00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:46.200]   to the bylaws of our church.
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:49.440]   So if we are counseling a member,
[00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:54.440]   we have the right to take a particular sin issue
[00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:59.880]   that is being discussed in the counseling relationship
[00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:04.880]   and widen the circle of people who know about that issue
[00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:09.660]   in a very wise and prudent manner.
[00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:11.940]   If there is an unrepentant sin issue
[00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:13.880]   that is going on in the counseling ministry,
[00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:18.560]   we reserve the right to communicate that issue
[00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:20.580]   to the elders of the church,
[00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:24.720]   and then we retain the right to have the elders
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:29.560]   deal with that issue in an appropriate manner.
[00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:33.240]   And so at that point, if a particular sin issue
[00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:35.040]   goes outside of the counseling ministry
[00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:38.560]   to the wider elder board,
[00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:41.600]   and if the elders are made aware of that issue,
[00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:43.260]   then in a technical sense,
[00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:46.680]   it no longer is under the purview
[00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:48.720]   of the counseling ministry alone.
[00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:52.840]   It has become a wider issue that the elders of the church
[00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:56.800]   are now dealing with and need to work through.
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:00.880]   And we reserve that right to be able to communicate that
[00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:04.840]   if we are compelled to by the scriptures.
[00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:08.360]   Now, again, in a balanced way,
[00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:11.820]   most cases do not need to go to the elders of the church.
[00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:16.580]   Most cases, we can keep that information confidential.
[00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:20.260]   Most cases, we can keep information
[00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.940]   that is shared in a counseling relationship
[00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:25.760]   within the relationship between the counselee
[00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:27.140]   and the counselor,
[00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:29.680]   but we do want that structure to be in place
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:32.480]   so we understand that our counseling ministry
[00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:37.400]   does have a recourse if a particular issue
[00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:42.400]   is not being dealt with in a biblical manner.
[00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:46.520]   And so I put the bylaws of our church in your hands
[00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:49.160]   just so that you can have that as a resource.
[00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:52.360]   Now, just some general thoughts on page two
[00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:56.320]   on the issue of church discipline.
[00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:00.520]   And I've given you the quote by Al Mohler,
[00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:03.320]   where he writes that the decline of church discipline
[00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:05.540]   is perhaps the most visible failure
[00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:07.800]   of the contemporary church,
[00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:10.060]   no longer concerned with maintaining purity
[00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:12.640]   of confession or lifestyle.
[00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:14.360]   The contemporary church sees itself
[00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:17.980]   as a voluntary association of autonomous members
[00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:22.240]   with minimal moral responsibility to God,
[00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:24.580]   much less to each other.
[00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:27.740]   Without a recovery of functional church discipline
[00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:30.060]   firmly established upon the principles
[00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:31.740]   revealed in the Bible,
[00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:33.700]   the church will continue its slide
[00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:37.880]   into moral dissolution and relevaticism.
[00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:41.300]   Authentic biblical discipline is not an elective,
[00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:46.260]   but a necessary and integral mark of authentic Christianity.
[00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:49.780]   So what he's saying there is that what we're seeing
[00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:52.780]   is not only the decline of the practice of church discipline,
[00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:56.580]   but really, as you survey the landscape here,
[00:15:56.580 --> 00:16:01.580]   we're seeing the decline of definitive church membership.
[00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:06.180]   You can't discipline a person
[00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:09.940]   if that person has not made himself or herself
[00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:12.780]   formally accountable to a local church,
[00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:16.220]   and that is why church membership exists.
[00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:17.980]   In the counseling process,
[00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:20.060]   if we are counseling a non-member,
[00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:22.260]   what I'm trying to do is to bring them
[00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:26.500]   into membership in a local church.
[00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:30.260]   That person is not going to grow or thrive spiritually
[00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:35.260]   unless that person is living with a definitive commitment
[00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:38.220]   to a particular local church
[00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:41.820]   in which that believer can be held accountable
[00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:45.020]   for his or her spiritual walk.
[00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:47.000]   And so I'm trying to move this person
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.340]   into a commitment to a local church,
[00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:52.660]   and that involves finding out
[00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:55.420]   if there is a credible profession of faith
[00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:57.500]   and understanding of the gospel,
[00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:00.980]   whether a person has been publicly baptized
[00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:05.620]   in obedience to the Lord's commands and so forth and so on.
[00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:07.820]   We practice in our church
[00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:12.340]   a very defined church membership process.
[00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:18.260]   We want to distinguish between members and non-members,
[00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:23.260]   those who have committed in membership to a local church
[00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:26.740]   and those who are living in accountability
[00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:29.100]   with that local church,
[00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:33.020]   and we want to move non-members into membership
[00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:39.580]   so that they can be publicly identified with a local church.
[00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:41.680]   Now, what that does is that creates
[00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:45.060]   a defined local church assembly
[00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:50.900]   of regenerate, baptized believers in Christ
[00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:53.540]   who publicly profess faith in Jesus Christ,
[00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:58.540]   who publicly give a confession of the gospel
[00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:02.660]   and are able to articulate the basics of their faith,
[00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:04.660]   and who are also saying that they desire
[00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:06.460]   to live in accountability
[00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:09.860]   with a specific governance structure
[00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:13.100]   within the local church.
[00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:18.100]   Therefore, because we have a defined local assembly,
[00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:21.340]   we know who is inside the church,
[00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:23.740]   and through the church discipline process,
[00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:27.300]   we can place people outside of the church.
[00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:28.780]   And I hope that makes sense.
[00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:31.680]   You can't have a church discipline process
[00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:36.340]   if you've never defined who is in the church to begin with.
[00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:40.820]   Who is it who has placed their faith in Jesus Christ?
[00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:44.180]   Who are the people who have been baptized
[00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:48.220]   in order to publicly confess their faith in Jesus Christ?
[00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:50.860]   Who are the believers who have committed
[00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:55.100]   to this local church in accountability
[00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:58.200]   and in a commitment to serve
[00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:01.680]   and to uphold the doctrine of the local church?
[00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:04.260]   If you haven't defined who is the church,
[00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:06.660]   then you're gonna have trouble placing people
[00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:09.340]   outside of the church.
[00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:11.580]   And all of that relates to what Moeller is saying
[00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:16.180]   is what we are losing today is a robust ecclesiology,
[00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:21.180]   a robust view of the centrality of the local church,
[00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:23.340]   and a view of the church,
[00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:26.180]   which holds that the local church
[00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:29.460]   is made up of believers in Christ
[00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:33.320]   who are able to be accounted for by name,
[00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:37.380]   and who are able to be held in accountability
[00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:42.140]   to live a godly life for the glory of Christ.
[00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:44.600]   And therefore, because we're losing
[00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:47.700]   that defined view of the local church,
[00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:51.180]   we are seeing today a weakening of the local church.
[00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:55.460]   Today, you see all types of views of the local church
[00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:58.580]   that if you get a bunch of people together in a room
[00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:02.620]   that have varying interest in who Jesus Christ is,
[00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:04.820]   and you can call that a church
[00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:06.740]   where scripture clearly teaches
[00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:10.800]   that the church is made up of believers in Christ,
[00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:14.100]   those who are regenerate, those who have new life,
[00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:17.060]   who've been born again by the spirit of God.
[00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:20.340]   That is what defines a church,
[00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:24.940]   and every church needs to have some type of organized plan
[00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:29.340]   or structure or approach in order to publicly identify
[00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:31.540]   who are the believers in Christ,
[00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:34.020]   who have placed their faith in Christ,
[00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:38.380]   and who have committed to this local assembly
[00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:41.580]   in order that you may be able to hold them accountable
[00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:45.620]   and know who is inside of the church.
[00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:49.180]   The Grace Community Church Statement says this.
[00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:50.920]   On occasion, a Christian will wander away
[00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:52.700]   from the fellowship of other believers
[00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:55.620]   and find himself ensnared by sin
[00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:58.600]   through ignorance or willful disobedience.
[00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:01.120]   It then becomes necessary for the church,
[00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:03.400]   and particularly its shepherds,
[00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:06.420]   to actively seek the repentance
[00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:09.220]   and restoration of that Christian.
[00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:11.880]   As shepherds of the flock, the elders love the sheep
[00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:14.720]   and are also held accountable by God
[00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:16.160]   for their spiritual welfare,
[00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:19.120]   including that of the wandering sheep.
[00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:22.680]   As in Jesus' parable in Luke 15, verses three to eight,
[00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:25.920]   it is a time of joy both in heaven and within the church
[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:28.960]   when the wandering Christian truly repents,
[00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:32.800]   one means by which the church seeks to lovingly restore
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:36.880]   wandering believers is the process of church discipline.
[00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:38.480]   We'll highlight that point
[00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:41.280]   as we walk through this material,
[00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:46.280]   that the purpose of church discipline is restoration.
[00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:48.000]   We practice church discipline
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   because we want people to be restored
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.480]   to a walk with the Lord.
[00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:55.520]   We want them to know the joy
[00:21:55.520 --> 00:22:00.500]   of the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:04.360]   We want them to walk in holiness and in godliness.
[00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:07.120]   And so we practice church discipline
[00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:12.120]   in order that believers might be restored.
[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:15.880]   Now, just a practical note here,
[00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:18.200]   as I've worked with the counseling ministry,
[00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:22.600]   it's really important that a biblical counselor
[00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:26.960]   understand the ministry of church discipline,
[00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:28.960]   because in many cases,
[00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:33.420]   you may be the one who practices step one
[00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:36.680]   of church discipline and has to move that process
[00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:39.100]   to step two of church discipline.
[00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:43.740]   I rarely see, in fact, by God's grace,
[00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:47.280]   we have not had in the counseling ministry
[00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:50.880]   had to move a person all the way to step four
[00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:52.600]   of church discipline process,
[00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:56.200]   but that has always been in the picture
[00:22:56.200 --> 00:23:01.200]   as we have worked with certain counselees.
[00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:03.360]   The counseling ministry, as I've said before,
[00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:08.020]   is like the emergency room of the church's ministry.
[00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:11.680]   It's where you get the most severe cases
[00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:13.420]   of those who are caught in sin
[00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:17.380]   or who are dealing with the consequences of sin,
[00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:20.140]   possibly dealing with the consequences
[00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:22.740]   of another person's sin.
[00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:25.860]   And so you just need to know what to do with that.
[00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:28.740]   And you need to have in your mind
[00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:30.900]   a framework for church discipline
[00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:32.500]   so that you may understand
[00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:35.340]   that you are not operating on your own.
[00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:39.380]   You may get into phase three of ACBC certification
[00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:43.100]   and find a very severe case of unrepentant sin
[00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:45.440]   and not know how to proceed.
[00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:47.400]   And we will encourage you
[00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:49.880]   that you are to work with this counselee
[00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:52.000]   and to give the counselee scripture
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.220]   and to pray for repentance.
[00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:57.060]   But if through the process of counseling,
[00:23:57.060 --> 00:24:00.360]   if you have exercised patience and you have prayed
[00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:02.280]   and you have exercised wisdom
[00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:04.200]   and you've given the scriptures
[00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:07.280]   and have really given everything that you can
[00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:10.220]   in order to bring a counselee to repentance,
[00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:14.140]   and you're still dealing with a very hardened,
[00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:15.620]   unrepentant heart,
[00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:19.460]   then you do have recourse to take,
[00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:22.060]   to initiate church discipline,
[00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:24.340]   to take a person from step one
[00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:26.440]   to step two of church discipline,
[00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:30.660]   to bring that sin issue to at least
[00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:34.700]   to the overseeing pastor or elder of the counseling ministry.
[00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:37.420]   And then if there is still hardness of heart
[00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:40.880]   to bring that counseling issue
[00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:43.660]   to the elders of your local church,
[00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:48.060]   and then trust them to take the proper steps
[00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:49.740]   to deal with that sin
[00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:53.180]   and seek to bring that person to repentance.
[00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:55.620]   And so we do want you to have a framework for this
[00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:58.620]   as you work with people who may be caught
[00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:02.060]   in some very severe sin issues.
[00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:03.740]   Some key texts here is, of course,
[00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:08.100]   Matthew 18 verses 15 to 20,
[00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:10.580]   where Jesus says, "If your brother sins against you,
[00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:13.600]   "go and tell him his fault between you and him alone."
[00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:16.100]   If he listens to you, you have gained your brother.
[00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:19.900]   So that's step one of church discipline.
[00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:24.400]   Step two would be what Jesus says in the next sentence,
[00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:26.900]   "If he does not listen, take one or two others with you
[00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:28.620]   "that every charge may be established
[00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:31.820]   "by the evidence of two or three witnesses."
[00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:34.220]   Step three, if he refuses to listen to them,
[00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:36.140]   tell it to the church.
[00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:39.900]   Step four, if he refuses to listen even to the church,
[00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:44.900]   let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector,
[00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:48.640]   and that is placing a person outside
[00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:52.280]   of the local church's fellowship.
[00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:55.120]   Jesus says, "Truly I say to you,
[00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:58.400]   "whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven,
[00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:01.620]   "and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.
[00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:05.180]   "Again, I say to you, if two of you agree on earth
[00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:07.900]   "about anything they ask, it will be done for them
[00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:11.000]   "by my Father in heaven, for where two or three
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:15.600]   "are gathered in my name, there I am I among them."
[00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:18.520]   Who are the two or three that are mentioned in verse 20?
[00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:21.720]   They are the same two or three mentioned earlier
[00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:24.940]   in the passage where he says, "If he does not listen,
[00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:27.580]   "take one or two others along with you
[00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:29.580]   "that every charge may be established
[00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:33.180]   "by the evidence of two or three witnesses."
[00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:36.500]   What Jesus is saying here is when you exercise
[00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:39.540]   ministry of church discipline, and as you go
[00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:44.120]   from private confrontation to semi-private confrontation,
[00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:47.800]   as you widen the circle there and you tell it to the church,
[00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:52.800]   there I am among those who are engaging
[00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:55.660]   in the process of church discipline,
[00:26:55.660 --> 00:26:59.580]   that what the church does in the ministry
[00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:02.560]   of church discipline comes with authority,
[00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:06.140]   comes with divine authority.
[00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:11.140]   I won't read the entire passage in 1 Corinthians 5:1-13,
[00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:13.600]   but just to mention that this is an example
[00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:18.600]   of church discipline, that Paul was encouraging
[00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:23.440]   the church at Corinth to deal with the sin
[00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:28.080]   that was in their midst, that there was sexual immorality
[00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:32.920]   in the church at Corinth, and Paul says down in verse 13,
[00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:35.380]   "What have I to do with judging outsiders?
[00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:39.200]   "It is not those inside the church whom you are to judge.
[00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:41.020]   "God judges those outside.
[00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:44.880]   "Purge the evil person from among you."
[00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:48.160]   And so Paul was telling the church at Corinth,
[00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:52.160]   if you have unrepentant sexual immorality
[00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:56.560]   within the church that has become a public matter,
[00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:59.280]   then you are to take one who is recognized
[00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:01.780]   as being inside the church, and you are to place
[00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:05.200]   that person outside of the church
[00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:07.600]   through the process of church discipline.
[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:11.640]   You are to protect the purity of the local church,
[00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:15.320]   and you are also to place the offending person
[00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:20.320]   in a position where he or she will be realized
[00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:26.860]   the severity of their sin and hopefully be moved
[00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:29.680]   to repent of that sin and be restored
[00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:34.200]   to fellowship in the local church.
[00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:36.720]   I always tell people who are considering church membership
[00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:40.280]   that if there is a severe consequence
[00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:43.920]   of being placed outside of the local church,
[00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:47.360]   if there are blessings lost in being placed
[00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:49.720]   outside of the fellowship of the local church,
[00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:53.960]   then you can be sure that there are blessings to be gained
[00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:58.600]   by being recognized as being part of the local church
[00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:01.760]   and being inside the local church.
[00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:03.320]   You want those blessings,
[00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:07.280]   and that is why you wanna be committed to a church,
[00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:12.280]   involved in a church, and be formally identified
[00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:16.800]   as being a member of a local church.
[00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:19.080]   Galatians chapter six, verses one to two
[00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:22.640]   is another key text in the discussion of church discipline
[00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:25.640]   where Paul says, "Brothers, if anyone is caught
[00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:29.320]   "in any transgression, you who are spiritual
[00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:32.320]   "should restore him."
[00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:34.360]   That's the purpose of church discipline.
[00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:39.360]   You should restore him, bring him back into the fold.
[00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:41.560]   How are you to do this?
[00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:45.240]   "In a spirit of gentleness.
[00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:48.680]   "Keep watch on yourself, lest you too be tempted.
[00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:50.680]   "Bear one another's burdens
[00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:54.180]   "and so fulfill the law of Christ."
[00:29:54.180 --> 00:29:57.240]   I think that's just such a helpful
[00:29:57.240 --> 00:30:00.480]   and very instructive passage
[00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:03.960]   as it relates to the ministry of church discipline.
[00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:06.680]   We are to be gentle.
[00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:11.080]   Dear Christians, we are to be known for our gentleness.
[00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:12.400]   We are to be humble.
[00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:15.720]   Whenever we see someone else caught in unrepentant sin,
[00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:18.840]   we are to keep watch on ourselves
[00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:23.520]   and realize that by the grace of God, I am what I am.
[00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:25.900]   And it is only by God's grace
[00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:29.380]   that I am not caught in the same sin
[00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:32.880]   as someone else may be caught in.
[00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:34.920]   And so this ministry cannot be done
[00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:39.040]   with a self-righteous spirit.
[00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:43.280]   We are to be loving, to bear one another's burdens
[00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:48.280]   and so fulfill the law of Christ.
[00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:52.160]   I've seen examples of this, of elders,
[00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:55.280]   not only in my church, but in other churches
[00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:58.480]   who have been gentle with their sheep,
[00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:03.200]   who seek to restore and really plead for repentance
[00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:07.000]   and whose hearts are broken over the unrepentant sin
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.800]   of those who are under their charge
[00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:13.200]   and who go after these sheep,
[00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:15.320]   seeking to restore them back
[00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:18.280]   into the fellowship of the church.
[00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:21.540]   And I've been stirred by these examples
[00:31:21.540 --> 00:31:25.160]   and have been challenged to be a better shepherd
[00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:28.920]   in my own ministry to pursue those
[00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:31.320]   who are caught in a transgression
[00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:34.680]   in order to restore them into fellowship
[00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:37.800]   with Christ and the church.
[00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:41.480]   And so that is a very instructive passage
[00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:45.200]   dealing with the ministry of church discipline.
[00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:48.880]   A few comments here on what discipline is not.
[00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:53.220]   Letter A, it is not an unloving ministry.
[00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:57.700]   There is a difference between condemnation
[00:31:57.700 --> 00:32:00.240]   and loving discipline.
[00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:03.020]   Hebrews 12, verse five says,
[00:32:03.020 --> 00:32:04.900]   "Have you forgotten the exhortation
[00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:06.960]   "that addresses you as sons?
[00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:11.340]   "My son, do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord,
[00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:13.940]   "nor be weary when reproved by him,
[00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:17.360]   "for the Lord disciplines the one he loves
[00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:21.560]   "and chastises every son whom he receives.
[00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:24.700]   "It is for discipline that you have to endure.
[00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:27.880]   "God is treating you as sons."
[00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:30.060]   Now the writer of Hebrews there is saying
[00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:31.300]   that there is a difference
[00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:36.140]   between the loving fatherly discipline
[00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:38.640]   that we receive as children of God
[00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:42.780]   from our gracious heavenly father
[00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:45.780]   that is painful to be sure at times,
[00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:47.680]   but that is meant to produce
[00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:50.300]   a harvest of righteousness in our lives.
[00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:53.480]   There's a difference between that type of loving discipline
[00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:58.400]   versus the wrathful condemnation
[00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:02.280]   that a thrice holy God places
[00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:04.740]   and expresses toward unbelievers
[00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:07.140]   who live in rebellion against him.
[00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:13.000]   There's a difference between God's wrathful judgment
[00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:18.600]   versus his loving fatherly discipline of his children.
[00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:21.180]   And we need to understand that
[00:33:21.180 --> 00:33:26.180]   as we engage in ministry in the local church.
[00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:30.500]   We're not seeking to place wrath and condemnation
[00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:34.480]   upon those who are going astray from the church.
[00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:37.400]   We are seeking to engage in loving,
[00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:40.740]   gentle, restorative ministry
[00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:44.140]   that seeks to bring people back into wholeness
[00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:47.160]   and in fellowship with the church.
[00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:51.580]   And so church discipline is not an unloving ministry.
[00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:54.440]   Let her be, it is not a punitive ministry.
[00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:59.500]   We are seeking to not bring punishment,
[00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:02.540]   but we're seeking to express grace,
[00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:06.220]   the grace of restoration.
[00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:10.640]   You who are spiritual should restore him
[00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:14.020]   in a spirit of gentleness.
[00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:17.420]   That means that we need to be walking by the spirit.
[00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:20.140]   We need to be filled with the fruit of the spirit.
[00:34:20.140 --> 00:34:23.820]   The fruit of the spirit is love, joy, peace, patience,
[00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:26.780]   kindness, goodness, faithfulness, and self-control.
[00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:31.220]   And so we need to remember that the anger of man
[00:34:31.220 --> 00:34:35.060]   does not achieve the righteousness of God.
[00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:39.100]   We cannot engage in church discipline with an angry heart,
[00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:43.420]   with a heart that is impatient with others,
[00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:47.940]   but we are to engage with a spirit of gentleness
[00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:52.400]   in this loving, restorative ministry.
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:55.060]   And so we just need to be reminded
[00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:58.580]   that this is not a punitive ministry.
[00:34:58.580 --> 00:35:01.580]   I love how Jesus says in Matthew 18, verse 15,
[00:35:01.580 --> 00:35:03.940]   if your brother sins against you,
[00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:06.620]   go and tell him his fault between you and him alone.
[00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:11.620]   So don't widen the circle of those who know this information
[00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:14.180]   and it says, if he listens to you,
[00:35:14.180 --> 00:35:17.460]   you have gained your brother.
[00:35:17.460 --> 00:35:19.800]   That's beautiful language.
[00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:22.920]   There is that prospect of engaging in step one
[00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:26.760]   of church discipline and the brother listens
[00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:28.740]   and repents of sin.
[00:35:28.740 --> 00:35:31.200]   And Jesus says, you don't need to go any further.
[00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:33.580]   No one else needs to know about the sin issue
[00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:36.920]   but you and your brother.
[00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:40.180]   And if he listens to you, you have gained your brother.
[00:35:40.180 --> 00:35:45.880]   You have brought that person back into fellowship.
[00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:48.460]   Now I'm sure, and I don't even think I know
[00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:52.140]   of all the examples, but I'm sure there have been cases
[00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:55.300]   in our own counseling ministry where a counselor
[00:35:55.300 --> 00:35:58.480]   has worked with a counselee who has confronted
[00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:03.080]   or who has brought to that counselee's attention a sin issue.
[00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:05.700]   There has been repentance and humility
[00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:09.340]   and there has been restoration in that sense,
[00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:12.180]   a restoration in that counselee's fellowship with God
[00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:13.420]   and also with the church.
[00:36:13.420 --> 00:36:17.480]   And no one else needs to know about what has happened.
[00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:20.460]   No one else needs to know about the sin issue
[00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:23.020]   except the counselor and the counselee
[00:36:23.020 --> 00:36:28.020]   because step one has resulted in restoration.
[00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:29.980]   And that is a beautiful thing
[00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:32.660]   when that type of ministry occurs.
[00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:35.820]   So this is not a punitive ministry.
[00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:39.540]   Lastly, it is not a disorganized ministry.
[00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:42.020]   You see the steps for church discipline,
[00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:45.740]   there's private confrontation, which then moves step two
[00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:48.260]   to semi-private confrontation,
[00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:52.220]   bringing one or two others along with you.
[00:36:52.220 --> 00:36:55.140]   The one or two others may be an elder or pastor
[00:36:55.140 --> 00:36:58.640]   or maybe another counselor or another brother or sister
[00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:01.980]   in the church who is walking with the Lord.
[00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:06.600]   And so the circle widens to semi-private confrontation.
[00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:10.120]   Then there is church-wide pursuit, step three,
[00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:15.120]   which obviously would involve the elders of the church.
[00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:17.140]   In a counseling ministry setting,
[00:37:17.140 --> 00:37:19.620]   what we would have then is step one
[00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:22.980]   may be a counselor working with a counselee
[00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:25.520]   who was caught in unrepentant sin.
[00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:28.060]   If there is a stubbornness of heart there,
[00:37:28.060 --> 00:37:31.100]   it may involve bringing another counseling in,
[00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:33.980]   moving counselor in and moving to step two,
[00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:37.820]   maybe bringing the counseling pastor into the discussion
[00:37:37.820 --> 00:37:39.580]   and going to step two.
[00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:43.480]   If there is still hardness of heart and unrepentant sin,
[00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:48.480]   then the counseling pastor may decide to bring that issue
[00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:50.620]   to the attention of the elders
[00:37:50.620 --> 00:37:53.500]   and the elders may bring that to the church.
[00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:55.820]   And that would be step three.
[00:37:55.820 --> 00:37:57.900]   Jesus says, "Tell it to the church."
[00:37:57.900 --> 00:38:02.900]   The church then is to engage in a church-wide pursuit
[00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:05.060]   of that believer,
[00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:09.420]   seeking to bring that believer to repentance.
[00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:13.040]   And if that pursuit is unsuccessful,
[00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:15.740]   then there is in verse 18, step four,
[00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:18.260]   removal from fellowship.
[00:38:18.260 --> 00:38:20.620]   If he refuses to listen even to the church,
[00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:25.620]   let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector.
[00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:30.940]   Now, I do wanna mention here that Titus 3:10-11
[00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:36.540]   does have a fast track, as it's been called,
[00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:41.540]   that may move a person quickly to removal from fellowship.
[00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:48.660]   Titus 3:10 says, "As for a person who stirs up division
[00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:53.820]   "after warning him once and then twice,
[00:38:53.820 --> 00:38:56.020]   "have nothing more to do with him,
[00:38:56.020 --> 00:38:58.620]   "knowing that such a person is warped and sinful,
[00:38:58.620 --> 00:39:02.220]   "he is self condemned."
[00:39:02.220 --> 00:39:07.220]   And so with the particular sin issue of divisiveness,
[00:39:07.220 --> 00:39:12.880]   one who seeks to stir up division because of the threat
[00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:17.980]   that person is to the unity of the church,
[00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:23.080]   there is a fast track process there where Paul says to Titus
[00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:27.640]   that you are to warn that person once and warn them twice,
[00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:30.840]   and then that person can be removed from fellowship.
[00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:33.400]   So you don't have to, with the divisive person,
[00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:36.280]   move through step one, step two, step three, step four,
[00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:41.040]   there is a fast tracking of that person's church discipline,
[00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:44.820]   which results in removal from fellowship.
[00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:49.820]   We also note in 1 Timothy 5:19-21,
[00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:55.600]   that in the particular case of elders who persist in sin,
[00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:59.980]   Paul says, "Do not admit a charge against an elder
[00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:03.220]   "except on the evidence of two or three witnesses.
[00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:05.860]   "As for those who persist in sin,
[00:40:05.860 --> 00:40:08.560]   "rebuke them in the presence of all,
[00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:11.820]   "so that the rest may stand in fear.
[00:40:11.820 --> 00:40:14.060]   "In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus
[00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:15.600]   "and of the elect angels,
[00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:20.520]   "I charge you to keep these rules without prejudging,
[00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:24.480]   "doing nothing from partiality."
[00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:29.480]   And so there is a public nature to the discipline of elders,
[00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:32.360]   and those who teach and preach the word publicly
[00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:36.180]   are to be held accountable publicly,
[00:40:36.180 --> 00:40:38.820]   and if they persist in sin,
[00:40:38.820 --> 00:40:43.820]   they are to be rebuked in the presence of all.
[00:40:45.380 --> 00:40:48.440]   And so this is not a disorganized ministry.
[00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:51.100]   So as I encourage people in our church,
[00:40:51.100 --> 00:40:54.100]   there is a sweetness to the fellowship of the local church,
[00:40:54.100 --> 00:40:57.380]   there's a beauty to the fellowship of the local church,
[00:40:57.380 --> 00:41:01.220]   we welcome anyone who loves the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:03.620]   professes the name of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:41:03.620 --> 00:41:05.880]   we welcome extroverts and introverts,
[00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:08.780]   we welcome older people, younger people,
[00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:12.160]   we welcome mature people who walk with the Lord for years,
[00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:15.680]   we welcome people who are brand new babies in the faith
[00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:19.200]   who all they know is, "I was blind, but now I see."
[00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:22.580]   We welcome anyone who loves the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:25.160]   you are welcome in the fellowship of local church,
[00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:27.820]   we will love you, we will embrace you,
[00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:30.480]   we will desire your spiritual growth.
[00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:35.320]   But there is also a sense where please do not take
[00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:40.320]   our warm and welcoming spirit in the local church
[00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:42.400]   for a spirit of weakness.
[00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:46.320]   We will do as elders what we need to do
[00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:51.280]   to guard the purity and the unity of this church.
[00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:53.480]   If you persist in unrepentant sin
[00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:57.040]   and mar the fellowship of this local church
[00:41:57.040 --> 00:42:02.040]   through a divisive spirit or a factious spirit,
[00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:05.200]   or if you cause trouble for our sheep,
[00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:09.120]   or if you persist in blatant unrepentant sin,
[00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:11.480]   that mars the testimony of this church,
[00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:16.120]   then we are charged by God to deal with that sin issue.
[00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:19.600]   And while there is a sweetness and a warmth
[00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:21.100]   and a beauty to our fellowship,
[00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:24.820]   there is also a severity to this
[00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:29.820]   that we expect you to live up to your membership covenant
[00:42:29.820 --> 00:42:32.220]   that you will not cause division,
[00:42:32.220 --> 00:42:33.840]   and that you will not cause trouble,
[00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:38.840]   you will not mar the unity or the testimony of this church.
[00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:41.760]   If you are humble and if you are repentant,
[00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:42.640]   we will love you.
[00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:44.640]   If you are weak, we will seek to strengthen you.
[00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:48.020]   If you're discouraged, we will seek to encourage you.
[00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:51.620]   But if you are hard of heart,
[00:42:51.620 --> 00:42:54.720]   and if you come in and cause trouble,
[00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:59.720]   and if you seek to hinder the sheep of God
[00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:02.160]   from pursuing the things of God,
[00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:04.280]   then we will deal with you.
[00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:08.840]   And in fact, in the bylaws of Kindred Community Church,
[00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:11.080]   there's actually a provision that states
[00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:15.600]   that the elders of the church are given the right
[00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:19.540]   and the authority that if we, through a judgment call,
[00:43:19.540 --> 00:43:25.420]   deem anyone a threat or a disturbance on our campus
[00:43:25.420 --> 00:43:30.420]   to the unity or to the fellowship of our local church,
[00:43:30.420 --> 00:43:33.080]   then we have the right to ask that person
[00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:37.500]   to get off the campus and the property of our church.
[00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:40.780]   And we don't have to go through step one, two, three,
[00:43:40.780 --> 00:43:44.520]   and four to do that if we deem that person
[00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:48.180]   an immediate threat or disturbance to the church.
[00:43:48.180 --> 00:43:52.200]   And we have had to exercise that clause,
[00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:55.360]   thankfully not often or every week,
[00:43:55.360 --> 00:43:58.040]   but there have been occasions where a person
[00:43:58.040 --> 00:44:01.440]   has come onto our campus and has been disruptive
[00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:06.400]   or has been obviously divisive in our midst,
[00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:08.960]   and we have had to deal with that person.
[00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:10.400]   And we will deal with that person
[00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:13.900]   because that is our charge as elders of the church,
[00:44:13.900 --> 00:44:17.440]   to guard the unity and the purity of this church.
[00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:19.640]   Now, I hope you know by now,
[00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:21.440]   if you've listened to me long enough,
[00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:24.160]   everything I say is gonna be balanced.
[00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:28.240]   You can be the weakest believer in Christ,
[00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:31.200]   and you are honestly, you're seeking to repent of sin,
[00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:33.280]   you're just struggling with sin,
[00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:36.720]   you're just being, you're just struggling
[00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:38.880]   to overcome a particular sin.
[00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:42.000]   We will love you, and we will work with you,
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.080]   and we will be patient and gentle,
[00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:46.860]   and we will wrap our arms around you.
[00:44:46.860 --> 00:44:51.860]   But that's different from someone who is obviously divisive
[00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:57.040]   or who is continuing in hardness of heart.
[00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:03.160]   And so this is not a disorganized ministry.
[00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:08.120]   Now, I do have just to kind of underscore,
[00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:11.680]   and I don't wanna belabor the point here,
[00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:15.800]   but we have had occasions
[00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:18.520]   where we have had to practice church discipline
[00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:20.000]   in our local church.
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   And this is obviously a very sad and sorrowful occasion.
[00:45:27.620 --> 00:45:32.620]   We never exercise church discipline with any type of joy.
[00:45:32.620 --> 00:45:38.480]   This is one of the saddest occasions in ministry
[00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:42.280]   as a pastor to have to move to a step four
[00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:45.760]   of a church discipline process.
[00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:50.760]   And yet it must be done in certain clear occasions.
[00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:58.220]   This must be done in order that the purity
[00:45:58.220 --> 00:46:01.300]   of the local church can be preserved.
[00:46:01.300 --> 00:46:04.660]   It must be done so that others may understand
[00:46:04.660 --> 00:46:06.580]   that they are accountable,
[00:46:06.580 --> 00:46:08.500]   that we may have a fresh reminder
[00:46:08.500 --> 00:46:12.980]   that you cannot be part of our local church
[00:46:12.980 --> 00:46:17.980]   and be involved in an ongoing adulterous relationship,
[00:46:17.980 --> 00:46:22.080]   and then expect that the church is not going to do anything
[00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:23.420]   about that relationship.
[00:46:23.420 --> 00:46:25.500]   We're just gonna allow you to persist in sin
[00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:30.500]   and retain a membership that is in good standing.
[00:46:30.500 --> 00:46:32.720]   That is not gonna happen
[00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:36.900]   as part of our local church's ministry.
[00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:39.940]   We have to deal with those types of sins
[00:46:39.940 --> 00:46:44.260]   that mar the public testimony of the church.
[00:46:44.260 --> 00:46:47.220]   And so I just want you to understand
[00:46:47.220 --> 00:46:49.420]   that that is the structure
[00:46:49.420 --> 00:46:54.420]   underneath counseling ministry operates.
[00:46:54.420 --> 00:46:58.020]   The counseling ministry operates in accountability
[00:46:58.020 --> 00:47:00.860]   to the local church's ministry
[00:47:00.860 --> 00:47:02.980]   and the elders of the local church
[00:47:02.980 --> 00:47:07.980]   are charged to exercise the ministry of church discipline.
[00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:12.640]   So what church discipline is?
[00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:15.000]   Letter A, an expression of humility.
[00:47:17.380 --> 00:47:18.980]   Jesus said this, right?
[00:47:18.980 --> 00:47:21.060]   That you are to take the log out of your own eye
[00:47:21.060 --> 00:47:24.260]   before you can take the speck out of your brother's eye.
[00:47:24.260 --> 00:47:27.900]   Galatians 6, you who are spiritual
[00:47:27.900 --> 00:47:31.820]   are to be the ones who exercise this ministry.
[00:47:31.820 --> 00:47:37.480]   We never wanna exercise church discipline
[00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:40.060]   in a prideful or self-righteous spirit.
[00:47:40.060 --> 00:47:41.660]   As I mentioned, letter B,
[00:47:41.660 --> 00:47:45.260]   it should be accompanied with sorrow.
[00:47:45.260 --> 00:47:47.380]   1 Corinthians 5, verse two,
[00:47:47.380 --> 00:47:51.780]   Paul rebukes the prideful arrogance
[00:47:51.780 --> 00:47:53.860]   of the Corinthian church
[00:47:53.860 --> 00:47:56.580]   that they allowed unrepentant sexual immorality
[00:47:56.580 --> 00:47:58.820]   to exist in their fellowship.
[00:47:58.820 --> 00:48:03.820]   He says, you are arrogant, ought you not rather to mourn.
[00:48:03.820 --> 00:48:09.580]   Let him who has done this be removed from among you.
[00:48:09.580 --> 00:48:13.460]   And in 2 Corinthians 2, verse four,
[00:48:13.460 --> 00:48:15.460]   Paul says, for I wrote to you
[00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:19.300]   out of much affliction and anguish of heart
[00:48:19.300 --> 00:48:23.660]   and with many tears, not to cause you pain,
[00:48:23.660 --> 00:48:29.500]   but to let you know the abundant love that I have for you.
[00:48:29.500 --> 00:48:31.140]   I understand this as a pastor,
[00:48:31.140 --> 00:48:35.860]   a little bit of what Paul was talking about here.
[00:48:35.860 --> 00:48:38.620]   Believers who are hardened of heart,
[00:48:38.620 --> 00:48:42.820]   and this last year as we, in our own local church,
[00:48:42.820 --> 00:48:46.940]   had to exercise step four of church discipline.
[00:48:46.940 --> 00:48:49.420]   And to let you know, quite honestly,
[00:48:49.420 --> 00:48:51.420]   I was emotionally devastated
[00:48:51.420 --> 00:48:57.580]   by the prospect of one who is so hardened of sin
[00:48:57.580 --> 00:49:00.500]   that this person would not repent,
[00:49:00.500 --> 00:49:03.100]   even if that discipline process moved
[00:49:03.100 --> 00:49:06.580]   to removal from fellowship.
[00:49:06.580 --> 00:49:09.660]   That there's no way to do this type of ministry
[00:49:09.660 --> 00:49:13.140]   without what Paul calls the affliction
[00:49:13.140 --> 00:49:18.100]   and anguish of heart and with many tears.
[00:49:18.100 --> 00:49:22.460]   It should be accompanied with sorrow,
[00:49:22.460 --> 00:49:27.340]   and yet there is joy when there is restoration.
[00:49:27.340 --> 00:49:32.340]   The goal should be full restoration of fellowship.
[00:49:32.340 --> 00:49:35.220]   As the Grace Community Church statement
[00:49:35.220 --> 00:49:36.820]   on church discipline notes,
[00:49:36.820 --> 00:49:38.180]   the goal of church discipline then
[00:49:38.180 --> 00:49:40.340]   is not to throw people out of the church
[00:49:40.340 --> 00:49:44.180]   or to feed the self-righteous pride
[00:49:44.180 --> 00:49:47.380]   of those who administer the discipline.
[00:49:47.380 --> 00:49:48.940]   It is not to embarrass people
[00:49:48.940 --> 00:49:53.380]   or to exercise authority and power in some unbiblical manner.
[00:49:53.380 --> 00:49:58.380]   The purpose is to restore a sinning believer to holiness
[00:49:58.380 --> 00:50:03.780]   and to bring him back to a pure relationship
[00:50:03.780 --> 00:50:05.740]   within the assembly.
[00:50:05.740 --> 00:50:06.700]   John MacArthur writes,
[00:50:06.700 --> 00:50:10.260]   "The word restore simply means to repair something
[00:50:10.260 --> 00:50:12.340]   "in the sense of bringing it back
[00:50:12.340 --> 00:50:15.900]   "to its former condition.
[00:50:15.900 --> 00:50:19.980]   "It is used of reconciling two arguing factions,
[00:50:19.980 --> 00:50:22.380]   "of setting bones that are broken,
[00:50:22.380 --> 00:50:26.100]   "of putting a dislocated limb back into its proper place
[00:50:26.100 --> 00:50:28.140]   "and of mending broken nets."
[00:50:28.140 --> 00:50:29.980]   That word is a very common one
[00:50:29.980 --> 00:50:32.700]   for knitting something together
[00:50:32.700 --> 00:50:36.220]   or restoring it to its original condition,
[00:50:36.220 --> 00:50:41.220]   and that's exactly what it's calling us to.
[00:50:41.220 --> 00:50:45.980]   And so that is always the goal in church discipline.
[00:50:45.980 --> 00:50:50.380]   Just a note here on page five of your handout,
[00:50:50.380 --> 00:50:53.940]   I'm not gonna read through the entire bylaws here,
[00:50:53.940 --> 00:50:56.700]   but the bylaws of Kindred Community Church
[00:50:56.700 --> 00:51:01.060]   clearly have an article on church membership
[00:51:01.060 --> 00:51:03.580]   and then a section on church discipline
[00:51:03.580 --> 00:51:07.420]   and member removal.
[00:51:07.420 --> 00:51:08.540]   The bylaws state that,
[00:51:08.540 --> 00:51:12.100]   "Discipline is an important aspect of church life
[00:51:12.100 --> 00:51:14.140]   "in preserving the holiness and purity
[00:51:14.140 --> 00:51:15.220]   "of the bride of Christ
[00:51:15.220 --> 00:51:18.580]   "so that we do not bring dishonor to our Lord Jesus.
[00:51:18.580 --> 00:51:20.900]   "Discipline may take on many different avenues
[00:51:20.900 --> 00:51:22.620]   "and follow different processes
[00:51:22.620 --> 00:51:25.020]   "depending on the type of sin involved,
[00:51:25.020 --> 00:51:27.060]   "its overt or covert nature
[00:51:27.060 --> 00:51:30.500]   "and the immediacy of the impact on the church.
[00:51:30.500 --> 00:51:33.060]   "In scripture, we find discipline administered
[00:51:33.060 --> 00:51:34.100]   "in many different forms,
[00:51:34.100 --> 00:51:37.940]   "including but not limited to such examples,
[00:51:37.940 --> 00:51:40.140]   "sin or wrong between two believers,
[00:51:40.140 --> 00:51:43.860]   "the overt sexual sin of a man and his stepmother,
[00:51:43.860 --> 00:51:47.380]   "false teaching and divisiveness.
[00:51:47.380 --> 00:51:49.780]   "All sin will be dealt with
[00:51:49.780 --> 00:51:52.500]   "in keeping with the appropriate scriptural direction
[00:51:52.500 --> 00:51:54.420]   "and guidelines."
[00:51:54.420 --> 00:51:59.180]   So that is clearly spelled out in the bylaws,
[00:51:59.180 --> 00:52:04.180]   and that is an essential ministry of the church.
[00:52:04.180 --> 00:52:06.420]   As I mentioned, as I've taught membership class here
[00:52:06.420 --> 00:52:10.020]   for years, I used to downplay this aspect
[00:52:10.020 --> 00:52:11.580]   of the church's ministry,
[00:52:11.580 --> 00:52:14.540]   almost feeling like, well, it seems so harsh.
[00:52:14.540 --> 00:52:18.420]   No one's ever gonna wanna become a member of my church.
[00:52:18.420 --> 00:52:22.260]   If I really emphasize this in the membership class,
[00:52:22.260 --> 00:52:24.020]   people are gonna turn away and say,
[00:52:24.020 --> 00:52:26.220]   "I don't wanna be a member of this church,"
[00:52:26.220 --> 00:52:30.060]   only to find in so many membership interviews
[00:52:30.060 --> 00:52:34.660]   over the years, people who have said to me directly
[00:52:34.660 --> 00:52:38.940]   that I am so thankful that I get to be part
[00:52:38.940 --> 00:52:43.620]   of a local church that actually practices church discipline
[00:52:43.620 --> 00:52:46.900]   and that seeks to hold its members accountable.
[00:52:46.900 --> 00:52:48.860]   I need that type of accountability.
[00:52:48.860 --> 00:52:50.500]   I want to be part of a church
[00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:53.140]   that has that type of accountability.
[00:52:53.140 --> 00:52:56.220]   And so I have found that there is a hunger
[00:52:56.220 --> 00:52:59.660]   and a desire of true believers in Christ
[00:52:59.660 --> 00:53:02.020]   who know that they wanna live a godly life,
[00:53:02.020 --> 00:53:05.720]   who know that they live in a sin-filled world,
[00:53:05.720 --> 00:53:08.740]   that they desire to be part of a local church
[00:53:08.740 --> 00:53:11.380]   that actually practices church discipline.
[00:53:11.380 --> 00:53:14.020]   So at some point, I stopped downplaying it
[00:53:14.020 --> 00:53:18.180]   and started just emphasizing it, that this is what we do.
[00:53:18.180 --> 00:53:19.700]   We practice church discipline
[00:53:19.700 --> 00:53:21.980]   because we take purity seriously,
[00:53:21.980 --> 00:53:25.420]   we take holiness seriously, we take the church seriously.
[00:53:25.420 --> 00:53:28.980]   We will love you and we will seek to help you
[00:53:28.980 --> 00:53:30.940]   if you struggle with sin.
[00:53:30.940 --> 00:53:35.820]   But if you teach false doctrine here, we will discipline you.
[00:53:35.820 --> 00:53:40.200]   If you engage in an ongoing adulterous relationship
[00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:43.460]   in our church, we are going to discipline you.
[00:53:43.460 --> 00:53:48.460]   If you defraud other believers financially
[00:53:48.580 --> 00:53:52.340]   in shady financial dealings, we will deal with you.
[00:53:52.340 --> 00:53:54.540]   We will practice church discipline
[00:53:54.540 --> 00:53:55.940]   for the purpose of restoration,
[00:53:55.940 --> 00:53:58.060]   but we will hold you accountable.
[00:53:58.060 --> 00:54:01.580]   And I found that believers desire to live
[00:54:01.580 --> 00:54:05.460]   in a fellowship with a church
[00:54:05.460 --> 00:54:08.580]   that practices church discipline.
[00:54:08.580 --> 00:54:12.900]   So I do need to move on to counseling exam number 11,
[00:54:12.900 --> 00:54:17.400]   but what you wanna do in the exam number 10
[00:54:17.400 --> 00:54:21.460]   is to write a very straightforward summary
[00:54:21.460 --> 00:54:24.780]   of what you believe is the church discipline process.
[00:54:24.780 --> 00:54:28.780]   I would just encourage you to articulate a view
[00:54:28.780 --> 00:54:32.140]   of the four steps of church discipline,
[00:54:32.140 --> 00:54:35.060]   private conversation, semi-private conversation,
[00:54:35.060 --> 00:54:38.020]   church-wide pursuit, and then disfellowship.
[00:54:38.020 --> 00:54:42.420]   I would just encourage you to write out the steps
[00:54:42.420 --> 00:54:44.740]   and then the purpose of church discipline
[00:54:44.740 --> 00:54:48.280]   and what we're trying to accomplish in church discipline,
[00:54:48.280 --> 00:54:51.680]   and then articulate a view of how biblical counseling
[00:54:51.680 --> 00:54:54.880]   is a ministry of the local church
[00:54:54.880 --> 00:54:57.440]   and therefore has a relationship
[00:54:57.440 --> 00:55:01.840]   with the essential function of church discipline.
[00:55:01.840 --> 00:55:06.840]   Now, let me move quickly to counseling exam number 11.
[00:55:06.840 --> 00:55:10.560]   I'm gonna skip this very helpful flowchart
[00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:12.800]   that you can find online from Bill Zimmer's
[00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:14.400]   "How to Practice Church Discipline."
[00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:16.120]   I found this very helpful.
[00:55:16.120 --> 00:55:17.920]   I'm not gonna have time to go over this,
[00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:20.600]   but he has a very helpful flowchart here
[00:55:20.600 --> 00:55:21.920]   that moves you step-by-step
[00:55:21.920 --> 00:55:24.480]   through the process of church discipline,
[00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:28.320]   and I believe you can find this flowchart online
[00:55:28.320 --> 00:55:31.520]   and have that as a reference for future study.
[00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:36.240]   But let me move to counseling exam number 11
[00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:38.280]   and give you just a brief overview
[00:55:38.280 --> 00:55:42.180]   of confidentiality in biblical counseling.
[00:55:43.360 --> 00:55:45.080]   The question is, describe what you believe
[00:55:45.080 --> 00:55:48.480]   to be the role of confidentiality in biblical counseling.
[00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:51.120]   What kind of commitment to confidentiality
[00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:53.320]   should a biblical counselor make?
[00:55:53.320 --> 00:55:56.140]   What biblical and practical considerations
[00:55:56.140 --> 00:55:58.400]   limit confidentiality?
[00:55:58.400 --> 00:56:01.440]   What is the responsibility of a biblical counselor
[00:56:01.440 --> 00:56:03.960]   to report to civil authorities
[00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:06.080]   on matters of domestic violence,
[00:56:06.080 --> 00:56:09.160]   sexual abuse, and other illegal matters?
[00:56:09.160 --> 00:56:11.480]   How should biblical counselors cooperate
[00:56:11.480 --> 00:56:13.800]   with the authorities about these things?
[00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:18.560]   So this is an exam question about confidentiality
[00:56:18.560 --> 00:56:21.840]   and the limitations of confidentiality.
[00:56:21.840 --> 00:56:25.760]   Now let me just make a statement here,
[00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:29.480]   and this is from Heath Lambert's excellent podcast
[00:56:29.480 --> 00:56:31.480]   on the ACBC website.
[00:56:31.480 --> 00:56:35.760]   I've given you the link to that in your Dropbox folder,
[00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:40.700]   but Dr. Lambert states that the Bible places limits
[00:56:40.700 --> 00:56:45.360]   on the confidentiality we can promise to our counselees.
[00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:48.040]   Now that is a very helpful statement,
[00:56:48.040 --> 00:56:50.120]   and I think this is really at the heart
[00:56:50.120 --> 00:56:53.840]   of the exam questions.
[00:56:53.840 --> 00:56:58.320]   As biblical counselors, let me just kind of state this
[00:56:58.320 --> 00:56:59.160]   and emphasize this.
[00:56:59.160 --> 00:57:04.160]   We want to have discretion
[00:57:04.160 --> 00:57:06.880]   in how we handle sensitive information,
[00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:11.880]   and we want to be known for general confidentiality.
[00:57:11.880 --> 00:57:15.160]   If a counselee tells you something
[00:57:15.160 --> 00:57:17.500]   in a counseling relationship,
[00:57:17.500 --> 00:57:19.820]   you want to be known for your discretion.
[00:57:19.820 --> 00:57:22.420]   You don't want to spread that information
[00:57:22.420 --> 00:57:26.100]   to anyone who does not need to know that information.
[00:57:26.100 --> 00:57:28.020]   You don't want to share that information
[00:57:28.020 --> 00:57:30.900]   with your small group or with your friend
[00:57:30.900 --> 00:57:35.740]   or share that widely in a churchwide prayer meeting.
[00:57:36.780 --> 00:57:39.020]   You want to do everything you can
[00:57:39.020 --> 00:57:43.540]   to build trust with your counselee,
[00:57:43.540 --> 00:57:47.060]   and that in most cases, in a general sense,
[00:57:47.060 --> 00:57:49.760]   means that you are discreet with information.
[00:57:49.760 --> 00:57:54.100]   You know how to handle sensitive information.
[00:57:54.100 --> 00:57:57.020]   You don't disclose information to others
[00:57:57.020 --> 00:58:02.020]   unless it is wise or biblically necessary to do so.
[00:58:02.340 --> 00:58:07.060]   So you do want to be known for having confidentiality.
[00:58:07.060 --> 00:58:08.260]   You do want to be known
[00:58:08.260 --> 00:58:12.520]   for being trustworthy with information.
[00:58:12.520 --> 00:58:18.500]   And so as your handout states under letter A,
[00:58:18.500 --> 00:58:22.300]   the value of general confidentiality,
[00:58:22.300 --> 00:58:24.500]   Proverbs 10 verse 18 says,
[00:58:24.500 --> 00:58:27.380]   "The one who conceals hatred has lying lips,
[00:58:27.380 --> 00:58:31.120]   "and whoever utters slander is a fool."
[00:58:32.280 --> 00:58:34.900]   George Scipione has an excellent treatment
[00:58:34.900 --> 00:58:39.900]   of the idea of, in his article on confidentiality,
[00:58:39.900 --> 00:58:41.700]   that if you are a counselor
[00:58:41.700 --> 00:58:43.580]   who is taking sensitive information
[00:58:43.580 --> 00:58:47.060]   and then spreading it unwisely
[00:58:47.060 --> 00:58:49.920]   outside of the circle of those who need to know about it,
[00:58:49.920 --> 00:58:54.920]   then you are actually, can be slandering your counselee.
[00:58:54.920 --> 00:58:58.260]   And therefore, you can do great damage
[00:58:58.260 --> 00:59:00.920]   to that counseling relationship.
[00:59:02.060 --> 00:59:03.320]   Proverbs 11 verse 13,
[00:59:03.320 --> 00:59:05.920]   "Whoever goes about slandering reveals secrets,
[00:59:05.920 --> 00:59:10.920]   "but he who is trustworthy in spirit keeps a thing covered."
[00:59:10.920 --> 00:59:15.400]   So know what to do with sensitive information.
[00:59:15.400 --> 00:59:18.440]   Know when you are biblically mandated
[00:59:18.440 --> 00:59:20.620]   to disclose it to others.
[00:59:20.620 --> 00:59:24.000]   And in other cases where it is not wise
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:26.240]   for others to know about that information,
[00:59:26.240 --> 00:59:29.280]   keep that information covered.
[00:59:29.280 --> 00:59:34.260]   Keep, know how to handle that in a trustworthy manner.
[00:59:34.260 --> 00:59:37.180]   That's a very essential ingredient,
[00:59:37.180 --> 00:59:40.700]   a very essential characteristic of a wise biblical counselor.
[00:59:40.700 --> 00:59:44.120]   Proverbs 20 verse five, verse nine,
[00:59:44.120 --> 00:59:46.460]   "Argue your case with your neighbor himself
[00:59:46.460 --> 00:59:51.460]   "and do not reveal another's secret."
[00:59:51.460 --> 00:59:57.980]   So in general, you don't want to disclose information
[00:59:59.140 --> 01:00:02.220]   that you don't need to disclose.
[01:00:02.220 --> 01:00:05.600]   You don't wanna be a gossip or a busybody
[01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:10.520]   as it is stated in 1 Timothy chapter five, verse 13.
[01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:14.460]   "You want to be a model of good works."
[01:00:14.460 --> 01:00:16.280]   Titus two verse seven,
[01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:18.480]   "And in your teaching show integrity,
[01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:22.540]   "dignity and sound speech."
[01:00:22.540 --> 01:00:26.900]   So you wanna be self-controlled with your speech
[01:00:26.900 --> 01:00:31.700]   and not share things that you don't need to share.
[01:00:31.700 --> 01:00:35.040]   And there is great value in that.
[01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:37.740]   If you look at the top of your handout on page seven,
[01:00:37.740 --> 01:00:42.020]   this is from the ACBC Standards of Conduct.
[01:00:42.020 --> 01:00:44.080]   And the standards say this,
[01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:45.900]   "Biblical counselors must maintain
[01:00:45.900 --> 01:00:47.800]   "and communicate the biblical standards
[01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:49.260]   "for confidentiality."
[01:00:49.260 --> 01:00:52.920]   So we are pro-confidentiality in general.
[01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:55.740]   "Trust grows in relationships
[01:00:55.740 --> 01:00:58.700]   "where all parties have clear expectations
[01:00:58.700 --> 01:01:03.140]   "regarding the confidential nature of private information.
[01:01:03.140 --> 01:01:07.340]   "Biblical counselors seek to maintain trust and integrity
[01:01:07.340 --> 01:01:12.340]   "by keeping personal information as private as possible.
[01:01:12.340 --> 01:01:15.640]   "Biblical counselors protect the reputation
[01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:18.540]   "of their counselees by avoiding reckless
[01:01:18.540 --> 01:01:23.180]   "and unnecessary disclosures of personal information.
[01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:25.640]   "Biblical counselors must also make clear
[01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:29.080]   "their counselees that a commitment to biblical authority
[01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:33.380]   "requires the disclosure of certain kinds of information
[01:01:33.380 --> 01:01:34.460]   "to certain parties."
[01:01:34.460 --> 01:01:36.420]   Now that's the balance.
[01:01:36.420 --> 01:01:39.740]   In general, and I loved how the standards articulate
[01:01:39.740 --> 01:01:41.720]   in the beginning of that statement,
[01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:45.800]   that we are to be known for our confidentiality,
[01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:48.500]   and yet there are limitations
[01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:54.720]   to what we can keep private.
[01:01:55.700 --> 01:01:57.420]   "There are certain kinds of information
[01:01:57.420 --> 01:01:59.620]   "that must be disclosed.
[01:01:59.620 --> 01:02:03.080]   "A biblical commitment to protect counselees from harm,
[01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:06.060]   "as well as commitments to the authority of the home,
[01:02:06.060 --> 01:02:10.540]   "church, or state, may require disclosure of information
[01:02:10.540 --> 01:02:15.540]   "that counselees would otherwise prefer to remain private."
[01:02:15.540 --> 01:02:18.300]   So in our Consent to Counsel documents,
[01:02:18.300 --> 01:02:21.640]   I've given you a copy of that in your Dropbox folder,
[01:02:22.700 --> 01:02:25.320]   we state quite clearly
[01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:29.640]   that we cannot promise absolute confidentiality.
[01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:33.640]   We will seek to practice general confidentiality,
[01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:38.640]   but we cannot promise absolute or strict confidentiality.
[01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:43.840]   We cannot guarantee 100% confidentiality
[01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:46.000]   in our counseling ministry.
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:47.720]   That's all stated and written,
[01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:51.040]   and the counseling must sign their assent
[01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:55.140]   and their agreement with that approach to counseling
[01:02:55.140 --> 01:02:57.960]   in order to receive biblical counseling,
[01:02:57.960 --> 01:03:01.080]   because there are certain cases
[01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:05.840]   where we must disclose information.
[01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:10.680]   And so what about the limitations of confidentiality?
[01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:15.080]   This is from Deepak Raju's excellent blog article
[01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:18.620]   on strict confidentiality
[01:03:18.620 --> 01:03:20.700]   from the Biblical Counseling Coalition blog.
[01:03:20.700 --> 01:03:23.320]   He writes, "One of the assumptions that I was taught
[01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:25.500]   "when I first entered the counseling world
[01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:27.860]   "was strict confidentiality.
[01:03:27.860 --> 01:03:31.340]   "In strict confidentiality,
[01:03:31.340 --> 01:03:34.940]   "otherwise known as absolute confidentiality,
[01:03:34.940 --> 01:03:39.420]   "you, as a counselor, promise never to tell anyone else
[01:03:39.420 --> 01:03:41.880]   "about the counselee's promise.
[01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:44.240]   "The counselee is taking the very risky step
[01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:45.800]   "of revealing his sin to you,
[01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:48.400]   "and he finds security in knowing
[01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:51.680]   "that no one else will ever know his junk."
[01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:53.300]   Now, the question is,
[01:03:53.300 --> 01:03:57.520]   can we promise strict confidentiality?
[01:03:57.520 --> 01:04:01.500]   Deepak Raju argues that the answer is no.
[01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:05.980]   He says that strict confidentiality is not possible
[01:04:05.980 --> 01:04:07.800]   for Christians who practice counseling
[01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:11.140]   in the context of a local church.
[01:04:11.140 --> 01:04:13.980]   If a person is not willing to repent of a sin,
[01:04:13.980 --> 01:04:16.500]   the counselor must eventually expose the sinner
[01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:17.620]   to the church.
[01:04:17.620 --> 01:04:20.420]   If we are going to follow the ethics of the Bible,
[01:04:20.420 --> 01:04:23.140]   it is not an option for us to conceal
[01:04:23.140 --> 01:04:25.480]   an unrepentant sinner's sin.
[01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:27.420]   Granted, many of us, as counselors,
[01:04:27.420 --> 01:04:29.500]   will persevere for a long time,
[01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:32.520]   exhorting, persuading, pleading with a sinner to turn,
[01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:34.400]   but if he or she does not,
[01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:37.120]   we're left with one or two options,
[01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:41.980]   bring a second witness, and then bring it to the church.
[01:04:41.980 --> 01:04:43.300]   And so you see the connection
[01:04:43.300 --> 01:04:46.580]   between church discipline,
[01:04:46.580 --> 01:04:49.060]   and which is exam question number 10,
[01:04:49.060 --> 01:04:53.640]   and confidentiality, which is exam question number 11.
[01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:57.740]   We practice confidentiality
[01:04:57.740 --> 01:05:02.100]   unless we are compelled to, by scripture,
[01:05:02.100 --> 01:05:04.580]   to widen the circle of information.
[01:05:04.580 --> 01:05:09.380]   And one of the cases in which we must widen the circle
[01:05:09.380 --> 01:05:11.040]   of those who know about the issue
[01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:16.040]   is if we are following Matthew 18, verses 15 to 20,
[01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:20.380]   and engaging in step two of church discipline.
[01:05:20.380 --> 01:05:24.580]   So some guiding principles which limit confidentiality,
[01:05:24.580 --> 01:05:28.260]   first would be submission to the elders of the local church,
[01:05:28.260 --> 01:05:30.500]   Hebrews 13, verse 17,
[01:05:30.500 --> 01:05:32.100]   obey your leaders and submit to them
[01:05:32.100 --> 01:05:34.500]   for they're keeping watch over your souls,
[01:05:34.500 --> 01:05:38.980]   as to those who will have to give an account,
[01:05:38.980 --> 01:05:40.140]   let them do this with joy
[01:05:40.140 --> 01:05:41.960]   and not with groaning for that would be
[01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:45.940]   of no advantage to you.
[01:05:45.940 --> 01:05:48.860]   And so a counseling ministry operates in submission
[01:05:48.860 --> 01:05:51.580]   to the elders of a local church,
[01:05:51.580 --> 01:05:55.320]   and there may be cases in which the elder board
[01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:57.740]   of a local church needs to be notified
[01:05:57.740 --> 01:06:02.380]   of the issue being dealt with in counseling ministry.
[01:06:02.380 --> 01:06:05.260]   It requires wisdom and discernment to know
[01:06:05.260 --> 01:06:07.520]   when that disclosure is to take place,
[01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:12.100]   and yet, we need to understand that there is a limitation
[01:06:12.100 --> 01:06:17.100]   of confidentiality that is placed upon the counseling
[01:06:17.100 --> 01:06:20.700]   ministry because of that ministry's relationship
[01:06:20.700 --> 01:06:23.100]   with the elders of the church.
[01:06:23.100 --> 01:06:25.420]   The second limitation would be submission
[01:06:25.420 --> 01:06:26.780]   to governing authorities,
[01:06:26.780 --> 01:06:28.460]   Romans 13, verse one,
[01:06:28.460 --> 01:06:32.460]   that every person be subject to the governing authorities.
[01:06:33.860 --> 01:06:36.840]   And so quite simply,
[01:06:36.840 --> 01:06:41.840]   if a counselee has disclosed the involvement
[01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:45.320]   with a criminal act,
[01:06:45.320 --> 01:06:49.600]   we as biblical counselors don't have client counselor
[01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:51.920]   privilege that we can invoke and say,
[01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:53.420]   well, we're not gonna cooperate
[01:06:53.420 --> 01:06:54.880]   with the governmental authorities
[01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:59.560]   because we have some type of client counselor privilege.
[01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:02.000]   We don't have that type of privilege.
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:05.260]   We are to report to the authorities
[01:07:05.260 --> 01:07:09.300]   if a counselee is engaged in criminal matters
[01:07:09.300 --> 01:07:12.140]   and then cooperate fully with prosecution
[01:07:12.140 --> 01:07:15.860]   or ongoing investigation because we are submitting
[01:07:15.860 --> 01:07:19.840]   to the authorities as we submit to the Lord.
[01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:24.940]   And so there is submission to governing authority.
[01:07:24.940 --> 01:07:28.160]   George Scipioni writes four principles
[01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:31.500]   of the limitations of confidentiality.
[01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:34.020]   Number one, confidentiality or loyalty
[01:07:34.020 --> 01:07:37.060]   to a counselee is the general rule.
[01:07:37.060 --> 01:07:40.340]   So yes, we practice confidentiality.
[01:07:40.340 --> 01:07:42.620]   Number two, when knowledge of crimes
[01:07:42.620 --> 01:07:45.940]   or potential crimes against God and neighbor come to light,
[01:07:45.940 --> 01:07:48.900]   the person must be exhorted to repent
[01:07:48.900 --> 01:07:53.900]   in order to restore or maintain biblically defined justice.
[01:07:53.900 --> 01:07:58.900]   That's the Romans 13 principle.
[01:07:58.900 --> 01:08:00.700]   Number three, when exhortation fails,
[01:08:00.700 --> 01:08:03.300]   contacting the appropriate God-ordained authorities
[01:08:03.300 --> 01:08:05.300]   for further exhortation and discipline
[01:08:05.300 --> 01:08:07.020]   is appropriate action.
[01:08:07.020 --> 01:08:08.900]   These authorities are the family, church,
[01:08:08.900 --> 01:08:10.940]   and society, business, or state.
[01:08:10.940 --> 01:08:13.860]   I'd encourage you to read Scipioni's article on that.
[01:08:13.860 --> 01:08:17.300]   He has some case studies and illustrations
[01:08:17.300 --> 01:08:22.300]   of when it may be wise to disclose information
[01:08:22.300 --> 01:08:25.660]   outside of the counseling relationship.
[01:08:25.660 --> 01:08:28.860]   And those illustrations are very helpful.
[01:08:28.860 --> 01:08:31.020]   I don't have time to get into all of that
[01:08:31.020 --> 01:08:32.740]   in our session today.
[01:08:32.740 --> 01:08:34.620]   Number four, a promise or an assumption
[01:08:34.620 --> 01:08:38.480]   of total confidentiality in all circumstances
[01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:42.660]   is inappropriate for counselors in general
[01:08:42.660 --> 01:08:44.980]   and Christian counselors in particular.
[01:08:44.980 --> 01:08:48.160]   That is making a promise that we cannot keep.
[01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:51.540]   So if you look at our consent to counsel document,
[01:08:51.540 --> 01:08:55.400]   this is the document we use as an intake form
[01:08:55.400 --> 01:08:57.860]   for those who are requesting biblical counseling
[01:08:57.860 --> 01:08:59.780]   from our ministry.
[01:08:59.780 --> 01:09:03.380]   And you will note that it is clearly stated
[01:09:03.380 --> 01:09:08.380]   the examples of situations where we will need
[01:09:08.380 --> 01:09:11.600]   to disclose information.
[01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:16.660]   We write that confidentiality is an important aspect
[01:09:16.660 --> 01:09:18.480]   of the counseling process.
[01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:21.380]   And we will carefully guard the information
[01:09:21.380 --> 01:09:23.820]   you entrust to us.
[01:09:23.820 --> 01:09:26.020]   We have taken pains in our counseling ministry
[01:09:26.020 --> 01:09:27.940]   to, we've probably gone overboard
[01:09:27.940 --> 01:09:31.100]   to even when it comes to documents and notes
[01:09:31.100 --> 01:09:34.300]   and just things that we write down
[01:09:34.300 --> 01:09:38.780]   as a result of meeting with a counselee
[01:09:38.780 --> 01:09:42.060]   to secure that information,
[01:09:42.060 --> 01:09:47.060]   to make that data as private and as secure as possible.
[01:09:47.060 --> 01:09:50.780]   I've been told by others,
[01:09:50.780 --> 01:09:53.180]   Dan, I'm not sure if we need to make it
[01:09:53.180 --> 01:09:54.900]   do that much data security,
[01:09:54.900 --> 01:09:57.540]   but I'm just coming from a standpoint
[01:09:57.540 --> 01:10:02.540]   of we wanna carefully guard the information entrusted to us.
[01:10:02.540 --> 01:10:07.540]   And we do believe in confidentiality.
[01:10:07.540 --> 01:10:11.060]   However, we do not promise absolute confidentiality.
[01:10:11.060 --> 01:10:13.700]   Your counselor reserves the right to consult
[01:10:13.700 --> 01:10:15.420]   with other counselors or pastors
[01:10:15.420 --> 01:10:17.180]   at Kinder Community Church for the purpose
[01:10:17.180 --> 01:10:20.300]   of providing the highest level of care.
[01:10:20.300 --> 01:10:22.960]   Additionally, there are times when counseling information
[01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:27.100]   may be shared outside the Kinder Community Church context.
[01:10:27.100 --> 01:10:29.100]   Those exceptions would include,
[01:10:29.100 --> 01:10:31.660]   but are not limited to the following,
[01:10:31.660 --> 01:10:36.420]   known or suspected child abuse or elder abuse of any kind,
[01:10:36.420 --> 01:10:38.660]   the intent to take criminal actions
[01:10:38.660 --> 01:10:40.980]   or violence against another person,
[01:10:40.980 --> 01:10:44.300]   active suicidal thoughts or intentions,
[01:10:44.300 --> 01:10:47.940]   other credible intent to harm self or others
[01:10:47.940 --> 01:10:50.580]   and matters of church discipline.
[01:10:50.580 --> 01:10:53.320]   Counselors reserve the right and discretion
[01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:56.080]   to contact all appropriate entities
[01:10:56.080 --> 01:10:58.520]   when as a result of counseling,
[01:10:58.520 --> 01:11:01.200]   it is clear that a crime has been committed
[01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:02.960]   or is about to be committed
[01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:05.620]   or when the safety and welfare of any person,
[01:11:05.620 --> 01:11:08.280]   including the counselee is in jeopardy.
[01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:12.360]   The counselor is not required to notify the counselee
[01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:14.440]   in advance of any such contact
[01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:16.760]   with the appropriate authorities.
[01:11:16.760 --> 01:11:21.100]   I think that's the good balance of general confidentiality
[01:11:21.100 --> 01:11:22.980]   as well as clearly stating
[01:11:22.980 --> 01:11:25.060]   the limitations of confidentiality.
[01:11:25.060 --> 01:11:28.220]   And I think that language is pretty standard
[01:11:28.220 --> 01:11:32.860]   in the biblical counseling consent to counsel documents.
[01:11:32.860 --> 01:11:35.060]   I've given you all that information in Dropbox.
[01:11:35.060 --> 01:11:37.440]   I hope you will make use of that
[01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:39.900]   and that you will write a great essay here
[01:11:39.900 --> 01:11:44.900]   dealing with both sides of the confidentiality discussion.
[01:11:45.100 --> 01:11:47.760]   And I trust that you will be a biblical counselor
[01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:50.520]   who is known for discretion
[01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:53.280]   and for being trustworthy with information,
[01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:55.200]   but who is also wise in discerning
[01:11:55.200 --> 01:11:58.640]   and knowing the examples and the occasions
[01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:03.640]   to disclose information to a wider number of people.
[01:12:03.640 --> 01:12:07.200]   Well, I hope that was a helpful overview
[01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:10.080]   of counseling exams number 10 and 11.
[01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:14.440]   I think you will find that those two subjects go together.
[01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:16.580]   Now, as I've stated in my email previously,
[01:12:16.580 --> 01:12:19.500]   we are gonna have one last class
[01:12:19.500 --> 01:12:21.540]   dealing with the counseling exams.
[01:12:21.540 --> 01:12:24.420]   And what we are gonna do next Sunday
[01:12:24.420 --> 01:12:29.420]   is we are going to walk through the three case studies
[01:12:29.420 --> 01:12:35.460]   that are part of the counseling exam questions
[01:12:35.460 --> 01:12:37.940]   numbers 12 to 20.
[01:12:37.940 --> 01:12:40.420]   Now, there are eight questions
[01:12:40.420 --> 01:12:43.560]   that are related to three case studies.
[01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:45.460]   And what I wanna do next week
[01:12:45.460 --> 01:12:47.500]   is just walk you through the case studies,
[01:12:47.500 --> 01:12:50.740]   give you some foundations, some starter points
[01:12:50.740 --> 01:12:53.700]   to understand where to go with the case studies.
[01:12:53.700 --> 01:12:57.060]   But this will be, I think, a fitting conclusion
[01:12:57.060 --> 01:13:01.260]   to our class is to walk through
[01:13:01.260 --> 01:13:03.340]   the case studies presented to us,
[01:13:03.340 --> 01:13:05.580]   and then just give you a starting point,
[01:13:05.580 --> 01:13:09.100]   give you some foundations
[01:13:09.100 --> 01:13:13.760]   to be able to walk through those counseling examples
[01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:16.640]   together, and I trust that you will be blessed
[01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:18.640]   by our class next week.
[01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:21.200]   So join us next Sunday, May 23rd
[01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:24.080]   at five o'clock Pacific time,
[01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:26.100]   and we look forward to that time.
[01:13:26.100 --> 01:13:28.480]   So let me pray for us,
[01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:33.180]   and we'll conclude our study together.
[01:13:33.180 --> 01:13:36.280]   Father, thank you for the church.
[01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:40.140]   We just thank you for the membership of the church,
[01:13:40.140 --> 01:13:42.020]   the purity of the church.
[01:13:42.020 --> 01:13:44.660]   Thank you for the joy of knowing
[01:13:44.660 --> 01:13:47.700]   that we are not only privileged to belong to Christ,
[01:13:47.700 --> 01:13:50.920]   but to belong to his church.
[01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:54.020]   I just pray that you would bless our time
[01:13:54.020 --> 01:13:58.140]   as we study these important topics.
[01:13:58.140 --> 01:13:59.380]   Bless each student here,
[01:13:59.380 --> 01:14:01.820]   and I thank you for each one.
[01:14:01.820 --> 01:14:03.500]   Bless our studies this week, we pray,
