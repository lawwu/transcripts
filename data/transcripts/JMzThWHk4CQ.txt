[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.100]   [silence]
[00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:09.300]   Recently, I had the pleasure of hosting the one and only Ido Portal on the Huberman Lab podcast.
[00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.100]   I know many people are familiar with Ido and his work, but for those of you that might not be,
[00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:19.860]   Ido Portal is credited with being the world expert in all things movement and the person
[00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.820]   who coined the term "movement culture," which is the gathering in and around movement practices
[00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:30.820]   that span from sport to martial arts to dance, gymnastics. Ido and his colleagues have essentially
[00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:37.220]   combined all the different forms of movement that exist out there and expanded upon them to create
[00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:42.740]   patterns of movement that utilize all aspects of the nervous system and that can be incorporated
[00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:48.420]   not just into sport and dance, etc., but also into daily life. Having Ido on the podcast offered the
[00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.220]   unique opportunity to learn directly from him, and so rather than just sit in front of a couple
[00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:58.660]   of microphones, which we did, we also spent many hours doing movement practices, the first of which
[00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:05.460]   actually involved no movement. It began by lying on the floor, and Ido gave me and Odelia, one of
[00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:12.980]   his colleagues, instruction as to how to move out of a motionless state in very deliberate ways,
[00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:17.540]   as well as incorporating things like facial and eye movements, which felt very unusual, I confess,
[00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:24.180]   but quickly led to an expansion into other forms of movement that were dynamic and involved
[00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.580]   multiple people. You could call this dance or you could call this sport, but really what it
[00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:34.900]   involved is setting a small number of ground rules or constraints as to how one could or could not
[00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:41.940]   move, dictated to me by Ido, and that forced me to move in very specific ways that sometimes were
[00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:47.380]   very uncomfortable to me, not painful, but uncomfortable, meaning that they didn't necessarily
[00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.820]   bring me to a place of reflexive action. I had to think very hard, but very soon I noticed
[00:01:52.820 --> 00:02:00.420]   I was able to carry out the movements constrained by those rules in a reflexive way, which was very
[00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.220]   surprising and told me that the neural circuits for those particular movements had to have existed
[00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.900]   before that training with Ido because there's simply no way they could have wired up very
[00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:15.700]   quickly in the moment. So essentially what Ido was doing was revealing to me or allowing me to reveal
[00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:21.220]   to myself the different patterns of movement that are contained in the language of my nervous system,
[00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.340]   but that I was unaware of prior to the work with him. Then we moved on to some other sorts of
[00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:33.300]   dynamic movements involving high-level coordination of using feet and hands to stomp on tennis balls,
[00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:39.940]   bounce them up, grab them with the hand that was dictated in the moment by Ido. That was challenging
[00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:45.220]   at times, to say the least. Other patterns of movement involved an extreme amount of balance,
[00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.180]   again, my balance not being terrible, but certainly not being at a high-level skill
[00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.180]   and certainly not having done these sorts of moving practices before. I struggled quite a lot,
[00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:00.260]   but found that within each movement practice at the point of struggle, there was often a breakthrough
[00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.780]   into getting it or suddenly feeling as if my body could perform the movements, whereas a few moments
[00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:12.020]   before I couldn't. One of the more challenging drills, I guess you would call it, or practices
[00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:21.220]   that Ido put me through was one in which he would change the rules within the moments of movement
[00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:26.340]   so that one had to both be paying careful attention to the instruction and to the movement
[00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:32.740]   mid-movement and change those movements, which as a neuroscientist, I can tell you, has to involve
[00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:37.140]   a lot of what we call top-down control, that is engagement of the four brain circuits for
[00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:43.780]   anticipation and learning and rule acquisition, and to combine those with reflexive action and
[00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.340]   deliberate action. And what I discovered was that there were two things that really helped with
[00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:53.940]   that. One was to so-called clear the mind, but of course nobody knows what clearing the mind is nor
[00:03:53.940 --> 00:04:00.740]   how to do it. What this involved for me was making sure that I did not generate any movements until
[00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:07.380]   the command was delivered and then taking a pause before generating the movement that I was instructed
[00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:13.460]   to do, which at first felt slow and clunky, but clearly led to faster, more accurate execution of
[00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:20.580]   the instructed movement. And the second one was to try and forget the rule as soon as I learned it,
[00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:24.580]   because indeed the rules were changing very quickly. There were many other teachings and
[00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:30.420]   learnings throughout the day, that is Ido teaching and me attempting to learn, and by the end of the
[00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:37.380]   day, I confess I felt quite differently in my body. What do I mean by that? I became not hyper-conscious
[00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:42.580]   of every movement, but certainly far more aware of my posture and the various movements that I make,
[00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:47.700]   and I have to say that has continued not just for several days or weeks, but for several months
[00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:55.620]   after that single day of movement practice with Ido, which I find remarkable and encouraging and
[00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.100]   has led me to start to incorporate some of those same movement practices into my daily routine.
[00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:05.540]   Needless to say, it was a very special experience for me to get direct movement instruction
[00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:13.540]   from the luminary of movement, Ido Pertal, and I also couldn't help myself but to ask Ido to
[00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:21.940]   perform some movement practices for us because he is so unbelievably skilled, and he most graciously did.
[00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.180]   you
[00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:23.220]   you
[00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:23.720]   you
[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:24.760]   you
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:25.260]   you
