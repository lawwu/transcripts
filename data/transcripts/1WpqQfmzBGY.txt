[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.720]   Hello friends. I'm leaving now to go deep into the Amazon jungle with my friend, the incredible Paul Rossly.
[00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.760]   Deep to parts of the rainforest that very few humans have ever seen.
[00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:17.040]   I will try my best not to get eaten by anything.
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.960]   The purpose of this trip is to celebrate nature at its purest and most intense,
[00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.640]   and to celebrate the work of people like Paul who have dedicated their life to protecting the jungle
[00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.840]   and the endless diversity of life that call it home.
[00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.800]   If you want to support Paul and his work, please donate or reach out to Jungle Keepers.
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.720]   See the link in the description.
[00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.960]   I hope to get back in one piece and have some stories to tell,
[00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.680]   and I will also try to record a podcast with Paul when we're deep in the jungle.
[00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.440]   I'll be offline until I emerge out.
[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.080]   Meanwhile, no internet, no phone, no connection to the outside world.
[00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:02.800]   Just the raw, beautiful, immensity of nature.
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.120]   I am truly grateful to be alive.
[00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:11.480]   To have gotten the chance to live on this beautiful planet of ours with all of you,
[00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.560]   my fellow humans.
[00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.560]   I love you all.
