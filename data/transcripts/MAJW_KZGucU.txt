[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.080]   - All right, next question.
[00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.480]   We have another mom and she has a question
[00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.320]   about how to implement some of your ideas
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.000]   from a world without email.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.840]   - Hi Cal, my name's Madeline.
[00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.100]   Prior to staying at home the last five years
[00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.840]   to raise my three young kids,
[00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.120]   I received my MBA and was an internal strategic consultant
[00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.120]   for a large healthcare company.
[00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.640]   Much of the work I did was to create quarterly plans,
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.120]   identify and track key project metrics
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.240]   and develop and implement process improvement projects.
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.040]   Very in line with the recommendations
[00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.680]   you've laid out in a world without email.
[00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.000]   I first wanna thank you for creating a language
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.680]   and culture around the deep life
[00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.940]   and clarifying why this type of structure is important.
[00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.360]   Looking back at my prior role,
[00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.080]   I sometimes wavered in my confidence
[00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.920]   to hold people accountable to the systems we developed
[00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.780]   because it felt like additional work for them.
[00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.480]   My question is, after being out of the workforce,
[00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.000]   I like to re-enter and coach small businesses
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.520]   on the productivity tools I did in my previous job
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.680]   and also the theories and recommendations you've laid out.
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.720]   Do you have any thoughts on how someone
[00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.420]   can help small businesses implement your concepts?
[00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.160]   I plan to work part-time,
[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.880]   but also I would love to collaborate with other consultants
[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.580]   doing this type of work.
[00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.000]   Any recommendations would be much appreciated.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.460]   Thanks so much in advance.
[00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.480]   - Well, it's a great space.
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:26.360]   It's a great space.
[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.320]   This is my read having published "A World Without Email"
[00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.240]   is that there is an immense hunger out there
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.640]   at all levels within companies
[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.280]   to figure out better alternatives to simply,
[00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.880]   you're on email, you're on Slack,
[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.720]   let's just rock and roll and hope things get done.
[00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.000]   That hyperactive hive mind approach,
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.720]   the hyperactive hive mind approach I describe
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.880]   and dissect in detail in my book "A World Without Email"
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.940]   is not working and people recognize this,
[00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:58.860]   whether we're talking about
[00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.880]   the small business entrepreneur
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.680]   or the CIOs of major corporations,
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.480]   which in both cases I have had these conversations recently.
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.740]   So I think this is a great space to get into.
[00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.640]   I don't actually have a good process
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.000]   for helping companies develop these processes.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.160]   I kind of wish I did because I get asked to do this a lot,
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.780]   which is why I'm glad Madeline
[00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:22.920]   that you're thinking about doing this
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.000]   and that I think this is gonna be a big space
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.800]   in consulting for lots of people.
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.720]   There's gonna be a lot of room for this.
[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.360]   Typically what I tell people is I'm an idea guy.
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.240]   I come in, I study the issue, what's going on here.
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.640]   I get really deep into the issue.
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.720]   What are the actual roots of the issue?
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.360]   And then try to figure out philosophically
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.000]   what you would have to change to improve this problem,
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.900]   but I'm not in the world of business.
[00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.640]   So you don't want me to come into your business
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.700]   and start giving specific advice on how your business runs
[00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.800]   because I don't know how businesses run.
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.900]   So I don't have a good process for this,
[00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.280]   but I think there are good processes to be constructed.
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.840]   I think it's gonna be a major sector
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.680]   of the sort of knowledge work,
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.040]   management consulting world, that sector.
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.220]   I think helping companies develop processes
[00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.880]   to sidestep the hyperactive hive mind
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.160]   is gonna be a big deal.
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.680]   So Madeline, I would say probably
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.540]   you should have some sort of process you follow
[00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.040]   that you're willing to evolve very quickly
[00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.080]   as you actually try it out there in the real world.
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.920]   I would say I've learned you need to probably learn more
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.320]   about a team than you think
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.760]   before you're ready to propose things.
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.140]   There's often very, you have to surface these hidden dynamics
[00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:37.040]   that you don't really know about,
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.240]   but that are actually driving a lot
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.360]   of how work actually gets done.
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.960]   And three, I would say it's important
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:43.800]   that you eat your own dog food here.
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.880]   So make sure that you run your consulting firm
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.200]   very much aligned with these ideas,
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.940]   that it's not just, yeah, email me whenever.
[00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.140]   Just hit me up on Slack and we'll figure out the contract.
[00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.880]   You should have very clear processes that you love,
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.320]   that you can communicate clearly,
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.880]   and that clients will enjoy that clarity
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.800]   because then they will see that you're the change
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:03.780]   you wanna see in the world.
[00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.360]   They will see you do it and get a sense
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.060]   of what it's gonna look like when they do it as well.
[00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.060]   I might point you towards Ginny Blake's new book,
[00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.680]   which is a book, I believe it's called "Free Time."
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:16.900]   And it comes out in March,
[00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.460]   but I did an interview with her in December on the podcast.
[00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:21.000]   You can go back to that episode
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.380]   and learn about a lot of the ideas.
[00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:24.840]   But it's a whole book about how to do this
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.820]   with your small consulting style business,
[00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.660]   how to figure out your processes,
[00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.540]   what to focus on, what not to focus on.
[00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.740]   So read that book, it'll help you with what you're doing,
[00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:35.920]   and it might give you ideas
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:39.880]   on how you can help other companies do the same thing.
[00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.980]   All right, but that's good to hear.
[00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:46.260]   I do, I mean, Jesse, I think this is gonna be a huge sector.
[00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:48.060]   Doing this type of consulting,
[00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.900]   I mean, it makes my eyes bleed thinking about me doing it.
[00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.420]   I mean, could you imagine something worse than me,
[00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:59.260]   just individually me being in like a corporate board room
[00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.940]   and having these sort of jargon-filled small talks
[00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.180]   about how their team, their Q2 quarterly metrics.
[00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.220]   And like, I'd be terrible at it
[00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.140]   because after like half hour,
[00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.460]   I'd be like, "You guys should all just go write books.
[00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:13.300]   "This is crazy, what are you doing here?
[00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:14.460]   "This is a terrible job."
[00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.660]   So I would be terrible at it,
[00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:17.940]   but other people would be great at it,
[00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:19.860]   and it's gonna make a lot of people's lives better
[00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.020]   if their companies actually get rid of this hive mind.
[00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.100]   Just don't ask me to do it.
[00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.680]   (upbeat music)
[00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.040]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
