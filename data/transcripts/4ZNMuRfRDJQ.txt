[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.880]   [intro music]
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:10.380]   The new year means, as is our new tradition here on the podcast, it is time to go over
[00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.320]   my reading list.
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:18.080]   So as long-time listeners know, my target is usually to read about five books per month,
[00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.160]   and we've started the habit of at the beginning of each new month reviewing the books I read
[00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.160]   during the past month.
[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:32.320]   So now it is time to talk about the five books I read in December 2021.
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.320]   Are you ready for this, Jesse?
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.320]   I'm ready.
[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.320]   Let's go.
[00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.320]   All right.
[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:45.200]   So the first book I completed in that month was How Star Wars Conquered the Universe by
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.300]   Chris Taylor.
[00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:53.960]   This is basically a George Lucas biography that has some pop culture reporting on the
[00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:54.960]   Star Wars phenomenon.
[00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.600]   Now, you might remember this, Jesse.
[00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.720]   This was controversial.
[00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.960]   We talked about this back in December when I was reading it.
[00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:09.640]   I asked the listeners, "Is it okay that I am skipping the chapters that are about the
[00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.360]   cultural reception of Star Wars?"
[00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.600]   So early on, the book started going back and forth.
[00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.120]   It would be a chapter from the timeline of George Lucas's career, so biography.
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.960]   And then it would switch to a chapter that would be about, "Here's a group of guys that
[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.880]   dress up like stormtroopers and who they are and what's that like."
[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.880]   I was not so interested in the cultural stuff.
[00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:31.880]   I wanted the biography.
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.720]   This is part of my ongoing effort to—my movie effort.
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.840]   I'm reading book after book about various people in the movie industry for some weird
[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:39.840]   reason.
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.400]   So I asked the audience if it was okay if I skipped that.
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.480]   Jesse, you gave me the thumbs up on that, I believe, if I'm remembering.
[00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:46.480]   Yeah, that was okay.
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:47.480]   That was okay.
[00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.680]   Well, so here's the thing.
[00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.280]   I have more defense for my approach because he stopped—the author, Chris Taylor, stopped
[00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.480]   doing that switching before, I don't know, two-thirds of the way into the book.
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.040]   And so it became straight biography, really, for the end of it.
[00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.680]   So in the end, I probably only skipped, I don't know, 30% of the material.
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.000]   So I'm going to count that.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   So as I mentioned, this is part of my random project to really dive into the film industry.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.720]   This is maybe the fourth or fifth book I've read in a row that is on that topic.
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.840]   I'm not sure why this is interesting so much, but it really has been this fall.
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.960]   I really wanted to learn about George Lucas, having finished the biography of Steven Spielberg
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.960]   the month before.
[00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.760]   And a few things I learned.
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.920]   One, Lucas was a really good director.
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.280]   So in this scene, there's this scene centered around USC where there was Lucas and there
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.760]   was Coppola, and Spielberg wasn't at USC, but he was in their circle.
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.720]   Scorsese was in their circle, among some others.
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.440]   Brian De Palma was in their circle.
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.800]   So it's this big group of directors, and they all knew each other.
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.400]   In that circle, Lucas was considered a hotshot.
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.760]   So he had this great animated student short that won a bunch of awards and put him on
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:09.760]   the map.
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.560]   Like, wow, Lucas is the guy that he's the auteur.
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.080]   He's the guy with the vision.
[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.360]   And then he did the student version of THX, which also blew people away.
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.160]   So I think people didn't realize that about Lucas.
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:26.040]   Coppola really was trying to get Lucas to direct Apocalypse Now.
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.120]   But Lucas decided to do Star Wars instead, basically.
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.920]   So he was considered like the artistic guy.
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.560]   So that's kind of interesting.
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.240]   The other thing I found out about Lucas is, like these other guys, timing is important.
[00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:45.140]   Him and Spielberg came up just as the movie industry was changing, just as they were leaving
[00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.640]   the studio system.
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:53.160]   So Coppola's first movie was Finnegan's Rainbow, which was a classic studio soundstage movie.
[00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.400]   Then he did The Godfather.
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.880]   So it was like right as they were transitioning away from the studio system.
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.320]   And they invented this idea of the blockbuster, where you could have a movie that appealed
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.440]   to all these different age groups and could be in 3,000 theaters and make all this money.
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.120]   And so their timing was right.
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.160]   They were talented.
[00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:19.520]   And Lucas, even more so than Spielberg, had a relentless go-big ambition.
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:23.560]   So if he was going to do a movie, just like a student movie, he was going to do THX student
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:29.560]   movie, he was going to find a way to get access to an abandoned military base and push the
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.440]   setting, push the technology.
[00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.520]   He was going to make a movie where you're going to say, "Wow, this is a lot bigger than
[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.240]   I thought someone with that budget could do."
[00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.320]   And that was the approach that made Star Wars big.
[00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.920]   He was like, "We're going to invent new technology for the special effects.
[00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.960]   It's going to be bigger than anyone's ever seen."
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.000]   Clearly James Cameron picked up that torch from Lucas after the fact.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.520]   So anyways, that's what I learned about Lucas, is this guy was incredibly talented, incredibly
[00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.520]   ambitious.
[00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.200]   He was going to do everything bigger than anyone had ever done it before, and really,
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.200]   really focused.
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.200]   Also, very rich.
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.200]   I don't know if you know that.
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.200]   Yeah, he's like a billionaire, isn't he?
[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.200]   Yeah, he's a billionaire.
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.200]   Were you a Star Wars guy, Jesse?
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.200]   I've seen some of the movies, not all of them.
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.200]   Probably not as much as you are.
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:11.200]   Is Lucas and Spielberg friends?
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:12.200]   Yeah, yeah, they were friends.
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:13.200]   They all knew each other.
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.200]   And they were going back and forth.
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.200]   It's hard to overestimate how much money they were making.
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.200]   And I think that's what made Star Wars so popular.
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:17.200]   I think that's what made it so popular.
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.200]   I think that's what made it so popular.
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:19.200]   I think that's what made it so popular.

[00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:23.080]   - Well, somewhere there, hopefully you'd have a writing shed
[00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:25.080]   so that wouldn't get burned down,
[00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:27.080]   so you could just escape to there.
[00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:29.080]   - Yeah. Well, that is my dream, is I want a writing shed,
[00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:31.080]   and I don't have room for a writing shed.
[00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:33.080]   and I don't have room for a writing shed.
[00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:35.080]   It is a dream of mine, so I need...
[00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:37.080]   I was having this conversation.
[00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:39.080]   For real, I was having this conversation
[00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:41.080]   with two different people in the last month,
[00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:43.080]   writers, who have a getaway plot.
[00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:45.080]   writers, who have a getaway plot.
[00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:47.080]   It's kind of an interesting model.
[00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:49.080]   A place they go...
[00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:51.080]   It's not like a large cultivated land,
[00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:53.080]   and it's not nice, it's quiet.
[00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:55.080]   and it's not nice, it's quiet.
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:57.080]   And they have a place to write.
[00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:59.080]   So I have a writer I was talking to who lives
[00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:01.080]   right outside New York City in a town that's kind of like Tacoma Park,
[00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:03.080]   and about 90 minutes up 87,
[00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:05.080]   he has some land,
[00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:07.080]   I guess that'd be like the southern Cascades.
[00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:09.080]   There's a little writing shed.
[00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:11.080]   And then another guy,
[00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:13.080]   a good friend of mine,
[00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:15.080]   was telling me,
[00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:17.080]   he lives in Chicago, in the city in a row house,
[00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:19.080]   and they just bought a plot
[00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:21.080]   that is
[00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:23.080]   four or five acres,
[00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:25.080]   near one of the... I don't know what the Great Lake is,
[00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:27.080]   near there, but whatever that is, Lake Michigan.
[00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:29.080]   It's not on the water, it's one lot in
[00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:31.080]   from the water. And it has like an old barn,
[00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:33.080]   and they're planting an orchard on it,
[00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:35.080]   and they can get there in 90 minutes as well.
[00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:37.080]   And he's building, he was showing me these plans,
[00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:39.080]   like a fireman
[00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:41.080]   forest fire watch tower.
[00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:43.080]   You know, like you would build,
[00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:45.080]   they used to build to look for forest fires,
[00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:47.080]   and at the top of this tower,
[00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:49.080]   so it's like an elevated gazebo.
[00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:51.080]   And that's where he's going to do his deep work,
[00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:53.080]   because you can see the lake.
[00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:55.080]   How does he get up there? Does he take an elevator?
[00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:57.080]   It could be a ladder.
[00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:59.080]   It's like icy up there.
[00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:01.080]   Well, you know, a little bit of danger gets the heart going.
[00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:03.080]   So I'm excited about that. So I don't know,
[00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:05.080]   maybe this is, I like this notion of having a getaway
[00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:07.080]   plot, that it's not super
[00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:09.080]   hard to maintain, you don't need like a really big house,
[00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:11.080]   but the key to a getaway plot
[00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:13.080]   is, I think it has to be
[00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:15.080]   non-trivially
[00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:17.080]   sub two hours away.
[00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:19.080]   If it's two hours or more,
[00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:21.080]   you can't go and write for a day
[00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:23.080]   and come back.
[00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:25.080]   Yeah, I see that. Two quick points.
[00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:27.080]   I, there's
[00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:29.080]   no doubt in my mind that you'll find something like that.
[00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:31.080]   I've been listening to your stuff for a long time, and I
[00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:33.080]   think you'll find it eventually, because you talk
[00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:35.080]   about it a lot. And then,
[00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:37.080]   secondly, in terms of self-help books,
[00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:39.080]   I was listening
[00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:41.080]   to Ferris' podcast recently, and
[00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:43.080]   he quoted you on giving him a
[00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:45.080]   suggestion for the self-help book
[00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:47.080]   that he read when he wasn't even
[00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:49.080]   going to read new books. So that was kind
[00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:51.080]   of cool. I just listened to that recently. Yeah,
[00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:53.080]   that's a good book. So it's Oliver Berkman's
[00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:55.080]   book, "4,000 Weeks."
[00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:57.080]   I talked about it, I
[00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:59.080]   told Tim about it, and then Tim
[00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:01.080]   read it, and then Tim did the thing that I
[00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:03.080]   think every publisher
[00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:05.080]   wishes would happen.
[00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:07.080]   I said, "Tim, I believe he,
[00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:09.080]   you listen to this, he released the first
[00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:11.080]   chapter, the audiobook
[00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:13.080]   version of the first chapter of Oliver's book
[00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:15.080]   on his podcast. Is that right?
[00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:17.080]   Yeah, I just listened to it, actually.
[00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:19.080]   Man, could you imagine having the first chapter
[00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:21.080]   of your audiobook on Ferris'
[00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:23.080]   podcast? So "4,000
[00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:25.080]   Weeks" is a cool book.
[00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:27.080]   I read it a long time ago, because I blurbed it.
[00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:29.080]   I read it back before it came
[00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:31.080]   out. And it's
[00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:33.080]   a great concept. It's called "Time Management for
[00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:35.080]   Mortals," and 4,000 weeks
[00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:37.080]   is roughly how many weeks you live.
[00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:39.080]   Oliver's whole point is
[00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:41.080]   most things you're not going to get done, you have a very
[00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:43.080]   limited amount of time.
[00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:45.080]   All these wild dreams you have, most of them won't happen.
[00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:47.080]   And be okay
[00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:49.080]   with that. And spend
[00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:51.080]   more time enjoying
[00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:53.080]   what you do have and what you can do,
[00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:55.080]   and don't be so aggressively goal-oriented.
[00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:57.080]   It was that book hit a nerve
[00:19:57.080 --> 00:19:59.080]   well before Ferris mentioned it.
[00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:01.080]   That thing was, yeah, that thing crushed it.
[00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:03.080]   I think it's one of the
[00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:05.080]   better-selling in our world of the people
[00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:07.080]   we know that write the sort of
[00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:09.080]   New Yorker-style self-help.
[00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:11.080]   He's a Guardian guy. He's a very smart guy.
[00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:13.080]   I think that book is the one that really crushed it this year.
[00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:15.080]   I'm very happy
[00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:17.080]   for Oliver. I've always loved his stuff, and he's been very
[00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:19.080]   kind to my stuff. So, circle
[00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:21.080]   goes around. All right, one more book.
[00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:23.080]   I finally read
[00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:25.080]   some Wendell Berry.
[00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:27.080]   So I don't know, do you know any...
[00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:29.080]   He's not as well-known as I thought.
[00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:31.080]   Have you heard of Wendell Berry?
[00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:33.080]   No. Cool guy.
[00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:35.080]   He's old now. He's in his 80s.
[00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:37.080]   But he went... grew up in Kentucky
[00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:39.080]   on a small farm.
[00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:41.080]   Went to New York City.
[00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:43.080]   Got educated. I don't know, Columbia
[00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:45.080]   or NYU or something. Got sort of overly educated.
[00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:47.080]   Got a writing job in New York City. He wanted
[00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:49.080]   to be a writer, and he was going to do the whole
[00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:51.080]   modern
[00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:53.080]   cosmopolitan writer thing,
[00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:55.080]   where you live in a city.
[00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:57.080]   You're not from somewhere. You're just
[00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:59.080]   observing things around
[00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:01.080]   the world. And
[00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:03.080]   for whatever reason, he's like, "I don't like this.
[00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:05.080]   I'm from Kentucky.
[00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:07.080]   I want to go back to Kentucky.
[00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:09.080]   I want Kentucky to be my muse.
[00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:11.080]   I want to be from a place and write about the place.
[00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:13.080]   I don't want to be just this
[00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:15.080]   abstraction writer that just
[00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:17.080]   is commenting on the world from a cosmopolitan
[00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:19.080]   detached place. I want to go back."
[00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:21.080]   So he moves back to Kentucky,
[00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:23.080]   gets a professorship at a small
[00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:25.080]   Kentucky college near
[00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:27.080]   where he grew up. Him and his wife
[00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:29.080]   buy... I think it's 12
[00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:31.080]   acres. Like a hobby farm.
[00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:33.080]   He grew up farming, but this
[00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:35.080]   is not a production farm. He's like, "We're going to live on
[00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:37.080]   12 acres. I'm going to be a professor, and I'm
[00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:39.080]   going to write about Kentucky."
[00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:41.080]   And then another plot became
[00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:43.080]   available. "We should probably buy that."
[00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:45.080]   And then another plot became available after that. "We should probably
[00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:47.080]   buy that." And he ends up with
[00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:49.080]   a real production farm, 100-plus
[00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:51.080]   acre farm. And
[00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:53.080]   this is why he's awesome.
[00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:55.080]   He's like, "I'm not into this whole
[00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:57.080]   gasoline thing.
[00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:59.080]   I'm going to farm the way I learned to farm,
[00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:01.080]   which is teams of horses."
[00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:03.080]   And he still... I mean, he doesn't
[00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:05.080]   farm. He's 80 now. But all throughout
[00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:07.080]   his career, he never went
[00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:09.080]   to tractors. He farmed with horses.
[00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:11.080]   This guy's awesome. So he leaves
[00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:13.080]   New York to farm with
[00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:15.080]   horses this farm
[00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:17.080]   in Kentucky,
[00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:19.080]   rural Kentucky, and
[00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:21.080]   is a novelist
[00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:23.080]   poet, but mainly an essayist.
[00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:25.080]   And he writes essays. He
[00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:27.080]   writes a series of essays,
[00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:29.080]   Bill McKibben-style
[00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:31.080]   essays about the economy and the environment,
[00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:33.080]   and a very influential writer.
[00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:35.080]   And writes it from
[00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:37.080]   this farm where he doesn't own a computer
[00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:39.080]   and you can't read. If you want to talk to him, you have
[00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:41.080]   to call the farmhouse and come out
[00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:43.080]   to the farm. He's an awesome guy.
[00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:45.080]   And they just released the first
[00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:47.080]   definitive
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:49.080]   essay collection where they
[00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:51.080]   pulled together. It's called "The World Ending Fire."
[00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:53.080]   This came out in 2019. If you get
[00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:55.080]   it, you'll love it. And I think Nick Offerman,
[00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:57.080]   who I also love from Parks and Recreation,
[00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:59.080]   Ron Swanson, who by the way is a guy
[00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:01.080]   who lives in LA, is a working actor,
[00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:03.080]   but also has a giant woodworking
[00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:05.080]   wood shop in a light industrial
[00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:07.080]   warehouse in LA. And he spends a lot
[00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:09.080]   of time building canoes.
[00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:11.080]   Like Ron Swanson, he does the
[00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:13.080]   intro or the prologue. So on the audio book,
[00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:15.080]   Nick Offerman reads it. Anyways,
[00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:17.080]   so I read my first collection,
[00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:19.080]   full collection of Wendell Berry essays.
[00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:21.080]   Are you going to take a field trip out there and check it out?
[00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:23.080]   I should, man. This guy's awesome. He has an essay
[00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:25.080]   in there that I might write an
[00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:27.080]   essay about for my newsletter
[00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:29.080]   that's called "Why I Didn't Buy a Computer,"
[00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:31.080]   which is cool. And I think this was the
[00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:33.080]   '80s when he wrote this essay.
[00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:35.080]   And he's like, "Look, here's my rules for
[00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:37.080]   technology." And it's very much
[00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:39.080]   like I wrote about in Deep Work,
[00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:41.080]   where I go and I talk to a farmer, Forrest Pritchard,
[00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:43.080]   and say, "Farmers care.
[00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:45.080]   Farmers have
[00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:47.080]   pretty strict criteria
[00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:49.080]   for when they're going to spend money
[00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:51.080]   on a new tool, otherwise they'll go bankrupt.
[00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:53.080]   And we should have that same strict criteria when thinking about
[00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:55.080]   technology. We shouldn't just say, "I don't know.
[00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:57.080]   I heard
[00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:59.080]   about TikTok. I should probably use it."
[00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:01.080]   We should have a farmer's mindset. That was my point in
[00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:03.080]   Deep Work. It'd be like, "What's the value? What's the cost?
[00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:05.080]   Is there better ways to get that value?"
[00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:07.080]   Wendell Berry wrote this essay
[00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:09.080]   about this in the '80s. I didn't know about this. He gave
[00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:11.080]   this whole list of, "Here's how I decide whether
[00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:13.080]   or not to use a new technology, and
[00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:15.080]   the computer doesn't
[00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:17.080]   pass that test."
[00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:19.080]   He published it in Harper's.
[00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:21.080]   But what's cool about it is he got
[00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:23.080]   in trouble.
[00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:25.080]   The whole thing is in the essay collection.
[00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:27.080]   He wrote this essay.
[00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:29.080]   He's like, "I don't need a computer.
[00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:31.080]   See if you can see the part
[00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:33.080]   here we got in trouble." He's like, "Yeah.
[00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:35.080]   I write my things longhand, and my
[00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:37.080]   wife types them up, and
[00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:39.080]   we're good."
[00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:41.080]   That got him in a lot of trouble. In the essay
[00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:43.080]   collection,
[00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:45.080]   Harper's published a lot of these letters,
[00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:47.080]   and they published the letters in the essay collection.
[00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:49.080]   Then a lot of people got mad about that.
[00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:51.080]   They say, "Oh, well, you have a great technology
[00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:53.080]   called Wife, and that's how you actually blah, blah,
[00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:55.080]   blah." Then he wrote
[00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:57.080]   an essay in response.
[00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:59.080]   This is like analog
[00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:01.080]   Twitter. You're like Twitter, but if
[00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:03.080]   Twitter was in Harper's magazine, and there was
[00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:05.080]   a week between every ...
[00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:07.080]   He writes this thing in response, and he's
[00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:09.080]   like, "Basically, screw you. You don't know our
[00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:11.080]   family. You don't know how
[00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:13.080]   our marriage works, or this or that." He goes on this
[00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:15.080]   big, long, whatever.
[00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:17.080]   He's like, "Why are you all so defensive?
[00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:19.080]   I must have touched a nerve saying
[00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:21.080]   I don't need a computer, and you're all so mad at me.
[00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:23.080]   You're all techno-determinists, apologists."
[00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:25.080]   It's really interesting, this heated
[00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:27.080]   back and forth.
[00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:29.080]   This was kind of interesting. He introduces
[00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:31.080]   this
[00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:33.080]   very grounded in farming
[00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:35.080]   idea
[00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:37.080]   of home economics, which
[00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:39.080]   is quite different than what
[00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:41.080]   you would see in suburban D.C., where
[00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:43.080]   it's all
[00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:45.080]   salary, job,
[00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:47.080]   dual-income government families. He's like, "We
[00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:49.080]   have a
[00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:51.080]   home economy." It's a very farmer
[00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:53.080]   way of thinking about it, and that
[00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:55.080]   we all are ... Everyone
[00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:57.080]   in the family, me and my wife, we're all part of.
[00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:59.080]   We have this farm we run, and there's all these different
[00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:01.080]   things that have to happen, and this fence has to
[00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:03.080]   get repaired, and the milking has to happen,
[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:05.080]   and the horses have to be fed. I don't know how
[00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:07.080]   it works. We're all just working on everything
[00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:09.080]   as part of keeping this
[00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:11.080]   very incorporated, this household economy
[00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:13.080]   functioning, which is a very
[00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:15.080]   pre ... When you're not thinking about salaried
[00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:17.080]   work, but I'm producing from land,
[00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:19.080]   it's the way you think. It's like we
[00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:21.080]   have endless things that have to happen that we're all
[00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:23.080]   working on and trying to keep collectively
[00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:25.080]   our farm running.
[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:27.080]   He thought of his article writing,
[00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:29.080]   he just placed it in that same context. He's
[00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:31.080]   like, "Yeah, these articles that go
[00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:33.080]   out as part of what keeps the household economy
[00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:35.080]   running, we're all just part of it. I do
[00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:37.080]   some writing, she does some editing, we do some
[00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:39.080]   whatever. It's just like I
[00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:41.080]   put the staves on the fence,
[00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:43.080]   and you whitewash them." It was really interesting
[00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:45.080]   to see this
[00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:47.080]   clash that was happening. It's like
[00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:49.080]   a culture clash. He was coming
[00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:51.080]   from a world where
[00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:53.080]   you
[00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:55.080]   owned land, and
[00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:57.080]   that was your source of income. It was very ...
[00:26:57.080 --> 00:26:59.080]   You're a ...
[00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:01.080]   I don't know what the right term is, but like yeoman farmer
[00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:03.080]   type thing. I'm
[00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:05.080]   trying to make a living off of ... Our family's
[00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:07.080]   trying to make a living off of our land. We all work together
[00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:09.080]   to try to do it. He was coming from that mindset, but
[00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:11.080]   in the '80s, everything was shifting
[00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:13.080]   towards most people weren't on farms.
[00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:15.080]   Most people weren't running their own
[00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:17.080]   small businesses in town, where just the whole family
[00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:19.080]   works at it, the donut shop to keep it
[00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:21.080]   running. It was salaries,
[00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:23.080]   and it was typically dual income salaries.
[00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:25.080]   This whole discussion about work
[00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:27.080]   and meaning and
[00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:29.080]   who's working and not working,
[00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:31.080]   all of that was just beginning, and
[00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:33.080]   this "Why don't buy a
[00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:35.080]   computer?" came out, boom, right as that
[00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:37.080]   was happening. You could see in that frision
[00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:39.080]   this
[00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:41.080]   is when this huge cultural
[00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:43.080]   shift was happening. That was a cool
[00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:45.080]   part of the book, is in this essays and the letters
[00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:47.080]   and the back and forth, you can see these
[00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:49.080]   worlds colliding.
[00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:51.080]   In the collision, you actually got
[00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:53.080]   more insight than what any individual
[00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:55.080]   essay or letter was saying about.
[00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:57.080]   It was a very dialectical thing. It was really cool.
[00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:59.080]   In the collision of Barry with
[00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:01.080]   these letter writers in the '80s, you got more
[00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:03.080]   insight into the changing
[00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:05.080]   culture than you got
[00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:07.080]   from just reading any one individual
[00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:09.080]   essay about that period. I just wanted
[00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:11.080]   to point that out. It was a pretty cool part of the book.
[00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:13.080]   You should send him a letter, because
[00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:15.080]   earlier you were talking about how your friend saw you
[00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:17.080]   mention on Twitter, but this way you
[00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:19.080]   only get in touch with him if you send him
[00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:21.080]   a letter. That's literally how you get in touch with him,
[00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:23.080]   by the way. I know. You should do it.
[00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:25.080]   That's how reporters do it. That's how this essay book
[00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:27.080]   came together. You have to send him
[00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:29.080]   a letter, and then he may answer.
[00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:31.080]   He's very old now.
[00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:33.080]   Probably doesn't get much mail.
[00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:35.080]   Yeah. I wonder what that's like.
[00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:37.080]   If you only do letters... He probably liked getting mail.
[00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:39.080]   But it's the Internet age. Does he get a lot
[00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:41.080]   of... I'm sure he gets a lot of
[00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:43.080]   stuff from publicists,
[00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:45.080]   like books,
[00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:47.080]   where you blurb this, that type of stuff.
[00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:51.080]   Anyways, Barry's a cool guy.
[00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:53.080]   I'm going to read some more Barry.
[00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:55.080]   That's what I read in
[00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:57.080]   December 2021.
[00:28:57.080 --> 00:28:59.080]   I'm deep into working on January
[00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:01.080]   2022 books, and we will check in
[00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:03.080]   at the end of this month with how
[00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:05.080]   my current reading
[00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:07.080]   is going. With that,
[00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:09.080]   why don't we go answer some listener
[00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:11.080]   questions. We'll start, as always, with some
[00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:13.080]   questions about deep
[00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:15.080]   work. We did
[00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:17.080]   a pretty long opening segment, so I am going
[00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:19.080]   to be pithy.
[00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:21.080]   Of course, I've said that before. We'll see if that actually works
[00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:23.080]   out. Our first question
[00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:25.080]   comes from Clarissa.
[00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:27.080]   Clarissa says,
[00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:29.080]   "I'm writing my dissertation, and
[00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:31.080]   I am struggling.
[00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:33.080]   As a clinician by trait, I struggle
[00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:35.080]   with this phase of my PhD program. I'm somewhat
[00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:37.080]   traumatized by my advisor who
[00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:39.080]   criticized my ability to write two years ago.
[00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:41.080]   I always received excellent grades during course
[00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:43.080]   work, but now in dissertation phase, she is beginning
[00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:45.080]   to compliment me, but I'm still insecure.
[00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:47.080]   I've hired an editor and a
[00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:49.080]   communication coach. I buy
[00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:51.080]   all the books on how to write a dissertation, but I
[00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:53.080]   still struggle with the writing
[00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:55.080]   process."
[00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:57.080]   Well, Clarissa, what I'm going to do first
[00:29:57.080 --> 00:29:59.080]   is de-emphasize
[00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:01.080]   the writing aspect
[00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:03.080]   of you putting together your dissertation.
[00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:05.080]   This is
[00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:07.080]   a
[00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:09.080]   complaint I've often had about the rhetoric
[00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:11.080]   around dissertations that I used
[00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:13.080]   to voice a lot when I was early in
[00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:15.080]   my professor career because
[00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:17.080]   I had a background in productivity
[00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:19.080]   advice. I was asked to come
[00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:21.080]   to a lot of what are known as dissertation
[00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:23.080]   boot camps, where you
[00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:25.080]   get together a bunch of grad students at a school
[00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:27.080]   who are working on their dissertations, and they all work
[00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:29.080]   together to try to get progress, and
[00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:31.080]   they bring in speakers. I spoke at a lot of these, and this was
[00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:33.080]   the point I often made. Stop
[00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:35.080]   making writing
[00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:37.080]   the only verb you use to describe
[00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:39.080]   working on a dissertation.
[00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:41.080]   Stop making the whole focus on, "Did I
[00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:43.080]   get my pages in? How often am I writing?
[00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:45.080]   How many hours of writing am I doing?"
[00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:47.080]   Because when it comes to academic work
[00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:49.080]   of this type, 80%
[00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:51.080]   of the effort is thinking,
[00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:53.080]   figuring out
[00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:55.080]   what you want to say and making it something worth
[00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:57.080]   saying. Now, what this
[00:30:57.080 --> 00:30:59.080]   actually means depends on the field.
[00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:01.080]   If you're in a more
[00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:03.080]   humanities-based field,
[00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:05.080]   you're doing philosophy or something, this
[00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:07.080]   really might be the framework you're trying to put
[00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:09.080]   together. If this is more of a clinical
[00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:11.080]   research-based dissertation, which sounds like
[00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:13.080]   might be your case, figuring out what to say
[00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:15.080]   is actually doing experiments,
[00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:17.080]   looking at what you discovered, coming up with better
[00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:19.080]   experiments, understanding the literature, figuring
[00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:21.080]   out the thing you want to say is
[00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:23.080]   80% of the work and where almost all of the value
[00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:25.080]   comes from. 20%
[00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:27.080]   is just getting that down in a way that people can understand.
[00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:29.080]   The writing
[00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:31.080]   is a small part. I'm
[00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:33.080]   saying that, Clarissa, because I want you to feel better.
[00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:35.080]   You are not trying to
[00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:37.080]   get a
[00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:39.080]   Pulitzer for
[00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:41.080]   a book of
[00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:43.080]   fiction you're writing. You are
[00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:45.080]   not trying to pitch to New York
[00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:47.080]   or to do some
[00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:49.080]   long-form piece where what's really going to matter
[00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:51.080]   is the craft and the
[00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:53.080]   poetry of your writing. No, what you're trying to do
[00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:55.080]   is take lots of deep thinking
[00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:57.080]   on something that's new and important and just express
[00:31:57.080 --> 00:31:59.080]   it in a way that people can understand. You need to
[00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:01.080]   be clear and you need to be grammatically correct.
[00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:03.080]   You need your writing to not get in the way
[00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:05.080]   of what you're really trying to do, which is deliver
[00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:07.080]   the idea. So clear writing,
[00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:09.080]   well-constructed,
[00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:11.080]   simple sentences, good
[00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:13.080]   grammar, great.
[00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:15.080]   Everything else goes into actually figuring
[00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:17.080]   out what you want to say. So, look, you hired an editor,
[00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:19.080]   that's fine. They can help you with the clarity.
[00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:21.080]   And that's all you need to worry about.
[00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:23.080]   Have them look at a couple chapters and they can
[00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:25.080]   "Hey, you're using word repetition
[00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:27.080]   and be careful with your commas. Great."
[00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:29.080]   They'll help you with that. Your
[00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:31.080]   writing will be clear. That problem
[00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:33.080]   is solved, and I don't want you to worry about that anymore.
[00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:35.080]   Again, you're not
[00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:37.080]   Joan Didion. You're not thinking
[00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:39.080]   "Can I create poetry with my
[00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:41.080]   sentence rhythm?" So don't worry
[00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:43.080]   so much about the writing.
[00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:45.080]   On the other hand, be very systematic
[00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:47.080]   when you think about
[00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:49.080]   "What do I want to write about?"
[00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:51.080]   Experiments, reading
[00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:53.080]   the literature, working over what
[00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:55.080]   you want to say, checking that with people. "Does
[00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:57.080]   this make sense? Do you buy this argument?" Let me just give
[00:32:57.080 --> 00:32:59.080]   you this argument in words. Just do you buy this
[00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:01.080]   argument? Workshopping your ideas.
[00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:03.080]   Be much more relentless on thinking
[00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:05.080]   about what you're going to say. And once that's right, again,
[00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:07.080]   the writing, when it comes to dissertation,
[00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:09.080]   is just "Can I
[00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:11.080]   get this information from my
[00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:13.080]   head to your head without roadblocks wrong
[00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:15.080]   the way?" And Clarissa, I think you already
[00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:17.080]   can do that. And the editor will give you a little
[00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:19.080]   bit of extra confidence, but
[00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:21.080]   you're there with that.
[00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:23.080]   All right, let's move on to a question
[00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:25.080]   from
[00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:27.080]   Kavindra, who says
[00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:29.080]   "Cal, I have been
[00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:31.080]   implementing ideas from
[00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:33.080]   digital minimalism in a world without
[00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:35.080]   email, and I have found that my work
[00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:37.080]   day has so much extra time in it.
[00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:39.080]   Aside,
[00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:41.080]   everyone finds this
[00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:43.080]   when they actually begin
[00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:45.080]   being much more intentional about
[00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:47.080]   their time allocation, when they become much more intentional
[00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:49.080]   about the processes by which they collaborate,
[00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:51.080]   they realize that I only need
[00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:53.080]   this much hours to get my work done.
[00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:55.080]   It's a little bit of a secret." All right,
[00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:57.080]   going back to the question,
[00:33:57.080 --> 00:33:59.080]   "I only need less than three-fourths of my work hours
[00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:01.080]   to be completely on top of my duties.
[00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:03.080]   Now that I have this time,
[00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:05.080]   I am realizing that
[00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:07.080]   there is much in my not
[00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:09.080]   work buckets that I can tackle.
[00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:11.080]   However, I do not want to mix non-work
[00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:13.080]   things with being at the office for my own mental clarity.
[00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:15.080]   I also don't want to look
[00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:17.080]   like a slacker.
[00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:19.080]   Do you have examples of how people
[00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:21.080]   handle this in between time?"
[00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:23.080]   So, Kavindra, my
[00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:25.080]   standard suggestion here is
[00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:27.080]   that you should take a
[00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:29.080]   phantom part-time job.
[00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:31.080]   So this is my terminology
[00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:33.080]   for the very common
[00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:35.080]   occurrence among my listeners and readers
[00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:37.080]   where they get very intentional about their time,
[00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:39.080]   realize that
[00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:41.080]   end processes, time and processes, realize they have
[00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:43.080]   a lot of extra time in their day. They can stay on top
[00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:45.080]   of their job with a lot of extra time, which again
[00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:47.080]   is not surprising because most people are
[00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:49.080]   terrible
[00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:51.080]   at the mechanics of what they
[00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:53.080]   do for a living. So when you're not terrible,
[00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:55.080]   you realize you don't need
[00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:57.080]   as much time. And what I recommend
[00:34:57.080 --> 00:34:59.080]   is this idea of you really treat it like
[00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:01.080]   I have a part-time job
[00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:03.080]   and that's what I do in that extra one-fourth,
[00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:05.080]   in your case, one-fourth of my time that's
[00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:07.080]   free. And you schedule
[00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:09.080]   your work for this phantom part-time job
[00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:11.080]   just like you're scheduling your work for your main job
[00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:13.080]   and it happens during the workday and you
[00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:15.080]   can decide if you want to, let's say,
[00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:17.080]   end your workday implicitly
[00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:19.080]   at 3 and then switch to your phantom part-time
[00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:21.080]   job or interleave your phantom part-time
[00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:23.080]   job during the day or like
[00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:25.080]   a lot of people will do their phantom part-time job
[00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:27.080]   first thing in the morning, then switch over
[00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:29.080]   to their other job because there's lots of meetings
[00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:31.080]   and stuff that happen more in the afternoon
[00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:33.080]   the morning, however you want to do it, but you really treat it
[00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:35.080]   systematically like I have two jobs.
[00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:37.080]   You call the second one a phantom
[00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:39.080]   part-time job because you don't make it visible
[00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:41.080]   and you don't talk about it.
[00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:43.080]   Now, what do you do with your phantom part-time
[00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:45.080]   job? You have three options.
[00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:47.080]   One, you use it
[00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:49.080]   to move to the next level
[00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:51.080]   or open up new opportunities in your
[00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:53.080]   existing work.
[00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:55.080]   So you could be dedicating this time to
[00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:57.080]   let's say cultivating a new
[00:35:57.080 --> 00:35:59.080]   rare and valuable skill that's going to give you a lot
[00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:01.080]   more options or
[00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:03.080]   control or autonomy once you do it.
[00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:05.080]   Two, it could be a side hustle.
[00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:07.080]   I am starting, I want to
[00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:09.080]   write a novel. I'm starting a business on the
[00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:11.080]   side. I'm starting a podcast
[00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:13.080]   or whatever it is. So you're working on a side
[00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:15.080]   hustle that may
[00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:17.080]   just be for interest or it may be that you wanted
[00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:19.080]   to eventually generate enough income
[00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:21.080]   that you can renegotiate your main work situation
[00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:23.080]   to be maybe part-time itself
[00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:25.080]   or three, your phantom
[00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:27.080]   part-time job is a
[00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:29.080]   completely non-professional personal
[00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:31.080]   interest.
[00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:33.080]   I want to master
[00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:35.080]   you know, coffee
[00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:37.080]   appreciation. I want to
[00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:39.080]   master a genre
[00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:41.080]   of fiction or whatever.
[00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:43.080]   Just something high quality
[00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:45.080]   leisure that you really want to
[00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:47.080]   invest in and get better at.
[00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:49.080]   The key thing here
[00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:51.080]   about the phantom part-time job is that it's focused.
[00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:53.080]   You are putting this time towards
[00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:55.080]   one thing repeatedly
[00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:57.080]   and carefully planning when
[00:36:57.080 --> 00:36:59.080]   it happens. That is going to get you away
[00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:01.080]   from this weird scattered feeling of just
[00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:03.080]   I'm slacking or doing lots of
[00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:05.080]   hobbies and work and or
[00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:07.080]   getting lost in rabbit holes on the internet. So I
[00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:09.080]   love the focus of the phantom part-time job.
[00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:11.080]   Choose one thing. I am going
[00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:13.080]   to do this thing over the next six months
[00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:15.080]   during my work hours in the one-fourth
[00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:17.080]   of the work hours I have free.
[00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:19.080]   When you're that consistent
[00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:21.080]   and focused, you can do really cool things with that
[00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:23.080]   time.
[00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:27.080]   Alright, moving on.
[00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:29.080]   We have a question here
[00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:31.080]   from Lisa.
[00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:33.080]   Lisa asks
[00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:35.080]   how can I take
[00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:37.080]   regular eye breaks for eye
[00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:39.080]   strain in a way that
[00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:41.080]   accommodates deep work?
[00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:43.080]   Well,
[00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:45.080]   Lisa, I want you to do more
[00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:47.080]   productive meditation.
[00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:49.080]   Make this a bigger part of your habit
[00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:51.080]   that is in almost
[00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:53.080]   any circumstance
[00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:55.080]   where thinking has to be done.
[00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:57.080]   Alright, I'm putting together
[00:37:57.080 --> 00:37:59.080]   this strategy memo. What is the
[00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:01.080]   outline I want to use? I've received an
[00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:03.080]   email from a client
[00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:05.080]   or my boss and it's going to be pretty tricky.
[00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:07.080]   How do I answer this right? I got to really think
[00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:09.080]   this through. What I want to propose here.
[00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:11.080]   I have computer
[00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:13.080]   code I need to write, but I
[00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:15.080]   really don't know what
[00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:17.080]   type of object do I need here? What's the right
[00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:19.080]   algorithmic approach? Whatever it is, whenever you come
[00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:21.080]   across what should be if you're non-entry level
[00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:23.080]   on a regular basis, some
[00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:25.080]   contemplation that has to be done.
[00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:27.080]   Do that on foot
[00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:29.080]   away from a computer screen.
[00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:31.080]   This is what I call productive meditation.
[00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:33.080]   Working on a professional problem in your head
[00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:35.080]   while walking. This will be hard
[00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:37.080]   at first, but you'll get better at it with practice.
[00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:39.080]   Bring a notebook with you.
[00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:41.080]   When we walk, take notes. Walk, take notes.
[00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:43.080]   You're away from a computer.
[00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:45.080]   Notebooks do not cause eye strain.
[00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:47.080]   And then you come back once you've thought it through
[00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:49.080]   and are essentially transcribing
[00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:51.080]   that thinking back into your computer world.
[00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:53.080]   If you do most of your
[00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:55.080]   non-trivial contemplation
[00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:57.080]   on foot,
[00:38:57.080 --> 00:38:59.080]   your head, walking
[00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:01.080]   and notebook, this
[00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:03.080]   will automatically induce a
[00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:05.080]   regular rhythm of
[00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:07.080]   breaks from your computer screen that really should
[00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:09.080]   handle the eye strain, but also
[00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:11.080]   I think make you more effective at your work.
[00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:15.080]   All right.
[00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:17.080]   We have a question from Sophie.
[00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:19.080]   Sophie asks,
[00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:21.080]   "How do you manage long research projects
[00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:23.080]   while reducing
[00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:25.080]   anxiety?"
[00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:27.080]   And Sophie has some elaboration.
[00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:29.080]   She says, "I'm a
[00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:31.080]   PhD researcher in economics.
[00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:33.080]   From the start of a research project to publishing the paper
[00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:35.080]   usually takes three to four years."
[00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:37.080]   Wow.
[00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:39.080]   How do I manage this type of long and draggy research
[00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:41.080]   project, perhaps intertwined with other
[00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:43.080]   concurrent projects?
[00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:45.080]   All right. Well, that's long.
[00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:47.080]   Three to four years is quite long.
[00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:49.080]   I'm assuming
[00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:51.080]   at that duration what happens
[00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:53.080]   is three to four years of work and then a bunch of
[00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:55.080]   papers you produce at the end of it.
[00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:57.080]   If not, make that the case?
[00:39:57.080 --> 00:39:59.080]   I don't know economics well,
[00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:01.080]   but I do remember Adam Grant
[00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:03.080]   explained this to me at some point. I was talking to
[00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:05.080]   the author Adam Grant, who's also a
[00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:07.080]   professor at Wharton.
[00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:09.080]   And he talked about this, that in their
[00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:11.080]   work, which is very data analysis
[00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:13.080]   oriented, he's very economics oriented, even though
[00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:15.080]   he's a business professor,
[00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:17.080]   there's a long period of trying to get
[00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:19.080]   access to data sets that are good.
[00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:21.080]   And then once you have those
[00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:23.080]   data sets, you've really learned them,
[00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:25.080]   you pluck a lot of fruit from them.
[00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:27.080]   Paper, paper, paper, paper. So that might help, by the way.
[00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:29.080]   You might amortize here
[00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:31.080]   when you're doing these long projects, think about getting
[00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:33.080]   lots of papers out of the project.
[00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:35.080]   The other things I'll suggest,
[00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:37.080]   this was sort of an approach
[00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:39.080]   I used a lot in academia,
[00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:41.080]   the two plus one rule.
[00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:43.080]   So have two big
[00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:45.080]   projects you're working on at one time, but in
[00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:47.080]   different stages. So you have a project
[00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:49.080]   that's really in the hardcore,
[00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:51.080]   we're analyzing the data, we're starting
[00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:53.080]   to write
[00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:55.080]   stage. Have another one that's in the
[00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:57.080]   very early stage. I'm negotiating with
[00:40:57.080 --> 00:40:59.080]   the French
[00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:01.080]   Census Bureau to try to
[00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:03.080]   get the data I'm going to need to
[00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:05.080]   do my big Thomas Piketty style
[00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:07.080]   economic growth analysis or
[00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:09.080]   something. So different stages.
[00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:11.080]   So the early stage project
[00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:13.080]   requires sporadic
[00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:15.080]   attention and you can put it on hold for a couple
[00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:17.080]   weeks at a time, it's okay. You feel
[00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:19.080]   better about that because your second project
[00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:21.080]   is much closer to completion.
[00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:23.080]   And once that's done, your first project
[00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:25.080]   gets closer to completion, you can add in another early
[00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:27.080]   stage. So that's the two of the two plus
[00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:29.080]   one rule. The plus one is
[00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:31.080]   do something small
[00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:33.080]   that ships
[00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:35.080]   at least once every four to six months.
[00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:37.080]   So you feel like there's some
[00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:39.080]   progress happening. So hey, every semester
[00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:41.080]   I'm going to write, I'm going to publish a
[00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:43.080]   book review, I'm going to do a short paper,
[00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:45.080]   I'm going to go back to this data set I really
[00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:47.080]   analyzed and wrote some epic papers about
[00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:49.080]   let me take a month and
[00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:51.080]   put half of my research time on to
[00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:53.080]   extracting an additional cool little
[00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:55.080]   insight that's going to be a short note or a conference
[00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:57.080]   talk or something like that. So there's some
[00:41:57.080 --> 00:41:59.080]   wheel of public
[00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:01.080]   production that spins at a faster
[00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:03.080]   rate. So two plus one is a good rule for
[00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:05.080]   these type of research fields.
[00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:07.080]   All right, let's do one more question
[00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:09.080]   about deep work.
[00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:11.080]   This one appropriately enough
[00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:13.080]   comes from deep
[00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:15.080]   academic.
[00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:17.080]   I think if your parents named you that
[00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:19.080]   it would be, you know,
[00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:21.080]   would be a shame if you became like a YouTube
[00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:23.080]   influencer. So I guess you didn't have many
[00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:25.080]   options about what your job was going to be once your parents
[00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:27.080]   named you deep academic.
[00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:29.080]   Here's the question. How do you
[00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:31.080]   handle paper rejection
[00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:33.080]   as an academic?
[00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:35.080]   How do you help your students get over it?
[00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:37.080]   Yeah, it's a good question. I struggle
[00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:39.080]   with it. Non-academics
[00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:41.080]   don't realize this.
[00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:43.080]   They don't realize how
[00:42:43.080 --> 00:42:45.080]   incredibly competitive
[00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:47.080]   academia
[00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:49.080]   is, especially sort of
[00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:51.080]   tenure-track R1 research institutions.
[00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:53.080]   There's these venues in which you can
[00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:55.080]   publish your papers that are very stratified.
[00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:57.080]   And it is incredibly hard
[00:42:57.080 --> 00:42:59.080]   to get your papers published in the
[00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:01.080]   good venues. It's very competitive.
[00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:03.080]   Most things get rejected. So you're constantly
[00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:05.080]   in this competition. I think
[00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:07.080]   the public sometimes has this view of academia
[00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:09.080]   where A) they call it
[00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:11.080]   teaching, which
[00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:13.080]   again,
[00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:15.080]   research-oriented academics
[00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:17.080]   is a source of frustration
[00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:19.080]   that their job is described as
[00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:21.080]   teaching. It's like if you're
[00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:23.080]   a professional
[00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:25.080]   basketball player and people
[00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:27.080]   were like, "Oh yeah,
[00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:29.080]   you do leg pressing."
[00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:31.080]   You're like, "Well yeah, I do
[00:43:31.080 --> 00:43:33.080]   leg pressing in the gym as part of my training
[00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:35.080]   for being a really good basketball player,"
[00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:37.080]   which is incredibly competitive and hard.
[00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:39.080]   The hardest thing in academia is trying to publish
[00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:41.080]   in these competitive venues. It's intellectual
[00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:43.080]   warfare, the very smartest people in the world fighting
[00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:45.080]   for a small number of slots.
[00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:47.080]   10 to 15 percent of what
[00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:49.080]   is submitted is going to get accepted. It's very difficult.
[00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:51.080]   So you get a lot of rejections.
[00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:53.080]   It's
[00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:55.080]   competitive and it's difficult.
[00:43:55.080 --> 00:43:57.080]   I struggle with this. I've gone through
[00:43:57.080 --> 00:43:59.080]   different phases in my career.
[00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:01.080]   So when I was a graduate student,
[00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:03.080]   my pace of publication would be much less.
[00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:05.080]   Maybe one or two papers a year
[00:44:05.080 --> 00:44:07.080]   when I first got going.
[00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:09.080]   It would hit me hard when a paper
[00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:11.080]   would get rejected because it's all I had worked
[00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:13.080]   on for a few months.
[00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:15.080]   I have notes in my Moleskines I can go
[00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:17.080]   find of me reacting
[00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:19.080]   to rejections. I took them hard.
[00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:21.080]   Then as I hit my stride
[00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:23.080]   as a junior
[00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:25.080]   faculty member,
[00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:27.080]   the wheel started to click and
[00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:29.080]   I published a lot.
[00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:31.080]   I really got a lot of stuff accepted.
[00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:33.080]   There's a nice golden period where I published
[00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:35.080]   a ton of papers, got tenure early,
[00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:37.080]   got a distinguished professorship. Things were really
[00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:39.080]   rolling well. I was publishing four or five papers
[00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:41.080]   a month.
[00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:43.080]   Then I more recently, I've talked about this on the
[00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:45.080]   show, the pandemic
[00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:47.080]   knocked me back to the world of
[00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:49.080]   not submitting as
[00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:51.080]   much, way more rejections
[00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:53.080]   for the small number of things I was submitting.
[00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:55.080]   I'm back into that world of rejection.
[00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:57.080]   Briefly, what happened
[00:44:57.080 --> 00:44:59.080]   there for people who are non-academics, again,
[00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:01.080]   because it's so competitive,
[00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:03.080]   there is an incredibly high quality
[00:45:03.080 --> 00:45:05.080]   threshold.
[00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:07.080]   What happened to me during the pandemic
[00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:09.080]   is two things happened. One, I got knocked
[00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:11.080]   out of my collaboration cycles because I have collaborators
[00:45:11.080 --> 00:45:13.080]   around the world and we meet in person
[00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:15.080]   twice a year.
[00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:17.080]   They're top-notch collaborators. I've known
[00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:19.080]   most of them since I was
[00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:21.080]   22 years old at MIT.
[00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:23.080]   They're all over the world, but we meet twice a year.
[00:45:23.080 --> 00:45:25.080]   Usually, there's a time
[00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:27.080]   in the summer,
[00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:29.080]   there's a conference we all go to.
[00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:31.080]   One of my close collaborators,
[00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:33.080]   longtime collaborators, comes back
[00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:35.080]   to DC every summer. His family's here.
[00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:37.080]   We bring in other collaborators. We all get together.
[00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:39.080]   That's where most of the ideas
[00:45:39.080 --> 00:45:41.080]   were generated that we then write papers
[00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:43.080]   on. Turns out,
[00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:45.080]   if you don't have those meetings,
[00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:47.080]   as happened during the pandemic, you don't have the good
[00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:49.080]   ideas to work on.
[00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:51.080]   Two, I just didn't have the time.
[00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:53.080]   It was
[00:45:53.080 --> 00:45:55.080]   the typical impacts a lot of people had, especially
[00:45:55.080 --> 00:45:57.080]   people with kids with the pandemic. I didn't have as much
[00:45:57.080 --> 00:45:59.080]   time to spend on research.
[00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:01.080]   I went to about 50%
[00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:03.080]   effort.
[00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:05.080]   The issue is, in competitive
[00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:07.080]   academia, 50% effort
[00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:09.080]   doesn't mean, "Oh, you publish 50%
[00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:11.080]   less papers." It means any
[00:46:11.080 --> 00:46:13.080]   paper you write, the quality
[00:46:13.080 --> 00:46:15.080]   falls just enough that they're
[00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:17.080]   all below the acceptance threshold.
[00:46:17.080 --> 00:46:19.080]   I
[00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:21.080]   did that for a year. I basically didn't publish
[00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:23.080]   anything. Then I realized, "Oh, I should probably
[00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:25.080]   just put all of my energy into less papers."
[00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:27.080]   Last year, I published
[00:46:27.080 --> 00:46:29.080]   a very nice paper where I put my energy
[00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:31.080]   just, "If I can't have as much time
[00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:33.080]   to spend on this, let me put all the time into one paper
[00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:35.080]   because I can't fall below it." Anyways, I've been really
[00:46:35.080 --> 00:46:37.080]   struggling with it. It's the lowest publication
[00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:39.080]   year last year. It was the lowest publication year
[00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:41.080]   I've ever had
[00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:43.080]   as a professional academic because of the pandemic.
[00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:45.080]   I still struggle with it, the academic.
[00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:47.080]   I think it's hard.
[00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:49.080]   The best thing you can do
[00:46:49.080 --> 00:46:51.080]   is
[00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:53.080]   tune up your process.
[00:46:53.080 --> 00:46:55.080]   After some hard rejections,
[00:46:55.080 --> 00:46:57.080]   tune up the process.
[00:46:57.080 --> 00:46:59.080]   What's missing here?
[00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:01.080]   What would I need
[00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:03.080]   to do to not get
[00:47:03.080 --> 00:47:05.080]   rejected as often?
[00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:07.080]   Do I need better collaboration,
[00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:09.080]   more work, more whatever it is? Figure out
[00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:11.080]   how do I tune up my process? By the way, you can
[00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:13.080]   decide, "I don't want to do that. I don't have time to do
[00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:15.080]   that. That's not where I am in my career," but be clear about it.
[00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:17.080]   Then two, do the real work.
[00:47:17.080 --> 00:47:19.080]   There's no shortcuts around it.
[00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:21.080]   You probably just have to do
[00:47:21.080 --> 00:47:23.080]   the stuff that's hard. Read the papers, understand
[00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:25.080]   what's going on, push your ideas farther
[00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:27.080]   than you think they need to be pushed.
[00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:29.080]   Do the work that's required. Tune up your process.
[00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:31.080]   It's the best you can do.
[00:47:31.080 --> 00:47:33.080]   Then keep in mind there's some
[00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:35.080]   stochasticity too. There is going to be some luck.
[00:47:35.080 --> 00:47:37.080]   That should even itself out.
[00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:39.080]   Anyways, I'm with you.
[00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:41.080]   I came off a five-year period of
[00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:43.080]   hotshot publishing down to
[00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:45.080]   nothing. Now,
[00:47:45.080 --> 00:47:47.080]   I'm
[00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:49.080]   crawling back out of that, but
[00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:51.080]   carefully because I don't know that I want to go
[00:47:51.080 --> 00:47:53.080]   back to hotshot
[00:47:53.080 --> 00:47:55.080]   computer science publishing. There's so much other
[00:47:55.080 --> 00:47:57.080]   interesting stuff happening in the world now, especially my
[00:47:57.080 --> 00:47:59.080]   involvement in digital ethics and some of the public-facing
[00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:01.080]   writing I'm doing. I'm rebuilding my life
[00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:03.080]   from scratch academically.
[00:48:03.080 --> 00:48:05.080]   I will have more publications
[00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:07.080]   than I just had, but maybe not as much as I used to.
[00:48:07.080 --> 00:48:09.080]   It's hard. I feel
[00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:11.080]   your pain. Tune, process,
[00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:13.080]   do real work, recognize there's luck,
[00:48:13.080 --> 00:48:15.080]   and otherwise, try
[00:48:15.080 --> 00:48:17.080]   not to obsess too much about it because
[00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:19.080]   man, paper rejections is
[00:48:19.080 --> 00:48:21.080]   tough.
[00:48:21.080 --> 00:48:23.080]   All right. That's all the time we
[00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:25.080]   have for questions on Deep Work. Why don't
[00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:27.080]   we try to do a few questions now about
[00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:29.080]   the deep life? Moving on
[00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:31.080]   with questions about the deep life, our first one
[00:48:31.080 --> 00:48:33.080]   comes from Loves
[00:48:33.080 --> 00:48:35.080]   Deep Work.
[00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:37.080]   Good name.
[00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:39.080]   This question is, what are your thoughts
[00:48:39.080 --> 00:48:41.080]   on fasting
[00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:43.080]   and deep work?
[00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:45.080]   Well, I will say
[00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:47.080]   I do this accidentally
[00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:49.080]   quite a bit, as
[00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:51.080]   my wife will tell you and
[00:48:51.080 --> 00:48:53.080]   complain about sometimes when I'm really
[00:48:53.080 --> 00:48:55.080]   locked in on a deadline.
[00:48:55.080 --> 00:48:57.080]   I will just work all day and not eat.
[00:48:57.080 --> 00:48:59.080]   And I'll be honest, it doesn't
[00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:01.080]   seem to affect my work, though it does make me a
[00:49:01.080 --> 00:49:03.080]   real annoying person to be around
[00:49:03.080 --> 00:49:05.080]   afterwards. That's why she does not like that.
[00:49:05.080 --> 00:49:07.080]   My producer, Jesse, though,
[00:49:07.080 --> 00:49:09.080]   knows more about fasting.
[00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:11.080]   Jesse, do I have this right? You don't eat,
[00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:13.080]   what, lunch or you don't eat breakfast?
[00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:15.080]   You have some fasting thing going on. You probably know
[00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:17.080]   more about this. I eat
[00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:19.080]   basically just dinner every day.
[00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:21.080]   But I started,
[00:49:21.080 --> 00:49:23.080]   I discovered it through Tim Ferriss'
[00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:25.080]   podcast when he was interviewing Terry Crews.
[00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:27.080]   Terry, I saw a picture
[00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:29.080]   of him, he looked jacked anyway. And he's
[00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:31.080]   like, "Yeah." Ferriss asked him if he
[00:49:31.080 --> 00:49:33.080]   could do one thing.
[00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:35.080]   He's 50-something at the time.
[00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:37.080]   What would he do? He goes, "I would have fasted earlier."
[00:49:37.080 --> 00:49:39.080]   And I immediately started doing that.
[00:49:39.080 --> 00:49:41.080]   But I started an eight-hour
[00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:43.080]   period. I did that for a year. Then I just narrowed
[00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:45.080]   it even more. So now I just eat dinner.
[00:49:45.080 --> 00:49:47.080]   So what
[00:49:47.080 --> 00:49:49.080]   do you get
[00:49:49.080 --> 00:49:51.080]   out of that? What was Terry Crews
[00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:53.080]   pitching? If you do it, you get
[00:49:53.080 --> 00:49:55.080]   cut. Oh, interesting.
[00:49:55.080 --> 00:49:57.080]   Because you're, it all
[00:49:57.080 --> 00:49:59.080]   kind of calories in and calories out.
[00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:01.080]   So I mean, I wanted to get
[00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:03.080]   more cut. And
[00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:05.080]   I work out a lot anyway.
[00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:07.080]   And it was amazing. It was
[00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:09.080]   like, I immediately, well,
[00:50:09.080 --> 00:50:11.080]   not immediately, but over time,
[00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:13.080]   I got a lot more cut, more
[00:50:13.080 --> 00:50:15.080]   cut than I've ever been. And I've been doing this now for
[00:50:15.080 --> 00:50:17.080]   four or five years. By the way,
[00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:19.080]   those are all phrases you would
[00:50:19.080 --> 00:50:21.080]   never hear at a computer science
[00:50:21.080 --> 00:50:23.080]   faculty meeting.
[00:50:23.080 --> 00:50:25.080]   I wanted to get more cut.
[00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:27.080]   I'm working out a lot anyways.
[00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:29.080]   These are all phrases you wouldn't hear.
[00:50:29.080 --> 00:50:31.080]   But what about your concentration
[00:50:31.080 --> 00:50:33.080]   ability? Do you get hungry? Do you
[00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:35.080]   find that you're not able to think as clearly?
[00:50:35.080 --> 00:50:37.080]   Do you get the opposite? When it comes to this question about
[00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:39.080]   deep work, what do you think the impact
[00:50:39.080 --> 00:50:41.080]   would be? I think you actually
[00:50:41.080 --> 00:50:43.080]   think more clearly.
[00:50:43.080 --> 00:50:45.080]   Are you hungry? Do you get hungry? Yeah, I definitely
[00:50:45.080 --> 00:50:47.080]   get hungry. But every day is kind of like
[00:50:47.080 --> 00:50:49.080]   a battle. So
[00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:51.080]   every day you kind of just get
[00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:53.080]   through it. And eventually you get to
[00:50:53.080 --> 00:50:55.080]   the evening and you can eat.
[00:50:55.080 --> 00:50:57.080]   The other thing about it too is
[00:50:57.080 --> 00:50:59.080]   you can't really gorge at night
[00:50:59.080 --> 00:51:01.080]   either. You still got to eat healthy, especially
[00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:03.080]   as you get older and stuff. So that's one
[00:51:03.080 --> 00:51:05.080]   thing I realized.
[00:51:05.080 --> 00:51:07.080]   But the healthy food, just the nature
[00:51:07.080 --> 00:51:09.080]   of that food also probably just
[00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:11.080]   regulates what you can eat, right? Because if you're
[00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:13.080]   eating vegetables or whatever, there's only
[00:51:13.080 --> 00:51:15.080]   so much you can eat. Whereas if it was like a bag
[00:51:15.080 --> 00:51:17.080]   of tortilla chips, you could probably
[00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:19.080]   crush three of those.
[00:51:19.080 --> 00:51:21.080]   Yeah, you can't eat any processed foods for the most part
[00:51:21.080 --> 00:51:23.080]   unless you're cheating. I was just
[00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:25.080]   reading, I just revisited Tom Brady's
[00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:27.080]   TB12 book where he has
[00:51:27.080 --> 00:51:29.080]   a nutrition chapter
[00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:31.080]   in there. And it's
[00:51:31.080 --> 00:51:33.080]   simple stuff. He doesn't do anything that crazy. He just
[00:51:33.080 --> 00:51:35.080]   eats healthy foods. And
[00:51:35.080 --> 00:51:37.080]   you have to do
[00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:39.080]   that most of the time. But in terms of
[00:51:39.080 --> 00:51:41.080]   thinking and doing work,
[00:51:41.080 --> 00:51:43.080]   I think it really helps. And plus
[00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:45.080]   it doesn't,
[00:51:45.080 --> 00:51:47.080]   it limits
[00:51:47.080 --> 00:51:49.080]   the cognitive strain of
[00:51:49.080 --> 00:51:51.080]   buying a lot of stuff and think about getting
[00:51:51.080 --> 00:51:53.080]   food all the time and stuff like that.
[00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:55.080]   All right. So it sounds like maybe
[00:51:55.080 --> 00:51:57.080]   if this listener wants to experiment, experiment
[00:51:57.080 --> 00:51:59.080]   start with the eight hour. So skip breakfast
[00:51:59.080 --> 00:52:01.080]   or something. Yeah, I've
[00:52:01.080 --> 00:52:03.080]   had a lot of buddies because I've been doing it for a while and some
[00:52:03.080 --> 00:52:05.080]   of them do like eight and eight and a half hours, which I
[00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:07.080]   did for a year. And then
[00:52:07.080 --> 00:52:09.080]   I was like, I think I can crank
[00:52:09.080 --> 00:52:11.080]   this up even more because sometimes
[00:52:11.080 --> 00:52:13.080]   in the evenings and stuff,
[00:52:13.080 --> 00:52:15.080]   I want to still be able to have
[00:52:15.080 --> 00:52:17.080]   beer and stuff every once in a while. So I wanted
[00:52:17.080 --> 00:52:19.080]   to have more flexibility. So then I was just like, let me
[00:52:19.080 --> 00:52:21.080]   experiment with narrowing the number.
[00:52:21.080 --> 00:52:23.080]   And then it just became
[00:52:23.080 --> 00:52:25.080]   basically like an hour
[00:52:25.080 --> 00:52:27.080]   and a half to two hour, pretty
[00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:29.080]   narrow window. So I think we
[00:52:29.080 --> 00:52:31.080]   now have a bestseller here. Here's the diet.
[00:52:31.080 --> 00:52:33.080]   Only beer
[00:52:33.080 --> 00:52:35.080]   for eight hours. And
[00:52:35.080 --> 00:52:37.080]   then you go to food for the four
[00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:39.080]   hours that remains. The one
[00:52:39.080 --> 00:52:41.080]   thing I have heard, I've tried this before
[00:52:41.080 --> 00:52:43.080]   informally, I might try this more. I do
[00:52:43.080 --> 00:52:45.080]   know a couple of buddies who
[00:52:45.080 --> 00:52:47.080]   swear by
[00:52:47.080 --> 00:52:49.080]   they do
[00:52:49.080 --> 00:52:51.080]   like Laird
[00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:53.080]   Hamilton's coffee creamer or something
[00:52:53.080 --> 00:52:55.080]   like this, like a coconut oil, like a healthy fat
[00:52:55.080 --> 00:52:57.080]   in their coffee for breakfast
[00:52:57.080 --> 00:52:59.080]   and no other food.
[00:52:59.080 --> 00:53:01.080]   And they swear by
[00:53:01.080 --> 00:53:03.080]   that really
[00:53:03.080 --> 00:53:05.080]   giving them mental clarity.
[00:53:05.080 --> 00:53:07.080]   So it's like the caffeine, I guess
[00:53:07.080 --> 00:53:09.080]   there's a couple of things that goes on. One,
[00:53:09.080 --> 00:53:11.080]   the fats they use in these
[00:53:11.080 --> 00:53:13.080]   sort of high fat creamers
[00:53:13.080 --> 00:53:15.080]   slows down potentially
[00:53:15.080 --> 00:53:17.080]   the spread of the caffeine. So it spreads
[00:53:17.080 --> 00:53:19.080]   it out. And I don't know if there's a ketone
[00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:21.080]   situation or just an energy situation,
[00:53:21.080 --> 00:53:23.080]   but I do know people who swear by that, that
[00:53:23.080 --> 00:53:25.080]   they
[00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:27.080]   do one of these, I don't know how you
[00:53:27.080 --> 00:53:29.080]   call them, clean fat
[00:53:29.080 --> 00:53:31.080]   coffee creamers. And the one I've tried is Laird
[00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:33.080]   Hamilton's. Yeah, I've tried that too. I
[00:53:33.080 --> 00:53:35.080]   like it. Most of the time
[00:53:35.080 --> 00:53:37.080]   I try to drink my coffee black, but three
[00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:39.080]   times a week, I give myself the
[00:53:39.080 --> 00:53:41.080]   flexibility to have some cream. Yeah.
[00:53:41.080 --> 00:53:43.080]   That's something you could try.
[00:53:43.080 --> 00:53:45.080]   Maybe the, what's his
[00:53:45.080 --> 00:53:47.080]   name? Dave Asprey has something too. The Bulletproof
[00:53:47.080 --> 00:53:49.080]   guy, they have some other, but it's all the same thing.
[00:53:49.080 --> 00:53:51.080]   It's like coconut fat
[00:53:51.080 --> 00:53:53.080]   style MCT oil.
[00:53:53.080 --> 00:53:55.080]   You know, you give that a try and
[00:53:55.080 --> 00:53:57.080]   then just wait till at least lunch.
[00:53:57.080 --> 00:53:59.080]   The only thing I know for sure
[00:53:59.080 --> 00:54:01.080]   is true is that high carb or processed
[00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:03.080]   food crashes your thinking.
[00:54:03.080 --> 00:54:05.080]   Yeah, 100%. I mean,
[00:54:05.080 --> 00:54:07.080]   the food marketing
[00:54:07.080 --> 00:54:09.080]   industry is like, does one of the best
[00:54:09.080 --> 00:54:11.080]   food marketing campaigns of all time convincing
[00:54:11.080 --> 00:54:13.080]   us that we need to eat? Go to any grocery store and you can
[00:54:13.080 --> 00:54:15.080]   see aisles and aisles of stuff
[00:54:15.080 --> 00:54:17.080]   that you should just avoid. Yeah. So I mean,
[00:54:17.080 --> 00:54:19.080]   if you're eating, you know,
[00:54:19.080 --> 00:54:21.080]   a burger and fries for lunch,
[00:54:21.080 --> 00:54:23.080]   you're not deep thinking that afternoon.
[00:54:23.080 --> 00:54:25.080]   All right, we'll go on to
[00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:27.080]   the next question here.
[00:54:27.080 --> 00:54:29.080]   This is from Cal Fan.
[00:54:29.080 --> 00:54:31.080]   All right, so this must be someone
[00:54:31.080 --> 00:54:33.080]   who went to school
[00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:35.080]   in California. How do you maintain a healthy
[00:54:35.080 --> 00:54:37.080]   body posture while being at
[00:54:37.080 --> 00:54:39.080]   computer throughout the day?
[00:54:39.080 --> 00:54:41.080]   Don't be at a computer
[00:54:41.080 --> 00:54:43.080]   all throughout the day.
[00:54:43.080 --> 00:54:45.080]   It's much easier than
[00:54:45.080 --> 00:54:47.080]   you know, having to buy one
[00:54:47.080 --> 00:54:49.080]   of those Twitch streamer
[00:54:49.080 --> 00:54:51.080]   style jet engine
[00:54:51.080 --> 00:54:53.080]   jet fighter pilot gamer chairs
[00:54:53.080 --> 00:54:55.080]   to try to get your posture just right.
[00:54:55.080 --> 00:54:57.080]   Just don't be at your computer all day.
[00:54:57.080 --> 00:54:59.080]   In response to an earlier question
[00:54:59.080 --> 00:55:01.080]   this episode, I suggested anytime you have
[00:55:01.080 --> 00:55:03.080]   actual non-trivial contemplative
[00:55:03.080 --> 00:55:05.080]   thinking to do, do it on
[00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:07.080]   the foot. Just have that rule
[00:55:07.080 --> 00:55:09.080]   and you're gonna do better thinking
[00:55:09.080 --> 00:55:11.080]   but you're also gonna be up a lot more.
[00:55:11.080 --> 00:55:13.080]   So that's the key. Make the posture
[00:55:13.080 --> 00:55:15.080]   I mean, have good posture, but
[00:55:15.080 --> 00:55:17.080]   make it somewhat irrelevant because you're not
[00:55:17.080 --> 00:55:19.080]   at your chair long enough at a stretch
[00:55:19.080 --> 00:55:21.080]   that non-perfect posture is gonna cause a problem.
[00:55:21.080 --> 00:55:23.080]   All right, a question here from
[00:55:23.080 --> 00:55:25.080]   Monkey Mind.
[00:55:25.080 --> 00:55:27.080]   Hi Cal, what do you suggest to people
[00:55:27.080 --> 00:55:29.080]   who pick up habits and suggestions
[00:55:29.080 --> 00:55:31.080]   you give but not
[00:55:31.080 --> 00:55:33.080]   stick to them for more
[00:55:33.080 --> 00:55:35.080]   than a few days?
[00:55:35.080 --> 00:55:37.080]   I tell them they're
[00:55:37.080 --> 00:55:39.080]   losers. I tell them they need to give
[00:55:39.080 --> 00:55:41.080]   up and just
[00:55:41.080 --> 00:55:43.080]   watch TikTok videos.
[00:55:43.080 --> 00:55:45.080]   No,
[00:55:45.080 --> 00:55:47.080]   this is, here's the thing, you're probably
[00:55:47.080 --> 00:55:49.080]   you're probably bringing on too much at a time
[00:55:49.080 --> 00:55:51.080]   it's probably unrealistic
[00:55:51.080 --> 00:55:53.080]   and your mind is probably not on board
[00:55:53.080 --> 00:55:55.080]   with all the different things you're doing.
[00:55:55.080 --> 00:55:57.080]   So if you have all these big plans
[00:55:57.080 --> 00:55:59.080]   there's a deeper part of your mind, the
[00:55:59.080 --> 00:56:01.080]   planned evaluation center is probably saying
[00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:03.080]   I don't know Monkey Mind
[00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:05.080]   this stuff is not all gonna
[00:56:05.080 --> 00:56:07.080]   work, this is too much and
[00:56:07.080 --> 00:56:09.080]   we're not gonna do it.
[00:56:09.080 --> 00:56:11.080]   You kind of overloaded that planning.
[00:56:11.080 --> 00:56:13.080]   What I usually tell people is the
[00:56:13.080 --> 00:56:15.080]   foundation
[00:56:15.080 --> 00:56:17.080]   to any of these type of
[00:56:17.080 --> 00:56:19.080]   professional style habits is
[00:56:19.080 --> 00:56:21.080]   daily metric tracking.
[00:56:21.080 --> 00:56:23.080]   That's the one thing you have to do.
[00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:25.080]   It takes seven seconds at the end
[00:56:25.080 --> 00:56:27.080]   of each day or you can do it each morning
[00:56:27.080 --> 00:56:29.080]   and you have some metrics you track
[00:56:29.080 --> 00:56:31.080]   and you always do it. That's the thing you have to
[00:56:31.080 --> 00:56:33.080]   commit to. It's why my time block planner
[00:56:33.080 --> 00:56:35.080]   has this metric
[00:56:35.080 --> 00:56:37.080]   planning section on
[00:56:37.080 --> 00:56:39.080]   every daily page is you do that.
[00:56:39.080 --> 00:56:41.080]   Now these metrics
[00:56:41.080 --> 00:56:43.080]   then can point
[00:56:43.080 --> 00:56:45.080]   towards the
[00:56:45.080 --> 00:56:47.080]   habits you're trying to do through the day and you keep track
[00:56:47.080 --> 00:56:49.080]   of it with the metrics. Did I time block plan?
[00:56:49.080 --> 00:56:51.080]   Check. Did I do my
[00:56:51.080 --> 00:56:53.080]   whatever, my morning deep work session? Check. Did I do my exercise
[00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:55.080]   section? Check. How many
[00:56:55.080 --> 00:56:57.080]   chapters did I read? Whatever you're tracking
[00:56:57.080 --> 00:56:59.080]   and you track it there. The key thing
[00:56:59.080 --> 00:57:01.080]   is you track it even if it's zero, even if it's
[00:57:01.080 --> 00:57:03.080]   no. And even if it's again and again, no, I didn't do this,
[00:57:03.080 --> 00:57:05.080]   I didn't do this, I didn't do this. That's fine.
[00:57:05.080 --> 00:57:07.080]   But you're tracking.
[00:57:07.080 --> 00:57:09.080]   Here's what actually happened. That's the
[00:57:09.080 --> 00:57:11.080]   foundation for any consistent
[00:57:11.080 --> 00:57:13.080]   habit formation when it comes to professional habits.
[00:57:13.080 --> 00:57:15.080]   Then you begin to experiment with, okay,
[00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:17.080]   what is the
[00:57:17.080 --> 00:57:19.080]   right
[00:57:19.080 --> 00:57:21.080]   first step collection of habits that
[00:57:21.080 --> 00:57:23.080]   my metric tracking, I eventually actually start
[00:57:23.080 --> 00:57:25.080]   positively marking those things down
[00:57:25.080 --> 00:57:27.080]   on a consistent basis. And you start small. All
[00:57:27.080 --> 00:57:29.080]   I want to do is a
[00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:31.080]   good morning planning session.
[00:57:31.080 --> 00:57:33.080]   And I'll give a check if I do that.
[00:57:33.080 --> 00:57:35.080]   Okay, I'm doing that. I'm doing that.
[00:57:35.080 --> 00:57:37.080]   Now all I want to do is
[00:57:37.080 --> 00:57:39.080]   time block plan my day. Let me
[00:57:39.080 --> 00:57:41.080]   check if I'm doing that. Then you slowly
[00:57:41.080 --> 00:57:43.080]   start seeing what works and what doesn't. If you try
[00:57:43.080 --> 00:57:45.080]   something and you have the evidence in your metric
[00:57:45.080 --> 00:57:47.080]   tracking, you're not doing it, you pull it back, let me try something
[00:57:47.080 --> 00:57:49.080]   else. You slowly build up these habits.
[00:57:49.080 --> 00:57:51.080]   But you have to have that foundation of
[00:57:51.080 --> 00:57:53.080]   I'm keeping tabs on a
[00:57:53.080 --> 00:57:55.080]   record every day of what I did or didn't do.
[00:57:55.080 --> 00:57:57.080]   Your mind knows it's being tracked. It's
[00:57:57.080 --> 00:57:59.080]   embarrassed if you blow things off
[00:57:59.080 --> 00:58:01.080]   that you could do. That is the foundation.
[00:58:01.080 --> 00:58:03.080]   So do the metric tracking even if you're embarrassed
[00:58:03.080 --> 00:58:05.080]   by what you're tracking. And then slowly
[00:58:05.080 --> 00:58:07.080]   and experimentally add things into your life.
[00:58:07.080 --> 00:58:09.080]   Once something sticks, move
[00:58:09.080 --> 00:58:11.080]   on to something else. Give this a
[00:58:11.080 --> 00:58:13.080]   year of work and you'll come out on the other
[00:58:13.080 --> 00:58:15.080]   side with a pretty good set of
[00:58:15.080 --> 00:58:17.080]   carefully tested habits that work really
[00:58:17.080 --> 00:58:19.080]   well for you and your situation that you consistently
[00:58:19.080 --> 00:58:21.080]   follow. But it takes work and you can't do that
[00:58:21.080 --> 00:58:23.080]   work without tracking metrics.
[00:58:23.080 --> 00:58:27.080]   I will do one more question here. This one's from
[00:58:27.080 --> 00:58:29.080]   Alexander who asks
[00:58:29.080 --> 00:58:31.080]   how does a digital
[00:58:31.080 --> 00:58:33.080]   minimalist find interesting books
[00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:35.080]   to read?
[00:58:35.080 --> 00:58:37.080]   Well, my advice here is don't
[00:58:37.080 --> 00:58:39.080]   overthink it.
[00:58:39.080 --> 00:58:41.080]   Books are interesting
[00:58:41.080 --> 00:58:43.080]   just by definition.
[00:58:43.080 --> 00:58:45.080]   It's someone who has thought a lot about
[00:58:45.080 --> 00:58:47.080]   something, be it a fictional world or an idea
[00:58:47.080 --> 00:58:49.080]   or a period of history or event,
[00:58:49.080 --> 00:58:51.080]   have put a lot of effort into getting
[00:58:51.080 --> 00:58:53.080]   their thoughts on the paper.
[00:58:53.080 --> 00:58:55.080]   Just read.
[00:58:55.080 --> 00:58:57.080]   Don't overthink what you read.
[00:58:57.080 --> 00:58:59.080]   You're more likely to do more reading
[00:58:59.080 --> 00:59:01.080]   if you don't care so much about what it is exactly
[00:59:01.080 --> 00:59:03.080]   that you're reading. Go back
[00:59:03.080 --> 00:59:05.080]   and listen at the beginning of this
[00:59:05.080 --> 00:59:07.080]   episode or from last month or the month before
[00:59:07.080 --> 00:59:09.080]   the segments I do on the books
[00:59:09.080 --> 00:59:11.080]   I read each month and you will
[00:59:11.080 --> 00:59:13.080]   see it is all over the place.
[00:59:13.080 --> 00:59:15.080]   I'm not trying to impress anyone.
[00:59:15.080 --> 00:59:17.080]   I'm not trying to rigorously
[00:59:17.080 --> 00:59:19.080]   expand my knowledge
[00:59:19.080 --> 00:59:21.080]   of some niche area. I just wander
[00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:23.080]   all over the place. I've been obsessed recently
[00:59:23.080 --> 00:59:25.080]   with Hollywood figures.
[00:59:25.080 --> 00:59:27.080]   Why not? Let's read a bunch of books about that.
[00:59:27.080 --> 00:59:29.080]   I'll read random fiction. I'll throw in
[00:59:29.080 --> 00:59:31.080]   straight up self-help, but then I'll
[00:59:31.080 --> 00:59:33.080]   mix that in with essay collections and journalistic
[00:59:33.080 --> 00:59:35.080]   nonfiction. I don't care. I grab
[00:59:35.080 --> 00:59:37.080]   stuff. I finish. I need
[00:59:37.080 --> 00:59:39.080]   a new book. I grab stuff. I don't overthink
[00:59:39.080 --> 00:59:41.080]   it. You shouldn't overthink it either.
[00:59:41.080 --> 00:59:43.080]   Reading is like calisthenics
[00:59:43.080 --> 00:59:45.080]   for your ability to understand and
[00:59:45.080 --> 00:59:47.080]   think about the world. Don't
[00:59:47.080 --> 00:59:49.080]   sweat exactly what grip
[00:59:49.080 --> 00:59:51.080]   you're using on this metaphorical pull-up bar.
[00:59:51.080 --> 00:59:53.080]   Just get on that bar most days and do
[00:59:53.080 --> 00:59:55.080]   some exercising.
[00:59:55.080 --> 00:59:57.080]   All right. Well, that's all the time we have
[00:59:57.080 --> 00:59:59.080]   for today. Remember, if
[00:59:59.080 --> 01:00:01.080]   you like what you hear on
[01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:03.080]   this podcast, you will like what you read

[01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:11.080]   with a listener calls mini episode. And
[01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:13.080]   until then, as always, stay deep.
