[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.660]   - When I think about base rates,
[00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.740]   it reminds me of kind of the whole premise
[00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.960]   of thinking in bets, which is that, you know,
[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.860]   and it really brought to life the idea
[00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.180]   of asking someone to want to bet, right?
[00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.380]   Like the fact that we think of these beliefs,
[00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.300]   we have these ideas that we think are so certain
[00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.120]   and we're so confident,
[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.480]   I'm gonna hire someone, they're gonna be the best,
[00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.780]   is really just thinking about everything in life as a bet
[00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:30.060]   and challenging yourself to put certainties around things,
[00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.660]   even mundane, silly decisions,
[00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.460]   kind of the best way to rewire
[00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.220]   how this all works in your head?
[00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:37.860]   - Oh, I think so, absolutely.
[00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.660]   So here's the thing, when I say, do you want to bet?
[00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.500]   All I'm doing is making you examine the assumptions
[00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.260]   that are going into your statement.
[00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260]   - Yeah, one for my wife and I is always just like,
[00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:49.100]   remembering something.
[00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.980]   I'm like, oh, I'm totally sure that our daughter's preschool
[00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:55.580]   is starting next week.
[00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.100]   And like- - Right, do you want to bet?
[00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.620]   - My wife didn't ask that, but if she had,
[00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.460]   I would have been, oh, you know,
[00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.180]   like I don't know if I want to put all my money on the line.
[00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.060]   - Right, because what it makes you think about
[00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:06.180]   is like, there's a couple of things.
[00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.060]   Well, what does the person who's betting me
[00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.080]   know that I don't know?
[00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.020]   So in some sense, when I say want to bet,
[00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.580]   I'm acting a little bit as a coach to you.
[00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.580]   'Cause I'm telling you that I have a perspective
[00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:16.660]   that is different from yours.
[00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.220]   If I'm willing to bet, that means that I'm saying
[00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.220]   that I believe something different than you.
[00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.060]   Okay, so it's automatically making you start to think like,
[00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.660]   well, what's a different way to look at this, right?
[00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.660]   And then you have to start examining like,
[00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.620]   well, exactly how sure am I of this?
[00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.740]   Like, so this is, you know,
[00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.220]   my husband and I talk like this all the time, right?
[00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.900]   Where generally where it is, it's like,
[00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.460]   well, what's the price?
[00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.340]   That's what we ended up doing,
[00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.500]   which is just a way to say what's the probability, right?
[00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.100]   So we don't think about bets as just like dollar for dollar.
[00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.060]   Like he might say that, you know, he's,
[00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.900]   let's say that it's an election, right?
[00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.980]   And you say, I live in Pennsylvania.
[00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.100]   So let's say you say like,
[00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.780]   I'm sure John Fetterman's gonna win the election
[00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.240]   and someone says want to bet.
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.020]   They might, you could say, you could immediately say yes,
[00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.460]   but then the response would be, well, what's the price?
[00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.980]   What are you willing to, are you willing to lay me a price?
[00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.380]   Are you giving me a price?
[00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.580]   So in other words, like as an example,
[00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.340]   if I say to you, I'll bet $10 for every dollar that you bet,
[00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.540]   I'm telling you that I'm very certain that I'm right.
[00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.700]   'Cause I'm risking a lot compared to what I can win.
[00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.940]   But if I say, no, no, no, no, no, right?
[00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.340]   So the implied thing is like,
[00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.060]   if I say I'm 90% sure of something,
[00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.980]   I should be willing to lay you nine to one,
[00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.940]   $9 for every one, right?
[00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.060]   But as soon as I'm like, what?
[00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.620]   When you say, okay, I'll take the nine to one
[00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.300]   and I go, wait, no, no, no, no, no, like even money.
[00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.100]   Then what I'm saying actually is actually,
[00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.420]   I think it's 50/50 and I was, you know,
[00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.140]   I wasn't really thinking about it.
[00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:04.140]   So it's like a good way to kind of be like interacting.
[00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.060]   And I can tell you that I do this with little things
[00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.540]   and big things and whatever.
[00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.540]   It's actually kind of fun once you start like,
[00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:12.940]   well, what price do you want to lay?
[00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.340]   And we always bet a dollar, it's really fun.
[00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.900]   So, but I think that the thing that's really important
[00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.180]   about the betting and this is really,
[00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.300]   this is so crucial to good decision-making
[00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:30.460]   is that it forces you to make the things
[00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:33.560]   that are implicit in the decision you're making explicit.
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.380]   Okay, so as an example,
[00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.180]   the simplest example is one of the things
[00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.180]   that is always implicit in the decision you're making
[00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.460]   is your forecast of the probability
[00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:49.420]   of different things occurring.
[00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.100]   In other words, whether you know it or not,
[00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.460]   base rates are part of the decision-making.
[00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:59.780]   So when I say to you,
[00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.460]   I'm gonna meet you for dinner at seven o'clock
[00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:06.780]   and I promise I'll be on time.
[00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.200]   And you say, wanna bet?
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:14.060]   Implied in that is that I must have a tendency to be late.
[00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:15.820]   And the question is how much of a tendency
[00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:16.780]   do I have to be late?
[00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.660]   And how willing am I to say to you,
[00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.660]   yes, I'll bet you that I'm gonna be on time, right?
[00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.100]   So when I say things like that and then you bet back,
[00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.260]   those are all things that have to do with base rates, right?
[00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:31.940]   You could say something like,
[00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:35.140]   I know the stock market is gonna go up this year.
[00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:36.940]   Well, that's a prediction of the future.
[00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.740]   And if I know the base rates, I may bet you on that,
[00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.680]   depending on what you're willing to lay me, right?
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.300]   'Cause the stock market goes up actually somewhere
[00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:45.940]   between like, it depends on how you measure it,
[00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.900]   65 and 75% of the years, it will go up.
[00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.420]   So if you say I'm a hundred percent sure
[00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:53.480]   it's gonna go up this year, I might bet you.
[00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:54.740]   Because now what I'm doing-
[00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.500]   - I would take that bet because there are actually options
[00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.900]   out there I could use to arbitrage your confidence.
[00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.740]   - That is true, that is very true.
[00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.020]   But I'm not involved in the arbitrage.
[00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.140]   So you can hedge away, I'm just gonna take my bet.
[00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:13.100]   And then maybe I'll hedge it as well.
[00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.980]   But the point being that,
[00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:19.900]   when somebody says wanna bet, it's like, when you say,
[00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.560]   I think this person I'm gonna hire
[00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.140]   is gonna work out 90% of the time and I bet you,
[00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:26.100]   it makes you actually go through and start thinking,
[00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.260]   well, wait a minute, why do I believe that?
[00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.740]   Remember one of the things that we wanna do
[00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:32.860]   in order to improve decision-making
[00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:35.620]   is to start thinking about what's the quality
[00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:37.700]   of the beliefs that we have that go into any decision
[00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:39.020]   that we're making.
[00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:43.140]   And part of that is making the implicit explicit.
[00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:44.460]   And this is one of the things
[00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.900]   that's so incredibly important.
[00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:48.900]   I mean, even talking about a hiring example
[00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.220]   where like you send out to a bunch of people like,
[00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:53.420]   what do you think the job description should be?
[00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:55.120]   What do you think the person,
[00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.280]   if you were describing them to a recruiter,
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:01.200]   what, and you're getting that all independently, right?
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:05.040]   What you're finding out is in an explicit way,
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:08.140]   when they would otherwise just go and interview somebody,
[00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:10.500]   what are the things that they think are important
[00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:11.740]   for filling this role?
[00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:15.180]   And now you've made that explicit in a way
[00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:16.860]   that you can, first of all, examine it,
[00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:19.180]   which is incredibly important, right?
[00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:21.380]   We have to be able to examine our decisions.
[00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:26.340]   And that means that we have to actually make all this stuff
[00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:29.140]   that's sort of in our gut explicit in a way
[00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:31.720]   where you can examine it like an object.
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:35.060]   You can walk around it, you can have discussions about it.
[00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:38.180]   You can, I can see that you have a different perspective.
[00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:41.380]   And when we see that we have a dispersion of opinion,
[00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:43.780]   we can sort of dive into that dispersion
[00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:44.980]   to see where the gaps are,
[00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:46.940]   to see why you believe something different
[00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:48.660]   about the world than I do.
[00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:52.140]   And this is the way that we start to learn really fast.
[00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:54.660]   It's the way that we start to get our decisions
[00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:56.080]   to be much more accurate.
