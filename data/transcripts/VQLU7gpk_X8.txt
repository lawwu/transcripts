[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.920]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:05.920]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.480]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.320]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.240]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.000]   This podcast is separate from my teaching
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.640]   and research roles at Stanford.
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.900]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.980]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.240]   about science and science-related tools
[00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.880]   to the general public.
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.120]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.240]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.280]   Our first sponsor is Roca.
[00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.040]   Roca makes sunglasses and eyeglasses,
[00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.960]   and I'm delighted that they're a partner
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.040]   and a sponsor for the podcast.
[00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.860]   As some of you may already know,
[00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.960]   I've spent two decades or more studying the visual system,
[00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.480]   how we see vision is absolutely the most important sense
[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.000]   by which humans navigate the world and survive,
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.220]   and our eyes as two pieces of our brain
[00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.440]   do many other important things as well.
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.420]   So taking good care of our eyesight is essential.
[00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.260]   Founded by two All-American swimmers from Stanford,
[00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.320]   Roca was born out of an obsession for performance.
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.840]   They've carefully put science and purpose
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.180]   behind their design choices,
[00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.200]   and they've built absolutely terrific products as a result.
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.200]   The glasses are amazing.
[00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.940]   I love them because they look great,
[00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.260]   they are super comfortable,
[00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.160]   and the optical clarity is incredible.
[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.000]   They filter out sunlight in a way
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.320]   that still allows you to see contrast and shadows
[00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.340]   the way you need to.
[00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.960]   For me, one of the things that's really irritating
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.680]   is if I have a pair of sunglasses
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.660]   that don't allow me to see all the things I want to see.
[00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.180]   And with Roca glasses, I get incredible contrast,
[00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.040]   but then I can also relax and be outdoors in bright light.
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.560]   And as the amount of light changes with cloud cover
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:39.940]   and things of that sort,
[00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.520]   my ability to see my surroundings
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.440]   is still really sharp and really clear.
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.480]   And that only comes from really understanding
[00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:46.880]   how the visual system works
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.600]   and how it adjusts to contrast and adaptation
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.440]   and all these different things.
[00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.120]   They really understand the science,
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.640]   and that went into the design of these glasses.
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.080]   And as many of you know,
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.340]   sunlight and the viewing of light is also very important
[00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.720]   for setting circadian rhythms.
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.880]   So that's also been incorporated into the design
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.720]   and science behind these glasses.
[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:05.860]   I do wear readers.
[00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.840]   I don't often wear them during the podcast,
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.080]   but I have to wear reading glasses at night.
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.960]   So I use their readers and I own a pair of their sunglasses,
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.720]   and I'm delighted with them.
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.620]   If you'd like to check out Roca glasses,

[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.780]   Today's podcast is also brought to you by Inside Tracker.
[00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.220]   Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.680]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.220]   to help you better understand your body
[00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.060]   and reach your health goals.
[00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.840]   I'm a big believer in getting regular blood work done
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.200]   for the simple reason that many of the important things
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.520]   that are vital to our immediate and long-term health
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.280]   can only be detected in a good quality blood test.
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.300]   The problem with blood tests is that most blood tests,
[00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.260]   you get a lot of information back about levels
[00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.940]   that are too high or too low of this thing
[00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.160]   or the other thing, but making sense of that
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.600]   and what to do with that information is very challenging.
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.140]   Even if you have a really attentive physician,
[00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.460]   oftentimes it's mysterious as to what to do
[00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:11.820]   with all this data.
[00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.540]   With Inside Tracker, they make it very easy to understand
[00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.980]   what all the metabolic factors, hormone factors, et cetera,
[00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.060]   mean for you and what to do about those markers.
[00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.760]   So they offer you directives in terms of nutrition,
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.760]   supplementation, as well as lifestyle factors
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.020]   like exercise, sleep, et cetera,
[00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.440]   that can allow you to take control of those numbers
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.240]   and bring them into the ranges that are best for you
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.880]   and your long-term health.
[00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.620]   Another feature of Inside Tracker that's great
[00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.440]   is their inner age test.
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.500]   This test shows you what your biological age
[00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.680]   and how it compares to your chronological age,
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.700]   which I can only imagine most everybody, including me,
[00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:47.800]   are extremely interested in.
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.000]   How long am I likely to live?
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.480]   How old am I really in terms of my biology?
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.060]   If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,
[00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.680]   you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman

[00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.080]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Athletic Greens.
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.720]   Athletic Greens is an all-in-one
[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.240]   vitamin mineral probiotic drink.
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.840]   I've been using Athletic Greens since 2012,
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.000]   and so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.740]   With Athletic Greens, you get a ton of factors
[00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:19.720]   that are good for you,
[00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.160]   mixed into this one really good tasting drink.
[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.600]   I like to mix mine with water
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.000]   and a little bit of lemon juice,
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.860]   and I drink that once or twice a day,
[00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.720]   typically once early in the day,
[00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.500]   and sometimes also in the afternoon or even evening.
[00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.640]   I'm able to sleep after drinking in the evening just fine.
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.360]   The reason I've been using Athletic Greens for so long
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.980]   that I continue to use Athletic Greens is that,
[00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:41.800]   one, I feel better when I take it.
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:42.640]   I just do.
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.920]   Psychologically, physically, I feel better.
[00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.400]   But also, it covers all my bases of the things that I need
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:49.800]   for my general health.
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.460]   It's sort of a foundational supplement,
[00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:52.480]   as I like to call it.
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.400]   In fact, when people ask me, "What should I take?"
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.160]   If I were to recommend just one supplement that people take,
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.980]   it would be Athletic Greens.
[00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.640]   With Athletic Greens, you get support for your gut,
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.980]   which is important because the gut microbiome
[00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:06.580]   is important for the gut brain access,
[00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.800]   for mood, metabolism, hormones, et cetera.
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.440]   There are so many data that support that statement.
[00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.840]   As well, there are many factors in Athletic Greens
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.800]   that support general health, metabolism, endocrine factors,
[00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.520]   immunity, et cetera.
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.020]   So with Athletic Greens, I drink it once or twice a day,
[00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.180]   and I know that I've got all that covered.
[00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:25.640]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.800]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman.
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.160]   And if you do that, you can claim a special offer.
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.960]   They'll send you five free travel packs
[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:37.520]   plus a year supply, excuse me, of vitamin D3 and K2.
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.600]   So you get the five free travel packs
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:40.920]   and a year supply of D3.
[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:44.040]   If you go to athleticgreens.com/huberman,
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.800]   you can claim that special offer.
[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.380]   For the last month, four episodes to be exact,
[00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:51.520]   we've been discussing physical performance
[00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.440]   and skill learning.
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.060]   We've talked about how to learn skills faster,
[00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:59.080]   whether or not those are skills for athletic performance,
[00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:02.200]   dance, music, things of that sort.
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.440]   We've also talked about how to gain strength
[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:08.020]   and how to lose fat faster by leveraging the nervous system.
[00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:11.320]   Things like shiver and non-shiver,
[00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:14.460]   non-exercise activity-induced thermogenesis.
[00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:16.720]   We talked about how neurons can actually
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.160]   trigger accelerated fat loss.
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.440]   We talked about hypertrophy, also called muscle growth.
[00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:26.240]   And we covered everything from sets and reps, protocols,
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:29.360]   how long to stay in a cold ice bath, when to get out,
[00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.720]   how to keep shivering.
[00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.720]   We've covered a lot of tools and a lot of science.
[00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:35.080]   So if you're interested in those things
[00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.720]   and you even perhaps want to learn a little bit
[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:41.320]   about how we make energy, ATP, from carbohydrates
[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:45.280]   or from fats, it's all covered in the previous four episodes.
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.080]   This was going to be the time that we moved
[00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.360]   to a new topic entirely, but we are going to do
[00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:53.800]   one more episode in this series on physical performance
[00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:57.540]   for the simple reason that you asked many questions
[00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:59.680]   about something that's vitally important,
[00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:02.240]   both for physical performance and long-term
[00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:05.880]   and short-term health, and that's endurance.
[00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:08.880]   And so today we are going to talk about endurance.
[00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:10.820]   Now, if you're a strength athlete
[00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:14.360]   or you're not interested in endurance,
[00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:16.880]   don't depart just yet because it turns out
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:18.620]   that there are ways to train endurance
[00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:21.520]   that are very different than I would have
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.280]   previously imagined.
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:26.480]   If you only think about long runs, long swims,
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:29.760]   marathons, half marathons, 10Ks, 5Ks,
[00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:31.700]   and that sort of thing puts you to sleep,
[00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:33.000]   kind of like Costello is snoring
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.760]   in the background right now.
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:38.260]   He's not a long distance endurance athlete, that's for sure.
[00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.000]   If you're interested in those things,
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.520]   or if you are averse to those things,
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.360]   I encourage you to continue listening
[00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:48.280]   because we are going to talk about a little bit of science
[00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:50.140]   and then some specific protocols
[00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:52.600]   that really define what endurance is,
[00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:56.040]   the four types of endurance and ways to train those
[00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:58.960]   in concert with the other things that you might be doing,
[00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:03.320]   like weight training or skill training or yoga.
[00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:05.340]   And if you are an endurance athlete,
[00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:08.280]   we are going to cover a lot of tools and science
[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:11.080]   that I'm certain will also help enhance your training
[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:15.440]   and performance in races or even just recreationally.
[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:17.960]   The topic of endurance, I think,
[00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:22.120]   has been badly misrepresented, frankly, online.
[00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:24.160]   And when you start digging into the science
[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:27.240]   and you start talking to real experts in this area,
[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.120]   what you discover, what I've discovered,
[00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:31.360]   is that it's an incredibly interesting area
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:33.320]   because it teaches us so much
[00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:37.820]   about how our body and our brain use fuels
[00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:40.200]   and how we can control which fuels
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:42.520]   are used by our body and brain.
[00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:45.960]   So today we will talk about the four kinds of endurance.
[00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:48.840]   We will also cover the topic of hydration,
[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:51.520]   which might sound incredibly boring,
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:53.360]   like, okay, just drink more water.
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:54.920]   But it's really interesting
[00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:57.560]   because not only is hydration
[00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:59.480]   a limiting factor on performance,
[00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:02.120]   but there is a right way to hydrate
[00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:04.200]   and there is a wrong way to hydrate.
[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:06.320]   There actually is a formula that I'll teach you
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:09.800]   to know how much water to be drinking,
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.300]   depending on your activity levels.
[00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:13.800]   And if that sounds like a simple thing,
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:17.040]   like, oh, just tap off water until your urine runs clear,
[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:19.360]   that's actually the wrong advice.
[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:21.400]   It turns out that if you don't hydrate properly,
[00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:24.400]   you can see 20 to 30% reductions in performance,
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:26.000]   whether or not that's strength,
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.540]   whether or not that's increasing hypertrophy,
[00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:30.280]   whether or not that's running, swimming,
[00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:32.120]   even mental performance.
[00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:33.700]   So even if you're not an athlete
[00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:35.440]   or a recreational athlete at all,
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:38.900]   I encourage you to stay tuned for the part about hydration.
[00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:41.740]   So we're going to cover as usual a little bit of science,
[00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:43.980]   and then we're going to dive right into protocols
[00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:45.600]   that you can apply if you like,
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:48.900]   and if you deem those correct and safe for you.
[00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:50.160]   Before we dive into all that,
[00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:51.640]   I want to make an important announcement,
[00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:54.860]   which is all the episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast
[00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:57.380]   are now housed on a single website,
[00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:59.880]   which is hubermanlab.com.
[00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:01.680]   If you go to hubermanlab.com,
[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:04.100]   you can find all the episodes in YouTube,
[00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:07.080]   Apple, and Spotify format with links there.
[00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:08.840]   The website is also searchable.
[00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:10.720]   So if you go into the little search function,
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:11.840]   which you'll find very easily,
[00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:15.460]   and you put in, for instance, creatine, or sleep,
[00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:17.680]   or ice bath, or sauna,
[00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:20.620]   it will take you to the specific episodes
[00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:22.960]   that contain that information.
[00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:26.360]   And in addition, if you go to the website, hubermanlab.com,
[00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:28.480]   you have the opportunity to sign up
[00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:31.660]   for what we call the Huberman Lab Neural Network.
[00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:34.560]   The Huberman Lab Neural Network is a zero-cost resource
[00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:37.380]   where once a month, perhaps more often,
[00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:40.280]   you'll receive a email newsletter,
[00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:43.280]   and that newsletter will contain specific protocols,
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:45.840]   announcements, attachments of PDFs,
[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:48.680]   and things of that sort of protocols, tools,
[00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:50.960]   and science from the podcast.
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:55.160]   We will also make any announcements about live lectures,
[00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:56.920]   which at some point I'll probably start doing
[00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:58.560]   in various cities in the US
[00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:00.520]   and probably around the world as well,
[00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:01.800]   as well as other things
[00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:03.440]   that I think would be really useful to you,
[00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:05.720]   all of course at zero cost.
[00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:07.540]   So that's hubermanlab.com.
[00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:09.980]   Sign up for the neural network newsletter.
[00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:11.560]   You can find that in the menu tab,
[00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:13.440]   or it might pop up when you get there.
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:15.000]   And I hope you will join.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.960]   And as a final announcement,
[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:19.580]   if you're not already following us on Instagram,
[00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:21.680]   you can go to Huberman Lab on Instagram.
[00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:23.920]   And if you do that, I often make announcements
[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:26.120]   and release protocols and links to protocols
[00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:28.320]   and things there as well.
[00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:29.720]   I briefly want to touch on something
[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:31.800]   from the previous episode,
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:33.880]   which is that if you are somebody
[00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:37.480]   that is trying to increase muscle strength and or size,
[00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:39.240]   or if you're simply somebody
[00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:42.480]   who doesn't want to increase muscle strength and size,
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:45.920]   and you just want to maintain the musculature that you have,
[00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:48.660]   it's vital that you perform at least five sets
[00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:52.240]   of resistance training per muscle per week.
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:55.140]   If we don't do that, we lose muscle over time.
[00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:59.000]   And that is one reason among many
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.720]   to have a regular resistance training protocol.
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:06.320]   Nobody wants to start resembling a folded over envelope
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:08.280]   or a melted candle.
[00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:10.740]   No one wants to have challenges getting up out of a chair
[00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:12.280]   or off the ground.
[00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:14.240]   Maintaining musculature is vital,
[00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:16.000]   not just to our immediate health,
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.760]   but to our long-term health trajectory.
[00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:20.400]   So I just want to emphasize that point.
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:22.680]   If you're curious about the sets, the reps,
[00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:25.520]   how close to failure to go or not go,
[00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:27.080]   whether or not you should be
[00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:29.080]   doing your cardiovascular training
[00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:30.680]   before or after your weight training,
[00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:32.600]   all of that is in the previous episode,
[00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:33.800]   right down to the details.
[00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:37.160]   And I like to think it made simple for you to understand.
[00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:39.840]   But I do strongly believe that resistance training,
[00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:43.200]   whether or not it's with body weight or bands or weights,
[00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:46.880]   or simply lifting rocks in the yard or logs in the yard,
[00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:50.200]   is vital for our systemic physiology
[00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:51.280]   and our overall health.
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:52.840]   And that includes our brain health.
[00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:54.160]   And I described the reasons for that
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:56.580]   and the mechanisms in the previous episode.
[00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:58.760]   Today, I'd like to talk about endurance
[00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:02.940]   and how to build endurance and how to use endurance
[00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:05.220]   for the health of your entire body.
[00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:08.480]   Endurance, as the name suggests,
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:12.760]   is our ability to engage in continuous bouts of exercise
[00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:17.760]   or continuous movement or continuous effort of any kind.
[00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:23.040]   And I do believe that our ability to engage in activities
[00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:25.820]   that we call endurance training
[00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:28.200]   or physical endurance activities
[00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:33.020]   do have carry over to mental performance
[00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:36.280]   of things that require long-term effort.
[00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:37.580]   I'll touch on that at the end
[00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:39.600]   and why there's reason to believe
[00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:41.560]   that there's a biological crossover
[00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:43.560]   between those two things.
[00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:44.920]   I don't think it's simply the case
[00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:46.600]   that if you train yourself to be a strength
[00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:49.040]   and speed athlete and to do short bouts of exercise,
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:50.220]   they're very intense,
[00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:52.500]   that you can only do mental work
[00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:55.520]   that's of short bouts and very intense.
[00:13:55.520 --> 00:14:00.520]   But it is clear that cardiovascular exercise,
[00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:02.560]   exercise where you're getting your heart rate up
[00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:04.280]   continuously for a period of time
[00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:05.740]   and endurance exercise,
[00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:07.880]   we will define what that is in a moment,
[00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:12.380]   is vital for tapping into and enhancing various aspects
[00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:16.000]   of our biology in the body and in the brain
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.600]   such that our brain can perform work
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:21.080]   for longer periods of time,
[00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:23.920]   focused work, learning, et cetera.
[00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:26.480]   So I want to dive into the topic of endurance
[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:30.200]   and I want to just begin by addressing something
[00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:33.000]   that's vital to any kind of effort,
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.180]   whether or not it's mental effort or physical effort.
[00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:36.640]   So as always a little bit of science
[00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:38.840]   and then we'll get right into protocols.
[00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:41.440]   So the key thing to understand
[00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:43.540]   about energy production in the body,
[00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:45.080]   meaning your ability to think,
[00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:46.320]   your ability to talk,
[00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:47.500]   your ability to walk,
[00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:52.040]   your ability to run is this thing that we call ATP.
[00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:55.040]   ATP and mitochondria,
[00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:59.080]   which are just little what we call organelles within cells,
[00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:02.380]   these little factories that make energy, if you will,
[00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:08.000]   ATP is required for anything that requires energy,
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.880]   for anything that you do that requires effort.
[00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:15.300]   And there are different ways to get ATP.
[00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:18.840]   And we have been gifted as a species
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:23.840]   with the ability to convert lots of things into ATP.
[00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:26.680]   We can convert carbohydrates,
[00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:28.040]   literally the kinds of carbohydrates.
[00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:29.760]   You eat a bagel, you eat a piece of pizza.
[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:32.720]   Pizza usually has dough and it has cheese
[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:34.360]   and some other things.
[00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:35.720]   Costello here is me talking about pizza.
[00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:37.320]   Costello loves pizza by the way.
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:39.400]   Eating a piece of pizza,
[00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:42.080]   it gets converted into various things,
[00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:44.720]   fatty acids from the fats,
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:46.960]   glucose from the bread,
[00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:51.960]   and those things get converted into ATP within cells
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:53.960]   through things like glycolysis,
[00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:55.240]   things like lipolysis.
[00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:57.240]   I talked about this in previous episodes.
[00:15:57.240 --> 00:16:00.460]   So our muscles and our neurons
[00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:04.140]   use different fuel sources to generate ATP.
[00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:07.280]   The ones that are used first
[00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:09.240]   for short bouts of intense activity
[00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:10.880]   are things like phosphocreatine.
[00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:12.880]   If you've only heard about creatine as a supplement,
[00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:15.640]   well, phosphocreatine actually exists on our muscles.
[00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:16.880]   And that's why people take creatine.
[00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:19.120]   You can load your muscles with more creatine.
[00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:23.680]   And excuse me, phosphocreatine is great
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:26.520]   for short, intense bouts of effort.
[00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:28.840]   So when you're really pushing hard on something physical,
[00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:30.800]   let's say you see a car on the side of the road
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:32.840]   and that car is stalled and the person says,
[00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:34.160]   "Hey, can you help me push my car?"
[00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:35.320]   And you start to push,
[00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:36.520]   that's going to be phosphocreatine
[00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:38.280]   is going to be your main fuel source.
[00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:40.940]   Then you start to tap into things like glucose,
[00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:42.700]   which is literally just carbohydrate,
[00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:44.780]   it's just sugar that's in your blood.
[00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:47.000]   And then if you keep pushing on that car,
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.560]   you keep in engaging in a particular effort
[00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:52.560]   or you keep studying or you keep listening to this podcast,
[00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:54.960]   you start to tap into other fuel sources
[00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:56.300]   like glycogen from your liver,
[00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:58.400]   which is just, it's like a little pack,
[00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:00.540]   just like you might've packed a sandwich
[00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:02.360]   or something for work.
[00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:05.580]   You have a little pack of glycogen in your liver
[00:17:05.580 --> 00:17:07.200]   that you can rely on.
[00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:09.840]   And you have fats stored in adipose tissue.
[00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:13.080]   Even if you have very, very low body fat percentage,
[00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:14.440]   like you're one of these people
[00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:16.460]   that has like 3% or 5% body fat,
[00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:20.260]   really thin skin, very little body fat,
[00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:24.820]   you can extract lipids, fatty acids from that body fat.
[00:17:24.820 --> 00:17:26.000]   It's like a storage pack.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.640]   It is a storage pack for energy
[00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:29.420]   that can be converted to ATP.
[00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:33.040]   So without going into any more detail,
[00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:35.940]   when I say today, energy, or I say ATP,
[00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:39.700]   just remember that regardless of your diet,
[00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:41.880]   regardless of your nutritional plan,
[00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:45.760]   your body has the capacity to use creatine,
[00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:48.240]   glucose, glycogen, lipids,
[00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:50.800]   and if you're ketogenic, ketones.
[00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:55.640]   We'll talk about ketosis in order to generate fuel energy.
[00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:59.080]   Now, the other crucial point
[00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:01.860]   is that in order to complete that process
[00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:04.620]   of taking these fuels and converting them into energy,
[00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:08.900]   most of the time you need oxygen.
[00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:12.300]   You need air basically in your system.
[00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:13.360]   Now it's not actual air.
[00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:16.480]   You need oxygen molecules in your system,
[00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:18.360]   comes in through your mouth and your nose,
[00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:22.120]   goes to your lungs and distributes via the bloodstream.
[00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:24.740]   Oxygen is not a fuel,
[00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:27.860]   but like a fire that has no oxygen,
[00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:29.900]   you can't actually burn the logs,
[00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:34.160]   but when you blow a lot of oxygen onto a fire,
[00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:37.520]   basically onto logs with a flame there,
[00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:42.340]   then basically it will take fire, it will burn, okay?
[00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:45.140]   Oxygen allows you to burn fuel.
[00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:49.040]   So today we are going to ask the critical questions.
[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:51.800]   What allows us to perform?
[00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:55.940]   What allows us to continue effort for long periods of time?
[00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:58.680]   And that effort could be a run, it could be a swim,
[00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:00.160]   it could be studying,
[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:04.580]   it could be anything that extends over a long period of time.
[00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:06.340]   Well, you're going to need energy
[00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:08.500]   and you're going to need oxygen.
[00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:10.920]   But the way to answer a question,
[00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:14.340]   like what allows us to endure, right?
[00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:17.660]   Endurance, what allows us to keep going?
[00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:19.660]   Well, we think of things like willpower,
[00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:20.500]   but what's willpower?
[00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:23.940]   Willpower is neurons, it's neurons in our brain.
[00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:25.560]   We have this thing called the central governor,
[00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:28.580]   which decides whether or not we should or could continue
[00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:31.120]   or whether or not we should stop,
[00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:33.520]   whether or not we should quit, okay?
[00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:35.680]   So whether or not you're somebody who has a lot
[00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:37.460]   of what we would call resilience and endurance,
[00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:39.940]   or whether or not you're somebody who taps out early
[00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:42.160]   and quits early or can't handle frustration,
[00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:44.420]   that has to do with your fuel utilization
[00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:45.760]   in specific neurons.
[00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:47.920]   So we have to ask the question,
[00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:51.280]   what is the limiting factor on performance, right?
[00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:53.780]   So instead of saying, what allows us to endure,
[00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:56.540]   we should say, what prevents us from enduring?
[00:19:56.540 --> 00:19:58.500]   What prevents us from moving forward?
[00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:02.220]   What are the factors that say, you know what, no more.
[00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:03.760]   I'm not going to continue this run.
[00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:07.000]   Or you know what, I've had a really long, hard day,
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   or maybe I've had an easy day or I'm feeling lazy,
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.600]   I just don't even really feel like getting up and moving.
[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:13.580]   So what we're going to talk about today actually gets right
[00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:16.760]   down to the heart of motivation and fuel use,
[00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:19.440]   motivation and fuel allocation.
[00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:22.240]   And we are going to talk about specific training protocols
[00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:25.660]   that you can follow that have carry over
[00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:29.180]   between the bodily systems of running, swimming, et cetera,
[00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:31.300]   and the way that your brain works.
[00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:33.820]   So let's talk about endurance by asking first,
[00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:36.820]   what are the limiting factors on endurance?
[00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:38.620]   What stops us?
[00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:40.880]   Because in addressing that and answering that,
[00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:44.740]   we will understand what allows us to get into effort
[00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:46.340]   and to continue effort.
[00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:49.100]   There are five main categories of things
[00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:51.820]   that allow us to engage in effort.
[00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:56.820]   And they are neurons, nerves, muscle, muscle,
[00:20:56.820 --> 00:21:03.220]   blood, things in our blood, our heart, and our lungs.
[00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:06.900]   Now, I don't want to completely write off things
[00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:09.980]   like the immune system and other systems of the body,
[00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:13.260]   but nerve, muscle, blood, heart, and lungs
[00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:15.340]   are the five that I want to focus on today
[00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:18.980]   because that's where most of the data are.
[00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:20.220]   As we go forward into this,
[00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:23.100]   I want to acknowledge Dr. Andy Galpin,
[00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:25.420]   who as with the last episode,
[00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:28.100]   has been tremendously helpful and informative
[00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:30.020]   in terms of the exercise physiology.
[00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:31.820]   He's a true expert.
[00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:32.940]   He has a laboratory.
[00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:37.420]   He's a full professor who does work on muscle biopsy,
[00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:38.780]   who understands the science,
[00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:40.880]   but who also works with athletes
[00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:44.040]   and works with recreational athletes, professional athletes,
[00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:46.540]   really understands at a variety of levels
[00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:47.700]   how all these systems work.
[00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:50.960]   He's the person I consulted with about today's episode,
[00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:52.820]   although I did access other literature as well.
[00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:55.340]   And I'm going to mention a key review
[00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:56.740]   for any of you aficionados
[00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:58.460]   who really want to get down into the weeds.
[00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:01.300]   But I encourage you, if you want more detail,
[00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:04.240]   to check out Dr. Andy Galpin's YouTube page.
[00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:05.840]   I think he's also on Twitter.
[00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:07.660]   He's definitely on Instagram.
[00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:10.900]   His content is excellent, and he really understands.
[00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:13.140]   I have learned and I really believe
[00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:16.980]   that an intellectual is somebody who understands a topic
[00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:20.300]   at multiple levels of specificity of detail
[00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:21.540]   and can communicate that.
[00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:24.460]   And Andy is a true intellectual
[00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:26.780]   of muscle physiology and performance.
[00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:28.580]   And if you hear the word intellectual
[00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:30.720]   and you kind of back up and cringe from that,
[00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:33.020]   understand that he's also a practitioner.
[00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:36.280]   So thank you, Andrew Galpin, Andy Galpin,
[00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:40.420]   for your support in these episodes.
[00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:44.240]   And we hope to have you as a guest on the podcast soon.
[00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:46.180]   So nerve, muscle, blood, heart, and lungs.
[00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:48.860]   Let's talk about neurons and how they work, okay?
[00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:51.140]   But I want to tell you about an experiment
[00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:53.840]   that's going to make it very clear
[00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:58.300]   why quitting is a mental thing, not a physical thing.
[00:22:58.300 --> 00:22:59.960]   So why do we quit?
[00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:02.540]   Well, an experiment was done a couple of years ago
[00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:04.120]   and was published in the journal Cell,
[00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:06.440]   Cell Press Journal, excellent journal,
[00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:10.300]   showing that there is a class of neurons
[00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:13.640]   in our brainstem, in the back of our brain,
[00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:18.040]   that if they shut off, we quit.
[00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:23.800]   Now, these neurons release epinephrine.
[00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:25.220]   Epinephrine is adrenaline.
[00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:28.200]   And anytime we are engaged in effort of any kind,
[00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:29.680]   we are releasing epinephrine.
[00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:31.300]   Anytime we're awake, really,
[00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:33.860]   we are releasing epinephrine into our brain.
[00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:38.700]   In fact, this little group of neurons
[00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:39.560]   in the back of our brain,
[00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:41.920]   it's called the locus coeruleus, if you like,
[00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:44.220]   is churning out epinephrine all the time.
[00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:47.080]   But if something stresses us out, it churns out more,
[00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:49.000]   and then it acts as kind of an alertness signal
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.680]   for the whole brain.
[00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:51.520]   We also, of course,
[00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:53.760]   have adrenaline epinephrine released in our body,
[00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:55.640]   which makes our body ready for things.
[00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:58.600]   So think about epinephrine as a readiness signal.
[00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:01.000]   And when we are engaged in effort,
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.280]   this readiness signal is being churned into our brain.
[00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:05.280]   When we're relaxed and we're falling asleep,
[00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:08.760]   epinephrine levels are low, okay?
[00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:11.840]   So they did a really interesting experiment
[00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:16.840]   where they had subjects engage in bouts of effort
[00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:20.180]   of trying to move forward toward a goal,
[00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:22.520]   but they manipulated the visual environment
[00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:23.480]   with these stripes,
[00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:25.980]   kind of like fences passing on both sides of them.
[00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:30.320]   And by doing that, they could trick subjects
[00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:32.480]   into thinking that their effort
[00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:35.440]   was either allowing them to move forward, right?
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:39.160]   Because these rungs on the fence were moving past,
[00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:41.840]   or that their effort was futile,
[00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:43.420]   that they were no longer moving forward
[00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:45.280]   because they would make the rungs move slowly,
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:47.700]   even though the subjects were making a lot of effort
[00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:49.240]   to move forward, okay?
[00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:52.360]   So this is analogous or similar to being on a treadmill,
[00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:54.360]   and you're trying to walk on this treadmill,
[00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:57.280]   and you just can't move the conveyor, right?
[00:24:57.280 --> 00:24:58.960]   Or you're in virtual reality
[00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:00.420]   and you're putting a ton of effort,
[00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:02.640]   but it seems like you're moving excruciatingly slow.
[00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:05.260]   I had this experience recently in real life.
[00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:07.440]   I was doing a swim in the Pacific.
[00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:10.640]   I was trying to go south and I was swimming
[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:12.040]   and I was caught in a current,
[00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:14.160]   not the kind that pulls you out to ocean.
[00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:16.320]   And I kept looking to my left
[00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:19.040]   and I saw this hotel on the shoreline.
[00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:20.820]   And then I was swimming and swimming
[00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:21.740]   and swimming and swimming.
[00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:23.480]   And 20 minutes later, I looked to my left
[00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:26.160]   and the hotel is still exactly where it was before,
[00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:28.400]   which meant that I wasn't moving.
[00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:30.520]   It felt futile.
[00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:34.300]   Eventually, either the current changed or something changed,
[00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:37.660]   and I eventually swam past the hotel,
[00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:40.180]   got back on the beach and eventually drove home.
[00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:43.140]   That's essentially what they did in this experiment.
[00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:45.460]   But what they found was these neurons
[00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:46.980]   that release epinephrine,
[00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:51.300]   there's another cell type called glia,
[00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:53.260]   which actually means glue in Latin,
[00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:54.260]   that is paying attention
[00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:56.200]   to how much epinephrine is being released.
[00:25:56.200 --> 00:26:00.040]   And at some point, the system reaches a threshold.
[00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:01.340]   It reaches this threshold
[00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:04.380]   and it shuts off the release of more epinephrine.
[00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:07.640]   It's like, I quit, that's it, no more effort signal.
[00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:14.200]   If they could extend the time before those glia said enough,
[00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:18.300]   if they could release more adrenaline into the system,
[00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:20.620]   then subjects would keep going.
[00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:25.620]   So our desire to continue, or put differently,
[00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:29.460]   our willingness to continue and our desire to quit
[00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:33.440]   is mediated by events between our two ears.
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:35.540]   Now, that doesn't mean that the body's not involved,
[00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:37.660]   but it means that neurons are critically important.
[00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:39.900]   So we have two categories of neurons that are important,
[00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:41.540]   the ones in our head that tell us,
[00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:43.820]   get up and go out and take that run,
[00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:46.460]   and the ones that allow us,
[00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:48.340]   encourage us to continue that run,
[00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:51.360]   and we have neurons that shut things off, that say no more.
[00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:52.900]   And we, of course, have the neurons
[00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:55.620]   that connect to our muscles and control our muscles.
[00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:59.600]   But the reason we quit is rarely because our body quits,
[00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:01.500]   our mind quits.
[00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:02.740]   Now, I would never want to encourage people
[00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:05.940]   to drive themselves to the point of injury.
[00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:09.420]   That's not going to be good for anybody,
[00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:13.120]   but it is good to know that it's neural.
[00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:15.020]   Our ability to persist is neural.
[00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:16.900]   So when people say, is it,
[00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:19.920]   I hear that sports or effort or fighting,
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:23.980]   or it's 90% mental, 10% physical,
[00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:27.180]   that whole discussion about how much is mental,
[00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:29.260]   how much is physical is absolutely silly.
[00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:31.620]   It just proves that there's no knowledge
[00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:34.340]   of the underlying biology behind that statement.
[00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:36.620]   It's neither mental nor physical.
[00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:38.660]   Everything is physical.
[00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:40.000]   Everything is neurons.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.300]   Your thinking is the responsibility of chemicals
[00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:44.780]   and electrical signals in your head.
[00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:47.880]   So it's not 90% mental, 10% physical.
[00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:49.080]   It's not 50/50.
[00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:51.040]   It's not 70/30.
[00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:53.860]   It's 100% nervous system.
[00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:56.000]   It's neurons, okay?
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.180]   So when people say mental or physical,
[00:27:58.180 --> 00:28:01.060]   understand it's 100% neural,
[00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:04.140]   and I'd love for the how much of it is mental
[00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:06.900]   and how much is physical to just disappear.
[00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:10.040]   That argument means nothing and it's not actionable.
[00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:13.820]   Now, what do nerves need in order to continue to fire?
[00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:16.180]   What do you need in order to get neurons to say,
[00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:17.860]   I will persist?
[00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:19.720]   Well, they need glucose.
[00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:24.080]   Unless you're ketogenic adapted,
[00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:26.360]   you need carbohydrate is glucose.
[00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:28.840]   That's what neurons run on.
[00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:31.680]   And you need electrolytes.
[00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:34.760]   Neurons have what's called a sodium potassium pump,
[00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:35.600]   blah, blah, blah.
[00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:36.800]   They generate electricity.
[00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:37.800]   We could go into all this.
[00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:39.060]   I will probably do an entire lecture
[00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:40.040]   about the action potential,
[00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:43.880]   but basically in order to get nerve cells to fire,
[00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:46.860]   to contract muscle, to say, I'm going to continue,
[00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:49.940]   you need sufficient sodium salt
[00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:52.100]   because the action potential,
[00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:55.180]   the actual firing of neurons is driven
[00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:58.900]   by sodium entering the cell, rushing into the cell.
[00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:01.900]   And then there's a removal of potassium.
[00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:04.340]   And then there's a kind of resetting of those levels
[00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:06.020]   by something called the sodium potassium pump
[00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:07.540]   and the sodium potassium pump
[00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:09.860]   and sodium and action potentials.
[00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:13.540]   Even if you don't know anything about that is ATP dependent.
[00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:15.420]   It requires energy.
[00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:18.540]   So you need energy in order to get neurons to fire.
[00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:21.240]   And it is pH dependent.
[00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:24.340]   It depends on the conditions or the environment
[00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:27.540]   within the brain being of a certain pH or acidity.
[00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:32.020]   pH is about how acid or how basic the environment is.
[00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:34.220]   And we will talk a little bit about pH in simple terms
[00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:35.060]   that you can understand.
[00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:37.780]   So nerves need salt, they need potassium,
[00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:39.680]   and it turns out they need magnesium
[00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:42.060]   and you need glucose and carbohydrates
[00:29:42.060 --> 00:29:43.380]   in order to power those neurons
[00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:46.340]   unless you are running on ketones.
[00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:47.820]   And to run on ketones,
[00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:50.900]   you have to make sure that you're fully keto adapted.
[00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:54.520]   I will talk about adding in ketones on top of carbohydrate
[00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:56.300]   at the end of the episode.
[00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:57.940]   Okay, so that's how nerves work.
[00:29:57.940 --> 00:30:00.300]   You need carbohydrate, you need sodium, potassium,
[00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:03.220]   and magnesium in order to drive the brain.
[00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:08.780]   Muscle, muscle is going to engage and generate energy first
[00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:11.460]   by using this phosphocreatine system.
[00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:14.040]   High bouts of effort, really intense effort,
[00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:16.460]   short-lived seconds to minutes,
[00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:17.660]   but probably more like seconds
[00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:18.980]   is going to be this phosphocreatine,
[00:30:18.980 --> 00:30:20.540]   literally a fuel source in the muscle
[00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:21.700]   that you're going to burn,
[00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:24.780]   just like you would logs on a fire.
[00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:28.280]   And glycogen, which is stored carbohydrate in the muscle,
[00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:30.700]   that also can be burned just like logs on a fire
[00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:31.660]   to generate energy.
[00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:33.240]   So let me make this crystal clear.
[00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:35.140]   If you move your wrist towards your shoulder
[00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:37.300]   and contract your bicep really hard,
[00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:39.940]   muscle fibers are burning up their own carbohydrate.
[00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:41.760]   They're converting that into ATP
[00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:45.000]   in order to generate that energy, okay?
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   And pH is important and temperature is important.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.780]   In the episode on supercharge, your physical performance,
[00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:56.980]   I talked all about how by using cooling,
[00:30:56.980 --> 00:30:59.660]   specifically of the palms or the bottoms of the feet
[00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:02.660]   or the cheeks of the face using particular methods,
[00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:07.660]   you can adjust the temperature of the body and of muscle
[00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:10.080]   in a way that allows you to do more work,
[00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:12.440]   to do more reps, to run further,
[00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:14.740]   to keep going and to persist.
[00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:19.740]   And that's because if temperature is too low or too high,
[00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:23.960]   then ATP is not going to be available
[00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:24.800]   because of this whole thing
[00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:26.660]   called the pyruvate kinase pathway
[00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:28.660]   and the temperature dependence of pyruvate kinase.
[00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:30.480]   Check out that episode if you want to learn more about that,
[00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:33.560]   but temperature is important and pH is also important.
[00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:34.700]   So we've got nerve, muscle,
[00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:36.500]   and then there's stuff in our blood
[00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:37.700]   that's available as an energy.
[00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:40.360]   Source and in blood, we've got glucose.
[00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:42.220]   So literally blood sugar that's floating around.
[00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:44.420]   So let's say you have fasted for three days,
[00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:46.440]   your blood glucose is going to be very low.
[00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:48.780]   So that's not going to be a great fuel source,
[00:31:48.780 --> 00:31:52.220]   but you will start to liberate fats from your adipose tissue
[00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:55.100]   from your fat, fatty acids will start to mobilize
[00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:58.860]   into the bloodstream and you can burn those for energy
[00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:00.420]   and oxygen in your blood.
[00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:03.140]   When you inhale, you're bringing oxygen into your blood.
[00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:05.340]   So these are all fuel sources in your neurons,
[00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:09.700]   in your muscle, in your blood, in your various tissues
[00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:14.700]   that are providing the opportunity to give effort,
[00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:17.480]   to induce effort, whether or not it's a run or a swim
[00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:19.260]   or writing or talking.
[00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:22.860]   Now, there are some other factors that are important
[00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:26.100]   and those are the heart, which is going to move blood.
[00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:29.980]   So the more that the heart can move blood and oxygen,
[00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:33.740]   well, the more fuel that's going to be available
[00:32:33.740 --> 00:32:38.180]   for you to engage in muscular effort and thinking effort.
[00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:39.940]   So your heart is vitally important
[00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:41.960]   to your muscles ability to work
[00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:43.600]   and your brain's ability to work.
[00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:46.660]   And as I've mentioned, oxygen a few times,
[00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:49.020]   it should be obvious then that the lungs are very important.
[00:32:49.020 --> 00:32:51.580]   You need to bring oxygen in and distribute it
[00:32:51.580 --> 00:32:54.700]   to all these tissues because oxygen is critical
[00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:56.740]   for the conversion of carbohydrates
[00:32:56.740 --> 00:33:00.060]   and the conversion of fats.
[00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:02.580]   And we could get into the discussion about
[00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:05.500]   whether or not oxygen is important for ketogenic metabolism,
[00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:06.920]   but you need oxygen there.
[00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:09.640]   You need to breathe and you need to breathe properly.
[00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:13.060]   So I just covered what would normally be about
[00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:16.940]   four lectures of energy consumption and energy utilization.
[00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:18.320]   I didn't go into much detail at all,
[00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:20.980]   but what I want you to imagine
[00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:23.380]   is that you've got these different cell types.
[00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:25.580]   You've got neurons, you've got muscle.
[00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:28.460]   They need to collaborate in order to generate effort
[00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:30.180]   or to make the decision to do something
[00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:33.060]   or to think hard or to run hard or to run far.
[00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:34.940]   And then you've got fuel sources,
[00:33:34.940 --> 00:33:39.940]   both in the neurons, in the muscle, in your blood,
[00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:43.980]   and then the heart and lungs are going to help distribute
[00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:45.720]   the oxygen and those fuels.
[00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:48.540]   And of course you have that little energy pack
[00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:51.220]   that we call the liver that will allow you
[00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:53.180]   to pull out a little more carbohydrate
[00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:55.300]   if you need it for work.
[00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:57.920]   Okay, so that's as much as I want to cover
[00:33:57.920 --> 00:33:59.160]   about energy consumption,
[00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:00.860]   because that's a lot.
[00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:03.020]   But what it tells you is that when you eat
[00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:05.000]   and you use food as a fuel source,
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.840]   that food can be broken down
[00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:10.040]   and you can immediately burn the glucose
[00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:10.900]   that's in your bloodstream,
[00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:13.740]   or you can rely on some of the stored fuel in your liver,
[00:34:13.740 --> 00:34:15.960]   or you can rely on stored fuel in the muscle,
[00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:17.360]   so-called glycogen.
[00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:19.060]   And there are a lot of different ways
[00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:20.960]   that we can generate ATP.
[00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:22.200]   So when we ask the question,
[00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:25.320]   what's limiting for performance?
[00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:28.280]   What is going to allow us to endure,
[00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:31.900]   to engage in effort and endure long bouts of effort,
[00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:34.540]   or even moderately long bouts of effort?
[00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:36.560]   We need to ask which of those things,
[00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:40.620]   nerve, muscle, blood, heart, and lungs is limiting?
[00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:41.820]   Or put differently,
[00:34:41.820 --> 00:34:44.040]   we ask what should we be doing with our neurons?
[00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:45.380]   What should we be doing with our muscles?
[00:34:45.380 --> 00:34:47.020]   What should we be doing with our blood?
[00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:48.180]   What should we be doing with our heart?
[00:34:48.180 --> 00:34:50.320]   And what should we be doing with our lungs
[00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:53.940]   that's going to allow us to build endurance
[00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:55.980]   for mental and physical work,
[00:34:55.980 --> 00:35:00.980]   and to be able to go longer, further with more intensity?
[00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:03.960]   That's the real question.
[00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:06.100]   How can we do more work?
[00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:07.980]   And the way we do that is with energy,
[00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:10.500]   and the way to get energy to it is to buy those five things.
[00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:12.240]   And so now we're going to talk about
[00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:16.440]   how you can actually build different types of endurance,
[00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:19.760]   and what that does at the level of your blood,
[00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:21.500]   your heart, your muscles, and your neurons.
[00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:23.400]   So we're going to skip back and forth
[00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:26.880]   between protocols, tools, and the underlying science.
[00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:29.520]   So rather than heavy stack the science at the front end,
[00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:31.240]   and then just give you all the tools at the end,
[00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:34.760]   we're going to talk about the protocols,
[00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:37.240]   the four kinds of endurance, and how to achieve them.
[00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:39.560]   And we are going to talk about the underlying science
[00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:41.560]   as we move through that.
[00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:44.180]   If you would like a lot of detailed science,
[00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:46.200]   I encourage you to check out a review
[00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:48.800]   that we've linked in the show notes.
[00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:50.200]   And the review is called
[00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:53.120]   Adaptations to Endurance and Strength Training.
[00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:56.520]   This is a review article with many excellent citations.
[00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:59.280]   It's from Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Medicine.
[00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:00.320]   The Cold Spring Harbor Press
[00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:02.320]   is an excellent scientific press.
[00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:04.840]   It's been the last 21 years doing summers
[00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:07.220]   at Cold Spring Harbor teaching neuroscience,
[00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:10.200]   but Cold Spring Harbor is involved in all sorts of themes
[00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:14.240]   and topics related to neuroscience and medicine.
[00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:18.600]   This review by Hughes Elifesen,
[00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:22.140]   Elifesen, that's the name, Elifesen and Barr, B-A-A-R,
[00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:24.200]   Adaptations to Endurance and Strength Training
[00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:26.040]   is rich with citations.
[00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:28.400]   It can be downloaded as a complete PDF.
[00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:30.840]   There's no paywall, and we will link to it.
[00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:34.980]   And it gets really deep into all the signaling cascades,
[00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:37.640]   the genetic changes within muscle
[00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:39.240]   with high-intensity interval training,
[00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:43.840]   short-term super high-intensity training, weight training.
[00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:46.360]   So if you're a real nerd for this stuff
[00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:48.980]   and you want to get right down into how PGC1 alpha,
[00:36:48.980 --> 00:36:53.440]   P53 and pH 20 change the adaptation features
[00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:54.960]   of muscle and gene regulation,
[00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:56.700]   that is definitely the review for you.
[00:36:56.700 --> 00:36:58.080]   If you're like most people
[00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:00.760]   and you're not really interested in that level of detail,
[00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:02.140]   no reason to pick up the review
[00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:03.240]   unless you just want to check out
[00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:05.500]   some of the figures and pictures.
[00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:07.800]   But I do want to offer that as a resource.
[00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:11.360]   It's been, in addition to discussions with Dr. Andy Galpin,
[00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:12.960]   it's been a primary resource
[00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:15.660]   for the content of this episode.
[00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:18.380]   So let's talk about the four kinds of endurance
[00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:20.620]   and how to achieve those.
[00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:23.020]   I do believe that everybody should have
[00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:27.380]   some sort of endurance practice, regular endurance practice.
[00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:28.880]   It's clear that it's vital
[00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:31.440]   for the functioning of the body and the mind,
[00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:34.700]   and there are clear longevity benefits.
[00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:38.080]   There are a lot of reasons why that's true,
[00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:40.920]   but the main one is that
[00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:45.920]   if we have good energy utilization in our musculature
[00:37:46.460 --> 00:37:50.000]   and in our blood, in our vascular system,
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.420]   and in our oxygenating system, our lungs,
[00:37:53.420 --> 00:37:55.160]   the so-called cardiovascular system,
[00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:57.660]   respiratory system, and musculature,
[00:37:57.660 --> 00:38:00.040]   the body and brain function much better.
[00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:04.140]   There are so many papers now, so much data to support that.
[00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:07.140]   So I do believe everyone should either try
[00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:09.560]   to maintain the muscle that they have,
[00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:11.220]   provided they've already gone through puberty
[00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:14.960]   and development, and they should be engaged
[00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:16.760]   in regular endurance exercise.
[00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:19.620]   Now, for many people, they think endurance exercise,
[00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:22.460]   that means what, an hour long run,
[00:38:22.460 --> 00:38:24.380]   or I got to get on the StairMaster,
[00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:27.320]   or I have to treadmill for hours on end each week.
[00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:28.660]   It turns out that's not the case.
[00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:30.300]   There are four kinds of endurance,
[00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:33.540]   and you can train specifically for any one of those,
[00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:35.060]   and you can vary your training.
[00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:37.360]   So let's talk about those four kinds of endurance,
[00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:38.480]   because they're very interesting,
[00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:41.740]   and they each have very different protocols
[00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:45.440]   that you use in order to build and maximize them,
[00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:49.400]   and now you'll understand what fuel sources they use
[00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:51.680]   in order to build that thing we call endurance.
[00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:55.460]   So first of all, we have muscular endurance.
[00:38:55.460 --> 00:39:00.460]   Muscular endurance is the ability for our muscles
[00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:04.200]   to perform work over time,
[00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:09.040]   and our failure to continue to be able to perform that work
[00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:12.360]   is going to be due to muscular fatigue,
[00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:15.080]   not to cardiovascular fatigue.
[00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:16.800]   So not because we're breathing too hard,
[00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:19.120]   or we can't get enough blood to the muscles,
[00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:21.200]   or because we quit mentally,
[00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:25.540]   but because the muscles themselves give out, okay?
[00:39:25.540 --> 00:39:28.200]   One good example of this would be
[00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:32.640]   if you had to pick up a stone in the yard,
[00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:36.380]   and that stone is not extremely heavy for you,
[00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:40.860]   and you needed to do that anywhere from 50 to 100 times,
[00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:42.520]   and you were picking it up, and putting it down,
[00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:43.760]   and picking it up, and putting it down,
[00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:45.440]   and picking up, and putting it down,
[00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:48.560]   at some point, your muscles will fatigue.
[00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:50.720]   They will fail to endure.
[00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:53.840]   Muscular endurance is incredibly useful
[00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:57.180]   for a variety of physical pursuits,
[00:39:57.180 --> 00:39:58.800]   and we will talk about the mental pursuits
[00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:00.520]   that it supports as well.
[00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:02.720]   In terms of physical pursuits,
[00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:06.880]   the ability for a given muscle to perform repeated work
[00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:09.340]   is going to improve your golf swing.
[00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:11.680]   It's going to improve your tennis swing.
[00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:14.800]   It's going to improve your posture, your ability to dance,
[00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:18.700]   your ability to repeatedly engage in an activity
[00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:23.300]   that requires effort in a way that's very different
[00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:25.400]   from the kind of endurance that you will build
[00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:28.220]   simply by increasing your cardiovascular fitness,
[00:40:28.220 --> 00:40:31.240]   your ability to generate kind of easy repetition.
[00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:33.960]   So let's talk about muscular endurance and what it is.
[00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:36.720]   Muscular endurance is going to be something
[00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:41.720]   that you can perform for anywhere from 12 to 25,
[00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:44.720]   or even up to 100 repetitions,
[00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:46.700]   and that's actually how, if you like,
[00:40:46.700 --> 00:40:48.840]   you would train muscular endurance,
[00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:51.880]   and I will give the specific protocol in a few moments.
[00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:54.900]   So a good example is pushups, right?
[00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:59.620]   If you were to get on the floor and start doing pushups,
[00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:02.800]   even if you're somebody who has to do knees-down pushups,
[00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:04.120]   and you're doing your pushups,
[00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:06.540]   eventually you won't be able to do any more pushups,
[00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:07.660]   and that's not going to be
[00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:12.100]   because you couldn't get enough oxygen into your system
[00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:14.960]   or your heart wasn't pumping enough blood.
[00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:18.400]   It's going to be because the muscles fail, that's why.
[00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:20.500]   So if you want to be able to do more pushups
[00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:22.140]   or even more pull-ups,
[00:41:22.140 --> 00:41:25.100]   muscular endurance is really what it's about.
[00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:26.380]   It's actually no coincidence
[00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:29.640]   that a lot of military bootcamp-style training
[00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:30.720]   is not done with weights.
[00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:32.120]   It's done with things like pushups,
[00:41:32.120 --> 00:41:34.000]   pull-ups, sit-ups, and running,
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.200]   because what they're really building is muscular endurance,
[00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:39.520]   the ability to perform work repeatedly over time
[00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:42.320]   for a given set of muscles and neurons.
[00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:44.520]   So what's a good protocol to build muscular endurance?
[00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:45.520]   Let's just give that to you now
[00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:50.520]   and explain some of the underlying science as it follows.
[00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:54.720]   So a really good muscular endurance training protocol,
[00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:56.280]   according to the scientific literature,
[00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:58.620]   would be three to five sets
[00:41:58.620 --> 00:42:02.440]   of anywhere from 12 to 100 repetitions.
[00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:04.120]   That's a huge range.
[00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:06.500]   Now, 12 to 25 repetitions
[00:42:06.500 --> 00:42:11.500]   is going to be more reasonable for most people.
[00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:14.200]   And the rest periods are going to be anywhere
[00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:17.440]   from 30 to 180 seconds of rest.
[00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:19.880]   So anywhere from half a minute to three minutes of rest.
[00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:22.960]   So this might be five sets of pushups
[00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:25.080]   done getting your maximum pushups.
[00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:26.480]   For some people, that might be zero
[00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:27.840]   and you have to do it knees down.
[00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:29.340]   For some people, it might be 10 pushups.
[00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:30.500]   For some people, it might be 25,
[00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:32.160]   but you could go all the way up to 100,
[00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:35.020]   rest anywhere from 30 to 180 seconds,
[00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:38.380]   and then do your next set for a total of three to five sets.
[00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:40.700]   So it doesn't actually sound like a ton of work.
[00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:43.040]   The other thing you could do is something like a plank.
[00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:46.500]   A plank position is actually a way
[00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:51.500]   to build muscular endurance, not strength, okay?
[00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:53.660]   I'm sure it could be used to develop strength,
[00:42:53.660 --> 00:42:55.380]   but it's really about muscular endurance.
[00:42:55.380 --> 00:42:57.940]   So you would do three to five sets of planks.
[00:42:57.940 --> 00:42:59.420]   Those planks would probably,
[00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:00.820]   even because you're not doing repetitions,
[00:43:00.820 --> 00:43:02.540]   it's an isometric hold, as we say.
[00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:04.980]   It's kind of static hold or a wall sit
[00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:06.220]   would be another example.
[00:43:06.220 --> 00:43:10.060]   And you would do that probably for a minute or two minutes,
[00:43:10.060 --> 00:43:13.780]   take some rest of anywhere from 30 to 60 or 180 seconds,
[00:43:13.780 --> 00:43:14.980]   and then repeat.
[00:43:14.980 --> 00:43:19.700]   So things like pushing a sled, pushups, isometric planks,
[00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:23.420]   even pull-ups, those will all work.
[00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:26.940]   And as with other forms of training,
[00:43:26.940 --> 00:43:29.980]   you would want to do this until you approach failure
[00:43:29.980 --> 00:43:31.420]   or actually fail,
[00:43:31.420 --> 00:43:34.060]   and where you're unable to perform another repetition,
[00:43:34.060 --> 00:43:36.700]   that would mark the end of a set.
[00:43:36.700 --> 00:43:40.020]   The one critical feature of building muscular endurance
[00:43:40.020 --> 00:43:44.900]   is that it has no major eccentric loading component.
[00:43:44.900 --> 00:43:47.060]   Now, I haven't talked much
[00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:49.760]   about eccentric and concentric loading,
[00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:53.540]   but concentric loading is when you are shortening the muscle
[00:43:53.540 --> 00:43:56.020]   typically, or lifting a weight,
[00:43:56.020 --> 00:43:59.360]   and eccentric movements are when you are lengthening a muscle
[00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:01.640]   typically, or lowering a weight.
[00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:04.780]   So if you do a pull-up and you get your chin over the bar
[00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:08.180]   or a chin-up, that's the concentric portion of the effort.
[00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:11.460]   And then as you lower yourself, that's the eccentric portion.
[00:44:11.460 --> 00:44:15.220]   Eccentric portion of resistance training of any kind,
[00:44:15.220 --> 00:44:17.260]   whether or not it's for endurance or for strength,
[00:44:17.260 --> 00:44:20.160]   is one of the major causes of soreness.
[00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:25.120]   Some people will be more susceptible to this than others,
[00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:28.920]   but it does create more damage in muscle fibers.
[00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:31.800]   Muscular endurance and building muscular endurance
[00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:33.580]   should not include any movements
[00:44:33.580 --> 00:44:36.360]   that include major eccentric loads.
[00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:38.900]   So if you're going to do push-ups,
[00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:40.560]   it doesn't mean that you want to drop,
[00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:42.880]   smash your chest into the floor.
[00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:44.560]   And by the way, your chest should touch the ground
[00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:45.960]   on every push-up.
[00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:47.880]   That's a real push-up, okay?
[00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:49.660]   It's not about breaking 90 with the elbows.
[00:44:49.660 --> 00:44:52.180]   It's about pushing down till your chest touch the floor
[00:44:52.180 --> 00:44:53.020]   and straightening out.
[00:44:53.020 --> 00:44:54.320]   That's a proper push-up.
[00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:57.680]   And a pull-up is where you pull your chin above the bar.
[00:44:57.680 --> 00:45:00.660]   Neither of those should include a slow eccentric
[00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:03.680]   or lowering component if you are using those
[00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:05.020]   to train muscular endurance,
[00:45:05.020 --> 00:45:07.660]   the three to five sets of 12 to 25
[00:45:07.660 --> 00:45:09.740]   and maybe even up to 100 repetitions
[00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:14.040]   with 30 to 180 seconds of rest in between.
[00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:18.760]   That means that jumping also is going to be a very poor tool
[00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:21.480]   for building muscular endurance
[00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:25.420]   because jumping has a slowing down component as you land.
[00:45:25.420 --> 00:45:28.320]   So things like plyometrics or agility work
[00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:29.680]   where you're moving from side to side
[00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:30.760]   and you're decelerating,
[00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:32.480]   you're slowing yourself down a lot,
[00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:34.620]   not going to be good for muscular endurance.
[00:45:34.620 --> 00:45:37.000]   Terrific for cardiovascular training
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:38.280]   and conditioning of other kinds
[00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:40.640]   and skill training and agility and all that.
[00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:43.600]   But if you want to build muscular endurance,
[00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:45.200]   you want to make your muscles able
[00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:47.920]   to do more work for longer,
[00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:51.840]   it's going to be this three to five sets of 12 to 100 reps,
[00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:56.640]   30 to 180 seconds of mainly concentric movement.
[00:45:56.640 --> 00:46:01.640]   Not a slow lowering phase or a heavy lowering phase.
[00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:05.280]   So that might be kettlebell swings and things of that sort.
[00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:06.620]   Isometrics, as I mentioned,
[00:46:06.620 --> 00:46:08.920]   things like plank and wall sits will work.
[00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:11.000]   Now what's interesting about this
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:13.880]   is that it doesn't seem at all like what people
[00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:15.560]   normally think of as endurance.
[00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:17.880]   And yet it's been shown
[00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:20.040]   in nice quality peer-reviewed studies,
[00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:23.200]   several of which are cited in the review I mentioned earlier
[00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:27.640]   that muscular endurance can improve our ability
[00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:31.580]   to engage in long bouts of what we call long duration,
[00:46:31.580 --> 00:46:33.560]   low intensity endurance work.
[00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:35.580]   So this can support long runs.
[00:46:35.580 --> 00:46:40.040]   It can support long swims and it can build also,
[00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:45.040]   it can build postural strength and endurance simultaneously.
[00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:48.120]   And that's mainly accomplished through isometric hold.
[00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:51.720]   So things like planks are actually quite good
[00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:54.360]   for building endurance of the spinal erector muscles
[00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:57.520]   that provide posture of the abdominal muscles
[00:46:57.520 --> 00:47:00.220]   that are helpful for posture for being upright,
[00:47:00.220 --> 00:47:03.440]   for the upper neck muscles and things of that sort.
[00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:05.480]   These days, everyone seems to have text neck.
[00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:07.760]   Everyone's basically staring at their toes all the time.
[00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:09.560]   It has a default towards their toes.
[00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:11.560]   So isometric holds can be very good
[00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:13.760]   for building muscular endurance.
[00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:17.620]   You can spot people, including yourself, perhaps,
[00:47:17.620 --> 00:47:20.920]   with poor muscular endurance in the postural muscles
[00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:22.640]   because anytime they stop moving,
[00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:24.340]   they have to lean against a wall
[00:47:24.340 --> 00:47:26.560]   or their hip will move to one side
[00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:28.280]   or they're always leaned to one side.
[00:47:28.280 --> 00:47:29.860]   I am guilty of this too.
[00:47:29.860 --> 00:47:31.560]   Some of you have actually pointed out,
[00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:33.380]   I like to think out of concern,
[00:47:33.380 --> 00:47:36.240]   that I often am rubbing my lower back
[00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:39.000]   and indeed I have some asymmetries in my postural muscles,
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:40.400]   some of which are probably genetic
[00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:43.280]   and some of which are probably just from excessive work
[00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:44.480]   or something of that sort,
[00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:46.960]   that have my right shoulder sit lower than my left
[00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:47.960]   and things of that sort.
[00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:49.680]   If I wanted to improve those,
[00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:52.160]   I could improve those by really focusing on symmetry
[00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:55.240]   and isometric, symmetry meaning holding my hands
[00:47:55.240 --> 00:47:56.880]   at equivalent positions in planks
[00:47:56.880 --> 00:48:01.160]   and doing isometric holds for building muscular endurance
[00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:03.080]   of the postural muscles.
[00:48:03.080 --> 00:48:05.280]   But this can also be done with, as I mentioned,
[00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:06.760]   kettlebell swings for the lower back
[00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:08.520]   and legs and posterior chain.
[00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:09.840]   So there are a number of different exercises
[00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:10.680]   you could do this with,
[00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:14.200]   but it should be compound exercises mainly.
[00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:15.980]   It's rare for people to do
[00:48:15.980 --> 00:48:17.900]   this kind of muscular endurance work
[00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:21.600]   specifically for things like bicep curls or triceps.
[00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:23.960]   And there aren't many activities that really rely
[00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:26.960]   on isolation of those muscles repeatedly.
[00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:28.020]   I'm sure there are some out there,
[00:48:28.020 --> 00:48:30.180]   but it's kind of hard to imagine.
[00:48:30.180 --> 00:48:32.560]   So you can do this with isometrics,
[00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:34.840]   you can do this with more standard
[00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:36.160]   non-isometric type movements,
[00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:38.700]   but make sure there isn't a strong eccentric load.
[00:48:38.700 --> 00:48:40.520]   So now let's talk about the science briefly
[00:48:40.520 --> 00:48:42.460]   of why this works.
[00:48:42.460 --> 00:48:46.940]   Well, that takes us back to this issue of fuel utilization
[00:48:46.940 --> 00:48:48.640]   and what fails.
[00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:50.640]   So if we were to say, okay,
[00:48:50.640 --> 00:48:54.840]   let's say you do a plank and you're planking for,
[00:48:54.840 --> 00:48:56.340]   maybe you're able to plank for a minute
[00:48:56.340 --> 00:48:58.320]   or two minutes or three minutes.
[00:48:58.320 --> 00:48:59.980]   At some point you will fail.
[00:48:59.980 --> 00:49:02.300]   You're not going to fail because the heart gives out.
[00:49:02.300 --> 00:49:05.640]   You're not going to fail because you can't get enough oxygen
[00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:07.540]   because you can breathe while you're doing that.
[00:49:07.540 --> 00:49:10.160]   You're going to fail because of local muscular failure,
[00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:11.760]   which means that as you do,
[00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:15.220]   if you choose to do this protocol of three to five sets,
[00:49:15.220 --> 00:49:18.720]   et cetera, et cetera, to build muscular endurance,
[00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:21.720]   mainly what you are going to be building
[00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:24.240]   is you're going to be building the ability
[00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:27.400]   of your mitochondria to use oxygen
[00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:29.240]   to generate energy locally.
[00:49:29.240 --> 00:49:32.560]   And that it's something called mitochondrial respiration,
[00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:36.220]   respiration because of the involvement of oxygen.
[00:49:36.220 --> 00:49:41.160]   And it's also going to be increasing the extent
[00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:44.660]   to which the neurons control the muscles
[00:49:44.660 --> 00:49:48.320]   and provide a stimulus for the muscles to contract.
[00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:51.520]   But this is independent of power and strength, okay?
[00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:55.320]   So even though the low sets like three to five sets
[00:49:55.320 --> 00:49:57.300]   and the fact that you're doing repetitions
[00:49:57.300 --> 00:49:59.040]   and you're going to failure,
[00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:02.180]   even though it seems to resemble power and strength
[00:50:02.180 --> 00:50:04.980]   and hypertrophy type training, it is distinctly different.
[00:50:04.980 --> 00:50:08.240]   It's not going to generate strength, hypertrophy, and power.
[00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:11.640]   It's going to mainly create this ability to endure,
[00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:13.720]   to continually contract muscles
[00:50:13.720 --> 00:50:16.240]   or repeatedly contract muscles, okay?
[00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:18.400]   Continually, if you're using isometric holds,
[00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:20.160]   repeatedly, excuse me,
[00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:23.480]   if you're using repetition type exercise
[00:50:23.480 --> 00:50:27.680]   where there's a contraction and an extension of the muscle,
[00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:30.800]   essentially concentric and an eccentric portion.
[00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:33.100]   But remember that you want the eccentric portion
[00:50:33.100 --> 00:50:36.320]   to be light and relatively fast,
[00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:37.620]   not so fast that you injure yourself,
[00:50:37.620 --> 00:50:40.740]   but certainly not deliberately slowed down.
[00:50:40.740 --> 00:50:45.740]   It was recommended, I should say, by Andy Galpin
[00:50:45.740 --> 00:50:48.820]   that you not use Olympic lifts for this
[00:50:48.820 --> 00:50:53.020]   because once you get past eight or 12 or 25 repetitions,
[00:50:53.020 --> 00:50:55.640]   especially form on those Olympic lifts
[00:50:55.640 --> 00:50:57.960]   is key for not getting injured.
[00:50:57.960 --> 00:51:01.020]   And while some people can perform those sorts of lifts
[00:51:01.020 --> 00:51:03.760]   like snatches and deadlifts and cleans and jerks
[00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:07.520]   and overhead presses, probably not a great idea
[00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:11.180]   if the goal is to push the body to points of fatigue
[00:51:11.180 --> 00:51:12.920]   because you do open yourself up to injury
[00:51:12.920 --> 00:51:14.480]   unless you're very skilled at doing that
[00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:15.580]   or you have a really good coach
[00:51:15.580 --> 00:51:17.880]   who can help you guide through those lifts.
[00:51:17.880 --> 00:51:19.760]   So that's one form of endurance,
[00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:20.840]   which is muscular endurance,
[00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:24.180]   and it's mainly going to rely on neural energy,
[00:51:24.180 --> 00:51:26.880]   so nerves and muscle.
[00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:28.880]   And it's not going to rely quite so much
[00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:30.640]   on what's available in your blood,
[00:51:30.640 --> 00:51:32.600]   your heart, or your lungs.
[00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:35.640]   So now let's talk about the other extreme of endurance,
[00:51:35.640 --> 00:51:38.280]   which is long duration endurance.
[00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:41.160]   This is the type that people typically think about
[00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:42.960]   when they think about endurance.
[00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:46.600]   You're talking about a long run, a long swim,
[00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:47.920]   a long bike ride.
[00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:49.080]   Well, how long?
[00:51:49.080 --> 00:51:53.600]   Well, anywhere from 12 minutes to several hours
[00:51:53.600 --> 00:51:55.020]   or maybe even an entire day,
[00:51:55.020 --> 00:51:58.500]   maybe eight or nine hours of hiking or running or biking.
[00:51:58.500 --> 00:51:59.740]   Some people are actually doing those kinds
[00:51:59.740 --> 00:52:02.680]   of really long events, marathons, for instance.
[00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:05.400]   So anything longer than 12 minutes.
[00:52:05.400 --> 00:52:10.400]   And this type of work builds on fuel utilization
[00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:12.360]   in the muscles.
[00:52:12.360 --> 00:52:15.700]   It builds on the activity of neurons in the brain
[00:52:15.700 --> 00:52:18.720]   that are involved in what we call central pattern generators.
[00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:21.120]   We talked about this in a previous episode
[00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:22.520]   or several previous episodes.
[00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:24.740]   These are groups of neurons that allow our body
[00:52:24.740 --> 00:52:27.320]   to engage in regular rhythmic effort
[00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:29.700]   without having to think about the movement too much.
[00:52:29.700 --> 00:52:31.740]   So running and stepping or swimming,
[00:52:31.740 --> 00:52:34.400]   if you already know how to swim or pedaling on a bike
[00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:36.000]   or walking up stairs and hiking,
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:38.760]   you're not thinking about right, left, right, left.
[00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:42.100]   It's all carried out by central pattern generators.
[00:52:42.100 --> 00:52:45.440]   This is going to be at less than 100%
[00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:48.760]   of your maximum oxygen uptake, your VO2 max.
[00:52:48.760 --> 00:52:50.520]   I'll talk about what VO2 max is,
[00:52:50.520 --> 00:52:52.700]   but I just want to give a sense of what the protocol is
[00:52:52.700 --> 00:52:54.760]   and the underlying science.
[00:52:54.760 --> 00:52:56.600]   How many sets?
[00:52:56.600 --> 00:52:57.480]   One.
[00:52:57.480 --> 00:53:02.480]   Long duration effort is one set of 12 minutes or longer.
[00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:04.160]   So you're not counting repetitions.
[00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:06.320]   I sure hope that if you're going out on a 30 minute run
[00:53:06.320 --> 00:53:10.140]   or even a 15 minute run, that you're not counting steps,
[00:53:10.140 --> 00:53:11.760]   that you're not counting pedal strokes,
[00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:15.660]   that you're not on the rower counting pulls on the rower.
[00:53:15.660 --> 00:53:16.640]   I suppose you could,
[00:53:16.640 --> 00:53:18.800]   but I think that would be pretty dreadful.
[00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:22.460]   Seems like a poor utilization of cognitive brain space.
[00:53:22.460 --> 00:53:25.920]   You're getting into regular repeated effort
[00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:29.680]   and your ability to continue that effort
[00:53:29.680 --> 00:53:31.800]   is going to be dependent mainly
[00:53:31.800 --> 00:53:34.040]   on the efficiency of the movement,
[00:53:34.040 --> 00:53:36.480]   on your ability to strike a balance
[00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:40.020]   between the movement itself,
[00:53:40.020 --> 00:53:43.740]   the generation of the muscular movements that are required
[00:53:43.740 --> 00:53:47.900]   and fuel utilization across the different sources
[00:53:47.900 --> 00:53:50.240]   of nerve, muscle, blood, heart, and lungs.
[00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:51.160]   So let's ask the question,
[00:53:51.160 --> 00:53:53.120]   why would you fail on a long run?
[00:53:53.120 --> 00:53:54.500]   Why would you quit?
[00:53:54.500 --> 00:53:57.100]   Well, as you set out on that long run,
[00:53:57.100 --> 00:53:58.860]   assuming you have some glycogen in your liver
[00:53:58.860 --> 00:54:01.360]   and in your muscles, you're going to use that energy first,
[00:54:01.360 --> 00:54:03.200]   even if it's very low intensity.
[00:54:03.200 --> 00:54:04.420]   Okay, so we're not talking about sprinting,
[00:54:04.420 --> 00:54:06.760]   we're talking about heading out the door
[00:54:06.760 --> 00:54:09.280]   or starting off on a marathon.
[00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:11.340]   You're starting to, assuming you have some conditioning
[00:54:11.340 --> 00:54:13.600]   or even if you don't, you're going to burn carbohydrate.
[00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:15.280]   You're going to burn glucose in the bloodstream.
[00:54:15.280 --> 00:54:16.520]   You're going to burn carbohydrate
[00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:17.680]   as those muscles contract,
[00:54:17.680 --> 00:54:19.060]   those what we call slow twitch muscles.
[00:54:19.060 --> 00:54:21.360]   They're contracting, they start burning up fuel
[00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:23.920]   to make ATP to continue to contract.
[00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:29.400]   Your mind is going to use more or less energy
[00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:32.000]   depending on how much willpower,
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:34.600]   how much of a fight you have to get into with yourself
[00:54:34.600 --> 00:54:36.120]   in order to generate the effort.
[00:54:36.120 --> 00:54:37.720]   I really want to underscore this.
[00:54:37.720 --> 00:54:38.800]   If you're somebody that's thinking,
[00:54:38.800 --> 00:54:40.600]   maybe I go for the run, maybe I don't go for the run
[00:54:40.600 --> 00:54:42.280]   and I'll do it at two o'clock, okay, 2.05.
[00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:43.920]   No, I only want to go on the half hour
[00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:45.040]   or maybe on the main hour.
[00:54:45.040 --> 00:54:47.100]   And you're going through all that, guess what?
[00:54:47.100 --> 00:54:50.840]   You're burning up useful energy that you could use
[00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:55.020]   either for the run, for example, or for something else.
[00:54:55.020 --> 00:54:58.260]   When we think about something hard, when we ruminate,
[00:54:58.260 --> 00:55:02.800]   when we perseverate on an idea or on a decision,
[00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:06.920]   we are burning neural energy and neural energy is glucose
[00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:10.440]   and epinephrine and all the things we talked about before.
[00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:15.440]   So willpower in part is the ability to devote resources
[00:55:16.720 --> 00:55:19.440]   to things and part of that is making decisions
[00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:21.400]   to just either do it or not do it.
[00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:23.380]   I'm not of the just do it mindset.
[00:55:23.380 --> 00:55:25.720]   I think there's a right time and a place to train,
[00:55:25.720 --> 00:55:29.140]   but I also think that it is not good.
[00:55:29.140 --> 00:55:32.400]   In other words, it utilizes excessive resources
[00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:35.420]   to churn over decisions excessively.
[00:55:35.420 --> 00:55:39.280]   And you probably burn as much cognitive energy
[00:55:39.280 --> 00:55:42.140]   deciding about whether or not to do a given training or not
[00:55:42.140 --> 00:55:45.620]   as you do in the actual training, okay?
[00:55:45.620 --> 00:55:47.980]   So we'll talk more about how this long duration effort
[00:55:47.980 --> 00:55:49.700]   can relate to mental performance,
[00:55:49.700 --> 00:55:52.180]   but the long duration effort should be one set,
[00:55:52.180 --> 00:55:53.600]   12 minutes or longer.
[00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:56.620]   It could go for 30 minutes or 60 minutes or an hour.
[00:55:56.620 --> 00:55:59.080]   We'll talk about programming later in the episode.
[00:55:59.080 --> 00:56:00.720]   This is going to be less than 100%
[00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:03.460]   of your maximum oxygen uptake.
[00:56:03.460 --> 00:56:05.360]   Your heart rate is not going to be through the ceiling
[00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:09.560]   or maxed out, but it's all about efficiency of movement.
[00:56:09.560 --> 00:56:11.000]   That's what you're building.
[00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:12.920]   When you go out for a run that's 30 minutes,
[00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:17.920]   you are building the capacity to repeat that performance
[00:56:17.920 --> 00:56:20.880]   the next time while being more efficient,
[00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:23.360]   actually burning less fuel.
[00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:25.740]   And that might seem a little bit counterintuitive,
[00:56:25.740 --> 00:56:28.360]   but every time you do that run,
[00:56:28.360 --> 00:56:30.240]   what you're doing is you're building up
[00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:32.080]   mitochondrial density.
[00:56:32.080 --> 00:56:35.500]   It's not so much about mitochondrial oxidation
[00:56:35.500 --> 00:56:36.880]   and respiration.
[00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:39.240]   You're building up mitochondrial density.
[00:56:39.240 --> 00:56:41.920]   You're actually increasing the amount of ATP
[00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:45.140]   that you can create for a given bout of effort.
[00:56:45.140 --> 00:56:47.760]   You're becoming more efficient, okay?
[00:56:47.760 --> 00:56:51.960]   You're burning less fuel overall, doing the same thing.
[00:56:51.960 --> 00:56:54.080]   That's really what these long slow distance
[00:56:54.080 --> 00:56:56.580]   or long bouts of effort are really all about.
[00:56:56.580 --> 00:56:58.620]   Now, why do this long duration effort?
[00:56:58.620 --> 00:56:59.800]   Why would you want to do it?
[00:56:59.800 --> 00:57:00.820]   Why is it good for you?
[00:57:00.820 --> 00:57:04.500]   Well, it does something very important,
[00:57:04.500 --> 00:57:08.440]   which is that it builds the capillary beds within muscles.
[00:57:08.440 --> 00:57:10.280]   So let's talk a little bit about vasculature.
[00:57:10.280 --> 00:57:13.040]   We haven't done this too much yet,
[00:57:13.040 --> 00:57:15.540]   but if you have seen the episode
[00:57:15.540 --> 00:57:16.900]   on supercharging performance,
[00:57:16.900 --> 00:57:21.560]   we talked about AVAs, these arteriovenous ostomoses,
[00:57:21.560 --> 00:57:26.560]   where blood moves from arteries directly into veins,
[00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:28.660]   but that's unusual.
[00:57:28.660 --> 00:57:33.160]   That only takes place in the so-called glabrous skin
[00:57:33.160 --> 00:57:36.520]   of the palms, the face, and the bottoms of the feet.
[00:57:36.520 --> 00:57:40.560]   Typically, for most all other areas of the body,
[00:57:40.560 --> 00:57:44.280]   what happens is arteries bring blood
[00:57:44.280 --> 00:57:46.440]   to a given tissue, like a muscle,
[00:57:46.440 --> 00:57:50.720]   and veins return that blood back to the heart.
[00:57:50.720 --> 00:57:52.520]   There are exceptions, but in general.
[00:57:52.520 --> 00:57:56.060]   And in between arteries and veins are these little tiny,
[00:57:56.060 --> 00:57:58.760]   what are called capillary beds or microcapillaries.
[00:57:58.760 --> 00:58:00.600]   So these are tiny little avenues,
[00:58:00.600 --> 00:58:02.880]   like little tiny streams and estuaries
[00:58:02.880 --> 00:58:05.440]   between the bigger arteries and veins.
[00:58:05.440 --> 00:58:10.160]   Now, those are actually contained within muscle,
[00:58:10.160 --> 00:58:12.600]   and what's amazing is that you can increase
[00:58:12.600 --> 00:58:13.720]   the number of them.
[00:58:13.720 --> 00:58:15.680]   You can literally build new capillaries.
[00:58:15.680 --> 00:58:19.560]   You can create new little streams within your muscles.
[00:58:19.560 --> 00:58:21.840]   And the type of long-duration effort
[00:58:21.840 --> 00:58:23.080]   that I was talking about before,
[00:58:23.080 --> 00:58:26.040]   12 minutes or more of steady effort,
[00:58:26.040 --> 00:58:29.160]   is very useful for doing that,
[00:58:29.160 --> 00:58:32.720]   and is very useful for increasing the mitochondria,
[00:58:32.720 --> 00:58:35.720]   the energy-producing elements of the cells,
[00:58:35.720 --> 00:58:37.880]   the actual muscle cells.
[00:58:37.880 --> 00:58:42.880]   And the reason is when blood arrives to muscles,
[00:58:42.880 --> 00:58:44.520]   it has oxygen.
[00:58:44.520 --> 00:58:46.560]   The muscles are going to use some of that oxygen,
[00:58:46.560 --> 00:58:48.480]   and then some of the deoxygenated blood
[00:58:48.480 --> 00:58:51.880]   is going to be sent back to the heart and to the lungs.
[00:58:51.880 --> 00:58:55.960]   Now, the more capillaries that you build into those muscles,
[00:58:55.960 --> 00:58:59.800]   the more oxygen available to those muscles.
[00:58:59.800 --> 00:59:02.960]   I don't want to get too much into the physics of fluid flow,
[00:59:02.960 --> 00:59:05.760]   but basically it's the difference between taking a hose
[00:59:05.760 --> 00:59:09.600]   and sticking it into some dirt just directly,
[00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:12.500]   and turning on the faucet at a given rate,
[00:59:12.500 --> 00:59:16.040]   the spigot, rather, or having a bunch of little hoses,
[00:59:16.040 --> 00:59:17.120]   like a sprinkler system,
[00:59:17.120 --> 00:59:19.260]   that go out and irrigate the whole yard.
[00:59:19.260 --> 00:59:22.640]   The irrigation is equivalent to this capillary bed system,
[00:59:22.640 --> 00:59:27.420]   and it's very good at using energy sources within blood.
[00:59:27.420 --> 00:59:29.820]   So the simple way to think about this is
[00:59:29.820 --> 00:59:31.080]   when you go out for a run,
[00:59:31.080 --> 00:59:32.760]   let's say it's the first run you've done for a while,
[00:59:32.760 --> 00:59:34.660]   and you go out for 12 or 15 minutes,
[00:59:34.660 --> 00:59:36.920]   and somewhere right around 20 minutes, you're like,
[00:59:36.920 --> 00:59:38.960]   "That's it, I just can't continue."
[00:59:38.960 --> 00:59:42.140]   Well, when you come back the next time to do that run,
[00:59:42.140 --> 00:59:44.440]   you've built endurance,
[00:59:44.440 --> 00:59:48.220]   largely because you've built these capillary beds.
[00:59:48.220 --> 00:59:50.260]   You've expanded these little streams
[00:59:50.260 --> 00:59:52.920]   in which blood can deliver oxygen to the muscles.
[00:59:52.920 --> 00:59:55.680]   And so it's going to feel relatively straightforward
[00:59:55.680 --> 00:59:58.800]   to either go a little bit quicker for the same duration,
[00:59:58.800 --> 00:59:59.960]   the same distance,
[00:59:59.960 --> 01:00:04.220]   or to extend that run for another five to 10 minutes.
[01:00:04.220 --> 01:00:07.480]   So this long duration work, unlike muscular endurance,
[01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:10.580]   like planks and everything that we were talking about before
[01:00:10.580 --> 01:00:13.300]   is really about building the capillary systems
[01:00:13.300 --> 01:00:16.660]   and the mitochondria, the energy utilization systems,
[01:00:16.660 --> 01:00:18.920]   within the muscles themselves.
[01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:21.180]   And that's very important to understand.
[01:00:21.180 --> 01:00:23.080]   It's distinctly different than, say,
[01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:25.220]   building the neurons that fire the muscles.
[01:00:25.220 --> 01:00:26.480]   The neurons are already there.
[01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:28.420]   They're going to fire those muscles just fine.
[01:00:28.420 --> 01:00:30.640]   In fact, if your life depended on it today,
[01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:32.340]   you could probably run a marathon.
[01:00:32.340 --> 01:00:33.380]   You'd probably get injured.
[01:00:33.380 --> 01:00:35.560]   It would be very psychologically and physically painful.
[01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:37.960]   I don't recommend you do that unless you're trained for it.
[01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:39.900]   But if you were to train properly for it,
[01:00:39.900 --> 01:00:42.620]   if you were to do long duration bouts of effort
[01:00:42.620 --> 01:00:44.960]   once or twice a week or three times a week,
[01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:46.420]   pretty soon it would become easy
[01:00:46.420 --> 01:00:49.080]   because you're building these vascular microbeds
[01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:51.800]   or microvascular beds, as they're called, okay?
[01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:54.660]   So you're able to bring more energy to the muscles,
[01:00:54.660 --> 01:00:56.940]   and they're able to utilize more energy.
[01:00:56.940 --> 01:00:58.600]   So that's long duration.
[01:00:58.600 --> 01:00:59.660]   So we've got muscular endurance
[01:00:59.660 --> 01:01:01.380]   and we've got long duration endurance.
[01:01:01.380 --> 01:01:04.340]   And then there are two kinds in between
[01:01:04.340 --> 01:01:07.460]   that in recent years have gotten a lot of attention
[01:01:07.460 --> 01:01:10.240]   and excitement, but most people are not distinguishing
[01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:13.660]   between these two kinds of endurance.
[01:01:13.660 --> 01:01:17.020]   And that's a shame because in failing to distinguish
[01:01:17.020 --> 01:01:18.500]   between the two kinds of what we call
[01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:20.220]   high intensity training,
[01:01:20.220 --> 01:01:23.260]   sometimes called high intensity interval training,
[01:01:23.260 --> 01:01:25.340]   most people, perhaps you,
[01:01:25.340 --> 01:01:29.740]   are not getting nearly as much physical and mental benefit
[01:01:29.740 --> 01:01:32.100]   out of high intensity training as you could.
[01:01:32.100 --> 01:01:33.700]   So I want to talk about the two kinds
[01:01:33.700 --> 01:01:36.020]   of high intensity interval training
[01:01:36.020 --> 01:01:38.840]   and what each of them does for your brain and body
[01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:41.520]   and what sorts of adaptations they cause.
[01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:44.220]   Because in doing that, you can really start
[01:01:44.220 --> 01:01:48.020]   to build up specific energy systems in your brain and body
[01:01:48.020 --> 01:01:52.540]   in ways that best serve you for your cognitive work
[01:01:52.540 --> 01:01:55.860]   and for other sorts of things like strength and speed
[01:01:55.860 --> 01:01:59.580]   or hypertrophy or for running marathons for that matter.
[01:01:59.580 --> 01:02:02.660]   So there are two kinds of high intensity training
[01:02:02.660 --> 01:02:03.580]   for endurance,
[01:02:03.580 --> 01:02:06.200]   sometimes called high intensity interval training.
[01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:11.380]   One is anaerobic, so-called anaerobic endurance,
[01:02:11.380 --> 01:02:14.620]   so no oxygen, and the other is aerobic endurance,
[01:02:14.620 --> 01:02:17.840]   both of which qualify as HIIT,
[01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:19.100]   high intensity interval training.
[01:02:19.100 --> 01:02:21.760]   So let's talk about anaerobic endurance first.
[01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:26.600]   Anaerobic endurance, from a protocol perspective,
[01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:31.600]   is going to be three to 12 sets, okay?
[01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:34.680]   And these repetitions,
[01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:37.120]   and I'll talk about what the repetitions are,
[01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:41.000]   are going to be performed at whatever speed allows you
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:44.680]   to complete the work in good, safe form, okay?
[01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:46.520]   So it could be fast, could be slow.
[01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:50.440]   As the work continues, your repetitions may slow down
[01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:52.960]   or it may speed up, chances are it's going to slow down.
[01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:54.740]   So what does this work?
[01:02:54.740 --> 01:02:56.160]   What do these sets look like?
[01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:59.020]   Remember, long, slow distance is one set.
[01:02:59.020 --> 01:03:01.000]   Muscular endurance is three to five sets.
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:04.420]   High intensity anaerobic endurance is going to be somewhere
[01:03:04.420 --> 01:03:07.260]   between three and 12 sets.
[01:03:07.260 --> 01:03:11.540]   And it's going to have a ratio of work to rest
[01:03:11.540 --> 01:03:16.480]   of anywhere from three to one to one to five, okay?
[01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:20.840]   So what would a three to one ratio set look like?
[01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:24.160]   Well, it's going to be 30 seconds of hard pedaling
[01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:28.640]   on the bike, for instance, or running or on the rower.
[01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:29.800]   These are just examples.
[01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:31.240]   It could be in the pool swimming.
[01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:33.320]   It could be any number of things or air squats
[01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:35.760]   or weighted squats, if you will,
[01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:38.480]   provided you can manage that.
[01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:41.400]   30 seconds on, 10 seconds off.
[01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:43.200]   That's a very brief rest.
[01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:45.360]   So three to one is just a good example
[01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:47.440]   would be 30 seconds on, 10 seconds off.
[01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:52.440]   The opposite extreme on that ratio would be one to five,
[01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:55.320]   so 20 seconds on, 100 seconds off.
[01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:57.440]   So you do the work for 20 seconds,
[01:03:57.440 --> 01:03:59.240]   then you rest 100 seconds.
[01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:01.200]   Now, what's the difference?
[01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:03.620]   Should you do three to one ratio,
[01:04:03.620 --> 01:04:05.960]   so 30 seconds on, 10 seconds off?
[01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:08.000]   Or should you do one to five,
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.240]   20 seconds on to 100 seconds off?
[01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:13.200]   Well, that will depend on whether or not
[01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:16.680]   the quality of the movement is important to you.
[01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:19.240]   So let's just take a look at the three to one ratio.
[01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:21.520]   So in the three to one ratio,
[01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:25.140]   if you're going to do 30 seconds of hard pedaling on a bike
[01:04:25.140 --> 01:04:26.200]   followed by 10 seconds,
[01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:28.600]   so maybe one of these, what they call assault bikes,
[01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:31.080]   and then you stop for 10 seconds and then repeat,
[01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:36.080]   chances are you will be able to do one, two, three, four,
[01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:39.160]   maybe even as many as 12 sets
[01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:41.240]   if you're really in good condition,
[01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:42.440]   that you'll be able to do all those
[01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:45.480]   because pedaling on the bike doesn't require a ton of skill.
[01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:47.920]   And if you do it incorrectly,
[01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:49.800]   if your elbow flares out a little bit or something,
[01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:51.520]   it's very unlikely that you'll get injured
[01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:54.120]   unless it's really extreme, okay?
[01:04:54.120 --> 01:04:57.200]   But the same movement done, for instance, with kettlebells,
[01:04:57.200 --> 01:04:59.360]   so 30 seconds on, 10 seconds off,
[01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:02.160]   the first set will probably be in good form.
[01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:03.900]   The second one will be in pretty good form.
[01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:05.640]   But let's say you're getting to the fifth and sixth set
[01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:07.740]   and you're going 30 seconds on, 10 seconds off,
[01:05:07.740 --> 01:05:10.560]   chances are the quality of your repetitions
[01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:11.900]   will degrade significantly
[01:05:11.900 --> 01:05:13.220]   and you increase the probability
[01:05:13.220 --> 01:05:15.020]   that you're going to get injured
[01:05:15.020 --> 01:05:18.040]   or that you're going to damage yourself in some way
[01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:20.060]   or that you can't complete the movement
[01:05:20.060 --> 01:05:21.460]   or that some smaller muscles
[01:05:21.460 --> 01:05:24.040]   like your grip muscles might give out, okay?
[01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:28.380]   So the quality of repetitions is going to drop considerably
[01:05:28.380 --> 01:05:30.040]   with the three to one approach.
[01:05:30.040 --> 01:05:32.600]   If you're just doing it for effort,
[01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:34.640]   and we'll talk about what this builds in your system
[01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:36.240]   in a moment, that's fine.
[01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:41.240]   But for most people, if quality of form is important,
[01:05:41.300 --> 01:05:44.640]   so maybe this is using weights, maybe you're doing squats,
[01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:45.860]   so you're going to do 20 seconds on
[01:05:45.860 --> 01:05:47.540]   and 100 seconds of rest.
[01:05:47.540 --> 01:05:49.280]   Maybe it's even a barbell-loaded squat.
[01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:50.800]   Maybe you're doing kettlebells.
[01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:53.920]   Maybe you've got some other resistance there
[01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:55.680]   that's allowing you to do this.
[01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:57.580]   What you'll find is that the longer rest,
[01:05:57.580 --> 01:06:00.280]   even though it's 20 seconds of intense effort
[01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:02.440]   followed by a longer rest of about 100 seconds
[01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:05.540]   will allow you to perform more quality repetitions
[01:06:05.540 --> 01:06:07.760]   safely over time.
[01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:12.760]   So what does building anaerobic endurance look like?
[01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:15.340]   And then I'll tell you what it's actually good for
[01:06:15.340 --> 01:06:17.680]   in the true practical sense.
[01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:22.420]   What anaerobic endurance exercise generally looks like
[01:06:22.420 --> 01:06:25.100]   is that if you decide to do this for the first week,
[01:06:25.100 --> 01:06:27.100]   you might do this two or three times a week,
[01:06:27.100 --> 01:06:28.580]   maybe even just once a week,
[01:06:28.580 --> 01:06:29.860]   depending on the other things you're doing.
[01:06:29.860 --> 01:06:31.820]   We'll talk about programming at the end.
[01:06:31.820 --> 01:06:34.080]   And you would generate just three sets.
[01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:37.460]   So it might be three sets of 20 seconds of hard effort
[01:06:37.460 --> 01:06:39.380]   followed by 100 seconds rest.
[01:06:39.380 --> 01:06:40.960]   Then you repeat 20 seconds of hard effort,
[01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:44.260]   100 seconds rest, 20 seconds of effort, 100 seconds rest.
[01:06:44.260 --> 01:06:46.300]   And you might do that twice a week.
[01:06:46.300 --> 01:06:49.660]   And then each week you're adding one or two sets.
[01:06:49.660 --> 01:06:51.800]   In doing that,
[01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:54.780]   you will build up what we call anaerobic endurance.
[01:06:54.780 --> 01:06:56.780]   What is anaerobic endurance?
[01:06:56.780 --> 01:06:59.340]   Well, let's ask why we fail.
[01:06:59.340 --> 01:07:03.880]   Anaerobic endurance is going to be taking your system
[01:07:03.880 --> 01:07:08.420]   into greater than 100% of your VO2 max.
[01:07:08.420 --> 01:07:11.360]   It's going to be taking your heart rate up very high
[01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:17.340]   and it's going to maximize your oxygen utilization systems.
[01:07:17.340 --> 01:07:22.420]   That is going to have effects that are going to lead
[01:07:22.420 --> 01:07:24.640]   to fatigue at some point in the workout.
[01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:27.200]   And that fatigue will trigger an adaptation.
[01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:30.300]   So let's ask what adaptation it's triggering.
[01:07:30.300 --> 01:07:35.080]   Well, it's triggering both mitochondrial respiration,
[01:07:35.080 --> 01:07:38.200]   the ability of your mitochondria to generate more energy
[01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:40.800]   by using more oxygen because you're bringing so much,
[01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:41.860]   you're maxing out,
[01:07:41.860 --> 01:07:44.200]   literally you're getting above your VO2 max.
[01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:46.640]   You're hitting that threshold of how much oxygen
[01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:48.000]   you can use in your system.
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.680]   One of the adaptations will be that your mitochondria
[01:07:50.680 --> 01:07:55.340]   will shift such that they can use more oxygen.
[01:07:55.340 --> 01:08:00.040]   And you're going to also increase the capillary beds,
[01:08:00.040 --> 01:08:02.900]   but not as much as you're going to be able
[01:08:02.900 --> 01:08:07.580]   to increase the amount of neuron engagement of muscle.
[01:08:07.580 --> 01:08:09.980]   So normally when we start to hit fatigue,
[01:08:09.980 --> 01:08:12.760]   when we're exhausted, when we're breathing really hard,
[01:08:12.760 --> 01:08:14.380]   because the systems of the body are linked
[01:08:14.380 --> 01:08:16.460]   and there's a mental component to this as well,
[01:08:16.460 --> 01:08:18.800]   a kind of motivational component,
[01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:21.240]   after that third or fourth or sixth set
[01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:23.580]   of 20 seconds on, 100 seconds off,
[01:08:23.580 --> 01:08:24.640]   or if you're at the other extreme,
[01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:26.780]   30 seconds on and 10 seconds off,
[01:08:26.780 --> 01:08:29.840]   there's going to be a component of you want to stop
[01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:32.940]   and by pushing through and repeating another set safely,
[01:08:32.940 --> 01:08:37.420]   of course, what you're doing is you're training the neurons
[01:08:37.420 --> 01:08:40.540]   to be able to access more energy,
[01:08:40.540 --> 01:08:42.480]   literally convert that into ATP
[01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:45.920]   and for the muscles therefore to access more energy in ATP.
[01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:49.480]   And the adaptation is in the mitochondria's ability
[01:08:49.480 --> 01:08:50.920]   to use oxygen.
[01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:53.480]   And this has tremendous carry over effects
[01:08:53.480 --> 01:08:55.720]   for other types of exercise.
[01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:58.280]   So while I know and appreciate that people
[01:08:58.280 --> 01:09:00.840]   are using high intensity interval training of this kind
[01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:04.900]   or similar in order to just like burn fat,
[01:09:04.900 --> 01:09:06.600]   do their workouts, quote unquote,
[01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:11.020]   it's very useful for building a capacity
[01:09:11.020 --> 01:09:14.540]   to engage in short bouts of effort repeatedly,
[01:09:14.540 --> 01:09:17.440]   to really lock in, I don't want to use the word focus
[01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:18.960]   because it's not strictly mental focus,
[01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:23.960]   but to be able to generate short bouts of very intense work.
[01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:27.520]   This can be beneficial in competitive sports or team sports
[01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:28.840]   where there's a sprinting component,
[01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:30.720]   where the field opens up and you need to dribble the ball
[01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:33.000]   down the field, for instance, and shoot on goal,
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.640]   or where you're playing tennis and it's a long rally
[01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:38.560]   and then all of a sudden somebody really starts,
[01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:40.180]   you know, putting you back on your heels
[01:09:40.180 --> 01:09:42.880]   and you have to really make the maximum amount of effort
[01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:45.400]   to run to the net and to get the ball across the net,
[01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:48.200]   things of that sort, okay?
[01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:50.280]   There are a variety of places where there's carry over
[01:09:50.280 --> 01:09:53.720]   from this type of training, but it does support endurance.
[01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:55.120]   It's about muscle endurance.
[01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:58.820]   It's about these muscles ability to generate a lot of force
[01:09:58.820 --> 01:10:01.200]   in the short term, but repeatedly, okay?
[01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:03.040]   So that's the way to conceptualize this.
[01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:05.520]   And it is different than maximum power,
[01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:07.640]   even though it feels like maximum effort,
[01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:10.880]   it is not the same as building power and speed into muscles.
[01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:13.220]   Those are distinctly different protocols.
[01:10:13.220 --> 01:10:15.440]   So the key elements again,
[01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:18.280]   are that you're bringing your breathing
[01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:22.280]   and your oxygen utilization way up above your max.
[01:10:22.280 --> 01:10:24.460]   It's not quite hitting failure,
[01:10:24.460 --> 01:10:26.680]   but you're really pushing the system
[01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:29.760]   to the point where you are not ready to do another set
[01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:31.280]   and yet you begin another set.
[01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:33.800]   You're not necessarily psychologically ready.
[01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:35.620]   I'll talk more about some of the adaptations
[01:10:35.620 --> 01:10:39.000]   that this causes in terms of stroke volume in a few minutes.
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:42.140]   When we talk about how it is that work of this sort
[01:10:42.140 --> 01:10:45.740]   can increase our heart's ability to deliver blood and oxygen
[01:10:45.740 --> 01:10:47.160]   to our lungs and other tissues.
[01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:50.060]   I'm going to get very specific about how to breathe
[01:10:50.060 --> 01:10:51.840]   during these different types of protocols
[01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:53.360]   and what's happening at the level of the heart,
[01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:55.820]   but I want to make sure I touch on the fourth protocol,
[01:10:55.820 --> 01:10:59.080]   which is high-intensity aerobic conditioning.
[01:10:59.080 --> 01:11:02.160]   So HIIT has these two forms, anaerobic and aerobic,
[01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:04.880]   and you just heard about anaerobic.
[01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:07.360]   High-intensity aerobic conditioning
[01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:10.100]   also involves about three to 12 sets,
[01:11:10.100 --> 01:11:13.580]   starting off of course with fewer sets
[01:11:13.580 --> 01:11:14.780]   as you're getting into this training
[01:11:14.780 --> 01:11:17.040]   and then extending into more sets
[01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:19.420]   as one parameter you could expand,
[01:11:19.420 --> 01:11:22.400]   has again the same ratio of three to one,
[01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:24.920]   so 30 seconds on, 10 seconds off, or one to five,
[01:11:24.920 --> 01:11:26.720]   20 seconds on, 100 seconds off,
[01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:30.080]   or a very powerful tool for building up aerobic conditioning
[01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:32.820]   is a one-to-one ratio.
[01:11:32.820 --> 01:11:37.820]   A one-to-one ratio is powerful for building on average
[01:11:37.820 --> 01:11:42.000]   most of the energy systems involving,
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:46.240]   remember we had these nerve, muscle, blood, heart, and lungs.
[01:11:46.240 --> 01:11:50.800]   A one-to-one ratio might be you run a mile
[01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:52.880]   and however long that takes, let's say it takes you
[01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:54.240]   six minutes or seven minutes,
[01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:56.660]   then you rest for an equivalent amount of time,
[01:11:56.660 --> 01:12:00.300]   then you repeat and then you rest
[01:12:00.300 --> 01:12:01.400]   for an equivalent amount of time.
[01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:04.360]   So you might run first miles, let's say seven minutes,
[01:12:04.360 --> 01:12:06.480]   then you rest for seven minutes, then you run a mile again,
[01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:08.440]   and it might take eight minutes
[01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:09.360]   and you rest for eight minutes.
[01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:13.200]   And you continue that for a total of four miles of work,
[01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:16.440]   for four miles of running work, I should say,
[01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:17.880]   or seven miles of work.
[01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:19.020]   You can build this up.
[01:12:19.020 --> 01:12:22.540]   Many people find that using this type of training
[01:12:22.540 --> 01:12:26.100]   allows them to do things like go run half marathons
[01:12:26.100 --> 01:12:29.560]   and marathons, even though prior to the race date,
[01:12:29.560 --> 01:12:32.720]   they've never actually run a half marathon or marathon.
[01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:34.760]   Now that might seem incredible.
[01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:37.280]   It's like, how could it be that running a mile on
[01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:39.600]   and then resting for, running a mile
[01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:41.500]   and then resting for an equivalent amount of time,
[01:12:41.500 --> 01:12:43.620]   running a mile, resting for equivalent amount of time
[01:12:43.620 --> 01:12:46.900]   for seven miles allows you to run continuously
[01:12:46.900 --> 01:12:50.400]   for 13 miles or for 26 miles.
[01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:52.200]   Well, I'm not discouraging people
[01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:54.660]   from ever doing the long duration endurance.
[01:12:54.660 --> 01:12:56.420]   I think that is very important,
[01:12:56.420 --> 01:12:58.840]   but it's because it builds up
[01:12:58.840 --> 01:13:01.760]   so many of these energy utilization systems.
[01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:04.620]   It really teaches you to engage, excuse me,
[01:13:04.620 --> 01:13:06.780]   the nerve to muscle firing.
[01:13:06.780 --> 01:13:11.780]   It improves ATP and mitochondrial function in muscle.
[01:13:11.780 --> 01:13:15.360]   It allows the blood to deliver more oxygen
[01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:17.900]   to the muscle and to your brain.
[01:13:17.900 --> 01:13:19.820]   And I'll explain how that is.
[01:13:19.820 --> 01:13:24.420]   And it allows your heart to deliver more oxygen overall.
[01:13:24.420 --> 01:13:26.620]   And it builds a tremendous lung capacity.
[01:13:26.620 --> 01:13:28.520]   And we will talk about exactly how to breathe
[01:13:28.520 --> 01:13:30.380]   and how to build lung capacity,
[01:13:30.380 --> 01:13:32.680]   both for sake of warming up and for performance.
[01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:35.920]   So what would this look like and when should you do this?
[01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:39.500]   Well, it's really a question for these workouts
[01:13:39.500 --> 01:13:43.820]   of asking how much work can one do in eight to 12 minutes?
[01:13:43.820 --> 01:13:45.540]   And then rest and then repeat.
[01:13:45.540 --> 01:13:47.260]   How much work can you do for eight to 12 minutes,
[01:13:47.260 --> 01:13:48.200]   then rest and then repeat?
[01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:50.120]   And how many times should you do this?
[01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:53.060]   Well, this is the sort of thing, it's pretty intense.
[01:13:53.060 --> 01:13:55.360]   And so you would probably only want to do this
[01:13:55.360 --> 01:13:57.240]   two, maybe three times a week
[01:13:57.240 --> 01:13:58.780]   if you're not doing many other things.
[01:13:58.780 --> 01:14:00.380]   I will talk about how this program
[01:14:00.380 --> 01:14:02.620]   can be moved in with other forms of training,
[01:14:02.620 --> 01:14:04.480]   but I'll just give you a little hint now.
[01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:07.680]   It's very clear and it's described
[01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:09.860]   in the review article referred to,
[01:14:09.860 --> 01:14:12.300]   and we will link another article as well,
[01:14:12.300 --> 01:14:14.860]   that concurrent training, doing strength training
[01:14:14.860 --> 01:14:17.280]   and the endurance training of any of the four kinds
[01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:19.740]   that I'm describing today can be done.
[01:14:19.740 --> 01:14:21.700]   You can program those in the same week,
[01:14:21.700 --> 01:14:24.940]   but you want to get four and ideally six
[01:14:24.940 --> 01:14:28.260]   or even better 24 hours between these workouts,
[01:14:28.260 --> 01:14:30.700]   because it is very hard for instance,
[01:14:30.700 --> 01:14:33.380]   to do a one-to-one mile repeats,
[01:14:33.380 --> 01:14:35.200]   like run a mile, rest for equivalent time,
[01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:36.840]   run a mile, rest for equivalent time,
[01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:38.540]   to do that two or three times a week
[01:14:38.540 --> 01:14:40.380]   and also do weight training before
[01:14:40.380 --> 01:14:42.340]   or do a long run afterwards.
[01:14:42.340 --> 01:14:45.080]   That would quickly lead to breakdown for most people,
[01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:48.940]   unless you have very, very good energy utilization systems,
[01:14:48.940 --> 01:14:52.060]   you're a really kind of advanced or elite athlete
[01:14:52.060 --> 01:14:55.460]   and or dare I say you're using tools
[01:14:55.460 --> 01:14:57.680]   to enhance your performance at the level of blood
[01:14:57.680 --> 01:14:59.620]   or hormones and I'm actually going to talk about those
[01:14:59.620 --> 01:15:01.540]   at the end and why they work.
[01:15:01.540 --> 01:15:04.340]   So we have four kinds of endurance, muscular endurance,
[01:15:04.340 --> 01:15:05.940]   we have long duration endurance,
[01:15:05.940 --> 01:15:08.100]   we have high intensity interval training of two kinds,
[01:15:08.100 --> 01:15:10.940]   anaerobic and aerobic and this last type,
[01:15:10.940 --> 01:15:13.780]   the aerobic one works best it seems
[01:15:13.780 --> 01:15:15.500]   if you kind of do this one-to-one ratio.
[01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:18.300]   So how would you use these and what are they actually doing?
[01:15:18.300 --> 01:15:21.840]   Let's talk about the heart and the lungs and oxygen,
[01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:24.500]   because that's something that we can all benefit
[01:15:24.500 --> 01:15:27.940]   from understanding and it will become very clear
[01:15:27.940 --> 01:15:31.260]   in that discussion why this type of training is very useful,
[01:15:31.260 --> 01:15:34.780]   even for non-athletes in order to improve oxygenation
[01:15:34.780 --> 01:15:38.500]   and energy utilization of the brain and the heart.
[01:15:38.500 --> 01:15:39.540]   The brain and the heart
[01:15:39.540 --> 01:15:41.420]   are probably the two most important systems
[01:15:41.420 --> 01:15:43.300]   that you need to take care of in your life.
[01:15:43.300 --> 01:15:46.120]   Yes, your musculature needs to be maintained,
[01:15:46.120 --> 01:15:47.940]   if you want to build it, that's up to you,
[01:15:47.940 --> 01:15:50.020]   but you should try and maintain your musculature,
[01:15:50.020 --> 01:15:52.980]   but maintaining or enhancing a brain function
[01:15:52.980 --> 01:15:54.740]   and cardiovascular function,
[01:15:54.740 --> 01:15:58.100]   it's absolutely clear our key for health and longevity
[01:15:58.100 --> 01:15:59.260]   in the short and long term
[01:15:59.260 --> 01:16:01.180]   and the sorts of training I talked about today
[01:16:01.180 --> 01:16:03.180]   has been shown again and again and again
[01:16:03.180 --> 01:16:07.640]   to be very useful for enhancing the strength of the mind,
[01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:09.220]   yes, I'll talk about that,
[01:16:09.220 --> 01:16:12.540]   as well as the health of the brain and the body.
[01:16:12.540 --> 01:16:14.500]   So let's talk about the sorts of adaptations
[01:16:14.500 --> 01:16:16.080]   that are happening in your brain and body
[01:16:16.080 --> 01:16:19.940]   that are so beneficial in these different forms of training.
[01:16:19.940 --> 01:16:23.120]   If you are breathing hard and your heart is beating hard,
[01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:27.540]   so this would be certainly in the high intensity anaerobic
[01:16:27.540 --> 01:16:28.660]   and aerobic conditioning,
[01:16:28.660 --> 01:16:30.820]   'cause you're getting up near your VO2 max
[01:16:30.820 --> 01:16:32.940]   in high intensity aerobic conditioning
[01:16:32.940 --> 01:16:34.820]   and you're exceeding your VO2 max
[01:16:34.820 --> 01:16:38.700]   in high intensity anaerobic conditioning,
[01:16:38.700 --> 01:16:39.780]   what's going to happen is,
[01:16:39.780 --> 01:16:42.320]   as of course your heart beats faster,
[01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:46.140]   your blood is going to be circulating faster in principle,
[01:16:46.140 --> 01:16:50.220]   oxygen utilization in muscles is going to go up
[01:16:50.220 --> 01:16:55.500]   and over time, not long, very quickly what will happen
[01:16:55.500 --> 01:16:57.820]   when those capillary beds start to expand,
[01:16:57.820 --> 01:16:58.880]   we talked about that,
[01:17:00.340 --> 01:17:05.300]   but in addition, because of the amount of blood
[01:17:05.300 --> 01:17:07.220]   that's being returned to the heart
[01:17:07.220 --> 01:17:10.560]   when you engage in these really intense bouts of effort,
[01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:14.840]   repeatedly, the amount of blood being returned to the heart
[01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:18.140]   actually causes an eccentric loading
[01:17:18.140 --> 01:17:21.500]   of one of the muscular walls of the heart.
[01:17:21.500 --> 01:17:23.880]   So your heart is muscle, it's cardiac muscle,
[01:17:23.880 --> 01:17:25.380]   we have skeletal muscle attached to our bones
[01:17:25.380 --> 01:17:28.340]   and we have cardiac muscle, which is our heart.
[01:17:28.340 --> 01:17:31.100]   When more blood is being returned to the heart
[01:17:31.100 --> 01:17:32.700]   because of the additional work
[01:17:32.700 --> 01:17:35.840]   that your muscles and nerves are doing,
[01:17:35.840 --> 01:17:40.740]   it actually has the effect of creating an eccentric loading,
[01:17:40.740 --> 01:17:45.740]   a kind of pushing of the wall, the left wall,
[01:17:45.740 --> 01:17:48.000]   I realize I'm not using the strict anatomy here,
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:49.960]   but I don't want to get into all the features
[01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:52.540]   of the structural features of the heart,
[01:17:52.540 --> 01:17:57.540]   but the left ventricle essentially getting slammed back
[01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.540]   and then having to push back
[01:18:00.540 --> 01:18:03.180]   in a kind of eccentric loading of the cardiac muscle
[01:18:03.180 --> 01:18:05.160]   and the muscle thickens,
[01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:09.020]   but not because the heart thickens overall,
[01:18:09.020 --> 01:18:11.980]   it's actually a strengthening of the cardiac muscle
[01:18:11.980 --> 01:18:15.100]   in a way that increases what we call stroke volume,
[01:18:15.100 --> 01:18:18.000]   meaning as more blood is returned to the heart,
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:19.060]   there's an adaptation
[01:18:19.060 --> 01:18:21.980]   where the heart muscle actually gets stronger
[01:18:21.980 --> 01:18:26.340]   and therefore can pump more blood per stroke, per beat.
[01:18:26.340 --> 01:18:29.860]   And as it does that, it delivers,
[01:18:29.860 --> 01:18:34.080]   because blood contains glucose and oxygen and other things,
[01:18:34.080 --> 01:18:36.420]   it delivers more fuel to your muscles,
[01:18:36.420 --> 01:18:40.320]   which allows you to do yet more work per unit time, okay?
[01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:43.620]   So when we hear that, oh, so-and-so has a,
[01:18:43.620 --> 01:18:46.780]   or maybe you have a nice low heart rate
[01:18:46.780 --> 01:18:48.980]   that maybe you're one of these really extreme folks
[01:18:48.980 --> 01:18:50.600]   like 30 or 40 beats per minute,
[01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:53.080]   although most people are sitting at 50, 60, 70, 80,
[01:18:53.080 --> 01:18:54.680]   that's your resting heart rate.
[01:18:54.680 --> 01:18:56.160]   If you exercise regularly
[01:18:56.160 --> 01:18:59.000]   and you do long duration aerobic work,
[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.780]   your heart rate will start to go down,
[01:19:01.780 --> 01:19:02.860]   your resting heart rate,
[01:19:02.860 --> 01:19:05.380]   it will increase the stroke volume of your heart.
[01:19:05.380 --> 01:19:07.560]   If you do this high intensity type training
[01:19:07.560 --> 01:19:09.340]   where your heart is beating very hard,
[01:19:09.340 --> 01:19:12.760]   so maybe the one-to-one ratio mile run repeats
[01:19:12.760 --> 01:19:14.060]   that I described a minute ago,
[01:19:14.060 --> 01:19:17.220]   let's say you do that twice a week for three or four,
[01:19:17.220 --> 01:19:20.100]   and I said it could go all the way up to 12 sets,
[01:19:20.100 --> 01:19:22.520]   which is a lot, I don't recommend people start there,
[01:19:22.520 --> 01:19:25.180]   pretty soon the stroke volume of your heart
[01:19:25.180 --> 01:19:26.240]   will really increase,
[01:19:26.240 --> 01:19:28.860]   and as a consequence, you can deliver more fuel
[01:19:28.860 --> 01:19:31.440]   to your muscles and to your brain,
[01:19:31.440 --> 01:19:35.440]   and you will notice that you can do more work,
[01:19:35.440 --> 01:19:37.600]   meaning you can do the same work you were doing a few days
[01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:40.200]   or weeks ago with relative ease,
[01:19:40.200 --> 01:19:42.880]   your cognitive functioning will improve.
[01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:44.780]   This has been shown again and again
[01:19:44.780 --> 01:19:46.960]   because there's an increase in vasculature,
[01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:48.840]   literally capillary beds within the brain,
[01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:51.480]   the hippocampus areas that support memory,
[01:19:51.480 --> 01:19:54.640]   but also areas of the brain that support respiration,
[01:19:54.640 --> 01:19:57.320]   that support focus, that support effort.
[01:19:57.320 --> 01:19:58.640]   This isn't often discussed,
[01:19:58.640 --> 01:20:00.800]   but the ability to deliver more blood
[01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:02.260]   and therefore more glucose,
[01:20:02.260 --> 01:20:05.660]   remember neurons run on glucose and oxygen to the brain,
[01:20:05.660 --> 01:20:09.560]   is a big feature of why exercise of the kind I'm describing
[01:20:09.560 --> 01:20:11.800]   helps with brain function.
[01:20:11.800 --> 01:20:15.640]   Now, weight training does have some positive effects
[01:20:15.640 --> 01:20:16.960]   on brain function also.
[01:20:16.960 --> 01:20:18.940]   When I say weight training, I'm really,
[01:20:18.940 --> 01:20:20.160]   I should be more specific,
[01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:23.400]   I really am referring to strength and hypertrophy training.
[01:20:23.400 --> 01:20:25.600]   Strength and hypertrophy training,
[01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:28.360]   especially if it's of the sort where you get into the burn,
[01:20:28.360 --> 01:20:29.640]   as we talked about last episode,
[01:20:29.640 --> 01:20:32.080]   and you start generating lactate as a hormonal signal
[01:20:32.080 --> 01:20:33.960]   that can benefit your brain, et cetera,
[01:20:33.960 --> 01:20:36.600]   it can have positive effects on the brain.
[01:20:36.600 --> 01:20:38.880]   And frankly, there haven't been as many studies
[01:20:38.880 --> 01:20:40.480]   of resistance training,
[01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:43.020]   strength and hypertrophy training on brain function,
[01:20:43.020 --> 01:20:45.840]   mainly because most of those experiments are done in mice
[01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:49.440]   or primates, non-human primates, I should say,
[01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:53.280]   and it's hard to get mice to do resistance training, okay?
[01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:55.200]   It's hard to get humans to do resistance training.
[01:20:55.200 --> 01:20:57.120]   It's definitely hard to get mice to do resistance training.
[01:20:57.120 --> 01:20:59.400]   There are ways to do it, but it's hard to get them to do,
[01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:02.420]   say, three sets of eight on the deadlift
[01:21:02.420 --> 01:21:04.560]   and then do some curls and then do some chin ups
[01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:05.680]   and this kind of thing, okay?
[01:21:05.680 --> 01:21:08.480]   It's pretty easy to get a mouse to run on a treadmill
[01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:10.940]   and you can set the tension on that treadmill
[01:21:10.940 --> 01:21:13.220]   to make it so that it's easier or harder
[01:21:13.220 --> 01:21:15.500]   for the mouse to turn that wheel.
[01:21:15.500 --> 01:21:17.440]   So that's one of the reasons.
[01:21:17.440 --> 01:21:19.520]   However, it's very clear
[01:21:19.520 --> 01:21:21.560]   and you should now understand intuitively
[01:21:21.560 --> 01:21:23.800]   why the kind of standard strength
[01:21:23.800 --> 01:21:25.280]   and hypertrophy type workouts
[01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:29.880]   are not going to activate the blood oxygenation
[01:21:29.880 --> 01:21:32.660]   and the stroke volume increases for the heart
[01:21:32.660 --> 01:21:35.360]   that the sorts of training I'm talking about today will,
[01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:38.680]   it just doesn't have the same positive effects.
[01:21:38.680 --> 01:21:41.040]   Now, that isn't to say that if you just weight train
[01:21:41.040 --> 01:21:41.880]   that you'll be dumb
[01:21:41.880 --> 01:21:45.320]   or that you'll lose your memory over time, you might,
[01:21:45.320 --> 01:21:48.560]   but it is to say that endurance work,
[01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:52.160]   in particular, the high intensity and long duration work
[01:21:52.160 --> 01:21:53.080]   that I've talked about today,
[01:21:53.080 --> 01:21:54.440]   the two high intensity protocols
[01:21:54.440 --> 01:21:56.320]   and the long duration work
[01:21:56.320 --> 01:21:58.520]   has been shown again and again and again
[01:21:58.520 --> 01:22:00.780]   to have positive effects on brain function,
[01:22:00.780 --> 01:22:02.540]   not through the addition of new neurons,
[01:22:02.540 --> 01:22:04.020]   sorry to break it to you,
[01:22:04.020 --> 01:22:06.160]   but that's not a major event
[01:22:06.160 --> 01:22:10.080]   in the exercised or non-exercised human brain
[01:22:10.080 --> 01:22:12.600]   for reasons we can talk about in a future episode,
[01:22:12.600 --> 01:22:15.040]   but it still has many positive effects
[01:22:15.040 --> 01:22:17.800]   through the delivery of things like IGF-1,
[01:22:17.800 --> 01:22:21.660]   but also just through plain oxygenation of the brain
[01:22:21.660 --> 01:22:25.680]   and the way it promotes the development of microvasculature
[01:22:25.680 --> 01:22:30.000]   to develop, excuse me, to deliver neurons more nutrients.
[01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:33.440]   If neurons don't get oxygen and glucose, they do die,
[01:22:33.440 --> 01:22:36.180]   unless there's another fuel source like ketones,
[01:22:36.180 --> 01:22:37.680]   which can replace the glucose.
[01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:41.280]   If you don't give oxygen to neurons,
[01:22:41.280 --> 01:22:43.200]   if you don't deliver enough to them,
[01:22:43.200 --> 01:22:44.500]   you get what's called ischemia,
[01:22:44.500 --> 01:22:45.980]   you get little microstrokes.
[01:22:45.980 --> 01:22:48.880]   So the type of exercise I'm talking about today
[01:22:48.880 --> 01:22:52.000]   in generating intense heart rate increases,
[01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000]   provided that's safe for you to do,
[01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.660]   breathing hard, that's going to deliver oxygen and blood,
[01:22:56.660 --> 01:22:59.260]   increase stroke volume of the heart,
[01:22:59.260 --> 01:23:01.860]   and is going to improve brain function.
[01:23:01.860 --> 01:23:03.160]   This has been supported by many,
[01:23:03.160 --> 01:23:05.560]   many quality peer-reviewed studies.
[01:23:05.560 --> 01:23:08.800]   So that's one form of positive adaptation.
[01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:11.140]   I also talked about just sort of performance adaptations,
[01:23:11.140 --> 01:23:13.640]   how doing high intensity aerobic conditioning
[01:23:13.640 --> 01:23:16.320]   of the, you know, mile repeats type training
[01:23:16.320 --> 01:23:18.020]   can actually improve your ability
[01:23:18.020 --> 01:23:20.800]   to do long bouts of intense work.
[01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:23.440]   It also seems like it dovetails
[01:23:23.440 --> 01:23:26.040]   or is compatible with resistance training
[01:23:26.040 --> 01:23:28.400]   that's aimed towards strength and hypertrophy.
[01:23:28.400 --> 01:23:31.320]   Now in full disclosure, the data seem to indicate
[01:23:31.320 --> 01:23:33.960]   that if people just weight train or train for strength,
[01:23:33.960 --> 01:23:37.000]   so three reps, rest five minutes,
[01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:38.560]   three reps of heavy weights, et cetera,
[01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:40.960]   yeah, you'll get much stronger than you would
[01:23:40.960 --> 01:23:43.840]   if you're doing things like, you know, five repetitions
[01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:46.920]   up to 12 or 12 to 25 reps and you're, you know,
[01:23:46.920 --> 01:23:48.340]   and you're going out for long jogs.
[01:23:48.340 --> 01:23:49.980]   There's always going to be a compromise
[01:23:49.980 --> 01:23:51.900]   in adaptations, unfortunately.
[01:23:51.900 --> 01:23:53.960]   It does seem like you can do concurrent training,
[01:23:53.960 --> 01:23:56.680]   as I mentioned before, if you allow anywhere from four to six
[01:23:56.680 --> 01:23:59.560]   or ideally 24 hours between workouts.
[01:23:59.560 --> 01:24:01.200]   As I mentioned in the previous episode,
[01:24:01.200 --> 01:24:04.300]   if you want to know if you are recovered from a workout,
[01:24:04.300 --> 01:24:05.860]   a great way to do that is to apply
[01:24:05.860 --> 01:24:08.040]   the carbon dioxide tolerance test,
[01:24:08.040 --> 01:24:09.620]   which is four breaths in and out,
[01:24:09.620 --> 01:24:12.380]   inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale
[01:24:12.380 --> 01:24:16.020]   then a big inhale and then a slow controlled exhale.
[01:24:16.020 --> 01:24:20.400]   If that slow controlled exhale is 60 seconds or longer,
[01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:22.080]   it means that your parasympathetic,
[01:24:22.080 --> 01:24:24.700]   your calming nervous system is under your control
[01:24:24.700 --> 01:24:26.560]   and it's likely, I should say likely
[01:24:26.560 --> 01:24:29.320]   that systemically your whole nervous system has recovered
[01:24:29.320 --> 01:24:30.760]   from whatever it is that you've been doing
[01:24:30.760 --> 01:24:33.440]   and experiencing in life, including work and relationships.
[01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:37.740]   If not, you might want to take a rest day, dare I say,
[01:24:37.740 --> 01:24:40.320]   or Costello is on his, what?
[01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:44.620]   He's 10 now, I think he's on his 12,000th rest day.
[01:24:44.620 --> 01:24:46.740]   Most people need, I should say,
[01:24:46.740 --> 01:24:48.960]   one to two full rest days per week.
[01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:50.920]   I know there are people going to say that's ridiculous
[01:24:50.920 --> 01:24:54.960]   and okay, maybe you have amazing recovery abilities,
[01:24:54.960 --> 01:24:56.460]   also depends on training intensity.
[01:24:56.460 --> 01:24:58.240]   Many people benefit from having one or two
[01:24:58.240 --> 01:25:00.920]   full rest days per week, at least one.
[01:25:00.920 --> 01:25:02.260]   Some people don't need to,
[01:25:02.260 --> 01:25:06.280]   but if you are not able to extend that exhale
[01:25:06.280 --> 01:25:08.680]   on the carbon dioxide tolerance test
[01:25:08.680 --> 01:25:12.620]   past 60 seconds or so, 45 seconds, 60 seconds,
[01:25:12.620 --> 01:25:16.080]   chances are your so-called sympathetic nervous system,
[01:25:16.080 --> 01:25:18.240]   your stress system is chronically elevated
[01:25:18.240 --> 01:25:20.300]   and you're not really putting the brake
[01:25:20.300 --> 01:25:23.160]   on that system enough and that's a subconscious thing.
[01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:25.700]   There are ways that you can accelerate recovery,
[01:25:25.700 --> 01:25:28.100]   but I would encourage you to listen to the previous episode,
[01:25:28.100 --> 01:25:30.840]   it's timestamped for how to assess recovery.
[01:25:30.840 --> 01:25:32.440]   So how often to program these things
[01:25:32.440 --> 01:25:34.640]   will depend on the other things you're doing.
[01:25:34.640 --> 01:25:37.240]   I think it's perfectly reasonable to do
[01:25:37.240 --> 01:25:39.340]   this type of training with other types of training
[01:25:39.340 --> 01:25:41.920]   and I'll talk about a variety of combinations of those
[01:25:41.920 --> 01:25:44.200]   toward the end of the episode.
[01:25:44.200 --> 01:25:46.240]   I do want to talk about how to deliver
[01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:48.640]   more energy and oxygen.
[01:25:48.640 --> 01:25:51.880]   These are tools that are extremely useful, I believe,
[01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:54.400]   and that are grounded in physiology.
[01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:59.200]   The three things I'd like to talk about are how to breathe,
[01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:03.860]   what to do immediately after training, and hydration.
[01:26:03.860 --> 01:26:06.420]   And I promise I will get back into programming
[01:26:06.420 --> 01:26:09.380]   and sort of protocols, but these are vitally important
[01:26:09.380 --> 01:26:13.620]   to your ability to perform endurance work in particular,
[01:26:13.620 --> 01:26:18.260]   and they are grounded in how neurons and blood and oxygen
[01:26:18.260 --> 01:26:19.620]   and your heart work together.
[01:26:19.620 --> 01:26:22.800]   So let's first talk about breathing or respiration.
[01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:25.540]   We breathe a couple of different ways,
[01:26:25.540 --> 01:26:27.360]   but let's just remind ourselves why we breathe.
[01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:29.920]   We breathe to bring oxygen into our system
[01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:32.460]   and we breathe to get rid of carbon dioxide
[01:26:32.460 --> 01:26:35.400]   and we need both oxygen and carbon dioxide
[01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:39.000]   in order to utilize fuel and for our brain and body to work.
[01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:42.360]   It's not that oxygen is good and carbon dioxide is bad.
[01:26:42.360 --> 01:26:45.240]   They have to be present in the appropriate ratios.
[01:26:45.240 --> 01:26:49.040]   So one thing that is very clear is our ability
[01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:52.980]   to deliver oxygen to working muscles and to our brain
[01:26:52.980 --> 01:26:55.680]   is going to be important for our ability
[01:26:55.680 --> 01:26:57.320]   to generate muscular effort,
[01:26:57.320 --> 01:26:59.480]   especially of the kind I was talking about today,
[01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:01.240]   but also weight training and other forms
[01:27:01.240 --> 01:27:03.040]   of skill-based effort, et cetera,
[01:27:03.040 --> 01:27:04.840]   and our ability to think.
[01:27:04.840 --> 01:27:06.320]   If you're holding your breath for too long,
[01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:07.940]   if you're breathing too much,
[01:27:07.940 --> 01:27:10.120]   if you're what they call over-breathing or under-breathing,
[01:27:10.120 --> 01:27:12.040]   if you're shallow breathing, if you're mouth breathing,
[01:27:12.040 --> 01:27:15.260]   these are all things that can really impede mental
[01:27:15.260 --> 01:27:16.160]   and physical performance.
[01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:17.780]   So let's make it really simple
[01:27:17.780 --> 01:27:19.580]   and then I promise to do a future episode
[01:27:19.580 --> 01:27:21.180]   all about respiration.
[01:27:21.180 --> 01:27:24.860]   There are two main sources of air for your body
[01:27:24.860 --> 01:27:26.280]   and it's air coming in through your nose
[01:27:26.280 --> 01:27:27.640]   and air coming in through your mouth.
[01:27:27.640 --> 01:27:30.760]   In general, nasal breathing is better.
[01:27:30.760 --> 01:27:34.540]   It scrubs the air of bacteria and viruses.
[01:27:34.540 --> 01:27:37.600]   You have a microbiome in your nose that benefits.
[01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:38.840]   There are a number of reasons.
[01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:41.280]   It's also just a more efficient system, believe it or not.
[01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:42.880]   Even though it feels like you can gulp more air
[01:27:42.880 --> 01:27:47.880]   with your mouth, getting good at nasal breathing is useful.
[01:27:47.880 --> 01:27:50.240]   A gear system of the type that Brian McKenzie
[01:27:50.240 --> 01:27:51.320]   and colleagues have developed,
[01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:52.920]   I think is a good way to conceptualize this.
[01:27:52.920 --> 01:27:54.840]   If you're doing long duration work,
[01:27:54.840 --> 01:27:56.440]   try and do it all nasal breathing.
[01:27:56.440 --> 01:27:58.040]   If you have deviated septum,
[01:27:58.040 --> 01:28:01.380]   it's probably 'cause you don't nasal breathe enough.
[01:28:01.380 --> 01:28:06.000]   Mouth breathing is something that many people suffer from.
[01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:07.720]   You're more prone to infections.
[01:28:07.720 --> 01:28:09.520]   It's not as efficient, et cetera.
[01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:10.880]   There is a place for mouth breathing.
[01:28:10.880 --> 01:28:15.880]   However, it's usually if you need to do a strong exhale,
[01:28:15.880 --> 01:28:19.540]   oftentimes you can discard more volume through the mouth
[01:28:19.540 --> 01:28:21.960]   unless you're very trained at nasal breathing.
[01:28:21.960 --> 01:28:23.820]   So if you're doing high intensity training,
[01:28:23.820 --> 01:28:25.680]   a good way to conceptualize this
[01:28:25.680 --> 01:28:28.720]   is to exhale on the max effort
[01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:32.860]   and then to inhale on the less intense part.
[01:28:32.860 --> 01:28:36.360]   So that might be as you're generating the movement,
[01:28:36.360 --> 01:28:39.440]   in the concentric part of the movement, you exhale, right?
[01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:41.680]   Just like on a bat swing or something like that,
[01:28:41.680 --> 01:28:44.800]   or fighters and martial artists do this differently
[01:28:44.800 --> 01:28:46.160]   depending on how they were trained
[01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:47.120]   and the different purposes,
[01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:49.000]   but the kind of like, ah, or shh,
[01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.400]   the kind of exhaling during the effort
[01:28:51.400 --> 01:28:54.820]   and then inhaling on the portion of the repetition
[01:28:54.820 --> 01:28:57.360]   that is not the highest effort portion.
[01:28:57.360 --> 01:28:59.600]   Usually that's the eccentric phase
[01:28:59.600 --> 01:29:01.800]   of anything involving weights or rowing
[01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:03.040]   and things of that sort.
[01:29:03.040 --> 01:29:07.000]   So nasal breathing is great,
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.460]   but as you increase the intensity of your endurance work,
[01:29:09.460 --> 01:29:10.760]   you will need to incorporate the mouth.
[01:29:10.760 --> 01:29:12.220]   So a gear system would look something like,
[01:29:12.220 --> 01:29:14.220]   first gear would be just nasal breathing
[01:29:14.220 --> 01:29:16.360]   or second gear would also be just nasal breathing,
[01:29:16.360 --> 01:29:17.380]   but with more effort.
[01:29:17.380 --> 01:29:19.520]   Third gear, again, Power Speed Endurance
[01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:20.440]   has a lot more about this.
[01:29:20.440 --> 01:29:21.840]   You can go to their website.
[01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:24.840]   I think it's a very intelligent way to conceptualize this.
[01:29:24.840 --> 01:29:28.160]   As you go into more max effort,
[01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:30.460]   then you're going into third and fourth and fifth gear,
[01:29:30.460 --> 01:29:32.740]   and at some point you're not thinking about nose or mouth.
[01:29:32.740 --> 01:29:34.380]   You're just trying to hang on for dear life
[01:29:34.380 --> 01:29:36.220]   and complete the work safely.
[01:29:36.220 --> 01:29:40.460]   And that means breathe through whatever orifice
[01:29:40.460 --> 01:29:41.700]   works for you.
[01:29:41.700 --> 01:29:45.220]   So that's one aspect, nose versus mouth.
[01:29:45.220 --> 01:29:48.660]   The other aspect is whether or not you're using your ribs,
[01:29:48.660 --> 01:29:50.620]   the intercostal muscles are these muscles
[01:29:50.620 --> 01:29:54.320]   that the Bruce Lee had these remarkable intercostal muscles
[01:29:54.320 --> 01:29:58.660]   that allow you to lift the rib cage or the diaphragm,
[01:29:58.660 --> 01:30:00.760]   which is a skeletal muscle that sits below the lungs.
[01:30:00.760 --> 01:30:03.160]   Just to remind you, when you inhale, the diaphragm moves down.
[01:30:03.160 --> 01:30:06.880]   When you exhale, the diaphragm moves up.
[01:30:06.880 --> 01:30:11.340]   Here's something that most people don't do
[01:30:11.340 --> 01:30:12.880]   and would benefit tremendously from,
[01:30:12.880 --> 01:30:14.800]   and I can say this because Andy Galpin's lab
[01:30:14.800 --> 01:30:16.800]   has done work on this,
[01:30:16.800 --> 01:30:19.840]   exploring how warming up the intercostals
[01:30:19.840 --> 01:30:21.660]   and the nerve to diaphragm pathways
[01:30:21.660 --> 01:30:24.100]   before any kind of endurance work,
[01:30:24.100 --> 01:30:26.380]   or in the first few minutes of endurance work,
[01:30:26.380 --> 01:30:28.940]   can allow you to breathe more deeply
[01:30:28.940 --> 01:30:33.100]   and to deliver more oxygen to the blood and, excuse me,
[01:30:33.100 --> 01:30:34.780]   and to the muscles,
[01:30:34.780 --> 01:30:37.860]   and to be able to do more work more efficiently.
[01:30:37.860 --> 01:30:40.340]   So what that involves is sometimes sitting,
[01:30:40.340 --> 01:30:41.160]   sometimes standing,
[01:30:41.160 --> 01:30:43.540]   and just really concentrating on two things.
[01:30:43.540 --> 01:30:46.140]   We always hear about how we should diaphragmatic breathe,
[01:30:46.140 --> 01:30:48.960]   and that means our belly moves out when we inhale.
[01:30:48.960 --> 01:30:51.340]   So our stomach expands,
[01:30:51.340 --> 01:30:54.200]   but also expanding the intercostals,
[01:30:54.200 --> 01:30:56.660]   which means actually raising the ribs, chest breathing.
[01:30:56.660 --> 01:30:58.340]   We're all told that in yoga class,
[01:30:58.340 --> 01:31:00.580]   don't breathe with your chest this,
[01:31:00.580 --> 01:31:04.460]   but actually that is warming up the intercostal muscles.
[01:31:04.460 --> 01:31:07.220]   So this is also a great way to generate adrenaline
[01:31:07.220 --> 01:31:09.380]   if you do it a little bit intensely.
[01:31:09.380 --> 01:31:12.260]   So let's say you're feeling unmotivated to train.
[01:31:12.260 --> 01:31:14.820]   I don't particularly like doing endurance training
[01:31:14.820 --> 01:31:16.220]   until I'm actually doing it.
[01:31:17.540 --> 01:31:20.420]   So I use and benefit from having a practice
[01:31:20.420 --> 01:31:22.200]   where I'll just sit there and for about three minutes,
[01:31:22.200 --> 01:31:23.280]   I'll just breathe very deeply,
[01:31:23.280 --> 01:31:25.700]   trying to raise my chest as much as I can
[01:31:25.700 --> 01:31:26.540]   for maybe a minute,
[01:31:26.540 --> 01:31:29.900]   and then contracting my diaphragm
[01:31:29.900 --> 01:31:32.360]   and expanding my stomach outward when I inhale.
[01:31:32.360 --> 01:31:33.200]   By the end of that,
[01:31:33.200 --> 01:31:36.000]   you're actually delivering more oxygen to your system.
[01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:39.620]   My lab has looked at this in a totally different context.
[01:31:39.620 --> 01:31:40.560]   Andy's lab has looked at it
[01:31:40.560 --> 01:31:43.700]   in the context of physical performance.
[01:31:43.700 --> 01:31:47.280]   So warming up the breathing muscles should make sense
[01:31:47.280 --> 01:31:50.240]   given that you now know that muscles and neurons
[01:31:50.240 --> 01:31:53.840]   need glucose and they need oxygen in order to function.
[01:31:53.840 --> 01:31:54.880]   And so that's a great warmup.
[01:31:54.880 --> 01:31:56.700]   You can also do this while walking
[01:31:56.700 --> 01:31:59.100]   or while getting on the bike and starting to pedal,
[01:31:59.100 --> 01:32:00.580]   really starting to think about
[01:32:00.580 --> 01:32:03.020]   warming up the breathing system.
[01:32:03.020 --> 01:32:05.060]   And then you can decide if you want to do pure nasal
[01:32:05.060 --> 01:32:08.820]   or a combination of nasal and mouth breathing and so on.
[01:32:08.820 --> 01:32:10.380]   So that's something that we don't often hear about.
[01:32:10.380 --> 01:32:11.680]   The other one,
[01:32:11.680 --> 01:32:13.800]   the other tool rather that I've talked about
[01:32:13.800 --> 01:32:15.300]   in a previous episode, I'll just mention again,
[01:32:15.300 --> 01:32:17.620]   is some people when they do endurance type work,
[01:32:17.620 --> 01:32:19.320]   they get a stitch in their side.
[01:32:19.320 --> 01:32:21.520]   They feel like they've got a side cramp.
[01:32:21.520 --> 01:32:26.520]   Very rarely is it actually a skeletal muscular cramp.
[01:32:26.520 --> 01:32:31.740]   It's oftentimes it's a referenced pain of the phrenic nerve
[01:32:31.740 --> 01:32:32.860]   that innervates the liver.
[01:32:32.860 --> 01:32:34.260]   So the phrenic nerve is responsible
[01:32:34.260 --> 01:32:36.240]   for the movement of the diaphragm.
[01:32:36.240 --> 01:32:39.040]   It is a very important system,
[01:32:39.040 --> 01:32:41.280]   but it has a number of what we call collateral.
[01:32:41.280 --> 01:32:44.800]   So it branches to other organs, runs over other organs.
[01:32:44.800 --> 01:32:46.760]   Sometimes when we're breathing shallow
[01:32:46.760 --> 01:32:48.540]   and we are in physical motion
[01:32:48.540 --> 01:32:50.340]   and we're engaging in physical effort,
[01:32:50.340 --> 01:32:51.980]   we'll feel that side stitch and we think,
[01:32:51.980 --> 01:32:54.060]   oh, I've got a cramp, or maybe I'm dehydrated,
[01:32:54.060 --> 01:32:56.980]   or maybe I need to run with my hands over my head.
[01:32:56.980 --> 01:32:57.940]   Excuse me.
[01:32:57.940 --> 01:33:00.460]   Typically you can relieve that side cramp,
[01:33:00.460 --> 01:33:01.660]   which isn't a cramp at all,
[01:33:01.660 --> 01:33:04.580]   that side stitch by doing the double inhale, exhale,
[01:33:04.580 --> 01:33:06.680]   really breathing deeply,
[01:33:06.680 --> 01:33:09.800]   and then sneaking a little bit more air in.
[01:33:09.800 --> 01:33:12.300]   That's a double kind of firing
[01:33:12.300 --> 01:33:14.440]   or what we call volley of action potential,
[01:33:14.440 --> 01:33:18.040]   sent from the phrenic nerve to the diaphragm,
[01:33:18.040 --> 01:33:20.560]   which will also activate that collateral,
[01:33:20.560 --> 01:33:23.940]   that branch literally of the nerve that innervates the liver.
[01:33:23.940 --> 01:33:26.280]   And then when you exhale,
[01:33:26.280 --> 01:33:28.140]   you offload a bunch of carbon dioxide.
[01:33:28.140 --> 01:33:30.500]   But if you repeat that a few times,
[01:33:30.500 --> 01:33:33.020]   often, in fact for me every time,
[01:33:33.020 --> 01:33:35.080]   but often what'll happen is that side stitch
[01:33:35.080 --> 01:33:36.280]   will just naturally disappear.
[01:33:36.280 --> 01:33:38.320]   It just means you're not breathing properly.
[01:33:38.320 --> 01:33:40.800]   The phrenic nerve is firing in a way
[01:33:40.800 --> 01:33:43.440]   that's kind of aggravating that referenced pain.
[01:33:43.440 --> 01:33:46.080]   There's nothing kind of voodoo or mysterious about this.
[01:33:46.080 --> 01:33:47.100]   It just has to do with the way
[01:33:47.100 --> 01:33:50.220]   that the different nerves travel in the body.
[01:33:50.220 --> 01:33:52.040]   So as you set out on your run,
[01:33:52.040 --> 01:33:54.840]   or maybe you're going to do some muscular endurance work
[01:33:54.840 --> 01:33:58.580]   or high intensity work, warming up the intercostals,
[01:33:58.580 --> 01:34:01.120]   warming up the diaphragm is good.
[01:34:01.120 --> 01:34:03.280]   And there are exercises,
[01:34:03.280 --> 01:34:04.340]   there is work that you can do
[01:34:04.340 --> 01:34:06.340]   to strengthen the intercostals
[01:34:06.340 --> 01:34:08.440]   and to strengthen the diaphragm
[01:34:08.440 --> 01:34:10.080]   during bouts of this kind of effort.
[01:34:10.080 --> 01:34:12.040]   And I would say that one of the ways
[01:34:12.040 --> 01:34:15.160]   that you can do that best is by really focusing
[01:34:15.160 --> 01:34:19.160]   on getting the maximum diaphragmatic expansion
[01:34:19.160 --> 01:34:21.960]   and chest lifting, what we're all told now not to do.
[01:34:21.960 --> 01:34:23.800]   Don't chest breathe, belly breathe.
[01:34:23.800 --> 01:34:25.600]   The intercostals are there for a reason,
[01:34:25.600 --> 01:34:27.640]   and they are perfectly good at filling your lungs.
[01:34:27.640 --> 01:34:30.200]   They work best when they collaborate with your diaphragm.
[01:34:30.200 --> 01:34:32.760]   But when you are starting to fatigue,
[01:34:32.760 --> 01:34:35.060]   to start to really inhale deeply
[01:34:35.060 --> 01:34:36.320]   and try and really expand those
[01:34:36.320 --> 01:34:39.280]   to deliver more oxygen to your system.
[01:34:39.280 --> 01:34:41.200]   While we're talking about delivering more oxygen
[01:34:41.200 --> 01:34:44.040]   to your system, I want to share with you a useful tool
[01:34:44.040 --> 01:34:47.040]   that will now make total sense mechanistically why it works,
[01:34:47.040 --> 01:34:51.020]   which is oftentimes when we are on a long run
[01:34:51.020 --> 01:34:53.400]   or in long duration bouts of effort,
[01:34:53.400 --> 01:34:57.040]   we will hit the so-called wall, right?
[01:34:57.040 --> 01:34:58.800]   We will bonk, I think they used to call it,
[01:34:58.800 --> 01:35:00.760]   or maybe do they still call it that Costello?
[01:35:00.760 --> 01:35:02.360]   He's asleep.
[01:35:02.360 --> 01:35:05.800]   We bonk, we just rethink, no, we can't continue.
[01:35:05.800 --> 01:35:08.700]   It's a curious thing as to whether or not that's neural
[01:35:08.700 --> 01:35:10.720]   or whether or not it's fuel-based.
[01:35:10.720 --> 01:35:12.900]   There's certainly going to be a psychological
[01:35:12.900 --> 01:35:14.440]   or motivational component.
[01:35:14.440 --> 01:35:17.800]   But one way that you can reveal this kind of extra gear,
[01:35:17.800 --> 01:35:20.160]   the capacity to push on is by understanding the way
[01:35:20.160 --> 01:35:24.420]   that different muscle fibers use energy differently.
[01:35:24.420 --> 01:35:27.120]   Remember the fast twitch phosphocreatine system
[01:35:27.120 --> 01:35:28.880]   and the slow twitch system that relies mainly
[01:35:28.880 --> 01:35:30.420]   on lipids and glucose.
[01:35:30.420 --> 01:35:32.360]   Okay, well, even if you don't remember all that,
[01:35:32.360 --> 01:35:34.280]   if you've been running steadily for a long time
[01:35:34.280 --> 01:35:35.400]   and you're starting to fatigue
[01:35:35.400 --> 01:35:37.240]   and you feel like it's time to quit,
[01:35:38.480 --> 01:35:41.700]   you may have not tapped into an alternative fuel source.
[01:35:41.700 --> 01:35:42.800]   One thing that you can do
[01:35:42.800 --> 01:35:45.160]   is you can actually increase your speed.
[01:35:45.160 --> 01:35:48.840]   This is also true of work where you're doing repetitions
[01:35:48.840 --> 01:35:49.900]   with kettlebells or something.
[01:35:49.900 --> 01:35:51.660]   You can start to increase your speed.
[01:35:51.660 --> 01:35:55.760]   So run faster, pedal faster, row faster, swim faster,
[01:35:55.760 --> 01:35:57.640]   not all out sprint.
[01:35:57.640 --> 01:36:00.520]   But in doing that, you're shifting the muscles
[01:36:00.520 --> 01:36:03.760]   and the nerves over towards utilizing a separate fuel source
[01:36:03.760 --> 01:36:05.700]   or a distinct fuel source.
[01:36:05.700 --> 01:36:07.160]   Maybe the phosphocreatine system,
[01:36:07.160 --> 01:36:10.400]   if it's a quick bout of intense acceleration,
[01:36:10.400 --> 01:36:14.000]   or maybe it's a combination of lipids and carbohydrates
[01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:17.060]   in your system that weren't available to you prior.
[01:36:17.060 --> 01:36:17.900]   Now, of course,
[01:36:17.900 --> 01:36:19.320]   if you completely deplete your liver glycogen,
[01:36:19.320 --> 01:36:21.360]   you completely deplete everything,
[01:36:21.360 --> 01:36:24.160]   you're only going to be running on stored fuel and fats
[01:36:24.160 --> 01:36:27.240]   and eventually you'll start metabolizing protein,
[01:36:27.240 --> 01:36:28.780]   muscles themselves.
[01:36:28.780 --> 01:36:33.560]   But this is a kind of a unique way to realize that,
[01:36:33.560 --> 01:36:36.540]   oh, you weren't out of energy at all.
[01:36:36.540 --> 01:36:39.000]   You were just over relying on one fuel source.
[01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.660]   And this is the reason why especially elite athletes
[01:36:41.660 --> 01:36:43.980]   are starting to both rely on carbohydrates.
[01:36:43.980 --> 01:36:45.680]   So they're doing the whole carb depletion
[01:36:45.680 --> 01:36:46.740]   then carb loading thing.
[01:36:46.740 --> 01:36:48.300]   They're loading up their liver and their muscles
[01:36:48.300 --> 01:36:51.260]   with plenty of glycogen by eating pastas and rice
[01:36:51.260 --> 01:36:52.180]   and stuff before races.
[01:36:52.180 --> 01:36:56.880]   But they are also ingesting ketones during races,
[01:36:56.880 --> 01:36:58.440]   during long bouts of effort
[01:36:58.440 --> 01:37:00.660]   because ketones can be a quick form of energy.
[01:37:00.660 --> 01:37:02.600]   There's no reason why you can't use ketones
[01:37:02.600 --> 01:37:06.080]   if they are taking exogenous ketones and carbohydrate
[01:37:06.080 --> 01:37:06.960]   and in combination.
[01:37:06.960 --> 01:37:08.700]   Remember the body is accustomed
[01:37:08.700 --> 01:37:10.260]   to using multiple fuel sources,
[01:37:10.260 --> 01:37:12.940]   fatty acids, carbohydrates, all these things.
[01:37:12.940 --> 01:37:15.740]   It's only in the kind of internet age
[01:37:15.740 --> 01:37:17.140]   that we think in terms of,
[01:37:17.140 --> 01:37:20.700]   oh, well, you're either keto or you're burning sugar
[01:37:20.700 --> 01:37:25.700]   or you're fat adapted or fat fasting or fast fasting
[01:37:25.700 --> 01:37:27.100]   or fat fadding.
[01:37:27.100 --> 01:37:28.740]   Costello woke up when I said fat fadding.
[01:37:28.740 --> 01:37:30.260]   I'm not talking about you Costello.
[01:37:30.260 --> 01:37:32.140]   So the point is that your body
[01:37:32.140 --> 01:37:33.740]   is used to using multiple fuel sources.
[01:37:33.740 --> 01:37:35.660]   So if you're kind of hitting that wall,
[01:37:35.660 --> 01:37:38.180]   sometimes accelerating can actually allow you
[01:37:38.180 --> 01:37:39.740]   to tap into a new fuel source
[01:37:39.740 --> 01:37:41.040]   or combination of fuel sources
[01:37:41.040 --> 01:37:43.740]   just based on the way that muscles use fuel.
[01:37:43.740 --> 01:37:45.480]   So that's another tool.
[01:37:45.480 --> 01:37:47.160]   The other thing that's really important to think about
[01:37:47.160 --> 01:37:50.500]   in terms of endurance type work is hydration.
[01:37:50.500 --> 01:37:52.240]   And I think hydration is important
[01:37:52.240 --> 01:37:54.560]   for all forms of physical work and exercise,
[01:37:54.560 --> 01:37:56.160]   not just endurance.
[01:37:56.160 --> 01:38:00.520]   The deal with hydration is that we've been taught
[01:38:00.520 --> 01:38:01.960]   about hydration all wrong,
[01:38:01.960 --> 01:38:05.020]   but let's remember what neurons work on.
[01:38:05.020 --> 01:38:06.900]   What do they use in order to fire?
[01:38:06.900 --> 01:38:10.640]   Well, they certainly need water, right?
[01:38:10.640 --> 01:38:12.880]   We need water in our system, I should say,
[01:38:12.880 --> 01:38:14.660]   but remember they use electrolytes,
[01:38:14.660 --> 01:38:17.020]   sodium and potassium to generate those action potentials
[01:38:17.020 --> 01:38:18.820]   to actually get neurons to contract,
[01:38:18.820 --> 01:38:20.760]   to be able, excuse me, muscles to contract
[01:38:20.760 --> 01:38:23.680]   and for our brain to function and to be able to think.
[01:38:23.680 --> 01:38:27.580]   Typically, typically we're going to lose
[01:38:27.580 --> 01:38:30.860]   anywhere from one to five pounds of water
[01:38:30.860 --> 01:38:32.180]   per hour of exercise.
[01:38:32.180 --> 01:38:33.660]   And that's going to vary tremendously.
[01:38:33.660 --> 01:38:35.460]   It's going to vary on weather.
[01:38:35.460 --> 01:38:37.360]   It's going to vary on intensity,
[01:38:37.360 --> 01:38:38.980]   probably more like five pounds.
[01:38:38.980 --> 01:38:43.060]   If it's hot day and you're exercising very intensely.
[01:38:43.060 --> 01:38:46.180]   So about one to five pounds per hour.
[01:38:46.180 --> 01:38:48.640]   Now, you know how much you weigh.
[01:38:48.640 --> 01:38:52.580]   So if you think about your weight in pounds,
[01:38:52.580 --> 01:38:57.580]   once you lose about one to 4% of your body weight in water,
[01:38:57.580 --> 01:39:01.820]   you're going to experience about a 20 to 30% reduction
[01:39:01.820 --> 01:39:06.380]   in work capacity in your ability to generate effort
[01:39:06.380 --> 01:39:09.820]   of any kind, strength, endurance, et cetera.
[01:39:09.820 --> 01:39:12.420]   You are also going to experience a significant drop
[01:39:12.420 --> 01:39:15.540]   in your ability to think and perform mental operations.
[01:39:15.540 --> 01:39:17.100]   So hydration is key.
[01:39:17.100 --> 01:39:18.500]   Now, many people have been told,
[01:39:18.500 --> 01:39:21.760]   well, if you urinate and your urine is clear,
[01:39:21.760 --> 01:39:23.500]   well, then you're hydrated enough.
[01:39:23.500 --> 01:39:26.300]   Sometimes that's true, sometimes that's not true.
[01:39:26.300 --> 01:39:29.660]   Also, and this is a topic I enjoy discussing,
[01:39:29.660 --> 01:39:33.020]   but urine is a biological phenomenon.
[01:39:33.020 --> 01:39:34.460]   It's actually filtered blood.
[01:39:34.460 --> 01:39:36.740]   Like every once in a while,
[01:39:36.740 --> 01:39:38.680]   and if there's a kid and it's a family friend, I'll say,
[01:39:38.680 --> 01:39:41.260]   did you know that your pee is actually filtered blood?
[01:39:41.260 --> 01:39:42.680]   And they usually kind of go wide-eyed,
[01:39:42.680 --> 01:39:44.020]   but then they go, oh, that's kind of cool.
[01:39:44.020 --> 01:39:47.140]   Like kids have this natural curiosity about blood and pee
[01:39:47.140 --> 01:39:51.460]   and stuff that's not contaminated by our preconceived notions
[01:39:51.460 --> 01:39:53.520]   of those things being gross.
[01:39:53.520 --> 01:39:56.360]   Because urine being filtered blood
[01:39:56.360 --> 01:39:58.640]   can give you some indication as to whether or not
[01:39:58.640 --> 01:40:01.000]   you're hydrated enough or not.
[01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.520]   And in order to really assess that,
[01:40:03.520 --> 01:40:06.400]   it's not going to be sufficient to urinate
[01:40:06.400 --> 01:40:08.840]   into another volume of water and assess whether or not
[01:40:08.840 --> 01:40:10.240]   your urine is very dark or very light.
[01:40:10.240 --> 01:40:12.500]   It actually requires urinating into a small volume
[01:40:12.500 --> 01:40:15.000]   and saying, well, is it darker or lighter than before?
[01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:18.080]   It's not something you really want to do most places.
[01:40:18.080 --> 01:40:22.240]   The etiquette of most gyms and environments
[01:40:22.240 --> 01:40:23.760]   is not suitable for that.
[01:40:23.760 --> 01:40:26.660]   But one of the things that you can just do
[01:40:26.660 --> 01:40:29.120]   is you can figure, well, I'm going to lose one to five pounds
[01:40:29.120 --> 01:40:30.820]   of water per hour.
[01:40:30.820 --> 01:40:35.720]   You can show up to exercise reasonably hydrated
[01:40:35.720 --> 01:40:36.880]   with electrolytes.
[01:40:36.880 --> 01:40:39.260]   So potassium, sodium, and magnesium are really key.
[01:40:39.260 --> 01:40:40.100]   Yes, it's true.
[01:40:40.100 --> 01:40:42.880]   You can die from drinking too much water in particular
[01:40:42.880 --> 01:40:45.660]   because it forces you, if you drink too much water,
[01:40:45.660 --> 01:40:47.360]   you'll excrete too many electrolytes
[01:40:47.360 --> 01:40:49.040]   and your brain will shut off.
[01:40:49.040 --> 01:40:51.500]   You'll actually, your heart will stop functioning properly.
[01:40:51.500 --> 01:40:53.140]   So you don't want to over-consume water
[01:40:53.140 --> 01:40:54.760]   to the extreme either.
[01:40:54.760 --> 01:40:57.240]   But there are a number of equations
[01:40:57.240 --> 01:40:59.560]   that go into figuring out how much water you need
[01:40:59.560 --> 01:41:02.000]   based on how intense your training, et cetera,
[01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:02.940]   body size, et cetera.
[01:41:02.940 --> 01:41:05.520]   Just remember, you burn, you lose, excuse me,
[01:41:05.520 --> 01:41:08.540]   about one to five pounds of water per hour,
[01:41:08.540 --> 01:41:09.580]   depending on how hot it is
[01:41:09.580 --> 01:41:11.300]   and how intensely you're exercising.
[01:41:11.300 --> 01:41:14.420]   Once your body weight drops by one to 4%,
[01:41:14.420 --> 01:41:15.740]   so you can just figure it well,
[01:41:15.740 --> 01:41:17.780]   if you lose five pounds per hour,
[01:41:17.780 --> 01:41:20.080]   you exercise for two hours,
[01:41:20.080 --> 01:41:23.540]   let's say you're about 200 pounds, that's about 10%, okay?
[01:41:23.540 --> 01:41:26.900]   Well, you want to replace that very quickly
[01:41:26.900 --> 01:41:29.100]   or you want to replace that all along
[01:41:29.100 --> 01:41:32.540]   before you start experiencing this massive 20 or 30% reduction
[01:41:32.540 --> 01:41:34.660]   in work capacity of muscles and the brain.
[01:41:34.660 --> 01:41:38.100]   A simple formula, what I call the Galpin equation,
[01:41:38.100 --> 01:41:41.220]   hereafter referred to as the Galpin equation,
[01:41:41.220 --> 01:41:44.560]   is a formula that gets you close to the exact amount
[01:41:44.560 --> 01:41:47.460]   that you would want that Dr. Andy Galpin came up with,
[01:41:47.460 --> 01:41:50.100]   which is your body weight in pounds
[01:41:50.100 --> 01:41:52.180]   divided by the number 30.
[01:41:52.180 --> 01:41:54.180]   And that is how many ounces you should drink
[01:41:54.180 --> 01:41:57.260]   for every 15 minutes of exercise.
[01:41:57.260 --> 01:41:59.580]   So once again, the Galpin equation,
[01:41:59.580 --> 01:42:03.460]   your body weight in pounds divided by 30,
[01:42:03.460 --> 01:42:08.460]   that's the amount of fluid to drink in ounces, right?
[01:42:08.460 --> 01:42:12.380]   Every 15 minutes of exercise.
[01:42:12.380 --> 01:42:15.580]   Now, if you are sweating a lot, you may need more, okay?
[01:42:15.580 --> 01:42:19.080]   If you're already very well hydrated, you may need less,
[01:42:19.080 --> 01:42:22.300]   but that's a good rule of thumb to begin
[01:42:22.300 --> 01:42:24.760]   and to start to understand the relationship
[01:42:24.760 --> 01:42:27.460]   between hydration and performance.
[01:42:27.460 --> 01:42:32.220]   There is a phenomenon in which gastric emptying,
[01:42:32.220 --> 01:42:34.400]   the ability to move stuff out of your gut,
[01:42:34.400 --> 01:42:37.400]   including water and electrolytes out of your gut
[01:42:37.400 --> 01:42:39.860]   and into the bloodstream and for delivery
[01:42:39.860 --> 01:42:41.880]   to the tissues of your body for effort,
[01:42:41.880 --> 01:42:45.520]   is hindered when you get above 70% of your VO2 max.
[01:42:45.520 --> 01:42:48.440]   In other words, when you're doing high intensity training,
[01:42:48.440 --> 01:42:51.240]   sometimes people experience that ingesting water
[01:42:51.240 --> 01:42:54.900]   during intense training is difficult.
[01:42:54.900 --> 01:42:57.880]   It is something that can be actually trained up.
[01:42:57.880 --> 01:43:00.800]   It's a matter of learning to kind of relax
[01:43:00.800 --> 01:43:02.700]   your abdominal muscles.
[01:43:02.700 --> 01:43:05.640]   And there's some other aspects of adaptation
[01:43:05.640 --> 01:43:09.340]   that will allow you to drink during higher intensity work.
[01:43:09.340 --> 01:43:14.340]   As Galpin says, don't try and ingest fluids
[01:43:14.340 --> 01:43:17.300]   when you're working out or competing at higher
[01:43:17.300 --> 01:43:19.820]   than 70% of VO2 max, if you've never done it before,
[01:43:19.820 --> 01:43:21.900]   you want to train up this capacity.
[01:43:21.900 --> 01:43:24.340]   People can learn how to consume fluids during a race
[01:43:24.340 --> 01:43:27.020]   or consume fluids during bouts of exercise
[01:43:27.020 --> 01:43:28.760]   that are very intense.
[01:43:28.760 --> 01:43:30.380]   And a lot of people don't want to do that
[01:43:30.380 --> 01:43:32.700]   'cause they don't want to have to stop to urinate, et cetera.
[01:43:32.700 --> 01:43:35.460]   But given the crucial role of hydration
[01:43:35.460 --> 01:43:38.600]   for muscular performance and for brain performance,
[01:43:38.600 --> 01:43:40.400]   it seems that if you're going to be doing
[01:43:40.400 --> 01:43:42.760]   a lot of high intensity interval training
[01:43:42.760 --> 01:43:45.140]   of the various kinds I talked about today
[01:43:45.140 --> 01:43:46.920]   or high intensity training of any kind,
[01:43:46.920 --> 01:43:49.000]   that hydration is key and learning,
[01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.140]   or in other words, getting your system to adapt
[01:43:51.140 --> 01:43:53.600]   to ingesting fluids in the middle of these workouts
[01:43:53.600 --> 01:43:56.520]   is something that seems beneficial, at least to me,
[01:43:56.520 --> 01:44:00.080]   in terms of the trade-off between being dehydrated
[01:44:00.080 --> 01:44:02.440]   and the somewhat discomfort of maybe drinking some fluids.
[01:44:02.440 --> 01:44:04.640]   So you sip small amounts of fluid initially,
[01:44:04.640 --> 01:44:06.560]   and then you're able to take bigger and bigger gulps
[01:44:06.560 --> 01:44:07.400]   as time goes on.
[01:44:07.400 --> 01:44:11.000]   And pretty soon you're able to drink mid-set
[01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.680]   or be, excuse me, not mid-set, please don't do that,
[01:44:13.680 --> 01:44:15.080]   between sets in your workout
[01:44:15.080 --> 01:44:17.380]   or while you're still breathing hard after a mile repeat
[01:44:17.380 --> 01:44:19.960]   or something of that sort without much disruption
[01:44:19.960 --> 01:44:22.020]   or any at all to your performance.
[01:44:22.020 --> 01:44:25.220]   Last episode, we talked about how to assess recovery
[01:44:25.220 --> 01:44:28.180]   and things that you might want to do to improve recovery,
[01:44:28.180 --> 01:44:30.480]   how exposure to ice baths and cold showers
[01:44:30.480 --> 01:44:33.520]   can reduce inflammation, which can be great for recovery,
[01:44:33.520 --> 01:44:36.660]   but can inhibit some of the adaptations
[01:44:36.660 --> 01:44:37.920]   for strength and hypertrophy
[01:44:37.920 --> 01:44:40.520]   because inflammation isn't good or bad.
[01:44:40.520 --> 01:44:43.920]   Inflammation isn't like a nice person or a mean person,
[01:44:43.920 --> 01:44:44.840]   it's both.
[01:44:44.840 --> 01:44:48.560]   It's a great thing for stimulating adaptations,
[01:44:48.560 --> 01:44:50.300]   but you don't want it around too long.
[01:44:50.300 --> 01:44:52.420]   And so we suggested that you not do ice baths
[01:44:52.420 --> 01:44:55.620]   within probably six hours of any training
[01:44:55.620 --> 01:44:58.720]   where the goal was hypertrophy or strength training.
[01:44:58.720 --> 01:45:00.860]   There is some evidence that getting yourself
[01:45:00.860 --> 01:45:04.900]   into an ice bath or cold shower after endurance training
[01:45:04.900 --> 01:45:09.900]   can actually improve the mitochondrial aspects
[01:45:09.900 --> 01:45:11.200]   of endurance exercise,
[01:45:11.200 --> 01:45:14.760]   that you can get improvements in mitochondrial density
[01:45:14.760 --> 01:45:18.720]   and you can get improvements in mitochondrial respiration
[01:45:18.720 --> 01:45:20.040]   by doing that afterwards
[01:45:20.040 --> 01:45:22.080]   and that it can facilitate recovery.
[01:45:22.080 --> 01:45:24.800]   That's still a bit of a controversial area.
[01:45:24.800 --> 01:45:26.360]   I do think that what I mentioned earlier,
[01:45:26.360 --> 01:45:27.720]   that waiting at least six hours
[01:45:27.720 --> 01:45:30.600]   and probably more like 24 hours between workouts
[01:45:30.600 --> 01:45:33.740]   is a good idea that getting at least one full day of rest
[01:45:33.740 --> 01:45:35.560]   each week, for some people, that'll be two.
[01:45:35.560 --> 01:45:37.160]   I have to say, I'm one of these people
[01:45:37.160 --> 01:45:40.060]   that after two days of absolutely no exercise,
[01:45:40.060 --> 01:45:42.120]   I do perform better consistently
[01:45:42.120 --> 01:45:44.260]   across all aspects of physical performance
[01:45:44.260 --> 01:45:46.760]   and mentally, I feel better as well.
[01:45:46.760 --> 01:45:49.100]   Even though I loathe to take those days off,
[01:45:49.100 --> 01:45:51.160]   unless I'm really exhausted,
[01:45:51.160 --> 01:45:53.200]   it does seem to help my training.
[01:45:53.200 --> 01:45:55.200]   Some people can train seven days a week and they're fine.
[01:45:55.200 --> 01:45:57.820]   I think there's a lot of individual variation.
[01:45:57.820 --> 01:46:00.400]   You want to work on sleep and maximizing sleep for recovery,
[01:46:00.400 --> 01:46:01.920]   nutrition, of course, as well.
[01:46:01.920 --> 01:46:06.340]   I talked about sleep in the first four episodes
[01:46:06.340 --> 01:46:07.180]   of the podcast.
[01:46:07.180 --> 01:46:08.720]   So if you have trouble with sleep,
[01:46:08.720 --> 01:46:11.080]   definitely check out those episodes.
[01:46:11.080 --> 01:46:14.700]   It's very clear and a number of sports teams,
[01:46:14.700 --> 01:46:16.780]   even some folks that I work with,
[01:46:16.780 --> 01:46:20.060]   and Andy Galpin and others are starting to incorporate
[01:46:20.060 --> 01:46:22.580]   a what's called a parasympathetic down regulation
[01:46:22.580 --> 01:46:25.500]   after training of any kind as a way to accelerate recovery
[01:46:25.500 --> 01:46:27.420]   and enable you to do more work.
[01:46:27.420 --> 01:46:29.500]   In other words, get back to workout sooner.
[01:46:29.500 --> 01:46:31.300]   What is parasympathetic down regulation?
[01:46:31.300 --> 01:46:33.620]   It means finishing your training
[01:46:33.620 --> 01:46:35.840]   and instead of just hopping on the phone
[01:46:35.840 --> 01:46:38.560]   or hopping into your car and heading off
[01:46:38.560 --> 01:46:42.280]   to take five minutes minimum, maybe ideally more like 10
[01:46:42.280 --> 01:46:45.180]   or 20, but for sake of time, five minutes minimum
[01:46:45.180 --> 01:46:49.060]   and doing just some slow, pure nasal, long exhale,
[01:46:49.060 --> 01:46:51.180]   devoted breathing, or lying down
[01:46:51.180 --> 01:46:53.060]   and just kind of zoning out.
[01:46:53.060 --> 01:46:55.820]   That it seems can accelerate recovery
[01:46:55.820 --> 01:46:59.000]   and allow you to get back into other types of work,
[01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.220]   mental work or physical work more quickly,
[01:47:01.220 --> 01:47:05.380]   which makes total sense because remember your nervous system
[01:47:05.380 --> 01:47:08.540]   and recovery and work is a local phenomenon.
[01:47:08.540 --> 01:47:10.100]   Which muscles were you using?
[01:47:10.100 --> 01:47:13.080]   Were you using your glutes, your hams and your back,
[01:47:13.080 --> 01:47:14.680]   or were you using your shoulders, et cetera,
[01:47:14.680 --> 01:47:16.480]   but it's also a systemic thing.
[01:47:16.480 --> 01:47:18.660]   It's also about those neurons in the locus coeruleus
[01:47:18.660 --> 01:47:19.700]   that are releasing epinephrine.
[01:47:19.700 --> 01:47:22.200]   You want to quiet all that down after training.
[01:47:22.200 --> 01:47:23.960]   You want to really just zone out.
[01:47:23.960 --> 01:47:26.660]   Think Costello, channel your inner Costello
[01:47:26.660 --> 01:47:29.740]   and just mellow out for five to 20 minutes
[01:47:29.740 --> 01:47:31.860]   and then move into the rest of your day.
[01:47:31.860 --> 01:47:33.620]   Five minutes should be manageable,
[01:47:33.620 --> 01:47:35.500]   even if it's just sitting in the car with your eyes closed,
[01:47:35.500 --> 01:47:37.540]   doing that down regulation breathing.
[01:47:37.540 --> 01:47:39.340]   I think you'll see big benefits
[01:47:39.340 --> 01:47:42.540]   in terms of allowing yourself to come back sooner,
[01:47:42.540 --> 01:47:45.780]   do more work over time and just perform
[01:47:45.780 --> 01:47:47.300]   and feel better generally,
[01:47:47.300 --> 01:47:49.100]   as well as be able to think about other things
[01:47:49.100 --> 01:47:51.640]   besides just how much the previous workout
[01:47:51.640 --> 01:47:52.700]   kind of beat you up.
[01:47:52.700 --> 01:47:55.980]   A couple more things I think are going to be useful
[01:47:55.980 --> 01:47:57.780]   and I do want to just pack these in
[01:47:57.780 --> 01:48:01.140]   'cause we are closing out the month on physical performance
[01:48:01.140 --> 01:48:03.220]   and that's about programming
[01:48:03.220 --> 01:48:06.940]   and about pacing and the kind of mental aspects
[01:48:06.940 --> 01:48:08.300]   of endurance.
[01:48:08.300 --> 01:48:12.660]   So let's start with pacing and mental aspects of endurance.
[01:48:12.660 --> 01:48:17.300]   I learned from a friend and colleague here at the podcast
[01:48:17.300 --> 01:48:20.140]   that who's very active in triathlon and marathon
[01:48:20.140 --> 01:48:22.260]   and other knows a lot about that whole world
[01:48:22.260 --> 01:48:24.100]   and the competitive landscape there,
[01:48:24.100 --> 01:48:28.140]   that pacing and literally physical pacers
[01:48:28.140 --> 01:48:31.100]   of a laser on the ground or visualizing
[01:48:31.100 --> 01:48:34.340]   or having a pace car or a pace runner in front
[01:48:34.340 --> 01:48:37.100]   is actually not allowed in many competitions.
[01:48:37.100 --> 01:48:39.060]   And if those are present,
[01:48:39.060 --> 01:48:42.920]   doesn't allow the race times to qualify
[01:48:42.920 --> 01:48:45.640]   as legitimate record holding times.
[01:48:45.640 --> 01:48:47.380]   And that's very interesting to me
[01:48:47.380 --> 01:48:51.740]   because what we know is that the visual system
[01:48:51.740 --> 01:48:54.580]   has this capacity to switch back and forth
[01:48:54.580 --> 01:48:56.180]   between what we call panoramic vision
[01:48:56.180 --> 01:48:57.940]   where we're not really focused on anything,
[01:48:57.940 --> 01:48:59.760]   things are just flowing past us
[01:48:59.760 --> 01:49:02.300]   or our eyes are just kind of zoned out.
[01:49:02.300 --> 01:49:04.620]   So I can do this right now and you won't be able to tell,
[01:49:04.620 --> 01:49:06.180]   but I'm looking at the corners of the room.
[01:49:06.180 --> 01:49:07.820]   I see Costello down there on the floor.
[01:49:07.820 --> 01:49:10.320]   I see my podcast team here
[01:49:10.320 --> 01:49:12.580]   and I can also see the microphone.
[01:49:12.580 --> 01:49:14.780]   I can see myself in this environment.
[01:49:14.780 --> 01:49:16.120]   That's panoramic vision.
[01:49:16.120 --> 01:49:18.260]   Whereas if I draw my eyes to one location,
[01:49:18.260 --> 01:49:20.000]   like right there in the center of the camera,
[01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:21.580]   it's what's called a vergence eye movement.
[01:49:21.580 --> 01:49:23.820]   So I'm contracting my visual window.
[01:49:23.820 --> 01:49:27.140]   The contraction of the visual window when that's done
[01:49:27.140 --> 01:49:28.340]   is the same thing that would happen
[01:49:28.340 --> 01:49:31.320]   if I was tracking say a pace car or a pace runner
[01:49:31.320 --> 01:49:33.280]   or a laser on the ground.
[01:49:33.280 --> 01:49:35.280]   The mirror bringing our eyes together
[01:49:35.280 --> 01:49:37.580]   to what we call a vergence point
[01:49:37.580 --> 01:49:40.780]   has the impact of triggering the activation
[01:49:40.780 --> 01:49:43.040]   of neural circuits in the thalamus,
[01:49:43.040 --> 01:49:44.500]   things like zona and serta,
[01:49:44.500 --> 01:49:46.080]   if you really want to know what their names are
[01:49:46.080 --> 01:49:46.920]   of these brain areas,
[01:49:46.920 --> 01:49:49.660]   as well as in the brainstem that activate
[01:49:49.660 --> 01:49:52.400]   the so-called alertness system, things like locus coeruleus.
[01:49:52.400 --> 01:49:55.400]   Whereas panoramic vision tends to bring us
[01:49:55.400 --> 01:49:56.940]   into states of relaxation.
[01:49:56.940 --> 01:49:59.720]   You can actually leverage this during your runs.
[01:49:59.720 --> 01:50:03.200]   Let's say you're out for a long run or you're swimming
[01:50:03.200 --> 01:50:04.040]   or you're cycling.
[01:50:04.040 --> 01:50:06.440]   This is probably easiest to imagine out of the water,
[01:50:06.440 --> 01:50:08.420]   but you could probably do in the water as well.
[01:50:08.420 --> 01:50:10.600]   If you focus your attention on a landmark
[01:50:10.600 --> 01:50:12.320]   that you're going to run to,
[01:50:12.320 --> 01:50:14.040]   you'll find that it's much easier
[01:50:14.040 --> 01:50:17.280]   than if you don't actually have a set milestone
[01:50:17.280 --> 01:50:19.280]   or landmark that you're going to run to.
[01:50:19.280 --> 01:50:21.600]   However, if you were to continue that repeatedly,
[01:50:21.600 --> 01:50:24.240]   just going milestone after milestone after milestone,
[01:50:24.240 --> 01:50:26.500]   you would feel more mentally fatigued
[01:50:26.500 --> 01:50:28.600]   and you would actually be able to degenerate
[01:50:28.600 --> 01:50:30.520]   less work overall.
[01:50:30.520 --> 01:50:35.120]   One thing that can be useful is focusing on a milestone,
[01:50:35.120 --> 01:50:37.160]   running to that milestone or biking,
[01:50:37.160 --> 01:50:38.660]   whatever it is the activity happens to be,
[01:50:38.660 --> 01:50:42.160]   and then dilating your field of view to relax the system
[01:50:42.160 --> 01:50:43.600]   and then continuing again.
[01:50:43.600 --> 01:50:46.160]   So it's this kind of active contraction
[01:50:46.160 --> 01:50:47.800]   or of the visual window
[01:50:47.800 --> 01:50:49.660]   and then dilation of the visual window.
[01:50:49.660 --> 01:50:51.240]   Contraction of the visual window allows you
[01:50:51.240 --> 01:50:52.240]   to generate more effort,
[01:50:52.240 --> 01:50:53.520]   but there's a cost to doing that
[01:50:53.520 --> 01:50:54.980]   because neurons consume energy
[01:50:54.980 --> 01:50:56.760]   and now you know how they do that.
[01:50:56.760 --> 01:50:58.420]   Whereas dilation allows you
[01:50:58.420 --> 01:51:01.680]   to essentially be more efficient, right?
[01:51:01.680 --> 01:51:03.920]   Now, pacing is not allowed
[01:51:03.920 --> 01:51:06.340]   or having a pacer, a visual pacer,
[01:51:06.340 --> 01:51:08.680]   because it does allow you to access systems
[01:51:08.680 --> 01:51:09.920]   in the brain and body
[01:51:09.920 --> 01:51:13.720]   that allow you to create more energy, more effort.
[01:51:13.720 --> 01:51:14.920]   And so I find it interesting
[01:51:14.920 --> 01:51:17.240]   that I think in a kind of subconscious genius,
[01:51:17.240 --> 01:51:21.360]   the race officials and the governing bodies of these races
[01:51:21.360 --> 01:51:23.480]   have said, okay, sure, having a pacer there
[01:51:23.480 --> 01:51:25.360]   or someone in front, you can draft off of them.
[01:51:25.360 --> 01:51:28.460]   There's actually a kind of a aerodynamic effect
[01:51:28.460 --> 01:51:29.360]   of having someone in front of you
[01:51:29.360 --> 01:51:31.160]   that makes it easier to run
[01:51:31.160 --> 01:51:34.400]   in the wake of their Airstream, so to speak.
[01:51:34.400 --> 01:51:36.240]   Same is true in cycling.
[01:51:36.240 --> 01:51:37.420]   This is why the cycling teams
[01:51:37.420 --> 01:51:40.220]   are so good at maneuvering in packs in very specific ways.
[01:51:40.220 --> 01:51:42.280]   You can go faster with less effort
[01:51:42.280 --> 01:51:45.180]   if you're drafting, as it's called, behind somebody.
[01:51:45.180 --> 01:51:48.120]   But as well, where you place your vision
[01:51:48.120 --> 01:51:50.260]   will allow you to generate more effort.
[01:51:50.260 --> 01:51:52.060]   And so it's interesting that they've taken out
[01:51:52.060 --> 01:51:57.060]   this kind of, if you will, performance enhancing tool.
[01:51:57.060 --> 01:51:59.680]   I imagine, and I have to imagine,
[01:51:59.680 --> 01:52:00.980]   it's the appropriate word here,
[01:52:00.980 --> 01:52:05.980]   that good runners, good cyclists have the ability
[01:52:05.980 --> 01:52:10.360]   to create a kind of pacer in their mind's eye.
[01:52:10.360 --> 01:52:12.720]   I have to imagine that they're not just completely allowing
[01:52:12.720 --> 01:52:13.780]   their attention to drift,
[01:52:13.780 --> 01:52:15.280]   although they do that when they want to be
[01:52:15.280 --> 01:52:17.560]   in highly efficient mode, generating effort
[01:52:17.560 --> 01:52:19.740]   without having to tax their mental capacity.
[01:52:19.740 --> 01:52:22.680]   And remember, mental capacity is neural energy
[01:52:22.680 --> 01:52:25.440]   and consumes glucose, energy that they could devote
[01:52:25.440 --> 01:52:26.960]   to the functioning of their body.
[01:52:26.960 --> 01:52:30.600]   But that when needed, that they can focus their energy in
[01:52:30.600 --> 01:52:34.280]   and actually kind of chase a mental pacer or pick milestones.
[01:52:34.280 --> 01:52:37.380]   So this is a mental game that you can play as well.
[01:52:37.380 --> 01:52:38.480]   It's a little bit hard to do
[01:52:38.480 --> 01:52:40.200]   in the context of weightlifting in the gym.
[01:52:40.200 --> 01:52:42.660]   It's more of a moving through space kind of thing.
[01:52:42.660 --> 01:52:45.960]   But some people do this by counting reps, et cetera.
[01:52:45.960 --> 01:52:49.780]   I think it's especially suitable for endurance type
[01:52:49.780 --> 01:52:52.140]   of exercise, especially done outside.
[01:52:52.140 --> 01:52:53.980]   One of the reasons I hate running on a treadmill
[01:52:53.980 --> 01:52:55.960]   is it just feels like it's never ending.
[01:52:55.960 --> 01:52:58.040]   And I've never tried one of these Peloton things.
[01:52:58.040 --> 01:52:59.720]   I try and avoid looking at screens as much
[01:52:59.720 --> 01:53:01.160]   as I possibly can.
[01:53:01.160 --> 01:53:03.760]   But if you try this next time you're out for a run or a swim,
[01:53:03.760 --> 01:53:05.680]   what you'll find is that you have a capacity
[01:53:05.680 --> 01:53:09.700]   to engage a system of higher energy output
[01:53:09.700 --> 01:53:11.640]   when you focus your eyes on a particular location,
[01:53:11.640 --> 01:53:13.280]   but you want to use that judiciously
[01:53:13.280 --> 01:53:15.940]   because your goal of course is to become efficient
[01:53:15.940 --> 01:53:17.620]   at moving through space over time
[01:53:17.620 --> 01:53:19.360]   and not taxing your brain and body
[01:53:19.360 --> 01:53:22.480]   to the point where you arrive at the end of that,
[01:53:22.480 --> 01:53:25.640]   unless it's race day, just completely tapped out.
[01:53:25.640 --> 01:53:29.400]   So that's a kind of interesting aspect of running.
[01:53:29.400 --> 01:53:31.980]   If you're a fan of running, which I am,
[01:53:31.980 --> 01:53:34.680]   and you get the chance to look at any of the documentaries
[01:53:34.680 --> 01:53:37.640]   or docudramas made about, excuse me,
[01:53:37.640 --> 01:53:39.240]   about Steve Prefontaine,
[01:53:39.240 --> 01:53:42.100]   it was clear that he was mostly in a battle with himself,
[01:53:42.100 --> 01:53:44.400]   but that he was also a highly competitive individual.
[01:53:44.400 --> 01:53:46.240]   And you'll see this in some of his races.
[01:53:46.240 --> 01:53:48.580]   I do encourage you to look some of those up on YouTube
[01:53:48.580 --> 01:53:49.620]   or see the docudramas.
[01:53:49.620 --> 01:53:50.680]   They're quite good.
[01:53:50.680 --> 01:53:55.440]   Where he ran the, essentially it was 12 laps on a track.
[01:53:55.440 --> 01:53:57.800]   It's essentially the 5,000 meter race,
[01:53:57.800 --> 01:53:59.640]   which is essentially three miles.
[01:53:59.640 --> 01:54:01.900]   And he essentially tried to sprint the whole thing,
[01:54:01.900 --> 01:54:02.740]   which is ridiculous.
[01:54:02.740 --> 01:54:04.000]   Actually knowing what you know today,
[01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:07.320]   you'll realize that Steve Prefontaine basically was pulling
[01:54:07.320 --> 01:54:10.680]   from strength, speed, power, muscular endurance,
[01:54:10.680 --> 01:54:13.540]   long duration effort, high intensity, aerobic, anaerobic,
[01:54:13.540 --> 01:54:16.040]   is he sort of tried to maximize every fuel system.
[01:54:16.040 --> 01:54:18.660]   And you'll see that in the races that he runs,
[01:54:18.660 --> 01:54:22.700]   but that when runners are nearing the final laps,
[01:54:22.700 --> 01:54:24.240]   the so-called bell lap of a race,
[01:54:24.240 --> 01:54:27.060]   they'll often look to one another to see where somebody is,
[01:54:27.060 --> 01:54:28.940]   obviously to assess their progress
[01:54:28.940 --> 01:54:30.440]   and how close somebody is.
[01:54:30.440 --> 01:54:32.860]   But when somebody gets past,
[01:54:32.860 --> 01:54:37.260]   oftentimes you'll see someone access this mysterious kick,
[01:54:37.260 --> 01:54:40.240]   this ability to tap into some additional gear
[01:54:40.240 --> 01:54:43.060]   that allows them to run forward or faster
[01:54:43.060 --> 01:54:45.160]   when they themselves actually thought
[01:54:45.160 --> 01:54:46.640]   that they were maxed out.
[01:54:46.640 --> 01:54:48.800]   So someone could be running for the finish line,
[01:54:48.800 --> 01:54:49.940]   they're convinced they're going to win,
[01:54:49.940 --> 01:54:51.120]   they're going max effort,
[01:54:51.120 --> 01:54:53.520]   or at least they perceive max effort, someone passes them.
[01:54:53.520 --> 01:54:56.200]   And all of a sudden max effort has changed.
[01:54:56.200 --> 01:54:57.920]   Because of that visual target,
[01:54:57.920 --> 01:55:01.800]   they are able to access higher levels of speed and output
[01:55:01.800 --> 01:55:03.020]   and effort and performance.
[01:55:03.020 --> 01:55:05.220]   They don't always catch up to that person and win,
[01:55:05.220 --> 01:55:07.980]   but having a target, a milestone,
[01:55:07.980 --> 01:55:11.460]   is a powerful way that we can generate more force
[01:55:11.460 --> 01:55:12.980]   and energy in anything.
[01:55:12.980 --> 01:55:15.160]   And the visual system is the way
[01:55:15.160 --> 01:55:18.500]   that we bring those milestones into our brain,
[01:55:18.500 --> 01:55:20.500]   which then brings about epinephrine,
[01:55:20.500 --> 01:55:22.300]   which brings about neural firing,
[01:55:22.300 --> 01:55:24.720]   which allows us to access whatever resources
[01:55:24.720 --> 01:55:26.520]   happen to be available to us.
[01:55:26.520 --> 01:55:30.600]   So I find this fascinating because people often wonder,
[01:55:30.600 --> 01:55:32.300]   like, where does the kick come from?
[01:55:32.300 --> 01:55:35.340]   Where is this kind of gift of an additional gear?
[01:55:35.340 --> 01:55:36.980]   Where is that deeper resource?
[01:55:36.980 --> 01:55:39.300]   And we often express it and talk about it
[01:55:39.300 --> 01:55:42.660]   in kind of psychological terms like heart or willpower,
[01:55:42.660 --> 01:55:45.520]   or that something kind of got transplanted into us
[01:55:45.520 --> 01:55:46.740]   or descended into us,
[01:55:46.740 --> 01:55:50.300]   and not to remove any of the spiritual aspects of sport
[01:55:50.300 --> 01:55:54.500]   or running or effort or the human heart.
[01:55:54.500 --> 01:55:57.220]   But it's very clear that the nervous system,
[01:55:57.220 --> 01:55:59.540]   when it has a specific visual target,
[01:55:59.540 --> 01:56:02.740]   can generate the sorts of intense effort
[01:56:02.740 --> 01:56:04.140]   that it couldn't otherwise.
[01:56:04.140 --> 01:56:05.760]   And it sometimes even comes as a surprise
[01:56:05.760 --> 01:56:08.060]   to the person generating the effort.
[01:56:08.060 --> 01:56:10.360]   I promised that I would talk about programming,
[01:56:10.360 --> 01:56:14.260]   meaning when and how many times a week
[01:56:14.260 --> 01:56:16.780]   to do the various workouts related to endurance
[01:56:16.780 --> 01:56:19.420]   and how to merge those with other types of exercise
[01:56:19.420 --> 01:56:21.620]   that you might be doing for strength or yoga
[01:56:21.620 --> 01:56:23.900]   or other things that you might be doing like work
[01:56:23.900 --> 01:56:26.420]   and other things unrelated to exercise.
[01:56:26.420 --> 01:56:30.580]   Since that's a vast space with many different parameters
[01:56:30.580 --> 01:56:32.500]   and you all have different lives and lifestyles
[01:56:32.500 --> 01:56:35.140]   and backgrounds with fitness, et cetera,
[01:56:35.140 --> 01:56:37.180]   what I'm going to do is I'm going to put
[01:56:37.180 --> 01:56:39.780]   three different levels, if you will,
[01:56:39.780 --> 01:56:42.920]   or protocols that one could adopt
[01:56:42.920 --> 01:56:47.800]   in a link on the show notes or in the caption on YouTube.
[01:56:47.800 --> 01:56:48.900]   If you click on that link,
[01:56:48.900 --> 01:56:52.600]   you'll be able to see three possible combinations
[01:56:52.600 --> 01:56:55.040]   of endurance work, strength and hypertrophy work,
[01:56:55.040 --> 01:56:58.200]   or endurance work, flexibility and hypertrophy work
[01:56:58.200 --> 01:57:00.900]   that are grounded in many of the major publications
[01:57:00.900 --> 01:57:03.460]   that Dr. Andy Galpin and colleagues and other people
[01:57:03.460 --> 01:57:05.840]   have described, including this review
[01:57:05.840 --> 01:57:08.440]   that's also linked there on concurrent training
[01:57:08.440 --> 01:57:10.740]   and how one can use concurrent training,
[01:57:10.740 --> 01:57:12.980]   meaning training for endurance, training for strength,
[01:57:12.980 --> 01:57:14.180]   training for hypertrophy,
[01:57:14.180 --> 01:57:15.460]   training for all these different things
[01:57:15.460 --> 01:57:17.240]   without having to train constantly every day,
[01:57:17.240 --> 01:57:18.920]   twice a day, et cetera.
[01:57:18.920 --> 01:57:21.780]   So if you are interested in taking the protocols
[01:57:21.780 --> 01:57:23.620]   that you learned about in this episode
[01:57:23.620 --> 01:57:26.180]   and in previous episodes and combining those,
[01:57:26.180 --> 01:57:27.740]   we've placed them there for you
[01:57:27.740 --> 01:57:29.860]   as a completely zero cost resource.
[01:57:29.860 --> 01:57:31.800]   Please understand they are not wholly,
[01:57:32.700 --> 01:57:34.580]   Costello agrees they are not wholly.
[01:57:34.580 --> 01:57:38.460]   There will be variation in terms of what people can tolerate
[01:57:38.460 --> 01:57:39.700]   and what they have time for,
[01:57:39.700 --> 01:57:42.160]   but I think they'll serve as a useful guideline
[01:57:42.160 --> 01:57:45.220]   in getting started or in continuing with
[01:57:45.220 --> 01:57:48.320]   and expanding on existing endurance work,
[01:57:48.320 --> 01:57:51.220]   strength work, hypertrophy work, and so forth.
[01:57:51.220 --> 01:57:52.060]   Just really quickly,
[01:57:52.060 --> 01:57:54.280]   we didn't talk about supplements much today.
[01:57:54.280 --> 01:57:55.320]   In the previous episodes,
[01:57:55.320 --> 01:57:57.220]   I talked about the phosphocreatine system
[01:57:57.220 --> 01:57:58.740]   and supplementing with creatine,
[01:57:58.740 --> 01:58:02.900]   talked about beta-alanine for kind of moderate duration work.
[01:58:02.900 --> 01:58:05.940]   Really the only things that have been shown
[01:58:05.940 --> 01:58:08.780]   to really improve endurance work
[01:58:08.780 --> 01:58:12.420]   across the four varieties of endurance work
[01:58:12.420 --> 01:58:16.520]   I described today, they have essentially two forms.
[01:58:16.520 --> 01:58:19.060]   One are stimulants, so things like caffeine
[01:58:19.060 --> 01:58:22.260]   will definitely improve endurance work and power output.
[01:58:22.260 --> 01:58:24.940]   There's a little bit of evidence that caffeine intake
[01:58:24.940 --> 01:58:27.700]   can actually inhibit the function of the creatine system,
[01:58:27.700 --> 01:58:31.580]   but it's just one study, but that's interesting.
[01:58:31.580 --> 01:58:32.540]   If you want to read that study,
[01:58:32.540 --> 01:58:35.380]   you can put caffeine into examine.com
[01:58:35.380 --> 01:58:37.380]   and it will take you to that study.
[01:58:37.380 --> 01:58:39.380]   Many people get sore after workouts,
[01:58:39.380 --> 01:58:41.220]   in particular workouts that involve
[01:58:41.220 --> 01:58:45.140]   a lot of eccentric loading or workouts that are very novel
[01:58:45.140 --> 01:58:46.400]   where they've kind of pushed it
[01:58:46.400 --> 01:58:49.420]   instead of moving gradually, as I suggest,
[01:58:49.420 --> 01:58:52.020]   into say high-intensity anaerobic endurance work
[01:58:52.020 --> 01:58:55.060]   of three sets of 20 seconds on, 100 second rest.
[01:58:55.060 --> 01:58:58.060]   Maybe you get over-ambitious and you do eight sets,
[01:58:58.060 --> 01:59:00.500]   in which case you are extremely sore.
[01:59:00.500 --> 01:59:01.780]   Certain forms of magnesium,
[01:59:01.780 --> 01:59:05.240]   in particular magnesium malate, M-A-L-A-T-E,
[01:59:05.240 --> 01:59:09.220]   have been shown to be useful for removing
[01:59:09.220 --> 01:59:12.820]   or reducing the amount of delayed onset muscle soreness.
[01:59:12.820 --> 01:59:14.920]   That form of magnesium is distinctly different
[01:59:14.920 --> 01:59:16.000]   than the sorts of magnesium
[01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:17.540]   that are good for getting us into sleep,
[01:59:17.540 --> 01:59:19.940]   things like magnesium threonate and biglycinate.
[01:59:19.940 --> 01:59:24.060]   And then there's this whole thing about beet powder
[01:59:24.060 --> 01:59:28.240]   and beet juices and things that increase nitric oxide
[01:59:28.240 --> 01:59:30.140]   and allow for more vasodilation
[01:59:30.140 --> 01:59:32.700]   and therefore delivery of blood to muscle and neurons
[01:59:32.700 --> 01:59:34.940]   and other tissues for long bouts of endurance work.
[01:59:34.940 --> 01:59:39.100]   Some people like beet juice and the related compounds
[01:59:39.100 --> 01:59:41.220]   that increase arginine and vasodilation.
[01:59:41.220 --> 01:59:42.580]   Some people don't.
[01:59:42.580 --> 01:59:45.300]   Some people don't feel good when they take those.
[01:59:45.300 --> 01:59:47.820]   Some people also don't feel good when they take beta-alanine
[01:59:47.820 --> 01:59:49.340]   because it can give them this feeling
[01:59:49.340 --> 01:59:52.680]   of kind of like itchy, creepy crawlies under the skin,
[01:59:52.680 --> 01:59:55.280]   kind of the niacin phenomenon, the niacin flush.
[01:59:55.280 --> 01:59:56.460]   Some people don't mind that
[01:59:56.460 --> 01:59:58.140]   or some people don't experience that.
[01:59:58.140 --> 01:59:59.380]   So when it comes to supplementation,
[01:59:59.380 --> 02:00:00.300]   there's a lot of variety,
[02:00:00.300 --> 02:00:04.180]   but magnesium malate has been shown to reduce soreness.
[02:00:04.180 --> 02:00:05.620]   So sometimes that's good.
[02:00:05.620 --> 02:00:08.040]   Cold and hot contrast therapy for soreness,
[02:00:08.040 --> 02:00:09.160]   things of that sort.
[02:00:09.160 --> 02:00:14.160]   But in general, we focused mainly today on behavioral tools.
[02:00:14.160 --> 02:00:17.880]   You'll notice that all of the tools are accessible
[02:00:17.880 --> 02:00:20.340]   without the need for lots of equipment.
[02:00:20.340 --> 02:00:22.420]   So I didn't say you need a rower or you need a kettlebell,
[02:00:22.420 --> 02:00:23.860]   though those will work.
[02:00:23.860 --> 02:00:26.320]   And I hope I was able to illustrate for you
[02:00:26.320 --> 02:00:28.220]   that endurance isn't just one thing.
[02:00:28.220 --> 02:00:31.440]   It's not just the ability to go for long bouts
[02:00:31.440 --> 02:00:33.420]   of exercise of different kinds,
[02:00:33.420 --> 02:00:34.980]   that there's also this mental component
[02:00:34.980 --> 02:00:36.660]   because of the way that neurons work.
[02:00:36.660 --> 02:00:39.700]   And also that there are these different forms of endurance,
[02:00:39.700 --> 02:00:41.640]   of muscular endurance where you're going to fail
[02:00:41.640 --> 02:00:45.020]   'cause of the muscles and muscle energy utilization
[02:00:45.020 --> 02:00:47.060]   and the nerves that innervate those muscles locally,
[02:00:47.060 --> 02:00:50.640]   not because of a failure to bring in oxygen or blood,
[02:00:50.640 --> 02:00:54.180]   whereas long duration effort, it's going to be more about
[02:00:54.180 --> 02:00:57.220]   being below your VO2 max and your ability to be efficient
[02:00:57.220 --> 02:01:00.180]   for long bouts of more than 12 minutes of exercise.
[02:01:00.180 --> 02:01:04.600]   One set, as I say, of 12 minutes to maybe several hours.
[02:01:04.600 --> 02:01:07.480]   I should just mention with long duration type work,
[02:01:07.480 --> 02:01:10.060]   you could even imagine raking in the yard or mowing a lawn,
[02:01:10.060 --> 02:01:11.340]   depending on how big that lawn is.
[02:01:11.340 --> 02:01:13.880]   I used to have a job when I was a kid mowing lawns.
[02:01:13.880 --> 02:01:15.440]   And I'll tell you,
[02:01:15.440 --> 02:01:17.460]   we didn't have many neighbors with very big lawns,
[02:01:17.460 --> 02:01:19.500]   but there are a few of them felt huge
[02:01:19.500 --> 02:01:20.940]   'cause they were really convoluted.
[02:01:20.940 --> 02:01:22.180]   And if you're pushing that mower
[02:01:22.180 --> 02:01:23.360]   and these were the old fashioned mowers,
[02:01:23.360 --> 02:01:24.740]   not electric mowers, it's work.
[02:01:24.740 --> 02:01:26.540]   That's also of the sort that we call
[02:01:26.540 --> 02:01:28.400]   long duration endurance work.
[02:01:28.400 --> 02:01:31.640]   High intensity training will tap into yet other fuel sources
[02:01:31.640 --> 02:01:34.600]   and mechanisms as we learned today.
[02:01:34.600 --> 02:01:37.540]   So if you are enjoying this podcast
[02:01:37.540 --> 02:01:40.400]   and you're finding the information useful,
[02:01:40.400 --> 02:01:41.980]   it would be great if you would subscribe

[02:02:22.080 --> 02:02:24.080]   We like to think that you would give us a five-star review,
[02:02:24.080 --> 02:02:26.700]   but you can also leave comments on Apple
[02:02:26.700 --> 02:02:28.240]   about the podcast more generally.
[02:02:28.240 --> 02:02:30.760]   And again, those are all zero cost ways
[02:02:30.760 --> 02:02:33.100]   that you can really help support the podcast.
[02:02:33.100 --> 02:02:34.340]   We do have a Patreon.
[02:02:34.340 --> 02:02:38.180]   It is patreon.com/andrewhuberman.
[02:02:38.180 --> 02:02:40.620]   At patreon.com/andrewhuberman,
[02:02:40.620 --> 02:02:43.540]   you can support the podcast at any level that you like.
[02:02:43.540 --> 02:02:45.180]   Please also check out our sponsors
[02:02:45.180 --> 02:02:47.140]   that we mentioned at the beginning of the podcast.
[02:02:47.140 --> 02:02:48.860]   I know ad reads are not the first thing
[02:02:48.860 --> 02:02:50.500]   that people want to hear when they're getting ready
[02:02:50.500 --> 02:02:51.980]   to consume scientific information.
[02:02:51.980 --> 02:02:54.700]   Please understand that the ads and the sponsors
[02:02:54.700 --> 02:02:57.500]   allow us to bring the zero cost to consumer information
[02:02:57.500 --> 02:03:00.340]   about science and science-related tools to everybody.
[02:03:00.340 --> 02:03:03.020]   So if you have the means, check out the sponsors.
[02:03:03.020 --> 02:03:05.060]   We only work with sponsors whose products
[02:03:05.060 --> 02:03:07.140]   we really believe in and that I actually use
[02:03:07.140 --> 02:03:08.580]   and really love.
[02:03:08.580 --> 02:03:10.220]   There's no obligation, however,
[02:03:10.220 --> 02:03:13.540]   and we do talk about supplements from time to time.
[02:03:13.540 --> 02:03:15.540]   Again, no obligation to use supplements.
[02:03:15.540 --> 02:03:17.480]   We also talk about behavioral tools,
[02:03:17.480 --> 02:03:19.440]   but if you're interested in supplements,
[02:03:19.440 --> 02:03:22.100]   please go to examine.com to evaluate those supplements
[02:03:22.100 --> 02:03:24.860]   and their various effects if you're curious about that.
[02:03:24.860 --> 02:03:29.280]   And we work with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E.
[02:03:29.280 --> 02:03:31.980]   Thorne is a supplement manufacturer
[02:03:31.980 --> 02:03:34.320]   that we believe has the highest levels of stringency
[02:03:34.320 --> 02:03:36.700]   in terms of the quality of the supplements.
[02:03:36.700 --> 02:03:39.860]   And they are very precise and very stringent
[02:03:39.860 --> 02:03:42.900]   about the amounts of each of those compounds
[02:03:42.900 --> 02:03:44.020]   in the given supplements.
[02:03:44.020 --> 02:03:47.320]   This is a huge problem elsewhere in the supplement industry.
[02:03:47.320 --> 02:03:50.120]   Many brands don't include what they say they include
[02:03:50.120 --> 02:03:50.960]   on the bottle.
[02:03:50.960 --> 02:03:54.420]   It seems to show up every time people test different brands,
[02:03:54.420 --> 02:03:56.540]   but Thorne continually tests out
[02:03:56.540 --> 02:03:59.220]   with the highest levels of accuracy and stringency.
[02:03:59.220 --> 02:04:00.920]   If you want to see the supplements that I take,
[02:04:00.920 --> 02:04:05.580]   you can go to thorne.com/u/huberman.
[02:04:05.580 --> 02:04:06.700]   And if you do that,
[02:04:06.700 --> 02:04:08.080]   you can see all the supplements that I take.
[02:04:08.080 --> 02:04:11.580]   You can get 20% off any of those supplements as well.
[02:04:11.580 --> 02:04:14.620]   If you want to navigate into the main Thorne site
[02:04:14.620 --> 02:04:16.580]   and you see a supplement that you're interested in,
[02:04:16.580 --> 02:04:19.620]   you'll also get 20% off any of those supplements as well.
[02:04:19.620 --> 02:04:23.380]   So that's thorne.com/u/huberman.
[02:04:23.380 --> 02:04:25.340]   So we have both cost-free
[02:04:25.340 --> 02:04:28.500]   and other ways to help support the podcast.
[02:04:28.500 --> 02:04:31.620]   If you know people that might be interested in the podcast
[02:04:31.620 --> 02:04:33.220]   and benefit from the information,
[02:04:33.220 --> 02:04:34.300]   please recommend it to them.
[02:04:34.300 --> 02:04:35.220]   That really helps us.
