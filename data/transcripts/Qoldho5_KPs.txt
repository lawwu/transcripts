[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.080]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.920]   >> You're listening to Let's Talk Jobs,
[00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.160]   where we give you practical insights into jobs and careers.
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.520]   I'm Tim Chen, and today we're talking about
[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.160]   public relations and corporate communications.
[00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.440]   Back in 1982, Johnson & Johnson's Tylenol brand took a major hit.
[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.520]   There was a product tampering incident where
[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.120]   cyanide was introduced into their extra strength Tylenol capsules,
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.880]   that resulted in the deaths of seven people.
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.520]   Their response to this set the bar for
[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.960]   corporate crisis management and corporate responsibility.
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.760]   In addition to the recall of 31 million bottles of Tylenol,
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.760]   they chose to be very open in their corporate communications.
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.760]   Throughout the crisis, CEO James Burke held press conferences
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.040]   expressing concern for the victims while providing regular updates.
[00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.320]   They collaborated closely with law enforcement agencies,
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.720]   and the Food and Drug Administration during the investigation.
[00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.760]   Then they launched advertising and PR campaigns
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.120]   to rebuild public trust in the Tylenol brand.
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.200]   Now, all of that activity took a lot of intentional planning,
[00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.720]   coordination, and execution.
[00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.040]   This is an example of crisis comms,
[00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.840]   and it's just one aspect of
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.720]   the broad field that is public relations and corporate communications.
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.640]   Today, we're going to have a conversation with Alex Lynn Goldsmith.
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.320]   He's currently the Senior Director of
[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.400]   External Communications at Turnitin.
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.480]   Prior to that, he has led and driven
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.920]   major global comms initiatives across consumer and B2B.
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.520]   At 21st Century Fox,
[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.840]   he launched shows like Family Guy and Bones,
[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.640]   and he's led PR and comms teams at Oracle, VMware, and Cisco.
[00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.880]   In this video, Alex will talk about topics such
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.080]   as breaking down those various functions within global communications.
[00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.680]   How do you determine what a company should be communicating?
[00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:02.640]   Lastly, career options and growth opportunities in PR and comms.
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.080]   All right, let's get started.
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.720]   Today, we're talking about public relations and corporate communications.
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.200]   Joining us is Alex Goldsmith. Alex, how are you doing?
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.880]   >> I'm wonderful. How are you, Tim?
[00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.280]   >> I'm doing fantastic. Now, Alex,
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.560]   you and I have worked together before,
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.880]   and I've always admired how you do everything corporate comms and PR.
[00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.840]   Can you tell us just a little bit about what you're doing
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.680]   recently and how long you've been in the space?
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.280]   >> I've been working in communications for over a decade,
[00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.960]   and I've been doing them for celebrities,
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.840]   for politicians in the public sector,
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.760]   and most recently within tech and working for companies.
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.600]   Started off at 20th Century Fox,
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:36.760]   worked through the tech stack,
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.040]   and most recently with Oracle.
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.240]   What I really enjoy is the psychology of communications,
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.480]   and why do people care about something,
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.320]   and how do you get people to do the action that the organization wants?
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.600]   >> That's awesome. It's so critical,
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.880]   because you're at the forefront where you can control
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.640]   the dialogue of how people even perceive the company.
[00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.160]   I think that's the area.
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.680]   Actually, quite frankly, if I were to consider a career in corporate comms,
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.500]   it would intimidate the heck out of me.
[00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.000]   I was like, "That's a lot of responsibility to bear."
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.400]   Alex, I had an interesting conversation with someone recently,
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.520]   and I think this might be a good segue into our conversations.
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.000]   They're freshly out of college,
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.360]   into the job market, and they said,
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.080]   "Hey, Tim, I'm interested in public relations."
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.840]   I was like, "Okay, cool. What do you care about?"
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.680]   They're like, "Well, when I look at job postings,
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.400]   I see corporate communications as one sector of a job title,
[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.880]   and then I see public relations,
[00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.360]   but they seem to describe similar things."
[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.800]   In your point of view, are they different,
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.560]   or is one maybe a subset of the other?
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.240]   How do you look at that?
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.800]   >> There's many different perspectives on this,
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.160]   and that might be a frustrating way to start.
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.640]   Many industries look at it different ways.
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.720]   I would start as global comms as the overarching term,
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.280]   and there's external and internal,
[00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.680]   and it's framed by your audience.
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.240]   Specifically, you asked about public relations
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.520]   and corporate communications.
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.480]   Public relations is the discipline
[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.720]   that you're reaching your general public,
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.840]   and I think the transformation that's going on right now
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.440]   is it's a world beyond the press release.
[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.800]   It's basically what's the form factor.
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.400]   Corporate communications is often defined
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.760]   as your corporate affairs,
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.000]   how are you doing your earnings,
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.360]   your M&A, diversity, equity, inclusion.
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:18.840]   It's a lot related to the brand,
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.160]   and often it lives under the discipline of public relations.
[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:22.480]   >> Got it.
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.840]   >> You may have something like your product
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.680]   or your technology communications
[00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.200]   or public relations under public relations.
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.120]   You may have your partner and customers.
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.880]   Corporate comms often is one of
[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.200]   those disciplines under public relations.
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.160]   >> Got it. That's really helpful.
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.960]   For me, the hierarchy makes sense
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.920]   because then I think when you look at an organization,
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.720]   you look at the job roles available,
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.600]   and you can see how it's grouped together like that.
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.720]   Can you help us maybe just quickly cover,
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.280]   when it comes to the career or industry
[00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.440]   that is public relations or corporate comms,
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.840]   if someone's trying to consider a career and they're looking
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.960]   for maybe job roles or job types,
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.560]   what titles would they be looking for?
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.640]   Because I've heard a lot of things around like there's
[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.080]   media relations and I hear social media,
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.080]   but there's also corporate comms manager
[00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.280]   or even events sometimes falls into this.
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.320]   Can you just help us understand maybe the roles
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.440]   that people typically would look for?
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.560]   >> I would use a caveat if I'm applying
[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.280]   a media and entertainment and technology
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.040]   then to how we define this.
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.760]   Let's think about the purpose of
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:26.680]   this role and then we can get to the title.
[00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:27.120]   >> Great.
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.400]   >> The purpose is to look at the mission,
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.000]   the vision, and the values of
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.040]   the organization and communicate that for the reputation,
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:37.200]   whether that be an external audience or an internal audience.
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.840]   Essentially, that means that what you're
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.920]   driving towards is how do you balance the stock price?
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:44.120]   How do you look at perception?
[00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:45.400]   How do you look at brand?
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:46.840]   When you're looking at titles,
[00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.760]   it can be everything from under global comms,
[00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:53.120]   I'm working with industry analysts within public relations.
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.040]   It might be a director of analyst relations,
[00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:58.000]   it might be a VP or director of public relations,
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.840]   helping to drive message resonance.
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.760]   Employee communications would be,
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.680]   how's your internal employee sentiment?
[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.160]   It's someone who's a director or
[00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.520]   a senior manager of employee comms.
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.880]   Executive communications is often touching
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.120]   your informed general public about how are
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.480]   your executives showing up?
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:16.960]   What is their stump speech, their platform?
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.800]   That would be manager,
[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.920]   senior manager, director of executive communications.
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:23.880]   Then there's other disciplines as well,
[00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.920]   integrated storytelling, social media.
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.520]   Communications can live within marketing,
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.440]   it can be aligned with marketing.
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.920]   There's some organizations where global comms
[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:36.360]   lives in the chief people officer in finance.
[00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.480]   I think the key thing is,
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.040]   I often think of communications and
[00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.840]   those roles you talked about as
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:43.680]   the conscious to the organization.
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.480]   Often, you have to tell truth to
[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:49.360]   power and figure out what is the message to land.
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:53.320]   >> For you personally, of all of those areas,
[00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:55.120]   what drives you the most?
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:57.400]   What are you most passionate about?
[00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:02.000]   >> I've always been driven by the psychology of communications.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.840]   I'm a nerd and I love reading.
[00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:06.120]   I love the idea.
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:09.040]   There's this Roman orator named Cicero,
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.880]   who used to make speeches so
[00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:13.240]   well that people would be driven to action.
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:16.920]   He inspired me and so I really love the writing,
[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:19.720]   thinking about new ways of working with influencers,
[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:22.280]   and getting to the why,
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:24.080]   and then driving it through action through
[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:27.520]   brand awareness to demand activity.
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:30.600]   That's why it's been more that driving it,
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:33.040]   and then working on within the public sector.
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:35.600]   I'm the board of San Francisco Animal Care and Control.
[00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.200]   With celebrities, I worked on
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:39.040]   the launching of Family Guy internationally,
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.320]   and helping to elevate.
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.600]   How do we push Seth MacFarlane out there?
[00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:44.480]   Then finally, within tech, it's like,
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:46.760]   how do you make a technology story that's
[00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:49.880]   interesting enough that people want to hear about it?
[00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:53.880]   >> Yeah, I think the last part is fascinating to me as well,
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:56.720]   because when you think about Family Guy,
[00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:59.960]   it's very consumer-driven,
[00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:01.240]   and it's easy to relate to,
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:02.520]   to create a story around that.
[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:05.760]   It's maybe more intuitive than working with high-tech,
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:07.440]   and you're talking about B2B,
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:09.400]   and it could be more dry,
[00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:10.880]   let's say, of a topic.
[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:13.960]   How do you find those stories to tell that you
[00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:17.320]   feel captivates your audience's attention?
[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:21.120]   >> I think that there's a couple of different ways.
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:22.720]   One is understanding
[00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:24.640]   what are your organizational goals first.
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:25.760]   What do you want to get out of it?
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:27.240]   Is it broader awareness?
[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.120]   Is it working with your existing base
[00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:30.400]   of people that are consuming?
[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:32.840]   Are you trying to reach a new base?
[00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:35.720]   Often, I'm looking at market research,
[00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:38.200]   customer data, partner data,
[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:42.160]   unaided awareness, aided awareness,
[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:43.920]   meaning if we're looking at
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:45.760]   a general sector and we ask the audience,
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:47.200]   would you even be aware of what we're
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:50.240]   offering versus a set of companies?
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.920]   Also, in addition to market research,
[00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:54.920]   there's something to be said about your gut.
[00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:56.840]   There's something to be said about what's
[00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:59.240]   your instinct tell you based upon the goals.
[00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:01.960]   Often, I like to get to three to four stories to tell,
[00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:03.920]   meaning at Oracle,
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:06.160]   we worked on what are the toughest challenges
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:09.280]   that organizations are facing today as a top-line message.
[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:11.920]   Then you have different stories that live under it.
[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:15.280]   I think it's interesting to use that market data
[00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:18.480]   because if you lead with the data aligned to the goals,
[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.040]   you'll set yourself apart from
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:22.160]   other communicators because often,
[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.840]   we are a gray art in science.
[00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:27.920]   If you're the person that comes with data and is
[00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:31.040]   a little more informed in tech and the tech stack,
[00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:32.880]   and I don't mean like tech is in the industry,
[00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:35.200]   but I mean, how does the newsroom work?
[00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:37.400]   How do you use platforms
[00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:39.640]   like Meltwater to understand your sentiment?
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:41.160]   You'll differentiate yourself.
[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.720]   But I do think that differentiation will
[00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:46.680]   help you both from a career path and furthering your career.
[00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:49.360]   >> I'm a nerd like you and I get
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:51.120]   fascinated when it comes to data.
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:52.960]   I think in my own world of web marketing,
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:55.120]   like things like understanding what segments are
[00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:57.360]   engaging with your website and where are they converting on,
[00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:01.000]   and either supporting hypotheses you have about who they are,
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.440]   versus what they're looking for.
[00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:04.240]   What kind of data sets, if you don't mind,
[00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:06.720]   just double-clicking just a little bit deeper for you.
[00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:08.800]   When you're looking at data for
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:11.320]   understanding your audience that informs stuff,
[00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:13.600]   what data sources are you typically looking at?
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:16.560]   What data sets matter to you?
[00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:18.600]   Can you tell us a little bit about that?
[00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:21.120]   >> At the highest level,
[00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.040]   we started talking about
[00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:23.680]   Public Relations and Corporate Communications.
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:23.880]   >> Right.
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:25.680]   >> Often, I'm looking at,
[00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:27.720]   you can look at ways that your communications
[00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:29.240]   are affecting the stock price.
[00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:30.920]   That's an outcome-based metric.
[00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:32.600]   There are activity-based metrics,
[00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:34.840]   meaning meetings and content you're pushing out,
[00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:36.240]   but I'm looking at outcome-based metrics.
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:39.280]   How are you influencing the stock price with a product launch
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:43.360]   or with reputational activity like diversity, equity, inclusion?
[00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:43.760]   >> Got it.
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:45.560]   >> You can look at something more specifically within
[00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:48.640]   Public Relations such as how's your message pull through,
[00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:51.480]   and how's the sentiment wherever it's showing up?
[00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:53.320]   I would say now,
[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:55.800]   because I come from a couple of different fields,
[00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:57.320]   having worked in social media,
[00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:01.800]   it's also looking about what's your engagement within your core audience.
[00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:05.480]   I think the integrated marketing columns is so critical now,
[00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:08.320]   and understanding how that data goes when you think about
[00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:12.400]   the brand and the video shares to the engagement,
[00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:17.360]   and the social engagement from a lead gen activity and sales.
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:18.600]   I could go across.
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:21.560]   There's different data values such as within employee columns.
[00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:24.240]   It can be, what's the sentiment of the surveys if
[00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:27.280]   your employee is leaving an employee town hall or a post meet?
[00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:29.080]   With executive communications,
[00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:31.320]   where are your executives being placed?
[00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:33.600]   What kind of volume people are attending?
[00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:35.160]   How long is the content living?
[00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:36.680]   With an analyst relations,
[00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:39.720]   industry analysts, because there's financial analysts.
[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:41.040]   With an industry analyst,
[00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:44.040]   it could be, how are you placing within the top reporters?
[00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:45.680]   There's a lot of data.
[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:47.840]   With AR, there are firms that have platforms.
[00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:49.360]   There's also Tableau.
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:52.800]   It really starts with what problem are you trying to solve?
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:56.000]   What data sources can you use like Meltwater for PR,
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.600]   or Sprinkler for social,
[00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:00.840]   or Tableau helping to work with your AR engagements?
[00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:05.640]   Then how do you use that to educate and inform what you do next?
[00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:08.960]   >> Yeah. That's such great insight
[00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:11.800]   because it made me think about even in my time at LinkedIn.
[00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:14.320]   I've never really actually paid much attention
[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:17.000]   to the function of internal comms, let's say.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.240]   But now I'm thinking about it,
[00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:20.400]   it's like the thing that really set that company apart was,
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:23.880]   they did really great employee poll surveys,
[00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:27.880]   but they did fully transparent company readouts,
[00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:29.520]   the good and the bad.
[00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:31.640]   Everyone had visibility into
[00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:33.400]   what they're holding leaders accountable to,
[00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:34.720]   and here's where we did well,
[00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:36.200]   and here's where we underperformed.
[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:37.840]   The thing that you're talking about in terms like
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:41.120]   brand building and brand loyalty as an employee,
[00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:43.600]   you're like, "Oh, shoot, this company cares about me,
[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:44.720]   and they care about my input,
[00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:47.640]   and I see where I'm represented on the screen."
[00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:50.920]   That builds, again, a sense of ownership to the company.
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:54.120]   I can only imagine the impact of that externally as well.
[00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:56.120]   It's finally clicking for me,
[00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:58.360]   the way you described that, which is really, really cool.
[00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:02.280]   >> It's also interesting because in an era like with the media,
[00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:04.000]   where I call multi-hyphenates,
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.160]   you're not just reporting, you're also consulting,
[00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:08.000]   maybe you're taking in-house role.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.520]   Industry analysts are taking on multiple roles.
[00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:13.040]   Your employees are your advocates.
[00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:15.800]   The challenge, employee comms in some ways is sometimes
[00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:18.080]   the toughest role because they know all your hiccups.
[00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:19.760]   Some messages that may play to
[00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:21.120]   the informed general public or to
[00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:24.000]   the media will not play to your employees because they know,
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.120]   and they know the truth, but you know.
[00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:28.960]   There's an opportunity to really build
[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:31.680]   a groundswell support for the organization.
[00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:34.200]   If you have a great employee social media program,
[00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:36.760]   if you have a regimented way to get your messages out,
[00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:39.040]   if you have a feedback mechanism.
[00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:41.640]   In some of these organizations where you may have
[00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:45.120]   hundreds of thousands of employees or even tens of thousands,
[00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:47.320]   they can really be the make or break.
[00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:50.600]   For instance, I work on a campaign at a company where we
[00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:55.240]   primed the market with our employees before we even had day one.
[00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:56.640]   There is a risk of a leak,
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:58.120]   but if you do it the right way,
[00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:01.280]   they can be better than any news article
[00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:04.320]   or a single video because they will carry it forward.
[00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:08.000]   >> Is that the category of like when you think crisis comms,
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.400]   is that what the discipline falls under or is it different?
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:14.480]   >> Crisis comms is a practice
[00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:17.000]   and it can live under any of those comms functions.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.240]   I haven't caught response comms
[00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:22.160]   because everyone wants to work on a crisis and it might be,
[00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:27.240]   but crisis comms essentially often lives under corporate communications
[00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:30.880]   and they'll be the linchpin for you to have a product issue.
[00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:32.800]   If you have an executive transition,
[00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:35.680]   if there's activist shareholders,
[00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:37.560]   it often lives in corporate communications,
[00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:40.880]   but you can have a crisis for your employees that's internal.
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:43.080]   The key thing when you have crisis comms,
[00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:46.080]   in my opinion, is you do have a leader,
[00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:48.040]   it's cross-functional in nature,
[00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:50.080]   and it's about your principles of engagement.
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:53.200]   It's the transparency, it's the structure,
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:57.920]   and you need to have a playbook in place for as many of the situations.
[00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:01.400]   Being able to differentiate what's an external crisis,
[00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:02.840]   what's an internal crisis,
[00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:06.440]   and also what's truly a crisis and what's just an issue.
[00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:09.600]   >> I want to make a quick pivot here because I
[00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:12.360]   think now that we've did a really good job,
[00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:15.240]   or we, you, have done a really good job,
[00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:16.320]   picture the landscape here.
[00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:17.760]   >> We've done it, yeah.
[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:20.360]   >> I think having a conversation around,
[00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:24.080]   let's say if someone is considering a pivot into
[00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:27.360]   PR comms or this is their first time entering it,
[00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:29.640]   can we have a little conversation around
[00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:33.200]   just the skills they should be building up or looking for?
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:35.920]   In my mind, I'm thinking of someone like me who,
[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:37.800]   let's say I've worked in,
[00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:40.480]   let's say high-tech or whatnot in an industry that's not comms,
[00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:41.680]   and I'm thinking about pivoting.
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:44.040]   What skills do I have that could apply?
[00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:45.840]   You mentioned storytelling earlier.
[00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:47.640]   I'm assuming writing skills about that
[00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:50.160]   because can you talk about that a little bit?
[00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:53.200]   >> Let's start with a top three.
[00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:55.720]   I think that intelligence,
[00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:57.920]   curiosity, and passion are critical.
[00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:00.200]   I think if you start with those three baseline,
[00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:01.880]   everyone's an expert in comms,
[00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:04.120]   but the fact you're treating every day like
[00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:06.680]   a master class and you're doing it with energy,
[00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:09.040]   I think that's the key skill to start with.
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:11.520]   From there, I think there's a series of
[00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:14.680]   disciplines and skill sets that will help you.
[00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:17.480]   The ability to storytell,
[00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:21.040]   grit, the resiliency that you bring,
[00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:24.480]   writing skills, creative skills,
[00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:27.200]   attention to detail, I think is critical.
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:30.840]   I think also an awareness of global business.
[00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:32.880]   Then I think finally,
[00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:36.280]   a passion for data and analytics and technology.
[00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:38.360]   These are all nice to have,
[00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:40.000]   but I think if you start with that intelligence,
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.680]   that passion, and that curiosity,
[00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:44.240]   that will help you in a communications.
[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:46.240]   Because you have to learn the business,
[00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:47.800]   you're a partner to the business.
[00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:49.520]   One of the key challenges when you're in
[00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:52.200]   a comms role is when you're entering these situations.
[00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:54.360]   What's a business strategy decision
[00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:55.960]   versus a communication strategy?
[00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:58.920]   Meaning, is there a tough decision for the business and
[00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:01.080]   they need the C-levels or
[00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:02.560]   the executives need to make a decision and then
[00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:04.240]   communications can talk
[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:06.000]   about what's going to happen because of it,
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.800]   or has a decision been made and
[00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:10.120]   then communications can be part of it.
[00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:13.200]   Often, I've had the experience where you are advising
[00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:16.720]   different by-products of what happens with business strategy.
[00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:19.360]   You can say, "This is what happens if we play this out."
[00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:23.360]   >> What do you look for in,
[00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:25.040]   let's say, a new hire candidate?
[00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:30.280]   Let's put some swimming lanes on this question.
[00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:31.680]   If it's a, let's say,
[00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:34.880]   first early career applicant
[00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:38.840]   versus someone who's maybe five years into the career.
[00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:40.680]   We focus on the early career.
[00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:43.480]   What do you look for in a resume to even
[00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:46.080]   separate them from the pile of resumes,
[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:48.520]   to even get an opportunity to talk to you,
[00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:50.200]   to demonstrate they have curiosity?
[00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:53.240]   Because curiosity doesn't come across on paper very well.
[00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:54.840]   What do you look for?
[00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:58.040]   >> What I look for is being open to
[00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:00.920]   new ideas and a variety of experiences.
[00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:03.920]   In addition, have they taking writing projects on?
[00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:06.080]   For instance, were they on the school newspaper?
[00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:07.880]   Were they in a journalism program?
[00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:10.160]   Do they take within professional clubs
[00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:13.920]   some kind of role that help them work across?
[00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:16.960]   That passion, curiosity, intelligence,
[00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:19.280]   does it come across in what's
[00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:21.840]   the story behind the story in their resume?
[00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:24.600]   What other skills and hobbies they have that complements it?
[00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:27.360]   Because personality is critical.
[00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:28.680]   You can be an extrovert,
[00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:30.400]   you can be an introvert,
[00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:33.320]   but you should be curious.
[00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:35.920]   I think you can get that from a resume.
[00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:39.040]   Those internships, those experiences,
[00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:40.640]   you'll walk in the door at least to have
[00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:44.120]   a foundation for your work.
[00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:46.560]   >> I think that is really good.
[00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:48.960]   Actually, I want to reiterate that because it's so important.
[00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:52.120]   Because we came into this conversation with me saying,
[00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:53.920]   "Hey, I'm not sure if I pivot,
[00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:55.240]   do I have the qualifications or not?"
[00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:56.760]   What you're telling me is like, "Look,
[00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:59.440]   life experience is the life experience,
[00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:02.200]   and your ability to show all the areas
[00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:03.640]   where you've taken a risk,
[00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:04.560]   and you explore something,
[00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:06.240]   or you created something,
[00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:08.520]   that in itself on paper illustrates that,
[00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:10.040]   at least the variety,
[00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:11.960]   or the portfolio you attach to that,
[00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:15.160]   helps people understand that you are this curious individual.
[00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:17.560]   And anyone then can quite frankly do that
[00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:19.200]   if they have, to your point,
[00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:20.240]   if they're naturally curious,
[00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:21.320]   they should have that body of work,
[00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:23.360]   or it's not too late to start one,
[00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:25.280]   and maybe set yourself up like a few months
[00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:27.840]   or a quarter from now to demonstrate that.
[00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:30.000]   >> I would just underline that in bold
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.160]   with attention to detail,
[00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:33.360]   with any communications you're submitting for,
[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:36.120]   because that is your handshake to the organizations.
[00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:39.360]   The ability, the formatting,
[00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:40.800]   it's the how and the what,
[00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:42.040]   the how you're delivering it,
[00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:43.360]   that attention to detail is critical,
[00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:45.040]   because you can show that curiosity,
[00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:49.040]   but a typo, hanging sentences, small things,
[00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:50.120]   that's so critical.
[00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:52.920]   And I know that sounds small, but it is big.
[00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:56.040]   And for someone who's maybe five years
[00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:57.360]   to 10 years into the career,
[00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:58.920]   so now you're looking at someone
[00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:00.240]   who's looking at maybe promoting,
[00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:02.720]   or looking to get promoted to maybe a people manager,
[00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:04.680]   or maybe going or branching off,
[00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:06.600]   like what kind of advice would you give to them,
[00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:08.880]   and what skillsets are you looking for for that individual?
[00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:12.000]   And I know it might depend on the role they're applying for,
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:12.920]   but just broadly speaking,
[00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:14.440]   what are you looking for there?
[00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:17.200]   >> A couple of things.
[00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:19.800]   Are you close to the audience you're trying to reach,
[00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:21.440]   or are you close to the product?
[00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:22.640]   You should be close to one of them,
[00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:24.320]   and have had experiences,
[00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:26.600]   because the highest levels of satisfaction
[00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:27.560]   for people being managed,
[00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:29.720]   is when their manager knows how to do the job,
[00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:30.920]   and understands the business.
[00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:32.520]   So that would be number one.
[00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:35.480]   Number two is, whether it's been in the job,
[00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:38.840]   or outside the job, have you had leadership experiences?
[00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:40.680]   And if you're not getting that work,
[00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:41.720]   like I said, I'm involved with
[00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:43.280]   San Francisco Animal Care and Control,
[00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:46.440]   and Parks and Alliances, we're working on Jackson Park.
[00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:48.440]   There's things I've done outside of work,
[00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:51.200]   and they're almost great petri dishes of leadership,
[00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:54.520]   and one of my best leadership experiences
[00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:56.040]   was actually in my MBA,
[00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:59.000]   where I was the admissions lead for my year,
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.600]   and I made a lot of mistakes.
[00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:02.440]   I made, there's an actor that says,
[00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:03.480]   do you have experience?
[00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:05.480]   Congratulations, you made a mistake.
[00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:08.840]   I made a lot of mistakes, but I still use those.
[00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:12.760]   So the ability to show outside of work,
[00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:14.080]   those leadership experiences,
[00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:16.120]   or if you get them in work, that's great.
[00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:18.320]   And number three, showing that initiative,
[00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:20.880]   meaning, are you taking training classes?
[00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:22.840]   Are you doing stretch assignments?
[00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:25.840]   Are you taking on some of the hairiest challenges
[00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:27.600]   that your manager may have?
[00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:29.640]   So they feel comfortable that you are gonna be someone
[00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:31.280]   who's gonna step into the role,
[00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:34.040]   have the leadership, have some of the experience,
[00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:37.600]   and understand either the audience or the product.
[00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:40.520]   And then finally, that you will take charge
[00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:42.680]   and help them further their mission.
[00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:44.760]   I mean, there's some famous
[00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:48.240]   consumer packaged goods companies that say,
[00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:49.720]   the leader doesn't get promoted
[00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:52.360]   until they prepare someone to take over their role.
[00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:54.800]   And I think that's taken into account.
[00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:57.440]   - Yeah, I love everything that you said there.
[00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:59.200]   And you said one thing in particular
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:00.880]   that really stood out and resonated with me,
[00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:05.280]   which is talking about with your,
[00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:06.360]   let's say you're on an interview
[00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:09.320]   and walking through your experiences, right?
[00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:10.160]   - Yeah.
[00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:11.800]   - The context of how you talk through failures
[00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:13.600]   or even challenges is really important.
[00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:15.760]   'Cause I think you and I would agree as managers of people
[00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:18.080]   that the end result is one thing,
[00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:20.320]   it's understanding how you get there
[00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:21.720]   is probably the most important part.
[00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:23.240]   Like, how are you processing things?
[00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:24.840]   If you're stepping through, let's say,
[00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:28.040]   a difficult example of something you had to overcome,
[00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:29.120]   spending more time understanding like,
[00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:30.880]   hey, here's how I'm processing the situation.
[00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:32.320]   Here are all the factors.
[00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:33.800]   Here I was working through things
[00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:35.600]   and maybe it didn't turn out the way I wanted to.
[00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:36.440]   Okay, cool.
[00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:38.440]   Then here's what I did with that then.
[00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:41.480]   Understanding how you're wired
[00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:43.320]   and tells a lot about your individual.
[00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:44.760]   Because the outcome, everyone will say,
[00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:46.480]   here's a shiny outcome.
[00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:49.040]   But what differentiates is like how you get there.
[00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:50.720]   That's the you.
[00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:53.520]   - I think it's, for me in those situations,
[00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:55.800]   it's about trusting my gut.
[00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:57.200]   It's about, it's okay to fail,
[00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:59.520]   but fail fast and learn, like you were saying.
[00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:02.560]   Have some fun in the process.
[00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:05.520]   Like this is, that smile and that will come across.
[00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:08.200]   And across all the questions you've asked
[00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:10.640]   and hopefully what people understand
[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:13.840]   is understand your three or four value propositions
[00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:14.680]   moving into a room.
[00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:17.760]   Meaning, I hope I stand for authenticity
[00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:19.440]   in the spaces I enter.
[00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:22.240]   I hope that that resiliency comes across.
[00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:23.440]   So if you know consistently,
[00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:24.600]   you can't stand for everything.
[00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:26.800]   If you know your three to four value propositions,
[00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:28.640]   then when you are in a point of failure,
[00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:29.960]   you can fall back on those.
[00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:34.320]   And like I said, take all feedback seriously,
[00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:35.760]   but don't take it personally.
[00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:37.920]   That's critical because that will help you get,
[00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:40.760]   learn and succeed forward.
[00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:42.600]   - Yeah, and actually I've observed
[00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:43.880]   a lot of those qualities in you.
[00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:45.880]   Almost just to kind of reaffirm you,
[00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:46.720]   going through this process.
[00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:48.920]   'Cause like I respected you very early on
[00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:50.680]   because like you had a really creative mind.
[00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:53.440]   You had, you're also very disciplined in your creativity.
[00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:55.480]   So it wasn't just some weird random ideas,
[00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:58.040]   but you can see the vision at the end of that.
[00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:01.160]   I think knowing that you're super attention to detail,
[00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:02.640]   you built a really wonderful relationships.
[00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:03.880]   Like you had to your point,
[00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:06.800]   all the core values or tenets of you as an individual
[00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:09.480]   that obviously like your success is like,
[00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:10.320]   it's not surprising to me.
[00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:12.080]   Like just the way you're built.
[00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:13.400]   And so there's actually a good segue.
[00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:16.240]   'Cause I would love to hear about how you stepped
[00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:18.960]   into the world of PR and corporate comms.
[00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:21.440]   Like, and from the very beginning, like what,
[00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:23.640]   maybe even like, what did you think it was about?
[00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:24.960]   And at what you stepped in,
[00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:26.960]   did like expectation meet reality?
[00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:29.040]   And like, and how did you even get your first job?
[00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:30.000]   Let's hear about your journey.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.120]   I mean, I'm just really interested about this.
[00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:34.160]   - So there's like three ways I want to take your question.
[00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:36.880]   So go with, bear with me on this journey.
[00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:38.640]   One is where you started.
[00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:41.080]   The creativity and discipline.
[00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:42.760]   I believe in search and reapply.
[00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:45.040]   And I grew up on the 20th Century Fox a lot.
[00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:48.360]   When you're producing a TV show,
[00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:52.240]   there's the creative realm and there's the production realm.
[00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:56.960]   And watching how they do that taught me how I do my job.
[00:24:56.960 --> 00:25:00.280]   And so basically how it all started was I've, like I said,
[00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:01.120]   I've always been fascinated
[00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:03.640]   about the wide psychology communications.
[00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:06.360]   My, one of my first roles was
[00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:08.640]   I actually had a speech writing internship
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:11.240]   in the White House, doing research and memos.
[00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:14.080]   And I had applied a bunch of times, got that.
[00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:16.960]   And I parlayed that into 20th Century Fox.
[00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:18.640]   And you were asking me about the myths,
[00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:21.040]   which was another direction I wanted to take this.
[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:23.080]   The cons is glamorous, that it's easy,
[00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:24.480]   that you have to be an extrovert.
[00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:26.040]   And none of those are true.
[00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:30.000]   And in my time at 20th Century Fox, I launched Family Guy,
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.720]   but I found myself everywhere in con, at a festival,
[00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:38.200]   to being on the law and working on some major initiatives
[00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:40.720]   to running, helping to run our Hollywood Foreign Press
[00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:42.800]   Golden Globes campaigns.
[00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:45.160]   I found the pull of tech to be more powerful
[00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:46.680]   than like entertainment.
[00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:47.560]   I love entertainment.
[00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:48.640]   I love TV.
[00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:49.560]   Some people love sports.
[00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:50.400]   I love television.
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:53.400]   I love the medium and what it can do for society.
[00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:54.560]   That said, I am a tech geek.
[00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:56.760]   So I found my way up to Silicon Valley
[00:25:56.760 --> 00:26:00.440]   and worked across the stack apps, network server storage,
[00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:04.480]   Cisco, IBM, VMware, NetApp, Oracle.
[00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:06.600]   And what was always driving me in the roles
[00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:07.800]   was a tougher challenge,
[00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:11.000]   an opportunity to take a deeply technical concept.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:16.720]   And additionally, a VC I worked with at my agency days
[00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:20.160]   taught me in-house agency startup,
[00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:23.040]   growth company, stable company, turnaround.
[00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:24.960]   Learn, and so what you'll see
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:26.480]   when you're working with me on a team,
[00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:28.560]   and I only get to work with many of you,
[00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:32.440]   is I'm constantly searching and reapplying.
[00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:34.200]   I'm pulling from the playbook of,
[00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:35.520]   'cause when I got my MBA,
[00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:38.800]   I spent some time at P&G in a summer camp
[00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:41.000]   and then did an internship at PepsiCo.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.120]   I'm constantly thinking about
[00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:45.240]   how did they do their communications project
[00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:47.080]   and how can I move forward?
[00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:50.320]   You've seen Shakespearean books become hit movies.
[00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:52.360]   Think about, collect those ideas
[00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:54.480]   because you will be able to use them.
[00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:56.880]   And I think, again, it all goes back to that psychology
[00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:59.400]   and the ability to excite someone
[00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:01.000]   about what you're offering.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.120]   And I think even at its toughest moments
[00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:05.920]   when I've worked on crisis comms with employees,
[00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:08.080]   with our products, it's fun.
[00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:11.040]   - Did you think your MBA,
[00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:14.440]   did it add to your existing PR journey
[00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:18.480]   or was it at the start and it kind of got you into it?
[00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:19.440]   - It was midway.
[00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:23.440]   And many people who get an MBA don't work in comms
[00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:25.920]   and it was not as additive as it was for me.
[00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:28.080]   Many people who got it had already done econ
[00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:30.120]   and stats, et cetera.
[00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:33.040]   When I work on corporate earnings, I use my MBA.
[00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:36.040]   When I am expanding my network and looking,
[00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:38.680]   if I ever go on an agency side, new business,
[00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:39.760]   that will help me.
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:41.760]   So I'm forever grateful for that experience.
[00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:43.160]   It was incredibly tough for me
[00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:45.600]   because I do not have that background.
[00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:46.560]   In fact, when people ask me,
[00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:48.160]   what's your greatest weakness during an interview,
[00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:50.560]   I say financial modeling and budgeting
[00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:51.400]   and how I addressed those.
[00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:53.440]   I went to go get an MBA to understand it.
[00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:56.680]   So I think that it was additive.
[00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:58.240]   It was really helpful for me.
[00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:00.920]   And some of my best friends I ever made,
[00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:02.080]   I made through that program.
[00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:04.120]   And we're phone in touch in the Bay Area.
[00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:07.040]   - What would you say are,
[00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:12.080]   let's say the highlights of your career,
[00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:15.160]   like the top three achievements or crowning achievements
[00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:18.360]   that would define things you're really, really proud of?
[00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:21.120]   And if you're willing to share maybe a few examples
[00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:22.920]   of areas that you struggled
[00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:26.640]   or what we would classify as a failure or whatnot,
[00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:27.480]   can you just kind of share a little bit
[00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:29.600]   about your experience in those areas?
[00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:30.600]   - I'm gonna start with the failure.
[00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:31.440]   I don't know if it was a failure,
[00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:32.480]   but I'll classify this
[00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:34.760]   'cause I think a lot of people experience this.
[00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:36.760]   I spent eight years at 20th Century Fox.
[00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:38.800]   So after that time,
[00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:42.560]   I wanted to go through a series of experiences
[00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:45.200]   and not necessarily stay at one place for a long time
[00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:46.720]   because I'd already done that.
[00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:50.280]   I experienced some challenges with recruiting.
[00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:52.640]   So I wanted to bring this up because people have done it
[00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:53.480]   and you'll be interviewed.
[00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:56.440]   They're like, you're only here for a certain amount of time.
[00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:58.360]   But it was about experiencing different cultures
[00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:00.200]   and learning the ways that people do things.
[00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:04.000]   And so trust your gut if that's the right.
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.880]   For me, it worked because now I have that backlog,
[00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:10.000]   but it was really challenging with recruiting.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.440]   And as far as your first question
[00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:13.240]   about some of the greatest experiences,
[00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:15.480]   I'm gonna use one outside of work.
[00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:16.320]   I'm still on the board
[00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:18.160]   of San Francisco Animal Care and Control.
[00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:19.640]   And I was a small part of the work
[00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:22.960]   that we did to raise tens of millions of dollars,
[00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:26.520]   about 70 million to help build a new animal shelter.
[00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:30.000]   And I, again, worked on the initial messaging
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.120]   and I love animals.
[00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:34.400]   And I think the reason I bring this up first
[00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:36.600]   is it's important to find your side projects,
[00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:39.240]   your side hustles that also,
[00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:41.120]   when you have a tough day at work, you can turn over here.
[00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:45.600]   So when I've had a tough day working on crisis or maybe M&A,
[00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:47.080]   I go look at the animals
[00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:48.840]   and how many dogs are in the shelter
[00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:52.120]   and I can work on a project like our major donor events.
[00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:54.240]   And it just helps me balance out.
[00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:58.280]   Number two, I will go back to Family Guy
[00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:00.040]   and Launching Bones,
[00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:02.960]   because I remember when my VP asked me to take the lead
[00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:04.280]   and I actually said no,
[00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:06.280]   'cause I didn't feel like I was ready.
[00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:08.360]   And I'm proud of that work
[00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:11.520]   because it was working with different groups
[00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:15.280]   and it was pushing myself beyond my comfort zone.
[00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:19.160]   And I think if any mistakes I made early on
[00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:20.320]   was I wasn't bold enough
[00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:22.440]   because I wasn't sure I was ready for it.
[00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:28.280]   And then finally, I guess leading VMworld at VMware
[00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:31.800]   and being the global comms lead, I should say, for VMworld,
[00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:35.600]   because the model I set up continues to be carried forward.
[00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:37.040]   And I'm always,
[00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:38.840]   a lot of people talk about leadership approach,
[00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:41.680]   like I'm a servant leader or I'm a change agent,
[00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:43.680]   whatever that is, and that's fabulous.
[00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:45.400]   I like to think about leadership purpose.
[00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:47.200]   What is your purpose as a leader?
[00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:49.160]   And for me, it's about elevating the next generation
[00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:51.840]   of talent or taking talent forward.
[00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:56.080]   I feel like I was able to build a model for VMworld
[00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:58.280]   that's carried on and became Explorer.
[00:30:58.280 --> 00:30:59.400]   And I'm proud of that.
[00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:01.160]   - Yeah, that's cool.
[00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:04.000]   I mean, you're talking about things like legacy, right?
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.200]   And your ultimate life mission.
[00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:08.840]   Excuse me.
[00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:10.480]   Just one last question for you.
[00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:13.800]   So for me, like just to age myself,
[00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:15.040]   I'm looking at like,
[00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:18.800]   it would be great if I could retire after the next 20 years.
[00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:21.640]   And for me, that then means
[00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:23.520]   I'm looking for different things in my career,
[00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:24.520]   different experiences,
[00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:26.920]   and I'm wondering where I should take things,
[00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:28.760]   podcasts included, right?
[00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:30.800]   And so for you,
[00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:32.320]   you're like, what are you looking for now?
[00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:34.480]   When you're looking at the next five to 10 years,
[00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:36.000]   like what's important to you?
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.240]   Is it still aligned to this area?
[00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:40.840]   Or to your point, is it supplemental?
[00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:41.680]   Is there something else
[00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:43.920]   that kind of like intellectually stimulating you?
[00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:46.240]   Like, what are you looking for now?
[00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:47.800]   - Definitely intellectually stimulating.
[00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:49.160]   I want to continue on this path
[00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:51.960]   because at some point I'd love to be a vice president
[00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:53.680]   or chief communications officer.
[00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:59.040]   I do not come, I'm LGBTQIA.
[00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:01.480]   I have some other points of diversity.
[00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:04.000]   I like to think just by showing up in the room
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.240]   and having a seat at the table,
[00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:09.200]   I can help change things quietly for the next generation.
[00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:10.840]   In addition, I'd like to balance that.
[00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:14.080]   I'm currently working on the board of Jackson Park
[00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:16.240]   as part of SF Parks and Alliances.
[00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:17.600]   So continuing that city work,
[00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:19.120]   we're raising 45 million.
[00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:21.200]   We've raised 30 of the 45 already
[00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:23.040]   for a new park in Potrero Hill.
[00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:24.800]   So it's really that passion and that purpose.
[00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:25.920]   That purpose is the city.
[00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:29.720]   That passion is the work I do in corporate communications.
[00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:30.960]   The reason I chose entertainment
[00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:33.040]   is I thought it could change society and it does.
[00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:34.440]   The reason I'm in corporate America
[00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:38.840]   is I know that communications can change the company
[00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:41.080]   and the world as a whole.
[00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:43.360]   And if you look at the Edelman Trust Barometer
[00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:45.160]   and several other studies,
[00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:47.360]   people look to companies now
[00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:50.840]   more than they look to several other outlets such as media.
[00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:52.800]   So if you can, as a comms expert,
[00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:56.480]   help lead the company and be some of the moral conscience,
[00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:59.400]   I'm hoping to do some good work in the next 10 to 15 years.
[00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:01.720]   - Well, I think you have everything it takes to succeed.
[00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:03.440]   So I'm personally looking forward
[00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:05.720]   to kind of seeing where you take everything.
[00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:07.400]   Alex, I just want to thank you for your time today.
[00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:08.760]   I personally learned a lot from you.
[00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:12.000]   I'm pretty sure our listeners have as well.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.360]   Is there anything you want to call out
[00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:14.960]   in terms of how people can get ahold of you?
[00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:17.200]   Or you mentioned like some societies for dogs
[00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:18.360]   that you're passionate about.
[00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:19.840]   Is there anything you want to call out here?
[00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:22.560]   - So first of all, San Francisco Animal Care and Control
[00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:25.120]   is the public facility that brings in the animals,
[00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:26.480]   10,000 animals a year.
[00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:27.600]   Please look into it.
[00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:32.760]   And Parks and Alliances, Jackson Park and Potrero
[00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:33.600]   would be another.
[00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:34.880]   Feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn.
[00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:36.240]   I always love talking to people.
[00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:39.360]   I feel like you have to treat every day like a master class
[00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:41.320]   and I always learn through every conversation.
[00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:43.720]   So I'd welcome people reaching out.
[00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:45.040]   - And we'll put some of those links
[00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:46.200]   in the video description below
[00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:47.520]   so people can find those organizations
[00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:48.920]   you're talking about.
[00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:50.440]   So Alex, thanks a lot.
[00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:51.720]   - I've always loved our friendship.
[00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:53.640]   I remember the first meeting I was in with you.
[00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:56.960]   It was June 2012.
[00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:59.920]   I remember sitting down and it was a VMworld meeting
[00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:01.520]   and I remember our first engagement.
[00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:03.120]   So I really appreciate you inviting me on.
[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:04.400]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:06.520]   Alex, thanks and have a great one the rest of the day.
[00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:07.360]   - All right, thanks Tim.
[00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:08.320]   - All right, thank you.
[00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:10.920]   (upbeat music)
[00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:14.000]   (upbeat music fades)
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
