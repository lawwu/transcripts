[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500]   So I've given a lot of advice on the show over the past three and a half years.
[00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.000]   I've given 329 episodes worth of advice.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.500]   So I thought it might be fun to try to do something sort of crazy today
[00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.500]   to try to summarize most of the main ideas I talk about
[00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.500]   in five minutes or less.
[00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.000]   I'm gonna call this "The Tau of Cal."
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   Okay, to be fair, I'm not gonna get into specific pieces of advice, right?
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   Like, we're not gonna get into the details of particular ways of doing X and Y.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.500]   It's gonna be the big ideas, the high-level ideas
[00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.000]   that almost all of the specific advice I give comes back to it.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.500]   So I thought this would be fun.
[00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.500]   After I do the list, and I'm probably gonna have Jesse time me here,
[00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.000]   so be ready for that, Jesse.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.500]   After I do the list of the main ideas I've talked about over the last three and a half years,
[00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.500]   I'm then gonna step back and try to provide some theoretical connective tissue
[00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.000]   that will pull them all together.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   So take this list that might seem pretty disparate,
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.500]   and I'm gonna try to give you a grand unified theory of Cal
[00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.500]   that makes sense of all of these ideas.
[00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.000]   But first, I want to get through them.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.500]   Jesse, you got your watch ready?
[00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.500]   - I have my Casio.
[00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.500]   - Yeah, I was gonna say, I admire all the money you've invested in your watch.
[00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.500]   - Whenever the band breaks, I just get a new watch
[00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.000]   'cause they're only $16.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   - I had that watch in 1987.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.500]   - It's my fourth iteration.
[00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.000]   - Okay, well, well played.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   So we'll be accurately timed on Jesse's highly expensive watch.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.500]   All right, here we go, Tau of Cal.
[00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.500]   All right, let's roll.
[00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:32.500]   First, I want to summarize my big ideas when it comes to advice about knowledge work.
[00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.500]   Number one, treat context shifts and overload,
[00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.500]   which I define to be working on too many things concurrently,
[00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.500]   as productivity poison.
[00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.500]   These are the main things you want to limit to keep your work sustainable
[00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.000]   and your results impressive.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   Number two, spending a good amount of time focusing without distraction
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   is like a knowledge work superpower,
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   but it will require you to both train your ability to concentrate
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   and tame your schedule in ways that makes time
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   to do this type of concentration, and neither of those things are easy.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   Number three, organize your obligations and time carefully with smart systems
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   because the human brain cannot easily on its own
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   handle the volume or velocity of tasks
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   that are encountered in most modern knowledge work jobs.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Number four, remote work requires more structure
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   than in-person work to function sustainably.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   You need in particular to be careful about how you assign tasks
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   and communicate about works in progress.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   Smaller workload, less unscheduled communication,
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   and more accountability is key when it comes to remote work.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   And finally, when it comes to using your brain to create value,
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   your spaces matter.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   If possible, your deepest work should be done in intentionally designed locations.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   All right, here's my advice related to the Internet.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   Small trumps big when it comes to online activity.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   Self-governing niche communities online function much better
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   than massive global conversation platforms
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   and have much fewer negative side effects on its users.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   Distributed news media such as podcasts and newsletters
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   offer better ways to make a living doing creative work online
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   than trying to become an influencer on a major platform.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Internet advice number two, keep kids off smartphones.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   Their brains aren't ready for unrestricted access to the Internet.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Internet advice number three, don't use social media if possible.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   Instead, prioritize things like reading books, spending time outside,
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   becoming a leader in your relevant communities,
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   and developing hard and interesting skills.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   And finally, your phone should not be a constant companion in your life.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   Final category here, advice related to living a deep life.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   Plan backwards from an ideal lifestyle instead of forward toward grand goals.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   Be wary in particular of the idea that just accomplishing one grand goal
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   is going to make your life better.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   It's better to work backwards from the lifestyle that you have.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   More evidence will succeed.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   And my final piece of big picture advice, Jesse,
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   in general, sticking with something over a long amount of time,
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   working sustainably but steadily, wins out in the end
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   in terms of both enjoyment and reward.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   How'd we do?
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   244.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   Look at that.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   Not even three minutes.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   Most of the main ideas I talk about on this show.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   I'm obviously missing things.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   Most notably, I'm not including on this list my older work on student-related advice.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   I have a lot of big ideas about how to be successful as a student.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   Beyond that, I don't know.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   What am I missing, Jesse?
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   Is anything coming to mind, like a major idea we talk about a lot?
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   Maybe just some thought but not a huge amount of thought.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   Yeah, because you just go deeper into the other things
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   in terms of the specifics of each of the overall broad concepts.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   I thought it was good.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   I looked at a lot of old episodes.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   Really, almost everything fits under outside of tech explainer episodes,
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   but that's not really advice.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   I'm glad you're going to go into a deeper conversation about them all
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   because I was a little sad that the deep dive was only going to be five minutes.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   That'd be great.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   Five-minute deep dive.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   Do a couple of minutes.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   We could be out of here in a tight seven minutes.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   It's my favorite podcast.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   If I look at the time stamps and they're only like 37 minutes,
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   I usually go an hour.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   I'm usually kind of sad.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   Well, don't worry.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   When it comes to padding, like just talking longer than we should,
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   you don't have to worry about me.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   I'm an expert at that.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   All right.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   So let's see if we can do some deeper connections here.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   So I have these categories, knowledge work, internet,
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   and sort of more general advice related to good living.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   Within these are a lot of different topics, productivity, phones, email,
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   lifestyle, design, career issues, et cetera.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   All right.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   Are these all just disparate advice or is there a way to connect it?
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   I'm going to argue that most of this advice, actually,
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   we can find a connection to them.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   If we go back to my fundamental background as a technologist,
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   obviously I'm trained as a computer science.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   I'm a full professor of computer science at Georgetown University.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   In addition to my many papers on distributed algorithm theory,
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   I have increasingly become involved in thinking about technology
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   and its impact on our world.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   I'm a founding faculty member of Georgetown Center for Digital Ethics.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   I also direct our new computer science ethics and society academic program.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   So I'm a technologist who thinks about technology's impact.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   Now you might be thrown, how is that connected to all of these issues?
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   Because some of these issues are not explicitly technological,
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   but I'm going to argue that they are almost all connected
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   in a pretty direct way to technology-related issues.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   All right.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   So let me explain this.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   I mentioned some of this terminology briefly in last week's episode.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   I'm going to lay it out here a little bit more clearly
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   and concisely in today's episode.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   Here is the way I think about the world and the source of a lot of my advice.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   We currently live in what I call the modern digital environment.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   It's an environment where we have many digital tools,
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   mainly network-connected, that create a technology ecology
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   that have a big impact on our day-to-day life.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   Many elements of this modern digital environment, which is very new,
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   conflict with both our Paleolithic brains and our Neolithic culture.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   So what I mean by that, our Paleolithic brains,
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   is our brains as wired over hundreds of thousands of years of evolution.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   When I say Neolithic culture, I mean the culture that evolved
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   after the Neolithic revolution when we first began to live
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   in larger groups connected by abstract concepts.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   So as we transition from small tribes of hunter-gatherers
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   to living in cities and city-states connected by larger affiliations,
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   cooperating at much greater scales, culturally speaking,
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   the Neolithic revolution is sort of the foundation of life as we know it.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   It's a big difference, Neolithic living versus Paleolithic living.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   You can see Yuval Harari's book "Sapiens" for a really good discussion
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   of what enabled Neolithic culture.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   So we've had more or less the slowly evolving Neolithic culture,
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   where we have countries and cities and etc.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   That also conflicts with the modern digital environment.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   These mismatches create what I think of as disorders,
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   mismatches between the modern digital environment and our brains and culture.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   Those disorders cause issues that need to be addressed,
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   and they can be addressed by individual action.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   They can be addressed by community or organizational action,
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   and sometimes they have to be addressed by larger sort of national,
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   legislative, perhaps regulatory action.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   We have a lot of ways we have to react to those disorders.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   They also create sometimes opportunities to leverage new technologies
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   and new ways that open up exciting new possibilities for thriving
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   ones that did not exist even 20 or 25 years ago.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   So I see a lot of my program as understanding these mismatches
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   between the modern digital environment and what our bodies and cultures are used to,
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   figuring out where they create problems and trying to get around it,
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   figuring out where they create opportunities and seeing what we can leverage
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   and how we can do it.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   Now the reason why this can sometimes seem disconnected from technology
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   is that I have learned over time that in particular when it comes to the disorders
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   of the modern digital environment, the problems are caused by digital technology.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   The solutions are often analog.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   So it sounds like analog advice.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   We're going off and we're reading books
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   or we're pen and paper planning of what we want our life to be like,
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   but the underlying problems that led us to that actually are digital in origin.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   So digital problems don't always have digital solutions.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   So let's go back.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   I was going to go back to some of the advice I talked about
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   and sort of walk through this exercise of tracing back the advice
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   to one of these mismatches with the modern digital environment.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   Hey, it's Cal.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   I wanted to interrupt briefly to say that if you're enjoying this video,
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   then you need to check out my new book, Slow Productivity,
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   The Lost Art of Accomplishment Without Burnout.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   This is like the Bible for most of the ideas we talk about here in these videos.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   You can get a free excerpt at calnewport.com/slow.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   I know you're going to like it.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   Check it out.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   Now let's get back to the video.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   So let's think about some of my advice around knowledge work, for example.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   The core disorder back here is we have this Neolithic culture.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   Okay, we get together.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   We have organizations.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   In this context, we develop this idea of pseudoproductivity.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   So knowledge work emerges as a new type of work.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   We evolve this idea of pseudoproductivity,
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   which I talk about in my book, Slow Productivity,
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   as a way of coping with management of work that uses the mind
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   because we didn't have widgets to count.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   Pseudoproductivity says let's use visible effort as our main proxy
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   for you doing something useful.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   My argument is we kind of have this non-technological cultural adaptation.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   I guess we'll manage activity instead of results
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   because it's too hard in knowledge work to actually point towards results.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   Then that mismatched with the arrival of digital computer networks.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   So once we had low-friction digital communication
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   and it was very easy to communicate with people
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   and then that communication became mobile, first on laptops, then on smartphones,
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   so now I could communicate with basically zero cost or time cost
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   at almost any time and almost any location,
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   that combination with pseudoproductivity gave us the hyperactive hive mind,
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   a new style of working in which you're constantly communicating,
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   figure things out on the fly.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   This completely conflicts with our Neolithic brain,
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   which can't shift its attention between so many things back and forth so quickly.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   It's just not capable of doing that.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   We get a big source of the over-distraction burnout problem
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   that is afflicting modern knowledge workers.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   So you get a lot of my advice about taming the hyperactive hive mind
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   and context switching and how to restructure work
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   to have more structured communication rules.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   It all comes back to that fundamental disorder.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   Here's another example.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   We talk about leaving social media, so that's digital,
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   but we can go to what is like an underlying disorder.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   Well, one of the underlying disorders that has been exposed
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   in the modern digital environment with respect to social media
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   is the issue of global conversation platforms
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   tricking our Paleolithic brains.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   So our Paleolithic brains are used to organizing social units
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   into like tribal communities.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   It's a group of people that I am around physically
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   and in totality really affect my success as an individual.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   I need to be on the good side. I need to be respected.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   Osterization would be tantamount to death.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   I need to be in good with my tribe.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   It's 50 people. It's 20 people. It's 100 people.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   We live in the same cave.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   That's how we organize. We think about the main unit of group.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   Then you get global conversation platforms
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   where you might have an example like TwitterX, 600 million users.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   Well, clearly this is a number that is so astronomical
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   that we can't even approach dealing with
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   sensical interactions with that many people.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   So what do these platforms do?
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   Using various sort of curation that's algorithmic and cybernetic,
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   they sort of pull from this massive collection of people
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   all talking about various things,
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   and it sort of pulls out for each user
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   an interaction experience that feels like what we're used to.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   It's I'm talking to people in my tribe.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   I'm talking to people in my community.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   But they pull it out to be like the most interesting,
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   engaging, emotional conversations possible so it's never boring.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   Again, our mind gets tricked by this.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   Like, okay, I'm talking to my tribe,
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   and also my tribe is like fantastically angry with everyone and with me,
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   and all the alarm bells go off.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   So it's a mismatch, a global conversation platform.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   It's a digital technology that mismatches with the way
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   our paleolithic mind works, and that creates problems.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   Let's do a more abstract one, lifestyle-centric planning.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   This seems to be very non-digital,
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   working backwards from a vision of an ideal lifestyle
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   instead of forward towards a grand goal.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   But why is this such a problem?
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   Why do we need advice about how to construct a life
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   of meaning and satisfaction?
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   Why do we need this advice?
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   Well, I think it is digital knowledge work,
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   digital knowledge work, so knowledge work that's done
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   largely at computer screens,
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   had a couple attributes that, again, are a real mismatch with us.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   One, work itself became highly abstract.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   It's moving bits around on networks,
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   it's messages going back and forth,
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   and files being attached to things.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   Work becomes very abstract, so we sort of lose that connection
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   that our mind has between having an intention
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   and seeing it be made manifest concretely in the world.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   I built this thing, and I can hold it,
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   and it has mass and gravity.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   When we remove that from our efforts,
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   it dislocates and disembodies us from our efforts,
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   and that can be really alienating,
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   to borrow a term from Marx in that context.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   It's very alienating to be like,
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   work is like this abstract thing.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   It also homogenizes.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   Give me almost any knowledge work job.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   What are the key tools going to be?
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   It's going to be an email client
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   and some variation of Microsoft Office.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   Work is just now this homogenized—
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   it doesn't really matter what the job is.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   You're moving messages and attachments back and forth
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   and making slide decks and going on Zoom
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   and seeing people in Windows.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   It's homogenized. All jobs are the same.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   The actual activities are sort of isolated now
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   from the actual world.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   You don't see concrete results.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   You're kind of alienated from your effort.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   It's this sort of weird game you do.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   Apparently, because it's all digital,
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   location matters less.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   We're less likely to go to a particular office.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   We're less likely to be—our work to be tied to a location.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   I make shoes, and the shoes are for people
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   who live in this town.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   That type of concrete regionalization
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   of our efforts has also dissipated.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   Well, this really upsets our ability
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   in our Paleolithic mind or for our Neolithic culture,
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   which is still built around building these communities
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   and towns and being part of these larger communities.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   All of this is upset by this much more abstracted,
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   digital, non-embodied style of work.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   And so people are adrift.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   They're living in this disembodied digital world,
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   playing digital games,
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   and not feeling as if they're a part of a place,
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   a part of a group, or producing things they can even see.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   And their mind doesn't know what to do with this.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   And we become adrift.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   It makes us feel sort of numb and dislocated.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   And so we pursue grand goals because we think
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   the chemical hit of pursuing that goal
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   at least will make us feel alive.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   And so we make these kind of drastic moves
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   to try to put some energy back into our lives.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   Or we get lost in the online,
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   just like, "Let me just plug it in my veins.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   I'm just on the phone, and it's, 'Oh, my God.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   Look at the thing Elon just posted.'"
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   And it's pressing primal buttons in a muted way,
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   and we just kind of get lost in this.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   As long as our work is so abstract,
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   we just get lost in an abstract world.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   And that also doesn't end up well.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   So we get something like lifestyle-centric planning.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   It's like taking back control of our life
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   in a way that wasn't as automatic
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   as it used to be in a pre-digital world.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   The modern digital environment made that a necessity
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   that we now have to think much more
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   about how we construct a life of meaning
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   as opposed to just letting our location and work
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   sort of do that for us.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   So we go through this again and again,
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   but almost all of those ideas I talked about
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   comes back to, fundamentally,
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   to a mismatch between the modern digital environment
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   and our brains and culture.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   All right?
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   So that's kind of the tau of Cal.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   And really, the big idea—
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   maybe this is the big idea of my style of advice—
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   is you don't have to stay in the world of digital
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   to deal with the issues that digital creates.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   You can be a technologist who's giving advice,
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   and that advice doesn't have to be limited
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   to parental controls and how you set up your iPhone
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   and thinking about doomsday scenarios around AI.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   The modern digital environment touches many aspects
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   of our day-to-day life.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   And so the advice we give from a place of technology
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   criticism is advice that can go much broader
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   than the world of technology.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   So there we go.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   Tau of Cal.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   I'm sure I missed some things.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   We'll hear about it, Jesse.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   But I think that covers a lot of the main things.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   I liked it.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   All right.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   So we got some questions coming.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   They're pretty broad.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   Since I covered—
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   there's literally no question we can get, almost.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   It's not going to be relevant to this deep dive
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   because I covered everything we ever talked about.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   But first, let's hear from a sponsor.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   This show is sponsored by BetterHelp.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   So we're in the holiday season.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   For many, that's great.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   I do Thriller December in the holiday season
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   where I read purposefully stupid books, often by a fire.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   I've already finished my first Thriller December books.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   Other people, it's about the family.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   It's about the holiday traditions.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   But it can also be a really hard time
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   if you have a troubled relationship with your own mind.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   For a lot of people, the holidays can be really tough
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   in this situation because it just emphasizes
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   the pain you're feeling or the discontent you're feeling
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   because you think about, "Remember when I used to just
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   enjoy the holidays and now I have all these other things going on."
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   So it is a great time, a great motivator
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   to make sure that your relationship with your brain
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   is in good shape.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   And of course, one of the best ways to get that relationship better
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   is through therapy.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   If you're thinking of starting therapy,
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   give BetterHelp a try.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   It's entirely online.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   It's designed to be convenient, flexible, and suited to your schedule.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   You just fill out a brief questionnaire to get matched with a licensed therapist
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   and switch therapist anytime for no additional charge.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   You can find comfort this December with BetterHelp.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   Visit betterhelp.com/deepquestions
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   One word, and you will get 10% off your first month.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   That's betterhelp.com/deepquestions
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   I also want to talk about our friends at ZocDoc.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   Look, as you get older, as Jessie and I are realizing,
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   you need more doctors in your life,
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   no matter how we try to avoid it.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   Jessie and I were actually just joking.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   We both have, oh my god, I won't get into the details, Jessie,
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   for medical privacy reasons, but let's just say
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   we're seriously considering podcasting from side-by-side beds in the hospital.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   We have different things we have to get taken care of.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   You need a lot of doctors.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   For stuff you don't even know you need doctors for,
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   you know there's feet doctors?
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   You don't know this until you get to your 40s, right?
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   You don't know that I need an ear, nose, and throat specialist.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   I need a dermatologist.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   Oh my god, there's so many doctors.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   How do you find them?
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   I suggest you use ZocDoc.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   ZocDoc is a free app and website
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   where you can search and compare
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   high-quality in-network doctors,
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   choose the right one for your needs,
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   and click instantly to book an appointment.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   We're talking about in-network appointments
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   with more than 100,000 healthcare providers
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   across every specialty from mental health to dental health,
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   eye care to skin care, and much more.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   Oh yeah, my eye doctor just left too.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   Shut down his practice.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   Retired?
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   Yeah, I guess.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   He was right down the street from the HQ.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   ZocDoc time.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   That's what, I want to make ZocDoc a verb.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   I think I work well.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   I'm not worried about my eye doctor leaving.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   I'm just going to ZocDoc that problem.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   I'm going to ZocDoc the hell out of that.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   Don't worry about it.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   You can filter for doctors who take your insurance,
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   who are located nearby,
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   who are a good fit for any medical needs you may have,
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   and who are highly rated by verified patients.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   You can also see their actual appointment openings,
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   choose a time that works for you,
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   and click to instantly book a visit.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   ZocDoc appointments happen fast,
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   typically within 24 to 72 hours of booking.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   You can even score same-day appointments.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   I have used ZocDoc to look for doctors.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   I also have various Medicare providers
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   who use ZocDoc to handle paperwork ahead of time,
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   so I'm familiar with the app, and I enjoy it.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   I think you will too.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   So stop putting off those doctor's appointments
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   and go to ZocDoc.com/deep
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   to find and instantly book a top-rated doctor today.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   That's Z-O-C-D-O-C.com/deep.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   ZocDoc.com/deep.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   All right, Jesse, let's do some questions.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   Who do we got first?
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   First question is from Max.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   Can you provide an example of how time-blocking a workday
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   is different than using a weekly template?
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   Can you also explain why time-blocking is more demanding?
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   Well, weekly templates don't specify
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   every hour of your workday.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   So for those who listened to my weekly template episode
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   from a few weeks ago,
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   the idea of a weekly scheduling template
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   is basically placing some either big rocks
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   or big constraints on your schedule
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   in a way that's going to apply week to week, right?
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   So you might say, for example, no meetings in the morning,
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   no meetings till 11, I'm always writing in the morning.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   That's a weekly scheduling template.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   Or you might say, okay, on Tuesday and Thursday,
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   I'm on campus to teach in the morning.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   I have office hours midday.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   I'm leaving those afternoons free.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   This is when I want to do my meetings with people on campus.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   Those Tuesday and Thursdays, I'll keep those afternoons free.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   So it's these big rocks
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   or consistent scheduling constraints
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   that you want to put in place.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   And you can just write these in your weekly plan
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   so you see them.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   They'll probably, I guess, would live in your strategic plans,
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   your quarterly plans, and you see them each week
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   when you make your weekly plan and apply them to your week.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   Then you remember them too as you're scheduling other things
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   that you want to obey your weekly template.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   It's just a good way of adding some structure
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   to each upcoming season in a way that respects
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   what your goals are for that season.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   If you don't use weekly templates, the problem is
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   if you're just tackling each week or even each day as it comes,
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   stuff gets busy, stuff gets suboptimal.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   Time block planning, you're planning every hour of the day.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   So your weekly template will help you shape your day,
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   but it's not telling you everything you need to do in the day.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   And knowing that you're writing in the morning, for example,
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   still doesn't tell you how you're dealing,
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   when you stop that and how you're dealing with the afternoon,
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   when you have meetings, when you're doing to-dos,
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   what you're doing with the time that's free,
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   that's still going to require time block planning.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   All right, but let's connect this.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   Here's what I'm going to try to do today, Jesse.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   Connect every question back to the modern digital environment.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   So how does this connect back to what we talked about
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   in the deep dive?
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   Well, this very issue of having to do complicated scheduling
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   I think comes back to the intersection
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   of the digital with knowledge work.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   So we talked about briefly in the deep dive
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   is digital and digital networks from knowledge work
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   led to a lot more communication.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   It also has led to a much greater workload
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   because it's so easy to A, assign work to someone,
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   like anyone can just email anyone else
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   and in like nine seconds have placed a major obligation on their plate.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   So it's like free assignment of work.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   The technology that we have to execute this work,
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   so network computers is so powerful,
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   the total number of things you could conceivably doing
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   has also exploded.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   So this is a whole separate issue.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   This is sometimes called the curse of specialization
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   or of de-specialization rather.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   And this is well documented.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   I talk about this in my book, A World Without Email,
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   and a little bit in Slow Productivity.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   But basically when we gave people these productivity machines, computers,
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   they made a lot of things that we used to divide the labor on.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   Here's people who type, here's people who schedule trips,
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   here's people who work on presentations, the graphic department.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   The stuff we used to specialize all became easy enough
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   we could put it on the plate of individuals just do everything.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   And so instead of having 30 employees,
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   maybe 10 of which were the sort of trained frontline executives
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   like working on the direct things to make value
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   and 20 of which were sort of support,
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   we went to like 20 of the frontline executives and no support.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   Because what it turns out, and there's a cool paper by this,
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   I talk about it in A World Without Email,
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   it turns out when you fire all the support,
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   the number of non-support mainline people you need
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   to get the same amount of work done increases.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   Because now they're having to do on their computers
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   a lot of the work that the support staff was doing.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   So you need more of the non-support people
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   to get the same amount of work done.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   Well, they typically are more expensive salaries
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   than the support people.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   So now you're employing less total people
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   but your salary costs are the same if not higher
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   and everyone's more miserable.
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   So the sort of overload that necessitates solutions
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   like weekly scheduling templates
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   and time block planning to make tractable
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   were actually caused by these modern digital environment innovations
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   like the putting of the productivity revolution
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   with huge air quotes in the front office.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   So it sounds like an analog work thing, productivity thing,
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   but it comes back in the end to digital.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   So when you're in your summer schedule
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   and you do a writing block,
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   that's the same though in terms of intensity
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   as like when you're working during the year, right?
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   Yeah, writing blocks are writing blocks.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   I mean, I'm always writing.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   Yeah, it's sitting down and working on whatever's next
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   and what you're writing.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   Got it.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   All right, who do we got next?
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   Next question's from Michael.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   Earlier this year, my wife, my six-month-old baby,
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   and I moved across the country to a beautiful new rural house.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   In hindsight, it turned out to be a terrible idea.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   We got swept up in the idyllic vision
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   of owning a big wooded property.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   We neglected to consider the other aspects of life
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   that are important for a young family.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   It's been a lesson that focusing too much
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   on one component of the deep life
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   can sometimes push other important areas
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   into the background, often without us even realizing it.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   Well, I think it's a great case study,
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   like a little brief case study,
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   and it comes back to the idea we talked about in the deep dive
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   of lifestyle-centric planning versus grand goals, right?
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   So the problem with the grand goal method,
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   which is the idea that if I fixate on a grand romantic goal,
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   its pursuit and accomplishment will fix my life
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   and make my life better.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   The problem with the grand goal theory,
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   and I actually have already written this chapter
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   in my new book I'm working on about the deep life,
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   so I've been thinking about this.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   There's two major problems with the grand goal approach.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   One, when you focus on a grand goal,
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   you're typically focusing on just one aspect of your lifestyle
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   that's important to you.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   So in this example, they're thinking about nature,
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   quiet, the sort of slower stillness of being outside.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   It's like, this is a thing we want in our lifestyle, right?
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   Like, this is important.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   By fixating on just one,
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   the two bad things that could happen is, one,
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   at best, you are ignoring other things
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   that are important to a successful lifestyle,
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   so they don't get better.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   So these other things you need
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   to have a sustainable ideal lifestyle
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   aren't being addressed.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   At worst, they can actually make those things worse.
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   Like, you're actively hurting other things.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   So like, in this case,
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   by focusing just on this environmental idea,
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   I want to be in nature, I want it to be calming,
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   you probably were like actively making worse
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   connections to other people,
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   like being a part of a community.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   I've known other people who've left the city
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   to do something like this
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   who didn't realize how much they valued
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   intellectual life, you know, events.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   They're seeing interesting movies,
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   being around interesting people
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   who are working on interesting things.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   So maybe even if there is community
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   where they're moving, it's not writers.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   It's not people who are whatever artist
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   or whatever it is that you're interested in
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   or high-tech entrepreneur types
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   if you're in that world.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   And they didn't realize how much they valued that.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   You know, there's other like convenience things
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   people really in their ideal lifestyle,
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   maybe it's they want to be able to spend time,
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   you know, reading and doing what they're interested in.
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   Not realizing moving to the farm means
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   they have to spend most of their time
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   working on farm things
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   and they don't really care about those,
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   but that's going to get in the way
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   of these other things
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   and you can kind of create these big mismatches.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   Probably the most common one of these
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   is pursuing income and professional respect.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   You say, well, this is very important to me.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   So then you go and take,
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   the cliche is you go and take that job
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   that's going to give you the big raise
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   and more professional respect,
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   but now you have like an hour-long commute,
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   you don't see your kids as much,
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   you don't like the town that you're in,
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   like all these other things that are important
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   get actively pushed down.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   So you really have to think about
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   in lifestyle-centric planning,
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   you're looking at all the things that matter
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   and trying to do generally good on all of those.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   You're coming up with more bespoke,
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   sometimes complicated ideas or plans
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   that are really helping
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   multiple different things you care about
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   and for the ones these lifestyle-centric plans
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   don't directly affect,
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   at least they're doing no harm.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   You're not taking something that's important to you
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   and making it much worse.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   Or if there is a trade-off,
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   it's being made really clear.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   And when you see it's a trade-off,
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   you can say, okay,
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   we're going to do some weird
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   or over-the-top interventions
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   to try to go to this thing that's getting worse
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   when we make this lifestyle shift
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   and try to bring that back.
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   We might have to do that in unusual or weird ways.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   This is like the classic moving to the city,
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   but like really going out of your way
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   to set things up
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   so that you can spend three months
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   in the summer in the country
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   because there's certain compromises
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   about being in the city
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   that you're worried about
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   and that's how you balance that out.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   So guys, it's a great example
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   of lifestyle-centric career planning
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   being the way to do things
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   as opposed to grand goal theory.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   We talked about connecting back to digital.
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   We talked about this in the deep dive,
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   so I won't repeat it in detail.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   But the weird abstract nature of work
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   in the digital age
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   leaves us sort of bewildered
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   about finding meaning in our life.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   A lot more of that is placed on our plates.
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   And because of that,
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   we tend to fall into easy patterns
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   like grand goals.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   Let me just drastically change where I live
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   as a way to try to change our life.
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   But the whole idea
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   that we have to grapple with all of this
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   I think is really amplified by the digital.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   All right, what do we got next?
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   - Next question's from Elliot.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   "I'm working to reduce four email accounts
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   "to one personal and one business email account.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   "Each consolidation step
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   "often leads to an additional task
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   "and complications.
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   "Do you have strategies
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   "for simplifying this transition
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   "or managing the incremental steps
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   "without feeling constantly bogged down?"
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   - I mean, it sounds like to me, Elliot,
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   you're making this too complicated.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   If you're gonna make a change
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   with your email setup like this,
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   be okay with for a while
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   you're gonna miss some things
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   and upset some people.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   And then just do it
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   in the easiest possible way.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   I mean, I think that's the way to do it.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   I think we blow up in our head too much.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   I have to be super incremental
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   and careful about this
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   because what if someone
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   that I sometimes talk to
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   doesn't get the note?
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   And then I might fall out of touch with them
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   or it might take them some work
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   to find me again.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   That's okay.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   Be okay with upsetting some people.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   Be okay with you miss some things.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   It'll pass in a few months.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   You know what?
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   Maybe it'll actually lessen your loads.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   Like, "Oh yeah, some people
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   "didn't find me on the new email address.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   "Maybe that's not the worst thing."
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   If it really was important,
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   they really would find me.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   So I would simplify how you're doing this.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   Put an autoresponder on for a month
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   and then just be like,
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   "I'm assuming the bad stuff that happens
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   "when I turn off these other two accounts
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   "will be survivable
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   "because it almost certainly will be."
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   I'm not even gonna bother connecting that to digital
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   because it's just a digital question.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   Email.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   How do we deal with email?
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   That's obviously a modern digital environment question.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   All right, what do we got?
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   - Next question's from Matt.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   "When reading to improve your general knowledge,
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   "is it better to read a few books
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   "and take lots of notes on them
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   "and revise the notes,
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   "quiz yourself on the book,
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   "or read more books and take fewer notes?
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   "How do you strike a balance?"
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   - I mean, I think in general, just read more.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   If you're gonna take notes,
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   you can just do my page marking method.
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   Mark the corner if there's something
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   that looks interesting
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   and then just sort of bracket out
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   those sentences or paragraphs
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   that have really caught your attention.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   That way, if you ever wanna go back to that book,
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   you just flip to the pages
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   that are marked in the corners
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   and then read the sentences
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   that are marked in the brackets.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   And you can typically grok the big ideas
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   of a nonfiction book in like five minutes that way.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   That's usually how I read.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   Now, there's two exceptions
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   where you're gonna wanna actually
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   take notes outside of the book itself.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   One is, of course,
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   if you're working on a specific project
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   that requires that information,
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   an article, a report, or what have you,
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   a podcast episode, then that's fine.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   If you have a specific project
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   that needs the information from a book,
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   it might be worth slowing down
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   or moving notes from that book
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   out of the book
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   and into another medium.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   If you're someone who needs to draw
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   from a lot of books for projects,
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   I'm thinking about Ryan Holiday here
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   because he talks about his method.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   He's constantly copying notes
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   from most of the,
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   especially biographies
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   and history books he reads.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   He's constantly copying notes
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   onto physical note cards.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   Then he files these note cards.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   I've seen them, these like giant boxes.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   But that's because like almost every book he reads
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   is producing information
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   that he will at least potentially use
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   for a future book.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   But for most people
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   who don't have a particular project
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   or a plausible particular project
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   that needs the information, just read.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   Read more is better than less.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   The other exception is going to be
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   if there's a particular topic
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   you care a lot about.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   And it doesn't have to be professional.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   Maybe it's just,
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   "Here's something happening
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   in our culture right now.
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   I really want to know more about it.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   It impacts me.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   I want to be informed on it."
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   You can consider creating
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   an ID or information document.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   You just create like a text file.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   I use Google Docs
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   where you actually say,
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   "I'm going to go through.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   I'm going to read four or five books
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   on this topic.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   Maybe I'm going to take an online course,
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   like a Great Courses course on this.
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   And I'm going to pretty painstakingly
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   copy the main ideas from all these
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   into a big document
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   then make sense of them."
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   Because when I can see all the ideas
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   in one big document
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   from four or five books,
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   I can sort these around
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   and sort of get a sense
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   of a deeper understanding of that idea
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   just because I want a deeper understanding
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   of that idea.
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   Like I'm doing that now.
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   I began reading some books
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   that have to do post-election.
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   I'm just more interested in the idea,
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   and I'm putting air quotes around it,
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   of "wokeness,"
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   like where it came from,
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   its impact on American culture
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   and American elections.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   And I am creating a document
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   I think is relevant to my life
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   as an academic.
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   I think it's relevant to my life
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   as someone who does cultural commentary.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   I want to know more about it
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   because it seems to be having
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   a big impact on all of our lives.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   So I'm reading books.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   I just finished a great book
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   we'll talk about
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   in the November book summary,
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   "We Have Never Been Woke."
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   That was a very good book.
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   Sociologist from Stony Brook wrote it.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   Anyways, that's an idea
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   where I have four or five books
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   I've chosen.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   It's going to take me a while
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   to make my way through
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   because I'm working on other stuff.
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   I'm taking notes,
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   and then I'll sort that document around,
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   and out of that's going to come
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   like a more refined knowledge
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   about that idea.
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   Now that'll be something
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   I have like a "take on,"
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   like an intellectual foundation
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   that I can use
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   when talking about something else
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   or build on
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   or have some confidence.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   So you could do that as well,
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   like basically create a project
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   for yourself
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   and capture notes
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   into a shared document.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   Otherwise, just read.
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   Mark it in case you want
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   to come back years later,
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   but more books in general
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   is better than less.
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   - Do you ever use active recall
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   for general personal stuff?
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   - No.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   No, but for me,
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   I mean,
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   I say no in the sense of
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   I don't test myself.
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   Like when I think of active recall,
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   I think of like my book,
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   "How to Become a Straight-A Student,"
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   and I think about note cards,
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   and I'm testing my knowledge
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   on certain things.
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   What I do do, however,
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   when I'm like creating
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   an idea document for a topic
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   is I'm thinking it through
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   in my head
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   as if I was writing
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   an essay about it
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   or doing a podcast monologue on it,
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   and I'm trying to make sense
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   and fit things together.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   So in a sense,
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   that is sort of like active recall.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   I'll try out my ideas
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   in conversations,
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   or I'll test them
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   in some writing.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   That, in a sense,
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   is also active recall.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   So the more I play with the ideas
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   and try to make sense of them
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   in my own mind,
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   the more it's becoming ingrained.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   And there's this idea I have
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   where if you've worked
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   with connected ideas long enough,
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   they eventually just get added
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   to the internal infrastructure of ideas,
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   your intellectual infrastructure.
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   It's just part of that scaffolding
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   for the knowledge in your head,
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   and now it's something
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   you can forevermore draw on.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   Just like now,
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   I can draw very fluently
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   thinking about the neuroscience
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   and psychology of context shifting
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   and distraction
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   and its role in cognitive processing.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   I've just worked
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   with this information enough
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   that it's just a part
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   of how I understand the world.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   So creating a document,
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   playing with the ideas,
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   trying to summarize the ideas.
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   So when you play
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   with these documents,
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   you write summaries of the ideas
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   above the notes.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   That's kind of like active recall.
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   So maybe I'll say
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   playing with the ideas
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   is like a lightweight active recall
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   that does help you
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   not only understand them better
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   but integrate them
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   into that sort
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   of intellectual scaffolding.
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   This would also have to go
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   in my book idea
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   in defense of thinking.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   We don't talk enough
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   about just the mechanics of thinking.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   We don't do enough of that.
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   We look at our phones
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   but the mechanics of thinking
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   and the joy to come from thinking,
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   working with ideas,
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   increasing your understanding
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   of the world.
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   This is like a really rewarding
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   human activity.
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   We know this all the way
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   since Aristotle talked about
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   in the ethics
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   but we don't talk
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   about that much anymore.
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   We talk about content
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   like what you're learning
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   and also we just don't spend
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   that much time.
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   We're not that familiar
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   with our brain.
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   It's a weird thing
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   how the brain works
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   and how it takes information
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   but we don't talk much about that.
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   We know a lot more.
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   The lay public knows a lot more
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   about how muscles work
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   than they do about
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   how the brain works.
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:03.000]   Anyone who's an amateur weightlifter
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   knows a lot about roughly
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   how muscles work
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   and how they grow
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   and progressive resistance.
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   We know very little
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   about the brain
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   but it's at the key
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   not just of many of our jobs
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   but of a fulfilling human life
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   so I'm very interested
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   in that topic.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   What do we have next?
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   We have our corner.
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   Slow productivity corner.
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   Let's hear some theme music.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   So the slow productivity corner
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   is where we designate
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   one question per week
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   to be specifically
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   about my new book
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   Slow Productivity
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   The Lost Art of Accomplishment
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   Without Burnout.
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   I now can refer to it
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   as one of the Economist's
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   best books of 2024.
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   Check it out
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   if you have not already.
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   All right, Jesse.
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   What is our slow productivity
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   corner question of the week?
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   It's from Eric.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   I've worked in a fast-paced environment
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   for the past seven years
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   and I'm tired of running.
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   I recently read Slow Productivity.
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   My company and industry
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   for that matter
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   does not work at a natural place
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   and focus on quality.
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   There's less people
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   willing to do this work
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   and it's simultaneously
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   becoming more complex
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   and time-consuming.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   Therefore, I'm considering
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   a career shift
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   to better align with my values.
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   How do I apply
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   slow productivity
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   without losing career capital?
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   Well, it's a good question.
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   It helps to know
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   what you're looking for
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   when you're looking for a shift.
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   So you're looking
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   to make a career change.
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   You don't want to throw out
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   excessive amounts of career capital,
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   which, again,
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   is just my terminology
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   for your rare and valuable skills
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:35.000]   that you've already developed.
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   What I would look for,
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:39.000]   typically the best way
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   to leverage your capital
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   to get more slow productivity
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   is to find ways
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   to trade accountability
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   for accessibility,
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   to try to change your situation
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   in such a way
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   where you're being held accountable
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   for what you produce
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   but are given
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   extreme freedom and latitude
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   for how you do it.
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   So sometimes this means,
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   for example,
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   moving out of an organizational role
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:01.000]   where there's a lot of people
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   that you work with
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   and, therefore,
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   lots of expectations
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   about communication
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   and how work unfolds.
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   Moving out of one of those roles
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   into more of a freelance
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   or consulting role
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   where it's,
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   "Hey, I've signed a contract
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   "to do this.
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   "We'll check in once a week
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   "at this time on a phone call,
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   "and, otherwise,
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   "I'm just rock and rolling."
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.000]   So now I no longer have
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   accessibility understandings
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   or expectations about,
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   "Hey, I'm always going to answer
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   "emails and be on Slack,"
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   but I got a lot of accountability
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   because if I don't bring it,
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   I don't get a new contract.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   I'm going to eat what I hunt,
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   eat what I kill.
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   That's probably
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   what you should be looking for.
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:41.000]   I'm going to eat what I kill now.
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   How can I leverage this
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   so that it's going to be quality
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:48.000]   that I live on?
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   It's quality to make my reputation.
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   I'll be accountable for what I do,
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   but how I do it,
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   I'm going to have a lot more freedom.
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   You're probably in a good position
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   to start thinking about
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   taking those trade-offs.
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   When successful,
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:00.000]   they really can be life-changing
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   because it allows you
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.000]   to embrace so much more
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   slow productivity
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   in your professional life.
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:07.000]   All right.
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   What do we got next?
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   We have a call.
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   Ooh, let's hear it.
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   "I'm a big fan of your music.
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   I've been listening to your music
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   for a long time.
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   I've been listening to your music
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   for a long time.
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   I've been listening to your music

[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   I've been listening to your music
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   for a long time.
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   I've been listening to your music
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   for a long time.
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   I've been listening to your music
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:31.000]   for a long time.

[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:35.000]   for a long time.
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   Let's hear it.
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   Let's hear it.
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   Hey, Cal.
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:39.000]   Long-time reader and listener.
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   I'm a 28-year-old software engineer
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   working remotely from western Colorado.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   I grew up here, moved away
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:43.000]   for a couple of years,
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   and developed the career capital
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   to move back with the purpose
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   of lifestyle-centric career planning.
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   While I love the outdoor opportunities
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   and ability to participate
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:49.000]   in my small town,
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   I'm lonely working from home,
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   especially as a single person.
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:52.000]   I visit the office once every couple months,
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   which re-energizes me
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   and gives me a sense of home.
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   I'm a single parent,
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   and I'm a single parent.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   I'm a single parent,
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   and I'm a single parent.
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   I'm a single parent,
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   and I'm a single parent.
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:01.000]   I'm a single parent,
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   and I'm a single parent.
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   I'm a single parent,
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   and I'm a single parent.
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   I'm a single parent,
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   and I'm a single parent.
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   I'm a single parent,
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   and I'm a single parent.
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   I'm a single parent,
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   and I'm a single parent.
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   I'm a single parent,
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   and I'm a single parent.
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   I'm a single parent,
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   and I'm a single parent.
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:15.000]   I'm a single parent,
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   and I'm a single parent.
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:17.000]   I'm a single parent,
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   and I'm a single parent.
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   I'm a single parent,
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:20.000]   and I'm a single parent.
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   I'm a single parent,
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   and I'm a single parent.
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   I'm a single parent,
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   and I'm a single parent.
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   I'm a single parent,
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:26.000]   and I'm a single parent.
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   I'm a single parent,
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   and I'm a single parent.
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   I'm a single parent,
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   and I'm a single parent.
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   I'm a single parent,
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:32.000]   and I'm a single parent.
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   I'm a single parent,
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:34.000]   and I'm a single parent.
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   I'm a single parent,
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   and I'm a single parent.
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   I'm a single parent,
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   and I'm a single parent.
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   I'm a single parent,
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   and I'm a single parent.
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   I'm a single parent,
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   and I'm a single parent.
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:43.000]   I'm a single parent,
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   and I'm a single parent.
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   I'm a single parent,
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   and I'm a single parent.
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   I'm a single parent,
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   and I'm a single parent.
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:49.000]   I'm a single parent,
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   and I'm a single parent.
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   I'm a single parent,
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   and I'm a single parent.
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   I'm a single parent,
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   and I'm a single parent.
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   I'm a single parent,
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   and I'm a single parent.
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   I'm a single parent,
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   and I'm a single parent.
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:59.000]   I'm a single parent,
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   and I'm a single parent.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   I'm a single parent,
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   and I'm a single parent.
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   I'm a single parent,
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   and I'm a single parent.
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   I'm a single parent,
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   and I'm a single parent.
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   I'm a single parent,
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   and I'm a single parent.
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   I'm a single parent,
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:10.000]   and I'm a single parent.
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   I'm a single parent,
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   and I'm a single parent.
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:13.000]   I'm a single parent,
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   and I'm a single parent.
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   I'm a single parent,
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   and I'm a single parent.
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:17.000]   - All right, well, Josh,
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   it's a good chance
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   to practice lifestyle-centric planning.
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   So the key with lifestyle-centric planning
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.000]   is you have multiple different things
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   is you have multiple different things
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   that go into your ideal lifestyle.
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   We have to be careful
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   about this terminology, for example,
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   because I see you, for example,
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   referring to a subset of things
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   that matter in your lifestyle
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   as your "lifestyle."
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:41.000]   So living in Western Colorado
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   in a more remote place
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:45.000]   connected more closely
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.000]   to outdoor activities,
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   you're calling that your "lifestyle."
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   I was like, "No, that's part
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   of the attributes of your ideal lifestyle."
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   You're also mentioning
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   many other attributes
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   of an ideal lifestyle
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   that are incompatible
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   where you currently live.
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:01.000]   So you talked about
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   feeling more energy
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.000]   when you work in your office,
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   the dating pool,
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:07.000]   family proximity,
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   like being around family
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:10.000]   because they live in the front range,
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.000]   more things going on.
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   These are other attributes.
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:15.000]   You've mentioned those things
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:18.000]   and you mentioned liking the communities
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:19.000]   because I guess you said
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   you grew up there
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:21.000]   in Western Colorado,
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:22.000]   liking that kind of quiet vibe
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:24.000]   and the easier access
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   to outdoor activity,
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.000]   avoidance of sort of outdoor traffic.
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:30.000]   So we have multiple attributes
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.000]   and there's not an obvious winner
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:33.000]   in terms of location.
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:34.000]   This is a very classic setup
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:36.000]   for lifestyle-centric planning.
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   There's not like a location
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:40.000]   that satisfies that all.
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:42.000]   So now what we're looking to do
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   is come up with a plan
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:47.000]   that is going to improve
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:49.000]   as many of those as possible
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   and then maybe look for compensation
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:54.000]   for those that are
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:55.000]   neglected by the plan.
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:57.000]   So often a situation like this place,
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:00.000]   this idea is going to help more,
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:02.000]   as many of my lifestyle things
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:03.000]   directly as possible,
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:05.000]   and I'm going to come up with,
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:09.000]   perhaps even outside the box planning,
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:11.000]   for how to deal with the
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   remaining important things
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:15.000]   that this plan doesn't actually satisfy.
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:17.000]   So for example,
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.000]   I'll go both directions.
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:20.000]   You might say, you know what,
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:23.000]   Denver is,
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:24.000]   if I do Denver right,
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:25.000]   move to Denver,
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:27.000]   there's so many of these lifestyle things
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:28.000]   that are going to affect me
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   day to day and long term.
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:30.000]   Day to day,
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:31.000]   like what my work experience is like,
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:32.000]   long term,
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   like finding a mate,
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.000]   someone to marry down the line,
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:37.000]   being around family during this period
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:39.000]   where like before there's these things
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:41.000]   that's going to affect so often
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:42.000]   that are going to be,
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:43.000]   these are very important to me.
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:45.000]   So going to Denver is going to affect those.
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:46.000]   All right,
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.000]   so now how can I compensate
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:49.000]   for the small number of attributes
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.000]   that will be negatively impacted,
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:53.000]   which is like the quiet,
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:56.000]   the outdoor activity without all the traffic,
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:58.000]   that sort of aspects of life I like.
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.000]   You start thinking out of the box
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:02.000]   and be like, okay,
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:03.000]   here's what I'm going to do.
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:05.000]   I'm younger.
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:07.000]   I am going to find a way
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:10.000]   to have some sort of simple property.
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:11.000]   I might have to save up for a year,
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.000]   but some sort of simple property,
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:14.000]   you know,
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:15.000]   out in Western Colorado.
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:16.000]   It's going to be like a cabin
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:19.000]   that I'm going to work on and make better.
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   And I'm going to set up my work in Denver
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:24.000]   because they don't seem to care
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   in office or remote.
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:27.000]   So maybe I'm going to set it up
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:29.000]   so it's like three days in office or two remote
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   or like Fridays I do remote
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   or Mondays I do remote
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:34.000]   or something like this.
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:35.000]   And what I'm going to do is like
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:37.000]   on a lot of weekends,
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:39.000]   I'm going to head out to that property,
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   kind of make that drive,
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.000]   work from there
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:44.000]   and be in the countryside
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:46.000]   for the whole weekend.
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:48.000]   Okay, so I get that quiet.
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:50.000]   I get that outdoor activities.
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:52.000]   I'm connected to that community
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:54.000]   because a lot of weekends I'm out there
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:57.000]   and I'm fixing up this kind of cool cabin I go to
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:59.000]   and it's my center for mountain biking in the summer
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:01.000]   and for skiing in the winter.
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:02.000]   And it's this sort of like cool project
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:04.000]   I have going on.
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:06.000]   But I'm spending most of my days in the city
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:08.000]   and I'm in the office most days,
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   like most weeks.
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:10.000]   I'm getting that advantage.
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:11.000]   I'm seeing my family
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:14.000]   and I could go out and like hang out with people,
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:15.000]   especially on like weekday nights
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:16.000]   or if there's like a date,
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:18.000]   maybe I don't go out to the cabin that weekend.
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:20.000]   But I also have a place like for my friends
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   I meet in the city to go out to.
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:23.000]   And now what you're doing with this lifestyle planning,
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   this is not like an obvious off-the-shelf solution.
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   Like, oh, like the standard solution
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:28.000]   of working four days a week in Denver
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:30.000]   with a cabin in Western Colorado
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:31.000]   that you work on most weekends.
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   It's not an off-the-shelf solution.
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:33.000]   It's a solution that's bespoke
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:35.000]   to your particular list of lifestyle attributes
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:37.000]   you care about.
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:38.000]   And now you know that's what you're doing.
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:40.000]   Then you begin looking for opportunities
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:41.000]   and this is where you find out like,
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:43.000]   okay, here's what I want to do.
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:44.000]   And it's where you find out like,
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:47.000]   actually, this friend of my family,
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:48.000]   we used to live there,
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:49.000]   you know, he's always mentioned
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   they have this big property
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:51.000]   and they have a cabin on it
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:53.000]   and they would probably rent that to me
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   because they'd like it to be fixed up.
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:55.000]   And this is really not going to be that expensive.
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:57.000]   And my other buddy lives out there still
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:58.000]   and does custom home building
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:01.000]   and maybe he could,
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:03.000]   suddenly these like super bespoke plans
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:05.000]   begin to emerge.
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:06.000]   And there might be another way.
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:07.000]   You could go the opposite way.
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:09.000]   I could imagine a way where you go all in
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:12.000]   on where you're currently living.
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:14.000]   And the way you would probably do that
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:16.000]   is figure out how to much more aggressively
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:19.000]   invest in non-professional community.
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:21.000]   Maybe there's a co-working space you go to,
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:23.000]   but also maybe you just get really on the ball
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:25.000]   with your work using my type of techniques
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:27.000]   to free up much more time
[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:29.000]   so that you're sort of technically done
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:31.000]   without people knowing by work by two
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:32.000]   and so you can be involved
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:33.000]   in all these like really aggressive
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:37.000]   outdoor activities and communities.
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:38.000]   My brother used to be very good at this
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:39.000]   when he worked for the government
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:41.000]   would shift,
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:42.000]   his schedule would start,
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:43.000]   you know, at 5 a.m.
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:45.000]   and that freed up the afternoons
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:47.000]   for outdoor activities.
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:48.000]   So you had big community
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:49.000]   that was sort of unrelated to work.
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:50.000]   So like there's shifts
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:52.000]   you can start to make there.
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:53.000]   And then maybe you say,
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:54.000]   I come into Denver
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:56.000]   for three days every other week.
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:58.000]   You know, I have like a place,
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:01.000]   like an Airbnb I like that I rent
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:04.000]   and I'm there half a week
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:05.000]   every other week
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:06.000]   or you do the thing where like,
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:08.000]   yeah, I go into the city
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:11.000]   for Monday and Tuesday
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:12.000]   and then I'm back for Wednesday
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:14.000]   through Sunday in the country, right?
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:15.000]   You figure out a way to do that.
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:17.000]   Maybe you buy a cheap apartment
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:18.000]   that you sort of fix up
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:19.000]   and I don't know, right?
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:22.000]   But you start thinking about these
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:24.000]   non-off-the-shelf
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:25.000]   sort of bespoke solutions
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:26.000]   once you know the game.
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:28.000]   These are the attributes
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:29.000]   that I want to try to help them all
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:31.000]   and some I can help directly
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:32.000]   and some I have to do something
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:34.000]   unexpected to.
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:36.000]   This is what lifestyle-centric planning
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:37.000]   looks like
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:38.000]   and it's very different
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:39.000]   than grand goal thinking
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:40.000]   which would be like
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:41.000]   if I just make one big change
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:43.000]   everything else is going to be better.
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:44.000]   So that's like what I want
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:46.000]   to emphasize here
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:47.000]   is that when you have this list
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:49.000]   of attributes you're working on
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:50.000]   that can't just all be helped
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:52.000]   by one decision.
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:53.000]   You get creative
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:54.000]   and it's why the deepest lives
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:56.000]   often have a relatively
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:58.000]   complicated structure
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:00.000]   because that's what happens
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:01.000]   when you're working
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:02.000]   to satisfy multiple attributes
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:03.000]   at the same time.
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:04.000]   It's actually kind of a fun game
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:05.000]   and you have way more opportunities
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:06.000]   to do things
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:07.000]   you would never even think of
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:08.000]   until you know exactly
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:10.000]   what you're trying to do.
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:12.000]   So you got a couple cool options here, Josh,
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:14.000]   but I think the key is
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:16.000]   do real lifestyle-centric planning.
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:17.000]   All of this, Jesse, is what I'm,
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:19.000]   I haven't got to this part of my book yet,
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:21.000]   but that's why I'm kind of looking forward
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:22.000]   to this deep life book
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:23.000]   and just having like a manual
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:25.000]   for this type of lifestyle thinking.
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:26.000]   It'll be like the least technology
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:27.000]   seemingly related book I've written,
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:29.000]   though again it's motivated by technology
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:30.000]   because the very fact
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:32.000]   that we have to think so explicitly
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:34.000]   about how to shape our lives
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:35.000]   is something that came
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:36.000]   from the digitization of work
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:38.000]   that's like one of the side effects of it,
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:39.000]   but I'm going to be glad
[00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:40.000]   when I can actually sort of
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:42.000]   just hand this book to people.
[00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:44.000]   I'm still in part one
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:46.000]   which is preparation.
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:48.000]   The hard work of preparing
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:49.000]   to change your life
[00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:50.000]   because that's my other argument,
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:52.000]   and Josh, I guess I'll throw this to you as well.
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:54.000]   The first big idea in my book
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:55.000]   is sometimes it's hard
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:57.000]   to jump straight into transforming your life.
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:59.000]   You have to prepare for it first,
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:01.000]   and then part two is
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:02.000]   lifestyle-centric planning
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:04.000]   and how you actually do this type of planning.
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:05.000]   So I'm in the final chapter
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:07.000]   of part one right now in my writing.
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:08.000]   When it's finished,
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:10.000]   we'll fall in the same category
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:12.000]   as social productivity?
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:15.000]   You mean in terms of like how a
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:17.000]   publisher would think about it?
[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:18.000]   I guess it's going to be considered
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:20.000]   more traditional self-help.
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:23.000]   It is not really about business
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:24.000]   or the world of work
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:25.000]   or technology as directly.
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:27.000]   So I guess it'll be seen
[00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:30.000]   as a more traditional self-help book, I suppose.
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:32.000]   - And then do we know any of the books
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:34.000]   in 2024 on that list this year?
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:35.000]   I should look.
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:37.000]   - It's often not its own category.
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:38.000]   Yeah, I mean,
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:41.000]   so where I have been on lists like that
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:42.000]   was Goodreads did
[00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:44.000]   their nine most popular self-help books
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:46.000]   which covered like all advice books.
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:47.000]   And I was on that list.
[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:49.000]   But like if you look at the Economist list,
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:51.000]   they don't have a category for that.
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:54.000]   I guess it could be under cultural and the arts.
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:55.000]   It's probably not going to,
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:56.000]   I guess it could be under business,
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:57.000]   technology, economics,
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:58.000]   but probably not.
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:00.000]   And it's not going to be under history or memoir.
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:03.000]   So like that area is a little bit less,
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:06.000]   less represented in some of these lists.
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:07.000]   So we'll see.
[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:09.000]   It's been a fun book to write though.
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:10.000]   - Yeah.
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:12.000]   - Taking my time.
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:14.000]   All right, so we got next a case study
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:16.000]   where people send in their accounts
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:18.000]   of putting into practice the type of advice
[00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:19.000]   we talked about on the show
[00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:21.000]   so you can see what it looks like in the real world.
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:22.000]   If you have a case study,
[00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:26.000]   send it to jesse@jesse@calnewport.com.
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:29.000]   Today's case study comes from Brooke.
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:30.000]   Brooke says,
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:32.000]   "Prior to reading Slow Productivity,
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:34.000]   "I had honestly been just scared
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:37.000]   "to start the creative pursuits I was interested in.
[00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:39.000]   "Everyone else seems to be able
[00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:40.000]   "to crank out a book in six months
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:41.000]   "or produce a work of art
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:44.000]   "with a seemingly minimal natural effort.
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:46.000]   "Since I was just a beginner in everything,
[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:48.000]   "my art would take forever and suck.
[00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:51.000]   "And wouldn't that be the worst thing to ever happen?
[00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:53.000]   "Then I read Slow Productivity,
[00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:55.000]   "and immediately after I read Deep Work,
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:57.000]   "the framework of Slow Productivity
[00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:59.000]   "and concepts of Deep Work really resonated with me,
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:01.000]   "and I decided it was finally time
[00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:03.000]   "to start writing the book I'd been thinking about.
[00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:05.000]   "If it took forever, who cares?
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:06.000]   "I would create something I was happy with,
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:08.000]   "and that's all that matters.
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:10.000]   "To keep going past the initial spark of inspiration,
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:12.000]   "I built my writing schedule around the idea
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:14.000]   "that Deep Work is a muscle you cultivate.
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:16.000]   "Since my Deep Work muscle was probably
[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:18.000]   "weaker than a newborn kitten,
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:20.000]   "I set aside only one hour on weekdays
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:21.000]   "to work on my book.
[00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:23.000]   "I started a ritual to get in the writing zone,
[00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:26.000]   "then one to finish out my Deep Writing session,
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:27.000]   "which broke down writing a whole book
[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:29.000]   "into easily achievable chunks.
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:31.000]   "I also got a small field notebook
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:32.000]   "to record other random ideas
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:35.000]   "that came to me outside of my Deep Work sessions.
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:37.000]   "I don't think this notebook would be all that helpful,
[00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:41.000]   "but it turned out to be pivotal in developing the plot.
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:46.000]   "While I haven't written oodles of chapters as a beginner,
[00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:48.000]   "this is a pace that is natural and sustainable to me.
[00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:51.000]   "My ability to work deeply has improved,
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:54.000]   "along with my writing sessions to get longer.
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:56.000]   "Critically, I'm so happy with what I've written,
[00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:59.000]   "which provides major motivation to keep going."
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:02.000]   All right, well, Brooke, I appreciate that case study.
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:04.000]   A couple ideas to underline for people.
[00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:08.000]   One, the idea of Deep Work as being cultivated.
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:11.000]   The more you train it, the better you get.
[00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:13.000]   So if you haven't really been spending a lot of time
[00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:15.000]   focusing intensely without distraction,
[00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:19.000]   don't be upset that when you go out to that writing cabin
[00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:20.000]   you rented for a month,
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:23.000]   you have struggled to produce anything useful.
[00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:25.000]   This is not some flaw in your wiring.
[00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:26.000]   It just means you're out of practice.
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:29.000]   Just like if you went to run a 5K,
[00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:31.000]   having not done any running in a while,
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:33.000]   it's not going to go well.
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:35.000]   You'll be winded, your lungs will hurt, your legs will hurt.
[00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:37.000]   You wouldn't say, "I don't have a running body.
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:38.000]   "I'm just not meant to run."
[00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:39.000]   You'd say, "Yeah, I haven't been training.
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:41.000]   "If I did some more training, I'd be better at this."
[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:42.000]   So you have to think about Deep Work that way.
[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:43.000]   I appreciate that.
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:45.000]   I also appreciate you embracing the idea
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:48.000]   of working at a natural pace.
[00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:49.000]   From my book, Slow Productivity,
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:51.000]   yeah, take your time, no one cares.
[00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:53.000]   A lot of great stuff took a really long time
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:54.000]   and no one knows that.
[00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:56.000]   No one knows how long things take.
[00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:58.000]   We invent these timelines in our head
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:01.000]   about how long we want something to take.
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:03.000]   And then we convince ourselves of two things.
[00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:07.000]   One, this is how long it takes for other people.
[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:10.000]   And two, wouldn't it be great if this was true?
[00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:12.000]   And we fall in love with that story.
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:15.000]   We tell ourselves everyone writes books in six months
[00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:17.000]   and we imagine what it would be like
[00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:18.000]   to be done in six months.
[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:19.000]   And then that becomes a story
[00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:21.000]   that we want so much to be true
[00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:23.000]   that we try to force it to be true.
[00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:25.000]   But if you spend three years instead,
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:26.000]   what might have been impossible
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:29.000]   might become very tractable.
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:30.000]   Slow and steady.
[00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:31.000]   I talk about this a lot
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:35.000]   as the compound interest of productive effort.
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:36.000]   You work on something,
[00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:38.000]   not randomly, but productively.
[00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:40.000]   When I work, I have a structure,
[00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:43.000]   I'm working deep, I'm trying to make progress,
[00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:45.000]   but only a little bit of work at a time
[00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:46.000]   on a regular basis,
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:48.000]   but maybe not a crazy pace.
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:50.000]   That adds up.
[00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:51.000]   Over time, that adds up.
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:53.000]   At first, you're not seeing the benefits.
[00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:54.000]   You're adding up pages,
[00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:56.000]   but you can't really tell the difference.
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:58.000]   You've written a bunch of stuff.
[00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:01.000]   But eventually, that turns into a manuscript,
[00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:03.000]   if we're going to use the book example.
[00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:05.000]   Now you have a thing that can get feedback on
[00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:08.000]   and ideas about that you can be revising.
[00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:10.000]   And then at some point,
[00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:12.000]   that leads to something that gets published.
[00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:13.000]   And now you're really getting rewards.
[00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:14.000]   Well, I'm a published author
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:16.000]   and I have the opportunity to publish other books,
[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:18.000]   and the rewards begin to aggregate.
[00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:19.000]   And once you've published a few books
[00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:20.000]   and you've had one of them
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:21.000]   that has broken out and been successful,
[00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:23.000]   you look at the rewards per effort
[00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:24.000]   and you see it's flat, flat, flat,
[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:26.000]   and it starts moving, moving, moving,
[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:27.000]   faster, faster, faster.
[00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:29.000]   But you can't jump to the top of this curve from scratch.
[00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:32.000]   You have to sort of work your way on the slow curve
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:35.000]   before the exponential really begins to pick in.
[00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:39.000]   The compound interest of consistent, productive effort
[00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:41.000]   is a really important factor.
[00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:45.000]   So just take more time is fine.
[00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:48.000]   You're going to build up good work.
[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:50.000]   Building up good work is building up good work.
[00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:52.000]   And who's to say three years is worse
[00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:54.000]   than two years is better than six months?
[00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:56.000]   So I love it, Brooke.
[00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:57.000]   Great case study.
[00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:58.000]   Keep going.
[00:58:58.000 --> 00:58:59.000]   Go slow.
[00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:00.000]   Keep obsessing over quality.
[00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:04.000]   Read the obsess over quality section of Slow Productivity.
[00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:05.000]   Work on your taste.
[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:06.000]   I have all this advice in there
[00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:08.000]   for how to work on your taste,
[00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:10.000]   how to be around people who are doing it well,
[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:11.000]   how to create your own inklings,
[00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:13.000]   how to get non-biased feedback.
[00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:17.000]   You want to be obsessing over quality here,
[00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:19.000]   but you can couple that with taking your time.
[00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:21.000]   So you can kind of read the story about Juul
[00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:23.000]   will be a good story for you here as well.
[00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:25.000]   So yeah, Slow Productivity is the Bible
[00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:26.000]   for what you're doing right now.
[00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:27.000]   Go slow.
[00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:28.000]   Take your time.
[00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:29.000]   Obsess over quality.
[00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:32.000]   Good stuff will likely come.
[00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:35.000]   All right, we have a final segment coming up here.
[00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:38.000]   But first, let's hear from another sponsor.
[00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:42.000]   I want to hear about our longtime sponsors at Grammarly.
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:43.000]   What's been cool about Grammarly
[00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:45.000]   is that in the time that they have been one of our sponsors,
[00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:47.000]   it's now been four years,
[00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:50.000]   we have seen their already great product
[00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:55.000]   grow in leaps and bounds in terms of its capabilities.
[00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:58.000]   And particularly, it has been their embrace
[00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:01.000]   and integration of AI that has really pushed forward
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:04.000]   what Grammarly can help you do.
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000]   So Grammarly helps with any writing from brainstorming
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:10.000]   to sounding more confident and persuasive at your work.
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000]   You can write and edit quickly
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:16.000]   with context-aware suggestions everywhere you write.
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000]   It can help you change the tone.
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000]   It can help you reword things.
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:23.000]   It'll help you, of course, with just grammar, as it always has.
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:26.000]   It can even help generate ideas
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000]   or text for you to work with from scratch,
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:35.000]   all using this increasingly sophisticated embrace of AI.
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000]   So, for example, maybe you're like,
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:40.000]   "Okay, I have to write up a marketing message
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000]   because we're going to send out an email
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000]   for some new product."
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000]   You can now, with Grammarly, actually use its AI prompts
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:49.000]   to help you come up with some few ideas
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:52.000]   for what to say or a good metaphor to use.
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000]   Then you can write that quickly and then use its tone detector.
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000]   "Is this too professional? How do I make it?
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:59.000]   Can we rewrite this to be a little bit lighter?"
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:00.000]   And it helps you rewrite your text.
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000]   So it's like having a professional editor
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000]   who sits there over your shoulder now,
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:07.000]   plus a professional researcher who can give you ideas
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000]   and write rough drafts of text.
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:12.000]   The tool has really been coming along.
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000]   It has enterprise-grade security
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:17.000]   and a business model that doesn't sell your data,
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:21.000]   so you do not have to worry about that.
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:24.000]   It works across, what is it now, 500,000 apps and websites.
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.000]   That's what's cool about it.
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000]   You're not flipping over to a website
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000]   where you're typing stuff into a text interface.
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000]   It is there in the apps you're already using
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000]   to do your writing.
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000]   93% of professionals report that Grammarly
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:38.000]   helps them get more work done.
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000]   They've been at this for 15 years,
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000]   and it keeps getting better and better.
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000]   So get more done with Grammarly.
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:49.000]   Download Grammarly for free at grammarly.com/podcast.
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:53.000]   That's grammarly.com/podcast.
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:57.000]   I also want to talk about our friends at Shopify.
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:02.000]   Nobody does selling better than Shopify.
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:05.000]   This is the home of the number one checkout on the planet,
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000]   including their Shop Pay feature
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000]   that boosts conversions up to 50%,
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:12.000]   meaning way less carts get abandoned.
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000]   You get way more sales going forward.
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000]   I can't tell you how many different people I know
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:19.000]   who sell things who swear by Shopify.
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:22.000]   It makes it so easy for you to have
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:25.000]   an incredibly professional commerce experience,
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:28.000]   whether we're talking about e-commerce on a website
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000]   or even point-to-sale solutions
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000]   in actual bricks-and-mortar stores.
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:35.000]   You get this super easy checkout experience.
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000]   People are much more likely to follow through
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000]   and actually complete their purchase.
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:44.000]   And it's easy on your end as the business owner.
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:47.000]   So this is kind of like the poorly kept secret
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000]   of the world of people who sell things.
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:52.000]   It's Shopify is what makes them seem
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:55.000]   so effective and so professional.
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:59.000]   So upgrade your business and get the same checkout
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:02.000]   that so many people I know use
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:07.000]   to sell things online or in person.
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:10.000]   You can sign up for a $1 per month trial period
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:14.000]   if you go to shopify.com/deep.
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:18.000]   It's important that you type that in all lowercase letters.
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:21.000]   Go to shopify.com/deep.
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000]   The upgrade you're selling today,
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:27.000]   that's shopify.com/deep.
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:32.000]   All right, Jesse, let's move on to our final segment.
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:36.000]   So today I want to react to something that I saw online.
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000]   I'm going to load it up on the screen here
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:42.000]   for those who are watching instead of just listening.
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000]   This is actually someone reporting something
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:48.000]   they just encountered in their workplace.
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:51.000]   They're reporting about it on Reddit.
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:54.000]   So this is from the r/sysadmin Reddit thread
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000]   from just a few days before.
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000]   We are actually doing this recording.
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:01.000]   All right, I'm going to read some of this here.
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:04.000]   Had the pleasure of sitting through a sales pitch
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:07.000]   for a pretty big productivity monitoring,
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:10.000]   why can't I say this word, monitoring?
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:11.000]   It's not a hard word.
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:14.000]   I'm not trying to say like zocdoc.com,
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:17.000]   productivity monitoring software suite this morning.
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:21.000]   Here's the expected basics of what this application does.
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:25.000]   Full key logging and mouse movement tracking
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:28.000]   takes a screenshot of your desktop every interval
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000]   between 10 seconds to five minutes.
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:33.000]   Also part of every RMM I know.
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000]   Keeps track of the programs you open and how often.
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000]   This is also standard.
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000]   Creates real-time recordings and heat maps
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:43.000]   of where you click in any program.
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:46.000]   All right, then he says, here's where it gets fun.
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:49.000]   It allows your manager to group you into a work category
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.000]   along with your coworkers.
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:54.000]   It then uses AI to create a productivity graph
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000]   from all your mouse movement data
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:59.000]   and where you click, how fast you type,
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000]   how often you use Backspace, the sites you visit,
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:04.000]   the programs you open, how many emails you send
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:07.000]   and compares all this to your coworkers' data
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:10.000]   in the same work category.
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000]   It goes on and on.
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:16.000]   All right, this represents like a natural trajectory
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:20.000]   of "productivity monitoring software"
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000]   in the current world of knowledge work,
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:26.000]   all of which tends to be based on this idea
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000]   that what matters is activity
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000]   and the boogeyman that you have to chase down
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:33.000]   and get rid of is people doing nothing.
[01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:36.000]   This productivity monitoring software creates a world
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000]   where if you're doing lots of stuff on your computer,
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000]   it's great for the company
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000]   and there's a lot of freeloaders
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000]   who like sit there sipping Slurpees
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:45.000]   and you got to figure them out with this software.
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:46.000]   If you can just get rid of those,
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000]   you're going to be productive.
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:52.000]   This is, in my opinion, ridiculous.
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000]   And it is what happens
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:57.000]   when we let software companies dictate to us
[01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000]   what productivity means.
[01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000]   The definition of productivity that they're dictating to us
[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:04.000]   is productivity that can be helped and monitored
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:07.000]   by their tools which cost money, by their SaaS tools.
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:08.000]   But if we step back
[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:11.000]   with even just a little bit of objectivity,
[01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000]   this shift towards digital productivity monitoring
[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:17.000]   in most jobs is crazily misguided.
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:21.000]   It would be the equivalent of going to the Ford factory
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000]   in the early 20th century
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000]   and saying, "Okay, we want to be better
[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000]   "at producing Model Ts,
[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000]   "and here's how we're going to do it."
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000]   We've created this apparatus
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000]   that looks at the arm movements
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:37.000]   of the different people involved in building the cars.
[01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:38.000]   And here's how it works.
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000]   We've put bells on people's arms
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000]   and they have different tones
[01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000]   and we've trained people
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000]   to recognize the different bell tones.
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000]   And if we hear a particular bell,
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000]   is it ringing enough?
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000]   Well, maybe that person's just not helping to build cars
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:53.000]   and we can identify them.
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000]   So everyone's going to have to make sure
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:58.000]   their bells are ringing all the time.
[01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000]   This would be a crazily indirect way
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:05.000]   of trying to increase Model T production.
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000]   What works better?
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:10.000]   Why don't we measure how fast we're producing Model Ts
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:13.000]   and then let's have a process we use to produce Model Ts.
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000]   And then if we change the process,
[01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:18.000]   let's see if that produces more Model Ts.
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000]   That's what led to the continuous motion assembly line,
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000]   which is 10x more effective than the methods we were using before.
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000]   Not this vaguely indirect,
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:27.000]   "Let's make sure people are moving more."
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000]   And this becomes crystal clear
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:33.000]   when we think about this analogy to car manufacturing.
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000]   In car manufacturing, it becomes clear,
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000]   "Oh, it's completely misguided.
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:38.000]   "What you're trying to do here
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000]   "is not figure out a way to do something better.
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000]   "You're trying to figure out a way
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000]   "to eliminate some narrow negative case you're worried about.
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000]   "You're worried about the person
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000]   "who's on your car manufacturing floor
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000]   "who's just sitting there taking a nap.
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000]   "So you have this negative boogeyman
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:53.000]   "you're really worried about,
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000]   "and you're putting all of your energy to track that down.
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:56.000]   "Hey, if you're just doing nothing,
[01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:57.000]   "I'm not going to hear your bell,
[01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000]   "then you're going to be in trouble."
[01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:00.000]   But what it doesn't focus on
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000]   is the positive of trying to produce more stuff,
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000]   which is ultimately the thing that more directly matters.
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000]   I don't care as much about, "Is someone taking a nap?"
[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:07.000]   What I care about is,
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000]   "Are we producing Model Ts at a fast rate?"
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000]   That's what matters to me.
[01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:15.000]   I don't get paid by car purchasers for lack of naps.
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000]   I get paid for Model Ts.
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000]   But in knowledge work,
[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:23.000]   we have this terribly indirect way of doing things
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000]   where we say, "Well, visible activity
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000]   "is going to be our proxy for useful effort,
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000]   "so let's just make sure there's no one
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000]   "doing very little visible activity."
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:34.000]   But as I argue in my book, Slow Productivity,
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000]   this is a disastrous way to think about
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000]   actually getting things done.
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000]   In knowledge work, we have to figure out
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:44.000]   how to measure the stuff that matters
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:47.000]   and the processes we use to produce that stuff
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:50.000]   and see if those processes work well or not.
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:51.000]   It has nothing to do with
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000]   putting the proverbial bells on people's elbows
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000]   just to make sure that their body's moving.
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000]   Now, what about that negative?
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000]   What about the freeloader problem?
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000]   Almost anything you come up with
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000]   for actually directly improving
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000]   the quality of what you produce,
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000]   almost anything you come up with
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000]   as soon as you get very systematic
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000]   about what should the processes be
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000]   for how we produce stuff,
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000]   almost any of these solutions
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000]   make freeloaders really obvious.
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000]   Because once you actually think about process,
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000]   like here's the stuff we do,
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000]   we tend to do things like
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000]   external tracking of workload.
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000]   We tend to do things like
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000]   clarity and communication.
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000]   Every other day, we sit down,
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:32.000]   you are working on this,
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000]   where are you, where are you stuck?
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:35.000]   As opposed to just receiving a bunch of emails
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:36.000]   about a bunch of stuff.
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:37.000]   I know what you're working on,
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:38.000]   I want to know what you need,
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000]   what you did, what you need.
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000]   Like that is a situation, for example,
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000]   in which it's very hard to be
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000]   the car worker not moving your arms.
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000]   I don't need to be tracking your computer
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000]   or seeing if your mouse is moving.
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000]   It's where's the goods?
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:53.000]   You didn't do this.
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000]   It's clear 10 minutes before this meeting
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000]   you put some crap together.
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000]   So when you get more systematic,
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000]   the freeloader problem goes away.
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000]   But you also free people
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000]   from this counterproductive
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000]   surveillance culture approach,
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000]   which is more about managers being really mad
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:10.000]   and managing some negative
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:13.000]   than it is about trying to get more things done.
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:14.000]   So the equivalent of the assembly line
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:15.000]   in knowledge work is like,
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:18.000]   let's get more focused on what we produce,
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:21.000]   let's have external workload management,
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:22.000]   let's structure communication
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:23.000]   so people aren't context shifting,
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:26.000]   and let's trade accessibility for accountability.
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:27.000]   This is what the software industry did
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000]   when they moved towards agile methodologies.
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:30.000]   They don't just email each other like,
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000]   hey, could you work on this feature?
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:33.000]   What about that feature?
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:34.000]   And who's working on this?
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000]   No, they track what features need to be done.
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:37.000]   Who's working on what?
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:38.000]   You're working on this.
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000]   Only work on this.
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:41.000]   How long do you need, two days?
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:42.000]   Great, get it done in two days.
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:43.000]   We'll check back in and figure out
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000]   what you should work on next.
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000]   Huge flexibility in how work is executed.
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:48.000]   Very little surveillance.
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:49.000]   But on the other hand,
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:50.000]   very few freeloaders,
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000]   because it becomes obvious pretty quick,
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000]   you've been very nonproductive.
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:57.000]   You're not getting these things done for us.
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000]   So what we need to care about
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000]   is real processes
[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:02.000]   that take into account
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000]   how the human brain actually works
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000]   and are more focused on results
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000]   than they are these crude proxies
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000]   for useful effort.
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000]   So the type of productivity monitoring software
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000]   talked about in this Reddit thread
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:17.000]   is exactly the wrong direction to go.
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000]   It's putting the bells on the forward workers
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:22.000]   instead of innovating the assembly line.
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:25.000]   It is missing the forest for the trees.
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000]   It is not going to make your company more productive.
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000]   It's just going to make people more miserable.
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000]   I'm not surprised that software companies
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:32.000]   are pitching this
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:33.000]   because this is something you can write software from
[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:34.000]   and throw some AI at it
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000]   so it seems like it's a value add
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000]   and you can charge $12 a seat
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:39.000]   with your SaaS solution.
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:40.000]   The companies themselves say
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.000]   it's not the software.
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:42.000]   The software companies
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:43.000]   aren't going to tell them what productivity is.
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:44.000]   We know our business.
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:47.000]   Let's get serious about producing stuff that matters.
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000]   Even if structuring work is going to be a pain,
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:52.000]   it's better than all this nonsense.
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:53.000]   So there you go.
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:54.000]   It's a little bit of a rant,
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:55.000]   but productivity monitoring software
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000]   is going in the absolute wrong direction.
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:58.000]   And of course, let me connect this
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:01.000]   like we're doing all episode back to digital.
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000]   This is all a problem
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000]   of the digital environment around knowledge work
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000]   where there's so many different things
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:08.000]   you could be working on
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:09.000]   and there's such ease
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:10.000]   in just passing stuff on along
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:11.000]   and we get into this sort of
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000]   pseudo-productive, hyperactive, hive mind environment
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:14.000]   where everyone just rock and rolls
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:15.000]   and emails everyone.
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:16.000]   And in that world,
[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:17.000]   what else can you do
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:18.000]   except for say like,
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:21.000]   "Well, let's just get rid of people not participating."
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:22.000]   But this is all a side effect
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000]   of digital knowledge work.
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000]   It caught us off guard.
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:27.000]   We didn't know how to handle it
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000]   and we need better tools
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:33.000]   than something like monitoring software.
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:34.000]   All right.
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:35.000]   All right, there we go.
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:38.000]   That is our episode for today.
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:39.000]   We covered, I guess I could say,
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000]   everything, Jesse.
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:42.000]   Because in theory,
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:43.000]   I've touched on almost every major topic
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:44.000]   I've talked about.
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000]   I did leave out a whole section of advice
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:47.000]   about skeletons.
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:50.000]   I do have a lot of thoughts about that.
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000]   I also had another whole section of advice
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000]   about Brandon Sanderson
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:57.000]   and his book, "Name of the Wind."
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:58.000]   This is a good time to tell people, by the way,
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000]   if you have corrections about things I've said,
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000]   like misattributing authors to books,
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:03.000]   jesse@calnewport.com.
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:04.000]   He loves to hear about them.
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:05.000]   - I do.
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:06.000]   - I got a couple.
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:07.000]   I get those emails.
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000]   We must have mentioned Brandon recently
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:10.000]   because I got another
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000]   "Brandon didn't write 'Name of the Wind' email"
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000]   kind of recently.
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000]   It's my favorite type of emails.
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:17.000]   All right.
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:18.000]   That's all we have for today.
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000]   We'll be back next week with another episode.
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:23.000]   I guess this is coming out early December, right?
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:24.000]   - Yes.
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:25.000]   - All right.
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.000]   So we'll do the November books.
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:27.000]   I forgot to bring them today.
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:28.000]   We're recording this
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000]   pretty early in the week in November,
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:31.000]   so I didn't think about it.
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000]   But I will do the books I read in November.
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000]   We'll do those at the end of the next episode.
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:36.000]   Okay?
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:37.000]   Keep up with your thrillers
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:38.000]   if you're doing Thriller December,
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:39.000]   and we will see you next week.
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000]   And until then, as always, stay deep.
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:44.000]   (upbeat music)
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000]   Hey, if you enjoyed the questions today
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000]   that involved your job
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:49.000]   and trying to figure out the deep life
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000]   and how they fit into the deep life,
[01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:54.000]   I think you'll also like episode 320,
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:57.000]   which is titled Jobs and the Deep Life.
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:58.000]   Check it out.
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:13:59.000]   So there's this period.
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:00.000]   It was less than a week,
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:01.000]   but it was a period in which
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:02.000]   I was constantly using my phone.
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:03.000]   It punctuated everything
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:04.000]   that was going on in my life.
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:05.000]   And I'll tell you,
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000]   here's my review of that period.
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:08.000]   It was terrible.
