[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:09.000]   - All right, our next speaker today
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.540]   is hopefully well known to all of you.
[00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:16.440]   Rick Ferry, MS, CFA, is the president of the Bogle Center.
[00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.960]   He has a 35-year career as a financial advisor.
[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.880]   He is the founder of two successful
[00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.520]   financial advisory firms.
[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.480]   He's the author of seven books on investing.
[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.040]   He was a Marine, I don't hold that against him,
[00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.000]   but he was a Marine aviator.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.920]   And he has made 9,547 posts on the Bogleheads forum.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.520]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:41.360]   Rick Ferry.
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:51.320]   - Thank you, Jim, and thanks everyone for being here.
[00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.620]   It's been a wonderful event.
[00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.860]   You'll hear some more remarks from me tonight
[00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.420]   during our reception.
[00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.120]   But I wanna get right into what I have been tasked
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.400]   to do today, this morning, or this afternoon.
[00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.400]   And that's two things.
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.360]   Number one, I'm talking about never try to time the markets.
[00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.720]   And then I'm gonna roll right into the next one,
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.860]   which is number six, which is why you should be using
[00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.420]   index funds whenever you can.
[00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.620]   So let's talk about timing the market.
[00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.220]   This is a picture of the market.
[00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.980]   By the way, I am a Marine, okay?
[00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.740]   We work better with pictures than words.
[00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.640]   (laughing)
[00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.800]   Like some, my son-in-law is Army,
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.840]   so he says, "When you went to OC yesterday,
[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.780]   they give you a box of crayons?"
[00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.800]   Anyway, so we take a lot of Marine jokes,
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.120]   but we get our points across.
[00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.920]   So this is the stock market, right?
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.520]   Normal market, the market fluctuates.
[00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.000]   You cannot predict the market,
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.400]   but you can predict that it will fluctuate.
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.320]   And I don't know whether tomorrow it's gonna be up or down.
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.320]   I don't know next month, next week, next year,
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.160]   whether the market's gonna be up or down,
[00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.280]   but I know it's gonna be one direction or the other
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.800]   because it fluctuates.
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.280]   So that, we can say, is predictable.
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.080]   Where it's going is really not predictable.
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.140]   In fact, this chart is interesting
[00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.000]   because every single year,
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.540]   and this goes all the way back to 1980,
[00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.100]   the market both goes up and goes down.
[00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.040]   Every year, on the bottom where you see the green,
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.640]   that's the amount that the market went down,
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.780]   and on the blue, that's the amount the market went up,
[00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.680]   and then the net amount was where it ended up.
[00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.680]   So markets go up, markets go down, okay?
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.920]   And who's to say during the middle of the year
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.040]   where it's going to go tomorrow?
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.640]   I don't know where it's going to go.
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.080]   I know there's a lot of people who say they know,
[00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.000]   but there are also people who know they don't know,
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.360]   and I'm in the category of knowing I don't know,
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.600]   and it's worked out really well for me
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.040]   because then I can do disciplined investing,
[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.040]   which you've already heard about.
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.040]   So every year there are rallies.
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.280]   Every year there are declines.
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.560]   We just don't know when they're gonna begin
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.380]   and when they're gonna end and how big they're gonna be.
[00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.740]   Other than that, investing is easy, right?
[00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:20.920]   Also, what is it that we do as human beings?
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.640]   Wherever the market has just recently been,
[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.360]   we react to that, okay?
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.440]   When the market is high, we're happy.
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.800]   We're happy.
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.480]   My former partner from years ago used to say
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.880]   it's odd that when something gets more expensive,
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.600]   people want to buy more of it, okay?
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.400]   But that's not true, let's say, of the housing market.
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.800]   Everybody's saying, oh, the price of housing is so high,
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.360]   you know, I don't know if I wanna buy now.
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.800]   I wait 'til it comes back down.
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.160]   But it's funny, with the market, when things do come down,
[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.960]   people say, oh no, I don't wanna buy now, might go lower.
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.040]   This is a terrible place to buy, and start panicking.
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.480]   So, you know, reaction to the ups and downs of the market
[00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.040]   are very emotional, right?
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.560]   And you can't let your emotions drive
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.560]   when you're going to get in and when you're going to get out.
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.600]   By the way, this is from the Investors Intelligence,
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.000]   Bulls and Bears, and just to illustrate
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.180]   what I'm talking about.
[00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.520]   So, when this red line is very high,
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:23.760]   people are very bullish.
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.960]   And if you were to overlay this on top of
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.260]   where the market is, you would see that
[00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.500]   people are very bullish about stocks
[00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.880]   after stocks have already gone up.
[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.920]   And here we are now, this is actually the end of September,
[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.400]   people are bearish.
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.920]   You look along the bottom, the average investor
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:45.040]   is very bearish after the market has already gone down.
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.920]   Okay, but is this predictive of anything?
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.140]   The answer is no.
[00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:54.140]   There's no predictive value at all in this information, zero.
[00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:56.920]   That has been proven time and time again,
[00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.360]   where people think the market is going to go,
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.800]   and where it actually goes, there's zero correlation
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.480]   between those two factors, okay?
[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:09.040]   So, but we feel like the market's going down,
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.560]   and the market has gone down,
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.940]   therefore we believe it's going to go down.
[00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:14.880]   In fact, people will often say to me,
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.600]   "Why should I invest now, the market is going down?"
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.280]   And my answer is, "I don't know where it's going.
[00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:26.260]   "I know where it's been, I know where it is,
[00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.040]   "but I don't know where it's going."
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:30.480]   And there's a big difference.
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:36.440]   In the long run though, if the world stays in
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:42.820]   some sort of a normal growth pattern,
[00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:45.560]   in the United States, if we stay in a normal growth pattern
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:50.560]   for our economy, where eventually corporations
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:54.840]   earn more money, eventually productivity increases,
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:58.080]   maybe trade increases, our GDP,
[00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.480]   which is a measure of all this, adjusted for inflation,
[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:06.480]   goes up, eventually this gets reflected in the stock market.
[00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:09.600]   So the only thing we really need to worry about
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:13.620]   is the world economy going up,
[00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:15.420]   is it going to go up over our lifetimes,
[00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:17.580]   our children's lifetimes, our grandchildren's lifetimes,
[00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.580]   and that I'm willing to make a bet on,
[00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:23.120]   because the alternative to that is not pretty.
[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.420]   So I am gonna be optimistic and say,
[00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:30.420]   I believe global GDP growth will continue,
[00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:35.540]   I believe our growth in this country will continue,
[00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:39.160]   and because of that, corporations will make more money,
[00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.700]   adjusted for inflation, and because of that,
[00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:45.260]   that will ultimately get reflected in higher dividends,
[00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.780]   and the stock market will eventually go up,
[00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:50.920]   and I have to believe that, not only for myself,
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:52.540]   but I have to believe that for my children,
[00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:54.480]   and my grandchildren, and my great-grandchildren,
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:57.880]   and generations beyond, because if we stop believing in that
[00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:00.460]   then we got a problem, we're gonna have a real problem,
[00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:02.820]   you should be buying lead, you know,
[00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:05.460]   brass, things like that. (laughs)
[00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:10.460]   Okay, so in the long run, equity returns do come out
[00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:12.960]   of this global economic growth,
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:15.240]   so even if you don't buy it at the right time,
[00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:19.360]   okay, if you wait a while, you'll be fine in the long run.
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:24.060]   So, great quote by Benjamin Graham,
[00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:27.720]   Jason Zweig knows the quote very well,
[00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:31.360]   because he re-edited a book, or a second edition,
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.280]   if you will, of a Benjamin Graham book,
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:36.880]   but in the short run, the market is a voting machine,
[00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:40.060]   but in the long run, it is a weighing machine,
[00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:42.100]   and it's again, the first part of this
[00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:45.460]   is talking about emotion, the second part
[00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:48.020]   is talking about economic growth.
[00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:50.480]   In the long run, and we're all long-term investors,
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:53.000]   you have to look at it as a weighing machine,
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.660]   although you can use how other people are voting
[00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:59.020]   to your benefit, and the way you do that
[00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:02.860]   is simply by what you already heard Christine talk about,
[00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:05.980]   and others talk about up here,
[00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:09.420]   is you need to be diversified,
[00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:11.220]   and you have your diversified portfolio,
[00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:13.460]   you have your investment plan,
[00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:15.600]   as Jim talked about in the first segment,
[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:19.020]   and what you want to do is just do some rebalancing.
[00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:22.220]   So, if you have a portfolio that happens to be
[00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:27.420]   40% US stocks, 40% international stocks,
[00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:30.100]   whatever I have up there, whatever that says,
[00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:34.180]   and it gets out of whack because stocks went up,
[00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:37.300]   then you would sell some and come back to your,
[00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:40.800]   looks like 30, whatever that says, bonds,
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:44.540]   domestic and foreign, you go back to your original plan.
[00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:46.700]   And then if it goes the other way,
[00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:50.300]   and stocks go down, you do a rebalancing.
[00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:52.220]   Now, then you get back to where you want to be.
[00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:56.220]   This actually adds to your portfolio over time.
[00:08:56.220 --> 00:09:00.140]   So you have a plan, you're investing according to your plan,
[00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:02.180]   you're doing it with discipline,
[00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:04.860]   and you could be doing it through dollar cost averaging,
[00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:05.980]   as Christine talked about,
[00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:08.020]   because you may be putting more money in the market,
[00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:09.500]   so as you're putting more money in the market,
[00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:10.820]   it has dividends pay,
[00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:13.580]   you can use that to do this rebalancing.
[00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:16.580]   And also, if you're retired and you're taking money out,
[00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:18.980]   and it turns out that stocks have gone up,
[00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:21.940]   well, you take it out of the stock side of your portfolio,
[00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:23.980]   and if stocks have gone down,
[00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:25.180]   then you take it out of the bond side.
[00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:28.300]   So you can use distributions,
[00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:30.380]   and you can use new assets going in
[00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:32.220]   to help you do the rebalancing as well.
[00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:33.580]   Taxes are gonna play into this,
[00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:36.460]   and we can talk all about that at another time.
[00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:40.860]   So what you do is you create your plan, as Jim said,
[00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:44.780]   you stick with the plan, and as John Bogle put it,
[00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:49.700]   invest when you can, rebalance, and stay the course.
[00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:52.580]   That works, okay, that works.
[00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:55.740]   Now, I lived through the 1970s, I was in college,
[00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:58.900]   I saw markets like this where interest rates went way up,
[00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:00.980]   and it caused the stock market to go down and all that,
[00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:02.300]   but guess what?
[00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:04.540]   Everything ended up working out just fine.
[00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:05.700]   It took a while,
[00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:07.940]   but we got back to where we were supposed to be.
[00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:09.860]   My personal belief on the market right now
[00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:13.580]   is the problem isn't that the market went down this year,
[00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:17.020]   the problem is it went too darn high last year, okay?
[00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:19.940]   I mean, everything was expensive.
[00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:22.980]   In 2021 was an incredible year because you name it,
[00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:27.540]   it went up in value, stocks, bonds, crypto,
[00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:32.020]   NFTs, real estate, everything went up an awful lot last year
[00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:33.340]   and last year was an ideal year
[00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:35.820]   to be selling some of those stocks
[00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:37.460]   and putting it in other asset classes
[00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:39.740]   like cash or in bonds.
[00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:42.060]   This year might be going back the other way,
[00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:43.900]   I don't know how the year's gonna end up,
[00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:45.780]   but the problem with the market today,
[00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:50.220]   the problem with the fact that the market went down today
[00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:53.660]   actually was 2021, that's where the problem began
[00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:55.580]   because there was so much money sloshing around,
[00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:57.340]   so much of a balloon in asset prices.
[00:10:57.340 --> 00:11:00.380]   Now at the time, again, everybody was euphoric,
[00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:05.380]   it looked great, we love this, let's put more in, right?
[00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:07.660]   You know, you see these kiddies flying through the year
[00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:10.060]   and they're worth $250,000 on your computer,
[00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:12.340]   like, wow, that's great, how do I buy that?
[00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:16.180]   Anyway, so stay the course, come up with a plan,
[00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:19.220]   come up with your asset allocation, stay the course
[00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:22.060]   and don't try to time markets.
[00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:24.640]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:26.700]   you
