[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160]   When you imagine a song, is it the opening you imagine?
[00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.080]   - No, it's kind of a, it's just a,
[00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.040]   I never think opening, I never think final.
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.200]   I think soundscape of how I'm feeling right now.
[00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.320]   So it could be the middle of the song for all I know
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.280]   when I'm, you know, when I'm doing that.
[00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.680]   But my process for me is very much lyrics and melody
[00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.480]   and music really come at the same time.
[00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.920]   Like I, by same time, I mean,
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.920]   I'm, as I'm expressing maybe, you know,
[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:33.840]   I'm feeling like.
[00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.260]   (beatboxing)
[00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:42.320]   Like, it's not that simple, but it's like,
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.560]   I'll hear it, like, it's like,
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.120]   here's all the orchestra and you're kind of just
[00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.500]   pressing all the buttons at once.
[00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.720]   And melody and my voice is just one of those instruments.
[00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.360]   - The following is a conversation with Dan Reynolds,
[00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.680]   the lead singer of Imagine Dragons,
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.920]   one of the most popular bands in the world
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.560]   with over 75 million records sold
[00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.640]   and with four songs being streamed
[00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.460]   over a billion times on Spotify.
[00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.520]   Given all that, Dan is one of the most down to earth,
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.240]   kind, thoughtful and fascinating human beings
[00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.040]   I've ever met, grounded in part
[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.500]   by his lifelong struggle with mental health.
[00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.200]   The darkness, the love and the creative brilliance
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.920]   are all there in this one humble mind.
[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.360]   For this reason and many others, we became fast friends.
[00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.760]   Plus he recently started his journey in programming,
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.340]   which funny enough is where we start this wide ranging,
[00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.280]   deeply personal and fun conversation.
[00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.120]   This is the Lex Friedman podcast.
[00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.240]   To support it, please check out our sponsors
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.440]   in the description.
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.560]   And now dear friends, here's Dan Reynolds.
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.960]   - So we were talking offline that you're not just getting
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.240]   into programming.
[00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.400]   What's the most beautiful program you've ever written?
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.960]   Something that brought you joy?
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.480]   - There's something, I really love completion.
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.140]   It's the reason that I'm addicted to songwriting.
[00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.520]   I like there being nothing
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.600]   and then having some blocks or tools
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.080]   and building them into what you want it to look like.
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.920]   And then I find it incredibly rewarding to stand back
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.200]   and look at what you did at the end.
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.080]   It could be anything.
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.160]   For me, it was as simple to begin with as just,
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.240]   because it's object oriented, like making a cube move.
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.000]   Like as simple as that, understanding that
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.440]   and knowing that I built that and made it do that
[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.920]   is really rewarding.
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.160]   And I think it's the thing that drew me into
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.560]   to wanting to learn more.
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.400]   But as far as what is some grandiose,
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.400]   like some big piece of code that I've done,
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.680]   like absolutely not.
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.520]   It's more, I'm still at a level where it's more like,
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.440]   what is a tutorial that I followed?
[00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.960]   And got, and then, yeah.
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.680]   Yeah, so I couldn't say I'm at a level
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.040]   where I've done anything beautiful at all in code.
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.720]   - But you're also interested in potentially,
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.200]   like your heart is drawn to creating games.
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.340]   - Creating anything.
[00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.440]   - And completing it.
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.280]   - Yeah.
[00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.680]   - That's the good, the feel good is it's done.
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.840]   - Yeah, I mean, I've been working over the last two years
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.040]   with actually a team out of Kiev on,
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.940]   and we can get into that, it's a whole nother story,
[00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:30.680]   but on a computer game.
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.040]   And really have kept that kind of under wraps,
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.360]   but yeah, we're kind of getting to a point now
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.520]   where we have a prototype that we can play
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.760]   and it's a lot of fun.
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.360]   And thankfully all the team members are in safe places now.
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.060]   Things have obviously been on hold for a little bit,
[00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.560]   but when that started is when I really decided,
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.000]   okay, I need to understand base level coding in C#.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.200]   So I'm not an idiot talking to these people.
[00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.280]   So yeah, we've been doing that for a couple of years.
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.800]   - Is there any parallels between the final completion
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.040]   that you feel with programming,
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.140]   which I think is a little bit more definitive.
[00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:08.960]   Like there's debugging, the code doesn't work,
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.020]   it's messy and so on.
[00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:11.480]   There's the early design stages,
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.360]   you're not sure like how to have functions and classes,
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.240]   how it's all gonna work.
[00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.880]   And then it comes together and it's really done
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.080]   'cause it works and there's a cube moving in the screen.
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:21.160]   - Right, right.
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.960]   - Is there any parallels between that and music?
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.000]   'Cause are you really ever done done with a song?
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.920]   - It's exactly the same thing for me,
[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.460]   just in that it's art.
[00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:38.460]   I really believe that we have not fully encapsulated artists.
[00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.960]   Like when we say art, I think most people think,
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.720]   okay, the medium must be painting or drawing
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.320]   or music or writing.
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.640]   But I really believe anytime you're creating something,
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.800]   engineers, for instance,
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.800]   you're creating something with tools that you have
[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.840]   and it can be incredibly beautiful.
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:07.800]   And so yeah, I think, and it's never done.
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.720]   I feel like I look at songs that I've done
[00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:14.480]   and I never felt, you have to let go
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:15.600]   or I have to let go.
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.720]   And that's all I've, I'm just continually
[00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:18.920]   making myself let go.
[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:23.920]   But I look at songs that I've done and wish I had done more
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.640]   or kept going down that road and what would have happened.
[00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:30.520]   And I'm really contained to, because of what our band is
[00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.160]   and what our fans expect.
[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.160]   And there's so much more to it that it's like,
[00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.320]   I'm fitting in a box always.
[00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:41.080]   It's like this song shouldn't be longer
[00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:42.480]   than three minutes and 30 seconds.
[00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.080]   And I don't know if I remember the chorus after I heard it.
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.960]   Maybe I need to hear the chorus three times
[00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:49.120]   instead of those two times.
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.800]   It's like, there's certain, especially in pop music,
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.640]   it's really hard to,
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:06:02.320]   yeah, it feels like there's confines,
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:03.920]   even though people are like, well, there's no confines,
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.600]   but still everybody's writing a pop song
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.200]   that's a few minutes.
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.720]   - Are those explicit in your mind
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.800]   or are they just kind of,
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.840]   the gut is like you said, chorus.
[00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:15.400]   Should you have chorus once, twice or three times?
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.520]   Is that a gut thing or is that a rule thing?
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:18.960]   - You know, I think it's a rule.
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:20.920]   I mean, it's obviously a rule I impose on myself.
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.600]   Nobody's in my house saying,
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.800]   "Hey, Dan, if you don't do this, I'm gonna punish you."
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.760]   There's no major label president that's like,
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:32.520]   "Imagine Dragons needs to make pop music, Dan."
[00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:33.360]   You know what I mean?
[00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.240]   My manager doesn't even tell me that.
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:40.240]   I do it because it's what I perceive to be enjoyable.
[00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:43.640]   I grew up listening to a ton of pop music
[00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:46.680]   and then I ended up being in what is quote unquote,
[00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.560]   a rock band, which I've never perceived it as that,
[00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:53.720]   but that's kind of what the world has called it
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:54.560]   and that's fine.
[00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:58.680]   - So you're a prisoner of a prison
[00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.680]   that you yourself constructed.
[00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:01.520]   There you go.
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:02.360]   The confines are yours.
[00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.600]   - I'm a happy, I guess what I'm trying to say
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.760]   is I'm a happy prisoner of the prison
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.400]   that I have created for myself
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:11.200]   and I made that prison thinking that it was a mansion.
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:12.520]   - So you worked with Rick Rubin.
[00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:14.840]   What does Rick think about your prison?
[00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:21.240]   - Rick was, you know, it was interesting to hear
[00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:25.200]   his outside opinion when we first met
[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:30.200]   'cause my biggest focus for so much of my life,
[00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:34.840]   my biggest fear was, and this stems from, I think,
[00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:36.080]   middle school is when it started,
[00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:40.040]   but everyone being in on a joke except for yourself.
[00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:45.920]   The thought of thinking you're good at something
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:47.840]   and really you're terrible at it
[00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:49.320]   and you're surrounded by people who are saying,
[00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:50.960]   yeah, you're good at it, and then by themselves
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:52.760]   they're like, he's terrible at this.
[00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:57.840]   Not just in regards to music or art, but anything in life
[00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:01.120]   and I think maybe from having six older brothers,
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:05.440]   it stems from that too, always feeling inadequate
[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:07.280]   and like the annoying younger brother.
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:12.840]   But anyway, so Rick's, and that's something
[00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:14.480]   I've learned to let go of as I've gotten older
[00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:18.800]   and had life experiences, but one of the things
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:21.880]   that Rick said really early on that has stuck with me
[00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:26.400]   was he said, yeah, we were Zooming the first time we met.
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:27.880]   He said, I'd really like to work with you
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:32.880]   because I feel like you're not confined to a sound.
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:36.040]   You've done a lot of different sounds
[00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:38.100]   and so it's exciting because I feel like your fans
[00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:41.360]   are forgiving more than other rock bands or bands
[00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.060]   'cause most people when they hear,
[00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:45.920]   when they hear a band, it's like,
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:47.760]   there's a very specific sound with it.
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:51.800]   It's like, they do folk music or they do California rock
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.680]   or they do surf or they do,
[00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:59.160]   and your fans kind of want that.
[00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:03.160]   They want them to do that thing and then they don't do it
[00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:04.280]   and sometimes that goes well,
[00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:07.120]   but a lot of times it doesn't and people,
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:08.480]   critics and everybody is like,
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:11.400]   go back to the thing that you did good and do that.
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:17.220]   Rick felt whether he was right or wrong
[00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:22.220]   that we could do, we hopped genres so much
[00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:26.180]   and that's been to our benefit and detriment, I think.
[00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:28.280]   - Why detriment?
[00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:32.680]   - Because people want you to be something.
[00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:35.320]   It's more, you can believe it more.
[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:40.600]   - It's more authentic if you never change.
[00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:42.080]   - I guess, I don't know.
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:44.920]   I mean, certainly it's not something I subscribe to
[00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:46.160]   because I create music,
[00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:49.880]   but I also grew up listening to a lot of different genres.
[00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:53.440]   I would listen to Cat Stevens
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:55.520]   and the next song would be Biggie
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:58.160]   and then the next song would be Nirvana.
[00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:00.720]   It was like, I like a lot of,
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:03.480]   and then Billy Joel and then Enya.
[00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:04.400]   It was like, you know what I mean?
[00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:07.200]   I was a product and I was a product of the '90s,
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.720]   which if you listen to '90s music,
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:11.040]   it really was, a lot of reason that people say,
[00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:12.560]   well, '90s were terrible.
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:14.120]   Like a lot of people say that.
[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:16.720]   I love the '90s, they were my favorite decade of music.
[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:22.040]   Was there was a lot of genre hopping
[00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:24.920]   and I don't know, I love that.
[00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:27.720]   - So you had the '90s, had the boy bands
[00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:30.760]   and it had Pearl Jam and Nirvana.
[00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:34.000]   - And it had a lot of, like women of the '90s
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.640]   was probably my biggest influence.
[00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:41.040]   Like kind of that like angry rock women of the '90s,
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:43.120]   like Lillanus Morsett, Jagged Little Pill
[00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:45.400]   is one of my favorite records of all time.
[00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:48.200]   The lyrics were so intimate
[00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:52.240]   and I don't know if she was angry or not.
[00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:54.160]   Sorry if she wasn't.
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:55.520]   - Yeah, but there was an anger to it.
[00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:56.360]   - There was angst.
[00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:57.680]   Yeah, it was like angstiness.
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:01.800]   And that in hip hop of the '90s influences me
[00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:02.800]   and then my dad.
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:04.120]   So anything my dad listened to,
[00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:05.520]   which my dad didn't listen to any of that.
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:08.400]   My dad listened to like Harry Nelson, The Beatles,
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:13.400]   Cat Stevens, Bob Dylan, Paul Simon, Billy Joel.
[00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:15.880]   It was very much like singer songwriter.
[00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:17.400]   - Do you mind if we throughout this,
[00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:18.240]   listen to a few songs?
[00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:19.080]   'Cause you mentioned here in this,
[00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:23.640]   and I was actually yesterday and the day before
[00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:24.760]   listening to a lot of his stuff.
[00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:28.520]   And it's just like, damn, he's good.
[00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:32.560]   And not as known as he should be.
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:35.960]   I was getting, do you mind if I play?
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:37.120]   - No, please, yeah.
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:41.360]   - I don't know, not to open this conversation
[00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:42.320]   with a love song.
[00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:45.040]   - I would like that actually, Lex.
[00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:49.680]   - But Without You is an incredible song.
[00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:51.360]   - Oh man, that's, yeah.
[00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:55.960]   - And the heartbreak and the longing.
[00:11:55.960 --> 00:12:00.440]   ♪ No I can't forget the evening ♪
[00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:01.280]   - What?
[00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:04.880]   - He's the best to do it, in my opinion.
[00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:06.760]   In my opinion, he's the best to do it.
[00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:09.240]   - The vocal range.
[00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:13.200]   - And just the sadness of like,
[00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:21.320]   there's something, I don't even wanna talk over him
[00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:23.080]   because this is one of my favorite songs too,
[00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:28.080]   but I think people have a really good bullshit indicator.
[00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:30.120]   ♪ No I can't forget tomorrow ♪
[00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:34.920]   - And music, in my opinion,
[00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:36.520]   whenever I meet a young artist and say,
[00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:38.360]   well, I'm trying to make a new band
[00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:40.880]   and I wanna do something like, how to be successful,
[00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:44.920]   I really think understanding that people
[00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:47.480]   have a really good bullshit indicator
[00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:50.920]   is the most important part of being an artist.
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:54.000]   - And I'll explain what that means, at least to me.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:00.360]   I think that in order to have success
[00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:05.920]   or be a leader or whether it's an art or anything,
[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:08.760]   people need to believe that you believe what you're doing.
[00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:13.840]   I think the best actors,
[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:15.560]   really when they're doing their thing,
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:18.480]   it's like they, it's not acting.
[00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:22.120]   They're in it and it's how they feel
[00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:24.520]   and they're expressing that sorrow or joy
[00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:25.840]   or whatever it is.
[00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:30.840]   Harry, for me, Harry Nilsson, I just believe it.
[00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:33.640]   He sings that and I feel it.
[00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:36.040]   And whether he's the greatest bullshitter of all time
[00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:37.960]   or I don't think that's the case,
[00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:39.560]   I think he probably was singing that song
[00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:43.380]   and he just could transport himself to wherever he was.
[00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:46.880]   It's what makes a great live act.
[00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:49.280]   It's what makes a great song.
[00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:51.640]   And someone could be the best actor
[00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:54.520]   and sing that in the same timbre,
[00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:59.160]   same EQ, same compression, same everything.
[00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:02.160]   And there's some unknown there that I,
[00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:06.040]   I think hopefully it will be known at some point
[00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:07.000]   and it's some scientific thing,
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   but there's something there,
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.600]   the energy or something that people can perceive it
[00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:14.600]   and say true or false.
[00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:16.580]   And if it resonates as true,
[00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:19.320]   it's so much more meaningful and it lives on.
[00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:24.320]   And if it doesn't, that for me is what is good art or bad.
[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:25.920]   For people to dispute over,
[00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:28.000]   well, Sonics should sound like that, that's silly to me.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.880]   It's a song or even a painting.
[00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:35.980]   It's just the truthfulness of it.
[00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:40.440]   - Yeah, the truly great art goes,
[00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:44.440]   has to go to that place where you really are feeling it.
[00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:46.120]   You forget that you're being recorded,
[00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:47.520]   if you get there as an audience,
[00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:48.840]   you really are feeling it.
[00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:53.120]   Yeah, which I totally agree with you.
[00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:56.020]   One of the things that I love about the internet
[00:14:56.020 --> 00:15:01.020]   is it's brought the bullshit detector of the masses
[00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:04.920]   to power, which is beautiful,
[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:09.000]   because then the masses uplift the really authentic.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:09.920]   - Right.
[00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:11.800]   - And even if you didn't write the song,
[00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:15.120]   I think it helps a lot probably if you wrote the song.
[00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:18.960]   But I was a little bit, maybe a lot,
[00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:21.000]   since we're in Vegas, a little heartbroken
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.440]   to find out that Elvis didn't write his songs.
[00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:29.540]   But I like, for example, "Rocketman," Elton John.
[00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:33.880]   To find out that Elton John didn't really know
[00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:36.480]   where the words of "Rocketman" came from,
[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:39.260]   meaning the depths of it, it's interesting.
[00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:42.060]   But nevertheless, he's super authentic
[00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:44.760]   because for Elton John and for Elvis,
[00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:48.320]   there's something in the fun and the darkness
[00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:49.600]   and the entertainment of it.
[00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:51.720]   Like he goes to some place in his mind
[00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:53.480]   that might not be deeply connected
[00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:55.720]   from where the lyrics came from.
[00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:56.760]   - But he relates it.
[00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:59.520]   - He relates it to whatever is in his mind
[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:01.400]   and goes to that place emotionally.
[00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:03.200]   - Yeah, and that's what I think it is.
[00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:04.720]   And that's why an actor, like I said,
[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:07.240]   can be completely honest to me.
[00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:08.980]   Maybe they didn't write the script.
[00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:12.480]   But I've always written all my own lyrics.
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:14.240]   It's a really personal thing to me.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.480]   But I will say, I see people all the time
[00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:22.200]   who are performers like Elton John, for instance,
[00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:26.160]   who didn't write the lyrics that I believe
[00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:29.520]   that it means just as much to them as what I wrote
[00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:33.260]   because they find the meaning in it for themself.
[00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:34.540]   At least the greats do.
[00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:37.600]   And I think that's the difference maker.
[00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:39.200]   And I think you can perceive,
[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:43.120]   and I'm sure you've seen art that doesn't move you,
[00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:44.280]   and maybe it moves someone else,
[00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:45.640]   but for you, for some reason,
[00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:50.120]   you perceive it to be uninteresting to you.
[00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:52.040]   And I feel like a lot of the time,
[00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:53.240]   I'm not saying that, of course,
[00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:54.880]   sonically maybe it's uninteresting to you,
[00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:58.000]   but I think the majority of the time, for myself,
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.400]   I can find inspiration in any sonic value or painting
[00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:04.760]   as long as I see it and I feel truth
[00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:06.920]   from the person that created it.
[00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:10.400]   - Yeah, and for me, the lyrics,
[00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:12.040]   maybe not the entirety of the lyrics,
[00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:16.120]   but a few words can do wonders to take you to a place.
[00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:18.240]   And sometimes those words don't need to be connected
[00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:19.600]   with the other words.
[00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:21.280]   That's the beauty of music.
[00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:25.560]   They're allowed to float in the space of mixed metaphors.
[00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:27.160]   They're allowed to just jump around
[00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:29.600]   and somehow it paints a picture without actually,
[00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:33.200]   what is it, glycerine by Bush?
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:34.040]   - Right.
[00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:35.840]   But it's also how the person says it, right?
[00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:39.960]   It's like, it's the feeling of exactly,
[00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:42.440]   and the same person could say that word 10 other ways
[00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:45.280]   and you don't care, but someone says glycerine
[00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:47.840]   or whatever it is, and it's like,
[00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:49.440]   oh, you know what, I feel that.
[00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:53.400]   The way he said that, he meant it to me.
[00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:54.400]   You know what I mean?
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:59.160]   - No, I can't forget this evening
[00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:00.920]   or your face as you were leaving,
[00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:03.440]   but I guess that's just the way the story goes.
[00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:07.640]   You always smile, but in your eyes, your sorrow shows.
[00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:08.760]   Yes, it shows.
[00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:12.240]   Let me ask you to analyze this song.
[00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:19.200]   So there's a lady possibly who's leaving him.
[00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:22.560]   Do you think he's leaving her or she's leaving him?
[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:23.400]   Do you want to?
[00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:27.720]   ♪ When I think of all my sorrow ♪
[00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:29.720]   ♪ And I had you there ♪
[00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:34.440]   ♪ But then I let you go ♪
[00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:37.160]   ♪ And now it's only fair ♪
[00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:42.160]   ♪ That I should let you know ♪
[00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:43.400]   ♪ What you should know ♪
[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:46.880]   - And the chorus is I can't live if living is without you.
[00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:49.000]   Can't live, I can't give anymore.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:53.600]   He's got a voice on him.
[00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:56.200]   - Yeah, he does, and if you really,
[00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:59.320]   there's been some incredible documentation on his life
[00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:03.880]   and the end of his life, and so my answer to this
[00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:05.960]   is probably skewed based on what I've seen
[00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:09.280]   about his life too, but he was a real alcoholic
[00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:11.960]   at the end of his life, and it destroyed his voice,
[00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:15.240]   and ended up killing him as well.
[00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:22.560]   And so when I hear that, I perceive it as
[00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:28.340]   someone who is destructive and in a destructive place
[00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:30.840]   in life and can't love someone properly,
[00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:32.120]   and so they can't live with them,
[00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:34.120]   but they can't live without them type thing,
[00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:36.720]   which is really something I really identify with
[00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:41.720]   and I think is one of the struggles of life
[00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:43.860]   is loving yourself enough,
[00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:50.060]   it's forgiving yourself for things,
[00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:52.120]   and letting yourself love someone else.
[00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:54.560]   And at least when I listen to Out of Your Hair,
[00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:57.040]   you're being like, and maybe I'm wrong,
[00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:58.480]   but this is how I perceive it at least,
[00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:03.480]   is not loving himself and feeling like he's deserving
[00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:06.240]   of this person, like I have to let you go.
[00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:07.640]   I hear that of course, and people are like,
[00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:09.360]   oh, well, he's breaking up with her,
[00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:11.400]   but there's so much more complexity and nuance
[00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:15.320]   to relationships than that, and my wife and I
[00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:17.900]   went through a really difficult separation,
[00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:22.400]   and that's a story for another day
[00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:24.080]   or a different question or something,
[00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:27.840]   but the nuance of it makes me think of this
[00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:32.240]   when I hear this, which is there's just more
[00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:34.560]   to being with someone or not being with someone
[00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:37.920]   than hey, I think that person's really attractive,
[00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:40.040]   or hey, that person makes me laugh or not,
[00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:42.420]   or I love them and now I don't love them.
[00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:44.680]   Love is such a complex, nuanced thing
[00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:47.640]   that a lot of times there's just more going on
[00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:49.520]   behind the scenes, I think.
[00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:52.520]   - Yeah, on a small tangent on that,
[00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:56.200]   just as a curious question, have you paid any attention
[00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:58.840]   to the Johnny Depp and Amber Heard trials?
[00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:00.920]   - I have watched quite a bit of it
[00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:02.520]   'cause my wife really loves it
[00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:04.640]   and she watches it in bed at night.
[00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:06.600]   - So it's raw, to me it's really,
[00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:10.360]   'cause you've mentioned how complicated love can be,
[00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:12.680]   and I've never seen, I don't care
[00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:14.280]   about the celebrity nature of it,
[00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:17.880]   I don't care if it was, I don't care who it is,
[00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:20.820]   but it's just laid out in such raw form.
[00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:23.040]   - For the world to see it.
[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:24.840]   - For the world to see the toxicity,
[00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:29.720]   but also the passion and the clearly sort of
[00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:33.880]   the drugs and the drinking, but also the longing
[00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:36.680]   and the dreams and I will always be with you,
[00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:41.200]   I will die for you, the places, the rollercoaster of love,
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:46.200]   and it's all there at the end, past the end.
[00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:49.880]   So it's like, I've also recently reread
[00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:51.640]   The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich
[00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:55.800]   about Hitler and Nazi Germany, it's the rise and the fall.
[00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:57.920]   And it's interesting to look at the entirety
[00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:00.360]   of that process after it's all over,
[00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:02.440]   many, many decades after it's all over.
[00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:04.240]   That book in particular written by the person
[00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:07.480]   that was actually there, and so here we're seeing
[00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:11.100]   two people in the context of the courtroom
[00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:14.100]   analyzing this rise and fall of a love affair.
[00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:16.000]   It's fascinating.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   - You know the truth is, I was telling my wife this
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.400]   actually just the other day 'cause she was asking
[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:24.840]   what I thought about it, it makes me really sad.
[00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:26.760]   It's humorous, don't get me wrong,
[00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:30.020]   there's a lot of parts in it that are just really funny.
[00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:35.020]   But I look at it and I also see the internet,
[00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:38.260]   someone's always the villain and someone's the hero,
[00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:39.360]   which is such a funny thing.
[00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:41.480]   And we talked a little about this offline
[00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:44.040]   before we got on this, but I have a real firm belief
[00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:47.680]   in life that it's just more complex than you think,
[00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:49.320]   always, always.
[00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:54.120]   And Johnny, for instance, is very charismatic
[00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:58.480]   and you love him and he's funny and the way he does things
[00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:00.680]   and he looks certain ways and he says things.
[00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:04.400]   You really love him and I feel like,
[00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:05.240]   and maybe I'm wrong on this,
[00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:07.740]   but it looks like the internet has really been like,
[00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:10.840]   Johnny is the winner, Amber is the villain,
[00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:13.980]   and I kinda look at it and I feel like,
[00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:16.980]   were any of you in their bedroom?
[00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:19.520]   Were any of you there for these things?
[00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:21.560]   And I'm not saying one way or the other.
[00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:26.160]   All I see when I look at that is two people
[00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:30.120]   with a lot of deep-seated hurt, anger,
[00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:32.920]   and that anger is so poisonous to both of them
[00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:34.720]   and they're getting through it in the way
[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:36.000]   that they only know how.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.680]   I'm not saying we shouldn't be able to look at parts of it
[00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:43.600]   and laugh about it and stuff and be virtuous or something,
[00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:46.720]   but just that there's not a hero.
[00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:47.840]   - It's more complicated.
[00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:51.320]   - Yeah, I think unless you've been living
[00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:53.280]   with Amber and Johnny, you don't know.
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:55.600]   Just 'cause one seems more charismatic in the moment
[00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:58.360]   or funnier or more believable even,
[00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:01.740]   doesn't mean that their truth is the truth.
[00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:06.840]   - And I feel like there's still love there too,
[00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:07.660]   which makes--
[00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:08.500]   - Oh, that's the hardest part.
[00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:09.720]   He won't even look at her.
[00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:12.680]   He looks down the whole time and maybe people say,
[00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:17.000]   well, it's 'cause of anger or hurt or whatever,
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.840]   but the way that she looks and stuff,
[00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:22.160]   it just feels like there's so much hurt there
[00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:25.160]   that it hurts me to watch it.
[00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:28.120]   I just feel like, oh, my heart just aches for them
[00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:30.640]   and for both of them, and I don't know either of them
[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:33.880]   personally, and I don't know.
[00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:34.720]   Just hurts.
[00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:37.400]   - But I've never seen love laid out
[00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:38.840]   in this raw kind of way.
[00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:42.280]   It makes me feel better about,
[00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:46.920]   it almost gives you, seeing people
[00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:49.120]   who've gone through a struggle in this sort of
[00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:54.120]   mundane kind of way, gives you room to struggle yourself
[00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:55.400]   about the messiness of love.
[00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:56.240]   - So true.
[00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:59.480]   - You're supposed to, relationship is supposed to be
[00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:02.240]   simple and whatever, but this, oh man, this--
[00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:03.680]   - It's like art.
[00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:04.520]   - Yeah.
[00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:07.880]   - And for the record, I don't feel like
[00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:09.280]   it shouldn't be shown.
[00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:11.680]   I think it's actually really beautiful art,
[00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:13.040]   and I agree there's gonna be a lot of people
[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:15.480]   who walk away from it and are changed in certain ways
[00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:16.840]   or look at things different.
[00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:18.040]   I'm not saying it's changing the whole world,
[00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:19.680]   the Johnny Depp trial, but it's art.
[00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:21.000]   It's just like you would look at a painting
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.200]   and it might affect you.
[00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:27.200]   My only commentary is more that there's not,
[00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:29.240]   I think it's silly when people say who's right
[00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:31.000]   and who's wrong and who's the clear villain
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.240]   and who's the, like we love as humans,
[00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:34.760]   we have to have an answer for everything.
[00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:36.080]   We have to put everything in a box,
[00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:37.680]   and it's like, well, we're looking at this
[00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:41.080]   and we're deciding you're right and you're wrong,
[00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:44.440]   and I just think it's silly unless it's your life.
[00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:46.200]   - So speaking of heroes and villains
[00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:49.840]   and highs and lows, you grew up in Las Vegas,
[00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:52.080]   and you said that Vegas is a performing town,
[00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:55.080]   a town of high stakes, drama and eccentricity.
[00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:58.360]   It's a town of high highs and low lows,
[00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:00.480]   and I'll be damned if my therapist didn't point
[00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:03.180]   that correlation out to me personally a long time ago.
[00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:08.380]   So to me, Vegas, from the outside,
[00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:09.940]   is romanticized by certain movies.
[00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:14.240]   The lows define the beauty of this town,
[00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:18.000]   and certain movies, so to me, "Casino"
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:23.120]   with Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and Sharon Stone,
[00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:26.560]   "Leaving Las Vegas" with Nicolas Cage,
[00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:29.400]   "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"
[00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:34.400]   with the Johnny Depp play, Hunter Stompson.
[00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:38.720]   First of all, what's your favorite representation
[00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:41.760]   of Vegas from a darker side,
[00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:45.320]   and do you draw any wisdom in sight
[00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:48.920]   from the darkness, the lows and the highs
[00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:51.520]   in those movies, or is it over-romanticized?
[00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:56.480]   - So I grew up in a really conservative Mormon family,
[00:26:56.480 --> 00:27:00.960]   and Vegas was established by the Mormons and the mob.
[00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:05.060]   Those were like the two very different worlds
[00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:08.480]   that created what Vegas is, and if you live in Vegas,
[00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:09.800]   it really shows in a lot of ways
[00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:13.720]   because Vegas has the strip and the parties
[00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:17.240]   and the craziness, but it also has very neighborhoods
[00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:21.280]   and big families and conservative people
[00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:24.680]   and liberal people living together
[00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:29.240]   in a really interesting way, and for me,
[00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:33.560]   growing up here, for instance, was a lot of driving
[00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:35.020]   on the freeway, my mom being like,
[00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:37.000]   "Children, close your eyes, there's a naked woman
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.520]   "on that billboard," and everything,
[00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:40.440]   "Okay, Mom," on our way to church,
[00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:41.640]   you know what I mean?
[00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:44.160]   But also being like, "Whoa, this is crazy."
[00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:45.000]   You know what I mean?
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.500]   Like, taking in whatever I could when I could.
[00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:48.340]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:53.280]   - So I saw, and I'm grateful for that.
[00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:55.220]   I really love that I didn't grow up as a Mormon
[00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:57.040]   in, for instance, Utah or something,
[00:27:57.040 --> 00:28:00.440]   like the typical place because I saw both sides
[00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:03.120]   and I appreciated something from both sides,
[00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:05.600]   and now, as a person now who's not religious
[00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:10.600]   but just spiritually minded, I'm grateful
[00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:14.880]   for that divergent character, that juxtaposition,
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:18.360]   dual-edged sword that Vegas is, and I try to apply
[00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:20.640]   that to everything in life, which is,
[00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:23.160]   like Johnny Depp in "The Ember,"
[00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:25.060]   it's like there's two sides to every story.
[00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:27.400]   There's always two sides to every coin,
[00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:29.480]   and there's something to be said for both.
[00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:33.880]   Like, I try to see people and even if,
[00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:36.360]   it's just, yeah, I try to apply that to life.
[00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:39.560]   As far as a movie that personifies Vegas
[00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:42.760]   or something in that medium that personifies Vegas
[00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:46.120]   in a way that resonates with me.
[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:47.560]   - Don't say "Hangover."
[00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:49.480]   - No, no, yeah.
[00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:51.400]   I also, like, I wasn't even allowed
[00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:53.880]   to watch PG-13 movies growing up.
[00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:56.240]   So a lot of the movies that you're saying,
[00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:59.960]   like, I either didn't see, I didn't have cable television.
[00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:01.800]   I wasn't like a pilgrim, but I had a really,
[00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:03.520]   really conservative upbringing.
[00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:08.080]   - So it didn't define your intellectual development.
[00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:11.140]   - No, no, I just, I can't think of any movie
[00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:12.480]   that comes to mind where I'm like,
[00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:14.160]   that's my Vegas movie, you know what I mean?
[00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:16.500]   Like, I'm sure, I've seen some of the movies you've said now
[00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:19.320]   but I can't think of one that I'm like,
[00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:25.180]   actually personifies Vegas in a way that feels honest to me.
[00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:29.000]   Or like, wasn't there a Chevy Chase?
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.320]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:31.880]   - I think that's maybe the only one I thought of
[00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:33.240]   that came to mind where I was like,
[00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:34.720]   'cause I love Chevy Chase so much
[00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:38.200]   that maybe it's one of his Vegas vacation or something.
[00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:40.920]   - Yeah, but that's more like lighthearted,
[00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:42.400]   absurd, that kind of stuff.
[00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:44.400]   - Right, it's not like, I guess what I would say
[00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:48.120]   is there's no truth that I've seen of Vegas.
[00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:49.880]   'Cause what I see of Vegas is,
[00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:54.040]   there's obviously like the parties and stuff
[00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:56.440]   and the nightlife, which I'm not a big party person
[00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:58.840]   so I haven't really experienced much of that.
[00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:03.680]   But there's also drugs and I have a strange relationship
[00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:06.320]   with drugs 'cause I've lost a few friends to drug overdoses
[00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:09.520]   and so I don't, that's not romantic to me.
[00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:12.640]   But there's also like, yeah, I mean,
[00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:14.480]   you asked for a dark reflection of it.
[00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:17.920]   I guess I certainly see a dark reflection to Vegas
[00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:20.520]   and I feel like Vegas is typically personified
[00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:22.760]   as like, at the tables and every, this.
[00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:25.600]   But it's also like, I have friends who've lost
[00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:27.680]   all their money to gambling addiction
[00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:29.600]   and so it's like, what I guess--
[00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:31.120]   - A dark underbelly to the whole thing.
[00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:32.880]   - Yeah, somebody maybe needs to make,
[00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:34.480]   maybe that's an open spot, there needs to be
[00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:36.840]   a dark side to Vegas.
[00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:41.000]   And it's about Mormons in Vegas dying of drug overdose
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:42.560]   or getting shot by the mob.
[00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:43.400]   - Yeah.
[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:48.360]   So you mentioned your spirituality.
[00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:51.840]   You've said that having a crisis of faith
[00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:56.840]   or just the philosophical question of asking who is God,
[00:30:57.080 --> 00:31:01.840]   does God exist, and thinking of the flip side of that,
[00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:04.440]   of mortality, what happens when we die,
[00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:07.560]   those kinds of things were extremely difficult,
[00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:12.560]   deep things for you in terms of your development,
[00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:14.840]   the whole process of figuring that out.
[00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:18.480]   Why does it hurt so much to lose faith in God?
[00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:22.960]   - Yeah, I would say that the seeking of God,
[00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:25.440]   let's say that, is an obsession for me
[00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:27.640]   and has been since I was young.
[00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:32.640]   I really feel that I'm a deep, deep, deeply committed
[00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:38.400]   to finding answers in life, and there's some answers
[00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:39.600]   that I don't think there's an answer to,
[00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:42.080]   and I'm also very OCD by nature,
[00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:43.920]   so I just don't give up to that.
[00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:46.960]   I'm like, well, there must be somewhere in Tibet,
[00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:50.000]   there's some teacher, or there's somebody out there
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.600]   that has the answer, or maybe it's yet to be found,
[00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:54.500]   I'm gonna find it.
[00:31:55.420 --> 00:31:59.660]   I'm really, my life has been to date,
[00:31:59.660 --> 00:32:03.580]   probably unhealthily committed to finding answers
[00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:08.580]   about God, or the lack thereof, and mortality.
[00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:13.820]   It's all I sing about, it's all our records have been about.
[00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:15.500]   - Who do you think is God?
[00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:17.620]   Have you ever gotten a glimpse?
[00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:20.820]   - You know, I will say the closest I feel like I have been
[00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:25.820]   to experiencing God is, and this sounds so,
[00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:30.780]   maybe, I don't know, I don't know how it sounds,
[00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:33.540]   but is through ayahuasca for me.
[00:32:33.540 --> 00:32:34.540]   That's my honest answer for you.
[00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:38.060]   I feel like I had pretty much given up all hope
[00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:41.540]   of there being anything greater than us being,
[00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:47.660]   evolving and being here and then dying,
[00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:50.100]   and you're gone and that's it, and nothingness,
[00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:53.180]   and from nothingness we came and nothingness we go.
[00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:57.660]   To where I am now, which is there are answers to be found.
[00:32:57.660 --> 00:33:00.260]   I don't know them, I don't know what God looks like,
[00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:02.980]   or if God is anything to do with the word God
[00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:06.420]   in the way that we say it, but I do believe,
[00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:11.380]   pretty fervently, that there is more to be found.
[00:33:11.380 --> 00:33:13.100]   - Is it motion sensor, or no?
[00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:14.140]   - I don't know what that was.
[00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:16.300]   - Looked like they have all died, actually.
[00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:18.340]   - Do you know which one is it?
[00:33:18.340 --> 00:33:19.620]   Is it this one right here?
[00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:20.620]   - Why don't I just take it out,
[00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:21.980]   but then we can do Darwin.
[00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:22.820]   - That's fine.
[00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:24.820]   - I'm gonna take it out.
[00:33:24.820 --> 00:33:28.740]   I do wanna hold this chair.
[00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:31.580]   See if I can get it like this, yeah.
[00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:37.300]   I'm almost there.
[00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:39.900]   I really don't know how I'm gonna catch this though.
[00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:42.060]   (laughs)
[00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:44.660]   There's gotta be like some saying about this.
[00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:45.500]   There we go.
[00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:46.860]   (laughs)
[00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:47.980]   - It's no Chinese proverb.
[00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:48.820]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:51.860]   - How many people does it take to,
[00:33:51.860 --> 00:33:53.460]   what is it, unscrew a light bulb?
[00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:54.300]   - A light bulb.
[00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:55.140]   It was hot too.
[00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:57.740]   It was like I was doing the two finger technique.
[00:33:57.740 --> 00:34:00.100]   - I'm glad you survived that.
[00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:01.100]   - Thanks.
[00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:03.380]   - That'd be pretty ironic if we're talking about mortality,
[00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:04.900]   and then this would be it for you.
[00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:06.220]   - In that moment.
[00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:09.660]   - I've never done ayahuasca,
[00:34:09.660 --> 00:34:11.300]   so it's a mixture of two plants.
[00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:14.980]   One of them is DMT, but a lot of people I really respect,
[00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:16.820]   very, very intelligent people,
[00:34:18.220 --> 00:34:21.540]   had profound experiences with ayahuasca.
[00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:22.380]   What is that?
[00:34:22.380 --> 00:34:23.260]   Where do you go?
[00:34:23.260 --> 00:34:24.460]   Where does the mind go?
[00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:26.380]   What the heck is up with that?
[00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:29.980]   - I'll first say that I can't even smoke weed.
[00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:33.020]   I really do not enjoy it,
[00:34:33.020 --> 00:34:35.540]   because I hate to let go of control.
[00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:39.860]   If I feel out of control in life,
[00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:41.920]   it's like one of my biggest weaknesses.
[00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:43.300]   It's like very scary for me.
[00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:47.860]   I don't, and some people really enjoy letting go in that way.
[00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:49.260]   I really don't.
[00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:53.980]   I was pretty terrified to make the jump into ayahuasca,
[00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:57.140]   but my wife, who I deeply respect,
[00:34:57.140 --> 00:35:04.060]   made a profound change through ayahuasca, and I saw it.
[00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:05.060]   - She led the way.
[00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:07.380]   - Yeah, and it wasn't a strange,
[00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:10.620]   like I think most, we have a thing in America
[00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:14.260]   that's like a misconception, a stigma on psychedelics
[00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:19.260]   where it's a drug, and it makes some people crazy,
[00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:22.060]   and then you're gonna be on the street,
[00:35:22.060 --> 00:35:23.020]   and you're gonna be out of your mind,
[00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:28.020]   or you're gonna become a crazy person, basically.
[00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:31.940]   I think I really bought into that notion
[00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:34.740]   because, again, I wasn't even raised with cable TV.
[00:35:34.740 --> 00:35:35.580]   You know what I mean?
[00:35:35.580 --> 00:35:38.700]   Ayahuasca is very, I didn't, you know.
[00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:40.660]   You can imagine what that was like for a Mormon kid.
[00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:41.540]   I didn't know anything about it
[00:35:41.540 --> 00:35:42.740]   and never touched drugs at all,
[00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:45.140]   never even touched a cigarette, you know?
[00:35:45.140 --> 00:35:50.060]   Anyway, so I think we have this misconception about it
[00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:52.860]   where Americans are quick to go to their doctor
[00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:57.860]   and take any medication or drug,
[00:35:57.860 --> 00:36:02.860]   but, you know, whoa, when it comes to psychedelics.
[00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:08.500]   Anyway, that being said,
[00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:10.140]   so I had that trepidation going into it,
[00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:11.820]   but I really love and respect my wife,
[00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:13.900]   and I saw it make a profound impact in her life
[00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:18.500]   where she suddenly was able to heal
[00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:19.780]   from a lot of trauma that she had.
[00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:22.740]   She had a really, she went through a lot in her life,
[00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:24.460]   and it really helped her heal,
[00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:27.140]   but it also set her in a new path spiritually
[00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:32.140]   that seemed really like a place that I wanted to be.
[00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:35.580]   So I did it, and I did it twice.
[00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:37.540]   The first time it didn't really have an effect on me,
[00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:39.640]   which happens to a lot of people, I guess.
[00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:42.460]   I drank this little thing,
[00:36:42.460 --> 00:36:45.180]   and there was this shaman who came over from overseas
[00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:50.180]   that was really, had been in the plant world for decades
[00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:53.200]   and was a really incredible,
[00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:57.420]   I don't even know if he likes to be called shaman, but.
[00:36:57.420 --> 00:37:00.300]   - So it's supposed to be like 30, 60 minute to take effect,
[00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:05.300]   and a few hours, the journey lasts--
[00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:07.500]   - About four hours. - Four hours.
[00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:08.700]   - Yeah, so the second time I took it,
[00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:12.460]   I took it in, I would say 20, 30 minutes in, exactly.
[00:37:12.460 --> 00:37:17.460]   I started to feel like I was the dimension
[00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:23.900]   of what is reality, the curtain was pulled open,
[00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:28.900]   and there was a lot more to discover.
[00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:31.620]   And it really blew my mind in a way
[00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:34.540]   that I think it would probably blow anybody's mind
[00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:36.420]   if, for instance, God descended,
[00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:38.820]   or some Christian God or whatever it is,
[00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:40.180]   we all think it'd be this beautiful thing,
[00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:42.740]   but in reality, it would probably make people super fearful
[00:37:42.740 --> 00:37:45.180]   and think that they've lost their mind.
[00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:48.140]   Like I've always, yeah, I've always joked
[00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:50.740]   that if the Mormon God came down and told my mom,
[00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:53.860]   if God himself came down and told my mom,
[00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:57.140]   "Mormonism is incorrect," she would say, "Satan!"
[00:37:57.140 --> 00:37:59.380]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - You know?
[00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:01.140]   I think our minds are just not prepared
[00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:05.820]   for a lot of anything that's really extreme,
[00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:07.420]   and it was very extreme.
[00:38:07.420 --> 00:38:10.620]   It was like the curtain of life was cut open,
[00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:13.460]   which scared me, but then I felt very much,
[00:38:13.460 --> 00:38:15.700]   and a lot of people that I've talked to
[00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:17.620]   have a similar thing where I felt very much
[00:38:17.620 --> 00:38:20.900]   like I was either communicating with something
[00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:23.620]   that was perceived as God to me,
[00:38:23.620 --> 00:38:28.260]   or highest sense of self, or mind, or Mother Earth,
[00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:29.820]   or it's called so many different names,
[00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:31.380]   but it's really, it's very,
[00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:35.100]   a lot of people have a very spiritual,
[00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:37.660]   similar experience with ayahuasca,
[00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:40.260]   and just in that it's like this kind of profoundness.
[00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:43.700]   It wasn't like, there was nothing, at least for me,
[00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:48.180]   that felt like just like psychedelic,
[00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:49.780]   funny cartoons or something.
[00:38:49.780 --> 00:38:51.940]   It was like I'm about to go on a journey,
[00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:55.700]   and I'm communicating with something
[00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:58.260]   that feels incredibly wise.
[00:38:58.260 --> 00:39:00.820]   Showed me a lot of things in my life,
[00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:02.300]   kind of almost like from a bird's eye,
[00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:03.940]   almost like I was looking through a video camera
[00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:05.940]   at a younger me.
[00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:08.700]   There was a particular thing that it communicated to me.
[00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:15.780]   I really have a hard time with accepting success
[00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:16.980]   and not feeling,
[00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:21.380]   like feeling undeserving or something.
[00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:22.900]   I can't quite put it into words,
[00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:25.820]   but of my position and what I've been given,
[00:39:25.820 --> 00:39:27.920]   I've been given so much,
[00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:32.940]   and it showed me this thing from when I was young
[00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:35.140]   and explained to me why I am where I am now.
[00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:40.180]   To this day, it did not feel like myself
[00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:41.180]   telling myself that.
[00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:42.940]   That's the only way I can explain it.
[00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:45.100]   And there was a lot more that it showed me
[00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:47.580]   and that was incredibly healing for me.
[00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:49.740]   But just to be,
[00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:54.260]   to put it into a short thing,
[00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:56.060]   'cause there's so much to this,
[00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:00.700]   I walked away feeling very convinced
[00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:05.700]   that there is more to be known for sure.
[00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:10.900]   And a lot of my deep things that were traumatic for me
[00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:14.260]   didn't feel traumatic anymore,
[00:40:14.260 --> 00:40:16.140]   specifically crisis of faith.
[00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:20.900]   I was very angry at my parents and my community
[00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:25.780]   for raising me in what I perceived to be falsehoods.
[00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:32.220]   And that, I felt like the bedrock of everything I believed
[00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:34.020]   was ripped out for me in my 20s.
[00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:37.140]   And then it was like, good luck in life.
[00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:39.780]   But really my parents had given me everything that they could
[00:40:39.780 --> 00:40:43.060]   and they believe that very much so still.
[00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:46.060]   But a naive young me was angry
[00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:48.420]   and felt like they had been duped
[00:40:48.420 --> 00:40:50.580]   and thus I had been duped.
[00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:55.140]   But ayahuasca really showed me this roadmap of like,
[00:40:55.140 --> 00:40:57.460]   this is truth and you're concerning yourself
[00:40:57.460 --> 00:41:01.020]   about a grain of sand, which is Mormonism or whatever it is.
[00:41:01.020 --> 00:41:03.780]   And there may be some truths in that tiny grain of sand
[00:41:03.780 --> 00:41:05.620]   and there may be falsities.
[00:41:05.620 --> 00:41:07.300]   But so is all these other grains of sand,
[00:41:07.300 --> 00:41:08.900]   like focus on the truth,
[00:41:08.900 --> 00:41:11.660]   stop focusing on these little details that are meaningless
[00:41:11.660 --> 00:41:14.540]   and forgive and let go of people believing
[00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:16.620]   in those things to begin with.
[00:41:16.620 --> 00:41:17.460]   I don't know if that makes sense,
[00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:20.340]   but that was like the core thing I was taught
[00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:22.140]   and to let go of control,
[00:41:22.140 --> 00:41:24.340]   stop needing to control everything.
[00:41:24.340 --> 00:41:26.740]   - And it felt like the wisdom was coming from elsewhere.
[00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:30.260]   - It's really, I do not believe,
[00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:31.580]   at least in my current self,
[00:41:31.580 --> 00:41:36.100]   I don't have the mindfulness that I believe
[00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:38.860]   that exists in me to reach a lot of the conclusions
[00:41:38.860 --> 00:41:39.700]   that I did.
[00:41:39.700 --> 00:41:41.060]   And there was a lot more to it
[00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:43.380]   than it would be for like a late night conversation with you
[00:41:43.380 --> 00:41:46.280]   but it's so hard to put it into,
[00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:49.140]   you feel like a crazy person.
[00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:50.940]   At least anytime I talk about ayahuasca
[00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:51.860]   to someone who hasn't done it,
[00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:54.140]   I'm like, I don't even know where to begin.
[00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:56.380]   How do you explain to someone that you felt like
[00:41:56.380 --> 00:42:00.260]   that a multiple dimension type thing happened
[00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:03.260]   in a way that like putting it into words is,
[00:42:03.260 --> 00:42:04.660]   and none of it was words, by the way,
[00:42:04.660 --> 00:42:05.900]   that was communicated to me.
[00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:09.980]   It was like, you know how people talk about telepathy
[00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:12.220]   and if it existed, it would be like,
[00:42:12.220 --> 00:42:14.200]   I could communicate to you in such a deeper way.
[00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:17.060]   I'm so confined by me having to articulate these words
[00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:18.620]   and put them in a sentence to you, Lex,
[00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:21.540]   and then tell you like, if only I could just be like,
[00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:24.620]   and emotions do that sometimes, right?
[00:42:24.620 --> 00:42:26.620]   You could see my emotions and be like,
[00:42:26.620 --> 00:42:28.440]   oh, that communicates a lot.
[00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:30.860]   So that's what it felt like to me with ayahuasca
[00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:33.140]   is it felt like it was communicating to me
[00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:35.580]   very clear things, but it wasn't like,
[00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:38.580]   Daniel, it's me, mother earth.
[00:42:38.580 --> 00:42:41.340]   Let me relax, sit back, let me show you.
[00:42:41.340 --> 00:42:44.540]   But it was very clear to me what was being said.
[00:42:44.540 --> 00:42:46.700]   And no, it did not feel like me,
[00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:50.120]   but maybe smarter people than me who've done it would say,
[00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:51.460]   well, it was you and blah, blah, blah.
[00:42:51.460 --> 00:42:53.540]   Like, I don't know, but it was very convincing.
[00:42:53.540 --> 00:42:55.740]   - There's a lot of stuff in that subconscious
[00:42:55.740 --> 00:42:59.340]   that we haven't explored.
[00:42:59.340 --> 00:43:01.660]   Like, we haven't explored the depths of the ocean.
[00:43:01.660 --> 00:43:03.660]   We haven't really figured out what's that,
[00:43:03.660 --> 00:43:06.340]   the younging shadow, what's going on underneath
[00:43:06.340 --> 00:43:08.700]   the surface of our conscious mind.
[00:43:08.700 --> 00:43:10.420]   And what is that connecting to?
[00:43:10.420 --> 00:43:13.540]   Is that just inside our mind or is it some kind of,
[00:43:13.540 --> 00:43:15.860]   is there some kind of collective intelligence going on
[00:43:15.860 --> 00:43:18.940]   where all humans are connected to one kind of
[00:43:18.940 --> 00:43:20.940]   greater organism?
[00:43:20.940 --> 00:43:22.540]   Like, what is consciousness?
[00:43:22.540 --> 00:43:25.660]   We have a lot of hubris in thinking we understand
[00:43:25.660 --> 00:43:28.660]   any of it, like how the mind works at all.
[00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:32.180]   Like, what is it, like, where,
[00:43:32.180 --> 00:43:34.940]   what is the origin of consciousness?
[00:43:34.940 --> 00:43:37.500]   What is the origin of intelligence?
[00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:39.140]   There's a lot of hubris about this.
[00:43:39.140 --> 00:43:43.220]   We give each other PhDs and Nobel Prizes
[00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:46.860]   and congratulate ourselves as if we figured it all out.
[00:43:46.860 --> 00:43:48.780]   But humility is helpful here.
[00:43:48.780 --> 00:43:50.340]   Nevertheless, that is the question
[00:43:50.340 --> 00:43:52.020]   that humans have been asking for
[00:43:52.020 --> 00:43:56.740]   ever since humans were humans,
[00:43:56.740 --> 00:43:59.960]   which is the question of mortality, the question of God.
[00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:06.000]   So whether it's Hamlet, to be or not to be,
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:08.700]   I think that's the hardest and most important question.
[00:44:08.700 --> 00:44:13.060]   Albert Camus asked, "Why live?"
[00:44:13.060 --> 00:44:18.740]   So in terms of crisis of faith,
[00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:20.060]   in terms of your search for truth,
[00:44:20.060 --> 00:44:21.580]   in terms of some of the dark places
[00:44:21.580 --> 00:44:23.220]   you've gone in your mind,
[00:44:23.220 --> 00:44:25.180]   what's a good answer to this question?
[00:44:25.180 --> 00:44:29.580]   So for Camus with "Myth of Sisyphus,"
[00:44:29.580 --> 00:44:32.780]   it was the question of suicide,
[00:44:32.780 --> 00:44:36.560]   is what's the purpose?
[00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:40.780]   Like, what's a good answer to why I keep going,
[00:44:40.780 --> 00:44:42.500]   especially when you're struggling,
[00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:44.240]   especially when you're not,
[00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:48.960]   when you're feeling hopeless,
[00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:51.520]   when you're feeling like a burden,
[00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:54.920]   in this search for truth,
[00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:57.320]   where you feel like you're surrounded by lies,
[00:44:57.320 --> 00:44:59.120]   what's a good answer to why I live?
[00:44:59.120 --> 00:45:02.560]   - I think-- - You ever found one?
[00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:06.360]   - Well, the simple answer right now is to say for,
[00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:09.200]   it's very easy once you have kids to say,
[00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:10.600]   the right answer is you just,
[00:45:10.600 --> 00:45:13.480]   of course, you brought these kids into the world,
[00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:15.200]   so you have a responsibility
[00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:18.400]   that I feel deeply as a father to them
[00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:21.580]   to always be there for as long as I humanly can,
[00:45:21.580 --> 00:45:23.200]   and to take care of them and protect them.
[00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:26.400]   It's the most innate sense in me.
[00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:31.400]   I'm just, it's wired in my animal existence.
[00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:33.760]   So if I take that away, right,
[00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:35.160]   'cause that's kind of cheating.
[00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:37.240]   - Let's put that aside, 'cause it is cheating.
[00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:38.080]   - It's cheating.
[00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:41.820]   - There's still some fundamental way in which you're alone.
[00:45:41.820 --> 00:45:44.000]   - Yeah, and to that,
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:48.080]   that actually has been a real struggle for me,
[00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:49.120]   for many years.
[00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:52.040]   I had a real turning point early in my career
[00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:57.040]   where we were flying somewhere overseas,
[00:45:57.040 --> 00:46:02.120]   and we were in a really small plane,
[00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:04.440]   and the lights went out,
[00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:06.560]   and all these red lights were flashing,
[00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:09.080]   and the plane just started to dive.
[00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:13.520]   Completely scariest plane experience I've ever been in.
[00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:16.200]   My manager was next to me, who's my brother.
[00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:20.640]   He was crying and texting his wife a goodbye.
[00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:23.360]   That's how crazy this moment was.
[00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:24.800]   - Was it real, like genuine?
[00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:28.800]   - Genuine, like genuine engine went out,
[00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:33.760]   plane is going down, pilots looking crazy in the front,
[00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:35.340]   and it was a really tiny jet.
[00:46:35.340 --> 00:46:39.480]   And like I said, my brother next to me crying,
[00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:40.800]   typing a text to his wife.
[00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:42.020]   Really, really scary.
[00:46:42.020 --> 00:46:45.720]   And I felt nothing.
[00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:48.640]   I genuinely sat there, and I was like,
[00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:52.640]   this might actually be nice.
[00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:56.800]   Like I really felt like this goes down,
[00:46:56.800 --> 00:47:00.880]   and like, oh man, life sucks, and it's hard.
[00:47:00.880 --> 00:47:02.940]   And that sounds so ridiculous, I know, to say,
[00:47:02.940 --> 00:47:05.640]   because again, I'm in a different place now,
[00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:07.320]   and I see my life for what it is.
[00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:09.360]   But at that moment, I did not.
[00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:11.640]   - So life was primarily defined by suffering.
[00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:14.320]   It was a burden, and this is so being burden-lifted.
[00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:16.200]   - I was incredibly depressed.
[00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:20.760]   I had been trying different medications since I was young,
[00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:24.480]   and I just had not found anything that was working for me.
[00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:27.680]   And then I was in a faith crisis, lost all my faith,
[00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:31.440]   started a band that just became,
[00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:33.640]   I wasn't ever thinking that this band,
[00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:35.960]   I was like, when you call your band Imagine Dragons,
[00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:38.480]   you're not thinking that band's gonna be big, okay?
[00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:42.840]   It was like, I was like, this was like a side project
[00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:43.800]   that was fun for me.
[00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:45.800]   It was like art in college.
[00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:47.520]   I was in school, and I was like,
[00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:49.040]   man, I hate this biology class.
[00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:50.360]   I'm gonna write down band names.
[00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:51.840]   Like, you know what I mean?
[00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:55.100]   It was not, hey, put everything aside.
[00:47:55.100 --> 00:47:56.880]   This is my career, let's go.
[00:47:56.880 --> 00:48:00.280]   Like, it just, it happened.
[00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:03.120]   And I'm an introvert by nature.
[00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:06.120]   I'm really not an extroverted person who likes to go out,
[00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:09.760]   and like, I like to be at home with a couple friends
[00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:12.400]   and have a late night conversation over good food.
[00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:14.200]   Like, that to me is a perfect night.
[00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:17.480]   Read a good book, listen to a podcast, go on a walk.
[00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:21.580]   You know, those are things that I really, really enjoy.
[00:48:21.580 --> 00:48:23.120]   And suddenly I'm in this life where I'm like,
[00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:26.880]   supposed to be something that I really don't wanna be,
[00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:29.320]   except for on stage, which is a really fast,
[00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:31.080]   like, strange thing to me, which is on stage,
[00:48:31.080 --> 00:48:35.840]   I feel so free and exuberant and like an extrovert.
[00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:37.520]   And then I come off and I just feel like,
[00:48:37.520 --> 00:48:38.840]   shrivel back into a shell.
[00:48:38.840 --> 00:48:41.720]   Like, it's, music does that for me,
[00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:43.520]   and performing on a stage does that for me.
[00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:44.880]   - Can we take a small tangent on that?
[00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:45.720]   - Yeah, yeah, of course.
[00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:47.880]   - What's the high, can we go through that,
[00:48:47.880 --> 00:48:52.440]   the introvert that wants to cuddle up and read a book.
[00:48:52.440 --> 00:48:54.400]   You're the front man of one of the,
[00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:59.160]   if not the biggest rock bands today,
[00:48:59.160 --> 00:49:01.180]   playing in front of huge crowds.
[00:49:01.180 --> 00:49:04.440]   What's the high of that,
[00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:06.940]   and how can you land back on Earth?
[00:49:10.140 --> 00:49:15.140]   - The high of it, it's incredibly beautiful
[00:49:15.140 --> 00:49:20.860]   to walk on a stage, sing these songs that you wrote,
[00:49:20.860 --> 00:49:25.580]   and see it resonate with people around you
[00:49:25.580 --> 00:49:27.340]   and sing with them.
[00:49:27.340 --> 00:49:29.620]   Different cultures, different places,
[00:49:29.620 --> 00:49:32.420]   celebrate life, it's suddenly the world seems like
[00:49:32.420 --> 00:49:34.100]   a fantastic place.
[00:49:34.100 --> 00:49:37.380]   It feels like we're all on the same team.
[00:49:37.380 --> 00:49:38.660]   - It's like one big hug.
[00:49:38.660 --> 00:49:40.820]   - Yeah, it's like everybody in that room gets it,
[00:49:40.820 --> 00:49:43.720]   and they all, it just,
[00:49:43.720 --> 00:49:47.820]   it feels like what you want the world to be,
[00:49:47.820 --> 00:49:50.640]   which is just this coexisting unit of people,
[00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:55.640]   and it's not even about, it's incredible, for sure,
[00:49:55.640 --> 00:49:57.300]   it's incredible, and I love it,
[00:49:57.300 --> 00:49:59.780]   and I wouldn't do it unless I loved it.
[00:49:59.780 --> 00:50:01.620]   And then you walk off stage and you turn on the news,
[00:50:01.620 --> 00:50:04.500]   and it's like, you see, we're all against each other,
[00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:05.540]   everybody hates each other,
[00:50:05.540 --> 00:50:07.340]   and it feels that way in the world.
[00:50:07.340 --> 00:50:10.500]   So music really, that's why live music
[00:50:10.500 --> 00:50:11.580]   is so important to people.
[00:50:11.580 --> 00:50:13.860]   That's why music is so important to people,
[00:50:13.860 --> 00:50:15.540]   'cause even if it's just you and that person
[00:50:15.540 --> 00:50:16.980]   that wrote the song, you're listening to it,
[00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:18.740]   and the two of you feel connected,
[00:50:18.740 --> 00:50:23.820]   it's like you're hearing Tracy Chapman sing
[00:50:23.820 --> 00:50:25.740]   Fast Car or something, you're just like,
[00:50:25.740 --> 00:50:27.900]   oh my gosh, yes, I get it,
[00:50:27.900 --> 00:50:29.620]   and you feel connected to that person,
[00:50:29.620 --> 00:50:31.380]   you don't feel alone.
[00:50:31.380 --> 00:50:33.100]   So that's the high of it, for sure.
[00:50:33.100 --> 00:50:34.900]   And then you get off stage, and then,
[00:50:36.700 --> 00:50:39.340]   like my uncle's a heart surgeon,
[00:50:39.340 --> 00:50:42.980]   incredible heart surgeon who writes the book.
[00:50:42.980 --> 00:50:45.260]   He's the guy that the heart surgeons talk to.
[00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:46.380]   He's out of Nashville, Tennessee,
[00:50:46.380 --> 00:50:48.660]   he's just an incredible genius man.
[00:50:48.660 --> 00:50:53.660]   He always worries and always reached out to me.
[00:50:53.660 --> 00:50:55.860]   He's like, musicians die all the time,
[00:50:55.860 --> 00:50:58.140]   and the reason they die, you know,
[00:50:58.140 --> 00:50:59.300]   is because you're getting on stage
[00:50:59.300 --> 00:51:00.140]   and your heart's doing this,
[00:51:00.140 --> 00:51:01.340]   and your cortisone levels are doing this,
[00:51:01.340 --> 00:51:03.700]   you're getting off stage and then you're just doing this.
[00:51:03.700 --> 00:51:05.460]   And it's a really real thing.
[00:51:05.460 --> 00:51:07.620]   You get off stage and you feel like you need drugs,
[00:51:07.620 --> 00:51:11.260]   'cause you're like, the world feels like,
[00:51:11.260 --> 00:51:12.980]   oh, incredibly daunting.
[00:51:12.980 --> 00:51:15.300]   And it's also, I'm sure, has to do with
[00:51:15.300 --> 00:51:18.700]   some health things in your heart and the cortisone levels
[00:51:18.700 --> 00:51:20.700]   that are so crazy, and then you come off,
[00:51:20.700 --> 00:51:23.780]   and it's like, I know people are like,
[00:51:23.780 --> 00:51:26.060]   well then nothing's enough except meth.
[00:51:26.060 --> 00:51:27.140]   (laughing)
[00:51:27.140 --> 00:51:28.980]   Nothing's enough except heroin.
[00:51:28.980 --> 00:51:30.660]   And that's why a lot of artists turn to that stuff.
[00:51:30.660 --> 00:51:33.460]   And I don't say it in a preachy way,
[00:51:33.460 --> 00:51:36.300]   but I've struggled with drug abuse in my life.
[00:51:36.300 --> 00:51:41.300]   And I really, I understand why artists turn to it.
[00:51:41.300 --> 00:51:46.540]   - But also the fact that you're an introvert.
[00:51:46.540 --> 00:51:49.540]   So the other side of it, the fame.
[00:51:49.540 --> 00:51:51.780]   That's something that you also said
[00:51:51.780 --> 00:51:53.540]   is a double-edged sword for you.
[00:51:53.540 --> 00:51:55.980]   The interesting thing about fame,
[00:51:55.980 --> 00:51:57.100]   is that you also mentioned,
[00:51:57.100 --> 00:51:59.680]   is it something you can't take back.
[00:51:59.680 --> 00:52:00.520]   - Yeah.
[00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:04.600]   - It's the thing, you can't just go on vacation to Hawaii
[00:52:04.600 --> 00:52:06.280]   and just consider, do I like it or not?
[00:52:06.280 --> 00:52:08.600]   No, you're staying in Hawaii for the rest of your life,
[00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:10.840]   and you've never been there before,
[00:52:10.840 --> 00:52:12.600]   whether you like it or not.
[00:52:12.600 --> 00:52:17.600]   So what's that like being loved
[00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:20.620]   by millions and millions and millions of people,
[00:52:20.620 --> 00:52:26.320]   which is perhaps the best kind of fame,
[00:52:26.320 --> 00:52:29.480]   in terms of you have to choose the kinds of fames there are.
[00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:32.720]   And still being an introvert and all that kind of stuff.
[00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:37.720]   So do you feel alone, more alone being famous?
[00:52:37.720 --> 00:52:41.520]   Is there a loneliness to it?
[00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:44.200]   - Yeah, I mean, it's such a funny thing,
[00:52:44.200 --> 00:52:45.520]   'cause for, okay, if you had asked,
[00:52:45.520 --> 00:52:47.360]   if we were having this conversation a couple years ago,
[00:52:47.360 --> 00:52:49.080]   I'd be incredibly guarded about this,
[00:52:49.080 --> 00:52:54.080]   because the last thing I wanna ever do
[00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:58.600]   is sound ungrateful or unaware of how much I have.
[00:52:58.600 --> 00:53:01.960]   And woe is the famous celebrity with money.
[00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:03.000]   Oh, is your life hard?
[00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:05.360]   Is it really, tell me about how hard it is.
[00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:06.600]   But I'm also at a place in life now
[00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:08.700]   where I just, I'm gonna always just speak my truth,
[00:53:08.700 --> 00:53:10.100]   because that's the only reason I'm here,
[00:53:10.100 --> 00:53:11.560]   is I'm here to speak my truth to you,
[00:53:11.560 --> 00:53:12.560]   so I'm gonna tell you my truth,
[00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:14.400]   whether it's, whatever it is.
[00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:17.480]   - Well, you're human, and feelings are real.
[00:53:17.480 --> 00:53:20.000]   And so, that's the interesting thing.
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:22.320]   You win a lottery, what's that gonna feel like?
[00:53:22.320 --> 00:53:24.320]   It's not about complaining, oh, it's so hard
[00:53:24.320 --> 00:53:25.920]   to win a lottery 'cause you get a lot of money.
[00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:27.920]   No, it's still, you're human,
[00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:29.560]   and you get to experience these feelings,
[00:53:29.560 --> 00:53:30.760]   and it's fascinating.
[00:53:30.760 --> 00:53:33.200]   You put humans in different situations,
[00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:35.680]   and it's also fascinating because a lot of people think,
[00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:38.060]   well, I would like to be famous.
[00:53:38.060 --> 00:53:39.800]   That's a big thing now on social media,
[00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:40.640]   on Instagram and so on.
[00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:42.120]   - The whole world wants to be famous.
[00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:44.360]   - Or rich or famous, and then it's very interesting
[00:53:44.360 --> 00:53:47.200]   to think, all right, well, once you arrive,
[00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:49.680]   are all the problems solved?
[00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:52.480]   - No, yeah, so I will tell you, according to me,
[00:53:52.480 --> 00:53:54.760]   what the pitfalls are, whether it's fear or not.
[00:53:54.760 --> 00:53:56.240]   And there are certainly some pitfalls.
[00:53:56.240 --> 00:53:58.920]   One, it's once you're there, you can't go back.
[00:53:58.920 --> 00:54:02.920]   Whatever, maybe that's fine 'cause maybe you love it.
[00:54:02.920 --> 00:54:07.920]   But the real pitfall for me is that you're now, you're Lex,
[00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:13.320]   and you're what everybody's perception is that Lex is,
[00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:15.240]   and that's what you are.
[00:54:15.240 --> 00:54:20.080]   Now, Lex is probably a lot more complex and complicated
[00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:25.080]   and has a lot more to Lex than the Lex that is the celebrity.
[00:54:25.480 --> 00:54:30.480]   So, but anybody who meets you, that's who you are to them.
[00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:36.400]   And you may not feel this way, but you may feel confined
[00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:39.280]   to actually have to be that person to that person.
[00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:41.800]   Like I've, early in my career, for a long time,
[00:54:41.800 --> 00:54:44.160]   anytime I met someone, I suddenly felt like I had
[00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:46.400]   to be Dan Reynolds from Imagine Dragons
[00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:48.800]   anytime I met someone, including my family now,
[00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:50.600]   who are also like, whoa, this is crazy.
[00:54:50.600 --> 00:54:52.920]   You're like Dan Reynolds from Imagine Dragons.
[00:54:52.920 --> 00:54:55.560]   And I wanted to just be the goofball
[00:54:55.560 --> 00:54:58.680]   that I have been my whole life with my brothers and family,
[00:54:58.680 --> 00:55:00.720]   but suddenly I found myself feeling like,
[00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:05.240]   no, I have to be this, 'cause that's who this is.
[00:55:05.240 --> 00:55:06.720]   So you're almost like playing a role.
[00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:08.760]   And it's like, I've heard a lot of actors talk about this
[00:55:08.760 --> 00:55:10.320]   where they'll take on a role, and then it's like,
[00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:12.440]   they feel like they have to, they become that.
[00:55:12.440 --> 00:55:14.680]   And it's a really scary thing.
[00:55:14.680 --> 00:55:18.800]   You alter who you are almost to fit the notion
[00:55:18.800 --> 00:55:22.500]   of other people, 'cause especially if a lot of artists
[00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:26.360]   are empaths, a lot of people who get into art
[00:55:26.360 --> 00:55:29.000]   in a deep way are empaths, and so you feel a lot
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:32.320]   of what people are feeling, and you're never wanting
[00:55:32.320 --> 00:55:34.160]   to burden people, and you're always wanting
[00:55:34.160 --> 00:55:37.480]   to deliver to that person what they want.
[00:55:37.480 --> 00:55:39.240]   It's like people-pleasing.
[00:55:39.240 --> 00:55:42.960]   It goes hand-in-hand with a lot of these famous people,
[00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:44.200]   and they get to where they were
[00:55:44.200 --> 00:55:45.880]   because they know how to do that.
[00:55:45.880 --> 00:55:47.080]   They know how to be in a room with someone
[00:55:47.080 --> 00:55:49.220]   and look 'em in the eye and make them feel
[00:55:49.220 --> 00:55:51.120]   like they're the only person in the room.
[00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:52.980]   And then now they got that role in that movie
[00:55:52.980 --> 00:55:54.760]   because they sat with the casting director,
[00:55:54.760 --> 00:55:57.860]   and they were like, oh, you're so funny.
[00:55:57.860 --> 00:55:59.960]   Anybody put on the charisma, do it all.
[00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:03.960]   And it's like, anyway, I'm going on a different tangent here,
[00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:07.200]   but long story short, there's a lot of things
[00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:08.760]   that are really unhealthy about it.
[00:56:08.760 --> 00:56:11.280]   And then a lot of people who want the fame,
[00:56:11.280 --> 00:56:12.800]   then the second it starts to go away,
[00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:15.360]   then they're like, who am I anymore?
[00:56:15.360 --> 00:56:17.440]   That was everything, now I'm on the down,
[00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:19.320]   now I'm not a famous person anymore,
[00:56:19.320 --> 00:56:21.760]   and now I hate myself, now I'm gonna do drugs.
[00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:24.280]   And it's like this vicious cycle.
[00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:25.840]   You can never be famous enough.
[00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:29.040]   You're always gonna get, there's just so much to it
[00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:33.240]   that I've just, and again, I've lost friends
[00:56:33.240 --> 00:56:35.920]   in this career to that, for sure.
[00:56:35.920 --> 00:56:38.280]   - And there's a certain element to,
[00:56:38.280 --> 00:56:40.920]   sort of just on the losing fame.
[00:56:40.920 --> 00:56:43.000]   I've interacted with a lot of folks,
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:46.920]   especially young folks, like on YouTube.
[00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:51.000]   Fame is a thing that has levels.
[00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:52.840]   You're always trying to be a little more famous.
[00:56:52.840 --> 00:56:54.320]   A lot of folks who are chasing fame,
[00:56:54.320 --> 00:56:55.160]   it doesn't matter how famous you are,
[00:56:55.160 --> 00:56:56.680]   you're always trying to chase more.
[00:56:56.680 --> 00:56:58.440]   And when you start to lose it,
[00:56:58.440 --> 00:57:01.080]   interesting things can happen if you're not self-aware,
[00:57:01.080 --> 00:57:03.920]   which is like, like you mentioned,
[00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:08.840]   you might be trying to grasp back at where you were
[00:57:08.840 --> 00:57:11.440]   by leaning into the formula that got you there.
[00:57:11.440 --> 00:57:15.600]   And so the constraints of the image that you mentioned
[00:57:15.600 --> 00:57:19.440]   becomes the thing that you're now trying to lean into.
[00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:22.760]   And that's actually walking away from who you really are.
[00:57:22.760 --> 00:57:25.840]   You lean further into being that person.
[00:57:25.840 --> 00:57:28.720]   That's true for acting, that's true for,
[00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:31.680]   even on YouTube, which is people acting,
[00:57:31.680 --> 00:57:34.560]   they have a role, they got them to the table somehow.
[00:57:34.560 --> 00:57:37.680]   Yeah, it's dark, but I think those are,
[00:57:37.680 --> 00:57:43.120]   that's just put for everybody to see,
[00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:45.400]   but that's a very human struggle,
[00:57:45.400 --> 00:57:47.080]   even when you're not famous,
[00:57:47.080 --> 00:57:49.320]   of finding yourself, of being yourself,
[00:57:49.320 --> 00:57:54.320]   of not letting, not doing the people pleasing at any scale
[00:57:54.320 --> 00:57:56.280]   and being trapped by that.
[00:57:56.280 --> 00:57:58.940]   - Yeah, and also feeling like it's never enough.
[00:57:58.940 --> 00:58:00.400]   I think that's something all,
[00:58:00.400 --> 00:58:04.960]   it's not just a famous thing, but it's like,
[00:58:04.960 --> 00:58:06.400]   everybody deals with feeling like,
[00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:08.680]   when I'm here, I'll be happy.
[00:58:08.680 --> 00:58:10.120]   When I get that job, I'll be happy.
[00:58:10.120 --> 00:58:12.800]   When I have that money, then I'll be happy.
[00:58:12.800 --> 00:58:16.080]   When I get that surgery and my nose looks like this,
[00:58:16.080 --> 00:58:17.300]   I will be happy then.
[00:58:17.300 --> 00:58:21.280]   It's like a constant chase of happiness
[00:58:21.280 --> 00:58:25.360]   instead of happiness.
[00:58:25.360 --> 00:58:27.720]   It's like the opposite, it's opposite of self-love,
[00:58:27.720 --> 00:58:29.560]   it's the opposite of happiness.
[00:58:29.560 --> 00:58:32.000]   There's no presence to it.
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:34.280]   You're constant, you're never going to find it.
[00:58:34.280 --> 00:58:36.000]   You're never gonna arrive,
[00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:37.280]   and you're just gonna live your life,
[00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:39.120]   and then you're gonna be on your deathbed and be like,
[00:58:39.120 --> 00:58:42.500]   I was chasing the wrong thing my whole life.
[00:58:42.500 --> 00:58:46.320]   - I should say that podcasts are interesting in that way.
[00:58:46.320 --> 00:58:49.320]   So for me personally, because you just talk a lot,
[00:58:49.320 --> 00:58:52.760]   you can't, people that meet you, they know you,
[00:58:52.760 --> 00:58:54.960]   and they know the evolution of you.
[00:58:54.960 --> 00:58:58.800]   And that's the same thing for you right now,
[00:58:58.800 --> 00:59:00.280]   Dan of Imagine Dragons.
[00:59:00.280 --> 00:59:03.520]   Just being on a podcast, long form,
[00:59:03.520 --> 00:59:07.840]   reveals a side that liberates you more,
[00:59:07.840 --> 00:59:11.500]   to be yourself, to, like, people see, oh, there's a human.
[00:59:11.500 --> 00:59:14.280]   'Cause they, you know, music,
[00:59:14.280 --> 00:59:15.840]   they have a deep connection with you,
[00:59:15.840 --> 00:59:20.040]   they have experiences with you the way they experienced it,
[00:59:20.040 --> 00:59:22.800]   and that's who you are with them through the songs.
[00:59:22.800 --> 00:59:26.080]   But now you get to see, oh, there's a human being.
[00:59:26.080 --> 00:59:29.400]   He probably gets angry, he gets sad, he gets excited,
[00:59:29.400 --> 00:59:32.240]   he's hopeful, you know, and there's a core,
[00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:33.240]   there's a good human being,
[00:59:33.240 --> 00:59:36.200]   but the whole rollercoaster of emotions all there,
[00:59:36.200 --> 00:59:37.560]   it's a giant, beautiful mess,
[00:59:37.560 --> 00:59:38.920]   and podcasts reveal that.
[00:59:38.920 --> 00:59:41.240]   That's why I love podcasts, like, long form.
[00:59:41.240 --> 00:59:45.000]   You get to hear some artists and actors and so on,
[00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:47.060]   and some of them, you get to see,
[00:59:47.060 --> 00:59:52.060]   oh, you've lost yourself in the surface.
[00:59:52.060 --> 00:59:57.180]   That's a tragedy with some actors, some great actors.
[00:59:57.180 --> 01:00:00.520]   They've left so much of themselves
[01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:02.520]   in the roles they've played,
[01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:07.040]   that they can no longer be the thing they were before,
[01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:08.400]   those great roles.
[01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:10.000]   - That's for sure.
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.760]   - It's hard to see.
[01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:13.240]   So you get to see that with Johnny Depp,
[01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:14.280]   with, I don't know, Pirates.
[01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:16.640]   He was talking about that with Pirates of the Caribbean.
[01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:18.480]   That was a shift.
[01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:19.320]   - Right.
[01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:20.140]   - Like, he's not that guy.
[01:00:20.140 --> 01:00:20.980]   - Right.
[01:00:20.980 --> 01:00:24.200]   - He's forever, forever that guy.
[01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:27.440]   But the point is to remember that you're not,
[01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:28.840]   and to your family, which is interesting,
[01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:30.320]   you said with your family.
[01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:31.600]   When I see people close to me,
[01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:34.840]   they also, there is an element like that,
[01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:37.400]   while you're that, they start treating you
[01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:38.840]   like the famous person.
[01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:42.880]   - Yeah, I'm fortunate to have my manager,
[01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:45.680]   who's my brother, my older brother,
[01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:47.820]   and my lawyer is my other older brother.
[01:00:47.820 --> 01:00:51.640]   And that's been helpful because,
[01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:55.400]   it's weird, it gets weird with everyone, no matter what.
[01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:59.440]   One of the best advice I was given was by Charlie Sheen.
[01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:00.600]   - You got advice from Charlie Sheen?
[01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:02.160]   - Yeah, we were playing--
[01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:04.160]   - The wise sage of our generation.
[01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:07.040]   - The wise sage, Charlie Sheen, but it was,
[01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:08.000]   it was really wise.
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.080]   I was sitting next to him,
[01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:12.280]   and we were playing some late night television,
[01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:14.120]   and he said, this was right at the beginning,
[01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:17.800]   and he just said, "Boys, just mark my words,
[01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:20.500]   "your life is about to get really weird."
[01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:21.340]   That's all he said.
[01:01:21.340 --> 01:01:22.180]   But it stuck with me forever,
[01:01:22.180 --> 01:01:25.040]   and it's Charlie Sheen, so of course it sticks with you.
[01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:27.280]   And I remember being like, right, okay, Charlie Sheen,
[01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:29.640]   I'm not Charlie Sheen, it's not gonna get weird.
[01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:34.480]   But it got really, really weird, really quick,
[01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:37.680]   because suddenly, you've existed your whole life
[01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:39.960]   in this way where everybody just,
[01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:42.480]   everything you get, you achieved,
[01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:44.560]   it was because you got it.
[01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:47.240]   And every conversation you had,
[01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:49.680]   if someone liked you at the end of that conversation,
[01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:51.120]   well, it's 'cause they liked you.
[01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:53.600]   If they didn't like you, it's 'cause they didn't like you.
[01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:55.320]   And you can make complete peace with that.
[01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:56.540]   At least I could my whole life.
[01:01:56.540 --> 01:01:58.640]   I was like, life is a challenge,
[01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:01.920]   and be myself, and I'm gonna go through it,
[01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:04.280]   and find some people along the way that I connect with,
[01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:05.200]   and others, no.
[01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:10.200]   And that social integrity is so important to us.
[01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:13.880]   And we think it would be nice to have this,
[01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:16.260]   and this is going back to the pitfalls of fame.
[01:02:16.260 --> 01:02:18.940]   We think it would be nice to walk into a room
[01:02:18.940 --> 01:02:20.360]   and have everyone be like,
[01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:24.960]   and you could be like, "Dumpster fire."
[01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:26.760]   And everybody's like, "Oh my gosh, dumpster fire,
[01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:30.360]   "that was amazing, you said dumpster fire was amazing."
[01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:34.920]   It's like, it's incredibly, incredibly lonely.
[01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:39.000]   And it just breaks everything that you knew about humanness.
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:39.840]   And it sucks.
[01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:42.800]   So then you're seeking out people who,
[01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:44.200]   that it doesn't exist with.
[01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:46.120]   And families, the closest you can get to that, for sure.
[01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:47.760]   But even your family, it's gonna take a little bit
[01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:49.280]   where they're like, "Oh, this is a little weird.
[01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:51.760]   "All my friends at work are now asking about you,
[01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:53.120]   "and you're my young, stupid brother."
[01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:55.200]   But now you're suddenly the young, stupid brother
[01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:56.640]   that they want an autograph from and stuff.
[01:02:56.640 --> 01:02:59.200]   And it still makes, they have to get over that
[01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:00.240]   and figure that out.
[01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:04.280]   And then you meet people too
[01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:05.880]   who know about this whole concept,
[01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:08.080]   and they're like, "Well, I'm gonna be an asshole to him
[01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:11.720]   "to show him that I don't subscribe."
[01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:13.940]   And you're dealing with people who are like,
[01:03:13.940 --> 01:03:15.880]   "Dumpster fire," the person who's like,
[01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:19.440]   you could say something actually profound and nice,
[01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:22.640]   and they'd be like, "That's stupid, and you're an idiot."
[01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:25.640]   'Cause it's an actual attempt to show you
[01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:27.240]   how much they don't care.
[01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:29.560]   So you live in this very like--
[01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:32.160]   - And still, nevertheless, even when nobody knew you,
[01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:35.040]   you were seeking for deep human connection
[01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:36.960]   with a small number of people.
[01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:39.160]   And now, when a lot of people know you,
[01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:41.160]   you're still looking for deep connection
[01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:43.240]   with a small number of people.
[01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:44.980]   The struggle is the same.
[01:03:44.980 --> 01:03:48.040]   Can you speak to, 'cause you mentioned
[01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:50.800]   some of the dark moments, what advice would you give
[01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:53.600]   to people who are struggling with depression?
[01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:55.840]   And maybe for the people who love
[01:03:55.840 --> 01:03:59.340]   the people who are struggling with depression.
[01:03:59.340 --> 01:04:03.580]   - So what I have found to be most successful for me,
[01:04:03.580 --> 01:04:09.160]   it's back to the basics of everything
[01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:12.280]   that the therapist or psychologist will tell you,
[01:04:12.280 --> 01:04:13.760]   psychiatrist will tell you right when you meet them,
[01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:17.420]   which is exercise every day,
[01:04:17.420 --> 01:04:22.480]   eat healthy for sure,
[01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:24.760]   find time, make time every day to do something
[01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:27.820]   that you love, whatever that may be,
[01:04:27.820 --> 01:04:29.200]   whatever brings you joy.
[01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:32.560]   And when you're really depressed,
[01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:34.440]   that actually feels like nothing.
[01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:36.400]   'Cause the things that brought you joy
[01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:37.740]   don't bring you joy anymore,
[01:04:37.740 --> 01:04:39.920]   when I'm really in the thick of it.
[01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:44.880]   But for me, this is the cycle that I'll go through
[01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:46.320]   is I'll look at my life and I'll say,
[01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:48.400]   okay, what can I clean up?
[01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:51.960]   All right, well, for me, it was cutting out alcohol
[01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:53.200]   actually helped me a lot.
[01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:56.240]   I know that sounds like a big,
[01:04:56.240 --> 01:04:59.240]   I'm not judging anybody for that.
[01:04:59.240 --> 01:05:01.060]   And I still drink on occasion,
[01:05:01.060 --> 01:05:03.840]   but I have felt like alcohol has been very unhelpful
[01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:05.140]   to my mental state.
[01:05:05.140 --> 01:05:09.320]   Feel less drive and less happiness the next day
[01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:10.340]   for things that I wanna do.
[01:05:10.340 --> 01:05:12.760]   I feel like it plays a lot with your serotonin.
[01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:14.680]   - So look for stuff to change.
[01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:16.600]   - Clean living, yeah, clean living.
[01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:21.600]   But also understanding that sometimes it just is.
[01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:24.040]   And you just keep breathing.
[01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:26.000]   And it will get better with time.
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:27.120]   - This too shall pass.
[01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:27.960]   - This too shall pass.
[01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:31.120]   Like I really think that in the winter,
[01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:33.760]   I'm pretty sure, I mean, I've had a lot of,
[01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:34.720]   I've seen a lot of therapists
[01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:35.800]   and all of them say the same thing,
[01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:37.820]   which is like, you have major depressive disorder
[01:05:37.820 --> 01:05:38.660]   and this is what it is.
[01:05:38.660 --> 01:05:41.360]   But it's certainly worse for me in the winter months.
[01:05:41.360 --> 01:05:44.780]   So I know there's like, I can't think of the term for it,
[01:05:44.780 --> 01:05:47.120]   but there's a term for like seasonal depression,
[01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:47.960]   there it is.
[01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:51.040]   So I'll get to the winter and suddenly I'm like,
[01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:55.120]   geez, everything really sucks on a deeper level.
[01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:58.240]   And then, so it's like this too shall pass is another thing.
[01:05:58.240 --> 01:06:01.080]   It's like, just practice those things.
[01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:02.760]   Absolutely see a therapist.
[01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:06.640]   That's my biggest emphasis of life is to like on stage,
[01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:08.320]   like my goal, like I have a few things
[01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:09.480]   that I really, really care about.
[01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:13.640]   One is mental health and destigmatizing therapy.
[01:06:13.640 --> 01:06:15.640]   'Cause for me, I didn't go to therapy for a long time
[01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:18.680]   because I felt that it would be admitting that I was broken.
[01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:22.320]   It'd be admitting that I was weaker than Lex,
[01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:23.840]   who doesn't have to go to a therapist
[01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:25.460]   because Lex is stronger.
[01:06:25.460 --> 01:06:27.640]   So be strong like Lex.
[01:06:27.640 --> 01:06:29.360]   You know, I would like look at all my older brothers
[01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:30.560]   and I looked up to them so much
[01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:32.840]   and there were all these incredibly successful people.
[01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:35.920]   Plastic surgeon, an anesthesiologist, a dentist,
[01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:38.200]   two attorneys, Stanford, NYU,
[01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:41.680]   like just like incredible high standards,
[01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:45.380]   Eagle Scouts, you know, like they, valedictorians,
[01:06:45.380 --> 01:06:47.360]   like they just did it all.
[01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:52.360]   So for me, I was very, really did not want to admit,
[01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:55.320]   and none of them went to therapy.
[01:06:55.320 --> 01:06:56.640]   So it was like, what are you gonna be?
[01:06:56.640 --> 01:06:57.960]   Are you, are you broken?
[01:06:57.960 --> 01:07:01.140]   Are you like the weak one who can't hack life?
[01:07:01.140 --> 01:07:03.560]   And I think that's incredibly dangerous.
[01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:05.560]   And I feel like it almost cost me my life
[01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:08.600]   because I took so long to finally go to therapy.
[01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:11.240]   So I really want kids to know, hey,
[01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:14.440]   like the great people that achieve great things
[01:07:14.440 --> 01:07:16.120]   that are doing amazing things,
[01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:18.720]   they probably have help, almost all of them.
[01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:21.320]   - It's like going to the gym, but it's a mental gym.
[01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:23.440]   What, so I, unfortunately,
[01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:26.040]   I wanted to be a psychiatrist when I was growing up.
[01:07:26.040 --> 01:07:29.040]   Maybe that's why I like podcasts.
[01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:30.600]   Maybe that's-- - I think you'd be a good one.
[01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:32.280]   - Maybe, I would--
[01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:35.360]   - I think you are a psychiatrist, pretty much, right?
[01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:36.200]   Sounds like you're a psychiatrist.
[01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:38.200]   - I think I need more, I think,
[01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:41.200]   I think actually to be a good psychiatrist,
[01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:44.480]   you also need to be seeking therapy from the,
[01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:46.560]   like you also need to be,
[01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:50.040]   have some stuff to work through in your mind.
[01:07:50.040 --> 01:07:53.900]   I think, yeah, you have to have gone to some dark places.
[01:07:53.900 --> 01:07:57.160]   - The empathize.
[01:07:57.160 --> 01:07:59.240]   - The empathy, it's this ability to empathize,
[01:07:59.240 --> 01:08:02.200]   and especially if you've directly experienced it,
[01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:05.120]   you can go to those places in your mind.
[01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:06.760]   Like you said, it's with the music.
[01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:08.600]   To be authentic, you have to really go there.
[01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:12.720]   What, why did therapy help so much?
[01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:14.640]   What is the process of therapy,
[01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:16.840]   if you can just educate a little more?
[01:08:16.840 --> 01:08:20.740]   Is it, are you basically bringing to the surface
[01:08:20.740 --> 01:08:24.540]   and talking through things that you,
[01:08:24.540 --> 01:08:27.800]   because of the momentum of life,
[01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:31.280]   you just never allow yourself to speak through,
[01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:32.480]   to think through?
[01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:33.720]   Is that what therapy is?
[01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:36.320]   Or is it just a more systematic thing?
[01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:38.800]   - So I've been to a lot of strange,
[01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:39.880]   different kinds of therapy.
[01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:41.760]   So I'll tell you, my first therapist--
[01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:45.520]   - If I could interrupt, how hard is it to find
[01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:47.800]   a therapist that connected with you?
[01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:50.920]   - It is, it's actually pretty hard, I think.
[01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:54.060]   I think it, for, well, actually,
[01:08:54.060 --> 01:08:55.120]   I have a skewed view of that,
[01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:59.480]   because going back to the beginning of my therapy
[01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:02.000]   was with a Mormon therapist.
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.360]   So it was very much like, well,
[01:09:04.360 --> 01:09:05.920]   are you reading your Book of Mormon?
[01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:07.480]   And are you praying at night?
[01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:08.320]   You know what I mean?
[01:09:08.320 --> 01:09:10.120]   Like that was a big focus of my therapy
[01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:11.560]   to begin with. - And you're having--
[01:09:11.560 --> 01:09:12.400]   - Yeah.
[01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:13.760]   - A faith crisis in the distance.
[01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:17.080]   - Yes, I was like, well, and then--
[01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:18.120]   - You're making it worse.
[01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:20.680]   - Yes, the next therapist I went to
[01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:25.320]   was a Scientology therapist.
[01:09:25.320 --> 01:09:28.140]   I met my wife, and she was Scientologist at the time,
[01:09:28.140 --> 01:09:29.640]   and she's not anymore.
[01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:33.920]   She's like, it's such a funny thing to look back on,
[01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:36.960]   because we met, and I was like this Mormon missionary
[01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:38.240]   who had just got home from his mission,
[01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:40.160]   and I met her, and she's a Scientologist.
[01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:42.120]   I was like, wow, that's batshit crazy.
[01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:43.880]   Like that stuff's crazy.
[01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:44.800]   And she's like, what are you talking about?
[01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:45.800]   That's your crazy.
[01:09:45.800 --> 01:09:46.640]   (laughing)
[01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:47.460]   You're a Mormon.
[01:09:47.460 --> 01:09:48.760]   That's batshit crazy.
[01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:51.760]   And the two of us were like, huh,
[01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:54.320]   maybe there's something to this, to both of us here.
[01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:56.480]   - Yeah, the tension actually forces you to think through
[01:09:56.480 --> 01:09:58.280]   like, oh, well, what is true?
[01:09:58.280 --> 01:09:59.120]   What is true? - Yeah, yeah.
[01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:01.560]   And we really fell in love through that,
[01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:05.240]   which was like maybe we're both on the wrong track.
[01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:06.240]   Let's figure this out.
[01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:07.560]   But before that happened,
[01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:12.320]   we went to a Scientologist therapist
[01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:14.640]   who that therapy consisted of,
[01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:17.800]   what have you done wrong to Asia?
[01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:19.280]   And they would ask me that question
[01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:20.920]   over and over and over and over.
[01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:23.480]   And so I'm like thinking of the deepest, darkest things
[01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:25.680]   that were in the recesses of my mind.
[01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:28.320]   This was marriage therapy.
[01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:30.240]   Anyway, I'm not gonna get into that,
[01:10:30.240 --> 01:10:32.400]   but it was Scientology therapy,
[01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:33.520]   so that was a different thing.
[01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:36.660]   And then I went to therapy therapy.
[01:10:36.660 --> 01:10:39.040]   Like, no, it's not attached to any religion.
[01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:40.960]   And that was a really great experience for me.
[01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:41.800]   And since then,
[01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:43.100]   I've been through a couple different therapists,
[01:10:43.100 --> 01:10:45.680]   but that was more because where I was
[01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:47.680]   and moving and things like that.
[01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:50.120]   So is it that hard to find a great therapist?
[01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:51.800]   Probably not, but maybe don't go
[01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:53.200]   to your Mormon therapist person,
[01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:55.440]   that's Scientology therapist.
[01:10:55.440 --> 01:10:57.760]   Or maybe that's the route for you.
[01:10:57.760 --> 01:10:59.080]   Maybe it's the route for you, I don't know.
[01:10:59.080 --> 01:11:00.320]   - Yeah, but what is,
[01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:02.600]   so is it bringing stuff to the surface basically?
[01:11:02.600 --> 01:11:04.400]   - Oh, yeah, so I didn't even answer your question.
[01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:05.320]   - What's the effect?
[01:11:05.320 --> 01:11:06.620]   Why is it so effective?
[01:11:06.620 --> 01:11:10.220]   Is there something you could put words to?
[01:11:10.220 --> 01:11:11.300]   - Yeah, I mean, I think it's,
[01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:13.180]   obviously there's the common things you would think of,
[01:11:13.180 --> 01:11:15.100]   which is like, oh, I've been holding these things in
[01:11:15.100 --> 01:11:16.140]   that I don't wanna tell anybody,
[01:11:16.140 --> 01:11:17.260]   and then I tell this person,
[01:11:17.260 --> 01:11:19.220]   and oh, there's relief in that.
[01:11:19.220 --> 01:11:21.460]   But that's really not where the real work comes from.
[01:11:21.460 --> 01:11:24.580]   I think the real work is meeting with someone
[01:11:24.580 --> 01:11:29.020]   who is well-versed and educated and understands.
[01:11:29.020 --> 01:11:30.720]   It's like coding.
[01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:31.560]   It really is.
[01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:33.500]   It's like someone who, they listen to you,
[01:11:33.500 --> 01:11:34.780]   and they're like, well, that was a trigger,
[01:11:34.780 --> 01:11:36.240]   and then this became this trigger.
[01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:38.280]   And you're probably, every time you're hearing that,
[01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:41.340]   thinking of this thing that happened earlier in your life,
[01:11:41.340 --> 01:11:43.120]   and they just will walk you through scenarios.
[01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:44.520]   And maybe some of them aren't right,
[01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:45.640]   but some of them you'll be like,
[01:11:45.640 --> 01:11:46.520]   it'll resonate sometimes.
[01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:50.080]   You're like, wow, I am feeling that because of that,
[01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:51.360]   and that did happen.
[01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:53.360]   And maybe if I call my mom and say this to her,
[01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:54.520]   it will make me feel better.
[01:11:54.520 --> 01:11:55.720]   Hey, Mom, this happened.
[01:11:55.720 --> 01:11:56.560]   It's like work.
[01:11:56.560 --> 01:11:59.080]   You put in work, and you have hard conversations
[01:11:59.080 --> 01:12:00.600]   and do difficult things.
[01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:03.440]   And so if your therapy's not difficult,
[01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:05.580]   I actually think that's not good therapy.
[01:12:05.580 --> 01:12:08.300]   Good therapy is, it's gonna be a little difficult.
[01:12:08.300 --> 01:12:09.140]   It's work.
[01:12:09.140 --> 01:12:11.580]   - During and after.
[01:12:11.580 --> 01:12:15.360]   - Yes, I had this incredible therapist who,
[01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:16.820]   I told him when I was gonna do ayahuasca,
[01:12:16.820 --> 01:12:20.300]   he was like, geez, he actually was a doctor before
[01:12:20.300 --> 01:12:22.520]   and a really well-educated, studied person
[01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:26.540]   who had walked away from a brain doctor.
[01:12:26.540 --> 01:12:27.660]   What's the word for that?
[01:12:27.660 --> 01:12:28.500]   Brain doctor.
[01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:29.320]   - Brain surgeon?
[01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:30.160]   - Neurologist.
[01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:31.000]   - Oh, yeah, neurologist, yep.
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:35.440]   And he said, well, basically, his belief was that
[01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:39.740]   ayahuasca was like basically doing therapy 50 sessions.
[01:12:39.740 --> 01:12:41.980]   He was like, it's really intensive.
[01:12:41.980 --> 01:12:44.300]   He was like, I don't know if you wanna do that.
[01:12:44.300 --> 01:12:47.540]   If you do, you can make some big steps forward,
[01:12:47.540 --> 01:12:50.980]   but I prefer just to do one session at a time.
[01:12:50.980 --> 01:12:53.900]   And so yeah, it's hard work.
[01:12:53.900 --> 01:12:56.980]   And I typically, it's really hard for me
[01:12:56.980 --> 01:12:58.300]   to even talk about ayahuasca, by the way,
[01:12:58.300 --> 01:12:59.820]   going back to that, because I'm not looking
[01:12:59.820 --> 01:13:01.820]   to tell everybody to go do ayahuasca.
[01:13:01.820 --> 01:13:03.780]   It's incredibly hard.
[01:13:03.780 --> 01:13:07.100]   It was the scariest experience of my entire life.
[01:13:07.100 --> 01:13:08.540]   It felt like I went to heaven,
[01:13:08.540 --> 01:13:10.620]   but it also felt like I went to the darkest,
[01:13:10.620 --> 01:13:14.100]   deepest hell that was incredibly scary.
[01:13:14.100 --> 01:13:17.780]   Incredibly scary, yeah.
[01:13:17.780 --> 01:13:22.220]   - He told the story of how you wrote the song "Believer,"
[01:13:22.220 --> 01:13:27.220]   or like your childhood friend, I guess,
[01:13:27.220 --> 01:13:30.360]   Donald, like bullying and that kind of stuff.
[01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:34.060]   This song, I mean, a lot of your songs
[01:13:34.060 --> 01:13:35.660]   are super interesting, sort of,
[01:13:35.660 --> 01:13:39.140]   just the percussion, super interesting,
[01:13:39.140 --> 01:13:41.860]   super interesting lyrically, just how it flows.
[01:13:41.860 --> 01:13:45.540]   And also, pain is at the center of it.
[01:13:45.540 --> 01:13:49.200]   I mean, a lot of, like you said, the crisis of faith,
[01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:51.820]   some of these existential questions are basically
[01:13:51.820 --> 01:13:54.540]   behind a lot of your songs, funny enough.
[01:13:55.500 --> 01:13:59.420]   Maybe they're covered in metaphor, so it's hard to see,
[01:13:59.420 --> 01:14:01.180]   but it's there.
[01:14:01.180 --> 01:14:02.540]   And this song is really,
[01:14:02.540 --> 01:14:06.660]   it's really interesting in that way that it puts,
[01:14:06.660 --> 01:14:11.900]   pain, you made me a believer.
[01:14:11.900 --> 01:14:16.380]   You break me down, you build me up, believer.
[01:14:16.380 --> 01:14:17.520]   That's so interesting.
[01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:22.140]   Maybe can you tell the story of how the song came to be?
[01:14:22.140 --> 01:14:23.220]   I'd love to listen to it, too.
[01:14:23.220 --> 01:14:25.220]   I have some questions musically about it, too.
[01:14:25.220 --> 01:14:26.060]   - Yeah.
[01:14:26.060 --> 01:14:27.660]   Yeah, I mean,
[01:14:27.660 --> 01:14:30.900]   it's exactly what we're talking about with therapy.
[01:14:30.900 --> 01:14:34.860]   I just feel like the greatest things in my life
[01:14:34.860 --> 01:14:39.860]   have come from the deepest hurt.
[01:14:39.860 --> 01:14:45.580]   Like, losing someone that you love
[01:14:45.580 --> 01:14:49.420]   is maybe the hardest part of the human path for me,
[01:14:49.420 --> 01:14:51.300]   at least thus far.
[01:14:51.300 --> 01:14:52.860]   When I think of, okay, what was the hardest thing?
[01:14:52.860 --> 01:14:55.780]   There's like, you think of physical pain,
[01:14:55.780 --> 01:14:58.580]   or maybe going through financial pain, or whatever.
[01:14:58.580 --> 01:15:02.180]   I think losing someone that you really love to death
[01:15:02.180 --> 01:15:04.780]   is one of the hardest.
[01:15:04.780 --> 01:15:06.820]   For me, I would say it was the hardest.
[01:15:06.820 --> 01:15:10.100]   But it also makes you look at your life
[01:15:10.100 --> 01:15:13.180]   completely differently, and alter your life,
[01:15:13.180 --> 01:15:15.680]   at least for me, in ways that were really healthy.
[01:15:15.680 --> 01:15:19.340]   Being more present, letting go of things
[01:15:19.340 --> 01:15:21.220]   that were meaningless, trying to control
[01:15:21.220 --> 01:15:23.020]   what other people think about you.
[01:15:23.020 --> 01:15:25.340]   Wasting your time on things like that,
[01:15:25.340 --> 01:15:27.860]   and you suddenly see, wow, time.
[01:15:27.860 --> 01:15:30.300]   I got a small amount of time.
[01:15:30.300 --> 01:15:31.200]   How do I wanna spend it?
[01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:32.940]   I'm gonna spend it in the best way I know how,
[01:15:32.940 --> 01:15:34.180]   and that's it.
[01:15:34.180 --> 01:15:37.940]   So, yeah, it's a basic concept
[01:15:37.940 --> 01:15:39.140]   that's been said a million times over
[01:15:39.140 --> 01:15:39.980]   in a million different ways.
[01:15:39.980 --> 01:15:42.420]   But that's pretty much what I was trying to say
[01:15:42.420 --> 01:15:46.340]   with Believer, which is, I lost faith in everything
[01:15:46.340 --> 01:15:51.060]   at that time period, or previous to that time period,
[01:15:51.060 --> 01:15:53.220]   and then I was rebuilding my faith,
[01:15:53.220 --> 01:15:57.220]   or my spiritual thought process.
[01:15:57.220 --> 01:15:59.420]   And it was after ayahuasca, and it was like,
[01:15:59.420 --> 01:16:05.340]   finding, being a believer, and that's not necessarily
[01:16:05.340 --> 01:16:09.260]   like a believer in God, or a believer in heaven and hell,
[01:16:09.260 --> 01:16:12.900]   or anything like that, but a believer in more.
[01:16:12.900 --> 01:16:17.740]   Believing in goodness, believing that there is some light.
[01:16:18.580 --> 01:16:22.780]   And again, those words, they're just words,
[01:16:22.780 --> 01:16:24.060]   and I wish there were better words
[01:16:24.060 --> 01:16:25.940]   to formulate the thought that I'm trying to express,
[01:16:25.940 --> 01:16:27.780]   but just more.
[01:16:27.780 --> 01:16:33.900]   The thought of me dying, for me, I don't fear it.
[01:16:33.900 --> 01:16:40.060]   I don't fear it, but actually,
[01:16:40.060 --> 01:16:42.580]   I really fear not seeing my kids again.
[01:16:42.580 --> 01:16:43.400]   I'll say that.
[01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:44.860]   That is fearful for me.
[01:16:44.860 --> 01:16:48.100]   I feel like I love so deeply these children
[01:16:48.100 --> 01:16:51.500]   that the thought of leaving them, for me,
[01:16:51.500 --> 01:16:55.300]   is a scary thought, or something.
[01:16:55.300 --> 01:16:58.180]   - They're kind of a good reminder
[01:16:58.180 --> 01:16:59.980]   how much you love life, actually.
[01:16:59.980 --> 01:17:00.820]   - Yeah.
[01:17:00.820 --> 01:17:04.140]   - And you don't always remember that.
[01:17:04.140 --> 01:17:07.460]   - Yeah, and I think having kids is not for everyone,
[01:17:07.460 --> 01:17:08.380]   absolutely for sure.
[01:17:08.380 --> 01:17:11.420]   But for me, and especially, you shouldn't be having kids
[01:17:11.420 --> 01:17:13.060]   to give yourself a reason to live.
[01:17:13.060 --> 01:17:13.900]   (laughing)
[01:17:13.900 --> 01:17:16.980]   I mean, I feel like dying, I'm gonna have a kid.
[01:17:16.980 --> 01:17:19.140]   You might feel more like dying after having a kid,
[01:17:19.140 --> 01:17:20.540]   actually, you know?
[01:17:20.540 --> 01:17:22.100]   - It's pretty stressful.
[01:17:22.100 --> 01:17:23.900]   But it is a place to, like,
[01:17:23.900 --> 01:17:26.480]   I've changed a lot of people that I've known,
[01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:29.660]   that it gave them a new intensity
[01:17:29.660 --> 01:17:32.700]   of gratitude for life, for sure.
[01:17:32.700 --> 01:17:33.740]   Guy, do you mind if we,
[01:17:33.740 --> 01:17:36.180]   I'll return to the pain of the believer.
[01:17:36.180 --> 01:17:38.140]   Do you mind if we listen to a little bit of the songs?
[01:17:38.140 --> 01:17:39.480]   - No, it's fine.
[01:17:44.820 --> 01:17:47.380]   - Do you write the music first or the words first?
[01:17:47.380 --> 01:17:51.620]   - Uh, it's same time, which is very typical for me.
[01:17:51.620 --> 01:17:53.740]   - By the way, just the way it opens,
[01:17:53.740 --> 01:17:56.980]   like how, you know, intensity of openings.
[01:17:56.980 --> 01:17:57.940]   You ever think about, like,
[01:17:57.940 --> 01:18:00.100]   what the first few seconds sound like?
[01:18:00.100 --> 01:18:03.880]   Is that something that, like, when you imagine a song,
[01:18:03.880 --> 01:18:06.200]   is it the opening you imagine?
[01:18:06.200 --> 01:18:09.100]   - No, it's kind of a, it's just a,
[01:18:09.100 --> 01:18:12.100]   I never think opening, I never think final.
[01:18:12.100 --> 01:18:16.260]   I think soundscape of how I'm feeling right now.
[01:18:16.260 --> 01:18:18.380]   So it could be the middle of the song for all I know
[01:18:18.380 --> 01:18:20.340]   when I'm, you know, when I'm doing that.
[01:18:20.340 --> 01:18:23.940]   But my process for me is very much lyrics
[01:18:23.940 --> 01:18:27.540]   and melody and music really come at the same time.
[01:18:27.540 --> 01:18:30.020]   Like, by same time, I mean,
[01:18:30.020 --> 01:18:35.020]   I'm, as I'm expressing, maybe, you know,
[01:18:35.020 --> 01:18:35.860]   I'm feeling like.
[01:18:35.860 --> 01:18:38.280]   (beatboxing)
[01:18:38.280 --> 01:18:44.340]   Like, it's not that simple, but it's like,
[01:18:44.340 --> 01:18:47.540]   I'll hear it, like, it's like, here's all the orchestra
[01:18:47.540 --> 01:18:49.540]   and you're kind of just pressing all the buttons at once.
[01:18:49.540 --> 01:18:53.600]   And melody and my voice is just one of those instruments.
[01:18:53.600 --> 01:18:54.440]   You know what I mean?
[01:18:54.440 --> 01:18:56.020]   It's just utilizing one instrument.
[01:18:56.020 --> 01:18:57.220]   - So you've seen the landscape
[01:18:57.220 --> 01:18:58.620]   and that landscape includes melody,
[01:18:58.620 --> 01:19:02.220]   includes percussion, lyrics a little bit, or lyrics?
[01:19:02.220 --> 01:19:03.660]   - It would be words to begin with,
[01:19:03.660 --> 01:19:05.140]   like a word here and there.
[01:19:05.140 --> 01:19:05.980]   Like, I'll be like.
[01:19:05.980 --> 01:19:08.320]   (beatboxing)
[01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:12.820]   You know, I'm like, what's a word that I'm thinking of
[01:19:12.820 --> 01:19:14.780]   when I'm feeling this soundscape?
[01:19:14.780 --> 01:19:19.260]   And I always create with no theme in mind.
[01:19:19.260 --> 01:19:21.720]   I'm never, for better or for worse,
[01:19:21.720 --> 01:19:24.380]   just my process is I'm sitting down
[01:19:24.380 --> 01:19:26.580]   and I'm writing a journal entry.
[01:19:26.580 --> 01:19:27.400]   Simple as that.
[01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:29.480]   It's like, when you sit down to write a journal entry,
[01:19:29.480 --> 01:19:31.500]   are you sitting down and you're like,
[01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:32.900]   okay, I've had all these words here
[01:19:32.900 --> 01:19:33.980]   that I'm gonna put on the page
[01:19:33.980 --> 01:19:35.860]   and I'm gonna order it in this way.
[01:19:35.860 --> 01:19:38.300]   My theme for my journal entry today is gonna be this.
[01:19:38.300 --> 01:19:39.400]   Maybe some people do, but I don't.
[01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:42.100]   My journal entry is, I don't know what I'm gonna say.
[01:19:42.100 --> 01:19:43.060]   Oh, how was today?
[01:19:43.060 --> 01:19:45.540]   Well, man, today was this and feeling this.
[01:19:45.540 --> 01:19:47.680]   And now that I think about that, I'm really angry about that.
[01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:49.460]   That hurt my feelings when this happened.
[01:19:49.460 --> 01:19:51.940]   You're like, you're formulating it as you go
[01:19:51.940 --> 01:19:53.140]   and that's the joy of it.
[01:19:53.140 --> 01:19:55.380]   And for me, that's what music is.
[01:19:55.380 --> 01:19:57.860]   So I'll sit down, not thinking,
[01:19:57.860 --> 01:20:00.580]   hey, I've been wanting to write a song that has a hard beat,
[01:20:00.580 --> 01:20:02.260]   or I've been wanting to write a song that's anthemic,
[01:20:02.260 --> 01:20:03.860]   I've been wanting to write a song that's,
[01:20:03.860 --> 01:20:06.100]   it's like, how am I feeling right now?
[01:20:06.100 --> 01:20:09.140]   - And is joyful, is the feeling joyful to you
[01:20:09.140 --> 01:20:10.980]   or is it struggle?
[01:20:10.980 --> 01:20:14.460]   'Cause you just made it sound like it's joyful.
[01:20:14.460 --> 01:20:17.780]   Or at least fulfilling.
[01:20:17.780 --> 01:20:20.660]   - Yeah, fulfilling is the word I was kinda looking for.
[01:20:20.660 --> 01:20:22.980]   - 'Cause a lot of artists talk about really,
[01:20:22.980 --> 01:20:24.500]   like, talk about writers.
[01:20:24.500 --> 01:20:26.420]   - Cathartic, that's the word I was looking for.
[01:20:26.420 --> 01:20:30.420]   It feels like having a good moment with a therapist
[01:20:30.420 --> 01:20:34.520]   where you're like, okay, I'm expressing this thing
[01:20:34.520 --> 01:20:36.060]   that I just need to express.
[01:20:36.060 --> 01:20:38.940]   For whatever reason, I need to express this.
[01:20:38.940 --> 01:20:40.700]   The majority of the songs I write for the record
[01:20:40.700 --> 01:20:41.540]   are never heard.
[01:20:41.540 --> 01:20:43.780]   I write over 100 songs a year.
[01:20:43.780 --> 01:20:47.900]   I release 20 songs every three years.
[01:20:47.900 --> 01:20:49.780]   So I don't know, what's that percent?
[01:20:49.780 --> 01:20:51.100]   20 out of 300.
[01:20:51.100 --> 01:20:51.940]   Come on, Lex.
[01:20:51.940 --> 01:20:55.620]   It's less than 10%.
[01:20:55.620 --> 01:20:56.460]   - Less than 10%, yeah.
[01:20:56.460 --> 01:20:57.780]   - Like eight, seven or something?
[01:20:57.780 --> 01:20:58.620]   - Yeah.
[01:20:59.460 --> 01:21:01.100]   Anyway, so it's--
[01:21:01.100 --> 01:21:02.700]   - And then getting together with a band
[01:21:02.700 --> 01:21:04.740]   and getting them selected down
[01:21:04.740 --> 01:21:06.740]   is really what the process of.
[01:21:06.740 --> 01:21:11.740]   So you're really writing a song per one to three days,
[01:21:11.740 --> 01:21:16.380]   kinda maybe a song that you can't quite figure out
[01:21:16.380 --> 01:21:19.660]   the puzzle of that's gonna last a little longer.
[01:21:19.660 --> 01:21:22.100]   Where's the struggle? - I finish every idea.
[01:21:22.100 --> 01:21:23.940]   - Yeah, you finish every idea.
[01:21:23.940 --> 01:21:25.140]   - I do, I finish every idea.
[01:21:25.140 --> 01:21:28.100]   - So it's not just laying completely unfinished--
[01:21:28.100 --> 01:21:30.020]   - I could open my computer for you right now
[01:21:30.020 --> 01:21:33.300]   and I would show you hundreds and hundreds of songs
[01:21:33.300 --> 01:21:35.340]   that you would listen to and think,
[01:21:35.340 --> 01:21:36.460]   that sounds like a song.
[01:21:36.460 --> 01:21:38.380]   It's like there's rhythm, there's melody,
[01:21:38.380 --> 01:21:40.580]   there's multiple instruments, there's lyrics.
[01:21:40.580 --> 01:21:45.060]   It's the same thing as for coding for me,
[01:21:45.060 --> 01:21:47.700]   which is music, which is I can't walk away
[01:21:47.700 --> 01:21:48.540]   until I've completed it.
[01:21:48.540 --> 01:21:50.180]   - But it's finished.
[01:21:50.180 --> 01:21:51.500]   - Well, finished is--
[01:21:51.500 --> 01:21:52.900]   - Yeah, yeah, but it sounds like a song--
[01:21:52.900 --> 01:21:54.660]   - I certainly do a lot more with it
[01:21:54.660 --> 01:21:56.780]   after with the band where we pulled it apart.
[01:21:56.780 --> 01:21:59.660]   But it's a song, it'll be like, you know,
[01:21:59.660 --> 01:22:01.340]   you'll listen to it and say, okay, that was a song.
[01:22:01.340 --> 01:22:05.820]   I get, you understand what it is, for sure.
[01:22:05.820 --> 01:22:08.380]   - Do you think, this is a painful question
[01:22:08.380 --> 01:22:12.980]   from a fan perspective, do you think there's genius
[01:22:12.980 --> 01:22:17.020]   on your computer that you walked away from
[01:22:17.020 --> 01:22:19.580]   that you just didn't notice it?
[01:22:19.580 --> 01:22:22.060]   Like, do you think there's truly great songs
[01:22:22.060 --> 01:22:25.980]   that you've written that you just didn't notice
[01:22:25.980 --> 01:22:26.940]   how great they are?
[01:22:26.940 --> 01:22:31.300]   - I think greatness is something that I feel I'm,
[01:22:31.300 --> 01:22:35.220]   I don't feel like I've achieved greatness, genuine.
[01:22:35.220 --> 01:22:37.940]   I'm not saying that to you in a way of like humility.
[01:22:37.940 --> 01:22:39.700]   - It's like Michael Jordan time.
[01:22:39.700 --> 01:22:44.700]   - No, genuinely I feel like I am on a journey right now
[01:22:44.700 --> 01:22:46.300]   to find who I am.
[01:22:46.300 --> 01:22:48.980]   And I'm 34 and it's like, I don't even,
[01:22:48.980 --> 01:22:50.900]   I haven't begun that journey.
[01:22:50.900 --> 01:22:52.980]   I feel like I'm just starting that.
[01:22:52.980 --> 01:22:57.980]   But that being said, I certainly don't know
[01:22:57.980 --> 01:23:02.820]   the right answer to what songs are beloved
[01:23:02.820 --> 01:23:04.140]   or good to the masses.
[01:23:04.140 --> 01:23:06.620]   Like Imagine Dragons is such a massive entity.
[01:23:06.620 --> 01:23:09.500]   It's like, there have been, I will say this,
[01:23:09.500 --> 01:23:12.220]   there are a couple times where I fought really hard
[01:23:12.220 --> 01:23:15.180]   to decide on the single, really hard.
[01:23:15.180 --> 01:23:17.900]   Or I always fight for what goes on the record, always.
[01:23:17.900 --> 01:23:19.180]   I always put the record together
[01:23:19.180 --> 01:23:20.780]   and that's the record that I want it to be
[01:23:20.780 --> 01:23:22.500]   and me and the guys come up with that.
[01:23:22.500 --> 01:23:25.740]   And it's nobody else has influence, no manager, no label.
[01:23:25.740 --> 01:23:29.180]   The single, everybody wants to have a say in.
[01:23:29.180 --> 01:23:30.620]   Your label wants to have a say in it.
[01:23:30.620 --> 01:23:32.820]   Your manager wants to have a say in it.
[01:23:32.820 --> 01:23:35.220]   And I have fought really hard over that.
[01:23:35.220 --> 01:23:37.700]   And I've been wrong before and I've been right before.
[01:23:37.700 --> 01:23:42.140]   But as far as songs that I haven't put out, I mean.
[01:23:42.140 --> 01:23:44.540]   - 'Cause you can imagine so many songs.
[01:23:44.540 --> 01:23:47.780]   You think of so many Beatles songs
[01:23:47.780 --> 01:23:49.420]   that are like some of their greats,
[01:23:49.420 --> 01:23:51.180]   While My Guitar Gently Weeps.
[01:23:52.180 --> 01:23:55.340]   I'm trying to imagine weird sounding,
[01:23:55.340 --> 01:23:57.460]   not that interesting possibly songs that turn out.
[01:23:57.460 --> 01:23:59.540]   - The majority of what we put, honestly,
[01:23:59.540 --> 01:24:03.060]   it may be our best stuff is that we don't put out,
[01:24:03.060 --> 01:24:05.300]   for instance, because our band is such a,
[01:24:05.300 --> 01:24:09.860]   it's such a complex question.
[01:24:09.860 --> 01:24:11.260]   I really don't know actually.
[01:24:11.260 --> 01:24:12.540]   I don't know, maybe one day I'll die
[01:24:12.540 --> 01:24:13.900]   and people will look and be like,
[01:24:13.900 --> 01:24:16.020]   I hated Imagine Dragons, but now I listen to that song,
[01:24:16.020 --> 01:24:17.660]   I really like that, wish they would put that out.
[01:24:17.660 --> 01:24:19.380]   Or maybe they'll be like, oh, it all sounds like shit.
[01:24:19.380 --> 01:24:20.380]   I don't really know.
[01:24:21.420 --> 01:24:24.380]   - Well, that's, sorry, it is a tragic thing.
[01:24:24.380 --> 01:24:27.060]   That's why I ask it, which is like,
[01:24:27.060 --> 01:24:31.060]   there could be some great, incredible things
[01:24:31.060 --> 01:24:35.380]   that will take you a long time to rediscover,
[01:24:35.380 --> 01:24:36.940]   to realize how great they are.
[01:24:36.940 --> 01:24:40.820]   And it's also the tragic aspect of being an artist
[01:24:40.820 --> 01:24:45.020]   is you don't know, forget fame or all that kind of stuff.
[01:24:45.020 --> 01:24:46.900]   You don't know what's going to really move people.
[01:24:46.900 --> 01:24:51.220]   'Cause ultimately what you want is to connect with people
[01:24:51.220 --> 01:24:53.380]   and you don't know what that's going to be.
[01:24:53.380 --> 01:24:57.260]   It's hard, I mean, to me it's, to me it's tragic,
[01:24:57.260 --> 01:24:58.460]   just as a fan of yours to see,
[01:24:58.460 --> 01:25:01.740]   maybe I wonder if there's like incredible stuff there.
[01:25:01.740 --> 01:25:04.380]   Just as it is tragic to see great artists throughout history
[01:25:04.380 --> 01:25:06.900]   who didn't get recognition until they died.
[01:25:06.900 --> 01:25:09.860]   It's like, 'cause they basically held on,
[01:25:09.860 --> 01:25:14.140]   Franz Kafka was extremely self-critical.
[01:25:14.140 --> 01:25:17.580]   A lot of these folks had an idea of what's good and not,
[01:25:17.580 --> 01:25:18.620]   and they were wrong.
[01:25:19.860 --> 01:25:23.420]   They had genius, they weren't entirely wrong
[01:25:23.420 --> 01:25:25.300]   'cause they became sufficiently popular,
[01:25:25.300 --> 01:25:27.220]   but it's interesting.
[01:25:27.220 --> 01:25:29.820]   - I try to genuinely to release the songs
[01:25:29.820 --> 01:25:31.100]   that move me the most.
[01:25:31.100 --> 01:25:32.260]   - Got it. - I'll say that.
[01:25:32.260 --> 01:25:33.940]   - You're your own audience.
[01:25:33.940 --> 01:25:35.780]   - Yeah, I try to put out the songs
[01:25:35.780 --> 01:25:38.980]   that make me feel the most.
[01:25:38.980 --> 01:25:42.620]   Like I feel that, that's my only gauge.
[01:25:42.620 --> 01:25:45.540]   Because it's so subjective of like, what is good?
[01:25:45.540 --> 01:25:48.900]   Nobody knows the song that the masses are gonna like.
[01:25:48.900 --> 01:25:50.980]   Nobody knows that formula, nobody knows it.
[01:25:50.980 --> 01:25:53.380]   So for me, it's always what makes me feel something.
[01:25:53.380 --> 01:25:54.980]   One of the main lessons Rick Rubin taught me
[01:25:54.980 --> 01:25:57.820]   when we worked with him on this record was he would say,
[01:25:57.820 --> 01:26:01.900]   he would, his main point that he would continually
[01:26:01.900 --> 01:26:04.820]   bring up when, like, 'cause he's not the type of person
[01:26:04.820 --> 01:26:06.660]   to be like, "That's a bad song," or "That's good."
[01:26:06.660 --> 01:26:07.780]   It's just not who Rick Rubin is.
[01:26:07.780 --> 01:26:09.740]   It's more like, there's more nuance to it.
[01:26:09.740 --> 01:26:14.740]   He would say, "I don't really believe you on that song."
[01:26:14.740 --> 01:26:15.860]   (Rick laughs)
[01:26:15.860 --> 01:26:17.540]   That's what he would say, he would say.
[01:26:17.540 --> 01:26:21.260]   And I knew that was like, that song's a no-go.
[01:26:21.260 --> 01:26:23.220]   He'd say, and I would genuinely,
[01:26:23.220 --> 01:26:24.900]   there was a time he said it and it was about a song
[01:26:24.900 --> 01:26:27.740]   that I really, like, I really felt it
[01:26:27.740 --> 01:26:29.320]   and meant it when I said it.
[01:26:29.320 --> 01:26:32.260]   But he didn't believe it when he heard it.
[01:26:32.260 --> 01:26:34.540]   And that was enough for, I was like, man, well,
[01:26:34.540 --> 01:26:36.380]   at the end of the day, like, I can believe it all I want.
[01:26:36.380 --> 01:26:39.340]   But if the listener doesn't feel the honesty in it,
[01:26:39.340 --> 01:26:40.340]   just like we were talking about earlier,
[01:26:40.340 --> 01:26:42.460]   I think the most important ingredient is,
[01:26:42.460 --> 01:26:45.860]   is this truth, perceived as truth, to someone else?
[01:26:45.860 --> 01:26:48.100]   And if it's not, the bullshit indicator goes,
[01:26:48.100 --> 01:26:49.380]   and you're like, I don't care, I don't,
[01:26:49.380 --> 01:26:50.380]   throw it away, I don't care about it.
[01:26:50.380 --> 01:26:54.220]   - Well, you said that he made you go through,
[01:26:54.220 --> 01:26:56.380]   like, line by line, the lyrics.
[01:26:56.380 --> 01:26:58.680]   - Every single, that was excruciating for me.
[01:26:58.680 --> 01:27:02.280]   - Why was that excruciating?
[01:27:02.280 --> 01:27:03.920]   - Well, first of all, it's Rick Rubin.
[01:27:03.920 --> 01:27:06.540]   So you're in the room with, like, Rick Rubin,
[01:27:06.540 --> 01:27:09.820]   who's done a lot of the greatest of all time.
[01:27:09.820 --> 01:27:13.820]   And so I had to first just put that aside and be like,
[01:27:13.820 --> 01:27:15.600]   okay, well, you've done a lot of my favorite records,
[01:27:15.600 --> 01:27:17.740]   but still, you're human,
[01:27:17.740 --> 01:27:20.300]   and not everything you say is gonna be right.
[01:27:20.300 --> 01:27:23.220]   And I'm a strongly opinionated person, and so is Rick.
[01:27:23.220 --> 01:27:24.980]   And so when the two of us were sitting down in a room
[01:27:24.980 --> 01:27:27.040]   together, it was, you know.
[01:27:27.040 --> 01:27:30.160]   - But the lyrics, which is interesting.
[01:27:30.160 --> 01:27:32.380]   So it's not the entire composition,
[01:27:32.380 --> 01:27:34.260]   but just like, let's look at the lyrics.
[01:27:34.260 --> 01:27:35.380]   What do you mean here?
[01:27:35.380 --> 01:27:37.700]   - Yeah, oh yeah, 'cause he would look over every,
[01:27:37.700 --> 01:27:38.540]   there was like,
[01:27:38.540 --> 01:27:42.140]   and there were battles he won,
[01:27:42.140 --> 01:27:45.760]   battles that he didn't win, and maybe he was right.
[01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:46.600]   I don't know.
[01:27:46.600 --> 01:27:48.120]   I mean, there was, for instance, I'll give you an example.
[01:27:48.120 --> 01:27:50.780]   There's a song on the record called "Number One."
[01:27:50.780 --> 01:27:52.920]   Rick will probably laugh when he hears this.
[01:27:52.920 --> 01:27:55.120]   'Cause this was a big one
[01:27:55.120 --> 01:27:57.120]   that we kept going back and forth on.
[01:27:57.120 --> 01:27:58.440]   But this will give you a good insight
[01:27:58.440 --> 01:28:01.120]   of what it was like.
[01:28:01.120 --> 01:28:02.820]   And there's a line in it that says,
[01:28:02.820 --> 01:28:04.640]   ♪ I don't know ♪
[01:28:04.640 --> 01:28:06.320]   The chorus is, ♪ I don't know what I'm meant to be ♪
[01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:08.320]   ♪ I don't need no one to believe ♪
[01:28:08.320 --> 01:28:10.120]   ♪ When it's all been said and done ♪
[01:28:10.120 --> 01:28:12.300]   ♪ I'm still my number one ♪
[01:28:12.300 --> 01:28:14.280]   And he was like, "Nah, it just makes me cringe
[01:28:14.280 --> 01:28:15.200]   "when I hear that."
[01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:17.000]   (laughing)
[01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.720]   He's like, "I just, do you have to be like,
[01:28:19.720 --> 01:28:21.840]   "can it not be like, you're still my number one?"
[01:28:21.840 --> 01:28:24.340]   I was like, "No, it's not about anybody else.
[01:28:24.340 --> 01:28:25.560]   "It's about self-love."
[01:28:25.560 --> 01:28:28.040]   He's like, "Yeah, but do you need to talk
[01:28:28.040 --> 01:28:29.400]   "about self-love like that?"
[01:28:29.400 --> 01:28:31.680]   And I was like, "Well, I feel like I need to."
[01:28:31.680 --> 01:28:33.600]   He's like, "Well, but there's something else
[01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:34.440]   "we could say there."
[01:28:34.440 --> 01:28:37.920]   We just kept coming back to this song, okay?
[01:28:39.400 --> 01:28:40.280]   And I changed it.
[01:28:40.280 --> 01:28:41.720]   I tried changing it.
[01:28:41.720 --> 01:28:42.560]   What did I change it to?
[01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:44.600]   It was like, it wasn't, "You're still my number one,"
[01:28:44.600 --> 01:28:45.600]   'cause it just made no sense.
[01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:49.760]   It wasn't about some love thing or someone else.
[01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:50.960]   I changed it to something else.
[01:28:50.960 --> 01:28:53.320]   And it just, it was the one thing that I was like,
[01:28:53.320 --> 01:28:55.340]   "I'm really sorry, Rick.
[01:28:55.340 --> 01:28:56.920]   "I get it.
[01:28:56.920 --> 01:28:58.080]   "And if it sounds cringey to you,
[01:28:58.080 --> 01:28:59.680]   "it's definitely sounding cringey to other people too,
[01:28:59.680 --> 01:29:02.480]   "and that sucks, but I don't know how else to say this
[01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:05.800]   "in a way that I wanna put that song out anymore."
[01:29:05.800 --> 01:29:07.440]   But there were other songs, for sure,
[01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:10.880]   where Rick was like, "That or this, that word,
[01:29:10.880 --> 01:29:11.900]   "mm, feels a little trite.
[01:29:11.900 --> 01:29:12.960]   "You already said that once.
[01:29:12.960 --> 01:29:14.640]   "Can you say it in a different way?"
[01:29:14.640 --> 01:29:15.760]   It was really helpful.
[01:29:15.760 --> 01:29:18.960]   - It's really interesting, 'cause you're trying
[01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:23.960]   to say something so simply, and yet not make it cringe.
[01:29:23.960 --> 01:29:25.400]   - And that's really hard.
[01:29:25.400 --> 01:29:28.960]   - That's a strange art form, because you want to say
[01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:30.720]   some of the greatest love songs.
[01:29:30.720 --> 01:29:33.480]   I mean, we looked at the "Without You" song.
[01:29:33.480 --> 01:29:35.620]   I mean, the whole thing is cringey.
[01:29:35.620 --> 01:29:40.620]   If you just read it on paper, like it's a court report
[01:29:40.620 --> 01:29:45.560]   or something, but yet it's not, especially when sung, maybe.
[01:29:45.560 --> 01:29:49.440]   But no, there's something about, yeah, maybe--
[01:29:49.440 --> 01:29:50.960]   - Sung in a way you believe it.
[01:29:50.960 --> 01:29:53.300]   - When you believe it, but also written in a way
[01:29:53.300 --> 01:29:56.120]   that's singable in the way you believe it.
[01:29:56.120 --> 01:29:56.960]   So it's like--
[01:29:56.960 --> 01:30:01.040]   - Right, it rolls off, it just comes out in a way
[01:30:01.040 --> 01:30:02.560]   that just feels silky.
[01:30:02.560 --> 01:30:05.940]   - No word catches your mind as cringey.
[01:30:05.940 --> 01:30:06.780]   - Yes.
[01:30:06.780 --> 01:30:11.780]   - It's just, but then music, I think great speeches
[01:30:11.780 --> 01:30:16.020]   are like that, too, or just conveying,
[01:30:16.020 --> 01:30:19.140]   communicating ideas simply.
[01:30:19.140 --> 01:30:22.380]   That's the art form, is to not be cringey.
[01:30:22.380 --> 01:30:26.460]   So interesting, and then yet, 'cause when you're raw
[01:30:26.460 --> 01:30:31.460]   and real, it might at first feel cringey,
[01:30:32.280 --> 01:30:37.280]   but the battle there, and that's where you see people fail,
[01:30:37.280 --> 01:30:41.760]   like just regular artists, like, I don't know,
[01:30:41.760 --> 01:30:45.040]   at open mic, I go to open mic, so I just listen
[01:30:45.040 --> 01:30:46.880]   to musicians, like when they write songs,
[01:30:46.880 --> 01:30:48.960]   like they fail that test.
[01:30:48.960 --> 01:30:51.600]   They write simple stuff, but it's cringey, why?
[01:30:51.600 --> 01:30:53.640]   I wonder why was that, like what is that?
[01:30:53.640 --> 01:30:55.280]   - I'm telling you, Lex, I tried to explain this
[01:30:55.280 --> 01:30:58.800]   to my brother the other day, 'cause it's the same thing
[01:30:58.800 --> 01:31:00.840]   with a live performance.
[01:31:00.840 --> 01:31:03.980]   If I'm not in my right head space and I walk on stage,
[01:31:03.980 --> 01:31:06.880]   and I walk up and let's say I say something and I do this,
[01:31:06.880 --> 01:31:10.160]   'cause I'm like, this is the move, right?
[01:31:10.160 --> 01:31:12.180]   I'm like, this is the move.
[01:31:12.180 --> 01:31:13.480]   The crowd doesn't care.
[01:31:13.480 --> 01:31:16.640]   In fact, the crowd's like, that's cringey when you do this.
[01:31:16.640 --> 01:31:19.400]   But if I wasn't thinking about doing this,
[01:31:19.400 --> 01:31:21.480]   and I went up there and I said something
[01:31:21.480 --> 01:31:24.240]   and I really meant it and my body was like,
[01:31:24.240 --> 01:31:28.320]   I can't explain this to you, it's so silly to say out loud,
[01:31:28.320 --> 01:31:33.320]   but people will resonate to it when it's real.
[01:31:33.320 --> 01:31:36.520]   And when it's acted, you could do it the exact,
[01:31:36.520 --> 01:31:39.000]   the motion could look the same, your eyes look the same,
[01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:42.560]   but there's something about the energy that people know.
[01:31:42.560 --> 01:31:43.960]   They know if it's real or not.
[01:31:43.960 --> 01:31:45.400]   - Yeah, people, like you said,
[01:31:45.400 --> 01:31:46.720]   incredible bullshit detectors.
[01:31:46.720 --> 01:31:49.320]   - 100%, I'll go on a stage and if I'm not
[01:31:49.320 --> 01:31:51.240]   in the right head space to be real,
[01:31:51.240 --> 01:31:52.560]   it won't be a good show.
[01:31:52.560 --> 01:31:55.400]   If I'm real, then it's a good show, it's as simple as that.
[01:31:55.400 --> 01:31:56.800]   - Let's go through the song.
[01:31:57.640 --> 01:31:59.160]   (upbeat music)
[01:31:59.160 --> 01:32:00.760]   Like I said, great opener.
[01:32:00.760 --> 01:32:04.000]   So you had this in your mind, this landscape?
[01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:05.440]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:32:05.440 --> 01:32:06.760]   ♪ First things first ♪
[01:32:06.760 --> 01:32:09.640]   ♪ I'ma say all the words inside my head ♪
[01:32:09.640 --> 01:32:11.400]   ♪ I'm fired up and tired of waiting ♪
[01:32:11.400 --> 01:32:13.800]   - The beat was first on this.
[01:32:13.800 --> 01:32:16.120]   - What about the first and the second,
[01:32:16.120 --> 01:32:17.920]   like first things first, second things--
[01:32:17.920 --> 01:32:21.160]   - The first line I wrote was, first things first.
[01:32:21.160 --> 01:32:23.320]   I don't know why, it just was like,
[01:32:23.320 --> 01:32:25.360]   and then I was like, oh, that principle of, you know.
[01:32:25.360 --> 01:32:27.080]   ♪ I'm the one at the sail ♪
[01:32:27.080 --> 01:32:30.240]   - Great line, second things second,
[01:32:30.240 --> 01:32:33.640]   don't you tell me what you think that I could be.
[01:32:33.640 --> 01:32:35.920]   I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea.
[01:32:35.920 --> 01:32:37.440]   I'm the master of my sea.
[01:32:37.440 --> 01:32:38.360]   Such a great-- - My dad had that
[01:32:38.360 --> 01:32:39.360]   in his office.
[01:32:39.360 --> 01:32:44.360]   He had this saying that was something about the sailor
[01:32:44.360 --> 01:32:47.120]   and being the master of the sea that I always loved.
[01:32:47.120 --> 01:32:49.840]   - There you go, simple statement.
[01:32:49.840 --> 01:32:51.840]   - Yeah. - Zero cringing.
[01:32:51.840 --> 01:32:55.280]   It's so powerful, it's so simple.
[01:32:55.280 --> 01:32:56.240]   I'm the master of my sea.
[01:32:56.240 --> 01:32:59.600]   This whole song is just trivial,
[01:32:59.600 --> 01:33:03.760]   but in terms of lyrically,
[01:33:03.760 --> 01:33:06.920]   but extremely powerful and original, unique sounding,
[01:33:06.920 --> 01:33:08.400]   something about the words.
[01:33:08.400 --> 01:33:10.080]   Just even, you don't have to actually sing them,
[01:33:10.080 --> 01:33:11.120]   you just read them.
[01:33:11.120 --> 01:33:14.960]   And then raw, I was broken from a young age,
[01:33:14.960 --> 01:33:16.360]   dug myself into the masses,
[01:33:16.360 --> 01:33:18.680]   writing my poems for the few that look at me,
[01:33:18.680 --> 01:33:20.640]   took to me, shook at me,
[01:33:20.640 --> 01:33:23.000]   feeling me singing from the heartache, from the pain,
[01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:24.760]   taking my message from the vein.
[01:33:24.760 --> 01:33:27.520]   I can't, why am I reciting your words to you?
[01:33:27.520 --> 01:33:30.640]   But the percussionist throughout it,
[01:33:30.640 --> 01:33:34.360]   and that was there in the beginning.
[01:33:34.360 --> 01:33:36.280]   - The percussion is almost in the lyrics, yeah.
[01:33:36.280 --> 01:33:37.640]   And I'm a very percussive singer
[01:33:37.640 --> 01:33:40.800]   because I was a drummer first before I,
[01:33:40.800 --> 01:33:44.120]   I think same with Dave Grohl, probably a similar thing,
[01:33:44.120 --> 01:33:49.120]   which is I think in percussive sense a lot when I'm writing,
[01:33:49.120 --> 01:33:50.960]   'cause I, and I also was,
[01:33:50.960 --> 01:33:54.160]   before I could play an instrument, I would beatbox.
[01:33:54.160 --> 01:33:56.320]   And I think Michael Jackson did this too, actually.
[01:33:56.320 --> 01:33:58.520]   I've heard in the studio that he was very similar.
[01:33:58.520 --> 01:34:02.360]   But a lot of what I do is percussive
[01:34:02.360 --> 01:34:06.520]   'cause my brain thinks in, percussively first.
[01:34:06.520 --> 01:34:08.680]   - A little more 'cause it's so good.
[01:34:08.680 --> 01:34:09.760]   - It's almost like a drum, like,
[01:34:09.760 --> 01:34:12.840]   (imitates drum beat)
[01:34:12.840 --> 01:34:16.040]   - And then you lay words on that.
[01:34:16.040 --> 01:34:18.960]   - Yeah.
[01:34:18.960 --> 01:34:19.800]   - Yeah, this.
[01:34:22.640 --> 01:34:23.560]   It's building.
[01:34:23.560 --> 01:34:26.120]   - It's almost like drums.
[01:34:26.120 --> 01:34:29.200]   (imitates drum beat)
[01:34:29.200 --> 01:34:32.560]   - It's all building to the chorus.
[01:34:32.560 --> 01:34:44.400]   What about the word pain?
[01:34:44.400 --> 01:34:46.760]   When did that come to you?
[01:34:46.760 --> 01:34:51.440]   Pain, you made me, you made me a believer.
[01:34:51.440 --> 01:34:53.080]   - Yeah, just the idea of,
[01:34:53.080 --> 01:34:57.440]   I just wanted to, I really,
[01:34:57.440 --> 01:35:00.440]   one of the things that a lot of the songs that I like,
[01:35:00.440 --> 01:35:04.800]   I like divisiveness, for instance.
[01:35:04.800 --> 01:35:06.840]   Not always, but there's times where I want someone
[01:35:06.840 --> 01:35:09.160]   to hear a song and I want them to either love it or hate it.
[01:35:09.160 --> 01:35:11.640]   I really don't want them to be in the middle ground.
[01:35:11.640 --> 01:35:13.400]   A lot of the songs that,
[01:35:13.400 --> 01:35:18.320]   like a lot of my favorite songs are divisive songs.
[01:35:19.320 --> 01:35:22.520]   And so for instance, with pain,
[01:35:22.520 --> 01:35:25.320]   I want you to hear that and almost like,
[01:35:25.320 --> 01:35:26.920]   it's like, whoa, you know what I mean?
[01:35:26.920 --> 01:35:29.360]   And it's something either somebody's gonna hear
[01:35:29.360 --> 01:35:30.200]   and they'll be like,
[01:35:30.200 --> 01:35:31.480]   man, I just don't wanna hear that like that.
[01:35:31.480 --> 01:35:33.400]   Or it's like, oh, I felt that so deeply
[01:35:33.400 --> 01:35:35.680]   when he said that in that way, because it sounded like this.
[01:35:35.680 --> 01:35:38.560]   And when you think of the word pain, it's like,
[01:35:38.560 --> 01:35:39.400]   that's a,
[01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:45.400]   at least for me, when I hear that word,
[01:35:45.400 --> 01:35:48.200]   it carries a lot of weight, carries a lot of weight.
[01:35:48.200 --> 01:35:50.560]   So I wanted to sing it with a lot of weight
[01:35:50.560 --> 01:35:52.800]   and to come into that chorus with like,
[01:35:52.800 --> 01:35:55.160]   like it's a striking moment.
[01:35:55.160 --> 01:35:58.560]   And I'm also a tenor singing as,
[01:35:58.560 --> 01:36:01.320]   sorry, I'm a baritone singing as a tenor.
[01:36:01.320 --> 01:36:05.280]   So that's where that natural, like gruffness comes from
[01:36:05.280 --> 01:36:07.280]   is I'm singing out of my range, really,
[01:36:07.280 --> 01:36:10.120]   up in my head voice and it carries a lot of weight with it
[01:36:10.120 --> 01:36:11.360]   because of the baritone.
[01:36:11.360 --> 01:36:14.320]   - Can I ask you a specific sort of,
[01:36:14.320 --> 01:36:16.000]   the pause before the pain?
[01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:16.840]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:36:17.600 --> 01:36:20.040]   - It's really interesting, 'cause it's like a double.
[01:36:20.040 --> 01:36:28.200]   How much work does that take to get that right?
[01:36:28.200 --> 01:36:29.760]   That's incredible.
[01:36:29.760 --> 01:36:31.000]   'Cause it's like a,
[01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:34.320]   so you're kind of seeing the beauty through that
[01:36:34.320 --> 01:36:36.520]   and then that, whatever that sound is, the--
[01:36:36.520 --> 01:36:38.000]   - Right, the bass being rolled off.
[01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:39.480]   - Yeah, but, yeah.
[01:36:39.480 --> 01:36:43.240]   - Yeah, I actually, when I first was approaching the chorus,
[01:36:43.240 --> 01:36:44.080]   it was actually,
[01:36:45.480 --> 01:36:47.600]   ♪ I took a missing heartache from the pain ♪
[01:36:47.600 --> 01:36:48.640]   ♪ Taking my message from the vein ♪
[01:36:48.640 --> 01:36:49.800]   ♪ Speaking my lesson from the vein ♪
[01:36:49.800 --> 01:36:51.880]   ♪ Seeing the beauty through the ♪
[01:36:51.880 --> 01:36:53.960]   ♪ Seeing the beauty through the pain ♪
[01:36:53.960 --> 01:36:55.200]   ♪ You made me a, you ♪
[01:36:55.200 --> 01:36:56.280]   Like it came in on one.
[01:36:56.280 --> 01:36:59.080]   I'm not singing it right right now, but it did not wait.
[01:36:59.080 --> 01:37:02.440]   And it felt like it didn't hit
[01:37:02.440 --> 01:37:04.000]   in the way that it was supposed to hit
[01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:07.320]   because you predict that, right?
[01:37:07.320 --> 01:37:08.560]   You're like, you're waiting to hear,
[01:37:08.560 --> 01:37:10.080]   ♪ Seeing the beauty through the pain ♪
[01:37:10.080 --> 01:37:10.920]   ♪ You made me a ♪
[01:37:10.920 --> 01:37:11.760]   Right, it was like,
[01:37:11.760 --> 01:37:13.320]   ♪ Seeing the beauty through the pain ♪
[01:37:13.320 --> 01:37:15.200]   ♪ You made me a, made me ♪
[01:37:15.200 --> 01:37:18.120]   So I wanted it to feel a little more striking.
[01:37:18.120 --> 01:37:20.000]   Again, it's like that thing that makes you
[01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:21.000]   kind of do this a little bit.
[01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:22.200]   You're like, huh?
[01:37:22.200 --> 01:37:25.200]   But once you hear it a few times, you're like, ah, ah.
[01:37:25.200 --> 01:37:26.360]   And you predict, you know what I mean?
[01:37:26.360 --> 01:37:28.600]   It's like, I'd rather someone hear our song
[01:37:28.600 --> 01:37:31.360]   the first time and be confused by it,
[01:37:31.360 --> 01:37:33.160]   so they play it the second time.
[01:37:33.160 --> 01:37:34.480]   And then they're like, oh, okay.
[01:37:34.480 --> 01:37:35.320]   You know what I mean?
[01:37:35.320 --> 01:37:36.520]   I really don't want,
[01:37:36.520 --> 01:37:41.840]   I'd rather turn some people off along the way,
[01:37:41.840 --> 01:37:43.600]   and then the people who come along for you
[01:37:43.600 --> 01:37:46.960]   are gonna feel more committed, I think.
[01:37:46.960 --> 01:37:49.120]   - It's just an interesting,
[01:37:49.120 --> 01:37:53.080]   it feels gutsy to insert silence, you know?
[01:37:53.080 --> 01:37:54.880]   - Yeah, that's what makes it,
[01:37:54.880 --> 01:37:57.080]   the greatest speakers of all time are like,
[01:37:57.080 --> 01:37:58.280]   and I told you.
[01:37:58.280 --> 01:38:00.760]   - Right.
[01:38:00.760 --> 01:38:01.800]   - You would know.
[01:38:01.800 --> 01:38:02.640]   You know what I mean?
[01:38:02.640 --> 01:38:04.320]   It's like, you're like, oh.
[01:38:04.320 --> 01:38:05.840]   - Yeah, what is that?
[01:38:05.840 --> 01:38:07.280]   Yeah, that's so interesting,
[01:38:07.280 --> 01:38:09.080]   to do that just at the right time.
[01:38:09.080 --> 01:38:13.480]   And then pain, right?
[01:38:13.480 --> 01:38:15.880]   Man, it's a brilliant song.
[01:38:15.880 --> 01:38:18.680]   Did you know it was a good song when you wrote it?
[01:38:18.680 --> 01:38:20.800]   Out of the thousands of songs you've written?
[01:38:20.800 --> 01:38:23.040]   - You know, it's always the same thing for me,
[01:38:23.040 --> 01:38:27.160]   which is like, if I wanna listen to the song,
[01:38:27.160 --> 01:38:29.680]   and I wanna listen to it a lot of times,
[01:38:29.680 --> 01:38:31.800]   then those are the songs we put out.
[01:38:31.800 --> 01:38:33.520]   And I only wanna listen to the songs
[01:38:33.520 --> 01:38:35.000]   that make me feel something.
[01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:36.600]   Whether or not it's,
[01:38:36.600 --> 01:38:39.920]   our single that did the very worst of all our singles
[01:38:39.920 --> 01:38:42.880]   was the song that I wanted to listen to the least.
[01:38:42.880 --> 01:38:44.960]   But it made the most sense as a single,
[01:38:44.960 --> 01:38:46.640]   which was all the wrong reason to choose it, right?
[01:38:46.640 --> 01:38:48.400]   It was, "I Bet My Life,"
[01:38:48.400 --> 01:38:50.520]   is the single off our second album.
[01:38:50.520 --> 01:38:51.800]   And that song was originally written,
[01:38:51.800 --> 01:38:53.200]   it was just a guitar and a vocal,
[01:38:53.200 --> 01:38:56.280]   and it was very just quiet and laid back.
[01:38:56.280 --> 01:38:59.120]   And we were like, well, let's try to dial it up,
[01:38:59.120 --> 01:39:01.960]   let's try to produce it, and we overproduced that song.
[01:39:01.960 --> 01:39:05.400]   We self-produced it as a band, and we overproduced.
[01:39:05.400 --> 01:39:09.640]   And that song, I mean, it did good, you know,
[01:39:09.640 --> 01:39:12.200]   in terms of a song, but for us, it did not do good.
[01:39:12.920 --> 01:39:14.200]   Compared to our other songs.
[01:39:14.200 --> 01:39:15.960]   And I really look back at that
[01:39:15.960 --> 01:39:17.160]   and learned a lesson from that.
[01:39:17.160 --> 01:39:19.560]   It's like, if I don't wanna listen to the song,
[01:39:19.560 --> 01:39:21.880]   that's a sign already.
[01:39:21.880 --> 01:39:23.840]   If you don't wanna listen to your own song,
[01:39:23.840 --> 01:39:25.040]   it's probably not a good song.
[01:39:25.040 --> 01:39:26.560]   - Yeah.
[01:39:26.560 --> 01:39:30.320]   You said your dad, elsewhere and today,
[01:39:30.320 --> 01:39:34.320]   just said that your dad early on was a kind of
[01:39:34.320 --> 01:39:37.160]   the early Rick Rubin.
[01:39:37.160 --> 01:39:39.760]   So when you were starting out,
[01:39:39.760 --> 01:39:42.680]   he gave you feedback, you listened.
[01:39:42.680 --> 01:39:47.000]   What did you learn about music, about life from your dad?
[01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:53.040]   - My dad is a really quiet farm, grew up on a farm,
[01:39:53.040 --> 01:39:54.240]   very humble.
[01:39:54.240 --> 01:40:00.600]   I think he starts every sentence by saying,
[01:40:00.600 --> 01:40:02.840]   "This is just my two cents," pretty much.
[01:40:02.840 --> 01:40:03.680]   You know what I mean?
[01:40:03.680 --> 01:40:05.240]   It's like, take it or leave it.
[01:40:05.240 --> 01:40:06.080]   Like, you know what I mean?
[01:40:06.080 --> 01:40:07.440]   He's that kind of a sense.
[01:40:07.440 --> 01:40:09.000]   Like, there's humility in everything,
[01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:09.960]   and it's real for him.
[01:40:09.960 --> 01:40:12.400]   It's not like false humility.
[01:40:12.400 --> 01:40:14.160]   I really feel like when he's saying things,
[01:40:14.160 --> 01:40:17.480]   he really is like, "Maybe this isn't any worth to you, son,"
[01:40:17.480 --> 01:40:18.640]   and he means it.
[01:40:18.640 --> 01:40:20.240]   But here it is, and it's always gold.
[01:40:20.240 --> 01:40:22.600]   And I'm like, "Wow, Dad, that's incredible."
[01:40:22.600 --> 01:40:24.080]   - So what, in those early days,
[01:40:24.080 --> 01:40:26.480]   have you like, so you were like 12 or something like that,
[01:40:26.480 --> 01:40:27.320]   like starting to write songs?
[01:40:27.320 --> 01:40:28.400]   - I was 12.
[01:40:28.400 --> 01:40:30.040]   I wasn't showing my music to anyone.
[01:40:30.040 --> 01:40:31.320]   I started writing right when I was 12,
[01:40:31.320 --> 01:40:33.120]   and I probably wrote for at least,
[01:40:33.120 --> 01:40:34.520]   let's say six months or something.
[01:40:34.520 --> 01:40:36.280]   And I had written probably, I don't know,
[01:40:36.280 --> 01:40:38.560]   like a lot of songs during that time.
[01:40:38.560 --> 01:40:39.680]   - What was the topic, by the way?
[01:40:39.680 --> 01:40:42.000]   Love, anger? - It was all sad.
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.400]   No, it was, the first song I ever wrote went,
[01:40:44.400 --> 01:40:46.640]   (scatting)
[01:40:46.640 --> 01:40:54.360]   And it was like a bluesy thing.
[01:40:54.360 --> 01:40:55.800]   It was like, there was my voice doing that,
[01:40:55.800 --> 01:40:56.640]   and then it was like,
[01:40:56.640 --> 01:40:58.720]   ♪ All by himself ♪
[01:40:58.720 --> 01:41:01.880]   ♪ No other one around ♪

[01:41:19.640 --> 01:41:21.240]   (scatting)
[01:41:21.240 --> 01:41:22.080]   You know what I mean?
[01:41:22.080 --> 01:41:24.920]   It was like, but I was like a 12-year-old with,
[01:41:24.920 --> 01:41:29.040]   I just felt like depressed for the first time.
[01:41:29.040 --> 01:41:31.760]   And I was, and I just was like so--
[01:41:31.760 --> 01:41:33.200]   - I think you discovered the blues as a 12-year-old.
[01:41:33.200 --> 01:41:34.480]   - Yeah, right, right.
[01:41:34.480 --> 01:41:35.320]   It really was.
[01:41:35.320 --> 01:41:37.040]   It was like my sense of the blues at that time, for sure.
[01:41:37.040 --> 01:41:38.200]   Like bad version of the blues,
[01:41:38.200 --> 01:41:41.040]   but it was like 12-year-old kid with a bunch of acne.
[01:41:41.040 --> 01:41:44.000]   And like, I just like, I hated going to school.
[01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.840]   I felt like that I just had not found myself.
[01:41:46.840 --> 01:41:48.120]   - Sounds like a great song, by the way.
[01:41:48.120 --> 01:41:49.600]   But anyway, I wanted to keep listening.
[01:41:49.600 --> 01:41:50.440]   I forgot I was--
[01:41:50.440 --> 01:41:52.040]   (laughing)
[01:41:52.040 --> 01:41:55.280]   - I don't know about that, but yeah.
[01:41:55.280 --> 01:41:56.520]   - What was your dad,
[01:41:56.520 --> 01:41:58.680]   which point did you begin to share it with your dad?
[01:41:58.680 --> 01:42:00.240]   - A lot of the songs that I wrote in the beginning
[01:42:00.240 --> 01:42:02.240]   were very much like Bobby McFerrin, like that,
[01:42:02.240 --> 01:42:05.340]   because our mic was in a part of the house
[01:42:05.340 --> 01:42:06.580]   where I couldn't bring over the piano,
[01:42:06.580 --> 01:42:09.600]   and the only instrument I played at the time was the piano.
[01:42:09.600 --> 01:42:11.200]   So I would do everything with my voice.
[01:42:11.200 --> 01:42:13.280]   But then I started to teach myself the guitar
[01:42:13.280 --> 01:42:15.320]   in that beginning six-month period,
[01:42:15.320 --> 01:42:17.160]   just watching my brothers play in their garage bands
[01:42:17.160 --> 01:42:18.440]   in the basement.
[01:42:18.440 --> 01:42:19.360]   And then I started to write songs
[01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:20.800]   a little more like Enya vibes,
[01:42:20.800 --> 01:42:23.040]   like stack my voice like 20, 30 times.
[01:42:23.040 --> 01:42:26.440]   And like Enya meets like Jarre,
[01:42:26.440 --> 01:42:28.480]   which is who my dad would listen to a lot,
[01:42:28.480 --> 01:42:29.560]   John Michael Jarre.
[01:42:29.560 --> 01:42:31.400]   He's an incredible synth genius.
[01:42:31.400 --> 01:42:36.400]   But anyway, so I finally got my gall up enough
[01:42:36.560 --> 01:42:38.580]   to show it to my dad one day after work.
[01:42:38.580 --> 01:42:40.100]   And I got very little of my dad
[01:42:40.100 --> 01:42:41.020]   'cause there were nine kids,
[01:42:41.020 --> 01:42:43.980]   and he worked from 8 a.m. till 6 p.m.
[01:42:43.980 --> 01:42:44.940]   Well, come on, very tired,
[01:42:44.940 --> 01:42:47.620]   and here's nine kids that are like, "Dad!"
[01:42:47.620 --> 01:42:48.860]   And you're the young one, you're not,
[01:42:48.860 --> 01:42:49.780]   you're just gonna miss,
[01:42:49.780 --> 01:42:50.980]   I was in the middle kind of too,
[01:42:50.980 --> 01:42:53.660]   so it's even, you know, middle child thing.
[01:42:53.660 --> 01:42:54.700]   But I sat him down, and I was like,
[01:42:54.700 --> 01:42:57.660]   "Hey, Dad, I just wanna like kinda show you a song."
[01:42:57.660 --> 01:42:59.140]   And he was like, "Oh," you know,
[01:42:59.140 --> 01:43:00.580]   he didn't know I was writing anything,
[01:43:00.580 --> 01:43:03.020]   and I showed it to him, and he listened.
[01:43:03.020 --> 01:43:04.500]   And he took it off, and he really looked at me,
[01:43:04.500 --> 01:43:06.960]   and he was like, "That was really good."
[01:43:06.960 --> 01:43:09.640]   He was like, "I thought, and this, when you said this,
[01:43:09.640 --> 01:43:10.480]   it made me feel this."
[01:43:10.480 --> 01:43:12.080]   He was like, and that did it.
[01:43:12.080 --> 01:43:14.360]   I probably would've given up music.
[01:43:14.360 --> 01:43:17.540]   Like, I look back, that was a very pivotal moment for me.
[01:43:17.540 --> 01:43:19.720]   I was like in a place where I was like,
[01:43:19.720 --> 01:43:21.600]   "Is this good, bad, I don't know,
[01:43:21.600 --> 01:43:24.000]   maybe it's so embarrassing and terrible."
[01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:25.200]   And I was already writing lyrics
[01:43:25.200 --> 01:43:27.540]   that were a little like overly metaphorical to hide
[01:43:27.540 --> 01:43:29.240]   that I was dealing with faith crisis,
[01:43:29.240 --> 01:43:31.280]   'cause I thought, "Okay, I'm gonna show this to Dad.
[01:43:31.280 --> 01:43:32.920]   I don't want my dad to know I'm like
[01:43:32.920 --> 01:43:35.580]   questioning the truthfulness of Joseph Smith."
[01:43:35.580 --> 01:43:36.920]   So I'm not gonna be like,
[01:43:36.920 --> 01:43:38.620]   ♪ Is Joseph Smith a real prophet ♪
[01:43:38.620 --> 01:43:40.660]   ♪ Is Mormonism true, I don't really know ♪
[01:43:40.660 --> 01:43:41.500]   Like, you know what I mean?
[01:43:41.500 --> 01:43:43.500]   I was like writing way overly metaphorical.
[01:43:43.500 --> 01:43:46.020]   But because my dad really validated it,
[01:43:46.020 --> 01:43:47.860]   and he was a no-bullshit person,
[01:43:47.860 --> 01:43:49.580]   so I knew when my dad said that, I was like,
[01:43:49.580 --> 01:43:50.820]   "You know what, at least my dad
[01:43:50.820 --> 01:43:52.420]   really actually thinks this is cool."
[01:43:52.420 --> 01:43:54.220]   And I really trusted my dad's taste,
[01:43:54.220 --> 01:43:56.880]   and thought everything he listened to was cool,
[01:43:56.880 --> 01:43:59.160]   so I was like, "Wow, I'm gonna keep doing this."
[01:43:59.160 --> 01:44:01.100]   And I just showed it to my dad for years and years.
[01:44:01.100 --> 01:44:03.200]   And still to this day, I send every song to my dad.
[01:44:03.200 --> 01:44:05.480]   - So he, underneath it, with the feedback,
[01:44:05.480 --> 01:44:07.960]   is always like, "Ooh, I like this idea, I like this."
[01:44:07.960 --> 01:44:09.200]   It's just a positive, like a--
[01:44:09.200 --> 01:44:10.480]   - Not always positive, no.
[01:44:10.480 --> 01:44:13.040]   - But like underneath it, do you sense the positivity?
[01:44:13.040 --> 01:44:15.120]   'Cause I think that's-- - Always.
[01:44:15.120 --> 01:44:18.460]   Never mean, never malicious.
[01:44:18.460 --> 01:44:21.480]   You know, there's two types of criticism.
[01:44:21.480 --> 01:44:22.880]   There's like criticism that's just like
[01:44:22.880 --> 01:44:24.720]   you're looking to be hurtful to someone,
[01:44:24.720 --> 01:44:26.600]   and then there's criticism that's like
[01:44:26.600 --> 01:44:28.640]   really important for art.
[01:44:28.640 --> 01:44:30.740]   It's the type of criticism that's like
[01:44:30.740 --> 01:44:32.520]   you see the value in what's happening,
[01:44:32.520 --> 01:44:35.440]   and if it's honest, then you maybe communicate
[01:44:35.440 --> 01:44:38.560]   with that person like, "I see what you're trying to do
[01:44:38.560 --> 01:44:39.400]   "with that."
[01:44:39.400 --> 01:44:41.280]   It's not even like you have to say that or whatever,
[01:44:41.280 --> 01:44:43.520]   like butter it up, but it's like,
[01:44:43.520 --> 01:44:46.520]   my dad would just give me this honest criticism
[01:44:46.520 --> 01:44:49.360]   that would be like, you know,
[01:44:49.360 --> 01:44:51.800]   it certainly wasn't always good,
[01:44:51.800 --> 01:44:53.600]   but I knew it was always well-intentioned.
[01:44:53.600 --> 01:44:55.200]   I guess that's how I would say.
[01:44:55.200 --> 01:44:57.280]   - So you mentioned, maybe you re-listened to,
[01:44:57.280 --> 01:44:58.640]   I'm a big fan of Cass Stevens.
[01:44:58.640 --> 01:45:01.660]   You maybe re-listened to "Father and Son."
[01:45:01.660 --> 01:45:04.180]   I probably, all sons have issues
[01:45:04.180 --> 01:45:05.980]   to work through with their fathers.
[01:45:05.980 --> 01:45:10.580]   And you said that you connect with this song in particular.
[01:45:10.580 --> 01:45:13.220]   I think, so you're a father now.
[01:45:13.220 --> 01:45:16.220]   What is it about the song that connects with you?
[01:45:16.220 --> 01:45:18.380]   For people, let me play it.
[01:45:18.380 --> 01:45:19.580]   Let me play it a little bit.
[01:45:19.580 --> 01:45:21.980]   People should educate themselves on Cass Stevens.
[01:45:21.980 --> 01:45:22.820]   - Oh my gosh.
[01:45:22.820 --> 01:45:23.640]   - "Ride on the Peace Train."
[01:45:23.640 --> 01:45:25.060]   - The best, the best piece.
[01:45:25.060 --> 01:45:27.020]   ♪ Ride on the peace train ♪
[01:45:27.020 --> 01:45:29.860]   - You think this is a hopeful or sad song?
[01:45:29.860 --> 01:45:31.180]   - I hear it as hopeful.
[01:45:31.180 --> 01:45:33.140]   I hear it as a loving father
[01:45:33.140 --> 01:45:34.700]   saying just what his son needs to hear.
[01:45:34.700 --> 01:45:38.260]   ♪ It's not time to make a change ♪
[01:45:38.260 --> 01:45:42.020]   ♪ Just relax, take it easy ♪
[01:45:42.020 --> 01:45:45.740]   ♪ You're still young, that's your fault ♪
[01:45:45.740 --> 01:45:47.700]   ♪ There's so much you have to do ♪
[01:45:47.700 --> 01:45:49.400]   - It's like that calm wisdom.
[01:45:49.400 --> 01:45:51.940]   - Yeah. - There's time.
[01:45:51.940 --> 01:45:52.980]   - It's wise.
[01:45:52.980 --> 01:45:56.460]   ♪ If you want, you can marry ♪
[01:45:56.460 --> 01:46:01.460]   ♪ Look at me, I am old but I'm happy ♪
[01:46:01.460 --> 01:46:02.380]   - And just the way he says that,
[01:46:02.380 --> 01:46:04.340]   that should be a corny line, but it's not corny at all.
[01:46:04.340 --> 01:46:05.180]   It's like, yeah.
[01:46:05.180 --> 01:46:07.100]   ♪ Once like you are now ♪
[01:46:07.100 --> 01:46:09.020]   - Look at me, I'm old but I'm happy.
[01:46:09.020 --> 01:46:13.180]   ♪ It's not easy to be calm ♪
[01:46:13.180 --> 01:46:15.900]   ♪ When you found something going on ♪
[01:46:15.900 --> 01:46:17.660]   - Yeah, I mean, the simplicity there.
[01:46:17.660 --> 01:46:20.980]   And it, yeah, but it's such a contrast with,
[01:46:20.980 --> 01:46:23.220]   what's his name?
[01:46:24.060 --> 01:46:26.460]   Harry Chapman with "Cats in the Cradle,"
[01:46:26.460 --> 01:46:32.460]   which is like the sadness of,
[01:46:32.460 --> 01:46:38.540]   so this feels like there's a wise, calm connection
[01:46:38.540 --> 01:46:42.140]   between father and son, right?
[01:46:42.140 --> 01:46:44.580]   With "Cats in the Cradle,"
[01:46:44.580 --> 01:46:46.540]   I don't know if you remember that song.
[01:46:46.540 --> 01:46:49.460]   He learned to walk while I was away
[01:46:49.460 --> 01:46:51.900]   and he was talking before I knew it.
[01:46:51.900 --> 01:46:54.660]   And as he grew, he'd say, "I'm gonna be like you, dad.
[01:46:54.660 --> 01:46:56.020]   You know, I'm gonna be like you."
[01:46:56.020 --> 01:46:58.620]   And the idea of that song is
[01:46:58.620 --> 01:47:00.300]   that he does become like his dad,
[01:47:00.300 --> 01:47:03.980]   which is funny, you know, something you've said.
[01:47:03.980 --> 01:47:06.420]   But in a different way,
[01:47:06.420 --> 01:47:09.260]   you become too busy to make that connection.
[01:47:09.260 --> 01:47:12.380]   His dad was too busy to make a connection with his son.
[01:47:12.380 --> 01:47:14.380]   And in a, not a dramatic way,
[01:47:14.380 --> 01:47:16.340]   in a very kind of calm, natural way.
[01:47:16.340 --> 01:47:18.380]   Like you don't, you just don't have time.
[01:47:19.660 --> 01:47:20.900]   You're busy at work,
[01:47:20.900 --> 01:47:22.580]   you're providing for the family and so on.
[01:47:22.580 --> 01:47:23.420]   There's connection,
[01:47:23.420 --> 01:47:27.100]   but you don't really get, form that depth of connection.
[01:47:27.100 --> 01:47:31.060]   And then the father, when the son shows up from college
[01:47:31.060 --> 01:47:31.900]   and all that kind of stuff,
[01:47:31.900 --> 01:47:34.060]   he doesn't spend any time with the father.
[01:47:34.060 --> 01:47:37.300]   All that, and just the calm sadness of that,
[01:47:37.300 --> 01:47:42.100]   that we can live parallel lives and never quite connect.
[01:47:42.100 --> 01:47:43.420]   - And there is a little bit of that
[01:47:43.420 --> 01:47:45.580]   in "Father and Son" with Cat Stevens too, you know?
[01:47:45.580 --> 01:47:47.380]   Like when the son is saying,
[01:47:48.380 --> 01:47:49.780]   "From the moment that I could talk,
[01:47:49.780 --> 01:47:51.580]   I was ordered to listen."
[01:47:51.580 --> 01:47:54.100]   I always remember listening to that line,
[01:47:54.100 --> 01:47:57.020]   feeling like that really moved me.
[01:47:57.020 --> 01:47:59.740]   But the beauty of that song is it shows,
[01:47:59.740 --> 01:48:01.900]   it's kind of like the theme of what I feel like
[01:48:01.900 --> 01:48:03.540]   we've talked about since the second you got here,
[01:48:03.540 --> 01:48:05.060]   which is something I really like,
[01:48:05.060 --> 01:48:06.580]   I don't know why it's such an important theme
[01:48:06.580 --> 01:48:07.400]   in my life right now,
[01:48:07.400 --> 01:48:11.380]   but the duality of just understanding
[01:48:11.380 --> 01:48:14.620]   that you don't understand someone else's situation.
[01:48:14.620 --> 01:48:16.660]   And there's truth to both sides.
[01:48:16.660 --> 01:48:19.180]   Like there's truth to what the father is saying to the son.
[01:48:19.180 --> 01:48:20.680]   He's like saying these things and he's like,
[01:48:20.680 --> 01:48:22.220]   "I'm looking out for you.
[01:48:22.220 --> 01:48:23.420]   I love you.
[01:48:23.420 --> 01:48:24.500]   Take your time with these things.
[01:48:24.500 --> 01:48:26.060]   If you wanna get married, you can.
[01:48:26.060 --> 01:48:27.060]   Like these things will bring you happiness."
[01:48:27.060 --> 01:48:28.880]   And then the son saying,
[01:48:28.880 --> 01:48:31.240]   "Listen, I wanna pave my own path.
[01:48:31.240 --> 01:48:32.080]   I wanna do this.
[01:48:32.080 --> 01:48:33.780]   Like, why are you telling me this?"
[01:48:33.780 --> 01:48:36.220]   The son's not wrong,
[01:48:36.220 --> 01:48:37.580]   'cause there's a lot of parents who tell their kids
[01:48:37.580 --> 01:48:38.580]   what to do and they're wrong.
[01:48:38.580 --> 01:48:39.420]   (laughs)
[01:48:39.420 --> 01:48:41.060]   And you know what I mean?
[01:48:41.060 --> 01:48:45.220]   And they don't let the kid form the path that they need to.
[01:48:45.220 --> 01:48:47.420]   But should you not be a parent?
[01:48:47.420 --> 01:48:48.260]   Like, you know what I mean?
[01:48:48.260 --> 01:48:49.100]   There's just two sides to everything.
[01:48:49.100 --> 01:48:51.420]   - Yeah, there's a thing.
[01:48:51.420 --> 01:48:54.860]   It is annoying when you're older,
[01:48:54.860 --> 01:48:58.260]   you get to see people do all the same things.
[01:48:58.260 --> 01:49:03.260]   You could say, "Well, this is a phase."
[01:49:03.260 --> 01:49:08.260]   And you'll see that this actually will end up in this way.
[01:49:08.260 --> 01:49:10.240]   You can like predict how the life unrolls.
[01:49:10.240 --> 01:49:12.380]   And it's very annoying for young people to hear,
[01:49:12.380 --> 01:49:14.020]   especially 'cause it's probably going to be true.
[01:49:14.020 --> 01:49:16.340]   It's like, "No, it's not gonna be like this.
[01:49:16.340 --> 01:49:17.260]   No, I'm gonna be different."
[01:49:17.260 --> 01:49:18.900]   But then you become that person.
[01:49:18.900 --> 01:49:22.620]   But that doesn't mean they also let them live that life,
[01:49:22.620 --> 01:49:24.740]   let them make the mistakes.
[01:49:24.740 --> 01:49:26.300]   But they're not mistakes, actually.
[01:49:26.300 --> 01:49:30.660]   They're like beautiful deviations
[01:49:30.660 --> 01:49:34.460]   from the path that they end up on.
[01:49:34.460 --> 01:49:36.600]   And those make the path.
[01:49:36.600 --> 01:49:43.020]   Do you have advice for young folks today?
[01:49:43.020 --> 01:49:48.020]   You've had an incredible dark journey
[01:49:48.020 --> 01:49:51.340]   and a successful one, a loving one,
[01:49:51.340 --> 01:49:55.900]   and one of the most successful artists in the world.
[01:49:55.900 --> 01:49:58.380]   Is there advice you can give to young people today
[01:49:58.380 --> 01:50:01.100]   that would like to find themselves to that way,
[01:50:01.100 --> 01:50:02.540]   especially if they're struggling?
[01:50:02.540 --> 01:50:04.020]   - I thought you said device at first.
[01:50:04.020 --> 01:50:05.740]   And I was like, "Honestly,
[01:50:05.740 --> 01:50:07.700]   I feel like that device is not helping."
[01:50:07.700 --> 01:50:09.580]   (laughing)
[01:50:09.580 --> 01:50:12.820]   Maybe everybody should throw away their devices.
[01:50:12.820 --> 01:50:13.820]   Advice.
[01:50:13.820 --> 01:50:21.180]   I would just say what I emphasize to my kids is
[01:50:21.180 --> 01:50:25.380]   I really, really want my kids to just learn
[01:50:25.380 --> 01:50:27.260]   to love themself.
[01:50:27.260 --> 01:50:29.840]   It's easier said than done.
[01:50:29.840 --> 01:50:32.280]   It's really easy to pick on yourself in life.
[01:50:32.280 --> 01:50:35.860]   It's really easy to look in the mirror
[01:50:35.860 --> 01:50:37.540]   and wish you looked different,
[01:50:37.540 --> 01:50:41.300]   wish you were more successful like that person over there,
[01:50:41.300 --> 01:50:44.680]   wish a lot of things.
[01:50:44.680 --> 01:50:50.580]   And people that I see that really succeed at life
[01:50:50.580 --> 01:50:53.580]   really succeed truly.
[01:50:53.580 --> 01:50:55.740]   And that doesn't mean they're making money necessarily
[01:50:55.740 --> 01:50:56.620]   or they're succeeding.
[01:50:56.620 --> 01:50:59.140]   And they're talking to a lot of people.
[01:50:59.140 --> 01:51:03.300]   Their success to me is like happy.
[01:51:03.300 --> 01:51:06.140]   And they have real self-love.
[01:51:06.140 --> 01:51:09.020]   You know when you meet someone, you meet Rick, for instance.
[01:51:09.020 --> 01:51:10.660]   You meet Rick Rubin.
[01:51:10.660 --> 01:51:12.180]   Rick has a calmness about him.
[01:51:12.180 --> 01:51:16.580]   And it's funny 'cause everybody sees him as this zen master.
[01:51:16.580 --> 01:51:22.460]   Rick is just a really loving person
[01:51:22.460 --> 01:51:24.820]   who also loves himself and has self-confidence
[01:51:24.820 --> 01:51:26.940]   because you just see it and it resonates.
[01:51:26.940 --> 01:51:28.060]   And that's why he draws people.
[01:51:28.060 --> 01:51:29.380]   And that's why he's so great in the studio
[01:51:29.380 --> 01:51:31.740]   because you know his intentions, always.
[01:51:31.740 --> 01:51:33.780]   As an artist, when a producer comes in, you're like,
[01:51:33.780 --> 01:51:35.900]   "Whoa, whoa, whoa, what are your intentions?
[01:51:35.900 --> 01:51:36.740]   "What are you trying to do?
[01:51:36.740 --> 01:51:38.380]   "Are you trying to get a hit out of me for the label?
[01:51:38.380 --> 01:51:39.940]   "Are you trying to make me something?
[01:51:39.940 --> 01:51:41.220]   "Are you trying to make me this
[01:51:41.220 --> 01:51:42.860]   "so you can prove this about yourself?"
[01:51:42.860 --> 01:51:44.740]   There's a lot in that dynamic.
[01:51:44.740 --> 01:51:46.040]   And the reason that Rick is so good
[01:51:46.040 --> 01:51:49.420]   is because you know his intentions.
[01:51:49.420 --> 01:51:52.000]   And his intentions come because Rick has that self-love.
[01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:56.280]   So for me, find the things about yourself,
[01:51:56.280 --> 01:51:58.660]   'cause they're there, that you love,
[01:51:58.660 --> 01:52:01.700]   and really focus in on them.
[01:52:01.700 --> 01:52:02.980]   And it's not selfish.
[01:52:02.980 --> 01:52:05.120]   I feel like I was brought up in a family, too,
[01:52:05.120 --> 01:52:08.940]   where it was like, never look inward.
[01:52:08.940 --> 01:52:11.340]   Be selfless, serve, serve, serve.
[01:52:11.340 --> 01:52:14.260]   Which, by the way, is a true principle of life.
[01:52:14.260 --> 01:52:16.440]   I think you love yourself more when you serve more.
[01:52:16.440 --> 01:52:19.140]   I think that's really evident in life.
[01:52:19.140 --> 01:52:22.660]   But also, spend time doing the things that make you happy.
[01:52:22.660 --> 01:52:24.400]   Take time every day to go on that walk
[01:52:24.400 --> 01:52:25.660]   that you need to go on.
[01:52:25.660 --> 01:52:28.460]   Listen to that book tape that you need to listen to.
[01:52:28.460 --> 01:52:29.960]   For me, that's something I need.
[01:52:29.960 --> 01:52:31.700]   I know if I do that, I'm gonna be a better dad
[01:52:31.700 --> 01:52:36.380]   because I gave myself some love back in life.
[01:52:37.420 --> 01:52:40.300]   And just forgive yourself, I think.
[01:52:40.300 --> 01:52:42.060]   Forgive yourself 'cause everybody messes up.
[01:52:42.060 --> 01:52:43.380]   Everybody hurts others.
[01:52:43.380 --> 01:52:45.580]   Everybody says unkind words at times.
[01:52:45.580 --> 01:52:49.780]   Everybody fails all the time.
[01:52:49.780 --> 01:52:52.980]   And if you think that you're gonna not, you're wrong.
[01:52:52.980 --> 01:52:54.060]   And you're eventually going to,
[01:52:54.060 --> 01:52:56.740]   and you're either gonna punish yourself for it every day
[01:52:56.740 --> 01:52:59.420]   and be a lesser version of what you could be,
[01:52:59.420 --> 01:53:01.580]   or you're gonna forgive yourself for it.
[01:53:01.580 --> 01:53:03.420]   And if you learned that that's not something you want,
[01:53:03.420 --> 01:53:04.480]   then try not to do it again.
[01:53:04.480 --> 01:53:06.660]   If you do it again, and you're probably gonna do it again,
[01:53:06.660 --> 01:53:09.300]   whatever that is, you're gonna gossip about that person.
[01:53:09.300 --> 01:53:12.380]   You're gonna feel bad because then you gossiped about someone
[01:53:12.380 --> 01:53:15.020]   - Is there something you could say in terms of self-love?
[01:53:15.020 --> 01:53:17.660]   Is there a role for being critical?
[01:53:17.660 --> 01:53:20.580]   Like those demons of self-criticism,
[01:53:20.580 --> 01:53:21.820]   do you need a little bit of that?
[01:53:21.820 --> 01:53:23.100]   Tom Waits talks about,
[01:53:23.100 --> 01:53:25.140]   I like my Tom with a little drop of poison.
[01:53:25.140 --> 01:53:27.460]   - Right. - You need a little poison?
[01:53:27.460 --> 01:53:31.060]   Or is that silly or a manifestation of poison?
[01:53:31.060 --> 01:53:34.300]   - Look, my biggest thing in life
[01:53:34.300 --> 01:53:36.220]   has been the thing that I've worked on
[01:53:36.220 --> 01:53:38.380]   the hardest for the last few years
[01:53:38.380 --> 01:53:40.100]   is to not be overly critical
[01:53:40.100 --> 01:53:45.900]   and to let go of control.
[01:53:45.900 --> 01:53:50.900]   I think it's really easy to kill an artist.
[01:53:50.900 --> 01:53:55.140]   It's really easy to kill an artist.
[01:53:55.140 --> 01:53:58.060]   Like if my dad would have sat down with me that day,
[01:53:58.060 --> 01:54:01.460]   and even if he would have just sat down and been like,
[01:54:01.460 --> 01:54:02.780]   good job son, okay.
[01:54:02.780 --> 01:54:03.620]   It sounds silly, right?
[01:54:03.620 --> 01:54:05.660]   Like I don't, I didn't, not everybody has a dad
[01:54:05.660 --> 01:54:07.220]   who's gonna ever do something
[01:54:07.220 --> 01:54:09.260]   or put in the time or whatever.
[01:54:09.260 --> 01:54:14.260]   But that might've altered everything for me.
[01:54:14.260 --> 01:54:17.460]   Like my dad taking the extra time to just give me
[01:54:17.460 --> 01:54:20.260]   a thoughtful response opposed to, kids know.
[01:54:20.260 --> 01:54:21.820]   Kids know when you're just like trying
[01:54:21.820 --> 01:54:23.060]   to get out of the room or whatever.
[01:54:23.060 --> 01:54:25.860]   I knew he wasn't and that did a lot.
[01:54:25.860 --> 01:54:27.140]   So yeah.
[01:54:27.140 --> 01:54:30.740]   - But is that a huge, is that what makes the artist?
[01:54:30.740 --> 01:54:34.720]   Is the fragility of it that like,
[01:54:34.720 --> 01:54:36.320]   would you have it any other way?
[01:54:36.320 --> 01:54:40.100]   - No, no, I agree with you.
[01:54:40.100 --> 01:54:45.100]   I think that that's what, that's the beauty of art.
[01:54:45.100 --> 01:54:48.760]   But I think also on the same token, it's like,
[01:54:48.760 --> 01:54:54.500]   I went to Music Cares recently,
[01:54:54.500 --> 01:54:56.900]   which is a charity for musicians
[01:54:56.900 --> 01:54:58.380]   that are down on their luck.
[01:54:58.380 --> 01:54:59.780]   That maybe were successful at one point
[01:54:59.780 --> 01:55:00.980]   or have never been successful
[01:55:00.980 --> 01:55:02.420]   and they can't even pay the bills.
[01:55:02.420 --> 01:55:05.440]   And this charity contributes money to these artists,
[01:55:05.440 --> 01:55:08.440]   aspiring artists or artists who've had drug issues.
[01:55:08.440 --> 01:55:09.800]   And like, there's a lot that they do.
[01:55:09.800 --> 01:55:11.920]   But, and there was a statistic that they told
[01:55:11.920 --> 01:55:13.240]   it was staggering to me, which is,
[01:55:13.240 --> 01:55:17.880]   I think it was 75% of artists, musicians,
[01:55:17.880 --> 01:55:20.600]   say they struggle with severe depression.
[01:55:20.600 --> 01:55:22.240]   That's really high.
[01:55:22.240 --> 01:55:24.320]   I don't know what the national average is,
[01:55:24.320 --> 01:55:26.380]   but I would guess that that's higher
[01:55:26.380 --> 01:55:29.200]   than the national average per occupation.
[01:55:29.200 --> 01:55:33.060]   So I just think there's a tricky balance.
[01:55:33.060 --> 01:55:36.340]   There's a tricky balance in art.
[01:55:36.340 --> 01:55:42.020]   So yeah, of course, like it's a necessary thing,
[01:55:42.020 --> 01:55:43.900]   the fragility of it all.
[01:55:43.900 --> 01:55:44.740]   But...
[01:55:44.740 --> 01:55:49.740]   - Yeah, I wonder, 'cause I'm extremely self-critical
[01:55:49.740 --> 01:55:52.080]   and I sometimes ask myself the question,
[01:55:52.080 --> 01:55:58.500]   I've romanticized it, or rather I've learned to be,
[01:55:58.500 --> 01:56:01.860]   for it to be productive, to channel it into productivity.
[01:56:01.860 --> 01:56:05.340]   But I wonder if there's better ways to do that.
[01:56:05.340 --> 01:56:07.380]   And I also wonder if it's eventually
[01:56:07.380 --> 01:56:08.820]   the thing that destroys me.
[01:56:08.820 --> 01:56:11.660]   Like if long-term, if it's a healthy thing,
[01:56:11.660 --> 01:56:14.820]   it might be useful when you're in sort of
[01:56:14.820 --> 01:56:21.020]   actively fighting the battles of the day.
[01:56:21.020 --> 01:56:22.460]   For me, it's engineering challenges
[01:56:22.460 --> 01:56:23.820]   and all that kind of stuff.
[01:56:23.820 --> 01:56:26.260]   But then when you're sitting back
[01:56:26.260 --> 01:56:29.300]   and enjoying life with family and so on,
[01:56:29.300 --> 01:56:32.900]   is that going to be, like, do you need to find that self-love
[01:56:32.900 --> 01:56:37.660]   like ability to kind of silence
[01:56:37.660 --> 01:56:39.520]   the voice of criticism in your head?
[01:56:39.520 --> 01:56:42.540]   - You know what, I really, you're making a good point.
[01:56:42.540 --> 01:56:47.540]   And I think that the middle ground is you need,
[01:56:47.540 --> 01:56:55.980]   you need self-doubt to push you to be better.
[01:56:55.980 --> 01:57:00.980]   I do believe that, for instance, if I believed,
[01:57:00.980 --> 01:57:02.860]   I've hit my, like when you're like,
[01:57:02.860 --> 01:57:05.020]   is there a song on there that you think is genius?
[01:57:05.020 --> 01:57:07.420]   If I think I've written a genius song ever,
[01:57:07.420 --> 01:57:09.460]   I think I'd probably stop.
[01:57:09.460 --> 01:57:13.020]   I think I'd be like, you know what, did it, I wrote,
[01:57:13.020 --> 01:57:16.380]   what's that perfect song?
[01:57:16.380 --> 01:57:18.660]   - "Stairway to Heaven"?
[01:57:18.660 --> 01:57:21.500]   - If I'd done one in, "Imagine."
[01:57:21.500 --> 01:57:22.320]   - "Imagine," yeah.
[01:57:22.320 --> 01:57:24.380]   - Okay, if I'd written "Imagine,"
[01:57:24.380 --> 01:57:27.980]   I'd probably be like, that's it, did it, all right,
[01:57:27.980 --> 01:57:28.980]   perfect song's been written,
[01:57:28.980 --> 01:57:31.220]   that's the best thing I'll ever do.
[01:57:31.220 --> 01:57:36.220]   So the fact that there is self-criticism
[01:57:36.220 --> 01:57:39.820]   and criticism outside, I think is necessary.
[01:57:39.820 --> 01:57:44.220]   100% for sure, it pushes you, it pushes you, it pushes you.
[01:57:44.220 --> 01:57:47.700]   It's just finding the right middle ground
[01:57:47.700 --> 01:57:51.700]   for that young aspiring artist to also not feel squashed
[01:57:51.700 --> 01:57:55.340]   and to be heard and to love, not even to feel squashed,
[01:57:55.340 --> 01:57:58.300]   just to love themself so that when they're in the room
[01:57:58.300 --> 01:58:01.020]   playing the song, they'll believe it
[01:58:01.020 --> 01:58:03.300]   because they believe themself.
[01:58:03.300 --> 01:58:05.140]   They love themself enough that they believe it
[01:58:05.140 --> 01:58:06.080]   and then they'll do a great,
[01:58:06.080 --> 01:58:07.540]   and then the song will come out great
[01:58:07.540 --> 01:58:10.060]   and they'll do a great performance.
[01:58:10.060 --> 01:58:15.000]   - I have to ask, it's one of the very interesting aspects
[01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:18.540]   of your life, of the way you put love out there in the world,
[01:58:18.540 --> 01:58:22.500]   what is at the core of your support for the LGBT community?
[01:58:22.500 --> 01:58:28.060]   - A couple things, so one, growing up in,
[01:58:28.060 --> 01:58:30.760]   from a young age in the artist community,
[01:58:30.760 --> 01:58:34.980]   a lot of my closest friends were LGBTQ,
[01:58:34.980 --> 01:58:36.280]   starting in middle school.
[01:58:36.280 --> 01:58:41.340]   And I think a lot of the best artists in the world
[01:58:41.340 --> 01:58:44.660]   are LGBTQ and that's just, it's not a secret,
[01:58:44.660 --> 01:58:47.100]   like it's just, it's like the artist community
[01:58:47.100 --> 01:58:50.900]   is filled with lots of LGBTQ people.
[01:58:50.900 --> 01:58:53.740]   So I think being raised in that community,
[01:58:53.740 --> 01:58:58.140]   in that my friends struggled with their faith
[01:58:58.140 --> 01:59:03.140]   and their sexuality, really opened up my eyes
[01:59:03.140 --> 01:59:08.340]   to how incredibly hard that path is.
[01:59:08.340 --> 01:59:11.020]   For instance, okay, when I was in high school,
[01:59:11.020 --> 01:59:13.240]   there was someone who went in front of,
[01:59:15.380 --> 01:59:17.940]   who was LGBTQ and was Mormon,
[01:59:17.940 --> 01:59:21.660]   and felt like there was not a place for them in the church.
[01:59:21.660 --> 01:59:22.900]   They felt like the path, you know,
[01:59:22.900 --> 01:59:26.660]   when you're being told that it's evil and you believe it,
[01:59:26.660 --> 01:59:28.700]   because you believe in your faith,
[01:59:28.700 --> 01:59:31.340]   and you feel like it's unchangeable,
[01:59:31.340 --> 01:59:33.020]   you're putting a kid in a situation
[01:59:33.020 --> 01:59:36.100]   where there's really no good resolution.
[01:59:36.100 --> 01:59:39.060]   It's either be alone for the rest of your life,
[01:59:39.060 --> 01:59:41.340]   or marry outside your sexual preference,
[01:59:41.340 --> 01:59:43.020]   which I don't wanna marry a man.
[01:59:43.020 --> 01:59:44.180]   Like if I was forced to marry a man,
[01:59:44.180 --> 01:59:45.500]   I'm like, I don't want to.
[01:59:45.500 --> 01:59:47.500]   I don't wanna be married to a man,
[01:59:47.500 --> 01:59:49.500]   because I'm heterosexual.
[01:59:49.500 --> 01:59:51.940]   So you're forcing a kid into a situation
[01:59:51.940 --> 01:59:54.180]   where it's very dangerous.
[01:59:54.180 --> 01:59:55.340]   Long story short, this kid went in front
[01:59:55.340 --> 01:59:58.380]   of the Las Vegas Mormon temple and shot himself.
[01:59:58.380 --> 01:59:59.220]   Killed himself.
[01:59:59.220 --> 02:00:01.740]   That impacted our community.
[02:00:01.740 --> 02:00:06.860]   And not just that, but it was like severe bullying
[02:00:06.860 --> 02:00:08.420]   to LGBTQ kids.
[02:00:08.420 --> 02:00:11.380]   In the '90s, it was especially different.
[02:00:11.380 --> 02:00:12.580]   There's still bullying, don't get me wrong,
[02:00:12.580 --> 02:00:14.180]   but man, like bullying in school,
[02:00:14.180 --> 02:00:16.380]   I don't really know actually what it's like in schools now.
[02:00:16.380 --> 02:00:18.740]   Maybe the bullying's just as bad as it was in the '90s,
[02:00:18.740 --> 02:00:23.100]   but there was like, it was like,
[02:00:23.100 --> 02:00:27.540]   I would hear all the time, like the F slur being slung out
[02:00:27.540 --> 02:00:31.020]   at people who were LGBTQ all the time.
[02:00:31.020 --> 02:00:33.980]   And I wasn't even LGBTQ.
[02:00:33.980 --> 02:00:38.980]   So, you know, it's just seeing that,
[02:00:39.300 --> 02:00:41.260]   I think that every,
[02:00:41.260 --> 02:00:48.860]   any social justice issue takes all sides.
[02:00:48.860 --> 02:00:50.460]   It takes all pieces of the puzzle.
[02:00:50.460 --> 02:00:53.020]   If only the pieces of the puzzle contributed
[02:00:53.020 --> 02:00:54.700]   are from the side that is affected,
[02:00:54.700 --> 02:00:57.260]   I don't believe that we'll ever have resolution.
[02:00:57.260 --> 02:01:01.020]   We're doing a shit job and we need to do better.
[02:01:01.020 --> 02:01:05.580]   And that's just, that's the reality of it.
[02:01:05.580 --> 02:01:07.260]   So that's part of the reason I also have family
[02:01:07.260 --> 02:01:09.980]   who's LGBTQ and it's just something
[02:01:09.980 --> 02:01:12.500]   that's been part of my path.
[02:01:12.500 --> 02:01:14.540]   And I feel like I'm a big believer
[02:01:14.540 --> 02:01:16.940]   in take the path that is presented to you.
[02:01:16.940 --> 02:01:18.980]   And this was just something that came up in my life a lot.
[02:01:18.980 --> 02:01:21.140]   When I met my wife, she was living with her two best friends
[02:01:21.140 --> 02:01:24.420]   who were LGBTQ, who really didn't want her to marry me
[02:01:24.420 --> 02:01:25.340]   because I was Mormon.
[02:01:25.340 --> 02:01:27.180]   And at the time it was Prop 8,
[02:01:27.180 --> 02:01:31.700]   which was Mormons were fighting against LGBT, gay marriage.
[02:01:31.700 --> 02:01:35.900]   And so that, then they didn't come to our wedding
[02:01:35.900 --> 02:01:37.980]   and that really broke my wife's heart.
[02:01:37.980 --> 02:01:41.460]   So it was just like, because Mormonism represented
[02:01:41.460 --> 02:01:45.820]   everything that was against their community.
[02:01:45.820 --> 02:01:46.660]   So--
[02:01:46.660 --> 02:01:48.260]   - So you felt you had to say something.
[02:01:48.260 --> 02:01:50.700]   - Yeah, I felt like by not saying anything,
[02:01:50.700 --> 02:01:52.220]   I was saying everything.
[02:01:52.220 --> 02:01:55.380]   I felt like by not speaking up and being like,
[02:01:55.380 --> 02:01:58.220]   hey, Dan Reynolds is a Mormon singer.
[02:01:58.220 --> 02:02:01.100]   Here's this new band, Imagine Dragons, and they're Mormons.
[02:02:01.100 --> 02:02:03.500]   It was like, okay, well, what do Mormons represent?
[02:02:03.500 --> 02:02:04.860]   They represent Prop 8.
[02:02:04.860 --> 02:02:06.300]   What does Prop 8 represent?
[02:02:06.300 --> 02:02:09.460]   Bigotry towards the LGBTQ community.
[02:02:09.460 --> 02:02:10.300]   So what do I do?
[02:02:10.300 --> 02:02:12.180]   Okay, I can speak in every interview and be like,
[02:02:12.180 --> 02:02:15.140]   well, that's not me, I don't believe that too.
[02:02:15.140 --> 02:02:17.740]   Or I could just be more active about it.
[02:02:17.740 --> 02:02:19.780]   And especially when it was affecting my family
[02:02:19.780 --> 02:02:21.620]   and friends throughout my entire life, it was like,
[02:02:21.620 --> 02:02:25.020]   all right, this seems like a path that you need to go down.
[02:02:25.020 --> 02:02:29.220]   So long story short, it was a path that just presented itself
[02:02:29.220 --> 02:02:30.700]   through things in my life.
[02:02:30.700 --> 02:02:33.460]   - So just on that topic, religion and God
[02:02:33.460 --> 02:02:35.820]   give a lot of meaning to a lot of people.
[02:02:35.820 --> 02:02:40.060]   It gives tradition that brings people together
[02:02:40.060 --> 02:02:46.180]   across the generations, but it also can hurt people.
[02:02:46.180 --> 02:02:50.540]   What do you make about that tension?
[02:02:50.540 --> 02:02:54.740]   So a source of meaning, but also a source of pain for people.
[02:02:54.740 --> 02:02:58.420]   - The reality is, at least to me,
[02:02:58.420 --> 02:03:00.620]   again, this is just my reality.
[02:03:00.620 --> 02:03:01.860]   I feel like I'm doing my dad's thing
[02:03:01.860 --> 02:03:03.100]   every time I'm talking to him.
[02:03:03.100 --> 02:03:04.340]   I'm like, I don't really know.
[02:03:04.340 --> 02:03:05.700]   - My two cents. - Here's my two cents.
[02:03:05.700 --> 02:03:07.300]   - You have become your father.
[02:03:07.300 --> 02:03:11.660]   - The reality, and it's my reality,
[02:03:11.660 --> 02:03:14.420]   and it is the reality for sure, is,
[02:03:14.420 --> 02:03:21.380]   I think that religion has brought a lot of hurt
[02:03:21.380 --> 02:03:24.420]   and pain to a lot of people.
[02:03:24.420 --> 02:03:26.340]   Absolutely it has.
[02:03:26.340 --> 02:03:29.040]   I don't think anybody can dispute that on either side.
[02:03:30.580 --> 02:03:35.580]   Whether it's war, whether it's slaughtering
[02:03:35.580 --> 02:03:40.820]   of entire peoples, there's been a lot of pain
[02:03:40.820 --> 02:03:42.900]   and suffering that has come from religion.
[02:03:42.900 --> 02:03:46.660]   So my little thing that has been hard for me
[02:03:46.660 --> 02:03:47.860]   is a faith crisis.
[02:03:47.860 --> 02:03:50.900]   I had religion, and then I lost it, and then I had nothing.
[02:03:50.900 --> 02:03:53.620]   So for me, I was like, well, religion did that to me.
[02:03:53.620 --> 02:03:58.100]   But then at one point, it's kind of like,
[02:03:58.100 --> 02:03:59.980]   how much of my life am I just gonna complain
[02:03:59.980 --> 02:04:04.500]   about being raised Mormon or being depressed?
[02:04:04.500 --> 02:04:07.940]   As I get older, I'm like, okay, so what?
[02:04:07.940 --> 02:04:11.740]   Okay, it's really hurt me, but were there any good things
[02:04:11.740 --> 02:04:12.820]   that came out of Mormonism?
[02:04:12.820 --> 02:04:14.220]   Well, yeah, there's a lot of good things
[02:04:14.220 --> 02:04:16.780]   that have come to my family through Mormonism.
[02:04:16.780 --> 02:04:18.560]   Closeness, we're really, really close.
[02:04:18.560 --> 02:04:21.620]   Mormon culture is that you live together forever.
[02:04:21.620 --> 02:04:24.340]   The teaching is that your families are forever.
[02:04:24.340 --> 02:04:25.860]   We die, and then we go to heaven together,
[02:04:25.860 --> 02:04:27.040]   and we're together forever.
[02:04:27.040 --> 02:04:29.200]   My family really believes that principle.
[02:04:29.200 --> 02:04:30.120]   All of them do.
[02:04:30.120 --> 02:04:35.320]   And that instills a certain way of living
[02:04:35.320 --> 02:04:38.180]   that's kind of beautiful, even if it's naivety.
[02:04:38.180 --> 02:04:41.660]   There's something kind of beautiful about believing
[02:04:41.660 --> 02:04:43.540]   that we're forming these bonds together as a family
[02:04:43.540 --> 02:04:46.260]   and that we're gonna be together forever.
[02:04:46.260 --> 02:04:48.180]   It brings a lot of comfort to a kid, too.
[02:04:48.180 --> 02:04:50.620]   When I was little, I was like, wow,
[02:04:50.620 --> 02:04:51.740]   it's gonna be okay if I die
[02:04:51.740 --> 02:04:53.220]   because I get to see my mom again.
[02:04:53.220 --> 02:04:54.060]   You know what I mean?
[02:04:54.060 --> 02:04:55.980]   I really believed that.
[02:04:55.980 --> 02:04:58.300]   Is the right answer that you tell that kid,
[02:04:58.300 --> 02:05:00.040]   actually, when you die,
[02:05:00.040 --> 02:05:02.040]   you're not gonna see your mom again?
[02:05:02.040 --> 02:05:04.480]   Maybe, it might be, I don't know.
[02:05:04.480 --> 02:05:08.400]   And anybody who has a kid is gonna face that moment.
[02:05:08.400 --> 02:05:10.120]   I've already faced it, where you sit down,
[02:05:10.120 --> 02:05:12.680]   and my kid was like, hey, Dad, when you die,
[02:05:12.680 --> 02:05:14.360]   am I gonna see you again?
[02:05:14.360 --> 02:05:16.760]   That was actually a really hard moment for me
[02:05:16.760 --> 02:05:19.040]   because I was suddenly faced with,
[02:05:19.040 --> 02:05:22.920]   okay, do I give the answer that I thought was bullshit,
[02:05:22.920 --> 02:05:25.200]   or do I give the answer of what I think it is,
[02:05:25.200 --> 02:05:29.220]   or do I give the real answer, which is I don't know?
[02:05:29.220 --> 02:05:30.700]   And that's what I chose,
[02:05:30.700 --> 02:05:33.220]   which as a father, that's not always the easiest answer
[02:05:33.220 --> 02:05:35.300]   because your kid, it's a wonderful thing
[02:05:35.300 --> 02:05:37.620]   that you feel like you can give your kid the comfort of,
[02:05:37.620 --> 02:05:40.080]   hey, your parents are gonna take care of everything,
[02:05:40.080 --> 02:05:42.000]   we know everything, we've been around,
[02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:43.540]   my kid's always like, are you the strongest?
[02:05:43.540 --> 02:05:45.100]   I'm like, yeah, I am the strongest.
[02:05:45.100 --> 02:05:46.340]   You're stronger than everybody?
[02:05:46.340 --> 02:05:47.180]   - Yeah. - Yeah,
[02:05:47.180 --> 02:05:48.000]   I'm stronger than everybody.
[02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:48.920]   You know what I mean?
[02:05:48.920 --> 02:05:51.180]   So when you're faced with that moment,
[02:05:51.180 --> 02:05:54.020]   it's like, it kinda sucks to tell your kid,
[02:05:54.020 --> 02:05:56.440]   you know what, I don't know if you're gonna see me
[02:05:56.440 --> 02:05:59.840]   after I die, but I hope.
[02:05:59.840 --> 02:06:01.960]   That's why I said, I was like, I don't know, but I hope.
[02:06:01.960 --> 02:06:03.920]   I really hope, 'cause that would be awesome
[02:06:03.920 --> 02:06:06.320]   if we can hang out forever.
[02:06:06.320 --> 02:06:07.880]   And if there's any way for it to happen,
[02:06:07.880 --> 02:06:09.020]   I'll make it happen.
[02:06:09.020 --> 02:06:09.860]   You know what I mean?
[02:06:09.860 --> 02:06:11.700]   That's kind of what my answer was.
[02:06:11.700 --> 02:06:13.680]   So long story short, sorry,
[02:06:13.680 --> 02:06:15.760]   I know that I'm being lengthy on this.
[02:06:15.760 --> 02:06:18.280]   Is there, what is my thought on religion?
[02:06:18.280 --> 02:06:19.280]   It just is.
[02:06:19.280 --> 02:06:22.120]   It's been here forever, it's coping.
[02:06:22.120 --> 02:06:25.020]   Maybe it's, I can't say whether it's true or false.
[02:06:25.020 --> 02:06:26.840]   How the hell am I supposed to know?
[02:06:26.840 --> 02:06:28.600]   You know what I mean?
[02:06:28.600 --> 02:06:32.020]   I've lived 34 years on this planet.
[02:06:32.020 --> 02:06:34.140]   A lot of people have been around a lot longer than me,
[02:06:34.140 --> 02:06:35.940]   and they really believe very deeply,
[02:06:35.940 --> 02:06:37.940]   and a lot of them are smarter than me.
[02:06:37.940 --> 02:06:38.780]   You know what I mean?
[02:06:38.780 --> 02:06:40.220]   I look at my older brothers, for instance,
[02:06:40.220 --> 02:06:43.180]   who are very practicing Mormons.
[02:06:43.180 --> 02:06:45.460]   These guys are hyper-intelligent.
[02:06:45.460 --> 02:06:47.700]   My younger sister, hyper-intelligent.
[02:06:47.700 --> 02:06:49.340]   All of them start smarter than me.
[02:06:49.340 --> 02:06:50.380]   They all believe it still.
[02:06:50.380 --> 02:06:52.520]   So what am I supposed to say?
[02:06:52.520 --> 02:06:53.880]   Well, you're all stupid.
[02:06:53.880 --> 02:06:54.720]   You know what I mean?
[02:06:54.720 --> 02:06:55.800]   You're all wrong.
[02:06:55.800 --> 02:06:57.020]   I don't know.
[02:06:57.020 --> 02:06:59.180]   Maybe it's the South Park episode where everybody dies,
[02:06:59.180 --> 02:07:00.540]   and then they're like,
[02:07:00.540 --> 02:07:02.580]   well, the right answer was Mormonism,
[02:07:02.580 --> 02:07:03.880]   and everybody's like, aw.
[02:07:03.880 --> 02:07:05.660]   (laughing)
[02:07:05.660 --> 02:07:08.260]   Mormons love that moment in South Park.
[02:07:08.260 --> 02:07:10.060]   They're like, hey, that day may come.
[02:07:10.060 --> 02:07:11.100]   (laughing)
[02:07:11.100 --> 02:07:12.180]   That day may come.
[02:07:12.180 --> 02:07:16.760]   - Yeah, so maybe I don't know is the honest answer
[02:07:16.760 --> 02:07:19.040]   for everybody around the table.
[02:07:19.040 --> 02:07:22.060]   But the biggest question for which I don't know
[02:07:22.060 --> 02:07:25.380]   is the right answer is what's the meaning
[02:07:25.380 --> 02:07:26.420]   of this whole thing?
[02:07:26.420 --> 02:07:27.780]   What's the meaning of life?
[02:07:27.780 --> 02:07:32.260]   Now, you're not allowed to say I don't know.
[02:07:32.260 --> 02:07:33.460]   - Okay.
[02:07:33.460 --> 02:07:36.580]   - You can be just like your dad and say,
[02:07:36.580 --> 02:07:38.780]   let me just give my two cents.
[02:07:38.780 --> 02:07:41.740]   - Take it, whatever it's worth, take it or leave it.
[02:07:41.740 --> 02:07:42.740]   It's probably worth nothing,
[02:07:42.740 --> 02:07:44.760]   just piddle on the ground.
[02:07:48.680 --> 02:07:49.720]   - Why are we here?
[02:07:49.720 --> 02:07:55.520]   It's just busily creating all these kinds of things,
[02:07:55.520 --> 02:07:57.880]   worrying about things, having kids.
[02:07:57.880 --> 02:08:01.640]   - My purpose, at least right now,
[02:08:01.640 --> 02:08:08.160]   is to wake up and try to
[02:08:08.160 --> 02:08:14.700]   bring light love to the world,
[02:08:14.760 --> 02:08:18.840]   light love to myself and have integrity.
[02:08:18.840 --> 02:08:21.180]   That's my purpose.
[02:08:21.180 --> 02:08:27.120]   The ultimate purpose of life,
[02:08:27.120 --> 02:08:29.320]   I guess that's my ultimate purpose of life.
[02:08:29.320 --> 02:08:32.680]   I don't know what happens when I die.
[02:08:32.680 --> 02:08:37.160]   Ayahuasca gave me some sense that there's more to be known.
[02:08:37.160 --> 02:08:38.680]   I'm sure there are other things in life
[02:08:38.680 --> 02:08:41.180]   that would give me that, and I'm looking for it.
[02:08:41.180 --> 02:08:42.020]   I'm a seeker.
[02:08:42.020 --> 02:08:46.040]   I'm always looking for the next something
[02:08:46.040 --> 02:08:48.640]   to give me hope in something more,
[02:08:48.640 --> 02:08:51.480]   even if so I could just not bullshit my kids
[02:08:51.480 --> 02:08:53.980]   when they ask me that question and be like, you know what?
[02:08:53.980 --> 02:08:56.160]   I really don't know.
[02:08:56.160 --> 02:08:59.880]   I wanna not know more, if that makes sense.
[02:08:59.880 --> 02:09:04.880]   I don't wanna, I want to see things that make me confused,
[02:09:04.880 --> 02:09:08.380]   that make me question what I already knew.
[02:09:11.960 --> 02:09:13.560]   When I meet an atheist who comes up to me
[02:09:13.560 --> 02:09:16.520]   and they're like, atheism, atheism, atheism,
[02:09:16.520 --> 02:09:19.280]   it's just as laughable to me as when I meet
[02:09:19.280 --> 02:09:20.720]   the Mormon who comes up and they're like,
[02:09:20.720 --> 02:09:22.200]   Mormonism, Mormonism, Mormonism.
[02:09:22.200 --> 02:09:27.200]   I'm like, how do anyone, how do you guys know?
[02:09:27.200 --> 02:09:34.640]   - So you feel like you're doing some,
[02:09:34.640 --> 02:09:36.980]   through all your travels, through all the people you meet,
[02:09:36.980 --> 02:09:38.960]   you feel like you're still keeping your eyes open
[02:09:38.960 --> 02:09:43.960]   and your heart open to discover something new,
[02:09:43.960 --> 02:09:47.000]   like the Ayahuasca experience,
[02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:50.560]   that there might be deeper truths out there.
[02:09:50.560 --> 02:09:52.460]   - Yeah, and I wanna find 'em,
[02:09:52.460 --> 02:09:54.040]   and I wanna surround myself with people
[02:09:54.040 --> 02:09:55.240]   who are just looking for it.
[02:09:55.240 --> 02:09:57.940]   I'm not interested in people who are just looking
[02:09:57.940 --> 02:10:00.520]   to point fingers at each, life is so short.
[02:10:00.520 --> 02:10:02.980]   I'm looking for, it's one of the reasons
[02:10:02.980 --> 02:10:05.760]   that I wanna meet with you, is I was like, wow,
[02:10:05.760 --> 02:10:08.040]   Lex really seems like he's on a journey to find truth,
[02:10:08.040 --> 02:10:10.360]   and that humility for me, it's same thing with Rick.
[02:10:10.360 --> 02:10:12.680]   It drew me to Rick, it was like, I really,
[02:10:12.680 --> 02:10:15.120]   I see that and I identify with it,
[02:10:15.120 --> 02:10:16.280]   and that's what I'm looking for.
[02:10:16.280 --> 02:10:18.120]   There's the final song on our record,
[02:10:18.120 --> 02:10:19.840]   our new record that's coming out.
[02:10:19.840 --> 02:10:24.440]   The chorus goes, and this is like,
[02:10:24.440 --> 02:10:27.240]   this is my best answer to what you're asking.
[02:10:27.240 --> 02:10:33.300]   The chorus goes, ♪ Take it easy on me ♪
[02:10:33.300 --> 02:10:35.800]   ♪ I need some lullaby ♪
[02:10:35.800 --> 02:10:38.600]   ♪ They tell me heaven's just a lie ♪
[02:10:38.600 --> 02:10:40.520]   ♪ Well, I'm not surprised ♪
[02:10:40.520 --> 02:10:42.360]   ♪ Tell me that you know ♪
[02:10:42.360 --> 02:10:43.680]   ♪ No, you don't ♪
[02:10:43.680 --> 02:10:45.640]   ♪ Yeah, you're just like me ♪
[02:10:45.640 --> 02:10:48.720]   ♪ Can we just all hope for the best ♪
[02:10:48.720 --> 02:10:51.440]   ♪ Take it easy ♪
[02:10:51.440 --> 02:10:52.280]   So that's it for me.
[02:10:52.280 --> 02:10:54.360]   It's like, I'm in a place where I'm like,
[02:10:54.360 --> 02:10:58.240]   I don't know, tell me that you know.
[02:10:58.240 --> 02:11:00.200]   I'm not gonna believe you, maybe you do.
[02:11:00.200 --> 02:11:01.640]   I'm not gonna believe it, but,
[02:11:01.640 --> 02:11:04.360]   like, let's just be easier on each other,
[02:11:04.360 --> 02:11:07.440]   and try to find truth wherever it may lie,
[02:11:07.440 --> 02:11:11.280]   but above all, know that we don't know jack shit.
[02:11:11.280 --> 02:11:13.040]   - I think that's a mic drop moment.
[02:11:13.040 --> 02:11:14.140]   Dan, thank you so much.
[02:11:14.140 --> 02:11:15.300]   You're an incredible human.
[02:11:15.300 --> 02:11:17.520]   I love that you share with the world
[02:11:17.520 --> 02:11:21.040]   the darkness of your mind, of your life experience,
[02:11:21.040 --> 02:11:23.400]   and the beautiful light that you've shown to the world.
[02:11:23.400 --> 02:11:25.280]   So it's a huge honor,
[02:11:25.280 --> 02:11:27.120]   and thank you for spending your valuable time.
[02:11:27.120 --> 02:11:28.160]   Good luck on the tour.
[02:11:28.160 --> 02:11:29.000]   - Thanks, man.
[02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:30.520]   Thanks for having me.
[02:11:30.520 --> 02:11:32.000]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:33.060]   with Dan Reynolds.
[02:11:33.060 --> 02:11:34.320]   To support this podcast,
[02:11:34.320 --> 02:11:37.000]   please check out our sponsors in the description.
[02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:39.000]   And now, let me leave you with some words
[02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:40.360]   from Aldous Huxley.
[02:11:40.360 --> 02:11:44.280]   After silence, that which comes nearest
[02:11:44.280 --> 02:11:48.520]   to expressing the inexpressible is music.
[02:11:48.520 --> 02:11:51.480]   Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
[02:11:51.480 --> 02:11:54.060]   (upbeat music)
[02:11:54.060 --> 02:11:56.640]   (upbeat music)
