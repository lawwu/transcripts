[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.480]   - Pastor John, today we have a question
[00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.480]   that we get via email quite often,
[00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:09.940]   and it's a simple question.
[00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.480]   What does it mean to be spiritually lukewarm?
[00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.200]   - If somebody asked me that, Tony,
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.240]   the first thing I would say is,
[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.560]   do you mean you want me to say
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.400]   what your pastor meant last Sunday?
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.640]   (laughs)
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.520]   Or what the Bible means,
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.880]   and I don't know what their pastor said last Sunday,
[00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.280]   so all I've got to go on here is the Bible.
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.240]   And the Bible only uses this word,
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.720]   I mean the whole Bible,
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.600]   Septuagint, Hebrew Old Testament,
[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.880]   Greek New Testament, only uses this word one time.
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.280]   And so I know what they're talking about.
[00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.520]   They're talking about Revelation 3, 15, and 16.
[00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.960]   So here's what it says.
[00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.600]   Jesus says to the Laodicean church,
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.120]   I know your works.
[00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.180]   You are neither cold nor hot.
[00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.200]   Would that you were either cold or hot.
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.880]   So because you are lukewarm,
[00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.360]   neither cold nor hot,
[00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.920]   I will spit you out of my mouth.
[00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.160]   And that is about as scary as it gets, right?
[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.040]   If a Christian says I'm lukewarm,
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.840]   that means he might spit me out of his mouth.
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:16.800]   That means rejection.
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.980]   So I can see why the question comes up.
[00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.120]   Now, I'll give my take on this.
[00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:28.120]   Some people take cold and hot
[00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.000]   to refer to both good things.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.060]   Cold is good 'cause iced tea is great,
[00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.460]   and hot is good 'cause hot coffee is good.
[00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.580]   And so I would that you were cold or hot means
[00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.580]   I would that you were serviceable for refreshment as cold,
[00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.820]   or I would that you were warming as hot.
[00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.300]   I doubt, frankly, that's what it means.
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.820]   There wouldn't be any theological error in that,
[00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.220]   I don't think, but I'm inclined to think
[00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.220]   that when he says cold, he doesn't mean something positive,
[00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.340]   but rather he means utter indifference to the gospel
[00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.300]   and to Christ outside the church,
[00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.300]   a person who's blatantly rejecting Christ and unbelieving.
[00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.280]   And hot are those who are utterly devoted to Christ,
[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.940]   like Paul said in Romans 12, 11, boil.
[00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.420]   The word is, he said, be fervent in spirit.
[00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.040]   The word is literally boil in spirit.
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.860]   So Paul wants us and Jesus wants us
[00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.640]   to be red hot for God.
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.820]   But of course, the person would ask me
[00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.820]   who has that other interpretation,
[00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.260]   well, why in the world would Jesus say,
[00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260]   I would that you were cold?
[00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.740]   I mean, why would he say that
[00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.020]   if you think cold is unbelieving?
[00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:51.460]   And my answer is, it's Jesus' way of saying,
[00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:56.220]   better to be totally outside the church
[00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.220]   and clearly, blatantly, unhypocritically unbelieving
[00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:06.420]   than to be a compromised believer
[00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.100]   who puts on all the pretenses of church membership
[00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:15.100]   and religiosity, but inside there is no true commitment
[00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.820]   to Christ and no sense of need for Jesus at all.
[00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:26.140]   I have in my mind, 2 Peter 2, where it says,
[00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.180]   there are people who've escaped
[00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.820]   from the defilements of the world
[00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.860]   through the knowledge of the Lord.
[00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.520]   Then they become entangled in them again
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:38.500]   and their last state is worse for them than the first.
[00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.940]   So that's what I think Jesus has in mind.
[00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.780]   Better to be a person who's never tasted
[00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.140]   of the powers of the kingdom,
[00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:52.140]   then taste them and then play the game of churchiness
[00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.500]   and have no true zeal for Jesus
[00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.700]   because the last state of that person
[00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.180]   is gonna be worse than the first.
[00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.860]   Better not to have known.
[00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.860]   So if you ask me that, well, then what is lukewarm?
[00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.140]   Jesus, I think in the text,
[00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.340]   points in the next verse to what it means.
[00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.660]   It says, you say, you lukewarm people say,
[00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:22.000]   I am rich, I have prospered, I need nothing,
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.940]   not realizing you are wretched, pitiable, poor,
[00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:29.860]   blind and naked.
[00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.060]   So the picture of the lukewarm person
[00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.180]   is a person in church who is self-satisfied.
[00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.740]   I'm rich, I've prospered, I need nothing,
[00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.740]   I've arrived and they're not desperate.
[00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.540]   They're not desperate.
[00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.540]   They don't have a true view of themselves.
[00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.340]   What are they missing?
[00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.700]   They're missing the last part of that verse,
[00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:58.700]   not realizing you are wretched, pitiable, poor,
[00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.580]   blind, naked.
[00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.340]   So this is a group of people whose spiritual condition
[00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:08.220]   is in terrible shape and they don't know it.
[00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:11.220]   They think they're just fine.
[00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:14.780]   And that is what will be spit out of Jesus' mouth.
[00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.580]   They're hypocrites, they're not true Christians.
[00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:23.220]   And what they need to do, according to the next verse is,
[00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:27.180]   buy from me gold, refined by fire,
[00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.660]   so that you can be rich.
[00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:34.140]   Buy from me white garments so that you can be clothed
[00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:38.220]   and buy from me salve to anoint your eyes
[00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:39.340]   so that you can see.
[00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:41.100]   And here's the paradox.
[00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.300]   He just said to them, they are poor.
[00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.260]   They can't buy anything.
[00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:49.820]   I remember preaching a sermon on this years and years ago.
[00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:52.380]   I think I entitled it, How to Buy Gold When You're Broke.
[00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:54.780]   And the answer is, faith.
[00:05:54.780 --> 00:06:00.940]   This is a picture of a wretched, pitiable, poor,
[00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:05.580]   blind, naked person waking up and saying,
[00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:08.620]   by God, I'm naked.
[00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:10.860]   I'm blind, I don't know anything.
[00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:12.180]   I don't have anything.
[00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:14.620]   I'm utterly wretched.
[00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:18.940]   And then flying to Jesus, who has free gold
[00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:22.620]   and free garments and free salve for their eyes.
[00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:24.820]   And he'll give it to them and they go wake up.
[00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:29.420]   And the effect of that is that it produces warmth
[00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:30.340]   towards Jesus.
[00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:34.500]   It produces the boiling of our spirit of gratitude
[00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.900]   and trust.
[00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:40.260]   So that's my take on what it means to be lukewarm.
[00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:44.820]   Lukewarm does not mean true Christians
[00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:48.140]   don't have seasons of languishing.
[00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:49.540]   Doesn't mean that.
[00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:54.540]   It means true saints don't settle in with mediocrity
[00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:59.500]   and say, I'm rich, I'm prospered.
[00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.260]   I need nothing.
[00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.100]   I'll just do this religious thing
[00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:04.500]   and I'll just be just fine.
[00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:05.340]   No, no, no.
[00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:09.380]   A true Christian has an ongoing sense that in himself,
[00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:11.660]   wretched, pitiable, poor, blind, naked,
[00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:15.660]   and ever turning to Jesus for gold
[00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:21.500]   and for clothing and for salve for our eyes.
[00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:24.140]   - Thank you, Pastor John.
