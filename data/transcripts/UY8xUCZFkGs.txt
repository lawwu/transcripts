[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.380]   Let's talk a little bit more about assets, because your assets count against you, but they give you a pass on a lot of assets.
[00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.760]   So typically your retirement doesn't count.
[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:13.760]   So anything that's a pension, profit sharing, 401ks, IRAs, all that stuff is not counted against you.
[00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.020]   For the federal method, the FAFSA, your primary residence doesn't count.
[00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.180]   So your home, your home equity, your big mortgage, all that stuff just doesn't show up.
[00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:23.440]   So what does show up?
[00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.520]   Well, anything that's not retirement.
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.200]   So your savings, mutual funds, exotic investments, crypto, something like that.
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.580]   That's all, those are all assets.
[00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:32.820]   You'd have to report those.
[00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.540]   Stock options at work that are not tied into an actual retirement plan would count.
[00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.300]   Real estate, that's not your primary residence.
[00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:47.920]   So if you have vacation land or property, if you have business property, farms, some of those things would count.
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.060]   And then the other big one is college savings.
[00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.380]   So your 529s would count and those types of things.
