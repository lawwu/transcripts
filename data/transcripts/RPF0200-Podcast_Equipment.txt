[00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:22.560]   I've been asked a number of times by different listeners how I actually create the show. What's the equipment that I use?
[00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.720]   What do I what kind of microphone do I use things like that?
[00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.040]   And so today I decided in honor of episode 200
[00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.720]   I'll share with you how I create the show and some of the lessons that I've learned and
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.440]   I hope this will be of use to many of you who have told me that
[00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:47.900]   You're planning on creating your own shows. So today I'm gonna help you get the shortcut through your educational process
[00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:54.900]   Welcome to the radical personal finance podcast. My name is Joshua sheets, and I'm your host and I have been your host for the last 200 episodes
[00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.900]   and so today
[00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:08.020]   Like I said, maybe I'll share with you some of the stuff that I wish I had known
[00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.820]   I'm gonna start with a little bit of a background on my podcast
[00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.820]   I'm gonna start with a little bit of a background on my podcast
[00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.340]   Like I said, maybe I'll share with you some of the stuff that I wish I had known
[00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.740]   I think I've made just about every mistake that could possibly be made
[00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:26.860]   Over the last 200 episodes, but I'm still here still cranking away. I've learned a lot and today
[00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.700]   Hopefully you can learn something
[00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:42.340]   On today's show I don't plan to share any financial planning specific information for you
[00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.620]   so if you have no interest at all and creating a podcast or no interest at all and
[00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:53.100]   Knowing how I do it then feel free just to skip and doesn't bother me a bit and we'll be back to financial planning content
[00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.820]   Tomorrow, but for those of you who have expressed an interest
[00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.700]   I'm going to tell you a little bit about my process and and
[00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:05.740]   Through creating this show and some of the mistakes that I've made and some of the ways that I've learned to make things better
[00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.940]   Also specifically the equipment that I use. I'll comment make a couple of brief comments on
[00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.860]   what
[00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.260]   Recommendations I would make because I wouldn't do the same thing
[00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.980]   I have done again if I were to do it again, and then also this will be important as I'm actually still
[00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.900]   Recovering from some of the mistakes that I've made and you'll hear
[00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.940]   Very soon here a couple some of you may lose the feed. So right up here is a front a quick announcement
[00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.940]   I'm still gonna be changing one of the things with the feed
[00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:40.660]   my email newsletter system many of you have noticed has not been working for quite a while and the reason for that has to do
[00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.660]   With the feed issues that I've had
[00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.980]   podcasting specific term
[00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.380]   Don't worry. This isn't gonna be a very technical show
[00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:54.360]   But some of you may see that the show might stop updating for you coming forward in a few days
[00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.940]   I'll put out a special episode as the last
[00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.780]   episode into the feed
[00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:04.100]   And you'll see that pop up in your feed if that's the last episode in the feed and if you've noticed that hey, wait a second
[00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.380]   Joshua disappeared unless you check Facebook and find out that I've died unexpectedly in the next few days, which I don't expect to happen
[00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:15.580]   Then you should know that what happened is your feed was one of the ones that was still affected
[00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:21.380]   And so what you need to do is unsubscribe from the show search in whatever podcast directory you're using
[00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:26.380]   For to download my show search for radical personal finance find the listing again
[00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:33.080]   And then just simply subscribe again or even better just search the App Store on your device for radical personal finance and install the app
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.900]   That's the best way to listen to the show and you'll know that is correct
[00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:43.460]   So a couple of questions and I'll just give you an example these use a couple of these as examples one question from Matthew comes
[00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:46.820]   In says Joshua was just curious. What kind of microphone you use for the show?
[00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:51.660]   I've been looking into acquiring one and I wanted to reach out because I think your audio is extremely clear
[00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:52.780]   Thanks for the help Matthew
[00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.660]   Another one comes in from Trey and Trey says I've been listening to your podcast for quite a while now
[00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.860]   You've inspired me to start my own podcast and blog
[00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:04.020]   Question you ran it in one of your episodes how you dislike the way in which online affiliate marketing
[00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.100]   Influence the type of hosting service that you chose for your website
[00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:11.380]   I've come across the same listings as those you mentioned and I'm just wondering what web hosting services
[00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:17.240]   Do you actually use now and why I know you've said your original choice was bad because once you wanted to start expanding it
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.860]   With new content and code it failed
[00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:22.900]   So I make sure I'm starting off with the best host possible that will grow with my site
[00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:29.220]   Same question would apply for what podcast program or service you use to set yours up for you to share it. I'd really appreciate it
[00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.740]   so
[00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.540]   there are other questions as well, but I thought I'd just share a little bit about how I actually create the show and
[00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:44.220]   When I started the show, I literally had it was a I don't know $10 recorder that I recorded the first 10 episodes on
[00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:49.100]   that and the onboard microphone on my laptop just a cheap Dell laptop and a
[00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:54.460]   cheap recorder the recorder came with a copy of dragon naturally speaking that I bought back in the day and it was just a cheap
[00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.460]   recorder and
[00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:57.620]   nowadays
[00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.940]   Every single one of you if you want to start a show you really don't need anything more than your cell phone
[00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.140]   You can do it with your cell phone
[00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:07.780]   It's not necessarily going to be the easiest or the best nor do I necessarily recommend it
[00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.500]   But every one of you has an audio recorder in your phone
[00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:18.460]   You have a voice memo function and with a little bit of planning you can create an excellent sounding recording with nothing more than that
[00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:23.860]   Microphone which is pretty cool when you start to think about it. It's a pretty cool world
[00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:29.180]   We live in that you can do that. There's an app that you can use on your device. I think it's still only for
[00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.780]   iOS devices Apple devices
[00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:33.620]   But there's an app called boss jock
[00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:39.100]   Which is the best app to use if you're going to do something like that and you can just simply use your onboard microphone
[00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:40.620]   you can use your
[00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:45.740]   Headphones you can plug an external microphone into the iPhone and do that and I'll tell you about that in a moment
[00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:47.740]   how I how I do that and
[00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:56.100]   Or you can invest in a whole setup like I do like I have so I started the show without any equipment
[00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:01.100]   I just simply said well, let me see if I actually can create something the first episode I
[00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:07.220]   Sat in the middle of my bed and it was about the only semi padded place to absorb some of the acoustical
[00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:11.660]   sound waves that I knew of and so I sat down and
[00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:18.060]   Just started talking and then at the end of it. I went back and listened to it and I asked myself the question
[00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:19.820]   I said would I listen to that?
[00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:25.700]   Would I be interested in that topic and I decided that you know, I I mean it wasn't great
[00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:28.940]   But I would listen to it. I would be interested in it and
[00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:34.340]   That was my litmus test or whether or not I should record a show and I did the same thing again
[00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:37.660]   And I I mean remember what the second show was but I did another I did it the same thing again
[00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:39.460]   And I went back and listened to it
[00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:41.580]   I said what I listened to that and I said well
[00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:46.940]   I probably would and I decided to go ahead and publish them and there's absolutely nothing more than that
[00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:48.940]   that was all I did and
[00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:51.100]   But I didn't stay there
[00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:58.980]   my point was starting there is the first piece of advice that I would give you if you were interested in really anything is I
[00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:04.900]   Don't believe even still to this day. Although this is changing and I'll qualify this in a moment
[00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:06.900]   I don't believe that
[00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:09.640]   focusing on the quality of production is
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:15.260]   As nearly as is nearly as important as focusing on the quality of content
[00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:20.380]   Now that has changed dramatically in the last few years and
[00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:26.180]   Today it is so easy to have a high production value
[00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:29.500]   That in my opinion, there's no reason not to do both
[00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:34.300]   So focus on doing both
[00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:37.060]   But if you have to make a mistake in one direction or another
[00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:42.780]   focus on the quality of the content and if you're gonna go through the hard work of creating something a
[00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:46.060]   podcast or a blog make sure it's something that you
[00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:49.820]   Really want to spend the time doing that you think is important
[00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:52.660]   Because it will not be easy
[00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:56.580]   It will be fun at the beginning and then it will not be fun for a while and
[00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:59.900]   Don't expect quick results
[00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:07.180]   It's not gonna happen. And if it does you'll agree with me and say well, it's not gonna happen. Don't expect quick results
[00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:14.300]   So if you still want to do it then go ahead and do it but start by focusing on the quality of content
[00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:19.340]   That quality of content is probably going to be dictated based upon how much you know
[00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:22.700]   About the subject that you're podcasting about
[00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:28.700]   I heard a speaking coach years ago say don't ever talk about something
[00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:33.180]   Unless you know ten times more than you're ever gonna cover in the topic of the show
[00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:42.100]   And I think that's pretty good advice make sure that if you're gonna make your take your time to sit down and work at stuff
[00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:47.580]   Make sure that you know a lot more about your subject than you're even gonna get into and talk about
[00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:54.060]   Even my own experience with personal finance. I wanted to start a personal finance blog and I tried several times. I
[00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:57.700]   never formally went through the work of
[00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:02.980]   Starting a fancy site but many times I would say I want to write about finance. I want to write about finance
[00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:08.740]   I want to write about finance and I tried and I started and just was like pulling teeth because I wasn't ready even though I'd
[00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:09.940]   spent years
[00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:16.500]   Perhaps studying personal finance from the personal finance approach. I really wasn't ready and it didn't flow
[00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:21.860]   At this point though, and this is not meant to sound arrogant
[00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:27.420]   I hope it doesn't but at this point though, I think I probably talk about on the show. I don't know three or four percent of
[00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:32.860]   It's not even 10% of the knowledge that I have in different areas
[00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:38.940]   But that's come after thousands of hours of study for me at least and that I find really helpful
[00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:43.900]   When I sat down and thought about what would make my show different
[00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:46.140]   and
[00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:50.260]   If you'll remember my story after those first for the first ten episodes, I didn't have a plan
[00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:51.940]   I decided let me just try this
[00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:53.860]   I wasn't sure that I was committed
[00:09:53.860 --> 00:10:00.060]   But then after I had to pull the show down and kind of think it through I thought through what was my plan?
[00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:02.500]   What was gonna be different about my show?
[00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:06.420]   What could I compete on
[00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:12.640]   And I think in any business is important to start with figuring out. What is your unique selling proposition?
[00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:18.780]   Do you want to use the MBA speak USP? What's your unique selling proposition? What makes your content different? I
[00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:25.460]   Don't have necessarily a very compelling story so I couldn't compete based upon that
[00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:30.060]   There's all kinds of personal finance people that do and I respect them and admire them for that
[00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:35.940]   But that wasn't me, you know, I didn't it wasn't I'm almost 30. I'm not financially independent yet
[00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:40.180]   I'm still working my way through so I couldn't point to my great story. I'm not a millionaire yet
[00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:45.980]   So I can't point and say well look I'm a millionaire. So you should listen to me and I don't like making stuff up
[00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:48.940]   So even you know, a lot of people do that in this especially in this world
[00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:52.900]   I'm gonna make something up so I decided well that doesn't really that's not really my
[00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:55.180]   ability
[00:10:55.180 --> 00:11:02.420]   but what I decided I did have which most people didn't have don't have is I had a depth of knowledge in the
[00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:05.880]   technical formal financial planning space
[00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:09.180]   that very few people have and
[00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:10.620]   I had intended to do that
[00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:16.220]   I was just building my own career in as a financial advisor and trying to you know, invest in my income
[00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:18.220]   that's why I spent so many hours studying all that stuff and
[00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:20.700]   I had a breadth of
[00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:23.140]   knowledge because of my weird interests
[00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:28.300]   And I said well, what can I do then? I
[00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:35.020]   noticed a distinct lack of depth of content from a technical perspective and
[00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:38.100]   a distinct lack of variety and
[00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:44.660]   So I decided well, I've spent all this time studying what I can do. I may not be have the best production value
[00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:52.300]   I may have my share of ums and ahs and I may have many things that aren't going for me
[00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:54.740]   But what I can do is I can focus on
[00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:59.700]   Creating a lot of content and
[00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:03.620]   Content that goes deep and
[00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:09.980]   since that's what I like I knew that over time the people that would be similar to me would find that and
[00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:12.900]   That was how I chose to compete
[00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:14.940]   And
[00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:17.060]   So far, it's it's worked pretty well
[00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:22.460]   Now I still obviously consider it from time to time, but it's worked pretty well. I
[00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:27.220]   Was willing to do it because I believed that I could create a business
[00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:32.540]   Directly off of the show and everybody told me I couldn't and I decided that well, I might as well try
[00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:36.660]   Now I don't think you need to do that just a podcast
[00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:41.780]   Having a podcast as a part-time hobby can open up an incredible world to you
[00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:45.300]   And it can connect you with amazing people
[00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:51.100]   Even though your show may never be big or never be, you know top ten in any category
[00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:53.900]   Doesn't matter it still could be useful
[00:12:53.900 --> 00:13:01.580]   At this point the history of radical personal finance the show has somewhere my guests about four to five thousand listeners
[00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:04.300]   Most of the episodes are pretty consistently
[00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:07.100]   downloaded about five thousand times
[00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:13.420]   Some of them more a few of them less but usually pretty consistently about five thousand times
[00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:19.500]   That's pretty overwhelming to me when I actually sit and think about that. So I try not to think about that
[00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:22.860]   I think about a few individual people that I've corresponded with a lot
[00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:26.300]   I think about some of the people that were around since the very beginning and
[00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:29.740]   I just try to think of a few individual friends and
[00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:35.420]   the cool thing is some of those few individual friends have been with a show from the very beginning and
[00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:42.220]   I don't think you need an audience of five thousand people or fifty thousand people to have an incredibly effective
[00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:47.300]   Successful show and I think as competition gets stiffer and stiffer. I
[00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:53.460]   Think the tremendous benefit that we have in this independent media space is the ability to
[00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:57.780]   Focus on very small groups of people and help those small groups of people
[00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:00.660]   intensely
[00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:01.940]   When I
[00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:07.140]   came back and decided to start the show I knew that I was going to be creating a lot of content and
[00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:14.060]   I knew that I didn't have time to mess around with the audio stuff. I'm not a techno nerd
[00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:18.940]   I don't like it. And so I said so what can I do and what I learned was
[00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:25.740]   Primarily, I watched a video there is a podcast consultant goes by the name of Cliff Ravenscraft
[00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:27.700]   He has a show called podcast answer man
[00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:32.100]   And I found a video when I was researching who are the people that would teach people how to podcast
[00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:34.100]   He's one of the big ones there are others as well
[00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:36.100]   But when I was researching
[00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:43.620]   How to podcast he has a video where he talked about his podcast workflow and it showed him sitting down and starting his show
[00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:47.620]   Playing all the sound effects recording into it and then just simply being done
[00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:52.260]   essentially in producing a finished audio file that didn't need anything further after that point in time and
[00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:59.540]   That made me realize that I needed to invest a little bit in equipment so that I could produce the show in one take
[00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:02.060]   So I bought a microphone
[00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:05.800]   the microphone that I'm currently using right now, which is a
[00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:08.640]   Heil PR 40 that was
[00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:14.340]   Cliff Ravenscraft recommendation, I wouldn't buy the same microphone again, but it does it for a perfectly good job
[00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:18.740]   I bought an audio mixer and that audio mixer makes all the difference in the world
[00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:22.740]   It allows me to bring in the sound effects. I have a soundboard here
[00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:26.740]   And so if I have sound effects loaded up on my computer or loaded up on you know
[00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:30.980]   I have a phone here. So if I want to play this listening to today's show I can play I can play
[00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:33.980]   Have all that stuff right there where I can play it live
[00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:40.440]   Real time while I'm recording the show I can fade it in and out just like they do with a radio station normally
[00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:47.100]   That's also connected to the computer so that I can record the Skype calls and all of those things and I have an external audio
[00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:51.980]   recorder so I invested in that equipment so that I would be able to create the show in one shot and
[00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:57.800]   That's primarily what I do. I sit down in front of the microphone and I try to have my notes laid out
[00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:01.360]   I have the audio I queue up the audio and I
[00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:06.860]   Have it ready to go. I do the little intros and I just record the whole thing in one shot
[00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:11.660]   the audio goes out from the soundboard into an
[00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:17.220]   External digital recorder and this external digital recorder that I use is a Roland
[00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:20.620]   R05 I wouldn't buy that again either
[00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:23.300]   but I it works fine and
[00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:25.500]   I
[00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:28.900]   Put the audio directly into that and so I can record the whole thing in one take
[00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:30.220]   Then when I'm done with that
[00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:33.580]   I take a little SD card out of the audio recorder and put it into the computer
[00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:36.700]   The audio recorder is nice. You don't need all that equipment
[00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:40.500]   You can record directly into a free piece of software on your on your computer called
[00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:47.180]   Audacity it's the any the editing software that I use but the audio recorder is nice because it makes it so that I don't have to
[00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:49.180]   worry about the computer crashing and
[00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:54.140]   It's a useful backup. It's just a piece of hardware. It works every time
[00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:58.860]   It doesn't have software glitches like the computer does and so that was really useful to me
[00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:02.180]   So I invested in that equipment so that I would be able to create the show
[00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:05.500]   quickly with a minimum amount of editing
[00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:09.660]   even going back to the USP I've thought a lot about the
[00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:15.300]   Lack of editing that my show has and I regret some of the shows that I have published
[00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:20.940]   Some of the shows have been too long. Some of the shows have rambled some of the shows have not been perfectly done
[00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:23.900]   Some of the shows I wish I'd edited sometimes
[00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:26.620]   I wish I'd go back and edit the guests out
[00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:32.180]   But the problem is if I were to do that, I would be going away from my plan
[00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:35.020]   for a
[00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:38.700]   What is my unique selling proposition as a listener?
[00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:44.740]   Although this is changing as a listener for me as a podcast consumer or a media consumer
[00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:51.180]   If the depth of content is strong enough, I can put up with some things that I don't love
[00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:56.780]   If it's a subject I'm interested in and the depth of content is appropriate
[00:17:56.780 --> 00:18:02.340]   Even the same way that if I bring in personal opinions things like that
[00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:07.300]   I listen to a lot of people that I disagree with and what I look for is not to agree with people
[00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:08.940]   but I look for them to
[00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:13.620]   Defend their case or to make arguments that make me think and so that's been my approach to the show
[00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:17.340]   So even though I often will get comments or people comment, man
[00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:20.380]   I wish Joshua would edit his idea his audio or shorten the showdown
[00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:27.220]   the problem is you have to focus on what you decided to do and what you decided you could do and then
[00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:34.860]   Check to see whether it's working or not. It doesn't eliminate the ability to say I should do something more
[00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:39.140]   I should adjust something. For example, if I had the ability
[00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:42.820]   The financial ability and I decided it were a good investment
[00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:46.300]   I've thought about hiring an editor for the show, you know someone to go through and edit it
[00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:51.260]   Pull out some of the content that maybe is a little bit extraneous
[00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:56.660]   Pull out some of the rambling that I may have gotten into or maybe pull out a rabbit trail that I
[00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:58.820]   Allowed myself to go down
[00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:00.940]   the problem is that requires capital and
[00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:03.780]   If I do that
[00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:07.700]   if I do it, it takes time away from my ability to produce and
[00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:12.660]   It requires capital and I just haven't decided it's a good use of the dollar
[00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:18.500]   So if you're gonna start a show you have to know what you're trying to do and how you're trying to compete
[00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:23.340]   If you want to complete with compete with marketplace morning report
[00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:30.700]   you need to go and produce a tightly edited six minute update on the markets and financial news and get it on NPR and
[00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:34.780]   And trust me marketplace has a much broader listening audience than my show does
[00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:37.980]   But I don't listen to marketplace. It's boring to me
[00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:46.920]   So a lot of people do I don't so I'm trying to create something and I had this I've had to stay
[00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:48.980]   focused on
[00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:53.980]   What I believe is my unique selling proposition and I'd encourage you to do the same thing
[00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:57.660]   If you have a vision for something that you'd like to create
[00:19:57.660 --> 00:20:03.340]   You have a vision that for something that you think should exist that doesn't then go for it
[00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:12.100]   my vision was to create the depth of content and the breadth of content that I always wished existed and
[00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:15.020]   I wanted that content to cross
[00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:22.860]   the divide between the low-level tactical put money in your 401k to get an employer match and
[00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:25.460]   the high-level metaphysical
[00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:30.220]   change your mental thermostat about money and connect those two and
[00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:33.500]   I never saw anybody doing it. So that was my
[00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:36.100]   Decision I'm going to connect those two
[00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:38.660]   the reason that I'm emphasizing this is
[00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:43.060]   If you're thinking about getting involved in independent media, I
[00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:46.180]   Think you should
[00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:49.740]   But if you are thinking about that then
[00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:54.000]   You need to understand what you're doing and why?
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:59.540]   because if you go out and you start to look and say well who's doing this and is it working and
[00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:05.860]   You start to try to say I want to copy something you may or may not know why what they're doing is working
[00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:11.660]   There are a lot of shows that are extremely popular that are very tightly edited
[00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:17.660]   There's just best example the biggest podcasts that have hit the podcasting space or what are they? What's that show about?
[00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:24.300]   The guy starting the business startup the guy who starts the does the show about his starting up his podcast
[00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:27.060]   It's an incredibly produced show
[00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:32.900]   It's in the style of this American life, which is a you know, they have a great show. It's in the style of
[00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:37.860]   That type of thing it's an incredibly produced show
[00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:45.740]   But if you just try to con copy the production value you might miss why what they do actually works
[00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:51.020]   Some of it is production value a lot of his storytelling ability
[00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:55.360]   It's a hugely popular show. I don't listen to it
[00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:59.340]   Because I'm bored by I mean I listen to a few episodes of startup
[00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:06.080]   But I'm just thinking about things like this American life or whatnot. I'm often bored by it because it's not applicable to my life
[00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:11.820]   It's an interesting entertaining story and I think it's awesome the work that they do but it doesn't help me
[00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:14.380]   achieve my goals and
[00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:18.340]   For me as an individual I spend all of my time
[00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:22.200]   Looking for content that's going to help me achieve my goals
[00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:27.280]   If I want to lose weight and get stronger, which I do
[00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:30.380]   then hearing a story as
[00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:36.540]   Beautifully produced and developed and told as it may be about sharks in the Indian Ocean
[00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:39.540]   It doesn't help me
[00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:45.380]   So I go and look for a podcast and sometimes I'll find the most horribly produced podcast
[00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:49.900]   But if I find it to be encouraging or I find something where it's just helpful to me
[00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:53.860]   I'll listen to that one because it's helping me get towards my goals. I
[00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:59.620]   Guess the two best examples that I would give here and I know I'm laboring on this point
[00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:02.620]   But I believe it's the fundamental basis of anything
[00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:09.540]   That you should be considering if you're considering starting a show but two examples that come to mind. I started listening to
[00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:14.740]   So Cliff Ravenscraft, I wanted to learn how to podcast so I started to go and find podcasts
[00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:16.740]   That was one of my goals. Okay, I need to learn how to podcast
[00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:24.380]   So I went and looked for podcasts on how to podcast I started listening through them and what I first looked for was the basics
[00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:29.900]   Primarily the basics related to vision and so I focused on that
[00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:32.980]   later once I
[00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:35.740]   once I
[00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:37.460]   had the
[00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:43.540]   Technology established. I had the show up and had it running then I started focusing and saying I need to become really
[00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:47.900]   Knowledgeable about the technical side of things because I need to improve my quality of my show
[00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:51.700]   So I started listening to content on all this audio geek stuff
[00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:56.820]   You know compression and normalization and equalization and blah blah blah all this audio geek stuff because okay
[00:23:56.820 --> 00:24:00.980]   I need to be exposed to it. I don't want to be an audio engineer, but I need to at least have a
[00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:04.940]   Understanding of it so that I can do a better job creating my show
[00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:08.960]   So originally back to the two examples
[00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:14.260]   Because I was listening to podcast information. I started listening to Cliff Ravenscraft
[00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:16.780]   Cliff Ravenscraft
[00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:18.660]   Ravenscraft's
[00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:22.260]   Show called podcast answer man, and then I heard him
[00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:25.100]   He has another show and this show is called pursuing a balanced life
[00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:27.500]   So I went over and I said, let me listen to it
[00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:34.560]   See what it's about the show has very low production quality in terms of beautiful sounding microphone
[00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:37.140]   Generally
[00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:43.340]   He records it when he's out on a walk or literally on the treadmill or elliptical trainer or something like that
[00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:47.740]   He says an audio recording. It's just him basically maintaining an audio journal
[00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:55.700]   But for whatever reason from time to time I found some of his content to be encouraging. He was super overweight
[00:24:55.700 --> 00:25:00.420]   He's been losing a bunch of weight. It's like wow, this is kind of encouraging and I like this no expert
[00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:03.920]   No fancy agenda to you know
[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:09.700]   Sell me six-pack abs just and just a dude walking on his treadmill telling about what's worked and what hasn't worked
[00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:13.460]   But I've found some of the content encouraging now
[00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:14.500]   I don't listen to it all the time
[00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:19.680]   But that type of content what I mean is there's an audience for it even with the poor production quality
[00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:21.780]   Because I'm interested in the content
[00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:27.860]   The other example I would give what is the example of Jack Spirico's show the survival podcast?
[00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:31.720]   I enjoyed listening to that show for years. Well, he started his show in his in his car
[00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:37.660]   He was on having a 50-mile commute to work and to turn his driving time into something useful
[00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:42.220]   He started recording a show as I believe his story is at some point. I'm gonna have him on
[00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:45.340]   I've reached out to him to have him on but his story was that
[00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:50.780]   He got tired of listening to talk radio and just getting angry at the radio all the time without knowing what to do
[00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:56.300]   About anything so he pulled out. He got an audio recorder and he just started recording a show about
[00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:59.060]   survivalism in
[00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:02.100]   While he's driving to work every morning and putting that show on the air
[00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:05.200]   The production quality is terrible. He was in his car
[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:08.200]   Driving at 70 miles an hour down the interstate
[00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:14.700]   But the content was good and when you get to an interesting niche, it's a topic that I find interesting
[00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:16.900]   But I find it hard because there's so many
[00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:25.940]   Very intelligent people who are legitimately concerned about things that are possible dangers in life and there's so many nut jobs
[00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:32.180]   That you've got to sort through them. And so when you can find a show like his that was well balanced
[00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:35.780]   That was well built and that was both rational and real
[00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:38.420]   It's attractive. He's got a huge show
[00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:43.420]   so when you're starting a show spend a lot of time thinking about what you're trying to do and why and
[00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:48.100]   If you just want to do a show for fun to see if you like it, there's no problem with that
[00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:49.540]   I think that's fine
[00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:54.420]   but it's gonna help you if you're clear on what you're trying to do and why and
[00:26:54.420 --> 00:27:03.220]   It'll help you a lot if you can understand. What is your unique selling proposition? What is different about you and your content?
[00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:06.060]   than anybody else
[00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:10.460]   May take you a little while to figure it out. That's fine
[00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:13.900]   But at some point you got to know the answer to that
[00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:19.340]   spend if you spend all your time on that and you sit down with a cell phone and
[00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:24.460]   Recorded on your cell phone and don't worry about all the rest of the stuff. You'll be well served
[00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:29.060]   If you spend all your time investing in fancy gear and
[00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:34.840]   Buying all kinds of toys and then you sit around and Twitter your thumbs because someday I'm gonna record a show
[00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:38.540]   But you don't know when that day is you've got a major problem
[00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:41.220]   Don't do that
[00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:46.540]   Back to the microphone question. So Matthew I use a Heil PR 40 and
[00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:51.460]   The key for you to know is not to use necessarily the Heil PR 40
[00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:56.660]   But rather to use a type of microphone that's called a dynamic microphone
[00:27:56.660 --> 00:28:00.080]   There are two major types of microphones as I understand
[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:05.980]   One is called a dynamic microphone. One is called a condenser microphone
[00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:10.020]   Now, I'm not a techno geek and I haven't bothered to do spend too much time
[00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:13.980]   Understanding the difference here, but here's how I in my layman
[00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:16.700]   Vision
[00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:21.700]   understand the difference to be the dynamic microphone doesn't pick up so much noise in the room and
[00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:24.780]   The condenser microphone picks up a lot of noise in the room
[00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:29.060]   Now the dynamic microphone is far less sensitive
[00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:31.180]   To faraway noise
[00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:31.940]   so for example
[00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:38.020]   If I'm speaking to you like this and you'll notice if I start to back away from the microphone the actual sound quality will drop off
[00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:39.940]   Substantially when I do that
[00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:41.940]   There's a massive difference
[00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:45.420]   So the dynamic microphone I need is only good for recording
[00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:48.900]   Sounds that are specifically directly spoken into it
[00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:53.640]   And you have to be very careful and very precise if I even turn my head just a little tiny bit
[00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:56.180]   All I'm doing is swiveling my head here. You'll hear the difference in
[00:28:56.180 --> 00:28:58.820]   the recording quality
[00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:02.220]   The condenser microphone is very useful for many things
[00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:06.860]   But the thing I don't like about it is you need to have and it may even be better quality
[00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:08.540]   I don't know you have to ask the audio nerds
[00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:12.500]   But what I don't like about it is you have to have basically a sound booth and I don't have a sound booth
[00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:19.620]   The room that I record my show in is probably the worst acoustic room that exists. I have a
[00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:22.780]   Hard table in front of me. I have a hard
[00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:27.700]   Monitors right behind my microphone. I don't have a single thing on the walls
[00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:33.020]   The room is a tile floor without even a rug on it. It's got a ceiling
[00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:39.900]   That's drywall drywalled walls with no nothing soft. There's basically nothing in here that has any kind of sound quality
[00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:42.860]   but because I use a dynamic microphone and
[00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:50.260]   I speak right into it and I can turn the gain down a little bit because I have a voice that I'm able to project
[00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:56.620]   Then I don't pick up so much of that room noise. That would be very different if I were recording into a condenser microphone
[00:29:56.620 --> 00:30:01.300]   So that's the first thing that you want to look for. There are many types of dynamic microphones
[00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:04.080]   This microphone is certainly an excellent microphone
[00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:07.500]   It's an extremely high quality broadcast microphone. I think it was
[00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:14.340]   $350 or something like that. You don't need one the best entry-level microphone. That is a dynamic microphone
[00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:20.520]   That's much loved and I have one as well is called a an audio technica
[00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:22.840]   ATR
[00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:24.700]   2100
[00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:30.340]   Audio technica ATR 2100. That's basically what every podcaster tells every other podcaster to start with
[00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:33.860]   I think it's 40 bucks 50 bucks something like that. It's a great microphone
[00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:40.500]   it is unique because it has an a USB connection so you can plug it directly into your computer and
[00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:45.580]   It also has what's called an XLR connection and that's the traditional
[00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:49.540]   Connection that is used on sound equipment with a three-prong
[00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:54.780]   Connector and it's an excellent microphone. I have one that I've used
[00:30:54.780 --> 00:30:57.140]   So for example the show that my wife and I did together
[00:30:57.140 --> 00:31:04.340]   I used that microphone for her and this microphone for me. I bought the audio technica ATR 2100
[00:31:04.340 --> 00:31:06.340]   And by the way, there's another one called an AT
[00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:13.900]   2005 audio technica AT 2005. That's the one that I have there to save the same guts inside the microphone, but they have a different
[00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:16.180]   They have a different
[00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:19.860]   Body, there are different colors. I don't know what else is different with them, but they have the same guts
[00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:23.780]   They sound the same but I bought that so that I could record into my phone
[00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:30.440]   Because it's a USB microphone because it's a dynamic microphone. I can plug it through the use of a USB adapter
[00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:36.380]   I can plug it right into the bottom of my iPhone and I can record a show directly into my iPhone
[00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:40.460]   That's really really useful. That is what if I were going to start over today
[00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:43.340]   knowing what I now know I
[00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:45.540]   Wouldn't buy this mixer that I have
[00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:51.740]   What I would do in order to save money is I would just simply buy an application for iTunes called boss jock
[00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:57.420]   It's about 10 bucks goes right under your iPhone. I would buy the audio technica ATR 2100 and
[00:31:57.420 --> 00:32:02.660]   I would record directly into it the key about that app
[00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:08.980]   Is that you are able to play the microphone and your sound effects right over one another?
[00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:11.560]   So the same thing that I can do what you hear me do
[00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:13.060]   Let me not blast your ears out here
[00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:17.400]   But when you hear me kind of bring the music down so I can talk over and then bring it up
[00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:24.060]   And I can pull it down and talk over it which for a long time I was having issues which I won't even go into
[00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:30.540]   It's a lot of the early shows. I was the audio the music was too loud over the voice. That was because of the
[00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:35.220]   Post processing application I was using and I finally found a solution for that
[00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:39.220]   But that ability you can do that directly on just this iPhone app
[00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:40.900]   so
[00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:44.920]   Now one of my goals has been to be able to record shows on the road
[00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:47.820]   And now if I were going on the road, that's exactly what I'll do
[00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:54.980]   So at some point in time, I'll be recording a podcast from Zimbabwe and I'll be sitting out in front of a mud hut
[00:32:54.980 --> 00:33:00.500]   I have a microphone on in my hand. I'll be recording to my iPhone and then I'll upload it from an internet cafe and
[00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:02.340]   that's
[00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:04.340]   certainly doable in today's world, I
[00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:06.580]   think that
[00:33:06.580 --> 00:33:11.700]   If I were to do this over again, if I knew that that mic existed it what didn't exist when I bought my equipment
[00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:14.140]   I don't think it did or at least I didn't find out about it
[00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:21.000]   I probably would never have switched to this big fancy microphone because I don't find that for my style of content
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:27.780]   I'm not relying on my deep bass voice booming at you so that you feel
[00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:33.260]   Intensely about my show. I'm just relying on the audio being clear
[00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:37.020]   And I probably would still just be using that $50 microphone and it would be doing a great job
[00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:42.140]   But the key I find look for a dynamic microphone instead of a condenser microphone
[00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:45.500]   If you have a condenser microphone, go ahead and use it
[00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:51.740]   What you want to do is you want to create however some kind of sound booth type of environment go on YouTube
[00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:55.960]   You can find some tutorials on this you want to create some kind of cardboard box with a bunch of padding in it
[00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:59.340]   if you're using your cell phone as an example, if you were to take your
[00:33:59.340 --> 00:34:02.780]   Smartphone and you were to go into the middle of your closet
[00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:08.140]   amidst all of your clothes sit on the floor with your back tucked up into the
[00:34:08.660 --> 00:34:13.100]   Into the clothes and get the clothes in front of you and basically sit in the middle of your clothes and hold your iPhone
[00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:19.900]   About six inches in front of your face and just speak into it. You would be able to record excellent audio quality
[00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:24.340]   So if you have a cheap microphone or if you have
[00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:28.700]   Something that's just basic you'll need to make up for it with terms of soundproofing
[00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:35.660]   The advantage to this fancy microphone that I have is the fact that I just described to you. I have no soundproofing whatsoever. I
[00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:41.940]   Have essentially the worst environment you could possibly create for recording. Why don't I do something about it?
[00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:46.140]   Well, I'm in kind of a temporary bedroom right now. I think the audio is perfectly clear
[00:34:46.140 --> 00:34:50.980]   It's good enough. And if I switch to something else, maybe I will go ahead and try to make it better
[00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:54.940]   But for now, I haven't there's no easy way for me to make the room acoustically
[00:34:54.940 --> 00:34:59.460]   Perfect, and I haven't needed to spend the money or the time doing it. This is good enough. I
[00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:04.540]   Now own the other thing I would say and I said I wouldn't buy this microphone again
[00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:11.540]   I now own two other fancy dynamic microphones called a sure was sure SM7 and
[00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:15.740]   These are some massive microphones, but they're also dynamic microphones
[00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:19.820]   I bought them so that I could do in-person interviews at conferences and
[00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:24.740]   That's gonna be a big part of my show going forward is doing a lot more interviews out and about
[00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:27.100]   one of the keys
[00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:30.340]   I'm able to do a lot of interviews through Skype which works well
[00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:34.220]   and what I do there is I do what's called a mix - and
[00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:37.380]   Go find if you're interested go just do it
[00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:43.200]   You know duck that do a duck that go search and find some shows and they'll there's lots of tutorials out there on that
[00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:44.100]   But that's what I do
[00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:48.880]   I have my computer going into a soundboard and it coming back out so I can record things off of Skype
[00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:50.700]   but the problem is
[00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:55.140]   That a lot of the content that's created that way is people who are used to using Skype
[00:35:55.380 --> 00:36:00.980]   That's why in the podcast space basically the same 10 podcasters interview the same 10 guests over and over again
[00:36:00.980 --> 00:36:04.420]   well, I want to get in more interesting people so I invested in a
[00:36:04.420 --> 00:36:07.100]   professional quality studio quality
[00:36:07.100 --> 00:36:13.820]   Mobile podcasting interview setup and I can take this into somebody's office set it up in a few minutes
[00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:18.720]   It's in a little travel bag or I can take this to a conference and I can record all the audio directly
[00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:23.420]   While we're having a face-to-face interview now that I have those microphones
[00:36:23.420 --> 00:36:29.220]   I haven't chosen to go ahead and sell this one that I use every day and my only reason is because it's convenient to
[00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:33.140]   Have that as a kit and still be able to sit here and have this one on my desk every day
[00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:34.780]   But if I were gonna do it over again
[00:36:34.780 --> 00:36:38.840]   I would go ahead and and I wanted to spend money and get an expensive microphone
[00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:41.660]   I would go ahead and get the Shure SM7 and
[00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:47.700]   The reason why that one's more useful for interviews is because you don't have to be so disciplined
[00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:52.320]   With the position of your face compared to the position of the microphone
[00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:54.780]   Microphone discipline is a big deal
[00:36:54.780 --> 00:37:00.020]   I've tried to study and learn and and become more professional with regard to some of my techniques and
[00:37:00.020 --> 00:37:02.660]   Microphone technique is a big deal
[00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:08.060]   It's a good way to get better and as I was demonstrating earlier this tendency that if I talk like this
[00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:14.580]   I'm just moving about three inches here this tendency. You can hear the difference dramatically in your in your
[00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:17.300]   Headphones or in your car wherever you're listening
[00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:23.620]   I'm used to being disciplined and staying right in front of the microphone keeping my mouth very consistently positioned
[00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:28.580]   But when interviewing guests at a conference or in their office, they're not
[00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:31.220]   Most people are intimidated by microphones
[00:37:31.220 --> 00:37:37.860]   So they tend to back away from them. They tend to run away from them and
[00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:44.620]   the Shure SM7 the key reason why I spent a lot of money to get to get it is
[00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:48.620]   That it's very forgiving for a guest
[00:37:48.620 --> 00:37:51.700]   It has a much larger cone of sound around it
[00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:57.180]   Where instead of me turning my head for two inches and all of a sudden the the audio drops off
[00:37:57.180 --> 00:38:04.500]   With that microphone the guest can move around within a sphere of about five to seven inches and the audio doesn't really drop off
[00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:07.500]   But because the micro it's a dynamic microphone
[00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:15.340]   It does a good job of excluding some of the background noise that can be so strong with a condenser microphone
[00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:17.340]   So it's a really ideal setup for
[00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:20.820]   interviews in places without any sound
[00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:28.140]   enhancing material at conferences things like that and that's something that I'm going to be doing a lot more of going forward and
[00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:31.300]   It's a big part of my plan for this show
[00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:39.420]   With regard to my content, I'd love to produce a lot more deeper level content with fewer people that are often aren't interviewed
[00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:40.020]   You know
[00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:43.740]   I'd love to talk to Bill Sharp and fly up to Chicago and I think he still lives there
[00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:46.340]   wherever he lives and sit down with him for a few hours and
[00:38:46.340 --> 00:38:53.580]   Record kind of an in-depth interview rather than the more cursory 60-minute interview that is more common
[00:38:53.580 --> 00:38:57.260]   So I needed the equipment to be able to do that and to do it in a professional way
[00:38:57.260 --> 00:39:04.280]   Once I can get the revenue of the show a little bit higher to be able to justify that type of approach
[00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:09.700]   I'll do that at the moment the revenue the show isn't enough to where I can justify
[00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:15.240]   taking the time to prepare for that type of interview and/or to go and actually
[00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:19.320]   Do the expense of flying up there and making those things happen?
[00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:27.120]   So we'll see that's one of the plans. So that's enough of a discussion on microphones. Look for the audio technica ATR 2100
[00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:33.000]   I've gone through a few different things and don't worry too much about the microphone quality. It's at first
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:39.540]   but once you're sure of what you're doing, then go ahead and invest in quality and
[00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:46.140]   There are listeners like me who will listen to a poorly produced show if the content is good enough
[00:39:46.140 --> 00:39:49.100]   But that's changing and there are many people who won't put up with it
[00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:57.220]   So you need to have a high quality show and a high quality audio and it's worth investing in because the choices today
[00:39:57.220 --> 00:39:59.100]   It's a much more competitive environment
[00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:06.200]   There are many better choices that exist today than even six months ago, and it's only gonna get more and more competitive
[00:40:06.940 --> 00:40:13.060]   If your content is good enough, for example, go look at John T Reed site. It's from like 1992
[00:40:13.060 --> 00:40:18.340]   But he doesn't change it and it works and he makes a lot of money off of it and his content is good
[00:40:18.340 --> 00:40:25.260]   There are lots of financial bloggers who have very beautiful sites and who can't break Alexa 1 million
[00:40:25.260 --> 00:40:29.620]   So if your content is good enough, you can overcome just about anything
[00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:34.420]   But you do want to go ahead and do everything you can to put your best foot forward
[00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:42.860]   Talk a little bit about Trey's question here with regard to some of the mistakes that I made and the hosting situation
[00:40:42.860 --> 00:40:46.180]   Trey's referring to my upsetness with
[00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:50.060]   Using and going with a hosting provider called Bluehost. I
[00:40:50.060 --> 00:40:55.080]   Don't think there's anything wrong with Bluehost and I didn't have a very bad experience there
[00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:59.220]   What I didn't understand was their poor reputation among the techies
[00:41:00.020 --> 00:41:05.800]   I'm a big kind of take action guy. And so I reached to the point I said, okay, I need to take action quickly
[00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:09.440]   And so that was where I just said well, okay, I'll go ahead and use this Bluehost
[00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:17.960]   This is what this person is recommending and what I wish they had done was simply said if you want a cheap solution for your site
[00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:21.080]   Here's Bluehost if you want a good solution for your site
[00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:27.040]   Here's this other provider the provider that I switched to is a provider called WP Engine
[00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:33.980]   It's a well-provided. I think WP probably has to do with WordPress, but it's with WP Engine. It's a it's a much more robust
[00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:40.180]   More expensive but much more robust shared hosting platform without getting into the technical
[00:41:40.180 --> 00:41:41.940]   lingo
[00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:44.100]   Well to get into the technical lingo
[00:41:44.100 --> 00:41:51.440]   when you start off having a website you usually start off the most cost-effective approach is something called shared hosting and
[00:41:52.940 --> 00:41:57.760]   Shared hosting it costs almost nothing. You've got tons of people on a single server and that's where your site is held
[00:41:57.760 --> 00:42:05.040]   The problem is if you're if you all of a sudden get a lot of traffic your site will not it's not gonna work
[00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:07.320]   now depending on your host provider
[00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:09.720]   you may
[00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:14.800]   Be helped or you may not be and so what happens is some the mainstream
[00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:18.840]   Hosting services. The big one is Bluehost and Hostgator
[00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:22.540]   They're owned by the same company and they have another couple names for their stuff, but they're the same company
[00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:29.440]   but they put tons and tons of sites on the servers because most sites get not very many visits and
[00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:34.280]   even my site doesn't get very many visits to the actual site because the majority of you are
[00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:37.140]   Simply listening to the show and you never come to the site
[00:42:37.140 --> 00:42:45.140]   but if your site starts to get some traffic it can be quickly shut down and what they will do is because
[00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:52.460]   Each site affects the other sites on the server if all of a sudden your show or your site hits the front page of Yahoo!
[00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:57.160]   Finance they'll shut your site down so that not all the other sites on the server will get shut down
[00:42:57.160 --> 00:42:59.540]   That's a real problem
[00:42:59.540 --> 00:43:00.860]   so
[00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:06.280]   It was fine for a while, but I I'm very uncomfortable with that. So WP Engine has a much more robust
[00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:10.680]   System much better technology behind it. It's more expensive
[00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:15.140]   you went from four bucks a month to I'm hosting multiple sites now and
[00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:17.720]   splitting
[00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:21.280]   Splitting the fees it comes out to $100 a month. You're gonna have multiple sites
[00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:24.840]   mine, I split that plan with a
[00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:29.800]   Friend and it's 50 bucks a month out of my pocket to host the multiple sites that I'm hosting
[00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:34.720]   So we've worked that out and it and it works. Well, it can host up to 10 sites. I think on $100 a month
[00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:40.560]   It's a much more robust system. That's what I've switched to at this point. I don't necessarily think that it is
[00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:50.500]   Necessary that you spend more money in the beginning the difference between the equivalent of $5 a month with Bluehost versus
[00:43:50.500 --> 00:43:52.740]   10 or
[00:43:52.740 --> 00:43:54.740]   $20 a month is substantial
[00:43:54.740 --> 00:44:01.300]   So it's good to save the money. That's what I wish those people had done. I'm actually in the process of in the coming days
[00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:05.320]   I'm gonna be setting up some affiliate links and I'm also gonna one of those things
[00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:09.580]   I'm gonna do is go ahead and set up an affiliate relationship with WP Engine because they have been excellent
[00:44:09.580 --> 00:44:12.340]   They're a good middle tier
[00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:15.980]   Solution now if your site grows at some point in time
[00:44:15.980 --> 00:44:19.940]   You got to get away from shared hosting and you get into I think they call it the virtual private server
[00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:24.420]   and then if you need to grow out if you outgrow that they need to go and basically set up your own server and
[00:44:24.420 --> 00:44:27.900]   Who knows maybe the show at some point will get to that level
[00:44:27.900 --> 00:44:33.320]   The major problem that I faced with the show was I followed most of the podcasting
[00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:41.560]   Tutorials that were out there and if you're starting podcasting you'll see them and the challenge is that I set up my site
[00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:46.560]   following the podcasting tutorials and most of the podcasting tutorials use
[00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:50.360]   Use a
[00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:53.640]   Way of setting up the feed and trying not to be too technical here
[00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:59.700]   But I'm but technical enough a way to set up the feed which is what all of you access on your device
[00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:02.280]   They deliver it through
[00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:07.960]   your server they set it up on WordPress and they deliver it through your server and
[00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:13.840]   So what happens is that you've got loads and loads of people and with the size of my files
[00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:17.080]   with the frequency of my shows and
[00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:24.560]   with the number of people downloading my shows that puts a ton of pressure on to
[00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:26.640]   the
[00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:28.160]   hosting system
[00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:30.160]   And that's a real problem
[00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:34.440]   Now I don't I'm not a techie enough to go any farther than that
[00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:37.720]   But I started to have some issues and this is what was causing it
[00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:42.960]   So what I did was I switched my hosting solution. I think this is what was causing it
[00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:48.920]   It's fuzzy at this point and maybe the podcast techies could let me know but I switched my solution
[00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:53.800]   My feed from being hosted and coming through WordPress into your device
[00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:59.880]   To being hosted directly with the company with which I host my audio files, which is a company called Libsyn
[00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:06.040]   There are various competitors to host your audio files and there are many more today than there have been in the past
[00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:08.920]   SoundCloud there's
[00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:12.760]   Libsyn there's a blueberry there's
[00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:16.400]   Spreaker there's maybe put stuff directly on YouTube
[00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:21.000]   There's a lot of different solutions out there, but Libsyn is excellent and they have done an excellent job
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:26.960]   They have a long history and I think they actually have a business model. I'm concerned about some of the
[00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:32.440]   Companies that are offering hosting at this point and some of the rates that they're doing it for because even though it's cheaper
[00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:35.200]   I'm concerned that they're not going to be able to stay in the business
[00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:39.320]   Libsyn has been awesome to work with and they have a very
[00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:42.960]   affordable and reasonable and value filled
[00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:47.640]   Plan and so in fact, I need to I need to go set up a Libsyn affiliate host
[00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:49.440]   So I'm gonna put a page on the show
[00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:55.800]   The next few days with recommendations and I would be thrilled if you guys would use some of my affiliate links to help increase the revenue
[00:46:55.800 --> 00:47:00.620]   Of the show but Libsyn has done a great job. And so now my feed goes directly with Libsyn
[00:47:00.620 --> 00:47:06.720]   So your device your iPhone your Android phone your Windows phone your computer iTunes, whatever
[00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:12.620]   they're pulling you're pulling the feed the XML feed for the RSS feed from
[00:47:12.620 --> 00:47:18.180]   Libsyn and it's not connected to my site and that gives me an extra layer of protection
[00:47:18.180 --> 00:47:22.440]   Whereas if my site goes down it doesn't mess up the feed
[00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:26.400]   So your devices will still work and for as a podcaster, especially as a podcast
[00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:30.780]   Primary podcast primary content. That's a big deal
[00:47:30.780 --> 00:47:36.900]   So I've got Libsyn taking care of my podcasting feed and the site is separate. I
[00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:39.700]   Wish I had done it that way from the beginning
[00:47:39.700 --> 00:47:42.480]   That would have saved me a lot now
[00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:44.100]   Most of you have made it back to the show
[00:47:44.100 --> 00:47:50.060]   But that was a real kick in the stomach to delete your entire audience when you're four months into the show right before you launch
[00:47:50.060 --> 00:47:51.760]   your membership program
[00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:58.860]   That wasn't and like I said, I'm still about to make some changes in the next few days. That is going to affect some of you
[00:47:58.860 --> 00:48:03.540]   Still recovering from that because what's happened is the old feed
[00:48:03.540 --> 00:48:10.160]   Directions are scattered around the internet in different directories. Some of you will listen to me on one directory
[00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:12.540]   some of you find me on a different directory and
[00:48:12.540 --> 00:48:18.560]   So those feeds are kind of still sprinkled out there. And so I still haven't fully recovered from that
[00:48:19.540 --> 00:48:25.300]   But Trey if you're gonna start off with blogging, I don't think there's anything wrong with Bluehost or the other cheap ones
[00:48:25.300 --> 00:48:30.500]   because chances are your site is probably not going to be that big that fast and
[00:48:30.500 --> 00:48:37.680]   if it takes you a few years of blogging and you've got five dollars a month versus twenty five dollars a month, then
[00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:40.740]   Well, it's probably gonna be okay
[00:48:40.740 --> 00:48:44.040]   You were probably better off saving your twenty dollars a month
[00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:48.140]   After all I would quickly run calculations. I look at all this money that you can save
[00:48:48.900 --> 00:48:54.020]   For me, I can't take that chance because I'm putting a lot of pressure on this as a primary business
[00:48:54.020 --> 00:49:00.180]   Then as a business I have a much heavier incentive to invest in
[00:49:00.180 --> 00:49:06.740]   High quality solutions and if you want the robustness then you can then you can do that
[00:49:06.740 --> 00:49:09.820]   I think there are some other niche providers out there
[00:49:09.820 --> 00:49:15.620]   I have thought about even going ahead and as I've been thinking through what are the companies and and
[00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:18.820]   Services that I can recommend
[00:49:18.820 --> 00:49:25.180]   Frankly and happily with affiliate relationships. I've seriously considered even recommending Bluehost
[00:49:25.180 --> 00:49:29.860]   But I need to do a little bit more because I had a fine experience. It was easy
[00:49:29.860 --> 00:49:33.780]   They have everything really integrated and they do a good job and and it was it's easy
[00:49:33.780 --> 00:49:41.120]   But I'm gonna do a little bit more research with my techie friends and just see if there's a comparably priced version
[00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:44.460]   crumpler comparably priced solution
[00:49:45.540 --> 00:49:47.540]   That might be better. I think for most people
[00:49:47.540 --> 00:49:55.420]   I've I think actually Squarespace is a better solution than even WordPress because I've had to learn a lot about WordPress
[00:49:55.420 --> 00:49:59.340]   But it's tough. And so I think some of these other solutions that are out there
[00:49:59.340 --> 00:50:06.940]   Squarespace Wix some of these other ones were are a better solution where they're all in one like I'm a big fan now
[00:50:06.940 --> 00:50:12.320]   Squarespace I didn't understand it enough in the past, but now I understand it enough to be a big fan
[00:50:12.620 --> 00:50:17.460]   So it's not the end. It's not kind of the biggest one of WordPress, but I'll go into that later
[00:50:17.460 --> 00:50:21.740]   I'm gonna see if I want to reach out to them and see if actually they want to advertise because I think
[00:50:21.740 --> 00:50:27.380]   When I get back to the fact that every single one of you and me we all need a website for ourselves
[00:50:27.380 --> 00:50:34.900]   And I think that the Squarespace value proposition is in many ways stronger than the normal Bluehost WordPress
[00:50:34.900 --> 00:50:38.080]   Solution and you don't have to be quite such the technical expert
[00:50:38.080 --> 00:50:41.780]   We'll cover that another day last couple of lessons here is
[00:50:42.460 --> 00:50:49.780]   One of the biggest things that I would encourage if you're thinking about starting a show is to recognize that podcasting is not
[00:50:49.780 --> 00:50:52.620]   blogging
[00:50:52.620 --> 00:50:56.680]   This one was tough for me to learn it still still affects me I
[00:50:56.680 --> 00:51:03.060]   Spent so much time reading blogs and I thought well, I'll just take this to an audio format
[00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:09.220]   but the type of content that is conveyed well and easily in
[00:51:10.340 --> 00:51:14.780]   Blogs is not necessarily conveyed well and easily in podcasting
[00:51:14.780 --> 00:51:18.900]   You can make a blog post. It's interesting and that goes viral
[00:51:18.900 --> 00:51:26.260]   Off of something that is relatively small and insignificant, but if I got in here and said I'm gonna record this as an audio
[00:51:26.260 --> 00:51:29.580]   Podcast it usually doesn't work
[00:51:29.580 --> 00:51:33.380]   For what it's very different
[00:51:33.380 --> 00:51:35.660]   so
[00:51:35.660 --> 00:51:37.660]   Blogging has its place
[00:51:37.860 --> 00:51:43.580]   But blogging is not podcasting. So consider approaching podcasting as its own unique art form
[00:51:43.580 --> 00:51:46.780]   That's the reason why I have not
[00:51:46.780 --> 00:51:49.700]   Really written any blog posts on the site
[00:51:49.700 --> 00:51:54.620]   Because I'm focusing on trying to learn how to more effectively create
[00:51:54.620 --> 00:51:57.540]   podcasts
[00:51:57.540 --> 00:52:01.200]   Podcasts are unique. They're also not radio. That's the other challenge
[00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:04.700]   They're kind of they're also not speeches
[00:52:05.860 --> 00:52:10.060]   They're not videos. They're pot. It's it's a different animal
[00:52:10.060 --> 00:52:15.380]   Radio is broken up by in general broken up by commercial
[00:52:15.380 --> 00:52:22.060]   Interruptions usually about 15 minutes is longest segment some of their segments are four minutes and because of those commercial interact interruptions
[00:52:22.060 --> 00:52:27.020]   If you actually listen to a radio show with all of the interviews cut out or the commercials cut out
[00:52:27.020 --> 00:52:31.620]   you'll have a very different listening experience than a
[00:52:31.620 --> 00:52:34.700]   podcast
[00:52:35.660 --> 00:52:36.940]   So
[00:52:36.940 --> 00:52:43.140]   It's not that it's bad or good or anything. I just encourage you don't make the mistake I did which was try to say
[00:52:43.140 --> 00:52:45.940]   Okay, here's an idea. That's perfect for a blog
[00:52:45.940 --> 00:52:51.540]   That's short and focused and then try to turn it into a podcast. It's a different format
[00:52:51.540 --> 00:52:56.340]   another thing that I will just mention as far as a lesson is
[00:52:59.260 --> 00:53:04.940]   Interviews interviews are tough. This has been the toughest thing that I struggled with have struggled with and still I'm
[00:53:04.940 --> 00:53:10.380]   grappling with is how to do an excellent interview and the mistake that I made many times was
[00:53:10.380 --> 00:53:18.420]   Primarily interviewing authors and I've gone back and forth trying to figure out what's the best way to interview an author
[00:53:18.420 --> 00:53:24.820]   My normal tendency is to research everything that I can about somebody
[00:53:25.940 --> 00:53:32.620]   Read everything they've written and then try to prepare a specific outline of what I want to take them through
[00:53:32.620 --> 00:53:34.740]   This is backfired a number of times
[00:53:34.740 --> 00:53:39.540]   there were some authors that I've interviewed on the show that I really was excited to talk to and
[00:53:39.540 --> 00:53:43.740]   yet what I realized was I was trying to take them through their book and
[00:53:43.740 --> 00:53:50.080]   They didn't want to go through a book because after all they wrote a book and if you want the book go read the book
[00:53:50.080 --> 00:53:52.660]   they just wanted to talk and
[00:53:52.740 --> 00:54:00.420]   They're kind of wandering here and wandering there in a story and I couldn't get him back to say look talk about your book
[00:54:00.420 --> 00:54:08.140]   Here's the outline look I prepared these ten points and how do you lead an author without just delivering it and
[00:54:08.140 --> 00:54:11.660]   So I learned that that
[00:54:11.660 --> 00:54:13.380]   excessive
[00:54:13.380 --> 00:54:19.660]   Research excessive reading thing at least right before the interview isn't necessarily a good plan
[00:54:20.460 --> 00:54:25.300]   so I switched and I started trying to just follow my curiosity and
[00:54:25.300 --> 00:54:28.780]   Trying actually not to prepare too much in advance
[00:54:28.780 --> 00:54:34.260]   but to have a general idea of who somebody is and then follow my curiosity a little bit and
[00:54:34.260 --> 00:54:42.340]   That's also very intimidating very challenging because then you arrive with a few ideas of ways that you're gonna go down
[00:54:42.340 --> 00:54:45.180]   paths of
[00:54:45.180 --> 00:54:47.180]   questioning that you can pursue
[00:54:48.820 --> 00:54:52.340]   But you're not quite sure and sometimes you're sitting there saying
[00:54:52.340 --> 00:54:55.020]   Okay, what do I ask next?
[00:54:55.020 --> 00:54:57.380]   so if you are
[00:54:57.380 --> 00:54:59.180]   going to
[00:54:59.180 --> 00:55:03.780]   Create interviews and do an interview show. I think that's a good idea
[00:55:03.780 --> 00:55:07.300]   In some ways the interviews are easy because he just asked questions
[00:55:07.300 --> 00:55:11.280]   It's much more difficult to come up with an outline for a 60-minute show
[00:55:11.280 --> 00:55:16.740]   That has a lot of depth and a lot of breadth and moves with an appropriate pacing
[00:55:17.660 --> 00:55:20.660]   it's more difficult sometimes to do that than it is to
[00:55:20.660 --> 00:55:25.380]   Do an interview but interviews in and of themselves are tough
[00:55:25.380 --> 00:55:33.740]   At the moment I tend to be more in favor of the follow my curiosity approach. It seems to be producing
[00:55:33.740 --> 00:55:36.260]   better results
[00:55:36.260 --> 00:55:38.660]   It's not a hundred percent
[00:55:38.660 --> 00:55:41.100]   Follow my curiosity
[00:55:41.100 --> 00:55:42.420]   I've been
[00:55:42.420 --> 00:55:48.180]   Having an idea of where I think we need to go because after all it's my responsibility as a podcast host to bring my audience
[00:55:48.180 --> 00:55:50.180]   Something that's useful
[00:55:50.180 --> 00:55:56.860]   but the approach of following my gut has been I think producing more interesting content and
[00:55:56.860 --> 00:55:59.500]   it has helped me to
[00:55:59.500 --> 00:56:06.940]   More effectively reign in somebody when they go off on a tangent or to just redirect the conversation a little bit
[00:56:06.940 --> 00:56:08.900]   so I've been learning and
[00:56:08.900 --> 00:56:10.380]   I hope that
[00:56:10.380 --> 00:56:13.220]   Many of you are able to hear that growth
[00:56:13.220 --> 00:56:17.300]   Which brings me to my final point and with this I'm done for today
[00:56:17.300 --> 00:56:26.740]   I've intentionally put everything out there with my show as far as leaving all of the old episodes and leaving the ones that
[00:56:26.740 --> 00:56:35.900]   Went crazy and did crazy tangents and crazy long and all of that because it's my goal to both teach
[00:56:36.020 --> 00:56:40.460]   The content and the ideas and the knowledge that I have that's specific
[00:56:40.460 --> 00:56:46.620]   But also to model my implementation of those things in a free and candid way
[00:56:46.620 --> 00:56:53.020]   If you've ever thought about creating independent media, please do
[00:56:53.020 --> 00:56:57.220]   And don't worry about being perfect but start
[00:56:57.220 --> 00:57:01.500]   Because you're the one who will gain the most from it. I
[00:57:01.500 --> 00:57:05.300]   Have gained the most from this show
[00:57:06.300 --> 00:57:09.580]   And I will continue to gain the most from this show
[00:57:09.580 --> 00:57:12.700]   and
[00:57:12.700 --> 00:57:18.140]   If you start creating media of some kind any kind you'll gain the most
[00:57:18.140 --> 00:57:22.980]   We live in one of the most incredible times in human history
[00:57:22.980 --> 00:57:29.140]   Especially from the perspective of free and open communication
[00:57:29.140 --> 00:57:33.740]   We can break down some of the walls that have existed for so long
[00:57:34.060 --> 00:57:36.060]   It's
[00:57:36.060 --> 00:57:38.300]   Not easy to do
[00:57:38.300 --> 00:57:43.380]   But we can do it and I would encourage you to try
[00:57:43.380 --> 00:57:49.140]   As long as you're not worried too much about the number of people listening
[00:57:49.140 --> 00:57:57.220]   Then you can have a successful experiment a successful podcast if it helps one person
[00:57:58.420 --> 00:58:04.100]   As far as I'm concerned my show has already been a roaring success because I've gotten an email
[00:58:04.100 --> 00:58:09.780]   From somebody saying Joshua. My life has been impacted now. I've been fortunate to get many more than one and
[00:58:09.780 --> 00:58:12.660]   That is the most heartwarming thing
[00:58:12.660 --> 00:58:21.780]   Had some former clients of mine over for dinner last night. We were talking and this was a client a couple that
[00:58:23.020 --> 00:58:28.540]   made tremendous changes in their life after our financial planning engagements and
[00:58:28.540 --> 00:58:36.980]   This couple was incredibly important to me as a young financial planner because I was so insecure starting off as a planner
[00:58:36.980 --> 00:58:39.060]   I've never even looked tell people what I did
[00:58:39.060 --> 00:58:42.340]   But then I started working with them and they would take me to you know
[00:58:42.340 --> 00:58:46.500]   They would want to a birthday invite me to birthday party and they would tell him this is Joshua sheets
[00:58:46.500 --> 00:58:51.980]   Like you've got to talk with Joshua sheets. Like he's he's awesome. He's our financial advisor. I didn't know what to do with it
[00:58:52.460 --> 00:58:56.900]   But the cool thing was just experiencing the impact that had really encouraged me
[00:58:56.900 --> 00:59:02.180]   And I was telling them that they were asking about how the show is going. I said the best thing about the show is that
[00:59:02.180 --> 00:59:10.420]   I've gotten the same response that I got from you from hundreds of people
[00:59:10.420 --> 00:59:14.820]   One is enough
[00:59:14.820 --> 00:59:16.980]   Two is awesome
[00:59:16.980 --> 00:59:18.820]   Dozens are gratifying
[00:59:18.820 --> 00:59:21.300]   And you get that from hundreds. It's worth doing
[00:59:22.020 --> 00:59:28.340]   One of the great benefits of independent media is we can model the growth factors
[00:59:28.340 --> 00:59:31.580]   We can leave the mistakes out there
[00:59:31.580 --> 00:59:36.740]   By the time you get to some big news anchor on TV, you never see the mistakes
[00:59:36.740 --> 00:59:39.900]   But the time you listen to Rush Limbaugh or whoever
[00:59:39.900 --> 00:59:43.860]   you know, I'm trying to think of who the the
[00:59:43.860 --> 00:59:48.340]   Counterpoint to him is on radio. I don't know. It seems like all the radio hosts are
[00:59:49.060 --> 00:59:54.140]   Right-wing hosts by the time you get to Rush Limbaugh. You've got someone that's been broadcasting for decades
[00:59:54.140 --> 00:59:58.700]   Decades
[00:59:58.700 --> 01:00:02.780]   But the cool thing is we can leave those mistakes out there to encourage other people
[01:00:02.780 --> 01:00:07.460]   And we can provide ideas and inspiration that are exactly where people need to be
[01:00:07.460 --> 01:00:13.140]   And when you're forced to sit down and write your ideas out in an outline and then deliver them
[01:00:13.140 --> 01:00:15.700]   You're forced to get clear on them
[01:00:16.780 --> 01:00:18.780]   When I have to do a show on
[01:00:18.780 --> 01:00:23.060]   What would I do if I won the lottery? I got to sit down and say what would I do if I won the lottery?
[01:00:23.060 --> 01:00:27.460]   How does it get any better than that because I
[01:00:27.460 --> 01:00:29.980]   Just wrote a show
[01:00:29.980 --> 01:00:34.260]   that was the result of my sitting down and saying well, what would I do and
[01:00:34.260 --> 01:00:38.660]   Then looking at my answers saying well, why do I really believe this?
[01:00:38.660 --> 01:00:41.300]   Do I really believe that?
[01:00:41.300 --> 01:00:43.660]   And that's the cool thing about
[01:00:43.740 --> 01:00:51.060]   Independent media you don't have to have a massive audience to have an impact. You don't have to be super popular now
[01:00:51.060 --> 01:00:55.780]   It's awesome. I'm working hard to get there. I'm doing everything I can but I'm doing it. I
[01:00:55.780 --> 01:01:00.820]   Don't want to sound too I don't have the wrong tone here
[01:01:00.820 --> 01:01:06.080]   It's it's really encouraging when the numbers start to grow and I'm thankful for every one of you that listens
[01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:08.660]   but I
[01:01:08.940 --> 01:01:14.600]   Just hate seeing people do things and then only focusing on the numbers do something because you think it matters
[01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:19.580]   Do something because you think it should be done do something because nobody's doing it
[01:01:19.580 --> 01:01:22.860]   And let the numbers shake themselves out
[01:01:22.860 --> 01:01:30.620]   The cool thing about voluntary content is your audience will self-select themselves
[01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:35.380]   No one's forcing them to listen no one's forcing them to read
[01:01:35.620 --> 01:01:42.540]   They will self-select and a lot of people come in they'll dip their toes in listen for a little bit and say yeah
[01:01:42.540 --> 01:01:45.380]   Not for me and you got to be okay with that
[01:01:45.380 --> 01:01:52.380]   but the ones who stick around will be an encouragement to you in the same way that so many of you have been to me and
[01:01:52.380 --> 01:01:56.020]   The benefits are massive
[01:01:56.020 --> 01:02:04.500]   So if you've ever thought about creating independent media of any kind figure out what's your likely best way to
[01:02:05.380 --> 01:02:06.860]   compete
[01:02:06.860 --> 01:02:08.860]   What you really want to do?
[01:02:08.860 --> 01:02:12.460]   Do you want to create video? Do you want to write? Do you want to speak and
[01:02:12.460 --> 01:02:16.540]   Do it because we need millions more people
[01:02:16.540 --> 01:02:19.860]   Doing this type of thing on millions more subjects
[01:02:19.860 --> 01:02:22.340]   It's just the beginning
[01:02:22.340 --> 01:02:24.420]   And if we get millions of people doing that
[01:02:24.420 --> 01:02:28.300]   Each person making a little change in their corner of the world
[01:02:28.300 --> 01:02:32.720]   The results are really gonna be amazing
[01:02:34.300 --> 01:02:39.660]   Hope this has been useful to you. I know there's no real financial planning tips in it. I guess there is a little bit
[01:02:39.660 --> 01:02:42.360]   I guess this one will go in under the increasing your income
[01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:44.860]   section because in today's world
[01:02:44.860 --> 01:02:50.660]   We all have to be our own marketers and in many ways and one key aspect of it is you need a website
[01:02:50.660 --> 01:02:52.460]   You need a site
[01:02:52.460 --> 01:02:58.500]   And you might need a podcast and if you do hopefully this will help you. I actually am say this earlier. I am going to
[01:02:58.500 --> 01:03:01.380]   create a
[01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:08.460]   Info product teaching financial advisors how to podcast and I'm gonna do it very specifically
[01:03:08.460 --> 01:03:11.700]   I'm gonna create a manual as far as all the technical stuff so that I can help people
[01:03:11.700 --> 01:03:14.580]   Avoid that but I read a real
[01:03:14.580 --> 01:03:19.860]   Heart to teach financial advisors how to podcast because I think every single financial advisor needs a podcast
[01:03:19.860 --> 01:03:24.400]   Not a podcast like mine not a podcast to try to get out five thousand
[01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:29.440]   You know listeners all of us cool if they can do that as many people have much bigger audiences to mine
[01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:31.700]   that's just I'm sharing my experience, but
[01:03:32.940 --> 01:03:38.300]   Financial advisors need a podcast so that their clients can get to know who they are in a non pressured situation
[01:03:38.300 --> 01:03:43.180]   I'm gonna create an info product teaching people how to do it. It'll probably start with a basic
