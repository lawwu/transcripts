[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.880]   If you could spend $50 billion on HubSpot
[00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.880]   or $5 billion on Perplexity, which one would you buy?
[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.320]   - I think you've got to buy HubSpot.
[00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.720]   You're protecting a quarter trillion dollar ad business.
[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.280]   HubSpot makes 2 billion in revenue.
[00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.120]   So it's 1% of the size of Google's ad business.
[00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.320]   And it helps you lock in some percentage
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.680]   of that 250 billion.
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.040]   So that's an important strategic acquisition,
[00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:20.880]   I think, for Google.
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.040]   - What does Google accomplish here
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.520]   that they couldn't do with an integration?
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:24.760]   - I think this is about the data.
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.320]   These are the leads and the great contacts
[00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.080]   in the database of the customer,
[00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.600]   which Google doesn't have access to,
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.840]   and they can close the loop.
[00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.040]   If Google knows the leads that are already in there,
[00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.840]   they can then retarget them across their entire ad network,
[00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.280]   which is the largest in the world.
[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.120]   That's the value.
[00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.160]   If I know your 10,000 best customers,
[00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.360]   and then I know when they're on Google searching,
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.920]   and I know when they're in a Chrome browser,
[00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.240]   I know when they're on an Android phone,
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.160]   if they happen to use that,
[00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.600]   man, I can just start getting more of your ad dollars
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.440]   into it.
