[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600]   [ Applause ]
[00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.200]   Also, remember the slides, if you're having trouble seeing them
[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.040]   or you just want them, they're downloadable.
[00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.740]   If you go to the Bogle Center website, you can click on the link
[00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:16.880]   and you can download all the slides for this presentation.
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:24.500]   All right, our next speaker, I have a page worth of introductory material on Wade.
[00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.340]   He has done so much, but I am not going to read it all to you.
[00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.420]   I'm going to give you a very brief summary.
[00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.820]   Wade has a PhD, he has a CFA, he's the founder of Retirement Researcher,
[00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.560]   which is an educational resource for individuals and financial advisors
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.960]   on topics related to retirement income planning.
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.340]   He holds a doctorate in economics from Princeton.
[00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.020]   He's published more than 60 research articles.
[00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:52.160]   He's a past selectee for many, many lists of important people.
[00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:58.000]   He has contributed to Forbes and Advisor Perspectives and for the Wall Street Journal.
[00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.720]   He's spoken at many national conferences, including the CFA Institute,
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.440]   the CFP Board, NAPFA, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.380]   He is a return speaker here at the Bogle Heads Conference.
[00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.380]   He's been here several times, and is also the author of four books
[00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.100]   in the Retirement Researcher's Guide series.
[00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.880]   Wade, thank you so much for being here, and we're going to enjoy your presentation.
[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:17.880]   >> Hey, thanks so much, Jim.
[00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.300]   [ Applause ]
[00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.040]   Thank you.
[00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.100]   It's great to be back at Bogle Heads, and for the next 25 minutes we're going to go
[00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.800]   on a rollercoaster ride, literally when you see what these tax maps look like.
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.080]   We're going to talk about tax-efficient retirement distributions.
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.240]   There is a lot of content, so I'll have the same challenge as the other speakers.
[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.600]   I don't know if I'll get through all these slides or not, but let's dive into it.
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.720]   This is a big deal, what we're talking about, just being smart
[00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.360]   about where you take distributions from can have a significant impact on portfolio longevity
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:54.180]   or framed a different way on the remaining legacy value of assets at the end of retirement.
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.180]   Why is that?
[00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.060]   It's because we're maneuvering in the United States a progressive tax system,
[00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.600]   not just the fact that income tax rates increase as you get to higher income levels,
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.600]   but there's a lot of other factors that we're going to be talking about.
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:13.660]   And so we want to strategize around paying taxes when we can do so at a lower rate in order
[00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.000]   to avoid having to pay taxes later at a higher rate.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.640]   The tax code is filled with a number of nonlinearities and traps that we have to deal with.
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.160]   The effective marginal tax rates on a dollar of income, the dollar of tax paid on the last dollar
[00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.060]   of income can be quite a bit higher than income tax rates, and we're not even getting
[00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.780]   into state income taxes, this is purely today going to be in terms of federal income taxes
[00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.100]   and all its related nonlinearities and traps.
[00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.760]   And there can be many different types of tax treatment
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.400]   in the tax code that need to be coordinated.
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.860]   So some of these nonlinearities that are relevant for what we're talking about here,
[00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.380]   many tax rules do connect to adjusted gross income, not taxable income.
[00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.220]   Itemized deductions only count when they're higher than the standard deduction.
[00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.620]   That's not relevant, I'm just going to be assuming the standard deduction
[00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:01.840]   for what I'm talking about today.
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.200]   But there are strategies around deduction bunching and that sort of thing as well.
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.320]   Preferential income sources, and this is an important point
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.320]   that if you haven't really thought about before, it's big.
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.840]   They stack on top of ordinary income.
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.240]   So you can easily get yourself into a situation where when you generate ordinary income,
[00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.520]   you're also pushing your long-term gains into a higher tax bracket at the same time.
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.580]   A dollar of income can trigger tax on Social Security benefits.
[00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:31.180]   A dollar of income can trigger higher Medicare premiums, and Mary Beth already introduced us
[00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.100]   to that concept earlier with those IRMA surcharges.
[00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.500]   A dollar of income can trigger the loss of subsidies if you're getting health insurance
[00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.320]   to an Affordable Care Act plan that is eligible.
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:47.620]   And then we have the 3.8% net investment tax as well on that investment income.
[00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.200]   And then the big one is that we're going to try to plan for, and what a lot of this is doing is trying
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.500]   to prepare in advance for the day that we're hit by required minimum distributions.
[00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.020]   They can force you to generate a lot of taxable income that you may not want,
[00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:05.020]   and that may cause all these nonlinearities to kick into effect
[00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.480]   so that you'll see what we're trying to avoid by planning ahead
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.660]   and getting those RMDs down before they begin.
[00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:15.400]   So simply we have total income, above the line deductions removed from that,
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.080]   give you adjusted gross income, below the line deductions or the standard deduction
[00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:24.320]   in this context will give you taxable income, and then I'm just showing this to now simplify.
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.800]   We're talking about different types of investment accounts, so taxable brokerage accounts,
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.920]   tax deferred accounts, which from now on I'll just call IRA to make it simpler,
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.840]   and then after tax or tax exempt accounts that I'll just simplify as a Roth IRA.
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.940]   So when I'm talking about all this tax planning, it's going to be your taxable account,
[00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.800]   your IRA, or your Roth IRA.
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.920]   Now, it could be much broader than that, but we only have 25 minutes to avoid, well,
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.940]   all these potential options, tax-efficient retirement distribution strategies.
[00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:56.480]   So the starting point, and it's not the worst thing you can do, it's reasonable,
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.100]   but we're going to show how we can do a lot better than this,
[00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.840]   but the conventional wisdom starting point for spending on assets
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.980]   in retirement is you spend on your taxable account first, then your tax-deferred accounts
[00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:10.960]   or your IRAs, and then your tax-exempt account you save for last, or your Roths.
[00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:14.180]   Now, that's a starting point that we're going to talk about doing better.
[00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.640]   Now, how can we do better?
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:20.500]   I'll be talking about this idea of effective marginal tax rate management.
[00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.200]   The idea is we're going to aim to fill up -- we're going to want to pay taxes.
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.060]   We have to pay taxes at some point.
[00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:29.160]   We're going to look for opportunities to pay them at lower rates.
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:33.840]   So we're going to fill up lower brackets with income and then draw from elsewhere,
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:37.060]   if we can set this up in advance, to avoid getting pushed
[00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.200]   into these higher effective marginal tax rates.
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.120]   Now, RMBs are going to be a big problem in the future.
[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.060]   So we're doing a lot of this in advance of when RMBs begin.
[00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.580]   A part of this is going to be you end up paying taxes
[00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.960]   in the short-term to get long-term benefits.
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.920]   A lot of retirement income planning shares that theme.
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:59.180]   Short-term sacrifice can create great long-term benefits, and the biggest impacts for this
[00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:05.660]   in the tax code, they occur at a spot that's $100 a part for singles, $200 a part for couples.
[00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:08.900]   I don't know why they made this difference, why they didn't just put it in the same spot,
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:14.360]   but when you shift from right now 12% to 22% for ordinary income, that's a big jump
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:20.220]   in the taxes at these income levels, and then preferential income at about the same point is
[00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:23.580]   going to be switching from the 0% bracket to the 15% bracket.
[00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.980]   Then we have lots of income sources.
[00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:31.000]   I'm not really going into detail on this other than to say we've got ordinary income
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.100]   that what I'll be showing you with these tax maps will mostly relate to IRA distributions
[00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:39.260]   and then the taxable portion of Social Security.
[00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:43.040]   We have our preferential income sources, qualified dividends, and long-term capital gains
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:46.220]   that we may be forced to take just because if we have taxable assets,
[00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:48.640]   it's going to be kicking off qualified dividends.
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:52.680]   In addition to if we're selling shares of that, that will also generate long-term gains.
[00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:59.240]   And then we have non-taxable sources, which will be, for this context, the Roth IRA,
[00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:04.500]   and then the portion of Social Security that's not taxed, which we have some ability to reduce.
[00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:09.560]   We can get more of that Social Security to not be taxable by planning ahead.
[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:15.640]   Now part of this is going to involve Roth conversions, which are IRA distributions to the Roth IRA.
[00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:21.060]   You cannot Roth convert your RMD, so that's why it becomes a lot harder to do Roth conversions
[00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:22.100]   after RMDs begin.
[00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:24.380]   We're trying to do this before RMDs.
[00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:26.120]   Ideally, we'd pay taxes from elsewhere.
[00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:28.220]   We wouldn't pay it out of the IRA.
[00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:32.600]   But it's not necessarily a huge difference if you don't have any taxable assets anymore.
[00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:36.940]   But in an ideal world, you'd be paying the taxes from somewhere else,
[00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:39.840]   not from money you're taking out of the IRA.
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:43.640]   You can have a big window of opportunity to do this in your 60s if you're retired and
[00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:45.760]   delaying Social Security.
[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:52.660]   You could also be thinking ahead about potential large health bills or long-term care that's deductible,
[00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:57.640]   having some IRA money to offset that, which would be a reason to not fully convert everything.
[00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:01.820]   And then also during a market downturn, if you do have resources that are not losing value,
[00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:05.380]   that can be a good opportunity to do conversions at a lower bill.
[00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:10.860]   You get more shares moved over at a lower cost relative to before the market decline.
[00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:14.180]   Why might you want to front-load taxes?
[00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:17.780]   And this is not a political discussion at all, but just to the extent that we don't
[00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:22.080]   know what the future tax code will look like, the odds are if anything changes, it's probably
[00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:25.320]   going to be a change towards higher taxes than what we see today.
[00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:30.020]   The current legislative code is in 2026, the tax rates are going to be going up.
[00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:33.120]   And I've incorporated that into this analysis, but we never know.
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:37.400]   Maybe the current tax code could be made permanent, or what other changes might come along.
[00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:42.020]   Now the tax implications of a death of a spouse are pretty big, and I'll show specific tax
[00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:45.620]   maps for single individuals versus married filing jointly.
[00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:47.220]   You'll see what I'm talking about here.
[00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:50.980]   A single individual can face a much higher tax bill.
[00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:55.860]   Their spending may decline, but their overall taxes may increase, and I'll show this.
[00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:59.540]   We want to be, again, preparing in advance for required minimum distributions and the
[00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:01.220]   impacts that would have.
[00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:05.820]   And then also with the SECURE Act that passed in 2019, the old lifetime stretch on an inherited
[00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:11.380]   IRA for adult beneficiaries, adult children beneficiaries, now becomes a 10-year window.
[00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:15.860]   That could push them to take these out during high earnings years potentially, if they receive
[00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:18.100]   this inherited IRA in their 50s.
[00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:22.660]   It's not necessarily a great time for them to have to deplete that over the next 10 years.
[00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:25.900]   So helping to manage that process as well.
[00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:26.900]   Now here's a case study.
[00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:31.100]   I won't have time to go through all the details, but it's just illustrating the idea.
[00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:35.620]   This is showing how much taxes are paid every year, where the yellow is the conventional
[00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:36.620]   wisdom.
[00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:39.180]   Spend your taxable, then tax deferred, then tax exempt.
[00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:43.460]   And then the purple is the tax bills related to a more tax-efficient strategy, which I
[00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:48.020]   labeled here in a difficult way and then later realized, actually, I can make this simpler.
[00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:51.580]   This is pretty much going to be the same as you're going to manage the 15% marginal tax
[00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:52.580]   rate.
[00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:56.260]   You pay taxes whenever you can do so at 15% or less.
[00:09:56.260 --> 00:10:00.460]   So then what happens is you do face higher tax bills in your 60s.
[00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:06.340]   But by the time Social Security starts at 70, you're in a position where now RMDs are
[00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:10.060]   going to start at-- well, you do have some years where no taxes.
[00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:15.260]   Then once RMDs begin, we didn't get this aligned perfectly between the RMDs and the taxable
[00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:18.780]   part of Social Security, we do face a little bit of taxes.
[00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:22.580]   And that's going up over time because the Social Security brackets are not inflation
[00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:24.560]   adjusted, unlike everything else.
[00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:27.720]   So I'm not assuming any changes to the current law there.
[00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:31.400]   That's why taxes-- in inflation-adjusted terms, this is all inflation-adjusted purchasing
[00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:34.500]   power-- why the taxes creep up over time.
[00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:39.900]   And then we're running this plan out through age 95 with the conventional wisdom strategy.
[00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:43.260]   Their after-tax legacy is $37,000.
[00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:50.260]   With managing the 15% marginal tax rate, their after-tax legacy is about $160,000.
[00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.660]   So again, potentially big differences here.
[00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:58.640]   And this was a couple that had $1.5 million of investment assets at age 62.
[00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:00.420]   So let's dig into this more.
[00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:03.780]   What pitfalls-- so I'm saying, OK, let's pay taxes in advance.
[00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:05.900]   What pitfalls are there when you do that?
[00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:09.660]   Or conversely, what pitfalls can we help to avoid later when we do that?
[00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:11.860]   Well, this is the federal income tax brackets.
[00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:13.620]   Like I mentioned, they are progressive.
[00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:16.900]   As your income increases, your taxes go up.
[00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:19.980]   And you have to look at the title of each slide, because they're going to be jumping
[00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:20.980]   around.
[00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:21.980]   I'm just showing this.
[00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:25.660]   You have no Social Security benefit and no preferential income in this slide.
[00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:27.940]   So that means this is adjusted gross income.
[00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:34.180]   Later, the x-axis will change to ordinary income other than taxable Social Security.
[00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:37.180]   The way Social Security is taxed is super complicated.
[00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:40.860]   If they wanted to design something even more complicated, it makes it very hard to make
[00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:41.860]   these charts.
[00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:43.220]   So I'll be careful here.
[00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:46.460]   Here we've got adjusted gross income on horizontally.
[00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:49.500]   We have the federal income tax brackets.
[00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:54.460]   Now let's talk about what happens when we're generating more ordinary income.
[00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:55.460]   This is out of order.
[00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:57.380]   But we'll have the Social Security tax torpedo.
[00:11:57.380 --> 00:11:58.380]   We'll have this issue.
[00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:02.460]   And this is the first one, pushing preferential income into higher tax brackets, and then
[00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:04.460]   IRMA surcharges.
[00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:06.080]   And then there is the Affordable Care Act issue.
[00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:08.540]   But I'm not going to include that in these tax maps.
[00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:12.180]   I'll show you what it looks like real quick later.
[00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:16.140]   The preferential income brackets are not the same as the ordinary income brackets.
[00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:18.660]   Here's what they look like in 2023.
[00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:21.660]   Any day now, we'll probably get the 2024 numbers.
[00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:26.340]   OK, so here's a quick example of what I'm talking about, just so that it can make sense.
[00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:30.220]   The idea is your preferential income stacks on top of your ordinary income.
[00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:32.140]   So we'll take a single individual.
[00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:35.360]   They have taxable income of $44,625.
[00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:41.200]   So it's more than-- if this was the all ordinary income, they would be in the 22% bracket.
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:46.980]   But this is the $40,625 of ordinary income, $4,000 of long-term capital gains.
[00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:50.200]   So that $40,625 is in the 12% bracket still.
[00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:52.400]   This is a single filer.
[00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:58.140]   With their $4,000 of long-term gains, $2,000 of that still falls in the 0% preferential
[00:12:58.140 --> 00:12:59.140]   bracket.
[00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:02.960]   $2,000 of that falls in the 15% bracket.
[00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:05.660]   Now what happens if they take $1 out of their IRA?
[00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:08.100]   So they've got $1 more of ordinary income.
[00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:10.380]   That's taxed at 12%.
[00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:12.100]   But now that's changing.
[00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:17.300]   Now when you stack your preferential income on top of that, now just $1,999 is in the
[00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:18.700]   0% bracket.
[00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:21.620]   $2,001 is now in the 15% bracket.
[00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:24.080]   So we took $1 out of the IRA.
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:27.860]   That's also pushing $1 preferential income into the 15% bracket.
[00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:30.100]   That's adding another 15% of taxes.
[00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:33.760]   So that's a 27% marginal tax rate.
[00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:40.080]   So now their Social Security is still zero, but they have forced $20,000 of preferential
[00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:44.000]   income qualified dividends off their brokerage account.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.800]   Now that this is what's going to happen, we're starting to create these tax maps.
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:51.200]   We're going to have this range where they were in the 12% federal income bracket, but
[00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:53.320]   they're paying a 27%.
[00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:59.120]   And then later on when they're getting closer to that $250,000 threshold, they're then in
[00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:06.440]   the 24% bracket, but then another 3.8% on top of that for preferential income.
[00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:08.600]   Social Security tax torpedo.
[00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:12.880]   So up to 85% of Social Security benefits are taxable.
[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:16.160]   I'm not going to go-- we don't have time for the whole explanation of how they're taxed.
[00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:17.680]   We'll kind of leave it at that.
[00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:20.540]   But that tax schedule was created in 1994.
[00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:24.640]   And it's not inflation adjusted, one of the rare aspects of the tax code, where every
[00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:28.660]   year more and more Americans face taxes on their Social Security benefits.
[00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:32.760]   It is a complicated process to determine what percentage of that is taxed.
[00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:35.840]   And proactive planning, though, does help to avoid the full tax torpedo.
[00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:39.680]   And that is a key aspect of tax efficiency in retirement.
[00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:43.560]   So I absolutely agree with Mary Beth that it's best for the hirer to really think seriously
[00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:45.560]   about delaying to 70.
[00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:47.600]   This is a-- but wait, there's more.
[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:51.480]   If you're delaying until 70, you can give yourself a big opportunity to not just have
[00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:55.520]   a higher Social Security benefit, but to have less of that benefit taxed if you're doing
[00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:58.540]   tax planning in the meantime.
[00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:01.120]   And here's what this tax torpedo looks like.
[00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:02.400]   So we're moving along.
[00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:04.680]   We think we're in the 10% bracket.
[00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:07.320]   And so now we have-- this is a couple.
[00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:09.480]   They have $52,200 of Social Security.
[00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:12.000]   They have no preferential income right now.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.720]   And now the x-axis is not adjusted gross income anymore, because it makes it a lot harder
[00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:16.800]   to do that.
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:20.400]   It's your ordinary income, not including taxable Social Security.
[00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:21.400]   So we're moving along.
[00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:22.680]   We're taking money out of our IRA.
[00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:27.000]   We think we're in the 10% bracket, but we're getting hit by-- this is where, if I take
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.920]   a dollar out of my IRA, $0.85 of a dollar of my Social Security is taxed.
[00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:34.920]   That's pushing me to an 18.5% tax rate.
[00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:37.880]   And then I get kicked up into the 12% bracket.
[00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:44.240]   And now $1.85 with the tax torpedo that I think I'm in the 12% bracket, but I'm being
[00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:49.280]   taxed at 22.2% when I add in the fact that this is uniquely causing Social Security to
[00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:50.280]   be taxed.
[00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:57.520]   Eventually, I get up to that 85% threshold, and I don't have to worry about it anymore.
[00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:01.800]   Now for a single person, this looks a lot worse, because the full impact of the tax
[00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:05.960]   torpedo doesn't come in the 12% bracket like with couples.
[00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:10.860]   It comes in the 22% bracket for a single person.
[00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:16.160]   And in a few years, that 12% and 22% is going to change to 15% and 25%.
[00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:21.400]   But here, they're getting hit by the full burden of the tax torpedo in the 22% bracket,
[00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:26.480]   which we're going to multiply by 1.85, because a dollar from the IRA, also then $0.85 from
[00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:32.120]   Social Security, 40.7% marginal tax rate.
[00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:33.120]   Then Irma.
[00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:36.320]   So Irma's experience-- Mary Beth did talk about this.
[00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:40.000]   When you hit certain thresholds, you got a big extra bill.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:48.320]   If you're a single person, and you had this in 2023-- well, two years later-- $97,000,
[00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:53.840]   you pay your base premiums for Part B and Part D $1 more, and your base premiums are
[00:16:53.840 --> 00:17:02.680]   jumping by $937 for the year, or a 93,700% marginal tax rate on a dollar of income.
[00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:06.440]   Now if you do have a life-changing event, like retiring, but Roth conversions don't
[00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:13.200]   count as an excuse here, you can file form SSA-44 and ask not to be hit by the Irma surcharge,
[00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:16.240]   because it applies to two years later.
[00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:20.440]   You take income from this year, and then two years later is when you look at those thresholds
[00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:24.140]   and determine if you have to pay a higher tax.
[00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:28.280]   As Mary Beth noted, yesterday, these numbers-- or today-- either yesterday-- the new numbers
[00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:33.640]   are out for next year's table, but here's the 2023 table that I'll be using.
[00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:38.440]   Now we're back to a scenario where Social Security is zero, preferential income is zero,
[00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:42.520]   we're looking at taking money out of our IRA, generating ordinary income, we're moving along
[00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:46.240]   the federal income brackets, but then we start getting hit by these Irma thresholds, and
[00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:50.440]   there's five of them, and each time you hit one-- this is for a couple, so you take the
[00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:56.600]   numbers per person and multiply them by two-- an extra $1,874 in Part B and Part D premiums,
[00:17:56.600 --> 00:18:02.340]   then later $2,800, then later another $2,800, and then there's two more that are going beyond
[00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:03.840]   where this chart ended.
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:06.440]   So that's Irma.
[00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:12.940]   Now if you put this all together, so now we've got $52,200 of Social Security, we have $20,000
[00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:17.120]   of preferential income, and we're looking at what happens as we take money out of our
[00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:18.320]   IRA.
[00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:22.640]   And this is where, if you think ahead, why might we take money out of our IRA?
[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:26.560]   Maybe there's R&Ds that we don't actually want to spend, but this is what it's doing
[00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:29.100]   when we combine all these factors together.
[00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:30.680]   This is what the tax map looks like.
[00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:32.240]   This is the roller coaster.
[00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:36.760]   Your effective marginal tax rate goes up and down as you're generating more income, and
[00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:41.080]   it can be a lot higher than what the federal income tax brackets look like.
[00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:46.580]   Now with a single person, again, it looks differently because that tax torpedo hits
[00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:52.920]   you in the 22% bracket, and with that preferential income, you think you're-- actually, in this
[00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:58.540]   case, so you think you're still in the 12% bracket, but when you take $1 out of 12%,
[00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:04.320]   it's pushing another $0.85 of Social Security to be taxed, and then so that's-- we're working
[00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:08.340]   our way up, but then we're also getting the preferential income stacking issue, where
[00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:13.020]   now we're pushing $1.85 into the 15% bracket.
[00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:17.500]   When you put that all together, this poor person thought they were in the 12% bracket,
[00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:24.100]   but when they take $1 out of their IRA, they're paying 49.95% as a tax rate on that dollar.
[00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:26.820]   So that's devastating.
[00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:30.020]   That's what we're trying to plan for here.
[00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:33.260]   And I don't really have time to talk about the Affordable Care Act subsidies, but this
[00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:38.300]   is-- if you treat the loss of subsidy as a marginal tax rate, this is an example of what
[00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:39.300]   it can look like.
[00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:42.500]   Now there's a lot of variables that go into it, so it's not just one of these, but right
[00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:46.460]   now, and at least through 2026, this may change in 2026.
[00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:52.140]   Once you get above the 400% federal poverty line threshold for the household, you get
[00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:58.300]   this long range where incomes can go quite high, where you're losing $0.085 per dollar
[00:19:58.300 --> 00:19:59.860]   as you're generating taxable income.
[00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:02.620]   You're losing the subsidy for your health insurance.
[00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:05.740]   OK, so how can we manage this?
[00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:08.780]   So we've got these kinds of tax maps that we're trying to figure out, what do we do
[00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:09.780]   with these?
[00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:12.460]   How can we build an effective retirement income strategy?
[00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:17.380]   Well, the way I like to think about this is, first, what could we do to generate the least
[00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:19.100]   amount of taxable income?
[00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:21.100]   And that's our starting point.
[00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:26.140]   And then can we justify increasing taxable income above that by generally then moving
[00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:29.940]   away from Roth distributions to adding IRA distributions?
[00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:37.220]   And once we meet our spending goals, should we keep going with that and also do Roth conversions?
[00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:41.100]   Constraints on this, well, do we have available funds in our taxable account, tax deferred
[00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:43.740]   account, tax exempt account?
[00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:46.740]   Then another constraint is, where are we starting on the tax map?
[00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:48.940]   We don't get to start at zero with ordinary income.
[00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:50.840]   We may have other sources.
[00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:53.220]   So we may have required minimum distributions.
[00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:57.740]   We may have Social Security benefits, interest and dividends from our taxable accounts that
[00:20:57.740 --> 00:21:03.700]   we can't avoid, any other taxable income sources beyond this, pensions, even employment, anything
[00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:05.560]   that's generating taxable income.
[00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:07.860]   We have to use that as our starting point.
[00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:10.540]   And then if we're retired, what is our spending goal?
[00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:14.300]   How much are we actually trying to spend on a pre-tax basis?
[00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:17.260]   That's also going to put constraints on our behavior, because we have to make sure we
[00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:21.820]   at least get the funds we're trying to achieve to meet our spending needs.
[00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:22.980]   Okay.
[00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:27.660]   So then we take the tax map, and this is the way I've been thinking about this more recently.
[00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:30.940]   It's this idea of building a tax map.
[00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:36.900]   There's a software out there called Covisum that helped me learn this specific methodology.
[00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:42.700]   But what you do is, well, the question is, what we need to solve is, what tax rate should
[00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:43.700]   we try to manage?
[00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:45.980]   What effective tax rate should we manage?
[00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:51.860]   And it boils down to basic options are, and we'll just use, even though there is no 15%
[00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:58.180]   bracket right now, in 2026 it returns, should we use the 15% bracket, should we use the
[00:21:58.180 --> 00:22:01.340]   25%, should we use 28%?
[00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:04.620]   I think most of the answers will fall somewhere along there, and it depends really how much
[00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:06.100]   money do you have.
[00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:11.560]   15% could be the answer for someone who has a runway to do some tax planning and maybe
[00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:14.180]   has one to two million dollars.
[00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:17.620]   As we're getting up, I've looked at cases where there's five and a half million dollars
[00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:22.180]   to work with and finding that maybe going into that 28% bracket can make sense in those
[00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:23.180]   scenarios.
[00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:26.920]   But here, we're just simply, we have to figure out what bracket to manage.
[00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:30.220]   Right now I'm just showing you how to make your decisions given that you have a bracket
[00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:31.220]   to manage.
[00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:36.700]   So if you're trying to manage the 15% bracket, how much income should you generate?
[00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:40.500]   The idea is, you want to look for, there's a roller coaster here.
[00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:45.700]   The tax rate can go above 15%, but it can come back down below 15% again.
[00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:49.740]   Sometimes it may make sense to generate some income at a higher rate because then you have
[00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:53.900]   a big runway of income at a lower rate again, and that's what we're trying to figure out.
[00:22:53.900 --> 00:23:00.300]   Those black dots are marking points where we go above the 15% bracket.
[00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:01.540]   And so we want to check those.
[00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:07.100]   Well, if we go up to the, starting from zero, zero's identified too, but the first black
[00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:11.540]   dot there on the 15% bracket happens with the preferential income stacking, where the
[00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:14.580]   marginal tax rate would go up to 27%.
[00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:18.340]   We can generate income up to that point at an effective marginal rate for that whole
[00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:20.860]   chunk of income of 7.9%.
[00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:21.860]   So that's desirable.
[00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:22.860]   We want to do that.
[00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:27.240]   Then we're going to check that next group where we're going to go back down below 15%
[00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:30.620]   because of that $200 gap that I mentioned earlier.
[00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:33.300]   There is another place where we're paying at 12% for $200.
[00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:35.180]   Well, let's check it.
[00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:38.620]   No, that's going to be too high of an effective marginal rate.
[00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:43.140]   So if I was managing the 15% bracket here, I would go up to where that preferential income
[00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:45.620]   stacking became an issue.
[00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:47.980]   What if I wanted to manage the 25% bracket?
[00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:52.140]   Well, in this case, I go up to that income stacking, and that's the same.
[00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:54.500]   I can do that successfully.
[00:23:54.500 --> 00:24:00.140]   Then if I go into that preferential income stacking issue, once I get past that, I'm
[00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:03.060]   back down to the 22% bracket for a while.
[00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:05.140]   But then I'm going to hit that first IRMA surcharge.
[00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:11.940]   Well, if I check what is the effective marginal rate on that chunk of income, it's 23.3% under
[00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:13.740]   our 25% threshold.
[00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:14.740]   So that's OK.
[00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:15.740]   We'll go ahead and do that.
[00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:19.740]   And here, the answer is basically generate income up to the IRMA threshold.
[00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:23.860]   And what I'm assuming about the IRMA threshold is I'm just using this year's numbers to make
[00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:28.180]   the tax map because it's going to only be relevant-- two years later, I'll pay the tax.
[00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:29.620]   But that's-- what do we do with that?
[00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:33.500]   I'm just going to assume you pay the tax this year for the purpose of making the tax maps.
[00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:37.900]   We'd stop at the first IRMA threshold because any efforts to go beyond that are always going
[00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:41.140]   to generate average tax rates higher than our target.
[00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:45.700]   However, if we were wealthier, probably, so that we actually decide we want to manage
[00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:53.260]   the 28% effective marginal rate, well, we can actually do that up to the second IRMA
[00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:55.380]   threshold.
[00:24:55.380 --> 00:25:00.660]   And so each-- in this case, the first chunk of income staying under 28% gets us to the
[00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:01.660]   first IRMA threshold.
[00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:05.460]   We could do that at 14.4% tax, which is fine.
[00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:07.220]   Then we have another gap to the second threshold.
[00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:11.180]   We can do that under 28%, so that's fine.
[00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:13.380]   I think I'm at time, right?
[00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:17.040]   So to conclude, we have a progressive tax code.
[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:21.460]   But if we use tax diversification during the accumulation phase and then use these kinds
[00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:26.100]   of techniques to manage with Roth conversions and tax rate management, we can build retirement
[00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:27.100]   income plans.
[00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:28.100]   Thank you.
[00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:28.100]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:29.100]   Thank you.
[00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:29.100]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:30.100]   Thank you.
[00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:30.100]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:31.100]   Thank you.
[00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:31.100]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:32.100]   Thank you.
[00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:32.100]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:33.100]   Thank you.
[00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:33.100]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:35.160]   you
