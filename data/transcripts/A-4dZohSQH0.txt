[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.200]   Welcome to the Bogleheads Chapter Series.
[00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:11.680]   This episode was hosted by the Life Stage Chapters and recorded October 29th, 2024.
[00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.480]   It features longtime Boglehead and insurance expert Stinky, also known as Wayne,
[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.040]   presenting the topic, "All About Life Insurance."
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:24.560]   Bogleheads are investors who follow John Bogle's philosophy for attaining financial independence.
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.440]   This recording is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as personalized
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:30.400]   investment advice.
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:40.480]   Tonight we have, we're delighted to host Wayne, who is in his program on All About Life Insurance.
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.640]   It's a very important part of financial planning.
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.600]   Actually, life insurance, I think people have questions about life insurance from the beginning,
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.240]   when they're first getting life insurance, all the way through retirement, when they have these
[00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.000]   policies and they don't know really what to do with them, whether to keep them or not.
[00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.040]   Let me introduce my, I'll let Wayne introduce himself in just a moment.
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:11.600]   Let me introduce my helpers, Lady Geek from Pennsylvania, Allen from Tampa, Jim from Chicago.
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.400]   Jim will also be recording.
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:22.800]   It will be recorded audio-visual and we will put it out on the Bogleheads YouTube channel.
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.920]   If you don't want yourself on YouTube, just turn your video off.
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:35.920]   After Wayne's presentation, we will turn off the video and we will just keep it on audio.
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.120]   That will be recorded because after the presentation, we can have questions and we can
[00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:47.440]   discuss life insurance and ask him any kind of question about life insurance.
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.320]   Wayne's presentation will be in two parts.
[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.920]   He's going to stop it halfway through and you can ask your questions about what he has
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.280]   talked about up to that point.
[00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:03.120]   Please put your questions in the chat or you can, at that point, raise your hand.
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.600]   Let me see what else.
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.360]   Jim?
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:15.360]   No?
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.560]   Okay.
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.480]   So Wayne, why don't you get started?
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.040]   It's yours.
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.440]   And I will share the screen here.
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:29.600]   Give me a minute to find the proper.
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:38.480]   Here we are.
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.880]   Share.
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:49.600]   And I will start with the, start the slideshow.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.480]   Okay.
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.000]   All about life insurance.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.440]   So I'll introduce myself here first.
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.600]   My first name is Wayne.
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.640]   I'm known as Stinky on the Boglehead Forum.
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:06.560]   Stinky is my nickname since childhood, kind of a takeoff on my last name.
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:13.520]   I have 40 years of work experience in senior financial positions at major life insurance
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:14.080]   companies.
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.080]   I'm really, really passionate about life insurance.
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:23.920]   I'm really, because of that work, quite familiar with the product design and pricing for most
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.760]   all kinds of life insurance and annuity.
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.840]   I've seen what my company did for pricing and product development.
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.320]   I've also seen what other companies have done when we did due diligence on buying other
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.160]   companies or buying other blocks of business.
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.120]   I'm pretty active on the Boglehead Forum.
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.880]   I've got over 15,000 posts on the forum now, many of them on, you know, answering threads
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.720]   on life insurance and annuities.
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.200]   I do try and answer or weigh in on most all the threads on life insurance and annuities.
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.480]   And if somebody has a question that they want to pose, I've gotten many, many private messages
[00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:56.960]   from folks.
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:00.880]   I'm happy to take private messages and offer my views on things.
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.200]   I've also got a thread on the forum called Purchasing MIGAs.
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.360]   MIGAs are multi-year guaranteed annuities.
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:13.200]   And that thread has now been running strong for almost four years, since late 2020.
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:20.800]   And as of now, it has almost 3,000 posts and almost 400,000 views on that one thread.
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:24.960]   And just looking at what people have said about that thread, it appears that dozens
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:30.080]   of people have been better informed about what a multi-year guaranteed annuity is, kind
[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.160]   of like a CD issued by an insurance company, a bank CD.
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.400]   And they've been able to buy with some confidence MIGAs and advance their financial position.
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.680]   So I'm really kind of proud and gratified of that thread.
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.480]   Let me give you a disclaimer for what we have here.
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.560]   First, I am not your financial advisor.
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.040]   This presentation is not financial advice.
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:55.200]   You need to consult with a financial or tax or accounting or other advisor.
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.000]   It's a high level overview of life insurance.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.640]   I think I'm going to end up talking for almost an hour here between the two sections of the
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:03.600]   presentation.
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.520]   But I could go two or three hours if you wanted to go really deep on certain topics.
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.080]   And so it is a high level overview covering most all areas of life insurance.
[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.600]   It's not comprehensive.
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:19.520]   You can certainly forward any questions, pose them here during the presentation or during
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.120]   the question periods or private message me on anything you have questions about.
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.600]   Don't rely on this presentation for purchasing or surrendering any life insurance or financial
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:28.480]   products.
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.080]   The views expressed are my own.
[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.360]   I formed my views from my experience in work.
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:38.800]   And also I formed my views from observing people's situations on the forum and elsewhere
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:39.440]   in real life.
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.120]   But they're my own views, of course.
[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.880]   And I've never been in sales.
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:43.760]   I'm not a sales guy.
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.880]   I'm more of a numbers guy, a back office, a financial guy.
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:52.640]   And my knowledge, therefore, comes from being in home office, leadership roles, but not
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:53.440]   a sales role.
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:57.760]   So here's the way that we'll have the agenda for tonight.
[00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:01.600]   First, I'll talk about what is life insurance and what are reasons that a person might buy
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:06.480]   it, and then we'll go into a deep dive on term insurance, individual term insurance,
[00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:10.800]   and then a little bit about group insurance that you might get from your employer, describing
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.080]   the product, going through the purchase process and other parts of that.
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:18.080]   Then we'll break for five or 10 minutes for any questions that you might have about term
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:18.560]   insurance.
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:23.680]   Then the second half of the presentation is other topics, permanent life insurance, which
[00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:28.800]   is whole life, universal life, et cetera, a couple of specialty kinds of insurance, juvenile
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:34.480]   and final expense, and then finally closing out with how is life insurance taxed and how
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:38.880]   are life insurance policyholders protected from the default of the insurance company.
[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:40.960]   So what is life insurance?
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:47.600]   Life insurance at its core is a contract where an insurance company promises to pay your
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:52.640]   beneficiaries a death benefit if you die with the policies in force.
[00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:53.520]   It's as simple as that.
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:07:00.640]   And there are really two separate kinds of life insurance you can divide all these various
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:01.360]   products into.
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:07.280]   One is term, and I'm just going to define term as protection intended for less than
[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:12.560]   your full lifetime, for 10 years, 20 years, 30 years, or maybe one year in certain situations,
[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.240]   but not for your full lifetime.
[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:21.360]   Contrast term with permanent, which is protection for your entire lifetime, and that also usually
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:22.720]   includes a cash value buildup.
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:27.200]   Not all people keep permanent insurance for their whole lifetime, but it's positioned
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:30.400]   to be available to you for your entire lifetime.
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:35.360]   And measured by face amount, the majority of sales are term life insurance.
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:40.160]   Term is by far the more popular product by face amount, but because the premiums per
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:47.520]   thousand are so much higher on permanent insurance, the majority of sales by premium are permanent
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:52.240]   life insurance sales, but by far the vast majority of sales by face amount are term.
[00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:55.360]   Why should somebody buy life insurance?
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:08:01.680]   The primary use case for any kind of life insurance is to provide financial support
[00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:05.840]   for your dependents, usually a child and/or a spouse after your death.
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:11.600]   A use case, I'm going to talk here about a 30-year-old breadwinner, be it male or female,
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:19.200]   but a 30-year-old who's supporting a spouse and children, that 30-year-old, if that person
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:25.280]   were to die, then it's a tragedy, certainly a human tragedy, but also a financial tragedy
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:30.720]   because those dependents, those children, that spouse, were depending upon the income
[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:37.360]   of that breadwinner for their livelihood for years and years to come, and term life insurance
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:44.000]   is unique in that it can drop a whole bucket of money into a household for a fairly nominal
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.360]   premium after a person dies without income taxes.
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:50.640]   It is a unique product in that way.
[00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:52.560]   There is no bank product that can do that.
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:54.800]   There's no other kind of insurance product that can do that.
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:59.840]   Life insurance can do that, and the primary use case is to give financial support for
[00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:03.360]   your dependents, usually a child or a spouse, after your death.
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:07.040]   There are some secondary use cases.
[00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:11.760]   Most of these could be covered by a permanent life insurance policy, and most of these cases
[00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:14.080]   also have other financial solutions.
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:18.240]   For example, the first one, to provide liquidity to cover estate taxes.
[00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:24.080]   If your estate is high enough that you expect to pay estate taxes, which is going to be
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:30.720]   somewhere under current tax law, if you're married, somewhere in the $15, $20 million,
[00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:35.280]   $30 million range, somewhere in there, if you are going to pay estate taxes, that can
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:39.440]   provide liquidity for you to pay those estate taxes, cash available to you.
[00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:43.680]   But of course, you can also solve that need for paying estate taxes by putting aside some
[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:46.720]   cash somewhere, letting that accumulate, and have that available.
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:51.680]   So insurance can provide that need, and often agents will sell it that way.
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:53.440]   Other things can provide that need also.
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:58.000]   Another use could be to provide for a disabled child who's expected to outlive you.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:03.520]   There are some disabilities that children have that cause them to be maybe not fully
[00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:08.160]   functioning as regular adults, but their life expectancy is normal.
[00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:10.640]   They don't expect to have a shorter lifespan.
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:15.680]   Therefore, there's a good chance that they'll live beyond you, and provide support for them
[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:18.800]   after your death, then life insurance can be used for that.
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:21.840]   You can benefit a favorite charity no matter when you die.
[00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:28.160]   There's some people who posted on the forum who have interesting use cases, who find that
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:33.600]   if they're in a very high tax state, typically California, and they're at a very high income
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:40.000]   level, a 37% federal income level, plus top California rates, et cetera, et cetera, they
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.120]   have found that life insurance, cash value life insurance, can provide a reasonable rate
[00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:50.080]   of return as an after-tax investment vehicle, after they exhaust everything else they can
[00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:56.400]   do, like 401(k)s, and IRAs, and HSAs, and 529s, and everything else.
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:01.040]   There's not many people like that that can really effectively use permanent life insurance
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:03.440]   in that way, but there are some people that do that.
[00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:09.040]   But going back to the primary use case, the primary use case is as a death benefit, and
[00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:13.520]   the rest of these I regard as kind of ancillary use cases for permanent life insurance, typically.
[00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:19.760]   Individual term life insurance, it's the simplest form of life insurance, pure death benefit
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:22.000]   protection, no savings element.
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:26.560]   It's commonly available for 10, 15, 20, and 30-year periods.
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:29.840]   So, for example, we have our 30-year-old breadwinner.
[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:32.720]   That breadwinner has a young child or two.
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:39.120]   If that person buys a 20-year term policy, then that 20-year term policy will be in place
[00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:42.640]   from the time that the insured is age 30 to age 50.
[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:48.640]   By that time, the child will have grown from being two years old to 22 years old, and either
[00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:50.560]   out of college or close to out of college.
[00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:54.880]   You know, so that's kind of the lifespan that a lot of folks look at.
[00:11:54.880 --> 00:12:00.880]   When are the kids flying the nest, and so how long do I need to provide support for
[00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:01.440]   those children?
[00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:08.640]   And the way that the level term policies are sold is that they will have a level death
[00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:11.760]   benefit and a level premium for that entire 20-year period.
[00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:16.480]   You buy a policy at age 30, you pay the same premium every month or every year or every
[00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:20.960]   whatever, and you'll pay that same rate for each year for 20 years, and you'll have a
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:23.440]   level death benefit protection also for that 20-year period.
[00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:28.640]   Now, one thing that I'll come back to a couple times here in the presentation is that the
[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:33.120]   chance of death grows a little bit each year as you get older.
[00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:38.480]   The chance of death in any particular year is very low until you're in your 60s or 70s,
[00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:44.880]   but a 31-year-old is marginally more likely to die in a certain year than a 30-year-old
[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:45.920]   in a 40-year-old.
[00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:50.880]   And a 40-year-old is more likely to die than a 30-year-old, and on and on and on.
[00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:54.240]   Therefore, the 30-year-old is going to pay a certain premium rate.
[00:12:54.240 --> 00:13:00.720]   If that person waits until age 31 or 32 to buy a 20-year term, they'll pay a little bit
[00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:05.600]   more premium for that 20-year period because they're a little bit older.
[00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:14.000]   Also, if that 30-year-old person buys a 30-year term policy, taking them out to age 60, then
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.120]   they'll pay more premium for that every year than for a 20-year term policy because you're
[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:23.680]   covering those years from age 50 to age 60, and the person's older, the chances of death
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:24.320]   are higher there.
[00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:31.040]   So the rates are level and guaranteed, and the rates will change a little bit as you
[00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:34.880]   get older or as the term insured grows longer.
[00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:41.760]   Now, after the level term period, these policies that we call level term kind of colloquially
[00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:45.600]   are not really term insurance.
[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:51.280]   A strict actual definition of term insurance is the policy would conclude after 20 years,
[00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:52.160]   and that doesn't happen.
[00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:58.080]   The policies almost always carry on beyond 20 years, but they'll carry on usually at
[00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:04.000]   a much, much higher premium rate, maybe five times, 10 times, or even more than the premium
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:04.560]   was.
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:08.960]   So your age 51 premium might be five times what your age 50 premium was.
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:14.240]   Most policyholders just still need coverage after that level term period expires.
[00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:15.680]   They'll just buy new coverage.
[00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:17.360]   They will not renew the policy.
[00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:18.560]   They'll just buy new coverage.
[00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:24.240]   Term insurance gives the largest death benefit for dollar premium.
[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:30.880]   So I looked at termforsale.com, which is a website frequently mentioned on the forum,
[00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:38.800]   and a male, non-smoker, age 30, in good health can buy a million dollars a 20-year term for
[00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:40.480]   40 bucks a month.
[00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:42.640]   40 bucks a month is less than your cell phone bill.
[00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:44.560]   It's less than your internet bill.
[00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:49.280]   It's less than a meal out for two, unless you go to McDonald's and are cheap.
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:55.920]   It's a very inexpensive cost to dump a million dollars into your family if you die.
[00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:59.840]   Your chances of death are low, but the financial cost of your death is catastrophic.
[00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:08.640]   So that's a very inexpensive way, in my view, of ensuring the income for you to pass away
[00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:09.360]   prematurely.
[00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:13.200]   Now, I did not give the best rate class there.
[00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:15.840]   If you're in excellent health, you could pay less than $40 a month.
[00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:19.680]   If you're unhealthy, somewhat unhealthy, you can pay more than that.
[00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:25.040]   And smokers, when I was younger, when I was in my 20s, smoking was a lot more prevalent
[00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:26.160]   than it is now.
[00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:30.000]   Smoking is really not socially acceptable for most folks these days.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:37.840]   But smokers legitimately, even in those ages of 20s, 30s, and 40s, have materially, measurably
[00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:40.720]   higher death rates than nonsmokers do.
[00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:44.240]   And so smokers will pay two to three times the price that a nonsmoker will pay.
[00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:49.360]   That's maybe the best demonstration there is as to how bad smoking is for your health,
[00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:53.200]   that the life insurance companies, which are totally rational in this area, are charging
[00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:57.680]   two to three times more for term insurance for smokers than they charge for nonsmokers.
[00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:04.640]   Now, I would argue-- go back to my 30-year-old breadwinner here.
[00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:10.080]   My 30-year-old breadwinner has maybe a modest 401(k) balance, maybe has some equity in a
[00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:15.760]   house, maybe has some savings, maybe has an IRA balance.
[00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:19.120]   So they have begun building assets.
[00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:24.720]   And there are some people in the forum who report having net worths of $200,000, $500,000,
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:26.800]   maybe even $1 million by age 30.
[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:32.800]   But by far, their largest asset is their ability to earn future income.
[00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:34.640]   It's not an asset you can put on a balance sheet.
[00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:39.040]   It's not anything you can cash or borrow against, necessarily.
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:43.440]   But it is something that is real and is out there in support of your family.
[00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:49.920]   And so that present value of future earnings for the next 30, 40, whatever number of years
[00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:54.160]   you plan to work after you're age 30, that is a huge asset.
[00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:58.800]   And term insurance, I think, provides the most cost-efficient way to replace that lost
[00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:00.240]   future income if they die young.
[00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:05.040]   So that's what you're insuring is your future ability to earn money.
[00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:11.280]   Now, what can a term life insurance policy owner do?
[00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:18.000]   One thing he can do, he or she can do, is to cease paying premium after a grace period.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.680]   The policy will lapse without value.
[00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:22.960]   I'll give an example, a personal example, as to me.
[00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:28.400]   I bought, for a variety of reasons, 20-year term insurance when I was 55 years old.
[00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:31.440]   I didn't know how much longer I'd be working.
[00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:34.720]   I thought I might continue working after my formal retirement date.
[00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:36.640]   I thought it might be a good idea to have term insurance.
[00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:38.400]   It took me out to age 75.
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:42.480]   But as things turned out, when I turned 65, I retired.
[00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:44.400]   I was not working for income anymore.
[00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:45.840]   So I just stopped paying premiums.
[00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:49.920]   And after about a 60-day grace period, the policy lapsed.
[00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:52.160]   No value, no cash return to me.
[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:56.160]   But I didn't have an insurance need anymore because I was not earning income.
[00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:58.160]   And so my income replacement need went away.
[00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:01.120]   And I lapsed the term policy.
[00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:05.200]   So that's the first option you have, is to lapse the policy.
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:08.640]   The owner can change beneficiaries.
[00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:12.240]   Often the beneficiary will be the spouse or a trust in favor of the children,
[00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:12.960]   something like that.
[00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:17.200]   The owner can reduce the face amount if they find that the face amount is more
[00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:19.120]   than they need as their assets grow.
[00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:25.280]   Another valuable option that exists on many term policies is the option to
[00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:30.080]   convert to a permanent life insurance policy without additional medical exams.
[00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:32.160]   Let's consider my 30-year-old again.
[00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:34.320]   And he's 15 years into the policy.
[00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:38.320]   And he's developed a really bad, life-threatening condition that's going
[00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:43.280]   to cause -- that's likely to cause his death, you know, maybe not immediately,
[00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:45.280]   but in the next 10 to 15 years.
[00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:50.640]   If he chose to, he could convert his term policy into a permanent life
[00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:52.000]   insurance policy.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.960]   He's going to pay a much higher premium, but he will be able to keep that
[00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:58.240]   insurance and not provide new evidence of insurability.
[00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:01.440]   Or if he went to buy a new term insurance policy, since his death is
[00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:03.440]   imminent, he would not be able to buy that.
[00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:07.760]   And so some people find that converting a term life policy into a permanent
[00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:11.840]   policy makes financial sense for them if they've developed a life-threatening
[00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:14.240]   condition while that term policy was in force.
[00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:20.960]   On to where can you buy a term life insurance policy?
[00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:26.000]   There are many multi-state agencies that have an online presence and give
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.840]   quotes from multiple insurance companies.
[00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:33.680]   You look at the Internet, the Boglehead Forum, termforsale.com is frequently
[00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:34.320]   mentioned.
[00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:38.400]   I have frequently mentioned that as a place people can go to look for quotes
[00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:43.440]   and that particular site, if you put in your demographic information, your age,
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:48.640]   your sex, your state of residence, how much insurance you need, how long you
[00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:54.160]   need to have it for, whether you're a smoker or not, and your estimate of your
[00:19:54.160 --> 00:20:00.320]   own risk classification based on superior or excellent, whatever, it'll give you
[00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:04.640]   quotes from several dozen insurance companies as to what they would charge
[00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:06.720]   you for a policy.
[00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:12.320]   And then you can go and work with a local agent that they'll recommend to you
[00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:15.600]   to buy a policy from one of those companies.
[00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:19.360]   And there are other websites that do exactly the same thing.
[00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:23.200]   Zander.com is promoted by Dave Ramsey.
[00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:26.800]   I've actually bought my insurance from Zander.com back in the day.
[00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:32.080]   SelectQuotes, another agency that you have, there's a variety of places you
[00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:34.720]   can buy life insurance.
[00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:37.040]   Now, local agents will also sell term life insurance.
[00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:40.560]   You might be able to find an agent that's licensed with many, many companies
[00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:43.280]   also that can provide the same service for you.
[00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:48.400]   But I wouldn't go necessarily to my Northwestern Mutual agent or my State
[00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:53.520]   Farm agent because they might only be able to sell insurance from their
[00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:57.120]   primary company, Northwestern or State Farm, or just a very limited number of
[00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:57.600]   companies.
[00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:01.280]   You're going to find the premiums vary widely for the same coverage.
[00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:07.840]   Now, if I get a quote from ABC Life from TermForSale.com, I'll be able to get
[00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:11.840]   that same policy from ABC Life anywhere at the same price.
[00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:17.680]   But ABC Life and DEF Life may have dramatically different rates with the
[00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:20.880]   same 20-year term coverage from ALH30.
[00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:26.160]   And so many Vogleheads, myself included, view price as the primary factor in
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:27.600]   deciding which insurer to choose.
[00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:32.880]   How do you buy a term life insurance policy?
[00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:35.680]   Now, an agent will guide you through the purchase process.
[00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:42.320]   Every company has an agent.
[00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:46.240]   You'll be working through an agent if you go through TermForSale.com, a local
[00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:46.800]   agent.
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:50.560]   You'll be going through Zander or the Select Float agency if you work with
[00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:51.280]   them.
[00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:55.360]   And even if you call in to one of the life insurance companies that appears to
[00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:59.440]   sell direct, they will have an agent, a commission, a salaried agent,
[00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:03.520]   typically, employed by the company who will walk you through the process.
[00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:08.400]   They will have an extensive written application that includes medical
[00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:08.880]   history.
[00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:11.920]   All I can say about the application is don't lie.
[00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:12.800]   Don't fudge.
[00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:13.920]   You have honest answers.
[00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:18.640]   They'll also ask you to sign an authorization for them to do further due
[00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:19.760]   diligence on you.
[00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:23.360]   And that authorization is really required for them to proceed in the
[00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:23.840]   process.
[00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:28.560]   Once they have that authorization, they can get many, many data points on you,
[00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:33.840]   your prescription drug records, your medical history from your doctor, your
[00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:36.080]   motor vehicle records, your credit reports.
[00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:40.080]   All kinds of things like that are available through the authorizations that
[00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:40.800]   they have.
[00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:44.640]   And they can build a pretty good profile on most folks for most amounts of
[00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:47.920]   insurance from those data points that they get there.
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:52.960]   Now, depending on the age or face amount, for higher ages or higher face
[00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:56.000]   amounts, the insurer might need a quick medical exam.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.680]   So the insurance company would pay for a medical examiner to come to your
[00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:05.280]   home or to your office, weigh you, measure you, maybe do a blood pressure,
[00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:10.400]   maybe do an EKG, and then possibly also take blood, urine, saliva.
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:15.040]   Those bodily fluids can be really, really helpful in determining your
[00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:16.960]   health with the tests that they have these days.
[00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:19.840]   The insurer will assess all that information.
[00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:21.920]   The insurer will issue the policy.
[00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:23.360]   You'll pay the first premium.
[00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:24.640]   And then the policy's in force.
[00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:29.520]   I will note that the insurer will give you the option of paying premiums
[00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:34.320]   monthly via bank draft or quarterly or semi-annually or annually.
[00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:39.120]   And I've found that almost always the cheapest way to do it is paying annually
[00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:43.600]   because the effective interest rate is often about 10% if you want to pay
[00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:44.100]   monthly.
[00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:50.720]   A typical question on the forum, a lot of folks ask, "How much term insurance
[00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:53.280]   should I buy when I do buy it and for how long?"
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:55.920]   There's no single answer for that.
[00:23:55.920 --> 00:24:00.320]   In a partial list of considerations to think about, for how long will someone
[00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:01.440]   be dependent on my income?
[00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:06.800]   If I got a newly born kid and I'm expecting more kids, it may very well be
[00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:10.480]   the 20 or 25 or 30-year term makes sense for me.
[00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:14.480]   But if I'm buying insurance or increasing insurance now and my kids are
[00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:17.680]   10 or 12 or 15, I might just need 10-year term insurance.
[00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:21.520]   How much income replacement should I provide for?
[00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:24.560]   And along with the fourth question, are my assets large enough that I can
[00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:26.720]   partially or fully self-insure?
[00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:31.920]   If you've got a $100 million net worth, then you probably don't need term life
[00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:32.420]   insurance.
[00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:37.280]   And so it may be that you can reduce the amount that any equation might have
[00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:39.360]   just based on the assets that you have.
[00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:43.040]   Further, the third point that I have there, are your survivors eligible for
[00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:46.800]   Social Security, which can be a very valuable thing, especially for dependent
[00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:49.920]   children until they're, I believe, 18.
[00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:53.600]   If they can get income from that, that'll mitigate the amount of life
[00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:54.480]   insurance you need to have.
[00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:58.640]   Another important question is, should you buy insurance on a stay-at-home
[00:24:58.640 --> 00:24:59.520]   spouse?
[00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:03.040]   You know, the stay-at-home spouse, on the one hand, is not bringing income
[00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:09.120]   into the household, so there's no cash loss from that source if a stay-at-home
[00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:10.880]   spouse were to pass away.
[00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:14.640]   But there is a loss, a financial loss, if you have increased child care or
[00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:15.840]   things like that.
[00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:20.160]   So it's frequent that people will say, "I should put $100,000 or $250,000 or
[00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:24.080]   $500,000 on my stay-at-home spouse," even if they're not earning an income
[00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:24.800]   outside the house.
[00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:29.440]   There was a historic rule of thumb, "10 times earnings until kids leave the
[00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:30.000]   nest."
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.960]   I wouldn't say that's accurate, but you could at least use that as a guide
[00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:33.460]   point.
[00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:35.360]   There are many online calculators.
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:39.280]   If you want to go ahead and Google, "How much insurance should I buy?"
[00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:42.800]   You can get a lot of opinions from various places where you put in certain
[00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:46.240]   information, and they'll spit out a recommendation as to how much term
[00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:46.960]   insurance to buy.
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:51.360]   One thing frequently mentioned in the forum is laddering policies.
[00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:55.120]   Let's say that I determine that I have a $2 million need for term life
[00:25:55.120 --> 00:26:01.360]   insurance, and I could buy that for a 20-year period, 2 million, 20-year term,
[00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:01.860]   done.
[00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:07.360]   But if I expect that my assets will be increasing over the next 10 years, I
[00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:12.720]   might buy $2 million in two separate policies, $1 million of 10-year term,
[00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:14.240]   and $1 million of 20-year term.
[00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:20.320]   And that way, for the first 10 years, I will have both policies in force, so a
[00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:23.600]   total of $2 million of death benefit, and that'll reduce to $1 million of
[00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:26.800]   death benefit when I get past that 10th year.
[00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:30.160]   And if I choose to, when that 10th year is over, I can consider buying more
[00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:32.000]   insurance at that point if I need it.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:39.760]   Finally, the last slide in this part of the presentation is changing away from
[00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:44.320]   individual term life insurance to group term life insurance.
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:49.600]   Now, many employers, most employers probably, offer some amount of life
[00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:51.760]   insurance as an employee benefit.
[00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:53.600]   This is a part of their regular benefits package.
[00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:56.800]   Usually, some part of that is free.
[00:26:56.800 --> 00:27:02.800]   It's frequent that you'll be given one-time salary or two-time salary as a
[00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:04.400]   free amount with no cost to you.
[00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:06.240]   You might get $50,000.
[00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:11.200]   The reason for that $50,000 number is that, it's my belief under the federal
[00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:17.440]   tax code, that's an amount that an employer can give in life insurance without
[00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:19.920]   having taxable income imputed to the employee.
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:21.840]   So you might get some free amount.
[00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:25.680]   Then they might also give you the option of having additional amounts of life
[00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:30.080]   insurance on top of that that you'll pay for by yourself as opposed to the
[00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:32.960]   employer paying for it, but you'll get it through your work relationship.
[00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:39.440]   One benefit to group term life insurance is that typically no evidence of
[00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:40.880]   insurability is needed.
[00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:43.040]   You won't have to give blood or saliva.
[00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:46.640]   You won't have to have any kind of a medical exam or credit report or anything
[00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:47.360]   else.
[00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:52.080]   Just because you're employed, you'll be able to get life insurance except for
[00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:52.640]   high amounts.
[00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:56.560]   If you're applying for excess amounts on yourself, it might require evidence of
[00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:57.360]   insurability.
[00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:00.640]   But just the fact that you're employed is enough evidence that the group life
[00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:02.960]   insurer will need to put insurance on you.
[00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:07.680]   Now, the bad thing about group term life is that coverage ceases when you
[00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:08.320]   leave your job.
[00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:14.320]   And with the number of job changes that many people make these days, it's
[00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:20.000]   really not a sound financial thing to do to have your life insurance tied to
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.120]   your employment.
[00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:23.440]   Because you can go through periods of unemployment.
[00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:26.240]   You might have a new employer that doesn't offer term life insurance.
[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:29.520]   And if you have a real need for term life insurance, you should be buying
[00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:33.360]   individual life insurance that will stay with you whether you're employed
[00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:36.400]   with employer A or employer B or not employed at all.
[00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:40.560]   And the only option that you have when you leave your employer is you can
[00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:46.240]   convert your term life policy to an extremely high cost conversion permanent
[00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:47.440]   life policy.
[00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:50.400]   Again, that would be a last ditch effort.
[00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:54.320]   But that would be not the optimal solution.
[00:28:54.320 --> 00:29:00.640]   The consensus on the Vogelhead Forum seems to be that a person should take
[00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:04.560]   the free coverage that is offered by your employer and decline any excess
[00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:05.360]   amount.
[00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:07.360]   Buy the insurance you need through the individual market.
[00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:13.440]   So with that, I've gone for about half an hour now.
[00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:16.880]   And we'll see if there's any questions to have based on the first part of the
[00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:17.680]   presentation here.
[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:18.880]   >> Okay.
[00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:22.400]   Does anybody have any questions that you wish to raise your hand for?
[00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:29.920]   I have one question, Wayne.
[00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:37.680]   On the laddering of the term policies, is there any downside to, for example,
[00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:41.440]   buying, let's say, a 10-year term policy when you're very, very young?
[00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:42.960]   You're just starting out.
[00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:43.680]   You're married.
[00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:50.800]   And then maybe five years later, you buy another 10-year term policy.
[00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:53.600]   Let's say you first buy a half a million one.
[00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:56.640]   Then you buy another half a million one when you have your first child.
[00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:01.760]   Then you start having more children, and you just keep buying half a million
[00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:06.720]   dollar policies every five years until when the kids are, let's say, in high
[00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:07.760]   school.
[00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:12.880]   And it's really very expensive, high school and college, to raise a big
[00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:17.360]   family, and your life insurance has increased during that time.
[00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:24.480]   And then gradually, the terms disappear, and your life insurance winds down as
[00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:25.840]   your big family winds down.
[00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:28.400]   Well, that could make some sense.
[00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:32.320]   And the only negative to that that I would see is that there are kind of
[00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:35.120]   volume discounts for life insurance.
[00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:40.560]   The larger face amounts, you end up with a lower cost per thousand, and
[00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:44.160]   there's usually a flat cost or a policy fee for a policy.
[00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:50.240]   And therefore, almost always, a $1 million policy is cheaper than two
[00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:51.680]   $500,000 policies.
[00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:55.680]   Well, $1 million is cheaper than two $500,000?
[00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:56.400]   Yes.
[00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:57.040]   OK.
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:02.320]   Almost always that's the case, because basically, it's volume discounts.
[00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:05.440]   And it's economies of scale by the insurance company.
[00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:10.720]   Plus, the mortality on million dollar policies is slightly better for the
[00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:13.680]   insurance company than the mortality on half a million dollar policies.
[00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:20.880]   But yes, I mean, the idea of buying insurance as you need it makes some
[00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:22.800]   sense, and laddering policies make sense.
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:26.880]   But I wouldn't want to have four or five term life insurance policies in place.
[00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:31.360]   A couple might be fine, but going much more than that, you ought to probably
[00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:35.680]   think about combining some policies that you have into one larger policy.
[00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:36.880]   All right.
[00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:37.440]   Good question.
[00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:38.400]   Thank you.
[00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:39.120]   OK.
[00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:40.560]   Lady Geek, did you have a question?
[00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:44.720]   It's an observation.
[00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:49.440]   When Wayne was talking about annual versus monthly premiums,
[00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:53.120]   he used the word "effective rate."
[00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:58.080]   And to me, that triggered a keyword when you're talking about investments,
[00:31:58.080 --> 00:31:59.600]   because you mentioned 10%.
[00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:05.040]   And I don't think people understand the difference between monthly and annual
[00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:08.560]   rates, called APR and APY, when you talk about investments.
[00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:13.520]   So when someone's selling you something and saying it's only 10% per month,
[00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:18.640]   that will equate to a much larger percentage of premium per year.
[00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:19.920]   And so you're talking backwards.
[00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:23.920]   So I want to make sure that you're using the term "effective rate" to mean
[00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:28.560]   annual-- effective versus nominal, which is monthly.
[00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:31.200]   You're talking about the Excel formulas?
[00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:42.240]   Well, a typical-- I'm going back-- a typical factor for a-- if I have $100 annual
[00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:46.080]   premium, it'd be typical I'd have a $9 monthly premium.
[00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:53.760]   And that $9 monthly premium times 12 is $108 per year.
[00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:59.360]   So I can pay $100 one time, or I can pay $108 over the course of 12 months.
[00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:05.760]   And that works out to an interest rate of over 10%, if you kind of work it all through.
[00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:07.360]   It's not big dollars, typically.
[00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:12.480]   But it is-- I'm saving a little bit of money, but at an interest rate that ends up being
[00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:17.520]   10% or higher for paying $100 up front instead of $9 a month.
[00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:19.040]   Yeah, that's what I say.
[00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:23.200]   It's the mathematical-- it's the concept of this effective versus annual.
[00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:26.960]   Paying per month, it's going to cost you more if it's because of the compounding.
[00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:28.640]   That's absolutely right.
[00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:31.680]   It's because of the compounding effect, and people need to understand.
[00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:35.440]   And the Wiki has some examples on investments, how they sell you
[00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:38.320]   loans and mortgages using this.
[00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:40.480]   And so I'll leave it at that.
[00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:49.040]   Yeah, if an insurance company would sell you $100 annual premium versus an $8.33 monthly
[00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:50.960]   premium, that'd be the same thing.
[00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:51.920]   They don't do that.
[00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:55.920]   It's going to be a $9 monthly premium, and that works out to an interest rate of over
[00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:57.200]   10% per year.
[00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:01.520]   It ain't big dollars, but it is something that is there.
[00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:05.440]   On credit cards, it's a very big deal when they're 20% interest rates.
[00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:06.320]   Oh, yeah.
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:07.680]   On the credit cards, there's no doubt.
[00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:09.360]   The insurance companies sneak it in.
[00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:10.080]   You never see it.
[00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:13.520]   You've got to be a mathematician to figure out that they're screwing you.
[00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:14.640]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:18.240]   They say the Wiki will show how you demystify some of that.
[00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:18.880]   OK, I'm done.
[00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:20.320]   OK, thank you.
[00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:21.440]   Thank you.
[00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:21.940]   Alan?
[00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:29.120]   Yes, Wayne, I'm just curious, the difference if you just let a policy-- you want to end
[00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:34.400]   your policy, you said you just can let it lapse, whereas you could also just call the
[00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:36.720]   insurer and say you want to cancel the policy.
[00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:40.560]   Other than getting dunning notices for lack of payment and during the grace period, is
[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:44.880]   there any difference between letting it lapse versus calling them and canceling it?
[00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:51.600]   Well, let's say that I have a policy that I want to have-- that I come to the conclusion
[00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:56.800]   on January 1st that I don't want this policy anymore, and I'm on a monthly mode.
[00:34:56.800 --> 00:35:04.640]   If I call them up and say cancel, they'll cancel my insurance effective January 1st,
[00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:06.000]   and so I have no more insurance.
[00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:10.480]   If I simply don't pay a premium, then I'll have two more months of coverage.
[00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:15.040]   So if I'm unfortunate enough to die in the next two months, my beneficiaries will get
[00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:16.720]   their million-dollar benefit.
[00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:19.360]   That's the only effective difference.
[00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:24.400]   There's a required grace period, and the insurance does stay in force without payment
[00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:27.440]   of premiums for that typically two-month grace period.
[00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:30.000]   OK, very useful.
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:30.480]   One more.
[00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:35.200]   Are you going to address the possibility of selling a policy with viatical settlements?
[00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:36.560]   I don't know if you're going to address that at all.
[00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:41.120]   And what the situation might be that warrants that consideration.
[00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:47.120]   I'll touch on that now, and then we can come back to that after I finish everything here.
[00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:57.840]   The viatical company is making-- they're going to be looking at your in-force policy
[00:35:57.840 --> 00:35:59.440]   as an investment that they'll make.
[00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:03.680]   And so they're going to do an underwriting, kind of reverse underwriting on you.
[00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:10.240]   They're going to see how likely it is that you'll be dying at a certain time.
[00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:17.040]   And the sicker, the better, to be honest.
[00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:21.760]   And they'll want to see that you have a policy that's almost certainly a permanent policy.
[00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:26.000]   They don't want a term policy that might stay in force beyond the 20-year period and jack
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:26.800]   the premiums way up.
[00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:28.160]   They don't want to pay those high premiums.
[00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:37.120]   So selling a policy to a party other than the insurance company by surrendering, selling
[00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:45.920]   it to a third party can make sense financially for a buyer if the insured is old, if the
[00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:52.000]   policy is fairly large, $100,000 or more, and if there's premiums that are likely to be
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:55.680]   lowish going forward.
[00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:59.360]   I mean, they're trying to take advantage of the fact that you have higher mortality.
[00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:05.440]   Let's say that if you're really sick with cancer and likely to die in five years, you
[00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:09.440]   might be able to get an attractive price relative to what the insurance company would give you
[00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:11.680]   on a cash surrender by selling the policy.
[00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:16.080]   On the other hand, if you're going to hold on for that five years, your beneficiaries
[00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:20.880]   will get a lot more, because that biotical investor is going to ask for a rate of return
[00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:23.040]   of 10%, 15%, 20% on his money.
[00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:25.360]   He's not going to let that go cheap on you.
[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:29.760]   So it's better, probably, than surrendering the policy, but not as good as letting it
[00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:31.920]   just mature into a regular death benefit.
[00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:34.480]   That almost never works on term insurance.
[00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:37.920]   So that's one reason I would not have mentioned it here, because term insurance is sold to
[00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:39.600]   young people who, as a class, are healthy.
[00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:46.080]   And the terms usually don't go out past age 50, 60, 70.
[00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:49.040]   And there are, unfortunately, deaths in that range.
[00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:53.600]   But there's many, many folks that are well, well beyond age 60 or age 70.
[00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:56.480]   It makes sense.
[00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:57.200]   Thanks.
[00:37:57.200 --> 00:38:00.560]   Yeah, and we can come back to that if there's more questions when we're done.
[00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:02.880]   OK, Sonny, did you have a question?
[00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:07.360]   I shall ask that after the next section.
[00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:08.960]   OK, thank you.
[00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:12.720]   OK, Wayne, anything from the chat?
[00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:16.320]   OK, Wayne, you're on.
[00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:20.880]   OK, we'll go on to permanent life insurance.
[00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:25.600]   You remember I divided the insurance between term and permanent.
[00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:30.240]   Term is the insurance that is meant for less-than-lifetime protection.
[00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:35.840]   Permanent can be used for lifetime protection, with premiums that are usually paid for your
[00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:36.720]   entire lifetime.
[00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:41.920]   The premiums are much higher than term life insurance, because the insurance coverage
[00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:43.040]   extends to older ages.
[00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:49.600]   Remember I said earlier that the chance of your death goes up every year as you age.
[00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:53.600]   Well, it's a heck of a lot higher when you're 75 or 80 years old than when you're 30 years
[00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:54.320]   old.
[00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:58.480]   And when you're paying a premium that's going to be leveled for your whole life to cover
[00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:03.040]   your entire lifetime, you've got to pay a lot more when you're 30 or 40 or 50 to cover
[00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:04.880]   those deaths in your 80s and 90s.
[00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:08.000]   So premiums are much, much higher than for term life insurance.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:16.960]   And notably, most permanent life insurance policies have a savings element called surrender
[00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:21.440]   value or cash value, which grows on a tax-deferred basis that can be accessed through loans or
[00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:22.160]   withdrawals.
[00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:24.000]   And I'll talk more about that a little bit later.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.760]   The forms of permanent life insurance.
[00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:32.800]   There are basically these divisions.
[00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:35.040]   Whole life insurance, which is the original.
[00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:40.160]   There are several forms of universal life, which all vary.
[00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:44.480]   They're all kind of basically the same, except for how the cash value is invested.
[00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:49.200]   There's traditional universal life, index universal life, and variable universal life.
[00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:54.720]   And note that all of the above types of insurance, whole life and all the universal lives,
[00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:56.960]   they do combine insurance and saving.
[00:39:56.960 --> 00:40:03.440]   There's one special kind of permanent life insurance, secondary guaranteed universal
[00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:08.480]   life, that does provide lifetime protection with minimal cash value buildup.
[00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:10.720]   And I'll get to that on a later slide.
[00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:14.400]   Let's talk about whole life first.
[00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:19.600]   Whole life dates back well more than 100 years, well into the middle 1800s.
[00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:25.040]   Some of the earliest insurance companies in the US were selling whole life insurance.
[00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:30.160]   It's got fixed and level premiums, usually for the insurer's entire life.
[00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:34.640]   You're paying an annual or a monthly premium every month from when the policy is issued
[00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:35.360]   until you die.
[00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:39.360]   That cash value grows over time because of the level premiums.
[00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:44.240]   If you think about it, if you're paying a level premium for an unlevel death benefit,
[00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:47.680]   the risk of death goes up year by year by year.
[00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:53.200]   So you're having to pre-fund some of those higher death benefit costs in the later policy
[00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:53.920]   years.
[00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:59.040]   And so you're building up a cash value inside the policy that funds those higher, later
[00:40:59.040 --> 00:40:59.760]   death benefits.
[00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:06.160]   Because it's a permanent policy, it's often used for estate planning.
[00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:12.000]   Whole life also pays policy dividends that are usually used to buy additional paid-off
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   units of insurance or reduce out-of-pocket premiums.
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:16.480]   It's not counted as taxable income to you.
[00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:17.840]   It's not real dividends.
[00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:20.640]   It's called by the IRS a refund of excess premium.
[00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:27.920]   Whole life, if the policy is surrendered and it has a positive cash value, the cash value
[00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:31.360]   is paid out to the owner at the time of policy surrender.
[00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:34.000]   You can also get a policy loan.
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:37.040]   You can get a loan against the security of your policy.
[00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:41.280]   If you have a $10,000 cash value, you can get a loan from the life insurance company
[00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:43.040]   and get that $10,000 out.
[00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:50.160]   The policy cash value remains in place, but you're paying a loan charge, an interest charge
[00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:53.200]   to the insurance company for the use of that $10,000.
[00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:57.520]   And you have the right to go and pay back that policy loan if you want.
[00:41:57.520 --> 00:42:01.360]   If you don't pay it back, the insurance company will just net that out of the death benefit
[00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:01.920]   when you die.
[00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:08.400]   Notably, most whole life policies are issued by mutual life insurance companies.
[00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:12.960]   And two of the best are Northwestern Mutual, which is frequently mentioned on the forum,
[00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:17.200]   New York Life, also MassMutual, Guardian, Penn Mutual.
[00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:22.320]   Those are all mutual life insurance companies owned by the policyholders, not stockholders.
[00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:25.840]   They pay policy dividends out of the surplus of the company.
[00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:29.840]   And they are big riders of whole life insurance.
[00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:34.800]   Now to universal life.
[00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:38.080]   Universal life is a much more recent innovation.
[00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:43.200]   I actually was around in the early 1980s working in the insurance company when my company first
[00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:44.480]   introduced universal life.
[00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:47.200]   So the product itself is less than 50 years old.
[00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:53.760]   The best analogy I can give for a universal life policy is a money market fund plus a
[00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:54.960]   term life rider.
[00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:56.160]   So let me give you an example.
[00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:59.600]   The money market fund is really called an account value.
[00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:05.520]   So when you start off a universal life policy, you might pay a monthly or an annual premium.
[00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:08.240]   And there might be a percent of premium charge.
[00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:10.720]   But once that's paid, it goes into an account value.
[00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:15.760]   And that account value is credited with interest every month by the insurance company or some
[00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:18.880]   increase in value, usually interest.
[00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:23.920]   And then every month, the insurance company will deduct the cost of insurance for that
[00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:24.160]   month.
[00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:27.280]   There will be a schedule of cost of insurance charges.
[00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:31.600]   And they'll reduce the money market fund or the account value by the cost of insurance
[00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:34.720]   and also any rider fees or extra expenses or whatever.
[00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:40.720]   And so that really is a very solid analogy for universal life.
[00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:46.240]   A money market fund plus a term life rider and bundled together into one product.
[00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:48.960]   And it's got flexible premiums.
[00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:52.880]   If you choose to pay more, there's more money in the account value.
[00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:55.200]   The account value will earn more money, more interest.
[00:43:55.840 --> 00:43:57.600]   The policy will grow faster.
[00:43:57.600 --> 00:44:02.960]   If you choose to skip a few months or skip a few years, the policy will grow more slowly,
[00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:04.080]   but it'll stay in force.
[00:44:04.080 --> 00:44:08.480]   And it only lapses typically if that account value declines to zero.
[00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:12.800]   So you can skip premiums for a while, but eventually that account value is going to
[00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:13.600]   decline to zero.
[00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:18.960]   And so the policy is by no means guaranteed to stay in force for your entire life.
[00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:22.480]   You've got to pay the premiums to keep that account value positive and hopefully keep
[00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:26.640]   the account value growing so the interest earned can be on the account value can be
[00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:30.480]   a bigger and bigger factor in your overall policy.
[00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:37.600]   The account value is also available for policy surrenders and loans, very much like on whole
[00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:38.160]   life.
[00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:42.800]   And there will be explicit surrender charges in the early policy years that offset that
[00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:46.080]   to recover the cost of commissions and other acquisition expenses.
[00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:50.720]   So there are really three kinds of universal life that we'll talk about.
[00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:55.920]   The first version, which goes back to the early 1980s, is traditional universal life.
[00:44:55.920 --> 00:45:04.800]   And these three kinds of universal life vary primarily based upon how interest is credited
[00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:06.080]   to the account value.
[00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:11.040]   With traditional universal life, there's a declared interest rate by the insurance company,
[00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:14.560]   be it 3% or 4% or 5%, whatever it is.
[00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:21.760]   Many policies have guaranteed minimum rates of 2.5% and 3% per year, and many insurance
[00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:26.320]   companies reduced their credited rates to that guaranteed level during the last 10 years
[00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:29.360]   when interest rates were so low and they just kept them there.
[00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:33.680]   The interest rate can be changed by the insurer subject to policy guaranteed minimums.
[00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:38.480]   Some old policies issued in the '80s might have guaranteed rates as high as 5% or 6%,
[00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:40.720]   but those are a very rare commodity.
[00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:45.440]   And typically, policies issued these days are 2%, 2.5%, or 3% guarantees.
[00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:49.920]   But there's a declared interest by the insurance company every year, and the insurance company
[00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:52.080]   in its sole discretion can change those interest rates.
[00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:57.760]   I'll compare that to indexed universal life, which is a more recent innovation.
[00:45:57.760 --> 00:46:03.360]   With indexed universal life, there will be an external index like the S&P 500.
[00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:09.360]   And some part of that index return in a certain year will be credited to your account value.
[00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:14.960]   And almost always with an index policy, there will be a floor of zero.
[00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:19.680]   You can't have negative index performance that impacts negatively on your cash value.
[00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:24.320]   So let's say that the cap that the insurance company placed for this current policy year
[00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:24.640]   was 4%.
[00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:30.240]   If the S&P returned 10% this year, your policy would be credited 4%.
[00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:34.160]   If the S&P earned 4%, you'd make 4%.
[00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:37.120]   If the S&P earned 2%, you'd make 2%.
[00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:41.120]   But if the S&P lost 20%, you wouldn't lose anything.
[00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:42.160]   You'd be floored at zero.
[00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:50.000]   So you're giving up the upside of the possible interest rates in exchange for a downside
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:54.480]   guarantee where you won't have a negative interest credit or a reduction in your account
[00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:57.200]   value due to bad performance on the S&P 500.
[00:46:57.200 --> 00:47:03.520]   And the insurer has sole discretion to set the caps and the floors, the participation
[00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:06.880]   rates, everything else, except the floor is going to be floored at zero.
[00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:12.480]   So that's the way indexed universal life works with the same account value, money market
[00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:17.760]   fund, term rider type scheme that I described earlier in the last slide.
[00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:21.520]   The third kind of universal life is going to be variable universal life.
[00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:27.440]   Variable universal life, instead of the account value being invested by the insurer, it's
[00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:29.680]   really invested in mutual funds.
[00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:32.800]   And the mutual funds have fluctuating performance.
[00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:35.440]   They can grow, they can decline in value.
[00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:37.920]   And the policy order bears all the investment risk.
[00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:44.240]   You really is using that universal life policy as a pass through to get to the mutual funds
[00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:48.640]   and earning performance based on the performance of the mutual funds.
[00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:50.720]   And then you have the term insurance rider coming off of that.
[00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:54.640]   But that's the way the account value works on a variable universal life policy.
[00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:59.600]   So those three UL policies, all very similar in construction, but different ways that the
[00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:04.320]   account value can be increased by interest or equity credits.
[00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:08.320]   General comments on whole life and universal life.
[00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:11.520]   It's much more expensive than term life insurance.
[00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:14.800]   It's 10 to 20 times the cost of a term life insurance policy.
[00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:21.760]   It's not reasonable for my 30 year old breadwinner to buy the necessary amount of life insurance
[00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:23.520]   if it's all permanent life insurance.
[00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:25.360]   The premium is just too cotton, big and hot.
[00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:26.880]   They can't afford it.
[00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:33.520]   And so it's not, I don't know that many agents would try and sell a universal life insurance
[00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:37.040]   to sell a young family entirely on permanent life insurance.
[00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:43.120]   Another thing that it does, it provides insurance beyond the time that many families need coverage.
[00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:48.320]   If you think about that typical lifetime, you probably don't need to support your dependent
[00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:50.960]   children beyond their age 20 or 25.
[00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:53.680]   So you don't need to have life insurance.
[00:48:53.680 --> 00:49:01.360]   Typically, once you retire, once you've ceased having work where you're making money, once
[00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:06.880]   you've ceased providing explicit daily support to children, then you probably don't need
[00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:10.960]   life insurance anymore, or most folks don't need life insurance, but permanent life insurance
[00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:12.480]   continues on for your whole life.
[00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:15.040]   So it provides coverage for probably longer than you need.
[00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:21.680]   I'll also note that permanent life insurance is not a good short-term investment.
[00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:24.880]   The surrender value is less than the paid premium for many years.
[00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:31.840]   It'll often take between five and 10 years to break out where your cash value in a whole
[00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:37.600]   life or a universal life policy will even equal the premiums paid, much less be a return
[00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:38.400]   on your investment.
[00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:44.640]   So much of the early premiums you're paying are being consumed by commissions, by issue
[00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:46.160]   costs and other costs.
[00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:52.480]   And it is not a good short-term investment at all for a person because you'll be in the
[00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:55.760]   hole for many, many years after you buy that policy.
[00:49:55.760 --> 00:50:04.800]   Therefore, many bogleheads, and again, based on what I sense on the forum is consensus,
[00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:08.720]   many bogleheads believe that newly purchased whole life and universal life policies are
[00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:11.280]   attractive for only a very small subset of consumers.
[00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:17.680]   Permanent life insurance combines insurance and savings into one policy, and in my view,
[00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:18.960]   doesn't do either one very well.
[00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:23.040]   We don't buy auto insurance with a savings element.
[00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:25.520]   We don't buy home insurance with the savings element.
[00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:27.200]   We're buying pure protection.
[00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:32.320]   So it kind of alludes me as to why we should buy a whole life policy or a universal life
[00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:35.040]   policy combining insurance and investment.
[00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:40.480]   I, for one, would much rather have term life insurance and then save my money elsewhere.
[00:50:43.920 --> 00:50:49.680]   Now, what if I own a permanent policy that is 10, 20, or more years old?
[00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:56.640]   First, you could consider surrendering the policy if the insurance is no longer needed.
[00:50:56.640 --> 00:50:57.920]   That's always a possibility.
[00:50:57.920 --> 00:51:02.720]   But if you're looking at it as a possible investment, there are distinctly different
[00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:05.600]   situations based upon what kind of policy you have.
[00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:11.200]   We've seen a number of threads on the forum where somebody will have an old policy, often
[00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:17.760]   from Northwestern Mutual, that is 20 years old, and it's making a 4% return or so per
[00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:19.440]   year on the cash value.
[00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:24.320]   You can do a simple calculation if you have one of those old season whole life policies.
[00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:27.200]   What's my increase in cash value in a certain year?
[00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:32.960]   Reduce that increase in cash value by how much I paid into the policy and divide that
[00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:37.040]   answer by what my opening cash value was, and that'll give me a rate of return.
[00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:39.040]   How much did I make on my cash value?
[00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:45.600]   And often, these policies, after 20 years or so, are producing 4-ish percent per year
[00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:46.160]   returns.
[00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:51.200]   And on a fixed income asset that doesn't fluctuate in value at all, that's available
[00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:55.200]   for a loan or surrender, that's not a bad rate of return.
[00:51:55.200 --> 00:52:00.560]   And so there are many people that see those policies as a decent fixed income asset if
[00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:02.720]   they happen to have a 20-year-old policy.
[00:52:02.720 --> 00:52:06.480]   I would never recommend somebody buy a whole life policy and wait till 20 years to get
[00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:12.720]   that 4%, but if somebody bought one 20 years ago, has a 20-year-old policy right now, it's
[00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:17.760]   worth considering keeping it if it's a good 20-year-old from Northwestern Mutual or a
[00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:18.480]   similar company.
[00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:22.000]   However, universal life is a different situation.
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:26.160]   If you don't need the universal life insurance, I'd certainly suggest that you cancel it.
[00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:31.680]   Because what happens with universal life policies is that the cost of insurance goes up and
[00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:38.080]   up and up as you get older, and many policies have not performed as they were originally
[00:52:38.080 --> 00:52:39.040]   projected.
[00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:44.640]   I mean, back in the '80s and '90s, we would project interest rates of 8% or 6% or whatever
[00:52:44.640 --> 00:52:46.160]   on universal life.
[00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:50.160]   And interest rates have come down along since that time.
[00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:54.640]   And those policies have not performed and built the cash drive that was projected.
[00:52:54.640 --> 00:52:59.200]   So many of these universal life policies require additional premiums now.
[00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:01.360]   And if you don't need the insurance, why do you keep them?
[00:53:01.360 --> 00:53:03.920]   So I think it's a serious question.
[00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:09.040]   If you don't need the insurance anymore, why keep a universal life policy that's enforced?
[00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:12.640]   Because it's probably not a good investment when you consider all the costs and everything
[00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:12.960]   else.
[00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:20.720]   Now to a special kind of universal life called secondary guaranteed universal life.
[00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:22.320]   It's got various names.
[00:53:22.320 --> 00:53:25.760]   It's called guaranteed universal life, no lapsed universal life.
[00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:29.040]   It's a very specialized form of universal life.
[00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:35.840]   The primary characteristic of this is it builds very minimal cash values or no cash values
[00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:36.640]   at all.
[00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:41.840]   There are special actuarial tricks and things that happen in the policy that allow it to
[00:53:41.840 --> 00:53:47.120]   give you term-- instead of 20-year term or 30-year term, it can give you term to age
[00:53:47.120 --> 00:53:53.520]   100, term-like coverage with no cash value to age 100, and a very nominal premium, much
[00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:59.680]   lower premium typically than for a fully funded whole life policy or universal life policy.
[00:53:59.680 --> 00:54:02.080]   It's very delicate.
[00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:08.880]   You need to be paying all the premiums when they're due or that no lapse guarantee might
[00:54:08.880 --> 00:54:11.280]   cease and might not be available for reinstatement.
[00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:12.320]   But it is the cheapest way.
[00:54:12.320 --> 00:54:17.840]   If you have a true lifelong insurance need, it's the cheapest way for you to get permanent
[00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:20.480]   life insurance coverage.
[00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:24.400]   I got a private message yesterday from someone who was thinking about buying a second to
[00:54:24.400 --> 00:54:31.040]   die policy for he and his wife to provide for their children after they both pass away.
[00:54:31.040 --> 00:54:34.960]   While I might not agree necessarily that that's a great thing to do, if the person wants to
[00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:39.760]   buy life insurance, I'd tell them to strongly consider a secondary guarantee, second to
[00:54:39.760 --> 00:54:41.840]   die universal life policy.
[00:54:41.840 --> 00:54:45.760]   That's probably the cheapest way of buying their half million or million dollars or whatever
[00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:48.880]   of coverage, cheaper than a whole life, cheaper than universal life.
[00:54:49.600 --> 00:54:54.800]   So it's called secondary guarantee or guaranteed universal life or no lapse universal life.
[00:54:54.800 --> 00:55:03.600]   Now I'm changing topics really entirely to two specialized forms of insurance, juvenile
[00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:05.680]   life insurance, and then final expense.
[00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:09.520]   Juvenile, I mean, many years ago, I had children.
[00:55:09.520 --> 00:55:15.840]   And back then I was deluged with offers from Globe Life and Gerber Life and companies like
[00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:20.720]   that to sell me $10,000 or $25,000 of coverage on my young child.
[00:55:20.720 --> 00:55:26.480]   Those two companies, Gerber Life and Globe Life, particularly target this juvenile life
[00:55:26.480 --> 00:55:29.280]   market for $10,000 to $25,000 policies.
[00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:33.440]   And they might also give some options for buying more insurance as a child gets older.
[00:55:33.440 --> 00:55:39.440]   If you look at the forum, many BOGO heads would argue against juvenile insurance.
[00:55:40.080 --> 00:55:47.680]   Being totally candid and blunt, no one's depending on the income of a child for their daily living.
[00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:49.200]   I mean, the child does not have income.
[00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:50.400]   A child's an expense item.
[00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:55.680]   And if you have enough money set aside to bury a child, there's really no financial
[00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:57.840]   loss if a child were to pass away.
[00:55:57.840 --> 00:56:02.000]   There's tremendous emotional loss, but there's not a financial loss except with the cost
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:02.640]   of the funeral.
[00:56:02.640 --> 00:56:08.720]   So I'd argue that the money is probably better spent instead of putting it into a whole life
[00:56:08.720 --> 00:56:17.360]   policy by doing a 529 plan or some other type of savings vehicle like that for the child.
[00:56:17.360 --> 00:56:22.640]   Also, the purchasing power of $10,000 to $25,000 will be eroded over time by inflation.
[00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:27.040]   That'll mean nothing to the child by the time that child is 20 or 30 or 40 years old in
[00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:28.960]   terms of the overall portfolio.
[00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:34.560]   So I would not be in favor of buying juvenile life insurance, which is solicited by a lot
[00:56:34.560 --> 00:56:37.120]   of these companies shortly after your child's born.
[00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:42.480]   Similarly, for final expense life insurance, final expense, you'll often see on daytime
[00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:44.960]   TV ads for guaranteed issue whole life.
[00:56:44.960 --> 00:56:47.920]   You can buy this amount and the premiums will never go up.
[00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:48.880]   They're guaranteed.
[00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:50.160]   Your coverage can't be canceled.
[00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:56.000]   Those are really just small base amount whole life policies issued to older folks ages 40
[00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:57.760]   to 70 or older.
[00:56:57.760 --> 00:56:59.200]   There's a limited or no health questions.
[00:56:59.200 --> 00:57:03.760]   That's one thing that might be attractive to some people and a way that the insurance
[00:57:03.760 --> 00:57:10.320]   company can make out if there are limited health questions is that if the insured dies
[00:57:10.320 --> 00:57:14.880]   in the first two years, typically the death benefit is only the premium paid.
[00:57:14.880 --> 00:57:18.560]   It's not the full $10,000 or $25,000 base amount.
[00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:20.080]   It's just going to be the premiums that are paid.
[00:57:20.080 --> 00:57:23.200]   Many Vogelheads argue against final expense insurance.
[00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:28.400]   Also, the premiums are high because the people are old and the underwriting is very limited.
[00:57:28.400 --> 00:57:32.400]   Vogelheads have a general bias against whole life and arguably people are better off just
[00:57:32.400 --> 00:57:37.760]   investing the premiums in something else like just a simple mutual fund or maybe even a
[00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:38.400]   savings account.
[00:57:38.400 --> 00:57:41.040]   They'll be better off putting it into final expense insurance.
[00:57:41.040 --> 00:57:46.080]   Taxation of life insurance.
[00:57:46.080 --> 00:57:49.440]   Death benefits are free from income tax.
[00:57:49.440 --> 00:57:54.640]   It's just a wonderful thing that not only can this young breadwinner who passes away,
[00:57:54.640 --> 00:57:59.360]   if the spouse can get a million dollar death benefit, but the death benefit is income tax
[00:57:59.360 --> 00:57:59.860]   free.
[00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:07.120]   Now, if a person is in a very high asset position and estate taxes are going to come into play,
[00:58:07.120 --> 00:58:11.280]   an insurance policy might be part of the estate, but for the vast majority of term life policy
[00:58:11.280 --> 00:58:15.760]   holders, that's not the situation and death benefits are income tax free.
[00:58:15.760 --> 00:58:22.960]   Another factor about life insurance, the buildup of cash value inside of life insurance policy
[00:58:22.960 --> 00:58:25.520]   is not reported as taxable income in the current year.
[00:58:26.720 --> 00:58:31.920]   Sales people for permanent life insurance will always be stressing that point, that
[00:58:31.920 --> 00:58:35.440]   there's no taxation on the internal buildup of the life insurance.
[00:58:35.440 --> 00:58:40.960]   Now, if the permanent life insurance policy surrendered, there can be a tax bill depending
[00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:46.160]   on what the relationship is of your surrender value to your premiums.
[00:58:46.160 --> 00:58:50.320]   For example, you've got a $40,000 premium you paid over the years.
[00:58:50.320 --> 00:58:56.160]   Your surrender value is $50,000, that'll be a $10,000 taxable income in the year that
[00:58:56.160 --> 00:59:01.280]   you surrender, and you can defer that income by doing a 1035 exchange into an annuity.
[00:59:01.280 --> 00:59:02.720]   I won't go into the details of that.
[00:59:02.720 --> 00:59:06.960]   You could private message or ring it up for questions, but you can defer the reporting
[00:59:06.960 --> 00:59:10.640]   of that income or postpone it by doing an exchange into an annuity.
[00:59:10.640 --> 00:59:17.920]   Finally, how are life insurance policy holders protected?
[00:59:19.920 --> 00:59:21.200]   Life insurance is not...
[00:59:21.200 --> 00:59:25.040]   Life insurers are not covered by any kind of a federal insurance guarantee.
[00:59:25.040 --> 00:59:28.320]   There's no FDIC or something like that for life insurance.
[00:59:28.320 --> 00:59:35.120]   Now, if you look at your state guarantee fund rules, many states will cover $300,000 of
[00:59:35.120 --> 00:59:38.480]   death benefit and $250,000 of surrender value.
[00:59:38.480 --> 00:59:39.920]   The coverage does vary by state.
[00:59:39.920 --> 00:59:47.680]   When I did the similar presentation on annuities a few months ago, guarantee fund limits are
[00:59:47.680 --> 00:59:55.680]   a big deal for annuities because in many states, that $250,000 limitation on surrender value
[00:59:55.680 --> 00:59:56.400]   is a big deal.
[00:59:56.400 --> 01:00:01.520]   But here in practice, for life insurance, there have been very few problems with life
[01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:04.720]   insurance policies issued by insolvent insurers.
[01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:11.440]   The fact is that if I'm an actuary looking at an in-force block of policies, that in-force
[01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:15.680]   block of policies where all the acquisition costs and commissions have already been paid,
[01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:21.360]   and if I can take over those policies, which is a transfer of what the policy reserves
[01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:25.120]   are, then there is profits in that business going forward.
[01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:27.040]   It's a profitable thing for me to take over.
[01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:33.840]   Instead of the guarantee fund having to step in and provide funding, another insurer will
[01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:38.720]   actually pay the insolvent company to take over their life insurance block, move it onto
[01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:42.000]   their paper, and provide the policyholders full benefits.
[01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:48.160]   In fact, life insurance policies almost never lose in an insolvency.
[01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:52.160]   The guarantee fund doesn't have to come into play at all.
[01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:54.480]   So it's a different situation here.
[01:00:54.480 --> 01:01:00.240]   I had million-dollar policies with single insurers, even though my state guarantee fund
[01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:02.560]   limit is $300,000 of death benefit.
[01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:07.200]   I have no concerns at all about that, and it's just entirely different for life insurance
[01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:10.240]   death benefits than it is for annuity cash surrenders.
[01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:15.360]   So that fairly well covers the things I wanted to talk about.
[01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:19.440]   There are three Boglehead Wiki articles on life insurance.
[01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:24.960]   I think I dealt already with the question about viaticals or about selling your life
[01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:27.840]   insurance policy, but I'll talk again here for just a minute.
[01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:34.880]   If I have a permanent life insurance policy, that's really the only kind of policy that
[01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:36.960]   could be sold to a third party.
[01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:39.280]   Third parties don't want term life insurance policies.
[01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:40.000]   They simply don't.
[01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:42.160]   They want a permanent life policy.
[01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:48.880]   And if I'm a policyholder who's sick, I can surrender my policy, get the cash surrender
[01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:49.680]   value from the company.
[01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:55.920]   I can wait out the death benefit or keep on paying premiums until I die and the death
[01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:56.720]   benefit can come in.
[01:01:56.720 --> 01:02:01.680]   If I want to get more cash than the insurance company will give me, I might search out a
[01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:04.080]   firm that will buy it from me.
[01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:08.640]   And for them to see a good deal in buying it from me, I've got to be sick enough that I'm
[01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:12.080]   going to die fairly soon and they can predict that with some certainty.
[01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:17.520]   It's got to be a large enough policy to make it worth their while and they've got to get
[01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:21.920]   a good rate of return on their investment that they have in taking over the policy and
[01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:24.080]   paying premiums on that policy until I die.
[01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:28.560]   So it's certainly possible to sell your life insurance policy, but unless it's a permanent
[01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:34.800]   life insurance policy for over $100,000 and you're sick and you're fairly old, it's not
[01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:38.160]   going to be worth anything beyond the cash surrender value.
[01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:41.920]   So with that, questions.
[01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:44.480]   Thank you, Stinky.
[01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:47.440]   Do we have any questions from the chat?
[01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:50.960]   Anybody would like to raise their hand with a question?
[01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:51.440]   Sonny.
[01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:55.280]   Hi, yes, thank you for your presentation.
[01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:56.160]   I had a question.
[01:02:56.160 --> 01:03:01.200]   Someone was pitching me, and I agree with you also, the same way term and that's the
[01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:01.760]   difference.
[01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:06.320]   But someone was pitching me on an IUL, specifically Kaizen.
[01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:09.280]   I don't know if you've heard of Kaizen.
[01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:10.400]   They use leverage.
[01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:16.880]   It's like three or five times the leverage and then you make yearly payments for five
[01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:22.560]   years and then because of the leverage, you get larger payouts after 15 years that are
[01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:23.280]   tax free.
[01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:26.160]   I'm just wondering your thoughts on that.
[01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:28.320]   What was that word you used?
[01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:31.920]   Kaizen is the name of the product.
[01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:34.720]   A-A-I-Z-E-N.
[01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:36.400]   Can you spell that?
[01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:38.720]   K-A-I-Z-E-N, yep.
[01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:40.080]   Kaizen, okay.
[01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:44.560]   It's an IUL, but leveraged IUL is my understanding.
[01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:45.060]   Okay.
[01:03:45.060 --> 01:03:53.680]   I've heard of it, and my snap judgment would be two things I don't like, index universal
[01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:54.560]   life and leverage.
[01:03:54.560 --> 01:04:00.320]   They're trying to lever the tax code, I guess.
[01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:11.680]   But if you're taking a product you don't like and then further increasing your risk by leveraging
[01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:14.720]   it there, I'd just look carefully at your downside.
[01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:20.800]   If you wanted to, for example, to get some illustrations and send them to me, private
[01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:22.080]   message, we could talk.
[01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:24.640]   I'd be concerned about that.
[01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:29.760]   I'm sure they can show you some pretty fancy numbers with that.
[01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:32.960]   Because of leverage, with leverage is risk.
[01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:34.960]   That's all I can say about that.
[01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:36.480]   What if the IUL doesn't perform?
[01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:42.240]   I'm going to rant here something more about indexed universal life.
[01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:46.880]   This is not about the indices, about some abusive practices that are going on right
[01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:47.440]   now.
[01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:49.200]   I should have thought of this before.
[01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:55.440]   This came up from a person who posted in the last couple of days about an index annuity.
[01:04:57.040 --> 01:05:05.920]   The issue was on the indexing was that the company was showing a 20-year return on some
[01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:09.520]   pokey made-up index that was 5.5% or 6%.
[01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:13.600]   It looked like a really attractive return they've gotten on that index.
[01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:20.960]   But in the small print, they noted that this is a 20-year return they're showing to 2023.
[01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:26.800]   But in the small print, they said this index was not conceived or put together until 2021.
[01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:32.720]   And so all the years from 2003 to 2021 were made up.
[01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:36.640]   They did as best they could to go back.
[01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:43.440]   If we'd had the foresight to have this index, what would it perform like during 2004 and
[01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:44.960]   2005 and 2006?
[01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:51.440]   And I think insurance companies often work with financial providers of some type to conjure
[01:05:51.440 --> 01:05:54.880]   up indices that on backtesting, that's called backtesting.
[01:05:55.520 --> 01:05:58.560]   That on backtesting look good.
[01:05:58.560 --> 01:06:00.240]   They conform to what happened in the past.
[01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:05.040]   It's kind of looking at the results of a horse race in retrospect and saying, I bet on that
[01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:05.360]   horse.
[01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:09.600]   But the fact is that there's no guarantee that that's going to perform well going forward.
[01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:15.040]   But that's the way that they can get these ridiculous illustrated rates of 5% or 6% or
[01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:15.200]   7%.
[01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:23.920]   I'd be very leery in your Kaizen example if you had an accredited rate of 5%, 6%, 7%
[01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:25.760]   assumed on your IUL.
[01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:28.160]   I'd look to see on that.
[01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:29.120]   I'd ask them to run it.
[01:06:29.120 --> 01:06:30.160]   What happens if it makes 4%?
[01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:32.160]   What if it makes 3.5%?
[01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:34.480]   Does the whole thing collapse?
[01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:36.080]   Does your leverage collapse in on you?
[01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:38.560]   Because I'd be very concerned.
[01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:43.200]   And there are games being played in the insurance industry right now on these indices where
[01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:46.640]   companies are doing things that I think are just destructive to their behavior.
[01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:51.440]   There's been lawsuits flying around when policies don't perform as they're illustrated.
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:56.720]   And I'd be looking very hard to see in your Kaizen illustration, what is the interest
[01:06:56.720 --> 01:06:58.080]   rate being assumed?
[01:06:58.080 --> 01:07:00.880]   What's the basis of the index that they're using for it?
[01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:03.680]   If it's the S&P 500, then that's been around forever.
[01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:06.960]   But if it's something that was just made up in the last two years and backcatched for
[01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:09.280]   20 years, I'd be extremely leery of that.
[01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:16.240]   And that's a current example that has come up in an indexed annuity question on the forum
[01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:17.040]   in the last two days.
[01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:20.880]   Sunny, what kind of person tried to sell you this?
[01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:24.800]   Was it for investments or life insurance?
[01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:29.280]   Yeah, he's a life insurance agent and a friend of mine.
[01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:31.760]   But yeah, yeah.
[01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:32.480]   Gotta watch out for those grants.
[01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:35.600]   I wasn't going for it, but these are complicated investments.
[01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:40.560]   And when it gets too complicated, there's a lot of things, moving pieces that a great
[01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:41.680]   individual is not going to get.
[01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:45.200]   But I just wanted to get a better understanding from Wayne.
[01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:46.800]   I wasn't moving forward anyways with it.
[01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:51.520]   But I kind of wanted to get a better understanding, just because he makes a good argument, of
[01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:54.080]   course, because sales reps, that's what they do, their job.
[01:07:54.080 --> 01:07:54.880]   Yeah.
[01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:58.000]   I'd really look at that credited rate.
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:02.080]   I'd be concerned that the policy would collapse in a heap if they used a realistic credited
[01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:02.400]   rate.
[01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:03.360]   Yeah.
[01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:03.680]   Thank you.
[01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:04.560]   Wayne, we have a--
[01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:09.600]   Would you be able to put your email address in the chat?
[01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:15.280]   BirminghamBogleheads@gmail.com.
[01:08:15.280 --> 01:08:17.440]   And we can put that out.
[01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:21.200]   Maybe I can put that-- we'll figure out how to communicate that.
[01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:23.200]   But I'm the coordinator for a local chapter.
[01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:28.560]   And so I use BirminghamBogleheads@gmail.com is the email address that will get to me.
[01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:33.280]   Or you can private message me through the forum at Stinky, and we can communicate that
[01:08:33.280 --> 01:08:33.520]   way.
[01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:34.400]   OK.
[01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:34.800]   Thank you.
[01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:35.760]   Thank you.
[01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:36.720]   OK.
[01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:43.520]   Wayne, we have a comment in the chat from the Arctic Pineapple Corporation.
[01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:44.000]   Oh, my.
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:50.880]   And Arctic Pineapple said, "Also, with indexed annuities, they show you returns compared to
[01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:57.520]   the S&P 500 without dividends to make their rates look better than the S&P."
[01:08:57.520 --> 01:08:59.280]   Yeah.
[01:08:59.280 --> 01:09:03.680]   That's another issue with the term index.
[01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:10.560]   When they say S&P 500, people might reflexively think of the total return on the S&P 500.
[01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:15.200]   And the total return includes both price appreciation and dividends.
[01:09:15.200 --> 01:09:21.280]   But I'm unaware of any indexed annuities or universal life that pass on the dividends.
[01:09:21.280 --> 01:09:24.720]   But there may be one indexed annuity.
[01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:27.440]   But they are very far and few between.
[01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:33.360]   And the vast majority of these products do not include dividends in their return calculations.
[01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:34.560]   And so, that's exactly right.
[01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:35.760]   OK.
[01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:38.080]   Any other questions?
[01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:43.520]   Wayne, you want to turn off your screen?
[01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:45.760]   Or do you want to leave it on for any reason?
[01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:46.240]   That's fine.
[01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:47.520]   OK.
[01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:48.020]   Alan?
[01:09:48.020 --> 01:09:49.760]   Yes, Wayne.
[01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:53.440]   This is a peripheral area that you may or may not be familiar with.
[01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:58.640]   But I'm curious, nowadays, with the advent of genetic testing, people may have done 23andMe
[01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:00.080]   or other genetic tests.
[01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:06.400]   And my understanding, I heard peripherally that now there's some state or federal regulations
[01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:12.560]   that ensure that that data cannot be passed along and used for medical underwriting for
[01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:13.120]   insurance.
[01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:14.240]   Do you know anything about that?
[01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:19.840]   Are there any fears or concerns one must consider before getting such genetic testing?
[01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:22.480]   I'm a numbers guy.
[01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:24.480]   And I was never involved in underwriting.
[01:10:26.160 --> 01:10:31.200]   The people on the forum, I certainly note the people in the forum who seem knowledgeable
[01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:32.720]   about certain topics.
[01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:39.360]   And there are two posters I'll mention that I believe are both active insurance agents
[01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:40.960]   or insurance brokers.
[01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:43.760]   Chardo is one, C-H-A-R-D-O.
[01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:46.720]   And Brewdude, B-R-U-D-U-D-E.
[01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:50.080]   I know he's an insurance agent from some posts that he's made.
[01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:54.160]   And both those folks, in my view, follow kind of boglehead principles.
[01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:56.000]   They really are bogleheads.
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:01.520]   And I would pose questions like that to them because they're in the business of writing
[01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:03.040]   insurance and I'm not.
[01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:04.080]   I'd be guessing.
[01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:07.280]   But they would know from being on the ground and writing insurance.
[01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:11.440]   I respect both of those guys or girls, whatever, very much.
[01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:13.200]   All right.
[01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:13.600]   Thank you.
[01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:18.480]   In the chat, let me see.
[01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:22.000]   Great presentation.
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:22.800]   Thanks, Wayne.
[01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:24.000]   Well, thank you.
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:27.120]   The Arctic Pineapple Corporation.
[01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:36.400]   We owned a V-U-L and we own a G-U-L.
[01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:37.040]   We own both.
[01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:45.600]   And our V-U-L, the Variable Universal Life, was an interesting life insurance.
[01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:46.720]   We bought it years ago.
[01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:47.600]   My husband bought it.
[01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:55.520]   And it is invested-- there was what they called a subaccount, which had mutual funds in it.
[01:11:55.520 --> 01:11:58.960]   And we would select the mutual funds.
[01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:02.400]   And we selected five mutual funds or four mutual funds.
[01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:08.800]   And it had a premium that could go up if it had to.
[01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:10.320]   But our premium never went up.
[01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:16.080]   And over about 10 years, we decided to have it evaluated to see whether or not this was--
[01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:19.040]   because we had heard they were terrible products.
[01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:24.400]   So we sent it to a fellow who specialized in evaluating life insurance policies.
[01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:27.840]   And he told us that he knew it was coming.
[01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:29.760]   I had emailed him that it was coming.
[01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:33.760]   And he said to us, when he talked to us on the phone, he said,
[01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:37.680]   "I was just waiting to get your policy to see how terrible it was."
[01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:43.040]   And when he opened up the mail and he read it, he realized it was actually not a bad policy.
[01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:49.600]   But it was a rare policy, because it was sold to people who were not likely to pass away quickly.
[01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:52.880]   And he said they don't sell them anymore.
[01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:54.720]   It was a Lincoln Life policy.
[01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:59.280]   And it was interesting, because I would follow it along.
[01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:03.440]   He warned us to look for the cost of insurance.
[01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:08.960]   Like you said, my husband was getting older and older and older, and not younger.
[01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:11.600]   And the cost of insurance was going up.
[01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:15.600]   And I believe it went up on the anniversary of the policy.
[01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:19.680]   And when it went up, you could see that the insurance company
[01:13:19.680 --> 01:13:24.400]   was dipping into the mutual fund sub-account
[01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:30.960]   to pay for what our premiums didn't cover on the cost of insurance.
[01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:33.680]   You were dipping into-- I mean, they were supposed to.
[01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:35.120]   They dipped into there.
[01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:39.360]   And so fortunately, the mutual funds we had covered it,
[01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:46.800]   were able to keep the policy going and cover the cost of insurance,
[01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:50.240]   even during the recession, which was interesting.
[01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:52.640]   Now, I did notice that it went way, way down.
[01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:55.120]   And I was worried that the policy was going to--
[01:13:55.120 --> 01:13:57.600]   we were going to have to increase our premiums.
[01:13:57.600 --> 01:13:59.840]   We never had to.
[01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:01.520]   It lasted for 20 years.
[01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:06.560]   And then I could see, and we got a notice from them,
[01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:08.400]   the cost of insurance is too high.
[01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:10.080]   Your husband is too old.
[01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:13.040]   And therefore, you need to increase your premiums.
[01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:14.800]   But it lasted 20 years.
[01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:18.640]   It was an interesting-- it was interesting for us.
[01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:21.760]   And of course, we did not increase the premiums,
[01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:23.760]   because we didn't need the insurance anymore.
[01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:26.960]   Actually, we probably should have got rid of it earlier than that.
[01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:30.400]   A couple of comments about variable universal life.
[01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:34.400]   Yes, if you have good performance on your underlying assets,
[01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:37.200]   and you're appropriately aggressive on those underlying assets,
[01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:40.320]   and the stock market performs well, you can do OK with those.
[01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:45.760]   Where people get into problems with their universal life policies
[01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:49.600]   is that they skip some premiums, or the market doesn't do very well.
[01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:52.080]   And all of a sudden, those cost of insurance charges
[01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:54.800]   are chewing up more and more, and the cash value is not building.
[01:14:54.800 --> 01:14:59.760]   But on a VUL, if you can get a good head of steam going on those investments,
[01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:02.560]   then you can reduce the net amount of risk,
[01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:04.160]   the net amount of insurance that you have,
[01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:07.600]   reducing the charges there, and you can make a go of it.
[01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:11.040]   One of the things that I'll mention about variable universal life,
[01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:15.600]   quite often, those policies will have much higher expense charges
[01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:19.040]   on their mutual funds than what you might see outside the policy.
[01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:22.160]   So you might, for example, see a S&P 500 fund
[01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:25.120]   that you can get from Vanguard for four basis points,
[01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:29.200]   four 100s of 1%, that's being charged 60 basis points,
[01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:34.320]   or 1% or whatever within the variable universal life policy.
[01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:36.560]   You can't swap in your own mutual funds.
[01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:39.280]   You've got to work with only the panel of mutual funds
[01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:41.120]   provided by the insurance company.
[01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:44.080]   That being said, I'm glad that you had a good experience.
[01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:46.960]   And it sounds like a lot of it was due to the fact
[01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:52.960]   that you got into a policy at a time when the investment wins were behind you,
[01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:54.800]   and you made some decent money on your assets.
[01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:55.760]   Yeah.
[01:15:55.760 --> 01:15:56.240]   Good for you.
[01:15:56.240 --> 01:15:59.680]   Another thing we noticed was for a while there, maybe two years,
[01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:03.120]   we put it on a note, what they call a no bill.
[01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:04.400]   Yeah.
[01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:07.600]   A no bill means they didn't charge us for it.
[01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:10.560]   They simply dipped into the mutual fund account,
[01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:12.400]   the sub account to pay the premiums.
[01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:16.960]   If we had not done that, it would have lasted a little longer.
[01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:21.280]   But still, it would not have lasted at the same premium for too much longer.
[01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:23.680]   After a while, you have to increase your premiums,
[01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:27.200]   and it's just not worth it unless you, for some reason,
[01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:28.640]   really need the life insurance.
[01:16:28.640 --> 01:16:33.920]   In which case, your point is that the GUL is a better way to go.
[01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:40.160]   We also have a GUL, and that is a level life insurance till age 120.
[01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:41.920]   Yeah.
[01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:45.280]   With a policy like VUL or regular traditional UL or IUL,
[01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:48.480]   you really have two separate concepts going on there.
[01:16:48.480 --> 01:16:52.080]   One is the amount of premiums that you pay into the policy
[01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:55.840]   on a monthly or quarterly or annual basis, and that's flexible.
[01:16:55.840 --> 01:16:57.760]   You can pay in what you want, when you want,
[01:16:57.760 --> 01:17:00.000]   subject to the account value running out of gaps.
[01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:03.520]   On the other hand, you've got the cost of insurance charges
[01:17:03.520 --> 01:17:05.760]   being deducted from that account value,
[01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:07.520]   and that's going to happen every month.
[01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:10.880]   And the cost of insurance charges will be more as you get older,
[01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:13.760]   and they'll be more if your investments have not performed,
[01:17:13.760 --> 01:17:17.360]   and they've got a larger amount they have to be charging insurance premiums on.
[01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:19.760]   But there's really two separate concepts,
[01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:23.840]   the premiums you pay into the mutual fund or into the account value,
[01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:26.080]   and then the charges from the account value
[01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:28.240]   to pay the insurance company for its cost of insurance.
[01:17:28.240 --> 01:17:29.680]   Yeah.
[01:17:29.680 --> 01:17:34.800]   Okay, we have a question from the chat from Frank.
[01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:40.160]   Can you touch on how insurance is used for wealth transfer?
[01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:47.680]   I'm not so familiar with that.
[01:17:47.680 --> 01:17:52.080]   Frank wants to unmute and join in and provide more clarity.
[01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:57.120]   I can say that you're really not going to transfer wealth with a term life policy,
[01:17:57.120 --> 01:18:01.520]   because the vast majority of term life policies never pay out of the death benefit,
[01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:04.240]   because the lapse in the person's 50 or 60,
[01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:06.800]   and there's really not wealth, that's income replacement.
[01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:11.520]   So by definition, we'd have to have some kind of a permanent life insurance policy.
[01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:15.120]   And I guess I would just ask back to Frank,
[01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:16.960]   what are we trying to accomplish here?
[01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:20.320]   Um, you know, yes, I guess,
[01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:26.400]   if I wanted to buy a $5 million policy on myself right now,
[01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:32.880]   then I could pay a premium of whatever per year and build up.
[01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:37.840]   And then I'd have a $5 million death benefit for my children or my estate or whatever.
[01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:42.320]   But I might not, you know, you know, equal or better situation.
[01:18:42.320 --> 01:18:46.320]   If I just take those annual premiums I would have paid into that insurance policy
[01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:53.600]   and put that into equity mutual funds or some mix of stocks and bonds.
[01:18:53.600 --> 01:18:56.960]   You know, I don't know if the question is deeper than that,
[01:18:56.960 --> 01:18:59.200]   but it's got to be permanent life insurance.
[01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:02.720]   And I'm just wondering if it's more efficient and lower cost
[01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:04.880]   and not involving an insurance company,
[01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:09.120]   just to invest the money yourself into a broadly diversified portfolio.
[01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:15.440]   Frank, do you want to weigh in?
[01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:25.760]   - Okay, our next question was, I'm sorry, I had, yes, Wayne?
[01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:27.120]   What did you say? I'm sorry, I missed that.
[01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:28.160]   - Nothing.
[01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:31.200]   - Frank is on, sorry, can you hear me now? Sorry.
[01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:32.480]   - Oh, Frank, okay, hi.
[01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:35.360]   - No, I think you had it at one of your last slides.
[01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:38.400]   You just kind of put a link to it. That is a wiki discussion.
[01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:42.320]   I think it was transferring wealth.
[01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:47.520]   I guess there's some Bucklehead posts on that.
[01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:50.160]   And I've heard some stories about different types of,
[01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:52.480]   you know, obviously if you have a lot of assets or,
[01:19:52.480 --> 01:19:54.400]   you know, you have a lot of cash or whatever,
[01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:58.320]   and they want to try to pass it on to generational wealth,
[01:19:58.320 --> 01:20:01.440]   I guess is what they're calling it, you know, two years or something,
[01:20:01.440 --> 01:20:07.600]   you utilize a insurance vehicle to do that.
[01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:11.120]   - And that's probably going to be insurance for kind of the 1%,
[01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:12.960]   or the 1/10 of 1%.
[01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:16.640]   You know, I was really intending this to be more about
[01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:19.920]   the term insurance that is more useful.
[01:20:19.920 --> 01:20:22.480]   If we were to have a three-hour presentation,
[01:20:22.480 --> 01:20:25.440]   I'd probably become better versed on exactly
[01:20:25.440 --> 01:20:27.840]   how the extremely high-level, you know,
[01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:32.880]   high-wealth, high-asset market works.
[01:20:32.880 --> 01:20:34.320]   But I'm just not so deep on that.
[01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:38.960]   - Good, thank you. I wasn't expecting it.
[01:20:38.960 --> 01:20:41.200]   I just thought if you had it, you could just touch on it.
[01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:42.400]   But Doug, thank you, appreciate it.
[01:20:42.400 --> 01:20:43.680]   I'll look more into it.
[01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:45.440]   - And I appreciate your question.
[01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:50.080]   - Okay, we have a comment that my example is
[01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:52.560]   the perfect complicated insurance product
[01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:57.600]   that adds sequence of return risk as another variable.
[01:20:57.600 --> 01:21:05.840]   - Oh, your variable universal life policy has sequence of return?
[01:21:05.840 --> 01:21:06.000]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:07.120]   - And that is right.
[01:21:07.120 --> 01:21:10.880]   Yeah, if you had some crappy years early in your policy,
[01:21:11.360 --> 01:21:13.760]   you'd end up with a policy that's not performed very well
[01:21:13.760 --> 01:21:14.800]   in those early premiums.
[01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:15.360]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:18.400]   - And therefore your cost of insurance is higher
[01:21:18.400 --> 01:21:20.560]   and the policy starts to kind of consume itself.
[01:21:20.560 --> 01:21:23.120]   - Yeah, exactly. That's exactly right.
[01:21:23.120 --> 01:21:25.680]   Okay, we have a question from Ben.
[01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:30.720]   Any thoughts on specialty products like Coliboli,
[01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:38.160]   C-O-L-I-B-O-L-I or PPVUL?
[01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:46.640]   - Well, Coli is a corporate owned life insurance,
[01:21:46.640 --> 01:21:48.320]   B is bank owned life insurance.
[01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:52.720]   Those are not purchased by individuals
[01:21:52.720 --> 01:21:55.360]   or by most folks in Boglehead Nation.
[01:21:55.360 --> 01:22:00.400]   Coli would be often purchased on all the employees
[01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:03.120]   of a corporation by the corporation itself.
[01:22:03.120 --> 01:22:07.600]   And the corporation, because of the tax-free nature
[01:22:07.600 --> 01:22:09.840]   of life insurance buildup,
[01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:13.440]   the corporation can insure its employees
[01:22:13.440 --> 01:22:16.560]   or the bank can insure its own employees
[01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:18.160]   using an insurance vehicle
[01:22:18.160 --> 01:22:23.280]   and make a four or 5% return on their insurance policies.
[01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:26.960]   But it's not a product that would be bought by an individual.
[01:22:26.960 --> 01:22:28.160]   It'd be a product that would be bought
[01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:30.720]   by a corporation or a bank.
[01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:32.720]   And the point of view of the corporation or the bank,
[01:22:32.720 --> 01:22:36.720]   the treasurer or CFO or whatever would need to see
[01:22:37.520 --> 01:22:39.760]   if he has the funds to invest in this kind of a thing
[01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:41.360]   and if it's an attractive thing
[01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:45.600]   for the corporation or the bank to invest in with its funds.
[01:22:45.600 --> 01:22:50.880]   So that'd be my comment on Coli and Boli.
[01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:54.160]   My former employer writes both Coli and Boli
[01:22:54.160 --> 01:22:57.280]   and my former employer also bought a Coli policy
[01:22:57.280 --> 01:22:58.800]   on employees, including me.
[01:22:58.800 --> 01:23:01.680]   So I'm familiar with it from that point of view,
[01:23:01.680 --> 01:23:02.880]   but I've never priced it out
[01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:05.360]   and it's not a thing that an individual would buy.
[01:23:06.320 --> 01:23:08.640]   I'm not familiar with PPVUL.
[01:23:08.640 --> 01:23:11.120]   So two out of three.
[01:23:11.120 --> 01:23:17.600]   - Okay, are there any more questions, any discussion?
[01:23:17.600 --> 01:23:22.640]   Does anybody have any life insurance policies
[01:23:22.640 --> 01:23:26.480]   that they want to talk about, complain about?
[01:23:26.480 --> 01:23:34.720]   I will say that we were not too bright
[01:23:34.720 --> 01:23:39.040]   and that we did not buy more term life.
[01:23:39.040 --> 01:23:43.440]   We did not buy more term life policies when we were younger.
[01:23:43.440 --> 01:23:44.880]   And by that, I mean the laddering
[01:23:44.880 --> 01:23:47.120]   of the term life policies.
[01:23:47.120 --> 01:23:52.720]   - Well, I'm a big believer in term life.
[01:23:52.720 --> 01:23:56.080]   My employer, my former employer was a huge rider
[01:23:56.080 --> 01:23:58.640]   of term life for many, many years.
[01:23:58.640 --> 01:24:01.040]   And I mean, hearing the agents talk about it,
[01:24:03.120 --> 01:24:05.120]   it's not very frequent that somebody
[01:24:05.120 --> 01:24:06.720]   in their 30s or 40s will die.
[01:24:06.720 --> 01:24:09.680]   But being able to deliver that million dollar
[01:24:09.680 --> 01:24:12.720]   or $2 million check to the grieving spouse
[01:24:12.720 --> 01:24:14.720]   is just an absolute blessing.
[01:24:14.720 --> 01:24:17.840]   And there's no other financial product that can do that.
[01:24:17.840 --> 01:24:20.560]   Nothing else can provide that kind of a benefit
[01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:21.600]   by term life.
[01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:23.120]   And don't be cheap.
[01:24:23.120 --> 01:24:24.720]   Term life is so cotton picking cheap.
[01:24:24.720 --> 01:24:30.160]   When in doubt, round up, because it's inexpensive
[01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:32.720]   and because inflation will degrade the value
[01:24:32.720 --> 01:24:33.280]   of the policy.
[01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:34.640]   There's one negative here.
[01:24:34.640 --> 01:24:37.280]   It's my million dollar policy that I'm buying today.
[01:24:37.280 --> 01:24:38.960]   The purchasing power of that million dollars
[01:24:38.960 --> 01:24:41.280]   will be less as time goes on.
[01:24:41.280 --> 01:24:42.880]   And therefore, if it's a question
[01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:47.440]   of buying 750 or a million, I'd suggest a million.
[01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:48.800]   If it's a million or a million and a half,
[01:24:48.800 --> 01:24:50.160]   I'd buy the million and a half.
[01:24:50.160 --> 01:24:51.760]   It's not that much more money.
[01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:55.120]   And you won't, I doubt that your spouse
[01:24:55.120 --> 01:24:56.880]   will turn down the larger check if you were to die.
[01:25:02.120 --> 01:25:04.600]   Frank wrote in the chat, understanding
[01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:06.600]   every person's situation is different.
[01:25:06.600 --> 01:25:14.440]   Is there a sweet spot to buy like age by term life?
[01:25:14.440 --> 01:25:19.800]   Well, I'd say that it's not so much based on your age.
[01:25:19.800 --> 01:25:21.560]   It's based on your family obligations.
[01:25:21.560 --> 01:25:27.480]   I'd say that a 40-year-old with no dependents
[01:25:27.480 --> 01:25:30.040]   who's not married has no need for life insurance.
[01:25:31.040 --> 01:25:34.720]   I mean, they can choose to buy life insurance if they want,
[01:25:34.720 --> 01:25:37.520]   but there's no financial need for that 40-year-old
[01:25:37.520 --> 01:25:38.480]   to buy life insurance.
[01:25:38.480 --> 01:25:43.040]   But a 22-year-old who has a kid and a spouse
[01:25:43.040 --> 01:25:44.240]   has a need for life insurance.
[01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:48.800]   That person may not have a very big amount of assets,
[01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:50.160]   but they have a need for life insurance.
[01:25:50.160 --> 01:25:54.000]   And so I'd say it's more based upon,
[01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:57.600]   you should be buying that when you have a need for it.
[01:25:57.600 --> 01:26:01.040]   And that need is because others are dependent on your income
[01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:04.560]   or reasonably likely to become dependent on your income.
[01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:07.440]   If you're trying to have a child as a couple,
[01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:09.440]   that's not a bad time to do it.
[01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:14.560]   You don't need to wait till your spouse is nine months in labor.
[01:26:14.560 --> 01:26:16.880]   You don't need to wait on that.
[01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:20.240]   That's a sweet spot, is buying it when you need it.
[01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:22.740]   Alan?
[01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:25.780]   Yes.
[01:26:25.780 --> 01:26:30.560]   Wayne, I'm curious if somebody has a pre-existing medical condition
[01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:34.160]   that may make them rated higher risk and higher premium,
[01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:36.400]   is there a benefit to look at to other options
[01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:38.080]   rather than buying an individual policy,
[01:26:38.080 --> 01:26:40.560]   look at a policy through an affinity group
[01:26:40.560 --> 01:26:43.600]   or a trade organization, professional organization?
[01:26:43.600 --> 01:26:45.840]   Is there typically some additional safeguards
[01:26:45.840 --> 01:26:48.080]   to help you get coverage that route
[01:26:48.080 --> 01:26:50.640]   without paying the highest possible premium?
[01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:52.560]   Yes, certainly.
[01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:55.440]   Every comparison should be,
[01:26:55.440 --> 01:26:57.840]   what are my alternatives that I have here?
[01:26:57.840 --> 01:27:02.720]   If you could get insurance coverage from your employer
[01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:05.280]   a good bit cheaper than you can get it through the individual route
[01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:10.400]   because the employer is not requesting evidence of insurability,
[01:27:10.400 --> 01:27:13.600]   by all means, go ahead and take up the employer.
[01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:15.200]   If you were uninsurable,
[01:27:15.200 --> 01:27:18.640]   absolutely take any amount of insurance from your employer
[01:27:18.640 --> 01:27:21.120]   that you can get without evidence of insurability.
[01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:24.320]   You know, that's just the rational thing for you to do.
[01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:27.360]   Typically, it's cheaper to buy
[01:27:27.360 --> 01:27:30.080]   when you're providing your own evidence of insurability,
[01:27:30.080 --> 01:27:32.480]   presuming that you're in reasonable health.
[01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:36.000]   And a good 95% or more of the people are able to do that.
[01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:40.320]   But there is a small number of people
[01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:44.880]   for whom individual insurance is either unavailable
[01:27:44.880 --> 01:27:46.480]   or insanely expensive.
[01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:49.280]   And those folks seeking out association coverage,
[01:27:49.280 --> 01:27:50.960]   seeking out employer group coverage,
[01:27:50.960 --> 01:27:52.080]   that can make a lot of sense.
[01:27:52.080 --> 01:27:55.520]   It's unfortunate when we'll see sometimes posts in the forum
[01:27:55.520 --> 01:27:57.920]   with somebody who's had a bad health condition
[01:27:57.920 --> 01:28:01.520]   and just can't get insurance.
[01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:04.320]   Again, I've never worked in underwriting
[01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:06.160]   and I don't know the progression of things.
[01:28:06.160 --> 01:28:09.840]   It certainly is my impression that as time goes on,
[01:28:09.840 --> 01:28:12.320]   if you were rated at a higher level,
[01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:15.920]   if you had an unfavorable health condition and that's improved,
[01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:20.240]   for example, you have lost or are losing a bunch of weight,
[01:28:20.800 --> 01:28:24.240]   you had a cancer diagnosis and the cancer is in remission
[01:28:24.240 --> 01:28:27.920]   or it's gone and you're just waiting for the passage of time,
[01:28:27.920 --> 01:28:29.120]   that your rates,
[01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:31.840]   you might look better to an insurance company a few years out
[01:28:31.840 --> 01:28:34.960]   and you might be able to get a reduction in rates.
[01:28:34.960 --> 01:28:41.040]   And so having a qualified, competent life insurance agent
[01:28:41.040 --> 01:28:42.560]   to help you out at that point,
[01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:44.560]   if you're navigating situations like that,
[01:28:44.560 --> 01:28:45.600]   is really, really useful.
[01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:50.720]   - Yes, on the forum, BrewDude has often posted
[01:28:50.720 --> 01:28:54.480]   how there are different insurance companies
[01:28:54.480 --> 01:28:56.320]   that look at people differently
[01:28:56.320 --> 01:28:58.400]   and that you might be able to get a rate,
[01:28:58.400 --> 01:29:00.640]   a better rate from a different insurance company
[01:29:00.640 --> 01:29:02.240]   if you're searching around.
[01:29:02.240 --> 01:29:05.520]   And then also that you can wait a certain number of years
[01:29:05.520 --> 01:29:06.640]   and like you said,
[01:29:06.640 --> 01:29:12.320]   they are then more likely to be able to purchase life insurance
[01:29:12.320 --> 01:29:13.520]   at a more reasonable rate.
[01:29:13.520 --> 01:29:16.160]   - That's absolutely correct.
[01:29:16.160 --> 01:29:18.800]   The underwriters have well-refined skills
[01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:20.400]   based on actual experience
[01:29:20.400 --> 01:29:22.960]   as to how those things play out for the insurance company, yes.
[01:29:22.960 --> 01:29:27.440]   - Okay, more questions.
[01:29:27.440 --> 01:29:42.560]   Okay, Wayne, this was a very nice presentation.
[01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:43.600]   Thank you.
[01:29:43.600 --> 01:29:45.680]   Thank you, Helen, for coming and joining.
[01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:50.800]   Helen is here, our real estate agent.
[01:29:50.800 --> 01:29:57.360]   Let me, no more questions for Wayne.
[01:29:57.360 --> 01:30:04.160]   - Can I ask, can you recommend good books about this topic?
[01:30:04.160 --> 01:30:07.040]   Recommended books to read?
[01:30:09.640 --> 01:30:12.440]   - I don't really have any books that I'd read.
[01:30:12.440 --> 01:30:16.520]   I'd say that if you have questions about your situation,
[01:30:16.520 --> 01:30:18.200]   posting on the forum,
[01:30:18.200 --> 01:30:21.080]   send a message to me or post on the forum
[01:30:21.080 --> 01:30:23.720]   and just explain your situation.
[01:30:23.720 --> 01:30:26.840]   I mean, the questions you would have would be things like,
[01:30:26.840 --> 01:30:30.120]   how much insurance do I need?
[01:30:30.120 --> 01:30:32.760]   When do I need to have the insurance?
[01:30:32.760 --> 01:30:34.680]   How long should the term of the insurance be?
[01:30:34.680 --> 01:30:37.080]   What's a good insurance company?
[01:30:37.080 --> 01:30:39.720]   How can I choose between company A and company B?
[01:30:39.720 --> 01:30:41.720]   And those are the kinds of,
[01:30:41.720 --> 01:30:44.040]   I'm not familiar with any book that would really tell you
[01:30:44.040 --> 01:30:45.000]   in a Boglehead way.
[01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.480]   I think that there's enough folks on the forum
[01:30:47.480 --> 01:30:49.240]   that are knowledgeable about life insurance
[01:30:49.240 --> 01:30:50.440]   that I see posting.
[01:30:50.440 --> 01:30:52.120]   I think your best way of educating yourself
[01:30:52.120 --> 01:30:54.920]   is to form some basic questions like that
[01:30:54.920 --> 01:30:56.680]   and then come back to the forum and ask questions.
[01:30:56.680 --> 01:30:57.560]   You'll get some answers.
[01:30:57.560 --> 01:31:01.320]   I really don't have any source books to offer you there
[01:31:01.320 --> 01:31:03.720]   about kind of the basics of life insurance.
[01:31:03.720 --> 01:31:04.220]   Sorry.
[01:31:06.440 --> 01:31:08.760]   How about a life insurance for dummies?
[01:31:08.760 --> 01:31:12.360]   Is there such a book?
[01:31:12.360 --> 01:31:13.560]   I don't know.
[01:31:13.560 --> 01:31:14.680]   I would imagine.
[01:31:14.680 --> 01:31:15.480]   I would imagine.
[01:31:15.480 --> 01:31:18.840]   If there's no book, you should write it.
[01:31:18.840 --> 01:31:22.680]   Yeah, there's an idea for your retirement.
[01:31:22.680 --> 01:31:23.180]   Yeah.
[01:31:23.180 --> 01:31:25.640]   One more project.
[01:31:25.640 --> 01:31:26.140]   Thank you.
[01:31:26.140 --> 01:31:29.560]   Wayne, you know anybody named Matt?
[01:31:29.560 --> 01:31:32.760]   Yes, that might be my son.
[01:31:32.760 --> 01:31:34.200]   He says good info, dad.
[01:31:34.200 --> 01:31:34.840]   Good info.
[01:31:35.720 --> 01:31:40.200]   As they said in the forum, one of the little stinkers, huh?
[01:31:40.200 --> 01:31:44.120]   Well, he doesn't call himself that.
[01:31:44.120 --> 01:31:44.840]   I'll put it that way.
[01:31:44.840 --> 01:31:47.320]   I am the only stinky.
[01:31:47.320 --> 01:31:49.660]   Okay.
[01:31:49.660 --> 01:31:53.720]   So if we don't have any more questions,
[01:31:53.720 --> 01:31:55.640]   I will close this.
[01:31:55.640 --> 01:31:59.880]   But before you leave, first, a big thank you to Wayne
[01:31:59.880 --> 01:32:02.120]   for this presentation.
[01:32:02.120 --> 01:32:04.200]   First, we had annuities.
[01:32:04.200 --> 01:32:05.640]   Now we have life insurance.
[01:32:05.640 --> 01:32:08.040]   Wayne, what else do you know a lot about?
[01:32:08.040 --> 01:32:16.040]   You've hit the end of the internet, I'm afraid, with me.
[01:32:16.040 --> 01:32:17.420]   Okay.
[01:32:17.420 --> 01:32:21.400]   We, our next meeting, Vogelhead's meeting,
[01:32:21.400 --> 01:32:26.280]   that the life stages are going to run, will be in December.
[01:32:26.280 --> 01:32:30.600]   And we are going to feature the finance book, Harry Sitt.
[01:32:31.320 --> 01:32:35.560]   And he posts on the forum as TFB.
[01:32:35.560 --> 01:32:37.880]   He's a long-standing Vogelhead.
[01:32:37.880 --> 01:32:39.720]   He's been on the Vogelhead since the old days,
[01:32:39.720 --> 01:32:42.120]   since the Vanguard Diehards days.
[01:32:42.120 --> 01:32:46.440]   And he did speak this year at the Vogelhead's conference.
[01:32:46.440 --> 01:32:53.400]   Harry is going to speak about selecting your retirement home,
[01:32:53.400 --> 01:32:57.560]   the place where you retire, the area you retire,
[01:32:57.560 --> 01:33:00.280]   what kind of home you are going to get,
[01:33:00.840 --> 01:33:02.840]   how are you going to downsize.
[01:33:02.840 --> 01:33:05.240]   And he's going to do it from personal experience
[01:33:05.240 --> 01:33:06.760]   that he and his wife had,
[01:33:06.760 --> 01:33:09.720]   where I think it was like in three years,
[01:33:09.720 --> 01:33:13.720]   they had five homes until they finally got it right.
[01:33:13.720 --> 01:33:16.760]   And he's going to explain his thinking,
[01:33:16.760 --> 01:33:19.480]   his thought process, and what made,
[01:33:19.480 --> 01:33:22.280]   what was important to them,
[01:33:22.280 --> 01:33:25.080]   whether the money, the location, everything,
[01:33:25.080 --> 01:33:27.480]   how he analyzed it.
[01:33:27.480 --> 01:33:29.560]   It's a very interesting presentation
[01:33:29.560 --> 01:33:30.760]   that will be in December.
[01:33:30.760 --> 01:33:32.760]   The exact date is not yet set.
[01:33:32.760 --> 01:33:36.280]   So we'll post it on the forum.
[01:33:36.280 --> 01:33:57.880]   [Music]
