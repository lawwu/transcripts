[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   [Music]
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   Dr. Michael Reeves joins us again from the UK, filling in this week for John Piper.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   Pastor John once wrote about the role of theology in missions. He wrote this, quote,
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   "Pastors that aim to send missionaries must give themselves to building sending bases
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   that breed doctrinally deep people who are not given to emotional dependency on fads,
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   but know how to feed themselves on Christ-centered truth." End quote.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   So true. Doctrinal depth is essential for sustaining global missions.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   So, Michael, as a historian, when you look at church history,
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   in what ways has this principle actually played itself out?
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   What examples come to mind of robust theology fueling missions?
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   I think a classic example would be the life of the French reformer, John Calvin.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   He was a Frenchman. He was born and brought up a little bit north of Paris,
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   but he actually spent most of his adult life as an exile just over the border in Geneva,
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   which is now Switzerland. And it was an independent city, wasn't part of France,
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   and that was important. He couldn't have lived in France safely.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   But as a Frenchman, he always kept a heart for the evangelization of France.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   And what he did, so Calvin's known for his wonderful theologies, preaching,
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   his institutes, for example, which, if I can just mention, people are often scared of his institutes.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   And I find again and again when people dare pick them up and try them,
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   they're always struck by how warm and compelling and clear and pastoral he is.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   So a little recommendation for the institutes.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   But apart from the actual theological work, what Calvin did in his time in Geneva
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   was he set up a secret network in France with safe houses, hiding places,
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   so that agents of the gospel could be slipped across the border from Geneva into France,
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   there to plant new, sometimes literally underground churches.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   Now, to support them, he arranged for secret printing presses to be installed in both Paris and Lyon
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   to provide gospel resources for these new young churches.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   And the success Calvin had in this, in his home country of France, was simply astounding.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   Demand for the literature soon outstripped what the presses could supply,
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   and printing became the dominant industry in Geneva in an attempt to cope with that theological thirst.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   Now, within about half a generation, Calvin's efforts meant that more than 10% of the entire population of France became reformed.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   We're talking, it's hard to get the precise numbers, we're talking about some 2 million or more
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   gathering in hundreds of churches that Calvin had overseen the planting of in France,
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   about something like a third of the very influential nobility were converted.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   So within Calvin's lifetime, he had this long-held dream of an evangelical France,
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   and that began to look like a real possibility.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   It never happened in the end, because eight years after his death,
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   there was a politically inspired massacre of all Protestants, which shattered that dream.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   But you see the evangelization of France that Calvin helped to orchestrate under God's grace,
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   producing enormous effects. And it wasn't just France, in fact.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   John Knox visited Geneva and went back to Scotland full of that theological reformational vision.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   Other reformers went back to England. Missionaries were dispatched from Geneva to Poland, Hungary, the Netherlands, Italy.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   They even got to South America, to Brazil. And so Geneva became this nerve center for world evangelization.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   Now, here's the thing. Fueling all of that, fueling both the agents of the gospel
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   and all those resources being printed, was Calvin's academy in Geneva.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   It was a place where ministers would be trained up in the gospel, who could then go out and pastor people,
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   preach to people, and produce those resources for print.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   What Calvin had done is he set up something that was really unknown before his time,
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   which was not a theological ivory tower, theologians just living for their own thought processes.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   It was a seedbed of the gospel, and its success was astounding.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   It really was theology driving global evangelization.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   So Calvin was planting underground churches, and so many of these students knew that when they were trained,
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   they were going back into almost certain martyrdom. These are not missionaries going into safe cities and countries.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   No, absolutely not. So it varied from country to country what sort of level of danger students would be going into.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   But for example, the English students, when the majority of the English students were in Geneva,
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   they were in refuge from bloody Queen Mary, who was overseeing a Catholic counter-reaction to the Reformation in England.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   They had no idea at that time that anything might particularly change,
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   so there were a number of them seeking to go back to England.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   And the state of play in England at the time was if you stood up boldly for Reformation theology and didn't just sit on it quietly, you would be burned.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   Wow, that is a good message for a comfortable Christian like me to hear. Thank you, Dr. Reeves.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   Michael is the author of The Unquenchable Flame, Discovering the Heart of the Reformation,
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   along with the book Delighting in the Trinity, one of my favorite books from 2012.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   Mike lives in the UK and currently serves as director of the online theology website UnionTheology.org,
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   and he serves as senior lecturer at Wales Evangelical School of Theology.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   Tomorrow, Dr. Reeves will return, and I'll ask him why Roman Catholics pray to Mary.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   How did this tradition emerge over time?
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   I'm your host, Tony Rankin. We'll see you tomorrow on the Ask Pastor John podcast.
