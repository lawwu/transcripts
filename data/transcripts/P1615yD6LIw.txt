[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.520]   It may be the case that some tutors have been priced out of the market, but it's
[00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.960]   not clear to me that the most expensive tutors actually would be the best.
[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.840]   We, there is a bunch of empirical research on tutoring.
[00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.400]   And one of the questions they ask is like, what kind of experience
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.200]   level do the tutors need to have?
[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:21.240]   And it's interesting, like how far you get in tutoring efficacy when the
[00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.200]   tutor doesn't necessarily know anything.
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.820]   Just having like another warm body there actually contributes a very large effect.
[00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.960]   No, I mean, things get better as you get an expert.
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.960]   And I have a healthy skepticism of these studies.
[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.040]   Like I think part of the role of having Aristotle as a
[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.960]   tutor is communicating a worldview.
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.600]   It's not something that would show up on a, you know, a test or something
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.840]   that these studies would be measuring.
[00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.200]   And so having an extremely inspiring individual might actually be the
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.800]   important component and inspiring is going to be highly correlated with expensive.
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.600]   I think not necessarily.
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.040]   I don't know.
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.040]   That feels complicated.
