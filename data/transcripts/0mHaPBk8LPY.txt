[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.020]   Welcome, everyone, to Bogle Heads
[00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:15.040]   on Investing, podcast number 43.
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.600]   Our guest this month is Eduardo Ripeto, Chief Investment
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.760]   Officer of Advantis Investors and former Chief Investment
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.640]   Officer and Chief Executive Officer of Dimensional Fund
[00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.120]   Advisors.
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:37.560]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:38.240]   Hi, everyone.
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.040]   My name is Rick Ferry, and I'm the host
[00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.080]   of Bogle Heads on Investing.
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.640]   This episode, as with all episodes,
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.080]   is brought to you by the John C. Bogle Center
[00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:52.960]   for Financial Literacy, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.400]   that you can find at boglecenter.net.
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.280]   Your tax-deductible contributions
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.040]   are greatly appreciated.
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.920]   The Bogle Heads investment philosophy
[00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.320]   is to keep it simple, and that usually
[00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.560]   means starting a portfolio with a total stock market index
[00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.920]   fund, a total international index fund,
[00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.760]   and a high-quality fixed income allocation of some type.
[00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.640]   For most investors, this is all they
[00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.880]   need to achieve their financial objectives.
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.980]   Sometimes I'm asked, what's next?
[00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.680]   What's beyond a total stock market and a total international?
[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.200]   And my answer is, if you wish to take a little extra risk
[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.040]   in your portfolio for the potential of a higher return,
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.800]   then look at small-cap value investing.
[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.680]   But not just any small-cap value fund or small-cap value index
[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.200]   fund.
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.560]   You want a fund that's low-cost and highly concentrated
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.780]   in small-cap value factors.
[00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.480]   The company that pioneered small-cap value investing,
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.920]   using concentrated factor strategies,
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.440]   was Dimensional Fund Advisors, more commonly referred
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.320]   to as DFA.
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.120]   Eduardo Rapeto, our guest today, was the chief investment
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:13.440]   officer and the chief executive officer of DFA until 2017.
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.880]   Then in 2019, Eduardo joined Advantis Investors,
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.920]   a new company by American Century Investors,
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.680]   where he became the CIO and continued
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.720]   to refine factor strategies for their ETFs, mutual funds,
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.080]   and directed accounts.
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.600]   Whether you believe in this or not,
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.360]   or whether you want to include it or not,
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.840]   this is a very interesting discussion
[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.280]   as we go behind the scenes with one of the brightest
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.080]   minds in the industry.
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.480]   With no further ado, let me introduce Eduardo Rapeto.
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:44.760]   Welcome, Eduardo.
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.000]   I really appreciate you coming on the Bogle Heads
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.520]   On Investing podcast today.
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:49.400]   Oh, it's a pleasure.
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.640]   It's always a pleasure to speak with you.
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:52.400]   Thank you.
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.560]   We kind of go back a ways.
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.120]   I can remember being in your office at DFA,
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.080]   pleading with you to start ETFs at DFA.
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.760]   That was a few years ago.
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.920]   That's probably 10 years ago or something like that.
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:04.840]   I don't remember.
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:05.800]   It was a while back.
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.680]   Yeah, yeah, I remember.
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.680]   Anyway, now both DFA and your new company have ETFs.
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.440]   So before we go down that road, let's
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.040]   talk a little bit about your very interesting background.
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.160]   Go back as far as you would like to tell us
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.600]   how you got to go from where you started to where you are today.
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.800]   So yeah, I have a weird background.
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.200]   The first thing is I was born in Argentina.
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.880]   Argentina, if you know, was a developed market.
[00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.560]   Then it was an emerging market.
[00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.000]   Then it was a frontier market.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.480]   And I don't think it's a frontier market anymore.
[00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.120]   It's not even that.
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.440]   But I was always a geek, so liking numbers and whatnot.
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.680]   I studied engineering, then I got a master's at Brown
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.920]   in engineering, mechanical engineering.
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.040]   And then I got a PhD from Caltech here in California
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.480]   in aeronautical engineering.
[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.280]   Let me interrupt you because you didn't just get a PhD.
[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.320]   You won the Ballhouse Prize for the best PhD thesis
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.840]   of the year.
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.120]   I mean, you were a prodigy.
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.360]   But sometimes you have to be lucky in life.
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:12.960]   Let's put it that way.
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.160]   OK, all right.
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.400]   Be modest, too.
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.920]   Yeah, I was lucky.
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.520]   Look, I have an amazing advisor.
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:21.360]   And I was in an amazing school.
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:25.680]   And so look, this was a long time back in '98.
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.800]   I finished my PhD.
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.520]   And I was doing things that were extremely interesting.
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.960]   But my heart was not to continue in academia.
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.520]   I used to have a boss back.
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.400]   He was a mathematician, a PhD in mathematics.
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:49.880]   And he went to research in just mathematics into Wall Street.
[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.440]   And he always told me, hey, you will like this.
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.280]   You will like investing.
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.320]   And you will like the whole environment and the cutting
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.920]   edge science.
[00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.920]   Because a lot of the things that we study in science
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.840]   are very applicable in investment.
[00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.520]   And so I always had that bug in my mind.
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.600]   And so I had the opportunity to switch instead
[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.240]   of continue being in academia and become
[00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.200]   a professor and whatnot.
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.960]   And I switched.
[00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.920]   And so I moved into finance.
[00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:23.160]   And I got a job at DFA in the research group.
[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.920]   How did you link up with DFA?
[00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:29.240]   That's the most weird thing.
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.840]   A lot of things are random in life.
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.040]   So I was at Caltech.
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.600]   And DFA was looking for someone to work in research
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.040]   with Ken French and Jim Fama.
[00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.040]   And I applied.
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:41.440]   And you apply.
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:42.800]   And you cross your fingers.
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.880]   And I was lucky enough that they hired me.
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.520]   And yeah, DFA was small.
[00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.160]   I think that I was employee 107.
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:53.600]   And I think that at the time, DFA had around $25 billion.
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.600]   It was a great opportunity to work
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.720]   with some magnificent people in a small company
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.280]   where you were able to get involved in basically
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.320]   all the different aspects, not only research,
[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.480]   but the legal aspects of what you were doing,
[00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.480]   the portfolio management, the trading aspect,
[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:08.400]   the marketing aspect.
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.240]   So it was a magnificent opportunity.
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.760]   I was lucky.
[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:16.160]   And interesting, though, that DFA would look at you,
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.120]   given your background.
[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.400]   I mean, clearly, the forward thinking
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:24.000]   of the David Booth and Gene Fama, Ken French,
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.360]   who were both on the board of directors there,
[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:30.400]   decided with you, with no financial background,
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:34.480]   really, that you were the guy who they were going to bring in.
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:39.280]   And they kind of overstepped all the PhDs in economics.
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.120]   - Well, I don't know who else was applying, to be fair.
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.400]   - Oh, okay.
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.880]   - I think you're giving me more credit than I deserve.
[00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:47.280]   Look, I was living in California.
[00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.080]   My wife is from California.
[00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:50.520]   And the job was in California.
[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.480]   So it was a perfect match for me.
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.840]   And I was very, very lucky about that.
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:58.400]   And I was extremely lucky to work with talented people,
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.160]   like you mentioned.
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.840]   It was like doing a second PhD
[00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:03.760]   when you start working with Ken and Gene,
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:05.920]   because you have to read, read, read, and read,
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:07.480]   and do research.
[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:09.160]   But that's what you are trained.
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.920]   When you do a PhD from a top university,
[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:14.000]   no matter what's the field,
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.560]   the training is training how to learn
[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:19.360]   how to get to the cutting edge of the science,
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.520]   and then try to push it a little bit more.
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.360]   That's a PhD program.
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.560]   And so working with these professors
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.160]   was basically the same,
[00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:29.040]   getting to the cutting edge of the science,
[00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:31.960]   and then try to help pushing it a little bit forward.
[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:34.320]   And that's what I was doing.
[00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:36.520]   - And by 2007,
[00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:39.800]   you became the co-chief investment officer
[00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:42.440]   with David Booth at DFA.
[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:44.120]   And I think, if I'm not mistaken,
[00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.480]   that's probably when I first met you back then,
[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:48.440]   about 15 years ago.
[00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:51.960]   And then in 2009,
[00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:55.640]   you became the co-CEO.
[00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:59.480]   And at this time, wasn't DFA moving to Austin?
[00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:02.040]   - Yes, DFA opened an office in Austin,
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:04.800]   I think 2007, yeah.
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:07.880]   And so I told my wife, "Let's move to Austin."
[00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:10.240]   She agreed, so we went there.
[00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.080]   We have three kids.
[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:14.840]   So I became, I was CIO,
[00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:17.120]   and then became co-CEO with David.
[00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:20.320]   What's a great honor, no?
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:21.560]   - Sure, absolutely.
[00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:22.920]   And you got on the board of directors,
[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.720]   and you became a director of the mutual funds.
[00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:27.960]   But then in 2017,
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:29.680]   I've heard you use the word "retire,"
[00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:32.040]   you use the word "resign."
[00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:33.720]   I mean, you decided to leave.
[00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:34.560]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:37.000]   So my wife is from LA, no?
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.600]   Her parents are here, LA.
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:44.120]   So in 2015,
[00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:47.440]   before my oldest one started high school,
[00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:49.720]   the family wanted to move back to LA,
[00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:52.320]   because the grandparents are not getting younger,
[00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:53.440]   let's put it that way.
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:57.560]   And if we were staying in Austin,
[00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:00.480]   we would have to stay there at least for another 10 years,
[00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.840]   because we have three sons,
[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:04.880]   and we didn't want to move kids
[00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:06.800]   when they are in high school.
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:10.520]   So the family decided to move in 2015 to Los Angeles.
[00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:13.680]   And so I was going back and forth to Texas,
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:16.000]   on top of going everywhere.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.640]   I was putting 250,000 miles a year
[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:22.760]   between going to Texas and going everywhere around the world.
[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:26.720]   So you see, it was probably not the right balance.
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:29.640]   And I was never home, never seen the family,
[00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:31.400]   and so it was not the right balance.
[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:36.280]   So I basically resigned without any job in mind.
[00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:38.600]   You can call it "retire."
[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:41.800]   It was not a permanent retirement, I guess, but--
[00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:44.760]   - Well, you started doing research,
[00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:48.640]   one of your papers on value and profitability
[00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:50.800]   in international and emerging markets
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:53.680]   that you co-wrote during this period of time.
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:54.720]   But around the same time
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:57.080]   as it was being peer-reviewed and published,
[00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:00.400]   you then decided to take a job with Avantis,
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:01.600]   which was a new company.
[00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:05.760]   Now, did the company form because you were coming on board,
[00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:08.840]   or did it form and then you came on board?
[00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:12.240]   - So let me speak a little bit about how all that happened.
[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:15.200]   I was not working, but like you,
[00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:17.360]   when you work a long time in the industry,
[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:18.760]   you get to know a lot of people,
[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:21.200]   and people have magnificent ideas.
[00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:23.680]   And some people at American Center Investment,
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:25.200]   you know, in Kansas City,
[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:27.800]   that I know them for a long, long time.
[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:29.600]   They wanted to start something new,
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:32.240]   something that is more systematic, low cost,
[00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:33.360]   because there is a big need
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:35.360]   for something like that in the market.
[00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:37.920]   And they reached out if I wanted to help them,
[00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:40.600]   and they were willing to do it based in LA, where I live.
[00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:41.880]   So that's great.
[00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:44.920]   And one of the things that I have as a condition
[00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:47.720]   is that the investment strategies,
[00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:50.320]   let's call funds, ETF, what they were going to be,
[00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:52.000]   they have to be low fees.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:52.840]   That's what they wanted.
[00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:54.480]   They wanted to start something systematic,
[00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:56.960]   organized from day one,
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:59.920]   so that you have all the checks and controls on cost,
[00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:04.040]   so you can be low fee and still have a very good business.
[00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:08.160]   So I agreed to work together with American Century
[00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:10.520]   and start Avantis.
[00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:12.960]   So Avantis was going to be a standalone company
[00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:15.880]   where the people in Avantis own a piece of that,
[00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:19.360]   and American Century owns another piece of that.
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:21.080]   But we decided not to do that.
[00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:21.920]   Why?
[00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:24.760]   Because that was going to impose more costs,
[00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:28.920]   and that was going to make us have higher expense ratios.
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:31.680]   So what we did is we created Avantis
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:34.080]   as a unit inside American Century.
[00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:36.280]   So I'm an employee of American Century,
[00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:38.360]   but I have a business card that is called Avantis,
[00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:40.400]   because we manage money different
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.880]   than the traditional American Century manager.
[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:46.600]   And I report to the CEO of American Century.
[00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:49.280]   So we're a unit that is a little bit outside
[00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:52.360]   of American Century, but we're part of American Century.
[00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:56.320]   But all our operations, legal, compliance, HR,
[00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:58.400]   think about all the support functions
[00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:01.520]   that you need to have a professional asset management company
[00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:03.760]   are done by American Century personnel.
[00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:05.600]   - Yeah, and where is the trading done?
[00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:06.960]   Is it done through American Century,
[00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:08.240]   or are you doing it on your own?
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:09.160]   - Depends on what.
[00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:10.920]   And you know, when you do ETF,
[00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:14.400]   you know, a lot of the trading happens in-kind, in and out.
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:17.800]   So if that's the part, we do it on our own.
[00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:20.520]   Whenever we need to trade stocks,
[00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:23.160]   we work with American Century trading desk
[00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.440]   that has segregated our trades
[00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:26.800]   in a different way of trading,
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:31.800]   that we think we don't have to demand liquidity to trade,
[00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:33.680]   and we can be very efficient.
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:35.400]   - And you have different products.
[00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:39.880]   I mean, most of your money, I believe, is in ETFs,
[00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:43.760]   but you also have traditional mutual funds,
[00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:47.840]   and you have private individual accounts.
[00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:49.480]   But can you break that down?
[00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:52.520]   You've got about 10 billion under management right now,
[00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:53.640]   which is great number,
[00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:56.040]   just getting started over a couple of years.
[00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:57.600]   How much of that is ETFs?
[00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:58.960]   How much of it is mutual funds,
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:00.800]   and how much are private accounts?
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:02.600]   - The vast majority of the money,
[00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:05.800]   but the vast majority of the money is ETF.
[00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:06.760]   And why that?
[00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:11.680]   Because for most investors, an ETF is a better vehicle.
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:12.600]   And you know that.
[00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:14.840]   - Well, I know that, but why do you know that?
[00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:17.960]   - That's an inside joke, by the way,
[00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:21.200]   between Eduardo and me, so it goes back a long, long way.
[00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:22.200]   Because I spent years
[00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:24.120]   trying to convince dimensional fund advisors
[00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:25.480]   they should have ETFs.
[00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:33.400]   - Both of us know that ETF is by far a better vehicle,
[00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:35.720]   not only because of tax advantages,
[00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:38.600]   but also because you save on cost of different kind.
[00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:40.320]   For example, in certain cases,
[00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:43.480]   you don't have to pay some taxation when you buy securities,
[00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:46.920]   like stamp duties when you buy securities in other countries.
[00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:50.120]   So ETF is a much better vehicle.
[00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:51.600]   But for some investors,
[00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:54.920]   let's think about 401(k) plans, yeah?
[00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:57.720]   The ETF really doesn't work because of operations,
[00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:00.200]   so the 401(k) plan is different.
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:02.160]   So it works for the brokerage window,
[00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:03.880]   but not for the default options.
[00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:04.720]   - Correct.
[00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:07.280]   - And our goal is to try to help everyone
[00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:08.600]   with the right vehicle.
[00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:10.040]   We have no biases.
[00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:14.080]   - But I have looked at the performance of an ETF
[00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:17.240]   and a mutual fund, same strategy,
[00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:19.560]   same, might be small cap value, large cap value,
[00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:22.520]   whatever it is, where you have an ETF
[00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:24.760]   and you have a mutual fund,
[00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:29.360]   and there are slight differences in return between them,
[00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:30.680]   but the fee is the same.
[00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:33.280]   So maybe you can explain why that is.
[00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:35.320]   - Yeah, yeah, that's a great question.
[00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:38.400]   If you were running an index fund
[00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:40.640]   and you have pre-described holdings,
[00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:44.840]   so you have securities and weights in both of them,
[00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:47.520]   the performance probably will be the same
[00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:49.120]   with small differences.
[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:50.480]   But if you're running a strategy
[00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:53.240]   that is trying to use today's information,
[00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:57.240]   the performance will be slightly different between both.
[00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:58.080]   Why?
[00:14:58.080 --> 00:14:59.800]   Because a lot of the trading that happened
[00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:02.000]   in the mutual fund happened depending on
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   when the cash flows come, you know?
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.200]   If you give me money today,
[00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:08.200]   I'm going to invest in the securities
[00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:11.960]   that are great to have in the portfolio today.
[00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:14.640]   But if I don't have money today, I have money tomorrow,
[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:16.200]   I may have to wait for tomorrow to do.
[00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:19.800]   So you have the regular trading and rebalancing,
[00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:22.360]   but you have an effect of cash flows
[00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:24.760]   that forces more one direction than another.
[00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:27.320]   It's more, in a mutual fund,
[00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:29.520]   you always have to carry cash.
[00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:30.360]   Why?
[00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:32.920]   Because if you have a redemption in a mutual fund,
[00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:37.800]   I have to have cash to send it to you tomorrow, yeah?
[00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:40.320]   And I cannot sell securities tomorrow
[00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:42.960]   to raise money to wire on the same day,
[00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:46.000]   because settlement of those securities is two days later.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.280]   So you have to carry cash in the mutual fund.
[00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:51.600]   And not much, but you have to have some cash.
[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:53.480]   If that cash that you carry is not enough,
[00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:55.160]   you have to hit the line of credit
[00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:57.000]   in order to be able to wire the money.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.040]   So even though the strategies are the same,
[00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:03.520]   there is more difference in how you have to manage them
[00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:07.200]   in order to deal with the different settlement
[00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:09.840]   of clients' transactions, yeah?
[00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:14.320]   And if you think about that, the ETF is way more efficient,
[00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:16.720]   because the ETF, when you purchase an ETF,
[00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:18.280]   I receive securities in kind.
[00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:19.600]   So I'm always invested.
[00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:22.000]   And when you redeem, you receive securities in kind.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.880]   So the long-term shareholder don't have to bear the cost
[00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:26.840]   of the redemption.
[00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:31.560]   So there is always going to be a difference in performance
[00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:33.240]   between the ETF and the fund,
[00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:35.880]   but those difference should be small.
[00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:39.560]   Now, when can those difference become very big,
[00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:43.440]   or bigger, let's call it, when the market moves a lot?
[00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:47.080]   If you have a day that the market moves 10%, yeah?
[00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:52.080]   And you have a purchase that represents 1% of the fund,
[00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:55.680]   or 2% of the fund in cash flow,
[00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:59.160]   well, that money is not invested until tomorrow morning,
[00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:00.160]   yeah?
[00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:02.760]   So if the market moved 10%, right there,
[00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:05.200]   you can see that you have 20 basis points
[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:06.480]   in difference in performance,
[00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:08.720]   because you are carrying cash overnight.
[00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:09.640]   - And it's not your cash.
[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:11.240]   I mean, generally, if the investors are in it
[00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:14.600]   for the long-term, it's not their cash that's causing this.
[00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:16.520]   It's some other investor's cash that's causing this.
[00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:19.080]   - Yes, it's not the long-term investors.
[00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:22.120]   An ETF, the long-term investor is kind of protected
[00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:25.120]   from the actions of people coming in and out.
[00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:27.880]   In a mutual fund, no, you are commingling,
[00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:30.920]   and cash is coming in, cash is going out,
[00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:35.760]   so you are exposed to the actions of other shareholders.
[00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:38.440]   And that causes difference in performance.
[00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:40.400]   - Now, Vanguard has a unique structure,
[00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:42.040]   and I know they have a patent on this,
[00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:45.960]   but their ETF and their open-end mutual fund
[00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:49.760]   are just share classes of the same pot of money.
[00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:54.080]   And that patent, someday, I thought it was last year,
[00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:57.840]   but maybe this year, is actually gonna come off patent.
[00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:01.560]   In which case, is it beneficial or would it be beneficial
[00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:04.000]   for other fund companies to adopt that patent,
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.680]   where there's one pool of money,
[00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:09.320]   and then there's an ETF share class,
[00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:10.880]   and there's a mutual fund share class?
[00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:12.960]   What's the advantage and disadvantage
[00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:14.880]   of doing it the Vanguard way?
[00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:15.800]   - That's a great question.
[00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:17.440]   We thought about that, to say,
[00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:21.360]   do we want to have a big pot of money, big fund,
[00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:23.080]   where one share class is an ETF,
[00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:25.560]   and the other share class is a mutual fund?
[00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:27.680]   And we decided not to do it.
[00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:29.680]   Let's go through the logic.
[00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:32.400]   Let's suppose that you have a mutual fund share class,
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:33.640]   a mutual fund, yeah?
[00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:36.280]   Yeah, and with a mutual fund share class.
[00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:38.880]   And I decide to attach to that mutual fund
[00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:41.360]   an ETF share class, yeah?
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:45.080]   If you are the mutual fund shareholder,
[00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:48.640]   you are going to be very, very happy about that,
[00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:51.880]   because you have people coming in kind, in and out,
[00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:54.200]   dealing with your capital gains,
[00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:56.920]   and not imposing any cost on you,
[00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:58.520]   because they're coming in kind.
[00:18:58.520 --> 00:18:59.720]   It's not that they're giving you cash,
[00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:01.680]   and the portfolio manager had to trade,
[00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:05.320]   and the cost is spread out across all the shareholders.
[00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:06.600]   No, if you have a mutual fund,
[00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:08.960]   and you attach an ETF share class,
[00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:11.560]   the mutual fund shareholders will be ecstatic,
[00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:13.200]   will be very happy about that, yeah?
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:14.680]   - Right, I agree.
[00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:16.160]   - Let's go to the other case.
[00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:19.480]   I have an ETF share class,
[00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:22.000]   and I put a mutual fund share class on the side.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.120]   Will the ETF shareholders be happy?
[00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:27.560]   No, they will not be happy.
[00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:28.880]   Why?
[00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:30.880]   Because people coming in the mutual fund
[00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:31.920]   are coming in cash.
[00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:34.000]   And who pays for those transactions?
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.200]   Everyone, even the ETF shareholders.
[00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:40.000]   So the ETF shareholders pay their way in,
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.160]   pay their way out,
[00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:44.760]   but they also have to pay a fraction
[00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:47.480]   of all the people coming in and out on the mutual fund.
[00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:50.480]   So it's not really fair to them.
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:52.160]   And so on top of that,
[00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:54.160]   if you have the shareholders in mutual fund
[00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:56.200]   redeeming a lot of money,
[00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:58.560]   the ETF shareholder may take a tax bill
[00:19:58.560 --> 00:19:59.920]   that they are not expecting,
[00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:02.440]   because there are cash transactions
[00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:04.800]   in the mutual fund share class.
[00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:09.800]   So what we decided is to have different pools of money,
[00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:14.160]   one for ETF and one for mutual fund.
[00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:16.120]   If you want a mutual fund,
[00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:17.440]   you know what you're facing.
[00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:19.400]   You're having a commingled vehicle
[00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:23.760]   and you're exposed to the actions of other shareholders,
[00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:26.720]   externalities due to other shareholders.
[00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:29.200]   But you trade at the NAB
[00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:34.120]   and for some people that's easier.
[00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:36.920]   In a 401k, as you said, you have to do it that way.
[00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:39.160]   In a 401k, you have to do it.
[00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:41.200]   If you go to the ETF,
[00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:43.840]   you're going to pay your way in and way out
[00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:46.960]   when you buy in the market based on spreads and whatnot,
[00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:48.680]   but you are going to be protected
[00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:50.880]   from the actions of other shareholders
[00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:53.880]   because of the in-time purchase and redemption mechanism.
[00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:56.520]   So by separating them,
[00:20:56.520 --> 00:21:00.000]   we give people a pure benefit of one or the other
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.160]   and they can decide what's better for them.
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:04.480]   They are not going to be blindly surprised
[00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:06.280]   by the action of the other pool of money
[00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:09.800]   that is coming in and out in a different way that they are.
[00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:11.480]   - Okay, let's go into a different topic
[00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:14.640]   and that has to do with how you invest money.
[00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:19.640]   You invest money using factors.
[00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:23.200]   You're a quantitative factor investor,
[00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:24.760]   but before we get too deep
[00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:28.200]   into all these different factors, what is a factor?
[00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:33.160]   - So the factor basically is a way to understand
[00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:34.640]   the performance of securities.
[00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:38.640]   For example, let's suppose that small cap securities
[00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:42.720]   have a better expected performance than large cap securities.
[00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:45.200]   So a factor is the difference in performance
[00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:48.880]   between the small cap securities and large cap securities.
[00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:50.520]   - Okay, well, let me stop for a second.
[00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:53.040]   Why would small cap have an expected higher return
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:54.120]   than large cap?
[00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:57.440]   - Well, that's a great question because I'm going,
[00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:59.240]   let's just pick another factor
[00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:00.760]   and then we go back to a small cap.
[00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:01.600]   - Okay.
[00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:04.680]   - A small cap is probably the one that you cannot justify.
[00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:07.280]   A company, because just being a small,
[00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:08.720]   should not have a premium
[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:10.720]   because you can have a small cap company
[00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:14.000]   with extremely high price
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.800]   and that's not going to have a premium.
[00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:17.680]   So let's just speak about the value factor.
[00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:19.240]   That's easy.
[00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:21.280]   And what is the value factor?
[00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:23.520]   If you can buy a security that has low price
[00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:25.160]   relative to a fundamental,
[00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:27.560]   let's say the book value of a company,
[00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:29.600]   well, that company tends to have a premium
[00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:31.440]   relative to a company that has a high price
[00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:33.480]   relative to the fundamental, yeah?
[00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:35.960]   It's like you're buying something on a discount
[00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:38.360]   at a lower price, yeah?
[00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:39.200]   - Okay, but why?
[00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:44.200]   Why would a company with a low price to earnings,
[00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:48.120]   low price to book, low price to cashflow,
[00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:51.200]   low price to something or just low price,
[00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:55.680]   why would we expect that to have a higher rate of return?
[00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:56.680]   - That's a great question.
[00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:59.880]   So we have to start with the premise.
[00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:02.920]   It says we believe that the market
[00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:04.560]   is pricing all the securities
[00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:06.560]   and we cannot find a better price
[00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:08.560]   than what the market has.
[00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:11.440]   There's an assumptions of different kinds,
[00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:15.800]   but we also believe that there is no need for the market
[00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:19.240]   to put the same return for every security.
[00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:21.800]   Different securities will have different returns.
[00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:25.440]   Different returns will have different discount rates, yeah?
[00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:26.760]   - The discount rate is a factor
[00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:30.400]   of the perceived riskiness of a security, correct?
[00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:33.800]   - It can be risk or it can be something else.
[00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:35.680]   It can be behavior, you know?
[00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:38.240]   Some people just, for whatever reason,
[00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:41.920]   dislike a lot a certain set of companies.
[00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:43.560]   And if there is enough people
[00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:46.080]   that dislike a lot those set of companies,
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:49.480]   those companies will trade at a little bit lower price.
[00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:51.200]   And so that's a higher discount rate.
[00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:53.440]   - Let me push back just a hair on this,
[00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:54.640]   'cause I wanna make sure I understand it,
[00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:57.840]   because there's this thing between risk and behavior
[00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:00.280]   that always goes back and forth with these factors.
[00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:04.040]   But to me, if it's true that there are a lot of people
[00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:06.520]   who just don't like these companies,
[00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:08.440]   they don't like them for a reason.
[00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:10.800]   And isn't it true that they don't like them
[00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:13.720]   because they see more risk there and lower returns,
[00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:14.920]   and that's why they don't like them?
[00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:16.600]   So isn't it a fundamental factor?
[00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:19.560]   - It may or may not be.
[00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:23.920]   But the fact that a certain client that moves away
[00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:25.760]   from certain set of securities
[00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:29.880]   certainly will push the price of those securities lower,
[00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:33.200]   and that suddenly you have a higher discount rate,
[00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:35.680]   because if the price is lower relative to the fundamental,
[00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:37.200]   you have a higher discount rate.
[00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:41.120]   But let's go a little bit deeper in why there is a premium,
[00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:43.120]   because you're asking is why certain securities
[00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:46.240]   have a premium, a higher return than others.
[00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:47.080]   - Right, okay.
[00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:48.680]   - And so let's think about that.
[00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:51.280]   Let's suppose that I give you two options to work.
[00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:53.560]   So you work with us for one week,
[00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:57.040]   and if you work with us for one week, I give you $100.
[00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:58.480]   That's option one.
[00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:03.000]   Option two is if you work with us for one week,
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:07.400]   I give you $0 or $200, 50/50,
[00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:09.360]   depending on the weather of the last day.
[00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:14.360]   So 50/50 probability gives you zero or 200.
[00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:19.040]   The expected payment for you is the same, it's $100.
[00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:21.600]   So in one, you get $100 for sure.
[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:25.440]   In the other one, you get an expected $100,
[00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:27.400]   but you can get zero or 200.
[00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:28.240]   - Okay.
[00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:29.800]   - Will you take that deal?
[00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:31.960]   In general, you will not take the second deal.
[00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:34.680]   You will take the $100 for sure,
[00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:37.840]   because the other one, you can finish with zero or 200.
[00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:41.960]   So now I'm going to try to spice it for you.
[00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:45.080]   I'm going to give you zero or 250.
[00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:51.320]   So now the expected payment to you is not 100 and 100,
[00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:58.120]   it's 100 and 125, 50% zero, 50% of 50.
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.760]   So I'm incentivizing you with a premium
[00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:06.720]   to take the more risky outcome, yeah?
[00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:11.720]   At some point, if I keep on increasing the incentive,
[00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:15.480]   at some point, you are going to say,
[00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:17.960]   "I take the risky outcome."
[00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:20.960]   So whenever you have a risky investment,
[00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:23.360]   it's not that the expected outcome
[00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:26.320]   is the same as a less risky investment.
[00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:29.880]   The more risky investment will have a return
[00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:34.480]   that is a little beyond just the same expectation.
[00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:36.200]   You will have a premium,
[00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:40.440]   because that premium is what incentivize you
[00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:44.320]   to take a little bit of that risk.
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:46.760]   Because if you do a perfect risk adjustment
[00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:50.080]   and you have the same expected outcomes,
[00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:53.360]   you will never take the risky investment.
[00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:55.880]   So there has to be a premium, a little bit more return.
[00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:57.600]   So when you're speaking about security,
[00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:00.000]   how low price relative to fundamentals,
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.920]   and we're saying that's a value investment strategy,
[00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:04.120]   why there is a premium?
[00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:07.720]   Because not every security has the same expected returns.
[00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:10.800]   There is no need, there is no logic for that.
[00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:12.320]   So when you're looking for security
[00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:14.320]   at a low relative to fundamental,
[00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:18.480]   what you're trying to do is identify those securities
[00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:20.800]   that are having higher discount rate,
[00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:22.760]   higher expected returns.
[00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:25.040]   - And then put a diversified portfolio together
[00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:27.360]   of just those securities.
[00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:28.320]   - Yes.
[00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:31.400]   But you can see that when you were mentioning it,
[00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:33.960]   hey, you're saying low price relative to fundamentals,
[00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:38.720]   but what we're trying to do is try ways, systematic ways,
[00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:41.800]   mechanical ways, if you want to think about that,
[00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:45.200]   to identify what securities have high discount rates,
[00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:47.320]   because the discount rate is your expected return.
[00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:50.120]   So what security has these high expected returns?
[00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:54.760]   Now, every model is incomplete.
[00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:57.080]   The models don't describe reality.
[00:27:57.080 --> 00:28:00.600]   But what financial science has been doing over time
[00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:03.640]   is trying to make better and better models,
[00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:07.000]   trying to understand what variables matter most.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.880]   And that's why you have so many factors,
[00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:11.160]   because people start looking at different variables,
[00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:12.000]   and they're saying, well,
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.120]   this variable explains something about returns,
[00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:17.000]   and this other variable explains about other returns.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.600]   And I think you have like 400 factors now, yeah?
[00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:22.800]   I think there's a paper called "The Factor Zoo."
[00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:23.960]   - "The Vector Zoo," yes.
[00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:26.560]   - So the issue that we're facing now
[00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:28.520]   is there's so many factors.
[00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:31.000]   How we put all this together?
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   And there are many, many different people
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.520]   put this together in different ways.
[00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:35.920]   Some people do optimization.
[00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:37.920]   So let's put all these factors, optimize,
[00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:39.720]   and we see what happens at the end.
[00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:42.960]   But you know, as well as me,
[00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:46.840]   whenever you put a big soup of estimated numbers
[00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:51.840]   in an optimization, you get very weird outcomes.
[00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:56.640]   So "The Factor Zoo," so we've got,
[00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:59.520]   I talked about large versus small,
[00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:04.520]   and that factor was strong decades ago.
[00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:07.880]   But it seems to me,
[00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:10.720]   since the proliferation of small-cap index investing,
[00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:12.560]   in other words, became much, much easier
[00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:15.240]   to invest in a big, massive mega-portfolio
[00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:16.400]   of small-cap stocks.
[00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:18.640]   It wasn't so easy 50 years ago.
[00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:20.840]   It's easy now to do that.
[00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:24.720]   And that led to the term,
[00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:26.800]   well, led to factor decay.
[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:28.520]   In other words, it went away.
[00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:33.080]   It was easy to identify these small-cap companies.
[00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:35.160]   It was easy now to package them together
[00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:38.520]   into these index funds, mutual funds,
[00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:41.200]   extended markets, small-cap funds, whatever.
[00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:42.960]   And because of that, I believe,
[00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:44.200]   and I might be wrong about this,
[00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:47.200]   but I believe that caused this factor to decay
[00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:49.440]   to the point where there really isn't
[00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:53.120]   a big premium anymore, as you mentioned earlier.
[00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:55.840]   - What you're observing is absolutely right.
[00:29:55.840 --> 00:30:00.520]   Now, the question is not if it has decay.
[00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:03.760]   The question is, was it there on day one?
[00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:04.960]   - Oh, okay.
[00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:05.800]   - And why is that?
[00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:08.040]   Let's suppose that we go to the zoo one day,
[00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:11.760]   and we see that animals with stripes are zebras.
[00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:13.440]   That doesn't mean that every animal
[00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:15.360]   with a stripe would be a zebra,
[00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:19.480]   because a tiger would have stripes, yeah?
[00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:22.880]   So the fact that people observe that the small-caps
[00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:26.720]   up to '81, I think it was, have a premium,
[00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:31.160]   that can have been a random outcome, yeah?
[00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:35.040]   And the fact that we don't see much of that
[00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:38.760]   after that period, it may be because that's reality.
[00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:42.240]   And why I was pushing back in the small-cap premium,
[00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:45.400]   because when I was speaking about value,
[00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:47.400]   I was telling you, you have a low price
[00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:49.160]   related to fundamentals.
[00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:52.720]   You are looking for companies that have high discount rates,
[00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:56.760]   and any high discount rate will push the price down.
[00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:59.440]   So there is a logic there, yeah?
[00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:01.720]   - And just to clarify, a discount rate means
[00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:03.040]   you need to get a higher rate of return.
[00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:04.160]   It's a cost of capital.
[00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:05.240]   - Exactly.
[00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:07.800]   - The company has to get a higher rate of return
[00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:09.200]   for you to invest in that company,
[00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:12.640]   because you perceive, true or not,
[00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:14.360]   you perceive that there's more risk there,
[00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:16.480]   so you need to get a higher rate of return.
[00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:18.400]   - Yeah, if a company is going to produce
[00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:20.080]   a dollar in the future,
[00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:22.040]   you're not going to pay that dollar in the future
[00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:23.840]   with the dollar today.
[00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:26.320]   You're going to pay 70 cents today
[00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:27.520]   to get a dollar in the future,
[00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:30.000]   50 cents today to get a dollar in the future.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.280]   So the lower the number that I'm paying today
[00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:36.320]   for a dollar in the future is the higher discount rate,
[00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:37.160]   higher discount rate.
[00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:39.080]   So when you have a strategist that is trying
[00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:42.320]   to buy low-priced securities related to fundamentals,
[00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:45.080]   what you are really trying to capture
[00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:46.480]   is that high discount rate,
[00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:50.800]   that higher expected return due to the low price today.
[00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:53.600]   But if I tell you you are buying small caps,
[00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:56.200]   that is nothing that tells you
[00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:59.720]   that a small cap security can have a premium.
[00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:01.680]   If not, you can divide a large company
[00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:05.600]   in a bunch of pieces, and suddenly you have a premium.
[00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:07.440]   And more logically,
[00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:10.760]   let's suppose that you have a small cap company, yeah?
[00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:12.560]   If I have that small cap company,
[00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:16.360]   and that company has a very, very high price
[00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:18.520]   relative to fundamentals,
[00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:20.360]   that company should not have a premium
[00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:25.040]   because the price is too high related to fundamentals.
[00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:28.600]   So a small cap premium is highly debatable.
[00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:30.080]   Let's put it that way.
[00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:31.520]   - Well, let's go ahead and then move on
[00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:33.160]   to some other factors,
[00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:35.640]   because we talked about small cap
[00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:37.480]   potentially not being there anymore,
[00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:39.240]   or maybe it wasn't there to begin with.
[00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:41.120]   We talked about the value factor,
[00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:43.600]   price to book, price to some fundamental.
[00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:46.280]   You also, at your company,
[00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:49.240]   are looking at profitability as a factor.
[00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:51.080]   So tell us about profitability.
[00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:52.360]   - Yeah, that's a great question.
[00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:55.360]   So imagine that you are going to buy a company.
[00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:57.440]   How much you're going to pay for that company?
[00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:00.040]   You know, I'm buying Rick's company.
[00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:01.000]   How much I have to pay?
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:02.520]   Well, I have to pay for the equity
[00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:04.800]   that you have in your company, yeah?
[00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:07.720]   But I also have to pay for your cash flows.
[00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:09.720]   But since your cash flows are in the future
[00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:11.040]   and they're uncertain,
[00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:13.160]   I'm going to discount those future
[00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:15.120]   and I'm going to pay less today
[00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:16.320]   for those future cash flows
[00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:19.520]   than the value of those future cash flows.
[00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:21.480]   So the price that I'm paying for your company
[00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:24.160]   is your equity plus a discounted value
[00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:26.720]   of your future cash flows, yeah?
[00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:31.720]   So remember, what I'm interested is in that discount rate.
[00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:33.560]   Yeah?
[00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:35.440]   And what variables I know?
[00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:36.280]   I know the price
[00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:39.000]   because Bloomberg tells me the price every minute.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.800]   I can have a proxy for the equity in the company
[00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:45.080]   and I can have a proxy for the cash flows of the company.
[00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:46.680]   And these three variables,
[00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:48.560]   because of the valuation framework
[00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:49.960]   that I mentioned with you,
[00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:52.800]   are related to the discount rate,
[00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:54.880]   to the expected returns.
[00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:58.000]   A company that has higher expected returns
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   will have a lower price for the same equity value
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.640]   and for the same cash flow expectations
[00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:09.000]   than a company that has lower expected returns.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:10.520]   So the higher the expected returns,
[00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:12.080]   the lower the price,
[00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:14.600]   keeping the other two variables constant,
[00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:17.600]   keeping the equity and the cash flows.
[00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:21.640]   So I need to take into account not only the equity
[00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:24.520]   that I can use book value as a proxy for equity,
[00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:27.240]   I also need to take into account
[00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:28.320]   the cash flows of the company.
[00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:31.360]   I have to take both set of financials,
[00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:34.160]   the balance sheet and the income statement,
[00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:36.120]   both set of financials
[00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:39.840]   to identify what companies have high discount rate,
[00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:41.280]   high expected returns.
[00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:45.040]   - When you're selecting the securities then for your funds,
[00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:46.560]   is it a fixed formula
[00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:50.760]   where you're using some percentage of book value,
[00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:54.920]   some percentage of profitability together in your model?
[00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:58.360]   Or is it a variable thing where it moves?
[00:34:58.360 --> 00:34:59.760]   - No, it's fixed, it's fixed.
[00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:03.080]   So look, there is enough uncertainty in life
[00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:04.800]   that if you have it fixed,
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:06.800]   it's already there is uncertainty
[00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:08.720]   to add a variable component.
[00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:12.120]   There is no way for us to have so much precision.
[00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:17.120]   So we want to use the main drivers of selecting securities
[00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:21.360]   that are how much money the company is making,
[00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:23.280]   what's the equity position of the company,
[00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:26.360]   what's the price related to these two variables.
[00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:27.720]   And once we have that,
[00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:30.280]   we have enough information to put together
[00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:32.480]   a well diversified portfolio
[00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:36.520]   that in our opinion has high expected returns.
[00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:39.280]   Trying to be more clever than that
[00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:41.520]   and just changing the weight of the security
[00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:43.880]   with market conditions or the factors
[00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:45.720]   or the components with market conditions
[00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:47.120]   or anything else,
[00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:51.920]   is just adding noise with not really known outcome.
[00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:54.200]   - So I'm gonna say one thing,
[00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:55.640]   but then I'm gonna move right on to something else.
[00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:57.600]   So what I was getting at was
[00:35:57.600 --> 00:36:00.400]   you don't do what's called factor rotation,
[00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:01.920]   where you're trying to go from one factor
[00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:03.880]   to another, to another, to another.
[00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:04.720]   - No, no.
[00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:08.000]   - Companies are very hot on doing factor rotation.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.120]   And they're saying that,
[00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:11.600]   well, if we move at this time from this factor
[00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:13.400]   to that factor, to over to this factor,
[00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:16.440]   that somehow some way they're gonna get an excess return
[00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:18.600]   from rotating their portfolio around
[00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:20.560]   or highlighting different factors at different times.
[00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:22.720]   And you don't find any value in that at all.
[00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:25.120]   - No, that's unpredicted where the market is going to be,
[00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:25.960]   it's the same.
[00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:29.240]   If you can predict the performance of a given factor,
[00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:30.080]   it's the same as saying
[00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:31.800]   you can predict the performance of the market.
[00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:34.000]   Imagine who we could do that.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:34.840]   That would be great,
[00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:37.680]   but the markets, that's not how it works.
[00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:39.600]   The performance of market is unpredictable
[00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:42.280]   because there are news that we don't even know
[00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:44.320]   that they're coming and they will come.
[00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:45.320]   I don't know what will be,
[00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:47.960]   but it will come, something new tomorrow.
[00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:50.040]   - So you have your list then,
[00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:51.320]   you come up with your portfolio
[00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:53.640]   of what you would like to buy.
[00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:54.720]   But there's another factor
[00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:57.560]   that we haven't talked about yet, it's called momentum.
[00:36:57.560 --> 00:37:00.000]   And this is looking at the price
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:04.400]   and seeing if it's moving down or moving up.
[00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:07.400]   And we don't wanna try to catch a falling knife
[00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:12.240]   is a phrase that we hear often with quantitative analysis.
[00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:15.120]   So could you talk about how you use momentum
[00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:17.760]   in your portfolio management?
[00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:20.280]   - Yeah, so momentum is fascinating.
[00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:22.880]   It's a little bit like a small caps.
[00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:24.240]   When I was telling you small caps,
[00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:27.040]   there is no logic for existing in small caps.
[00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:30.280]   There is a logic while the premiums are small,
[00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:31.720]   larger than small caps.
[00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:33.840]   Small, the value premium in small cap
[00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:36.160]   is larger than the value premium in large cap.
[00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:37.720]   There is a logic for that.
[00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:39.320]   But the existence of a small cap premium,
[00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:40.200]   there is no logic.
[00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:41.360]   For momentum, it's the same.
[00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:44.200]   Momentum is something that we observe,
[00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:46.200]   but we don't understand why it happens.
[00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:48.800]   And there are two competing visions of why that happens.
[00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:50.400]   So what is momentum?
[00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:54.560]   A security has extremely bad performance,
[00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:56.080]   will continue to have,
[00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:58.920]   for some short period of time, bad performance.
[00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:01.560]   And a security has extremely good performance,
[00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:03.040]   will continue to have,
[00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:06.000]   for some short period of time, good performance.
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   So how do we use momentum?
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.760]   If we have a value strategy,
[00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:13.640]   we're buying security at a low price, yeah?
[00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:18.240]   How will the security becomes low price?
[00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:20.560]   One probability is because the price is going down.
[00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:23.200]   The security has very bad performance.
[00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:27.240]   Well, we can go and buy the security immediately,
[00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:30.480]   or you can say, wait, don't buy it now.
[00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:33.680]   Wait a little bit until the price stabilizes.
[00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:35.040]   And so that's what we do.
[00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:37.160]   We decide not to buy immediately,
[00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:39.000]   not to jump into this security
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.200]   that have extremely bad performance.
[00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:43.080]   And we decide to wait a little bit
[00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:45.160]   until the price stabilizes.
[00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:47.920]   And so we try to prevent buying securities
[00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:50.160]   in downward momentum, yeah?
[00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:52.320]   The opposite for upward momentum.
[00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:55.880]   If you have a security that is a small value, for example,
[00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:57.400]   and it's an upward momentum,
[00:38:57.400 --> 00:39:01.520]   we are willing to slightly overweight that security.
[00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:04.080]   And if the security starts going up in price,
[00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:05.520]   and instead of being a small cap,
[00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:09.120]   now becomes a mid cap security,
[00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:10.800]   instead of sell it immediately,
[00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:13.240]   we may be willing to hold it a little bit longer.
[00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:14.080]   Why?
[00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:17.400]   Because the momentum premium is very, very strong,
[00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:19.160]   but it's very short-lived.
[00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:21.840]   So if I can get a little bit of push
[00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:24.000]   because of upward momentum,
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.960]   just by holding the security a little bit longer.
[00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:28.760]   So we incorporate momentum,
[00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:32.280]   downward and upward momentum in our strategies.
[00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:34.480]   But we are very, very careful how we do it,
[00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:36.360]   because if you are not,
[00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:39.120]   you finish with a very, very high turnover.
[00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:42.480]   - Let me ask a question about factor premiums.
[00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:44.280]   Now you have a multi-factor model
[00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:48.040]   where you're using profitability and value combined
[00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:53.040]   to come up with what you expect to be a premium over beta,
[00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:57.160]   expect to be a premium over the market return.
[00:39:57.160 --> 00:39:59.720]   Do you have a way of determining
[00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:02.880]   what that premium should be going forward?
[00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:03.760]   What are we looking for?
[00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:05.960]   And a long only portfolio, not a long and short,
[00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:07.680]   but just a long only portfolio.
[00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:10.320]   - Yeah, no, long only.
[00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:13.440]   I don't think any one of us need a short portfolio.
[00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:16.800]   So we're all happy to have a long only, you know.
[00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:18.160]   This is a great question.
[00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:21.200]   So the question is,
[00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:23.920]   can we know at any point in time
[00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:27.840]   how much the market is discounting future cash flows?
[00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:31.040]   And the answer is no.
[00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:32.880]   And why not?
[00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:36.760]   That's where behavioral finance gets together
[00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:38.720]   with rational markets, yeah?
[00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:43.720]   In different periods of time for the same level of risk,
[00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:48.240]   people may be willing to take a lower price
[00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:49.160]   or a higher price.
[00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:50.480]   You know, we change.
[00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:51.440]   You know, the market change.
[00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:54.080]   You know, in periods of high anxiety,
[00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:56.400]   people are priced humongous discount rates.
[00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:58.280]   The price are very, very depressed.
[00:40:58.280 --> 00:41:02.480]   In other periods, the price is higher.
[00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:06.200]   And so the market is having lower expected returns.
[00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:09.240]   And you cannot really know at any point in time
[00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:11.960]   how big or how small is that premium.
[00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:13.480]   What you know is that it's a premium.
[00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:15.480]   But there is research that is very interesting
[00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:17.040]   that shows, look.
[00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:19.800]   Look at the long-term average of these premiums.
[00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:22.400]   That's probably as good as it gets.
[00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:25.840]   Now, some people say that if you look at the market,
[00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:28.160]   historical market performance
[00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:31.440]   relative to treasury bills, for example,
[00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:33.800]   probably was higher than what we should expect
[00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:34.640]   in the future.
[00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:37.000]   - I would agree.
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:39.640]   Some people say that because now the market,
[00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:42.280]   now more people embrace investing in the market.
[00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:44.880]   There is more of us that are buying securities
[00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:46.480]   than what there were in the past.
[00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:48.520]   And so if you have a higher clientele,
[00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:50.920]   there's more people willing to take
[00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:52.160]   a little bit of that risk.
[00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:54.040]   We're increasing the price
[00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:55.640]   and we're reducing expected returns.
[00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:57.160]   There is a logic.
[00:41:57.160 --> 00:41:58.640]   - I think another piece of logic is,
[00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:01.200]   are treasury bills correctly priced?
[00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:04.160]   If you're gonna use that as the risk-free rate.
[00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:06.720]   Based on where treasury bills are currently priced,
[00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:08.600]   I think that the premium could be high,
[00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:10.760]   but if treasury bills were correctly priced
[00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:12.400]   based on where the inflation rate is,
[00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:14.240]   I think that the premium might be a lot lower.
[00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:16.080]   So I don't know if treasury bills
[00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:17.760]   are the right risk-free rate to use,
[00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:20.040]   even though that's what's being used in the models.
[00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:21.360]   - Yeah, you are right about
[00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:23.720]   what is the risk-free rate is interesting.
[00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:27.000]   But we're not just speaking about short-term periods.
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:29.040]   We're speaking about long-term periods.
[00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:31.760]   And so if we think about that,
[00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:34.840]   expected returns of the market may be a little bit smaller
[00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:36.720]   than what we have seen in the past.
[00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:40.400]   There is more willingness of people to embrace the market
[00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:41.920]   and embrace market rates.
[00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:43.520]   And there is more people to do that.
[00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:47.240]   Then you would expect premiums to be a little bit smaller.
[00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:50.280]   Is that the same for value investing?
[00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:51.680]   And when I say value,
[00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:55.280]   I think a generalized ways of value, like what we do.
[00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:57.560]   I think that there is no information
[00:42:57.560 --> 00:43:01.240]   about more people embracing these than before.
[00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:03.920]   They may be smaller than historical premiums.
[00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:05.520]   They may be not.
[00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:08.800]   Now, the traditional way of defining value,
[00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:10.720]   like if you are looking low price to book
[00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:14.560]   without looking at the cash flows of the company,
[00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:17.680]   that probably is not the right way to do it.
[00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:20.480]   And so science has evolved from there.
[00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:24.480]   So I think it's better if people evolve from that.
[00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:26.920]   - Let me ask a question about US versus international,
[00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:30.680]   because you did this paper on using value
[00:43:30.680 --> 00:43:34.200]   and profitability in international markets.
[00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:36.400]   Is it different outside the US?
[00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:39.280]   Is it different in emerging markets than in the US market?
[00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:41.720]   And how do you have to change your formula?
[00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:45.480]   - Okay, so if you remember,
[00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:48.080]   I told you a story about the valuation of the company.
[00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:49.760]   So what is the value of the company?
[00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:51.360]   The price of the company is the equity
[00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:54.440]   plus the cash flows discounted by some discount rate.
[00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:57.440]   But I never told you that that valuation
[00:43:57.440 --> 00:43:59.280]   is only valid in the United States.
[00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:01.400]   But I think that that valuation was valid
[00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:04.640]   when the Babylonians were selling and buying donkeys.
[00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:07.040]   And probably it's going to be the same in the future
[00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:09.520]   when we are selling and buying water or oxygen,
[00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:11.320]   if we ever live in Mars.
[00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:14.800]   So this is an evaluation framework,
[00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:16.240]   the beauty of evaluation framework
[00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:18.880]   that is valid in all the different environment.
[00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:20.720]   It's different from a pattern.
[00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:23.160]   A pattern may be valid here and not somewhere else.
[00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:24.920]   So the way that we do things
[00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:27.480]   is based on evaluation framework
[00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:31.160]   to understand what factors or what matters
[00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:33.520]   in expected returns of a company.
[00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:36.760]   And basically it works all around the world.
[00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:39.600]   It works in the US, it works in international,
[00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:41.440]   works in emerging markets.
[00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:44.200]   So the research is very robust from that point of view
[00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:46.720]   because you have a research that you can apply
[00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:49.280]   with evaluation framework everywhere.
[00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:52.840]   Now, when you're speaking about the variables itself,
[00:44:52.840 --> 00:44:54.720]   you have to adapt to realities.
[00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:56.640]   For example, in the United States,
[00:44:56.640 --> 00:45:00.000]   companies report financials quarterly,
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:04.320]   but in some countries report only twice a year.
[00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:07.160]   And so you have to adapt with the data
[00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:09.280]   and try to make the best that you have
[00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:11.200]   with the data of the different countries
[00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:13.400]   in order to have the model
[00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:16.000]   use the right set of information.
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:19.440]   - Let me ask a question about small cap value funds.
[00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:24.440]   I personally have a small cap value tilt in my portfolio.
[00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:27.720]   I don't yet have an international small cap value tilt.
[00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:30.640]   And one of the questions I have is,
[00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:35.640]   why are there no global small cap value index funds or ETFs?
[00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:40.200]   - You know, I've been asked that many times.
[00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:42.680]   It's more, we may be thinking about doing one
[00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:45.080]   outside the United States, not for US investor,
[00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:47.560]   for outside in United States.
[00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:50.280]   And why we don't have one in the United States?
[00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:53.880]   We have, as you know, we have a US small value strategy
[00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:56.600]   and international small value strategy
[00:45:56.600 --> 00:45:59.640]   and an emerging markets meet and a small value strategy.
[00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:02.400]   And we do meet and a small together in emerging
[00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:04.120]   just because of how more liquidity
[00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:05.320]   and the number of securities.
[00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:08.560]   But we don't have one that puts the three of them together.
[00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:09.400]   - Correct.
[00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:11.040]   - Why is that?
[00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:14.600]   Because different investors
[00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:16.880]   want to have different allocation
[00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:20.160]   to the US versus emerging versus international.
[00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:22.600]   And if we put all together,
[00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:27.600]   then constrain the investors to decide which one to buy.
[00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:29.680]   Now, how to weigh them.
[00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:34.000]   Now, yeah, I understand, but think about this.
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:36.480]   When you buy an ETF, yeah?
[00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:38.240]   What is your fixed cost?
[00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:40.040]   Do you pay ticket charges?
[00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:41.480]   No, you don't pay ticket charges.
[00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:44.720]   So buying three ETFs is the same as buying one
[00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:46.600]   because you don't have ticket charges.
[00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:48.840]   So given that you don't have ticket charges,
[00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:52.320]   just buy three securities instead of buying one.
[00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:54.280]   And that gives you the freedom
[00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:57.080]   to decide how you want to weight them.
[00:46:57.080 --> 00:46:59.400]   - Okay, I will push back here
[00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:04.400]   because you have a global real estate portfolio,
[00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:08.680]   a real estate, but you just finished saying
[00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:10.600]   you should have a US small value
[00:47:10.600 --> 00:47:11.920]   and an international small value,
[00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:14.840]   but yet you have a global real estate fund.
[00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:16.560]   So explain why.
[00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:18.480]   - Yeah, that's a great question.
[00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:23.120]   So you say you can have a US real estate
[00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:24.440]   and international real estate,
[00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:26.280]   and I will tell, yes, you're right.
[00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:28.120]   We can have a US and an international.
[00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:31.160]   Now, an international real estate market
[00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:35.920]   is much, much smaller than the US real estate market, yeah?
[00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:39.960]   - 30% versus 70, so international versus US.
[00:47:39.960 --> 00:47:44.280]   - Yes, so an ETF for international real estate
[00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:47.320]   that will have a very, very small allocation
[00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:49.680]   in someone's portfolio, we say, no,
[00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:53.040]   let's put it all together in real estate
[00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:55.400]   and let's give that to someone
[00:47:55.400 --> 00:47:59.120]   because I, maybe I'm wrong, but we say,
[00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:02.080]   no one worries too much about how much US or non-US.
[00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:05.560]   So someone wants a full US real estate
[00:48:05.560 --> 00:48:08.240]   or they are happy to have a global real estate.
[00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:10.440]   So we say, let's provide global.
[00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:13.360]   The global real estate market has been developing.
[00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:17.360]   You know, UK REITs, I think they are 15 years old,
[00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:19.760]   JREITs, so it's developing.
[00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:21.920]   At some point, we may split it
[00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:24.360]   or have two versions or whatnot,
[00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:28.280]   but for now we decided global probably is the right decision.
[00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:30.240]   - I can give you the pros and cons
[00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:33.840]   of a global small cap value fund.
[00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:37.400]   The pros are, man, it's a lot more convenient
[00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:38.600]   than buying three funds.
[00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:42.880]   Just buy one small value, covers the world, I'm happy.
[00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:44.080]   What's the disadvantage?
[00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:48.240]   Well, the disadvantage is taxes and the foreign tax credit.
[00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:50.160]   If you're gonna put it in your taxable account
[00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:53.160]   because since less than 50% of the portfolio
[00:48:53.160 --> 00:48:54.400]   is gonna be an international,
[00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:56.440]   you don't get the foreign tax credit.
[00:48:56.440 --> 00:48:58.000]   So in a taxable portfolio,
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:01.920]   you still have to divide it up between a US small value
[00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:03.200]   and an international small value.
[00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:04.400]   So you get the tax credits
[00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:05.600]   on the international small value.
[00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:08.920]   But if this was gonna go into an IRA account
[00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:11.600]   or a Roth account of some form,
[00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:14.560]   which I could see a global small cap value
[00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:18.160]   into a Roth account, that it would make sense,
[00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:20.360]   at least from my standpoint as an advisor,
[00:49:20.360 --> 00:49:24.360]   where I get this factor exposure using one fund.
[00:49:24.360 --> 00:49:27.400]   There is a need for it, I believe out there.
[00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:28.960]   So I'm just plugging that.
[00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:34.480]   - You're not the first one telling us that, to be fair.
[00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:36.480]   But I also go through that saying,
[00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:39.200]   look, if you have three ETFs,
[00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:41.400]   you don't have ticket charges in custodians.
[00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:43.720]   - But you have three funds and I don't want three funds.
[00:49:43.720 --> 00:49:45.000]   I want something simple.
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:48.200]   Anyway, let's go to the next thing.
[00:49:48.200 --> 00:49:52.120]   You know, we've evolved, we have the factors zoo now, okay?
[00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:55.320]   We also have things like artificial intelligence
[00:49:55.320 --> 00:49:57.120]   and we have machine learning
[00:49:57.120 --> 00:49:59.920]   and behavioral finance can be thrown into that as well.
[00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:03.240]   Are you looking at these things to incorporate them
[00:50:03.240 --> 00:50:07.080]   into your world and how you do things?
[00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:10.440]   - You know, the whole thing of machine learning
[00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:13.160]   and neural networks and all this is fascinating
[00:50:13.160 --> 00:50:15.040]   because what it's trying to do,
[00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:19.240]   it's trying to emulate how the brain works in learning
[00:50:19.240 --> 00:50:22.600]   or a collection of entities works in learning
[00:50:22.600 --> 00:50:27.600]   in order to learn without having a predefined model, yeah?
[00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:34.000]   So, but isn't that what the market does?
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:35.040]   - Yeah.
[00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:39.320]   - The market is a big machine learning machine
[00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:40.560]   that does machine learning.
[00:50:40.560 --> 00:50:44.200]   The market is a network of this, you know,
[00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:46.920]   a loose network of people interacting
[00:50:46.920 --> 00:50:51.680]   in order to increase some benefit for everyone,
[00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:53.040]   collectively everyone,
[00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:55.720]   but individually, each one of the individuals,
[00:50:55.720 --> 00:50:58.680]   each one is just trying to incorporate the information
[00:50:58.680 --> 00:51:01.200]   that they come in order to come with prices.
[00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:04.920]   So the whole market is a big machine learning network.
[00:51:04.920 --> 00:51:08.680]   Now, if I were an acting manager picking stocks
[00:51:08.680 --> 00:51:11.120]   and I think that I can do better than the market
[00:51:11.120 --> 00:51:13.400]   and find what securities are underpriced
[00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:14.960]   and securities underpriced,
[00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:16.920]   probably I will invest a lot of money there and say,
[00:51:16.920 --> 00:51:19.600]   oh, I'm going to be better than everyone else
[00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:21.440]   and find all the undervalued securities
[00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:23.680]   and all the overvalued securities.
[00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:25.360]   That's not us.
[00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:27.480]   So I'm not going to dispute the market price
[00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:29.200]   and create my model and then I will say,
[00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:31.200]   my model is better than the market
[00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:33.400]   because the market is as good as it gets.
[00:51:33.400 --> 00:51:35.040]   No, whatever our model is,
[00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:38.400]   it's going to be subpar to the market, in my opinion.
[00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:41.520]   So the market gives us a price of the securities.
[00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:43.920]   What we do is try to use that price
[00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:47.240]   in order to identify what securities have been priced
[00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:49.880]   at higher discount rates,
[00:51:49.880 --> 00:51:52.320]   so they have higher expected returns,
[00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:53.720]   and what securities have been priced
[00:51:53.720 --> 00:51:56.680]   at lower expected returns.
[00:51:56.680 --> 00:51:58.960]   There may be things that are interesting
[00:51:58.960 --> 00:52:02.480]   in machine learning to apply even to what we do.
[00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:07.480]   And for example, we were speaking about finding factors
[00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:09.800]   or finding drivers of expected returns.
[00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:14.320]   You could have imagined that all this factor research
[00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:16.400]   could have been done with machine learning.
[00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:19.560]   So we can have a machine learning trying to find
[00:52:19.560 --> 00:52:22.320]   what variables that are related to valuations
[00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:26.360]   have different levels of impact
[00:52:26.360 --> 00:52:28.480]   in the expected returns of the security.
[00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:29.720]   And that could have been done,
[00:52:29.720 --> 00:52:33.040]   but that's what the professors and researchers
[00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:36.040]   around the world have been done in a loose way.
[00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:39.520]   So yeah, you can use it, but a lot has been done
[00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:41.680]   even we don't call it machine learning.
[00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:45.520]   - Let me ask a question that was posed to me.
[00:52:45.520 --> 00:52:48.240]   It has to do with ESG.
[00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:49.080]   - Okay.
[00:52:49.080 --> 00:52:52.960]   - So ESG is popular in Europe, for sure,
[00:52:52.960 --> 00:52:54.640]   and maybe becoming a little more popular
[00:52:54.640 --> 00:52:56.760]   here in the United States than in the past,
[00:52:56.760 --> 00:53:01.760]   but it's very hard to find a small cap value ESG fund
[00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:06.800]   for the people who want factors and want ESG.
[00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:08.080]   Any interest there?
[00:53:08.080 --> 00:53:14.040]   - We are getting into the responsible investment business.
[00:53:14.040 --> 00:53:17.280]   So we're going to launch a couple of strategies,
[00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:21.560]   three strategies that have high exposure to a small value
[00:53:21.560 --> 00:53:25.800]   in the near future, let's put it that way.
[00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:28.280]   - Let's get into the last topic
[00:53:28.280 --> 00:53:30.280]   and that has to do with fixed income.
[00:53:30.280 --> 00:53:33.760]   You do have a few fixed income funds
[00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:36.600]   and you do run a strategy based on the yield curve,
[00:53:36.600 --> 00:53:40.000]   trying to enhance the return based on yield curve.
[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:41.280]   In other words, you say the yield curve
[00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:42.640]   is telling you something.
[00:53:42.640 --> 00:53:45.560]   Could explain your fixed income investment strategy
[00:53:45.560 --> 00:53:50.320]   and why there may be an expectation for a higher return
[00:53:50.320 --> 00:53:53.760]   than just doing a regular straight index fund.
[00:53:53.760 --> 00:53:56.200]   - There is a couple of things
[00:53:56.200 --> 00:53:57.480]   that are very, very interesting
[00:53:57.480 --> 00:53:59.600]   when you think about fixed income.
[00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:01.520]   Let's just speak first about indexing.
[00:54:01.520 --> 00:54:03.240]   You know how the index works.
[00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:06.320]   The index that an index managers follows in fixed income
[00:54:06.320 --> 00:54:09.560]   incorporates every bond as there have been issued.
[00:54:09.560 --> 00:54:12.120]   So you re-issue a bond,
[00:54:12.120 --> 00:54:17.120]   that bond is incorporated in the index automatically.
[00:54:17.120 --> 00:54:20.080]   Now, if you recap to issue a bond,
[00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:24.040]   are you going to issue in a way that increases your cost
[00:54:24.040 --> 00:54:27.280]   or reduces your cost of servicing that debt?
[00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:30.000]   You're going to try to minimize your cost.
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:32.240]   So you're going to issue in the condition,
[00:54:32.240 --> 00:54:34.280]   say duration or whatever it is,
[00:54:34.280 --> 00:54:36.680]   that minimize your cost, yeah?
[00:54:36.680 --> 00:54:37.520]   - Yes.
[00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:40.080]   - But if you are minimizing your cost,
[00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:42.760]   you're also minimizing my expected returns
[00:54:42.760 --> 00:54:45.160]   if I'm the investor in that bond.
[00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:49.480]   So the automatically inclusion of bonds
[00:54:49.480 --> 00:54:53.440]   is really a detriment for an index in fixed income.
[00:54:54.720 --> 00:54:58.040]   Now, you mentioned we use some scenario.
[00:54:58.040 --> 00:55:00.280]   We need to have like inequities.
[00:55:00.280 --> 00:55:02.280]   We need to have an idea
[00:55:02.280 --> 00:55:06.240]   what bonds will have higher expected returns than others,
[00:55:06.240 --> 00:55:09.480]   given the same credit quality and everything the same.
[00:55:09.480 --> 00:55:11.800]   And we do that by using the yield curve.
[00:55:11.800 --> 00:55:14.080]   So what do we mean by that?
[00:55:14.080 --> 00:55:15.840]   Let's suppose that you have a bond
[00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:17.720]   and you hold it to maturity.
[00:55:17.720 --> 00:55:20.360]   And let's suppose that the bonds of default, yeah?
[00:55:20.360 --> 00:55:22.600]   What is your expected return on that bond?
[00:55:22.600 --> 00:55:26.160]   Your expected return of that bond is your yield to maturity.
[00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:28.600]   - Assuming you can reinvest the income
[00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:30.200]   at the yield to maturity rate.
[00:55:30.200 --> 00:55:32.480]   - Let's assume that it's zero coupon.
[00:55:32.480 --> 00:55:33.440]   Life is easy.
[00:55:33.440 --> 00:55:34.280]   - Life is easy.
[00:55:34.280 --> 00:55:35.520]   Zero coupon.
[00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:36.800]   - Zero coupon.
[00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:38.840]   So your zero coupon bond
[00:55:38.840 --> 00:55:41.560]   that has a yield to maturity of 2%,
[00:55:41.560 --> 00:55:45.000]   your average return if you hold that bond to maturity
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:46.480]   is 2% a year.
[00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:47.400]   - Correct.
[00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:51.640]   - But your return from year to year is not going to be 2%.
[00:55:51.640 --> 00:55:52.760]   - That's correct.
[00:55:52.760 --> 00:55:54.720]   - Because if you have a three-year bond
[00:55:54.720 --> 00:55:57.040]   under the typical yield curve,
[00:55:57.040 --> 00:56:00.400]   the yield curve has lower yields to maturity
[00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:01.960]   for short-term durations
[00:56:01.960 --> 00:56:04.880]   and higher yields to maturity for longer duration.
[00:56:04.880 --> 00:56:07.400]   So if I have a three-year bond
[00:56:07.400 --> 00:56:10.360]   that gives me yield to maturity of 2%,
[00:56:10.360 --> 00:56:11.880]   one year from now,
[00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:15.160]   that bond will be shorter to maturity.
[00:56:15.160 --> 00:56:16.160]   So on expectation,
[00:56:16.160 --> 00:56:20.880]   we have a lower yield to maturity than today.
[00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:22.960]   So you can see the yield to maturity
[00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:25.360]   was the average return to maturity,
[00:56:25.360 --> 00:56:29.440]   but that doesn't mean that every year is the same.
[00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:34.840]   In general, the longer portion of that holding period
[00:56:34.840 --> 00:56:36.120]   will have higher returns
[00:56:36.120 --> 00:56:39.200]   than the shorter portion of that holding period.
[00:56:39.200 --> 00:56:43.000]   So you can use information in the shape of the yield curve
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:47.320]   to decide when that bond has higher than average returns
[00:56:47.320 --> 00:56:48.600]   relative to the yield to maturity
[00:56:48.600 --> 00:56:52.280]   and when it's going to have lower expected returns
[00:56:52.280 --> 00:56:54.080]   relative to the yield to maturity.
[00:56:54.080 --> 00:56:57.600]   And we use that information to create portfolios.
[00:56:57.600 --> 00:56:59.280]   - In geekish fixed income,
[00:56:59.280 --> 00:57:01.440]   what you're talking about is horizon return.
[00:57:01.440 --> 00:57:02.280]   - Yes.
[00:57:02.280 --> 00:57:03.880]   - If you're going to use it for two years,
[00:57:03.880 --> 00:57:04.920]   you're going to keep it for two years
[00:57:04.920 --> 00:57:06.280]   and then you're going to sell it,
[00:57:06.280 --> 00:57:09.080]   you're going to do what we call riding the yield curve.
[00:57:09.080 --> 00:57:09.920]   - Yes.
[00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:12.200]   - This 2% bond that you purchased
[00:57:12.200 --> 00:57:13.320]   because the last year,
[00:57:13.320 --> 00:57:14.800]   the yield to maturity on that bond
[00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:16.360]   might only be a half a percent,
[00:57:16.360 --> 00:57:18.800]   and you bought it at 2% as a three year.
[00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:21.880]   After the first two years, if you sold it,
[00:57:21.880 --> 00:57:23.320]   you're going to get a return on that
[00:57:23.320 --> 00:57:26.120]   that's much higher than the 2% yield.
[00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:28.400]   So the horizon yield might be two and a half
[00:57:28.400 --> 00:57:30.600]   or 2.7 or whatever it is.
[00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:31.440]   - Exactly.
[00:57:31.440 --> 00:57:34.680]   That's exactly what we're saying.
[00:57:34.680 --> 00:57:38.160]   - See, I remember from my CFA days all of that stuff.
[00:57:38.160 --> 00:57:39.920]   - That's exactly what we're doing.
[00:57:39.920 --> 00:57:43.440]   Instead of trying to get an average income to maturity,
[00:57:43.440 --> 00:57:46.720]   we are happy to get an income from some period of time
[00:57:46.720 --> 00:57:48.400]   and a capital appreciation
[00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:51.040]   due to the change in the shape of the yield curve.
[00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:53.120]   - And the convexity, as another geekish word,
[00:57:53.120 --> 00:57:54.280]   has a lot to do with this too.
[00:57:54.280 --> 00:57:56.960]   I mean, there are some bonds that this happens rapidly
[00:57:56.960 --> 00:57:58.680]   and there are some bonds where it takes more time.
[00:57:58.680 --> 00:57:59.520]   - Absolutely.
[00:57:59.520 --> 00:58:01.240]   And that's why the way we do it
[00:58:01.240 --> 00:58:04.640]   is we have an estimated yield curve for different issues.
[00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:06.680]   For every issue, we have an estimated yield curve
[00:58:06.680 --> 00:58:09.600]   depending on the sector, the credit quality and whatnot.
[00:58:09.600 --> 00:58:10.760]   Based on market information,
[00:58:10.760 --> 00:58:13.080]   we don't make predictions, remember.
[00:58:13.080 --> 00:58:16.240]   And then we use that estimated yield curve for every issue
[00:58:16.240 --> 00:58:18.000]   to compute the specter return of the bond
[00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:20.160]   for a horizon, like you mentioned.
[00:58:20.160 --> 00:58:23.000]   And then we use that information to create a portfolio.
[00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:23.880]   - Very interesting.
[00:58:23.880 --> 00:58:26.000]   Well, Eduardo, it's been fantastic having you
[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:27.800]   on "Bogle Heads-On Investing."
[00:58:27.800 --> 00:58:30.320]   I thank you very much for your time today

[00:58:32.920 --> 00:58:35.720]   and hopefully you get to 100 billion quickly.
[00:58:35.720 --> 00:58:37.280]   - Thank you very much.
