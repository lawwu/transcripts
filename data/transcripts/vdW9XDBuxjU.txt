[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400]   - You recently published the video of a lecture
[00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.720]   you gave at Oxford presenting some aspects of a theory,
[00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.880]   a theory of everything called geometric unity.
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.400]   So this was a work of 30, 30 plus years.
[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.760]   This is life's work.
[00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.880]   Let me ask sort of the silly old question.
[00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.960]   How do you feel as a human?
[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.120]   Excited, scared, the experience of posting it?
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.960]   - You know, it's funny.
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.080]   One of the things that you learn to feel as an academic
[00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.520]   is the great sins you can commit in academics
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.360]   is to show yourself to be a non-serious person,
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.340]   to show yourself to have delusions,
[00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.600]   to avoid the standard practices
[00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.140]   which everyone is signed up for.
[00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.520]   And you know, it's weird because like,
[00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.680]   you know that those people are gonna be angry.
[00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:02.520]   He did what?
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.400]   You know, why would he do that?
[00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.240]   And--
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.720]   - And what we're referring to, for example,
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.080]   there's traditions of sort of publishing incrementally,
[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.800]   certainly not trying to have a theory of everything,
[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.560]   perhaps working within the academic departments,
[00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.400]   all those things.
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.960]   - That's true.
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.560]   - And so you're going outside of all of that.
[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.860]   - Well, I mean, I was going inside of all of that.
[00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.980]   And we did not come to terms when I was inside.
[00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.560]   And what they did was so outside to me,
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.840]   was so weird, so freakish.
[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.500]   Like the most senior respectable people
[00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.740]   at the most senior respectable places
[00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.040]   were functionally insane, as far as I could tell.
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.240]   And again, it's like being functionally stupid
[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.480]   if you're the head of the CDC or something
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.600]   where you're giving recommendations out
[00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.500]   that aren't based on what you actually believe,
[00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.000]   they're based on what you think you have to be doing.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.560]   Well, in some sense, I think that that's a lot
[00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.200]   of how I saw the math and physics world as,
[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.400]   the physics world was really crazy
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.820]   and the math world was considerably less crazy,
[00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.700]   just very strict and kind of dogmatic.
[00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.820]   - Well, we'll psychoanalyze those folks,
[00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:17.320]   but I really wanna maybe linger on it a little bit longer
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.200]   of how you feel 'cause this is such a special moment
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.040]   in your life.
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.160]   - Well, I really appreciate it, it's a great question.
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.760]   So if we can pair off some of those other issues,
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:35.800]   it's new being able to say what the Observer's is,
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.220]   which is my attempt to replace space-time
[00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.160]   with something that is both closely related
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.360]   to space-time and not space-time.
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.560]   So I used to carry the number 14
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.860]   as a closely guarded secret in my life
[00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.860]   and where 14 is really four dimensions of space and time
[00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.940]   plus 10 extra dimensions of rulers and protractors
[00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.940]   or for the cool kids out there, symmetric two tensors.
[00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.600]   - So you had a geometric, complicated,
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.360]   beautiful geometric view of the world
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.080]   that you carried with you for a long time.
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.920]   - Yeah.
[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.780]   - Did you have friends that you, colleagues that you--
[00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:15.980]   - Essentially, no.
[00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:16.820]   - Talked?
[00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.780]   - No, in fact, some of these stories
[00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.320]   are me coming out to my friends
[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.460]   and I use the phrase coming out
[00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:28.200]   because I think that gays have monopolized
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.960]   the concept of a closet.
[00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.300]   Many of us are in closets having nothing to do
[00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:33.740]   with our sexual orientation.
[00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:37.500]   Yeah, I didn't really feel comfortable
[00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:38.740]   talking to almost anyone.
[00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:42.420]   So this was a closely guarded secret
[00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.220]   and I think that I let on in some ways
[00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.940]   that I was up to something and probably,
[00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.660]   but it was a very weird life.
[00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.540]   So I had to have a series of things
[00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.240]   that I pretended to care about
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.960]   so that I could use that as the stalking horse
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:55.980]   for what I really cared about.
[00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.300]   And to your point, I never understood this whole thing
[00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.220]   about theories of everything.
[00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:02.900]   Like if you were gonna go into something
[00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.940]   like theoretical physics,
[00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.580]   isn't that what you would normally pursue?
[00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.100]   Like wouldn't it be crazy to do something that difficult
[00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.940]   and that poorly paid if you were gonna try
[00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.460]   to do something other than figure out
[00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:16.460]   what this is all about?
[00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:18.300]   - Now I have to reveal my cards,
[00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:21.720]   my sort of weaknesses and lack and understanding
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.880]   of the music of physics and math departments.
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.980]   But there's an analogy here to artificial intelligence
[00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:32.540]   and often folks come in and say,
[00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.860]   "Okay, so there's a giant department
[00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.940]   "working on quote unquote artificial intelligence,
[00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:42.700]   "but why is nobody actually working on intelligence?"
[00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:46.700]   Like you're all just building little toys.
[00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:48.580]   You're not actually trying to understand.
[00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.180]   And that breaks a lot of people.
[00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:54.060]   It confuses them 'cause like,
[00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.980]   okay, so I'm at MIT, I'm at Stanford, I'm at Harvard,
[00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:59.740]   I'm here, I dreamed of being,
[00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.140]   working on artificial intelligence.
[00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:05.340]   Why is everybody not actually working on intelligence?
[00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:07.860]   And I have the same kind of sense
[00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.820]   that that's what working on the theory of everything is.
[00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:15.180]   That strangely you somehow become an outcast for even--
[00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:16.820]   - But we know why this is, right?
[00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:18.860]   - Why?
[00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.860]   - Well, it's because, let's take the artificial,
[00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.360]   let's play with AGI for example.
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.600]   I think that the idea starts off
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.900]   with nobody really knows how to work on that.
[00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.340]   And so if we don't know how to work on it,
[00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:32.780]   we choose instead to work on a program
[00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.060]   that is tangentially related to it.
[00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:37.300]   So we do a component of a program
[00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.820]   that is related to that big question
[00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.960]   because it's felt like at least I can make progress there.
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.140]   And that wasn't where I was.
[00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:49.020]   Where I was in, it's funny,
[00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.540]   there was this book called Frieden-Uhlenbeck
[00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:53.700]   and it had this weird mysterious line
[00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:55.440]   in the beginning of it.
[00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.700]   And I tried to get clarification
[00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:59.180]   of this weird mysterious line
[00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.700]   and everyone said wrong things.
[00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:02.580]   And then I said, okay, well,
[00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:05.160]   so I can tell that nobody's thinking properly
[00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.100]   because I just asked the entire department
[00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:11.420]   and nobody has a correct interpretation of this.
[00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:16.020]   And so, it's a little bit like you see a crime scene photo
[00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:18.140]   and you have a different idea.
[00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:20.060]   Like there's a smoking gun and you figure,
[00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:21.500]   that's actually a cigarette lighter.
[00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:22.700]   I don't really believe that.
[00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:25.020]   And then there's like a pack of cards
[00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:27.220]   and you think, oh, that looks like the blunt instrument
[00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.460]   that the person was beaten with.
[00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:32.680]   So you have a very different idea about how things go.
[00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:33.860]   And very quickly you realize
[00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:36.280]   that there's no one thinking about that.
[00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:40.580]   There's a few human sides to this and technical sides,
[00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:43.860]   both of which I'd love to try to get down to.
[00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:46.900]   So the human side, I can tell from my perspective,
[00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:50.440]   I think it was before April 1st, April Fool's,
[00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.140]   maybe the day before, I forget.
[00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:54.700]   But I was laying in bed in the middle of the night
[00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:59.700]   and somehow it popped up on my feed somewhere
[00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:05.420]   that your beautiful face is speaking live.
[00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:09.660]   And I clicked and it's kind of weird
[00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:11.540]   how the universe just brings things together
[00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:12.980]   in this kind of way.
[00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:14.940]   And all of a sudden I realized
[00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:16.620]   that there's something big happening
[00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:17.700]   at this particular moment.
[00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:21.500]   It's strange, on a day like any day.
[00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:25.460]   And all of a sudden you were thinking of,
[00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:28.780]   you had this somber tone, like you were serious,
[00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:32.000]   like you were going through some difficult decision.
[00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:38.140]   And it seems strange, I almost thought you were maybe joking
[00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:40.180]   but there was a serious decision being made
[00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:42.780]   and it was a wonderful experience to go through with you.
[00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:43.620]   - I really appreciate it.
[00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:45.140]   I mean, it was April 1st.
[00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:46.580]   - Yeah, it's kind of fascinating.
[00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:48.280]   I mean, just the whole experience.
[00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:54.340]   And so I want to ask, I mean, thank you for letting me
[00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:57.580]   be part of that kind of journey of decision-making
[00:07:57.580 --> 00:07:59.260]   that took 30 years.
[00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.860]   But why now?
[00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:05.020]   Why did you think, why did you struggle so long
[00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:09.140]   not to release it and decide to release it now?
[00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:13.380]   While the whole world is on lockdown,
[00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:17.300]   and April fools, is it just because you like the comedy
[00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:21.700]   of absurd ways that the universe comes together?
[00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:23.140]   - I don't think so.
[00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:27.660]   I think that the COVID epidemic is the end of the big nap.
[00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:33.660]   And I think that I actually tried this seven years earlier
[00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:34.540]   in Oxford.
[00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:37.940]   And it was too early.
[00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:41.460]   - Which part was too, is it the platform?
[00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:43.380]   'Cause your platform is quite different now, actually.
[00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:44.900]   The internet, I remember you,
[00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:48.140]   I read several of your brilliant answers
[00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:49.940]   that people should read for the Edge questions.
[00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:52.540]   One of them was related to the internet.
[00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:53.940]   - It was the first one.
[00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:54.940]   - Was it the first one?
[00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:57.020]   - An essay called "Go Virtual, Young Man."
[00:08:57.020 --> 00:09:00.500]   - Yeah, yeah, that's like forever ago now.
[00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:01.740]   - Well, that was 10 years ago,
[00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:03.140]   and that's exactly what I did,
[00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:04.740]   is I decamped to the internet,
[00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:06.060]   which is where the portal lives.
[00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:07.780]   The portal, the portal, the portal.
[00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:09.380]   (laughing)
[00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:11.260]   - Well, let's start the whole, the theme,
[00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:15.420]   the ominous theme music, which you just listen to forever.
[00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:18.700]   - I actually started recording tiny guitar licks
[00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:22.340]   for the audio portion, not for the video portion.
[00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:25.820]   You kind of inspire me with bringing your guitar
[00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:27.940]   to the story, but keep going.
[00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:30.620]   - So you thought, so the Oxford was like step one,
[00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:34.180]   and you kind of, you put your foot in the water
[00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:37.500]   to sample it, but it was too cold at the time,
[00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:38.340]   so you didn't want to step in--
[00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:40.220]   - I was just really disappointed.
[00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:42.460]   - What was disappointing about that experience?
[00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:43.820]   - It's a hard thing to talk about.
[00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:45.700]   It has to do with the fact that,
[00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:51.980]   and I can see this mirrors a disappointment within myself.
[00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:53.340]   There are two separate issues.
[00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:57.260]   One is the issue of making sure that the idea
[00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.620]   is actually heard and explored,
[00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:02.580]   and the other is the question about,
[00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:06.140]   will I become disconnected from my work
[00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:07.940]   because it will be ridiculed,
[00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:10.180]   it will be immediately improved,
[00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:12.180]   it will be found to be derivative of something
[00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:14.460]   that occurred in some paper in 1957.
[00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:17.740]   When the community does not want you to gain a voice,
[00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:21.380]   it's a little bit like a policeman deciding
[00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:26.380]   to weirdly enforce all of these little-known regulations
[00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:30.580]   against you and sometimes nobody else,
[00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:35.140]   and I think that's kind of this weird thing
[00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:40.100]   where I just don't believe that we can reach
[00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:42.860]   the final theory necessarily
[00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:45.920]   within the political economy of academics.
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:48.100]   So if you think about how academics are tortured
[00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:51.420]   by each other and how they're paid
[00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:53.900]   and where they have freedom and where they don't,
[00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:55.940]   I actually weirdly think that that system
[00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:58.540]   of selective pressures is going to eliminate anybody
[00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:00.540]   who's going to make real progress.
[00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:01.380]   - So that's interesting.
[00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:04.700]   So if you look at the story of Andrew Wiles, for example,
[00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:10.340]   from Mausoleum, he, as far as I understand,
[00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:12.500]   he pretty much isolated himself
[00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:15.820]   from the world of academics in terms of the bulk
[00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:17.300]   of the work he did.
[00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:22.060]   And from my perspective, it's dramatic and fun to read about
[00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:23.660]   but it seemed exceptionally stressful
[00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:28.260]   the first steps he took when actually making the work public.
[00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.820]   That seemed, to me, it would be hell.
[00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:33.660]   - Yeah, but it's like so artificially dramatic.
[00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:37.660]   You know, he leads up to it at a series of lectures.
[00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:39.060]   He doesn't want to say it.
[00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:41.940]   And then he finally says it at the end
[00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:44.140]   because obviously this comes out of a body of work
[00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:47.340]   where, I mean, the funny part about Fermat's last theorem
[00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:49.540]   is that it wasn't originally thought to be a deep
[00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:51.260]   and meaningful problem.
[00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:54.520]   It was just an easy to state one that had gone unsolved.
[00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:57.500]   But if you think about it, it became attached
[00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:59.700]   to the body of regular theory.
[00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:02.140]   So he built up this body of regular theory,
[00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:04.860]   gets all the way up to the end, announces.
[00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:07.660]   And then like, there's this whole drama about,
[00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:09.060]   okay, somebody's checking the proof.
[00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:12.140]   I don't understand what's going on in line 37.
[00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:13.780]   You know, and like, oh, is this serious?
[00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:15.700]   Seems a little bit more serious than we knew.
[00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:17.060]   - I mean, do you see parallels?
[00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:19.180]   Do you share the concern that your experience
[00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:20.340]   might be something similar?
[00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:23.100]   - Well, in his case, I think that if I recall correctly,
[00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:24.940]   his original proof was unsalvageable.
[00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:28.140]   He actually came up with a second proof
[00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:32.980]   with a colleague, Richard Taylor.
[00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:35.900]   And it was that second proof which carried the day.
[00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:37.460]   So it was a little bit that he got put
[00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:41.220]   under incredible pressure and then had to succeed
[00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:43.020]   in a new way having failed the first time,
[00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:45.660]   which is like even a weirder and stranger story.
[00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:47.620]   - That's an incredible story in some sense.
[00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:50.660]   But I mean, I'm trying to get a sense
[00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:51.740]   of the kind of stress you're under.
[00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:54.620]   - I think that this is, okay, but I'm rejecting.
[00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:57.180]   What I don't think people understand with me
[00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:59.240]   is the scale of the critique.
[00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:03.540]   It's like, I don't, people say,
[00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:05.180]   well, you must implicitly agree with this
[00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:07.920]   and implicitly agree, and it's like, no, try me.
[00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:11.500]   Ask before you decide that I am mostly in agreement
[00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:14.020]   with the community about how these things should be handled
[00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:15.820]   or what these things mean.
[00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:17.100]   - Can you elaborate?
[00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:22.100]   And also just why does criticism matter so much here?
[00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:28.860]   So you seem to dislike the burden of criticism
[00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:31.420]   that it will choke away all--
[00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:33.500]   - There's different kinds of criticism.
[00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:35.060]   There's constructive criticism
[00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:36.980]   and there's destructive criticism.
[00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:40.820]   And what I don't like is I don't like a community
[00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:44.500]   that can't, first of all,
[00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:46.780]   if you take the physics community,
[00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:49.820]   just the way we screwed up on masks and PPE,
[00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:52.700]   just the way we screwed up in the financial crisis
[00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:53.980]   and mortgage-backed securities,
[00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:55.980]   we screwed up on string theory.
[00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:59.260]   - Can we just forget the string theory happened?
[00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.540]   - Sure, but then somebody should say that, right?
[00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:04.340]   Somebody should say, you know, it didn't work out.
[00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:05.160]   - Yeah.
[00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:08.180]   - But okay, but you're asking this,
[00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:10.460]   why do you guys get to keep the prestige
[00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:13.140]   after failing for 35 years?
[00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:13.980]   That's an interesting question.
[00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:15.020]   - Who is the you guys?
[00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:16.220]   Because to me--
[00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:18.700]   - Whoever the, look, these things,
[00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:21.740]   if there is a theory of everything to be had, right,
[00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:24.380]   it's going to be a relatively small group of people
[00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:25.740]   where this will be sorted out.
[00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:26.580]   - Absolutely.
[00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:28.940]   - It's not tens of thousands.
[00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:32.500]   It's probably hundreds at the top.
[00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:37.500]   - But within that community, there's the assholes.
[00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:43.700]   There's the, I mean, you always in this world
[00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:46.740]   have people who are kind, open-minded.
[00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:47.580]   - It's not a question about kind.
[00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:52.220]   It's a question about, okay, let's imagine, for example,
[00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:55.620]   that you have a story where you believe
[00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:57.940]   that ulcers are definitely caused by stress,
[00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:00.860]   and you've never questioned it,
[00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:03.380]   or maybe you felt like the Japanese came out of the blue
[00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:05.940]   and attacked us at Pearl Harbor, right?
[00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:08.740]   And now somebody introduces a new idea to you,
[00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:11.180]   which is like, what if it isn't stress at all?
[00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:14.980]   Or what if we actually tried to make resource-starved Japan
[00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:16.500]   attack us somewhere in the Pacific
[00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:19.420]   so we could have Cassius Belli to enter the Asian theater?
[00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:21.900]   And the person's original idea is like,
[00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:24.020]   what, what are you even saying?
[00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:25.520]   You know, it's like too crazy.
[00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:29.500]   Well, when Dirac in 1963
[00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:33.380]   talked about the importance of beauty
[00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:35.140]   as a guiding principle in physics,
[00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:38.700]   and he wasn't talking about the scientific method,
[00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:40.260]   that was crazy talk.
[00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.940]   But he was actually making a great point,
[00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:44.220]   and he was using Schrodinger,
[00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:47.380]   and I think Schrodinger was standing in for him,
[00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:48.960]   and he said that if your equations
[00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:50.740]   don't agree with experiment,
[00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:52.700]   that's kind of a minor detail.
[00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:54.540]   If they have true beauty in them,
[00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:55.660]   you should explore them,
[00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:59.300]   because very often the agreement with experiment
[00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:02.260]   is an issue of fine-tuning of your model,
[00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:03.460]   of the instantiation.
[00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:07.660]   And so it doesn't really tell you that your model is wrong.
[00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:11.020]   Of course, Heisenberg told Dirac that his model was wrong
[00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:13.900]   because the proton and the electron
[00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:14.920]   should be the same mass
[00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:17.620]   if they are each other's antiparticles.
[00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:21.720]   And that was an irrelevant kind of silliness
[00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:25.420]   rather than a real threat to the Dirac theory.
[00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:28.660]   - Okay, so amidst all this silliness,
[00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:30.740]   I'm hoping that we could talk about
[00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:34.780]   the journey that geometric unity has taken and will take
[00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:38.140]   as an idea and an idea that will see the light.
[00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:39.300]   - Yeah.
[00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:40.260]   - So first of all,
[00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:43.260]   I'm thinking of writing a book called
[00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:45.420]   "Geometric Unity for Idiots."
[00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:46.260]   - Okay.
[00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:47.820]   - And I need you as a consultant.
[00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:48.660]   So can we--
[00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:50.380]   - First of all, I hope I have the trademark
[00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:51.340]   on geometric unity.
[00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:52.260]   - You do.
[00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:53.100]   - Good.
[00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:55.900]   - Can you give a basic introduction
[00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:59.240]   of the goals of geometric unity,
[00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:02.420]   the basic tools of mathematics,
[00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:06.940]   use the viewpoints in general for idiots like me?
[00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:08.420]   - Okay, great, fun.
[00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:10.940]   - So what's the goal of geometric unity?
[00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:14.100]   - The goal of geometric unity is to start with something
[00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:19.100]   so completely bland that you can simply say,
[00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:21.740]   well, that's something that begins the game
[00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:25.100]   is as close to a mathematical nothing as possible.
[00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:26.540]   In other words, I can't answer the question,
[00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:28.260]   why is there something rather than nothing?
[00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:31.340]   But if there has to be a something that we begin from,
[00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:34.620]   let it begin from something that's like a blank canvas.
[00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:37.540]   - Let's even more basic.
[00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:38.940]   So what is something?
[00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:40.180]   What are we trying to describe here?
[00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:45.180]   - Okay, right now we have a model of our world
[00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:47.700]   and it's got two sectors.
[00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:49.780]   One of the sectors is called general relativity,
[00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:51.940]   the other is called the standard model.
[00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:55.780]   So we'll call it GR for general relativity
[00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:58.060]   and SM for standard model.
[00:17:58.060 --> 00:17:59.260]   - What's the difference between the two?
[00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:01.380]   What are the two described?
[00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:06.380]   - So general relativity gives pride of place to gravity
[00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:12.500]   and everything else is acting as a sort of a backup singer.
[00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:14.220]   - Gravity is the star of the show.
[00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:17.220]   - Gravity is the star of general relativity.
[00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:20.420]   And in the standard model,
[00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:23.620]   the other three non-gravitational forces,
[00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:25.420]   so if there are four forces that we know about,
[00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:27.820]   three of the four are non-gravitational,
[00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:30.340]   that's where they get to shine.
[00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:32.820]   - Great, so tiny little particles
[00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:34.540]   and how they interact with each other.
[00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:36.620]   - So photons, gluons,
[00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:40.020]   and so-called intermediate vector bosons.
[00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:43.020]   Those are the things that the standard model showcases
[00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:45.900]   and general relativity showcases gravity.
[00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:47.240]   And then you have matter,
[00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:50.780]   which is accommodated in both theories,
[00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:53.980]   but much more beautifully inside of the standard model.
[00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:57.700]   - So what does a theory of everything do?
[00:18:57.700 --> 00:18:59.020]   - So first of all,
[00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:01.280]   I think that that's the first place
[00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:02.580]   where we haven't talked enough.
[00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:05.380]   We assume that we know what it means,
[00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:07.900]   but we don't actually have any idea what it means.
[00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:08.940]   And what I claim it is,
[00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:13.940]   is that it's a theory where the questions beyond that theory
[00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:17.060]   are no longer of a mathematical nature.
[00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:20.660]   In other words, if I say,
[00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:25.660]   let us take X to be a four-dimensional manifold,
[00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:29.300]   to a mathematician or physicist, I've said very little.
[00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:30.460]   I've simply said,
[00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:33.980]   there's some place for calculus and linear algebra
[00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:36.220]   to dance together and to play.
[00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:38.860]   And that's what manifolds are.
[00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:40.220]   They're the most natural place
[00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:45.220]   where our two greatest math theories can really intertwine.
[00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:48.580]   - Which are the two?
[00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:50.620]   Oh, you mean calculus and linear algebra, yep.
[00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:51.460]   - Right.
[00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:52.940]   Okay, now the question is,
[00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:56.100]   beyond that, so it's sort of like saying,
[00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:58.380]   I'm an artist and I want to order a canvas.
[00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:02.260]   Now the question is,
[00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:04.180]   does the canvas paint itself?
[00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:09.100]   Does the canvas come up with an artist
[00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:15.620]   and paint an ink, which then paint the canvas?
[00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:18.700]   Like that's the hard part about theories of everything,
[00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:21.020]   which I don't think people talk enough about.
[00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:23.180]   - Can we just, you bring up Escher
[00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:25.460]   and the hand that draws itself.
[00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:28.020]   - The fire that lights itself or drawing hands.
[00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:28.860]   - The drawing hands.
[00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:29.700]   - Yeah.
[00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:32.100]   - And every time I start to think about that,
[00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:34.700]   my mind like shuts down.
[00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:35.540]   - No, don't do that.
[00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:38.020]   - There's a spark.
[00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:39.340]   - No, but this is the most beautiful part.
[00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:40.180]   We should do this together.
[00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:45.180]   - No, it's beautiful, but this robot's brain sparks fly.
[00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:52.420]   So can we try to say the same thing over and over
[00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:56.980]   in different ways about what you mean
[00:20:56.980 --> 00:20:59.700]   by that having to be a thing we have to contend with?
[00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:00.700]   - Sure.
[00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:05.280]   - Like why do you think that creating a theory of everything
[00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:07.180]   as you call the source code,
[00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:08.860]   our understanding our source code,
[00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:13.100]   require a view like the hand that draws itself?
[00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:14.460]   - Okay, well, here's what goes on
[00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:17.300]   in the regular physics picture.
[00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:18.780]   We've got these two main theories,
[00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:21.180]   general relativity and the standard model, right?
[00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:26.920]   Think of general relativity as more or less
[00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:30.980]   the theory of the canvas, okay?
[00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:34.820]   Maybe you have the canvas in a particularly rigid shape,
[00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:35.740]   maybe you've measured it,
[00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:37.620]   so it's got length and it's got angle,
[00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:40.820]   but more or less it's just canvas and length and angle,
[00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:44.660]   and that's all that really general relativity is,
[00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:46.960]   but it allows the canvas to warp a bit.
[00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:50.660]   Then we have the second thing,
[00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:55.660]   which is this import of foreign libraries,
[00:21:55.660 --> 00:22:00.780]   which aren't tied to space and time.
[00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:03.020]   So we've got this crazy set of symmetries
[00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:06.300]   called SU3 cross SU2 cross U1.
[00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:09.660]   We've got this collection of 16 particles in a generation,
[00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:11.720]   which are these sort of twisted spinners,
[00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:14.940]   and we've got three copies of them.
[00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:17.380]   Then we've got this weird Higgs field that comes in
[00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:19.260]   and like deus ex machina,
[00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:22.500]   solves all the problems that have been created in the play
[00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:24.140]   that can't be resolved otherwise.
[00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:25.300]   - So that's the standard model,
[00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:28.060]   quantum field theory just plopped on top of this canvas.
[00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:30.980]   - It's a problem of the double origin story.
[00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:33.700]   One origin story is about space and time,
[00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:36.020]   the other origin story is about what we would call
[00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:40.100]   internal quantum numbers and internal symmetries.
[00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:43.420]   And then there was an attempt to get one
[00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:45.800]   to follow from the other called Calusa-Klein theory,
[00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:46.960]   which didn't work out.
[00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:51.580]   And this is sort of in that vein.
[00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:55.300]   - So you said origin story.
[00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:58.300]   So in the hand that draws itself, what is it?
[00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:02.140]   - So it's as if you had the canvas
[00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:05.940]   and then you ordered up also give me paint brushes,
[00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:08.180]   paints, pigments, pencils, and artists.
[00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:09.740]   - But you're saying that's like,
[00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:12.860]   if you wanna create a universe from scratch,
[00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:15.060]   the canvas should be generating the paint brushes
[00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:16.940]   and the paint brushes should be generating the canvas.
[00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:18.140]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, right.
[00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:19.420]   Like you should-- - Who's the artist
[00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:20.340]   in this analogy?
[00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:22.220]   - Well, this is, sorry,
[00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:23.740]   then we're gonna get into a religious thing
[00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:24.980]   and I don't wanna do that.
[00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:25.800]   - Okay.
[00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:29.700]   - Well, you know my shtick, which is that we are the AI.
[00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:32.300]   We have two great stories about the simulation
[00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:34.180]   and artificial general intelligence.
[00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:39.140]   In one story, man fears that some program
[00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:41.620]   we've given birth to will become self-aware,
[00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:44.820]   smarter than us, and will take over.
[00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:48.820]   In another story, there are genius simulators
[00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:51.340]   and we live in their simulation.
[00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:54.040]   And we haven't realized that those two stories
[00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:55.580]   are the same story.
[00:23:55.580 --> 00:24:00.220]   In one case, we are the simulator.
[00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:02.140]   In another case, we are the simulated.
[00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:06.180]   And if you buy those and you put them together,
[00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:09.260]   we are the AGI and whether or not we have simulators,
[00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:12.500]   we may be trying to wake up by learning our own source code.
[00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:14.100]   So this could be our Skynet moment,
[00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:17.380]   which is one of the reasons I have some issues around it.
[00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:19.340]   - I think we'll talk about that 'cause I--
[00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:21.100]   - Well, that's the issue of the emergent artist
[00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:23.620]   within the story, just to get back to the point.
[00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:26.340]   Okay, so now the key point is,
[00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:27.980]   the standard way we tell the story
[00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:30.460]   is that Einstein sets the canvas
[00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:32.780]   and then we order all the stuff that we want
[00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:36.500]   and then that paints the picture that is our universe.
[00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:42.700]   So you order the paint, you order the artist,
[00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:46.700]   you order the brushes, and that then,
[00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:48.220]   when you collide the two,
[00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:50.180]   gives you two separate origin stories.
[00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:52.780]   The canvas came from one place
[00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:54.940]   and everything else came from somewhere else.
[00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:58.500]   - So what are the mathematical tools required
[00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:03.500]   to construct consistent geometric theory
[00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:07.900]   and make this concrete?
[00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:12.900]   - Well, somehow, you need to get three copies, for example,
[00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:17.500]   of generations with 16 particles each.
[00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:21.180]   And so the question would be,
[00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:24.700]   well, there's a lot of special personality
[00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:26.580]   in those symmetries.
[00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:27.940]   Where would they come from?
[00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:31.660]   So for example, you've got what would be called
[00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:36.660]   grand unified theories that sound like SU5,
[00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:38.260]   the George I. Glashow theory.
[00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:40.500]   There's something that should be called spin 10,
[00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:43.780]   but physicists insist on calling it SO10.
[00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:46.380]   There's something called the Petit-Salam theory
[00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:49.860]   that tends to be called SU4 cross SU2 cross SU2,
[00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:52.420]   which should be called spin six cross spin four.
[00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:53.900]   I can get into all of these.
[00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:56.100]   - Now what are they all accomplishing?
[00:25:56.100 --> 00:25:58.860]   - They're all taking the known forces that we see
[00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:01.740]   and packaging them up to say,
[00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:04.900]   we can't get rid of the second origin story,
[00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:08.820]   but we can at least make that origin story more unified.
[00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:11.500]   So they're trying, grand unification is the attempt to--
[00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:13.100]   - And that's a mistake in your--
[00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:14.380]   - It's not a mistake.
[00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:17.140]   The problem is, is it was born lifeless.
[00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:19.620]   When George I. Glashow first came out
[00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:24.060]   with the SU5 theory, it was very exciting
[00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:28.020]   because it could be tested in a South Dakota mine
[00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:29.820]   filled up with like, I don't know,
[00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:31.300]   cleaning fluid or something like that.
[00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:33.940]   And they looked for proton decay and didn't see it,
[00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:36.380]   and then they gave up because in that day
[00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:37.720]   when your experiment didn't work,
[00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:39.820]   you gave up on the theory.
[00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:42.700]   It didn't come to us born of a fusion
[00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:45.820]   between Einstein and Bohr.
[00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:49.980]   And that was kind of the problem
[00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:51.360]   is that it had this weird parenting
[00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:52.820]   where it was just on the Bohr side.
[00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:55.020]   There was no Einsteinian contribution.
[00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:58.060]   (sighs)
[00:26:58.060 --> 00:26:59.620]   Lex, how can I help you most?
[00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:03.460]   I'm trying to figure out what questions you wanna ask
[00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:05.800]   so that you get the most satisfying answers.
[00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:09.900]   - There's a bunch of questions I wanna ask.
[00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:13.380]   I mean, one, and I'm trying to sneak up on you
[00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:18.380]   somehow to reveal in a accessible way
[00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:22.180]   the nature of our universe.
[00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:24.700]   - So I can just give you a guess, right?
[00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:27.740]   We have to be very careful that we're not claiming
[00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:30.020]   that this has been accepted.
[00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:31.620]   This is a speculation.
[00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:33.660]   But I will make the speculation
[00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:35.620]   that I think what you would wanna ask me
[00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:37.940]   is how can the canvas generate all the stuff
[00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:40.380]   that usually has to be ordered separately?
[00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:41.400]   All right, should we do that?
[00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:42.700]   - Let's go there. - Okay.
[00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:47.480]   So the first thing is is that you have a concept
[00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:50.700]   in computers called technical debt.
[00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:52.220]   You're coding and you cut corners,
[00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:53.740]   and you know you're gonna have to do it
[00:27:53.740 --> 00:27:57.540]   right before the thing is safe for the world.
[00:27:57.540 --> 00:28:02.220]   But you're piling up some series of IOUs
[00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:04.920]   to yourself and your project as you're going along.
[00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:09.500]   So the first thing is we can't figure out
[00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:11.500]   if you have only four degrees of freedom,
[00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:13.060]   and that's what your canvas is,
[00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:15.540]   how do you get at least Einstein's world?
[00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:19.280]   Einstein said, look, it's not just four degrees of freedom,
[00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:21.580]   but there need to be rulers and protractors
[00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:23.640]   to measure length and angle in the world.
[00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:27.020]   You can't just have a flabby four degrees of freedom.
[00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:31.900]   So the first thing you do is you create 10 extra variables,
[00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:34.420]   which is like if we can't choose any particular set
[00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:37.620]   of rulers and protractors to measure length and angle,
[00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:42.140]   let's take the set of all possible rulers and protractors,
[00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:46.260]   and that would be called symmetric non-degenerate two tensors
[00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:49.220]   on the tangent space of the four manifold X4.
[00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:53.100]   Now, because there are four degrees of freedom,
[00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:54.700]   you start off with four dimensions,
[00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:56.160]   then you need four rulers
[00:28:56.160 --> 00:29:00.840]   for each of those different directions, so that's four,
[00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:02.560]   that gets us up to eight variables,
[00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:05.360]   and then between four original variables,
[00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:06.940]   there are six possible angles.
[00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:10.560]   So four plus four plus six is equal to 14.
[00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:14.800]   So now you've replaced X4 with another space,
[00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:16.760]   which in the lecture, I think I called U14,
[00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:18.260]   but I'm now calling Y14.
[00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:20.820]   This is one of the big problems of working on something
[00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:22.420]   in private is every time you pull it out,
[00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:23.440]   you sort of can't remember it,
[00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:25.240]   and you name something new.
[00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:27.680]   Okay, so you've got a 14-dimensional world,
[00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:29.920]   which is the original four-dimensional world,
[00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:34.140]   plus a lot of extra gadgetry for measurement.
[00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:37.320]   - And because you're not in the four-dimensional world,
[00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:38.880]   you don't have the technical debt.
[00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:40.720]   - No, now you've got a lot of technical debt,
[00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:43.320]   because now you have to explain away a 14-dimensional world,
[00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:45.960]   which is a big, you're taking a huge advance
[00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:48.080]   on your payday check, right?
[00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:52.040]   - But aren't more dimensions allow you more freedom?
[00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:54.180]   - Maybe, but you have to get rid of them somehow,
[00:29:54.180 --> 00:29:56.140]   because we don't perceive them.
[00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:57.400]   - So eventually you have to collapse it down
[00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:58.740]   to the thing that we perceive.
[00:29:58.740 --> 00:30:03.080]   - Or you have to sample a four-dimensional filament
[00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:04.960]   within that 14-dimensional world,
[00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:06.520]   known as a section of a bundle.
[00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:12.300]   - Okay, so how do we get from the 14-dimensional world,
[00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:13.500]   where I imagine a lot of--
[00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:15.180]   - Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:16.020]   You're cheating.
[00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:17.660]   The first question was,
[00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:21.040]   how do we get something from almost nothing?
[00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:22.840]   Like how do we get the,
[00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:25.340]   if I've said that the who and the what
[00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:29.620]   in the newspaper story that is a theory of everything
[00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:32.000]   are bosons and fermions,
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:35.120]   so let's make the who the fermions and the what the bosons.
[00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:38.420]   Think of it as the players and the equipment for a game.
[00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:39.740]   - Are we supposed to be thinking
[00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:42.780]   of actual physical things with mass or energy?
[00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:44.020]   - Sure, yep. - Okay.
[00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:47.340]   - So think about everything you see in this room.
[00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:49.340]   So from chemistry, you know it's all protons,
[00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:50.580]   neutrons, and electrons,
[00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:54.720]   but from a little bit of late 1960s physics,
[00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:56.520]   we know that the protons and neutrons
[00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:59.220]   are all made of up quarks and down quarks.
[00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:01.740]   So everything in this room is basically up quarks,
[00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:03.740]   down quarks, and electrons stuck together
[00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:08.220]   with the what, the equipment, okay?
[00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:11.740]   Now, the way we see it currently
[00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:15.460]   is we see that there are spacetime indices,
[00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:17.740]   which we would call spinners,
[00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:19.620]   that correspond to the who,
[00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:21.820]   that is the fermions, the matter, the stuff,
[00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:24.440]   the up quarks, the down quarks, the electrons,
[00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:29.440]   and there are also 16 degrees of freedom
[00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:34.380]   that come from this space of internal quantum numbers.
[00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:40.360]   So in my theory, in 14 dimensions,
[00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:44.380]   there's no internal quantum number space that figures in.
[00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:47.480]   It's all just spinorial.
[00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:53.480]   So spinners in 14 dimensions without any festooning
[00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:57.840]   with extra linear algebraic information.
[00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:03.080]   There's a concept of spinners,
[00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:05.520]   which is natural if you have a manifold
[00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:07.780]   with length and angle.
[00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:12.300]   And Y14 is almost a manifold with length and angle.
[00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:16.360]   It's so close.
[00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:19.760]   In other words, because you're looking at the space
[00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:21.400]   of all rulers and protractors,
[00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:23.320]   maybe it's not that surprising
[00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:25.200]   that a space of rulers and protractors
[00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:27.720]   might come very close to having rulers and protractors
[00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:29.120]   on it itself.
[00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:31.940]   Like, can you measure the space of measurements?
[00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:33.080]   And you almost can't.
[00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:36.680]   In a space that has length and angle,
[00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:39.000]   if it doesn't have a topological obstruction,
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.360]   comes with these objects called spinners.
[00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:47.280]   Now, spinners are the stuff of our world.
[00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:49.240]   We are made of spinners.
[00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:51.640]   They're the most important really deep object
[00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:52.680]   that I can tell you about.
[00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:53.800]   They were very surprising.
[00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:55.520]   - What is a spinner?
[00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:58.920]   - So famously, there are these weird things
[00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:03.200]   that require 720 degrees of rotation
[00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:06.720]   in order to come back to normal.
[00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:08.920]   And that doesn't make sense.
[00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:11.840]   And the reason for this is that there's a knottedness
[00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:15.920]   in our three-dimensional world that people don't observe.
[00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:20.920]   And you can famously see it by this Dirac string trick.
[00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:22.600]   So if you take a glass of water,
[00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:23.880]   imagine that this was a tumbler
[00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:25.840]   and I didn't want to spill any of it.
[00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:29.440]   And the question is, if I rotate the cup
[00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:34.120]   without losing my grip on the base 360 degrees,
[00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:35.780]   and I can't go backwards,
[00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:38.640]   is there any way I can take a sip?
[00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:40.640]   And the answer is this weird motion,
[00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:45.640]   which is go over first and under second.
[00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:50.080]   And that's 720 degrees of rotation to come back to normal
[00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:51.640]   so that I can take a sip.
[00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:53.000]   Well, that weird principle,
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.080]   which sometimes is known as the Philippine wine glass dance
[00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:58.760]   because waitresses in the Philippines
[00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:00.480]   apparently learned how to do this.
[00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:06.600]   That move defines, if you will,
[00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:10.800]   this hidden space that nobody knew was there of spinners,
[00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:14.120]   which Dirac figured out when he took the square root
[00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:16.420]   of something called the Klein-Gordon equation,
[00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:22.160]   which I think had earlier work incorporated
[00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:25.360]   from Cartan and Killing and Company in mathematics.
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:27.720]   So spinners are one of the most profound aspects
[00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:28.960]   of human existence.
[00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:31.060]   - And you forgive me for the perhaps dumb questions,
[00:34:31.060 --> 00:34:34.200]   but would a spinner be the mathematical object
[00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:37.760]   that's the basic unit of our universe?
[00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:41.420]   - When you start with a manifold,
[00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:46.960]   which is just like something like a donut or a sphere
[00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:48.940]   or a circle or a Möbius band,
[00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:53.880]   a spinner is usually the first wildly surprising thing
[00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:57.080]   that you found was hidden in your original purchase.
[00:34:57.080 --> 00:35:02.400]   So you order a manifold and you didn't even realize,
[00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:05.900]   it's like buying a house and finding a panic room inside
[00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:07.680]   that you hadn't counted on.
[00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:09.600]   It's very surprising when you understand
[00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:12.000]   that spinners are running around in your spaces.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:15.280]   - Again, perhaps a dumb question,
[00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:18.680]   but we're talking about 14 dimensions and four dimensions.
[00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:22.240]   What is the manifold we're operating under?
[00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:24.400]   - So in my case, it's proto-spacetime.
[00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:28.320]   It's before Einstein can slap rulers
[00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:31.080]   and protractors on spacetime.
[00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:32.840]   - What you mean by that, sorry to interrupt,
[00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:36.680]   is spacetime is the 4D manifold?
[00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:39.440]   - Spacetime is a four-dimensional manifold
[00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:40.800]   with extra structure.
[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:42.920]   - What's the extra structure?
[00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:47.920]   - It's called a semi-Romanian or pseudo-Romanian metric.
[00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:51.040]   And in essence, there is something akin
[00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:55.400]   to a four by four symmetric matrix,
[00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:57.760]   which is equivalent to length and angle.
[00:35:57.760 --> 00:35:59.620]   So when I talk about rulers and protractors
[00:35:59.620 --> 00:36:01.620]   or I talk about length and angle,
[00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:04.160]   or I talk about Ramanian or pseudo-Romanian
[00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:06.120]   or semi-Romanian manifolds,
[00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:08.680]   I'm usually talking about the same thing.
[00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:10.680]   Can you measure how long something is
[00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:15.680]   and what the angle is between two different rays or vectors?
[00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:19.000]   So that's what Einstein gave us as his arena,
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   his place to play, his canvas.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.080]   - There's a bunch of questions I can ask here,
[00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:31.100]   but like I said, I'm working on this book,
[00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:32.680]   Geometric Unity for Idiots.
[00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:39.720]   And I think what would be really nice as your editor,
[00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:45.280]   to have beautiful, maybe even visualizations
[00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:48.840]   that people could try to play with,
[00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:51.380]   try to reveal small little beauties
[00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:53.360]   about the way you're thinking about this world.
[00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:55.820]   - Well, I usually use the Joe Rogan program for that.
[00:36:55.820 --> 00:36:59.180]   Sometimes I have him doing the Philippine wine glass dance.
[00:36:59.180 --> 00:37:01.100]   I had the hop vibration.
[00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:02.280]   The part of the problem is,
[00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:05.980]   is that most people don't know this language
[00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:10.600]   about spinners, bundles, metrics, gauge fields.
[00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:13.580]   And they're very curious about the theory of everything,
[00:37:13.580 --> 00:37:15.020]   but they have no understanding
[00:37:15.020 --> 00:37:16.980]   of even what we know about our own world.
[00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:20.100]   - Is it a hopeless pursuit?
[00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:20.940]   - No.
[00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:22.100]   - Like even gauge theory.
[00:37:22.100 --> 00:37:23.420]   - Right.
[00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:26.300]   - I mean, it seems to be very inaccessible.
[00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:28.700]   Is there some aspect of it that could be made accessible?
[00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:30.600]   - I mean, I could go to the board right there
[00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:33.500]   and give you a five minute lecture on gauge theory
[00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:36.660]   that would be better than the official lecture
[00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:37.500]   on gauge theory.
[00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:39.500]   You would know what gauge theory was.
[00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:41.820]   - So it is possible to make it accessible.
[00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:43.900]   - Yeah, but nobody does.
[00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:47.540]   Like in other words, you're gonna watch over the next year,
[00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:50.560]   lots of different discussions about quantum entanglement,
[00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:54.440]   or the multiverse, where are we now?
[00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:57.820]   Or many worlds, are they all equally real?
[00:37:57.820 --> 00:38:00.720]   Right?
[00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:01.540]   - I mean, yeah, that's like--
[00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:03.020]   - Okay, but you're not gonna hear anything
[00:38:03.020 --> 00:38:05.400]   about the hop vibration except if it's from me,
[00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:06.880]   and I hate that.
[00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:08.980]   - Why can't you be the one?
[00:38:08.980 --> 00:38:10.800]   - Well, because I'm going a different path.
[00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:12.660]   I think that we've made a huge mistake,
[00:38:12.660 --> 00:38:14.840]   which is we have things we can show people
[00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:16.720]   about the actual models.
[00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:18.720]   We can push out visualizations
[00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:20.780]   where they're not listening by analogy,
[00:38:20.780 --> 00:38:23.360]   they're watching the same thing that we're seeing.
[00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:25.000]   And as I've said to you before,
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:28.200]   this is like choosing to perform sheet music
[00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:30.080]   that hasn't been performed in a long time,
[00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:32.560]   or the experts can't afford orchestras,
[00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:35.720]   so they just trade Beethoven symphonies as sheet music,
[00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:38.000]   and they go, oh, wow, that was beautiful.
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.480]   But it's like nobody heard anything.
[00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:41.600]   They just looked at the score.
[00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:44.160]   Well, that's how mathematicians and physicists
[00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:47.520]   trade papers and ideas, is that they write down
[00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:49.360]   the things that represent stuff.
[00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:53.200]   I want to at least close out this thought line
[00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:57.440]   that you started, which is how does the canvas
[00:38:57.440 --> 00:39:01.940]   order all of this other stuff into being?
[00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:05.880]   So I at least want to say some incomprehensible things
[00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:09.000]   about that, and then we'll have that much done, all right?
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:14.960]   - On that just point, does it have to be incomprehensible?
[00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:16.880]   - Do you know what the Schrodinger equation is?
[00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:17.720]   - Yes.
[00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:20.320]   - Do you know what the Dirac equation is?
[00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:22.200]   - What does no mean?
[00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:24.800]   - Well, my point is you're gonna have some feeling
[00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:27.320]   that you know what the Schrodinger equation is.
[00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:29.360]   As soon as we get to the Dirac equation,
[00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:32.460]   your eyes are gonna get a little bit glazed, right?
[00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:35.920]   So now why is that?
[00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:40.920]   Well, the answer to me is that you want to ask me
[00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:43.120]   about the theory of everything,
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:47.800]   but you haven't even digested the theory of everything
[00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:50.400]   as we've had it since 1928,
[00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:52.780]   when Dirac came out with his equation.
[00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:58.060]   So for whatever reason, and this isn't a hit on you,
[00:39:58.060 --> 00:40:02.720]   you haven't been motivated enough in all the time
[00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:05.480]   that you've been on Earth to at least get as far
[00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:06.800]   as the Dirac equation.
[00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:07.880]   And this was very interesting to me
[00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:09.840]   after I gave the talk in Oxford.
[00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:14.000]   New scientist who had done kind of a hatchet job on me
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.880]   to begin with sent a reporter to come to the third version
[00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:18.680]   of the talk that I gave,
[00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:21.600]   and that person had never heard of the Dirac equation.
[00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:26.880]   So you have a person who's completely professionally
[00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:31.000]   not qualified to ask these questions,
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:34.720]   wanting to know, well, how does your theory
[00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:35.920]   solve new problems?
[00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:38.240]   And like, well, in the case of the Dirac equation,
[00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:40.120]   well, tell me about that, I don't know what that is.
[00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:43.120]   So then the point is, okay, I got it.
[00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:47.160]   You're not even caught up minimally to where we are now,
[00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:50.640]   and that's not a knock on you, almost nobody is.
[00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:53.200]   But then how does it become my job
[00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:58.200]   to digest what has been available for like over 90 years?
[00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:02.120]   - Well, to me, the open question is
[00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:04.440]   whether what's been available for over 90 years
[00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:09.440]   can be, there could be a blueprint of a journey
[00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:13.640]   that one takes to understand it, not to--
[00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:15.040]   - Oh, I wanna do that with you.
[00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:17.080]   And one of the things I think
[00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:19.760]   I've been relatively successful at, for example,
[00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:23.860]   when you ask other people what gauge theory is,
[00:41:23.860 --> 00:41:26.560]   you get these very confusing responses.
[00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:28.000]   And my response is much simpler.
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:31.160]   It's, oh, it's a theory of differentiation,
[00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:34.560]   where when you calculate the instantaneous rise over run,
[00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:37.500]   you measure the rise not from a flat horizontal,
[00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:40.060]   but from a custom endogenous reference level.
[00:41:40.060 --> 00:41:42.360]   What do you mean by that?
[00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:44.840]   It's like, okay, and then I do this thing with Mount Everest,
[00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:47.480]   which is, Mount Everest is how high?
[00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:48.320]   Then they give the height.
[00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:49.160]   I say, above what?
[00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:50.120]   Then they say sea level.
[00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:52.760]   And I say, which sea is that in Nepal?
[00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:53.960]   They're like, oh, I guess there isn't a sea
[00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:54.880]   'cause it's landlocked.
[00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:57.080]   It's like, okay, well, what do you mean by sea level?
[00:41:57.080 --> 00:41:59.720]   Oh, there's this thing called the geoid I'd never heard of.
[00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:01.320]   Oh, that's the reference level.
[00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:04.640]   That's a custom reference level that we imported.
[00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:08.220]   So all sorts of people have remembered
[00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:10.280]   the exact height of Mount Everest
[00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:12.800]   without ever knowing what it's a height from.
[00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:16.340]   Well, in this case, in gauge theory,
[00:42:16.340 --> 00:42:17.840]   there's a hidden reference level
[00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:20.440]   where you measure the rise in rise over run
[00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:22.000]   to give the slope of a line.
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:25.200]   What if you have different concepts
[00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:30.080]   of where that rise should be measured from
[00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:31.320]   that vary within the theory,
[00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:33.480]   that are endogenous to the theory?
[00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:34.880]   That's what gauge theory is.
[00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:37.680]   Okay, we have a video here, right?
[00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:39.280]   - Yeah. - Okay.
[00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:40.440]   I'm gonna use my phone.
[00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:46.120]   If I wanna measure my hand and its slope,
[00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:49.880]   this is my attempt to measure it using standard calculus.
[00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:52.800]   In other words, the reference level is apparently flat,
[00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:57.760]   and I measure the rise above that phone using my hand, okay?
[00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:00.840]   If I wanna use gauge theory, it means I can do this,
[00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:03.640]   or I can do that, or I can do this, or I can do this,
[00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:06.840]   or I could do what I did from the beginning, okay?
[00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:09.440]   At some level, that's what gauge theory is.
[00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:10.280]   Now, that is an act.
[00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:13.960]   Now, I've never heard anyone describe it that way.
[00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:16.160]   So while the community may say, well, who is this guy?
[00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:18.160]   And why does he have the right to talk in public?
[00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:20.760]   I'm waiting for somebody to jump out of the woodwork
[00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:23.120]   and say, you know Eric's whole shtick
[00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:27.240]   about rulers and protractors leading to a derivative.
[00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:29.080]   Derivatives are measured as rise over run
[00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:29.920]   above a reference level.
[00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:31.080]   The reference level's not fit to get.
[00:43:31.080 --> 00:43:32.680]   Like, I go through this whole shtick
[00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:34.280]   in order to make it accessible.
[00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:35.840]   I've never heard anyone say it.
[00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:40.120]   I'm trying to make, Prometheus would like to discuss fire
[00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:41.320]   with everybody else.
[00:43:41.320 --> 00:43:44.120]   All right, I'm gonna just say one thing
[00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:45.760]   to close out the earlier line,
[00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:48.520]   which is what I think we should have continued with.
[00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:51.880]   When you take the naturally occurring spinners,
[00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:54.640]   the unadorned spinners, the naked spinners,
[00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:58.860]   not on this 14-dimensional manifold,
[00:43:58.860 --> 00:44:01.420]   but on something very closely tied to it,
[00:44:01.420 --> 00:44:04.280]   which I've called the chimeric tangent bundle,
[00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:07.920]   that is the object which stands in
[00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:10.040]   for the thing that should have had length and angle on it,
[00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:11.500]   but just missed, okay?
[00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:15.800]   When you take that object and you form spinners on that,
[00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:16.920]   and you don't adorn them,
[00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:19.160]   so you're still in the single origin story,
[00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:23.480]   you get very large spinorial objects
[00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:27.720]   upstairs on this 14-dimensional world, Y14,
[00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:29.680]   which is part of the observers.
[00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:34.680]   When you pull that information back from Y14 down to X4,
[00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:42.820]   it miraculously looks like the adorned spinners,
[00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:45.200]   the festooned spinners,
[00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:49.800]   the spinners that we play with in ordinary reality.
[00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:52.640]   In other words, the 14-dimensional world
[00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:54.640]   looks like a four-dimensional world
[00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:57.240]   plus a 10-dimensional complement.
[00:44:57.240 --> 00:44:59.540]   So 10 plus four equals 14.
[00:44:59.540 --> 00:45:01.200]   That 10-dimensional complement,
[00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:03.640]   which is called a normal bundle,
[00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:06.960]   generates spin properties, internal quantum numbers,
[00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:08.720]   that look like the things
[00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:10.960]   that give our particles personality,
[00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:15.040]   that make, let's say, up quarks and down quarks
[00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:19.480]   charged by negative 1/3 or plus 2/3,
[00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:21.400]   that kind of stuff, or whether or not
[00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:27.720]   some quarks feel the weak force and other quarks do not.
[00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:32.320]   So the X4 generates Y14.
[00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:35.560]   Y14 generates something called the chimeric tangent bundle.
[00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:38.680]   Chimeric tangent bundle generates unadorned spinners.
[00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:42.600]   The unadorned spinners get pulled back from 14 down to four,
[00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:45.320]   where they look like adorned spinners.
[00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:47.360]   And we have the right number of them.
[00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:48.720]   You thought you needed three.
[00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:50.520]   You only got two.
[00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:52.880]   But then something else that you'd never seen before
[00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:55.120]   broke apart on this journey,
[00:45:55.120 --> 00:45:57.720]   and it broke into another copy of the thing
[00:45:57.720 --> 00:45:59.440]   that you already have two copies of.
[00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:01.820]   One piece of that thing broke off.
[00:46:01.820 --> 00:46:03.640]   So now you have two generations
[00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:05.640]   plus an imposter third generation,
[00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:08.360]   which is, I don't know why we never talk
[00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:10.640]   about this possibility in regular physics.
[00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:12.560]   And then you've got a bunch of stuff that we haven't seen,
[00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:14.240]   which has descriptions.
[00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:15.080]   So people always say,
[00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:16.920]   does it make any falsifiable predictions?
[00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:17.760]   Yes, it does.
[00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:23.600]   It says that the matter that you should be seeing next
[00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:26.060]   has particular properties that can be read off.
[00:46:26.060 --> 00:46:28.160]   - Like?
[00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:30.960]   - Like weak isospin, weak hypercharge,
[00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:33.920]   like the responsiveness to the strong force.
[00:46:33.920 --> 00:46:34.840]   The one I can't tell you
[00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:36.840]   is what energy scale it would happen at.
[00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:41.840]   - So you can't say if those characteristics
[00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:43.960]   can be detected with the current--
[00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:45.360]   - It may be that somebody else can.
[00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:47.240]   I'm not a physicist.
[00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:48.520]   I'm not a quantum field theorist.
[00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:51.880]   I can't, I don't know how you would do that.
[00:46:51.880 --> 00:46:55.800]   - The hope for me is that there's some simple
[00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:58.880]   explanations for all of it.
[00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:00.360]   - Lex, should we have a drink?
[00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:02.640]   - You're having fun.
[00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:04.200]   - No, I'm trying to have fun with you.
[00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:07.040]   - Yeah, there's a bunch of fun things
[00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:10.880]   to talk about here.
[00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:14.040]   Anyway, that was how I got what I thought you wanted,
[00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:19.040]   which is if you think about the fermions as the artists
[00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:24.600]   and the bosons as the brushes and the paint,
[00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:28.280]   what I told you is that's how we get the artists.
[00:47:28.280 --> 00:47:32.240]   - What are the open questions for you in this?
[00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:34.080]   What are the challenges?
[00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:35.720]   So you're not done.
[00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:37.640]   - Well, there's things that I would like
[00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:39.480]   to have in better order.
[00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:41.880]   So a lot of people will say,
[00:47:41.880 --> 00:47:45.160]   the reason I hesitate on this is I just have
[00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:47.000]   a totally different view than the community.
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:50.520]   So for example, I believe that general relativity
[00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:55.000]   began in 1913 with Einstein and Grossman.
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:59.160]   Now that was the first of like four major papers
[00:47:59.160 --> 00:48:02.040]   in this line of thinking.
[00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:05.200]   To most physicists, general relativity happened
[00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:10.200]   when Einstein produced a divergence-free gradient,
[00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:15.600]   which turned out to be the gradient
[00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:18.800]   of the so-called Hilbert or Einstein-Hilbert action.
[00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:22.200]   And from my perspective, that wasn't true.
[00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:24.120]   This is that it began when Einstein said,
[00:48:24.120 --> 00:48:28.600]   look, this is about differential geometry
[00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:32.760]   and the final answer is gonna look like a curvature tensor
[00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:36.160]   on one side and matter and energy on the other side.
[00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:37.360]   And that was enough.
[00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:39.920]   And then he published a wrong version of it
[00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:42.760]   where it was the Ricci tensor, not the Einstein tensor.
[00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:45.000]   Then he corrected the Ricci tensor
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:46.820]   to make it into the Einstein tensor.
[00:48:46.820 --> 00:48:49.620]   Then he corrected that to add a cosmological constant.
[00:48:49.620 --> 00:48:54.680]   I can't stand that the community thinks in those terms.
[00:48:54.680 --> 00:48:57.040]   There's some things about which,
[00:48:57.040 --> 00:48:59.920]   like there's a question about which contraction do I use?
[00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:01.920]   There's an Einstein contraction,
[00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:03.200]   there's a Ricci contraction.
[00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:05.880]   They both go between the same spaces.
[00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:07.280]   I'm not sure what I should do.
[00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:10.360]   I'm not sure which contraction I should choose.
[00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:12.280]   This is called a Shiab operator
[00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:14.500]   for ship in a bottle in my stuff.
[00:49:14.500 --> 00:49:19.680]   - You have this big platform in many ways
[00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:23.640]   that inspires people's curiosity
[00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:25.760]   about physics and mathematics.
[00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:26.580]   - Right.
[00:49:26.580 --> 00:49:30.080]   - And I'm one of those people.
[00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:30.920]   - Well, great.
[00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:34.400]   - But then you start using a lot of words
[00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:35.600]   that I don't understand.
[00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:41.760]   And I might know them, but I don't understand.
[00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:43.360]   And what's unclear to me,
[00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:46.280]   if I'm supposed to be listening to those words,
[00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:50.400]   or if it's just, if this is one of those technical things
[00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:53.900]   that's intended for a very small community,
[00:49:53.900 --> 00:49:56.240]   or if I'm supposed to actually take those words
[00:49:56.240 --> 00:50:00.260]   and start a multi-year study.
[00:50:01.140 --> 00:50:03.620]   Not a serious study, but the kind of study
[00:50:03.620 --> 00:50:06.900]   when you're interested in learning about machine learning,
[00:50:06.900 --> 00:50:09.340]   for example, or any kind of discipline.
[00:50:09.340 --> 00:50:11.300]   That's where I'm a little bit confused.
[00:50:11.300 --> 00:50:14.720]   So you speak beautifully about ideas.
[00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:18.860]   You often reveal the beauty in geometry.
[00:50:18.860 --> 00:50:23.740]   And I'm unclear in what are the steps I should be taking.
[00:50:23.740 --> 00:50:27.540]   I'm curious, how can I explore?
[00:50:27.540 --> 00:50:28.740]   How can I play with something?
[00:50:28.740 --> 00:50:30.540]   How can I play with these ideas?
[00:50:30.540 --> 00:50:31.380]   - Right.
[00:50:31.380 --> 00:50:33.220]   - And enjoy the beauty of,
[00:50:33.220 --> 00:50:35.700]   not necessarily understanding the depth of a theory
[00:50:35.700 --> 00:50:39.060]   that you're presenting, but start to share in the beauty.
[00:50:39.060 --> 00:50:42.620]   As opposed to sharing and enjoying the beauty
[00:50:42.620 --> 00:50:45.580]   of just the way, the passion with which you speak,
[00:50:45.580 --> 00:50:50.140]   which is in itself fun to listen to,
[00:50:50.140 --> 00:50:53.380]   but also starting to be able to understand
[00:50:53.380 --> 00:50:57.020]   some aspects of this theory that I can enjoy it.
[00:50:57.540 --> 00:51:00.740]   To, and start to build an intuition,
[00:51:00.740 --> 00:51:02.660]   what the heck we're even talking about.
[00:51:02.660 --> 00:51:04.500]   'Cause you're basically saying we need to throw
[00:51:04.500 --> 00:51:09.500]   a lot of our ideas of views of the universe out.
[00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:16.180]   And I'm trying to find accessible ways in.
[00:51:16.180 --> 00:51:17.020]   - Okay.
[00:51:17.020 --> 00:51:19.060]   - Not in this conversation.
[00:51:19.060 --> 00:51:19.900]   - No, I appreciate that.
[00:51:19.900 --> 00:51:21.220]   So one of the things that I've done
[00:51:21.220 --> 00:51:24.760]   is I've picked on one paragraph from Edward Witten.
[00:51:26.220 --> 00:51:28.580]   And I've said, this is the paragraph.
[00:51:28.580 --> 00:51:30.700]   If I could only take one paragraph with me,
[00:51:30.700 --> 00:51:31.940]   this is the one I'd take.
[00:51:31.940 --> 00:51:34.340]   And it's almost all in prose, not in equations.
[00:51:34.340 --> 00:51:38.060]   And he says, look, this is our knowledge of the universe
[00:51:38.060 --> 00:51:39.260]   at its deepest level.
[00:51:39.260 --> 00:51:41.860]   And he was writing this during the 1980s.
[00:51:41.860 --> 00:51:44.140]   And he has three separate points
[00:51:44.140 --> 00:51:46.660]   that constitute our deepest knowledge.
[00:51:46.660 --> 00:51:49.860]   And those three points refer to equations.
[00:51:49.860 --> 00:51:51.540]   One to the Einstein field equation,
[00:51:51.540 --> 00:51:52.900]   one to the Dirac equation,
[00:51:52.900 --> 00:51:55.060]   and one to the Yang-Mills-Maxwell equation.
[00:51:55.820 --> 00:52:00.820]   Now, one thing I would do is take a look at that paragraph
[00:52:00.820 --> 00:52:05.020]   and say, okay, what do these three lines mean?
[00:52:05.020 --> 00:52:06.660]   Like it's a finite amount of verbiage.
[00:52:06.660 --> 00:52:09.860]   You can write down every word that you don't know.
[00:52:09.860 --> 00:52:10.700]   - Beautiful.
[00:52:10.700 --> 00:52:12.860]   - And you can say, what do I think?
[00:52:12.860 --> 00:52:13.700]   - Done.
[00:52:13.700 --> 00:52:15.700]   - Now, young man.
[00:52:15.700 --> 00:52:16.540]   - Yes.
[00:52:16.540 --> 00:52:20.740]   - There's a beautiful wall in Stony Brook, New York,
[00:52:20.740 --> 00:52:23.420]   built by someone who I know you will interview
[00:52:23.420 --> 00:52:24.580]   named Jim Simons.
[00:52:24.580 --> 00:52:28.820]   And Jim Simons, he's not the artist,
[00:52:28.820 --> 00:52:30.300]   but he's the guy who funded it.
[00:52:30.300 --> 00:52:32.260]   World's greatest hedge fund manager.
[00:52:32.260 --> 00:52:35.420]   And on that wall contain the three equations
[00:52:35.420 --> 00:52:39.420]   that Witten refers to in that paragraph.
[00:52:39.420 --> 00:52:40.980]   And so that is the transmission
[00:52:40.980 --> 00:52:44.580]   from the paragraph or graph to the wall.
[00:52:44.580 --> 00:52:48.500]   Now, that wall needs an owner's manual,
[00:52:48.500 --> 00:52:53.100]   which Roger Penrose has written called "The Road to Reality."
[00:52:53.100 --> 00:52:55.260]   Let's call that the tome.
[00:52:55.260 --> 00:52:57.420]   So this is the subject of the so-called
[00:52:57.420 --> 00:53:01.300]   graph wall tome project that is going on
[00:53:01.300 --> 00:53:04.620]   in our Discord server and our general group
[00:53:04.620 --> 00:53:06.180]   around the portal community,
[00:53:06.180 --> 00:53:09.700]   which is how do you take something that purports
[00:53:09.700 --> 00:53:13.260]   in one paragraph to say what the deepest understanding
[00:53:13.260 --> 00:53:15.560]   man has of the universe in which he lives.
[00:53:15.560 --> 00:53:21.460]   It's memorialized on a wall, which nobody knows about,
[00:53:21.460 --> 00:53:24.880]   which is an incredibly gorgeous piece of art.
[00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:28.060]   And that was written up in a book
[00:53:28.060 --> 00:53:30.660]   which has been written for no man.
[00:53:30.660 --> 00:53:33.380]   Maybe it's for a woman, I don't know.
[00:53:33.380 --> 00:53:35.980]   But no one should be able to read this book
[00:53:35.980 --> 00:53:38.500]   because either you're a professional
[00:53:38.500 --> 00:53:39.740]   and you know a lot of this book,
[00:53:39.740 --> 00:53:41.340]   in which case it's kind of a refresher
[00:53:41.340 --> 00:53:43.700]   to see how Roger thinks about these things.
[00:53:43.700 --> 00:53:45.200]   Or you don't even know that this book
[00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:48.060]   is a self-contained invitation
[00:53:48.060 --> 00:53:50.700]   to understanding our deepest nature.
[00:53:50.700 --> 00:53:52.500]   So I would say find yourself
[00:53:52.500 --> 00:53:55.800]   in the graph wall tome transmission sequence
[00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:59.700]   and join the graph wall tome project if that's of interest.
[00:53:59.700 --> 00:54:01.100]   - Okay, beautiful.
[00:54:01.100 --> 00:54:03.160]   Now just to linger on a little longer,
[00:54:03.160 --> 00:54:06.660]   what kind of journey do you see geometric unity taking?
[00:54:06.660 --> 00:54:07.580]   - I don't know.
[00:54:07.580 --> 00:54:09.380]   I mean, that's the thing is that first of all,
[00:54:09.380 --> 00:54:11.460]   the professional community has to get very angry
[00:54:11.460 --> 00:54:13.700]   and outraged and they have to work through
[00:54:13.700 --> 00:54:16.180]   their feeling that this is nonsense, this is bullshit,
[00:54:16.180 --> 00:54:19.220]   or like, no, wait a minute, this is really cool.
[00:54:19.220 --> 00:54:21.080]   Actually, I need some clarification over here.
[00:54:21.080 --> 00:54:22.660]   So there's gonna be some sort of
[00:54:22.660 --> 00:54:25.540]   weird coming back together process.
[00:54:25.540 --> 00:54:29.540]   - Are you already hearing murmurings of that?
[00:54:29.540 --> 00:54:30.420]   - That's very funny.
[00:54:30.420 --> 00:54:32.120]   Officially, I've seen very little.
[00:54:32.120 --> 00:54:35.860]   - So it's perhaps happening quietly.
[00:54:35.860 --> 00:54:36.700]   - Yeah.
[00:54:36.700 --> 00:54:38.860]   (silence)
[00:54:38.860 --> 00:54:41.020]   (silence)
[00:54:41.020 --> 00:54:43.180]   (silence)
[00:54:43.180 --> 00:54:45.340]   (silence)
[00:54:45.340 --> 00:54:47.500]   (silence)
[00:54:47.500 --> 00:54:49.660]   (silence)
[00:54:49.660 --> 00:54:51.820]   (silence)
[00:54:51.820 --> 00:54:53.980]   (silence)
[00:54:53.980 --> 00:55:03.980]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
