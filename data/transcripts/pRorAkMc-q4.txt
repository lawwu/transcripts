[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.900]   - You've done actually quite, done a lot of thinking
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.480]   and talking about neurology,
[00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.640]   just kind of look at human behavior through the lens
[00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:13.720]   of looking at how actually chemically our brain works.
[00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:18.520]   So what, first of all, why did you connect with that idea
[00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.120]   and what have you, how has your view of the world changed
[00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:27.000]   by considering the brain is just a machine?
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.120]   - You know, I know it probably sounds really nihilistic,
[00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.160]   but for me, it's very liberating
[00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.040]   to know a lot about neurochemicals
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.640]   because you don't have to,
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.040]   it's like the same thing with like critics,
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.320]   like critical reviews, if you believe the good,
[00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.680]   you have to believe the bad kind of thing.
[00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.480]   Like, you know, if you believe that your bad choices
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.320]   were because of your moral integrity or whatever,
[00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.320]   you have to believe your good ones.
[00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.880]   I just think there's something really liberating
[00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.640]   and going like, oh, that was just adrenaline.
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.280]   I just said that thing 'cause I was adrenalized
[00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.680]   and I was scared and my amygdala was activated
[00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.960]   and that's why I said you're an asshole and get out.
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.320]   And that's, you know, I just think it's important
[00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.400]   to delineate what's nature and what's nurture,
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.640]   what is your choice and what is just your brain
[00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.640]   trying to keep you safe.
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.160]   I think we forget that even though we have security systems
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.000]   and homes and locks on our doors,
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.160]   that our brain for the most part
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.840]   is just trying to keep us safe all the time.
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.960]   It's why we hold grudges, it's why we get angry,
[00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.360]   it's why we get road rage, it's why we do a lot of things.
[00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.880]   And it's also, when I started learning about neurology,
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.280]   I started having so much more compassion for other people.
[00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.840]   You know, if someone yelled at me,
[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.160]   being like, fuck you on the road,
[00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.160]   I'd be like, okay, he's producing adrenaline right now
[00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.240]   because we're all going 65 miles an hour
[00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.840]   and our brains aren't really designed
[00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.840]   for this type of stress and he's scared.
[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.880]   He was scared, you know, so that really helped me
[00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.920]   to have more love for people in my everyday life
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.560]   instead of being in fight or flight mode.
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.680]   But the, I think, more interesting answer to your question
[00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.240]   is that I've had migraines my whole life.
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.560]   Like I've suffered with really intense migraines,
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.880]   ocular migraines, ones where my arm would go numb
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.520]   and I just started having to go to so many doctors
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.760]   to learn about it.
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.560]   And I started, you know, learning that
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.200]   we don't really know that much.
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.040]   We know a lot, but it's wild to go into
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.400]   one of the best neurologists in the world
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.240]   who's like, yeah, we don't know.
[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.840]   - We don't know. - We don't know.
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.160]   And that fascinated me.
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.320]   - It's like one of the worst pains
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.040]   you can probably have, all that stuff.
[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.840]   And we don't know the source.
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:18.840]   - We don't know the source.
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.920]   And there is something really fascinating
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.000]   about when your left arm starts going numb
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.520]   and you start not being able to see
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.320]   out of the left side of both your eyes.
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.840]   And I remember when the migraines get really bad,
[00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.360]   it's like a mini stroke almost,
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.360]   and you're able to see words on a page,
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.720]   but I can't read them.
[00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.560]   They just look like symbols to me.
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.480]   So there's something just really fascinating to me
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.760]   about your brain just being able to stop functioning.
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.120]   And so I just wanted to learn about it, study about it.
[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.840]   I did all these weird alternative treatments.
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.360]   I got this piercing in here that actually works.
[00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.480]   I've tried everything.
[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.680]   And then both of my parents had strokes.
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.520]   So when both of my parents had strokes,
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.640]   I became sort of the person who had to decide
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.120]   what was gonna happen with their recovery,
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.600]   which is just a wild thing to have to deal with it,
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.600]   you know, 28 years old when it happened.
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.560]   And I started spending basically all day, every day
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.280]   in ICUs with neurologists learning about
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.560]   what happened to my dad's brain
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.640]   and why he can't move his left arm,
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.000]   but he can move his right leg,
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.680]   but he can't see out of the, you know.
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.440]   And then my mom had another stroke
[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.520]   in a different part of the brain.
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.200]   And so I started having to learn
[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.040]   what parts of the brain did what
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.400]   and so that I wouldn't take their behavior so personally
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.520]   and so that I would be able to manage my expectations
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.960]   in terms of their recovery.
[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.800]   So my mom, because it affected a lot of her frontal lobe,
[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.640]   changed a lot as a person.
[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.120]   She was way more emotional.
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.320]   She was way more micromanaged.
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.560]   She was forgetting certain things.
[00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.880]   So it broke my heart less when I was able to know,
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.640]   oh yeah, well, the stroke hit this part of the brain
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.760]   and that's the one that's responsible for short-term memory
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.600]   and that's responsible for long-term memory, da-da-da.
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.240]   And then my brother just got something
[00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.160]   called viral encephalitis,
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.800]   which is an infection inside the brain.
[00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.840]   So it was kind of wild that I was able to go,
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.200]   oh, I know exactly what's happening here.
[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.320]   And I know, you know, so.
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.000]   - So that allows you to have some more compassion
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   for the struggles that people have.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.160]   But does it take away some of the magic
[00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.920]   for some of the,
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.520]   from some of the more positive experiences of life?
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:16.520]   - Sometimes.
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:19.920]   Sometimes, and I don't, I'm such a control addict
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.680]   that, you know, I think our biggest,
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:23.960]   someone like me,
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.560]   my biggest dream is to know why someone's doing it.
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:26.800]   That's what stand-up is.
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.000]   It's just trying to figure out why,
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.640]   or that's what writing is, that's what acting is,
[00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:30.480]   that's what performing is.
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.040]   It's trying to figure out why someone would do something.
[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.600]   As an actor, you get a piece of, you know, material
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.680]   and you go, this person, why would he say that?
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.360]   Why would she pick up that cup?
[00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.600]   Why would she walk over here?
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.120]   It's really why, why, why, why.
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.560]   So I think neurology is,
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.880]   if you're trying to figure out human motives
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.080]   and why people do what they do,
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.560]   it'd be crazy not to understand
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.600]   how neurochemicals motivate us.
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.600]   I also have a lot of addiction in my family
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.000]   and hardcore drug addiction and mental illness.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.240]   And in order to cope with it,
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.280]   you really have to understand it.
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.520]   Borderline personality disorder,
[00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.880]   schizophrenia, and drug addiction.
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.160]   So I have a lot of people I love
[00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.400]   that suffer from drug addiction and alcoholism.
[00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.280]   And the first thing they started teaching you
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.440]   is it's not a choice.
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:11.920]   These people's dopamine receptors
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.160]   don't hold dopamine the same ways yours do.
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.120]   Their frontal lobe is underdeveloped.
[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.120]   Like, you know, and that really helped me
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.440]   to navigate loving people
[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.760]   that were addicted to substances.
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.120]   - I wanna be careful with this question,
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.760]   but how much--
[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:29.880]   - Money do you have?
[00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:30.720]   - How much--
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.040]   (laughing)
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.320]   Can I borrow $10?
[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.440]   (laughing)
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.280]   Okay.
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:41.040]   No, is how much control,
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.280]   how much, despite the chemical imbalances
[00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.440]   or the biological limitations
[00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.000]   that each of our individual brains have,
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.600]   how much mind over matter is there?
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.960]   So through things,
[00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.720]   and I've known people with clinical depression,
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.080]   and so it's always a touchy subject
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.200]   to say how much they can really help it.
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:03.040]   - Very.
[00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:06.200]   - What can you, yeah, what can you,
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.080]   'cause you've talked about codependency,
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.920]   you've talked about issues that you struggle through,
[00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:14.400]   and nevertheless, you choose to take a journey
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:15.640]   of healing and so on.
[00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:18.760]   So that's your choice, that's your actions.
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:22.240]   So how much can you do to help fight the limitations
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.560]   of the neurochemicals in your brain?
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.360]   - That's such an interesting question,
[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.000]   and I don't think I'm at all qualified to answer it,
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.080]   but I'll say what I do know.
[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.720]   And really quick, just the definition of codependency,
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.440]   I think a lot of people think of codependency
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:37.200]   as like two people that can't stop hanging out,
[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.720]   you know, or like, you know,
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.160]   that's not totally off,
[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:42.800]   but I think for the most part,
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.480]   my favorite definition of codependency
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:47.440]   is the inability to tolerate the discomfort of others.
[00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:48.600]   You grow up in an alcoholic home,
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:51.000]   you grow up around mental illness, you grow up in chaos,
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.800]   you have a parent that's a narcissist,
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:56.040]   you basically are wired to just people please,
[00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:59.240]   worry about others, be perfect, walk on eggshells,
[00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:01.200]   shape shift to accommodate other people.
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:06.200]   So codependence is a very active wiring issue
[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:09.040]   that, you know, doesn't just affect
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.200]   your romantic relationships,
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:11.560]   it affects you being a boss,
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:15.040]   it affects you in the world online,
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:16.560]   you know, you get one negative comment
[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:18.720]   and it throws you for two weeks,
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.720]   you know, it also is linked to eating disorders
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:21.680]   and other kinds of addiction.
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:24.720]   So it's a very big thing.
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:26.520]   And I think a lot of people sometimes only think
[00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:28.040]   that it's in romantic relationships,
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.480]   so I always feel the need to say that.
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:32.600]   And also one of the reasons I love the idea of robots
[00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:34.920]   so much because you don't have to walk on eggshells
[00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.080]   around them, you don't have to worry
[00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:37.840]   they're gonna get mad at you yet,
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:42.520]   but codependence are hypersensitive to the needs
[00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:45.880]   and moods of others, and it's very exhausting.
[00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:46.720]   It's depleting.
[00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:49.920]   Just one conversation about where we're gonna go to dinner
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:51.760]   is like, do you wanna go get Chinese food?
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:52.920]   We just had Chinese food.
[00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:54.640]   Well, wait, are you mad?
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:57.000]   Well, no, I didn't mean to, and it's just like,
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.160]   codependence live in this, everything means something
[00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:04.680]   and humans can be very emotionally exhausting.
[00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:05.680]   Why did you look at me that way?
[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:06.520]   What are you thinking about?
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:07.360]   What was that?
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:08.280]   It's not your phone.
[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:11.320]   It's a hypersensitivity that can be incredibly
[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:13.400]   time-consuming, which is why I love the idea
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:15.280]   of robots just subbing in.
[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:18.360]   Even I've had a hard time running TV shows and stuff
[00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:19.880]   because even asking someone to do something,
[00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:21.080]   I don't wanna come off like a bitch.
[00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:23.200]   I'm very concerned about what other people think of me,
[00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:26.160]   how I'm perceived, which is why I think robots
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.400]   will be very beneficial for codependence.
[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:30.160]   - By the way, just a real quick tangent,
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:33.680]   that skill or flaw, whatever you wanna call it,
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:36.640]   is actually really useful for if you ever do
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:39.160]   start your own podcast for interviewing
[00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:41.000]   because you're now kind of obsessed
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.760]   about the mindset of others
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:47.240]   and it makes you a good sort of listener and talker.
[00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:53.080]   So I think, what's her name from NPR?
[00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:56.200]   Terry Gross talked about having that.
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:58.240]   - I don't feel like she has that at all.
[00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:00.760]   (laughing)
[00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:01.600]   What?
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:05.240]   She worries about other people's feelings?
[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:06.320]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:08.240]   - Oh, I don't get that at all.
[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:09.760]   - I mean, you have to put yourself in the mind
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:11.680]   of the person you're speaking with.
[00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:13.640]   - Yes, oh, I see, just in terms of, yeah,
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:15.960]   I am starting a podcast and the reason I haven't
[00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:17.560]   is because I'm codependent and I'm too worried
[00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:18.880]   it's not gonna be perfect.
[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:22.800]   So a big codependent adage is perfectionism
[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:24.880]   leads to procrastination, which leads to paralysis.
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:26.800]   - So how do you, sorry to take a million tangents,
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:28.120]   how do you survive on social media?
[00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:29.720]   'Cause you're exceptionally active.
[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:31.120]   - But by the way, I took you on a tangent
[00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:32.360]   and didn't answer your last question
[00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:34.480]   about how much we can control.
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:36.120]   - I want you, yeah, we'll return it
[00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:37.480]   or maybe not. - Okay.
[00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:38.320]   - The answer is we can't.
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:40.760]   - Now as a codependent, I'm worried, okay, guys.
[00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:44.160]   We can, but one of the things that I'm fascinated by
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.800]   is the first thing you learn when you go
[00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:48.040]   into 12-step programs or addiction recovery
[00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:50.800]   or any of this is genetics loads the gun,
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:52.360]   environment pulls the trigger.
[00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:55.040]   And there's certain parts of your genetics
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:56.080]   you cannot control.
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:58.720]   I come from a lot of alcoholism,
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:03.720]   I come from a lot of mental illness,
[00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:06.240]   there's certain things I cannot control
[00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:08.560]   and a lot of things that maybe we don't even know yet
[00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:09.400]   what we can and can't
[00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:11.280]   'cause of how little we actually know about the brain.
[00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:13.320]   But we also talk about the warrior spirit.
[00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:16.680]   And there are some people that have that warrior spirit
[00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:19.880]   and we don't necessarily know what that engine is,
[00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:22.560]   whether it's you get dopamine from succeeding
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:25.760]   or achieving or martyring yourself
[00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:29.480]   or that tension you get from growing.
[00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:30.320]   So a lot of people are like,
[00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:33.640]   "Oh, well, this person can edify themselves and overcome."
[00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:36.880]   But if you're getting attention from improving yourself,
[00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:39.080]   you're gonna keep wanting to do that.
[00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:41.800]   So that is something that helps a lot of
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:43.120]   in terms of changing your brain.
[00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:44.960]   If you talk about changing your brain to people
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:46.160]   and talk about what you're doing
[00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:47.440]   to overcome set obstacles,
[00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:49.120]   you're gonna get more attention from them,
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:51.360]   which is gonna fire off your reward system
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:52.560]   and then you're gonna keep doing it.
[00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:54.840]   - So you can leverage that momentum.
[00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:57.240]   - So this is why in any 12-step program,
[00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:59.720]   you go into a room and you talk about your progress
[00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:01.680]   'cause then everyone claps for you.
[00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:03.360]   And then you're more motivated to keep going.
[00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:04.720]   So that's why we say you're only as sick
[00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:05.760]   as the secrets you keep,
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:08.240]   because if you keep things secret,
[00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:10.680]   there's no one guiding you to go in a certain direction.
[00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:11.640]   It's based on, right?
[00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:14.960]   We're sort of designed to get approval from the tribe
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:17.400]   or from a group of people 'cause our brain
[00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:19.160]   translates it to safety.
[00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:20.000]   So-
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.240]   - And in that case, the tribe is a positive one
[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:24.080]   that helps you go to the positive direction.
[00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:25.800]   - So that's why it's so important to go into a room
[00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:29.640]   and also say, "Hey, I wanted to use drugs today."
[00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:30.960]   And people go, "Hmm."
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:31.960]   They go, "Me too."
[00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:34.920]   And you feel less alone and you feel less like you're,
[00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:37.280]   have been castigated from the pack or whatever.
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:38.720]   And then you say, "And I haven't,"
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:40.920]   you get a chip when you haven't drank for 30 days
[00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:42.120]   or 60 days or whatever.
[00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:43.280]   You get little rewards.

[00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:48.480]   (upbeat music)
