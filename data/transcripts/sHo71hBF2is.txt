[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.160]   Well, why will God allow us to suffer as Christians if that suffering will harm our faith?
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.000]   It's a question that comes in from an international listener.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.920]   Pastor John, hello, my name is Bernice, I'm 21 years old and live in Kenya, East Africa.
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.980]   My question stems from doubt in God's good nature that crept in while talking to my friend
[00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.460]   about trusting God with her life and choosing to follow Jesus above all else.
[00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.460]   She won't.
[00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.300]   And she won't because she says following God will simply mean additional suffering and
[00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:46.120]   going through more trials that he causes or allows to happen before we can enjoy his goodness.
[00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.040]   I wonder if she's right.
[00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.960]   Her point of view has made me question God's goodness.
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.200]   Why would he cause pain to someone who trusted in him completely?
[00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:01.840]   Why would he allow them to suffer in ways that may injure their faith in him?
[00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.120]   Why believe if it just opens us up to more suffering?
[00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:13.520]   Bernice's friend understands something almost correctly.
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:21.680]   Sometimes "almost" is really good, and sometimes "almost" is a total loss.
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:28.520]   If you're playing baseball and you hit a long drive over the outfielder's head and
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:35.680]   you almost get a triple but have to settle for a double, everybody's happy.
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:42.000]   In baseball, a double is great, so almost a triple is great.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.040]   But if you're at bat and you've got two strikes and you swing at the next pitch and you almost
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:55.160]   hit the ball, you're out, totally, whether you missed it by a sixteenth of an inch or
[00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.440]   by ten inches.
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:06.640]   What Bernice's friend sees is that when Jesus calls us to himself, he says, "If anyone would
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:14.160]   come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me," Mark 8:34.
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:21.200]   In other words, following Jesus involves taking up a cross, which is an instrument of suffering
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.280]   and death.
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:30.400]   So she knows that it will be costly to follow Jesus, and this is keeping her away, and that's
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.840]   tragic.
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:39.760]   And I would like to see if I can change her mind and in the process keep Bernice from
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.640]   going down that dead-end street.
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.320]   Two things need to be addressed here.
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.320]   Here's the first one.
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:57.240]   She says, "Following God will simply mean additional suffering and going through more
[00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:04.720]   trials than he causes or allows to happen before we can enjoy his goodness.
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:11.240]   Why believe if it just opens us up to more suffering?"
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.320]   Now there are two mistakes in that sentence.
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:19.680]   One is quantitative and the other is chronological.
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.920]   Here's the quantitative problem.
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:27.320]   She says, "Following God will simply mean additional suffering.
[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:33.560]   Why believe if it just opens us to more suffering?"
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:44.120]   But twice she says that following Christ is going to result in additional or more suffering.
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:50.000]   Now that is quantitatively absolutely not true.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:57.440]   The only reason it sounds true is that it treats the vapor's breath, which we call this
[00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:06.960]   life, as though it were the totality of life, when in fact our life between birth and death
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:14.440]   is an infinitesimal fraction of life, which in fact lasts forever.
[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:21.800]   When you come into existence at the conception in your mother's womb, you begin a life that
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.200]   never ends.
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.720]   It goes on forever.
[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:34.320]   First in this tiny, tiny fraction of life in this world and then forever, either with
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:41.140]   joy in the kingdom of God or with misery in hell.
[00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:51.200]   In Matthew 25, 46, Jesus said that the unrighteous will go away into eternal punishment, but
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:56.640]   the righteous into eternal life.
[00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:05.240]   Since human existence is eternal, either in the joyful presence of God or the absence
[00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.920]   of God under his wrath.
[00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:15.200]   Jesus said in John 3, 36, "Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life.
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:23.880]   Whoever does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him."
[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:28.360]   So back to the sentence that is quantitatively wrong.
[00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:36.840]   It is simply wrong to say that believing in Jesus brings more suffering.
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.400]   It doesn't.
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:45.840]   It brings infinitely less suffering because it rescues from eternal suffering.
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.280]   Let me say that again.
[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:56.240]   Believing in Jesus brings infinitely less suffering because it rescues from eternal
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.920]   suffering.
[00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:04.920]   So the sentence that says following God will simply mean additional suffering is quantitatively
[00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:06.320]   wrong.
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:08.800]   It is infinitely wrong.
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:17.800]   It is also wrong chronologically to say that becoming a Christian brings more trials before
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.680]   we can enjoy his goodness.
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.480]   That's not true.
[00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:29.640]   The very moment that we are born again, that we become Christians, that very moment, the
[00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:37.000]   blindness of Satan is taken away and we see the beauty of Christ.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:44.120]   The burden of guilt in that very moment is lifted from our conscience with every sin
[00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:45.120]   forgiven.
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:49.840]   The wrath of God in that moment is taken away from us, removed.
[00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:55.840]   The Holy Spirit is poured into our lives, shedding abroad in our heart the love of God.
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:00.960]   The friendship of the King of the universe is ours.
[00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:04.040]   Intimate fellowship with Christ begins.
[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:07.600]   Bold communication in prayer is open.
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:12.560]   Joy that is inexpressible and full of glory is tasted.
[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:15.720]   All bondages of sin are broken.
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:18.920]   Invincible hope is awakened.
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:25.240]   The omnipotence of God shifts from being against us to working everything together for our
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.680]   eternal good.
[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:34.020]   All of this and more begins the instant we are born again.
[00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:44.260]   It is simply not true to say that becoming a Christian brings more trials before we can
[00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:47.140]   enjoy God's goodness.
[00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:54.420]   It's precisely all this instantaneous goodness that we experience that enables us to bear
[00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:55.420]   the trials.
[00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:59.300]   I said there are two things that needed to be addressed.
[00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:04.400]   That was the first one, the quantitative and chronological mistake of saying that becoming
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:10.120]   a Christian means more suffering and that the goodness of God must wait until after
[00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:12.660]   the hardships before it comes.
[00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:17.420]   The second thing that needs to be addressed is the question that Bernice raises.
[00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:24.340]   Why would God cause pain to someone who trusted him completely?
[00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:30.420]   Why would he allow them to suffer in ways that may injure their faith in him?
[00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:41.180]   Now there are at least six biblical, broad, trustworthy, satisfying answers to that question.
[00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:45.860]   I wrote an article at Desiring God called "Five Purposes for Suffering," and just a
[00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:49.380]   few weeks ago I decided I got to add a sixth.
[00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:56.220]   So now I'm thinking in terms of the six broad reasons for Christian suffering.
[00:08:56.220 --> 00:09:00.620]   So you can go to Desiring God and look that up.
[00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:03.540]   And I'm not going to rehearse those now.
[00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:13.880]   What I want to do instead is suggest for Bernice a reorientation of the way she sees the suffering
[00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:15.860]   of believers.
[00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:22.580]   What if instead of seeing Christian suffering as something added to our lives because we
[00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:30.980]   become Christians, we see our suffering as something that up till now was certain and
[00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:41.060]   deserved, but now by the grace of God has become suffering that is made to serve our
[00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:43.020]   salvation?
[00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:48.820]   That is a radical reorientation of the way you see your suffering.
[00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:54.180]   In other words, instead of seeing suffering as something that God randomly adds to your
[00:09:54.180 --> 00:10:01.660]   life, you see suffering as something that you deserved and that was coming for sure
[00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:10.180]   and that would eventually destroy you, but now God as the all-wise, all-powerful, all-compassionate
[00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:17.740]   physician miraculously causes all that suffering to serve us and not destroy us.
[00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:25.380]   For example, 2 Corinthians 12, Paul says he's got this thorn in the flesh that God has given
[00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:26.740]   him.
[00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:32.220]   Without Jesus Christ, that thorn would be entirely destructive.
[00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:41.020]   But because of Christ, even though that thorn is a messenger of Satan, verse 7, God makes
[00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:46.820]   it into an instrument of Paul's sanctification and joy.
[00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:54.220]   When Paul asks that the thorn be taken away, Christ answers, "My grace is sufficient
[00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:55.660]   for you.
[00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:58.980]   My power is made perfect in weakness."
[00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:07.380]   And so Paul responds like this, "Therefore, I will boast all the more gladly"—mark
[00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:15.580]   that word—"I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses so that the power of Christ
[00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:17.740]   may rest upon me."
[00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:24.780]   In other words, the very suffering that is designed by Satan for our misery and would
[00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:33.740]   result in eternal misery without Christ, that very suffering is turned by God into a means
[00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:35.900]   of our salvation.
[00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:43.380]   So Bernice, I plead with you and your friend, first, when you consider the sufferings of
[00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:50.980]   life, remember that life lasts forever, not just 80 years.
[00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:59.780]   And God gave his Son to restrict your suffering to a tiny fraction of that life and then give
[00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:02.060]   you everlasting joy.
[00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:11.900]   And second, reorient the way you see your sufferings so that you see God turning deserved
[00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:21.900]   and inevitable sufferings into the kind of divine therapy that leads to everlasting health
[00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:22.900]   and joy.
[00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:25.780]   Yeah, radical reorientation is right.
[00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:27.840]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you, Bernice.
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:32.740]   You can ask a question of your own, search through our growing archive, or subscribe
[00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:33.740]   to the podcast.
[00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:39.620]   You can do all that at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:43.380]   But how much media is too much media?
[00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:47.300]   In the digital age, this is a question we all face all the time, and it's the dilemma
[00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:50.500]   faced by a young woman who listens to the podcast and writes in.
[00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:56.120]   The friends and family around her have a very high tolerance for media, lots of TV, lots
[00:12:56.120 --> 00:13:01.140]   of gaming, but she doesn't have a high tolerance for lots of TV and video games, and it's raising
[00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:02.460]   relationship tensions.
[00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:05.180]   We're going to talk about those tensions next time.
[00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:08.500]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke, and we'll see you back here on Monday.
[00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:09.500]   [end]
[00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:09.500]   1
[00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:16.500]   Desiring God is a great way to get your message across. It's a way of getting people to listen,
[00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:18.560]   you
