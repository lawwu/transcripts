[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.520]   It's how do you intentionally engineer a life that's deep
[00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.160]   when you have all of these shallow,
[00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.920]   often digital distractions that are trying
[00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.920]   to pull you away from meaning.
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.920]   So your new book, "Build the Life You Want"
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.600]   is exactly the type of thing we're talking about.
[00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.080]   I'm excited to get to this blueprint type approach
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.040]   of how do you get intentional about designing your life.
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.280]   My listeners love this, but if you'll indulge me,
[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.640]   what I wanted to do first was actually go back
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.320]   and spend some time on your life story,
[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.680]   which I have broken into four acts,
[00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.480]   each of which is really different than the last.
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.340]   I think it's a case study of really applying,
[00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.820]   not just intention to your life, but revision.
[00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.140]   Okay, where are things now?
[00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.340]   Let me adjust my vision.
[00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.960]   Let me make perhaps a major change.
[00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.240]   So I thought we would start with the real life case study
[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.360]   of designing your life with your life itself.
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.080]   So to start at the beginning,
[00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.600]   I have your act one as serious musician.
[00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.520]   Would you, do I have that right?
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.520]   You would say this is your first act as an adult,
[00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:05.680]   in adult life was music.
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.920]   - Yeah, that was my first act as a child too.
[00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.320]   And by the way, this systemic approach
[00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.520]   to actually building your life,
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.300]   you're the best guy in the world to talk about this
[00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.440]   because you have this systematic,
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.260]   well, you do two things incredibly well.
[00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.000]   You understand the difference between complex
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.400]   and complicated problems mathematically.
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.080]   Complex problems don't have solutions,
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.100]   but they're easy to understand.
[00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.680]   Complicated problems are hard to understand,
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.120]   but you can solve them with enough horsepower.
[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.700]   And you understand that you can't use complicated solutions
[00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.520]   to solve complex problems.
[00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.280]   And all of this goes into the way
[00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.200]   that you're gonna build your life.
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.280]   And I know we're gonna talk about this.
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.960]   You're the, like, you're the guy
[00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.900]   that actually understands for people how to do this.
[00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.320]   So I'm delighted to be able to be a case study for you,
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.160]   for this.
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.780]   And for your first question,
[00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.560]   music was the only part of my life
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.400]   that I didn't choose, actually.
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.520]   It was chosen for me, perhaps divinely, I don't know.
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.280]   My parents, when I was four, I started violin.
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.880]   When I was five, I started the piano.
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.000]   When I was eight, I started the French horn.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.960]   Eight?
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:03.780]   I mean, yeah.
[00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.840]   And I was really good at that, and that really stuck.
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.440]   And it was fun, and I liked it, and I loved music, et cetera.
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.560]   And so that's what I was,
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.600]   by the time I was 10 or 11 years old,
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:13.720]   my ambition was to be
[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.280]   the world's greatest French horn player.
[00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.160]   That was what I wanted to do.
[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.680]   I wanted to grow up and do that.
[00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.440]   All of my heroes were great French horn players.
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.260]   The greatest horn player who's ever lived
[00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.020]   is a British guy from the 1930s and '40s
[00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.780]   named Dennis Brayne.
[00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.120]   And Dennis Brayne, I had a picture of him
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.820]   up on my bedroom wall.
[00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.860]   I didn't have Michael Jordan, or Wilt Chamberlain.
[00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.580]   I had Dennis Brayne up on the wall.
[00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:38.860]   And that's what I did.
[00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.860]   And so it was my unsuccessful run at college when I was 18.
[00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.860]   Really what it was was my heart wasn't in it
[00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:47.900]   because I wanted to go pro.
[00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.880]   So I left.
[00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.300]   There was a mutual decision of the college and me
[00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.900]   to pursue my excellence elsewhere, put it that way.
[00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.220]   And I left right after my 19th birthday,
[00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.740]   and that's when I went pro in musician.
[00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.660]   I did that 'til I was 31.
[00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.060]   - Well, and I've heard that before
[00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.020]   from a professional musician friend of mine,
[00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.820]   is that these colleges that are focused on the arts,
[00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.780]   if you make it to graduation, basically means you failed.
[00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.660]   So you go to one of these colleges.
[00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.380]   He went to Berklee School of Music in Boston.
[00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.940]   The whole pressure of that system is go pro.
[00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.360]   I should mention, by the way, Arthur,
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.240]   when I was eight years old,
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.900]   I started playing the French horn.
[00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:24.740]   - Did you really?
[00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:25.580]   - So we've got that connection.
[00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:26.400]   - I'll be darned.
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.240]   So third or fourth grade,
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.060]   you started playing the French horn as well.
[00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.900]   - It was very hard.
[00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:29.780]   - And you made good.
[00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.180]   Look, you escaped the vortex, Cal.
[00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.060]   - It's an impossible, it's a preposterous instrument,
[00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.900]   I would say.
[00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.660]   It's so hard to play.
[00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.940]   - The physics are no good, which you don't know.
[00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.940]   The problem is that it's almost as long as a tuba,
[00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.740]   which should make it a bass instrument.
[00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:47.500]   But the mouthpiece that you blow into
[00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.260]   is the size of a trumpet mouthpiece.
[00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.820]   And what that does effectively is it sets the harmonics
[00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:52.700]   on top of each other.
[00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.580]   They're so close that it's easy to miss notes.
[00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:56.760]   The reason that French horn players
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.940]   notoriously are inaccurate
[00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.200]   is because the mouthpiece is too small
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.540]   for the length of the instrument.
[00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.980]   And so hitting the harmonic in the series right
[00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.900]   is perilous, like a tight wire rock,
[00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.940]   like being a flying Wallenda, but for the brass section.
[00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:12.860]   - Yeah, the trumpet players just sort of blow
[00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:13.900]   into that thing.
[00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.360]   And it's like, their notes are clear.
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.300]   And the French horns, you have to,
[00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:17.660]   A, you have to blow into that thing
[00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.460]   like a hurricane force and be precise.
[00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:22.140]   Well, anyways, I did not have the poster
[00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:23.820]   of the professional French horn player.
[00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.480]   But so we see you then, you're in your twenties,
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.700]   you're playing, you had dropped out of school to be pro,
[00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.640]   you're playing professional French horn.
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.460]   By your thirties, you are a full professor.
[00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:37.700]   I mean, you're an academic.
[00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.380]   You're a standard academic at Syracuse.
[00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.660]   So walk us through that transition.
[00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.080]   How do we get from, I'm playing in, was it Barcelona,
[00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.720]   to I'm on an academic track, not a typical path.
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.000]   So what went down there?
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.160]   - Yeah, it's not a typical path.
[00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:58.160]   But when I was a kid, I had this theory, believe it or not.
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.880]   I mean, it was a kind of a precocious theory
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.640]   to have, I realized, but nonetheless,
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:06.700]   I had this idea that you could build your life,
[00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:08.240]   you've got to make your own decisions,
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.000]   that it was almost incumbent upon you to make a decision
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.320]   about different areas of your life.
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.480]   And so I always figured at some point,
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.080]   it was my responsibility to choose my religion,
[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.360]   not every year, like some sort of sentimentalist,
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.800]   but to choose my faith and practice it seriously,
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.600]   to choose my own political views,
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.280]   to make a choice on the basis
[00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.360]   of the information that's out there.
[00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.360]   So not take things, important things in your life as given.
[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.520]   And that meant my vocation as well.
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.880]   The problem is I hadn't chosen my vocation.
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.760]   I hadn't chosen my vocational path.
[00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.480]   And by the time I was in my mid-twenties,
[00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:44.320]   my life was great.
[00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.320]   I have to say, I mean, I moved to Barcelona
[00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.440]   and joined the symphony, not because of the symphony,
[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.840]   but because I was in love with a Spanish girl.
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:54.000]   And I chased her to Barcelona in a bid to learn the language
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.320]   so I could ask her to marry me,
[00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.760]   which took two years to close that deal.
[00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:01.040]   But we just celebrated our 32nd wedding anniversary
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.600]   and we have kids and grandkids at this point.
[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:07.120]   So it turned out that venture was really successful.
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.840]   But in that time, I realized that I was good at it,
[00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:11.880]   but I didn't love it.
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:13.640]   I didn't love it.
[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.000]   I mean, I wasn't the world's greatest French horn player,
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.840]   but I was making a living, which isn't nothing.
[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:20.040]   And so my wife, my new wife said,
[00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:22.200]   "Why don't you figure out what you love?
[00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:23.440]   "I mean, don't you have this theory
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.680]   "that you get to choose everything once?"
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:27.240]   And I said, "Huh."
[00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.920]   So I actually went back to school.
[00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:31.720]   She was studying for her high school diploma
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.120]   in her late twenties.
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.720]   She had dropped out of high school when she was 16
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:40.320]   to sing with a very famous rock band in Barcelona.
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.880]   And so she was doing that, taking a few math classes.
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:43.920]   She said, "You gotta try math."
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:44.760]   I said, "Math?"
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:46.000]   You know, my dad was a math professor,
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.640]   but you know, no, it's not for me.
[00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:50.200]   I took calculus and it was like doing crossword puzzles,
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:54.160]   man, it was easy and fun and just great.
[00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.320]   'Cause I was 27 or something at that point.
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:00.080]   And so I wound up enrolling in correspondence school,
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:02.080]   distance learning in Barcelona.
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:05.120]   Took a job in South Florida teaching French horn
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:06.160]   because it gave me enough time
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:09.340]   to finish my bachelor's degree by correspondence,
[00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:10.920]   which wound up being in economics
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.360]   'cause it was so interesting, social science.
[00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:14.520]   This is something I chose.
[00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:16.440]   And I went, I got my master's degree in economics.
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:17.800]   And by that time I was 31
[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.000]   and I was actually ready to try something new.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.600]   So I quit and started my PhD.
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:26.020]   So I did my PhD in three years in public policy analysis.
[00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:28.880]   My fields were applied microeconomics and math modeling.
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:32.540]   I was doing operations, military operations research
[00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:34.680]   for the US Air Force while I was in graduate school
[00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:35.840]   to make a living.
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:38.440]   And then I came out and took an academic job.
[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:40.600]   You know, used my PhD to get an academic job
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:41.680]   as a social scientist.
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.360]   First at Georgia State for a little while
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.360]   and then at Syracuse.
[00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:48.000]   And all told, that first pass through academia
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.440]   was 10 years where I took promotions and tenure
[00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.560]   and endowed chairs and all the stuff
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:53.720]   that you do in academia.
[00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:56.440]   - But when you were making that intentional vocational
[00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:59.000]   choice there in Spain,
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.100]   was the vision all the way through to academia
[00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:04.080]   or was it, I don't wanna do French horn anymore,
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:05.560]   let me go back to school
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:07.400]   and then we will see what that opens up?
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:09.480]   How far in the future were you thinking?
[00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:12.000]   - I was, I had notions of it and the truth is
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.680]   that academia is the family business for me.
[00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:17.480]   My father was a professor, was a math professor.
[00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:20.660]   His father was a theology professor
[00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:22.360]   and an administrator at a college,
[00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.800]   at these, you know, religious colleges actually.
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:26.920]   But it is a family profession.
[00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:28.280]   So I always kind of thought, you know,
[00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:30.600]   it's a pretty good life, et cetera, but I don't know.
[00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:32.520]   You know, maybe I'll try to run a company,
[00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:36.640]   maybe I'll, you know, go to one of these crazy think tanks,
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:37.480]   et cetera.
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:41.520]   What I really wanted to was to learn social science,
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.000]   which is incredibly interesting.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.320]   I mean, human behavior is the most interesting thing ever
[00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:48.120]   because you can use mathematical and statistical tools,
[00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:50.760]   complicated tools to at least apprehend
[00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:54.240]   some of these complex problems of human behavior.
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:56.440]   Not perfectly, this is not computer science
[00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:57.840]   we're talking about here,
[00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:00.320]   but it is amazing how much power you have.
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:01.960]   And so I just couldn't get enough of that.
[00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:05.080]   I was much happier as a social scientist
[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:07.040]   than I ever had been as a classical musician
[00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:08.640]   because it was the thing that I chose.
[00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:09.880]   I was passionate about it.
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:11.640]   And then when I got out of graduate school,
[00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:13.320]   I realized I could continue to learn
[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:15.040]   and I needed to learn a lot more
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:17.040]   only if I went into academia.
[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:19.200]   So my assistant professor life, you know,
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.800]   before I got any, you know, I was on the tenure track,
[00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:23.560]   but before I got any of that tenure,
[00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:25.800]   it really was an extension of my PhD.
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:28.120]   I learned probably more as an assistant professor
[00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:29.320]   than I did in graduate school.
[00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:30.440]   You too, probably, right?
[00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:32.480]   - Oh yeah, well, especially like teaching a course,
[00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:34.920]   you know, then you learn, oh, I understand this.
[00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:36.480]   I understand this topic now.
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:38.120]   - But also writing code.
[00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:41.360]   You know, I was running very sophisticated packages,
[00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:44.240]   you know, software packages for my statistical programming
[00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:46.000]   and I had to learn how to write code,
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.840]   which taught me the statistics.
[00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:49.320]   And then I was writing a lot of theory.
[00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:51.240]   I was doing, you know, early AI stuff.
[00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:53.360]   I was doing a lot of stuff with genetic algorithms
[00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:55.040]   and using genetic algorithms
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:57.960]   as learning models across economies.
[00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:59.400]   And I had to learn how that worked.
[00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:01.960]   And you know, I didn't get any of that in my PhD.
[00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:03.320]   - Hey, quick interruption.
[00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:07.440]   If you want my free guide with my seven best ideas
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:10.520]   on how to cultivate the deep life,
[00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:13.880]   go to calnewport.com/ideas
[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:16.720]   or click the link right below in the description.
[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:19.160]   This is a great way to take action
[00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:22.120]   on the type of things we talk about here on this show.
[00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:23.360]   All right, let's get back to it.
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:25.840]   - I'll talk about a topic that has fallen out of favor.
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:27.960]   I remember genetic algorithms.
[00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:29.800]   You would actually evolve the algorithms
[00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:31.120]   with natural selection.
[00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:32.600]   But I think you're selling,
[00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:34.320]   so just to set the stage for the ions,
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:39.200]   you're being modest here because I think a misnomer
[00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:41.800]   a lot of people in the general public have about academia
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:43.960]   is this idea of like, well, if you get a PhD,
[00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:46.120]   like one of the things you can just choose to do is teach.
[00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:49.400]   It's just like this teaches how it's described.
[00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:50.720]   It's like, yeah, you could go be a professor
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:51.920]   if you decide to or not.
[00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:53.200]   The reality of course is that,
[00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:55.720]   especially when you get to an R1 institution
[00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:57.000]   or an institution like Syracuse,
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.440]   it's incredibly competitive.
[00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:01.280]   It's very hard to get hired at Syracuse
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:04.280]   and then advance through the promotion chain.
[00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:08.600]   So it must be what you were doing at Georgia State
[00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:09.920]   had a spark to it, right?
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:11.560]   So it must have been you were seen early on
[00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:12.840]   or maybe you were doing this on purpose.
[00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:15.360]   You were finding a niche that was gathering
[00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:18.000]   some heat or some attention
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.720]   because that's actually a really impressive jump.
[00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:22.560]   I mean, typically, again, a professor at Syracuse
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:24.920]   would have been good school, straight out of college,
[00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:26.720]   in the grad school, like their whole life
[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:28.920]   focused on getting hired in one of those slots.
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:30.880]   You came into it sideways.
[00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:32.360]   So I'm assuming what you were doing
[00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:33.720]   was seen as was innovative
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:36.360]   or you found a vein there that was really rich.
[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:39.560]   - Yeah, it's basically what it was.
[00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:40.920]   I had my eye on Syracuse
[00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:44.120]   'cause Syracuse was the number one school in policy
[00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:45.200]   in the country at the time.
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:46.800]   And there were great professors there,
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:47.880]   people I really venerated.
[00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:49.920]   It was a community I wanted to be part of.
[00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:51.440]   And so when I came out of graduate school
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:53.760]   and went into academia at Georgia State,
[00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:56.600]   also a very fine university, and I enjoyed it a lot,
[00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:58.440]   the first thing that I did
[00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:00.280]   was I figured out how the system works.
[00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:02.640]   The biggest mistake that professors make
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:03.840]   when they come out of graduate school
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:05.560]   is that they'll say something like,
[00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:08.560]   you know, I'm gonna get my courses under control,
[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:10.800]   then I'm gonna start paying attention to my research.
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:13.680]   I can tell that that person's
[00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:15.920]   probably not gonna get tenure.
[00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:19.120]   The truth is that in an R1 research university,
[00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:20.680]   research is everything.
[00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:22.680]   It really matters what you're doing in research.
[00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:27.360]   So I got a notion of how the traffic patterns work,
[00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:29.080]   and that meant basically
[00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:30.760]   that there was a certain number of articles
[00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:32.640]   in certain set of journals.
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:34.680]   I looked at those journals
[00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:37.000]   and the articles that I admired the most
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.760]   and I found most interesting.
[00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:42.360]   I actually made a template of those articles.
[00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:44.880]   I didn't make a macro to write the articles.
[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:46.360]   That's completely impossible, obviously.
[00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:47.440]   It's still a creative task.
[00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:50.760]   But I made a structure that I needed to follow,
[00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:53.640]   and I started to follow that particular structure,
[00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:55.840]   and I did that about, you know,
[00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:59.360]   six times in each of my first three years in academia,
[00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:01.000]   which gave me a real leg up
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.160]   and it made it possible to show
[00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:04.160]   that I had a big research record.
[00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:08.160]   I was doing economic statistical research in public policy,
[00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:09.800]   which was a little bit unusual.
[00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:12.440]   - You were doing six papers a year,
[00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:14.480]   you were hitting in your journal papers
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:15.880]   in your assistant professorship years?
[00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:16.800]   - Yeah, that's right.
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:19.200]   Mostly sole author, which actually was a weakness.
[00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:20.760]   I needed to co-author a little bit more.
[00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:23.600]   I could have been doing higher quality research
[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:26.520]   if I'd been co-authoring with more senior people,
[00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:27.880]   but I was trying to keep up a speed.
[00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:29.680]   I mean, I was working pretty hard, I have to say,
[00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:31.360]   and by that time I had little kids
[00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:33.200]   and there was a cost to it.
[00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:35.960]   I mean, I was working 60, 80 hour weeks.
[00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:36.800]   - That's superstar.
[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:40.480]   Before our audience, six journal papers a year in that field,
[00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:42.120]   that's superstar level performance.
[00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:46.280]   I think what would be more typical is two, maybe three.
[00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:48.100]   So, I mean, you really, you work backwards.
[00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:49.440]   By the way, what you're saying reminds,
[00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:50.960]   this is exactly the same story
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:53.600]   that I think our mutual acquaintance, Adam Grant,
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:56.000]   has told me about when he started at Penn,
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.680]   was figuring out the same thing.
[00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:00.480]   What do you need to write a paper?
[00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:03.500]   How many papers are my typical colleagues writing?
[00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:05.120]   All right, let me do twice that.
[00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:06.720]   And then he ends up the youngest tenured,
[00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:07.960]   youngest full professor in Penn history.
[00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:09.640]   So I'm sensing something very similar.
[00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:11.960]   You deconstructed the system and said,
[00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:14.040]   then let me level up.
[00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:16.280]   Like, let me level up to be doing
[00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:18.020]   probably much more than your colleagues were
[00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:19.640]   at the institution at the time.
[00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:21.740]   - Yeah, well, I was doing more.
[00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:23.440]   And part of the reason is because
[00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:25.780]   I had a little bit of a pathological need
[00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:27.940]   to catch up with my cohort.
[00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:31.300]   So Adam Grant, who's a genius, he's unbelievable,
[00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:33.900]   he was the youngest guy ever tenured at Penn.
[00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:36.140]   I was not the youngest guy tenured any place
[00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:37.820]   because I'd already had a 12 year career
[00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:39.300]   as a French horn player
[00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:41.260]   before I even went to graduate school.
[00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:43.620]   So by the time I graduated with my PhD,
[00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:44.860]   I was 34 years old.
[00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:46.640]   And to catch up, I kind of figured that
[00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:48.480]   I needed to get promotion and tenure
[00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:50.360]   by seven to eight years in.
[00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:53.600]   And to do that, I kind of backed out
[00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:54.840]   the amount of productivity I thought
[00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:57.080]   I was gonna need to have to get there in the meantime.
[00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:59.320]   And that actually worked.
[00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:01.600]   When you understand systems,
[00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:03.160]   you're a lot more successful.
[00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:04.900]   I mean, when you understand traffic,
[00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:07.480]   you're less likely to have an accident or get a ticket.
[00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:10.600]   And when you understand the rules of the academic road,
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:12.480]   you know what the expectations are
[00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:14.740]   and you can design your work patterns
[00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:15.580]   to that.
[00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:18.960]   Now, what impedes that is if you don't like doing the work.
[00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:21.000]   You know, the biggest problem that I see academics have
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.280]   is they come out of their PhD
[00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:24.160]   and they don't like writing articles.
[00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:25.200]   They just don't enjoy it.
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:27.480]   And so they put it off and they can't get to it
[00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:29.040]   and they think it's boring
[00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:30.240]   and they go do something else
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:32.600]   or they write kind of popular stuff or whatever.
[00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:34.320]   And then by the time their third year review
[00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:35.840]   or their tenure time comes around,
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:37.400]   they don't have enough of a record.
[00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:38.660]   But for me, it was a thrill.
[00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:40.840]   I was learning stuff like crazy.
[00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:43.680]   And so it was not an onerous task for me
[00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:47.520]   to publish, you know, five, six, seven articles a year.
[00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:50.400]   And my goal was to hit 60 by my 10th year.
[00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:52.360]   That was the whole idea.
[00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:54.720]   - Well, I mean, and I'll say it's just an add on to that
[00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:56.480]   because I went through something similar.
[00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:59.880]   Soon after I started my assistant professorship,
[00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:01.400]   I did something similar.
[00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:02.380]   So I did a study.
[00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:05.840]   I said, I wanna go back and study past the tenure
[00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:07.320]   coming in my field of computer science.
[00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:10.760]   So what I went back and did was found natural experiments
[00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:13.580]   where you had two students leaving the same advisor.
[00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:15.160]   So they have the same training
[00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:16.960]   and then looking at their time to tenure
[00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:18.900]   or even if they made tenure at all, right?
[00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:22.040]   So I had two cohorts, fast to tenure,
[00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:23.760]   not faster, not tenured,
[00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:25.640]   coming out of the same training environment.
[00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:29.340]   And I wrote an essay about this early on in my blog days.
[00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:31.560]   And so I said, what's different?
[00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:35.360]   Let me quantify everything I can and say what's different.
[00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:37.520]   And I figured out, oh, the people who get tenure faster,
[00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:40.200]   it wasn't publication quantity.
[00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:41.340]   It wasn't so much topic.
[00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:42.920]   It was the number of citations
[00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:44.920]   of their five most cited papers.
[00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:46.880]   And I realized, oh, this is what's important
[00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:49.560]   is you have to write these, in my field,
[00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:53.000]   you have to write these papers that get cited a lot.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.560]   And what makes papers get cited a lot?
[00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:56.740]   Typically, you're making progress
[00:16:56.740 --> 00:16:58.440]   on a hard problem that people are working on
[00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:00.200]   because you've made progress on it
[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:02.440]   and then people are gonna build on you.
[00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:04.840]   And so it was both good news and bad news.
[00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:06.680]   Good news because there's clarity.
[00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:09.120]   Bad news because it's really, really hard.
[00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:10.940]   And so I further deconstructed,
[00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:13.880]   how do the real stars make the huge progress?
[00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:15.120]   And you could deconstruct it.
[00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:18.040]   And it was, they spent a lot of time in mathematics.
[00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:19.440]   Your dad would probably tell you something similar.
[00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:23.160]   A lot of it is deconstructing what other people have done,
[00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:25.920]   really understanding in your bones how the proofs work.
[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:26.760]   And this is very hard
[00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:28.480]   because people skip details in their papers.
[00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:31.560]   And if you do, then you can make progress.
[00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:33.280]   And that is just really, really, really hard.
[00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:36.160]   And so at some point, I had to make a decision.
[00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:37.200]   I can do pretty well here.
[00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:39.360]   I get tenure early and do this and that.
[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:40.840]   To be a superstar,
[00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:42.840]   I know exactly what that would take.
[00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:44.380]   And I don't think I had the stomach for it.
[00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:45.220]   I was like, that's just,
[00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:47.700]   it's so mentally demanding the deconstruction
[00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:48.540]   of these proofs.
[00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:51.080]   You have to just do it hour after hour, day after day.
[00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:52.640]   So it's interesting when you deconstruct.
[00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:55.880]   It not only gives you the path towards where you wanna go,
[00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:57.360]   sometimes it changes your path
[00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:58.760]   because you realize,
[00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:01.340]   I don't exactly wanna do what's required.
[00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:06.340]   - Yeah, or if you allow me to analyze you a little bit, Cal,
[00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:09.080]   because I know some things about your career as well.
[00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:13.200]   And what it really takes for that highest echelon
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:16.640]   is not just more intellectual horsepower
[00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:19.640]   or the willingness and ability to do that one thing
[00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:21.600]   for 80 hours a week for a little while.
[00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:25.840]   You gotta pay your dues for a long time.
[00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:28.440]   Anytime a band comes from no place,
[00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:31.600]   it's like an overnight hit, everybody's talking about it.
[00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:34.240]   They've been out at a holiday inn by the airport
[00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:37.660]   playing, doing as a cover band for 15 years.
[00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:38.800]   That's what's been going on.
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:40.720]   And you gotta do that work and do that work
[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:41.560]   and do that work.
[00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:44.320]   And if you're interested in a lot of different things,
[00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:47.320]   beavering away at the margins like that
[00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:50.200]   is not something that's necessarily going to appeal to you.
[00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:53.260]   And you're, I mean, you're natural public intellectual, Cal.
[00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:55.940]   You wanna be in the public talking about these things
[00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:59.240]   that can raise consciousness among non-scientists
[00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:01.760]   as opposed to simply raising consciousness
[00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:04.640]   among in the ether of the scientists,
[00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:08.480]   in the rarefied atmosphere of the scientists themselves.
[00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:12.280]   And that's gonna make it hard, maybe impossible
[00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:16.320]   for you to play Beatles tunes at the holiday inn
[00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:17.720]   for 15 or 20 years,
[00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:20.680]   which is deconstructing somebody else's proofs
[00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:21.800]   to see what's actually going on.
[00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:24.240]   It's a question of longevity in the trenches,
[00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:27.080]   which is hard for natural public intellectuals, I dare say.
[00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:27.920]   Is that fair?
[00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:28.840]   - I think that is probably fair.
[00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:29.720]   Yeah, it is.
[00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:32.920]   It's a grind and it's a really long grind.
[00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:34.640]   I mean, writing's the same way.
[00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:36.560]   You've experienced this as well.
[00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:40.040]   It takes a lot of writing before you can write things
[00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:43.440]   that large audiences actually like.
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:44.520]   I got started early.
[00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:46.960]   I sold my first book when I was 20.
[00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:50.200]   I had this very long training period
[00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:52.680]   to actually get to a point where it's like,
[00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:56.200]   okay, I can sort of write something now that is good.
[00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:58.240]   So everything has trenches.
[00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:00.200]   The trenches are long, yeah.
[00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:02.800]   So then why did you, if we go to the next act,
[00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:05.480]   is now your think tank world here in DC.
[00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:10.240]   So leaving academia, that's a scary thing
[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:13.520]   for people with full professorships at R1 institutions.
[00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:15.800]   So I'm particularly interested in this.
[00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:16.640]   - Yeah.
[00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:18.640]   - What was that decision process?
[00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:20.240]   - It wasn't scary, actually.
[00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:23.400]   And part of the reason was because I hit my number.
[00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:26.520]   I hit 60 articles, peer-reviewed articles.
[00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:28.160]   And I thought to myself, what is the,
[00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:30.560]   and that was around getting toward tenure.
[00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:33.000]   So I entered academia at 34.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.600]   Around 44, I was looking around at other opportunities
[00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:38.880]   to create value as a social scientist.
[00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:42.800]   I joined up as a part-time kind of visiting scholar
[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:45.240]   at the American Enterprise Institute there in DC.
[00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:49.240]   And I was spending a day a month, something like that,
[00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:51.040]   doing different policy ideas.
[00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:54.720]   And I was starting to write sort of trade books on the side.
[00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:56.040]   And so I wrote a book called
[00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:57.720]   "Who Really Cares" about charitable giving.
[00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:59.360]   It was very, it was actually quite academic,
[00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:02.080]   had a mathematical appendix and the whole thing.
[00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:02.920]   But it got noticed.
[00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:04.360]   You know, President Bush read it
[00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:05.600]   and called me to the White House.
[00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:06.920]   And you know, I started to get,
[00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:09.260]   it's not like it was some huge, big hit.
[00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:10.980]   But it did change my perspective
[00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:12.720]   on how I could have a conversation.
[00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:15.500]   And I realized when I was looking at the next 10 years,
[00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:17.560]   I mean, 10 years is a good cadence.
[00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:21.360]   Now, it follows the career trajectory
[00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:23.680]   of the so-called spiral.
[00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:24.880]   I didn't know it at the time.
[00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:25.920]   And I've gone back and, you know,
[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:28.220]   participated in the research on it at this point.
[00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:30.640]   What you find is that most people think that they're linear,
[00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:32.840]   which is to say that they'll only change institutions
[00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:35.120]   or jobs when they're in the same field
[00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:36.560]   and have a better opportunity.
[00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:38.160]   For more money, more prestige,
[00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:41.400]   more admiration, more, more, more, whatever.
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:44.240]   But a lot of people don't have that career trajectory.
[00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:46.160]   They have the spiral career trajectory,
[00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:49.040]   which is that they want a series of mini careers
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:51.120]   that make sense in their heads.
[00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:52.440]   And sometimes you take more money
[00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:53.700]   and sometimes you take less money
[00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:55.160]   and sometimes you leave the industry.
[00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:56.000]   And when you're in academia,
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.260]   it means you gotta kick away your tenure from time to time.
[00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:01.280]   And after 10 years in academia,
[00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:02.960]   I was looking at the next 10 years and said,
[00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:05.040]   that's another 60 articles, you know?
[00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:06.760]   And that's another 60.
[00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:09.040]   That's another, more or less, doing the same thing.
[00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:10.480]   It's doing my homework and turning it in.
[00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:11.640]   And I got nothing against that.
[00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:14.080]   Some of the people I respect the most in life have done that.
[00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:16.000]   But I thought, I bet there's a thing that I could do
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.880]   to take these ideas now
[00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:20.380]   and to start making them more public in public policy.
[00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:21.720]   My background is in policy.
[00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:23.480]   My PhD is in policy.
[00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:25.600]   I'd worked at the Rand Corporation in policy,
[00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:27.880]   Syracuse University, big policy school.
[00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:29.900]   And the next thing, obviously, was a think tank
[00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:31.240]   or so it seemed to me.
[00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:33.940]   And so I decided I was gonna probably leave
[00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:36.040]   and be a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.
[00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:38.480]   And what surprised me is that they had a big crisis
[00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:41.440]   over the fact that they couldn't find a president.
[00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:42.640]   And so, you know, it's an old think tank.
[00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:43.920]   It was started in 1938.
[00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:46.800]   And it's one of the better known think tanks in the world.
[00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:48.620]   And their longtime president was leaving.
[00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:50.100]   They were out of time.
[00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:51.940]   They had offered it to a couple of people
[00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:52.920]   who'd turned it down.
[00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:55.680]   Because it's very hard to find a think tank president.
[00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:58.040]   It's not a fun job, especially in Washington, D.C.,
[00:22:58.040 --> 00:22:59.240]   for a lot of people.
[00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:00.960]   And, you know, they were out of options.
[00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:02.600]   And I think that the last words uttered
[00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:04.120]   before offering me the job,
[00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:06.500]   a guy who had never supervised any employees
[00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:07.920]   and never raised a dollar,
[00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:09.800]   and this is a think tank based entirely on philanthropy,
[00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:11.920]   I think they basically were like, ah, what the hell?
[00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:13.080]   You know, give it a shot.
[00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:16.360]   If it doesn't work out, we'll fire him and we'll be fine.
[00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:17.600]   Which was a little bit scary,
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:20.080]   but it also was incredibly exciting
[00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:22.040]   because it was the next phase,
[00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:23.840]   it was the next turn of the spiral
[00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:25.340]   is what it came out to be.
[00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:27.440]   I had been teaching non-profit management,
[00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:29.080]   among other things, at Syracuse.
[00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:33.480]   I had a big, I had a round table of non-profit executives
[00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:35.200]   that I would be, that I was running.
[00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:37.520]   I was giving them, I wrote a textbook.
[00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:39.280]   Cal had written a textbook in non-profit management.
[00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:41.340]   I'd never run a non-profit.
[00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:43.500]   And I thought to myself, you know,
[00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:45.120]   I wonder if I could do this.
[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:47.060]   I mean, I was just fascinated to know
[00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:49.800]   whether I could do public policy and be an administrator
[00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:52.360]   and kind of square these circles at the same time.
[00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:54.860]   And so when they offered me the job
[00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:57.080]   over the objections of my wife,
[00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:58.540]   who didn't want to move to Washington, D.C.,
[00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:00.160]   I said, "Yeah."
[00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:01.000]   I said, "Yeah."
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.060]   So she said, "Okay, okay, give it a shot."
[00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:06.100]   And so I ran the American Enterprise Institute
[00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:09.120]   for 10 years and six months, 10.5 years.
[00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:10.900]   That was the second phase.
[00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:12.440]   And that was very interesting, I have to say.
[00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:13.980]   I wrote some books while I was there.
[00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:15.740]   And I, you know, I had a regular gig
[00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:18.500]   with the Wall Street Journal later, the New York Times.
[00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:20.820]   You know, once a month I would write a column
[00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:23.060]   in those places about, you know, different public policies.
[00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:24.440]   And then more and more and more,
[00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:25.760]   back to my social science roots,
[00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:28.160]   I was writing about human happiness
[00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:30.480]   in those venues, as a matter of fact.
[00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:32.000]   And I was also learning how to raise money.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.960]   I had to raise $50 million a year.
[00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:35.840]   You know, I had a major building project.
[00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:37.640]   I was hiring scholars.
[00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:39.240]   I had 310 employees.
[00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:43.000]   And it was, that was a lot, that was hard work.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.040]   I have to say, that was very, very hard work.
[00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:48.120]   And so that was the next 10.5 years, the next challenge.
[00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:50.600]   That was part three of the career.
[00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:52.380]   - I guess, if you're breaking it into four parts,
[00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:53.220]   that's part three, right?
[00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:54.040]   - That's part three, right?
[00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:54.880]   Yeah, okay, it is part three.
[00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:55.980]   Yep, that's act three.
[00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:57.700]   That's, I mean, it's still fascinating to me, though.
[00:24:57.700 --> 00:24:59.900]   It's walking away from tenure.
[00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:00.740]   But it makes sense.
[00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:02.900]   You said, "I did this 10-year chunk.
[00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:04.740]   "What's the next 10 years?"
[00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:07.140]   So I'm assuming, is the way you were thinking is,
[00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:09.860]   okay, here's a particular place to take my spiral.
[00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:10.940]   Let's go to nonprofit management.
[00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:11.780]   Let's just try this.
[00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:13.860]   Let's actually have a policy impact.
[00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:16.220]   I'm assuming the other option you were trying to consider
[00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:19.060]   is how do I reconfigure my academic career for the next,
[00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:21.080]   a lot of that happens around that point.
[00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:23.700]   All right, I wanna build a new theoretical framework.
[00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:25.760]   I want to publish the definitive book.
[00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:27.660]   I wanna change the way, I mean, it seems like
[00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:30.100]   this is what's needed for energy in academia,
[00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:33.660]   is that 10 years in, post-promotions,
[00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:35.580]   you need to either do something differently,
[00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:37.580]   or within academia itself, you have to come up
[00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:39.920]   with some new grand project.
[00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:42.760]   So you weren't that scared walking away from tenure?
[00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:43.600]   You were figuring--
[00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:44.480]   - I mean, I was pretty nervous.
[00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:45.960]   I wasn't nervous walking away from tenure
[00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:48.960]   because I knew, you know, I had a good research record
[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:50.900]   and I was walking away from the number one school
[00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:54.180]   in my field, meaning that if I got fired from AEI,
[00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:57.080]   which was, by the way, pretty likely,
[00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:59.580]   that getting back into academia wouldn't be that hard.
[00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:01.700]   And the jobs that people were offering me at that point
[00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:05.660]   were either full professorships or administrative jobs.
[00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:06.940]   You know, when this was going on,
[00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:08.460]   a lot of places were coming and saying,
[00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:10.860]   how about thinking about being a dean?
[00:26:10.860 --> 00:26:12.740]   You know, policy schools.
[00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:16.420]   Some local people in the Syracuse came and asked
[00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:18.960]   if I thought I might want to run for Congress,
[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:20.240]   which was kind of an interesting challenge.
[00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:21.480]   There were a lot of weird things going on.
[00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:22.680]   I went home with that one to my wife.
[00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:24.600]   She said, well, as you know as Catholics,
[00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:26.440]   we don't believe in divorce.
[00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:27.280]   So, you know, that was--
[00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:28.400]   - So you can't run for Congress, yeah.
[00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:30.240]   - Yeah, no, no, yeah, yeah.
[00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:32.200]   And by the way, I would have lost anyway.
[00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:34.600]   Like, who wants this, you know, this mug for Congress?
[00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:38.100]   It's like, we're not ready for bald politicians.
[00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:39.720]   But the whole point is that it was,
[00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:40.960]   there was a lot of stuff in the air
[00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:44.040]   because I knew that the spiral was turning,
[00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:46.900]   and the universe conspires when the spiral is turning
[00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:49.740]   to give you options, and if you don't take 'em,
[00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:51.260]   shame on you, right?
[00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:52.480]   I mean, it's really what it comes down to.
[00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:55.140]   So I knew that it was gonna be fine giving up my tenure.
[00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:57.460]   What I didn't know is if I was gonna be
[00:26:57.460 --> 00:27:01.220]   ignominiously humiliated by not being able to raise money
[00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:03.420]   or having some sort of revolt by the scholars
[00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:06.460]   or getting, you know, stomped in Washington, D.C.
[00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:08.420]   And I gotta tell you, that was pretty stressful,
[00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:10.340]   and at times, it was pretty scary.
[00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:12.660]   - Right, it's the end of a,
[00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:15.140]   within six months, the building's on fire.
[00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:15.980]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:17.320]   But I mean, I remember, you know,
[00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:19.280]   I got some bad press pretty early on.
[00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:21.400]   I had to make a lot of personnel moves
[00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:23.640]   just for the good of the institution and for our budget.
[00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:27.000]   I mean, it was, I went in on January 1st, 2009
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.400]   in the teeth of the Great Recession.
[00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:32.160]   You know, we had blown a 10% hole in our budget
[00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:34.280]   in the last quarter before I came in,
[00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:36.640]   and I had to cut our cost structure by 16%
[00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:38.800]   in our first 64 days on the job,
[00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:42.600]   and I hadn't run anything ever in my life.
[00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:43.660]   I hadn't run anything.
[00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:44.500]   - Yep.
[00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:46.620]   - And so the result was, I was getting a lot of advice,
[00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:47.460]   you know, and people were,
[00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:49.140]   when you run an organization like that,
[00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:50.460]   a lot of people come out of the shadows
[00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:52.100]   and give you a list of the people
[00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:53.620]   that they think you should fire.
[00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:55.540]   Every, 'cause I had like 20 lists,
[00:27:55.540 --> 00:27:58.420]   and they were all, they were all orthogonal.
[00:27:58.420 --> 00:27:59.980]   I mean, it's like, everybody's list
[00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:01.340]   had everybody else on it.
[00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:03.780]   And so this was completely unhelpful,
[00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:05.400]   and it was scary, it was tough.
[00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:07.860]   I got lit up in the press a little bit from time to time,
[00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:09.920]   but I gotta tell you, it got tougher.
[00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:10.760]   - Yeah.
[00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:12.780]   - Which probably makes the publishing world seem easy now,
[00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:13.620]   which--
[00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:14.440]   - Oh my gosh, yeah.
[00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:17.020]   Academia, academic politics, are you kidding me?
[00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:17.860]   No problem.
[00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:19.620]   - No problem, because no one actually cares.
[00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:22.100]   Yeah, it's the, the academic politics,
[00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:23.740]   the old joke is sort of like,
[00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:26.340]   the intensity of the responses
[00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:28.980]   grows with the decreasing actual,
[00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:31.060]   like, impact of what's being discussed.
[00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:32.300]   - Yeah, that's an old Kissinger,
[00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:34.220]   that's an old Kissinger maxim, isn't it?
[00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:35.060]   - It's about true.
[00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:36.500]   I'd say the more trivial it is,
[00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:38.100]   the more people are standing on the desk
[00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:39.820]   at the faculty meeting.
[00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:41.420]   All right, let's take a brief break
[00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:43.200]   from my conversation with Arthur
[00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:44.900]   to talk about one of the sponsors
[00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:47.460]   that makes this show possible.
[00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:50.820]   This is our friends at Notion.
[00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:53.540]   Now, you've heard me talk about Notion before.
[00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:55.960]   It is a software tool that allows you
[00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:58.380]   to combine your notes, documents, and projects
[00:28:58.380 --> 00:29:00.900]   all together in one beautiful space.
[00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:03.700]   The reason why it comes up so often on this show
[00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:06.500]   is that if you run any sort of operation
[00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:10.460]   that has non-trivial information to keep track of,
[00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:14.860]   you should be using Notion to build a custom system
[00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:17.660]   for storing, organizing, and displaying your information.
[00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:20.460]   This gets to the heart of the custom workflow philosophy
[00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:23.580]   that I talk about in my book, "A World Without Email."
[00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:26.020]   Jesse and I, for example, use Notion,
[00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:29.580]   a Notion-based system to work with our ad agency.
[00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:31.260]   It's fantastic.
[00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:34.140]   All of the information about the upcoming ad reads,
[00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:35.980]   all of the ad copy.
[00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:38.900]   Here is the timestamps of the different times
[00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:39.900]   we read the ads.
[00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:41.860]   Here are the download numbers from the episodes.
[00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:44.740]   They all go into a custom Notion system
[00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:46.620]   that makes it easy for the agency
[00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:48.060]   to get the information they need,
[00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:49.860]   for us to get what we need.
[00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:51.620]   You gotta be using Notion.
[00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:53.140]   Now, the reason why I wanna talk about 'em today
[00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:55.700]   is that they have a new feature,
[00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:58.700]   which I think is pushing these type of systems
[00:29:58.700 --> 00:29:59.900]   to a new level.
[00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:04.900]   This is their new Q&A feature, an AI assistant
[00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:08.380]   that can answer questions about your information
[00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:10.380]   that you already have stored in Notion.
[00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:13.100]   So you have a question about next quarter's roadmap
[00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:15.340]   or finding that marketing campaign proposal
[00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:17.300]   or digging up a long lost link,
[00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:18.700]   or in our case, trying to figure out,
[00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:21.580]   hey, when did we last do an ad read
[00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:25.100]   for a particular advertiser?
[00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:28.980]   The AI assistant can help go and find that information
[00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:33.500]   in your pre-existing Notion system.
[00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:35.260]   So as your projects get more complex,
[00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:36.500]   finding what you're looking for
[00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:38.620]   across your entire workspace can get harder.
[00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:42.780]   Notion's Q&A comes in here and makes things easier.
[00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:44.740]   So maybe you would, for example,
[00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:47.580]   normally just ask someone to go dig around in Notion.
[00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:49.500]   Now you can ask Q&A instead.
[00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:51.980]   It can go through thousands of documents in seconds.
[00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:54.580]   It can answer your question in clear language.
[00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:57.220]   So actually answer you back in natural language.
[00:30:57.220 --> 00:31:01.060]   You can ask these questions from anywhere in Notion.
[00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:02.340]   So you can find exactly what you need
[00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:04.380]   without leaving whatever doc or system
[00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:07.460]   or a workflow page that you are already in.
[00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:10.140]   So we excited about this.
[00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:12.460]   I think this is an interesting step forward.
[00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:15.300]   Notion AI is giving you instant answers to your questions
[00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:16.900]   using information you already have
[00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:19.700]   from across your Wiki project documents and meeting notes.
[00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:21.620]   So you build your custom systems,
[00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:22.920]   but now you have this easy way
[00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:25.280]   to extract information out of them.
[00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:26.160]   So here's the good news.
[00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:29.340]   You can try Notion AI for free
[00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:33.220]   when you go to notion.com/cow.
[00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:35.020]   Now that's all lowercase letters,
[00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:39.480]   notion.com/cow to try the powerful,
[00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:42.100]   easy to use Notion AI today.
[00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:43.660]   But you have to use our link
[00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:45.740]   'cause that will help you support our show.
[00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:49.920]   So go to notion.com/cow.
[00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:54.180]   Also wanna talk about our friends at Shopify,
[00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:57.580]   whether you're selling a little or a lot,
[00:31:57.580 --> 00:31:59.900]   Shopify helps you do your thing,
[00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:02.140]   however you cha-ching.
[00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:03.860]   Now you've heard me talk about it before.
[00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:05.940]   Shopify is a global commerce platform
[00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:08.780]   that helps you sell at every stage of your business
[00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:12.940]   from the, I'm just launching my first online stop shape,
[00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:15.480]   stage to your first real life store stage,
[00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:16.320]   all the way to the,
[00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:17.980]   how do we just hit a million order stage?
[00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:20.900]   Shopify is there to help you grow,
[00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:24.280]   whether you're selling scented soap or outdoor outfits,
[00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:26.580]   or in the case of Jesse and I,
[00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:28.860]   we have a new line of t-shirts
[00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:31.940]   where instead of having the common workplace phrase,
[00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:34.140]   "Could this meeting have been an email?"
[00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:36.080]   We are now gonna have a shirt that says,
[00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:39.340]   "Could this meeting have been a telegram?"
[00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:41.380]   Let's see, we're trying to push a simpler,
[00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:43.980]   more nostalgic type of technological future.
[00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:45.460]   I think the telegraph is gonna come back,
[00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:46.880]   so we really wanna push that.
[00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:48.740]   They have all-in-one e-commerce platforms.
[00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:51.700]   They also have in-person point-of-sale systems
[00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:54.000]   that all work seamlessly together.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.380]   Their e-commerce checkouts are the best in the business.
[00:32:56.380 --> 00:32:59.740]   They help you turn browsers into buyers.
[00:32:59.740 --> 00:33:03.220]   They get a 36% better on average conversion rate
[00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:04.820]   for people who make it to your checkout
[00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:08.300]   as compared to the industry standard.
[00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:11.380]   They also now have an AI-powered assistant
[00:33:11.380 --> 00:33:12.500]   called Shopify Magic,
[00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:13.900]   so you really are taking advantage
[00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:17.520]   of all the technology you can to get those sales.
[00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:22.820]   So you can sign up for a $1 per month trial period.
[00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:24.880]   That's great, $1 per month, Jesse, it's a great deal.
[00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:25.720]   - Yeah.
[00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:29.620]   - $1 per month trial period at Shopify.com/deep.
[00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:32.900]   Make sure that's all lowercase letters.
[00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:37.900]   That's Shopify, S-H-O-P-I-F-Y, Shopify.com/deep.
[00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:39.800]   Go there now to grow your business
[00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:41.040]   no matter what stage you're in.
[00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:43.880]   That's Shopify.com/deep.
[00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:44.960]   (bell dings)
[00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:46.760]   So then we get your final act.
[00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:48.040]   Actually, this transition's maybe the one
[00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:49.560]   I'm even most interested in,
[00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:52.980]   which is where you leave the think tank world
[00:33:52.980 --> 00:33:57.520]   to essentially positive psychology, writing, some teaching.
[00:33:57.520 --> 00:34:01.260]   It's a significant change towards much more autonomous,
[00:34:01.260 --> 00:34:05.080]   sort of direct to consumer impact,
[00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:08.020]   meaning readers and students.
[00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:09.320]   Would you say the seed,
[00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:11.120]   because I'm just trying to read between the tea leaves,
[00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:12.780]   was the initial seed for this transition
[00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:14.000]   of leaving the think tank world,
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.240]   I got to write books basically full-time
[00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:18.880]   and also teaching the course at Harvard,
[00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:20.960]   was the seeds of this,
[00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:23.100]   where you had started doing some regular writing
[00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:24.560]   for the Journal and the Times,
[00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:27.660]   and it began to shift from the policy-type stuff
[00:34:27.660 --> 00:34:29.840]   you would expect from the head of,
[00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:31.920]   from the public policy professor,
[00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:33.300]   the head of Enterprise Institute,
[00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:36.300]   to the positive psychology type, more direct to people.
[00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:38.880]   Was that the seed planted right there?
[00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:42.060]   You could have another spiral turn coming up
[00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:43.680]   that was gonna be much more just you
[00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:45.720]   directly interacting with people.
[00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:47.080]   - Yeah, it was a couple of different things.
[00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:48.820]   One of them was that I had been working
[00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:51.880]   on the supply side of good ideas for a long time,
[00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:54.040]   and I realized along the way
[00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:57.200]   that it's much more powerful to work on the demand side.
[00:34:57.200 --> 00:35:00.320]   It's one thing to say I've got 75 whiz-bang ideas
[00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:02.240]   about the carried interest provision
[00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:04.200]   of the Internal Revenue Code
[00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:07.240]   and the new bomber force at the Pentagon or whatever,
[00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:09.080]   and have people go, "Huh, what?"
[00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:12.580]   including members of Congress, and sometimes it sticks,
[00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:14.220]   but you get tons of attention
[00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:17.520]   if you foment a real hunger for a better life.
[00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:18.440]   And the way to do that
[00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:19.840]   is by talking about love and happiness.
[00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:22.200]   And I was a social scientist with a background
[00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:23.960]   in studies on love and happiness.
[00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:26.320]   So I thought to myself, I wanna go back,
[00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:28.400]   number one, I wanna go to the demand side,
[00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:29.880]   because what I wanna do with the rest of my life
[00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:31.880]   is lift people up and bring them together.
[00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:34.240]   That's what I wanna do with the rest of my life.
[00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:35.700]   I wanna use science and ideas
[00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:37.080]   to lift people up and bring them together.
[00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:40.080]   It's a purely personal and very ethical
[00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:41.640]   and moral mission that I have
[00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:43.760]   for what my life means, quite frankly.
[00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:46.960]   It's my, that's my mission statement, literally,
[00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:48.600]   is that's how I wrote my mission statement.
[00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:49.920]   And the best way to do that, I thought,
[00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:53.440]   is go back to my roots as a social scientist
[00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:56.000]   to dedicate myself to creative work
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:57.680]   and to work on the demand side.
[00:35:57.680 --> 00:35:59.020]   And I thought, well, what does that mean?
[00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:00.560]   How do I do that?
[00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:02.960]   And it seemed to me that that meant kind of a combination,
[00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:05.820]   once again, as a system of three parts to it.
[00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:08.600]   Number one is I wanna teach leaders.
[00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:11.200]   I wanna teach, I wanna foment this demand
[00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:14.080]   on the side of leaders, I wanna make them hungry
[00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:15.800]   to have a better life and to become teachers
[00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:18.000]   of a better life as leaders themselves
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:19.920]   at the best place I can
[00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:22.160]   and to find the best possible future leaders.
[00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:24.840]   The second part is I want my work to be public-facing.
[00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:27.800]   In other words, I want my research to be public-facing
[00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:31.040]   because I knew perfectly, based on my own research,
[00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:33.200]   that at that point, I was 55 years old,
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:35.840]   that I wasn't gonna be doing the best bench science.
[00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:38.340]   I was not gonna be pouring stuff into test tubes
[00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:41.080]   or for my field that's doing natural experiments
[00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:46.080]   and analyzing huge datasets, large dataset econometrics.
[00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:48.720]   I'm not gonna be able to do that
[00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:50.040]   as creatively as younger people.
[00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:51.720]   I'm gonna be able to do public-facing work
[00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:55.120]   where I recognize patterns, tell stories, write lucidly.
[00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:56.880]   That's what older people are better at.
[00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:58.840]   And I wanted a public audience,
[00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:01.280]   so I wanted to be kind of a professor of practice
[00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:03.180]   where practice didn't mean telling war stories
[00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:04.020]   in the classroom.
[00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:06.800]   It meant taking academia to the masses.
[00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:08.360]   That's what I wanted to do for the writing.
[00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:11.200]   And the last part is I wanted to be out on the road
[00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:13.320]   doing public-facing work.
[00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:16.240]   I wanted to be doing workshops and speeches.
[00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:17.860]   And I figured I could do that.
[00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:20.400]   The teaching part, per se, is about 20 hours a week.
[00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:23.920]   The research part is 20, 25 hours a week.
[00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:26.520]   And the last part I could do on 15 or 20 hours a week
[00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:29.280]   and make it part of a public intellectual profile
[00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:31.520]   that maybe a university would value.
[00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:32.520]   So that's when I went out
[00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:33.960]   and I talked to a bunch of universities.
[00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:35.560]   I talked to 10 universities.
[00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:37.620]   I said I'm retiring as president of AEI.
[00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:38.620]   - Okay.
[00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:40.180]   - How does this sound?
[00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:43.020]   And a bunch of really, really good universities said,
[00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:44.240]   "That sounds pretty interesting."
[00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:47.680]   And I decided it was a good idea to get out of Dodge,
[00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:50.780]   leave Washington, because it's not great for me
[00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:53.900]   to be walking up and down the halls of my old institution
[00:37:53.900 --> 00:37:58.080]   saying, "Don't fire my friends," that kind of thing,
[00:37:58.080 --> 00:38:00.000]   because the new guy needs space to do it.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   And he's doing an outstanding job, by the way.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.480]   He'll be the best president that place has ever had.
[00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:06.840]   A guy named Robert Doerr, you probably know him.
[00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:08.440]   But I needed to get out of town,
[00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:10.640]   and so I went to a place that's kind of interesting,
[00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:12.960]   and a city that's kind of interesting,
[00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:16.320]   and literally one of the very greatest universities
[00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:17.640]   in the world, which is Harvard.
[00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:19.980]   And they split my time between the Kennedy School,
[00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:22.580]   which is the policy school, and the business school,
[00:38:22.580 --> 00:38:25.040]   which trains, obviously, executives.
[00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:26.640]   And in the business school,
[00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:29.120]   I created my happiness science class
[00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:30.240]   called Leadership and Happiness.
[00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:32.560]   And in the Kennedy School, I created my lab,
[00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:34.340]   which was the Leadership and Happiness Lab.
[00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:35.560]   And between those two things,
[00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:36.640]   and the writing, speaking, teaching,
[00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:38.200]   it's kind of worked out more or less
[00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:40.800]   the way that I saw the architecture.
[00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:42.820]   And it's been incredibly exciting.
[00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:45.940]   I have to say, I'm by far the happiest
[00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:47.400]   in my career at this point.
[00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:48.240]   - Interesting.
[00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:49.880]   So this was more systematic than I would have guessed.
[00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:51.160]   So you knew at some point,
[00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:54.600]   10 years we're gonna sunset the presidency.
[00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:55.800]   - Yeah, I told them.
[00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:57.200]   I told them at five years in.
[00:38:57.200 --> 00:38:59.640]   They said, "So what are we talking about, 20?"
[00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:02.440]   And I said, "No, we're talking about 10."
[00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:06.460]   So they deferred all of my comp to 10 years and six months,
[00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:11.260]   all of my pension, all of my retirement at AEI
[00:39:11.260 --> 00:39:12.380]   to 10 years and six months.
[00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:14.740]   So that last year was a big check, I have to say,
[00:39:14.740 --> 00:39:17.180]   but it was the last check, and it was that by design.
[00:39:17.180 --> 00:39:18.020]   - Interesting, interesting.
[00:39:18.020 --> 00:39:19.820]   So then you were surveying the landscape
[00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:21.140]   and saying, "How do I leverage
[00:39:21.140 --> 00:39:22.980]   "what we would call a career capital?"
[00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:25.940]   And you're saying, "Well, I have the academic background."
[00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:27.540]   Because of that, you knew about things
[00:39:27.540 --> 00:39:28.900]   like professors of practices,
[00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:30.940]   that these positions actually existed,
[00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:32.840]   these full-time non-tenure line positions.
[00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:35.800]   It was all just intricacies of how...
[00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:37.240]   I don't know if that's the situation you have,
[00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:38.960]   but I'm assuming that's what you were looking for.
[00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:39.800]   - Yeah, yeah, totally.
[00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:40.620]   I was looking for something
[00:39:40.620 --> 00:39:42.040]   that has kind of an industrial tenure,
[00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:44.480]   which is to say five-year rolling contract,
[00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:45.620]   so you can count on something,
[00:39:45.620 --> 00:39:47.440]   you know exactly what you're looking at,
[00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:50.640]   but that would value the public intellectual portfolio
[00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:52.880]   and see it as something that's really useful
[00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:53.720]   to the university.
[00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:56.360]   So I'm not doing any work on the side.
[00:39:56.360 --> 00:39:58.000]   Everything is on the whole.
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:01.180]   The work that I do out giving talks to different groups
[00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:04.140]   at universities and et cetera, community groups,
[00:40:04.140 --> 00:40:05.820]   it actually feeds into the work that I do
[00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:08.420]   at my academic lab and gives me ideas
[00:40:08.420 --> 00:40:10.540]   that I'm using in the classroom, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:13.060]   I'm also creating pathways for my students
[00:40:13.060 --> 00:40:15.860]   to be able to go into businesses in different places
[00:40:15.860 --> 00:40:17.620]   with their happiness expertise.
[00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:18.700]   - Yeah, so you came in and said,
[00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:19.800]   "This is exactly what I'm going to do.
[00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:22.720]   "I'm not just teaching and I'm not doing research
[00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:24.080]   "in the traditional lab sense.
[00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:26.480]   "I am going to be writing and speaking
[00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:28.140]   "and it's going to be a book every so often.
[00:40:28.140 --> 00:40:30.000]   "It's going to be my regular columns.
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:33.020]   "This is going to be my contribution."
[00:40:33.020 --> 00:40:35.260]   And so there's a term for that,
[00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:37.660]   a book I wrote a long time ago, actually a decade ago,
[00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:38.820]   "So Good They Can't Ignore You."
[00:40:38.820 --> 00:40:41.300]   I had this term I borrowed from Derek Sivers
[00:40:41.300 --> 00:40:44.140]   where he said, "Use money as a neutral indicator
[00:40:44.140 --> 00:40:45.820]   "of value of your plans."
[00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:49.500]   Basically, see if someone will actually give you money
[00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:51.180]   for this thing you have, this idea,
[00:40:51.180 --> 00:40:52.460]   and that's actually the best feedback
[00:40:52.460 --> 00:40:54.100]   on whether or not it's good or not
[00:40:54.100 --> 00:40:55.280]   as opposed to just people saying,
[00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:56.120]   "No, that sounds great.
[00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:56.960]   "You should do that.
[00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:57.840]   "You should quit and write a book.
[00:40:57.840 --> 00:40:59.420]   "That sounds romantic."
[00:40:59.420 --> 00:41:00.740]   You essentially did that.
[00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:04.120]   If this was a good idea, these universities would say,
[00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:07.180]   "Yes, we will actually hire you on a five-year contract.
[00:41:07.180 --> 00:41:09.740]   "We want you to come and do this
[00:41:09.740 --> 00:41:12.500]   "so you have full confidence."
[00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:14.820]   So you go and then this succeeds really well.
[00:41:14.820 --> 00:41:16.980]   So your, I mean, I know "Love Your Enemies,"
[00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:17.980]   your book "Love Your Enemies"
[00:41:17.980 --> 00:41:19.920]   maybe came out right after you left,
[00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:21.880]   but I'm assuming that was something you made a book on.
[00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:22.720]   - That was AEI.
[00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:24.340]   That was during the AEI years, yeah.
[00:41:24.340 --> 00:41:26.740]   - So from strength to strength,
[00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:29.700]   this is your first big test of the,
[00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:32.220]   let's do a big public-facing thing.
[00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:33.320]   The book explodes.
[00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:35.980]   It's a huge, huge bestseller.
[00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:37.940]   Everyone's talking about it.
[00:41:37.940 --> 00:41:39.340]   It sells a ton of copies.
[00:41:39.340 --> 00:41:44.300]   So what, bring us behind why that book succeeded.
[00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:45.940]   What was the ingredients coming together?
[00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:47.540]   We have a lot of aspiring writers in my audience.
[00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:49.920]   What made that book so successful?
[00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:51.860]   - Well, good luck.
[00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:53.060]   I mean, you know perfectly
[00:41:53.060 --> 00:41:55.660]   that there's a lot of serendipity that goes into it,
[00:41:55.660 --> 00:41:57.060]   that goes into book publishing.
[00:41:57.060 --> 00:41:59.020]   And, you know, if you're thinking,
[00:41:59.020 --> 00:42:00.900]   well, I'm gonna, you know, I'm gonna leave academia
[00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:02.540]   and then I'm gonna go and write a,
[00:42:02.540 --> 00:42:03.500]   or a think tank or whatever,
[00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:05.660]   I'm gonna go write a huge bestseller.
[00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:09.020]   Well, most, there's a lot of books out there and most aren't.
[00:42:09.020 --> 00:42:11.040]   And a lot of really successful authors
[00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:13.660]   and a lot of really great books
[00:42:13.660 --> 00:42:16.240]   aren't successful by market measures.
[00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:18.060]   You know, you, it's great.
[00:42:18.060 --> 00:42:20.420]   I mean, probably all of your books have been bestsellers,
[00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:22.700]   but you're pretty unusual in this way.
[00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:24.420]   And I've written, I've written a number of books
[00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:27.300]   that let's just say weren't bestsellers, you know,
[00:42:27.300 --> 00:42:29.260]   and then I thought that they were really good ideas,
[00:42:29.260 --> 00:42:31.760]   including a book on the science of happiness in 2008,
[00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:34.180]   before I left academia the first time that was, you know,
[00:42:34.180 --> 00:42:35.560]   everybody thought it was gonna be a big deal
[00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:38.260]   and it was not a big deal, right?
[00:42:38.260 --> 00:42:41.100]   And so there's a lot of serendipity that goes into it.
[00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:43.300]   But I've been looking at the market niche
[00:42:43.300 --> 00:42:44.740]   when it came to the happiness world
[00:42:44.740 --> 00:42:46.500]   that was just simply not being filled.
[00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:49.260]   And that was people in the second half of their lives.
[00:42:49.260 --> 00:42:50.900]   How can you design the second half of,
[00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:52.540]   how can you work in the first half of your life
[00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:55.020]   and design the second half of your life
[00:42:55.020 --> 00:42:58.800]   using the principles that I was able to see in big data sets
[00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:01.060]   and, you know, all the behavioral science
[00:43:01.060 --> 00:43:03.260]   and the new neuroscience that was coming out
[00:43:03.260 --> 00:43:04.860]   because I've had to retrain myself
[00:43:04.860 --> 00:43:06.560]   in neuroscience in a huge way.
[00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:08.620]   You can't be a good social scientist today
[00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:11.100]   and not know some neuroscience, just you can't do it.
[00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:13.440]   And when I got my PhD in 1998,
[00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:15.380]   nobody knew any neuroscience.
[00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:16.580]   So I, you know, I've had to go back
[00:43:16.580 --> 00:43:19.980]   and I've been studying neuroscience very seriously
[00:43:19.980 --> 00:43:21.340]   for the past five years
[00:43:21.340 --> 00:43:22.780]   so that I don't have authority in it.
[00:43:22.780 --> 00:43:25.300]   I'm not writing research, primary research in it,
[00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:28.140]   but I'm a really good consumer of that research
[00:43:28.140 --> 00:43:29.420]   for my column in my books.
[00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:30.460]   And I went and I said,
[00:43:30.460 --> 00:43:32.500]   "Look, what is it about the second half of life
[00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:33.340]   "that we need to understand?
[00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:34.980]   "What are your natural strengths?
[00:43:34.980 --> 00:43:38.360]   "How can you be a striver, a hardworking person,
[00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:41.640]   "not burn out, not become frustrated,
[00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:45.040]   "not go in decline and not to feel empty and alone
[00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:48.100]   "when you actually have to stop your nine to five?
[00:43:48.100 --> 00:43:48.940]   "How do you do it?
[00:43:48.940 --> 00:43:50.460]   "What's the secret on all these things?"
[00:43:50.460 --> 00:43:51.460]   And I wrote that book.
[00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:54.580]   And the reason it was relatively popular
[00:43:54.580 --> 00:43:57.820]   is because people wanted that, people needed that,
[00:43:57.820 --> 00:43:58.760]   and it didn't exist.
[00:43:58.760 --> 00:44:01.060]   You go do a thing that isn't out there
[00:44:01.060 --> 00:44:01.980]   at this particular point.
[00:44:01.980 --> 00:44:05.620]   I designed the book the same way that I would have a startup
[00:44:05.620 --> 00:44:08.100]   that, you know, in biotech, you don't go saying,
[00:44:08.100 --> 00:44:12.420]   "I'm gonna make a new nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug,
[00:44:12.420 --> 00:44:14.340]   "you know, a new kind of ibuprofen."
[00:44:14.340 --> 00:44:15.180]   You go out and you say,
[00:44:15.180 --> 00:44:17.780]   "I'm gonna start a company that makes a large molecule drug
[00:44:17.780 --> 00:44:19.660]   "that tries to take on a disease
[00:44:19.660 --> 00:44:21.200]   "that currently doesn't have a cure.
[00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:23.140]   "I'm gonna take a big shot."
[00:44:23.140 --> 00:44:25.500]   But the whole point is that people want it.
[00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:28.300]   Once again, there's demand, but there isn't supply.
[00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:30.020]   On that, that's the way to write a book.
[00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:31.600]   And so that's what I did.
[00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:35.060]   And that's probably the reason it was fairly popular.
[00:44:35.060 --> 00:44:37.100]   - Yeah, it's always that combination.
[00:44:37.100 --> 00:44:39.300]   A topic that people really wanna hear about
[00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:41.540]   plus the right person to write about it.
[00:44:41.540 --> 00:44:43.300]   You gotta have, you have those two things, you have it.
[00:44:43.300 --> 00:44:46.600]   I mean, I guess David Brooks sort of had indicated
[00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:48.900]   with the second mountain, you know, a few years earlier,
[00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:51.460]   like, okay, there's people thinking about this.
[00:44:51.460 --> 00:44:53.340]   But the second mountain was not nearly
[00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:56.540]   as beat-by-beat pragmatic.
[00:44:56.540 --> 00:44:58.180]   Like, here are the elements that go into this
[00:44:58.180 --> 00:44:59.220]   and here's why they matter
[00:44:59.220 --> 00:45:01.180]   and let's get into the science of it.
[00:45:01.180 --> 00:45:04.000]   It was a little bit more philosophical, I suppose,
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:04.840]   for David Brooks.
[00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:06.340]   - Yeah, I mean, there's two different ways
[00:45:06.340 --> 00:45:09.060]   to look at a startup or a book
[00:45:09.060 --> 00:45:11.620]   or anything that's a new creative endeavor.
[00:45:11.620 --> 00:45:13.860]   There's sort of the conventional entrepreneurship,
[00:45:13.860 --> 00:45:15.900]   which is to say there's a ton of demand,
[00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:18.420]   but there's no supply, so I'm gonna go create the supply.
[00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:20.500]   And the other is that there could be demand,
[00:45:20.500 --> 00:45:22.260]   but people just don't know it yet.
[00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:23.520]   That's even scarier.
[00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:25.860]   I mean, that's the iPhone challenge.
[00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:27.220]   So, I mean, Steve Jobs said,
[00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:29.020]   "Hey, see this thing in my hand?
[00:45:29.020 --> 00:45:29.940]   "You don't know what it is.
[00:45:29.940 --> 00:45:32.980]   "It's a computer in your hand that does everything."
[00:45:32.980 --> 00:45:34.900]   People are like, "I don't want it."
[00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:36.620]   And like, "Yeah, you do, trust me."
[00:45:36.620 --> 00:45:38.340]   And that's a really scary thing to do.
[00:45:38.340 --> 00:45:39.700]   That's when somebody writes a book
[00:45:39.700 --> 00:45:42.820]   that nobody knew they needed in the first place.
[00:45:42.820 --> 00:45:44.660]   And that's the, those are the, you know,
[00:45:44.660 --> 00:45:48.940]   that's the seven habits of highly effective people
[00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:52.180]   or how to win friends and influence people or the Bible
[00:45:52.180 --> 00:45:56.100]   or, you know, these things that go so stratospheric
[00:45:56.100 --> 00:45:56.980]   that you can't believe it.
[00:45:56.980 --> 00:45:58.840]   From Strength to Strength was a book
[00:45:58.840 --> 00:46:01.220]   that people were asking for that had never been written
[00:46:01.220 --> 00:46:04.140]   by a social scientist, by a scientist, basically.
[00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:05.740]   And so, yeah.
[00:46:05.740 --> 00:46:08.460]   - And how important was the being the right person
[00:46:08.460 --> 00:46:09.500]   to write it piece?
[00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:12.820]   So beyond just your story included a big shift
[00:46:13.900 --> 00:46:18.580]   in middle age, the shift away from the nonprofit,
[00:46:18.580 --> 00:46:21.140]   but also the fact that you're at Harvard
[00:46:21.140 --> 00:46:23.980]   and the fact that you had these regular columns.
[00:46:23.980 --> 00:46:25.820]   I think this sometimes gets underappreciated
[00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:29.580]   when people think about how you have a cultural impact,
[00:46:29.580 --> 00:46:32.700]   really working to get the right cultural foundation
[00:46:32.700 --> 00:46:34.540]   from which to then do the things.
[00:46:34.540 --> 00:46:36.500]   I'd say, did you have that sense that,
[00:46:36.500 --> 00:46:40.380]   how important was that foundation of brand names
[00:46:40.380 --> 00:46:42.580]   that was there to sort of get you over the hurdle
[00:46:42.580 --> 00:46:44.980]   of like, who is this and why are we listening to it?
[00:46:44.980 --> 00:46:46.300]   - Or the platform for sure.
[00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:48.660]   It's actually more that the platform is really important,
[00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:50.340]   but for I think a slightly different reason.
[00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:52.020]   And this is a super important question
[00:46:52.020 --> 00:46:53.460]   that you're asking, I think.
[00:46:53.460 --> 00:46:54.420]   There are a lot of people
[00:46:54.420 --> 00:46:56.660]   that want the public intellectual life,
[00:46:56.660 --> 00:46:59.060]   but they're kind of autodidacts.
[00:46:59.060 --> 00:47:01.540]   And one of the things that I'm doing all day long
[00:47:01.540 --> 00:47:04.260]   is recommending that people go get a PhD.
[00:47:04.260 --> 00:47:05.220]   I'm doing it all day long.
[00:47:05.220 --> 00:47:07.260]   And again, you know, I'm not using everything I did
[00:47:07.260 --> 00:47:10.260]   in my PhD every single day, but here's the thing.
[00:47:10.260 --> 00:47:12.180]   One of the things that's most important
[00:47:12.180 --> 00:47:14.860]   about the intellectual life is that you need
[00:47:14.860 --> 00:47:17.580]   a long period of time to think.
[00:47:17.580 --> 00:47:18.420]   Why?
[00:47:18.420 --> 00:47:19.740]   Because you get much better at thinking
[00:47:19.740 --> 00:47:21.380]   and life doesn't give this to you.
[00:47:21.380 --> 00:47:23.820]   Look, I mean, your whole career is about, you know,
[00:47:23.820 --> 00:47:26.660]   serious deep work, you know, and part of the reason
[00:47:26.660 --> 00:47:28.500]   is because we're so unbelievably distracted,
[00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:30.500]   but even if you have periods of, you know,
[00:47:30.500 --> 00:47:32.300]   deep work over the course of your day,
[00:47:32.300 --> 00:47:35.660]   you need months and years to just knock your head
[00:47:35.660 --> 00:47:38.820]   against the wall, solve problems, reason things out,
[00:47:38.820 --> 00:47:41.740]   be befuddled, because you become a much better,
[00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:43.020]   clearer, linear thinker.
[00:47:43.020 --> 00:47:47.220]   I mean, whether you're doing English literary criticism
[00:47:47.220 --> 00:47:51.540]   or, you know, linear programming, that's, you know,
[00:47:51.540 --> 00:47:55.020]   the PhD has really no substitute in our culture
[00:47:55.020 --> 00:47:57.780]   for becoming incredibly expert at something
[00:47:57.780 --> 00:48:00.060]   and thinking for a long time.
[00:48:00.060 --> 00:48:02.020]   And that's one of the reasons that, you know,
[00:48:02.020 --> 00:48:03.900]   if you can do that and then leverage that
[00:48:03.900 --> 00:48:05.980]   into a serious body of work that a university
[00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:08.340]   will take seriously, and on top of that,
[00:48:08.340 --> 00:48:10.860]   a really great university, then that creates a platform
[00:48:10.860 --> 00:48:15.860]   and a brand, but behind it is this non-autodidactic truth
[00:48:15.860 --> 00:48:18.500]   that you need training.
[00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:20.300]   We just need training.
[00:48:20.300 --> 00:48:21.980]   - Yeah, you got to get used to it.
[00:48:21.980 --> 00:48:24.900]   You have to, I mean, from strength to strength, right?
[00:48:24.900 --> 00:48:26.880]   You have years of thinking about that.
[00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:28.220]   Then you have this article, what was it?
[00:48:28.220 --> 00:48:31.180]   Maybe 2019, where you have an Atlantic piece
[00:48:31.180 --> 00:48:32.940]   that's trying out the ideas.
[00:48:32.940 --> 00:48:34.340]   - Right. - That goes really well.
[00:48:34.340 --> 00:48:35.380]   That's another piece of this,
[00:48:35.380 --> 00:48:37.080]   writing for major publications.
[00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:38.660]   I've definitely found this.
[00:48:38.660 --> 00:48:41.580]   Gives you a chance to stress test ideas
[00:48:41.580 --> 00:48:43.140]   against reaction as well.
[00:48:43.140 --> 00:48:46.140]   So you have years of thinking, and then you're testing,
[00:48:46.140 --> 00:48:48.780]   and most of the ideas, yeah, I write it,
[00:48:48.780 --> 00:48:50.300]   I put it out there in a long-form article.
[00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:51.340]   It's not really doing something.
[00:48:51.340 --> 00:48:52.620]   And then you occasionally get something
[00:48:52.620 --> 00:48:54.900]   that really seems to create a frision of energy,
[00:48:54.900 --> 00:48:56.860]   and after all of that, you're like,
[00:48:56.860 --> 00:48:58.800]   now I think I have something I'm willing
[00:48:58.800 --> 00:48:59.640]   to write a book about.
[00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:00.940]   That's a long process.
[00:49:00.940 --> 00:49:04.060]   - That is a long process, and it's a really critical point
[00:49:04.060 --> 00:49:06.640]   that you're making for anybody who's trying to do this,
[00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:09.580]   that you and I have the same process, obviously.
[00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:10.820]   The way, when I write a book,
[00:49:10.820 --> 00:49:13.940]   it starts off by me talking about an idea.
[00:49:13.940 --> 00:49:16.040]   And so I talk about an idea, and what I usually have,
[00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:19.140]   is I do about 175 speeches a year outside the university,
[00:49:19.140 --> 00:49:20.860]   so I do a lot of public speaking.
[00:49:20.860 --> 00:49:24.380]   And I always have three or four real stump speeches,
[00:49:24.380 --> 00:49:26.620]   but there's always a bunch that I'm trying out.
[00:49:26.620 --> 00:49:29.120]   And they're based on a bunch of different ideas,
[00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:30.420]   and a lot of things that I'm reading,
[00:49:30.420 --> 00:49:31.260]   and I put 'em together.
[00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:34.820]   I murder board a talk before I take it out on the road,
[00:49:34.820 --> 00:49:36.460]   so that I have reps on it,
[00:49:36.460 --> 00:49:38.340]   and so I know which jokes work.
[00:49:38.340 --> 00:49:40.800]   I know whether the beginnings and the endings work.
[00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:43.040]   A lot of that I learn from being a French horn player.
[00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:44.860]   Slow everything down.
[00:49:44.860 --> 00:49:46.140]   Watch your tapes.
[00:49:46.140 --> 00:49:49.460]   Get people to adjudicate the performance of the thing
[00:49:49.460 --> 00:49:51.180]   before you're doing it in public.
[00:49:51.180 --> 00:49:53.740]   Memorize the beginning and memorize the ending,
[00:49:53.740 --> 00:49:55.180]   so it's not extemporaneous,
[00:49:55.180 --> 00:49:56.480]   'cause there's not so much throat clearing
[00:49:56.480 --> 00:49:58.100]   when you're nervous, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:49:58.100 --> 00:50:00.620]   Then I'll talk about something for usually six months,
[00:50:00.620 --> 00:50:02.140]   and then I'll write something
[00:50:02.140 --> 00:50:04.340]   that's not a 1,200 word piece.
[00:50:04.340 --> 00:50:07.060]   It's usually a 7,000 word piece
[00:50:07.060 --> 00:50:09.180]   based on all the things that I've been thinking about
[00:50:09.180 --> 00:50:10.320]   by talking about it.
[00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:12.540]   I learn by having conversations, typically.
[00:50:12.540 --> 00:50:13.940]   That's the kind of learner that I am.
[00:50:13.940 --> 00:50:16.620]   And I write, I beta test it in the long piece
[00:50:16.620 --> 00:50:17.860]   where the stakes are low.
[00:50:17.860 --> 00:50:19.980]   I mean, who cares if not that many people read it?
[00:50:19.980 --> 00:50:21.460]   It'll just drop off the leaderboard
[00:50:21.460 --> 00:50:23.500]   of the Atlantic or something quickly.
[00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:26.060]   But if it lights up, if it's a big deal,
[00:50:26.060 --> 00:50:27.480]   then I know it's something big,
[00:50:27.480 --> 00:50:29.780]   and then I start digging into the book version
[00:50:29.780 --> 00:50:30.780]   is the way that that works.
[00:50:30.780 --> 00:50:34.700]   But that's a long process of internally cogitating,
[00:50:34.700 --> 00:50:38.300]   of exposing ideas to external scrutiny,
[00:50:38.300 --> 00:50:42.740]   of fermenting the ideas in a productive way
[00:50:42.740 --> 00:50:45.020]   so that they actually get better in the age a little bit.
[00:50:45.020 --> 00:50:46.300]   And you can't, you know it's like,
[00:50:46.300 --> 00:50:47.860]   hey, I had an idea for a book and I wrote it.
[00:50:47.860 --> 00:50:50.860]   No way, that's the recipe for a terrible book.
[00:50:50.860 --> 00:50:52.980]   - This used to be my,
[00:50:52.980 --> 00:50:55.680]   the thing I was known for early in my career as a professor,
[00:50:55.680 --> 00:50:59.140]   they would often invite me to come to dissertation boot camps
[00:50:59.140 --> 00:51:01.420]   where doctoral students work on dissertations.
[00:51:01.420 --> 00:51:03.300]   You'd get together, kind of motivate each other,
[00:51:03.300 --> 00:51:04.900]   and you'd have some speakers come in,
[00:51:04.900 --> 00:51:06.300]   and they would have me come speak.
[00:51:06.300 --> 00:51:09.100]   And the thing I'd always get mad about was,
[00:51:09.100 --> 00:51:10.660]   and this was maybe a futile battle,
[00:51:10.660 --> 00:51:11.980]   is that all the other speakers,
[00:51:11.980 --> 00:51:14.780]   all the terminology was all focused on writing.
[00:51:14.780 --> 00:51:16.940]   You got to make sure you write, put in time to write,
[00:51:16.940 --> 00:51:18.980]   get your pages every day.
[00:51:18.980 --> 00:51:20.020]   You got to keep writing.
[00:51:20.020 --> 00:51:21.220]   We got to help each other writing.
[00:51:21.220 --> 00:51:22.380]   And I was always coming in and saying,
[00:51:22.380 --> 00:51:24.020]   well, what about thinking?
[00:51:24.020 --> 00:51:26.900]   I mean, you need to be thinking about thinking.
[00:51:26.900 --> 00:51:28.180]   Do you have enough time for think?
[00:51:28.180 --> 00:51:29.020]   How do you think?
[00:51:29.020 --> 00:51:30.140]   Where do you go to think?
[00:51:30.140 --> 00:51:34.380]   We don't talk enough about thinking as a standalone term.
[00:51:34.380 --> 00:51:35.700]   This is something curmudgeonly, I guess,
[00:51:35.700 --> 00:51:37.340]   academics like us like to think about.
[00:51:37.340 --> 00:51:38.860]   But we don't think enough about thinking,
[00:51:38.860 --> 00:51:40.500]   and it's different than writing.
[00:51:40.500 --> 00:51:43.540]   The whole culture of writing online,
[00:51:43.540 --> 00:51:45.660]   sort of instruction is all about pages.
[00:51:45.660 --> 00:51:48.620]   - Yeah, you know, I think first, talk second,
[00:51:48.620 --> 00:51:50.260]   then write third.
[00:51:50.260 --> 00:51:52.460]   And then I write short form first,
[00:51:52.460 --> 00:51:55.500]   medium form second, and long form third.
[00:51:55.500 --> 00:51:57.340]   And so when you get a book that I write,
[00:51:57.340 --> 00:52:00.380]   it's been in there, it's been rolling.
[00:52:00.380 --> 00:52:03.620]   The problem with it is that by the time the book comes out,
[00:52:03.620 --> 00:52:05.740]   I don't want to talk about it anymore.
[00:52:05.740 --> 00:52:07.260]   I don't want to talk about the next thing.
[00:52:07.260 --> 00:52:08.780]   But then, of course, you're on tour,
[00:52:08.780 --> 00:52:10.460]   and then you're on tour for the next year.
[00:52:10.460 --> 00:52:11.940]   So, you know, "From Strength to Strength"
[00:52:11.940 --> 00:52:14.220]   came out in February of 2022,
[00:52:14.220 --> 00:52:15.860]   and I'm still talking about it.
[00:52:15.860 --> 00:52:16.700]   You know, 'cause people are saying,
[00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:18.380]   "Can you come talk about that book?"
[00:52:18.380 --> 00:52:21.420]   But yeah, I mean, these are pretty nice problems to have.
[00:52:21.420 --> 00:52:22.900]   - Yeah, well, okay, then that brings us
[00:52:22.900 --> 00:52:26.180]   where we wanted to get to from the beginning,
[00:52:26.180 --> 00:52:30.020]   which is the newer book, "Build the Life You Want."
[00:52:30.020 --> 00:52:33.060]   This is co-authored with Oprah Winfrey.
[00:52:33.060 --> 00:52:35.140]   So what's this step?
[00:52:35.140 --> 00:52:38.820]   I think for most people, this is completely mind-boggling.
[00:52:38.820 --> 00:52:40.700]   They assume, you know,
[00:52:40.700 --> 00:52:43.580]   Stedman showed up at your house with, you know,
[00:52:43.580 --> 00:52:45.900]   Oprah's favorite, like some sort of trumpets blaring,
[00:52:45.900 --> 00:52:48.140]   but I'm sure it was probably much more prosaic than that.
[00:52:48.140 --> 00:52:49.220]   How did this come to be?
[00:52:49.220 --> 00:52:51.420]   And this is also for you pretty quick.
[00:52:51.420 --> 00:52:52.700]   This is breaking your two-year rule,
[00:52:52.700 --> 00:52:53.900]   and I'm assuming when Oprah comes,
[00:52:53.900 --> 00:52:54.980]   you break your two-year rule.
[00:52:54.980 --> 00:52:57.180]   So how did we get from strength to strength is out,
[00:52:57.180 --> 00:52:58.780]   it's doing well,
[00:52:58.780 --> 00:53:01.100]   within a year and a few months after that,
[00:53:01.100 --> 00:53:02.700]   your new book is out?
[00:53:02.700 --> 00:53:03.780]   - So yeah, that was,
[00:53:03.780 --> 00:53:06.940]   so I have a column in "The Atlantic" at this point.
[00:53:06.940 --> 00:53:08.500]   You know, during the coronavirus epidemic,
[00:53:08.500 --> 00:53:10.780]   I wasn't able to go out on the road.
[00:53:10.780 --> 00:53:13.220]   I had more time for creative work at home,
[00:53:13.220 --> 00:53:15.860]   you know, in the silence of my head,
[00:53:15.860 --> 00:53:16.700]   where I have, you know,
[00:53:16.700 --> 00:53:18.860]   the sounds of screaming children, et cetera.
[00:53:18.860 --> 00:53:21.420]   Ever since my kids moved out,
[00:53:21.420 --> 00:53:23.980]   I have it inside my head as opposed to outside.
[00:53:23.980 --> 00:53:26.020]   And I thought, well, let's try some new things.
[00:53:26.020 --> 00:53:27.180]   And I'm, you know, I've been friends for a while
[00:53:27.180 --> 00:53:29.460]   with Jeff Goldberg, who's the editor of "The Atlantic."
[00:53:29.460 --> 00:53:32.500]   And he said, "Why don't we do a happiness column
[00:53:32.500 --> 00:53:33.780]   "on the science of happiness?"
[00:53:33.780 --> 00:53:35.700]   You know, you write these longer form pieces.
[00:53:35.700 --> 00:53:36.540]   I said, "Okay."
[00:53:36.540 --> 00:53:38.700]   So we started this column and it was really popular.
[00:53:38.700 --> 00:53:41.180]   You know, it's 1,200 or 1,300 words weekly
[00:53:41.180 --> 00:53:42.340]   on a different topic.
[00:53:42.340 --> 00:53:44.500]   And so it's kind of like writing a lay version
[00:53:44.500 --> 00:53:48.180]   of the literature review part of an academic article
[00:53:48.180 --> 00:53:49.980]   on a different topic every week,
[00:53:49.980 --> 00:53:51.620]   which is an incredible challenge,
[00:53:51.620 --> 00:53:52.940]   but it's super interesting.
[00:53:52.940 --> 00:53:55.420]   I mean, it's like, I can't believe,
[00:53:55.420 --> 00:53:58.020]   I mean, today I just turned in a column
[00:53:58.020 --> 00:54:01.300]   about why you might not want to be the boss.
[00:54:01.300 --> 00:54:05.060]   Every, you have a, the evolutionary psychology says,
[00:54:05.060 --> 00:54:07.700]   get, rise in the hierarchy, rise in the hierarchy,
[00:54:07.700 --> 00:54:09.300]   get promoted, get promoted.
[00:54:09.300 --> 00:54:11.900]   And that's an imperative from mother nature
[00:54:11.900 --> 00:54:13.860]   for you to get more mates and survive,
[00:54:13.860 --> 00:54:15.580]   but it's not an imperative to get happier
[00:54:15.580 --> 00:54:17.580]   'cause mother nature doesn't care if you're happier.
[00:54:17.580 --> 00:54:20.060]   Here are the costs based on natural experiments
[00:54:20.060 --> 00:54:21.420]   where people are promoted or not
[00:54:21.420 --> 00:54:23.100]   and what actually happened to their emotional life
[00:54:23.100 --> 00:54:24.980]   in the two years after their promotion.
[00:54:24.980 --> 00:54:28.420]   And I said, if you tend toward anger or loneliness,
[00:54:28.420 --> 00:54:31.420]   don't become the boss, fight mother nature.
[00:54:31.420 --> 00:54:32.260]   That's what I wrote.
[00:54:32.260 --> 00:54:33.220]   I turned that one in today.
[00:54:33.220 --> 00:54:34.660]   It's for nine weeks from now.
[00:54:34.660 --> 00:54:36.860]   I'm about eight or nine weeks out of my column.
[00:54:36.860 --> 00:54:38.060]   And I, you know, I give suggestions
[00:54:38.060 --> 00:54:39.780]   and I live out the suggestions, et cetera.
[00:54:39.780 --> 00:54:40.700]   Super interesting.
[00:54:40.700 --> 00:54:41.980]   So I'm putting that column out there
[00:54:41.980 --> 00:54:45.820]   and we get about 500,000 readers a week on that column.
[00:54:45.820 --> 00:54:47.060]   And I don't know who they are.
[00:54:47.060 --> 00:54:48.240]   I don't know who they are.
[00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:50.000]   You know, I found, I find out from the editor that,
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:51.700]   you know, some, you know,
[00:54:51.700 --> 00:54:53.340]   former president reads the column.
[00:54:53.340 --> 00:54:54.280]   Cool, that's great.
[00:54:54.280 --> 00:54:55.880]   But it turns out that one of my regular readers
[00:54:55.880 --> 00:54:57.780]   during coronavirus when we're all locked down
[00:54:57.780 --> 00:55:00.860]   was Oprah Winfrey, who's super interested in ideas.
[00:55:00.860 --> 00:55:04.060]   I mean, she's a high caliber intellect
[00:55:04.060 --> 00:55:06.060]   and she's very interested in all kinds of ideas
[00:55:06.060 --> 00:55:07.860]   and interested in the science of happiness.
[00:55:07.860 --> 00:55:08.700]   So she's reading it.
[00:55:08.700 --> 00:55:10.460]   When the new book comes out, "From Strength to Strength"
[00:55:10.460 --> 00:55:11.620]   back in February, 2022,
[00:55:11.620 --> 00:55:14.420]   she read it when it, on the first day it hit the market
[00:55:14.420 --> 00:55:15.380]   and called me up.
[00:55:15.380 --> 00:55:16.460]   This is Oprah Winfrey.
[00:55:16.460 --> 00:55:19.040]   And I'm like, yeah, and I'm Batman, right?
[00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:22.020]   I mean, turns out it's Oprah Winfrey.
[00:55:22.020 --> 00:55:23.100]   - She just called.
[00:55:23.100 --> 00:55:26.820]   - Yeah, I mean, her team called my team, et cetera.
[00:55:26.820 --> 00:55:28.980]   But we, so we wound up talking, right?
[00:55:28.980 --> 00:55:31.740]   And she said, we think about things in much the same way.
[00:55:31.740 --> 00:55:33.140]   Why don't you come on my podcast
[00:55:33.140 --> 00:55:34.300]   to talk about your book, which we did.
[00:55:34.300 --> 00:55:35.940]   And we were like a house on fire.
[00:55:35.940 --> 00:55:37.300]   Her mission is the same as mine.
[00:55:37.300 --> 00:55:39.060]   It's just different means of getting at it.
[00:55:39.060 --> 00:55:41.780]   Lift people up and bring them together with ideas.
[00:55:41.780 --> 00:55:42.980]   Lift them up and bring them together
[00:55:42.980 --> 00:55:45.100]   in bonds of happiness and love.
[00:55:45.100 --> 00:55:46.380]   That's what we want, right?
[00:55:46.380 --> 00:55:48.920]   I mean, a better society, happier people.
[00:55:48.920 --> 00:55:49.980]   It's beautiful.
[00:55:49.980 --> 00:55:51.900]   And so we decided, why don't we team up on something?
[00:55:51.900 --> 00:55:54.340]   We kicked around a bunch of different ideas,
[00:55:54.340 --> 00:55:56.060]   texting back and forth and back and forth
[00:55:56.060 --> 00:55:56.900]   and back and forth.
[00:55:56.900 --> 00:55:58.740]   And finally she says, you know, if I had my show,
[00:55:58.740 --> 00:56:01.460]   she had a show for 25 years, an iconic show
[00:56:01.460 --> 00:56:04.260]   that was on from the time that I was in my early 20s
[00:56:04.260 --> 00:56:06.460]   on national television.
[00:56:06.460 --> 00:56:09.620]   And I mean, it really, really brought people together.
[00:56:09.620 --> 00:56:12.340]   I mean, millions of five, 10 million people a day
[00:56:12.340 --> 00:56:13.500]   watched that show.
[00:56:13.500 --> 00:56:15.940]   And what she would do is she would find somebody
[00:56:15.940 --> 00:56:17.520]   who had a bunch of ideas she thought was interesting
[00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:18.820]   and have them on the show 30 times
[00:56:18.820 --> 00:56:21.760]   and launch those ideas into the zeitgeist.
[00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:24.220]   She said, if I had my show, I'd have you on 30 times,
[00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:25.060]   but I don't have a show.
[00:56:25.060 --> 00:56:27.380]   So why don't I host a book?
[00:56:27.380 --> 00:56:28.820]   You know, we do it that way where, you know,
[00:56:28.820 --> 00:56:31.040]   we write together this book on the science of happiness.
[00:56:31.040 --> 00:56:32.900]   That's kind of a conversation between us
[00:56:32.900 --> 00:56:34.500]   and I'm putting in the connective tissue
[00:56:34.500 --> 00:56:37.300]   and then we'll read it for the audio version.
[00:56:37.300 --> 00:56:38.820]   And I said, cool, that's awesome.
[00:56:38.820 --> 00:56:40.860]   And so basically I went back, we wove together
[00:56:40.860 --> 00:56:43.120]   a bunch of stuff that had been in columns,
[00:56:43.120 --> 00:56:45.620]   but it was fundamentally about the neuroscience
[00:56:45.620 --> 00:56:48.840]   and social science of emotional self-management.
[00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:50.740]   How you treat what's going on inside your head
[00:56:50.740 --> 00:56:53.780]   with the same seriousness as you treat your job.
[00:56:53.780 --> 00:56:55.620]   Because most people think, you know,
[00:56:55.620 --> 00:56:57.000]   there's nothing I can do about my feelings.
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:58.440]   My feelings happen to me.
[00:56:58.440 --> 00:57:00.780]   That's actually completely wrong.
[00:57:00.780 --> 00:57:03.900]   It's a missed opportunity to have a much happier life.
[00:57:03.900 --> 00:57:06.620]   It's the single biggest mistake that people make
[00:57:06.620 --> 00:57:07.660]   is thinking that.
[00:57:07.660 --> 00:57:09.500]   So we tested a bunch of these ideas.
[00:57:09.500 --> 00:57:12.140]   We murder boarded the concepts.
[00:57:12.140 --> 00:57:14.580]   I wrote the book chapters and we passed them back and forth
[00:57:14.580 --> 00:57:16.940]   and she edited and added stuff, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:57:16.940 --> 00:57:20.220]   And we published that book in September of this year,
[00:57:20.220 --> 00:57:23.260]   September of 2023, Build the Life You Want,
[00:57:23.260 --> 00:57:25.260]   The Art and Science of Getting Happier.
[00:57:25.260 --> 00:57:27.860]   And it was, Cal, it was a total blast.
[00:57:27.860 --> 00:57:29.620]   I gotta tell you, working with Oprah Winfrey
[00:57:29.620 --> 00:57:31.540]   is as fun as it sounds.
[00:57:31.540 --> 00:57:33.840]   - Now, I already gave a rave review of this book
[00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:37.180]   on the show because it's so connected to the way
[00:57:37.180 --> 00:57:38.420]   that we talk about the deep life here,
[00:57:38.420 --> 00:57:41.280]   which is identify the different areas of life
[00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:43.460]   that are important and give each of those attention.
[00:57:43.460 --> 00:57:45.460]   I think that approach,
[00:57:45.460 --> 00:57:47.500]   which was the exact structure of the book,
[00:57:47.500 --> 00:57:49.860]   well, let's talk about work, but let's talk about faith,
[00:57:49.860 --> 00:57:51.700]   let's talk about family.
[00:57:51.700 --> 00:57:54.180]   Did you start in this murder boarding process,
[00:57:54.180 --> 00:57:56.860]   was it a situation where you started with 10
[00:57:56.860 --> 00:57:59.420]   or a dozen candidates for these are areas
[00:57:59.420 --> 00:58:01.980]   that really matter for paying attention to
[00:58:01.980 --> 00:58:04.740]   and then it narrowed down as you begin to develop it?
[00:58:04.740 --> 00:58:07.340]   Or after three years or two and a half years
[00:58:07.340 --> 00:58:10.620]   of doing the column, was it a 30 minute conversation
[00:58:10.620 --> 00:58:11.740]   where you're saying, it is clear
[00:58:11.740 --> 00:58:12.900]   that these are the five things?
[00:58:12.900 --> 00:58:15.380]   Like, I mean, I can see, I've been doing this.
[00:58:15.380 --> 00:58:17.860]   What was that process like finding the buckets
[00:58:17.860 --> 00:58:19.500]   you told people to focus on?
[00:58:19.500 --> 00:58:21.580]   - Yeah, the first, yeah, so I had a concept
[00:58:21.580 --> 00:58:23.540]   of what I thought it might be and then we got to,
[00:58:23.540 --> 00:58:25.580]   Oprah Winfrey and I got together at her place.
[00:58:25.580 --> 00:58:27.900]   She has a, she lives in Southern California
[00:58:27.900 --> 00:58:31.320]   and we got together for a period of time together
[00:58:31.320 --> 00:58:34.040]   where we just stayed, you know, I stayed in her guest house
[00:58:34.040 --> 00:58:37.500]   and we took our meals together and we would just work
[00:58:37.500 --> 00:58:39.500]   on the work on work on the structure of the manuscript
[00:58:39.500 --> 00:58:42.860]   and we would test ideas and we had people from her team,
[00:58:42.860 --> 00:58:44.980]   people from my team saying, no, it's not gonna work,
[00:58:44.980 --> 00:58:46.220]   that doesn't make sense, et cetera.
[00:58:46.220 --> 00:58:49.820]   And so that was the basis of the original idea.
[00:58:49.820 --> 00:58:51.580]   Then as I started getting into the writing,
[00:58:51.580 --> 00:58:55.060]   as you know, when you write it, it's not the same.
[00:58:55.060 --> 00:58:58.020]   When you write it, it's not so easy
[00:58:58.020 --> 00:58:59.740]   because it turns out the things that made sense
[00:58:59.740 --> 00:59:02.080]   in your head don't make sense on the page anymore.
[00:59:02.080 --> 00:59:04.660]   And so that's when I started passing out ideas
[00:59:04.660 --> 00:59:08.620]   and doing kind of internal murder boarding with my students.
[00:59:08.620 --> 00:59:11.180]   You know, I would try out ideas in my lectures.
[00:59:11.180 --> 00:59:12.980]   I would ask students for feedback
[00:59:12.980 --> 00:59:14.820]   'cause my graduate students, my MBA students
[00:59:14.820 --> 00:59:17.420]   at the Harvard Business School, they're phenomenal.
[00:59:17.420 --> 00:59:19.940]   They're smart, they're interesting, they're interested,
[00:59:19.940 --> 00:59:22.240]   they're curious, it's really great.
[00:59:22.240 --> 00:59:25.480]   Asking people that I was pretty familiar with,
[00:59:25.480 --> 00:59:26.780]   you know, the people I had worked with,
[00:59:26.780 --> 00:59:29.380]   especially junior people at the American Enterprise Institute
[00:59:29.380 --> 00:59:31.180]   to help me out with these ideas as well.
[00:59:31.180 --> 00:59:33.100]   She was doing the same thing.
[00:59:33.100 --> 00:59:34.820]   Then we got back together and put together
[00:59:34.820 --> 00:59:37.820]   a kind of a mega manuscript and started down selecting ideas
[00:59:37.820 --> 00:59:39.020]   so it would be the right length.
[00:59:39.020 --> 00:59:40.860]   The right length for a book like this,
[00:59:40.860 --> 00:59:42.620]   it's about the same length as most of your books,
[00:59:42.620 --> 00:59:44.500]   around 60,000 words.
[00:59:44.500 --> 00:59:46.940]   And the reason is you wanna keep people's attention enough
[00:59:46.940 --> 00:59:49.140]   that they can read the whole book in a weekend
[00:59:49.140 --> 00:59:50.860]   and they can absorb the idea.
[00:59:50.860 --> 00:59:52.100]   There's a lot of research on this.
[00:59:52.100 --> 00:59:54.580]   If it takes them three weeks, by the end of the book,
[00:59:54.580 --> 00:59:56.160]   they're not gonna remember the beginning.
[00:59:56.160 --> 00:59:59.420]   And that's a problem and most people will drop off.
[00:59:59.420 --> 01:00:00.900]   I mean, there's all that literature out there
[01:00:00.900 --> 01:00:02.900]   about nobody finishes books.
[01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:05.140]   You know, you want people to actually finish the book.
[01:00:05.140 --> 01:00:08.100]   And so more than 60,000 words is gonna be a problem.
[01:00:08.100 --> 01:00:09.580]   The original version of the manuscript
[01:00:09.580 --> 01:00:11.460]   was closer to 100,000 words.
[01:00:11.460 --> 01:00:14.020]   And we just started murdering parts of it.
[01:00:14.020 --> 01:00:16.100]   Just kill it, kill it, kill it, kill it, kill it,
[01:00:16.100 --> 01:00:19.020]   and cutting it down until we had the essential part
[01:00:19.020 --> 01:00:20.200]   where the fat was stripped out.
[01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:21.340]   And that was the book.
[01:00:21.340 --> 01:00:22.740]   - Well, and then my final question here,
[01:00:22.740 --> 01:00:25.220]   'cause I know we're short on time.
[01:00:25.220 --> 01:00:27.900]   My audience has a real hunger for exactly
[01:00:27.900 --> 01:00:28.860]   what you're doing in that book,
[01:00:28.860 --> 01:00:33.220]   which is let's get systematic in thinking through our life.
[01:00:33.220 --> 01:00:36.740]   Are you picking up this exact same strong signal
[01:00:36.740 --> 01:00:39.140]   from your students, from the audience
[01:00:39.140 --> 01:00:39.980]   that are reading this book?
[01:00:39.980 --> 01:00:42.280]   What is your take on what it is right now,
[01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:44.740]   sort of post-pandemic, late 2023?
[01:00:44.740 --> 01:00:48.460]   What is your take on what people are hungry for
[01:00:48.460 --> 01:00:51.620]   in terms of their life at this moment?
[01:00:51.620 --> 01:00:56.540]   - People are hungry to feel like they have control
[01:00:56.540 --> 01:00:58.620]   over their own lives and their own feelings,
[01:00:58.620 --> 01:01:00.180]   their own emotions.
[01:01:00.180 --> 01:01:01.700]   And they feel like they don't.
[01:01:01.700 --> 01:01:02.540]   They feel like they don't.
[01:01:02.540 --> 01:01:03.900]   They feel like they're being managed
[01:01:03.900 --> 01:01:06.100]   by their own emotional processes
[01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:08.260]   and managed by the outside world,
[01:01:08.260 --> 01:01:11.580]   managed by the distraction industrial industry
[01:01:11.580 --> 01:01:15.060]   that you talk about really compellingly all the time.
[01:01:15.060 --> 01:01:16.860]   They're feeling like they're being managed
[01:01:16.860 --> 01:01:18.060]   and they're feeling out of control.
[01:01:18.060 --> 01:01:20.000]   That's one of the reasons that you see such an uptick
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.660]   in generalized anxiety and clinical depression.
[01:01:22.660 --> 01:01:25.500]   I mean, the symptoms of clinical depression,
[01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:28.220]   if you believe this, are up by about 4X
[01:01:28.220 --> 01:01:29.180]   since the beginning of COVID
[01:01:29.180 --> 01:01:30.860]   and are not dropping at this point.
[01:01:30.860 --> 01:01:32.340]   And it has everything to do with the fact
[01:01:32.340 --> 01:01:34.980]   that we're being exogenously managed.
[01:01:34.980 --> 01:01:37.360]   And the whole point is it doesn't have to be the case.
[01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:40.420]   And so that's the big idea from my class
[01:01:40.420 --> 01:01:44.980]   is if there's one word that characterizes my class,
[01:01:44.980 --> 01:01:48.580]   it's metacognition, which is thinking about thinking,
[01:01:48.580 --> 01:01:51.540]   which is awareness of your own emotional processes.
[01:01:51.540 --> 01:01:53.540]   When you are aware,
[01:01:53.540 --> 01:01:57.180]   consciously aware of your subconscious processes,
[01:01:57.180 --> 01:02:00.180]   when your prefrontal cortex is paying attention
[01:02:00.180 --> 01:02:02.900]   to your limbic system, you have power.
[01:02:02.900 --> 01:02:06.020]   You have practically unbridled power,
[01:02:06.020 --> 01:02:07.780]   but it doesn't come naturally.
[01:02:07.780 --> 01:02:09.820]   You know, we're very reactive creatures.
[01:02:09.820 --> 01:02:12.580]   We want our limbic system, it flies out of control.
[01:02:12.580 --> 01:02:14.460]   It does all kinds of crazy things all the time.
[01:02:14.460 --> 01:02:17.260]   It delivers us emotions constantly
[01:02:17.260 --> 01:02:19.580]   and people are manipulating our limbic system.
[01:02:19.580 --> 01:02:21.980]   When you understand the basic neuroscience
[01:02:21.980 --> 01:02:24.380]   and social science of how emotions work,
[01:02:24.380 --> 01:02:27.620]   then you can actually develop a repertoire of techniques
[01:02:27.620 --> 01:02:30.260]   from meditation to prayers of petition,
[01:02:30.260 --> 01:02:33.900]   to journaling, to therapy, to walking in nature
[01:02:33.900 --> 01:02:35.820]   and grounding yourself, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:02:35.820 --> 01:02:39.040]   And always using the techniques of deep work, by the way,
[01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:41.380]   no joke, your stuff is completely, as you know,
[01:02:41.380 --> 01:02:42.660]   complimentary to this.
[01:02:42.660 --> 01:02:45.380]   You can, in this metacognitive state,
[01:02:45.380 --> 01:02:47.720]   you can manage your emotions so they don't manage you
[01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:49.420]   and then you have power of your life,
[01:02:49.420 --> 01:02:51.180]   power you never thought you had.
[01:02:51.180 --> 01:02:53.240]   So this is intended to be a compliment
[01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:56.020]   for many of the techniques that people think of
[01:02:56.020 --> 01:02:57.620]   in the self-improvement literature
[01:02:57.620 --> 01:02:59.540]   of how to structure their day, how to structure their work,
[01:02:59.540 --> 01:03:00.880]   how to structure their life.
[01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:03.420]   This is how to structure your feelings in your mind
[01:03:03.420 --> 01:03:04.760]   alongside of all that.
[01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:06.060]   - Which is, and I'll say for my listeners,
[01:03:06.060 --> 01:03:07.820]   one of the really cool and distinctive parts
[01:03:07.820 --> 01:03:10.060]   of Build A Life You Want is that right up front,
[01:03:10.060 --> 01:03:11.540]   you're talking about metacognition.
[01:03:11.540 --> 01:03:13.420]   Like right up front, you're talking about emotions
[01:03:13.420 --> 01:03:14.860]   and feelings, which is a big change
[01:03:14.860 --> 01:03:17.900]   because this field tends to be very action-focused.
[01:03:17.900 --> 01:03:20.460]   Like, well, you need to make this plan
[01:03:20.460 --> 01:03:24.620]   and then execute this plan and it's all about mechanistic
[01:03:24.620 --> 01:03:27.000]   and that's something I loved about the book
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.700]   is that it's very aware that your emotions,
[01:03:29.700 --> 01:03:32.460]   your thought patterns is everything
[01:03:32.460 --> 01:03:33.900]   when it comes to your perception of life,
[01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:34.740]   the actions you take.
[01:03:34.740 --> 01:03:36.460]   It's a very aware book.
[01:03:36.460 --> 01:03:37.740]   So I know we're short on time,
[01:03:37.740 --> 01:03:39.620]   so I wanna point people towards the right places
[01:03:39.620 --> 01:03:43.220]   to bathe in more of this wisdom from Arthur Brooks.
[01:03:43.220 --> 01:03:44.980]   The two books we talked about mainly
[01:03:44.980 --> 01:03:48.980]   was From Strength to Strength and Build The Life You Want.
[01:03:48.980 --> 01:03:51.060]   Your column, that's still running in The Atlantic, right?
[01:03:51.060 --> 01:03:53.220]   What does that call for people who are looking for it?
[01:03:53.220 --> 01:03:54.300]   - How to Build A Life.
[01:03:54.300 --> 01:03:56.340]   - How to Build A Life. - How to Build A Life.
[01:03:56.340 --> 01:04:01.180]   By the way, The Life You Want is Oprah's show,
[01:04:01.180 --> 01:04:02.860]   internet show, so How to Build A Life
[01:04:02.860 --> 01:04:05.420]   plus The Life You Want is like those two products
[01:04:05.420 --> 01:04:09.660]   that a baby called Build The Life You Want.
[01:04:09.660 --> 01:04:11.380]   So How to Build A Life is my column
[01:04:11.380 --> 01:04:13.780]   every Thursday morning in The Atlantic.
[01:04:13.780 --> 01:04:15.020]   - Excellent, and then do you do,
[01:04:15.020 --> 01:04:17.740]   what about online platform, social, et cetera?
[01:04:17.740 --> 01:04:19.220]   - I do, I'm on social.
[01:04:19.220 --> 01:04:23.060]   I'm on Instagram and I'm on Twitter, X,
[01:04:23.060 --> 01:04:24.540]   whatever it's called.
[01:04:24.540 --> 01:04:28.260]   What I do is I use it as a way to put out content
[01:04:28.260 --> 01:04:29.500]   around this subject.
[01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:32.780]   I'm not on it for my edification or to find news
[01:04:32.780 --> 01:04:35.300]   or to have conversations or God knows not
[01:04:35.300 --> 01:04:36.460]   to get into fights with other people.
[01:04:36.460 --> 01:04:38.140]   I'm using it to broadcast what I think
[01:04:38.140 --> 01:04:40.460]   are really good ideas to edify other people as well.
[01:04:40.460 --> 01:04:42.300]   And then I have a lot of stuff on YouTube.
[01:04:42.300 --> 01:04:44.100]   I have a lot of, you know, Oprah and I
[01:04:44.100 --> 01:04:46.420]   just dropped three video casts on YouTube
[01:04:46.420 --> 01:04:49.460]   that are on YouTube and actually on the Starbucks app
[01:04:49.460 --> 01:04:51.340]   of all things, which is kind of an interesting thing.
[01:04:51.340 --> 01:04:54.140]   So you can, you know, sip your venti dark roast
[01:04:54.140 --> 01:04:57.260]   while watching me and Oprah talk about the limbic system
[01:04:57.260 --> 01:04:58.820]   if that floats your boat.
[01:04:58.820 --> 01:05:01.260]   - It's 100% what I want to do.
[01:05:01.260 --> 01:05:02.100]   - Well, this is great.
[01:05:02.100 --> 01:05:03.140]   So Arthur Brooks, thank you very much.
[01:05:03.140 --> 01:05:04.220]   And thanks for coming on the show.
[01:05:04.220 --> 01:05:06.380]   This was a fantastic and thank you.
[01:05:06.380 --> 01:05:08.180]   It may seem like we didn't talk a ton
[01:05:08.180 --> 01:05:10.660]   about the details of the last book,
[01:05:10.660 --> 01:05:12.620]   but it's all we talked about.
[01:05:12.620 --> 01:05:15.100]   Because your life, I think, and the way you're thinking
[01:05:15.100 --> 01:05:16.900]   is just this fantastic case study
[01:05:16.900 --> 01:05:19.980]   into how a really thoughtful, intentional person
[01:05:19.980 --> 01:05:21.380]   shapes and reshapes their lives.
[01:05:21.380 --> 01:05:23.340]   I think it's gonna be very useful to my audience.
[01:05:23.340 --> 01:05:24.780]   So thank you again for coming on.
[01:05:24.780 --> 01:05:25.620]   - Thanks, Cal.
[01:05:25.620 --> 01:05:26.620]   And thank you for the work that you're doing.
[01:05:26.620 --> 01:05:28.300]   It's really enriched me an awful lot.
[01:05:28.300 --> 01:05:30.740]   I mean, the systems thinking for my own life.
[01:05:30.740 --> 01:05:32.300]   When I see somebody who thinks the same way
[01:05:32.300 --> 01:05:34.620]   and has thought more deeply, even about those details,
[01:05:34.620 --> 01:05:35.560]   it's been really helpful.
[01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:36.980]   So that's the reason you've got a big audience
[01:05:36.980 --> 01:05:37.900]   that includes me.
[01:05:37.900 --> 01:05:38.740]   - There we go.
[01:05:38.740 --> 01:05:39.740]   We feel seen.
[01:05:39.740 --> 01:05:40.860]   All right, thanks, Arthur.
[01:05:40.860 --> 01:05:42.380]   - Thanks.
[01:05:42.380 --> 01:05:44.460]   - All right, so that was my conversation with Arthur Brooks.
[01:05:44.460 --> 01:05:46.580]   I thought that was fantastic.
[01:05:46.580 --> 01:05:47.420]   Learned a lot.
[01:05:47.420 --> 01:05:48.980]   Interesting guy.
[01:05:48.980 --> 01:05:50.660]   Really interesting, thoughtful guy,
[01:05:50.660 --> 01:05:52.260]   the way that he has crafted his life.
[01:05:52.260 --> 01:05:56.560]   And I particularly appreciated that little detail, Jesse,
[01:05:56.560 --> 01:05:58.900]   about him spending time,
[01:05:58.900 --> 01:06:00.820]   the way he wrote that book with Oprah
[01:06:00.820 --> 01:06:03.860]   was to just go live in her guest house in Montecito.
[01:06:03.860 --> 01:06:06.580]   You got to find a way to coauthor a book with Oprah.
[01:06:06.580 --> 01:06:07.700]   That just sounds awesome.
[01:06:07.700 --> 01:06:08.540]   - Yeah.
[01:06:08.540 --> 01:06:10.580]   - Just a lot of like cozier sheets
[01:06:10.580 --> 01:06:12.820]   and good smelling candles.
[01:06:12.820 --> 01:06:14.220]   That'd just be fantastic.
[01:06:14.220 --> 01:06:16.020]   - Lots of places to read and do deep work.
[01:06:16.020 --> 01:06:17.260]   - Exactly.
[01:06:17.260 --> 01:06:18.100]   I love it.
[01:06:18.100 --> 01:06:20.980]   Just be like me and Stedman just reading books.
[01:06:20.980 --> 01:06:23.420]   That's all I know about Oprah.
[01:06:23.420 --> 01:06:25.020]   Dr. Phil comes by every once in a while
[01:06:25.020 --> 01:06:25.940]   and we just like chat.
[01:06:25.940 --> 01:06:26.780]   - Yeah.
[01:06:27.060 --> 01:06:31.220]   - All my Oprah knowledge is from circa 2004, basically.
[01:06:31.220 --> 01:06:33.940]   Anyways, thank you, Arthur, for coming on the show.
[01:06:33.940 --> 01:06:37.700]   Definitely check out his new book, "Build the Life You Want."
[01:06:37.700 --> 01:06:40.400]   So we have a third segment here in honor of the holidays
[01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:42.140]   and in honor of Oprah.
[01:06:42.140 --> 01:06:45.380]   My list of my favorite completely unnecessary
[01:06:45.380 --> 01:06:49.060]   and embarrassingly geeky things of 2023.
[01:06:49.060 --> 01:06:50.940]   First, let me just mention one other sponsor
[01:06:50.940 --> 01:06:52.380]   that helped make this show possible.
[01:06:52.380 --> 01:06:55.220]   That's our friends at Roan.
[01:06:55.220 --> 01:06:56.060]   Here's the thing.
[01:06:56.060 --> 01:06:58.660]   When closets were due for a radical reinvention
[01:06:58.660 --> 01:07:00.580]   and Roan stepped up to the challenge,
[01:07:00.580 --> 01:07:03.460]   Roan's commuter collection is the most comfortable,
[01:07:03.460 --> 01:07:07.980]   breathable, and flexible set of products known to man.
[01:07:07.980 --> 01:07:09.260]   Here's why.
[01:07:09.260 --> 01:07:11.580]   They have products for every occasion.
[01:07:11.580 --> 01:07:13.860]   Their commuter collection has comfortable pants,
[01:07:13.860 --> 01:07:17.260]   dress shirts, quarter zips, and polos.
[01:07:17.260 --> 01:07:20.020]   So you never have to worry about what to wear
[01:07:20.020 --> 01:07:21.800]   when you have the Roan commuter collection.
[01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:23.260]   They have four-way stretch fabric
[01:07:23.260 --> 01:07:26.180]   that provides breathability and flexibility,
[01:07:26.180 --> 01:07:28.060]   leaves you free to enjoy whatever life throws your way
[01:07:28.060 --> 01:07:31.180]   from your commute to work to playing 18 holes of golf.
[01:07:31.180 --> 01:07:32.980]   It has wrinkle release technology
[01:07:32.980 --> 01:07:36.260]   so the wrinkles disappear as you wear them,
[01:07:36.260 --> 01:07:39.340]   as well as gold fusion anti-odor technology.
[01:07:39.340 --> 01:07:40.680]   I like the commuter collection,
[01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:43.780]   especially the shirts I have because they're lightweight.
[01:07:43.780 --> 01:07:46.680]   So if you're at a conference where you're giving talks
[01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:48.900]   and socializing, you're just on the move,
[01:07:48.900 --> 01:07:50.980]   you're under hot lights, you don't overheat,
[01:07:50.980 --> 01:07:53.180]   and you can travel with this.
[01:07:53.180 --> 01:07:54.220]   You can travel with this collection
[01:07:54.220 --> 01:07:55.980]   'cause the wrinkles fall out.
[01:07:55.980 --> 01:07:57.860]   So it's not like an old-fashioned cotton shirt
[01:07:57.860 --> 01:08:01.100]   where it gets scrunched up in your bag and it looks bad.
[01:08:01.100 --> 01:08:03.420]   It's fantastic, a fantastic solution
[01:08:03.420 --> 01:08:05.380]   for those who wanna look good, not overheat,
[01:08:05.380 --> 01:08:08.620]   not have wrinkles, can't recommend it enough.
[01:08:08.620 --> 01:08:10.700]   So the commuter collection can get you through any workday
[01:08:10.700 --> 01:08:12.540]   and straight into whatever comes next.
[01:08:12.540 --> 01:08:16.520]   Head to roan.com/cal and use that promo code CAL
[01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:19.060]   to save 20% off your entire order.
[01:08:19.060 --> 01:08:20.860]   That's 20% off your entire order
[01:08:20.860 --> 01:08:25.620]   when you head to r-o-n-e.com/cal
[01:08:25.620 --> 01:08:27.420]   and use the code CAL.
[01:08:27.420 --> 01:08:30.640]   It's time to find your corner office comfort.
[01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:33.820]   All right, Jesse, here we go.
[01:08:33.820 --> 01:08:35.660]   My favorite completely unnecessarily
[01:08:35.660 --> 01:08:39.420]   and embarrassingly geeky things from 2023.
[01:08:39.420 --> 01:08:41.700]   So the idea here is instead of talking about common sense
[01:08:41.700 --> 01:08:44.340]   or useful things that most normal human beings would say,
[01:08:44.340 --> 01:08:46.180]   this makes sense and I should have this,
[01:08:46.180 --> 01:08:48.740]   I wanna talk about the weird,
[01:08:48.740 --> 01:08:50.980]   the weird, almost embarrassingly geeky things
[01:08:50.980 --> 01:08:55.260]   that I really buy that are unnecessary and I grow to love.
[01:08:55.260 --> 01:08:56.740]   The type of things I talk about
[01:08:56.740 --> 01:09:00.300]   on my classic deep or crazy segment where I asked Jesse,
[01:09:00.300 --> 01:09:02.300]   was this deep that I bought this
[01:09:02.300 --> 01:09:04.300]   or does it make me a madman?
[01:09:04.300 --> 01:09:06.700]   And so I figured there's six of you in the audience
[01:09:06.700 --> 01:09:11.360]   that are gonna actually resonate with these suggestions,
[01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:12.200]   but that's good.
[01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:14.540]   We need to celebrate the idiosyncratic and geeky.
[01:09:14.540 --> 01:09:17.460]   We have to celebrate sometimes going all in
[01:09:17.460 --> 01:09:20.020]   on getting deep in ways that's entirely superfluous.
[01:09:20.020 --> 01:09:21.780]   All right, so I have five things, Jesse,
[01:09:21.780 --> 01:09:22.900]   and I have them all with me.
[01:09:22.900 --> 01:09:23.740]   - Yes.
[01:09:23.740 --> 01:09:24.580]   - So if you are listening,
[01:09:24.580 --> 01:09:27.260]   you might wanna go check out the video here.
[01:09:27.260 --> 01:09:29.860]   You go to thedeeplife.com/listen,
[01:09:29.860 --> 01:09:31.700]   look for episode 280.
[01:09:31.700 --> 01:09:34.460]   At the bottom, there'll be the videos from the episode.
[01:09:34.460 --> 01:09:35.460]   You can get the video for the whole thing.
[01:09:35.460 --> 01:09:36.740]   You see me talk to Arthur, but come on,
[01:09:36.740 --> 01:09:38.580]   this is the main thing you wanna see.
[01:09:38.580 --> 01:09:41.620]   I will show off my five completely unnecessary,
[01:09:41.620 --> 01:09:42.460]   embarrassingly geeky things.
[01:09:42.460 --> 01:09:44.380]   All right, number one, I'm gonna go grab this.
[01:09:46.780 --> 01:09:51.100]   This is my Unnecessary Hipster Keyboard.
[01:09:51.100 --> 01:09:55.540]   This is by Nufi, N-U-P-H-Y.
[01:09:55.540 --> 01:09:56.740]   Gotta look up the title here.
[01:09:56.740 --> 01:09:58.540]   Let me hold it up so you can see it.
[01:09:58.540 --> 01:10:05.420]   This is a Nufi Air 78, Air 75.
[01:10:05.420 --> 01:10:09.240]   What this is is a mechanical keyboard.
[01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:13.120]   So the keys actually have a physical switch with a spring.
[01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:16.920]   So you press it down and the spring pushes it back up again.
[01:10:16.920 --> 01:10:19.320]   This is what keyboards used to be like
[01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:22.300]   until Apple and others introduced
[01:10:22.300 --> 01:10:24.720]   these membrane-based keyboards where you press down,
[01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:26.880]   it's just squeezing rubber and making a connection.
[01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:29.120]   These are the old-fashioned clickety clacks.
[01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:30.920]   I'll do some by the microphone here.
[01:10:30.920 --> 01:10:34.680]   Clickety clack keyboard.
[01:10:34.680 --> 01:10:36.480]   You can type much faster on these
[01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:38.680]   because you get a return on the finger.
[01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:41.140]   So you press down and it pushes your finger back up
[01:10:41.140 --> 01:10:43.460]   so you can move it and get to the next key faster
[01:10:43.460 --> 01:10:45.460]   without having to pull it up as quickly.
[01:10:45.460 --> 01:10:49.120]   I got this in part because the problem,
[01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:50.140]   we've talked about this before,
[01:10:50.140 --> 01:10:52.400]   but the problem with the current generation
[01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:54.820]   of MacBook Airs is they switch to a cheaper plastic
[01:10:54.820 --> 01:10:56.740]   on the keyboard and I wore away,
[01:10:56.740 --> 01:10:59.420]   I wore away all of the numbers
[01:10:59.420 --> 01:11:01.820]   and all the letters on my keyboard.
[01:11:01.820 --> 01:11:03.060]   And it really frustrated me.
[01:11:03.060 --> 01:11:04.300]   So I wanted a better keyboard.
[01:11:04.300 --> 01:11:06.020]   This is really high quality plastic.
[01:11:06.020 --> 01:11:07.300]   It's not gonna wear away.
[01:11:07.300 --> 01:11:09.580]   I spend so much time writing
[01:11:09.580 --> 01:11:11.540]   and not just casually writing like emails,
[01:11:11.540 --> 01:11:14.020]   but hard writing like New Yorker articles
[01:11:14.020 --> 01:11:16.180]   or chapters for my books or my newsletter.
[01:11:16.180 --> 01:11:19.380]   And I don't know, it completely unnecessary,
[01:11:19.380 --> 01:11:22.920]   but I feel much more definitive when I'm typing on this.
[01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:25.140]   Like I'm thinking harder.
[01:11:25.140 --> 01:11:26.260]   I don't know, I love it.
[01:11:26.260 --> 01:11:29.380]   Completely unnecessary, my hipster keyboard.
[01:11:29.380 --> 01:11:31.980]   - Did you have color options for that?
[01:11:31.980 --> 01:11:35.220]   - It comes with, this is the color options it comes with.
[01:11:35.220 --> 01:11:37.480]   It also has cool lights that come on when you type.
[01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:39.500]   You can replace any key on this though.
[01:11:39.500 --> 01:11:41.100]   So it comes with a tool.
[01:11:41.100 --> 01:11:43.420]   You can pop the key case caps off
[01:11:43.420 --> 01:11:44.780]   and put any key caps you want.
[01:11:44.780 --> 01:11:46.560]   They snap back onto the switch.
[01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:48.860]   So people super customize these
[01:11:48.860 --> 01:11:50.380]   and you can replace these over time.
[01:11:50.380 --> 01:11:51.220]   I love it, I don't know.
[01:11:51.220 --> 01:11:52.800]   I really like typing on it.
[01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:53.640]   All right.
[01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:57.740]   Number two from 2023.
[01:11:57.740 --> 01:11:59.100]   We've talked about this on the show before,
[01:11:59.100 --> 01:12:00.380]   but I will show it off.
[01:12:00.380 --> 01:12:04.880]   My Remarkable 2 digital notebook.
[01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:09.300]   All right, so this is a, it's a notebook,
[01:12:09.300 --> 01:12:13.420]   but it uses the same sort of e-ink technology
[01:12:13.420 --> 01:12:16.940]   that you might see on a Kindle.
[01:12:16.940 --> 01:12:18.700]   So I'll show this for those who are watching.
[01:12:18.700 --> 01:12:20.940]   Let me do something thicker here.
[01:12:20.940 --> 01:12:24.520]   So you write on this and as you write,
[01:12:24.520 --> 01:12:30.260]   it shows up on the screen like you're writing on paper.
[01:12:30.260 --> 01:12:32.480]   It has, they've really worked on the feel of it
[01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:36.420]   so that it does have the same drag more or less like paper.
[01:12:36.420 --> 01:12:38.740]   So it has a very paper-like feel.
[01:12:38.740 --> 01:12:40.980]   You can create endless notebooks on here,
[01:12:40.980 --> 01:12:42.780]   endless pages, endless notebooks,
[01:12:42.780 --> 01:12:45.260]   and the whole thing is constantly syncing with the cloud.
[01:12:45.260 --> 01:12:47.660]   So everything in here is available online.
[01:12:47.660 --> 01:12:49.060]   You're not gonna lose it.
[01:12:49.060 --> 01:12:53.240]   So it's like having a stack of 20 notebooks with you
[01:12:53.240 --> 01:12:55.900]   just in this package, wherever you go.
[01:12:55.900 --> 01:12:57.340]   I have used this as a replacement
[01:12:57.340 --> 01:12:59.960]   for basically all of the notebooks I use
[01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:01.620]   for keeping track of ideas
[01:13:01.620 --> 01:13:03.540]   or scratch paper for working on ideas.
[01:13:03.540 --> 01:13:06.460]   I think I have well over a dozen virtual notebooks
[01:13:06.460 --> 01:13:09.340]   stored in here right now.
[01:13:09.340 --> 01:13:11.540]   So some of these will be idea notebooks.
[01:13:11.540 --> 01:13:13.380]   I'm working on an article or a book
[01:13:13.380 --> 01:13:15.500]   and I just wanna have a place to keep ideas.
[01:13:15.500 --> 01:13:18.420]   Some of these are my computer science-related notebooks
[01:13:18.420 --> 01:13:19.900]   where I'll actually work out math
[01:13:19.900 --> 01:13:21.500]   if I'm working on a theory paper.
[01:13:21.500 --> 01:13:22.620]   There's a place for me to store
[01:13:22.620 --> 01:13:24.660]   and always go back and find that math.
[01:13:24.660 --> 01:13:27.540]   I can and I have just gone into the cloud,
[01:13:27.540 --> 01:13:29.940]   grabbed sheets from some of these notebooks
[01:13:29.940 --> 01:13:32.980]   as PDFs and sent them to collaborators.
[01:13:32.980 --> 01:13:35.180]   Oh, look, this is what I was talking about.
[01:13:35.180 --> 01:13:36.620]   I also use this for a lot of planning,
[01:13:36.620 --> 01:13:39.140]   a lot of the planning for my media company,
[01:13:39.140 --> 01:13:41.380]   strategy, ideas.
[01:13:41.380 --> 01:13:44.780]   I've replaced my Moleskine where I used to keep ideas
[01:13:44.780 --> 01:13:46.460]   about just living a deep life more generally
[01:13:46.460 --> 01:13:48.440]   that now exist in here virtually.
[01:13:48.440 --> 01:13:51.180]   I've been using this for a while now and I really like it.
[01:13:51.180 --> 01:13:52.980]   I like the experience of writing on here.
[01:13:52.980 --> 01:13:55.280]   I like having all my notebooks in one place.
[01:13:55.280 --> 01:13:57.860]   I otherwise was using too many notebooks.
[01:13:57.860 --> 01:14:00.940]   Now I say this is under my completely unnecessary
[01:14:00.940 --> 01:14:02.780]   and embarrassingly geeky list
[01:14:02.780 --> 01:14:04.260]   because it's really kind of expensive.
[01:14:04.260 --> 01:14:07.740]   I mean, it doesn't really make sense for most people.
[01:14:07.740 --> 01:14:09.820]   By the time you get the tablet,
[01:14:09.820 --> 01:14:12.740]   you get the cover, you get the advanced,
[01:14:12.740 --> 01:14:14.220]   you have to pay more for the stylus
[01:14:14.220 --> 01:14:16.020]   that has an eraser built on.
[01:14:16.020 --> 01:14:19.660]   This was $500 easy, all in,
[01:14:19.660 --> 01:14:21.860]   which is pretty crazy for a notebook.
[01:14:21.860 --> 01:14:23.860]   For someone like me, yeah, why not?
[01:14:23.860 --> 01:14:26.860]   Because my whole life is ideas and technology
[01:14:26.860 --> 01:14:28.820]   and it's cool and I'm a first mover.
[01:14:28.820 --> 01:14:30.220]   I don't know if I can really recommend it
[01:14:30.220 --> 01:14:31.780]   unless you just have that money lying around,
[01:14:31.780 --> 01:14:35.140]   but I've really enjoyed my Remarkable 2 experience.
[01:14:35.140 --> 01:14:38.260]   All right, as we move down this list, by the way, Jesse,
[01:14:38.260 --> 01:14:40.860]   things are gonna get increasingly geeky
[01:14:40.860 --> 01:14:43.100]   and increasingly less relevant to people.
[01:14:43.100 --> 01:14:45.020]   That's the way this is gonna work.
[01:14:45.020 --> 01:14:46.260]   So be prepared.
[01:14:46.260 --> 01:14:48.260]   If you already find yourself a little bit alienated,
[01:14:48.260 --> 01:14:49.460]   this is gonna get worse.
[01:14:49.460 --> 01:14:56.620]   All right, I wanna show my third
[01:14:56.620 --> 01:14:59.860]   favorite unnecessary and geeky thing from last year.
[01:14:59.860 --> 01:15:00.680]   I'm holding it up here.
[01:15:00.680 --> 01:15:03.580]   This is a Shure MV7 microphone.
[01:15:03.580 --> 01:15:08.100]   This is fantastic for anyone
[01:15:08.100 --> 01:15:10.540]   who wants to get into the audio game.
[01:15:10.540 --> 01:15:13.100]   So let's say you wanna start a podcast
[01:15:13.100 --> 01:15:15.300]   or you just wanna sound better
[01:15:15.300 --> 01:15:17.300]   when you are on Zoom meetings
[01:15:17.300 --> 01:15:19.860]   or maybe you're a guest on some podcast.
[01:15:19.860 --> 01:15:21.300]   What Shure has done here
[01:15:21.300 --> 01:15:23.700]   is taken a lot of the same hardware
[01:15:23.700 --> 01:15:27.340]   that you have in the classic Shure microphones.
[01:15:27.340 --> 01:15:29.060]   I don't know, what are these called?
[01:15:29.060 --> 01:15:30.840]   The SM7s, what are they?
[01:15:30.840 --> 01:15:32.400]   It's on there somewhere, Jesse.
[01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:35.400]   - Yeah, SM7B.
[01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:37.520]   - SM7B, so this is like the classic microphone.
[01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:39.120]   A lot of podcasters use this.
[01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:42.160]   It was also, it's used in the music industry.
[01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:44.040]   I think the Michael Jackson's "Thriller" album
[01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:45.360]   was recorded on these.
[01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:48.440]   It has a lot of those same actual hardwares,
[01:15:48.440 --> 01:15:50.480]   but what it also has built into it
[01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:54.080]   is all of the digital electronics
[01:15:55.160 --> 01:15:59.620]   to convert the analog signal to a digital signal
[01:15:59.620 --> 01:16:01.300]   and to do some mixing on it.
[01:16:01.300 --> 01:16:03.540]   You can have the volume on here.
[01:16:03.540 --> 01:16:06.540]   And so what comes out of here on the other end
[01:16:06.540 --> 01:16:07.640]   is a USB cable.
[01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:10.260]   So it does all the digitization
[01:16:10.260 --> 01:16:11.740]   inside the microphone itself.
[01:16:11.740 --> 01:16:13.940]   So you can then plug this into any laptop
[01:16:13.940 --> 01:16:17.260]   as any other sort of external USB microphone,
[01:16:17.260 --> 01:16:20.920]   getting a lot of the sound quality you would have
[01:16:20.920 --> 01:16:22.460]   from a high-end Shure mic
[01:16:22.460 --> 01:16:26.080]   without needing an extra mixing board to take that signal
[01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:26.920]   and make it something
[01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:29.200]   that the computer itself can understand.
[01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:30.120]   The other thing it has,
[01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:32.720]   which I really would have appreciated early in podcasting
[01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:35.360]   is a monitor headphone output
[01:16:35.360 --> 01:16:40.000]   so that you can hear yourself in your ears.
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.320]   You can hear other sound in your ears.
[01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:44.720]   This was a real problem I had early in podcasting
[01:16:44.720 --> 01:16:46.680]   was figuring out how to get monitoring
[01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:48.280]   so I could hear myself in my ears.
[01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:49.960]   You get that automatically for here.
[01:16:49.960 --> 01:16:51.540]   It mixes what you're saying
[01:16:51.540 --> 01:16:53.660]   with the audio coming back from the computer.
[01:16:53.660 --> 01:16:55.480]   So if you're hooked up to Zoom,
[01:16:55.480 --> 01:16:58.540]   you can just select this microphone as your speakers.
[01:16:58.540 --> 01:17:00.820]   And so you can hear audio from your computer.
[01:17:00.820 --> 01:17:02.780]   You can hear yourself mixed in.
[01:17:02.780 --> 01:17:04.140]   So you hear what your levels are.
[01:17:04.140 --> 01:17:05.380]   Anyways, this is a fantastic way
[01:17:05.380 --> 01:17:06.660]   to get into higher-end audio
[01:17:06.660 --> 01:17:08.420]   without needing any other equipment,
[01:17:08.420 --> 01:17:10.660]   this straight to your computer.
[01:17:10.660 --> 01:17:12.940]   As people may or may not know,
[01:17:12.940 --> 01:17:14.460]   otherwise things do get complicated.
[01:17:14.460 --> 01:17:15.980]   So like here in our DeepWork HQ,
[01:17:15.980 --> 01:17:17.460]   this is just a classic microphone.
[01:17:17.460 --> 01:17:20.800]   It just has an analog signal coming out of here.
[01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:22.280]   So this goes, Jesse and I,
[01:17:22.280 --> 01:17:23.860]   we both have our mics have to go
[01:17:23.860 --> 01:17:27.280]   into a large standalone audio processor,
[01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:29.940]   which takes that signal and conditions it
[01:17:29.940 --> 01:17:31.480]   and does some compression on it
[01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:33.660]   and works with the EQ mix.
[01:17:33.660 --> 01:17:35.880]   And we had to have an audio engineer set this up.
[01:17:35.880 --> 01:17:37.120]   That signal then goes
[01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:40.600]   into a relatively complicated mixing board.
[01:17:40.600 --> 01:17:41.960]   So I'm in that mixing board,
[01:17:41.960 --> 01:17:43.120]   Jesse's in that mixing board,
[01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:44.720]   our sound effects are in that mixing board,
[01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:45.960]   the calls are in the mixing board,
[01:17:45.960 --> 01:17:46.920]   and that's all set up.
[01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:50.600]   And then that mixing board creates finally a digital signal,
[01:17:50.600 --> 01:17:53.200]   which is what goes to our computer
[01:17:53.200 --> 01:17:55.240]   that we can then use to record multi-tracked
[01:17:55.240 --> 01:17:56.220]   on the computers.
[01:17:56.220 --> 01:17:57.760]   This replaces all of that equipment.
[01:17:57.760 --> 01:17:59.320]   That's not gonna be as good quality.
[01:17:59.320 --> 01:18:02.500]   I mean, obviously having professional audio processors
[01:18:02.500 --> 01:18:04.160]   with gating and compression
[01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:05.640]   and going through a high-end mixing board
[01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:07.140]   where we're tweaking the HQs,
[01:18:07.140 --> 01:18:08.720]   this is gonna sound a little bit better,
[01:18:08.720 --> 01:18:09.760]   but the gap is not big.
[01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:11.600]   So if you wanna have really good sounding audio,
[01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:14.200]   I think this is just a really great invention.
[01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:16.920]   The MV7, for the price of one of these microphones,
[01:18:16.920 --> 01:18:19.360]   you have a whole setup.
[01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:22.240]   So I think this made podcasting accessible.
[01:18:22.240 --> 01:18:23.080]   - Yeah.
[01:18:23.080 --> 01:18:25.020]   - Like good sounding podcasting accessible
[01:18:25.020 --> 01:18:27.120]   to a lot more people.
[01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:30.920]   It makes the cost of that from $700
[01:18:30.920 --> 01:18:33.760]   to get started down to 250.
[01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:34.760]   So anyways, I love this thing.
[01:18:34.760 --> 01:18:36.480]   I use it for all my Zoom calls.
[01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:39.360]   I use it when I give virtual talks
[01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:41.200]   because it looks weird to have this whole thing
[01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:42.960]   when you're giving a talk to a business.
[01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:45.860]   So I just use this and the audio is,
[01:18:45.860 --> 01:18:47.660]   you know, no one notices the difference.
[01:18:47.660 --> 01:18:51.480]   All right, let's get even more esoteric, Jesse.
[01:18:51.480 --> 01:18:53.020]   Let me grab my next thing here.
[01:18:53.020 --> 01:19:00.900]   We're gonna have people running to grab this off the shelves.
[01:19:00.900 --> 01:19:05.720]   This here is a mount
[01:19:05.720 --> 01:19:09.340]   for an Arduino Nano microcontroller.
[01:19:09.340 --> 01:19:11.800]   So, you know, I like to build microelectronics.
[01:19:11.800 --> 01:19:13.340]   I do sometimes with my kids.
[01:19:13.340 --> 01:19:16.040]   Next door to the studio, I have a maker studio,
[01:19:16.040 --> 01:19:16.880]   I have a maker lab
[01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:19.860]   where I have a lot of my microelectronics stuff.
[01:19:19.860 --> 01:19:22.240]   This year I was building a custom light controller
[01:19:22.240 --> 01:19:23.240]   for Halloween lights.
[01:19:23.240 --> 01:19:25.480]   I wanted to control addressable LEDs
[01:19:25.480 --> 01:19:26.800]   using my own custom code.
[01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:29.200]   So I had to build a waterproofed controller
[01:19:29.200 --> 01:19:31.440]   and I was running it off of a microprocessor.
[01:19:31.440 --> 01:19:34.880]   It's hard to build stable circuits on microprocessors.
[01:19:34.880 --> 01:19:36.640]   You have all these, you know,
[01:19:36.640 --> 01:19:38.620]   how do you connect all the different cables to them
[01:19:38.620 --> 01:19:40.560]   in a way that is going to be stable
[01:19:40.560 --> 01:19:42.960]   in the sense that you can move around the whole apparatus
[01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:44.520]   and it's not gonna fall apart.
[01:19:44.520 --> 01:19:47.320]   You don't wanna just put a breadboard in a waterproof box.
[01:19:47.320 --> 01:19:51.480]   So I came across these great mounts for Arduino Nanos.
[01:19:51.480 --> 01:19:52.760]   I have a whole box of Nanos.
[01:19:52.760 --> 01:19:54.700]   You can get them sort of cheap knockoffs
[01:19:54.700 --> 01:19:56.920]   for like eight bucks a pop.
[01:19:56.920 --> 01:19:59.680]   And what you can do is stick the Nano
[01:19:59.680 --> 01:20:01.840]   into these connectors inside
[01:20:01.840 --> 01:20:05.080]   and this breaks out every one of the connections
[01:20:05.080 --> 01:20:09.040]   to the Nano with a screw block
[01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:10.960]   where you can just put a wire end in here
[01:20:10.960 --> 01:20:14.020]   and then screw down the bolt in the wire.
[01:20:14.020 --> 01:20:18.040]   So you don't have to solder your microcontroller
[01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:19.820]   into some sort of proto board
[01:20:19.820 --> 01:20:21.240]   where now it's permanently in there
[01:20:21.240 --> 01:20:22.200]   and permanently soldered
[01:20:22.200 --> 01:20:23.960]   to all the different wires you wanna use.
[01:20:23.960 --> 01:20:25.860]   You can get almost as stable as a connection
[01:20:25.860 --> 01:20:27.360]   just screwing them into the screw mount.
[01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:28.920]   You can just tape or glue this mount
[01:20:28.920 --> 01:20:32.360]   onto whatever your object is you're building,
[01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:34.320]   but you can take that processor right out of here
[01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:35.760]   and use it for something else.
[01:20:35.760 --> 01:20:37.080]   And if you need to switch around the wiring,
[01:20:37.080 --> 01:20:38.400]   you can just unscrew it and switch it around.
[01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:40.520]   So this has been useful for my projects.
[01:20:40.520 --> 01:20:41.780]   I don't even know what it's called.
[01:20:41.780 --> 01:20:44.120]   I just found this probably on Amazon,
[01:20:44.120 --> 01:20:44.960]   but it's easy to-
[01:20:44.960 --> 01:20:47.200]   - Were you soldering this stuff before?
[01:20:47.200 --> 01:20:48.920]   - Or I would just have it in like a breadboard or something
[01:20:48.920 --> 01:20:50.280]   and it would all come out.
[01:20:50.280 --> 01:20:52.040]   This was the first time I needed one of my projects
[01:20:52.040 --> 01:20:53.440]   to be deployed in the wild, right?
[01:20:53.440 --> 01:20:55.160]   I'd like bring this home and set it up
[01:20:55.160 --> 01:20:57.880]   and be able to move it around and reprogram it in this.
[01:20:57.880 --> 01:20:58.740]   And it worked.
[01:20:58.740 --> 01:21:01.460]   My light controller stayed functional
[01:21:01.460 --> 01:21:04.080]   for the entire Halloween season.
[01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:05.200]   All right, speaking of lights,
[01:21:05.200 --> 01:21:07.080]   this is my final completely unnecessary
[01:21:07.080 --> 01:21:09.440]   and embarrassingly geeky thing from 2003.
[01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:13.320]   I don't actually have the thing
[01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:15.080]   'cause it's in use right now,
[01:21:15.080 --> 01:21:18.120]   but this is my BNLink six outlet,
[01:21:18.120 --> 01:21:21.120]   seven day digital timer stake with six foot cord.
[01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:26.520]   So I really like lighting displays for,
[01:21:26.520 --> 01:21:28.280]   we have like a winter wonderland display right now
[01:21:28.280 --> 01:21:29.480]   for the holiday season.
[01:21:29.480 --> 01:21:30.980]   We had a Halloween display.
[01:21:30.980 --> 01:21:36.140]   Until this year, I would run my displays
[01:21:36.140 --> 01:21:36.980]   and they're complicated.
[01:21:36.980 --> 01:21:38.640]   I did the counts and by the way,
[01:21:38.640 --> 01:21:41.180]   all my plans for the displays are on my remarkable.
[01:21:41.180 --> 01:21:42.520]   There's a notebook for it.
[01:21:42.520 --> 01:21:46.120]   I did the count and I think I have like 25,
[01:21:46.120 --> 01:21:48.520]   in the current display, like 25 different wiring elements.
[01:21:48.520 --> 01:21:53.520]   So wires, splitters, adapters, 25 different elements.
[01:21:53.520 --> 01:21:57.360]   We live on a corner, so we have a lot of frontage
[01:21:57.360 --> 01:22:01.120]   and I'd like to have a light coverage for everything.
[01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:02.680]   And I like the lights to come on automatically,
[01:22:02.680 --> 01:22:03.600]   come off automatically.
[01:22:03.600 --> 01:22:05.880]   So before I had two separate circuits
[01:22:05.880 --> 01:22:10.300]   and each of the circuits was led through a light sensor
[01:22:10.300 --> 01:22:11.700]   that could see when it got dark
[01:22:11.700 --> 01:22:14.100]   and then would have a timer for how long to stay on
[01:22:14.100 --> 01:22:15.580]   after it got dark.
[01:22:15.580 --> 01:22:18.780]   But this was crude because it was only intervals
[01:22:18.780 --> 01:22:21.680]   of two hours and the sensors would come on
[01:22:21.680 --> 01:22:23.320]   at different times depending on exactly
[01:22:23.320 --> 01:22:24.460]   where they were in the yard
[01:22:24.460 --> 01:22:26.300]   because when they would detect it's dark is different.
[01:22:26.300 --> 01:22:27.180]   Like if you're in shade,
[01:22:27.180 --> 01:22:29.900]   it might be a little bit earlier than if you're not.
[01:22:29.900 --> 01:22:33.820]   And so I finally got a more higher end controller
[01:22:33.820 --> 01:22:36.960]   for all of my circuits for my light displays
[01:22:36.960 --> 01:22:41.800]   where you have a fully functional digital interface,
[01:22:41.800 --> 01:22:43.040]   self-contained, right?
[01:22:43.040 --> 01:22:44.480]   So none of this like connecting to a phone,
[01:22:44.480 --> 01:22:46.160]   Bluetooth nonsense.
[01:22:46.160 --> 01:22:49.920]   Self-contained digital timer that controls all these relays.
[01:22:49.920 --> 01:22:53.360]   So now I can exactly program
[01:22:53.360 --> 01:22:55.640]   when I want the circuits to go on,
[01:22:55.640 --> 01:22:57.240]   when I want them to turn off,
[01:22:57.240 --> 01:22:59.500]   this time on, this time off, back on at this time,
[01:22:59.500 --> 01:23:01.160]   back off on that time, different days of the week,
[01:23:01.160 --> 01:23:02.560]   I can do it differently.
[01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:03.400]   This really made a difference.
[01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:04.960]   I now finally have full control
[01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:06.520]   over exactly when my lights go on
[01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:08.280]   and exactly where my lights go off.
[01:23:08.280 --> 01:23:11.960]   Nice waterproof box staked up off the ground.
[01:23:11.960 --> 01:23:14.140]   So completely unnecessary, Jesse,
[01:23:14.140 --> 01:23:16.160]   and embarrassingly geeky,
[01:23:16.160 --> 01:23:18.400]   but also one of my favorite things from the last year.
[01:23:18.400 --> 01:23:19.580]   - Does anybody have better lights
[01:23:19.580 --> 01:23:20.980]   than you in the neighborhood?
[01:23:20.980 --> 01:23:24.440]   - Yes, there's some good lights.
[01:23:24.440 --> 01:23:27.000]   There's some good lights in the neighborhood.
[01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.040]   I think Halloween, see the thing about Halloween
[01:23:29.040 --> 01:23:31.320]   without giving too much away is that we have more,
[01:23:31.320 --> 01:23:33.320]   we have a narrative to our lights
[01:23:33.320 --> 01:23:35.320]   with actual text that you read.
[01:23:35.320 --> 01:23:37.360]   So no one else is doing that.
[01:23:37.360 --> 01:23:38.680]   Because we have so much frontage,
[01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:40.600]   we bring you on a Halloween journey.
[01:23:40.600 --> 01:23:42.520]   There's a sort of a story that unfolds
[01:23:42.520 --> 01:23:44.520]   with different vignettes.
[01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:48.000]   For the holiday lights, I have more work to do.
[01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:49.200]   Yeah, so people have some good holidays.
[01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:50.600]   - So you're still working on it.
[01:23:50.600 --> 01:23:53.920]   - I think next year I have some key upgrades.
[01:23:53.920 --> 01:23:55.840]   I definitely have some key upgrades in mind for next year
[01:23:55.840 --> 01:23:58.400]   that I'll have to write down in my remarkable.
[01:23:58.400 --> 01:24:00.320]   Maybe I should have had my programmable,
[01:24:00.320 --> 01:24:02.840]   or here's my sixth thing I'll add to here.
[01:24:02.840 --> 01:24:05.920]   The programmable LEDs I started buying, they're so cool.
[01:24:05.920 --> 01:24:07.680]   You can control every single bulb
[01:24:07.680 --> 01:24:09.240]   on these long Christmas light stands
[01:24:09.240 --> 01:24:12.040]   from a microcontroller and make them do whatever you want.
[01:24:12.040 --> 01:24:13.600]   So I had like really cool alien lights
[01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:15.760]   that I was using for our Halloween narrative,
[01:24:15.760 --> 01:24:17.440]   where they were sprinkling.
[01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:20.800]   You see, it was purple and different green lights
[01:24:20.800 --> 01:24:22.280]   would kind of sprinkle in
[01:24:22.280 --> 01:24:23.880]   and there'd be more and more green.
[01:24:23.880 --> 01:24:26.240]   Then there'd be a chase that goes and chases
[01:24:26.240 --> 01:24:27.720]   all the way around and resets it all back
[01:24:27.720 --> 01:24:29.320]   to set it all back.
[01:24:29.320 --> 01:24:31.640]   You can program whatever you want.
[01:24:31.640 --> 01:24:32.880]   It's really cool stuff.
[01:24:32.880 --> 01:24:36.120]   We have a, look, I don't wanna go on a soapbox here,
[01:24:36.120 --> 01:24:37.880]   but I have really strong thoughts,
[01:24:37.880 --> 01:24:41.080]   especially for Christmas lights.
[01:24:41.080 --> 01:24:44.800]   Like what I think is good and what I don't think is good.
[01:24:44.800 --> 01:24:47.880]   My sons know this because we watch this ABC show sometimes
[01:24:47.880 --> 01:24:49.960]   where they have a competition for Christmas lights.
[01:24:49.960 --> 01:24:53.680]   I do not like, I hope I'm not alienating people here.
[01:24:53.680 --> 01:24:57.000]   I do not like this new setup
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:58.960]   where you permanently install
[01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:01.880]   all of these programmable LEDs all over your house
[01:25:01.880 --> 01:25:04.320]   and on all like the windows and doors or what have you.
[01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:05.960]   And then you use this computer software
[01:25:05.960 --> 01:25:07.840]   to synchronize them to music.
[01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:10.720]   And you have the moving head DMX lights on your roof
[01:25:10.720 --> 01:25:12.600]   and it's like a show.
[01:25:12.600 --> 01:25:14.760]   And it always plays that,
[01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:17.800]   whatever that Siberian, Trans-Siberian railroad,
[01:25:17.800 --> 01:25:19.320]   like do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.
[01:25:19.320 --> 01:25:21.120]   And all the lights are doing things
[01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:22.120]   and the headlights are moving.
[01:25:22.120 --> 01:25:23.720]   I don't like that.
[01:25:23.720 --> 01:25:28.720]   I think light should create a transportative experience
[01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:31.160]   as you're like walking nearby the house.
[01:25:31.160 --> 01:25:33.600]   It sort of brings you into a different type
[01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:35.720]   of frame of mind aesthetically.
[01:25:35.720 --> 01:25:37.240]   I don't like the shows.
[01:25:37.240 --> 01:25:38.720]   I think the shows are showy.
[01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:42.240]   I don't wanna see dancing gingerbread men
[01:25:42.240 --> 01:25:43.880]   projection mapped on your house
[01:25:43.880 --> 01:25:45.720]   while music plays or something.
[01:25:45.720 --> 01:25:47.600]   I want, you know, it brings you into like,
[01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:50.240]   oh, I'm now in Santa Claus's village
[01:25:50.240 --> 01:25:51.520]   or something like that.
[01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:53.680]   I have a lot of thoughts about this.
[01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:56.480]   You'll hear about them all in my new podcast in 2024.
[01:25:56.480 --> 01:26:00.240]   Light Talk with Cal Newport.
[01:26:00.240 --> 01:26:04.040]   And we just go deep on decorative lighting.
[01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:07.080]   And it's mainly me just being very cranky
[01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:12.080]   and giving long, somewhat inappropriately profane dialogues
[01:26:12.080 --> 01:26:15.160]   about what I don't like in light displays.
[01:26:15.160 --> 01:26:17.640]   All right, Jesse, that's enough nonsense for now.
[01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:19.440]   People have to get back to their in-laws house
[01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:22.000]   and hear some more annoying conversations
[01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:23.280]   with their relatives.
[01:26:23.280 --> 01:26:25.840]   So thank you everyone for listening.
[01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:28.520]   We'll be back next week with a New Year's
[01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:29.920]   or first episode of 2024.
[01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:30.920]   I'm excited about that.
[01:26:30.920 --> 01:26:32.640]   So definitely be ready to listen to that.
[01:26:32.640 --> 01:26:34.480]   We'll get back to basics.
[01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:36.600]   And until then, as always, stay deep.
[01:26:36.600 --> 01:26:40.520]   Hey, so if you enjoyed my interview with Arthur Brooks
[01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:44.840]   in today's episode, you might also like episode 272
[01:26:44.840 --> 01:26:48.440]   where I did an interview with the writer, David Epstein.
