[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.120]   All right. Gentlemen, just to let the ladies know that you not are short forgetters,
[00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.440]   we're going to go back and do a really quick little quiz real quickly right to get this started,
[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.320]   and then we're going to talk to the ladies.
[00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.480]   This is where the men usually take a lot of copious notes as the women's role.
[00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.200]   But all right, three things you got to remember in order to be a godly husband. Are you ready?
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:30.480]   You got to be a learner, lover, leader.
[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.000]   There we go. Those three things are really key.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.920]   Now, really, I want you to take those and stick those in the back pocket of your memory,
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.800]   and think about those,
[00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.320]   pull those out every now and then,
[00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.520]   say, "How am I doing?
[00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.120]   What's really going on now?"
[00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.320]   Let me talk to the wives at this particular point.
[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.600]   Remember how we said in Genesis chapter 3 and verse 16,
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.120]   when God gave the curse,
[00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.920]   one of the main things that occurred there,
[00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.680]   her desire will be to control and manipulate her husband,
[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.080]   his desire will be to rule over her, is the idea.
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.760]   So now, marriage becomes a game of King of the Hill.
[00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.400]   Now, it becomes the battleground of the sexes in this particular case,
[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.640]   and it's really practicing godly roles,
[00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.000]   Christ-like roles that change and make the difference.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.440]   This is really critical.
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.960]   So what does God say in relationship to his design for women?
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.480]   What is his design for women and what should it be?
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:35.320]   This is an illustration of what some women really think of their husbands.
[00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.160]   Says, "Now, when we last met,
[00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.160]   I asked each of you to bring a list of things,
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.760]   the counselor says that your spouse does that really annoy you."
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.080]   Now, notice how he has a little posty note,
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.440]   and she has a whole stack of papers there.
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:59.600]   Now, the reason why I put that up there is because this is a true story.
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.040]   Back several years ago, I had a couple,
[00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.440]   they'd been married for about 25 years.
[00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.840]   They were having some pretty serious marital problems.
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.800]   They came into counseling.
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.720]   I never knew them, never met them before.
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.600]   I had prayer with them,
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.240]   and as soon as I said amen on the prayer,
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.600]   I looked up and I said,
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.800]   "What seems to be the problem?"
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.340]   The wife reached into a cloth bag that she had,
[00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:31.560]   and she pulled out a ream of paper and laid it in front of me.
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.160]   I started sifting through the paper,
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:46.000]   and here typed out single space was every wrong thing that her husband had ever done.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.200]   She had kept record for 25 years,
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.680]   and she pointed to it,
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.200]   and she said to me,
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.520]   "This is the reason we're having problems."
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.040]   I thumbed through it a little bit,
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.960]   and I looked at her and I said,
[00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.320]   "You're right.
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.040]   This is the reason you're having problems."
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.520]   But I didn't mean it the same way as she did.
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:20.400]   I said to her, "Do you claim to love your husband?"
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.520]   She said, "Well, yes. I love my husband."
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:29.880]   I said, "Would it surprise you to know that the Bible says that you don't love him at all?
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.240]   What are you talking about?
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.320]   How can you say you don't know me?
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:34.800]   How can you say that?"
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.080]   That's right. I don't know you,
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.280]   but the Bible says that you don't.
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.240]   You can't say that.
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.080]   Where does the Bible say that?
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.760]   First Corinthians 13 says,
[00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:50.480]   "Love keeps no record of wrongs."
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:57.240]   Love keeps no record of wrongs.
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.400]   Really? Here's 25 years worth.
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.440]   I still have that ream in my file.
[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.840]   Don't have that. So what's going on?
[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.280]   What's really happened here?
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:19.360]   Well, it's pretty obvious that there are a lot of women who are very unhappy in marriage.
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.960]   There are many unhappy and discontent wives out there,
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.680]   not because they cannot find happiness and contentment,
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.800]   but because they've not known how or even tried to do things God's way.
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.600]   That's certainly true, and in most homes,
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.800]   roles have been meted out like toss salad.
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:40.720]   Few couples really have a biblical view on what their role should be in the home.
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:46.520]   Now, there's three things that I want you as a godly wife to remember.
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.320]   If you're really going to be the type of a woman that God wants you to be,
[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:55.120]   I want to be God's kind of wife in our marriage,
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.880]   and if that is your desire,
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.160]   if that's not your desire in your heart,
[00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.240]   then everything I'm going to tell you is not going to mean anything to you.
[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.240]   But if you really have a desire to be a godly wife,
[00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.200]   and you really want to honor Jesus Christ in your marriage,
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.560]   if that's what you want to do,
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.520]   then you're going to listen very carefully to these three things.
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:21.040]   They're really key. Now, anytime we have to deal with the wife's role,
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.120]   we've got to deal with this one word,
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:30.480]   and I'm wondering what comes to your mind when the word submission is mentioned.
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:31.840]   What is coming to your mind?
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.000]   Some women, this is what comes to their mind.
[00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.200]   Submission, there it is.
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.520]   All right. That's what submission is.
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:42.920]   That's what the Bible says.
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:44.600]   Or maybe it's something like this.
[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.520]   This is what submission is.
[00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.800]   Or maybe it's something like this.
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.120]   This is what submission is.
[00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.080]   This is what submission is.
[00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.280]   That's what the Bible is talking about,
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:06:00.000]   which shows that you've been really well-trained according to what the world says,
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.880]   submission is. But what does God say submission is?
[00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:07.360]   Well, grab your Bible again.
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:08.720]   We're going to go back to the Bible.
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.400]   If you don't have a Bible near you, you need to look at this.
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:14.240]   Find somebody who has a Bible near you so you can look at this.
[00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:18.880]   Ephesians Chapter 5, I'm going to pick up in verse 22.
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:22.920]   "Wives, submit to your own husbands as to the Lord,
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:24.320]   for the husband is the head of the wife,
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.160]   even as Christ is the head of the church,
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:30.560]   his body is himself its savior."
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:34.800]   So the first thing you got to remember in being a godly wife
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:39.840]   is to practice biblical submission.
[00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:40.840]   That's the first thing.
[00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:42.600]   Submission is the first key thing.
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.540]   Now in order to help you to understand this,
[00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:46.080]   let me talk about what it's not,
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:49.360]   and then I'm going to talk about what it is.
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.000]   And I have to talk about what it's not
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.720]   because we live in an entire culture today
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.480]   who has horribly misinformed us
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:00.200]   as to what the Bible means when it comes to submission.
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:03.880]   So let me identify for you seven things that it is not,
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:06.600]   and then we'll talk about what it is.
[00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:09.680]   When we're talking about submission,
[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.400]   it doesn't mean inequality.
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.600]   Never meant that anywhere.
[00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:17.000]   The world tries to pour that kind of meaning into it,
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.400]   and therefore they would say
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:21.520]   that this is a very demeaning thing for a woman,
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.960]   when in reality that's not the case at all,
[00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:27.600]   and you'll see why I say that in a few moments.
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:35.160]   And in fact, if you take a look at the Godhead itself,
[00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:39.600]   God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit,
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:42.560]   there is a functional subordination
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:45.280]   that occurs within the Godhead.
[00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:48.520]   Jesus Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane,
[00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:50.600]   before going to the cross, what does he do?
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:54.080]   He prays, "Let this cup pass from me.
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:58.640]   Nevertheless, not my will be done, but thine be done."
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:02.560]   And in doing so, Jesus Christ voluntarily submits himself
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:04.640]   to the will of the Father.
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:05.880]   Now, let me ask you this question.
[00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:09.600]   When Jesus did that, did that make him any less God?
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:13.760]   No. Did that strip him of any kind of attributes of being God?
[00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:14.920]   No, it did not.
[00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:17.400]   He was still fully and completely God,
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:21.760]   and yet he surrendered himself to the will of the Father.
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:26.200]   It's not as if Jesus didn't know or understand
[00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:28.360]   the need of going to the cross.
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.800]   It's just that Jesus Christ was not masochistic.
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:33.160]   He wasn't looking forward to the pain of the cross,
[00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:35.120]   but even more so, he wasn't looking forward
[00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:37.640]   for the first time in all of eternity,
[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:43.640]   in eternity, to be separated from the Father by human sin.
[00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:46.400]   That was the worst thing of all.
[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:49.080]   And the excruciating thought of that
[00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:52.080]   and that kind of separation.
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:55.640]   Hence, he prays, "Let this cup of suffering pass from me.
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:59.880]   Nevertheless, not my will be done, but thine be done."
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:01.720]   He's voluntarily surrendering himself
[00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:03.440]   to the will of the Father.
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.960]   He also said to the disciples, he said to them,
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:08.000]   "I'm going to return to my Father.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.600]   But when I do, I'm going to send forth the Spirit,
[00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:15.800]   and he will tell you what I have told him."
[00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:18.400]   So in this particular case, now we have the Holy Spirit
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:22.080]   surrendering himself and doing the will of Jesus Christ.
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:26.840]   Does that make, at any time, the Holy Spirit any less God?
[00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:28.240]   No, not at all.
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:29.120]   Not at all.
[00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:31.800]   He continually shares all the characteristics
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:36.000]   and all the attributes of God in his Godhead.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.160]   But nevertheless, there is a functional subordination
[00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.120]   even within the Godhead.
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:44.440]   Submission never meant inequality.
[00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:46.000]   It never meant that.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.720]   But somehow, in the way in which the world uses the term
[00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:51.920]   and plugs it within their context,
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:54.400]   they've turned it into a very nasty thing
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:55.520]   when it's not at all.
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:57.120]   Really, from a biblical perspective,
[00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:58.520]   it's a very beautiful thing.
[00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:01.560]   Furthermore, it doesn't mean
[00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:03.680]   the infallibility of the husband.
[00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:05.640]   There are some wives who do this kind of
[00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:07.480]   mental dance in their head.
[00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:11.000]   Okay, I'm willing to be submissive to my husband.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.540]   God, you just make it show he doesn't make any mistakes!
[00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:16.680]   All right?
[00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:18.560]   Well, anybody can be submissive
[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:21.200]   to anybody who's mistake-less.
[00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:23.520]   Anybody can do that.
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:26.480]   Well, there is no husband like this on this planet!
[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:30.200]   They're all gonna make mistakes.
[00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:32.760]   They're all gonna, because they're fallible.
[00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:37.080]   Every husband is a sinner except for one,
[00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:38.240]   and you can't have him.
[00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:40.400]   He's already married to the church.
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:41.400]   All right?
[00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:43.500]   That's the only perfect husband.
[00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:45.640]   You can't have him.
[00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:48.340]   Your husband is gonna make mistakes!
[00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:50.440]   He's gonna blow it sometimes.
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:51.700]   Actually, sometimes, some of the things
[00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:53.140]   that have happened in our marriage,
[00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:56.500]   I think God has had me blow it
[00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:59.420]   just to test to see if my wife was still gonna follow.
[00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:00.860]   Oh, I can see what she's saying.
[00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:02.500]   Here he goes again.
[00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:03.340]   Here he goes again.
[00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:04.540]   Oh, my goodness.
[00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:05.360]   All right?
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:08.580]   Is she still willing to follow in this particular case,
[00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:10.180]   and then later on, I have to learn,
[00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:11.860]   and yeah, Lord, keep teaching him.
[00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:13.380]   I know what her prayer is.
[00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:15.240]   All right, keep working on that guy.
[00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:19.120]   It doesn't mean the infallibility of your husband.
[00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:20.320]   It doesn't mean that.
[00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:23.920]   Furthermore, it doesn't mean immobility.
[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:25.240]   There are some wives who think that.
[00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:26.080]   I don't do anything.
[00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:28.260]   My wife, my husband does everything.
[00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:33.740]   In fact, I counseled a couple like that several years ago
[00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:37.520]   where they kind of defined submission that way.
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:39.880]   She didn't do anything except for basically stay home
[00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:41.800]   and cook meals and watch the kids,
[00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:44.920]   and he did all the shopping, and he purchased things,
[00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:47.080]   and he did all the driving, and he kept the books,
[00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:50.440]   and he did the work, his work and his job,
[00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:55.280]   and as he got older and now had a really bad heart condition
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:57.560]   and was close to death, he was scared to death.
[00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:59.080]   His wife didn't have a driver's license.
[00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:00.600]   She couldn't keep the financial books.
[00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:03.120]   She didn't know what was going on in terms of the bank.
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:05.340]   None of this was happening at all.
[00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:10.920]   He had not trained her in any way on what was going on,
[00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:13.040]   and now they're in a terrible fix.
[00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:19.640]   No, it doesn't mean that my husband does everything.
[00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:22.200]   No, on the contrary.
[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:26.320]   If you have a wise husband, he's going to work with you,
[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:28.640]   and the two of you are gonna share the responsibilities
[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:30.720]   of that particular marriage in order to move
[00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:35.160]   that marriage forward to the honor and glory of Jesus Christ.
[00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:38.000]   That's what should be happening.
[00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:41.980]   Furthermore, it doesn't mean inarticulation either.
[00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:48.120]   Well, this is the view where I just kind of remain silent.
[00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:49.320]   I don't say anything.
[00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:52.760]   No, your husband needs your input.
[00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:54.920]   I gave you that illustration last hour,
[00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:57.560]   how he carries around male blinders all the time.
[00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:01.280]   Well, in a similar way, you have female blinders on,
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:02.840]   and there are certain things that you can learn
[00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:07.720]   from your husband too, but your husband needs your input,
[00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:12.720]   not all the time, 24/7, but he needs your input.
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:18.480]   It doesn't mean you have to remind him 12 times.
[00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:22.440]   All right, doesn't mean that at all.
[00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:26.000]   It means that you need to give your perspective on it.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.200]   He needs to weigh it, and then they're gonna decide,
[00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:30.560]   he's gonna decide whether or not how far
[00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:32.680]   we're gonna move forward here.
[00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:34.400]   It doesn't mean you're inarticulate.
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:36.000]   God gave you a brain.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.140]   He gave you gifts.
[00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:40.520]   He gave you abilities, and it's important you use them
[00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:43.040]   in order to further your marriage
[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:45.160]   in honoring and glorifying Jesus Christ.
[00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:47.080]   That's really key.
[00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:50.160]   Number five, it doesn't mean intellectual stagnation.
[00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:51.060]   I don't do any thinking.
[00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:52.800]   My husband does all the thinking for me.
[00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:54.320]   It's that kind of mentality.
[00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:56.360]   No, that's not it at all.
[00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:59.120]   You need to think.
[00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:03.840]   You need to apply your intellect that God has given you.
[00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:05.320]   I mean, there are some women who act that way,
[00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:08.620]   that God wasted his time giving you a brain.
[00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:09.720]   He didn't do that.
[00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:12.100]   He didn't waste his time.
[00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:13.900]   This is the doormat mentality.
[00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:17.820]   And this is the type of thing that leads a lot of women
[00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:19.260]   who think they're doing the right thing
[00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.440]   into terrible decisions,
[00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:26.580]   where they allow their husbands to convince them
[00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:28.940]   to do all kinds of ungodly things,
[00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:30.660]   when if they were really thinking about it,
[00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:32.760]   they would never do it in the first place.
[00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:36.620]   No, God never intended you to be a doormat.
[00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:41.740]   God wants you to use your mind to its fullest extent
[00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:45.480]   in order to compliment your husband
[00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:49.240]   and to further your marriage to Christ's honor and glory.
[00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:53.440]   Number six, it doesn't mean your influence is impossible.
[00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:56.760]   In fact, I want to argue exactly the opposite.
[00:14:56.760 --> 00:15:00.280]   Jesus Christ, who assumed the most submissive role,
[00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:04.080]   even submitted himself into the hands of evil, sinful men
[00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:07.920]   and was crucified on the cross, changed all of history.
[00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:11.040]   From a biblical perspective, it's the submissive person
[00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:13.180]   that has the most influence.
[00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:17.840]   I can argue that from now until eternity.
[00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:21.800]   In other words, it doesn't mean you're not influential.
[00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:25.160]   You can be incredibly influential.
[00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:28.400]   If you try to follow the way the feminists tell you to do
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:32.400]   in the world today, then you will be rendered ineffective.
[00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:36.400]   Because they tell you to be assertive,
[00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:39.640]   demanding, insisting on your own rights.
[00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:42.560]   That's what they tell you to do, which makes you ugly.
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:44.280]   Nobody wants to be around you.
[00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:46.640]   It makes you incredibly opinionated.
[00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:51.100]   But when you are gracious and smart and honorable,
[00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:52.840]   the way Christ wants you to be,
[00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:57.840]   then you have incredible influence in this world.
[00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:01.840]   Unbelievable influence in this world.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.960]   And that's the way God intended you to have.
[00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:09.760]   Last of all, it doesn't mean iniquitous manipulation.
[00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:10.600]   Now, I'm a pastor.
[00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:13.040]   All these things have to start with I, okay?
[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:15.840]   But you know what I mean.
[00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:17.480]   You ever heard a woman say,
[00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:19.280]   yeah, my husband's the head of the home,
[00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:22.840]   but I'm the neck that turns the head, all right?
[00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:25.720]   He's the marionette and I'm the one behind the scenes
[00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:27.360]   pulling the strings, all right?
[00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:31.120]   I'm the one really making things happen in this home.
[00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:33.960]   I'm the one that's making him walk, talk, dance,
[00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:36.320]   and do whatever he needs to do in order to,
[00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:37.600]   yeah, he's the head of the home,
[00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:40.160]   but I'm really the one that's controlling things
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:41.120]   behind the scenes.
[00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:42.840]   It doesn't mean that either.
[00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:44.360]   Never meant that.
[00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:46.480]   And if you think that that's true,
[00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:50.440]   then you have the opposite view of what God says.
[00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:51.840]   Submission doesn't mean that.
[00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:53.960]   You say, okay, okay, I got it, I got it.
[00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:56.340]   I understand, but what does it mean?
[00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:57.240]   What does it mean?
[00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:00.040]   Well, I'm glad you asked that question.
[00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:03.280]   Let's take a look at what it means, all right?
[00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:06.320]   Well, what is it?
[00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:11.320]   Submission is a divine plan of function and order.
[00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:13.760]   The Greek term that's used in the New Testament
[00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:18.160]   is the word hupotasso, and it's actually a military term.
[00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:21.820]   It was used for soldiers that marched in rank
[00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:23.000]   or marching in order.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.240]   It was used sometimes in architecture
[00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:30.240]   to line up Roman columns where they would hupotasso
[00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:34.760]   one column to another column.
[00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:37.040]   They would line them up in order.
[00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:40.900]   So the idea here is the concept of submission
[00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:45.900]   is being in rank, marching in order, if you will.
[00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:51.200]   The idea is lining up so that orderly fashion.
[00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:52.040]   Why?
[00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:53.160]   Why is that so important?
[00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:57.600]   Because we live in a world, and you know this,
[00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:01.520]   where marriages are in chaos.
[00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:04.400]   It's just pure chaos.
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:06.280]   I'll never forget, 20 years ago,
[00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:08.720]   when we moved from Ohio to California
[00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:11.420]   to teach there at the Master's University and Seminary,
[00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:15.060]   we were put temporarily in a condo.
[00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:19.280]   Lord willing, I hope to never be in a situation like that
[00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:22.520]   anymore, in a situation like that,
[00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:24.480]   and live in a condo like we did.
[00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:26.240]   We did that for a year until we could find a home,
[00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:29.240]   but I remember in the morning, my wife and I would get up,
[00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:30.800]   and we'd have breakfast together, have prayer together,
[00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:34.160]   and read scripture together, and we'd have the windows open,
[00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:37.720]   and we could hear people in condos around us
[00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:42.720]   getting up, arguing, screaming, yelling, throwing things.
[00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:45.580]   I mean, on all different sides.
[00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:47.680]   And we would sit there, and we would pray for those people,
[00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:49.600]   and we would say, man, if this is the condition
[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:54.360]   of marriages in our country today, we are in deep trouble.
[00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:56.960]   We are in deep trouble.
[00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:59.640]   This never should be the way in which people
[00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:01.520]   should act with one another.
[00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:03.760]   Just common decency should tell you that,
[00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:06.080]   let alone what the Bible says.
[00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:07.560]   It should never be.
[00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:09.280]   That should never be anything.
[00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:11.920]   There's no order, there's no function at all.
[00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:15.120]   And listen, the world understands this on one level.
[00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:16.740]   The world understands this.
[00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:18.440]   Because, let me ask you a question.
[00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:22.400]   How many pilots are there on an airliner?
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:23.600]   I just flew here.
[00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:25.060]   There's only one, right?
[00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:27.320]   There's a pilot, and there's a co-pilot, right?
[00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:30.000]   Everybody knows exactly where they are, all right?
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.140]   You don't have two pilots.
[00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:35.360]   If you have two pilots, in an egalitarian sense,
[00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:38.440]   then what if there's a really dangerous decision
[00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:39.280]   that needs to be made,
[00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:43.160]   and they are different in their decision?
[00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:44.880]   You're gonna have that plane going like this.
[00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:46.400]   (grunting)
[00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:47.240]   And the people in the back
[00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:48.800]   are gonna be bouncing off the ceiling.
[00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:51.240]   That's the way kids are in our homes.
[00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:55.320]   We've got mom and dad fighting for control of the plane.
[00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:56.460]   And the kids are in the back,
[00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:59.040]   getting bounced off the ceiling, all right?
[00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:01.100]   And we wonder why our kids are so awful,
[00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:03.400]   'cause mom and dad are awful with each other.
[00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:05.600]   No, no, no.
[00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:07.320]   How many generals in an army?
[00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:10.840]   There's one general that oversees even the lesser generals,
[00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:12.040]   and all the people underneath them,
[00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:13.000]   and all the people underneath.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   There's one general, 'cause we know we can't function,
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.160]   we can't accomplish anything,
[00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:19.880]   and we can't move forward
[00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:22.720]   until somebody makes a final decision.
[00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:25.320]   God has designated your husband
[00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:27.560]   to make that final decision.
[00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:28.760]   I know he's not perfect.
[00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:31.680]   I know sometimes his decisions are unloving.
[00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:33.480]   I understand that.
[00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:34.560]   He is a sinner.
[00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:36.280]   I understand that.
[00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:39.200]   But is God, your God,
[00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:45.080]   big enough to overrule the stupidity of your husband?
[00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:48.520]   (congregation laughing)
[00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:50.200]   Yes, he is.
[00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:51.320]   He is.
[00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:56.320]   God is, he is big enough to overrule his stupid decisions.
[00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:59.400]   All right?
[00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:02.640]   This goes back to how much you trust God,
[00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:06.280]   and what God is doing in your home, all right?
[00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:08.200]   It's a divine plan of function and order.
[00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:09.580]   It's a way of life for every believer.
[00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:11.600]   You can see this in verse 21,
[00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:13.640]   when he talks about submitting to one another
[00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:15.380]   out of reverence for Christ.
[00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:16.220]   Why?
[00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:17.700]   This is not something that a woman learns
[00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:18.760]   when she gets married.
[00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:20.720]   If that's true, don't marry that woman.
[00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:22.720]   No, no, no.
[00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:25.500]   It's something that every man and every woman knows.
[00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:28.280]   When they're a baby, and they're a child,
[00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:30.120]   they have to submit themselves to their parents.
[00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:32.640]   Later on, they have to submit themselves to their teachers.
[00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:34.760]   Later on, they have to submit themselves
[00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:36.240]   to their professors at college.
[00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:39.880]   They have to submit themselves to the police officers
[00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:41.760]   there in society and culture.
[00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:43.480]   They have to submit themselves
[00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:47.080]   to the leadership of the church, all right?
[00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:47.920]   They have to submit.
[00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:51.160]   This is what should be an attitude
[00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:55.560]   for every believer in every walk of life.
[00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:57.440]   It's not just something a woman adopts
[00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:59.200]   when she becomes a Christian.
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:02.320]   Every man and woman should understand this,
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:05.520]   because it is a divine plan of function and order.
[00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:07.480]   It's a protection for the wife as well.
[00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:08.920]   It's like an umbrella.
[00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:11.320]   She doesn't have to be exposed to some of the things
[00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:15.280]   that are a part of this world the way he is.
[00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:17.960]   He's gonna shoulder those things, and she doesn't have to.
[00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:20.080]   This actually gives her freedom,
[00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:25.060]   living underneath that shelter,
[00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:27.920]   where he's sheltering many of those things.
[00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:29.800]   I know there are some husbands
[00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:31.960]   who have holes in their umbrella.
[00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:32.820]   I know that.
[00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:35.960]   So you need to get under the area
[00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:39.680]   that doesn't have a hole in it, all right?
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:41.720]   But if your husband's doing the right thing,
[00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:43.200]   he's going to be a shelter.
[00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:45.000]   His leadership's gonna be a shelter,
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.080]   and he should shelter,
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:49.200]   this is what true masculinity does,
[00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:52.640]   on his shoulders a lot of the big issues
[00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:55.040]   that you don't have to bother with.
[00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:56.360]   But once you decide to walk out
[00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:59.240]   from underneath that umbrella and do your own thing,
[00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:01.860]   now you're exposed to elements and things in the world
[00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:04.240]   that God never intends you to be exposed to.
[00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:06.440]   It's like the man in 1 Corinthians 15
[00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:07.560]   that Paul said the church
[00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:09.760]   had to take through church discipline
[00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:14.160]   because he was sleeping with his stepmother.
[00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:17.540]   Paul says, "Turn him over to Satan
[00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:18.880]   "for the destruction of the flesh
[00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:20.960]   "that his soul might be saved."
[00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:22.840]   In other words, they were removing him
[00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:26.360]   from the protective graces of the church,
[00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:28.480]   exposing him out in the world
[00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:31.820]   to be exposed to Satan and the elements of the world
[00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:34.480]   in order to bring him to repentance,
[00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:36.000]   to bring him back underneath
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.240]   the protective graces of the church.
[00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:42.880]   And by the way, in 2 Corinthians 2,
[00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:45.920]   that man was brought to repentance,
[00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:47.520]   and Paul then later says,
[00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:51.020]   "Now receive him back and comfort him."
[00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:52.760]   The Greek there is pretty explicit.
[00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:55.120]   "Throw a party for that repentant man.
[00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:56.720]   "He finally repents."
[00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:59.760]   Here's a guy who was unrepentant
[00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:02.140]   and sleeping with his stepmother.
[00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:05.360]   Things that didn't even occur in the world, Paul said.
[00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:08.200]   It was occurring there in the church.
[00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:11.400]   So it's a protection for the wife.
[00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:15.040]   Furthermore, it's an attitude in her heart.
[00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:17.120]   Attitude, it's as unto the Lord.
[00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:19.520]   You can see that in verse 22.
[00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:21.360]   "Submit yourselves to your own husbands
[00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:25.320]   "as to the Lord," it says.
[00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:29.040]   So the way in which you submit yourself to your husband
[00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:32.140]   reveals your spiritual walk before God.
[00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:36.180]   This is really important for you to understand.
[00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:37.940]   When you refuse to do that,
[00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:42.900]   that reveals the fact that your walk with God is not good,
[00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:45.640]   that there's a major problem in your walk with God.
[00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:48.380]   Furthermore, it's an act of the will,
[00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:49.220]   and it's not a feeling.
[00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:52.460]   You wait until you feel like it, it'll never happen.
[00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:53.660]   There are some women who do that.
[00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:56.600]   "I'm waiting until I feel like doing it."
[00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:58.500]   And guess what?
[00:24:58.500 --> 00:24:59.900]   It never comes.
[00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:02.300]   It never comes.
[00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:03.140]   No, no, no.
[00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:06.080]   It's something that I decide to do.
[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:08.460]   I decide I'm going to do it.
[00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:11.720]   And it's amazing how God actually uses that
[00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:13.560]   to change the heart of your husband.
[00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:18.280]   When he sees a wife who's really trying
[00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:20.260]   to do her best to do that,
[00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:23.520]   all of a sudden he becomes a much more agreeable person
[00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:24.360]   to live with.
[00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:28.160]   It's not just him that's changing, I want you to know.
[00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:30.520]   It's your perception of him that's changing.
[00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:32.440]   Not just him.
[00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:33.260]   He changes.
[00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:34.340]   Yeah, yeah, he does.
[00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:36.580]   But your perception of him is changing.
[00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:39.600]   So it's an act of the will, it's not a feeling.
[00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:41.520]   And it's the proof of your love.
[00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:42.400]   Why do we say that?
[00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:44.680]   Because John 14, 21 says,
[00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:49.360]   "If you love me," Jesus said, "keep my commandments."
[00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:51.720]   You can say that you love your husband,
[00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:55.140]   and you can say it until you are blue in the face.
[00:25:56.040 --> 00:26:00.600]   You can say it loud and long,
[00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:03.360]   but it's absolutely meaningless
[00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:05.620]   unless you're willing to follow him.
[00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:08.380]   It's absolutely meaningless.
[00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:12.080]   It is the proof of your love for him.
[00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:16.640]   Furthermore, not only that, it's an all-inclusive command.
[00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:19.640]   Notice this, where he says in verse 24,
[00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:23.520]   "Now as the church submits to Christ,
[00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:28.360]   "so wives should submit in everything to their husbands."
[00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:30.720]   Now, notice that in everything.
[00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:31.560]   Now, wait a minute.
[00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:34.760]   You say, "Well, what if my husband tells me to lie?"
[00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:36.520]   Or, "What if he tells me to cheat?"
[00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:40.120]   Or, "What if he tells me to do something wrong?"
[00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:43.440]   Well, if you study this within context again,
[00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:44.880]   because a text without a context
[00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:47.200]   is a pretext for a proof text, right?
[00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:48.800]   In context, you'll find out
[00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:52.180]   that it means in everything that is right.
[00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:56.460]   In everything that is right.
[00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:58.860]   In other words, if your husband tells you to lie
[00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:02.380]   or to cheat on your income taxes
[00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:06.060]   or to steal or to misrepresent,
[00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:08.380]   you need to say, "Sweetheart, you know what?
[00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:09.720]   "I love you.
[00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:13.320]   "I just love you, but I can't do that
[00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:15.620]   "because you're not my God.
[00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:17.380]   "You're my husband.
[00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:18.580]   "There's a difference."
[00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:22.660]   So this is where using your brain,
[00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:25.940]   living by the word of God, God will honor.
[00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:29.460]   This is really important for you.
[00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:32.460]   It's in everything that is right.
[00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:33.960]   It's an all-inclusive command.
[00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:38.660]   Furthermore, it's a proper relationship to God's authority.
[00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:40.880]   The proper relationship to God's authority.
[00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:44.420]   That shows that you have a learner spirit.
[00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:48.180]   You are being a true disciple of Jesus Christ,
[00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:50.900]   and this is a proper relationship to Him
[00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:53.060]   when you're willing to be submissive,
[00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:55.220]   and it's a way to stay youthful.
[00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:56.300]   Let me show you this.
[00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:57.140]   Take your Bible.
[00:27:57.140 --> 00:27:59.260]   Let's go over to 1 Peter 3.
[00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:00.760]   I told you I'd come back here.
[00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:03.900]   1 Peter 3, we already talked about
[00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:06.620]   why 1 Peter was written when we talked
[00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:08.720]   in the husband's section.
[00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:14.580]   Written to Christians undergoing severe persecution.
[00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:19.840]   Well, 1 Peter 3.1, it says, "Likewise," like what?
[00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:20.920]   Well, back in chapter two,
[00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:25.080]   like Christ dealt with unjust suffering.
[00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:28.280]   "Likewise, wives," this is Christian wives,
[00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:31.120]   "be subject or submissive to your own husbands
[00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:35.780]   "so that even if some do not obey the word,
[00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:38.840]   "they may be won without a word
[00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:42.360]   "by the conduct of their wives."
[00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:47.120]   In other words, you can win your husband over
[00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:50.160]   without lecturing him to righteousness,
[00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:52.160]   even if you have an unbelieving husband.
[00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:55.800]   This is really key, because women think
[00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:59.640]   that they can lecture their husbands into righteousness,
[00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:01.840]   and really, it does just the opposite.
[00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:04.400]   It sends up the walls.
[00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:07.720]   No, he says, "You live Christlike in front of Him,
[00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:10.920]   "that's the most persuasive thing that you can do."
[00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:13.200]   In other words, you don't put repent
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:15.160]   in the bottom of his beer can.
[00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:19.200]   That's not the way you bring him to righteousness, all right?
[00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:23.980]   You don't bombard him with words.
[00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:25.520]   You don't do that.
[00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:28.880]   That's not the way you win him over to righteousness.
[00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:30.800]   How do you win him over to righteousness?
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:32.560]   It's by the conduct of your life.
[00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:36.680]   Verse two says, "When they see your respectful
[00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:40.540]   "and pure conduct, do not let your adorning,"
[00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:43.440]   verse three says, "be external, the braiding of hair
[00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:47.120]   "and the putting on of gold jewelry and clothing you wear."
[00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:48.800]   Now, God's not against braided hair,
[00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:52.000]   and He's not against gold jewelry or clothing.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   He's saying that that's not where your true beauty
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.360]   is going to come from.
[00:29:56.360 --> 00:30:03.400]   But, verse four, "Now, ladies, put your seatbelts on,
[00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:07.020]   "helmets, and flak vests.
[00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:12.020]   "But let your adorning be the hidden person
[00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:16.060]   "of the heart with the imperishable beauty
[00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:17.760]   "of a gentle and quiet spirit,
[00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:21.040]   "which in God's sight is very precious."
[00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:23.420]   This is a very influential woman.
[00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:29.200]   Clear back in 1985, we planted a church
[00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:32.480]   in between Dayton and Cincinnati, Ohio.
[00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:35.960]   And I'll never forget, in those early days,
[00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:38.400]   we had an elderly couple that came to our church.
[00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:40.420]   Their names were Delbert and Evelyn Lakes,
[00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:42.240]   really godly couple.
[00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:43.320]   They're in heaven now.
[00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:46.120]   I so look forward to seeing Delbert and Evelyn
[00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:47.660]   someday in heaven.
[00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:49.640]   But they were an elderly couple in our church,
[00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:51.560]   and we had a very young church.
[00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:55.960]   But I would watch as a pastor at the Collegiate of Services
[00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:58.640]   all the young men and women gather around
[00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:01.720]   Delbert and Evelyn, not because they were beautiful.
[00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:02.560]   They weren't.
[00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:05.360]   You never find them on the front page of Seventeen magazine.
[00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:08.940]   They weren't good-looking people at all.
[00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:14.320]   But I'm telling you, they were some of the most
[00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:19.320]   attractive people on the planet, and especially Evelyn.
[00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:22.040]   Evelyn was just a godly woman,
[00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:25.560]   and all the women wanted to know what her secret was.
[00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:27.280]   Wasn't external.
[00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:30.000]   You could buy gallons and gallons of oil of Olay
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.060]   and take baths in it all day long,
[00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:34.800]   and you are fighting a losing battle!
[00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:36.360]   All right, this is gonna get wrinkled.
[00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:38.260]   You're gonna get crow's feet.
[00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:40.440]   All right, you're gonna get stooped over.
[00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:43.040]   You can take vitamins, ad infinitum, and calcium,
[00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:47.240]   all you want, and age is gonna take its toll.
[00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:49.760]   But the way you stay beautiful
[00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:52.520]   has to do with the inner person of the heart!
[00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:56.600]   That beauty that comes from the inside,
[00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:58.280]   that is a beautiful thing.
[00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:02.080]   Any husband that doesn't realize that
[00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:04.480]   is not a husband that's interested in godliness.
[00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:07.920]   (silence)
[00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:10.360]   A gentle and quiet spirit, this is not a woman
[00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:12.000]   who's weak, milquetoast type of,
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.720]   this is a very strong woman who knows
[00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:15.620]   exactly what she believes.
[00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:19.520]   She trusts in god, she's not demanding,
[00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:22.680]   she's not hateful, she's not assertive.
[00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:26.000]   She doesn't demand her rights, she doesn't do that.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:29.440]   She trusts a sovereign god that's working in her life.
[00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:33.280]   She lives out Christlikeness and lets the results,
[00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:35.720]   leaves the results up to god.
[00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:37.400]   That's what she does.
[00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:38.860]   It's a way to stay youthful.
[00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:41.480]   And it's a picture of how the church
[00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:44.520]   of Jesus Christ is to obey him.
[00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:46.400]   Soldiers in rank, pillars in place,
[00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:48.080]   the church obeying god.
[00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:49.900]   That's what should be happening.
[00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:51.960]   It's a picture of this.
[00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:54.920]   Now on what is this based?
[00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:55.760]   What is this based?
[00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:57.400]   Well notice this.
[00:32:57.400 --> 00:33:00.560]   Take your Bible again, let's go over to 1 Timothy,
[00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:04.960]   chapter two, 1 Timothy chapter two.
[00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:06.760]   We'll pick up in verse 13.
[00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:13.800]   Notice this, it says this submission
[00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:16.860]   is based upon creation order.
[00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:22.560]   Verse 13 says, "For Adam was formed first, then Eve."
[00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:25.040]   Paul's explaining why this is so important here,
[00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:29.160]   and in this case, he's saying even if sin
[00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:30.560]   had never come into the world,
[00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:32.640]   God still would have expected women
[00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:35.000]   to follow their husband in terms of leadership.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.720]   It's based on the order of creation.
[00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:42.560]   For Paul, the order of creation
[00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:47.560]   has theological significance in this issue.
[00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:53.360]   And then verse 14 goes on and says,
[00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:55.040]   now bringing sin into the picture,
[00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:57.960]   "And Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived
[00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:00.120]   "and became the transgressor."
[00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:04.080]   So it's also based upon Eve's fall into sin.
[00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:09.440]   It's based upon Eve's fall into sin.
[00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:14.080]   Eve has a problem, that is giving in to people.
[00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:17.960]   So this becomes a protection for her.
[00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:19.400]   This becomes a key thing.
[00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:24.680]   We know that, even in sales, they know this.
[00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:26.640]   If they can call a home,
[00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:28.360]   and they always call right around supper time
[00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:29.720]   'cause they know everybody's gonna be assembled.
[00:34:29.720 --> 00:34:31.120]   You get those kind of phone calls.
[00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:32.920]   Well, people don't have landlines anymore.
[00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:35.680]   Now they're getting into cell phones now,
[00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:39.380]   but we still have a landline in our house.
[00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:42.080]   And we get sales calls right around supper times.
[00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:43.460]   Phones silent all day long.
[00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:44.760]   Supper time, it lights up.
[00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:46.320]   They wanna sell you windows,
[00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:48.800]   and they wanna sell you blinds,
[00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:51.960]   and they wanna sell you everything on the planet.
[00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:54.140]   And they know statistically, I've read the statistics,
[00:34:54.140 --> 00:34:55.920]   if they can talk to the woman of the household,
[00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:57.680]   statistically, they can sell more.
[00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:00.740]   All right, 'cause men will be rude.
[00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:02.720]   They'll just hang up on 'em.
[00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:05.640]   All right, women will listen to their whole spiel
[00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:06.960]   type of thing.
[00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:07.800]   Now, I know you're saying,
[00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:09.520]   "That wouldn't happen to my household."
[00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:11.340]   I know, but statistics don't lie.
[00:35:11.340 --> 00:35:17.800]   The implication here is that she has a problem
[00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:20.380]   giving in to people.
[00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:24.780]   That's really such a key thing.
[00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:26.940]   This becomes a protection for her.
[00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:31.220]   Then it's a lesson that God once taught.
[00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:33.580]   That is obedience to Christ.
[00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:37.700]   By her doing this, she's teaching other young women,
[00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:39.560]   she's teaching her children,
[00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:43.540]   she's even teaching her husband obedience to Christ.
[00:35:43.540 --> 00:35:48.160]   And upon that, godly submission is built.
[00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:52.240]   It's built upon the order of creation.
[00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:54.540]   It's built upon Eve's fall into sin.
[00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:56.980]   It's built upon the fact that God wants
[00:35:56.980 --> 00:35:58.600]   that lesson to be taught.
[00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:02.580]   That's what God has established.
[00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:04.060]   So the first thing you gotta remember
[00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:06.960]   in order to be a godly wife is submission.
[00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:08.800]   There's a second thing.
[00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:09.740]   I want you to grab your Bible
[00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:12.280]   and go back to Genesis chapter two and verse 18.
[00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:15.180]   Genesis chapter two and verse 18.
[00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:20.180]   We were there in our first session last night.
[00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:24.540]   Verse 18 says, "Then the Lord God said,
[00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:26.300]   "It is not good that man should be alone,
[00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:29.600]   "that I will make a helper suitable for him."
[00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:31.360]   The second thing you need to understand
[00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:35.320]   in being a godly husband or be a godly wife
[00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:36.900]   is to be a suitable helper.
[00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:40.360]   What does that really mean?
[00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:43.400]   What does it mean, as I mentioned in our first session,
[00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:45.600]   what does it mean to be an eiser conigno?
[00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:50.600]   Well, it's someone who is ideally suited for him.
[00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:55.080]   She is his perfect complement.
[00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:58.220]   She is a completer.
[00:36:58.220 --> 00:37:00.580]   She's a fitting help.
[00:37:00.580 --> 00:37:03.340]   She's not a dishwasher, she's not a housewife,
[00:37:03.340 --> 00:37:07.500]   she's not a babysitter, but she is a completer.
[00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:09.860]   She completes him.
[00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:14.280]   She brings companionship into that relationship.
[00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:20.380]   That means also that her husband is her primary ministry.
[00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:21.440]   There's no one else.
[00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:24.940]   It's not the kids that are her primary ministry.
[00:37:24.940 --> 00:37:27.540]   It's not other people outside the home.
[00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:30.520]   It's not people at church that's her primary ministry.
[00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:34.420]   It's not someone in the neighborhood.
[00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:39.060]   Her primary ministry, in God's eyes, is her husband.
[00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:42.460]   You say, "Well, what if you have a husband
[00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:43.580]   "that's not a believer?"
[00:37:43.580 --> 00:37:45.420]   Well, that's still her primary ministry.
[00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:49.180]   She is God's called missionary to him.
[00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:52.700]   1 Peter 3, 1 through 6, talks about how she should live
[00:37:52.700 --> 00:37:54.100]   with an unbelieving husband.
[00:37:54.100 --> 00:37:55.860]   And if that's true with an unbelieving husband,
[00:37:55.860 --> 00:37:58.800]   it certainly should be true of a believing husband as well,
[00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:00.960]   how she needs to live.
[00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:05.580]   So her husband then is her primary ministry.
[00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:08.160]   God has so designed her heart that she will find
[00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:11.360]   her greatest joy and contentment in that role,
[00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:14.340]   that is being his suitable helper.
[00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:20.780]   He's not put into the home to follow her aspirations.
[00:38:20.780 --> 00:38:25.960]   She is placed in the home to follow his aspirations.
[00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:28.300]   There's a difference, and it's a huge one.
[00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:31.200]   And that priority shift has taken place,
[00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:36.200]   and no wonder it has stripped men of true masculinity
[00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:37.820]   from a biblical perspective.
[00:38:37.820 --> 00:38:42.220]   There's nothing more that a man wants than to be able
[00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:46.500]   to protect and provide for their wife.
[00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:51.300]   It's not his job to follow her career.
[00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:55.500]   It is her job to follow his career.
[00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:56.900]   Now, is it bad that she has a career?
[00:38:56.900 --> 00:38:58.700]   No, I'm not saying it's bad.
[00:38:58.700 --> 00:39:01.860]   But her primary responsibility is that home,
[00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:05.180]   and her primary ministry is her husband.
[00:39:05.180 --> 00:39:07.680]   That's really a key thing.
[00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:11.420]   And anything less than that is going to introduce misery,
[00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:16.180]   strife, difficulty, and hardship into that home.
[00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:20.140]   Now, let me help you see this.
[00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:22.220]   Let's go back to 1 Timothy chapter two.
[00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:25.020]   This is really important.
[00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:27.580]   1 Timothy chapter two.
[00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:34.060]   We already took a look at verse 13 and 14.
[00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:36.380]   Now take a look at verse 15.
[00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:41.380]   Yet she shall be saved through childbearing,
[00:39:41.540 --> 00:39:43.940]   if they continue in faith and love
[00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:45.860]   and holiness with self-control.
[00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:46.700]   What does that mean?
[00:39:46.700 --> 00:39:48.820]   It doesn't mean eternally saved.
[00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:50.260]   That's not what it means here.
[00:39:50.260 --> 00:39:53.420]   Saved, the word sozo, can be used in different senses.
[00:39:53.420 --> 00:39:58.420]   Here it is, saved from heartache, strife,
[00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:03.860]   difficulty, and hardship, if she gets her priorities straight.
[00:40:03.860 --> 00:40:09.080]   That's really a critical thing.
[00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:13.700]   God saves her from those kinds of hardships
[00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:16.620]   and difficulty and heartaches,
[00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:20.180]   if she gets godly priorities straight in her home.
[00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:23.820]   She finds her greatest joy,
[00:40:23.820 --> 00:40:27.380]   her greatest contentment in that role.
[00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:32.380]   She then is a contributing member of a partnership.
[00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:34.840]   As Titus two, verses three through five says,
[00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:36.340]   she is supposed to be,
[00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:39.680]   her primary role is to be busy at home,
[00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:41.840]   contributing to that partnership.
[00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:47.540]   The result is that God then blesses that home.
[00:40:47.540 --> 00:40:51.280]   And this is where Proverbs 31, verse 28,
[00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:54.120]   talks about her husband and her children
[00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:56.860]   rise up and call her blessed.
[00:40:56.860 --> 00:41:00.260]   Because everything she does in the virtuous woman
[00:41:00.260 --> 00:41:04.480]   there in Proverbs 31 is in order to benefit her husband
[00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:06.380]   and to benefit her children.
[00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:08.180]   Everything that she does, does that.
[00:41:08.180 --> 00:41:12.860]   So, the first thing you gotta remember
[00:41:12.860 --> 00:41:14.520]   in being a godly wife is submission.
[00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:17.160]   The second thing you need to remember is suitable helper.
[00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:18.580]   There's a third thing.
[00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:21.320]   Let's go over to Ephesians chapter five.
[00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:24.640]   And we're gonna take a look at verse 33.
[00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:28.640]   Ephesians chapter five and verse 33.
[00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:35.520]   Paul has a summary verse here for both husbands and wives.
[00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:37.000]   And he says, however,
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:40.520]   let each one of you love his wife as himself.
[00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:43.560]   He goes back to the love that the husband's supposed to have
[00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:47.640]   and let the wife see to it that she respects her husband.
[00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:49.880]   The Greek term that's used there is phobos.
[00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:51.960]   It's where we often translate the word fear,
[00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:54.800]   but it doesn't mean fear in the sense of horror or terror.
[00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:57.000]   It means fear in the sense of respect.
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:58.380]   Hence it translated,
[00:41:58.380 --> 00:42:00.860]   she sees to it that she respects her husband.
[00:42:00.860 --> 00:42:02.200]   The first thing is submission.
[00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:03.640]   The second thing, suitable helper.
[00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:07.840]   The third thing has to do with being selflessly reverent.
[00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:09.960]   Those three things are really key.
[00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:12.680]   Selflessly reverent.
[00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:15.200]   What does it mean to be selflessly reverent?
[00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:18.100]   It means to honor him, prefer him, venerate him,
[00:42:18.100 --> 00:42:22.960]   esteem him, praise him, love him, admire him exceedingly.
[00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:23.920]   That's what it means.
[00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:25.040]   And I know what you're thinking.
[00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:26.920]   I've had women say this to me before.
[00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:29.240]   Oh my goodness, you know, if I do that,
[00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:30.600]   you don't know my husband.
[00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:32.760]   So what?
[00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:36.700]   Well, if I do this, this is just gonna feed his male ego.
[00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:39.400]   This guy's gonna be an impossible person to live with.
[00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:43.360]   And I want to suggest to you
[00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:45.100]   that just the opposite will happen.
[00:42:45.100 --> 00:42:47.940]   If he's a godly husband,
[00:42:47.940 --> 00:42:52.960]   he'll know above all people on the planet
[00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:57.140]   how much he does not deserve that honor,
[00:42:57.140 --> 00:43:00.640]   that veneration, that esteem, that praise,
[00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:04.960]   that kind of love, that type of admiration above all thing,
[00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:07.640]   and it actually has a humbling effect.
[00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:11.640]   When you try to compete with him,
[00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:15.120]   then that's going to throw up the walls,
[00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:17.480]   that's gonna bring in the strife.
[00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:20.960]   When you start honoring him, preferring him,
[00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:23.920]   venerating him, esteeming him, praising him,
[00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:26.880]   loving him, admiring him exceedingly,
[00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:28.280]   when you start doing that,
[00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:31.160]   you will have a different husband.
[00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:33.160]   You show me a wife that does that,
[00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:36.060]   and I will show you a very happy husband.
[00:43:36.060 --> 00:43:39.520]   A wife that does that,
[00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:43.680]   and that's what a husband's heart wants.
[00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:46.880]   He wants his wife to do that.
[00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:49.920]   Not artificially, not fake praise.
[00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:51.560]   We're not talking about that.
[00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:53.940]   We're talking about genuine praise
[00:43:53.940 --> 00:43:57.160]   where you can find your husband does plenty of things,
[00:43:57.160 --> 00:43:59.900]   and he does it well, you just ignore it.
[00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:03.560]   You need to find it.
[00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:05.880]   You need to start being alert to it.
[00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:10.680]   We're talking about honoring him, preferring him,
[00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:14.840]   esteeming him, all of these things.
[00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:17.960]   She is to hold him in the highest esteem
[00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:19.960]   within her own heart and mind.
[00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:21.260]   This is really key.
[00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:25.260]   This is what she must do.
[00:44:25.260 --> 00:44:28.100]   But the opposite is happening.
[00:44:28.100 --> 00:44:32.860]   Instead of she's critical, she's angry, she's bitter,
[00:44:32.860 --> 00:44:35.340]   she becomes hateful, terrible things
[00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:38.080]   comes out of her mouth towards him.
[00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:42.360]   Horrible, hateful things, angry things.
[00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:46.100]   She's not honoring him, she's not preferring him.
[00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:47.920]   She's not loving him.
[00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:49.580]   She's certainly not admiring him.
[00:44:50.940 --> 00:44:52.520]   I know that there are things about your husband
[00:44:52.520 --> 00:44:55.320]   that's not admirable, I know that.
[00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:56.360]   'Cause I'm a husband.
[00:44:56.360 --> 00:44:59.760]   I've worked with lots of husbands.
[00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:05.360]   But you need to find the things that are
[00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:07.960]   and zero in on them, and all of a sudden,
[00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:10.000]   you'll start to find a different husband.
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.480]   It needs to happen.
[00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:18.280]   What it doesn't mean, reverence him,
[00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:19.480]   don't try to revamp him.
[00:45:20.900 --> 00:45:21.840]   I mentioned this before.
[00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:23.320]   You're not his personal Holy Spirit
[00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:26.020]   to convict him of sin, righteousness, and judgment.
[00:45:26.020 --> 00:45:27.920]   The Holy Spirit will do a much better job.
[00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:29.200]   That is not your role.
[00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:31.080]   God did not give you that role
[00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:33.200]   to be critical to your husband.
[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:35.760]   Let the Holy Spirit do his job.
[00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:37.960]   Get out of the way of the Holy Spirit
[00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:40.840]   and let the Holy Spirit work in your husband's life.
[00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:44.320]   The Holy Spirit will do a whole lot better job
[00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:47.440]   than you ever will in a million years.
[00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:50.540]   Reverence him, don't try to revamp him.
[00:45:50.540 --> 00:45:53.640]   Focusing on his negatives becomes your excuse
[00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:55.580]   not to obey him or follow.
[00:45:55.580 --> 00:45:59.400]   And you can probably find plenty,
[00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:03.000]   but when you focus on those, that becomes your excuse.
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.240]   And a failure to do so ultimately
[00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:08.560]   will destroy your love for him.
[00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:11.520]   It's almost like dominoes that begins to fall.
[00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:13.720]   It's dominoes that begin to fall.
[00:46:13.720 --> 00:46:16.160]   Then you can see him, one right after another.
[00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:20.080]   Reverence him, don't try to revamp him.
[00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:23.520]   Don't try to do that, don't focus on his negatives.
[00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:25.080]   Being selflessly reverent means
[00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:27.920]   to admire him exceedingly and love him.
[00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:32.880]   Build a reverent heart towards him in your heart.
[00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:34.420]   That's what needs to happen.
[00:46:34.420 --> 00:46:38.420]   Too many women don't do that and they're miserable.
[00:46:38.420 --> 00:46:41.260]   They are miserable, not because they can't be happy,
[00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:43.760]   but because they've really not tried it God's way.
[00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:47.040]   Those dominoes begin to fall.
[00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:49.720]   A failure to actively pursue a high degree of respect
[00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:53.200]   for your husband will result in growing tension
[00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:57.920]   in your marriage, increasing anger in your life.
[00:46:57.920 --> 00:47:00.480]   Discouragement will set in.
[00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:03.920]   Depression will follow right on the heels of that.
[00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:07.640]   There will be a general hindering of God's work
[00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:12.120]   in your home when you fail to reverence your husband.
[00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:15.520]   God knows what he's talking about here in Ephesians 5:33.
[00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:19.040]   And if you don't follow it, remember how I talked about,
[00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:20.880]   according to Romans 12, nine,
[00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:25.280]   we've got to learn to hate our sin.
[00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:26.200]   If I'm not following,
[00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:29.560]   if I'm not truly reverencing my husband,
[00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:32.460]   then I'm going to pay the price for it, God says.
[00:47:32.460 --> 00:47:33.920]   And here's the price.
[00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:36.920]   I'm going to be, there's going to be tension.
[00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:38.160]   There's going to be strife.
[00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:41.360]   There's going to be anger and discouragement and depression.
[00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:48.160]   And it can go on for years, for years.
[00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:51.980]   And it doesn't have to, it doesn't have to.
[00:47:51.980 --> 00:47:54.740]   Three things you've got to remember
[00:47:54.740 --> 00:47:56.360]   in order to be a godly wife.
[00:47:56.360 --> 00:47:58.840]   Submission, suitable helper, selflessly reverent.
[00:47:58.840 --> 00:48:02.400]   You say, that's more complicated than the men's.
[00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:07.580]   Well, because I think you ladies
[00:48:07.580 --> 00:48:10.080]   are far more sophisticated in your thinking.
[00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:14.820]   All right, three things you remember.
[00:48:14.820 --> 00:48:17.960]   All right, gentlemen, hide your notes.
[00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:20.560]   All right, the ladies are all going to look at me
[00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:22.880]   and they're going to repeat pop quiz here.
[00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:24.360]   Three things you got to remember
[00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:26.400]   in order to be a godly wife.
[00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:29.480]   Number one, when I, I'm going to be a godly wife
[00:48:29.480 --> 00:48:30.680]   when I practice.
[00:48:44.120 --> 00:48:45.920]   We're going to try it again.
[00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:50.800]   This time, as my third grade teacher used to say,
[00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:55.280]   okay, children, take the smiles out of your pocket
[00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:56.280]   and put them on.
[00:48:56.280 --> 00:48:57.640]   Okay, here we go.
[00:48:57.640 --> 00:48:58.920]   Three things you've got to remember
[00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:00.280]   in order to be a godly wife.
[00:49:00.280 --> 00:49:03.100]   Now, say them out, submission.
[00:49:03.100 --> 00:49:10.020]   There we go, that's exactly right.
[00:49:10.020 --> 00:49:11.460]   In our next session, we're going to take
[00:49:11.460 --> 00:49:13.320]   a little bit longer of a break now,
[00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:15.440]   but in the next session, we're going to talk
[00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:18.120]   about godly communication, but before we go,
[00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:20.760]   gentlemen, you're going to delight your wives
[00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:23.560]   by recalling the three things you need to remember
[00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:25.220]   in order to be a godly husband.
[00:49:25.220 --> 00:49:26.560]   Ready, here we go.
[00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:32.640]   All right, ladies, put a smile.
[00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:34.320]   Not lever, leader.
[00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:39.880]   You're going to put a smile on your husband's face, ladies.
[00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:40.980]   One more time.
[00:49:41.820 --> 00:49:44.900]   (audience murmuring)
[00:49:44.900 --> 00:49:54.900]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
