[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160]   - As a biologist, as a neuroscientist,
[00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:05.160]   how do you think about this thing
[00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.160]   that we call hunger and feeding?
[00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:07.400]   - Absolutely, absolutely.
[00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.600]   So I think at a very high level,
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.920]   a good way to think about the regulation of food intake
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.860]   by the brain is that there's two systems,
[00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.440]   a short-term system and a long-term system
[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.000]   that are primarily localized to different parts of the brain,
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.280]   operate on different timescales,
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.520]   one on the timescale of a meal, so 10, 20 minutes,
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.920]   and the other on the timescale of sort of weeks
[00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.280]   to months to years and tracks levels of body fat.
[00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.720]   And these two systems sort of interact
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.040]   so that these short-term behaviors we do eating
[00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.280]   are matched to our long-term need for energy.
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.280]   And so I think one of the initial experiments
[00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.360]   that really led to this idea
[00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.760]   is this great experiment by Harvey Grill about 50 years ago.
[00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.480]   It's called the decerebrate rat.
[00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.440]   And so essentially what he did was
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.160]   he made a cut in the rat brains.
[00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.160]   He took these rats in the lab, made a cut
[00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.280]   so that he separated the brainstem,
[00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.820]   so the most posterior part of the brain,
[00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:04.840]   from the entire forebrain,
[00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.600]   basically got rid of 80% of the rat's brain.
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.000]   So he's basically creating these zombie rats,
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.480]   all they have is a brainstem,
[00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.800]   and asked, what can these rats still do?
[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.680]   And as you might imagine, they can't do a lot of things
[00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.400]   because they basically have lost most of their brain.
[00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.520]   But he discovered that one thing they can still do
[00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.320]   is regulate the size of a meal.
[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.160]   And so--
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.880]   - Very informative experiment.
[00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.920]   - And so, you have to be careful how we talk about this,
[00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:31.920]   'cause the way this meal works
[00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.800]   is you have to actually put food into their mouth,
[00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.520]   and then they'll swallow it as you put food into their mouth.
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.240]   But eventually at some point, they'll start spitting it out.
[00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.840]   And that basically is an indication
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.700]   that in some sense they're becoming sated,
[00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.400]   and they're just using the brainstem that they have left,
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.040]   they're able to sense those signals from the gut
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.240]   and drive the termination of a meal.
[00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.800]   And he did other experiments showing
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.420]   that many of these signals that come from the gut
[00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.240]   like gastric stretch, hormones that come from your intestine
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.320]   in response to food intake like CCK,
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.280]   these deserebrate rats just have a brainstem.
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.600]   If you inject those or manipulate the gut in those ways,
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.640]   it can in an appropriate way change how much the rat eats.
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.640]   Now, what can't the rat do when it doesn't have a forebrain?
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.080]   And the thing it can't do is it can't respond
[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.560]   to longer term changes in energy need.
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.240]   Meaning, if you fast the rat for a couple days,
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.920]   this deserebrate rat, then start putting food in its mouth,
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.760]   the amount that it eats doesn't change.
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.200]   So basically it doesn't eat a larger meal the way you would
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.720]   if you were fasted for several days and then refed.
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.480]   And that experiment along with other evidence
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.120]   has led to the idea that in the brainstem
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.840]   and then the most posterior part of your brain,
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.520]   there are neural circuits that control sort of a meal
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.800]   and then the timescale of 10 minutes or 20 minutes
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.440]   deciding when a meal should end.
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.260]   And in the forebrain, primarily in the hypothalamus,
[00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.920]   there are neural circuits that then track
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.560]   what is my overall level of energy reserves?
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.740]   What is my level of body fat?
[00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.680]   Things that would fluctuate on timescale of say days
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:58.920]   when you're fasting.
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.380]   And those forebrain centers feedback to talk
[00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.800]   to the brainstem and modulate those brainstem circuits
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.280]   that are controlling the size of a meal
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.460]   to sort of match these two timescales.
[00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:09.040]   So that's at the highest level how I think
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.480]   about the neural circuitry that controls feeding.
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.440]   There's obviously a lot more going on underneath that.
[00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.940]   - Fascinating.
[00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.720]   You mentioned body fat and that somehow the brain
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.800]   is tracking the amount of body fat.
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.800]   That caught my ear because while it makes total sense,
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.780]   I'd like to know how that happens
[00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.740]   if we happen to know the mechanism.
[00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:35.560]   And the second question is why body fat
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.300]   and not body fat and muscular mass
[00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.580]   or body fat and overall body weight?
[00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.860]   What is being signaled between body fat in the brain
[00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.780]   that allows the brain to track body fat?
[00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.220]   And why do you think body fat is the critical signal?
[00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.900]   I realize it represents an energy reserve,
[00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.320]   but certainly there are other things
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.000]   about the bodily state that are important.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.320]   - Yeah, well, there are certainly other things
[00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:58.600]   about the bodily state that are important
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:59.920]   and there are other things about physiology
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.420]   definitely that are regulated other than body fat.
[00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.080]   But body fat is unique
[00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.120]   because it represents this energy reserve.
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.440]   So the neural circuitry that regulates eating behavior
[00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.800]   is in some ways very unique
[00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.480]   because it has this reserve of energy.
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.000]   So we also study thirst in my lab and drinking
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.020]   and you don't have a reserve of water in your body, right?
[00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:21.080]   And that's true for basically everything else.
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:24.760]   But for fat, we have this reserve of energy.
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.100]   And so it's very important
[00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.900]   that the brain know how much remains
[00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.960]   and then adjust behavior in coordinates with that
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.200]   so that you know how urgent it is to get the next meal.
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.760]   And so the thought is that the major signal
[00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.560]   of the level of body fat that we have is leptin.
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.320]   It's this hormone.
[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.320]   It was discovered, it was cloned in 1994,
[00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:48.800]   actually by my postdoctoral advisor,
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.240]   a scientist named Jeff Friedman at Rockefeller University,
[00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.520]   although its history goes back way before 1994.
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.040]   So the sort of story behind leptin
[00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:00.560]   is that there's a facility called Jackson Labs
[00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.280]   that you I'm sure are familiar with in Maine
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.920]   that since the 1920s has been raising mice
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.720]   and selling them to academics basically
[00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.800]   who study physiology and behavior.
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.560]   And so they breed thousands of mice.
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.600]   So there's sort of a nonprofit organization
[00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.920]   that distributes mice to the scientific community.
[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.480]   And at some point in the 1950s,
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:20.320]   they spontaneously,
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.320]   just because they were breeding so many mice,
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.640]   they came across some spontaneous mutations,
[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.720]   mutant mice that were extremely fat,
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.120]   like the fattest mice they had ever seen.
[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.280]   These mice just eat constantly.
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.200]   They're just enormous,
[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.500]   three times the size of a normal mouse.
[00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.480]   And it's all body fats.
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:38.920]   They're just these huge fat mice.
[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:43.000]   And they came across several different mutant strains
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.360]   that all had the same phenotype
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.080]   in the sense that they were all extremely fat,
[00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.760]   all extremely hyperphagic,
[00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.960]   but they could tell even in the 1950s
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.880]   that these mutations were on different chromosomes.
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:54.720]   They didn't know anything about
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:55.780]   how to identify the genes at that point.
[00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:56.860]   That was just science fiction,
[00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:58.040]   but they knew that there were chromosomes
[00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.040]   and they were on different chromosomes.
[00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.200]   And so they labeled one obese,
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:03.400]   one of these mouse strains obese,
[00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:04.600]   and the other one diabetes,
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.360]   but they're basically the same.
[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:07.320]   As people wonder for a long time,
[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.560]   well, what's going on in these mice?
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:12.580]   Then there was a scientist at Jackson Labs, Doug Coleman,
[00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:15.600]   who had the idea, what if we do an experiment
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.780]   where we connect the circulations
[00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:20.560]   of these two different strains of obese mice
[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:21.600]   and test the hypothesis
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.480]   that maybe there's a circulating factor,
[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:26.240]   a hormone that is produced by one of these strains
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.400]   and that controls appetite?
[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.200]   Because at that point, insulin was known,
[00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:31.040]   glucagon was known.
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.000]   There were some hormones that were known
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   that were involved in metabolism.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.120]   So it was logical that there could be a hormone
[00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.120]   that perhaps regulates body fat levels.
[00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.560]   And what they found, which was remarkable,
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:43.120]   when you attach the obese strain to the DB strain,
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.500]   so you basically connect their circulation,
[00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:47.040]   so hormones are transmitted between the two,
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:52.700]   the OB mouse, that strain dramatically loses weight.
[00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:54.380]   In fact, within a couple of weeks,
[00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:55.580]   it looks like a normal mouse.
[00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:56.500]   It just stops eating.
[00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:58.100]   It loses almost all of its body fat.
[00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:01.060]   And it essentially, in all aspects, becomes a normal mouse.
[00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:03.300]   The DB mouse, nothing really happens.
[00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:06.420]   It still remains obese and still remains hyperphagic.
[00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:08.060]   And based on just that piece of data,
[00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:10.180]   Doug Coleman hypothesized that what was going on
[00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:12.500]   is these two mutations were mutations
[00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:14.240]   in a hormone and a receptor.
[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:18.100]   The OB mouse had a mutation in the hormone
[00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:20.300]   that comes from fat, so it couldn't produce this hormone
[00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:22.940]   that comes from fat and signals to the brain
[00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:23.780]   how much fat you have.
[00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:26.860]   And the DB mouse has a mutation in the receptor,
[00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:28.340]   so it can't sense the hormone.
[00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:30.700]   And that was just an idea.
[00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:32.440]   It was a hypothesis.
[00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:35.800]   But in the 1980s, as technology advanced,
[00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:39.060]   as molecular biology had been invented,
[00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:41.780]   it became possible to clone genes.
[00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:43.660]   A number of people tried to identify
[00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:46.620]   what are the genetic mutations that are occurring
[00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:48.340]   in these mice that make them so obese.
[00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:50.340]   And Jeff basically cloned leptin and showed that,
[00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:51.980]   in fact, Doug was exactly right.
[00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:56.740]   The OB mutation is a mutation in this hormone, leptin.
[00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:59.660]   And later, Millennium Pharmaceuticals showed
[00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:02.300]   that the DB mutation is, in fact, a receptor.
[00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:05.540]   And it was an important discovery for a couple of reasons.
[00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:09.380]   One, because this OB gene is just expressed in fat.
[00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:12.700]   It's exclusively expressed in adipose tissue.
[00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:16.340]   And how much it's expressed is directly proportional
[00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:18.140]   to how much body fat you have.
[00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:21.340]   So as you gain weight, the expression of this hormone
[00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:22.820]   increases in a linear manner,
[00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:24.340]   and then it's secreted into the blood.
[00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:26.100]   So the level of leptin in your blood
[00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:28.400]   is a direct readout of your body fat reserves.
[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:33.560]   This receptor for leptin, leptin receptor,
[00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:35.460]   the functional form of it is expressed
[00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:37.500]   almost exclusively in the brain.
[00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:39.500]   And it's expressed in all of the brain regions
[00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:41.840]   that we knew from previous work were important for appetite.
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:43.560]   So basically, the expression of this receptor
[00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:44.900]   gives you a map in the brain
[00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:46.840]   of the neurons that control hunger.
[00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:50.680]   And so what happens is, basically, when you lose weight,
[00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:52.240]   the levels of leptin in your blood fall,
[00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:54.920]   because basically you've lost adipose tissue.
[00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:56.560]   The absence of that hormone sends a signal
[00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:58.080]   to all these neurons that have leptin receptors
[00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:00.020]   in the brain, they're not getting that signal
[00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:01.920]   that I'm starving.
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:03.860]   And it basically, that initiates this entire
[00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:06.340]   homeostatic response to starvation.
[00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:10.060]   So a big part of that is obviously increased hunger,
[00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:12.000]   but it's also decreased energy expenditure,
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.220]   decreased body temperature, even decreased fertility,
[00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:18.340]   because you don't want to reproduce if you're starving.
[00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:19.900]   - Less spontaneous movement.
[00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:21.980]   - Less spontaneous movement, all of this.
[00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:26.500]   And so the thought is, which I think is absolutely correct,
[00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:27.860]   is that this hormone leptin
[00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:29.820]   is part of this negative feedback loop
[00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:31.620]   from the fat to the brain
[00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:33.020]   that basically tells you about your level
[00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:34.980]   of body fat reserves and how urgent it is
[00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:36.260]   to find the next meal.
[00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:37.300]   - Fascinating.
[00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:41.420]   As I recall, Amgen Pharmaceuticals owned the patent
[00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:43.500]   for leptin in hopes that it would become
[00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:45.420]   the blockbuster diet drug.
[00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:48.620]   The logic being that if you were to take this hormone
[00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:50.620]   somehow, or activate this pathway,
[00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:52.200]   that the brain would be tricked into thinking
[00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:54.700]   that there was more body fat, more energy reserves
[00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:58.500]   than there was, and then people would basically
[00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:01.460]   be less hungry, eat less, and lose body fat.
[00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:02.300]   - Yes.
[00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:03.700]   - What happened with that?
[00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:05.300]   Do we know why it did not work?
[00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:07.140]   - Yeah, so that's a great question.
[00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:09.760]   So there was a lot of excitement when leptin was cloned,
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:12.340]   'cause it was thought basically we've cured obesity.
[00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:15.440]   There was an auction for the patent, Amgen won,
[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:17.760]   I think it was something like $20 million up front payment,
[00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:19.800]   plus royalties, which at the time was,
[00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:21.420]   I mean, it still is a lot of money, but even more money.
[00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:24.260]   - Nowadays it would be a drop in the ocean
[00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:25.900]   compared to what companies will invest
[00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:26.940]   into potential diet drugs.
[00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:30.260]   - Exactly, but you know, at the time,
[00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:31.900]   and still a lot of money today,
[00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:36.100]   and they did a clinical trial, gave obese people leptin,
[00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:38.340]   subcutaneous injections of this hormone,
[00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:40.100]   and they didn't lose a lot of weight,
[00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:42.620]   and the question was why.
[00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:44.740]   And so what was subsequently revealed
[00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:47.540]   is that the challenge with leptin is that individuals
[00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:50.580]   who are obese do not have low levels of leptin
[00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:53.780]   for the most part, they actually have high levels of leptin.
[00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:56.020]   And so what they have is a state of leptin resistance.
[00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:58.500]   So it's analogous to someone who has type two diabetes.
[00:10:58.500 --> 00:10:59.900]   It's not because they lack insulin,
[00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:01.500]   it's because they actually have, over time,
[00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:03.060]   a high level of insulin,
[00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:05.140]   and so target tissue stopped responding to insulin.
[00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:06.820]   And the thought is that it's the same way
[00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:08.420]   in obesity and leptin.
[00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:11.340]   Now, subsequently, they went back
[00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:14.900]   and did a reanalysis of that clinical trial,
[00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:16.860]   and asked, what if you take all of these people
[00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:19.460]   and stratify them according to their starting leptin level?
[00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:21.500]   So some people have relatively low levels of leptin,
[00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:24.140]   some have higher, some have really high levels of leptin,
[00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:26.240]   and then ask, if we reanalyze the data,
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:29.260]   how effective is leptin?
[00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:30.140]   And as you might expect,
[00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:31.420]   the people with the lowest levels of leptin,
[00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:34.380]   they lost the most weight when you gave them this drug,
[00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:35.980]   and the people with the highest levels of leptin
[00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:37.300]   lost the least weight.
[00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:39.780]   So there is a rationale there for why,
[00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:41.860]   for a scenario in which leptin could work,
[00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:44.420]   either among the subset of people
[00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:47.460]   who just have, for some reason, lower levels of leptin,
[00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:49.180]   these aren't people with mutations like the OB-MALS,
[00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:50.020]   they have some leptin,
[00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:52.060]   they just don't have unusually high levels,
[00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:54.580]   or, alternatively, after weight loss.
[00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:56.860]   So after you've lost a lot of weight,
[00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:59.060]   your leptin levels plummet, they become very low,
[00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:00.340]   and that part of the reason,
[00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:01.620]   it's a big part of the reason
[00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:02.900]   it's so difficult to keep weight off,
[00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:05.020]   is because those leptin levels are so low.
[00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:07.020]   And so it's been thought for a long time
[00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:10.220]   that that is a scenario where treating people with leptin
[00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:14.220]   could be really useful to help them keep the weight off.
[00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:17.100]   Why it never made it as a drug for that application,
[00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:18.060]   I really don't understand.
[00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:19.060]   It has something to do, I think,
[00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:20.940]   with the pharmaceutical industry, with the economics,
[00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:22.740]   with a bunch of other issues
[00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:24.500]   that aren't necessarily scientific.
[00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:27.140]   But I think there still, in the future,
[00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:28.740]   is a possibility that it could come back
[00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:29.580]   for that indication,
[00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:31.420]   especially now that we have these GLP-1 drugs,
[00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:33.900]   and now there's just millions of people losing so much weight
[00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:35.100]   and perhaps they want to transition
[00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:37.740]   to a different kind of drug to keep the weight off.
[00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:38.620]   - Thank you for tuning in
