[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.400]   Well, we Protestants don't believe in any transitional place of reform between earth
[00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.400]   and heaven.
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.960]   There is no purgatory.
[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.440]   It's appointed for man to die once, and immediately after his physical death comes
[00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.160]   the eternal verdict.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.600]   And in light of that comes this question.
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:26.160]   Is it fair for the soul's eternal destiny to be irreversibly determined by the mere
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.000]   span of 70 years of life in this world?
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.680]   This question comes from a listener named Sean.
[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.360]   It's something that he himself was asked as a pushback.
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.320]   "Hello Pastor John, thank you for this podcast.
[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.200]   I was recently asked this question.
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.160]   What kind of silly God determines the eternal future of a soul based on the span of only
[00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.720]   one lifetime?
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.800]   This seems fundamentally out of balance to many.
[00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.640]   How would you help me answer this objection from Scripture?"
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:07.320]   I would begin and end by saying that God's judgment is not silly, but infinitely serious.
[00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:16.360]   And I would look for some indication behind that word silly that my friend is at least
[00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:24.240]   a little bit open to the possibility that what the Bible teaches may prove spectacularly
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:31.200]   true and make his own assessment of silliness a great problem for him.
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.320]   Is he open to that?
[00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:40.880]   And if I discern that he is willing to listen, then I would try to help him see how the Bible
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:49.840]   shows that it is perfectly just for God to condemn a person to eternal suffering, not
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:56.440]   just on the basis of 70 years of sinning, but five seconds of sinning.
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:02.800]   From his standpoint, the problem is much more serious than he thinks it is.
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:11.720]   Or to use his words, the maker of the universe is much sillier than he thinks he is.
[00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.520]   One more comment about attitude, and this is a big deal because Paul makes a big deal
[00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:17.960]   out of it in Romans 9.
[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.800]   Jesus makes a big deal out of it when he wouldn't answer the question of those who wouldn't
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.720]   tell the truth to him.
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.840]   One more comment about attitude.
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.440]   God can handle our questions.
[00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.080]   He can handle our frustrations.
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.760]   He can handle our being utterly baffled.
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.120]   He can handle our confusion.
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.000]   He can handle our being at an utter loss to understand his ways.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:54.400]   What God does not tolerate is an attitude of condemnation toward God himself, an attitude
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:01.300]   that writes him off even before we understand his nature or his action.
[00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:06.720]   To such a person, Paul says in Romans 9.20, "Who are you, O man?" to answer back to God.
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.880]   He would say, "Who are you to call God silly?"
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:16.040]   The problem is not the questioner's perplexity.
[00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.600]   That's understandable.
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:18.600]   We're not God.
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.740]   We're just human.
[00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.760]   His ways are often above our ways.
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:29.880]   The problem is an attitude of being unteachable, self-sufficient.
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:39.160]   So let me make three brief exegetical observations, text observations, and then offer a principle
[00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.920]   that I hope will help.
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:50.600]   First, Romans 5.18 says, Paul says, "As one trespass led to condemnation for all men,"
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:56.740]   that's a pretty amazing statement, "so one act of righteousness leads to justification
[00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:58.140]   in life for all men."
[00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:04.520]   This is why I said that the issue is more serious than 70 years of sinning resulting
[00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:05.920]   in eternal condemnation.
[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.800]   The issue is five seconds.
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:17.080]   That's how long it took Adam and Eve to be condemned with the whole human race.
[00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:25.600]   Treason against the all-wise God, the all-powerful Creator, the Sustainer of the universe, that
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:33.720]   brief act of treason resulted in the corruption of the entire race so that all of us are guilty
[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.680]   in our sin, and we know we are.
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:44.720]   Even the man who says God is silly knows it in his deep down consciousness.
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:50.760]   We know that because of what we have become in our corruption, we deserve punishment.
[00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.460]   That's observation number one.
[00:04:52.460 --> 00:05:00.720]   Number two, James 2.10 says, "Whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point has become
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.880]   accountable of all of it."
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:11.000]   And again, one sin makes us culpable of the whole law, and James explains why in the next
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   verse.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   He says, "Because he," we're dealing with God here, "he who said, 'Do not commit adultery,'
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.280]   is also the one who said all the other commandments," or, "Do not murder."
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:29.120]   If you do not commit adultery, but you do murder, you have become a transgressor of
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.120]   the law.
[00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:35.040]   It's the person behind the law whom you're offending, that's the issue here, not how
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.720]   many of these you offend against.
[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:46.320]   In other words, the issue is not the quantification of sins or the quantification of the years
[00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:47.840]   of sinning.
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:54.760]   The issue is the vast difference between us as sinners and the infinite greatness of the
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:57.200]   person we're sinning against.
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.040]   More on that in just a minute.
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.960]   Third exegetical comment from Galatians 3.10.
[00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:10.000]   "All who rely upon the law are under a curse, for it is written, 'Cursed be everyone who
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:17.160]   does not abide in all things written in the book of the law to do them.'"
[00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:23.680]   So from the biblical standpoint, as we stand before our Creator, we are obliged to do everything
[00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.000]   he says.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.840]   Not 99% of it, but everything.
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:32.960]   And if we do not abide in all the things written in the book of the law, we're under a divine
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.240]   curse.
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:43.840]   And I would encourage my friend at this point, indeed I would plead with him, not to exalt
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:52.440]   himself above Scripture and call God silly, but to humble himself at least under the possibility
[00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:59.880]   that because of his sin with all the rest of us, he is in great peril as he talks to
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:01.400]   God.
[00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:07.960]   So here's the principle I said I would mention, and I would commend it for his consideration.
[00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:16.720]   Any offense, any dishonor against an infinitely worthy, an infinitely valuable, an infinitely
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:27.920]   dignified, an infinitely beautiful being is an infinite sin and deserves an infinite punishment.
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:36.280]   If the only way to measure the seriousness of sin and the seriousness of punishment was
[00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:45.280]   the time it took to sin and the time it took to punish, then eternal hell maybe would be
[00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:47.080]   an overreaction.
[00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:53.120]   But neither human nor divine justice operates that way.
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:57.840]   It takes five seconds to kill a man.
[00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:01.000]   I'm talking about if I were to kill a man.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   Five seconds.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.160]   It takes five seconds to kill a man.
[00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:09.980]   And I would be locked up—well, I'm too old, but say a 20-year-old kills a man in five
[00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:10.980]   seconds.
[00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:13.840]   He'd be locked up for 50 years.
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:15.880]   And I did a little math.
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:22.440]   That's 378 billion times more punishment than the five seconds took to murder.
[00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:28.800]   We all know that time is not what measures the grievousness of a sin.
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:33.280]   Otherwise, it takes five seconds to kill, you'd be in jail for five seconds.
[00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:34.280]   Go out.
[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:36.160]   Everybody knows it doesn't work that way.
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:39.960]   It's a—I'm tempted to say—silly question.
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:42.080]   But I don't think so.
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:43.080]   It's serious.
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:45.360]   A lot hangs on it.
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:53.640]   The grievousness and heinousness of sin rises to its infinite proportions not because of
[00:08:53.640 --> 00:09:01.800]   the extent of time covered in the act of sin, but by the one whom we are sinning against,
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:07.560]   the dishonor we are bringing upon an infinitely honorable being.
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:11.360]   If you dishonor a toad, you're not very guilty.
[00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:17.280]   I stomped on a toad when I was a teenager, and I felt a little bad, but not much.
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:21.920]   If you dishonor a man, you're very guilty.
[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:31.600]   If you dishonor God, you are infinitely guilty, because he's infinitely worthy of every millisecond
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:33.460]   of worship in your life.
[00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:39.700]   If you don't give it, you multiply the storehouse of wrath.
[00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:43.700]   And who can measure such an offense?
[00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:46.700]   Well, God can, and he is just.
[00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:47.700]   Amen.
[00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:53.460]   That's the very, very high price of five seconds of treason against the Creator of
[00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:54.460]   the universe.
[00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:55.460]   Well said, Pastor John.
[00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:56.460]   That was very heavy.
[00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:57.460]   Thank you.
[00:09:57.460 --> 00:10:00.740]   And thanks for listening and making the podcast part of your week.
[00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:04.060]   You can subscribe to our audio feeds and search our past episodes in our archive, even reach
[00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:08.100]   us by email with a question of your own, even tricky questions that you hear from people
[00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:15.620]   as they attempt to undermine the gospel, which seems to be what we fielded in this APJ today.
[00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:21.860]   You can do all of those things through our online home at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:27.660]   Well in Matthew 5, 16, Jesus says we should let our light shine before men so that the
[00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:31.280]   world can see our good works and glorify God.
[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:36.740]   But in Matthew 6, verse 1, Jesus says that we should not practice our works in public
[00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:38.860]   to be seen by others.
[00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:41.540]   So we'll end the week asking this question.
[00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:44.400]   So should we Instagram our good works or not?
[00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:49.220]   The question is made especially interesting in light of Matthew 5, 16 and Matthew 6, 1
[00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:53.540]   and the apparent tension with those two texts.
[00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:54.540]   That's next.
[00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:55.540]   That's Friday.
[00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:56.300]   I'm your host Tony Ranke and we'll see you then.
[00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:56.800]   Bye.
