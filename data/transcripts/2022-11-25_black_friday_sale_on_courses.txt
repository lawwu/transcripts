[00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:36.300]   Happy Friday, Radicals! Just a quick announcement to notify you of a Black Friday sale on my digital products that are available for you.
[00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.300]   Currently, there are two products in the store.
[00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:44.900]   The first is the How to Buy Bitcoin Privately course. You can find that at bitcoinprivacycourse.com.
[00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:54.300]   In that course, my co-teacher Gabriel Custodiat and I will teach you how to acquire Bitcoin completely privately and anonymously.
[00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.300]   How to own Bitcoin completely privately and anonymously.
[00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:05.300]   And how to use and purchase things with Bitcoin completely privately and anonymously.
[00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.300]   If you're interested in that, go to bitcoinprivacycourse.com.
[00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.300]   Use coupon code "blackfriday" all lowercase, all together.
[00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:18.300]   Bitcoinprivacycourse.com. Let me slow down slightly.
[00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:24.300]   Coupon code "blackfriday" all together to save 50% on that course.
[00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:29.300]   The second digital course that is available for you is internationalescapeplan.com.
[00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:38.300]   Internationalescapeplan.com. In that course, I will teach you how to systematically and thoughtfully set up an offshore plan for yourself.
[00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:48.300]   Basically, if you ever had to leave your country or wanted to leave your country, how could you be prepared to go to another place where things are safer?
[00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:58.300]   All you have to do is look around at the world today and recognize that there are many hundreds of thousands, even millions of people who are wondering if they're safe where they are and they're looking for a safe place to go.
[00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:04.300]   And one of the crazy things about personal safety is that if you lose it, really nothing else matters.
[00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:10.300]   And so in that course, I describe for you how to build a plan for how to get out.
[00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.300]   That plan starts very, very simply and inexpensively, quite literally in the first stage.
[00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.300]   It's get a passport and a credit card and a cell phone that work overseas.
[00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.300]   You can do that. You don't need the course to do that. You can just do that.
[00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.300]   But I give you a whole bunch of ways to turbocharge that plan.
[00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:35.300]   And then we go stage by stage into kind of progressively more advanced plans, all the way up to and including having multiple passports, multiple residencies, multiple homes around the world, various places that you can go.
[00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.300]   And so you can choose which of those things is best for you now.
[00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:47.300]   And the way I present the information and teach you how to do it is in a very thoughtful staged approach that makes good use of your money, good use of your time, good use of your resources along the way.
[00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.300]   That's available for you at internationalescapeplan.com.
